[{"Movie":"Batman: Under the Red Hood","Title":"On Soft, White Sand and Gentle, Blue Waves","Author":"MeltedPanini","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12972647","Passage":"[Chapter 1] So, my life has been pretty crazy, and I haven't been able to update Four Blue Eyes . I promise that I will complete the story (it will likely take years because I have mapped out a long plot for it). In the meantime, I wrote this little one shot about Jason Todd inspired in part by the Greek myth Calypso. Hope y'all enjoy! Jason's eyes were completely crusted over. Everything was a haze, and everything hurt. As he forced his eyes open, he heard a melodic voice whisper, \"It's okay. You're safe now. Close your eyes.\" Two brilliant hazel eyes accompanied the voice, and he complied with the whisperer's command. Some time later he awoke again. This time, his body felt weightless. Healed. Perfect. His eyes fluttered open, and he was confronted with a picture he had only seen in postcards: a Carrbiean-esque beach scape with glittering blue waves and sand that looked almost translucent. He, covered in bandages and salves, was sitting on a bamboo bed. It felt wrong. It felt like a trick. Something Joker would concoct. Rushing to his feet, Jason snapped a sharp edge off of the bamboo bed and wielded it as a weapon. He assessed his surroundings while also trying to recall how he had gotten here. The last thing he could remember before the hazel eyes was being beaten with that damned crowbar. He shivered involuntarily. \"You're awake,\" the same melodic voice stated. He swerved around to catch the voice's owner. How had he not heard her coming? How weak was he, truly? \"Who are you?\" he demanded. \"I'm not your enemy.\" \"Sounds exactly like something an enemy would say,\" Jason growled. He edged closer to her, his bamboo weapon held like a sword, and hissed, \"Who are you?\" \"…My name is Cara.\" \"Where are we, Cara ?\" \"We are in a purgatory of sorts… You are in between life and death, Jason. The gods are unsure of whether or not to release you back to the land of the living or to the afterlife.\" \"The gods?\" Jason guffawed. \"The gods? Really, you expect me to believe you? Huh, Cara ?\" \"Yes. They are as real as you or I.\" \"Prove it. Prove that everything you've told me is true.\" Cara gave Jason a rueful smile and murmured, \"I am sorry, but I cannot. They will reveal themselves to you when they have come to a decision regarding your fate.\" … For the next several days, Jason slept with his eyes open, still reluctant to believe that this was not an elaborate trick created by the Joker. Throw him on an island with a pretty girl, make Jason comfortable, and then kill both the girl and him in a brutal, violent, horrible way. It wouldn't be the craziest thing the Joker had done. Not by a long shot. So, Jason, in spite of Cara's musings that he \"could not leave the island until the gods have decided,\" spent his time building a boat of bamboo and doing his best to ignore her. She, meanwhile, had other plans. She always tried to talk to him. Get to know and him and connect with him (she asked him about random, stupid things, and he often responded with a huff... Occasionally, he'd throw an answer her way to quell her incessant questions). Tried to make him laugh (she told stories and jokes, not cruel ones like Joker, but ones that sometimes made him fight to suppress his laughter and other times led him to roll his eyes). Make him smile (with her smile, which he did not at all under any circumstances find incredibly beautiful and genuine and oh god what was wrong with him?). She left food out for him for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert (sometimes he secretly wished dessert went beyond food). She provided him with salves and bandages for his wounds as well as hand-sewn bedding and clothes. Initially, he took her gifts without acknowledgement. But, eventually, she wore him down like the waves rolling up the shore. And it just happened one night. She handed him some sweet, tart-like dessert, and the moonlight was shining down on her just right, and he had never had a moment that felt this perfect. He pulled her down to him, onto his lap, and their night was spent together as one on the downy, white sand of the shore. … Of course, nothing so perfect and magical was meant to last. At least not for Jason Todd. The gods came down to his island. His home with her. And they, the gods, told him that his life was not over. He was to go back to his mortal life and be resurrected. Without Cara. ","Summary":" So, my life has been pretty crazy, and I haven't been able to update Four Blue Eyes .

I hope that this is ok:) Anyway, please no flames thank you! -I sadly do not own Batman, or the Batfamily. :( -This may get steamy, so I'm rating it T to be safe, though that might change….. So. Watch out. -This contains the gayness. If you don't like the gayness. Don't read. -*Ok i think that about wraps it up. Hope you enjoy!* Summery- He knew that this was dangerous. He knew that his elder brother was after his head, along with his younger siblings. But…. Something powerful was stirring in Gotham City. He knew about the Justice League, and what they stand for. Though compared to him, they are but ants skipping along a sidewalk. It's a test between lie's, Family, and loyalty. He will be stuck in the shadows with his sibling for as long as he can. But the bat family knows better. What happens when they shine the spotlight: right on him? Chapter 1- \"Nothing Left\" Maybe it was the cold air chilling my bones. Or the midnight sky, dusted with stars, shining billions of light years away. But. My mind was silent, finally given a rest after those thousands of years. I know it was selfish of me, but I couldn't resist. That long forgotten smile spread across my thin lips, it almost hurt, for how rarely I slipped out into expressions. \"What are you grinning about brother?\" A lean boy questioned, while taking a seat besides me, letting the breeze blow his midnight hair. I let a chuckle burn in my throat. He had a sense of humor at least. \"Nothing to be concerned with Marah. Just simply enjoying the stars is all.\" We looked alike you could say. Pale, ghost like skin, with a hint of black veins giving way underneath. It wasn't shocking by any means, just unnatural some might say. I knew he had more to say. We didn't ever just talk to talk. We don't waste our breath on unnecessary conversations. I waited for him to spit it out. Then it happened. \"You do realize that one day… we will have to tell..\" I shook my head, cutting his thought off. \"He's still so young Marah. We should let him live his childhood…\" My younger brothers face crunched up, I knew the look well. He was pissed, frustrated probably. But, in turn, he had the right. What happened…. It's not something that will just fly over the youngest ones head. He'll ask us about it….. Someday. And we'll have to provide answer yes? No. Not if we didn't want to. He just couldn't get past lying to the youngest face. But I knew it would crush him. Make him feel small and helpless. My brother went on. \"He might be the youngest off the three, but he's not idiot. At the age of six thousand, he knows better than most of us anyway. You shouldn't hold back on explaining the truth Septhis.\" \"I know that.\" It was silent for a moment. I decided to change the subject.\"We'll all have to move sooner of later.\" \"Why? Is the home we've recided in for the last thirteen thousand years, not good enough for you?\" I snapped. Enough of this nonsense. \"It's not safe here. Not anymore. He used to act like the barrier. But he's nothing but a pile of ash now. Do I have to remind you?\" My younger brother gulped, shaking his head at the bad memory. I was well aware how he felt. How we all did in fact. Our only defense was taken, and beheaded right before our eyes. Someone we counted on from the beginning was now lost. Now nothing about this land screamed home. Unless you count his body, that is still hanging, three hundred feet off the ground, show off like a prize. We dare not go back to that hell hole. Not ever. It was a few minutes before Marah spoke again, I could hear his mouth going dry, eyes narrowing. \"Let's pack our things… you're right for once. If it finds a weak defense system… it will tear us apart for sure…\" We jumped off the the buildings torn off roof, slipping through the air unfazed, as our feet hit the ground. Five hundred stories beneath. Nothing but silence meet us, as our gaze swept across the once rich soil, now not even something dead was left to decorate. \"I'll wake Azmaveth. He'll be tired. Be prepared for one hell of a fight Sephtis. If we do make it out alive. Don't expect us to forgive you.\" Marah brushed pass me as he stood above ground, before sinking into the dark rocks, retrieving Azmaveth from his deep sleep. As the oldest I was trying to save them both. Maybe they don't understand for now. But soon, all the pieces of the puzzle will come flying, making one gruesome picture. Hi! So… how was the first chapter? I tired kinda. Kinda. This for sure is not my best writing, but I hope it passed the standards! Anyway I know it's short. But I'm making them this way, so it's just easier to read! Bye for now! ","Summary":" Hello there! This is my first ever fanfiction where I have shared it with others.

Beep! Five AM means that the clock starts to scream so I can wake up. Today, however, I shut it off. I remind myself it's Saturday and I burrow deeper into the folds of a comforter on my bed. And if all else fails, Dick or Alfred'll come- Then, I realize everything. I'm on a flat matress with a thin, scratchy blanket over me. I'm in my tiny apartment, not that huge house. Dick's probably not even in this city. And Alfred isn't going to come wake me up if I decide to sleep in. They don't care anymore. Not after I died. And today is that day again-my birthday. I'm one more year alive in this mess. After getting dressed, I decide to spend my day thinking. I lay on the sofa and watch the sky outside with my head hanging upside down. First is for Bruce. I tried to take the tires off the Batmobile, and he busted me. I could've gotten out of it, and ran, I could've gotten out of all of this if I had ran just then. But he terrified me, and when he took me back to the cave with him, it didn't lessen. He listened to my story with interest a few mornings later. I can still give him that-he did listen. When he found out that my father and mother had both abandoned me, he took me in. Most people frowned on that, a rich man taking in a street rat like me, but he let me stay regardless. Bruce was a good father, raising me into a fighter and letting me hold my own. If only I had listened that night. We were fighting Ra's and the Joker, and I'd volunteered to take the clown on my own. He denied me that, saying that I needed to stay with him to be safe. Now, I'm wishing that I'd listened, to keep myself out of this struggle. But I ran off in a scuffle, losing him and chasing down the man in the purple suit-who turned around and ripped into me with that crowbar. He knocked me down pretty quickly. All the while, I was thinking, Bruce will come in any moment now. He's going to bust down that door, right on the handle, and he'll save me. He's gonna smash a hole in the wall, right there, I can see it- and then he didn't. But I forgive him. It's okay, he wouldn't have made it no matter what he did. I could've escaped fine if I hadn't snuck off in the first place-and he was the perfect father to try and save me. It was too late for me. And then thoughts drift to the bird. The bird that maybe might've made it in time, maybe not. When I arrived at the Cave, he was dressed as Nightwing and waiting. He'd spoken a few words to Bruce, all the while watching me out of the corner of his eye. I couldn't blame him-I was a grease-covered street rat, there in the Batcave. My stained white shirt stood out more than I liked. A few nights later, I'd discovered Bruce was Batman and deduced Nightwing's identity. He offered me his old suit, which I later discovered was Bruce's idea all along. I accepted, taking the mantle that cost me my life. . . but I had many happy patrols before that dreadful night. Oftentimes he and I would go out together, even. When I came back, I almost went to him and told him everything. It would've made things easier, I think, to tell him and the girl. He used to chase her, I remember, but now we are simply siblings and nothing more. Perhaps that's for the better, seeing as how she lost so much while I was gone. I was always closer to her than Dick was, I think-oh, her, Barbara. Barbie, sweet, strong Barbie. She was the first Batgirl, a hero who got to choose her own way into the life. For that I envied her, but at least I had the comfort of knowing I would be better trained on the streets than her. She learned fast, but I always stayed ahead. Until I died. When I was gone, that madman went after her. He almost killed her, too, and when I came back, I hunted her out. I found the records telling me all of this, and I followed the trail into the ICU of a Gotham hospital not far from the place we had trained and lived together at. She had a heart of gold, but even that couldn't keep the shadows out of her eyes when she did wake up. All of this, I watched from a corner in the shadows. She never noticed me, and if she did she simply laid there, murmuring. Her words made my head spin, and I knew she was sick and going to get sicker. \"First Dick's gotta go and leave me, and I thought it was bad. Then Jay's off and dead before anyone can find him, and it's my fault, it's my fault for not finding him. Now I can't even sit up on my own, all the feeling's gone from my legs down. I won't get patrol anymore, I can't be Bat-\" Sobs mixed with coughing as she lay there stopped her. I moved to help her before I saw a boy slip into the room and tend to her. He was wearing an old T-shirt I remembered Dick wearing and I knew he was one of them. Had they replaced me? I had to go and discover this, but not until I took care of my older sister's slowly breaking heart. A note left beside her, tucked under her sleeping hand, would suffice. I leapt out the window, down the roof, and away to where I was spending the night back then-whether it was an alley or a doorway, I can't remember. Back then, I was a loner. I thrived by simply knowing how to survive. As I ran, I remembered the words I had written, and now I think of them one more time. Barbie- Be strong for me. You'll be okay. Tell Dick you miss him, he'll come and visit more often. I shouldn't have snuck off, because I did I lost my life. If anything my death was MY fault, not yours. If you wanna take it out on someone, go for the madman. Jay PS- Superheroes don't always work in the field, you know. You don't need to be fighting to still be an amazing hero. It was time to find the mystery boy. Sure, I was mad at first. I would go out and watch the kid on patrols sometimes, just wanting to prove to myself that he had a fault. Nothing I saw proved him worthless, however. He was good in combat and he knew stealth(which was probably easier for him since he didn't have pixie shorts and a bright yellow cape on, but I left that out-I got a uniform change, too). I saw him fight without fury, which was a luxury I had for only a few weeks as Robin-but he kept that up for months. Eventually, that anger turned to envy. Yes, I will admit it now, so many years later, I envied Tim Drake. He did take the Wayne name, not that I would ever call him that. He was simply my Replacement, and I treated him as such-until I realized he needed a brother, and Dick was out of the question, with all he needed to do with his many groups and such. Not to mention the fact he lived in Bludhaven, and I was skipping around Gotham like a stone on a river. I could be there if I wanted, but resentment was strong in my blood, and it took a dark night to overcome it. After an almost okay night there, I moved back into the Manor. All I had was a backpack and my Red Hood outfit, so it wasn't exactly hard for me to make the transition-until Bruce found out. To say he was happy would be an understatement-he was spilling over with a cascade of broken joy. We sat out by the fire pit one night, just talking, and we both realized it wasn't just Tim who needed people around, it was all of us. I feel like Tim deserves more credit for bringing me home. My thoughts drift like a sled in snow. Snow, white powder that silently overtakes the earth, yes, snow. We were watching it like little kids, Tim and I, when she came in. Barbie and Dick were on the way to yet another Christmas party, and they ditched her in the kitchen, swiping a few of Alfred's still warm cookies while they were at it. Her hair was black, hanging into her eyes in a straight, perfect line. Her dark eyes, facing the floor, were covered in a sticky eyeshadow I knew had been put on several days before. Bruce and Alfred \"talked it over\" in the study, and by the raised voices I heard, I knew this girl was going to have a terrible next few days. I watched her eyes flit across the room, but she still faced the floor. I said, \"D'you wanna sit down?\" I was answered with a small head shake. Tim pulled out a chair between the two of us and told her to sit anyway. She walked over and faced the table, still silent-and then I realized she couldn't talk. Tim had the same epiphany a moment later and we exchanged a glance. Alfred came in, shooting a look at us, but he didn't say anything, and Bruce stayed where he'd been all along. She was our responsibility. Makeup removed, a blanket around her shoulders, and a movie chosen by a pointing finger were our to do list. Tim stayed with the girl while I went back into the kitchen and pressured Alfred for answers. He stood at the sink, washing dishes. \"Master Jason, I only know that she is a lost soul who will be spending time here for a while. If you would, make her feel at home-I can already tell she will rival you in terms of resistance.\" \"What makes you say that?\" I asked, taking a few plates and putting them in the dishwasher. I knew even back then I was a tough kid to raise, but Alfred got by without even blinking. I still admire him for that quiet, kind strength. He shook his head and told me, \"Her name is Cassandra Cain.\" Cain-his daughter. As I walked away, I thought, This one might be my favorite yet. I'd moved back out into my own apartment after Cass got herself settled. Stephanie took my place, following Tim like a lost puppy. I'd come down to the cave for missions, she was at his computer with him. Everywhere I saw him, I assumed she followed behind-and nine out of ten times, I was right. The other one, she'd be with Cass or Bruce. Cass, who'd been Batgirl for a while under Barbie's suggestion, was Black Bat now. Steph took the mantle up, patrolled, and did a fairly good job with it. Patrols got tolerable. With Dickiebird back in town, there were six of us on the field and whatever Barbara did from the cave-traffic light hacks, security camera checks, and countless repairs to our tech. I got help when I needed it, gave it when I could-or was feeling up to the task of leaving my couch for the dark, anyway. I could have left then, gone to my own city where I would fix things up like Dick had with Bludhaven. However, I felt like the team forming around Batman should include all of the Robins-even Stephanie, who did get to try out the costume after Tim became Red Robin. Or maybe I stayed because of the boy I met only a few months later. I did a double take when I first met Damian. I'd stopped by to turn in a report to Bruce, and I saw the kid at the computer. I recognized him from my days living with Talia, but his name was never known to me-or that he was Bruce's nine year old son. His blood son. They had the same hairstyle, even. Of course, the Demon Spawn didn't get any affection from me-he spent way too much time at the Manor for that. I'd take Barbie out, Dick and I would go do something, I would let Cass crash at my place after a draining patrol. I would not deal with them all at once, however-way too much sociality and favors and \"by the way\" circumstances-like how I found out about Tim and Steph's relationship. We got along fine, him taking a lot of patrols at the borders of my territory. I knew how he felt with Talia and Bruce's influences crashing inside of him, he knew what it was like to be an outcast. Damian soon became my favorite of all my brothers-he had the sense not to kill and tell, and he didn't have that policy of Bruce's to hold him back. When Dick took his place, things changed, however. He was less of a killer and more of a fighter. I stayed farther and farther away from the Manor. He spoke less formally. I spoke less at all. Until he died, that is. Then I came straight to the Manor to catch Bruce as he fell. Looking at it now, we were all there to catch one another. To catch Alfred, even. Bruce is holding his own as Batman, Dick has returned to life as Nightwing. I'm a year older and dreaming while half asleep. Barbie is a diamond in the rough. Tim's a computer nut with the sense to stand on his own two feet when duty calls. Cass is a picture-perfect heroine, which suprised even me. Stephanie is happy at Tim's side, Batgirl and Red Robin. Dami is alive and fighting and believing he will lead our world someday-which is true, however much I hate to admit it. Another thing I hate to admit? That I have to get up and go down to the Manor for a celebration tonight. ","Summary":" Beep! Beep! Beep! Five AM means that the clock starts to scream so I can wake up.

So, I got a plot bunny and decided to make use of it. I'd like to thank JFox234 who agreed to beta-read this and make sure that I don't mangle the Batfamily, onlyindreams145 for her live action picture of Jason and Roxanne, animecolourful for her picture of Roxanne dressed up as Homura from Madoka Magica, Supremechaos918 for his dollmaker picture of Roxanne, ManyFormsLori for her picture of Roxanne and Shadow, Jazzlednightmare16 and Dark-Lina for role-playing with me (the latter who drew a picture of Roxanne as a birthday present), nightwing1975 for adding Roxanne to his collection of toons and LindaRoze for her picture of Roxanne/Shadow. Italics are flashbacks and regular is present time. If you recognize it from the Batman community, I don't own it. Roxanne practiced her moves at the Gotham Park, thankful that it was cloudy today. Both her parents were still working and the only people back at home were Roxanne's sister and her sister's boyfriend. It was a thought she didn't find enjoyable. Roxanne delivered a swift round house kick with her right leg, trying to take her mind off of what was going on at home right now. \"Nice moves,\" a voice said, distracting her. \"For a beginner.\" \"Who are you calling a beginner?\" Roxanne asked, getting her left leg ready to kick and keeping her arms in a fighting stance. \"Only ones here are the two of us,\" the boy said arrogantly. \"So, I'm guessing you.\" \"I'll have you know that I'm a—\" Roxanne began, irritated with the stranger's attitude, only to find herself looking into the eyes of a boy about her age. With jet black hair that fell into his emerald green eyes, a pretty yet strong face, bad boy clothes and a physique that an adult male model would kill for, she found herself lost for words. \"You're a what?\" he asked Roxanne, snapping her out of her daze. \"A red belt,\" she finished, turning away so he wouldn't see her blush. The boy scoffed, \"You're serious?\" \"All right,\" Roxanne told him, turning to face the boy and crossing her arms under her breasts. \"Let's see you do better.\" \"Is that a challenge?\" the boy asked with a gleam in his eye. \"Y-yeah,\" Roxanne said, straightening her hair. \"I mean, if that's how you take it.\" The boy straightened his body into a fighting stance. \"You're on.\" The boy threw a punch at her but Roxanne was quick to block it with her left forearm, her right hand waiting at her hip. Then she struck her right hand, aiming for the boy's plexus only for him to move to the right, barely grazing him. \"A reverse twist punch,\" the boy said admirably as he grabbed her wrist with his left hand. \"Not bad.\" Then the boy grabbed his left wrist, pushing Roxanne's arm backwards and walking forward, lightly pushing her on the ground. \"But I'm better,\" the boy told her smugly. \"All right, you win,\" Roxanne said, feeling ashamed. \"Congratulations.\" \"Don't put yourself down,\" the boy said, helping Roxanne up to her feet. \"You have potential, you just need to unleash it.\" \"Really?\" Roxanne said hopefully, gazing into his eyes. \"Yeah, you just need a trainer,\" the boy told her, shrugging his shoulders. \"If you want, I'd be happy to help you out...\" \"Roxanne,\" Roxanne told him, running her fingers through her hair. \"Roxanne Taylor.\" \"I'm Jason,\" the boy told him. \"Jason Todd.\" Jason Todd, where had she heard that name before? It was a common name but Roxanne remembered one particular instance where she heard it over and over. \"Do you mean Jason Todd as in Bruce Wayne's ward?\" Roxanne asked, hoping Jason wouldn't get offended if she was wrong. \"Yeah, that's me,\" Jason told her bitterly. \"And I'm guessing the Taylor stands for Tanya's sister.\" \"Yeah,\" Roxanne said bitterly. \"The Queen Bee?\" Jason asked. \"Every guy wants to date her, every girl wants to be her?\" \"Yeah, that's my sister,\" Roxanne said, feeling anger seep in her voice. \"Look, if you want a date with her, I'm afraid she's—\" \"Already taken?\" Jason said nonchalantly. \"Good, he can keep her.\" Roxanne stared at Jason like he said that the sky was green. \"You mean..\" Roxanne said, struggling to find the right words. \"You're not interested in Tanya?\" \"No, not really,\" Jason told her. \"To tell you the truth, she's not really my type.\" \"Really?\" Roxanne said excitedly. Then lowered her voice and ran her fingers through her hair. \"I mean, why's that?\" \"Let's just say that your sister's not one of my favorite people,\" Jason told her with a sly smirk. \"Great!\" Roxanne said, then lowered her voice. \"I mean, she's not one of my favorite people either.\" Roxanne felt like she was walking on air. A cute guy was talking to her who was not only skilled but also the second adopted son of Gotham's playboy billionaire, and he doesn't like Tanya! How great was that? \"So, we have that in common,\" Roxanne said, dragging her right foot on the grass. \"Well, that and we're both martial arts fans.\" \"What's your number?\" Jason asked. \"My number?\" Roxanne said, staring at Jason like he just asked her to take her clothes off. \"Yeah, that way we can get together some time and find out what else we have in common,\" Jason explained. \"Right, of course,\" Roxanne said snapping back to reality as she retrieved her purse from a nearby parking bench and got her cell phone out, reading her number out to Jason, who put it in his cell phone. \"Thanks, Roxy,\" Jason said, smiling at her. \"Thank you but could you not call me Roxy?\" Roxanne asked, slightly annoyed. \"Why, what's wrong with Roxy?\" Jason asked, looking up from his phone. \"I just don't like it,\" Roxanne said, shrugging her shoulders. \"I think it sounds cute,\" Jason told her. \"You think I'm cute?\" Roxanne said, feeling another blush as her heart pounded like a drumkit and then quickly correcting herself. \"I mean, you think it's cute?\" \"Yeah, I do,\" Jason said, smiling at her. \"Thank you,\" Roxanne said, turning away from Jason so he wouldn't see her blush. That's when she noticed the time on her phone. \"Look, I've got to get back home.\" Then quickly added so he wouldn't think that she was trying to avoid him. \"It was nice meeting you.\" \"I'll call you sometime,\" Jason told her as she left. Roxanne couldn't believe what just happened. The hottest guy she could ever imagine with amazing skills that were almost equal to Batman, not only offered to train her but gave her his number and he was Bruce Wayne's ward. Tanya would flip when she told her. Roxanne came home to see Tanya making out with Josh on the couch, keeping one eye on Roxanne as she entered the room. When Roxanne didn't even grimace, Tanya ended the lip lock with him. \"Honey, I need to talk to my little sissy. Could you wait for me upstairs?\" Tanya said in a sweet voice as Roxanne struggled to keep her lunch in her stomach. \"Sure, babe,\" Josh said, heading upstairs and gave Roxanne a slight wave. \"Roxy, I'm so sorry you had to see that,\" Tanya said in an apologetic tone that was so obviously forced through her teeth, but Roxanne still kept her smile as she went to the adjoining kitchen and opened the refrigerator door. \"I mean, considering how you feel about Josh, I thought you'd be a little more upset.\" \"It's all right, you can keep him,\" Roxanne said, wondering if she should grab the soda bottle or the beer can. \"I got a better deal.\" Tanya looked at Roxanne as if she said she knew who Batman was. \"You got a better deal?\" she repeated. \"Better than the king of Gotham High?\" \"Yep,\" Roxanne said absentmindedly, deciding on soda. \"Who would that be?\" Tanya asked, the tone of disbelief eminent in her voice. \"Have you ever heard of Jason Todd?\" Roxanne asked, twisting the cap off. \"Jason Todd? As in Bruce Wayne's ward?\" Tanya said, like she was still trying to comprehend Roxanne's happiness as she took a sip from her soda bottle. \"Yep, that's the one,\" Roxanne said, feeling herself overwhelmed with joy and not from the bubbly sweetness that ran down her throat. \"We met in the park. He sparred with me, offered to give me a few tips, called me cute.\" Roxanne blushed. \"And he asked for my number.\" Roxanne felt her heart pound and her feet felt like they were walking on air, hoping Tanya would congratulate her or at least show the same anger and jealousy that she enjoyed bringing out of Roxanne. Instead, Tanya laughed like Roxanne was a little girl telling her mother that the tooth fairy put money under her pillow. \"Roxanne, you don't have to make up stories to make yourself feel good,\" Tanya said, returning to her same fake smile. \"What do you mean?\" Roxanne said, her mood going down. \"Come on, Roxy, Jason Todd meeting you in the parking lot, calling you cute and giving you his number? Why not go the extra mile, say Robin the Boy Wonder saved you from a robbery and asked you to be his girlfriend?\" Tanya said in that fake sympathetic tone. \"Robin's a fantasy,\" Roxanne said, putting far more pride in her voice than she felt. \"Jason's the real deal!\" \"I'm sure he is,\" Tanya said in a sympathetic, yet mocking tone. \"Really, Roxy, if you were going to make up a story like that, at least use someone believable, like that zit infested creep in your science class. Though, even that might be a bit of a stretch.\" \"I'm not making this up,\" Roxanne defended weakly. \"Roxy, you're the school nobody,\" Tanya explained like she was telling a kid that Santa Claus doesn't exist. \"The social outcast, the zero. Inventing stories about Bruce Wayne's ward taking an interest in you isn't going to help you climb the social ladder.\" \"I'm telling the truth!\" Roxanne said, feeling the anger seep in her voice. \"Jason gave me his number and he's going to call me! He even told me that you weren't his type.\" Roxanne didn't turn her eyes away from Tanya, watching for any signs of anger. \"So, do you have his number?\" Tanya asked, running her fingers through her beach blonde hair. \"Number?\" Roxanne asked, caught off guard. \"If Jason Todd has your number then you must have his,\" Tanya said, like she was explaining that the sky was blue. \"Actually, I kind of forgot to ask,\" Roxanne said sheepishly, unable to look Tanya in the eye. Tanya put her arm on Roxanne's shoulder. \"I'm sure you did,\" she said with that same fake sympathy and then removed her hand off of Roxanne's shoulder, making her way out of the kitchen but not before turning to face Roxanne. \"Now, if you excuse me, I have a real boyfriend who wants my attention, but have fun with your little fantasy.\" Then Tanya finally left, leaving Roxanne alone with her thoughts. So much for impressing her sister, but maybe Tanya would change her tune when Jason called, if he called. Well, he did ask for her number and offered to train her. Why wouldn't he call. Maybe Jason only saw her as a potential friend, someone to hang out with when he was bored, but he did call her cute. Okay, he said that name Roxy was cute but still. Maybe he was bored and decided to lead on the school outcast just to get a good laugh. Roxanne heard stories about some of Josh's friends sleeping with outcasts and then denying that they even knew them. Maybe it was a ploy to get closer to Tanya. Wouldn't be the first time a guy walked up to her and pretended to be interested only for them to ask about her sister. Sometimes Tanya was the mastermind behind these plans. Though a small part of Roxanne couldn't help but think that maybe Jason was telling the truth. Maybe he wasn't interested in Tanya at all. All Roxanne could do was wait for Jason to call and find out. It would really be something, Roxanne thought. If the school bad boy and the school outcast got together. Roxanne put the soda bottle back in the fridge and grabbed the beer can. Roxanne rubbed sun block on her porcelain skin from inside her car, her sky blue eyes shielded by the sun with a pair of dark sunglasses. She put the sun block in her purse, took her sunhat off the passenger's seat and stepped out of the car, putting it on top of her long straight raven black hair with a blood red streak that stopped at her shoulder blades with the wind blowing a few strands blowing it front of her oval shaped face. A light pink UV shirt with a dark pink sweater tied on as well as light blue skinny jeans and a pair of dark blue stiletto heels protecting Roxanne's skin from the sun. She set the boxed cake down and fetched some digging tools, making her way to Jason Todd's grave. \"Hey, Jason, me again and on your birthday,\" Roxanne said, digging in the grave. \"I managed to get your favorite cake. Don't worry, I didn't make it. Even dead, it seems cruel to give you my cooking. Though you were the only one who could stand it.\" As soon as the hole was big enough, Roxanne set the cake inside and went to work burying it. \"Happy Birthday, Jason,\" Roxanne said with a smile. \"By the way, you would not believe the commotion I came across. You know my sister Tanya? Well, a waitress delivered coffee to her at a cafe and she's screaming about how she wanted Decaf and the whole cafe heard it. Someone took a video of it and posted it on YouTube as White Trashed Housewife Screams at Poor Working Girl. Though, I'll admit, I do feel sorry for the waitress and it does make me embarrassed to be related to her.\" Roxanne flattened the ground, covering the cake with a smile. \"Okay, you have to admit, there's something satisfying about the former Queen Bee becoming the YouTube laughing stock. It just goes to show that you were right. As soon as we got out of high school, Tanya had no power over me. I mean, she's married to Josh, who's got a job as a fry cook now, and I'm a former cop turned children's martial arts teacher.\" Roxanne smiled as she imagined how Jason would respond. \"Yeah, I don't know what I ever saw in him either. Can't help thinking I dodged a bullet on that one.\" Then she lowered her voice to a whisper. \"Look, Jason, this is the last time I can come see you. I can't say much because I don't know where Bruce's cameras are hidden, but I can tell you that tonight is the night. I can't tell you what my plan is, but, in order for it to work, it has to appear that I've moved on.\" Roxanne felt tears form in her eyes but she would not let them fall. \"Good-bye, Jason.\" Roxanne was about to leave until she heard a familiar voice. \"Ms. Taylor?\" Roxanne turned around to see an elderly well-dressed man. \"Hi, Alfred!\" she said cheerfully, waving at him with her right hand while holding her hat in place with her left. \"I see you're still mourning Master Todd,\" Alfred observed sadly. \"Yeah, for like the last time,\" Roxanne said with a gleeful smile. \"Then I'm totally starting my new life.\" \"What new life would that be?\" Alfred asked curiously. \"I got a new job!\" Roxanne told him excitedly, forgetting to keep her hat in place as the wind blew it off. \"Oops.\" Alfred picked up her hat that landed on his feet and quickly gave it to Roxanne. \"Thanks, Alfred,\" Roxanne said, taking the hat from him and quickly placing it back on her head. \"Considering your condition, I would think that you would be more careful about such things,\" Alfred told Roxanne like he just caught her running around with scissors. \"Alfred, I don't need a lecture,\" Roxanne said exasperated. \"I get enough of those from my mom.\" \"Maybe one day you'll listen to them,\" Alfred said sardonically. \"So, what is this new job of yours? I do hope it's indoors.\" \"You're looking at the new karate children's teacher over at the Gotham Dojo!\" Roxanne said excitedly. \"Not as great as being a cop, but there's a certain rewarding aspect to it.\" \"I'm happy to see that you're finally moving on,\" Alfred told her sympathetically. \"Thank you,\" Roxanne said. \"Hey, is Bruce around?\" \"Yes, but I'm afraid Master Wayne's rather busy at the moment,\" Alfred said, with only a slight hint about what sort of business Bruce was up to. \"Well, tell him that I like totally forgive him,\" Roxanne said and then added. \"And I'm sorry for how I acted in the past five years.\" \"I'm sure Master Wayne will be delighted to hear it,\" Alfred said. \"Thank you, Alfred,\" Roxanne said, making her way to the gate. \"I've got to go, it was nice talking to you.\" \"You're always welcome at Wayne Manor, Ms. Taylor.\" Roxanne went to her car and drove off. She'd be welcome until Bruce discovered her plan, which would be inevitable. Roxanne went back to her apartment to be greeted by Chris Patel gazing at his brown eyes and oval shaped face in the living room mirror with his jet black hair slicked back, dressed in Armani tight enough to show his athletic build and spraying a cologne on his toffee skin that's earthy scent reminded Roxanne of Poison Ivy's pheromones from her Gotham City Police days. Being friends with the commissioner's daughter had its benefits. \"So, be honest,\" Chris asked, turning to face her gleefully. \"What do you think?\" \"Looks great,\" Roxanne said absentmindedly as she pulled a key out of her purse. \"Like an Indian Don Draper.\" \"Thanks, that's what I was going for,\" Chris said as Roxanne put her purse on the coffee table and unlocked the living room closet door. \"So, who's the lucky guy?\" Roxanne asked, taking her outfit off of the hangar. \"His name's Tom,\" Chris said, combing his hair. \"I met him at the grocery store.\" \"And now you're taking him out,\" Roxanne said, going to her room and kicking her dark blue stilettos off. \"I'll be taking out a few people myself tonight, but not in the same way.\" \"Oh, right,\" Chris said downfallen. \"Look, about this plan of yours.\" \"What plan?\" Roxanne asked innocently, taking off her hat and sunglasses and putting them on the dresser. \"Just the one you've been talking about for months,\" Chris told her sarcastically as Roxanne rolled down the sleeves of her pink sweater and untied the bottom part, letting it drop to the floor. \"It's about you lurking in the shadows to get revenge for your long dead boyfriend.\" \"You mean justice,\" Roxanne said matter-of-factly, unbuttoning her light blue skinny jeans and letting them drop to the floor. \"The kind Batman refuses to give.\" \"I don't know if I'd put it that way,\" Chris told her as Roxanne removed her sapphire earrings and necklace, placing them on her dresser. \"Then how would you put it?\" Roxanne said, taking her light pink t-shirt off and throwing it on the floor. \"I just think that you're going about this the wrong way,\" Chris said as Roxanne went to her adjoining bathroom and took eye makeup remover from the cabinet, pouring some of it on a cotton ball. \"Maybe, instead of pretending to move on, you should really move on.\" Roxanne took the ball and used it to rub her pink eye shadow off. \"Maybe with that guy you're dating, William.\" \"William's boring,\" Roxanne said, turning on the sink and washing her light pink blush off. \"The only reason I'm dating him is because he's got the same color eyes as Jason.\" \"Okay, maybe not William,\" Chris said, trying to salvage the conversation as Roxanne turned off the sink rubbed her ruby red lipstick off. \"But, maybe there are other guys out there, one that might help you forget Jason.\" \"First my mom, then Alfred and now you,\" Roxanne said, putting on a pair of leather pants that outlined her generous curves. \"People really love getting involved in my personal life.\" \"And all because we care,\" Chris said sarcastically as Roxanne donned a black leather shirt that outlined her well-endowed chest and cut off midriff. \"Shame on us.\" \"I seem to recall you saying that you'd support me in this,\" Roxanne said, putting her black leather eye mask on. \"I said I'd support you, not that I'd approve of it,\" Chris corrected as Roxanne put her flat heeled black boots on. \"What's the difference?\" Roxanne asked as put her black flat heeled boots on. \"If I approved, I wouldn't think that you were making a decision rooted in grief and anger,\" Chris explained as Roxanne put her black leather biker gloves on. \"Save your psychoanalysis for your patients,\" Roxanne said, tying her hair into a ponytail. Roxanne ripped the three nicotine patches off of her left arm and threw them in the garbage. Then she left the bathroom and took the white box from her dresser, looking inside to find a promise ring she couldn't bring herself to throw away and read the engraving inside, \"I will always find you.\" Roxanne put the ring on her finger, feeling her throat get stuffed up as she went to the living room. \"So, how I do look?\" Roxanne asked. Chris looked at Roxanne like he was looking at a complete stranger. \"Roxanne, is that you?\" \"Yeah, it's me,\" Roxanne said proudly. \"Again, I ask. How do I look?\" \"You look like the new terror of Gotham,\" Chris said, looking like he was still recovering from shock. \"Thank you,\" Roxanne said as she unlocked the closet door. \"Though I still haven't figured out a name for myself yet.\" \"I'm sure it'll come to you,\" Chris told her encouragingly. Roxanne scanned all of her swords in the armory. So many swords to choose from and so little time. She had everything from katanas, to medieval swords and even some tiny ones for fencing. Roxanne recalled visiting different weapons shops in Gotham, buying two swords from each one every month for a year to obtain this collection. She took a couple of katanas and left the armory, shutting the door and locking it while pulling out the key. \"Do me a favor before you go,\" Roxanne said, tossing the key to Chris. \"Lock this in my strong box.\" \"Sure,\" Chris said, staring dumbfound at the key in his hand. \"Roxanne, are you sure you're ready for this?\" \"As ready as I'll ever be.\" A/N: So, what do you think? I know Roxanne seems a little shallow in this chapter but many relationships start out for shallow reasons and then get deeper through time. I took the thing with the cake from The Sopranos and I Will Always Find You from Once Upon A Time, though that show didn't really invent the concept. Don Draper belongs to Mad Men, in case you haven't seen that show. Also, that was a reverse twist punch I described and it's quite a common technique for red belts, which is very advanced in martial arts. Though, for someone like Jason, might be considered an amateur move. Which is why he used a shoulder lock that I discovered through YouTube. Anyway, here's one of my last three fanfictions. I'll post Without You as soon as I beat all the games in the Batman: Arkham Series as well as read all of the extra material for it. Right now, I'm trying to get past Joker's snipers in Arkham City. I also have a Batman/Lost crossover idea that I can't get out of my head. It's about Jason and Roxanne being on Oceanic Flight 815 and crashing on the island with the characters in the show. Just so you know, my main priority will be my original fiction and fulfilling my dream of becoming a published writer. I hope those of you who follow my fanfics will also follow my original fiction. Since Return of the Greek Gods and Fairy Tale Warriors are technically fanfiction, I can post them on here. Feel free to check them out.

Jason silently creeped around the docks. He, as the Red Hood, had gathered information about a new child transfer gang. Jason growled: \"These assholes!\" Quickly he dropped down to where the dealers had placed the orphans they kidnapped. Jason cut the ropes and grabbed guns, turning around to face the dealers. \"Game over!\", he growled. Rico, the leader of the gang, laughed:\" Yes, for ou, Red Riding Hood.\" Suddenly Jason heard a hiss behind him. In a flash he turned around and saw … a black mamba in front of him. The snake charged towards him and in the next moment he felt poison spreading through his blood. Red Hood growled once again while shooting his grappling gun, flying to the next building. He felt his conscious fading and hoped he would still make it to the apartment. Only when he climbed over a fence, he got aware of his surroundings again. \"Why am I at the fucking Wayne Manor?\", he asked again, before finally losing his consciousness fully. \"What hurts more, forehand or backhand?\", the Joker laughed. Robin hissed as the as the crowbar broke two of his ribs. The Joker laughed again and said:\" I have to go now. Be a good boy, do your homework and be in bed at nine. I'll tell your daddy bats you love him, but I don't know if he cares.\", and he shut the door after him. Jason crawled to the door slowly, leaving a trail of blood behind. LOCKED!

Grayson x Todd. Yaoi, boy x boy. Rated T; don't like, don't read then! Pairing: Dick Grayson x Jason Todd Rated: T for yaoi (boy x boy), kissing, and some cussing. Disclaimer: None of the characters from Batman belong to me. Note: Let me just say for starters that I am in love with Grayson and Todd, they are just so cute. Grayson with his heroines and Todd with his looks, his sarcasm, and his voice! Seriously Jensen Ankles did such an amazing job as his voice actor. And I'm pretty sure you noticed I listed a lot more about Todd then Grayson, isn't it just easy to fall in love with the bad guys? And the Red-hood is one of my favorite movies. Then I noticed how Grayson and Todd looked cute together and I have read some stories on Fanfic, but I wish there was more. And then I thought \"Hey, why don't I make one?\" So I did, but I want to write a lemon with them. I felt like there was no room in this story for one, but we will see how things go. So please, I hope you like my Grayson x Todd fanfic! Enjoy! The Relationship We Have Grayson stretched out, hearing his back pop in the process; he felt so old despite his youth. He let out a sigh of relief before resting back down, popping his knuckles to go with it. He and Bruce just came back from patrolling the night streets of Gotham and who did they happen to see? The RedHood, causing trouble as always. According to Bruce he was nothing but a criminal himself, running around like he was above the law. In truth Grayson actually believed in his method. He wasn't saying he agreed with them, but with crime being controlled the way it was, wasn't it a good thing? He was only punishing the criminals and wasn't that what they were trying to do? To him it sounded the same, but he would never admit that to Bruce, not if he wanted to live that is. Grayson did the last of his stretching, liberating a sigh of relief before throwing on his dark-blue t-shirt. He was actually glad the night was over, he needed a break. Not that he minded guarding the town, since that was a hero's duty, he just needed a break here and there. \"Are you feeling alright, Master Grayson?\" Alfred asked, handling a tray with water on it. The boy took it thankfully, \"Yeah Alfred, just ready to call it a night.\" \"I hope not,\" came a voice. Bruce stepped out of his weapon room, walking over to his computer, still wearing his batman suit, \"It's a big night tonight.\" Grayson nodded, taking a gulp of his water, \"Shouldn't you be getting dressed?\" \"I could say the same to you,\" Bruce countered. He noticed his old sidekick in normal attire and nothing ceremonial; definitely not something to wear to an award show. \"Are you going somewhere?\" \"Just for a little,\" Nightwing replied, before passing Alfred back the empty glass. He pulled out his jacket before stuffing his suit into his bag and putting it on. Bruce was a little curious, but trusted him down the very core; he knew how liable his first sidekick was. Besides he never said anything about not having a life. \"Are you going to make it in time?\" Grayson nodded, \"Of course.\" \"May I ask where you are going?\" Batman asked, shutting down his computer. He thought it was best to start getting dressed too. Nightwing pulled his bag over his shoulder, \"Just out. Going to meet a friend.\" \"A friend?\" Alfred asked, indicating to Bruce that his \" friend\" , might be a girl and this girl may happened to be more than just his \" friend\" . Bruce couldn't hold back his chuckle before asking, \"Are you sure you're going to make it? You only have an hour...\" \"I will, I will,\" Grayson replied with a wave of his hand. He knew this night meant a lot to his partner, he wasn't a jerk to just bail on him...despite how much he'd rather spend time with his \"friend\" . \"I'll meet you at the door. I promise.\" Bruce and Alfred looked at one another, thinking this \" friend\" of his must be pretty extraordinary. None the less, they (more like Bruce) stopped holding him up and let him go. He left the bat-cave, said goodbye and left the Wayne Manor. He dropped his bag off and using his astonishing acrobat talents, he ran across the Gotham rooftops, the night breeze cool on his attractive face. He landed on the right rooftop, the place where he was supposed to meet his \"friend\" . Grayson leaned on his crossed arms on the railing, smiling as he stared down at the streets of Gotham. Surprisingly the city was peaceful despite the uproar that happened moments ago; that bastard always had new tricks up his sleeve. \"Hey there dickie-bird,\" a voice cooed. Speak of the devil... Nightwing turned around, a hand still on the rail, \"I told you to stop calling me that.\" \"Sorry,\" the other robin replied, sarcasm in his tone, \"Always slips my mind.\" Grayson noticed Jason rubbing his chin, a smile spread on his face as he crossed his arms, \"Still hurt?\" \"Ya think?\" Jason answered, \"So much for going easy on me, huh?\" \"Sorry, sometimes I don't know my own strength,\" he replied. Jason smiled at his brother before walking over and placing a kiss on his waiting lips, \"Nice performance tonight Nightwing.\" Said boy returned the caress, his hands holding onto the arms around his neck, \"You did pretty well yourself RedHood.\" Dick tangled his lips with his adversaries once more, obliging happily when his tongue snaked into his mouth. The protector of the night was romantically involved with the enemy of Gotham and the sad part? He loved every minute of it. Another sad fact was Bruce not knowing, but how was he supposed to tell him? \" Hey Bruce, you know the RedHood? The guy who's trying to make Gotham better with guns and stuff? Well we've sort of been going out, just letting you know.\" Of course there was a better way to phrase it but either way it was something the Dark Knight definitely wouldn't want to hear. Even he hated how he got sucked into this spot as being the RedHood's lover, but Jason was just...wonderful despite his evil little skems. And although Jason loved to admit how he had fallen in love with his bird, Grayson still found it unbelievable the same had happened to him. Jason kissed his hero one last time before grinning, \"Have I ever told you have sexy your blue eyes are?\" Dick smiled and patted his arms, \"Only a million times.\" He slipped through the embrace, walking over to the opposite rail and sitting down, \"Sorry about that kick, again.\" \"Hey no sweat,\" Todd replied, \"You've hit me a lot harder before.\" The other robin chuckled, \"Bruce says you're getting creative lately.\" Jason couldn't help but smile and shrug his broad shoulders before shoving his hands deep into his jeans pocket, \"Glad to know the old man still notices my talents.\" Nightwing looked over the city before replying, \"You still could have gone easy though.\" \"Relax dickie,\" Jason cooed, \"A few people may have gotten hurt but Batman and his trusty sidekick were there to save the day.\" The RedHood walked over to his opponent, his hands on the rail on either side of his hips to trap his little bird. Grayson looked at him, his pretty green eyes behind his mask. The way his black turtle neck outlined his toned body was incredibly hard to not look at along with his little jacket making him sexier than the average teen. It was a crime to fall in-love with the enemy, a horrible taboo, but for the both of them it was a world of excitement and pleasure. \"I can tell how much you want me right now dickie-bird,\" Jason spoke, his tone teasing and his hands on his lover's hips. Dick smiled before wrapping his hand on the front of his shirt, pulling his villain closer, \"Maybe I do.\" \"Then where should we start?\" Jason asked, kissing the hero's neck, and moving Grayson's arms to wrap around his neck. \"I can take you here...\" Wrapping Grayson's legs around his waist, Jason moved the couple to the wall, pinning the figure down using his own body. He tangled their hands together, bringing them next to Grayson's head, \"Or I can fuck you on this wall. Honestly I like both ideas.\" \"Is it always sex with you?\" Nightwing said, trying to ignore the sudden chills of enthusiasm running through his frame from the position he was in. He felt so vulnerable against the wall with his legs wrapped around his nemesis; not that he was complaining though. \"Hey, I'm just trying to give you what you want,\" Jason answered, bringing their linked hands higher above the boy's head, \"And that's me stuffed up that cute little, tight ass of yours.\" Jason emphasized his point by thrusting up his hips, making Grayson groan. There was nothing more than Dick wanted then to spend time with his lover, but he remembered what Bruce said before he left. \"I can't,\" he replied, again groaning from another bump of the RedHood's hips, \"I just came to say hi.\" He attempted to get down, but Jason held him still, \"You just came to tease? That's cruel dickie-bird.\" The RedHood leaned forward, burying his face into the crook of Nightwing's neck. He smoothly rubbed his lip against the skin, leaving kisses here and there. He heard Grayson release a sigh, smiling to himself. \"And you say I'm teasing?\" Dick said, squirming a bit, \"Now who's being cruel?\" \"It's what I do,\" Jason smiled against his neck before kissing it again, \"I am a villain after all.\" Dick could feel the tiny sensations swimming through him, making him want more and more to be taken on this rooftop, but at the pace Todd was going, they wouldn't have even gotten started when it was time for the award show. Grayson ignored another roll of hips, not caring if his groan was heard. Todd was so convincing when it came to this subject, but this time he just couldn't let him win, \"Really Jason, I gotta be leaving soon.\" The RedHood stopped his assault, looking into his bird's blue eyes, \"Have I ever told you how crazy those blue eyes make me?\" Nightwing gave him a sarcastic smile, \"All the time.\" He unlaced their lands, pushing at the wall of his lover's well-built chest. Jason released him this time, already knowing it wasn't going to be easy getting rid of his little problem. \"You owe me for this dickie-bird.\" Said boy turned around, \"You can have me anyway you want later. You know Bruce's award show is tonight.\" Jason stopped his flood of images of how to handle the hero tonight, remembering that was in fact true. \"Are you going to go?\" Grayson asked. Jason thought, shoving a hand into his back pocket and running a hand through his dark hair, \"I might make an appearance.\" Nightwing frowned, hoping his favorite villain would go. He walked back over to him, placing his hands on his waist, looking into his emerald eyes, \"It would mean a lot to him, you know.\" Jason smiled to his cute acting, thinking there really was nothing from stopping him from fucking his bird's brains out, \"Cause nothing says I love you more, then your enemy showing up to your award show. I won't try to make a mess, but I can't say anything won't happen to that hero, Nightwing. The RedHood seems to be fixated on him for some reason.\" Grayson smiled, \"I'm sure Nightwing can handle himself. You aren't going to push him into a bathroom stall again are you?\" \"If that's what he begs for,\" Jason replied, licking his lips slightly, before moving in closer so their lips were mere centimeters apart. \"I won't be begging,\" he replied, before kissing him, a sweet little caress, \"See you tonight?\" The RedHood gave a nod, before returning Nightwing's second kiss, \"I'll go see what new toys I might have.\" He gave him a third kiss before walking over to the edge of the roof and dropping down, landing on his feet like the feline he was. Grayson stood there for a moment. The relationship they had was definitely like nothing even seen before. The press would be all over him if they found out the hero and villain of Gotham were dating. He couldn't even image their reactions and definitely not Bruce's. Was it wrong? Was it immoral? Was it a taboo? He already knew the answers to those questions, but the relationship they had was just...amazing. I thought this story came out cute. It was fun to play with Todd's personality since it's so funny and just down right sexy. Its actually really short and really only took me about 2 hours to finish. I still want to do that lemon, so maybe I will, but we shall see! Who knows, maybe that bathroom scene would make a great lemon. I hope you guys enjoyed my mini Grayson x Todd story.

I own nothing but my OC. The rain hammered down on the roof of the 10-year oldbuilding. The light of the dim sky swallowed the darkness, an ashen sky appearing. Thunder rolled, and a streak of lightning flashed across the sky in a split second. The wind moaned as it took its stroll across the city, sending shivers down the spines of unprotected civilians walking down the streets of Gotham. The city traffic still lingered, the violent honks and shouts of drivers were sent through the air. Rora shook her head in disappointment watching the city as the rain pounded down on it. It was the reason she left. She thought that Star City would give her a fresh start; no place where people dress up and battle. But to her surprise, Star City was just as violent. People still dressed up in costumes, stopping crime. In Gotham, the same thing happened over and over again; a villain escapes, the Batman and Robin come, and they throw him/her in prison or Arkham Asylum. She never understood the way they did it. Villians would always escape, and take so many lives away. Killing the criminal always roamed in her mind. To stop them once and for all so no one else would be hurt. The heroes never did that. Killing the villain seemed to be the only solution to Rora. She wouldn't throw them in prison just so they could escape again. The hatred she felt for Gotham City reminded her that she once was happy. She remembered when positive thoughts seemed to pop in her mind. Jason. He changed everything. Jason was hot tempered, but would always calm when Rora listened to him and talked him through. The thought of the boy made tears threaten to fall from her green eyes. Jason knew what to say most of the time. They would argue sometimes, but would forgive each other later on. But then the night happened. Seeing his body lifeless made her think. He did this. The villain who was Batman's greatest foe. Rora pictured the horrid smile; his decaying yellow teeth wide, his blood red lips across his face. She clenched her fist. The night the Joker killed Jason, was the night she changed. Her positive thoughts melted away, letting in the anger and hatred. Suddenly, tears streamed down her face, and she fell to the ground on her knees. Why? Why did it have to be Jason? Rora covered her face with her stone cold hands, tears running down her chin, dripping onto the wooden floor below. \"I... Will... get him, Jason... I will...\" she sobbed, her tears still forming, yet her lush eyes sparked with fury, and her fist clenched the floor. \"For you... Love..\"[Chapter 2] I do not own Batman, nor will I ever. In this story, I would say that Jason and Rora are both 19. I don't know Jason's age, and I'll try to find out. If you guys know, please tell me. Thanks :3. And also, thanks for the nice reveiws! I greatly appreciate them! Sorry that this chapter took so long! Also, some of the dialogue in the movie might not be exactly accurate. Revenge. The word soared through Rora's mind. Revenge? Rora sounded unsure, but she knew she wanted it. Jason was the most important person in her life, and the bastard clown took him from her. A few weeks after her parents' divorce, she met him. He was a stubborn and hot-headed boy, but seemed nice enough to talk to her. After a few monthes, they had became friends and Rora realized that he understood her. Her world lit up when Jason became a very close friend. He was the first person to strain a smile from her. Whenever Rora was with Jason, she never had to worry about her horrid mother and new step-father. A few weeks later, she developed a huge crush on him. He flirted with her every once in a while, but seemed a bit unsure whether it was right or not. One night, when he walked her home, they bothed admitted their feelings, and became a couple. The world was so different when he was in her life. Now that he was gone, the world became a lonely place for her again. Getting revenge on his killer would let her sleep better at night. And the Joker would never be able to hurt anyone again. Gotham City's buildings and skyscrapers lit up the night. Though the darkness in the streets still lurked. It was a busy night for everyone; a GCPD blimp searched the city and people shouted at each other in the highway. \"Then who's party is this?\" A man said across the wooden circle-shaped table. \"I thought it was you East-side losers. You already rolled over for the Black Mask so I figured you were already gonna ask us in.\" Another replied. \"Rolled over? The Mask wiped six of my crew in a month! SIX!\" Gotham's drug lords sat in an abandoned warehouse, a dim light hanging over the table. \"Some of my best people..\" the deep voiced man murmured. A blonde-haired man spoke. \"So you set up this meet?\" \"Nah, I thought it was Chi-Chi.\" Chi Chi shrugged. \"Wasn't my meet.\" \"The hell with this. I'm goin'. You brain doners wanna hang aroun-\" \"Sit down, Freddy.\" A voice came from above. The men and women looked up. A figure stood there. \"It's my meeting.\" the figure said. \"It's him.\" one said. \"Batman?\" another questioned. \"We didn't do nothin.\" The figure cameout from the shadows, revealing a man wearing a red mask and holding a gun. \"Well, we all know that's a lie.\" he joked. \"Who the hell are you?\" Chi Chi asked, many of them pulling out their own weapons. \"Smoke him!\" the blonde man commanded. The man in the mask began shooting his gun down the table, the drug dealers ducking and covering. \"I said sit down. \" the mask man repeated. \"You wanna DIE!? There's easier ways to kill yourself!\" \"Ya. Like yelling at the guy who's holding the AK-47. Listen to me you drug-dwelling scumbags, I will be running the drug trade from now on. You eight of the prospered street dealers in Gotham, I'm offering you more on the deal. You go about your business as usual, kick up 40 percent to me. That's a much sweeter deal than the scraps Black Mask is leaving you.\" \"In return, you will have total protection from both Black Mask and Batman. But you stay away from kids and school yards. No dealing to children, got it? If you do, you're dead .\" \"Okay, crazy man, this is all very generous, but why in the hell should we listen to you?\" the blonde asked. The masked man dropped a large duffle bag on the table, startling some of the criminals. The blonde looked to a woman, and then began opening the bag. Chi Chi puked under the table. \"Damn.\" Tyler said. \"Those are the heads of all your lutentiants. That took me two hours.\" The man re-loaded his gun. \"You wanna see what I can get done in a whole evening? Make no mistake. I'm not asking you to kick in with me. I'm telling you. \" He fired again. When the men and women looked up, he was gone. \"40 perent works for me. \" ","Summary":" I do not own Batman, nor will I ever. I own nothing but my OC.

And what does this girl know about the Red Sands REZ? Chap.1: Meeting a Wolf Its at the Apache barrel ground after the fight. A young girl riding a black horse road up to the guys and fell off her horse. It was obvious that she was paying attention when the horse got spooked by the the group then desided to run. The horse ran back the way it came. When the girl sat up, Dave got off his horse and went to help her. When he got close to her she backed up. \"Hey its alright I wanna help ya.\" He said calmly. He seemed more than a little too eager to help. However, the girl smiled at him anyway, but before he could help a howl rang throw the air. Then form behind the same rocks another girl came on horse back. Only she was charging. The warmblood she was riding ran off the colossal rocks like it was in a flat meadow. Dave turned around to help the girl thinking her pal would stop and watch. As usual Dave was wrong. The horse ran towards them and barely miss them. The rider however didn't. As soon as the horse was a few feet form them she lept off attacking Dave. As the two stopped rolling on the ground and stood to face each other, the careless young girl shouted to her freind \"Chels No!\" Her call fell on deaf ears. Her friend stood straight a head and growled menacingly at Dave. Not one of the boys moved. They could not take their eyes away from the sence. It was unbelievable this young woman came from out of no where and was growling at Dave. \"Chels stop it he was trying to help me!\" The girl shouted as she ran towards her friend. As she got to her friend she grabbed her arm and held it tight. \"He was trying to help me. I fell off Cinder because I wasn't watching where I was going. Cinder reared up when we got to close. I fall and he came to help me. That's all.\" She said pleading with her friend. She looked to Dave for assistance. He caught it. \"Yea that was my only intention, miss. I meant her no harm.\" He said raising his arms in defeat. She girl stopped growling and took a step forward. \"Forgive me, I am not fond of strangers. Especially men.\" She said with a sigh raising her hand for a hand shake. \"Yea I got that.\" Dave said lightly shaking her hand. The girl let out a shrike as she turned back to face her friend. In an instent she crouched down in pain, holding her back. \"Chels are you ok?\" Her friend rushed to her side. \"I'm alright just pulled a muscle.\" She said dryly getting up. \"Hou, hou ,houuu!\" She howled. Looking to the rocks. \"Iyi!\" shouted back. Then a young Apache man came running to them. \"Wolf Chels! Spirit and Cinder come back.\" He said in poor English. She nodded and howled again. The warmblood came trotting back over to her. In her haist when she tried to jump on a sharp pain went through her back and she fell to the earth. \"Chels!\" The man and young girl yelled in union rushing to her aid. As they helped her on to the horse and girl spoke. \"A pulled muscle in her back.\" She said bluntly to him. The young Apache nodded. \"Get her to Jane's. I get Cinder.\" He said running back to the rocks then returning with the black horse. \"Thank you.\" The girl said as he helped her on. The man nodded and looked to Chels. She smiled at him and reached out her hand to ruffle fine his hair. He smiled back and fixed his hair. \"I'll pay my respects to the dead later.\" She said. Then he patted her leg, eyed the boys and ran off. \"Come we need to get to Jane's before night.\" She said turning to her friend and heading off. \"I'm sorry for the trouble.\" She said waving her hand to the boys. All without even turning her head. \"Wait!\" Said the youngest of the boys riding up to her. She stopped and turned her horse to face him. \"I wanted to thank you, for the bread you gave me. A few weeks ago.\" She gave a nod and said \"Your welcome.\" She was about to turn when the boy spoke again. \" Why don't we go together. We're going to White Oaks.\" He said a bit shaky. \"I don't travel with people I don't know.\" She stated bluntly. \"I'm The Prince of Pennsylvania.\" He said a bit cocky with a boyish smirk. The girl obviously knew he was joking so she smiled. \"Well Mister Prince, it's a nice offer but we already lied to Sheriff Garrett about which way we heard you guys were going. Traveling with Billy The Kid and his gang would just make the lie all the worse.\" She said passing him and riding straight up to Billy. \"Right Mister Billy?\" She said looking Billy straight in the eye. Billy smiled. She had some pluck, he'd give her that. \"Sounds about right to me.\" He said back to her. She just raised an eyebrow at him and turned around and started to trot a way. \"Chels wait! How did you notice it was him?\" Her friend yelled riding up to her. She didn't answer just stopped and turned herself to see the boys. She noticed Dave had gotten back on his horse. \"My names Chelsea Wolf! Harry up boys or you'll get left behind!\" She yelled to the boys. \"Wow she is one piece a work isn't she?\" Said Henry, the farmer. Chavez smiled he liked this young girl. It was obvious she relied on her instincts and she had a great deal of respect towards Native American Culture. Doc smiled and nodded at Henry question anf puzzled look. \"Alright Gang you heard the lady lets skin-out. \"Billy said adding his unique laugh. As the boys all road up to Chelsea, her friend turned back to them and said \"Oh my names Aryn.\" She said happily. \"Nice to meet you.\" Doc replied. My name is Josiah Gordon 'Doc' Scurlock or Doc for short. And this is William H. Bonney, Billy or 'Billy The Kid'. Arkansa Dave Rudabaugh Las Vegas, Dave. Hendry William French. Tom O'Folliad or the Prince of Pennsylvania,\" he added with a laugh. \"And Jose Chavez y Chavez or Chavez.\" He said introducing the boys who gave a court nod at thier names. As the group formed the leader wasn't looking as fit. \"Chels are you ok?\" Aryn asked. No answer. Chelsea had her head down and her long brown-reddish-golden hair was covering her face. Aryn spoke more clearly. \"Chels are you alright?\" Still no answer from her friend. Aryn guessed that she was tired so she didn't want to move or say anything. The girl got like that sometimes. After riding a little farther Chelsea's horse stopped. Like a domino effect everyone stopped as well. \"Chels what's..\" Before Aryn could finish her sentence Chelsea fell off her horse. As Aryn tried to get down, the panic made her clumsy, Chavez didn't have any problem. He ran and pick up Chelsea looking at her over to see what was wrong. As he felt down her back, there was a moan of pain. He rubbed her back in the spot and she made more painful moans. When Aryn finally got to them, she asked \"What happened?\" Chavez didn't look up. \"Strained back. Probably when she attacked Dave then collapse from what I don't know.\" He answered. \"Oh no. Well Chels has been stressed. What do we do?\" Aryn asked. \"Nothing it must heal on its own, but she must not move around. She'll wake up after she's rested.\" Doc stated giving back on to his horse. \"But how will she ride then?\" Aryn asked again still showing signs of panicking. \" She must be carried.\" Chavez said picking her up bridal style. \"But Spirit won't let her ride another horse, let alone in the arms of a stranger.\" She stated. \"Then I'll ride him.\" Chavez said putting her on the back of her saddle. \"No, he won't let anyone else ride him.\" Aryn said trying to help explain the seriousness of the situation. \"Well Spirit will get have to go with it if he's wants his master alright again.\" Chavez said tying the rains of his horse to a rope and attaching the rope to Chelsea's saddle. \"Ok then but if you get killed its not my fault.\" Aryn said getting back on to her horse. Chavez went face to face with Spirit, as the stallion just stood there. \"Look if you want your master to be safe let me ride you. Please Spirit.\" Chavez said truthfully. The stallion stood there for a moment then turned and walked forward showing its back to him. Chavez smiled and got on. While grabbing Chelsea and setting her on his lap. \"Lets go.\" Chavez said a bit coldly. So they started up again. \"Wow it took me weeks for the horse to even let me touch it. Lead alone ride. You must have something in common with Chels.\" Aryn said admiring him. Chavez just looked at the sleeping girl in his arms. There was something about her that interested him. By the time they reached White Oaks it would be only a few more hours until night. Jane was happy to Billy and even more so to see Chelsea. Especially that Chavez was carrying her. As everyone piled in to the solon, Jane had Chavez take Chelsea to an extra spare room. It was at the top of the house. Nothing much but it was just right for someone who was ill. A queen size bed, a few chairs, a table, a bed side table with a lamp and a small dresser with a vanity on the side. While everyone was down stairs talking; Aryn, Jane and Chavez helped Chelsea. While Aryn explained to Jane what happened, Chavez brought in all of Chelsea's stuff in her new room. Once Aryn and Jane had organized all of Chelsea's things, they headed down stairs to go mingle with the others. Leaving Chavez to tend to Chelsea. Chavez was puzzled by this girl. How did a white girl come to tame a stallion, be excepted by the Apache, travel with no men or protection, and get the name Wolf. He remembered the young Apache man called her Wolf Chels. She howled and growled but that was the only way he could see her getting that name. However she did hold the same beauty as the creature. She is a Wolf. He thought. He smiled to himself, he hadn't felt this way for along time. It was so long since he was comfortable and interested in a woman. He wanted to know more about her. Chap.2: Chelsea Awakes to Chavez Can't wait to read your guys' veiws on the redone first chapter.. Then will post 2nd. Chap.2: Chelsea Awakes to Chavez It was early in the night, most of the town was heading to bed. Such as the pure citizens of White Oaks, always did. At Jane's it was the oppisite senrario. Billy was rehashing stories, making them be more out going than a bronco at a rodio. The young prince of penn. couldn't get enough of these tellings. Jane however had known Billy but she played along. It was nice to see him again. He was like fresh air still child like but, with a dangerous man of adventures attitude. Every now and then she would vier over to Doc and Aryn's card game. Though it wasn't much of a game, with Aryn winning and out smarting Doc. Doc as a gentleman was polite and funny, his man ego however was taking quite a beating. It was positively grand to see Doc wanting to crwal out of his skin. Henery too enjoyed watching Doc and talking to Aryn. He found her a lot like his own wife, but alot like Doc in the way she thought. It was nice to hear such a woman again. As Doc scqirmed Henery and Jane shared a look. Jane's glint was all that needed to be said. He had lost another game. As they tried to repress the giggles and fits of laughter approching, when Doc asked how she knew such knowlege of these \"games\". They were gambling and Aryn was a card shark without even knowing. True she had played with an old man often a few years ago but that was a life time ago. Doc went on unsatisfied with the answer. Henery just smypathetic smile and started small talk. It was welcomed with a soft smile. Dave was intrested in small talk and couldn't get an opening to talk to her in anyway. He wasn't to heart broken since he got his \"boonda\" right quick form one of Jane's girls or two. All was quite calm yet to all it felt strangely normal. The gang was relaxed and doing well at their own thing. Though every so often Aryn and Jane would look to the stairs. Chavez or Chels hadn't come down. They knew better than most that she needed rest, for what she had just endured. Jane assurred her that Chavez was safe, if Spirit found him safe then she could be no safer. Aryn still worried, so Jane would go to check every so often. Jane had come and gone at least 4 times, 2 with Aryn in toe by Chavez's count. They couldn't wait for her to wake. Not that she wasn't going to, or that he was going to do anything like eat her. He had eaten with the others at dinner. Aryn and the girls remained quit as the wind about their lives. None of the boys thought it was right, 2 women unprotected travelling. With Jane on their side none of the men could voice more than some concern. He smiled softly. To be so over protective ment it should be something of value to protect. Aryn had given him leave to go through any thing in of Chel's bags to find anything to help her. It would of worried him why she had been asleep so long, but Jane explained that she had experienced a sort of trama over the last year. It was one that took more of her soul than anything else. Now that was just another rattle for the snake of questions he had. She seemed strong. ","Summary":" Young Guns2 & Young Wolf Billy and the gang run to 2 girls who are much more than they appear.. And"},{"Movie":"Young Guns","Title":"Banking on the Good Will of Others","Author":"karrenia","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9192082","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: the Young Guns movies belong to Morgan Creek Productions and its various producers and director as do the characters which appear here or are mentioned. They are not mine and are only 'borrowed' for the purposes of the story. This is set prior to the events shown in the movies and was written for the Summer 2012 Multifandom Bromance Big Bang Challenge \"Banking on the Good Will of Others\" by karrenia Their reasons for coming out west were as varied as the individuals themselves; some saw it as being uprooted from everything comfortable and familiar and safe in order to venture into unknown. Some saw it as a chance to start over. And yet others, as a hardship, or an investment or an opportunity chance to exploit the land's natural resources. Josiah Scurlock believed he could say that he was a mixture of all venturing into the unknown and a learning experience, one which he relished with every fiber of his being. .All though he could say that he welcomed even relished the new experiences that came his way, in others he was still a bit rooted in the ideas and customs that he'd observed and learned back West. Even as he stood at the side of his horse with his arm raised to shade his eyes from the noon day that slanted down towards the meridian, he was reminded of one of his favorite Mark Twain quotes he'd once had to memorize in school. \"East is east and West is and never the twain shall meet\". In the back of his mind, he thought. 'That's true as far as it goes, however, there are always exceptions to every rule and the way I figure it, it's will take a lot more experience and common sense when to recognize the difference. If that were not the case he might not have made much account of himself, considered himself much too bookish and fonder of the mind than the body, as the saying went, to make it in the rougher and tougher environs of the New Mexico Territory. He shook his head and wondered exactly what it was that had convinced a certain Mr. John Tunstall take as varied a bunch of boys and take them under his wing and entrust them with the upkeep and security of his sprawling cattle ranch. Said ranch was one of the largest in the territory for miles around. While it was profitable and well-maintained that it also made it an attractive target for others to prey upon and not all of those predators went on four feet. Tunstall had always been a careful man, a clever one, too, and kind but he had never made the mistake of being naïve enough to let others take advantage of him, and much of that involved the topsy-turvy nature of life in the Territory and the intricate politics of the time. Said politics were thorny and often dangerous, but he wanted to get ahead he would be forced to navigate his way through them. Such maneuvers would require nerves of steel and the kind of insider knowledge of the area and its people. It was a dangerous and delicate game, one which none of the participants were at all willing to lose. Josiah sighed and shook his head, figuring that he had never cared much for politics anyway. His horse and those of his fellow regulators snorted and pulled on their reins eager to be off once more Dick Brewster, who rode at his side, had his attention focused on the herd of cattle and was not, paying any attention to him. Chavez, a Mexican, Indian; and considered something of a mongrel half-breed, watched Josiah, once given the nickname Doc because it had seemed to fit his studious and doggedly determined personality; rocking back and forth in his saddle and allowing to let his hands rest lightly on the reins. By now Chavez had come to recognize that far-away look in his friend's blue eyes; as if Josiah were regarding the scenery. However, in truth, Chavez realized that his friend was seeing the landscape of the mind that was much clearer at this moment than anything external. He knew a thing or two about be able to see within oneself, having never really feeling that he felt in, and having to more or less learn that lesson at an early age Chavez had felt himself to have much in common with that of the interminable tumbleweeds that blew across the face of the land. He would never willingly give up on his heritage, a heritage that he still embraced because while he might not ever be fully Indian or fully White; although he had long since resolved that the two halves should never have to be at war with one another. The outside world might see it that way but to his way of thinking it made no sense whatsoever. In the back of his mind he thought, 'Why should they be? I made the decision long ago that I will never be ashamed of either who or what I am and there is certainly no reason to start now.' He turned his attention back to Josiah and tapped him gently on the shoulder, his friend blinked and then seemed to return from whatever place his mind had been and offered his friend a confident and reassuring grin. After a moment or two, Chavez returned the grin, realizing in that moment how grateful he was for the friends he had made since agreeing to come aboard as one of John Tunstall's ranch hands. Their milling herd of cattle were occupied in snorting and stomping and munching on the forage they could muster as they waited to be prodded into movement once more. \"We should get going, the sun is almost at the tree-line and we don't want to be late,\" Chavez said. \"I agree,\" replied Dick Brewster. \"We don't want to be late and we still have several heads of cattle to get in before dark,\" Chavez agreed. \"You'll get no argument from me,\" Josiah remarked, now apparently returned from whatever distant place in his own mind that he had been visiting. Chavez stole one last long appraising look at his friend and then, seemingly satisfied with what he saw, shrugged his own supple shoulders and kicked his own mount into motion as well. \"Then let's get while the getting's good,\" exclaimed Dick and with that began to yell and cajole the cattle back into line, weaving his own horse in and out of the herd and slapping the flanks of the most relcatraint animals with the cattle prod that he carried with him for that purpose. The milling herd, now pointed in the right direction began to move and then got moving once more. Later that evening, with the majority of the daily chores had been completed and the others had settled in to enjoy some much needed rest and relaxation, Chavez was still out putting some last minute touches on a new paddock. When Josiah went to look for him, he found him huddled at the side of the pen with his left hand clutched in his right, applying pressure with his could hand as best he could with his uninjured hand under the circumstances in the fading light. It had gotten quite late, and the moon, a bare silver of itself this late in the spring was hidden behind a bank of scudding clouds, which made it even more difficult to determine the extent of the injury. However, Josiah realized that the bright red that seeped out from between Chavez's upturned and tightly clenched hands, was both difficult to miss or mistake it for what it was. \"What happened?\" \"I missed a step,\" Chavez,\" remarked in his laconic fashion and seeing that was not going to be enough of an explanation went on to say, \"It was getting dark but I wanted to finish putting in the palings of the new fencing before bed tonight, but I slipped and cut my hand.\" \"We need to get you inside and have that looked at immediately,\" Josiah said. \"Come on, let me help you up.\" \"It looks worse than it feels,\" Chavez remarked even as Josiah levered him up off the ground and he leaned on him as they made their way back to the front door of the ranch house and inside. The other regulators, not yet abed were occupied playing a game of gin rummy and looked up as they staggered in. \"Where's the first aid kit? He's cut his hand on a loose paling in the new stockade.\" \"Near the mud room,\" Dick replied. The newest and youngest member of the regulators seemed primed to offer a few barbed remarks of his own. 'The kid's got a mouth on him, and often seems to have nothing but a kind of barely constrained nervous energy about him at all times, that we might have to leash in should it get out of control, but I the way I figure he's got a lot more to him than that.' \"Need a hand?\" Billy asked in a low, lazy drawl, allowing the fan of the cards to flutter to the top of the table where they'd been playing and spring up to a standing position, all the while taking a surreptious glance at the hands of the other players. He did not look at it as strictly cheating or that he simply could not help but look or that he did not know any better, but to his way of thinking the more someone told him no, or that it was something that people did not do because it was against the rules or what have you; the more he felt that he had to do it. It was probably the most telling trait of his volatile personality, but he meant well, that was the important thing, right? And for what it was worth he had found in this place and these people something stable and secure that he had never even known he'd needed; and he had vowed he would stand by them come hell, high water and back, no matter what. Josiah nodded and said. \"I've got it covered, thanks all the same. You guys can go back to your game, in fact, once were done we might even join you.\" \"When you've finished come on back and we'll deal you in, \"offered Dick with an encouraging smile. \"Right then,\" Josiah replied. He went out of the front living room and took Chavez around back to the mud room and sat him down on a stool while he went to look for the promise first aid kit. Finding it up on a high shelf near the back door he opened it and began to apply iodine and gauze and to Chavez's injury. The gash was deep but not a long one and his customarily stoic friend did not wince more than once as he worked on it. \"Thanks,\" Chavez replied, balling his hand into a fist and testing it for flexibility and ease of movement, reassured on that score because while the injury was not as severe as he had feared it would be, it was his dominant hand and he did not want to become a liability to the others if he could help it. \"How does it feel?\" \"Better, but stiff, but I figure that's only temporary.\" \"Well, that's reassuring, because you really had me worried there for a moment.\" Chavez tilted his head up and regarded his friend for a moment or two with a quizzical expression on his face, and then added. \"You worry too much.\" \"I guess I do, at that,\" Josiah replied. \"Let's go back and see if that offer to play is still on the table.\" Dick reshuffled the cards three times and then shoved them over to Chavez on his left hand side to cut and then took the resulting stack and began to deal the cards making a snicking sound on the wooden table. They began to play and for a good while or so nothing untoward happened but Dick who was more a stickler for adhering to the rules than the others noticed that Billy, never able to sit still for long stretches of time, was fidgeting, his eyes seeming to travel from one player to the next as if memorizing their hands and their body language, and frankly, it was getting on his last nerve. \"You cheat, Billy,\" Dick finally remarked in an off-hand casual manner. \"I do not,\" Billy griped. Sometimes he felt that everyone was out to get him, as a matter of course, even people that he considered his best friends. He did not much like the feeling because it made him doubt his own mind, and the sincerity of the others who made him feel that way. And whenever he got up like that the fine blond hairs on the back of his neck would stand up on end like the bristles on a boar, and he would get all flushed in the face and his hands would spasmodically clench and unclench at his sands. Whenever that happened he felt like the only way to relieve the tension was to break something or hit something, whichever came first. \"You take that back!\" he yelled. Dick shrugged and added, \"You do, and the evidence is sliding out of your sleeve even as we speak.\" \"Okay, okay, you caught me,\" Billy griped as he allowed the incriminating ace of spades to slide out of the billowing sleeve of his loose long-sleeved shirt. He removed it and held it up to the light of the lamps turning it over and over in his slender but strong fingers as if to examine it from every possible angle, surprised as anyone as it had gotten in there in the first place. \"Is this a common occurrence?\" Chavez asked. \"I should not have to be, \"Dick replied, if a certain party who shall remain nameless agrees to fess up to it.\" \"Okay, okay! Sheesh, you'd think I'd kicked your puppy or something, \"Billy remarked with and then flashed everyone seated around the table one of his trade-marked dazzling and confident devil-may-care grins. Then throw the ace of spades at Dick who caught it between the middle fingers of his right hand and shoved it back into the draw pile. Josiah smiled and said: \"No, of course not, but maybe we should reshuffle all the cards and start fresh, that way it'll be a fair game.\" \"We do that, and we'll be here all night,\" Dick replied with a gaping yawn, and it's decent of you to offer because I am seriously tapped out, but with your luck you'll just win anyway, cheating or no cheating.\" Grinned thought that over for a moment and then realized that in his own unique fashion Dick was offering him a compliment. \"Yeah, okay then. Have it your way.\" Just then John Tunstall came into the room having heard what he heard at a remove from his office where he had been working on finishing up a stack of paperwork and was about to retire for the evening. \"Is everything all right here, gentlemen?\" he asked. \"Yes, Sir,\" Josiah answered, \"Just a bit of disagreement over the rules of the game, but it's fine now.\" \"Well, then, I shall bid you all a good evening then, but I would suggest that you finish up soon for we have an early start tomorrow morning.\" \"We'll do, that,\" Billy added. \"Goodnight, Sir.\" \"Good evening, boys,\" Tunstall offered and turned around and headed up the stairs to the second floor of the ranch house and to his bedroom. Interlude At this time the dominating force in the county was the L.G. Murphy & Dolan Co. and just in time too, because tensions were building between the Company and their new competition, John Tunstall. Both Dolan and Tunstall had one objective, to form a monopoly in Lincoln County. But the Murphy & Dolan Co. had already established their enterprise, and they had the Santa Fe Ring, the county sheriff and now the \"Boys\" backing them up. In 1877 before the outbreak of the Dolan & Tunstall feud, Murphy became ill and went into a hospital in Santa Fe and would die of cancer a year later. This of course discredits the common belief that Murphy was the antagonist in the war against the Englishman, but in reality he was in a hospital bed dying. Instead it was Murphy's protégé, James Dolan, who took his place and became head of the faction. A native of Ireland, Dolan was a feisty young businessman and wouldn't tolerate anything getting in his way and most wouldn't dare to do so -but one man did. His name was John Tunstall, he was a young cocky newcomer who had a get-rich-quick scheme and believed he had the sophistication and brains to outwit these Westerners. \"Everything in New Mexico that pays at all (you may say) is worked by a 'ring' there is the 'indian ring' 'the army ring' 'the political ring' 'the legal ring' 'the Roman Catholic ring' 'the cattle ring' 'the horse thieves ring' and half a dozen rings. It is necessary either to get into a ring or make one for yourself. I am at present at work making a ring.\" \"I propose to confine my operations to Lincoln County, but I intend to handle it in such a way, as to get half of every dollar that is made in the county by anyone.\" Tunstall was not exactly an honest man struggling to start his own business in a corrupt town, but he too was as greedy as Dolan and wanted to form a monopoly; it was only the difference between who was going to outdo one another. So with his father's money and taking on attorney Alex McSween as a partner, Tunstall started his own ranch, opened a town store, and quickly became a thorn in Dolan's side. Tunstall knew he was shaking a hornet's nest, because he built his store like a fort and hired gunmen as ranch employees, so he was expecting trouble, but he believed the law would protect him. A few days later Tunstall had made good on his promise of a reward for all of their hard work and had taken them into town for a social mixer being held and had urged them all to be on their best behavior. Apparently, it was also an unwritten rule that the men could carry their guns on their persons at all times but they had to be checked at the entrance and with the safeties on; and that whatever long-standing grudges or feuds or what not stood by men of any number of alliances had to be set aside for the duration of the gatherings. Joisah recalled Billy snorting at that last bit of instruction but had chocked it up to his friend's rather volatile personality and sheer penchant for perversity. Billy had always struck him as the type who whenever he was told not to do something did the exact opposite and vice versa. Josiah shoved the meandering thought to a back corner of his mind and scanned the faces of the milling and mixing crowd as it eddied and flowed along currents too subtle for him to pick up on. He was looking for a certain red-head with a spread of freckles across the bridge of her nose, hoping against hope that she would be there. The only other time he'd been to a dance in town he had happened upon a girl named Olivia Dunning; and they had shared a brief slow dance together and an abbreviated talk, but she had made a definite impression on him; and he would like to see her once more. The coordinator of the dance had separated the milling crowds of young girls and boys into two halves, facing each other across the expanse of the dance hall, shuffling and fidgeting in place with the kind of awkwardness that only comes with adolescent, then the music began to play, a swelling upbeat from the band that had been situated against the far wall. It was just when he was about to give up and determine that Olivia had not come after all, that he caught the sight of bright green eyes studying him from behind the flimsy shield of lacy blue and white hand-fan and a look in those green eyes that said she had also been watching him for some time. Dick caught him scanning the girl's faces and gave him a quick apprising glance and a good-humored nudge in the ribs. \"Don't get your hopes up, bro,\" he said. \"You know how girls can be, they love to play the come hither, go away game and it's been my experience that they know exactly how to tug on your heart-strings.\" \"You don't know her like I do.\" Dick shrugged. \"How long have you known this girl?\" \"For about two hours, but I am hoping to remedy that, tonight.\" \"What are you talking about?\" Billy interrupted. \"Josiah has a crush on a girl he's only known for two hours,\" Dick replied. \"Oh, then I say, go for it,\" Billy said with a grin and an encouraging nod. \"I think you should make the first move.\" Josiah nodded and squaring his shoulders and with sucking in a deep breath crossed the dance floor and \"Hello, Olivia, remember me?\" \"Well, hell there, yourself, Josiah Scurlock. I do, indeed, and here I was thinking that you'd never come over and greet me right proper like,\" said Olivia with a coy fluttering of her reddish eyelashes and fluttering of her hand fan, which she snapped close and pocketed. \"May I have this dance?\" he asked. \"I would be honored,\" she replied. They walked out to the center of the dance floor, her elbow entwined in his and they began to move in tandem to the rhythm of the music as it rose and feel in intermittent swoops and dives, and in between he looked for a conversational opening, uncertain, after several months had passed exactly what to say to a girl from one of the powerful and influential families in the New Mexico Territory. \"I, I,\" he stuttered. \"I've been busy. You see, I work for Mr. John Tunstall on his cattle ranch and I'm one of his Regulators.\" \"Do tell,\" Olivia said. \"What exactly does a regulator do,\" she asked this time with an honest note of interest in her voice. \"We keep the peace and security on Mr. Tunstall's property and whenever we're out and about on a cattle drive across country we make sure that none of his property goes missing.\" \"May I tell you a secret, Josiah,\" Olivia asked in a hushed undertone. \"Of course,\" he replied. She smiled and tilting her head up and stretching a bit because of the difference in their respective heights she suddenly planted a warm and lingering kiss on his lips. His reaction was a mixture of something between surprise and pleasure and he found himself looking for something to do with his hands as he began to shuffle his booted feet on the hard wood dance floor. Olivia smiled. \"I've been wanting to do that since we first met.\" \"Not that I'm complaining,\" he said, this time with a much more confident smile than his earlier awkward and nervous one from a few moments earlier, \"but why did you do that?\" \"Because I wanted to, because I think you're the only one around here who would really listen to my rambling thoughts, and because I think you're really cute,\" she replied. \"There have been times, since my family and I came out here that I've wanted to be less of a spectator and more of a participant in the affairs of this part of the country,\" Olivia replied. \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean, that just because I'm a girl, no one can bring themselves to believe that I can have a thought in this pretty little head of mine,\" she griped with a pretty but petulant slant to her mouth. \"You said it yourself, that part of your job as a Regulator is too keep an eye out for unscrupulous types that would otherwise steal or harm your employer's property, yes?\" \"Yes, but I doubt that he's told you much about the details of the alliances and feuds that go on all the time around here.\" \"I don't understand,\" he replied. \"Why are you telling me this?\" \"Because I think you should know, and because, as corny as it might sound, I think I love you, and I think I have since the moment we first met,\" Olivia sighed and because if what my father and I have discovered about the Murphy's and their allies, something terrible is about to go down tonight and I don't want anything terrible to happen to you, or your friends.\" Josiah titled his head back and thought over everything that she had told him and everything that had been left unsaid and realized that he'd been right about this girl, she was special, so much more so than even had believed. He wrapped his arms around her and held her in a tight embrace bending down to kiss her on the lips not caring in the least at the moment that people were staring at them. \"Thank you, Olivia, for everything,\" he whispered. \"No, thank you,\" she replied. \"Just promise me that you will be careful and always stay true to yourself,\" she added. \"I promise,\" he whispered in return. Meanwhile, the others had more or less gone off on their own, more by unspoken agreement than by design with the understanding that they would meet up later in the evening after the evening had begun to wind down. Dick was busy courting a trio of young ladies at a table in the corner with varying degrees of success, and who waved him on as he passed by. The girls seemed to be a mixed bunch, one with such fair hair of such a white blond shade that in the flickering light of the gas lamps it appeared to be almost platinum. The one who sat on her left had hair that as black as a crow's wing and her wide up-titled eyes in a dusky face hinted at a foreign ancestry. Dick had his arm wrapped around the girl seated at his right with brown eyes that were artfully hidden behind the lacy hand-fan that she waved as much to stave the heat of the day as for effect. She also giggled quite a lot, a girlish behavior that Dick did not mind at all, and just thought it was a characteristic common to the fairer sex. He let them carry the conversation for the most part; getting the latest news of dress and hair fashions that had been trickling in from the East and, interjecting a word or two of his edge whenever there seemed to be a conversational opening. It suddenly occurred to him, that, as the oldest among Tunstall's hired hands and as an eligible young bachelor, that hopefully none of these lovely young ladies would believe that the attention that he was paying to them meant that they thought something more would come of it. Dick momentarily lost the thread of one of the girl's remarks when Billy passed by his table in a loose-limbed determined stride that was so characteristic of him and waved a greeting in acknowledgement. Billy returned the wave and continued on his way. From across the dance floor he had marked and noted the presence of a group of young men from the surrounding towns and area who were more less good-naturedly shoving and elbowing and laughing at each other's rough jests when Billy ambled over to them adopting a lazy desultory posture and a winning smile on his face. \"Mind if I join you?\" he asked. \"Effing off with you,\" the biggest and meanest looking of the group muttered. \"Now, now,\" Billy remarked, spreading his hands out in a dumb show of harmlessness, \"Is that any way to act a social gathering?\" \"I really don't give a damn what...\" he began to say but was interrupted by a not too subtle elbow in his ribs by one of the other boys, with a cooler head and a better sense that their conversation had attracted eye-tracks. Eventually the couple passed on by and the conversation picked up once more. \"Oh, I just thought we might hang out a bit, get to know each other,\" drawled Billy. \"Maybe I don't want to get acquainted with you,\" shouted the older bigger boy. At this point Billy realized that he had not gone into this meeting by chance or the seeing it as an opportunity to widen his social circle; he'd actually gone out of his way to force a confrontation. It had been a while since he and his friends had clashed with the thugs that comprised the enforcers for the Santa Fe ring, and while their boss had been very careful not to mention his growing frustration and difficulties with the ring in front of the boys; he knew it was becoming more and more difficult for the older man. He also was aware in a back corner of his mind that he really should not be doing this, it would be akin to continually poking a long stick into a hornet's nest agitating an already tense situation; but he felt as taut as a drawn bow, itching for action, and he wanted to fight; and so did they, all they needed was one wrong move in order to push them over the edge; and he would have the fight he'd been spoiling for after so long. \"Well,\" he said, I guess what we have here is a failure to communicate...\"\" he deliberately trailed off and let the awkward silence drag out for a heartbeat or two. \"Are you gonna let him talk to you that way, Roger?\" another boy asked. Another chose that moment to add. \"Can't you see that he's just trying to provoke you. Let's get out of here, and be rid of the effing big mouth.\" \"Are you calling me stupid?\" the boy addressed as Roger demanded. \"Hey, if the shoe fits,\" Billy replied with a supple shrug of his slender but strong shoulders. \"I'm not stupid,\" Roger continued but this time in a quieter and more subdued tone of voice than a few moments earlier, as if even in his own mind, he doubted his own words. He was also the type that was more accustomed to following orders and never deviating or questioning them. When the time came that he got to boss others around, he could usually get his way by using his size and strength to intimidate. Roger did not like having to think too hard or have to handle more than one thing at once; it made him uncomfortable and when he got like that, he got mad. Roger's face turned beet read and he growled low in his throat before he lashed out with a clenched fist and slugged the younger over-confident younger boy in the mouth, watching with satisfaction as the blow connected and snapped Billy's head back. Billy quickly recovered, and with an inarticulate snarl, and all the while with a pleasant grin that showed all of his even white teeth, punched the bigger boy right in the mouth. He was rewarded a few moments later, watching with a mixture of anticipation and apprehension, Roger swaying back and forth like a pendulum for a few heart-breaking seconds, and who then toppled over like a felled tree. Even as he watched, the skinny fellow who had only earlier spoken up about not getting out before any trouble was in the offing began to drub him with a few rabbit-like punches, while the skinny fellow verbally egged him on. Billy followed suit, his mind only following the course of the fight as it flowed from one moment to the next and he felt himself becoming like water, flowing and everywhere all at once, slipping and sliding out his opponents grasp as fluid as if they were not even there. However, his luck could not hold out forever, for one thing he was out-numbered at least three to one and eventually he'd go down, but even as these thoughts passed through his head, they disappeared as quickly as water from a split and broken canteen. Meanwhile, Josiah and Dick and Chavez, who had felt it prudent to remain at the fringes of the gathering, had met up with each other when the noise of the growing altercation attracted their attention; and they were not the only ones. \"We'd best put a stop to this, quick like,\" remarked Dick with a reproving shake of his head. Josiah nodded and heaved a heavy sigh. \"Why is it that I am not at all surprised by this development?\" \"Because it's Billy?\" Dick said, and given the tone of his voice it was not a question but a statement. \"How much do you want to bet that he provoked the fight?\" Josiah asked. \"Not enough to make it worth my while,\" replied Dick. \"Then let's get this over with,\" Josiah replied as they wove their way through the crowd, realizing even as they reached the fight that they were not the only ones whose attention had been drawn to the brawl. The older and cooler heads had begun by verbally remonstrating with the participants to bring it to a halt and after a moment or two as the realization sunk in that none of the boys were listening or even aware that anyone else were listening to them; figured that more drastic matters were in order. Dick , Chavez and Josiah waded into the fray, taking an elbow or two in the ribs as they did so, grabbed their friend by the shoulders and tugged him out of the fight, all the while urging him to 'snap out of it,\" as loud as they could. He fought their efforts every step of the way, but they were determined to get out of there as fast as possible. Billy continually kicked out like an angry and spooked mule and ferocious stubbornness, apparently oblivious to anything else around him with the single-minded determination to get back into the fight; but they hung on and finally pulled him into a relative clear spot, away from the curious crowd of spectators. In the distance, they could hear a voice of man that they recognized as James Dolan conversing with their boss, and occupied as they were with a struggling and swearing William H. Bonney, could only catch about three words in ten; about how if he were a better judge of character that something like this would never have happened and that was why he was held in such high regard by Murphy and Sons and the Santa Fe ring. Tunstall's response to that what, \"I am managing his own interests, just fine, thank you. And they then overheard him say something that sounded much like, \"Boys will be boys.\" Whatever response Dolan might have made in return was drowned out in the noise of the crowd and having to concentrate in dragging their friend away by main force. Conclusion To say that John Tunstall was furious would have been an understatement; he was livid. A vein high in the dome of his forehead began to pule. However, he was too much the gentleman to allow that anger to show as they rode out of town. As the dust of the road puffed up in their tracks, none of their company wanted to look back. He rode with his back ramrod straight in the saddle and with his lips tightly pressed together, and his hands clasped around the saddle horn white-knuckled. The boys, who rode along in his wake were just as nervous, Chavez remarked that he could not recall the man ever that angry before and that for his part he did not dread any harsh words that the man might have to offer over what had happened at the dance. \"Well, good for you,\" Billy muttered, \"You're not the one he's mad at.\" \"That's the problem, Billy, what possessed you to pick a fight with the Murphy boys, of all people,\" Dick demanded as loudly as he dared. Billy shrugged and replied, \"It seemed like a good idea at the time.\" \"You've gotta be effing kidding me!\" Dick exclaimed. At that Tunstall turned his head and regarded them with a steady apprising look in his brown eyes, his brow furrowed in thoughtful lines. \"It was a simple order, to maintain decorum at a social gathering. What that too much for you to manage, William?\" Billy squirmed in his saddle and seemed for a moment rather preoccupied in finding somewhere, anywhere for his eyes to rest upon other than maintaining eye contact with the older man. His mobile features shifted from angry to chagrined and back with the swiftness of a ticking pendulum before he glanced up and locked gazes. \"If you want me to say that I'm sorry, you're gonna have a long wait!\" \"This insubordination will not be tolerated; do I make myself perfectly clear, young man?\" barked Tunstall. \"Crystal, sir,\" replied Billy quietly, realizing even without being able to fully articulate why it was so, but he did and maybe he would not have backed down so quickly had it been anyone else but he respected and admired Tunstall and that since he'd come under the man's authority and guidance, he come a long way from the brash and head-strong homeless thug that had come out to the New Mexico territory as just another faceless hired gun in an outlaw gang. It also sank in like a lead bullet penetrating into one's stomach that now his actions reflected on each and every one of his friends and his boss. \"I'm sorry, Sir. I won't happen again.\" \"It had better not, but if it does, try to pick a location that isn't so….public.\" The expression on the younger's face was one of mingled shock and surprise, more so because it was not at all what he had expected. \"Why? Billy managed at last. \"Because I would rather not become too predictable, and also, II figured that by doing so you might learn a thing or two about how there is such a thing as a time and place for picking fights.\" \"I still don't quite understand,\" replied Billy. \"You will, eventually, if I have anything to do with it. Although, under the circumstances I suppose it comes as some relief that no one got hurt, so there is that.\" \"I think that little weasel bruised a rib or two,\" remarked Billy in an off-hand manner, wondering if he was through the worst of it and was about to heave a sigh of relief when Tunstall pinned him with another level gaze. \"But don't think for a moment that any of you are getting off easy, because you are not.\" He paused and then tilted his head to one side as if thinking matters over before he continued, \"Because you are not. I hold each of you responsible for each other's actions. You will work extra hours on the ranch to make up for this, do you understand me?\" There was a general of an unspoken consensus that travelled around the half-circle of riders before they said almost in unison, \"Yes, Sir!\" \"Good, then I'm glad that we understand one another.\" With that Tunstall rode on ahead but the guarded look in his seat in the saddle was gone as was the tight-lipped look in his eyes and tautness of his hands around his saddle pommel. In fact, both Dick and Josiah could have sworn that he was actually trying not to shake, from laughter. The young men rode in companionable silence for some time, one which none felt inclined to break until they rounded a bend and rode down a low grade into the dip in the land where the ranch house had been built and finally Josiah elbowed Billy in the ribs and muttered. \"Nice shiner, by the way,\" he smirked. \"Gee, thanks,\" Billy snorted. His horse shifted nervously beneath him and whinnied, snaking its head around to regard his rider with a questioning look in its liquid brown eyes. Billy drew back on the reins and drummed his fingers on the saddle pommel. The horse turned its head back around with a snort. \"You do realize, that most people commonly emerge from a brawl with just one, \"added Chavez. \"Only you would have to have two to show for your bone-headed efforts.\" \"They were not entirely bone-headed, Chavez,\" argued Billy, but his heart was not in it, and they all knew it. \"Okay, not completely,\" he added as an afterthought, \" I really did have a plan when I went into it, Honest. But somehow it got lost somewhere along the way. And since when are you an expert in brawls?\" \"I'm not, I am just a keen observer of events,\" Chavez calmly replied. A moment or two later, Billy lifted his right arm up in order to vigorously rub the skin around the sore and discolored skin around his eyes and squinted up at the sprinkling of late evening stars that dotted the dome of the sky overhead, trying with a moderate amount of success to stave off an oncoming head-ache. \"Not entirely,\" agreed Chavez, but give us some kind of advance warning before you ever do something like this again.\" \"I second that,\" Josiah remarked. \"I third that,\" Dick added, not to be outdone. \"Then I guess it unanimous, then, \" agreed Billy with a broad but heart-felt grin plastered onto the features of his mobile face, only partially succeeding in keeping the laughter from bursting out of him like water from a burst dam. He extended a hand to each of his friends and then sealed the promise with a firm hand shake.

Written for kayim in the 2010 New Year Resolutions Challenge. \"Two Steps to the Right\" by karrenia December, 1870's To look at the young men now: for all the world like a six or seven year old school children with their faces scrunched up in concentration; he allowed himself a wry grin. To see this image of boys one would never realize what a talent for mischief they each had. In the back of his mind John wondered which of them is the more mischievous, Dick or Josiah. Dick is darker, sturdier with large dark brown eyes in a swallow-skinned face, and his also prone to slouching which makes his height less evident. However, with work and discipline Tunstall believed that he could teach that boy to stand up straight an be counted on. The older boy, Josiah: lanky, pale blue eyes in an open, honest face with his blond hair disheveled and streaked by the sun. His skin is red and peeling here and there from long hours spent out in the sun and there is just something about him that tells him that he might hold more promise than the younger boy. However to Tunstall's discerning eye he also notes that while it's too early to tell for certain Brewer also seems to have in inclination to look up to an older male as an authority figure. \"It's a toss-up. After all, boys will be boys.\" 'We learn as much from our mistakes and missteps as much as we learn from our victories; a lesson that John Tunstall has tried in his lifetime both back East and now as a moderately successful rancher in the New Mexico Territory to life by and to instill into his young charges.' While Tunstall is quite aware that his detractors and rivals might mistake his nonchalant urbanity for false modesty; he has also come to accept the fact tongues will always wag, and he can either take it as it comes or ignore it. It would be a darn shame were these boys, like so many others that had come from back East for whatever their reasons had been. At this point John Tunstall really didn't give a damn, if he could make a difference then he would try and teach them what he knew when it came to working the ranch and how to handle themselves in civilized society. There really was no good and logical reason for them to be swallowed up by the rough and dangerous environment in which they had found themselves. There were all kinds of dangers out there and some of them went about on two legs. Perhaps he had allowed himself to wax a bit overly dramatic but the dangers were out there and they could not be safely ignored. Tunstall did not believe himself to be a stupid man; one could survive long in Lincoln County by pretending that dangers did not exist. Just then another thought followed on the heels of the first one: Tunstall leaned over leaned back in his leather arm chair and allowed himself a wry smile, twisting his lips and furrowing his brow. 'Let's be honest with ourselves here, John, can you really say for certain that your motives here are completely altruistic? I've got a farm to working and while I am wish to instill and promote manners and civility into this these young men;, I do have a ranch to operate and money is hard to come by these days; Very well, I am not being completely altruistic, however, I shall press on regardless of either my critics or the consequences.' \"After all the beginnings of all things are small; even the great ones,\" he said aloud. Josiah bent over the copy desk with his elbows resting on the smooth grainy wood, wondering if the 'old man' was watching, and wondering also if he would disapprove of his disheveled appearance. Several previous attempts at his writing assignment lay in crumbled inside the nearby wastebasket. He had never had a problem with Tunstall as his boss on the ranch; most of the day-to-day work was at the gruff orders of the foreman and Tunstall usually only put in a appearance three or two days a week. Josiah enjoyed the work, being out in the open and he discovered that working with horses and cattle while often dirty and tiring; was work that he took pride in doing well and on time. And for his part, Dick did his share of the work without too much complaint. Dick glanced up from his own copy desk and bemused expression on his face and held up his sheet of paper. \"What do you think?\" he asked. On the sheet of paper in fine ink was a drawing, a doodle really of a man on a horse with the long dark mustaches that their benefactor affected complete with the hat. Josiah waited a moment before responding realizing that they were supposed to be writing an essay not entering an art competition and judging by the expression on Dick's face he really wanted the older boy's honest opinion. His initial impulse was to blurt out the obvious that while it was an approximate likeness of the older man, it might not go over very well were they to present it as proof of their labors in the lesson room. While he chewed over his response Dick prompted again. \"Well?\" \"Uh, it's pretty good.\" Josiah replied. \"What are you writing about?\" Dick asked as he set the piece of paper with his drawing back down on the desk. \"I don't know,\" Josiah replied with a shrug. \"You probably need to put in something about horses and stuff, or about Christmas,\" replied Dick with a shrug. \"I think he'll like it.\" A day or two later The town elders were hosting a dance and having asked the boys to get scrubbed up and dressed in their Sunday-best Tunstall had his ranch foreman hitch up the horses and they all rode into town. The noise was the first thing Josiah and Dick noticed, and then the smells of rich pipe tobacco from the men, perfume from the women and the piney smell of the Yule logs merrily aglow on the scattered bonfires. There were more girls than he had expected, but then he really hadn't known what to expect and at first Josiah felt awkward and stammered through desultory small talk. He had lost track of Mr. Tunstall and Dick Brewer as the evening wore on. Scurlock realized that both he and Dick had been introduced to other ranchers, their staff and local business men, but for the most part he only registered about five names in ten, otherwise it all flashed by in a big colorful blur. A girl with intricately braided and piled red hair crowing her head took his arm and swung with him in tow into the circle dance. Josiah felt her pull on his arm like a sea shell could feel the pull of the inevitable tide that brought into shore and then out to sea once more. \"You've been awfully quiet, Josiah,\" the red head remarked. \"I said, would you like to dance?\" \"Uh, Yes, Yes I would,\" he stammered. They swung into the dance, twirling and dipping more or less in time to the music and then Josiah realized that he really wanted to learn more about life out here, where both opportunities and possibilities seemed that much more difficult to attain but worth it in the end. \"What's your name, \" he asked the red head. \"Olivia,\" she replied. \"Olivia,\" Josiah said with more conviction than he could recall showing before. \"I am going to make something of myself one of these days. Just you wait and see.\" \"Hmm.\" she murmured. \"I think I'd like to see you make good on that promise.\" ","Summary":" Disclaimer: Young Guns and the characters that appear here or are mentioned belong to the producers"},{"Movie":"Young Guns","Title":"The Boys of The Dregs","Author":"EyesOfEmeraldFire","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11913994","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Young and desperate, down on his luck and rejected time and again by the only woman he ever loved, the tall dark cowboy wandered west from his Northern home, down into New Mexico with nothing but fifty dollars in his pocket and an extra shirt and a little grub in a burlap sack. His Mama had cried. Her baby was too young to make it out in such ruthless country alone. But he had known better. He was young, but he was strong, and he'd done a lot of praying over the subject too. The Lord had seemed to be on his side with this one. Or if he wasn't, he hadn't bothered to send him a sign to halt his plans. \"All ashore, son.\" The conductor said when the big black locomotive reached Roswell, New Mexico. \"Much obliged.\" The young man replied with a slight tip of his hat as he got to his feet, his dusty burlap slung over his shoulder as he hopped down from the luggage car onto the dusty streets of the bustling little town. The west was said to be a rugged place, and he'd believed the stories, but this wasn't exactly what he had expected. Roswell didn't look as dangerous as those little yellow back books had made it seem. Maybe the West really wasn't so bad after all. After a quick glance around the young boy headed in the direction of a large livery stable at the edge of town. He needed a decent mount to make it in this country. Wether the rumors of the west were true or not, having a good horse was just common sense. Upon entering, the boy spotted a blazed face gelding. A sturdy, muscular horse with his head and ears held high. He'd do just fine if he could afford him. \"Hey there...\" He spoke gently, approaching the horse and stroking the bridge of his nose lightly before scratching underneath his chin. The horse nickered to him and he cracked a little grin. He'd spend his life around horses if he could. They were a good sight friendlier than most people he'd known. \"I see yer admirerin' Ol' red there, sonny.\" The Irish stable owner acknowledge the boy, stepping over with a outstretched hand. \"Fine lookin' animal.\" The young man replied, reaching out his own hand to shake the man's. \"Dick Brewer.\" He introduced himself. \"Nice to meet ya, boyo. Names Seamus.\" The man replied. \"Need a mount do ye'?\" \"That's about the size of it I reckon.\" Dick nodded, taking a look inside the horses's mouth to assess the age of the animal. He figured him to be around seven or eight. Still pretty young. He'd work alright for him for awhile. \"This ones a mighty fine one.\" The owner assured him, patting the horse's rump a couple times. \"Cuts cattle like a champ and a fine roper. Never has spooked at gunfire as long as I've known him. A cattleman's dream he is. He'd do well by ya, boyo.\" \"He is a looker. I'll give him that.\" Dick nodded, rubbing down the horse's back as he looked him over from top to bottom. He knew horses like the back of his hand. That he owed to Daddy. He'd taught him well. \"How much?\" He asked the owner after awhile of checking the gelding over thoroughly. \"Well, for him I'd say forty. If you're in need of a saddle and bridle it'll be around fifty five all together.\" The owner said, rubbing the animal's neck. Dick's face turned hard again, disappointed. He'd let himself put his heart into the horse already like a foolish child. \"Sure ya can't go any lower, mister?\" He asked the man. \"See, I've only got about thirty to spend.\" The shop owner shook his head. \"I'm afraid he ain't mine to barter with, me boy or I would.\" He replied with a sorrowful frown. Dick sighed and gave the red gelding one last pat on the shoulder before stepping away. \"Reckon I'd better look at your other stock then.\" He said. \"Well hold on, now.\" The livery owner told him. \"Ye' seem like a good lad. I wouldn't feel right lettin' ye' walk away without this horse.\" Dick stopped and looked at the man intently, listening to every word he had I say after that. \"I got a load of feed comin' in at noon, a roof that needs reparin' and some colts that need breakin'.\" He told him. \"My boy won't be back from Santa Fe till Friday, and my stable hand's nursin' a broken leg. If ya'd be willin' to help a poor old horseman I'll sell ol' red to ya for twenty. Saddle, bridle and all.\" Dick was shocked, and gratefully he shook the man's hand. \"It's a deal, sir.\" He told the old man with a nod. \"I'm in your debt.\" \"No need, boyo. The good lord wants his people to help one another.\" The stable owner replied. \"I'm just carryin' out his wishes. The old man was just the kind soul Dick Brewer needed to cut his teeth out here in the west. After the work had all been done and he'd scrounged up a little extra from breaking a couple young fillies for some old cowboys, he said goodbye to the friendly old stable owner, thanked him kindly and lit out of Roswell for Lincoln to find some more permanent work. He'd asked around and most folks agreed the growing little cowtown was just the place to go job hunting. As soon as he entered the town of Lincoln he understood what all the fuss over the west had been about. Lincoln was a rough place alright. Hangings were a regular event and just after a few weeks of being in town Dick had seen at least four and didn't care to watch another. \"Lot of bad ones around these parts huh?\" He asked an old cowhand outside of the saloon one night after an unlucky outlaw was strung up outside the jailhouse. \"All the worst of 'em.\" The man replied sourly. \"Your in outlaw country now, boy. Best get yerself some lead if'n ya wanna keep yer guys inside ya.\" Dick didn't take the warning lightly. The next day he got himself a .45 to strap around his waist. Even if he never had to use it, it made him feel a lot better having it near and handy. Of course, the outlaws had no reason to bother him anyway. In fact, his temporary arrangements had even offered him a chance to get on good terms with a few. Breaking horses was a business most outlaws found essential to their lifestyle, and Dick was mighty good at it. They weren't his only customers, however, and that he was glad of. Mostly it was ranch hands, and farmers that sought him out, needing a colt broken in or a bronc tamed down enough to cut cattle with. It was tough work, but Dick wasn't complaining. It paid decent and even though he'd come out west to be a rancher, he enjoyed the work with horses. One of his costumers always kept him on his toes, though, wanting several cart horses broken to drive. Dick wasn't exactly familiar with driving horses, but after the first few he found his way around them. \"Fine work, my boy. He's a joy to take to town now. How do you do it?\" The old Englishman praised Dick one afternoon after picking up the colt he'd left to Dick a few weeks before. \"Just doin' my job, Mr. Tunstall.\" The boy replied. \"Nothin' special.\" The man was a kind, gentle soul. He paid generously was always friendly and willing to talk awhile when he came to pick his horses up. Dick liked him. He was a good man in an awful rough place. He'd watch the old fella drive his old shiny buggy up to the general store every morning while he was working the colts at sunup. He'd wave to Dick with a warm and kind smile and he'd wave back with one of his own. After awhile the two struck up a friendship, and Dick came to find himself looking forward to the man's visits every afternoon, when business in his store was rather slow. They talked of his home in England, and of Dick's own home in Vermont, the families they'd left behind and the hopes they had for ranching. \"It's a rather hard land to get along in, Richard, that much is certain.\" The man said one day while Dick was brushing down a young stud. \"Yeah but if a fella can make it here the payoff can be awful good.\" He replied, wiping the sweat from his brow with a dusty sleeve. \"Quite right.\" Mr. Tunstall nodded with an amused grin, watching the boy work. \"You're an ambitious young man, my boy. I like that in a person.\" \"Just the way my folks raised me, I reckon.\" Dick replied, checking the colt's hooves before standing up straight, cracking his aching back and walking over to the water Paul he had hanging over the post for a drink. \"Well they raised you right then, son.\" Mr. Tunstall told him with an approving nod. \"Thank ya, sir.\" Dick replied before swallowing down a few big ladles full of cold water. Dick grew attached to his new friend and after awhile he became like a sort of father figure to him, stopping by to check on him and visit several times a day and bringing him food and water often when he needed it. Kindness was tough to come by in Lincoln County, and Dick was happy to have found a little in the kind old shop keeper. Fate gave him a chance to return the favor one morning when his friend came into town, driving that same shiny buggy down the trail from the South. Unfortunately for Mr. Tunstall, the wheels of his old rig hadn't been as cut out for the rough terrain as the salesman made them out to be, and he soon found himself with a busted front wheel outside his store. \"Damn...\" He muttered, stepping out of the buggy to assess the damage. \"Held up longer than I figured they would.\" Richard said, hopping the corral fence and hurrying over to offer up his assistance. \"Aye. It was only a matter of time I suppose.\" John nodded with a sigh. \"That con of a blacksmith will charge ya extra for every knick and dent he finds.\" Dick told his friend. \"I can fix her up real nice for ya myself. Consider it a favor.\" \"You'd do that for me would you?\" John asked, surprised. \"Sure.\" Dick nodded. \"Do onto others as you would have them do to you. Luke 6:31. Ain't that right?\" John cracked a smile and nodded. \"That it is, my boy.\" He replied. Dick fixed up the broken wheel as good as new by that evening, just in time for Mr. Tunstall to be locking up the store for the night. \"Fine work, my young man.\" John nodded approvingly, admiring the new wheel. \"Well you can thank my Pa.\" Dick told him, approaching the tall black mare John had hooked to his buggy and giving the underside of her chin a good scratching. \"He was always pretty handy with a hammer. Taught me a little back home.\" \"He taught you well.\" John replied, stepping back and watching Dick with the horse. \"If you don't mind me asking, my boy...\" He started to say. \"You seem to have quite a way with horses. How are you with cattle?\" Dick shrugged and rubbed the black mare's neck. \"Alright I reckon.\" He replied. \"If I remember correctly it was ranch work you came out here to find is that right?\" John then asked him. Dick nodded. \"Yeah. Figured I'd get a place of my own one day or another.\" He said. \"Guess that ain't gonna happen though. Land prices got a funny way of goin' up on a fella.\" He dug into his pocket and fished out a sugar cube for the horse, who excepted it gratefully. \"Well if you'd settle for work on another man's outfit, I'm in need of a good foreman.\" Mr. Tunstall mentioned. Dick turned to look at him, taken aback by the suggested. \"You offerin' me a job Mr. Tunstall?\" He asked. \"That I am, my boy.\" John nodded to him, extending a hand. \"What do you say?\" It didn't take a lot of thought. Dick took the man's hand and firmly shook it, agreeing to his offer with the brightest smile his hardened face had ever worn.

That was until one of the girls Billy knew all to well came up to him grabbing his hand and leading him back to her place. Billy should have known better, but knowing him couldn't turn down an Mexican dove. He should have though because it was a set up. Billy woke up with a start going to grab for his gun, but it wasn't there. \"Looking for something kid?\" a voice he knew too well said. Billy got out of the bed pulling up his pants. Billy let out a short laugh, \"Well it looks like you found me Patsy.\" Pat glared at the kid, \"I wouldn't be laughing if I was you kid.\" His voice low as he pulled out his six shooter. Billy had a little bit of amusement in his voice when he spoke, \"You gonna shot me Patsy?\" Pat cocked his gun, \"That's the plan kid\" \"Its dark in here Pat, how are you going to be able to get a good clean shot at me?\" Billy said with a smirk. \"I'll take my chances.\" Pat replied.

A sudden shuddering in the ground made him look up and he spotted a large herd of bison with a few antelopes running by. He was wondering what would make such large creatures run suddenly in a panic when he heard a loud screech. He looked up into the starry night sky and saw an impossible sight. A large eagle-like creature made entirely out of fire was flying low enough into frightening the other animals into running around. Thrusting its tail about it killed a large male buffalo, killing it in its fiery talons instantly. He watched as the creature consumed its kill, then shivering, he turned to look at his fire only to find it nothing but glowing embers. \"Oh, no! I will freeze,\" he said. Plop. A large piece of buffalo meat fell in front of him. Then, a small flame appeared in the embers, flared, and leaped to life as a full-fledged fire in front of him. Billy gulped, then looked around. He soon saw a girl with her hand in the embers, looking at him with eyes of pure silver. The girl pulled her hand out of the embers and sat down. Billy pulled out his gun, pointed it at her and said, \"Who are you, what are you, and what do you want with me?\" Looking at him calmly she said, \"My name's Areana, and you don't have to fear me.\" Putting away his gun, he said, \"I don't fear anyone, you just startled me is all.\" Looking to the fire he said, \"Thanks for restoring it, and the buffalo.\" He then took out his knife, sliced off a hunk, put it on a stick and began to cook it. Billy looked at her and said, \"You still have not told me what you are.\" Looking at him, she smiled and said, \"You have not yet told me your name.\" \"My name is William. William H. Bonney.\" She looked at him and said, \"Nice to meet you William,\" and said, \"I am a phoenix, and am often confused for my cousin, the thunderbird, by the local natives.\" Eating his buffalo meat, William looked at her and said, \"But why are you here, and why help me? Not that I'm not grateful,\" he added quickly. Looking into the fire, she said, \"One you would have froze to death out here, and two, you are all alone which is intriguing. Why are you out here all alone?\" \"Mom is going to marry a man I don't like. He seems too strict for my liking.\" \"Why? Where is your real father?\" the phoenix asked. \"I don't know, he just up and left; disappeared.\" They sat until sunrise and she left as a herd of gazelle went by. William awoke, saw she was gone and dousing the fire, went back to his family. 1874 Silver City, New Mexico Four years later... \"Billy, look, a freak show!\" said Sombero Jack, Billy's best friend. \"What?\" said Billy as he looked at the passing Circus wagons on their way to set up. He saw a familiar girl in a cage of iron, furiously trying to melt an iron shackle on her left ankle. Turning, she saw Billy and let her eyes flare silver again, and then return to normal. As they passed, Billy's friend said, \"What a freak,\" and started to go back to work. Billy stood for a second, and then turned to his friend and said, \"That is no freak, that's a living myth and she once saved my life.\" Chapter 2. That night... \"You! Fire monster! How do you like your new home?\" said a short bearded man as he laughed and prodded her with an incense stick. \"Come on,\" he drunkenly said, \"Turn for me you ball of smoke, ha,ha,ha.\" \"Stop jabbing me you fat loser,\" said the phoenix. Angered at what she had said, the fat man said, \"I'll do what I want!\" He lit a smaller stick and threw it in and fanned the smoke right on her. Giving an angry shriek, she lunged, sparks popping and spitting all over the cage but was stopped just shy of the man by the iron shackle. \"Ha, ha, ha, not so tough now!\" he spat. \"Neither are you!\" said a voice behind him. Turning around, the drunk man said, \"You little brat, that'd be 50 cents, now!\" \"I did not come to gawk at her, I came to free her,\" said the boy, leveling the gun at the man. \"Now let me friend go!\" The fat man laughed at him and said, \"You don't know how to shoot, that's for men like me not little boys like you, hahaha.\" The drunkard was laughing so hard he stumbled backward against the cage bars. \" Agghh!\" gasped the Freak Show owner as the phoenix wrapped her hand around the glob of fat that he called a neck. \"Now you will suffer an indescribable amount of pain,\" hissed the ancient bird, and ripped the keys from the necklace around his neck, unshackled herself and unlocked the cage. Then she pushed the man away and climbed out. \"Hey! You can't do that, you're mine, I own you!\" he shouted. At that, the phoenix erupted in a furious blast of fire to reveal a 12 foot tall bird with an eagle-like beak and flames that were like feathers on her body. \"I belong to no one! Least of all a drunken boozing money grubber like you,\" and made him burn from the inside out. Returning to a more human form, she turned to him and said, \"Thank you for saving me.\" \"You're welcome,\" Billy said. \"You saved me once, and now we are even.\" \"Yes, and now I will find the loathsome rat who put me here.\" \"Who was it?\" asked William with curiosity. \"The medicine man of the Navajo tribe, Singing Wolf,\" and just saying the name made her so angry that she set the hay in the cage ablaze. \"I'll help,\" said William solemnly. Looking at him she said, \"Again, my thanks.\" Just as she started to leave, he grabbed hold of her wrist and said, \"Wait, I'm working on a ranch and they have a barn you can stay at for a day or two while we try to find this man named Singing Wolf.\" She looked at him and said, \"Why do you want to help me? Not that I'm not grateful, of course.\" Billy looked at her and said, \"Well, you're interesting.\" She said, \"Very well. But if we do find him, no interfering, and no quarter shall be given. Got it?\" William looked at her and said, \"Okay, I get it.\" Chapter 3. The next day, as the phoenix slept at the top of the barn, Billy's friend Sombrero Jack came over and said, \"Is that your friend?\" He asked, looking at her in awe. \"Yes, but be nice, okay?\" said William. Jack looked at him and said, \"I'm always nice, especially to the señioritas.\" Later in the evening... Billy and Jack were having dinner and they brought some to the phoenix, just as she was waking up. \"Thanks, that's appreciated, but I'm going out hunting, I'll be back at dawn.\" Climbing down the ladder and walking out in front of the barn a few steps, flames burst out around her, then when they settled, a majestic creature with flame-like feathers and silver eyes stood before them. She then turned, and soared off into the night. \"Oh Billy, I fear your friend is a demon, like El Chubracabra, only worse.\" \"No, she saved my life and she could have killed the entire Freak Show but she didn't, just that horrid owner,\" he said in disgust. Meanwhile, the phoenix was chasing a springbuck and slamming into it, killed the animal with her 7-inch talons. As Areana was eating the animal, a tall young warrior sat in the dark and watched as she ate like a starving man. He watched as she took down three gazelles and a small buffalo and was finally full. She turned into her human form and turning to where the young warrior was hiding said, \"You might as well come out and un-knock that arrow from your bow.\" Standing up, he walked over, arrow still in his bow and said, \"You are the cousin to the Great Thunderbird and yet you killed three warriors from my tribe, and threatened us. Why?\" Looking at him she said, \"They were trying to control me and I did not threaten anyone but Singing Wolf. You can save a lot of grief for your people, just tell me where he is,\" she practically growled. \"No, I will not betray him, you will not have your revenge, fiery bird.\" Glaring at him she said, \"Yes I will, they tried to kill me but instead locked me out long enough to be put into a Freak Show, and for that he will pay. Tell him, I will catch him and he will suffer.\" She then turned back into her true form and flew off. Chapter 4. Six weeks later... \"Run! The bird of fire is here!\" People ran screaming in fear, gathering this way and that like rats in a sinking ship. Then, the men came and drew their arrows, pointing them at the strangers. The phoenix sat on a grey horse, Billy sat on a brown horse, and Jack was on a white horse with a brown spot on his left flank. Looking at the men, she said, \"Tell me what I want to know,\" in a calm voice, her pupils glowing silver. One of the men rode forward and said, \"You will not threaten my people anymore. I have your weakness.\" The young warrior took a stick of incense and lit it. He then held it up and said, \"Now go, and give no more thought to vengeance.\" He then threw the stick at her. It missed and landed on a small bear-patch behind her. \"I'll get it,\" said a five year old girl, and ran over to pick it up. \"No, Little Running Bird!\" yelled the warrior and got off the horse to run to his daughter. Picking up the stick, she walked over to the ancient bird, looked up, smiled, and in broken English said, \"Hello, my name is Little Running Bird, what is your name?\" Reaching down, she picked up the girl and placed her on the horse. \"My name is Areana, and it is nice to meet you. You have manners, something your dad needs to work on.\" Taking the stick, Areana said, \"Thank you for this, now go to your dad.\" Placing her on the ground, Areana watched as she ran to her dad, who hugged her tightly. \"You spared my daughter, why?\" he asked. \"The girl is innocent, and she does not need to pay for her father's stubborn refusal to give me Singing Wolf.\" \"No! Do not give into her demands,\" said a warrior with a red feather on his wrist. He sat glaring at her. Glaring back at the young warrior, she said, \"And who are you that dares to try denying me of my revenge?\" Riding forward to stand with the first warrior, he said sitting up proudly, \"I am Screaming Wind, son of Chief Thundercloud.\" \"Great, the Chief's son. You can't touch him now,\" said Sombrero Jack. \"He is not the one I am going after, but he knows where that backstabbing medicine man is,\" said Areana coolly. \"Why do you not like Mr. Singing Wolf?\" asked the little girl innocently. Looking at the girl, the phoenix said, \"Because young one, he broke his word and hurt me very badly.\" Then she looked at the girl and said, \"What is your father's name?\" The little girl looked up to the woman on the horse and said proudly smiling, \"It is Laughing Fox.\" \"Thank you,\" she said and then turned to the girl's father, and let her eyes flare again. Looking as serious as a tornado she turned to the girl's father and said, \"You know what I can do. I won't do it here and you can thank Little Running Bird for that, but you have until the next time the noon turns to night and then no more mercy.\" They turned, and as they were leaving, one of the young warriors broke away and shot her in the back. Calmly, she reached around, pulled it out and turned and said, \"What's your name?\" Sitting proudly he said, \"It is Joseph Eagle Feather.\" \"Well Joseph,\" she snarled, \"Next time it will take more than just incense and a child to protect you.\" Facing forward again, the three rode out of the village. After half a mile she had Billy hold the stick. Looking at it, he said, \"Why not drop it if it hurts you so much?\" Holding herself up, she said, \"I am trying to build an immunity to it, and it would burn the scrub brush to ashes.\" That night, flying high over head, enjoying the freedom of the night sky, Areana felt an odd coldness where Joseph had shot her, and realized he had mixed in ashes from the medicine man's blessing bag with the arrow. Falling swiftly, she barely managed to land without breaking anything, or setting anything ablaze. Turning human, she reached back and could feel the arrow tip lodged in there, but could not remove it. Letting out a screech of rage, she tried again to rip it out. Unbeknown to her, though, a warrior and his medicine man father were riding towards her. Chapter 5. \"Where is she? I thought she was always back before sunrise,\" said Jack with a puzzled frown. Looking around, William said, \"Normally, yes. She must be out enjoying the morning sunrise though.\" Meanwhile at an Apache tribe's camp... The phoenix lay out cold in an iron cage. \"What do we do with her?\" asked a young warrior looking at the cage. \"I will tend to her wounds,\" said a tall older man of 60 years. \"No, she will kill you!\" cried a girl in horror. \"Worry not, sister. Father has seen what will happen and if we help this immortal being now, she will help us later.\" Her father looked at her and said, \"First, Summer Moon, you must make this potion. It will help her heal but keep her in human form for three days, and she will be most vicious during those days.\" \"Then we'll keep her in the cage,\" said the warrior seriously. \"No, she must trust us,\" his father said, just as seriously. Looking at the cage, the warrior said, \"What is wrong with the fire bird?\" His medicine man father said, \"She was hit with an arrow made of a branch of a scrub brush plant and mixed with objects like ground rabbit bone and what the missionaries call holy water: sage, dust and incense.\" Meanwhile... \"Billy look! Light scorch marks and hoof prints!\" said Jack. \"Yes I see that, and they lead to that Apache camp, the one not far from the town's water supply.\" \"Yea, I know that one. Come on, let's go.\" \"You don't think they would hurt her, do you?\" asked Jack. Billy shook his head and said, \"It's more like she might hurt them. She has a temper sometimes.\" Jack looked at his friend with a smirk and said, \"Would you say...it's fiery?\" Billy just rolled his eyes and groaned. Toward mid afternoon... Blinking her eyes, the phoenix tried to move her arms but found them chained to the cage bars in front of her. Instantly, a screech of rage ripped from her throat. She tried to change but found the shackle prevented it, although they did spark a lot. No! How did they find me? How do they know this metal can hold me and why did they not dispose of me yet? In anger, Areana tried one more time to change, but only a small amount of flames appeared, then her energy was spent and she could no longer keep up the thin veil. As Areana lay trying to recover a woman's voice said, \"You are awake, that's good.\" Looking up, she saw a tall young girl of 18 or 19 years holding a small tub of something and smiling kindly at her. \"Release me, I have done nothing to you,\" Areana said carefully. \"I'm sorry, but we are trying to help you. You have an arrow tip lodged in your back. It has ingredients from a blessing bag on it and is slowly killing you.\" \"What is your name?\" the phoenix said warily. \"I am Summer Moon, daughter of Frozen Lightning and sister to Mountain Thunder.\" Glaring past her, the phoenix let her eyes glow silver and said, \"So you sent in your own child to do your dirty work.\" A tall muscular man of 60 walked in. He looked at her and said, \"You know I am a medicine man, and you know I can help you, but will you help us?\" Giving a fierce hiss, she yanked backwards but the shackles held rattling like the dry bones of dead animals in the wind. \"Let me go now!\" she screeched in rage, and tried again to change, but only made sparks dance like ferries across the cage. When she was spent, she could feel the cold increasing its grip. Frozen Thunder looked at her and said, \"Will you help us or not?\" Glaring furiously at the medicine man she said, \"With what?\" \"We have a common enemy. His name is Singing Wolf.\" Glaring at him, she said, \"But what's the catch? You're a medicine man. You don't help those outside the tribe without a payment.\" Looking at her, he said, \"The catch is you will temporarily lose your ability to change form between human and what you are.\" Growling in fury she glared at Frozen Thunder and said, \"You think I am stupid? That would leave me almost able to do nothing!\" In walked a tall muscular boy of 19 or 20 who was clearly a warrior and he said, \"The tip of the arrow is killing you every time you use your powers. \"You can't get the revenge you desire if you die,\" said Summer Moon with a sad look on her face. I'm growing weaker, they are correct about that, Areana thought bitterly. \"Fine,\" she said. Summer Moon walked forward and said, \"It will heal you, but also make you sleep—just for now. You will awaken at sunrise tomorrow.\" \"Worry not. We wish to have a trust between us,\" said Mountain Thunder. Taking the cup, Areana drank the contents in one gulp, gave it back to the girl, and looking at Frozen Lightning she said, \"If two men show up, one white tall and skinny and his name is William, and his friend, a medium sized Mexican named Jack, they are my friends, make sure no one hurts them.\" They all sensed the implied threat and Frozen Lightning said, \"No harm will come to them if they arrive before she awoke.\" Soon the phoenix was asleep. Opening the cage, Frozen Lightning pulled out an Eagle's feather to see if she was truly asleep. Seeing that the fire bird was truly under the potion's effect, he felt for the arrow's tip and pulled out a knife made with iron fitted with a handle made from a springbuck's antler. He cut the flesh around the tip and was immediately hit with a blast of heat from the creature's back. Looking at his two children he said, \"Hold her, she may be under the potion's effects but she could still be dangerous.\" Chapter 6. He found the arrow's tip, and cutting delicately, removed it. Patching her wound back up, he cleansed it and uttering a prayer to the thunderbirds for her recovery climbed out and said, \"Close the cage door and let the ancient one rest.\" Looking at her father, Summer Moon said, \"What will she eat, what could we possibly feed her?\" He looked at her and said, \"She's a predator, so she will eat meat. We will teach her to hunt like we do until she can regain her true form.\" \"Will the firebird help us?\" said Mountain Thunder, eyeing the sleeping Phoenix with skepticism. Turning to look at the Phoenix, and then back at his son, said, \"She will.\" The next morning... \"Look Billy, there it is, the Navaho tribe that lives by the river.\" \"Yeah, Jack, and if they hurt my friend, I'll make them pay,\" growled Billy. Riding into the village, Billy and Jack saw children working on baskets with their parents or playing and looking up at them with careful uncertainty. Women looked at them with open curiosity and watched as they passed by. The two men saw a Teepee in the middle of the village with a picture of a thunderbird on it and rode toward it. \"They must have her inside,\" said Jack. Billy nodded his head and said, \"Yea, let's go take a look.\" As the two got closer a beautiful woman came out holding a bucket with a wet rag in it. She stopped startled for a few minutes, seeing the two men on horseback. Billy tipped his hat and said, \"Sorry to scare you miss.\" Jack bowed and said, \"Didn't mean to scare ya.\" She blinked and then said, \"You two must be the ones the firebird told us about.\" From off to the right, a voice said, \"They are.\" Frozen Lightning and Mountain Thunder came walking out of their Teepee. As the sun rose Frozen Lightning introduced Summer Moon and Mountain Thunder, his son and daughter, to Billy. Billy and Jack in turn introduced themselves to the three natives. Looking at the Teepee, Billy said, \"So why is the Phoenix in the tent? She likes to be outdoors.\" Mountain Thunder looked at Billy and said, \"It is for her own protection.\" Billy looked at him and said, \"What do you mean 'for her own protection'?\" The young man glared at Billy and said, \"She had an arrow tip in her back that had been dipped in a blessing bag and it was killing her. My father gave her a potion to make her sleep until sunrise this morning, until he could get it out. When she wakes, she could still be dangerous, and the others might fear her too much to allow her to be awaken.\" Jack looked at the tent, and then looked at Billy, knowing how loyal he was to his friends. He wasn't sure how Billy would take this. Just then the sun crested over the mountains, flooding the area with bright blinding sunlight that shown up past directly into the Phoenix's cage. Chapter 7. Vwwoosh! Flames erupted within the cage, engulfing the firebird and the tent. The flames danced and twisted but did not move beyond the perimeter of the tent. \"No!\" shouted Billy and Jack as they leapt off their horses, and started to run toward the cage, only to be restrained. Just as Billy was going for his gun, the Phoenix woke up, shook off the flames, yawned, and looking at the small group standing in front of her, she casually asked, \"Is it morning already?\" Letting Billy and his friend go, the natives watched as Billy walked over to the cage and said, \"Are you okay?\" He was in shock because she looked completely unharmed. Looking at Billy, she said, \"I'm swell. This one can be trusted.\" After cooling the cage off, they let Areana out. She stood up, and Jack said, \"Are you hungry?\" She said, \"Famished. What's for breakfast?\" Four hours later, she was full, after eating a large buffalo, two impala, and two rabbits. Walking up to her, but still cautious, Frozen Lightening said, \"Now that you are full, will you listen to what we need to tell you?\" The Phoenix looked at him and said, \"Okay.\" She, Billy and Jack sat down to listen. The medicine man explained what he had done to help and then explained why he needed Areana's help. At the end of it all, Billy said, \"So he was your friend, and once part of this tribe, but he got consumed by a need to have power, and tried to kill the family?\" \"Yes,\" said Mountain Thunder, who was also sitting with his father and sister. His eyes were bright with remembered betrayal. \"So what does that have to do with the Phoenix?\" asked Jack as he chewed on a piece of buffalo. Turning to look at Jack, the Phoenix said, \"He used a spell to summon me and tried to kill me so he could gain my abilities—to take my power. When that did not work, well, you already know what he did,\" she hissed in anger, he hands reflexively twitching, as her talons would be. \"So where is he?\" Billy asked. The medicine man looked at him and said, \"I don't know, but now is a time of vulnerability for the firebird, because for the next three days she will not be able to turn into her true self.\" The two men looked shocked and Jack said, \"How can she defend herself in battle?\" Billy said, \"She'll be completely helpless.\" Areana rolled her eyes and said, \"Not completely, I do know how to fight without using my abilities and I can use a weapon if necessary.\" Jack looked at her and said, \"How do you know how to fight like a human?\" Looking at the Mexican and the sombrero hat she said, \"I've seen enough kings and leaders fight and train to be able to hold my own,\" she said with a grin on her face. For the next two days, Billy, Jack and Areana learned how to track and hunt the way Frozen Lightning's people did, and at night sat around the fire listening to stories, especially those of the thunderbird. Chapter 8. Upon sunrise of the third morning, a familiar brash young warrior snuck toward the village. Looking around, he spotted the firebird standing just outside the village. She was facing the sun, eyes closed, letting the light shine on her and would not be able to react quickly enough, if he attacked her. As he got close enough to attack her they both heard a voice shouting, \"Look out!\" Reacting in a microsecond, Areana turned and grabbed the man, her eyes glowing silver, hissed, \"Your boldness is exceeded only by your stupidity,\" and broke his arm. Screaming in agony, the warrior said, \"You are a violent creature, you will never get Singing Wolf! He was right to try and steal your abilities!\" Grabbing him by the throat, she said, \"There are those that wish to talk to you, be grateful for that.\" She dragged him back to the village. \"Look! She has a Navaho warrior!\" said Billy as Areana and her captive came up to them. With a snarl, she dropped him at their feet, and gave him a good vicious kick in the leg. \"You! How dare you come back here!\" Mountain Thunder said. Grabbing the young man by his hair, hauled him to his feet. \"Hey, that's Joseph Eagle Feather!\" said Billy as the young native was thrown on the ground in front of the group again. Turning to Summer Moon, Areana said, \"Thank you, if not for your intervention he may have gotten in a lucky strike.\" Spitting on the ground, a curl to his lips, Joseph Eagle Feather said, \"You were looking at the sun, and did not even twitch as I got close. With your lack of focus, I know you have no powers,\" he laughed. \"Silence!\" said Frozen Lightning in a low angry tone. \"You tried to kill the firebird and brought dishonor upon what was once your clan. Now, tell us where Singing Wolf is.\" \"Never! Never will you or this creature know where he is!\" Glaring at the man, the Phoenix said, \"What if we fought for the information hand to hand, no weapons, no interference from others.\" He looked at her and said, \"The first one to go down loses, and if you win I will give you the information.\" What no one noticed was another warrior crouched down between two boulders listening to the conversation. He got up and in a crouch ran back to his horse, which was just outside the village, and rode to give the information he had to Singing Wolf. He thought to himself , so the firebird is helpless. This will interest Singing Wolf very, very much. Chapter 9. Later that afternoon... \"Be careful, he is very dangerous,\" said Jack nervously. \"We'll be right here if you need us,\" said Billy, testing his gun's weight. Looking at the two men, she said, \"Thanks, but this is a fight that I need to win on my own.\" Mountain Thunder came in and said, \"It is time.\" They all walked out of the Teepee and Areana walked into the fighting circle. Joseph Eagle Feather was already there, smiling nastily. Pointing at her, he said, \"Now we shall see who's truly stronger. What can you do without your powers? You are weak, ancient one.\" She glared at him and said, \"I seem to recall snapping your arm like a dried twig.\" They fought and even with one arm, he managed to almost bring her down a couple of times, but she always pushed him back and fought with all the moves she had mastered over the centuries of life. He grabbed her behind the back and said, \"Give up, you are too weak to stop me.\" Snapping her head backwards, she hit him in the mouth making him lose his grip. She turned around and grabbing him by the throat said, \"You are in no position to talk.\" She pushed him back, grabbed his good arm, pulled him forward and punching him in the mouth hard, made him fall to the ground with five broken teeth. Both combatants were covered in blood and dust. Looking down at him, she said, \"You lost. Tell us now.\" He said, \"No. Singing Wolf will defeat you easily without your abilities.\" Then he stood up, made like he was going to attack her again, and charged. At the last minute, he pulled out a hidden onyx blade and threshed it into her shoulder. Snarling in rage and pain, she flipped him out of the circle in front of everybody, making him land on his already broken arm. She walked over and said, \"Like grandfather, like grandson,\" and then snapped his wrist on the other arm. He screamed in agony and said, \"No! I can't let you get your revenge! All he ever wanted was to keep everyone safe from you and the thunderbird!\" Everybody looked at them with curiosity. Areana said, \"That old legend was started by a crazy warrior who ate way too much peyote. And that was 300 years ago. The idea of the thunderbird and I going insane and trying to take over the world is laughable!\" They put the Navaho in the Phoenix's cage and Frozen Lightning said his injuries would keep him in agony for at least a month. \"You beat him!\" said Billy jumping up and down with glee. Looking over at Jack, he said, \"Come on over, she's not gonna hurt ya!\" He congratulated her and realized Billy was right, that she was nothing like a chupacabra or a demon. Looking back at Joseph, Mountain Thunder said, \"Now talk to us, or when she regains her abilities we will let her consume you.\" Realizing he was defeated the Navaho warrior said, \"Singing Wolf is out in the desert.\" \"Where?\" asked Billy sternly. \"Away from the tribe, but he knows about your weakness,\" he spat and grinned at the Phoenix. She smiled at him coldly and said, \"Today's the last day that holds true. And as for your partner, I'll make sure he burns to a crisp.\" As the sun set, Billy said, \"Before we do anything we have to get that blade out of your shoulder.\" Chapter 10. The Phoenix looked at the blade and glared. She could feel it in there and knew that it would eventually kill her if it didn't come out. Frozen Lightning approached and said, \"May I examine it?\" She said, \"Yes.\" Looking at the onyx blade, he said, \"It has the same effect the onyx blade would have on us, except it turns her blood to smoke long enough for a lot to spill out.\" \"But what do we do now?\" asked Jack. \"We will perform a healing dance,\" said Frozen Lightning. \"Will she survive it?\" asked Billy. \"That remains to be seen,\" said Frozen Lightning. Half an hour later a large fire blazed in the center of the village, the natives danced and Frozen Thunder grasped the handle, chanting he said, \"Ready yourself!\" He pulled hard, extracting the blade. Areana let out a screech of pain and rage and flames danced in frenzy all over her, then died down. \"Look, your blood!\" said Jack with a look of horror. Smoke poured forth from the wound in copious amounts. \"Quickly! She needs the wounds closed!\" said Summer Moon. The woman gave Areana a cup filled with herbs and the blood of a buffalo, a springbuck, and a rabbit. \"There is no time,\" she said, \"Please trust us.\" Giving an icy glare, she drank the stuff down, and the blood smoke immediately slowed to a small trickle. Working quickly the medicine man sowed up the cut, stopping the flow. Pulling the string out, he sealed it shut with an ember from the fire. Then, stepping back he said, \"By tomorrow you will be your normal self, will release the potion, and then find our common enemy!\" The next day... The suns rays struck the village, lighting it like a crystal chandelier lights a fancy room. The Phoenix burst into a great flame, like a brush fire. The flames died down as quickly as they came, and there she stood, a true firebird once more. Then, as Frozen Thunder had said, she released the potion into the fire pit. Billy saw this and came running over and said, \"Areana, are you alright?\" Standing up, she wiped her mouth and said, \"Oh yes, I am quite good.\" Her eyes glowed silver and then back to normal. \"Good, you are yourself once more,\" said Frozen Lightning. \"Now it is time to go after our common enemy.\" She turned to him and said, \"I may not trust all medicine men or their children but you three have earned some measure of my trust.\" She exposed her neck. Frozen Lightning placed an onyx blade on her throat and then after a minute of two he removed it and Areana straightened back up again. They got on their horses and raced off to find Singing Wolf. Chapter 11. After three days of searching and hunting one of the neighboring tribes pointed them into the direction of what's known as the Singing Scrubs. It was almost sunset, and there in front of them stood Singing Wolf, Chief Thundercloud, and Screaming Wind. \"So you have found me,\" he said, \"But you will not defeat me.\" \"You have a chief who does not know that you sent three of his warrior to try to kill or control me, knowing they would die!\" she hissed. \"So it's true what the thunderbird told me in my dream last night,\" said the Chief. \"Now for what you did, and how you tried to use me, and how you tried to call the thunderbird as well, just so you could rule the world? Now you will suffer,\" she said in low, blood chilling tones. He laughed and said, \"No, now I will control you both,\" and through a pinch of blinding powder that created a temporary flash the horses reared up and naiad. Billy and Jack tried to control them. The Phoenix leapt off her horse and immediately burst into flames, showing her true form. With a shriek of rage, she flew in the air, and then dove down, talons extended. Singing Wolf ducked under a large scrub brush bush, which burst into flames as she grabbed it. He scrambled out and ran. She followed moving as fast as an ember in the wind. She slammed him into the ground and then turning back into her human form started squeezing his neck. Small bouts of flames scorched his shoulders. \"Ahhh!\" he screamed, and slashed at her with his obsidian knife but she jerked backwards avoiding the blade. Screaming Wind lifted an arrow, pointing at the Phoenix and Billy said, \"No you don't!\" and shot his hand making him drop the bow and arrow. Grabbing him, she said, \"I will leave you to my cousin's justice.\" There was a rumble of thunder, a spine-cracking boom, and then bolts of lightning shot down, slamming into Singing Wolf and Screaming Wind. Singing Wolf was killed. Screaming Wind was burnt all over his mid section and his leg, but he lived. Then saying to the Chief, \"You weren't a part of this. Now take your son and go. Don't worry about vengeance. It has been satisfied.\" Turning back to Billy and the others, she grinned and said, \"Thank you.\" She looked at Billy and said, \"You are a good friend. I wouldn't mind tagging along for awhile if you'd have me.\" Billy said, \"I'd be pleased to ride with somebody like you. You can stay as long as you wish.\" They got on their horses and rode off together.

Where they see there old friends but that doesn't mean they are happy about it. The warm heat of the California sun beat down on my arms, I stood for a moment and just felt the warmth, it was so much nicer someday than the New Mexico winter, this was my life, some days I didn't like it, but some days it was better than what I ever had, I reached up and picked a couple of peaches from the tree, setting them in the basket that I was given. It had been a year and I was glad to get away, Billy was still wanted, he was bigger than life to the young Mexican children here in California, all over he was admired by the boys and the young girls swooned, all of them would be swooning or imitating the Kid if they knew who he really was. I sighed again picking some more Peaches. \"Hey Catori your being looked for…\" I turned around and looked at my friend Teresa, she was a beautiful Mexican woman she and her husband moved out of Mexico for the Gold rush, and she had turned into my best friend, she was a good friend, it was better than having all boys all the time as friends, for a change I could talk about things. \"Really? Who would be looking for me?\" I said with a smile, I knew who was looking for me, and I knew when he got back, when he was around my spirit fluttered. \"Someone called your husband.\" She said smiling \"Jose has been looking for you most of the morning, he just got back from town.\" She and her husband Franco didn't know who we were and what we did in New Mexico and I didn't want them to know, so when people asked for our names he went by his alias Jose. I smiled back at her \"Where did he go?\" \"He went to the apple trees, since he couldn't find you he decided to just work and wait for you to find him.\" I laughed and shook my head 'of course.' I thought \"Thank you Teresa, I will go and find him.\" \"Hey are you and Jose going to have dinner with Franco and I tonight?\" \"Yes we will.\" I walked toward the apple side of the ranch and spotted him automatically, just like when we were little, his hair was longer I asked him when I noticed his hair getting longer to not cut it, I wanted it longer, and it seemed like every day he had gotten more handsome to me, he had his shirt around his waist having the heat beat down on his back and chest, his back was darker since we started work here he had gotten more muscle on his arms, he was still strong, young, and the kind of love I always wanted. At the moment he was facing away from me but I wasn't going to interrupt him, I stood and just looked at him, a smile pasted on my face 'God I love him.' 'Jose' Chavez Y Chavez was my husband now, and I loved every bit about him, he was no longer a Regulator and because he changed his name he was no longer associated with Billy the kid, and neither was I. I snuck up behind him as quietly as possible, I wanted to get the jump on him \"You still cant sneak up on me Catori even after so many years.\" He said not turning to look at me, I pouted but walked up and wrapped my arms around him, \"Teresa told me you were looking for me.\" He touched my hands before unwrapping himself to turn to face me \"I just wanted to see your face Chiquita.\" He was hiding something I could see it when I looked at him but just the fact he wanted to see me caused me to smile as I looked up at him \"We are still having Dinner with Franco and Teresa tonight.\" \"I know.\" He bent down and kissed me causing my stomach to flutter. Every time he made my stomach flutter just by one kiss. \"Tehila it a.\" I said in souix it meant to love very much \"I don't know what I would do without you.\" He smiled lightly and kissed me again \"I love you too.\" \"I am going to get back to work, be careful out here okay?\" He nodded to me smiling at me as I turned and walked back to work. \"I swear Catori there is no woman and man that love each other more than you and Jose do.\" Teresa said causing me to laugh as we went back to picking peaches \"Jose and I have a very intense relationship, we have known each other since we were babies and he was always protective of me, we have been through enough that nothing can really break us up.\" \"But do you two even look at the love between you two? Franco and I don't even have a relationship that you two have, and I love him dearly. Even when you two argue we see love.\" 'That is because you haven't been through what Chavez and I have been through.' I thought \"Well we have always been together it was just…expected, even our grandmothers predicted it.\" \"I want to know what kind of love life you two have anyway.\" I blushed \"I am not about to tell you that.\" That night Chavez and I sat down with Franco and Teresa where we had dinner and talked, Franco was a large man, while Teresa was small and skinny, Franco was larger around the middle more of a robust man, when I first met him I was intimidated by him, but he took Chavez and I in and took care of us treated us like family \"Jose, when are you going to take your wife out of here and start a normal life with her and…\" Chavez looked at me and took my hand \"Compared to what we had a while back ago this is normal.\" \"I just mean that you two are young.\" \"All the more the reason to work here on the ranch and make money then we can live the rest of our lives with money…the legal way.\" I said Chavez gave me a slight warning look and in return I gave him an apologetic one, Franco and Teresa smiled at the two of us \"You two are so different but so wonderful together… I asked her about it earlier today and she just said that you have been through enough, what is your secret?\" Teresa asked Chavez and he just smiled. I saw something shift in the corner of my eye causing me to look out the window something didn't seem right, there was no wind and the plants were moving \"Oh no.\" I whispered Everyone looked at me as I stood up from the table \"Cha…Jose.\" I said correcting myself as quickly as I could, Chavez stood up \"What is it Chiquita.\" \"There was movement outside, there is no wind.\" He looked at me with a worried look when the back door to Franco's and Teresa's house burst open causing all of us to freeze, Chavez stood in front of me \"Jose Chavez Y Chavez and Catori New Eagle, you are under arrest for the Murder of L.G Murphy and sheriff William Brady and the cause of the Lincoln county war…\" Teresa and Franco both looked at us with shock in there face, Chavez looked at me, he gripped my arm kissing my temple before two deputies ripped me away from him \"Wait! Teresa! Do you remember what you promised me?\" She nodded to me \"Do what you promised me, you and Franco, please…do this for me and take the note in my box next to my bed.\" Teresa with some tears in her eyes nodded to me as I was taken away \"You two both are very good at hiding, I didn't think we would be able to find you, it seems that you both made quite a life for yourselves.\" The hunter said I spit at him \"Go to hell!\" I yelled being tied by the wrists and thrown on the back of a horse, Chavez however didn't get the same treatment as I did he was forced to walk. All the way back to New Mexico. \"Well look at you Catori, it has been a while.\" I sat in the Lincoln Jail for five days, I was separated from Chavez as soon as we got there, there was a pit outside which is where I figured he was, I was sitting in the jail or questions on whereabouts (Which I had none), not to mention I was slapped around a couple of times. \"Hello bob, I would say so, you look like shit.\" I said seething \"That is no way for a lady to talk.\" \"Well I haven't been treated like a lady why would I talk like one?\" I looked at him again \"Where is Chavez?\" \"He Is fine, where is Scurlock?\" \"Who?\" I was slapped across the face again, by the time he had done it, he didn't even faze me. \"Don't play dumb you stupid Indian whore! Doc Scurlock you know where he is and I want to know!\" I blinked at him \"Oh…Doc? I don't know, he was getting married last I knew but then again I did too so I cant tell ya…maybe he is in Missouri, or Texas…I don't know things are fuzzy.\" \"What about Billy?\" My eyes narrowed \"I haven't given a second thought about that kid since Chavez and I moved to California, I already have a sentence to hell because of him.\" Bob looked at me to see if I was lying, he knew I was lying about Doc, I knew kind o where he was, but I was going to tell him that. \"I heard you and the Mexican Indian got married, I wonder what he would think if I threw you in a pit with Murphy men alone…\" \"He wouldn't like it very well, but what do you care what happens?\" \"Sir…We got Scurlock…\" Bob stood up and I was shocked 'They got him…Shit.' I thought. Bob looked at me \"Take her and put her with her husband and Scurlock, for when we get the Kid.\" I looked at him \"You Snake! I hope The kid shoots your ass!\" I kicked and screamed \"Don't put me in there! No! Put e down!\" The gate to the cage was lifted up and I was thrown in and as if I was going to get mauled by wild animals, men looked at me \"Look boys it's the Indian Whore!\" One guy grabbed me by the shirt and tried to lift my skirt of course I kicked and screamed, the smell of sweat, manure, and mud mixed almost making me sick \"Get the hell off me!\" He got on top of me and tried to lift my skirt up, I was hitting him as much as I could as he was messing with the button of his pants, just when I thought I was done for someone grabbed the man by the back of the neck and ripped him away from me. \"Touch her again and your head will be ripped off.\" A calm voice said, I looked up and wrapped my arms around him again \"You know we must stop meeting like this.\" He Looked at my face \"Who did this?\" \"Sheriff deputy decided to slap me around while asking me questions, thought that would make me answer him faster.\" He sighed and wrapped his arms around me and carried me to the corner and sat me down next to a familiar blonde in a suit \"Doc!\" I hugged him and he returned it to me \"Catori you're alright?\" ","Summary":" Spirits Ending A year after the Lincoln county war ends Chavez and Catori are married and working o"},{"Movie":"Young Guns","Title":"Yoohoo, Ill Make Ya Famous","Author":"IFoundHopeInYourHateForMe","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8894129","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: I do not own Young Guns This is my re-written verison of one of my older stories.

Bonney alias Billy The Kid.\" Charles smirked, \"Sure, well I'm Charles Phalen the lawyer you asked for.\" He held out his hand for a greeting. He got none. Billy looked Charles dead in the eye, \"You don't believe me do you?\" Charles laughed, \"No I don't, Billy The kid shot and killed 21 men and he was shot and killed by Pat Garrett. Everybody knows that, it's common knowledge.\" Billy shook his head getting irritated, \"There are other lawyers around, you piece of chicken shit. Get back in the vehicle of your's and drive before I make it 22 just for the goddamn hell of it!\" Billy was about to up and leave until Charles stopped his by placing his hands on the elder man's shoulders, \"Okay wait, if your really Billy The Kid show me some scars or better yet tell me how he or you managed to get out alive against Pat Garrett.\" Billy sighed as he placed himself back in his spot, \"Well son I think you better sit your ass down this is going to be a long story\" He cleared his throat about to tell his story, the memories came floating back to him. Pat Garrett sat alone in his own eaten' place, titled Garrett's Place. Just like he wanted. It was a Sunday none ever really came in on a Sunday. Suddenly the doors swung opened as a man who looked to be about in his early twenties walked in, looking like he just walked through a sand storm. \"Ya opened?\" He asked in a low voice. Pat couldn't see his face due to the fact that his hat was pulled down over half of his face. Pat stood from his spot, \"Yeah but I don't have much.\" Walking behind the bar he grabbed a glass and filled it with whisky. The young man took the glass from Pat's hand as he sat himself at the bar, \"Thank ya kindly.\" He downed the whisky as fast as it came. Pat refilled it, he then turned an poured some stew into a bowl handing it over to the stranger. He downed the food as if it was the first real meal he had in years. \"Hey are you Pat Garrett? You know the one that shot Billy The Kid?\" The man asked downing the second glass of whisky. Pat smirked, \"That would be me.\" He downed his own glass of whisky. The man smiled, \"Could I see the gun that done the kid in?\" Pat gave him a look but handed over his gun anyways, \"Be careful with it, she's my favorite.\" Pat said. \"So tell me about the kid.\" The man asked playing with the gun by aiming it at random things around the place. Pat shook his head, \"Not much to tell that people haven't heard.\" \"Really, nothing at all\" He asked aiming the gun at Pat. By this point Pat was annoyed, \"No, now give the gun back before you hurt someone.\" The man laughed. A very familiar laugh. \"Jeez Patsy, its like you don't know me at all.\" Pat's breath caught in his throat, \"Billy how the hell-\" Billy pulled off his hat, \"How the hell what Patsy. How I got out of the grave or how I'm alive?\" He held Pat at gun point. Now that Pat had a better look, he saw that Billy's shoulder was covered in dry blood and dirt. Billy smiled big, as he laughed, \"You missed my head Patsy, you only got my shoulder. I let them bury me Pat, and I waited long enough to dig myself out so I wouldn't have any of your men tracking me.\" Pat looked at Billy, his voice was low as he spoke, \"Why are you here kid? To kill me is that it?\" Billy shook his head, \"No Pat, I could never kill ya, I just want you to remember Pat, that you'll never be me.\" He started. \"You'll always be the man who thought he shot and killed Billy the Kid and that I made ya famous.\" he then smiled, \"Oh and I'm taking my gun back.\" He placed the gun that was in his hands in the holster attached to his belt. He then grabbed his hat and put it back in its spot on top of his head, turning on his heel and walking towards the door, only to stop at the sound of Pat's voice. \"You be killed out there Billy and this time it won't be me.\" Billy slightly turned his head, \"Well that's the chance I'm willing to take, Big Casino.\" He then walked out the door. Pat shook his head with a little smirk placed on his lips, \"Good luck Little Casino, you crazy sonuvabitch.\" \"Then what happened?\" Charles asked amazed by the story. Billy smirked, \"I stole his horse and took off.\" Charles looked at the elder Billy confused, \"That's it you, stole his horse and let him live? I thought you hated him for betraying you?\" Billy laughed, \"I never stole a horse from someone I didn't like. Did I like him? Hell no; I loved the son of a bitch.\" He took moment. \"You asked me if I have scars? Yessir, I have my scars and they will stay with me for the rest of my life reminding me of my past and of the ones who I lost and the ones I let live.\" Billy stood then, grabbing the reigns on his horse and started to make his way like he always done. Charles stood yelling for Billy, \"Henry?! Billy! Where are you going?!\" Billy never turned or answered him he just kept walking. No ones knows of what became of Billy The Kid after that. Most just say he died out there in the land he traveled on for most of his life. Others say he's still alive, waiting for his pals to return, to once again ride along side each other. \"Yoohoo, I'll make ya famous\" ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I do not own Young Guns This is my re-written verison of one of my older stories.

Gunshots ring out rapidly for a few minutes and then silence. The silence doesn't last for long however, the void of sound is filled with clapping and cheering. Jay's voice comes crackly from the speakers spread across the central town square. \"Thank you for watching the Wild West Horse Show. If you'd like to see it again you can at 5pm this afternoon. If you fancy yourself as a cowboy, outlaw or sheriff you can have your photo taken at the Photography building opposite the Saloon for just a few dollars. We hope you enjoy the rest of your day at the park and have a safe journey home.\" That's my queue to prepare for the mass of people wanting their picture taken in old period clothing standing next to the saloon doors, or a horse, or wherever in the park they wanted to. Looking up I notice my first few customers of the day, a family of four wanting to pose as cowboys and Can-can girls. After handing the appropriate costumes to each of them and showing them to the changing room I begin to prepare the photograph area. They've decided on sitting in a cart with two horses in front. Great the horses have been jumpy today; it's bloody roasting so they are irritable. I don't really want to have to work near them but I have to do what the customer wants or I'll lose my job. I don't particularly like my jobs but it pays ok and my boss is good to us, they're probably the only reasons why I am still working here, that and I need to pay for my education somehow, why I decided to move to America to go to university I don't know it seemed great two years ago but the costs had rapidly increased, it would have been far cheaper to stay back home in a England. The sound of footsteps and trotting hooves on the sawdust floor draw my attention to the figure of a man and two horses in front of me. \"Hey Jackie, here are the horses for ya, I've got to go clean out the stables before the next show. I'll see you when you're on your break.\" Frank says in his southern drawl. Nodding and smiling as I take the reins off him, Frank smiles back and salutes goofily at me before retreating towards the stables. A small smile still plays on my lips, that man can always brighten my day. By this point the family have emerged and are ready for their photo. After what seems like hours but are actually minuets I had managed to get several decent photos of the group much to my relief as the horses were growing more and more restless. Leaving Bonny and Jenny tied to the hitching post, I finish printing and selling the photos sending the happy customers on their way. Bonny and Jenny are now frantic at this point for no apparent reason. I exited my photography building to investigate, as I made my way down the wooden steps I noticed that one of the young children from the family I photographed before had dropped a stuffed teddy bear. Stupidly forgetting the fact that two restless horses where in front of it I bent down of retrieve it. Suddenly a loud neigh erupted from one of the now bucking horses and a sharp pain erupted in my head, taking my breath away completely causing my vision to blur. I shut my eyes in pain and I'm suddenly overcome by darkness. I must have blacked out as next thing I know a figure was stood over me blocking the bright painful sunlight but still leaving some of the clear blue sky viable as my eyesight starts to blur once more. I hear muffled shouting from the figure who was stood above me, I recognised him but didn't know why, I couldn't think of his name, I couldn't make sense of anything, which alarmed me. Someone was calling my name, but I couldn't focus, they were asking me if i was ok but for some reason I couldn't answer, the only thing I could focus on was the intense pain in my head and the strong drowsiness that has washed over me. I just wanted to sleep. Maybe if I slept the pain would go away, maybe i would be able to remember this man's name. Yes sleep was best. The last thing I registered before I welcomed the sweet emptiness of darkness was the man above me shaking me lightly and telling me not to sleep but to stay awake for the ambulance. The first thing I noticed when I awoke again was the blinding pain that was still in my head. The second thing was that I was lying on the ground. Thirdly that a crowd of people were now surrounding me. My vision still blurring as I struggled to make the people out. A hand placed on my shoulder makes me jump and let out a small squeal. \"Easy Miss McClain you took quiet a hit from that horse. I think you should see a doctor.\" A man's voice exclaims, I think it was the man whose was is on my shoulder. How does he know my last name? What happened? Where am I? The spinning jumbled shapes sharpen the face of a rugged dirty looking man became clear. He's dressed like the rest of the employees at the park only dirtier, as if he'd fallen over in the manure, revolting, he smelt vile too. I didn't recognise him as a fellow colleagues do his current personal hygiene would not be up to standard his line manager was going to be in big trouble, that's when I notice that I'm no longer at the park. I'm in a town, a town I recognised for some reason, everyone's dressed in 19th century clothing, horses and carts were milling about. I look down at myself. I am still wearing my uniform, well costume. I look like I belong here , the outfit fits in. The uncomfortable corset, and bloomers were underneath the dark blue dress. \"Miss Jackie I think it's best you see the doctor you look kinda pale and your heads bleedin, your uncle wouldn't be too pleased to hear you died before you see him\" the man spoke again, he spoke as if he knew me and what uncle is he on about they are all in England . My hand instinctively reaches to rub my throbbing head, I could feel my wavy dirty blond hair pinned up on top of my head, pulling my fingers away once more I notice the bright red liquid on them. Looking frantically around trying to find answers, failing to do so. It was like that book and TV show what was it called. Life on Mars. Was I dead, asleep in a coma, hallucinating, whatever it is I'm bat shit crazy. Oh god how was I going to get home, do I have to die, I don't want to test that, what if I died permanently? No I'm not going to even attempt that but what if I'm already dead. Is this hell, heaven, that man in the book was dead I think. That was fiction this is reality. Is it reality though? Confusing myself even more, perhaps the horse did really damage my head, it could have caused a bleed on my brain. Maybe I should go with this man, maybe I did actually belong here. But I don't think I do. I belong in a different century I think. Wait what year is this year; I've just assumed it was the 19th century. As these vast number of thoughts rush through my head I start to back away from the mystery man how had become rather too close to me for my liking. He notices the panic in my eyes and starts to walk towards me like I'm a scared animal. \"Miss Jackie I really think you should see a doctor you're not well.\" No they'll think I'm crazy. I'm not crazy this was some messed up dream which I needed to find a way out of and fast. Deciding it's best to depart the growing crowd and the no named weirdo, I look around for an escape route. I notice a dirt path running behind what appears to be a church, I quickly (as quick as this dress and boots would let me) sprit off into the wilderness. The onlookers too stunned to react. Looking back and noticing that no one followed I let out a sigh of relief. My relief was short lived however as another creepy man appears from nowhere and puts a hand over my mouth and for what seems to be the third time today I passed out again. Great.

So, I found inspiration for doing this book about a month or so ago, but I finally found myself writing it now. I hope you enjoy it and that you find it interesting as it will get more interesting as the story plot thickens. Please inform me about any grammatical errors that I make throughout this story and any suggestions you may have. Thank you! Prologue: ~Vivian~ \"Easy now, Viv. Don't want to let them know we are here, do ya'?\" asked my brother, his finger pressed against his lips as he kept his eyes on the unsuspecting Sheriff who had been sitting peacefully in his office. I rolled my eyes, slightly smiling before casting a devious grin at my older sibling. \"Oh, come off it, Jesse. He'll never see us coming.\" He grinned, his light brown eyes flickering with excitement as they always did when we were doing something adventurous. He was dangerous, I knew that as well as anyone, and he was not one to be crossed as well; though, I was the same as him when it came to that matter. I turned my gaze back to the window where we watched from across the street straight into the Sheriff's office. The Sheriff took a long and slow drink out of his bottle. He looked at a few papers, spitting on one in particular and throwing it across the room before leaving, slamming the door behind himself. \"Now, little sis!\" We both headed for the door of the abandoned house where we had been, thankful that we could find such a place so close to the Sheriff's office. It seemed it had been placed right into our hands perfectly. We headed down the street, letting the Sheriff pass us by without even a second glance before entering the office. My brother immediately ran to the desk across from the cells, after letting me walk in first. He set his bag on one side of the desk and began shuffling through papers, myself walking over to a cell and leaning against the strong bars. I waited a couple minutes, silence engulfing the two of us as my brother continued looking at the papers. \"You know, I'd be a lot more of a help if you told me what exactly we are looking for,\" I reminded after a few moments of silence, gripping my hand on one of the bars and looking over at him. It took him a couple of minutes to respond which was only a shake of his head. I groaned, looking out the window revealing the clear, beautiful day before back at him. \"Why? What is it that is so important?\" Silence. Of course. Always silence. He looked up at me for a moment, staring at me as if contemplating whether he should tell me or not. I really wished he would. He always told me everything and the fact that he was hiding something from me, made me worried and all the more anxious to find out what it is. \"Only in good time, sis. I know you want to know, but trust my judgment. You'll only know when you need to know.\" I rolled my eyes as he began sifting through papers once more. \"Well, because I apparently won't be much help to you, since YOU won't let me in, I'll take a look around.\" I walked over to the door, stopping when I had reached it. I turned my head to face him who was looking rather emotionless and nodded at me, not really paying attention or taking the time to care. That was even more irritating. I pulled the door open and slammed it closed behind me, wrapping my arms around myself. I was much more curious now. Though my brother wasn't the sweetest of men and I hated him more times than not, he always told me what was going on. Always. And lately, he hadn't been himself. Keeping to himself and muttering about God Knows What. He began shutting me out, and I wanted and needed to know what he was holding back and soon. Most of the folks walked calmly by me, not bothering to greet a stranger in their town. I expected as much. It was a large one to be fair, Marenisco. They probably didn't know an old face from a new one. That's why Jesse and I took so much pleasure in spending our time in highly populated towns. My gaze caught a long row of constables marching in the street, a carriage led by horses filing after them. My breath hitched in my throat, tilting my head slightly. What were they doing here? It was a peaceful town as Jesse and I had learned from folks right outside of it. There was no need really for more than a Sheriff and a Marshall. Any more would be only in dire need. There wasn't any crime going on unless... \"Well, I'll be...\" I muttered, not bothering to finish my sentence. My eyes had locked with gaze of one of the front men, a tall man wearing his large police hat on top of his head. He pointed at me to his fellows who now found their gaze on me as well. I knew what would come next. Backing up slowly, I turned around and started in a full-fledged sprint. Words of, \"Fire!\" and, \"Where's the other one?\" sounded behind me. I grounded my feet into the dirt, pushing harder into the ground for speed. A loud bang rang in the air as I felt air whiz by me. I winced but tried calming myself, keeping my stare on the Sheriff's office that grew closer and closer to me. Another bullet was released, hitting the ground right behind my right foot that had just sprang into a step. Now a few more were fired, and I was thankful each time as they had missed me. My steps were quicker now, I couldn't remember a time that I had been in such an open, life threatening position. Sure, I had been in my fair share of dangerous situations in my life, some even more dangerous than this very one; however, I had never been in one that I was so open and exposed. How was I not killed already? I'd thought for sure they'd have a perfect shot to kill me by now. Relief fell over me as I reached the steps that led to the door of the office. I marched up them quickly, bursting through the oak door and slamming it closed behind me. I leaned my back against it, catching my breath for a moment while my brother only stared at me. Once I could speak, I said, \" We're done for!\" \"Jesse and Vivian Jackson?\" called a voice far off from the door. My brother stared into my eyes, reading what had happened as he walked over to the window and peeked out it. I guessed he had spotted the men, because he pulled his gun out of his holster, cocked it, and glanced over at me. \"Uh, no, I haven't heard of no Jesse and Vivian Jackson. I'm sure they are a very handsome folk though,\" Jesse mocked, sarcasm dripping off his words. He winked at me in reassurance and I smiled at him. I pulled my gun out of its holster and joined him on the opposite side of the window. \"Jesse Jackson? I heard you were a cynical scamp. I thought you'd be glad to see your sister very much alive after we could've killed her,\" returned the voice. I took a side-long glance out the window to see the man (who I had assumed been the one speaking) approaching us closer and closer. Jesse aimed his gun out the window and shot at the ground in front of him, causing the man to flinch and back up. \"Keep you and your men back!\" Jesse yelled, hearing chatter amongst the men. The man, whoever he was (probably a Marshall of some sort), started off on a long speech but neither Jesse and I listened. We glanced around the office, looking for anything that could get us out of this mess. I knew we would, we always did; however, I didn't know how. My eyes fell on the candle lit on the edge of the Sheriff's desk. Jesse must have lit it as he looked through papers, but that mustn't be important. What was important was that an idea sprang into my head. \"Where's your bag?\" I asked Jesse, turning to face him. \"Why?\" \"Jesse!\" He nodded toward the desk.\"I set it down there earlier,\" he replied defensively. I rushed over to the desk, not bothering to acknowledge him as I did so. I grabbed the bag and pulled it open, going through it until I found what I wanted. I held it up for Jesse to see. His face first reflected one of confusion before recognition finally showed as he knitted his eyebrows together. \"Ball bombs?\" he asked, unsure of what I was thinking. I nodded as I tossed it at him, him catching it before it hit him in the face. I picked up the candle and made my way toward him, handing him the candle as well. I knew why Jesse was unsure of using them. I was unsure of using them myself. We had gotten them rather recently, a group of Chinese railroad workers bargained them for a cheap cost. It was cotton made into a shape of a ball, soaked in oil. Once it was ignited, it would be quickly tossed toward where we wanted it and sure enough, the air would be covered in smoke. It was harmless, as long as they didn't shoot and if they were smart, they wouldn't. \"You sure?\" Jesse questioned, pushing his hat so that it fit better on top of his head. I nodded, knowing that it was the best option we have. \"Of course.\" He cracked a smile while turning so that his side pressed against the wall, his head closer to the window. \"Didn't I tell you to get back?\" shouted Jesse, interrupting the long speech of the Marshall. He ignited the small device and threw it out the window, landing right in front of the Marshall. A long string of cuss words flowed out of that man's mouth before the smoke made them impossible to see. We relished in our victory for only a couple minutes before Jesse said, \"let's go.\" He grabbed his sack before opening the backdoor (which we were thankful for, not liking to make dramatic exits through windows) and we ran as fast as our feet could go. Okay, so what do you think? Be sure to review telling me what I did good and how I can improve. Critizism is welcomed! And again, please tell me if you spot any grammatical errors. Also, be sure to check my profile regularly when new characters or objects show up in the story for what they look like. It's not needed, but it may make the story a little easier to understand.

Ignoring the voice that was behind me. No. No. No! He can't be dead. No that him . I ran, and ran. I could hear my heart beat. The blood was rushing to my ears. My eyes were burning with the need of crying. I found myself in a cornered. A shadow came over me. Two big male hand grabbed my waist, pulling me to a hard chest. I heard the person trying to calm me down, playing with my hair. I couldn't keep it cover. I broke down. \"Alex, I am so sorry.\" Said Dick hugging me tighter. I could feel his on tears fall on my t-shirt. Why was he even crying? He always fought with Jay. It's not like he ever cared. He was his brother. Brothers fight. The voice inside my head says. \"I am sorry Alexandra, but Jason is dead.\" The voice of Bruce kept echoing in my head. Jason Todd was dead. And there was nothing I could do. You promised. You said that you were coming back. Liar. You are a liar. I cried harder Present Day, Gotham, Wayne Manor \"Maybe I could help you?\" \"Maybe you can shut up.\" I rolled my eyes at the two idiots fighting. They have been at it the entire day. Tim won't let Damian help, and Damian won't stop being an ass about it. \"Could you boys shut it? Damian,just leave Tim alone. Tim stop messing with Damian.\" I said in a harsh tone. Bruce had put me in babysitting duty since Dick did it last time. Tim was sick and in a prissy mode. While, Dami was angry that he got grounded for being too rough on a criminal. He shattered his collarbone and broke 3 of his ribs. Nightwing and Bats where both doing rounds. The orders are if we call, we need your help. It was only matter of minutes before they arrive. I started to walk towards the old grandfather clock. Opening it to the side. I walked carefully down the stairs trying not to make a sound. I saw both Dick and Bruce standing next to the bat-computer. Dick looked mad. While Bruce carried on with his usual stoic expression. \"She has to find out one day Bruce.\" Said Nightwing \"We both know her reaction. She will break just like before.\" Bruce said. \"But we all know she is stubborn. Once she gets a hold on something, she isn't letting go.\" Said another voice. It couldn't have been Dick, since it was too deep. And it couldn't have been Bruce, the voice was too harsh, for it to be calm Bruce. \"And we are all sure the Replacement and the Demon haven't snitched on me?\" The voice added. I could see Dick scowling at the direction the voice was. \"Yes we are sure of it.\" Bruce answered \"Or we would have a very pissed off assassin Alex on our hands. And we both know she can be merciless when she wants to.\" Dick added. \"Good. I don't want her to know just yet.\" Said the voice. Then there was a motorcycle tire screech. What is happening and who is that voice?[Chapter 2] Alex's POV Gotham, Alex's apartment \"Good. I don't want her to know just yet.\" \"Good. I don't want her to know just yet.\" \"Good. I don't want her to know just yet.\" This sentence has been echoing in my head since I got back to my apartment. I tied my jet black hair in a ponytail- not caring what I look like. I had to finish a report for Bruce that is due on Sunday, so I grabbed my laptop and started to write. After a few minutes I had an epiphany that I had nothing to actually write , I put my laptop to the side to grab something to eat in the kitchen. Just like the great Nightwing once told me; \" you can never go wrong with a bowl of cereal to help you think. \" I smiled at the memory of thirteen year old me rolling my eyes at the much older Dick Grayson being annoying and childish as usual. I grabbed my bowl of cereal and head towards the living room where I was working on my laptop. I looked at the open window that was closed just a few minutes ago. I put my bowl on the table and put my laptop back on my lap. Then I grabbed the bowl back into my hands I gasped, my eyes widen. I AM STILL HERE. ASK BRUCIE. I hear a noise behind me, I turned head only to see an old photo of me. And Jason. It was at my first Wayne party. Both of us where smiling and holding each others hands. We where about 10 years old. We looked carefree and happy. As if our lives where normal. Just a boy with a rich foster dad with a girl as a best friend. Wouldn't life be simpler if that was true? I felt my eyes water. My phone started to ring. I looked at the collar ID, Damon Evans. I smiled a bit at the name. \"Hey sweetheart.\" He said. \"Hey to you too babe.\" I said. A surge of gilt hit me. I looked back at the photo of Jason and me. He is dead remember. The voice said in my head. Jason's POV Outside of Alex's apartment, Gotham \"Stay away from her.\" Bruce had said. Me not giving a crap abut what he says or does, I went to the roof next to her apartment. I haven't seen her in 7 years. After I stopped my killing spree, and got clean up, I went to see her but I found out she was visiting her family in Russia. For an entire year. \"Hey to you babe.\" I heard her say. I glared at the phone, wanting to know who the hell was she talking to. If I would have brought my hood I could have found out who she was talking too. \"That's Damon Evans. Her boyfriend that she has been dating for two years.\" My annoying older brother said. \"How do you know that?\" I said still glaring at the phone while the dark haired girl laughed. \"He had dinner with us a few months ago.\" Dick said talking off his mask. \"Do you regret the decision?\" He added. \"Do you regret breaking up with StarFire?\" I said to him. Not caring if it hurt him or anything. He raised an eyebrow. \"Yeah, but it was what Bruce wants.\" I said. Dick scoffed. \"Since when do you care?\" He said looking skeptical. \"Since its Alexandra Sokolov or Alexandra Pierce. She is the best Bruce has ever train. She is his favorite protege. With Cass. \" I said, letting my anger show. \"First, ouch that hurts my first protege ego.\" I rolled my eyes. \"You'll get over it.\" I said. \"And second, you are invited to the next dinner we have with her boyfriend.\" He said with a smirk. \"When is it?\" I said mirroring his smirk. \"Tomorrow.\" And with that he was gone. Maybe I do want her to know now. A/N: I wrote this on the fly, this is my first story hear so please be merciful. I do think that Jason isn't really an asshole so that's why I wrote him like that. And yeah, Alex' s full name is; Alexandra Natalia Varvara Sokolov. But her fake name is Alexandra Natalia Pierce. She changed it because she is an ex- assassin. You will see more of her past and Jason's.[Chapter 3] Jason's POV Past Time. Crime Alley, Gotham I let the smoke come out. I flicked the cigarette. Another day that I am just a replacement. Another day where Dick is all high and mighty Another day where I am not Jason Todd, just the failed version of Richard Grayson. I took another drag. \"You have got to be kidding me! Are you really back into your emo, I am just a replacement, bull shit?\" An annoying female voice said behind me. Alexandra Natalia Varvara Sokolov, is the most annoying girl in the world. I tossed the cigarette and rolled my eyes. \"Fuck off.\" Was all I said. \"No, you fuck off.\" She retaliated. \"Don't you have somewhere to be the perfect girl?\" I said. \"I am far from perfect.\" She said chewing her lower lip. She started to twist her rings. A sign of anxiety. \"Why are you here?\" I asked her. She doesn't really likes talking to me. \"I need you to cover me. I have to leave town.\" Bruce will have a hissy fit when he hears about it. \"Why are you leaving?\" \"I have to resolve some things back home.\" \"Your dad?\" She nodded and grabbed my cigarette. \"They are thinking of letting him out. They want me and my mother to testify against him.\" She took a long drag. \"Well, if you need anything let me know.\" I said \"Why do we go from hating each other to being friends in a matter of seconds?\" She asked me. \"We are just us. Broken but still moving far. Life hates us but fuck it.\" I said. Alex chuckled. \"Yeah, we are just young gods.\" With that she grabbed my hand. We both just silently looked at the Gotham view. Oblivious of the things that were going to happen after this. Most of them good but shit happens. ","Summary":" Alex's POV * 7 years ago* \"Alexandra!\" I ran. Ignoring the voice that was behind me.

Dick often wondered if, had he acted different, would Jason have confided in him? Told him what he was doing? Perhaps Dick would have been able to prevent Jason's death. When Dick found out that Jason was still alive, it was like a second chance to him. Until he found out that he had came back damaged. He believed that no one loved him anymore. That they had let the Joker live because they didn't care. Jason was wrong, oh God, he was so wrong. Dick could count the times that he had headed off to Arkham, intending to finally kill the clown. But he never had. Dick couldn't explain why. It killed him at first, when Tim arrived. But then Dick reflected on his past mistakes, and he tried to be the best big brother he could. When Damian arrived, he did again. Dick never thought that his efforts to be the best big brother would finally break Jason. That the witty banter he made would trigger his little bro. After all, he never exactly knew what had happened in the warehouse that night. But Dick is kinda glad it did.[Chapter 2] WARNING: MENTIONS OF DEPRESSION, ANOREXIA, AND SAD THOUGHTS. CAN BE TRIGGERING. It was raining. It had been raining all day. Of course, as Dick set out as Nightwing for patrol, the rain began to come down harder. He groaned internally. Great. Just great! Sucks to Nightwing tonight! He ventures further into Bludhaven, towards the coordinates he finally found of an illegal shipment supposed to occur today. Dick's spent weeks trying to track these thugs down, and he's finally gonna kick some ass and get a good night's sleep. Finally. But boy was he wrong. There's a cold feeling in his gut, and it's setting Dick on edge. Dick tried to brush the feeling off, dismissing it to be his lack of sleep. Giving himself a shake, he hops onto his motorcycle and continues on. (Line Break!) Jason is currently functioning on those thirty minutes of sleep he got last week, and he's just about to break. He can hear it, everywhere he goes he can hear it. It gets worse at night. Even when he's not asleep. He can feel it. Jason shudders. He's refused to sleep. He couldn't sleep. He's shaking just thinking about it. Every time he closes his eyes, he can hear it and feel it. He can see it too. He can taste the blood in his mouth as the crowbar slams into his chest over and over and over again. He just wants it to end. It's bad enough when he's awake. So Jason runs. Jason runs far, towards the coordinates of the illegal shipment of drugs coming into Bludhaven tonight. He runs, because maybe, just maybe, if he doesn't close his eyes, if he runs faster then he can, if he stops eating long enough, just maybe he will escape the feeling of the crowbar, the taste of blood, and the maniacal laughter in his ear.[Chapter 3] When Dick finally arrived at the coordinates, he found his work already done for him. Well, it was not how he would have completed the task, but done anyways. The place was a bloodbath. The bodies of the thugs lay in piles, blood seeping from the holes in between their eyes. The shipment was blown up, literally. The remains of the cargo burned in the fire from the explosion that must have occurred, littered among the bodies. Red Hood. Jason. Dick sucked in a breath. Jason must be in one of his, \"shoot-first-ask-questions-later\" mood. Dick crept around the buildings surrounding the wreak, fully expecting to be shot at any moment. Passing a dark alley, Dick frowns at the heavy stench of blood. Seeing a pool of it at his feet, he ventures further into the alley, escirma sticks drawn and ready. A bullet wizzes past his ear, Red Hood coming into view before him. He's bleeding from a bullet wound in his left shoulder, and his red helmet is cracked, a peice missing. Dick can see Jason's pastel-green eye, and a bit of his messy black and white hair. Jason's visible eye is glazed over, as though remembering something horrible. \"Fuck off Nightwing.\" Jason growls, though it's not filled with his usual hate, and he used \"Nightwing\" instead of\"Dick\". Something's up, but before Dick can ponder this, Jason's leaping to the roof of a building, taking off. Dick races behind him, and they stop running on top of a large roof. Jason's got his mouth running, and Dick's big brother instincts kick in. \"What the fuck do you want from me asshole?\" Jason yells. \"Language!\" Dick chips, dodging a punch thrown his way. Jason throws him into a wall. \"You goddam motherfucking shitass!\" Jason growls. Dick frowns, picking himself up from the wall, facing away from Jason as he pretends to dust himself off. \"Language! Jeez Jay, that was rude. Did no one ever teach you your manners? Guess it's too late now.\" he jokes, but the smile dies on his lips as he turns, seeing Jason crumple to the ground, choking. \"Jay!\"[Chapter 4] When Dick finally arrived at the coordinates, he found his work already done for him.

Jason jerks away from him touch and kicks him in the gut. Dick tries to reach out again, a cold feeling in his gut as he watches Jason. His face his buried in his arms, which are wrapped around his legs, which are pulled to his chest. Jason is rocking back and forth, shaking as he murmurs, \"no\" over and over again. Dick approaches Jason slowly. He isn't sure what he did to trigger Jason into a mental breakdown, and he isn't looking to do it again. \"Jason.\" Dick murmurs, crouching beside him, he reaches out to touch Jason, provide some sort of comfort, but Jason whimpers, shrinking away from Dick's touch. \"Nonononono no!\" Jason cries. \"Hey, Jason it's okay, it's me, Dick.\" (DICK'S POV) I gently take Jason's hand into my own, hoping to snap him out of whatever trance he's in. \"NO! PLEASE STOP! NO! PLEASE, I'M SORRY, JOKER STOP!\" Jason screams. My mouth drops open in shock. Joker? Jason..I must have said something to trigger him. Jason begins to choke, coughing up blood. \"Jay, Jay you need to listen to me. It's Dick, the Joker isn't here. I promise. It's just me, you need to breathe.\" I whisper in his ear, wrapping my arm around his shoulders, rubbing his back, hoping the soothing contact would show him I was not in fact, the Joker. \"N-(*gasp*)-O!\" He chokes. I frown, Jason's gonna kill himself if he doesn't calm down. \"Jay, Jay, head in between your knees, Jay I need you to move,\" I say, aware that my voice is slowly climbing octaves. Jason isn't listening. I don't know what to do, so I say the first thing that comes into my mind. \" BlueJay.\" the old nickname. When Jason was younger, when he was Robin, when his life wasn't as screwed up as it is now, by simply saying that one word I would have Jason's full attention. The nickname had an odd affect on Jason, but it was cute, and it worked. Jason's head snapped up, and his choked gasps slowed slightly. \"D-dick?\" He whispered softly, his body trembling. \"Yeah, yeah BlueJay it's me. I need you to calm down for me, okay? I need you to breathe.\" I whispered, and Jason did. I let out a breath I didn't realize I was holding, still rubbing Jason's back softly. Review and I will continue!

Chavez told Star all about John Turnstile the Regulators, and the Lincoln war. \"I'd like to meet doc and of course I'd have to meet the famous Billy the kid.\" Star said \"No, trust me,.. You don't want to meet Billy.\" After Star had left the Red Sands, she came here to California to visit her brother. After that, she went back home to Texas where her mother had moved and stayed there with her for awhile. Right now, she was going back and forth from Texas to California helping with the horse racing business. \"You see, when my dad died, it was in his will that I receive a third share of his estate. I took part of my share in the form of two of my fathers best mares; one of which I bred to my father's best stallion. I'm training the colt right now, but he won't be ready to run for another two years. You know, he's picking it up real fast\" Chavez listened to Star contently. He had forgotten how much he liked just listening to her talk. He looked down and noticed the pearl handled guns hanging from Star's hips, a bright silver Sheriffs Star gleaming on one of them. \"Oh look, I've rambled on all the way to the ranch.\" Chavez and Star walked through the entrance of the Shield H ranch just as the sun went down. Chavez beheld the ranch. Blossoming orange trees lined the wide road leading from the entrance to house. A large corral lay off to the right and a two story barn behind it. The house was much grander than the Turnstile home. It stood two stories tall, made with stained split logs. The front porch was the length of the house and was wide enough to fit four wagons on it. Obviously made to accommodate big social gatherings. As they walked toward the barn Chavez saw the ranch hands slowing move away from their various duties and filing into cook shack. It gave him a strange feeling of nostalgia and he felt a sharp pain in his heart. They put the horses away in silence, both deep in their own thoughts. The house was dark and quite when they walked in. Star lit a match begin light the lamps. \"I thought you said you lived with your brother? There's no one else here.\" Chavez said as he and Star entered the white two story house. \"He's away visiting his Fiancé. He's considering moving up north with her once he gets married. I'm trying to talk him into selling me this place.\" \"You don't have a personal cook? Or maids\" Star laughed, \"No, I prefer to do things myself.\" She said smiling and blew out the match. Chavez sat at reclining in a chair at the kitchen table, watching as Star cooked and rambled on about breeds and colors of horses. Once upon a time his people, the Dine', had been called the \"horse people\". Even the Navajo women were considered to be the best horsemen of all the Indian peoples. It seemed so fitting that he should have fallen in love with Star. Star sat a plate in front of him and brought him out of his thoughts. \"Oh, I really wish I could be a jockey\" she talked on as she took a seat \"… I'm just too tall\" Chavez smiled but said nothing. \"Sorry I'm doing it again aren't I?\" she said \"No it's inspiring to hear you speaking so passionate about your horses. Did I ever tell you that the Dine' were once great horsemen?\" \"it seems like I've that somewhere before\" \"it was a long time ago. Before we were forced onto the reservations\" His eyes were on her, but he was not looking at her, he was looking at scenes from the past. She leaned across the table and took his hand. \"you can be happy again, Chavez… I'm going to help you\" I will try to update regularly. Reviews make me happy =)[Chapter 2] ME: Lol so my chapters aren't any longer than they used to be but hopefully the content is better? Chavez: When did you start this story? Like six years ago?

Chapter 2: Atsila Chavez glanced at the clock on the wall as it chimed in 2:00am and realized he been lying awake for hours. He decided to give up on sleep and lighting a candle, he made his way down the stairs. As he neared the living room, he could the strum of a guitar and voice softly singing. \" Pretty things are yours to hold, pretty things so new and old. Pretty things you think you need are not what make you beautiful. Pretty things will rob you blind; pretty things will fade in time. It's what's inside that make you shine. My pretty thing\" Star was sitting on the couch with her guitar; a small fire burning in the fireplace, lost in her own world as she sang. Chavez watched her intently from the darkness, the light of the fire making supernatural shapes on her face. Chavez sat his candle on a side table and the sound made Star look up. \"I'm sorry did I wake you?\" \"no.\" he replied and settled on the couch beside her. \"I couldn't sleep\" \"Me either\" she said, absentmindedly plucking at the strings of her instrument. \"You have a beautiful voice. Why do you not sing more often?\" \"I don't know…\" she stared off into the fire. \"I should call you Shi-Ha-Stah.\" He said, a smile playing on his face. \"Shi-Ha-Stah? What does that mean?\" \"She who sings\" \"I like it! It's better than what the Cherokee called me…\" Star replied and Chavez listened as she began to prattle on about white names seemed to have no meaning, while Indian names told a story. Why was he being so timid? All he wanted to do was take her in his arms and kiss her like he had that night on the reservation. But he didn't. He wanted to tell her how he felt, but he couldn't. She was his last chance at happiness. First his family had been ripped from him followed by John Turnstile and the regulators. He wasn't sure his heart could bear her rejection. So they fell into the easy conversation of two old friends, talking late into the night. When Star awoke it took a moment before it registered in her mind that she was not lying in her bed. She opened her eyes and found herself still in the living room. Realizing she must have fallen asleep on the couch, she moved on to the more important question; where was Chavez? After a search of the house, she finally found him sitting on a bench on the front porch, nursing a cup of coffee. \"There you are!\" she said grinning \"I've been looking all over for you!\" He glanced up at her and had to stifle a chuckle. Her curly hair, as if in some mad protest, was sticking out in all directions; her face suddenly turning an adorable shade of red as she tried to smooth the tangled mass with her hands. \"And WHAT is so funny?\" she spat, trying to sound indignant. \"Um, nothing.\" \"I was wondering if you'd like to watch me work my colt.\" \"Sure.\" \"o.k. I'm gunna go change and then I'll meet you at the corral!\" She said and disappeared inside the house. A full half hour later, Star was standing the center of the corral. Her hair now tamed, brushed and pulled into a ponytail. Her simple ensemble consisting of boots, riding skirt and floral print blouse. Chavez lead the colt into the corral, he was a beautiful creature; lean, muscular and completely jet black save for a small white patch on his forehead. Chavez untied the halter and watched as the colt lopped and bucked happily, obviously glad to be out of its stall. \"He's amazing Shi-Ha-Stah, what did you name him?\" \"I haven't decided for sure yet, but I was thinking of calling him Atsila. It means 'Fire' in Cherokee.\" Chavez admired the animal \"It's perfect.\" For the next several hours Chavez watched in amazement as Star trained Atsila. The horse seemed to react to her very energy; going from a walk to trot to lope with a slight body movement from Star. Ever so often she would stand still, letting her shoulders sink and Atsila would come to her freely. Star took this time to rub the colt all over with her hands or sometimes with a saddle blanket. When the sun was high in the sky, she called the training session to an end and she and Chavez led Atsila back to the barn. Once he was securely in his stall, they gave him a scoop of grain and set to brushing him. \"I've never seen anybody break a horse like that before.\" Chavez said \"That's because it's not breaking. The Cherokee call it, 'taking the spirit'. It makes your horse a willing partner, instead of a slave.\" Star replied exiting the stall. She took the brushes and put them away. \"Now what do you say we go into town and see about you some new clothes, or do you intend to where those same ones the rest of your life?\" He laughed, \"Sounds good to me.\" ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I do not own young guns or young guns 2 Love and Loss Chapter 1- Catching Up Chavez and"},{"Movie":"Young Guns","Title":"Fight On, Brave Knights!

I know that I am writing another book at this time, but I had collaborated with a friend of mine on this book like a year ago and I neither wrote a beginning or an end to it, so I figured I might as well add more to this story. I also want to apologize for using a storyline that is so often used, but I was pretty young when I wrote this and I promise to add in more scenes that doesn't stick strictly to the Young Guns Movie and is different from any of the other 'daughter Tunstall' books I've read on here. Chapter 1-New Arrivals Cheyenne Tunstall rose her hands above her head, taking a small step forward. She took in a calming breath before launching herself forward, her hands contacting the sandy ground and flipping her feet above her. She landed her feet and pushed off the ground once again, pulling her hands close to her as she flipped completely in the air before sticking a landing. Her best friend, Tristen, clapped her hands from behind her as Cheyenne turned and grinned at her. \"You're getting pretty good at that,\" she acknowledged, walking over to greet her friend. Cheyenne chuckled at the compliment before releasing her tight position. \"How did you find me?\" Cheyenne asked, tilting her head at Tristen with curiosity. \"Honestly, Cheyenne, I'm your best friend. You should know better than to think that I don't know every place you try to escape to.\" \"I guess you are right. Why'd you come up here anyway?\" \"Can't a girl go looking for her best friend just to chat?\" Tristen asked defensively. Cheyenne raised her eyebrow and stared at her friend, showing that she didn't believe it for a second. \"Your father wanted me to find you, he hired a new ranch hand and he wants you to meet him.\" Cheyenne groaned loudly. \"Honestly? Why on earth does he continue to fill our house with ex-cons. One day, he'll hire one that's bound to kill me and him as well.\" \"Your father is a good man. He takes in young men and gives them new lives,\" Tristen reminded, nodding her head behind her to hint at them walking back. Cheyenne nodded as she walked over to Tristen as they began walking side-by-side. \"I know, but, Tristen, you have no idea what it is like living in a house full of men.\" \"Really?\" asked Tristen. \"I'm at your house a lot more than I am at mine.\" Cheyenne chuckled. \"I'd switch lives with you any day of the week, Tris.\" Tristen scoffed. \"I don't think you would. My parents are the most strict people you've ever met,\" Tristen replied and Cheyenne gave her a skeptical look. \"They let you come over almost everyday to a house full of unmarried men who had run-ins with the law, not to mention stay the night.\" Tristen laughed. \"They trust your father.\" \"Cheyenne!\" Cheyenne and Tristen turned to see Richard riding up to them, the other regulators riding up behind him. These were the young men that Cheyenne was referring to. Now quite civilized (though, not so much to one another), they were definitely not the strays her father hired. They were the cattle hands of the big ranch. \"Tristen,\" Richard greeted, tilting his hat to her. Cheyenne scoffed. Even if the two didn't realize it, Tristen and Richard were crazy about each other since they met about two years ago. Richard was especially fond of her, Cheyenne noticed. It may just of been that he was a gentleman at heart and knew that if you liked a lady, you treated her with respect. Even so, the two never told each other their feelings and Cheyenne was ready for them to get together soon. Not only were they 'destined' and seemed incomplete without each other, they would dance around the subject as much as they could which annoyed Cheyenne. She would rather not hear, 'Tristen this,' or, 'Richard that' every day of the week. \"Cheyenne, what are you doing out here?\" Richard asked, turning back to the young girl he considered a sister. \"Practicing,\" Cheyenne replied with a shrug. \"Do you ever stop practicing? I'm starting to think that that's just your way of avoiding us all now.\" \"Well, it's an excuse to,\" she teased and he smiled. \"Cheyenne, you really shouldn't be out here without anyone watching you.\" \"I got Tristen. Apparently it's impossible to avoid her.\" Tristen gave her infamous flashing smile. Richard shook his head. \"I don't think your father wants you running off every chance you get and being unprotected.\" \"I'm fine, father ,\" Cheyenne said, clearly annoyed. \"I'm sorry, I'm just trying to be concerned for you,\" Richard replied. Cheyenne nodded. \"I know, but you are overly concerned. I don't think anyone is going to try to violate me if I'm more than twenty feet away from the ranch.\" \"It's debatable,\" Richard argued. \"Well, I'll scream for you if that happens.\" \"Can we just go ahead and meet the new ranch hand like her father instructed me to get Cheyenne for in the first place?\" Tristen interrupted through their sibling-like talk with a chuckle. Cheyenne's eyes widened as she turned to face her best friend. \"Oh, yeah, Tristen, can you go home and ask if you can stay over? I don't want to be bored while the boys over here harass the new stray.\" \"And have the possibility of the guy being a mass murderer? I don't know... just kidding I'll be back in a jiffy.\" Cheyenne laughed as Tristen walked off and turned back to Richard. \"Now, I think I can handle the walk back home by myself,\" she said, already starting to walk off. Richard rolled his eyes as he shook his head, trailing behind her. \"Richard!\" \"What? I would like to meet the new stray for myself, you know,\" Richard defended. \"You already did,\" Charlie commented from behind which Richard glared to. Cheyenne rose her eyebrow. \"What I love is that when you try to lie to me, one of you always expose the other. It's quite comical.\" With that, Cheyenne began running, despite knowing that Richard was on a horse and still following her until she made it to the ranch. To her surprise and delight, Richard and the others walked off as soon as she had reached the ranch, knowing that they were the cattle hands and needed to do their job. Bang! Cheyenne jumped when she heard the sound of a gun going off and a bullet firing not to far away from her. Regaining her senses, she smiled as she seen the source of the sound as a young man standing in the swine pin, pointing his gun at one of the pigs. \"And here I was just coming over here to introduce myself,\" Cheyenne said smiling, raising her hands in surrender as he pointed the gun at her for a split second before lowering it. \"And who might you be?\" The man questioned, straightening his stance and acting like he knew what he was doing at the moment. Cheyenne chuckled, clasping her hands behind her back as she walked toward the pin. \"Well, I would think he would've told you about me. Cheyenne Tunstall, pleasure I'm sure,\" she said, smiling. \"You mean the guy that hired me? Are you implying that I just pointed my gun at his very own daughter?\" he said with a drop of sarcasm as he bowed. \"The very one,\" she said, unaffected by his sarcasm as she rounded around the pin, so that she was on the same side as him. She studied him for a moment and she had to admit, she knew this was the one that would get the worst of the jokes from the boys. Working with the hogs compared to working with the cattle was like the lower class compared to the upper. Of course, she didn't show any pity in her eyes or expression, she knew the boy wouldn't want that and she had a feeling he dealt with worse. \"Well?\" she asked, smiling. \"Aren't you going to introduce yourself? When one person says their name, the other person usually does as well around these parts.\" \"I go by Billy,\" he introduced. He stuck to the shortest answers possible because they both knew that he wasn't in the mood for talking, nor would be any time soon. He was more focused on punishing that pig that had embarrassed him in front of a girl. \"Billy,\" she repeated, glancing down at the pigs who were running around the pin in panic. \"Well, if you are able to deal with them, I'll owe you one. They cause more trouble than they're worth.\" He scoffed at her words. Instead of showing any annoyance at his reaction, she remained grinning. She knew the little act that all of them did and honestly, she learned not to take it personally. That was usually why her father always wanted her to meet the strays, she never was riled or annoyed by their rudeness or intimidating selves while the boys always did except Richard. It usually got on their nerves, but eventually, they were pretty decent lads. Instead, she rose an eyebrow at him and laughed. \"That's not the usual reaction I get there. Normally the girl acts all offended and I have to fix it with compliments. Good thing I didn't have to with you 'cause I don't know if I have any,\" he joked. \"And same to you, hog boy,\" she teased, glancing at the window where she spotted her father watching. She smiled and waved at him. Her father opened the door and walked outside, appearing at his daughter's side soon after. \"I see you've met William,\" her father said as Cheyenne smiled innocently at her father. \"Yes, charming he is,\" she said, glancing over at Billy and smirking. Billy narrowed his eyes at her before looking over at John. \"I go by Billy.\" \"Don't take it personally, Master William, but I call all the boys by their formal names. It's good grounds for an education and sounds better at the dinner table.\" \"Oh, Father, that reminds me. I invited Tristen over for supper,\" Cheyenne said, turning away from Billy to face her father. \"Without asking me?\" John asked, glancing at Cheyenne. \"Well, it already seems like she lives here. I usually don't ask and you usually don't mind.\" \"Fair enough,\" John replied. \"Why don't you head inside and get ready, Cheyenne?\" She nodded, smiling at Billy before walking inside, quickly dashing up the steps to her room where she would get into her supper clothing. When she finally finished, she found Tristen downstairs at the dinner table, waiting for everyone to come in for dinner. \"So, I'm assuming they said yes?\" Cheyenne asked as she took her time down the steps. \"I'm here, aren't I?\" \"You told them you're spending the night, right?\" Tristen shrugged. \"They'll find out eventually,\" Tristen replied and Cheyenne laughed. \"My father would kill me if I did that!\" Cheyenne said, taking a seat beside Tristen at the dinner table that surprisingly, her father had already set. \"Maybe, you don't know for sure,\" Tristen said. \"He would.\" At that moment, John walked inside, the boys trailing behind him as they all took their seats. John took his seat at the end of the table, different from everyone else's who sat side by side. Cheyenne was now sitting in-between Charlie(who was sitting the left of Steve) and Tristen, while Richard, Doc, Billy and Chavez sat at the other side. Finally, they were all ready with food on their trays. \"Shall we pray?\" John asked as every nodded. Cheyenne bowed her head. She didn't actually believe in God, but she didn't ever say anything, not wanting to offend her father or anyone else about something that didn't really matter to her. \"Lord, we want to thank you for this fine food that you have blessed us with and allowing us all to gather together-.\" Cheyenne opened her eyes a little and spotted Billy staring at her across the table. She rose an eyebrow at him. He smirked before closing his eyes and pretending to pray as well. She frowned when he didn't see and stared at him curiously. She had expected him to be lacking in manners and very rude as he had been and she thought it'd be a long time before he warmed up to her. But he had been staring at her which she didn't think was too strange since she hasn't been looking but when she showed him that she had caught him... he smirked. Smirked. Why on Earth would someone who tried to make a show of disliking her smirk and not care that she had caught him in an embarrassing act. Men, thought Cheyenne, always a mystery to her. \"... And in Jesus name we pray, Amen,\" said Richard and everyone lifted their heads and began eating. Tristen and Cheyenne shared a smile as they witnessed every one of the boys throw down on their food. \"Well now, look at those appetites. William? Have some more.\" John said, nodding at Billy in conformation. Billy stared at him for a moment before getting another spoonful of the stew. \"Have you ever worked beef before, Billy?\" Richard asked. \"Yeah... I worked a little out Fort Sumner way. Pete Maxwell's place. Did the chow line. But, I got a way with cattle,\" Billy said and Steve mumbled something under his breath that made both him and Charlie start to laugh. Cheyenne glanced over at them before sending a sneaky glance at her father who was staring at them in irritation. \"Is that so jolly funny, Master Steven? That's no proper table manners,\" her father replied to which Steve looked down to avoid her father's eyes. \"Got a way with hogs,\" Charlie snickered and both him and Steve laughed. \"Congratulations, Charles... You and Steven will be doing the dirty crockery alone this evening.\" Charlie chuckled as he sat his fork down and turned to John. \"Sorry, John, it struck me funny,\" Charlie replied and John nodded towards Billy. \"And to William. Both of you.\" \"Apologies William. Just hacking on you, that's all,\" Charlie apologized; even though, most of the table had a least cracked one smile at his comments. \"Yeah, we're just hacking on you,\" Steve added to which Billy didn't reply or show much expression. \"Rumor has it, you killed a man, Billy? You don't seem like the killing sort,\" Richard interrupted, changing the subject after a period of silence. Surprised, Cheyenne's eyes shot up, staring at Billy. \"Yeah Billy, what'd you kill him for?\" Steve asked, hoping to provoke him even more. Billy glanced over at him and stared directly in his eyes before saying, \"He was hacking on me.\" Steve gulped loudly before him and Charlie shared a look as everyone stared at them in silence. That is until Cheyenne starting laughing loudly. John sent her a knowing look as she quickly covered it up by coughs. \"That's not funny,\" she said, shaking her head at her father before looking down at her plate and taking a bite. Her father; though, couldn't help but smile as well when he looked down at his plate. Billy grinned, pleased that he had gotten the young woman to laugh. \"That had to be the most uneasy dinner I've ever had over here and trust me, you have had some pretty uneasy dinner discussions over her before,\" Tristen had said when her and Cheyenne came inside Cheyenne's room after dinner. Cheyenne plopped on her bed before staring at Tristen. \"Thank you for being so blunt, Tris,\" Cheyenne replied, rolling her eyes. Tristen chuckled as she plopped on the bed beside her. \"Anytime. What are they doing anyway?\" \"Reading,\" answered Cheyenne, wondering how Tristen had never asked before since it was a nightly thing that her father and the boys did. \"Father likes to keep the boys educated, so he usually has them read a paragraph or two from the newspaper. Richard and Doc aren't usually the target of this since they've both been educated much longer and can read pretty well. Father likes to focus on Charlie and Steve's reading really, but he says they are coming along.\" Tristen nodded in understanding. \"Speaking of the newcomer-.\" \"We weren't,\" Cheyenne pointed out, leaning back on the bed so her head rested on her pillow. \"Anyways, what do you think of him?\" Cheyenne merely shrugged. \"I don't know.\" Tristen scoffed. \"You don't know?\" she asked with a tone of disbelief. \"I just met him, Tristen. I haven't formed an opinion about him yet, I guess.\" Tristen had to roll her eyes as she leaned back until her back touched the wall the bed was sitting against. \"He's handsome though, you have to admit,\" Tristen pried, staring intently at her good friend. \"I've seen better.\" Tristen heaved out a loud groan as she shook her head in annoyance at her friend's difficulty. \"Why can't you confess anything? Just one feeling is all I ask.\" \"What?\" Cheyenne asked, furrowing her eyebrows together as she stared at Tristen with curiosity. Tristen sighed. \"I seen the none-too-subtle looks you two were exchanging.\" \"What are you talking about?\" asked Cheyenne, sending her friend a very confused look. \"I'm talking about the rules of attraction, Cheyenne. The glances, the smiles. I've never seen it so obvious before.\" Cheyenne inwardly scoffed. She probably had never seen it-period. \"You are delusional, my friend\" Cheyenne replied, tilting her head back and closing her eyes in relaxation. \"Maybe, but that doesn't mean I'm not right about this,\" Tristen insisted, leaning closer anxiously to hear what Cheyenne would say. \"Divulge me, what do you think of him?\" \"What do you think of him?\" Cheyenne countered after a few moments of silence. \"Don't change the subject,\" Tristen said, ignoring her question. Cheyenne raised an eyebrow at her. \"Although, I will take him for myself if you don't.\" That wasn't true and Cheyenne knew it. Tristen would never chase after a man she believed that Cheyenne fancied. And since she couldn't get the silly notion out of her head, Cheyenne was utterly annoyed. Even if she were attracted to Billy or any man for that matter, she would never want to pursue such a relationship. No, she had read books like North and South or Pride and Prejudice and as much as she wanted to believe that love would be that way, she knew it wouldn't. Even from a very young age, Cheyenne didn't have much faith in marriage. She had witnessed the true means for marriage and often realized that you either married for wealth and you don't feel the true 'love' that marriage was supposed to have or you married for love which usually ended in you struggling to get food on the table each day. After all, her mother had married for wealth and only two years after she was born she ran off, probably because she couldn't stand living with a man who she didn't love; although, it was clear her father loved her. So, while the other girls dreamed of marriage and a family, Cheyenne dreaded it, knowing that life wouldn't be easy in marriage or without marriage. \"Oh, really? And what about Richard?\" Cheyenne choose to ask, deciding that she wouldn't ruin the idea of love to Tristen. \"What about Richard?\" Tristen asked, feeling a little flustered already. \"If we are going to talk about obvious, it is pretty obvious you two are in love with each other.\" \"Stop trying to change the-.\" \"I'm not. I thought it was only fair that I bring up something obvious to myself.\" Tristen sighed, rubbing her temple before glancing over at Cheyenne. \"Let's just get some sleep. It is already late enough.\" \"See, not so funny now, is it?\" Cheyenne teased, but agreed. Tristen was quite odd at times, she could find some sort of attraction out of a look or two Cheyenne and Billy had shared yet, she couldn't figure out her feelings or Richard's feelings that they had for one another for two years.[Chapter 2] Author's Note: Hey guys! Sorry for the long update and I'm sorry that this chapter isn't as good as I hoped it would be. I'm grateful to all those who have reviewed and I apologize if Billy seems a bit 'OC'ish in this chapter. The story will get better as it progresses and I know this chapter seems a bit rushed and not looked at carefully but I was on a bit of a tight schedule. One of these days I must re-edit it but until then, this is chapter 2! Enjoy! Chapter 2- Church and Proposals It was only two short days later that they all went to church, John leading the way as they all sat in the same pew. Cheyenne sat in between her father and Billy while the rest separated to Billy's side and John's side. Cheyenne gazed over the crowd who were all deep in conversation with their friends, hoping to catch Tristen's eye, but instead, she found herself staring into the dark brown eyes of Anna Murphy. \"Hello, Cheyenne! Nice to see you here!\" cheered Anna in her usual fake tone and fake smile. Cheyenne returned the fake smile. \"Anna, of course I'd be here. You should know that by now.\" Anna eyes remained locked on Cheyenne's for a moment before she turned her head to see Billy and smiled. She wasn't exactly fond of Cheyenne nor Cheyenne to her, but to keep up appearances, they usually used fake kind tones as they said their insults despite how obvious it was that they hated each other. \"Oh, so you are another of Mr. Tunstall's strays? I'm sure you are very grateful that you are in a church instead of a jail cell.\" It wasn't a surprise that she made that comment either, since Anna was what Cheyenne considered 'snobbish' and since her father, Lawrence Murphy, had a rivalry with her father. She found it only necessary that she poke fun at John's business as well as his workers. Anything to continue their on-going rivalry. Billy only stared at Anna, then suddenly, gave a flashing smile. \"Yes, actually, I am. I'm so glad I don't work at your place.\" Anna frowned at that. \"Oh, don't take it so seriously. I'm only making polite conversation.\" \"Then I worry about what your version of a not polite conversation is,\" Billy retorted. Cheyenne chuckled as she watched Anna's frown grow even wider. \"I'm glad you two hit it off. Why don't you do me a favor, Anna, and go talk to someone else?\" Cheyenne replied as sweetly as possible. Anna narrowed her eyes before going back to her usual fake smile. \"I'd be delighted to,\" she replied as she turned and walked away. As soon as Anna turned around, Cheyenne's fake smile disappeared. \"I want to wipe that smug smile off her face,\" Cheyenne growled, shrinking into her seat. \"Well, looks like I have that capability. And since when were we on talking terms?\" he questioned with a smirk. \"Since you met the devil's daughter.\" \"Oh, I did about a day ago.\" Cheyenne chuckled. \"Honey, you don't even know me yet. I'm far worse than what you've seen.\" \"You are probably worse than, Anna,\" Billy replied. \"So, you're implying that I'm worse than you? Raise your hand if you haven't had a run in with the law,\" Cheyenne said, raising her hand and looking around. \"Hmm, that's right.\" \"Well, well. Looks like the pastor had some secrets of his own.\" \"And I never killed anybody,\" Cheyenne retorted, ignoring his comment. \"On second thought, I may kill you...someday,\" she added after a moment's pause. \"Good luck doing that, sweetheart.\" \"I don't need luck, trust me.\" \"No, you just need a miracle.\" \"Exactly how many people have you killed exactly?\" she asked, corking her eyebrow upward. He scoffed. \"Too many to count on my fingers,\" he said with his usual arrogant smirk. \"Uh-huh,\" Cheyenne replied, her disbelief rather evident in her words. \"Soon there will be one more on that list. Can't decide if that's you or Anna.\" \"Oh, so you admit to wanting to kill women? Oh, that's a good virtue,\" Cheyenne scoffed. \"And that means something? I thought you were all for the 'treated fairly'.\" \"First, when did I ever say that I was all for being treated fairly? And secondly, I'm not implying that I care but my father and certainly all these young, strong men that are like brothers to me will.\" \"Sorry ma'am, didn't mean to offend you.\" For once, Cheyenne frowned during their conversation. \"Yes, you are quite unappealing,\" she replied, glancing at his face. \"Am I? I am so terribly sorry for my rude manners,\" Billy replied with such an unusual tone that didn't fit him. Cheyenne did not like what he was trying to do, but instead of keeping her calm manner as she usually does, she seemed to explode at this. \"No, you're not!\" Cheyenne cried which caused multiple people to turn their heads their way. \"Sorry,\" she whispered once they turned around. \"Now look what you've done!\" \"Again, madam, I take full responsibility. I am working on it.\" Cheyenne stared at him for a very long time, disbelieving him. \"I know what you're doing and it's not going to work,\" Cheyenne said, crossing her arms to put emphasize on her statement. \"I'm sorry? I have no idea what you are talking about, mi'lady.\" \"I'm not royalty.\" \"To me, you very much are. I mean look at you. So gorgeous.\" \"No, I'm not. Wait...I mean, I am pretty, but you don't mean that,\" Cheyenne replied, stammering over her words and finding it rather difficult to relay what she had meant. \"Of course I do! I put no false meaning to these words of mine,\" he said, laying a hand on where his heart should be sympathetically. She glared at him, feeling the urge to kill him but knowing that wouldn't go down so well in church. \"I'm beginning to like you better when you were insulting. More fun.\" \"I'm sorry, but that man is long gone. I have come to see how I am slipping my opportunities to get the best gal on earth as that man.\" \"Stop it! You shouldn't be behaving this way in church,\" she said before thinking about it. \"Wait a minute, that didn't make sense, did it?\" \"Oh, my love can be so cute when she is ditsy.\" \"Will you shut up?\" Cheyenne hissed, feeling rather annoyed now as she stared at him with murderous eyes. \"Whatever you may please, mi'lady.\" Cheyenne gave up and rolled her eyes as she waited for the preacher to begin his sermon. \"Tristen, I don't think sleeping is a hobby and I don't think that's what the preacher was asking for when he asked you what you like to do in your spare time,\" Cheyenne explained as her and Tristen walked out of the church, Cheyenne's father and the boys not too far behind. \"I was just being honest like a true christian would be,\" Tristen reminded. Cheyenne chuckled while shaking her head. \"It was the only part I actually paid attention to though, I was a bit distracted.\" \"You never pay attention,\" Tristen pointed out. \"All I saw before I fell asleep was you paying attention to the wrong man in the church.\" Cheyenne rose an eyebrow at that. The fact that Tristen said that she fell asleep in church was a bit strange. Like Richard, Tristen had a strong belief in God and acted like what a true christian should be. \"Um, you do know that God sees you right?\" Cheyenne asked before adding, \"And I'm not quite sure what you are talking about.\" \"I think you do. And God seen you too, missy,\" Tristen teased but it didn't earn a chuckle from Cheyenne. It only earned a moment for Cheyenne to finally vent out her anger. \"Missy, madam, m'lady, ma'am? People need to stop calling me these things!\" Cheyenne burst out quite abruptly which caused Tristen to send her a strange look. \"Who ever calls you that?\" Cheyenne forced herself to calm down and shook her head, not wanting to talk about it with Tristen of all people. \"Nevermind. Did you see Anna? Better yet did you see the way she was staring at me?\" \"Yeah! She has got some nerve taking your man!\" Cheyenne closed her eyes, holding back her annoyance before glaring at her good friend. \"That is not what I meant and he's not my man. Anna was insulting him too anyway.\" \"So, she took Billy's method of getting a girl? Interesting, I've got to try that sometime,\" Tristen said, ignoring most of the comments that Cheyenne made. \"You are hopeless when you get like this, \" Cheyenne sighed, shaking her head before a devious grin appeared on her face. \"You are going to try it on Richard, right?\" Tristen frowned. \"What?\" \"Richard! Tristen wants to talk to you!\" Cheyenne cried out, holding her same smirk as she glanced over at Richard behind her. \"I do?\" Cheyenne sighed, opening her mouth to call Richard over again but Tristen cut her off. \"If this is your way of proving you don't like Billy, I get your point.\" \"Good,\" Cheyenne replied as they reached the ranch. \"But I can tell the future. You may not like him now but…\" At that, Cheyenne pushed Tristen playfully. \"Ow! Billy! Cheyenne needs a whoppin'!\" Tristen called to Cheyenne glared at. \"Gladly,\" he said with a smirk before winking at Cheyenne. \"Get-! Tristen, I will kill you if he touches me. And my father will kill you if...where is my father anyway?\" Cheyenne asked, glancing behind her for her father. \"Two people can't both kill me. You'd have to flip a coin,\" Billy said. \"Gladly.\" \"Cheyenne, is he harassing you?\" Richard asked, walking over to her side. \"Yes. Don't forget Tristen here too.\" \"You want me to get back at him?\" Richard questioned. \"Tristen too.\" \"I won't hurt Tristen. But Billy on the other hand…\" \"Why not?\" Cheyenne exclaimed to which Richard shook his head began walking back to the others. \"Wait! What about Billy?\" Cheyenne called to Richard's disappearing figure. \"What about your father?\" Tristen interjected. \"Oh, yeah.\" Cheyenne looked around. \"Not here.\" \"He's talking to Alex,\" Richard said before finding conversation with Doc. Cheyenne nodded slowly, remembering that it had been awhile since she had seen her father's business partner. Must have been talking business now. \"Well, I guess I can take my revenge without my father knowing,\" Cheyenne joked, sending Tristen her best evil glare. \"Revenge isn't the answer, dear,\" Billy retorted from Tristen's side and Cheyenne glared at him. \"Dear?\" Tristen's eyes widened while Cheyenne rolled her's. \"Call me dear again and I will shoot you.\" \"And I will take that right to the heart,\" Billy replied with his best dreaming voice. Cheyenne scoffed before spinning around and calling for Richard to come back. \"Richard get back here! I need you!\" Cheyenne called before pausing. \"Oh, father. There you are!\" \"This is good,\" Doc complimented, taking another bite of the food that John had prepared for them. Billy stared at Cheyenne for a moment as the dinner table remained quiet. \"I have an announcement to make,\" Billy said and everyone looked up at him curiously. \"As you've probably gathered, I've had my eyes on a certain lady since I arrived here.\" \"Oh, boy,\" Cheyenne murmured under her breath, sending Billy her infamous, 'I will kill you' and, 'no' looks which he politely ignored. \"And at this, I would like for her hand in marriage, of course, asking her father's blessing first,\" Billy said with his most serious voice he could muster, staring at John. John dropped his fork. All the boys stared at Billy with wide, confused eyes. \"Oh, so that's why he called you dear,\" Tristen said relaxed, directing her comment toward Cheyenne who was glaring at Billy. Cheyenne slammed her silverware onto her plate. \"That's it! I'm going to kill you!\" Cheyenne cried as Richard rested a hand on her shoulder to prevent her from doing so. \"That's not what you usually do when someone proposes to you,\" Billy said with a very amused look. If it wasn't for Richard, Cheyenne would have dove over the table and attacked Billy-something that she had never done before and something she never planned on doing. She calmed down a moment as she glanced at her father and smiled. \"He's trying to poke fun. Do not take him serious,\" Cheyenne explained, sending a heavy glare at Billy. Why did she just defend him? Better yet, why was he annoying her so much? She didn't care when he was insulting, but these seemed to bother her more and she knew he figured that out. She had to act like it didn't bother her. \"Alright, I see. William, I do hope that you keep your teasing to a minimum as I do not want to see you go so soon. Both of you, apologize.\" \"Why would I apologize to him?\" Cheyenne remarked, raising an eyebrow at her father. \"Why would he be acting this way if you hadn't done something to bother him?\" Cheyenne kept her gaze on her father, inwardly scowling and cursing at him and Billy. \"She didn't actually offend me…\" Billy started before changing back to his fake attitude. \"She hurt me very deeply, sir,\" Billy said, pretending to choke back tears and placing a hand over his heart dramatically. \"Mhm,\" John said, unconvinced. \"Cheyenne apologize then you William.\" She remained staring at her father for a few minutes and not bothering to say anything to Billy. She had no reason to apologize. She did nothing. \"Cheyenne,\" her father warned and Cheyenne sighed, Looking over at Billy and leaning forward on her elbows. \"I'm very sorry, William for how I've been acting. I know it was wrong of me to get mad at you when you fakely proposed to me and tried to whoop me,\" Cheyenne said in her fakest voice she could muster and a very innocent face. \"What?\" John exclaimed, glaring at Billy who sent Cheyenne an evil look. \"No, no, sir. You've got it all wrong. I was only messing, I had no intentions of being so disrespectful to your daughter. I apologize.\" \"Not to me, to her,\" John said coldly, realizing that there must have been a long on-going quarrel between them that he hadn't even noticed in the days that Billy had been there. \"Right,\" Billy said, switching his gaze to Cheyenne slowly. Cheyenne mustered up her best hurt face. \"You two should be actors,\" Tristen interjected, shaking her head as she chuckled. \"I actually am sorry, whether you believe it or not. I was very rude before and I intend to make it up to you,\" Billy said, seeming very sincere. \"Yeah, right,\" Cheyenne muttered under her breath before sending her father an irritated look. \"Happy?\" ","Summary":" Author's Note: I apologize for the really long chapter and I hope that it doesn't seem like I cramm"},{"Movie":"Top Gun","Title":"Top Gun: Afraid of Flying & the Giant SKY Penis","Author":"YaoiFighter253","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12729063","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I own nothing... both literally and figuratively!

Good Enough? \"What are you thinking about?\" Sam asked him in the dark of her room. He'd have to get up in an hour or so and get back to base so he wouldn't be late for training- God knows how much trouble he'd get in at this stage of the game for that. Iceman couldn't afford to get any points docked, not with Maverick mere points behind him for that trophy, with there still a chance that he could catch him. Even as tempting as a morning with her sounded right now. \"It's nothing,\" He blew it off. They hadn't talked about it, not once over the course of their relationship. There's no way on Earth that Sam would possibly agree to this. It had only been eight weeks, but God knows he loved her with every bone in his body. And why? Because of the damn accident, that suddenly had Iceman, who had been named for his ability to keep cool in bad situations, scrambling to get his shit together. But then, this wasn't like anything he'd encountered up in the atmosphere. \"It is not nothing,\" Sam rolled her grey eyes, pushing her lean body on top of him, forearm pressing into the pillow beside his head. \"Tom, tell me.\" His girlfriend asked with pleading eyes. Fondly, Tom tucked a strand of her long red hair behind an ear. That was what he loved about Samantha. In a world where everyone around him called him Iceman or just simply Ice, he was still her Tom. Like he had been from the very beginning, when they'd met, back in middle school. \"One of the Navigators was killed this week,\" He told her. \"Call sign Goose. He flew with Maverick. We were practicing dogfighting, and both of us were on pursuit. I missed my window to fire, I got out of the way. And seconds later, one of their engines failed. Long story short, they got into a spin there was no recovering from. When they ejected, Goose hit the windshield, and it broke his neck.\" \"My God,\" She whispered. \"Was Maverick okay?\" The two had been seeing each other like this nearly the entirety of his training at Top Gun- Samantha was familiar with the different Pilots and Navigators there, if only from his talking to her about them. \"Yeah, he didn't get a scratch on him,\" Iceman answered, watching her with a far off look in his blue eyes. \"They determined it wasn't his fault. But he's not fine. It's going to take a while for that. It's not like getting back on your bike after you fall off, Sam. Goose dies and Maverick holds himself responsible. It'll be a while before he can get his head back in the game. \"Understandable,\" She nodded from her spot on top of him. Sam folded her arms on his chest and rested her head on them, giving him an almost coy look. \"So why are you thinking about it?\" \"The engine failure had to do with air getting in the engine. My understanding is that they hit the wrong spot, wrong time. A few seconds more and for all I know, that could've been me.\" The Aviator told her. \"If we'd been assigned a different jet a few weeks ago, it would've.\" He stated coolly. Tom tightened his arms around her waist. \"Tom, it's dangerous even going up there,\" Sam rolled her eyes. \"This has happened before, you've seen it. It won't be the last time. What's so different?\" She whispered, tracing a delicate finger over his cheekbone, watching him with a sort of interest and wonder that only she seemed capable of looking at him with. Her fingers were cool and smooth against his skin, like his namesake, Ice. \"What happens to us once I graduate?\" Tom questioned, his only answer. Iceman had been thinking about this for a solid week before the accident, always afraid to say anything about it to her. But the accident had solidified his decision in Ice's mind. There were far too many uncertainties in life, and this was not one he was willing to chance. \"Tom,\" She admonished him, thinking that that was not an answer and he was dodging the question, but that couldn't be any further from the truth in this case. \"This is part of it, for me. What happens?\" Sam shrugged, \"I don't know,\" Laying her head against his shoulder. His hand ran up and down her back and shoulders, over smooth skin and every fine curve of her body, which he knew as intimately as anything he'd seen on his plane, and then some. \"We never really discussed it. I thought you didn't want to talk about getting serious.\" She confided, lowering her voice, though Tom wasn't honestly sure why. It wasn't like there was anyone else around. It wasn't like any of his buddies would come bursting into his quarters at 2:00 a.m. for a prank as they had been known to do. At least, they had before he left for Top Gun. Most everyone there took this far too seriously to pull any big stunt like that. The stakes were too high to risk getting thrown out for a good laugh. \"I've never been anything but serious about you, Samantha,\" He answered. They had known each other since junior high, when he'd moved to her school. Shortly after was when all the affectionate teasing and pranks on her began, because even back then he'd been crazy about her, though he would never admit it to anyone else, and when boys liked girls, among the many things they did in that situation, pranks and teasing were one of them. She knew, of course. Hadn't figured it out till 8th grade, but Sam knew. And he's never had the balls to ask her out, so they never dated, though he'd kind of suspected she liked him as well. Tom had almost forgotten about her until she'd shown up in that bar after day one of Top Gun. She had been out with friends. Sam lived in the area, working in admissions in a nearby college. Sam and him got to talking, and soon it wasn't just that. After so many years of feelings that had never been voiced, seeing each other again brought them all back to the surface, and after enough alcohol had entered the system, they ended up confessing that they'd liked one another- a lot. And then they ended up kissing against the wall of hallway just outside the ladies room. Before either of them seemed very aware of it, they were back in her room, stark naked laying on the bed in the aftermath of some admittedly fantastic sex. Iceman released a small sigh as he put the last of this things in his locker. Just him and Maverick, now. He supposed he ought to offer condolences. Hell, this had happened to him before, or something like it. His first partner had nearly been killed in a similar scene that Ice couldn't recover from, Just like Maverick. That had made him resolve to never make a mistake up in the air, to never be in the position where he was responsible for another man's death. Only that was before Samantha. Now, when he looked at her, all he could see was Goose's widow, and small son, come to pick up his things. How he would hate for it to be her in that position. But he didn't want anybody else doing it, either. \"Mitchell,\" He managed to get out, turning to face the fellow Aviator. He looked into the air. What are you doing, Tom? A voice in the back of his head said. He doesn't want your condolences right now. Maverick didn't acknowledge him, in fact, He didn't even move. \" I'm sorry about Goose.\" Iceman told him, not a sound coming from Mitchell. \"Everybody liked him,\" He said, the best he could think of to console him right then, stupid as it was. He gave a heavy sigh. Oh, He was going to have to ask her. This settled it. There'd be no way to get the widow out of his head of he didn't. Not now. With an air of finality, He looked back at Maverick, and gave one last, \"I'm sorry,\" Before turning and walking out of the locker room. \"Goose left behind a wife and a two or three year old son,\" Tom started. \"And as much as I don't want that to be you, if something ever happened to me, I don't want it to be anybody else.\" He explained. Sam picked her head up to better look at him, sensing a great deal of importance in what was coming. \"If I got hurt, I would want you to be the first one to know. I want you coming to pick up my stuff, and I don't want none of my family telling you what happened to me, or not bothering to send you a funeral invite because you were just a girlfriend they never knew existed.\" \"What are you asking me?\" She whispered. \"I love you, Sam,\" He told her. \"Before I graduate, or before I get stationed somewhere, or something like that, I think we should head down to the courthouse and get married.\" \"What?\" She gasped, a sort of confusion in her eyes, as if she couldn't comprehend what he was asking for her to do. He barely understood it himself, but Tom knew that with her, it would never be wrong. He wanted to wake up to her as often as he could, being in the military. He wanted her to be there when he came home. Wherever home was. \"I want you in my life, Sam,\" Ice told her, hands resting gently on the bare skin of her back. \"For the rest of my life. And even when I'm gone, I want to know that you'll be fine. This is the only guaranteed way for that.\" The Aviator explained. \"I know it's not the perfect wedding that little girls think of when they're kids, but if you'll have me, I will do my best to make you as happy as I am when I'm with you. What do you say?\" \"Shut up,\" Sam giggled. \"It's perfect. I can't promise you anything easy.\" Sam laughed, leaning in closer, face an inch away, breath tickling Tom's face. \"I'm not going to be one of those usual military wives,\" She smiled, shaking her head. \"No, I didn't ask you to be,\" He answered, cracking a grin. \"You're going to be the one that goes to work, and can't cook to save a life, and I wouldn't have it any other way. I want you, Sam. Always have. Always will.\" \"Promise?\" \"On my wings, and my life, and my heart.\" He answered. Samantha grinned. \"Is that a yes?\" \"Of course it's a yes, you moron!\" She laughed. \"We're going to get married, and I am going to love you the rest of my life. Is that good enough for you, Tom?\" \"You're my girl, Sam,\" He smiled, leaning up for a kiss. \"That will always be good enough.\" It hadn't been the easiest, but they'd made it, Iceman thought to himself. Nearly thirty years had passed since that day when he'd asked Sam to marry him, practically out of nowhere. He didn't even have a ring at the the time, and they'd had nearly no money for a house together. Ice didn't get stationed all over the world, fortunately, which made life easier for everyone. Tom Kazansky had chosen to remain at Top Gun with as an Instructor, his current friend Pete Mitchell right there with him. The wedding hadn't been much. Nearly none of their family had been able to make it to it, and it hadn't exactly been before they graduated. Just Tom's Cousin Mark and a few Aunts and Uncles of Sam's. Not enough time to work out the particulars. But as soon as he'd gotten back from the crisis situation Sam had been waiting with an old white dress that only came down to her knees that she'd had for years. Tom put on the only tux he had, and since Slider had gone to visit family with his time off, Maverick had been his best man. And it had been perfect. To appease Sam's and his family, there had been a vow renewal ceremony a few months later, with a reception, which is really what everyone had wanted in the first place. But Samantha put on her wedding dress that had never been intended for a wedding, and he wore that tux, and even though everyone knew they were already married, everyone there treated it no different than any other wedding. It was barely a year after they'd been married when Sam found out she was pregnant, and approximately nine months later, Thomas David Kazansky Jr. had been born, screaming into the world, immediately loved by his Parents. He inherited his Mother's spectacular grey eyes, but as he grew older, came to look every inch like his Father, even joining the Naval Aviators, too. A little less than three years later, his girls had graced their home. Twins, Emma and Jordan, with their mother's red hair and disposition. But they'd gotten his ice cool nerves, along with Tom's height, and blue eyes. Emma became a Lawyer, and Jordan went on to be a fairly successful Artist. Every once in a while, throughout the years, Samantha would pause and give him an odd look, asking, \"Good enough?\" In reference to the conversation they'd had the night he'd proposed. And every time, He replied with a smile and a gentle kiss, \"Always.\" This is just a one shot. Not planning to do more, just had an idea that came to me, about Iceman, and if he'd had a girlfriend during the events of the movie, how Goose's death might've made him think. And in the movie, in the scene where Iceman offers condolences, to me it almost seemed like he had a little bit of personal experience with things like that, can and do happen in jets. This is an exception to my normal rules about third person, because I didn't feel like trying to put myself in Iceman's head. I hope you guys liked this. ","Summary":" I do not own Top Gun.

He had a heart attack and... BAM! So now I just might have to move out of the house I currently live in. On the upside, hopefully I can get moved into a place close to Cap & Co where I work. Forgot what games or cartoons I was going to use in this one, and please forgive me for the title as I couldn't think of the best word that 'Top' would work with. But as I'm on a kick with the Bloody Roar games, I figure I'll use them in this. This one will be just a oneshot of the first mission in Top Gun movie, unless people review it suggesting me to continue. Disclaimer: Top Gun belongs to Paramount pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer Films. Bloody Roar belongs to Activision and Hudson. Yu-Gi-Oh GX and the Jetroid, (the jet the Good guys will fly,) belongs to Kazuki Takahashi. And the \"Red Scorpion Flyer\" from Mortal Kombat Defenders of the Realm cartoon belongs to... whoever owns the cartoon. Sorry I don't remember who they are. The sun was slowly rising, the sky glowing with a rosy red hue. From the ground alongside a long deserted road, there opened a great passage. Up came a platform on which rested a small red jet with what looked like eyes just below the cockpit on both sides. The engine roared as the pilot powered up the vehicle. And with great speed, the jet took off into the sky. Shortly after the first jet took off, there was a second jet raised onto the platform. And again, as the pilot powered up, the jet burst to the end of the runway and took off into the sky. Inside the Base: Workers sat at control pannels, some came through doors wishing their 'Good Mornings', and some wore headsets on their heads. \"AK, this is Home Plate,\" said the man watching the large circular radar screen. \"We have unknown aircraft inbound. Vector 1-7-5 for Bogey.\" Enemy jet appearance: The craft was red, with a dome-shaped front on the cockpit. If one were to see it from the front, they could see the pilot, the support between their legs, and the handlebar-like controls he used to steer the craft. There was also what looked like claws, or pincers, protruding from the sides, and a large, curved, tail on the back. The craft's design gave it the look of a giant flying scorpion. Inside the Base: A large, massively muscular fellow stepped toward his subordinate. \"Who's up there?\" he asked in his deep, bold voice. \"Uriko and Alice, and Yugo and Jenny,\" replied the subordinate. \"Just great,\" Alan Gado grumbled. \"Yugo and Jenny.\" With the Pilots: \"Talk to me, Jen,\" Yugo called over his shoulder from the pilot's seat. \"Copy, I got it,\" replied Jenny. \"Contact, 15 left, 45 miles, 700 knots closure.\" \"Uriko, ya hear that, kiddo?\" Yugo asked to the other Jetroid. \"Copy,\" Uriko replied. Then she called over her shoulder. \"Alice, you got it?\" \"Copy, I got radar contact,\" replied Alice. \"If I get Visual ID, Uriko, you hook him,\" Yugo said. \"Copy, and I'll shake 'em and bake 'em,\" Jenny smiled. Inside the Base: Through the speakers in the ground base, Yugo called in his report: \"Home Plate, this is AK, 409. I got him inbound, heading 3-4-7 at 15 miles. 700 knots closure.\" \"AK, take Storm, 15 Left, 4-0\" replied the radar worker. \"Are we expecting visitors today?\" Gado asked. \"Negatory, sir,\" replied another worker, a little snarkily. With the Pilots: \"Alice, check if he's a single, would ya?\" Uriko asked. \"Copy,\" Alice replied, looking to the radar. Something didn't seem right about the blip. \"Jenny, you see a trailer?\" \"Negative, Bunny,\" Jenny replied. \"Looks to be a single.\" \"Uriko, I'm gonna go head-to-head with him,\" Yugo called. \"Please be careful, Yugo, I don't like this stuff. I'll climb higher and see if he's actually alone.\" And so Uriko pulled the jet into a steady climb, she and Alice donning their oxygen masks. Meanwhile, Yugo and Jenny had donned their own masks, ready for a possible dogfight. \"A thousand knots closure, Yugo,\" Jenny called. \"He's coming straight for us.\" \"All right buddy,\" Yugo muttered to himself, \"what's got you jumpy?\" But suddenly, the craft banked to the left, and there was a second craft right behind. \"Holy damn! There's two of them!\" Yugo cried. The two enemy craft zoomed past Yugo and Jenny. Jenny quickly glanced over her shoulder. \"Scorpios Rojas! No one's lived to tell the tale of these as of yet!\" Inside the Base: \"What the Hell are those doing here?!\" Gado fumed. \"What's their position?\" \"Two hundred senventy-five miles, sir,\" replied the subordinate. \"Two hundred seventy-five miles? Get rid of them!\" Gado spat. With the Pilots; Yugo: \"Uriko, go get Red 1. I'm going after Red 2.\" With Uriko: \"He disappeared in the sun,\" she said, looking around. \"Shoot! What's he doing?! Alice, you got him back there?\" Alice glanced over her shoulder. Sure enough, there was the red aircraft, speeding toward the back of their jet. \"He's coming around! He's gonna get right on our tails!\" And before they knew it, he was in position. \"Ah, Damn it! This bogey's all over me!\" Uriko cried, trying to shake off the bandit. Inside the Base: \"What's their range now?\" Gado asked. \"Two hundred twenty-five miles, sir,\" \"They break a hundred seventy-five miles, dispatch the emergency 3 aircraft,\" Gado ordered. \"Yes, sir.\" With Yugo and Jenny: \"Airspeed 400. Go get him, Yugo!\" Jenny exclaimed. \"I'm going for Target Lock,\" Yugo replied, clicking the loce button. He began to whisper to himself. \"Come on, lock up buddy. Lock up-\" The system toned like the flatline signal on a Hospital Heart Monitor. \"I got him locked!\" exclaimed Yugo. \"Bingo.\" But Yugo hoped he could scare the enemy off. And thankfully, it worked like a dream. The scorpion pilot banked, and zoomed off as fast as he could. \"We got him, Yugo! He's bugging out and heading home!\" Jenny cheered. \"Home Plate, this is Yugo. Red 2 is headed home.\" Inside the Base: \"What's their position?\" Gado asked. \"Two hundred twenty miles and bearing 2-1-0, sir,\" responded the subordinate. With Uriko and Alice: The flatline tone sounded, indicating the Scorpion pilot had locked onto them. \"Uriko, he's locked onto us! Get away from this creep!\" Alice cried. \"He's engaging me!\" Uriko cried, banking left and right, trying to avoid the shot. \"Damn it, Home Plate, this is AK 4-1-5, this bogey's all over me! He's got Target Lock on me! May I have permission to fire?\" \"Do not fire unless fired upon,\" Gado responded. Fortunately, Yugo and Jenny had caught up to the fight. \"Jenny, there they are, right below us,\" Yugo called over his shoulder. \"The Red's in perfect position,\" Jenny replied. \"He's right on Uriko's rear.\" Yugo shook his head. \"No way, Jen. He'd have fired by now. He's just trying to tick us off.\" \"Yugo, get down here and get this bastard off me!\" Uriko cried. \"Easy, kitty. Bring it back hard left, help me engage,\" Yugo said quietly. Then as he watched Uriko's Jetroid turn hard to the left, he added; \"I'm on my way.\" Yugo made his way behind the Scorpion and followed the pilot's every move. After a while he got frustrated. \"I can't shoot this S.O.B. Let's try aand have a little fun with him.\" And so he made his way up above his enemy and rolled upside-down. \"Is this your idea of 'Fun', Yugo?\" Jenny asked, her stomach beginning to turn. \"Greetings!\" Yugo laughed as the enemy pilot gazed upward at him and Jenny. Then he gazed at Jenny, who held a mobile phone. \"Watch the birdie!\" she exclaimed. Then she flashed the phone's camera light. The pilot looked around in a daze, disoriented from the bright flash. \"Jeez, do I crack myself up!\" Yugo continued to laugh as he rolled the jet upright. The Red Scorpion jet disappeared. \"This is a great shot, Yugo,\" Jenny stated proudly. \"I ought to look into work in photography.\" \"Uriko,\" Yugo called over the commlink. \"Your back's clear, Red 1 has bugged off.\" Inside the cockpit of her Jetroid, Uriko was shaking with fear, her breathing shaky and uneven. Yugo spoke again, moving his jet beside hers. \"Uriko, this is Yugo. We've had enough fun for today, don't ya think? I'm getting a bit low on fuel, so Jenny and I will head to base. We'll see you on the ground.\" And with that, Yugo turned his jet and piloted his way back to the base. Uriko's jet didn't move. \"Uriko, we're running low on gas,\" Alice called. \"We need to get out of here.\" No response from the pilot's seat, so Alice tried again. \"Uriko?\" Her only move was to take off her mask. \"Uriko, come on, Uriko.\" Alice called. Back at the Base: \"Just take it back to the base now. Con on Uriko,\" they heard Alice keep saying over the speakers. \"Get them on deck as soon as possible,\" Gado ordered. \"They must be low on fuel.\" With Uriko and Alice: \"Uriko we've got to land this bird. We are way low on gas. You understand me?\" With Yugo: He was slowly but surely making progress, his landing gear already down. \"Yugo, you're at half a mile. Call the ball.\" \"Copy. Yugo has the ball,\" he responded. \"Uriko, it's time to land, now let's do it!\" Alice's voice cried over the speaker. \"Jenny, Uriko's in trouble,\" he said. \"Come on, Yugo,\" she responded. \"We're getting low on gas. Let's land this sucker.\" \"URIKO!\" That did it. Enough was enough. Yugo yanked the joystick and practically threw the Throttle stick forward. The Jetroid took off into the sky again as Yugo turned around. \"What are you doing, Wolf Boy?! We've got no fuel for this!\" Jenny protested. \"We're going after Uriko.\" Inside the Base: Gado was getting furious. \"You tell them to land that jet, that's a Direct Order!\" With Uriko: \"AK, you are instructed to land. Land Immediately!\" came the voice over the speaker. Fortunately, Yugo flew up beside their jet at about the same time. \"Any of you kids see a runway around here?\" Yugo asked, half joking. \"Yugo, we got a problem up here.\" Alice called. \"That Red really scared the poor kitty. I don't think she can get back.\" \"You're all right, Uriko,\" Yugo soothed. \"Just stay on my wing, and I'll take you all the way in. Just stay with me.\" Uriko squinted her eyes, shuttered, and then thought about her mother, Mitsuko. That did it. She was going to trust her friend, and bring the jet safely down, if only so she could see her mother again. Slowly, the two Jetroids made their way towards the Base Runway. \"Easy, Kitten,\" Yugo whispered. \"Just a stroll in the park, baby.\" He glanced at Uriko's jet. \"A little low. You're a little low.\" he warned. Uriko gasped and covered her mouth with her mask, almost putting it back over her face. \"Come on, Kitty, pull it up,\" he instructed. She just shuttered. \"Pull up, Uriko,\" Yugo repeated. And she slowly pulled the jet back up to his height. \"That's it. Almost there.\" But her jet was slowly beginning to drop again. \"Uriko, you're well below standard glide path. Half a mile. Call the ball.\" \"Cop- Copy, Ball,\" Uriko nervously acknowledged. Lower and lower the jet dropped, Uriko getting more and more nervous. \"Pull up!\" Alice's voice suddenly broke her train of thought. \"Some more power.\" Suddenly, she was going a little fast, and almost at the hanger. \"Holy! Put on the brakes!\" Alice cried. She yanked the Throttle stick back, and the hook on the back of the jet caught on the rope. The Jet screeched to a halt, only thirty feet from the hanger, and the engine began to make sound like it was shutting down. Perhaps it had run out of fuel at that moment as well. One could almost hear Uriko's sigh of relief over the loud engine noise, even from outside the cockpit. End Notes: Whew! Toosk a few days, but I finally got it. Whoever notices mistakes I might have made, don't even say it in your Review. The actual Top Gun movie made mistakes too. For instance: Wouldn't there be a Fuel Tanker Jet up there to refuel them if they needed it? I certainly think there would (And SHOULD) have been myself. I lost my old man it took a few days, and I'm really messed up right now. Give me a break! If you must review, tell me if you want the story to be based on the whole movie, and which Bloody Roar characters should be which Top Gun characters. Cast: Stringer: Gado the Lion Maverick: Yugo the Wolf Goose: Jenny the Bat Cougar: Uriko the Half Beast Merlin: Alice the Rabbit Mig 1: Shenlong the Tiger Mig 2: Busuzima the Chameleon Who here wants me to do a story where: The Bloody Roar characters read Fan-Fictions about themselves The Bloody Roar characters live domesticated, Seinfeld lives Sort of a Bloody Roar version of Transatlantic Evolution by Kittie La Rue.

Not a masterpiece of a movie by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm not really picky about things. And most things can be compensated by hot guys and cool airplanes. The whole thing with Goose was so sad, I had to write something. Hope people enjoy! August, 2000: Nellis Airforce base was hot pretty much year round, but in August it was at it's worse. The sun beating down on the Nevada desert, combined with the constant presence of aircraft exhaust clouding around the base made the summer seasons unbearable. It was a kind of heat that you could never get used to. It was near impossible to sit still, so any free time a pilot got was spent in search of a fan. Sam had found a working one inside a bar, which would be deserted until evening, and had laid down roots there. He stared off into space, sitting perfectly still. He was very good at doing nothing; almost as good as he was at flying. He didn't hear the footsteps until there was a shadow looming over him, a female voice clearing her throat. He looked up at her to see she had black hair, pulled into a low pony tail, and dark eyes. \"Are you the one they call 'Duck'?\" She asked. \"That's my call sign.\" He sighed resignedly, realizing his relaxation time was no doubt coming to an end. Instead of giving instructions or handing down orders, she dug around behind the bar for a moment, finding a bottle of whiskey and pouring herself a glass. \"You want one?\" She offered. \"Sure.\" She handed him a cup, which he took. She was wearing a flight suit, like him, and a pair of sunglasses rested on top of her head. She was tall, but stocky in build. She had familiar features, but he was sure he hadn't met her before. \"Got yourself a nice spot here.\" She commented. \"Hiding from someone?\" Like strange woman who steal booze? Sam thought, but bit his tongue. \"Nope, just unwinding.\" He ran a hand through his dirty blonde hair, still sticky with sweat. He'd seen pictures of himself as a much younger boy, when his hair had been pure blonde. But like his dad, by the time he was in his late teens, his hair had darkened to a brownish color. They sat in silence for a while. Sam didn't mind this—he was perfectly content to ignore the presence of others. He was a man of few words. \"Why are you so quiet?\" She asked, after a while of sipping her drink wordlessly. He looked at her like she was crazy. \"Because I don't know who you are, maybe?\" She held out a hand. \"I'm Dare.\" He shook her smaller hand. \"Duck, as you already know.\" \"You have a weird call sign.\" \"Yours is weird, too.\" \"Why'd you chose Duck?\" \"Cause 'Goose' was already taken.\" \"Who wanted Goose?\" \"My dad.\" \"Oh,\" She said. \"I guess that would be confusing. Two men in the same family, one name.\" \"Doesn't matter.\" Sam dismissed. \"He died a while ago.\" It'd still be confusing, though, had been his initial rational. So he'd thought of something similar, to show respect. She didn't seem surprised by this. He wondered why he'd blurted that out to a stranger. It wasn't something he was keen on discussing. He changed the subject as best he could. \"How'd you chose your call sign?\" She smiled ruefully. \"My dad, too.\" She didn't elaborate, he didn't prod. Two fathers up in the air, though Sam's had been Navy, not Airforce like himself. He wondered ideally which one Dare's was in. \"How'd your dad die?\" She asked, rather bluntly, Sam thought. \"Training in Top Gun. Had to eject, but canopy malfunctioned and got stuck. He broke his neck on impact.\" \"Jesus.\" She was sympathetic, but again, didn't seem surprised. \"I was five, at the time.\" He said, emotionless. \"How's your dad?\" \"Retired, with my mom. Both had ties to the military.\" \"That's good.\" \"Yeah, I suppose it is.\" A half smile graced her lips. \"They come down and visit me here sometimes.\" Sam nodded, glancing at her face again. The familiarity there was starting to bug him. He could swear he'd seen that nose, those eyes, somewhere before. Not in a long time, but definitely before. What the fuck? He thought, thoroughly puzzled. He steered away from thinking about his father, or Dare, or anything, and fixed his eyes on the wall. \"Well, I better be off.\" She said after a while. \"Nice meeting you.\" \"Likewise.\" He looked her in the eyes. \"If you don't mind me asking, what's your real name?\" She'd been heading toward the door, but stopped, a slow smile spreading across her face. \"Anita.\" She replied. \"Anita Mitchell.\" \"Sam.\" He introduced himself. \"I know.\" She said, standing on the threshold, silhouetted by afternoon light. \"I did seek you out, after all. We should fly together some time.\" She padded away soundlessly, without another word. Mitchell, Sam thought. Yes, I believe I know that name. A man called Maverick, a long time ago... Seeing as there were no airplanes to fly at that moment, Sam returned to his second best skill. The blank wall had never had so much attention placed on it as it did that afternoon, sa Sam thought over the encounter. \"Great balls of fire.\" He murmured, smiling to himself.

Iceman was fiercely independent and wouldn't compromise on this. Slider was well aware of this little fact. But it didn't stop him from backing up his pilot in every confrontation. It didn't stop him from placing an arm around the back of his chair. It didn't stop him from praising the blond every once in a while. It didn't stop him from checking up on him.

Sitting casually on the harbor, writing intensely into what looked like a thick, ancient journal. It was made of those brown recycled paper materials that you often found on scrapbooks. Her brown wavy hair gently tousled in the autumn wind. Maverick had that feeling- yep, she was definitely the one. \"Go on, man! Don't be such a wussy,\" The ever supportive Goose nudged his best friend and in other words, most trusted sidekick. Maverick was fidgeting with a loose thread on his Top Gun Aviator Jacket. \"Yeah, yeah. I will...just give me a minute...so number one right? The good old song? I hope she knows it.\" \"One look at her at you've turned into such a pussycat. BE A MAN. M-A-N. That's who you are, now go show her!\" Goose pushed Maverick towards the bench, and Maverick quickly glanced back at Goose. At the same time, he was walking towards the bench. Goose did a head gesture indicating him to, well, simply put, move it. Maverick was about 3 feet away from her. He positioned his guitar in a way that meant he was ready to play. Of course, she was already looking at him. And then, he went off to strum a few chords and dazzled off into a very z tune. What I want, you've got But it might be hard to handle Like the flame that burns the candle The candle feeds the flame Yeah yeah What I got Full stock of thoughts and dreams that scatter And you pull them all together And how I can't explain oh yeah Well well you You make my dreams come true Maverick grinned confidently. He didn't really care about hitting all the right notes, but it was a song he knew that she would love. While he was singing, she was already blushing. Charlie stood up and faced Maverick, trying to suppress a smile but obviously failing. \"So... you like me,\" Maverick was still having on his brilliant smile, but his tone was a little too cheeky to handle. \"Ahhh. Well, you like me don't you?\" Charlie was fumbling with her words. What she really wanted to say was a huge 'Yes!' but of course she wouldn't make it that easy for him. \"Something like that.\" \"So what's it like?\" \"Its like...\" Maverick leaned forward to kiss her. Just like that, Maverick completely stole her heart. The sun was about to set, and the sky kept changing colors within minutes- from a misty purple to a warm auburn with streaks of blue and then a glowing orange. There's no denying it, but it looked like a perfect postcard together with the silhouettes of the two. CHAPTER 2 The bar was lit cozily, and Goose managed to book a booth for the guys- Maverick, Iceman and Rocket. The only ones who were expecting dates were Goose and Maverick. Iceman and Rocket were peering around the vicinity, keeping a look out for possible candidates. Goose noticed that this was a little too odd. \"Seriously, can you guys be any more obvious? If you watch them like a hawk no woman's gonna come to you man!\" Maverick joined in as well. \"Yeah. Just go, talk to them. Go! Now.\" He did a little head gesture to a brunette sitting alone at the bar-table. She was dressed in a mid-length turquoise dress and very, very high heels. \"Dibs!\" Rocket announced and he set off towards her direction. Charlie and Meg walked into the bar, and spotted Maverick's table. Charlie was wearing navy skinnies, a white shirt and a floral cloth necklace with a little sapphire studded on it. Meg's grey toga dress draped over her shoulders, which sparkled with a dash of glitter she put earlier on. \"Hey. You look great.\" Maverick gave his signature smile to Charlie. \"Thanks! So you do.\" Goose gave Meg a kiss on the cheek. This was followed by an awkward silence and an even more awkward moment for Maverick, because he didn't know if he was expected to do the same to Charlie. He didn't really think much, but he just leant over and gave her a kiss too. The group talked, and talked and talked for about 2 hours or more. Of course, they continuously ordered bar food like chips & dip, calamari, spiced nuts and needless to say, pints of beer. The next day Goose had a flight, so he left early with Meg. Maverick had a flight as well, and it was a pretty important day for him. But then again, he's Maverick. Anything's possible with him. Charlie was a little concerned. \"Hey mav, you sure you don't wanna leave now? It's getting late...and you have to be at base at 7am\" \"No problem. I'll be there at 7 for sure.\" He gave a little wink and a cheeky grin. Charlie rolled her eyes. \"Seriously mav, its a big day for you tomorrow. It's a tough round this time but if you ace it...first place might be secured\" \"I know. But you, I can ace other things.\" \"Like what?\" \"Got you to go out with me. It looked pretty bleak at first you know. You were practically breathing the pages of that journal of ours\" \"Yeah... you got lucky.\" \"I've got what you want...but it might be hard to handle...\" \"I don't think it'll be hard to handle.\" Her gaze was fixed on him as she smiled and walked out of the bar. \"I sure got lucky,\" Maverick thought and did a little laugh to himself as he followed her out into Seafront Avenue.

I'm sweaty,soaked through with sweat,and I feel nauseous,I already threw up before we got in the plane,but he doesn't know that,didn't want him to. \"Y-yeah, I'm still dizzy Goose, I feel kinda sick to my stomach too,\"I murmur as I let him undo my harness,helping me slip my arms through. \"OK kid, I'm going to get you out of here alright, medical is waiting for us Petey, no room for argument alright, it looks like you got heat stroke\"he murmurs looking into my blue eyes for confirmation as I somehow get my legs out of the harness and I'm ready to stand on my own,albeit unsteadily. I'm too tired to argue, I know he's right,I know I need to get checked out,get cooled down. \"OK\"I murmur softly letting him card a cool rough hand through my dark hair as I let him help me stand,then he guides me to the exit. I manage to get out, and true to his word medical is waiting with a gurney. I let them help me,and they get me over to the gurney,where they help me lay down and strap me in. They introduce themselves, it's a man and a lady this time, the lady introduces herself as Lena, and the man is Johnny,people I haven't seen before,but I know they'll take good care of me. I feel her place a cool hand against my cheek,checking for temperature which I'm sure is not good. \"Hey there, I'm Lena, this is Johnny,we're going to take care of you alright Pete, we're going to take you to the truck over there and then we'll get you back to medical alright, can you tell me what happened,you're burning up\"she murmurs as I feel them start to move me,I sense Goose following not too far behind. \"OK, I'm not sure,I've been feeling off all day,I've been trying to keep hydrated and cool, I thought I was OK enough to fly this afternoon,but I started feeling dizzy mid flight so we came back down,I threw up once, before hand\"I murmur softly as I hear the truck bed being laid down,and I hear Goose quietly swear,he's not happy that I threw up and didn't tell him. I feel them lift me and they get me into the back of the truck, taking the wheels down and laying the gurney flat on the truck bed. \"Alright, I think you have heat stroke honey,people have been dropping left and right from it, we'll get you to medical,and they'll get a temp on you and start cooling you down\"she murmurs as I see her partner get up beside her,and Goose does the same. Before I know it we take off,and I let her start to check me over. She get's my vitals, I know my pulse is fast,she listens to my heart,unzipping my flight suit to do so. Then we're there,at medical before I know it, I'm a little out of it honestly,which is unnerving, I hate not being in control. I hear the tailgate come down, then they're lifting the gurney as a unit getting it onto the ground,wheels ready,then it's time to go inside. \"We're here honey, it's going to get a little crazy once we get inside alright,a lot of people\"she murmurs carding a hand through my hair, \"OK\"I murmur,knowing from too many experiences what to expect. They get me inside and into an exam room,where a doctor and a nurse are waiting for me. They get the gurney into the middle of the room,and after a quick hand squeeze from Goose,they get kicked out, not enough room,and they want to examine me in quiet. The doctor introduces himself as as he puts on a pair of gloves and comes over to me. \"Hey Pete,I'm ,we'll be taking care of you today that's alright, Jennifer will be helping me, I've heard your not feeling so hot today,can you tell me what's going on\"he asks as I let him squeeze my knee,then he starts working on getting my shoes off. \"I'm not sure,I've been feeling off all day,I just figured it was the damn heat,I've been doing my best to keep hydrated and stay cool,but I got worse this afternoon, I threw up before the flight,once I threw up I felt better sorta,OK,so I thought I could fly, but I got dizzy mid air, we got down OK thankfully,thanks to my partner\"I murmur softly as I feel the nurse card a hand through my hair. \"OK, I think you got heat stroke,I'm going to go ahead and get these clothes off of you,start cooling you down,I'll get a temp on you as well\"he says gently looking at me and then the nurse. I nod too tired to say anything and I let them get started. He cuts off my flight suit,starts from the bottom,then he get's my shirt off,there's times the nurse helps him turn me on my side,then they're done with that part. They keep me on my side as I see the nurse grab the thermometer and some Vaseline. I let them get my temp,and it's not good, 104 I hear him murmur,that's way too high. \"That's what I thought kid, it's pretty high, I'm going to finish looking you over,get you hooked up to the heart monitor,then I want to get you started on some cool fluids and you can rest\"he says gently as I see him take off his old gloves and put on a new pair. \"OK\"I murmur softly as I let them roll me back over onto my back. I let them finish looking me over,getting me hooked up to a monitor, then they set me up with an iv with cool fluids. \"We'll see if this does the trick, this should re hydrate you,and cool you down,if your temp isn't down in 30 minutes we'll try the next step,we'll pump cool water into your stomach, I'm going to get you on oxygen as well\"he says gently as I let the nurse slip on a cannula, then I nod \"OK\"I murmur softly,I'm so tired and just done,I hope we don't get to that point,but we might. \"OK, try to get some rest alright kid,I'll be back shortly to check on you,see if your temperature has come down any\"he says squeezing my knee as I nod tiredly,then he and the nurse leave,leaving me on my own. Before I know it I'm falling asleep,tired from everything,the last thoughts on my mind being of worry,worry that I'm going to be OK, worry about what I put us through today,it was stupid of me to think I could fly,it put us in real danger,and worry about what will happen next if this doesn't work.

Disclaimer: The appropriate owners own Top Gun and all related characters. This story is for entertainment purposes only. Summary: Maverick is in need of a fuel injection in his life, and Ice is willing to oblige him. Also includes \"A New Day\". Maverick knew the word love. He loved to fly fast and ride hard. Every time he took to the sky he felt it, rushing through his veins, arousing every sensation, satisfying every thrill, and fulfilling every dream. He was wild and free. And he couldn't get enough, taking his love of turbo to the road in his two-wheeled machine. The thrill was less. It was a different feeling, but the principles were the same. Riding, ruling and flying. Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell was a fighter pilot. One of the most loved and loathed among all who knew him. He had been called many things; usually \"dangerous\", but Maverick disputed that, he liked being the center of attention and showing off his flamboyant skills in the air, but he never really considered himself dangerous. That was until Goose died. The death of his best friend had hit him hard. He felt responsible somehow, if it wasn't for his impatience, Goose may still be alive. After that disaster, he had walked away, quit on the life he loved. He remembered having a 'heat-to-heart' with Jester. He couldn't help but think that he was making a mistake; that Goose wouldn't have wanted him to run away the way he did. He was advised to \"Let him go.\" He'd never do that. Jester had good intentions, but forgetting the ones lost was easier said than done. And it wasn't a good idea repressing so much pain, especially in the job they did, and with Maverick already having a reputation as being dangerous, the rest of the guys were wary he'd lost his magic touch and understandably they doubted him. He proved them wrong. Got back in the seat and saved the day. Proved them Maverick could still function. But ever since then, he'd felt different. Lived for the turbo running through his veins. He'd looked at his priorities differently too, As soon as he had got to the diner after all the excitement. His girlfriend Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood was there. She was the last thing he wanted to see since she had quite happily broken off their relationship not long before to accept a high profile job elsewhere. He had already made his peace and said goodbye. It was not a good feeling seeing her again. She felt like a stranger to him, despite being the very same woman he'd chased after for weeks. Thinking about it, Maverick came to realize afterwards, that he'd acted like a jerk before, leading her on like some booty call or one-night-stand seemed like something more solid. It puzzled him how some silly little song and lame-ass bar flirting with Goose's assistance ended up lasting so long. But then he remembered; she turned out to be an instructor at Top Gun. Yeah, that was awkward. He couldn't shake her even if he wanted to. And just like he had played games flirting with her, she too had played games with him. Unfortunately for Maverick, Charlie was ambitious, she wanted to go places and not remain in some would-be happy family situation with Maverick. She did stay. For a few months before they both agreed they should move on; it was mutual that way. After graduation, Maverick stayed on at Top Gun, teaching. Yeah, it was a little less exciting than his life on the skies, but he needed to cool down for a while. Get used to being single again after a nearly a year playing cat and mouse with Charlie. Instructing wasn't all it was cut out to be. Sure, he got to show off and fly, manage to keep his reputation in some ways but it wasn't satisfying his needs. He needed more. \"Commander, could I see you in my office for a minute?\" Jester had softly knocked on his office door before quickly poking his head through the crack. Maverick looked up at him from his paperwork. \"What's wrong with my office?\" Maverick had a smirk on his face. He still looked about twenty years old, despite being in his mid-thirties. The only thing that was different was his sporting goatee. Jester was looking ragged and tired, but managed a nod as he sidestepped around the door and closed it quietly behind him. Maverick leaned back in his leather chair, it squeaked, and put his palms flat on the desk in front of him. He could already tell that this was going to be an awkward conversation for Jester, who hardly ever acted in a manner that wasn't straight to the point and the way he wasn't making eye contact until he stood—not sat, in front of Mavericks desk. \"Listen. Maverick… I've been here for a long time. Longer than I should have really.\" Jester held his hands in his lap, fidgeting with his wedding band. Mavericks face dropped, he knew this was coming but didn't expect to hear it so soon. \"I'm retiring. This coming month.\" The room fell into a silence. Maverick could only offer a sharp nod in response having no idea of what to say. One side of him was completely distraught, a man he had come to look on as a father, leaving. On the other side, Maverick was excited; it meant change, something he had desperately been seeking. But either way he felt for Jester, he had always expressed love for his job and pure passion. He was patient enough to keep Maverick on board after all. \"Oh man…\" was all he said regarding this situation. It was shocking to him really; like getting splashed with cold water. He had put his hands to the back of his head, leaning his head back in the chair. Jester seemed to be curiously quiet, but maverick was grateful, he needed some time to process this information. \"So…\" He said finally, after taking a deep breath. \"Who's gonna… you know.\" Take over. He didn't want to say the words though—he was trying to be sensitive since if he were retiring he wouldn't like to hear who was going to replace him. Jester nodded, appreciating Mavericks rare demonstration of tact. \"It's not you.\" He said sternly. Maverick had to double take at that. \"Hey—no, no. I wouldn't want…\" he stuttered, earning a raised hand from the older pilot just to imply his comment wasn't intended to fluster him in any way. \"It's Kazansky, Maverick.\" His words cut. He leaned forward to brace against the desk once more. There was that awkward silence again. \"Kazansky.\" He stated it, but meant it as a question. \"Iceman.\" His answer was met with a solemn nod. Maverick had to think about this; his old rival from Top Gun. He hadn't seen him in god knows, ten years? Twenty? It felt like a lifetime since those good old days of alpha rivalry and chest poking. He'd heard from him every so often. They hadn't really kept in touch though. He heard from Slider strangely once maybe a year. The Iceman was much more elusive than his blunt RIO. He liked Slider once the whole rivalry thing fizzled out, it was almost a shame when Slider and Iceman teamed up, and they always gave him crap about him being reckless. They were usually just trying to rile him up, but the nicknames stuck. \"Yeah. He'll be here in a week so I can show him the ropes.\" Jester made a move like he was about to leave, but brought his hands out from behind his back and leaned against the desk. \"So play nice.\" He smiled behind his moustache. Maverick would have smiled back if he wasn't so shell-shocked. Maverick lay awake on the top of his bed, fully dressed and thinking. Well, not thinking. Trying to think. Trying to have an opinion on what the hell happened. Maybe this was the change he had been looking for. He sighed, wide-eyed and staring at the ceiling of his two-floor house. He lived just off base. Not too far away, but far enough to show off some more and ride through the empty early morning streets. He looked over at the red, blinking lights in his digital alarm clock. 'Just four more hours.' He thought. He was thinking about the Iceman again. Pete Mitchell hadn't thought about Tom Kazansky in a while. Not in detail anyway. Sure, he'd heard from him, but it wasn't like they were best friends or anything. Maverick bit his lip; he wondered what he looked like after all these years, whether he was still a pushover, whether he was still lithe and pretty… Maverick didn't care to think about it, it was reminding him of the past too much, and a guy like Maverick; they didn't look back. But despite this, he still remembered his face. He didn't understand why. He'd all but forgotten the rest of the old gang. But that had more to do with seeing them semi-often. Sometimes they had arranged meetings; Ice never showed though. Hollywood and Wolfman always did, getting heavily drunk and making asses of themselves, but Maverick couldn't help but smile—these were his friends and his family now. Granted they weren't as close as most families, but they all fought together and depended on each other. Bonds like that are hard to break. It seemed like a lifetime away, those youthful days of partying with the guys and having fun. Maverick shook his head in disdain; he wondered how they lost all of their vigor, but in the end the past was the past and that's where it should stay. Remembering a happier time usually led to depression for Maverick, who liked life in the fast lane a little bit more than the slow lane. \"Dangerous…\" He whispered to himself. He had a smile on his face. \"This should get interesting.\" Soaring high on the wings of adrenaline, the skies his only world, Maverick was showing the students how it was done; he blazed so close passed them that the wings almost scraped. Maverick was scaring the hell out of everyone out there, but he needed to do this; he needed to get the old Maverick back. \"Maverick! What the shit?\" A student exclaimed. \"That's commander Maverick to you.\" He flipped off the student and continued on his way to what would become an infamous moment to all concerned. Flying the Iconic Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor head-on into the flight path of an F-14 Tomcat, rolling left and rolling right, they were some distance away but moving in closer—fast. The other pilot lost their nerve, and Maverick took the shot. \"You're dead, Fury.\" \"Damn it!\" She pounded her fists against the controls. \"Tsk. Women.\" \"Shove off Spider.\" \"You know you love it Fury.\" Spider set into action, trying to engage Maverick in a hard-lock. \"Alright commander.\" \"Just you and me Spidey.\" Maverick had Spider on his tail, he narrowed his eyes, forcing his nose forward into a daring Immelmann, changing direction and gaining height, but Spider was good. He reminded him of himself when he a young show-off. He matched his every move with the same lust for thrills like he had. He was secretly proud that this was one of his students. And the dogfight went on just like that; just the two of them in the skies, with everyone else returning to ground, looking up and watching—except Fury, storming off, living up to her call sign. Even Jester had taken a minute out of his pre-retirement business to look out of the window. The fight went on for a while longer, neither one gaining much advantage over the other, both proving to be as skilled as the other. But it ended with a tone; Maverick gaining height advantage over Spider, but somehow Spider sidelined him and forced him to turn and he went in for the kill, getting directly behind Spider. But forcing Maverick into a sure panic, Spider slammed on the brakes and pulled back hard as he looped over and behind Maverick, getting tone. \"Mavericks dead?\" Spider blinked. \"Mavericks dead!\" Radio noise was full of incoherent shouting and whoops of victory. But throughout all of the celebrating, Maverick could taste metal. He was still a sore loser. After landing, Maverick wasted no time in getting up-close and personal with his protégé. On the landing strip, a couple of guys were high-fiving in a typically high-school fashion. 'Jesus please tell me I wasn't like that' Maverick thought, grimacing; he saw so much of himself in Spider and he couldn't help having that feeling at the back of his mind that he was jealous. As Maverick approached, he had a deceptively civil smile, biting back on all he wanted to say wasn't really his style though. \"Was that fun for you Spider?\" His tone was somewhat venous, and the others quickly decided that they wanted no part in this and cleared to the showers. Probably the right idea, unfortunately for Spider, he had to hang about and face whatever was coming. He braced himself, holding his helmet underarm and leaned against the outside of the plane. He shrugged. Maverick gritted his teeth and looked down before letting out a bitter chuckle before coming within inches of the younger man. \"Have something to prove? \"Sir?\" Spider was visibly unnerved by his commanding officer, it seemed quite obvious that Maverick was pissed, but he knew better than to start some war of words with someone so unhinged. Maverick stared him down; it was more than intimidating—hands on hips and his lips parted to a smile. \"Come on then… hit me. I know you want to.\" Maverick grinned. He was starting to scare Spider now, and he wasn't easily scared. He had no response, just decided to be the bigger man, he tried to side-step around Maverick, who was physically about the same height and weight as him; Spider had black hair, slightly longer than Mavericks and blue eyes. He didn't get far though, as Maverick pushed him with both hands. Spider simply raised his hands in a submissive gesture, and dismissed whatever problem Maverick had with him and walked away, leaving the older man steaming and in need of an outlet for his anguish. \"You're dangerous Spider!\" He called out after, watching him enter the bunker. Maverick avoided contact from Jester, he knew him well enough to know he wasn't above slipping in the word hypocrite to their conversation, but he knew the word would get out about Mavericks' outburst eventually—he'd just wait it out until then. Maverick was sitting in his office, cooling down, literally; pressing a cool can of soda against his forehead. He figured he'd just go home and take a shower and crawl in bed with a bottle of Jack and go to sleep. It was getting dark out and Maverick had closed all of the blinds in the small room, lit only by a desk lamp. Maverick was so busy with his self-depreciation, he hadn't noticed the door creak open, and Jester was standing there. Watching him silently. Finally Maverick looked up, and almost startled. \"Hell of a show out there commander.\" \"Drop it… sir.\" Maverick gritted his teeth; Jester raised his brow. He did drop it since Maverick was in a mood far too strange to deal with ever since he told him about his pending retirement. \"Kazansky will be here tomorrow—just got the call.\" Maverick nodded as Jester left as silently as he entered, just after he left the other man with one last warning. \"Play nice.\" Maverick scoffed, he had no intention of 'playing nice'. Maverick was sweating, heart beating like mad. He so wasn't ready for this. Walking into the office, he found a call waiting for him, Tom Kazansky had arrived early which wasn't a surprise really, and was in Jesters' office, getting the run-down. ' Shit …' Maverick thought; He had no reason to intrude, so hung about, hoping to not run into him, which was easy considering how much Jester needed to explain. The first class went relatively smoothly, the odd dick joke flying about as usual and Maverick felt like suicide; they weren't paying any attention to what he was saying. Evidently word had gotten out about Mavericks apparent near-assault of Spider and the whole group was somewhat on edge. He may as well have sat on ass and let it be a class on awkward silences—because that would have given everybody A's. He did, at one point just sit, elbow resting on the desk and his cheek leaning into his hand. He just pressed play on the video and as some boring retro safety briefing tape was playing, Maverick turned his face to the door of the dark classroom; all lights out, to see a familiar yet ghostly face of a memory, watching him, grinning. Standing just behind the door, through the window in the door. It was like watching an impending disaster, he knew it, but he couldn't break away from the Iceman's scrutiny-filled gaze. Maverick tried to smile, but he was frozen, true to the Iceman's call sign. He was a little awestruck, it was dark but he could still see, like an image untainted by time; Iceman looked the same. Aside from his hairstyle, a little straighter, combed. He looked good. 'God, stop messing with my head .' He found himself praying to no particular divinity, Ice was unnerving him. It felt like an unbearably uncomfortable showdown that seemed like none of them moved for an eternity, but actually had only been a few seconds. Ice showed him the mercy he so sought after, and walked on by, but not before offering Maverick a playful, and if not slightly unforgettable chomp of his jaws. Mavericks eyes fluttered down to his desk, he realized he had been chewing a pen, and so stopped that promptly and then turned his attention back to the window to find him gone. He finally smiled. After class, the awkward reunion was still on his mind. He couldn't forget it. It was like watching a light in the black; coming closer, making him warmer inside. 'Something is wrong with me' He said in his head while taking a break in the cafeteria. He felt down, alone. Class had been a disaster—he silently vowed to never again take to the air with his students, he always lost his cool. And he was getting less and less cool thinking about Iceman, his neck felt hot and he needed to pop a button open. At just that moment, he felt a warm but gripping hand on his shoulder and a whisper close to his ear. \"You are still dangerous.\" His lips so close to his skin made Maverick jump right out of his seat and back up against the table. Iceman burst out laughing, Maverick just looked at him with a ' you're crazy' expression on his face. But he couldn't help his emotion shining through and brightly smiling. He grabbed Mavericks hand, which was offered to shake, but Ice gripped tightly and pulled himself in close for a ten-year reunion hug. \"Kazansky, you son of bitch!\" He wrapped his arms around his shoulders, pressing his nose into his shoulder, hiding his bright smile. \"Mitchell.\" It was quiet, but he was close enough to just hear Ice call his name, just. And it was his name, not snidely saying Maverick like he was trying to get to him. \"You look like hell.\" He said, grimacing at Mavericks disheveled appearance when they broke apart—he straightened out Mavericks collar. \"And what is this?\" He smirked and tugged on Mavericks goatee with his thumb and index finger. \"Trying to look like man Maverick?\" There was Maverick again. He was still smirking. Asshole. \"Screw you Ice.\" He nudged Ice's shoulder lightly with his knuckles; he was also smiling, which after some extended eye contact opened them both up to full-blown laughter. \"Man… It's good to see you…dick! Why didn't you get in touch with me?\" He slapped his shoulder, and Iceman's eyes softened, as did his smile. \"You too Mav.\" Ice rolled his eyes and turned his back, starting to walk away. Maverick was confused. \"Hey, where you going?\" Maverick grabbed Ice's sleeve and he simply looked back at him until Maverick released him, awkwardly. Ice then took Maverick by both shoulders and held him firmly for a second. \"Some of us have a new job to get to Mav.\" He whispered. \"Ah, right. I heard. Congratulations.\" Maverick felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up, a sensation he hadn't experienced often. \"Thank-you.\" They were close now, too close for Mavericks comfort, but Ice's eyes and his white toothy smile were dazzling him in some way that drove him to distraction. Ice took a few conceited steps back, hands in his pockets and turned to leave through the double doors of the cafeteria. Maverick had to sit down for a moment; he was sweating and felt dizzy, not a good thing considering his profession. 'Well that was weird.' Maverick was back at class the next hour. It went no less awkwardly, but at some point someone cracked a joke and everyone burst out laughing and the tension had been broken just like that. It was still awkward but the atmosphere had been thinned considerably, and it wasn't an unbearable couple of hours. He was still distracted through it all however and barely said a word—just showed more safety and instruction videos. He was still thinking about Iceman; his new position meant he had some control over his own station and Maverick wasn't so sure that that was a good thing. Later, Iceman appeared once more, it was shorter than before, maybe a little rushed, but nevertheless he opened the door to Mavericks office. \"Drinks at the Officers Club tonight? Good. I'm buying.\" And just left again, not giving Maverick a chance to say whether he was coming out or not. He though that behavior was a little strange, but he needed to wind down after the day he'd had and since Ice was buying who was he to complain? Iceman pretty much considered himself a peacock; a proud and majestic specimen that was meant to be admired, even now, nearing forty, he still had the same mentality, and asking Maverick out was one of the rare lapses of his confidence where he felt self-conscious. But despite his skepticisms, he managed to get Maverick, his former rival, out to the Officers Club, their old hangout. It made him feel old, seeing all the youth of the nineties around flirting and fighting. But he was still a peacock, and dressed in his best whites and made no attempt at humility where his personal appearance was concerned. \"It's getting late Maverick.\" Ice found himself alone sat at the bar, swirling Ice around his glass. He felt pretty stupid, his confidence taken down a notch and his feathers withdrawn. He figured Maverick lost his nerve, but he wanted to wait around just a little more to finish his drink; Tom Kazansky wasn't waiting on anyone who stood him up. Then again, he thought, maybe he should have been a little clearer regarding his intentions, but his palms were sweating so damn much by the time he reached mavericks office, it was all he could do not to let the door handle slip from him. Iceman cursed himself, he had no business asking Maverick out like some cheap bar date, he didn't know what he thinking. But he was sure Maverick had got the signals. He was ready to leave, feeling defeated, he downed his drink and grabbed his coat, turning to leave when look who happened to show; They looked at each other, Maverick looked a little sheepish, and he noted that he had freshened up; shaved and changed, he too appeared to be a peacock. \"Well… look who decided to show up.\" Maverick had to stop in his tracks at that, he had a smile on his face that was suitably cautious, he could never tell with Iceman; whether he was being serious or not. \"Excuse me.\" \"Never mind Maverick, I'm going.\" Ice didn't meet his eyes, he was a little drunk it seemed and staggered—still gracefully somehow past Maverick, but turned his head slightly to look at the other man, who just looked at him with a confused expression. \"But I just got here.\" Maverick offered a half-hearted laugh at this, he wasn't getting what exactly was the Iceman's problem but then again he'd always had a problem with Maverick, but he figured that would have dried up by now. \"Mav. I'm tired.\" Ice pinched the bridge of his nose, shifting his aviators up, and made a sharp move to walk out. \"Tom\" he whispered, not meaning to say Tom so harshly, and grabbed him by the wrist, fingers encircling gently. \"What's your deal?\" Maverick was just looking for a fight he knew it but couldn't turn back now. \"My deal Maverick … is that I don't like getting stood up.\" He was up in Mavericks face now, and his smile was near deceptive, hiding his emotions the best he could, but he balled up his fist, just in case Maverick wouldn't back off. \"What are you talking about? You're crazy.\" Maverick had released Iceman's wrist by this point and had thrown his arms up—the few remaining patrons of the bar raised their heads in interest at the raised voice, but quickly disbanded with Iceman walking out of the club. Maverick thought about following him, but that would have implied far too much, not to mention he didn't want a bloody nose tonight. But something in his mind said Ice would require an apology at some point. But that would have to wait. He stayed at the bar until they closed, having had time for a couple of drinks, he had the strongest he could. His mind was cloudy and he could barely think straight, he could taste metal in his mouth and he couldn't stop thinking about what Ice said. ' I don't like getting stood up. ' He wasn't sure exactly the meaning behind it, but he got that he had somehow inadvertently hurt Ice's feelings, something he regretted and wished he hadn't taken so long making himself look good. Oh my god, did Ice think-? No… Maverick ran a hand through his freshly cut dark hair, feeling stress wash over him. To him, he had always thought Ice had acted a little weird around him, a little too competitive, a little too attentive. And whatever was going on with him and Slider at the time was just in plain sight. Shit. I've been that blind all this time… have I been leading him on? Maverick's thoughts were whirring around his mind so fast he felt dizzy—or possibly it was the alcohol, because he found it hard to stand or walk, let alone drive, and after a miracle, someone had hailed him a cab. \"Well look who it is. Wild night Maverick?\" \"Hollywood?\" Maverick blinked, looking at the man sharing the cab with him. Still under blurred vision, he saw the man whose call sign was Hollywood. He still looked great, Maverick was surprised at how he almost gasped and was left lost for words. Hollywood just showed him a white-toothed perfect smile. He was looking straight ahead at the seat in front though; he glanced sideways to Maverick and nodded in reply. \"God…\" \"Yep that's me.\" He looked back and winked. \"Though people usually call me a combination of the two; usually sort of like; Oh god Hollywood, oh god yeah .\" Maverick chuckled, and relaxed leaning against the seat. Wood had leaned over and was absent-mindedly rubbing his jean-clad crotch. He hadn't changed much, he had been drinking too it seemed. \"Hey 'Wood, you didn't see Kazansky running out around here did ya?\" He asked, finally coming to realize Ice was still on his mind. Hollywood looked over at him, his head coming to rest on Mavericks shoulder in a slumped fashion. \"Who? Ice? Nah man, sorry. I heard he was in town though.\" Both men seemed near to passing out on each other, slurred speech and lazy eyes. Maverick nodded, turning to look at Hollywood, he ended up with his nose in his hair; he smells good … Maverick's mind said, but his senses made him pull back slightly. \"'You seen Wolf?\" He asked quietly, an almost-whisper. \"No… why?\" Maverick hesitated asking why, but he couldn't help it, Hollywood sounded sad, and it worried him. \"Hmm-never mind man, It's my problem, not yours.\" Hollywood wiped his eyes and Maverick suddenly felt uncomfortable. Is he crying? Maverick didn't like this, he didn't care what he and Wolfman got up to in their private lives but he sure as hell wasn't going to get involved in their mess, he had to change the subject fast, before they ended up in some awkward confessions moment. \"Why is it that where Iceman goes, everyone follows?\" Maverick asked. Hollywood seemed to appreciate the change of subject and sat up, taking his head off of Mavericks shoulder and wiping his red eyes with his sleeve discreetly. \"'Cause we're like a family man, some kind of… pssh, I have no idea. I guess it's 'cause he was the best pilot—fuck don't tell anyone I said that!\" They both laughed drunkenly. \"Well… he was the best pilot… and then a certain young go-getter came along.\" Hollywood began pushing his knee against Mavericks in a slow steady rhythm. Maverick gulped, and closed his eyes. This shouldn't be arousing to him, but it was. \"You know; back in Top Gun…\" Hollywood had leaned over again and his lips were practically touching his ear as his arm encircled his shoulders. \"We all wanted you… But Ice had you man; we all knew it, even if you didn't want him… how times change eh, Mav? Hah, god Slider was sooo jealous!\" Hollywood thankfully had disengaged his touchy flirting with Maverick and slumped back in his seat, reminiscing with a smile on his face, giving Maverick some space to breathe, and to hide his erection. \"What are you talking about 'Wood?\" Maverick's cheeks felt hot and he was just grateful that the sight of Hollywood's street had just come into view. The taxi jerked to a stop. \"This is me.\" Hollywood reached for the handle and pulled himself out of the Taxi, while paying the driver. Maverick remained. \"So, hey Maverick, if you need a hint; you were wanting to know where Ice was tonight—I think you know what I mean.\" He winked, lingering at the cabs' door. \"You can come in… you know, if you want.\" Maverick blinked. \"I think I'll pass 'Wood.\" They both smiled as Hollywood nodded and closed the door, saying goodbye with a playful little salute and watching Maverick's taxi leave. Maverick spent the night on the couch, not sleeping much, he was very drunk, and he was surprised how he managed to pull himself away from spending the night with an equally drunk Hollywood. He wouldn't have done that; not so soon after finding out Ice had long since harbored feelings for Maverick. He couldn't help but feel smug at the new knowledge that half of the pilots at Top Gun were gay and found him desirable. He laughed a little to himself, hugging a pillow to his chest. He just laughed. He felt so stupid and clueless, and had finally had the fog cleared from his mind. He thought about it; Ice was gay, without a doubt in his mind now, and had somehow misinterpreted their friendship as being something more implicit. It wouldn't have been such a bad thing if Maverick hadn't had they feeling he'd been breaking heart for quite a few years. He didn't want to deal with this, or how to go about talking to Ice. But he had to be a man for once. Ironic that gay me weren't considered very manly men; but most of the pilots he'd come to know were very manly, and as recent knowledge would have it—very gay. He was thinking in circles for such a long time, he had decided to make coffee and sober up, and then he came to thinking about Charlie, and why they called it quits. He wasn't in love with her; she wasn't in love with him. Could Charlie be? Nah . Maverick had somehow come to the conclusion that the reason they had no spark in their relationship, was because Charlie was a lesbian. So, still a little drunk, he picked up the phone and dialed her number. \"Why did we break up?\" \"Pete what the hell? It's two-thirty in the morning.\" She sounded tired, and vaguely irritated, picking up the phone from her kitchen table, still working through the late hours. \"Why did we break up?\" He repeated, like a slurring robot. \"Have you been drinking?\" Now she was irritated. The last thing she wanted was a drunken early-morning call from an ex-boyfriend. \"Just answer the question Charlie!\" He was shouting and Charlie could already see that this was going to be a fun conversation. \"I don't have time for this.\" She made to hang up, and although Maverick couldn't see her, her language was clear enough to convey her intentions. \"Wait… no, okay.\" He calmed down enough to pretend to be sober. He could hear her sigh but needed his answers. \"I have… questions. Questions that only you can answer.\" \"Just don't break in to song and I'll try my best.\" She deadpanned. \"Okay. Shoot.\" \"Are you a lesbian?\" \"Ahem, you wanna run that one by me again?\" \"Are you… a… Lesbian?\" He spoke slowly, as if talking to a child—it was humiliating to Charlie, who could only blink at his out-of-the blue question. \"Excuse me while I laugh. Okay, done.\" \"It's a serious fucking question!\" He shouted, throwing his hands up in the air as he begun pacing his living room, getting worked up with his ex-girlfriend not giving him a straight answer. \"Okay I'm hanging up now, what is it with you and the potty mouth?\" She rolled her eyes but hung on the line anyway, expecting another apology. \"I mean—It's okay if you are, I mean I get it, it's fine! But… was—was it me? Did I turn you?\" Maverick stuttered, he couldn't bare the thought of turning a woman gay, it was a fairly embarrassing statement against his manhood. But Charlie had had about enough of these drunken ramblings. \"I'm not a lesbian relax.\" She rubbed her temples; this conversation was making her already big headache even more unbearable. \"You mean your not?\" Maverick sounded almost upset. \"No… I'm not. Why do you ask?\" She didn't care to know but put on a very unconvincing polite voice, asking him why he bothered with this line of questioning. She was eager to stop the work and fall in to bed. \"Then… why? Why did you dump me?\" His voice had become barely audible, as a whisper. \"Pete…\" \"Was I inadequate… in bed?\" He sounded choked up as if desperately in need of something. \"It wasn't working Maverick. I told you this… Your heart wasn't in it. I wasn't going to waste any more of my love life on a cactus.\" She was really ready to hang up and hoped he got that she was frustrated enough to add a cactus into the conversation in a stylish-sounding attempt to end this. \"What?\" It seemed he wasn't following; or maybe he was, all too well, and it was finally starting to sink in, even if he didn't want to believe in what he was hearing himself. \"I just told you; you weren't in love with me.\" She tugged on her cardigan sleeve, as if plucking up the courage to just tell Maverick the true reason behind the mysterious break-up. \"But-\" \"No… Pete don't you get it? I'm not gay; you are!\" She hung up. It was no good; he had to talk to Iceman. Every option had ran dry and he was feeling uneasy about somehow these facts had slipped him. ' Am I really that naïve ?' \"Ice I think we should talk.\" He said awkwardly catching him in the locker room in the morning; it was freshly empty and he figured Ice would be avoiding him and he'd guessed right. Ice never turned from the sink where he was washing his hands. \"So talk.\" He said, splashing his face and then grabbing a handful of paper towels, he left the locker room abruptly, with Maverick trying to keep on his heels. \"You didn't have to walk out on me last night… I mean what the hell?\" Maverick hadn't rehearsed this conversation at all and his only plan was to eventually apologize but Ice's attitude jus pissed him off and he couldn't resist giving him a piece of his mind. \"So I was a little late!\" \"You weren't a little late Maverick.\" He drawled, fishing out his office keys and twirling them skillfully on his finger by the key ring. \"Try a lot late.\" He fit the key in the lock and quickly unlocked the office door. \"Fuck you.\" Maverick gripped the door handle, stopping Ice from opening it. Ice was glaring at him. And Maverick glared right back. \"This conversation is over.\" He stared cold into Mavericks Ice until Maverick felt unnerved enough to take his sweaty hand off of the door handle and stuffed his hands in to his pockets sheepishly looking at the floor. He didn't move until he heard Ice slam the door in his face. He turned to walk down the hallway, feeling defeated, but he was quickly filled with another reaction, seeing a familiar face heading down the same hallway towards him, a sly smirk on his face; It was Slider. Maverick couldn't help but stare, he looked good, no—hot Maverick thought; suited and stylish, Mav's eyes were wide after spotting his former antagonist. Slider simply cupped Mavericks cheek and kissed him on the other cheek before smacking his ass and rounding him to get to Ices door. \"Still tight Mav? Is he in?\" \"Slider? Um…\" Mavericks face was flushed and Slider didn't give him the time to respond before walking straight in to the office, closing the door behind him. ' Damn… they're cropping up everywhere' . Maverick shook his head and laughed to himself. Maverick found some peace in his office after class, flopping boneless in his big leather chair, slumped shoulders and rolling a fresh can of soda over his forehead and neck. Fury was giving Spider crap about his impulsive ways, and it sounded so badly familiar his head was starting to spin. He was thinking about the past; something Maverick swore he'd never do. He remembered Ice, consoling him after Gooses death, or rather, his attempt to console, but he chickened out and left Maverick in the locker room to suffer in silence. He hadn't thought about that for so long. Ice had walked in knowing he was alone and seemed to be lost for words, frosty façade falling, Ice seemed sorry for Maverick, and other than Jester, was the only person who cared enough for Maverick to approach him in person. He seemed to have so much more to say but only managed to stutter out his empathy. He also sniffed, he seemed to be holding in tears, looking at the ceiling, he didn't want to look at Maverick, and despite he was facing his back, still he was struggling. Maverick sighed heavily, racing for his wallet; he stroked a photograph of himself and Goose, one that he'd held on to for all these years. \"What should I do Goose?\" He whispered. The door abruptly opened, snapping Maverick out of his melancholy. It was Jester. \"Maverick.\" \"Sir.\" Maverick straightened up and shoved the picture back in to his wallet. He got up and walked around the desk. \"I just thought I'd let you know; I'm leaving today.\" Maverick nodded, sober-featured and clasped Jesters' shoulder. \"It's been an honor sir.\" \"Don't get all sissy on me Commander, there's a leaving party later. But I thought I owed it to you to talk to you in person.\" He led Maverick to sit, and he sat next to him. \"What about?\" Maverick looked at him, his brow furrowing. \"I think you know.\" Jester looked sternly at him, Maverick felt hot at the back of his neck, he didn't have to say it, he knew somehow what had been troubling Maverick since Ice left. \"Watch yourself. He's your superior… It'd be bad for all involved if something went bad. I'm just saying.\" \"Sir…\" Maverick cleared his throat. \"I'm not sure what you're implying.\" \"Son, I now your not that stupid—and god help me I don't care about your personal life; But just let me say one thing, and then I'll say no more about it.\" They had at some point lost each other's eyes. Maverick knew what he was about to say but Jester just couldn't let it lie. \"Okay.\" Maverick gulped, he hadn't wanted any of this to come out so fast, but Jester wasn't stupid either, and probably knew before he even did. \"Don't get your heart-broken… You're a son to me, and I don't want to see you get hurt.\" Their eyes finally met and Maverick nodded, his eyes tearing up, he didn't know what was wrong but he couldn't help it. Jester offered a small smile and reached a thumb to wipe away Mavericks stray tear. \"He'd be proud of you—your father, I know he would. And so am I. And wherever he is, I'm sure him and Goose'll be looking down on you and watching over you.\" And that did it, Maverick broke down and wept, and somehow Jester had softened enough to hold him in a tight embrace, feeling Maverick shudder as he helplessly cried into his arms. Everyone was there for Jesters' farewell party; old students and colleagues, family and friends, it was unbelievable and overwhelming. But despite the sad occasion, the party had a positive air about it, laughing and reminiscing, hugging and hand shaking. Maverick met much of the old Topgun gang; all except Goose, he couldn't help but notice. Others seemed to notice this too. Iceman had tried his best to keep his distance from Maverick; the awkwardness was still heavy around them like thick clouds as the fighter jet gained height. But then their eyes, met, slowly, from across the busy room, and the clouds began to clear. Ice couldn't help himself; he missed Maverick like crazy and hated hating him for such a selfish reason. This time Ice was the one to break the ice. He crossed the room so fast as he could have passed as a blur, Maverick needed him and they needed each other. They weren't out of sight from the rest of the room but the didn't care, they couldn't hold back any longer, couldn't hold on. Ice stopped, taking the wine glass Maverick had in his hand and set it on the table next to them, and their eyes never left each other's'. And Maverick just melted into his arms as they wrapped warmly around his waist and pulled their bodies close and neatly against each other. \"I'm sorry.\" Ice whispered in to Maverick's ear, swaying them together as they stood. Maverick reciprocated and hooked his arms loosely over Ice's shoulders, and rested his head on his shoulder. They stayed like that for a few moments, they had a hard time breaking apart, and years of miserable loneliness and denial that had taken them both had finally evaporated in their warm embrace. But they did so, slowly, still holding on to each others' forearms like they were unable to break apart. Maverick smiled, wide and bright, and reached over to the table, taking two wine glasses and handing one to Ice, who happily accepted it sipping, never letting his eyes leave Mavericks. \"It's okay. We'll make up for it.\" Maverick said, quietly, their words only for their own ears. \"Should I even ask?\" Ice rolled his eyes, but he had a happy smile covering his face that just didn't seem to ever move. \"Tomorrow night? Twenty Hundred. My place.\" Maverick said. Iceman couldn't help but blush softly. He nodded shortly to Maverick, and took a last swallow of wine before planting the empty glass on the table. They didn't need to say another word, Ice left satisfied to return to the party and mingle with a group of suck-ups. And Maverick felt so damn accomplished and proud of himself, they evening sped on and Jesters farewell ended up being one of the happiest nights of his life. The next day started business as usual, which was unusual since Maverick felt like a new man, and Topgun wasn't left untouched from the changes. It seemed a few guys stayed behind after the party; Maverick walked in the lounge to find Hollywood on the couch rubbing the sleeping Wolfman's socked feet in his lap, Slider was on the chair next to them. \"Oh come on man…\" Slider began, sipping coffee. \"No, really, most of the party saw them, how could you not?\" Hollywood's hair was mussed and he looked like they'd been up talking all night. Slider sighed, standing and getting to the vending machine inserting a few coins. \"Apparently they were in a fight or something—and made up and shit, all repressed homo-ness came out…\" Hollywood was speaking but his eyes were closed and Slider kicked the vending machine a couple of times before it finally gave him a packet of chips. \"Shit—wish I saw that.\" Slider slumped back in his chair and saw Maverick standing in the doorway. \"Hey boss.\" He waved a little sheepishly, signaling Hollywood to turn, and upon seeing Maverick standing there, jolted in surprise, standing up and knocking Wolfman's feet out of his lap and stirring him awake, as he embarrassedly shuffled over to the television to pickup the remote and turn it on. \"Mmph… why'd ya stop?\" Wolfman muttered into the cowboy hat, which was sat on top of his face, but quickly seemed to fall back asleep as he shifted about. \"Morning.\" Maverick looked at them, not really caring about them talking about him and pretended he never heard anything, going over to the vending machine to get his morning snack. Hollywood had a scowl on his face as he flicked through the channels. He was apparently grumpy in the morning judging by how roughly he pressed the buttons. \"Morning lover boy.\" Slider chuckled, bringing his knees up to his chest in the chair trying to keep warm. Maverick shook his head and gave Slider the finger before sitting down in Hollywood's place by Wolfman's feet. Maverick sipped the coke he just purchased and winced at its coldness. \"What are you doing here Slider?\" Maverick asked, not intending it harshly, but as more of a conversation starter. \"Didn't Iceman tell you? —He hired me on.\" Maverick tried not to react at this news. \"Apparently he couldn't fly here without me at his back. Can't blame him really.\" Maverick gritted his teeth, he liked Slider, but he wasn't sure if having him that close to Iceman was going to impede on his new 'friendship'. \"You're an asshole Slider.\" Wolfman mumbled, earning a laugh from both Maverick and Hollywood. Slider tried to take it personally, them taking sides, but let his head flop back and laugh out loud. \"Well…\" Maverick started cheerfully. \"I've got a job to do.\" He didn't need to check his watch, he was already running late, and downed his coke like he was suffering from dehydration, crushed it and threw it to the bin in one. He winked at the guys and then made to leave, closing the door behind him. \"Nice shot.\" Slider scoffed and Hollywood sat back down where Maverick had just left- taking Wolfman's feet in his hands again. They were all pretty tired and had little attention to early-morning news. Slider looked from the door, to Hollywood, and then back, over to Hollywood. \"We should have a threesome.\" Slider stated, munching chips. Hollywood looked at him, raising his eyebrow. And Wolfman lifted the hat from his face and craned his neck in joining Hollywood's shared expression. Maverick was eagerly and nervously waiting for the night to come around when Iceman had agreed to a low-key date at his home. He was terrified, but knew this was what he wanted. He couldn't help but laugh, 'Charlie was right', he thought of little else but Ice for the rest of the day, and how he was going to go about making the night special. He luckily only ran in to Ice once during the day, when he was addressing the class, Ice had given his shoulder a squeeze before leaving and he was fast falling for Iceman without even being fully sure of his own sexuality. He had no idea what they would do the day after; he just figured taking it one day at a time was the best way to approach it. \"Welcome to casa de Maverick.\" Maverick said nervously as he answered the door in his jeans and black t-shirt. Ice just raised his brow, wearing a white button-down shirt and dark jeans and his hair was gelled. Maverick couldn't get over how good he looked. \"Douche.\" He smiled and gently pushed Maverick inside with his palm on his chest. Maverick gulped and let him. \"Sorry I'm a little late.\" He grinned and pushed Maverick down on to the couch and fell on top of him, his warm hands sliding up his shirt and softly caressing his toned body. Maverick hadn't the time to gasp, feeling Ice's soft lips press upon his own, he couldn't have predicted this would happen this fast, but Maverick couldn't just push him away, so he gently held Ice by his elbows, and tried to ease him up. The kiss was warm and sweet, no tongues, just a slow, long press and their lips fit together perfectly, the curve of his lower lip matching with Ice's. Their first kiss, it was as soft as he'd imagined, but combined with a sense of urgency as Ice ground his hips down against Maverick, earning him to gasp in surprise, and the blond man took this opportunity to breath, and stare down at him, grinning proudly. \"You have no idea how long I've wanted this—wanted you.\" \"Wait—um—Ice. \" As Ice fell into him for another kiss, Maverick managed to cut him off, holding his face in his hands, he just wanted to stare in to his eyes. And he wasn't disappointed, the beauty of his expression would stay with him a lifetime. Ice waited patiently, drawing each breath slowly, savoring the feeling of being so close to the man he'd wanted half of his life. \"Tom…\" he whispered, unable to resist any longer, and drew his face together, unable to stop to beautiful, loving kiss they engaged in, it wasn't rushed or needy, and it was perfect. They had silently agreed not to rush things any more after getting that out of their system and ended up sat on the grass in the backyard by ten o'clock, just starting at the stars. \"Hey Ice?\" Maverick broke the comfortable silence. \"Mm?\" Ice opened one eye to look at Maverick, who had leaned slightly against him. It felt nice and Ice wondered how it took them this long to explore their feelings for one another or why he'd been so vague earlier. \"What have you been doing all these years?\" Maverick said quietly, playing with the light hair dusting Iceman's arm. Ice looked at him, a very mild feeling of annoyance came over him; he wasn't big on personal questions, especially after such a lovely evening, but he couldn't be mad at Maverick. \"You read my file didn't you?\" Maverick shook his head, Ice opened both eyes and raised his head. \"Really?\" \"I wanted to hear it from you.\" He whispered shyly, leaning close and kissing his shoulder lightly, shyly. \"God.\" Ice sat fully up and pulled Maverick in to his lap and laid back, taking him with him, so he was nestled against his chest. \"I saw combat. Middle East. It was Hell, some guys couldn't cope, Slider… well, Slider requested to be transferred after a couple of years, I stayed and almost got shot down last year—it scared the hell out of me. Until I finally decided on a change of scenery.\" \"So you requested Topgun?\" Maverick asked, nuzzling his neck. \"Not at first, no. I tried to go in to crop-dusting and shit like that.\" \"Really?\" Maverick stared wide-eyed at him. \"I bet that was exciting.\" \"Hell no, It sucked, then Slider mentioned he was paying visits to Topgun and said you were still here and I was like 'Shit—really?' I was stunned. I really thought you'd be long gone. And he said something about you and Blackwood calling it quits, and I thought why not.\" Ice was quiet for a long time, as was Maverick as they just stared contentedly at each other. He couldn't believe Ice made such a drastic choice just to see him again, Maverick decided he wasn't going to question him in that line any further. \"And no—before you ask, I never found anybody. I was kind of too busy for romance and shit.\" He shrugged. \"I wasn't going to ask.\" He chuckled and kissed Ice, softly on the mouth, and Ice sighed happily. All the evidence was coming to a head to Maverick, and he realized Iceman was madly In love with him—had been, always. He couldn't believe he never realized before how much he cared for him either. He was almost crying, but wouldn't let Ice see him do that and changed the subject. \"Hey, what do you think about 'Wood and Wolf?\" \"Well…\" Ice breathed a chuckle and stroked Mavericks hair softly. \"I haven't asked either of them out.\" Maverick patted his chest. \"No. No… I was wondering what's up with them.\" \"Hollywood is crazy about Wolf.\" Maverick had to laugh. \"How'd you know?\" Maverick curled his arm around Ice's waist and Ice pulled his arms around him. \"When you've spent so long pining after another man for so long, it tends to be a trait easily spotted it others.\" Maverick sat up, looking down at Ice; his findings had proved true. \"Plus he talks a lot when he's drunk.\" He had caught Mavericks eyes. And smiled warmly. \"What?\" Ice was surprised to find Maverick sitting on his chest and his pulling off his t-shirt. Iceman bit his lower lip, looking at him with a confused, but definitely receptive eyes. \"How long have you been in love with me?\" He asked, confidence returning to his voice. Ice gasped, he was lost for words, put on the spot like this he wasn't quite sure of what the right thing to say was. \"Pssh, ego much Maverick?\" He laughed, but it was shaky. \"How long ?\" Maverick pleaded for an answer, laying against him, his face buried in his neck delivering hot kisses as his fingers worked Ice's shirt buttons open. Ice could barely breath, feeling Mavericks mouth slide down his chest, placing hot open-mouthed kissed down his chest and stomach. But Ice needed to speak the answer equally as bad as Maverick wanted to hear it; he sat up and gripped Mavericks face in his hands, pulling them so close together that their foreheads were pressed against each other. His eyes burned into Mavericks, their breathing heavy and hot and Ice spoke, clearly and intimately with more meaning as he'd ever said anything before in his life; \"Since I first laid eyes on you.\" And with that, Maverick's heart felt so full and gratified for the first time, cutting away the loneliness he'd suffered for so long, Mavericks eyes watered and he whimpered and pulled Ice hard against his chest. \"I love you Pete Mitchell...\" Ice whispered, sucking his throat tenderly. Maverick was in tears and fell back against the grass, as Ice worked the belt off of Maverick, tossing it away as if it were a snake and doing the same with his. \"I always have.\" Neither man had no reason to wait any longer, they wanted this so badly and were going to get it if it was the last thing they did. Maverick couldn't say he loved Iceman, not yet anyway, he wished he could, but he didn't know how, not fully, but he was fairly certain that this is what it felt like. He knew the word love, and was ready for every thrill it would give him. And that night he let Ice show him. On the mighty wings of love they soared like the steel angels they flew. And Ice was his guiding hand. -END- Short- \"A New Day.\" As the early morning light shined across the sky, all was quiet at Topgun. Maverick was riding down the empty roads, wind blowing through his hair. Ice was close behind in his shining black Mazda sports car. They raced on, playing games, overtaking and inter-cutting. Maverick lived to shine, always taking the lead, and as they met in the parking lot on the Topgun Academy base, they squinted through their aviators, watching as the sun came up behind them. \"Boy that's beautiful.\" \"Pussy.\" Ice scoffed, but flashed a knowing smile at Maverick as they leaned against the railings, shoulder-to-shoulder. It was beautiful, even if he wouldn't admit it out loud. They wordlessly watched, together as the blazing god of the sky took up it's place to start the new day. Ice felt warm tears prick behind his eyes as Maverick took his hand in his discreetly and lovingly stroked it. \"We should get inside.\" Ice whispered, pulling away, only grateful Maverick couldn't see the tears behind his shades, he cupped Maverick's cheek and they gazed in to each other's eyes. Just before they parted to start the new day, Maverick leaned in and kissed him, the sun silhouetting their love in shadow at their feet. And that was all they needed to say to each other all the things they wanted to. And as they walked side-by-side into the building, they made no secret of their presence, letting doors slam and their shoes tapping loudly. \"Oh, shit! Wolf, wake up…\" Hollywood jolted awake, sliding his jeans up while still romantically entwined with his fellow pilot Wolfman on the floor of the lounge. It was just unfortunate that Wolfman was a heavy sleeper. \"Hey—whoa…\" Maverick stopped in his tracks, and so did Ice bumping in to him. \"Figures.\" Ice drawled. And they looked on highly amused; flustered shirtless Hollywood who had just covered Wolfman's decency with his trademark cowboy hat. He just waved sheepishly. Ice was shamelessly admiring the spectacle before them and just as Maverick burst out laughing, a naked Slider appeared standing behind the couch. \"Slider!?\" Ice rolled his eyes. \"I'm out of here, see you later.\" He didn't see much point in hiding it any longer, and brought Maverick in to him for a very possessive kiss in front of the three naked pilots before grabbing his ass. \"This is mine.\" He winked, leaving Maverick to deal with the unexpected situation.

Due to the fact that Corsairs were single-seaters, I've turned Goose and Slider into pilots themselves, helping to expand the squadron. For the time, they are island-based rather than carrier, but this doesn't mean that I won't be writing about that in the future. As always, I claim none of these characters as my own nor am I making a profit from this in any way. It's merely a way to explore new ideas and get me writing about aviation again. \"Maverick!\" shouted Ice. \"Our planes are this way, or have you forgotten already?\" Inhaling deeply, Maverick kept his temper even as he turned his head and flashed Ice an infuriating smile. \"I'm taking the scenic route.\" \"Maverick, we have our planes to cover!\" Ice growled and he took a few steps towards him. \"It can wait five or thirty minutes,\" replied Maverick evenly as he retreated, still smirking at his comrade. \"No it can't! Viper expects this to be done now!\" \"Yeah well, isn't that what the ground crew is for?\" \"He wants us to do it!\" Maverick just smirked. \"It'll only take a minute.\" \"That's what you said the last time and look what happened then!\" A wide grin spread over Maverick's lips as he put his sunglasses on. \"Yeah, it was a great time, wasn't it?\" Ice narrowed his eyes and advanced on Maverick, who remained as firm to his spot as the palm trees that stood guard over their barracks. Ice dropped his voice and glowered at him. \"Get your ass over to the Corsairs, now !\" The anger in Ice's voice amused Maverick as there was little he enjoyed more than pestering his rival. Ice's remarkably sweaty face flushed with fury and the flare in his eyes should have warned Maverick of the rising danger in the coiling of this rattlesnake, but he was far too busy thoroughly enjoying this moment to pay much heed to it; nor could he see the telling signs of another misfortune about to befall the pair of them. Maverick simply smirked and said, \"It seems to me we're both wasting time. I could go and deliver this very important message while you, you could be covering the planes with camouflage.\" \"Deliver the message afterwards! The camouflage is important!\" \"You worry too much, you know that Kazansky? Perhaps you should come with me and get a drink.\" Ice gritted his teeth and hissed, \"Don't make me force you, Maverick.\" Maverick quirked a brow and leaned into Ice's scowl. \"Now that's something neither of us want. Remember what Viper said? No more fights otherwise it's both our asses in the brig for a long time!\" \"Then I suggest you get to your damn plane and cover it up!\" \"I will!\" exclaimed Maverick, causing Ice to jerk suddenly, but a small, triumphant smile crossed his lips immediately afterwards. Maverick grinned and said, \"After I get back. I promise it'll only be a minute, or four ...\" And before Ice could object any further, Maverick turned on his heels and hastened away. \"Maverick! Goddamnit, Maverick!\" Ice shouted, but it was no use. \"Hey, Ice! How about these planes?\" called one of the pilots. Shaking his head, Ice knew that unless he was willing to get yelled at by Viper for not getting the planes covered, he had to let Maverick go. He could only hope that Maverick's dedication to insubordination wouldn't get him into trouble as well. No. That would never fly. Ice groaned inwardly as he walked towards the Corsairs, knowing full and well that when Viper was away, he was in charge and that meant that whatever Maverick didn't do, or especially what he did do, Ice was ultimately responsible for it. He was screwed no matter what. Ice staggered and swayed, then caught himself with his right foot and glanced at Goose and Slider, who were busy finishing the first Corsair. To his left, two other pilots were securing the poles while another two pilots helped drag the netting over. At least he'd have the camouflage taken care of and that meant one less thing for Viper to be upset about should he return to find Maverick missing again. It was also a weight off of Ice's mind, knowing that the netting would help turn these blue blots into normal island foliage to any aerial predator that might be stalking them from high above. Barely a week ago just south of them and far closer to the action than them, an island base had been attacked by Japanese fighters. The planes had been their first target and with them sitting in the open like that, it hadn't taken much effort to destroy a majority of them. In the midst of the annihilation of the aircraft, one Zero had strafed the barracks, effectively killing a good number of men and putting dozens more into the hospital. The base had nearly lost all because their airplanes hadn't been covered and their security had gone lax. Ice didn't want to share that fate. Shivering, Ice pulled his mind from his thoughts and set about helping the pilots with the netting, barking out commands as though he was a drill instructor. The pilots gave him loathing scowls but did as they were told. Ice was notoriously bossy, but a solid leader; someone that they could trust. At any rate, the sooner they got their work finished the sooner they could get out of the infernal heat! They worked in an orderly procession, moving from one plane to the next until at last, they were on Ice's plane. In no time they had finished and the pilots were only too happy to leave Ice's presence. Only Goose lingered behind, watching as Ice circled his plane, running his hand over the fuselage and making sure that every compartment hatch was still secure. \"Anything else, Commander ?\" Goose teased with a playful smirk. Ice looked over at him and frowned. Damn this infernal headache! In a soft voice he replied, \"No. Just, just make sure Maverick isn't going to land us in trouble again, okay?\" Goose gave a knowing nod, then moved on his way. He was good like that; loyal to Maverick but still loyal to the squadron. Goose was always an amiable fellow and Ice was glad that they had at least one comedian in the bunch. How someone as intelligent, insightful, and witty could be friends with that incorrigible Maverick was beyond Ice's understanding. Then again, Ice mused as he continued his inspection of his Corsair, perhaps witty and intelligent kept incorrigible from causing death to them all. To hell with it. Ice rolled his eyes to the netting above his head and felt the sun beating against his exhausted body. Maybe if Maverick got into enough trouble he'd be transferred out of the squadron once and for all. An hour later, Goose spied Maverick taking a long drink from his canteen and he grabbed Maverick by the arm, catching him just before he stepped into the barracks. \"Oh, I don't think that's a good idea!\" exclaimed Goose quietly as he steered Maverick around a palm tree and hurried him towards the Corsairs. \"Why, what are you... Goose! What's going on?\" \"What's going on? You've been gone an hour and Viper is looking to roll your head if you're not with Iceman!\" \"Wait, why should I be with him?\" \"Because that's where I said you were!\" replied Goose with a touch of anger in his voice. \"It was the only thing I could think of at the time!\" Maverick beamed at him and clapped him on the shoulder. \"Good thinking!\" \"It wasn't for you,\" snapped Goose. \"Now find Ice and tell him that Viper is looking for him!\" \"Where is Ice?\" asked Maverick, not bothering to hide the hurt he felt at being scolded by his best friend. \"Probably still inspecting our planes with the mechanic or something. It's the last place I saw him but you had better find him before Viper finds you otherwise, we're all in it.\" Maverick frowned at him and replied quietly, \"I'm sorry, Goose.\" A small smile appeared on Goose's lips and he shook his head. \"I can't stay mad at you, man. Just, don't ruin our weekend because you wanted a date! Find him!\" Maverick smirked and took off towards the Corsairs. One by one he went looking for Ice but didn't seem him. Sweat ran down Maverick's neck when he saw Viper exiting the barracks. He ducked under the radial engine and crawled underneath the wing, reappearing at the trailing edge. He kept his eyes on Viper and saw that he was heading straight towards the Corsairs. Maverick sighed, but he refused to resign himself to his fate just yet. But as he pushed himself up, he was startled to find someone laying on the gull wing. \"Ice?\" Maverick questioned incredulously as he peered at him. He couldn't help the chuckle that escaped him and he said, \"Sleeping while on duty? You know, Viper is going to love this!\" Ice was tucked against the side of the fuselage with his head facing the engine. His eyes were shut and he was very, very still. The right arm was curled against Ice's body with the palm flat against the wing as though he had been trying to push himself up only to fail. Something wasn't right. Ice would never chance a nap in the middle of duty hours; especially when he was the one that Viper relied on to keep their squadron organized when he wasn't there. Something was horribly, horribly wrong. \"Ice, Iceman, wake up!\" Maverick shouted as he scrambled onto the wing. He took hold of Ice's hand and felt for a pulse. The result startled Maverick and as his worry mounted, he placed his palm against Ice's brow; cool and moist. Looking into Ice's face, Maverick yelled, \"Ice! Come on, Ice! Wake up!\" Ice groaned weakly, \"Stop shouting, Mitchell! I'm not deaf!\" Maverick dropped his head and sighed in relief. \"For a moment there, Kazansky...\" Then he glared at Ice and helped him to sit up on the wing with his back against the fuselage. \"You, you are an idiot, Ice!\" \"Me?\" Ice shook his head, immediately wincing and nearly falling on his side. \"You're the one always screwing up! Just... just look at how long you've been gone!\" \"I was about to ask how long you've been out!\" Maverick unfastened his canteen and pressed it against Ice's lips. \"Drink this! And don't worry, it's just water! I can't believe you! Of all the dumb things for you to ignore!\" Through his slight shivering, Ice glared defiantly at Maverick, daring him to continue hurling insults his way, but Maverick knew that this was not the time or the place for it. Sighing in exasperation, Maverick unfastened the top buttons on Ice's uniform blouse, recieving a prompt shove from Ice. \"What are you doing?\" Ice demanded. \"Saving your life,\" replied Maverick coolly as he moved to Ice's feet and took off his boots. \"Seems like someone got a bit too much sun today. By the way, Viper's looking for the both of us.\" Ice glanced at his watch and a look of horror came to his face. He shut his eyes and let the back of his head hit the plane. \"Look, don't worry about that right now,\" said Maverick, suddenly feeling a sense of pity for what Ice had to be going through. Maverick had sorely wanted to be Viper's second in command, but the honor had fallen on Ice's broad shoulders on account that the men were more willing to follow Ice into battle than him and when it came to military protocol, Ice was always the best. Ice had taken the responsibility with great pride, too much it seemed, for despite Ice's perfection in everything, he had overlooked one tiny detail that could cost him his life. But that would not be today, Maverick was damn sure about that. \"I'm going to get you help.\" Sliding off the wing, Maverick went around to the front of the aircraft where he was surprised to find Goose standing right there, looking in confusion at him. \"Where's Iceman?\" \"He needs help.\" Goose groaned. \"Don't tell me you punched him again!\" \"No, no, not my fault this time! He's sick. It's that heat stress, but I can't be sure if it's worse than that.\" \"What?\" Goose's startled exclamation carried over to Viper, who looked their way. \"What's going on?\" demanded Viper as he quickly crossed over to them. \"It's Ice. He's not doing so well,\" was all Maverick could say as led the two back around the Corsair. As soon as Viper saw Iceman, who had fallen on his side again, he was up on the wing beside him. After a few moments of checking Ice's vitals, Viper looked back at Maverick and Goose. \"He needs to get to the hospital immediately. Goose, you go get the jeep. Maverick, you stay with Iceman.\" \"Yes, Sir,\" both Maverick and Goose replied. As Goose went to fetch the jeep and Viper departed briefly, Maverick rocked uneasily from one foot to the other and looked back at Ice. Before Viper had left, Ice had said something to him that was completely inaudible and in response, Viper merely squeezed his shoulder gently. Maverick felt the same touch of pity from earlier and frowned in sympathy at him. Their eyes locked and for once, Maverick could see the pain in his eyes. Had it been there before and he had just failed to notice it? For Ice to be in this poor of a state meant that it had to have been going on for some time. Maverick felt his spirit sink. Maybe this was his fault. Maybe if he hadn't been goading Ice and had instead paid attention to him he could have seen the symptoms earlier. Maverick blinked, then saw a familiar anger returning to Ice's eyes. So Ice did blame him for this. Maverick ran a hand through his own damp hair, trying to think of something to say to him. No apology seemed fit for this though and in despair, he climbed onto the wing and helped Ice into a sitting position again and held the canteen for him to drink. Ice didn't refuse the help and drank steadily. They sat in silence and when the jeep arrived, not a word passed between them. He wasn't needed after that point and so Maverick went back to the barracks, suddenly feeling less enthusiastic about the night than he had been earlier. Two hours later, dismissed and beckoned to the officer's club by some of the pilots so he could impress the nurses with his tale of heroics, Maverick found that the only thing he wanted was peace. But there was no chance in getting that while he felt the weight of Ice's illness on his shoulders. Turning away from the club, Maverick ventured over to the one-story hospital where he was taken over to see his comrade. It didn't surprise him any to find Ice with his eyes closed and so he sat on the edge of the cot and patiently waited. \"Mitchell?\" came Ice's confused voice sometime later and Maverick blinked awake. Ice tilted his head at him. \"What are you doing here?\" \"I wanted to see how you were doing.\" \"Too much sun and not enough hydration,\" replied Ice stiffly, tiredly. \"They want to keep me here overnight and see how I look and feel in the morning.\" \"I'm sure you'll be up to your cranky, old self as soon as you wake up,\" said Maverick with a half-hearted smile. Ice returned it with a wry grin of his own. \"Is that why you came here? To piss me off some more?\" Maverick chuckled but said nothing and simply bowed his head. Apologizing to his rival would not be easy, but then again, apologizing in general was never an easy task. \"Look, Mitchell, I never thanked you for what you did back there,\" said Ice quietly. Maverick looked up, surprised. \"I, I don't know how long it would have taken someone to find me there. And even if I was found, I don't know how many people would have seen anything but a napping pilot. Thank you for actually checking on me.\" Maverick's smile faltered. \"I should have noticed earlier.\" \"It's not your fault; it's mine.\" \"You? Admitting fault?\" Maverick grinned outright. \"Now that is a surprise!\" Ice rolled his eyes upwards and said, \"Yeah, a bit more common than yours though. At least I can admit my mistakes, though they are so few and far in between.\" Maverick shook his head in annoyance at the arrogance, but he was grinning all the same. \"Just as I said, Iceman, you'll be back to your cranky, self-righteous self in no time.\" He placed his hand on Ice's shoulder and gave it a squeeze. \"I'm glad that you're going to be okay. Rest easy now.\" ","Summary":" Author's Note: This is a World War Two alternate universe for \"Top Gun\" where I've taken the main"},{"Movie":"Top Gun","Title":"Maverick's Down","Author":"Cielag","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9207814","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Author's Notes: This is a World War Two alternate universe for \"Top Gun\" where I've taken the main characters, Maverick, Iceman, Viper, Goose, and Slider and put them in the South Pacific.

As always, I claim none of these characters as my own nor am I making a profit from this in any way. \"Maverick! Maverick!\" Ice shouted as he leapt over one of the many broken trees and plowed through a tropical fern that had, up until this point, remained upright. Just up ahead lay the mangled remains of a once proud F4U Corsair. Its left wing had been torn off completely by the numerous trees that blanketed the island while only half of the right wing lay intact. Undoubtedly the shearing of the left wing had spun the Corsair to the left, smacking it hard against two firm trees that refused to give way. The only remnants of the tail section was a butchered horizontal stabilizer. No wonder Maverick had come down like a rock and without the altitude, there was no way that he could have ejected from the cockpit, but as Ice recalled with a sickening lurch in his stomach, Maverick had been wounded. \"Maverick!\" Ice again shouted as he climbed onto the remaining gull wing. The scent of petrol burned his nose and he coughed. He had to get Maverick out of that aircraft because with all the fuel still leaking onto the ground, it was hard to say whether or not it would find a spark to ignite it. The engine appeared dead, but as Ice knew from stories he had heard, this could be a fatal miscalculation. Time was of the essence. Pulling at the cracked birdcage canopy, Ice tried to ignore how Maverick was in the seat, hunched over to the left and very, very still, and the moment he pushed the canopy back, Ice could see the blood on the controls and his stomach turned cold. He carefully pulled himself closer to Maverick, calling out, \"Mitchell! Mitchell!\" But Maverick wouldn't respond. \"Don't you dare be dead!\" Ice growled as he gently eased Maverick against the seat, allowing Ice to see the extent of the head trauma. Ice felt his voice choke in his throat as he gazed at the blood that covered half of Maverick's face and then at his uniform, which had fared no better. \"Wake up, Mitchell! You managed to land! Now get up!\" Sighing in frustration, Ice removed Maverick's flight cap, then pressed his fingers against Maverick's neck. It had been a bad day for the squadron when they engaged the enemy Zeros and though they had triumphed and sent the enemy screaming for home, all of their Corsairs had suffered damage and had to return back to base as quickly as possible. Maverick's had been the worst and though Ice knew that he should have returned to base along with the others, something about Maverick's panic at losing full control of his plane had evoked a surge of compassion in Ice, who continued speaking to Maverick as he plummeted towards that deserted island. He had promised Maverick that he'd stay with him, that he'd talk to him. But then the radio went dead and Maverick's plane disappeared into the trees. \"God damnit, Mitchell, wake up!\" Ice clenched his fist and put his head down, completely furious with himself for not having gotten to him sooner, but a soft, cracked voice spoke weakly, \"My arm, I...\" Ice lifted his head and peered anxiously at him, watching as Maverick tried to move. \"My arm, it's, it's been shot off, hasn't it?\" Regarding the bloody, but still visibly intact arm, Ice replied firmly, \"No, you haven't lost it; but your plane, well that's a different story.\" Maverick groaned and for a moment Ice thought that he was going to lose him once more to unconsciousness and so he patted Maverick's cheek heartily. \"Hey man, don't go back to sleep on me. We've got to get you out of here. Come on, help me help you. Get your arm over my shoulder.\" Though it was obvious that this simple action caused Maverick a great deal of pain, Ice ignored it as he helped pull Maverick from the wrecked cockpit. He was glad when he heard the voices of the sailors from the PT boat, for he knew that if he had to try and get Maverick down all on his own, it was very likely that he would have caused further injury. As the sailors helped to bring Maverick against the wing, Maverick's pain increased dramatically, something he expressed with a sharp yelp and the clenching of his teeth. It was only Ice who saw the tears building in Maverick's eyes. Maverick was never the sort to ask for help and Ice never knew how to give proper encouragement. Perhaps it was in this knowledge that Ice's heart remained so abashed as he gazed into that sickly pale face that was still covered with blood. He should have been able to say something to comfort Maverick; something that would have eased Maverick's mind enough that it would have given him peace; but all Ice could muster was something short and uniformed. There had been so much fear in Maverick's eyes, so much panic and uncertainty, and all Ice had to encourage him with were futile, barren, and completely pointless words. Ice had trifled with Maverick's fears and now he risked losing him all together. The shock had swept over Maverick like a tidal wave the moment the medic began assessing the wounds. As Maverick babbled incessantly about his alleged lost arm, trying many times to get a good look at his bloodied arm but only succeeding in being pushed back against the litter, Ice sat quietly off to the side on the PT boat, trying not to look as horrified as he felt. There had been so much blood along Maverick's face, arm, and side that Ice couldn't even contemplate what to tell his frightened comrade. There had to have been something he could have consoled him with to reduce the trauma, for shock often killed those wounded in combat and with as weak of a pulse as Maverick had, Ice didn't rightly know if Maverick could have survived it. Perhaps his mind had been so ensnared with the despair he felt at the prospect of having only one arm that his spirit had given up. Ice felt his grief surge through his throat only to stop short at this tongue. He blinked rapidly to try and clear his thoughts and tried once more to speak, but found his voice silenced by his own self-doubt. It wasn't a secret that the two disliked each other to the point of pure loathing at times, but their rivalry never meant that Ice hated Maverick. But would Maverick have honestly listened to him? He never did before; why would he now? Ice clenched his fist and shut his eyes. The silence cut into his distressed heart, furthering his shame. \"Look, Mitchell...\" Ice shook his head from side to side, feeling both frustrated and grieved. \"About your arm, you haven't lost it. You were never going to lose it.\" His fist relaxed and Ice opened his eyes and gazed down at Maverick. \"You were shot, Mitchell, but it's not as bad as it looks.\" Ice looked up at the hull and swallowed hard. \"They were going to tell you that, Mitchell.\" Closing his eyes, Ice ran his fingers through his hair and sighed deeply, feeling the fear rising once more at the thought of losing Maverick to a misconception of a perceived ailment. \"Your arm, it's still there and after it heals, you'll be able to use it like normal. You won't lose it, Mitchell.\" Ice opened his eyes and gazed down at Maverick for a moment, allowing silence to fill the hull of the PT boat as they hurried across the choppy waters back towards their island base. Not being much of a fan of rough water, Ice took this time to smooth one of the blankets covering Maverick and he paused briefly as he looked once more into his lifeless face. He reached his hand out, hesitated, then set it down against Maverick's brow. There was still blood on Ice's hands from when he had helped bring Maverick aboard the PT boat and from when he had helped the medic. Ice shivered, but then swept Maverick's hair back several times. \"Don't you die, Pete,\" said Ice with a slow shake of his head. \"Don't you dare die on me.\" ","Summary":" Author's Notes: This is a World War Two alternate universe for \"Top Gun\" where I've taken the mai"},{"Movie":"Top Gun","Title":"Mighty Wings","Author":"DigitalWerewolf","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8832066","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Mighty Wings Fandom : Top Gun Summary : After an in-flight error, Maverick and Iceman's partnership is on the rocks.

This is a Fan Fiction for entertainment purposes only and should not be reproduced. Author's Notes : This is a standalone sequel to my other story Top Gun: Turbo Lover. Maverick and Iceman are in an already established relationship and this story focuses more on friendships and bonding than the last. \"Ice what the hell are you doing? Get out of there!\" \"Hang on!\" Ice was sounding unusually flustered. This situation was uncomfortably familiar; Iceman chasing down a target drone, with Maverick, his wingman, closing in from behind and urging Iceman to take the shot or get out of the way, because Maverick, living up to his call sign was more than ready to step in and take the shot instead and with it, the glory. Iceman wiped sweat from his brow, he didn't usually act like this, but this whole uncomfortable position brought back bad memories he could live without. He still woke up in cold sweat, the day Goose died. Maverick felt it worse than anyone, but he was determined to not let the same happen. He had no patience for Iceman's common yet, uncharacteristic seizing up under pressure. He pulled back, and flew over the top of Iceman and Slider. \"Err Mav? What are you doing?\" His unnamed RIO called to him, but Maverick couldn't hear for the blood rushing to his head. He angled the fighter and took the shot, right over the top of Iceman, whose reaction was perhaps a bit over the top, but he knew never to underreact when Maverick was involved; he pulled back hard, the fighter jet equivalent of slamming on the breaks, and let Maverick steal the kill. \"Maverick…\" Iceman growled into his collar, he should have expected this, but didn't factor in Mavericks greed for glory. He bit back on his anger so hard he bit in to his bottom lip. Slider however was much less reserved about his displeasure of Mavericks near-disastrous actions. Back on the tarmac, Slider practically ran over to Maverick and gave no warning before punching him in the face. And it was a hard hit too. No mercy and full of meaning behind it. Maverick, not being the type of guy to fall in to a retreat, he lunged forward, with every intention of defending his position. But unfortunately for Maverick, he was becoming predictable and was met with another angry punch, knocking him on to his backside on the tarmac next to his fighter. It was humiliating; not only had Maverick failed to accomplish something he'd been itching to do for years, and hit Slider; he also was met with defeat at his very hands. He was too ashamed to stand as he wiped blood from his nose with the sleeve of his flight suit. \"Maverick… you could have killed us you reckless son of a bitch.\" He spat, before being ushered away by Hollywood, who had ran up with Wolfman at his heels upon seeing the throw down. Wolfman stopped, had a look on his face, torn, like he was stuck between him helping Maverick and following Hollywood. He eventually shook his head in disdain, and reluctantly chose the latter. But what hurt Maverick more than the punch and the abandonment, was Iceman. He didn't even look in his direction, just walked passed him like he was a leper and walked so fast he overtook Wolfman, who tried to keep in step. That stung. He wasn't even sure what he did wrong; to him he was genuinely surprised that they expected him to not act. Goose died. It didn't mean he was going to change that much. But it had been two decades, and now an instructor at Topgun, he perhaps should have led a better example to the dozen students watching from the wings. And Iceman being the ever-consistent rule-follower, he probably saw Maverick's need for speed a childish and if not slightly nostalgic move. Maverick wanted to hit Slider back. He really did. He hated how he sucked up all the time like a leech on Iceman's ass, but despite his hothead attitude, he wasn't much of a fighter. And Iceman not so much as looking in his direction made Maverick seem to think that Iceman had chose Slider as his favorite, well and truly. Although their rivalry had fizzled out with time, Maverick was still Maverick and loved to be in the spotlight—surely Ice knew that? He hoped he understood and wasn't going to hold some kind of grudge for Maverick. That would have hurt too much. He didn't want anyone to hate him, he did what he did simply because he was Maverick, and if Iceman was going to hate him for being himself—The gutting pain would be too much to deal with. With his pride damaged, Maverick rubbed his stinging eyes and got off the tarmac and hid himself away in his office, slinking down back-corridors and waiting for places to empty to avoid anyone seeing that Slider had socked him one. He slumped down in the small leather couch in the corner that he'd brought from home to make him feel more comfortable with spending most of his time at Topgun. It had started to feel like a home away from home—he just wished he had some gin stowed away under his desk, then it would be better than home. Maverick had no woman or family—he didn't want them, his life was all about the skies and his job. He loved it, which is why he elected to stay on and teach at Topgun. He felt a secret rush of excitement upon hearing Iceman was coming back. That was a few months ago. That was a positive. However, coming and becoming his superior and bringing Slider with him were definitely not positives. Maverick felt like he had to be twice as much of a hothead just to keep up appearances. After a couple of hours passed and it got dark out, Maverick debated apologizing. The gravity of how he'd acted up in the air was starting to sink in, and Maverick was sinking deeper and deeper into self-depreciation. \"I'm sorry Goose.\" He whispered, looking at the photo he kept close to his heart. \"I—I didn't think… god, I'm so stupid.\" Maverick flopped back against the couch, cupping his face in his hands, letting out an exasperated sigh of realization. The next day at Topgun, a whole group of guys were in the locker room; undressing, showering, and redressing. It was usual loud chatter among the students, but the others were oddly quiet and they all had the same thing on their mind. \"Hey 'Wood…\" Wolfman drawled, clad in nothing but a wet towel around his hips and lay on his back as he always did across the bench behind Hollywood. Wolfman was quite a talker and probably the laziest man in the room, waiting until mostly everyone left before bothering getting dressed, he just laid there and let himself dry off rather than put the effort in. \"Hm-mm?\" Hollywood was no less of a procrastinator; stood, facing his locker, also towel-clad, and staring at himself in the small mirror he brought from home and stuck to the inside of his locker. He was combing his hair back, painfully slow. Gelling and re-combing with intricate care and attention to detail—every hair had it's place. This was a process that left him and Hollywood the last to leave the locker room, without fail. Hollywood had a toothbrush in his mouth and his response was somewhat muffled through the din, but he figured Wolfman would start speaking anyway, if he heard him or not. \"Do ya think they'll be okay?\" He asked quietly, turning his head slightly to set his eyes upon Hollywood's naked back. Wolfman was looking for reassurances, Hollywood knew, but he couldn't give him them He knew full well who his was asking about but he wasn't one to openly engage in discussions about gay rumors in the company of pilots. They were all friends though, and most of the men in the room were more inclined to prefer the company of men, they were pilots, after all. Hollywood and Wolfman, Iceman and Slider, all happened to be in their forties and confirmed bachelors. But no one ever said anything- it didn't need saying. Maverick was a bit of a wildcard in the group however, he dated Charlie for a while, but once the passion expired and Charlie moved on to bigger and brighter pastures in the nineties, he had remained single ever since. It was rumors of Maverick sleeping with Iceman that were the most recent rumors, and the gang pretty much stuck by the book in 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell, mostly because they didn't want to ruin anything, if indeed there was a something. Which is why they usually never discussed these kinds of issues—to protect their friends. \"Who?\" Hollywood played coy, still combing and staring. He wasn't really in to talking while he was having Hollywood time, but he knew Wolfman well enough to not turn and give him a scowl just yet. Wolfman seemed to hesitate in answering right away, and his fingers toyed with the brim of the towel on his hips. Hollywood seemed to notice this, and watched him through the mirror, rather than watching himself—he still combed of course. Wolfman looked apprehensive but grinned wide and reached over tugging at the other mans towel until he turned his head sufficiently enough to see Wolfman incline his head in the direction of Iceman, who was stood with Slider at the opposite side of the bench getting dressed. Hollywood shrugged and turned his attention back to the mirror. He didn't know, and didn't like to think about it too much to not get wrinkles. \"What about us?\" Wolfman whispered in a tone so quiet, Hollywood wasn't sure if he'd imagined it. He felt his stomach jump and he bit his lip out of sight to not let on that his peacock feathers had just been ruffled. Wolfman seemed to not notice that and rolled his eyes, deciding on a rewording. \"I mean—us, all of us. What'll happen if we all break apart 'cause of dumb lil Maverick?\" Wolfman clearly had a lot of questions and a few fears it seemed. Hollywood wanted nothing more than to ease his mind, but he couldn't, truthfully he hadn't thought about how Maverick and Iceman hating each other would affect him —which was the most important really. Hollywood was a little surprised really, he knew Wolfman valued friendship more than anything, but Hollywood couldn't resist messing with him. \"Oh my poor little Wolfman…\" He busied himself stuffing his things back away in his locker right before turning to face the other man. \"You care too much. Relax. It'll all work out. Trust me.\" Wolfman pulled a face but was used to Hollywood making fun of him and knew his heart was in the right place. Besides, he had too much on his mind. \"But do you think they'll be okay?\" He asked again, staring at the ceiling fans. \"Gee I don't know… maybe you should ask him.\" Hollywood responded stupidly. Unfortunately for Hollywood, Wolfman thought it might be a better idea than trying to get Hollywood to talk about it any longer. People were clearing out now, leaving only the four and a small group of guys hanging around the door, pretending to fight. Iceman and Slider were fully dressed and Iceman had just shut his locker. Wolfman figured it was now or never, he turned his head, which was resting on his hand, which he used as a headrest, and looked across at Iceman. Slider seemed to notice this and gave Wolfman a playful slap on his bare stomach, leaving a red mark. \"Quit staring or your eyes will pop out. What's your deal?\" Slider asked, derailing Wolfman from directly communicating with Iceman, who hadn't said a word since the incident the day before. Wolfman winced and rubbed at the stinging handprint on his belly. Hollywood ground his teeth and turned quite sharply to glare at Slider, hand on hip in a sassy fashion that quickly distracted Wolfman from saying anything. \"No, Slider… what's your deal?\" Both Slider and Wolfman gawked at Hollywood. They'd known him for years but never saw Hollywood act this defensive. Slider blinked and stuttered. Iceman didn't say anything—which was becoming a familiar trait of his. \"Excuse me?\" Slider asked, genuinely taken aback by Hollywood's butting in. Slider didn't want to get in to another fight, especially not with someone like Hollywood, who he knew was far more capable fighter than he was. Slider was a little hurt by Hollywood's tone, and chose to avoid ruffling him any further, scoffing and turning back to his locker to collect his things. Iceman shook his head at the whole situation and didn't get involved, swiftly and gracefully leaving the room behind the group, leaving the three men alone. Slider didn't like it, Hollywood was still glaring at him, and it unnerved him, he didn't know why Hollywood was acting like this—but he forced himself to break out of the situation and go off practically running after Iceman, who had not yet eluded his sights. \"Slider…\" Hollywood called after Slider as he crossed the awkwardly silent room to meet him, face-to-face, by the door. Wolfman closed his eyes and leaned his head back. He could feel another fight coming. However, Hollywood just slung his arm around Slider and tilted his head towards Wolfman. \"Don't touch. Got it?\" He whispered, only for his ears. Slider bit his tongue and nodded. He got it. Hollywood smiled and leaned in, kissing Slider behind the ear, who gulped, unnerved—he wasn't going to be touching Wolfman again… no matter how badly he wanted to. Hollywood watched until Slider was out of sight. Alone . Wolfman lifted his head, watching as Hollywood reappeared from behind the bench and return to his locker, resetting his hair. They were both still wearing towels, but since both men took their sweet time, no rush was happening. For a long time now, Hollywood had suspected Wolfman was brighter than he sounded, and it hadn't occurred to him until recently that Wolfman had involved himself in earlier events and somehow managed to get Maverick to stay on and not quit back in the eighties. And when Hollywood received a mysterious and cryptic message from Charlie, telling him to ' Tell Wolfman… thank-you .' And although the relationship between Maverick and Charlie hadn't worked out, Hollywood was very proud of him. For what? He wasn't sure. But the fact remained that Wolfman was the kind of person he would never loose as a friend. No one would. He was the lovable puppy type who was impossible to hate and managed to befriend everyone. He was everyone's best friend. And so Hollywood was so proud to have him hold himself so close to him. \"What was that all about?\" Wolfman asked, but quickly lost interest in the business at hand when he saw Hollywood drop his towel, facing him. He used the towel to rub down his freshly shaven jawline, while Wolfman gulped audibly, and shifted uncomfortably on the bench. Hollywood wasn't an innocent party, but he acted pretty oblivious as he turned, and slowly, very slowly slid up his tight jeans up over his ass. He knew what he was doing to Wolfman, but loved to watch him squirm. \"Don't you worry your pretty head about it Wolf—It's done.\" Hollywood said, turning his attention once again to the mirror. Wolfman nodded, but found himself sneaking a look at Hollywood's ass sliding in to the jeans. ' No underwear? Ohh man… ' Wolfman bit his bottom lip. He felt himself sweating, but luckily his skin was still wet to make much of a difference. \"Hey. Wolf…\" Hollywood, turned back to the mirror, and watched Wolfman through the mirror, unseen by his eyes. Wolfman made a noise somewhere between 'Hm?' or 'Huh?', he didn't care which. By now, Wolfman had sat up on the bench and followed Hollywood's example in removing his towel, much to Hollywood's pleasure, was semi-hard, struggling to quickly slip on his tight little boxers before Hollywood turned around. He could hardly breathe. \"Is it true? What they say about Southern boys?\" Hollywood asked, huskily; his breath steaming up the mirror as he slowly rubbed the front of his jeans. \"What about us 'Wood?\" Wolfman was acting erratically, gulping a lot and his eyes darting around the room. Obviously he didn't know Hollywood was getting himself off watching the object of his lust trying to his own 'wood'. Hollywood felt somewhat guilty. He'd always harbored an attraction to him, and felt it rather cruel the way they teased each other with their usual sexually tense banter. They had experimented—with Slider, as fortune would have it, some time ago. They were very, very drunk and remembered very little, and elected to never mention it again. But Hollywood, finding the sweet soul of Wolfman harder to resist every day; Everyday his feelings grew stronger, bigger, until his heart hurt so much he felt like he'd rather die than hold this inside any longer. He'd fallen hard for him, but fought it with all he could. \"That you have a lot of stamina?\" Hollywood bit his lower lip, watching with an amazed expression as his flustered blonde friend pulled his boxers back off and tossed them in his locker before pulling on his jeans—commando. Hollywood bit back a moan. He'd noticed how Hollywood went commando—how could he not? And copied him. But he wasn't a big thinker, and all he could do was stare with his mouth agape and watering as he watched Wolf's hardening cock disappear inside his jeans. \"Wanna find out?\" Wolfman grinned, slipping on his t-shirt. This was getting too much to handle for poor Hollywood, who was aching so bad he wanted nothing more than to just get some friction. He discreetly palmed himself under his jeans while putting away his things with his free hand. \"Name the time and place pretty boy.\" He was joking—but not really. Hollywood needed to get his mind off of sex, which was almost impossible with his hand stroking himself. But in a quick glance in the mirror, he noticed Wolf was fully dressed, apart from shoes and cowboy hat—which was sitting on his lap, and he decided he'd better follow suit. He slipped on his belt and shirt and managed to shift his hard-on to a more comfortable position. He turned to face Wolfman who was sat, with one foot across his knee, pulling black sock over it. They met each other's eyes, and Wolfman smirked brightly as Hollywood grabbed the clothes hooks attached to the bench and used them as leverage to bring his face down close to inches from his. Wolfman was the pretty one- that had been established during one drunken night with Slider. Wolfman disputed it and cutely declared he was the manly one, to which they laughed. They also decided Hollywood was 'Handsome Hollywood', which he nodded in agreement. Slider was the sexy one, no one disagreed—the man was sexy from head to toe. Iceman was disputed between Hollywood saying he was the second-perfect one behind himself obviously, and Slider saying he was the beautiful one, they both grimaced at how pathetic that sounded and decided to leave Iceman on the back bench for now and moved on to Maverick… who they decided was… well, just Maverick really. \"Bring it on city-boy.\" Wolfman sounded… different. His hard-on wasn't going away at this rate. Could Wolfman be finally getting it? He hoped so with all his heart… and other places. \"You should ditch him.\" Slider warned, leaning back on the two-legs of a chair in front of Ice's desk, his feet crossed over the desk, flattening some paperwork. He was also chewing something, while throwing discarded peanut shells across the desk trying to get them in Ice's cold cup of coffee. Iceman stood at the window, leaning against the frame and just gazing out across the base. He hadn't stopped thinking about the day before. Maverick thoughtlessly making them both relive the past. It was painful. He missed Goose too. And how Maverick could have forgotten that to make almost the same mistake that got him killed two decades ago is beyond his comprehension. He'd forgive him overtime, and he knew that Slider only wanted the best for Ice, but still found it difficult to accept him as being with him. It was hard to accept at first, but Maverick and Iceman walking in Topgun one day to find Slider, along with Hollywood and Wolfman, naked and passed out in the lounge room. So, finding Maverick and Iceman nuzzling each other… well, Slider had little to call him on. \"Slider…\" Iceman's voice ground out, choked from not speaking for a while. Slider looked at his back, surprised to finally hear him speak. He didn't sound angry or upset or anything. Slider was going to say something to commemorate the opening of the mouth, but he knew to be sensitive when it called for it. \"I love him.\" Slider choked on his peanuts and went wide-eyed for a minute, unsure of anything to say. He'd never hear Iceman say anything of the sort in his life, ever. And he knew him better than anyone, how could he not notice this? He was mentally kicking himself. If Iceman said he loved someone, he definitely was inclined to believe him. \"You? You do?\" Slider ungracefully pushed back on the chair and almost fell on his ass before running his hand through his hair and standing. \"Oh… man, how did you let that happen?\" Slider had put his foot in his mouth he knew and bit his lip, stopping himself from saying any more. Iceman nodded. Slider came up to Iceman from behind and slid his arms around his waist, nuzzling his face in to his neck. \"I am so sorry.\" He whispered, making Ice shiver. He felt warm against his back. Somehow Slider always managed to make him feel better and worse all at the same time. \"I thought you were just screwing. I-well, forget what I think.\" Ice nodded and squeezed Sliders hand as it came to hold his. \"You love him? I get it… I'm happy for you.\" He was, but he didn't want to share him. \"Does he love you?\" He asked, finally releasing Ice, who turned to pull him close against his body with one arm around his waist. Their eyes met and Ice's teary eyes said it all. And Slider felt his heart break; he didn't want Ice to feel like this, he loved him too much. He nodded. \"Then it'll all work out.\" Ice had to roll his eyes. \"I didn't think you were the romantic type Slider.\" Iceman wiped his eyes and cupped his face, silently thanking him with a hug. \"Thank-you.\" Slider felt tears prick his eyes, he had to blink and break away in a haste, a new energy found him. \"Aww, man I'm gonna cry, knock it off with all the sappy shit.\" Slider grinned and wrapped his knuckles against his chest. Iceman nodded and the pair just looked at each other, not sure what they should do. \"Look… before you go off and get Maverick back. I need to say something…\" Iceman just stared, in all seriousness, smiles gone. \"I'm not condoning what he did… Please, tell me you'll take him down a peg?\" \"Slider… apologize for punching him. And I'll consider talking to him.\" Iceman knew Slider didn't like that. He had to apologize, but he wasn't going to like it. He shrugged and reluctantly nodded. They shook on it and Slider knew—Maverick or no Maverick, their friendship was unbreakable, and Iceman was finally able to clear his mind of things troubling him and return to himself a little more. \"Hey, Mav?\" Maverick turned from where he was lined in the gym, taking a shot with a basketball, straight through the hoop. He felt his nose and eye sting at first sight of the taller man. He wasn't sure of what this was but he was fairly pumped up from a day of basketball to fight. Maverick caught the ball as it rolled back to him. \"Oh. Hey Slider.\" Maverick was on edge, but held his ground. They were alone in the gym; Slider timed it just right so to get this chance. He knew it probably looked bad, but it kind of amused him to think that Maverick was scared of him. Slider however, was the one who looked scared; he had more sweat stains than Maverick. And refused to make eye contact with his adversary, scratching the back of his head. Judging by Sliders sheepish behavior, he wasn't here to fight at all. He kinda knew what this might be; either a third-party breakup from Iceman, or a third-party make-up. He tossed the ball to him to break the awkwardness. Thankful, Slider caught it and pressed it to his side with his palm. \"You busy?\" Slider shrugged, losing his nerve. Maverick gave him a look but then shook his head and snorted, catching the ball as he tossed it back. \"Nah man.\" Maverick bounced the ball from his left hand to his right hand before letting it bounce over to Slider, who caught it overhead. Slider took this as an opportunity to procrastinate from the original goal—and to show off; Slider bounced the ball with one hand. He was more of a beach sports kind of guy, but he got in to it; moving in and trying to get a basket, which was deflected by Maverick. \"Why'd you ask?\" \"Eh… forget about it.\" Maverick nodded, letting it drop for now. Maverick made his way over to the benches and grabbed bottled water. Slider started pacing as Maverick gulped water. He seemed to reconsider. \"Actually… Maverick. Sorry.\" He said. \"What for?\" Maverick was naïve sometimes. It infuriated Slider, who hoped Maverick understood enough so he didn't have to explain himself, but that would have been too easy. Sliders face went a noticeable shade redder. \"Hitting you dipshit.\" Maverick's cheeks went a shade redder than Slider's. \"Oh right. Forget about it man. I had it coming.\" Maverick stood and made another basket. Slider's smile seemed to appreciate Maverick's attitude. \"Yeah, you did.\" Maverick raised his eyebrow watching as Slider unbuttoned his shirt and slipped it off, throwing it to the bench. \"Geez Slider.\" Maverick watched in amusement as Slider slapped the ball out of his hands and ran while bouncing the ball to make a basket. \"Do you use every opportunity to take your shirt off?\" Maverick laughed, happy to feel the tension break and very grateful to be in Maverick's company without wanting to snap his neck for once. In fact, it was going very well. Maverick would have been his kind of friend if he weren't going out with his best friend. Slider laughed and at some point flexed his biceps and flashed Maverick a wink. \"Come on Maverick, If you had this body wouldn't you wanna show it off?\" Slider grinned, seeing Maverick look away before tossing him the ball again. \"You flirting with me Slider?\" Maverick chuckled, coming up and bouncing the ball off of Slider's muscled chest and catching it again. Slider made a weak attempt at swatting it away but had somehow found himself coming closer to Maverick. \"Huh?\" He taunted, bouncing the ball off him again. Slider kept moving closer, lazily trying to snatch the ball from Maverick, who retreated back a step each time. And finally forgetting their hostilities and jealousies of each other, Slider rushed him, and wrestled Maverick to the ground, straddling his hips. They were laughing loudly and had forgot the ball as it rolled away, just like the memory of Maverick's flight antics. \"I'm pretty sure you're flirting with me Slider man.\" \"Ego Maverick?\" He chuckled and shifted in a very suggestive manner on top of Maverick to watch him squirm under him. \"Ugh, horny much Slider?\" Maverick said with disgust, but still couldn't help laughing; it was typical Slider—coming on to his best friends love interest. But Slider wasn't serious; this was how he acted with pretty much everyone and in a strange way he finally felt accepted by him. Slider liked him. And all it took was getting hit by him to realize it. Maverick felt a little lightheaded. If Slider was here, it meant that he'd left Ice to apologize, meaning Iceman was probably in a forgiving mood after a couple of days to cool down. And that realization was such a relief he broke in to giggles. \"Yeah I know I am.\" Slider grinned, grabbing Maverick by the chin, watching with curiosity as the smaller man laughed quite loudly. \"You got a problem Maverick?\" \"So where is the Iceman?\" After Maverick's laughter had died down, Slider shook his head and muttered something about him being crazy. \"Probably on his way home—Base shut up for the day an hour ago.\" Maverick nodded, remembering that he played basketball after he finished up. It had become part of his day so he forgot he was free to go. \"I'm pretty sure he wants to see you too… he really loves you ya know.\" Slider didn't sound to have an ounce of jealousy in his voice and that made Maverick feel uncomfortable; the man he loved also loved him, and there he was, laid up under Slider. It was a Twilight Zone type feeling and he decided he needed to come back in to reality. \"Okay… so…\" Maverick whistled. Slider grinned, knowing exactly what Maverick was asking, but he had made a new little game and he was enjoying it. He just stared blankly down at Maverick. Slider just looked around the room. \"Ahem… Slider…\" \"Hmm?\" Slider looked down, Maverick was getting annoyed but still had a smile on his face that said he didn't entirely mind too much, and there was no rush. \"Slider get off!\" He laughed and bucked his hips, being as unsubtle as possible and Slider had to laugh too, and released Maverick. Both men were on their feet, brushing themselves off. Slider retrieved the ball from the corner of the room and held it to his body before coming back to Maverick who was sat slipping his own shirt in to his gym bag. Slider held out his hand to Maverick, after wiping the sweat on his sweat pants. \"Friends?\" Slider had the warmest expression on his face that he'd ever seen. \"Friends.\" Maverick grinned happily and accepted his hand. Slider pulled him to his feet and it to a long-awaited hug that Maverick accepted gratefully. Old grudges put to rest finally after two decades. Maverick felt damn good. \"Another game?\" Slider asked, pulling Mav against his shoulder. \"Are you kidding? I'll wipe the floor with ya!\" Maverick seemed excited, which was good. \"But just one game—I got a hot date waiting.\" He smiled, and got back in the game with Slider, who had managed to persuade him in to staying shirtless. He wasn't ashamed of his body and didn't shy away from showing off either. \"Ah don't worry, I'll make sure you don't stand this one up.\" Slider didn't say Charlie, but it went without saying. Slider was a slippery bastard, but he had more sense than to bring up the past any more. Maverick ended up winning, probably because Slider was too busy flexing or grinding against Mav when defending the basket. While they weren't officially employed at Topgun, Hollywood and Wolfman hung around Topgun almost daily and volunteered their experience and services to assist. But most of the assisting they engaged in was lounging around the break room or drinking at the O club. They received their pay as I they were official employees. No one complained, they were like old fixtures around the place no one wanted to see go. Hollywood however, had a license as a commercial pilot he obtained ten years earlier which he was paid very well and decided to retire early and move to town with Wolfman; who was never too far from Hollywood did some crop dusting, and since money was never a big motivator in his life, he lived quite happily without needing to spend anything, so he had amassed a large sum over the years which just sat untouched. He used paychecks to pay for essentials. Hollywood in contrast was a big spender, he rarely ever wore the same outfit twice and even had spare's of his spare's. They seemed like an unlikely match; the one who liked to live off the land—figuratively speaking, and the one who couldn't live without his weekly spa treatments. But once they had reunited as part-time instructors at Topgun, they had become inseparable. Though they didn't live together, they lived nearby; Hollywood's lifestyle was too lavish for his tastes. But he knew that deep inside; Hollywood wasn't as vain as he'd like people to believe. He was brave and cared deeply for the lives of his friends in the air and never made a mistake. And so when Hollywood thought of Maverick in the air, he couldn't believe how he could have done such a stupid and careless maneuver just to steal a kill. He'd never do that, but Wolfman seemed to just care about Maverick getting the boot from Iceman more than he cared about what happened. \"What? You must be crazy.\" \"You don't see a problem with what he did? Come on Wolf, really? You stupid?\" \"Naw, you aint listenin'!\" Wolf grabbed the sides of his head and covered his ears. He cursed himself by lulling Hollywood in to this conversation, he wanted it but now Hollywood wasn't letting it drop. He'd had a few drinks and was speaking his mind. \"Then why don't you tell me? 'Cause I sure as fuck don't get what could justify acting like an asshole! Oh, what's that? You don't know? Big surprise.\" \"Well—well you could'a fooled me, 'cause your d-doin' a pretty god job of bein' one yourself.\" Wolfman didn't stutter usually, but he too had being drinking and they had ended up at Wolf's place watching old re-runs of black and white movies and for some reason, Hollywood was shouting, and Wolfman couldn't deal. But that last line shut him up and Hollywood had to clench his jaw. They never fought. And Hollywood realized Wolfman was right to fear Maverick's actions having a ripple effect on their friendships. And Wolfman wondered why Hollywood didn't want to get involved. Hollywood felt bad, that pleading look on his friend's eyes told him how hurt he was and he regretted it instantly. He badly wanted to hold him close and whisper how sorry he was for getting angry, wanted to tell him all the things he had buried deep in his hear and make things better again—but he couldn't. He just shook his head and marched out of the front door, leaving Wolfman feeling more alone than ever. As soon as the cool air touched his skin, tears were coaxed free and fell helplessly down his cheeks. He felt so bad he couldn't find the strength to walk—sitting on Wolfman's porch, face hot in his hands. His shoulders convulsed as he silently broke down in to himself. He withdrew so far, he felt so ashamed. Why did love hurt so much? Maverick wasn't going to screw up this time, he swore. And after he and Slider parted ways, he vowed to make a better effort; he put on his dress whites, combed his hair. He was starting to feel like Hollywood. But luckily for Maverick, he knew what he wanted, and he wasn't going to let it get away. But Maverick couldn't help admire himself in the mirror, he'd aged well, as they all did, but he truly thought the age of romance was lost to all but the young. And he was especially surprised that entering a relationship with someone he'd known as a friends for years, a male friend, wasn't a walk in the park. They found out new things about each other every day, things that they didn't know despite knowing each other for nearly thirty years. Such as Iceman needing romance, well that part he wasn't sure of, even after declaring his love, he hadn't been particularly talkative. But he felt like that was part of their problem. So now, as Maverick rang Iceman's doorbell, he had no idea of what to say or what to do, If Iceman was anything he wasn't predictable. There was no plan, just for Maverick to break the silence. He couldn't stand avoiding him anymore. He just wanted to see him smile again. He lived for it. It rang several times; he knew Iceman was in, he could see the light in the kitchen. And then he answered the door wearing an open white bathrobe—which Maverick knew he wore around the house for events like getting a midnight snack… or answering the door. \"Early night?\" Iceman wasn't amused, just gave him a sassy-ass look and leaned against the doorframe with his arms folded, waiting for Maverick to explain himself. He didn't even comment on how good Maverick looked. Maverick cleared his throat, and shuffled, from foot to foot while coming up with something to say. \"I'm not gonna apologize.\" Ice blinked, he hadn't expected that. \"No?\" Iceman raised his brow. \"I'm Maverick.\" \"Yes… Maverick, Pete Mitchell, I… pretty much know all that by now.\" Ice pinched the bridge of his nose. He could already tell this was a metaphorical Maverick. \"I'm him and he's me and we're not gonna change.\" Maverick seemed to have found a new energy and sounded practically high. \"It's called coexistence.\" \"No… It's called schizophrenia.\" Iceman quipped. But Maverick was still going. \"In the air I'm Maverick , I didn't get my name for no reason, as you didn't get yours for no reason, but you know I'm not Maverick all the time, and I'm sure your not Iceman all the time. But sometimes—I just gotta be Maverick! Y'know? He's the only one who gives me confidence in the air—over confidence if you wanna call it that, but hell if Pete Mitchell got up in the plane right now, I wouldn't know what to do.\" \"Your insane.\" Maverick wasn't listening. \"And here—when I'm with you… I don't need Maverick, 'cause—'cause all I need is you. And I'll be damned if I loose what I have with you because you won't accept the whole of me.\" Ice rolled his eyes; he had long since gotten over Mavericks in-flight antics and was getting bored with his desperate ranting's. \"Mitchell…\" Iceman reached for the top beam of the door frame with both hands, stretching out his lithe body so much, his robe came loose, and showed off his glory. \"I'm not finished.\" Maverick averted his eyes. \"I-I like me… and I won't leave until you accept me for all I am… even if I do some thing's that piss you off.\" \"Maverick…\" \"No. I won't apologize. Goose is… Goose is dead and he's not coming back, and I know that if he saw what I did the other day—granted, he wouldn't have been too impressed, but did anyone stop to think that maybe, just maybe I am a good pilot, and I knew exactly what I was doing. I mean shit! It's not like I pull that crap every day, because I know It's dangerous, and I wouldn't have done it if I wasn't 100% sure I'd make the shot!\". \"Maverick…\" Iceman heard what he was saying. And it sunk in, he felt like the bad guy for not believing in Maverick from the beginning. He should have. \"No! I'm not finished…\" \"Yeah you are.\" Iceman growled, low and grabbed Maverick by the collar. At first Maverick thought he was going to beat the shit out of him, but then his lips were on his, and his tongue was in his mouth. He was being dragged inside, buttons popping open. \"Ice!\" Maverick yelped in protest, managing to drag him away from his hot swollen lips and keep him at arms distance, which was much harder than he would have imagined—Iceman was a very good kisser. He licked a hot wet trail down Mavericks chin, and down the bare flesh exposed behind his buttons, dropping to his knees. \"Aw come on Maverick, I thought you loved my blowjobs.\" Ice's mouth closed over Maverick's clothed cock, sucking the material hard and leaving a big wet patch. Maverick bit back a moan—seeing Iceman like this never failed to make him hard as steel. But he didn't want this to happen like this. He pushed Iceman off, and pulled him up by his shoulders, kissing him hard one more time, letting Ice's teeth tug at his bottom lip with no small amount of spite. \"Stop it… Please…\" Their eyes met. \"Tom.\" Ice stopped breathing for a moment. And for that moment, they both felt it; felt the mighty wings come down and sweep them both away like the grandest fighter jet. Heaven-bound and soaring through the clouds. It didn't last long, but they both felt it. And no one was leading anyone on this time. \"Shit—I need you Ice.\" He whispered so quietly, Ice had to raise his head so to wrap his arms around him. Ice abandoned the chance of getting any sex. This was better; cuddling in to his neck and just holding each other, before Maverick, Iceman had never known such intimacy. Maverick had done the same before, with women, but it wasn't the same, it wasn't the same. \"I'm sorry.\" Maverick mumbled quietly in to his shoulder. \"…For being an asshole.\" Iceman chuckled lightly, and began stroking his hair. \"Do my ears deceive me? Did Mitchell just apologize for being Maverick?\" Iceman made a mocking gasp and was met by a little shove. \"Shu'up, all this isn't easy for me you know.\" Maverick buried his face in to his shoulder. Ice couldn't see, but he could tell his face was flushed against him. \"I know Mitchell…\" Ice smiled and reluctantly broke away to slide Maverick's white jacket off of his shoulders and casually dropped it against the back of the couch. He ran his hands up Maverick's bare arms and his hands met at the back of Maverick's neck to pull him in to a gentle kiss. \"Love you… all both of you.\" Maverick rolled his eyes and held him close again. \"Love you Tom. I'm sorry I almost… you know, ended this.\" \"You know Mitchell… to say you weren't going to apologize, you're doing it a lot.\" \"Tom…\" \"I know… all is forgiven.\" Ice grinned and kissed him once more. \"Now enough with all this damn talking… let's go to bed.\" Maverick didn't argue. \"I hate Christmas.\" \"Why?\" Mitchell asked, swirling his drink around the bottom of the glass, the ice making clinking sounds as he watched the shrinking cubes with some level of boredom. \"It's… superficial.\" Hollywood was being a downer lately, but he was the only other person here to talk to, and besides, Maverick was a little concerned—Hollywood was never alone. Iceman and Slider said they'd meet up, but Mav and Hollywood were a little early, so it gave them some time to talk. \"But… you're Hollywood. How can you of all people hate the superficial?\" He let out a little chuckle, sipping the last drop and signaling the bar tender for another. \"I hate all the pretending; all the fake smiles and half-hearted gifts.\" Hollywood was twizzling the little pink umbrella from his margarita between his fingers. Maverick noticed that Hollywood sounded off and looked sideways at him. \"It sounds like someone had a rough childhood.\" Maverick said. The corners of Hollywood's lips turned down slightly, and he put the pretty pink umbrella behind his own ear like a pencil. Maverick felt suddenly bad for him and put a comforting arm around him, squeezing his shoulder. \"Hey buddy, what's wrong?\" Hollywood shook his head sadly and put on an obviously fake smile, squeezing Mavericks hand on his shoulder before standing up and shrugging him off. \"Look—no, It's nothing. I-I gotta go… I'm sorry Mav, tell the guys I'm… just tell 'em I'm sorry.\" Hollywood broke off and bolted through a group of people on the dance floor and to the exit. \"'Wood!\" Maverick stood and called after him, but he was already gone. Maverick was left stunned and flustered, throwing up his arms in defeat and taking the fresh drink that had just been slid across the bar to him. He would have chased after him if the gathering crowd wasn't already blocking his path. And he knew from experience that when a man wanted to be alone, he was wise enough to leave him alone. \"What was that all about?\" Maverick sat down and shook his head. But he wasn't alone for long, he felt someone press against his back and a loud whisper in his ear. \"What was what all about?\" \"Slider.\" Maverick turned to face him, smiling widely and accepted his greeting hug, slapping his back before Slider stood next to him, leaning on the bar as he ordered his usual. He looked at Maverick with a questioning look. \"Oh, It's nothing.\" Slider nodded, although he knew it probably wasn't nothing, otherwise he'd have been willing to talk about it, he usually did. By the time Iceman and Wolfman showed up, they'd managed to find a corner booth, in the back where it was quieter. Maverick sat in between Iceman and Wolf, while Slider took Ice's other side. Ice gave Maverick's thigh a stroke under the table. Neither of them were willing to outwardly show affection in such a public place, even with most of the flyboys in the building being gay. \"You're quiet tonight Wolf.\" Slider noted. Wolfman just looked up from his drink to give him an awkward smile. \"Am I? Sorry Slider.\" Wolfman's speech was slurred even for him. Slider's brow creased, he'd known Wolf long enough to know he was never quiet. He decided to probe further since he had a good idea what was the problem. \"Where's 'Wood?\" He asked, Wolfman didn't flinch, just gave a barely noticeable shrug, which spelt, to both Slider and Maverick that Wolf probably didn't care where he was. Iceman had at that point returned from the restroom and the positioning had changed when Slider moved to let him past; Slider had rounded the table and sat next to Wolfman, so his behavior was more noticeable. Ice returned and got Maverick all to himself; their arms were draped over each other possessively. \"Oh yeah…\" Maverick interrupted. \"Hollywood said he couldn't stay.\" Maverick shrugged and both Ice and Slider looked at him curiously. \"What?\" \"When?\" Slider asked, leaning over Wolf to get to Maverick's face. Maverick was a little puzzled. \"Err… not too long ago. He just said something about not liking Christmas and just sort of ran out of here.\" Maverick sipped his drink to avoid Slider's burning eyes. Slider nodded and scratched his head, turning his attention back to Wolfman, who really was being very quiet. \"Wolf what happened?\" Slider bluntly asked. Ice wasn't getting involved. Wolfman sighed heavily and pressed his hands to his eyes as he leaned back against the booth wall. His face was reddened. \"Come on, it wasn't Maverick's fault… for once. So that leaves you. He was pissed before Maverick spoke to him… for once. And you've both been acting weird lately. So what happened?\" \"God Slider ! Nothin' happened.\" Wolf wasn't giving anything up, but both Slider and Ice saw right through him. Maverick was busy shaking off Sliders' scathing insults to notice much about what was happening. Wolfman was starting to crack and it was so close to coming out. \"Hollywood's just a bastard.\" Iceman even had to raise his brow at that one. \"Right.\" Iceman shook his head, he'd credulously hoped that they could go one night out and not have it turn in to some bitch fight. He exaggerated his displeasure at the situation by resting his head on Maverick's shoulder and tried to sleep. \"Wait? What's going on?\" Maverick was so naïve sometimes, Slider had to sigh. \"Really Mitchell?\" Iceman chuckled. \"Maverick, 'Wood is in love with Wolf\". \"What?\" Maverick and Wolfman said in unison. Slider shook his head and downed his drink; he could tell this was going to be a long night. \"Yeah, and Wolf is too friggin' dumb to realize what's been going on and it's been tearing ''Wood up inside.\" Slider slipped his shades up in to his hair. Wolfman looked seriously distressed, hands digging through his hair, shaking his head and looking like he wanted to get the hell out of there. \"He has? Wait—what? Ugh I have a headache.\" Maverick really had no idea. Iceman thought it was adorable if it wasn't also incredibly sad. Wolfman felt his pain. \"Naw, that can't be right. Hollywood isn't gay—he'd have told me!\" Wolf was close to shouting; Slider had gone off to get another drink. Well, a round of drinks. Something told him they'd need it. \"Ah, the beauty of denial.\" Ice spoke in to his glass. Maverick shifted away from Ice and tried to comfort Wolfman, but he was having none of it; he kept Maverick's hands from closing around him. His mind was seriously muddled, but Maverick kept close, knowing that Wolfman had been there for him once; he could at least return the favor. He was acting like a cat on fire. Maverick finally managed to get an arm around him to at least keep him from his awkward fidgeting. \"He…but Mav he's not gay is he?\" Wolf looked like he was about to have a heart attack, his skin was a dark pink and he was so far beyond twitchy he was nearing the spasm stage. Maverick didn't know what to say, he just looked to Iceman as if pleading for help and Iceman just coolly smiled. \"Well, that's something you gotta ask Hollywood man.\" Maverick was new to this whole comforting thing, but with Wolfman it was like trying to tame a raging bull. \"Are-\" Maverick cut off, seeing Slider rejoin them; he helped take the four drinks from Slider's two hands and distributed them. \"Are you?\" \"Am I what Maverick?\" Wolfman asked, a warning tone in his voice. Maverick wasn't deterred. \"Are you gay?\" He whispered quietly. Wolfman scowled and pulled Maverick's arm from him. He put his face in his hands with shoulders resting on the table. \"I-I don't know… I haven't… I mean I.\" Wolf stuttered, he was having a hard time processing this information. Slider sat back down. \"Wolf… we fucked once remember?\" Everyone's eyes went wide and looked to Slider. Obviously Wolfman had forgot. \"What? No… we so didn't.\" Wolfman looked grossed out. \"Yeah we did. Hollywood was there too remember.\" \"Slider!\" Iceman reached over and smacked him behind the head. \"I've told you before about lying about your sexual conquests… I knew that threesome thing was bullshit.\" Iceman shook his head. \"No… wait a minute.\" Wolfman started, suddenly looking strangely relieved. \"We did… oh hell, we did.\" Maverick scowled and Iceman just laughed in disbelief. Slider looked very smug and flashed Ice a told you so grin. Ice scoffed and went back to his drink fully satisfied with himself. But then, Wolf turned on Slider and snatched the drink out of his hand. \"Hey!\" Slider threw up his arms in an, oh forget it pose. Wolfman downed Slider's drink and then his own. \"Shit.\" \"We didn't fuck Slider. We had a circle jerk.\" Wolf finally admitted. Maverick choked on an ice cube. He so didn't need to hear that. \"I think you mean a triangle jerk Wolf.\" Ice corrected in humor. \"Whatever. I-I think I get it now.\" Wolfman was calming down. Maverick watched with interest as Wolf managed to break in to a huge smirk. \"He does… he fuckin' loves me the big queer-o.\" Wolf laughed and leaned back, obviously a lightweight. \"God he was right; I am soo stupid.\" \"I think someone just had a revelation.\" Ice said. \"Hallelujah.\" Slider laughed and kissed Wolfman behind the ear. \"You good now Wolf?\" Maverick asked sensitively. He responded with a little nod, and Maverick smiled back at him. \"Yeah Mav. Thanks.\" Maverick kissed him on the other side and Wolfman smiled so brightly he felt like he had the best friends in the world. \"Aren't you forgetting someone?\" Ice interrupted, leaning over Mav and cupping Wolfman's cheeks to kiss him on the cheek. Wolfman was blushing like crazy. \"Yeah, thanks guys… I love y'all too.\" \"I meant you're forgetting Hollywood , Wolf.\" Ice added, stroking a hand through Maverick's hair lazily. He nodded sheepishly. \"Yeah… I should make everything up to him.\" He was filled with new energy. \"Have fun.\" Ice winked, watching as Slider and Maverick wish his luck as Wolfman practically ran for the door. \"Now that's a love story I'm glad I stayed out of.\" \"Whoo… take a look at that.\" Slider whispered; gazing with heated eyes at a hot you stud leaning over the bar. \"Slider, four words; Out. Of. Your. League.\" Maverick grinned, watching as Slider flipped him off and went off in search of this new prospect, leaving Ice and Mav unaccompanied. Wolfman had no idea what he was doing, but he had come up with a decent plan to get through to Hollywood, he needed to hear the truth, and he was going to stop at nothing to hear it from Hollywood in person. He felt sick to his stomach that all this time, all of the playful sexual banter, was not a joke, and it was screwing with Hollywood's head. After a quick stop at home to grab a few things to help his plan, he made his way to Hollywood's big-ass house near the beach; he couldn't drive there, so he walked. And the long walk gave him time to think—and more importantly to sober up. Which, considering he was dressed like a southern Santa Claus. A long red Santa robe covered him and instead of his typical cowboy hat, Wolfman had donned a red, sequined cowboy hat he used for costume parties… and well, obviously Christmas. He felt like an idiot—and looked like one too, but he figured Hollywood would get the joke enough to loosen up and actually talk to him. As he got to Hollywood's place; a three-story beach house, he suddenly felt overcome with nerves. Which was unusual for him, but this was Hollywood right? His Hollywood. The guy who'd been his best friend and constant companion for thirty something years? Then why did he feel so nervous? He'd spent half of his life in his company but was feeling so damn weak at the knees he hat to sit on some steps to catch his breath. This wasn't going to be as easy as he thought, but it was too late to turn back now—and he was confident that his hastily thought-out plan would work. \"What's up?\" Hollywood answered the door, but failed to be impressed by Wolfman's ridiculous choice of clothing. \"Nice getup Saint Nick.\" Hollywood didn't laugh, but his lips curved in to a crooked smile. \"I suppose you wanna come in… you look like a dork.\" He shook his head; he couldn't stomach to look at him. Hollywood still felt terrible for the things he said to Wolfman and he very nearly broke down and cried again seeing Wolfman's adorable smile and bright eyes. He didn't understand how Wolf could be so forgiving. \"So err… I hear ya hate Christmas?\" Wolf walked passed Hollywood and walked in to the very modern and open-spaced house Hollywood called home. It was not to his taste but he loved hanging out here when they had parties and poker games. It was the biggest place so everyone could happily fit inside. \"Yeah.\" Hollywood confessed, flopping down on his white leather couch, hands behind his head in a typically macho way. He wasn't going to open his mouth anymore, Wolfman appeared to have forgot all about the other night and he was just thankful that he was here and talking to him, he didn't care what it was about. \"Will this change your mind?\" Hollywood's eyes practically bulged out of his head, this was fucking amazing; Wolf has released the clasp of his Santa robe, letting it fall at his red, sequined cowboy boots. Hollywood gulped audibly and felt his chest tighten as his eyes wandered up Wolfman's bare legs, and muscled thighs. \" Holy Fuck … It might\" Hollywood felt his pants tighten at the sight of Wolfman naked but for Boots, hat and tight little red sparkly briefs. Hollywood sat up and his fingers dug in to the material of his jeans around his knees. \"Yeah? Well, I hope so… \" Wolfman said, sexily tilting his hat and hooking his thumb under the waistband of his briefs. \"This took a lot of balls.\" \"Yeah I can see what you mean\" Hollywood mumbled, busying his fingers with a packet of cigarettes, taking one out and popping one in to his mouth, but his eyes caught something so interesting, he forgot about lighting the thing and let the pack fall. Wolfman grinned, the gleaming white teeth and perfect vision of masculine beauty made Hollywood so hard, he felt himself straining in his jeans—he only hoped Wolf didn't notice, or how much he was sweating either. He tried not to look. But the lure of seeing something so irresistible, something he'd wanted and dreamt about since as long as he could remember—it wasn't possible. His eyes glided from left to right, pretending he was looking elsewhere, but Wolfman figured out his game. His silence said more than his action ever could. \"Wolf what're you…\" His words trailed off, finding Wolfman's thighs coming to rest next to him. He was straddling Hollywood. Ohh . \"Oh I don't know… what does it look like?\" Wolfman winked. Hollywood's hands found Wolf's thighs, preventing him from falling back out of his lap. He looked so damn hot, raising his arms behind his head and arching his back. Hollywood had to gasp, feeling Wolfman's taut ass grind down in to his crotch—if Wolfman's intentions before weren't obvious, they sure were now, and Hollywood couldn't have been happier. \"Alright cowboy, show me what you got.\" Hollywood finally snapped, his half-smile turning in to a massive toothy grin. His voice was croaked but that was understandable considering how much he wanted to say to Wolfman, how much he needed to say—but right now he figured it could wait. \"You got it big boy.\" Wolf had things he wanted to hear too, but it was all a haze when his lips found his. \"Look at me Kazansky; Do I look drunk to you?\" He did. \"Well, you did just suggest a five-some.\" They were walking out of the Officer's Club. Slider had left with the bar hunk and they were grateful to have some time alone. Most of it was spent whispering little words to each other, and Ice stroking Maverick's hand under the table. \"Come on I was joking!\" He wasn't joking. \"I know… but you are drunk.\" Ice said, slowing his walking to hold the dizzy brunettes arm as he helped guide him down the sidewalk. He didn't so much mind Maverick's sexual fantasies, but the idea of some kind of gay-pilot orgy with their best friends was completely out of this world, even if it was an attractive idea. \"Am not.\" \"Are too.\" Ice muttered, still dragging Maverick home, they had things to talk about, but Iceman wasn't much of a talker, especially when Maverick was in such a giddy mood. He'd probably have to drop an ice cube down his back. He liked that idea. \"Am not.\" Maverick wasn't even sure what he was saying he wasn't anymore; he was smirking stupidly, eyes half closed and just letting Ice drag him along. \"I'm not doing this right now.\" Ice's annoyance never really showed, he usually had some playful smile going on even if he was angry—which was a little creepy and intimidating, but his smile never failed to make Maverick twitch. \"Am not!\" He drunkenly responded. Iceman had had enough, he grabbed Maverick by the shoulders, and stopped to face him. \"Mitchell, shut up.\" He growled, but his smile definitely said he really didn't give a damn if he heeded his words or not, Iceman just wanted to look at him drunkenly swaying and unable to focus properly. \"Blow me Kazansky.\" He spat. Ice couldn't resist playing him. \"Already?\" His eyebrow went up and he wrapped an arm around him again, but then again, if it got Maverick to his house quicker, he was happy to accommodate. He shrugged. \"Alright you got it\". Maverick went silent at that and to hell with the resistance, he thought, letting Ice take him under his mighty wing and continuing on their way to whoever's house was the nearest. ","Summary":" Mighty Wings Fandom : Top Gun Summary : After an in-flight error, Maverick and Iceman's partnership"},{"Movie":"Top Gun","Title":"Back in the Air","Author":"Cielag","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9204771","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Author's Note: This is a World War Two alternate universe for \"Top Gun\" where I've taken the main characters, Maverick, Iceman, Viper, Goose, and Slider and put them in the South Pacific. Due to the fact that Corsairs were single-seaters, I've turned Goose and Slider into pilots themselves, helping to expand the squadron. For the time, they are island-based rather than carrier, but this doesn't mean that I won't be writing about that in the future. As always, I claim none of these characters as my own nor am I making a profit from this in any way. It's merely a way to explore new ideas and get me writing about aviation again. Bringing the aircraft through the clouds, Ice felt a slight surge of excitement the moment the nose broke the cloud top, pushing him into the perpetual blue. Shifting the stick to the left while simotaneously pressing his foot against the left pedal, the aciton was rewarded with an immediate roll to the right. Ice kept his movement slight, allowing the Corsair to turn on its axis in a singular, graceful swoop. Without waiting to come to a full three-sixty, Ice reversed his actions, sending the Corsair back to the left. To his delight, the plane only needed a gentle touch to follow his commands. \"How's she handling, Iceman?\" came Viper's voice over the radio. \"I'm dancing with a ballerina!\" replied Ice enthusiastically as he put the stick all the way against his right thigh and sent the Corsair into a complete roll. From somewhere behind him, Viper followed Ice and watched with quiet contentment as the Corsair frolicked above the clouds. He could hear Ice's laughter as he sent his plane diving through a cloud only to reappear moments later from a different cloud. Pulling the stick to him, Ice twirled upwards around the vertical axis before sending his plane arching backwards into the clouds. There was a brief moment when only Viper's Corsair flew above the clouds, but soon Ice rejoined him and levelled alongside his commander. Inside his aircraft, Ice grinned from ear to ear. It was good to be back in the air again! Having his tail feathers nailed to the ground was not fun and every time he heard those engines start, Ice's spirit withered in the knowledge that his squadron was flying without him. Injuries had to heal though, and that took time. It had been nearly two months, (eight weeks and three days by Ice's exact calculations) since his reluctant swim in the ocean. He had managed to eject from the aircraft, but something had to have gone wrong beforehand for the moment Ice was in the water, he was unconscious. Perhaps it was taking that round in his side that had injured him so and perhaps something else, but Ice couldn't readily recall as the moment he ejected, his memory was a complete blank. Everyone had been worried about him, even Maverick, who had temporarily taken over Ice's duties. The other pilots feared the worst for Ice's mental state, as he had spent the first few nights at the hospital drenched in sweat as he relived that terrifying moment when the Zero dived on him. The other pilots did their best to keep Ice's spirits up, but he prefered keeping his own company, an action which only reaffirmed their fears and deepened their grief. Ice was too good of a pilot to lose. But they should not have given up on him so easily, for when Ice wanted to be alone, he went over to the Corsairs and paced around them. The moment he found out which plane he was to fly, Ice inspected every inch of it, making sure that nothing was amiss. Only Viper saw Ice mingling with his plane, wooing her with his gentle voice and encouraging his own spirit to let go of his fears. Viper knew that Ice was ready to be put into the air because the longer they waited, the more he risked Ice's courage failing him. The bandage had to be removed. Ice needed to soar again and with each roll, ascent, dive, and loop, Iceman's heart raced with excitement. The energy coursed through his veins like a mighty river, daring him to take on new challenges, though, every single one of them was isolated to dodging a cloud or two; or in most cases, simply smashing right through them. His mirth was doubled when he put the Corsair into another loop, but just after he crested, he shifted the stick over, causing his plane to rotate on its lateral axis until Ice was upright again where he then pulled the stick back towards him, bringing the Corsair out of the dive and allowing him to fly level. \"All right, Kazansky, time to quit showing off,\" said Viper with a touch of amusement. \"I can hear you smiling through the radio. We need to get you back to base before your show-boating burns up all your fuel.\" Ice chuckled and replied, \"Copy that, Viper. We'll return to...\" His words trailed off as his eyes fixed above him on four dots that were steadily growing bigger. The realization was instantaneous and a knot of sudden fear dropped into Ice's cold stomach. \"Viper, we've got a problem! Japs!\" \"What? How many?\" \"Four! Shit, I don't know if they've seen us!\" \"Stay calm, Iceman,\" said Viper instinctively. \"We'll drop below the clouds and head back to base. With any luck, they won't have spotted us yet. I'd like to keep it that way.\" \"I'm with you on that, Sir,\" replied Ice nervously as he put the nose forward and dropped with Viper into the shelter of the clouds. It was always like this in the South Pacific; one moment he'd be enjoying the flight and the next, hoping to make it back to the base alive.

Still, he secretly hated himself for the tacit connection between Maverick and the dreams he'd been having lately. You know the kind - the ones that come on like a sudden storm, leaving you to place a box of Kleenex and a bottle of lotion on your bedside table and batten down the hatches. Private self-loathing was nothing new to Iceman. / Maverick was a slut in name only. Really, what he craved in the deep recesses of his gut was the emotional connection his absent father and distant mother had been ill-equipped to provide. He knew better than to think that Charlie was anything but filler, anything but white noise to pacify his libido. She had big dreams that almost certainly did not involve him - or anyone other than herself, for that matter. / \"Keep your hand out of the cookie jar.\" That was Slider's pearl of wisdom on the subject of Maverick. And Iceman agreed, not being someone who practiced self-control loosely. He carefully crafted an external image that was sure to not match the one in his head, and reveled in the suffering this caused him. None of this is to imply he wasn't happy. He was happy on a pathological level, where perfectionism meets obsession. Iceman worked his kinks out in his flying, and that was good enough for him. / Maverick had no self-control. The idea of purposefully denying yourself the good in the world was, to him, prima facie absurd. He had a life to live. The Iceman situation was a little trickier, because for all of his macho posturing, Maverick was wary of being the dolphin caught in that particular tuna net. He intercepted looks from Goose - what are you doing, Mav? - and made drunken, overly sincere promises not to go down that road.

Well I guess I should start at the beginning. My name was Emilie Davies I first met Billy and the rest of the regulators, including Dick, when I was just 17. They weren't known as the regulators back then and John Tunstall well he was still alive and fine. I turned up at John's door one morning after having met him in Lincoln I had told him I had no parents and when he asked if I knew or had anything to do with Murphy and his men, I told him no and he invited me to join him and the rest of the guys so that's just what I did. I got on well with all of them but Billy he seemed weary of me and constantly on edge when I was in the same area. When Murphy showed up one day before the New Year Billy hid in a type of chicken den. John stood in front facing Murphy not showing any kind of fear. Chavez, Dick, Doc, Steve, Charlie and me stood about a pace behind him just staring at that idiot on horseback. \"I do believe you have some of my property.\" Murphy first said to John. \"I can assure you I do not have any of your property…\" John replied slowly and calmly \"Yes you do. Her\" Murphy said this whilst pointing straight at me with a gloved finger. Now that everyone was staring at me with wide and angry eyes I felt uncomfortable and needing to explain myself. Instead I knocked the idiot on his arse and pulled a gun on him this shocked people even more but no one aimed a gun at me. \"For starters what kind of woman carries a gun and secondly what kind of person pulls one on their Father!\" \"And why don't you leave me alone to get on with my life?\" \"Well I found a man for you to marry! You can get on with your life with him by your side.\" \"You can shove your match up your ugly arse until it picks your nose. I am not going anywhere.\" Without another word spoken I aimed my gun at a tree behind me without looking and fired. I could have sworn for a moment that the Murphy boys had shit themselves when a headless bird fell from the tree. I let my Dad get up back onto his horse and watched him ride away with the rest of them. I turned around chuckling to myself only to be faced with 6 guns each with an angry face behind them. Dick was the first to speak \"You lied to us. About everything. \" \"A woman doesn't choose her father!\" I snapped back quickly. I half expected John to interrupt with a logical idea that would suit all of us but he didn't I felt as if I had let him down but I had only been there a week. They gave me 3 canteens of water, 2 bread loaves, 2 guns and a horse they told me to leave and never return to them. If I had followed those orders Billy would have died long before he should have done.[Chapter 2] I had read in the papers John Tunstall had been killed. I felt pain, anger and hatred inside me and swore I would find a way to dispose of the Bastard claiming to be my Dad, or I would find the guys and get help in doing so. At first that was a completely mad idea. I walked into a bar and found Billy whistling a tune of some sort and a bounty hunter with one bullet in his gun, and Billy for the first time beginning to panic as his gun wasn't firing either so I saw it my place to put a bullet through the Bounty hunter's head, the looks I was given when I began to laugh for no apparent reason where fairly amusing. \"I thought we told you never to return!\" Billy threw his words at me in anger. \"Technically I didn't return. And if you class this as returning I'm sure as hell that you are pleased to see me considering I just saved your ass!\" \"Right if you're so sure you're coming with us! But I'm taking no chances so give me the guns and the knife and we'll tie your hands.\" Well at least it's better than having to face Murphy on my own wasn't it? That night it appears they trusted me to make sure no one found us so I had to stay up whilst tied to a horse and unarmed, well that night someone did come. I got hold of a gun and a knife I cut the rope killed the man , stole his hat and when the regulators finally got to me I was sat cross legged with my knife and all my guns with me wearing a hat that I really quite liked! I had finally gained their trust and didn't get my hands tied together by them again.[Chapter 3] We made it to a small town that appeared safe and we all relaxed for a change. I decided to look out the window for a moment just through boredom and habit of being on watch, but I'm glad I did as I turned up Lawrence Murphy was approaching and quickly! I ran up the stairs to the room I last saw Billy and barged in. Big mistake, I mean a mistake the size of Old Mexico! If he had his guns I would have been dead within a split second. Doc was sat with his feet resting on the side of a tub and Billy was stood up dripping wet and naked. \"Boys we have company!\" I didn't know whether to laugh and be shot when he found his guns or to puke and be mocked for the rest of my days! I soon left without doing either thankfully. \"Great so now I can't even take a pissing bath without that son of a bitch showing up!\" I heard his words before I saw him, fully clothed this time I am glad to say. It didn't take long to get out of there and away before we even came into Murphy's sites. Next stop was the home of Alex McSween's he was a friend of ours and a lawyer but we didn't mind him. He welcomed us in and we thought we were safe this time. When the sound of a gunshot being let off we went to the window, Murphy again! \"We seriously need to get a restraining order against this bloke!\" I heard a voice say from behind me. Then I realised something about Billy now standing next to me, he wasn't jumpy or on edge when I was around. Seeing our faces at the window the Murphy Bastards open fired on us. It was narrow but none of us were harmed. One by one we all shouted \"Jesus!\" Now the firing had stopped I was on the left side of the window and Billy on the right side I mouthed to him \"What the hell do we do know?\" \"How am I meant to know? Hang on… Hey Peppin!\" \"Yeah I'm here!\" a very manly voice returned. \"I see you got Charlie Crawford down there with ya!\" \"Yeah we got a whole lot of 'em!\" Before I could ask what he doing, Billy stood up took aim and killed the man who I believe he was asking about. \"Hey Peppin?! Charlie Crawford ain't with ya anymore!\" Followed by a laugh that made me also laugh. Peppin was obviously pissed off at this point as found out when he shouted at the top of his lungs \"Bastard! FIRE!\" \"Shit!\" a woman's voice, which I found to be my own, retaliated. We somehow made our way upstairs and stayed it was getting late and we were tired you didn't have to know us at all to realize that. We all got some sleep. Chavez was the first to awake the next morning but it wasn't long before the rest of us followed. My neck ached slightly I had probably just fallen asleep in and awkward position it would wear off in time. I could have then swore I heard horses and I mean more than 15. I'm talking at least 25 probably a lot more. Billy and I once again shuffled to the nearest window. It was horses. And the army was mounted on them. Doc, seeing this made and obvious point in saying \"Billy I know we're good but this is getting ridiculous.\" He was stood behind us so I knew Billy had heard him but didn't respond in anyway. He looked at me and I looked straight back at him. This time to make sure we heard him Doc got straight in our faces and asked what the odds on us surviving were. Billy didn't answer so I did \"around 75/6?\" I looked back to Billy who was still just looking at me. It was unplanned but when I looked back at him we then faced the window and at the same time said \"I like those odds.\" Followed shortly with another set of laughter. \"Jesus, you're just as mad as each other!\" Scurlock said whilst still stood behind us. I still couldn't stop laughing. Maybe the rumours of me being just as mad and fearless as Billy the Kid were true? No way. Not possible. I looked back to Billy and from the gleam in his eye I knew he had an idea. He jumped into a box and we threw him out of the window. It would take a miracle for us all to get away from this. Billy burst from the box and began shooting Chavez then arrived with some horses. We had done it! Unfortunately it had cost the lives of Steve, Charlie and Alex. Billy turned round and the last words I heard from him were \"Reap it Murphy! You son of a bitch!\" then firing one shot at Murphy right between the eyes. ","Summary":" Where should I start?

Disclaimer on the idea, too!

In the background she could hear her mother yelling at someone, and then returned to the conversation she'd been having with her daughter. \"We're getting visited by three food critics on Friday, remember?\" \"Yes, Mom, I promise I won't be late,\" Aira muttered, snapping her cell phone shut without so much as a goodbye, stuffing it into her cluttered purse. Rolling her eyes at her mother's nagging, she got into line, shifting from one foot to the other. The hazel-eyed young woman was exhausted after a long day at work, and was really looking forward to relaxing for the rest of the evening. Maybe she would treat herself to a night sitting on the couch listening to quiet music while writing or drawing. The chances of that were looking pretty good, since her mother had more than enough people to run the restaurant. After paying the very grumpy, elderly cashier who'd taken forever putting her food in bags, she grabbed the two and headed out the doors into the cold night that belonged to the city that was owned by crime. Shifting her purse higher up on her shoulder, she braced herself against the icy November wind, wishing that she could afford a car and drive herself everywhere, instead of having to walk or take the bus. Her long, dark brown hair, which stopped halfway down her back, was in a pony tail this early Tuesday evening. Her light brown skin sprouted goose bumps as another gust of wind threatened to stop her in her tracks as she turned a corner and crossed a street with the bustling crowds that were made up of Gotham's citizens and those who did not reside in this city. As much as she loved her mother's restaurant, called the Aurora (short for Aurora Borealis), working as a waiter and a chef hadn't been her life dream. It had been her mother's. But it was a good job, and she got to spend time with her mother and she got to keep her lovely, yet small, apartment in a well-kept part of Gotham where you didn't have to worry about being butchered on your way home every single night, although you should always be careful, anywhere you are in Gotham. Turning another corner, she saw the familiar street sign that told her she was halfway home and sped up, wanting to get home, alive, as fast as she could, so she could sit back and relax. But something didn't feel right. Shivering, Aira looked behind her, an eyebrow rising in a quizzical manner when she noticed two men walking side by side toward her at a steady pace. Alarm bells rang though her head as she ducked through an alley. You're being paranoid, she chided, but that didn't quell the uneasiness within her. A rough hand grabbed her shoulder and yanked her backwards, sending her flying to the ground, her groceries spilling out of their flimsy plastic bags as the two, gruff looking men loomed over her with sneers on their faces. Dread seemed to weigh her down, keeping her from sprinting away to safety. \"No—\" \"Give us yer' m'ney and we won't hurt yuh' much,\" the shorter of the two said, grabbing the color of her thick, hoodless black coat and yanking her to her feet, slamming her into the wall of the alley while his accomplice began searching her pockets. \"HELP ME!\" she screamed, but all she got was a slap. \"Shut up, you stupid bi—\" \"LET GO OF ME!\" she shouted, and received a punch to the gut. So much for the relaxing evening. She slumped to the ground, the wind knocked out of her as she tried to crawl away, and a kick was sent into her ribs, and she let out a scream of pain. Was she going to die here, in this alley, at the hands of these two men? \"Now, is that any way to treat a lady?\" The two men directed their attention to a shadow a few feet away. There was a gun shot, a flash of red, and Aira found herself falling, quaking with fear as the one of the men lay dead and the other cursing at his assailant, her savior. \"We-we weren't doin' no nothin'!\" he shouted. \"L-l-leave us a-alone!\" \"Now, why would I do that?\" the man, still in shadows, leaned over the thug. \"P-please—\" \"Get out of here before I decide to blow your brains out.\" Not needing any more urging, the thug began to scramble away, but the shadowy man caught his arm, and Aira slapped a trembling hand over her mouth to cover a gasp when she heard a bone snap, and a scream rang out. \"Apologize to the girl.\" The thug spat in the twenty-one-year-old's direction, and she heard another crack, this one louder and harsher than the first, and the thug screeched in anguish. \"Apologize , now. \" The death threat in his voice told her that he was not kidding around, and he really did mean to kill the thug eventually if he did not coöperate. \"I-I'm sorry! I'm sorry!\" the man screamed, and she saw him being shoved out into the street. She stared after him as he disappeared from her line of vision and returned her vision to her savior. And now it was her turn to scream. Or try to, at least. Before the alarming noise could pass through her lips, a gloved hand clamped over her mouth, and she found herself looking up into the narrowed eyes of the Red Hood. She cowered before him as he stayed still, his eyes trained on her until he was certain she would not scream. He took a large step away from her, watching carefully, studying her, as she scrambled to collect her groceries, her hands still shaking. \"T-thank you,\" she said once she'd gathered all her things, still on the ground as she looked up at him. \"I-I-thank you.\" To her surprise, he helped her to her feet. He nodded. Aira knew who this was. He known as many things: murderer, crime lord, but savior ? Was that in the job description? Saying nothing, he turned away and disappeared into the night, leaving her stunned for only a moment, before she ran the rest of the way home. The Red Hood watched her as she left the alley, wondering what a girl like that was doing in a place like that. Obviously not looking for trouble, although it seemed as if trouble found her more often than it should. Saving people wasn't on his schedule, but he did make an exception here and there. And since trouble found her, and he was the basic definition, maybe he would see her again. Let me know what you thought! :)[Chapter 2] A/N: Hiya! Here's the second chapter! Hope ya like. I wrote this with the help of its lovely creator, and of course i wrote this while listening to... Sum 41, Rise Against, Three Days Grace, and Linkin Park. Yikes. No wonder i have a headache lol, enjoy the chapter, will update as soon as my brain decides to! remember to PM its lovely creator and thank her for the idea! Aira did find trouble that night, but it wasn't the Red Hood. As soon as she reached her apartment building, a sigh of relief escaping her lips as she sprinted towards the cement stairs that would take her to the parking garage, which led her to the entrance to the adjoined buildings. But as soon as she passed the first cement pillar, a sense of dread filled her, and relief was short lived as soon as she heard a sickeningly familiar voice. \"Oh, Aira,\" came the sing-song voice that could only belong to a good-looking, twenty-two-year-old named Carter Clearwater. Aira halted in her tracks, a painful wave of anger and fear swelled within her as she slowly turned around, careful to keep her distance as the built, 5\"10 man leaned against the pillar, his eyes roaming over her shamelessly. How she wanted him to die right then and there. \"Leave me alone,\" she said, her voice holding more confidence than she really had. \"I've told you before.\" \"Aw, baby, you know I'm sorry,\" he cooed, pushing himself off the pillar and taking a large step towards her, his gray-green eyes twinkling with a malice only she and she alone knew about. She took a step backwards. \"Carter,\" she warned him, but with a wave of his hand her verbal warning was dismissed. \"Leave me alone, I mean it.\" \"Aw,\" he gave her his best pouting face, the face he always gave her when he said he was sorry. Just because he said he was sorry for what he'd done didn't mean that he really was. And Aira was doing her best the satisfaction of winning her over again, to let her fall into the role of the victim she'd been avoiding for well over six months. It had only been six, and he hadn't left her alone since she'd packed up and moved out of his place. She was still too scared to go back and retrieve the belongings she hadn't had the chance to collect once she'd made a run for it. \"Can't you give me a break, sweetie?\" \"Nicknames and smiles won't get you anywhere,\" she snarled. \"Oh, we'll see,\" he said, glancing around at the sound of a car approaching, disappearing into the shadows, \"we'll see, Aira.\" Shuddering, Aira fled and in moments found herself in her apartment, pressed up against the door, panting heavily. Dropping her bags to the floor, she went over to the phone and picked it up, her finger hovering over the 9 , but then sighed, hanging her head. The police would never believe her. Carter would lie to them as he had always lie to him, making her look like the bad person in all of this. Slamming it down, she shuffled her feet across the hardwood floor and picked up her groceries and headed to the kitchen and slowly began putting everything away. When she was done, she went right over to her small, black leather couch and plopped herself down. Having no need for light, she left them off, and let her body get into its much needed lazy state. Seeing the TV remote on the floor beneath her, she picked it up and absent-mindedly tossed it across the room. In the far recesses of her mind she heard a book getting knocked over, but couldn't bring herself to care as she rolled over onto her stomach and buried her face into the cool leather, allowing her body to grow limp. What a night. First, those thugs tried to rob her, then, the Red Hood had to be the one to save her, and to top it all off, Carter had managed to talk to her before she could make it inside. Groaning into the materia, she weakly punched the couch. Why did the Red hood have to be the one? It would have been lying if she'd said she wasn't thankful, but just the mere fact that he was a murdering crime lord scared her almost as much as Carter did. Carter. Oh, boy, this was getting worse and worse with each passing day. Carter Clearwater, with his perfect sandy hair and his porcelain skin, was still trying to get back together with her. And she didn't want to be in a relationship with him, again . It had been too much to bear, and that was why she had left the first three times. The last time, her mother had found out about him, and had ordered her daughter to move out. Gladly, she obliged, but not before Carter could make some points clear first. Shuddering at the memory of the physical pain that she hadn't felt in six months, she sat up slowly and took off her shoes, pulling her legs to her chest as she laid down on her side, her cheek pressed up against cool leather once again. The phone rang from the entrance hall and Aira groaned. Getting up, she padded over to the device that was causing her headache and picked it up. \"Hello?\" \"Aira?\" \"Oh, hey Mom.\" Aira hoped she wouldn't ask her to come in again. Cassandra always asked her to help out at the Aurora, even when she didn't really need it. \"Are you alright, honey?\" \"Fine.\" \"Did you run into Carter again?\" \"No.\" The lie slipped out quickly: it was a reflex she had to work on, but it hadn't gone away. She still felt like she had to lie every time Carter came around, for fear of her health and what Carter would do to her if someone really did believe her. \"Well...\" her tone was disbelieving, but she didn't push it. \"I'll see you soon, okay hon?\" \"Right.\" Aira slammed the phone down harder than intended and stomped back over to the couch. Hiding behind her hands, she wailed in frustration. The ability that Carter had to control her life when he wasn't even supposed to be in it made her feel helpless and worthless, just as she had been when she had still dealt with the bruises, the pain, the long sleeves, and lies she'd put up with since high school. And now he wasn't even living in her house. All of this begging that he did, all of these apologies that she knew meant nothing to him, usually got her to come back to him, to get her to move in with him, but then bruises would return, and she would flee. Her mother had made sure that the last time she had been with him would really be the last time . No one could help her. Nothing could. And who would want to? Only whispers and lies awaited her down at the police station when she had tried explaining to them what he had been doing for her for the past few years, but of course they hadn't believed her, of course they hadn't cared. Feeling defeated, she laid down, shutting her eyes tight. Was there anyone who could help her? Please leave a review! more of a filler chapter, in my opinion, but meh. Thanks for reading![Chapter 3] YAY! THIS IS BEING UPDATED! Apologies to everyone. I want to thank you all for keeping with this story. Please review! And thank you for reading. Jason stood outside the Aurora, trying to decide what he was going to do. He was sick and tired of eating crappy canned food, hiding away in one of his apartments, waiting for night to come so he could get on with his life. Being a murderer-slash-antihero-slash-vigilante was bad enough when the only time you could come out and do what needed to be done was at night. And standing in front of his fancy, well-received restaurant as they day went on (as tired as he was), something occurred to him. Every murderer-slash-antihero-slash-vigilante deserved a meal, even if they were near sleep walking. And he wanted a good meal. Jason walked in, and nearly smiled at the dim interior. It gave off the impression of a fancy-schmancy restaurant, private and quiet, with nice music playing from the speakers near the front window where he had been standing by. After saving that girl last night - he didn't even know her name - and beating up those thugs, and attending to his usual crime-lord duties, he was ready for something yummy. Possibly soup. He looked around for a moment before he saw a familiar face coming his way in a waitress' dress - black and white, short skirt, shot-sleeved, with a vest, with shiny black shoes - with her hair done up somewhat nicely, but a tremble in her hands that she kept clasped in front of her as she stopped in front of her, her eyes examining him for a moment before a smile broke across her lips. Jason knew it to be a fake smile, but it had a hint if sincerity in it, one that made him smirk right back at her. This caught her off guard. And that was slightly amusing to see. \"Right this way, sir,\" she said, blinking, trying to recover from his smirk. After a moment of studying her as she had studied him, he knew exactly who she was. He'd saved he last night. And she didn't even know it. She looked alright, though, a little shaken. She should be fine, he thought as he followed her, weaving in between tables, getting no strange looks from any strangers - a relief. She directed him to a small table, and he sat down, still smirking at her. Her brow furrowed for a second before smoothing out. But something was off about her. She seemed a bit off, nervous almost. He didn't miss it when her eyes darted away from her customer, all around the restaurant His vague amusement disappeared, and his smirk softened into a straight line. Something was definitely wrong. His eyes fell to the silver name tag that was pinned to her black vest. Aira. Well, at least he had a first name now. \"Would you like anything to drink, sir - and would you like some bread-sticks or chips for your wait?\" she asked, her voice wobbling for a moment before returning to normal. Or, what he assumed what was normal for her. \"Just water, please, and some bread-sticks would be great\" he said, picking up the menu and examining the cover. \"I'll be just a moment,\" she murmured, and she turned on her heel and left. As soon as he suspected he would not see her, his eyes left the menu and followed her into the swinging double doors that led into the kitchen. He shook his head, and returned his attention to the menu. Who knew what could possibly have her on edge? This was Gotham. Everyone had a reason to be on edge. He told himself it didn't concern him: he'd saved her, she'd thanked him - end of story. And she didn't even know who she was serving. A few moments later, the waitress, Aira, came back, and set down a glass and pitcher of water, along with a basket of steaming, seasoned, great-smelling bread sticks Oh, this was so worth losing sleep over. \"Are you ready to order?\" she asked him, pulling a pad of paper out of her vest's breast pocket and whipped out a pen from behind her ear, and clicked it. \"Yeah, actually, I wanted...\" he held up the menu and pointed to whatever the hell was at the bottom of the list. It was some sort of fancy sandwich and it sounded good, whatever it was. \"Oh! Of course!\" A small, genuine smile appeared on her face, as she jotted it down, obviously not needing to look at it twice. \"Good choice, sir - it's one of the best meals here!\" He allowed himself to smirk back at her - just a little - as she put away her pad and pen. \"I'll get this to you as soon as I can!\" she said, her present mood brightening as she turned left, in less of a hurry this time, but he didn't mind. He was about to turn to the scrumptious-looking bread when he heard a woman's weary voice call out from near the front doors, \"Aira! Visitor!\" Jason's eyes shot up and followed the woman named Aira - whose mood had changed drastically because of two spoken words (which was alarming) - slowly made her way over to the hostess (who had been oddly absent when he had arrived). The hostess looked older, sisterly towards the younger waitress. He could read the worry on the older woman's face and the fear on the younger one's. His interest was peaked. After exchanging a few words, Aira made her way to the front doors, meeting a guy that seemed about her age. He was handsome, tall, but he didn't seem all that strong. Jason watched as the guy smirked - in a mean way, not like how he had - down at the girl, and for some reason felt a swell of concern when she shrank away from him, and the hostess behind her stepped away from the couple she was attending to to step forward, sort of guarding the smaller one. The guy who was speaking to Aira frowned at her, and then something menacing and vile flashed across his features for a brief moment before turning on his heel and exiting the restaurant. Aira merely stared after him, mouth hanging open, and he figured that he was someone she knew very well. He was about to turn away from this odd scene that no one else seemed to see but the staff, who had all paused to look at her, but now were going back to their duties, when her hands flew over her mouth and she disappeared from sight. Jason was perplexed as he turned to his bread. What had that been about?[Chapter 4] Hey there! Thanks for all the views, reviews, favorites, and follows! Makes me so happy! But this is all thanks to Midenigufutsu koyote! If it weren't for her idea and OC this story wouldn't have been written! Anyways, how about another chappie, hmm? Aira was in what her mother had dubbed \"the staff room\". It was filled with extra dining-room chairs and tables that were either stacked upon one another carefully or were precariously sitting in a tower that screamed unsteadiness. When one entered the kitchen, which was straight ahead, there was a narrow, short hall to the left, with a creaky, wooden door that didn't match the rest of the Aurora's polished-slash-old-fashioned-slash-modern-slash-something-else decor. It had been - or rather, still was - a storage room, but it was more like a break room for employees who didn't go outside in the alley and smoke. Although layers of dust covered the extra furniture, cobwebs hung lifelessly - spiders having long abandoned them, apparently - from the high ceiling, more so from the support beams than the corners. The kitchen was bright, alive, and filled with people who were shouting, laughing, joking, talking, and humming while they did their part to make the Aurora as successful (both with the media and its customers) as it was, and compared to this dark, dusty, silent room, it was would appear to be abandoned. But after long shifts of taking orders (specific or not), carrying platters of food, dishes, and drinks - and also having to deal with every kind of customer imaginable - employees would take back food from the kitchen (the leftovers that weren't being used) and find some place to settle down for their break, until they had to go out and slap on a smile. Aira was sitting on a table, her legs dangling idly above the creaking wooden floor, her head in her hands with her elbows resting on her knees, trying to calm herself down. Her eyes were clenched shut, her teeth were grinding together, and her heartbeat was loud in her ears. Her stomach had twisted itself in knots in result of the feelings she was experiencing. It made her angry - at him, at herself, for being this emotional. What Carter had done, what he was doing - it was so unfair . Work was probably one of the only places she would ever really love being at. For the most part, the customers were decent human beings towards her and her mother was here and she got along with her coworkers better than she would have thought (they all got along with each other, save for a select few), and she liked helping out in the kitchen. But Carter had to show up, didn't he? Aira sighed, pushing aside the childish urge to scream at the world for everything bad that had ever happened to anyone. She would never do that, even if she was alone, hiding in the staff room. It was kind of embarrassing, to be so scared of him. He couldn't do anything to her here, of all places. Right? He wouldn't try anything in public - where her mother was, right? Right? He'd said he was sorry, he had - and she was having trouble forcing herself not to forgive him - and she'd said nothing to him (how could she, with that hostess Jeanine standing next to her?), and he'd smirked at the fact that she could do only that: nothing . Now here she was, wallowing in self pity at the fact that life wasn't easy. Well, there was only one way to make it easy, but telling the cops would mean hell for her - and besides, who'd believe her? Aira sighed again, clearing her throat several times to make sure her voice wouldn't break if she went stepped out of the staff room. It wasn't even her break; she needed to get out there and attend to the customers - Aira shot off the table and headed for the door, remembering she still had to deliver that one man's food. And she didn't want to trouble anyone else, or get in trouble. Her troubles could wait. It wasn't like she could do anything about everything - right? Besides, someone else might be covering for her, she might be taking up someone else's breaks, she might get into trouble - Her worries were silenced for a split second when the door opened just as her shaky hands were about to grasp it. The force of the sudden movement sent her stumbling backwards, and she almost fell in a heap on the floor, but managed to keep her feet firmly planted on the ground. Straightening up, she found herself looking up at the older, taller, red-haired hostess Jeanine. Aira immediately grew nervous. \"I was just on my way out - \" she started, but the more angular woman cut her off with her words and a wave of her hand, her painted nails flashing in the dim light. \"Relax, Aira - you're fine,\" she sighed, and it took the younger woman a moment to realize that Jeanine, someone who had known her longer than she'd known her own mother, was looking down at her with concern. It was nice, but it wouldn't last. No one could help - Aira had to tell herself that more and more these days. Couldn't they see? No, she remembered, they couldn't - because they didn't. Ugh. \"Aira, I know it's none of my business,\" Jeanine said slowly, just as the twenty-one-year-old made an attempt to get past her, stopping her in her tracks with narrowed, hawk-like eyes. \"...but who was that young man?\" \"He's my... er...\" Aira faltered. How should she put it? Boyfriend? Abuser? Ex? He absolutely hated it when she referred to him as her ex - it drove him insane. The few times she'd broken up with him and told him he was her 'ex', she'd ended up regretting it for weeks . And whenever he wasn't around and she used that term - he seemed to know. He'd give her looks, hang around, give her enough apologies and smiles till she gave in and got back together with him. Jeanine continued to watch the smaller woman, patiently. With a sigh of defeat, she finally answered - but she wished with all her heart that her answer would contain the truth . \"It's nothing; don't worry about it.\" Aira managed to slip away, the door shutting noisily behind her, thankfully getting away - but she had missed the look of suspicion that had crossed the older woman's features. Aira headed into the kitchen, her mood somehow improving as several people - people who spent about 99% of their shifts standing in the same room with the same people - waved and grinned at her, a few called out their greetings while they did their part around the huge kitchen. Her mother was nowhere in sight - her mother rarely ever got into the kitchen anymore, being the owner and all sort of distracted her from what she loved to do most, but when she did, it just made the atmosphere all the more lighter - which was a relief. She would know there was something up with Aira or not - and she didn't need Cassandra noticing anything today. Sweeping up a tray from a pile on the counter next to bowls, glasses, plates, and dainty little dishes, she looked around until she saw one of the chefs - Celia, if she remembered correctly - waved at her, a huge grin plastered on her face. Aira walked over to her, tray ready, and tried to smile genuinely at the frizzy-haired girl, whose hair was pushed back and tied several times in order not to get hair in the food (not that it ever happened). Celia had just started working at the Aurora, but she was one of the best chefs in the area. She was also one of the nicest of the best chefs in the area. It was like she made a genuine effort to smile and wave and say hello to everyone - her bubbling personality made the other girl able to push her distracting, hopeless thoughts to the back of her mind, where she hoped they would stay till she was safe at home on the couch. \"Hey, Aira,\" she chirped, and set a bowl of whatever the hell it was called onto the tray in a carefree manner that would have made any other waitress or waiter snap at her for being so careless with the food. Aira, however, was used to collecting her meals from this girl - who seemed to connect with everyone she spoke to - and it was nice. \"How's it going?\" \"Good,\" she replied, a little uneasily, which didn't go unnoticed by the other girl as she set a small pitcher of water on it. \"You sure?\" she asked as Aira double-checked that she had everything that man had asked for. \"Um, yeah - don't worry about it,\" she said too quickly. Before the brilliant chef could ask anything else, however, Aira turned and walked as quickly and carefully as she could out the swinging doors, heading towards her customer while a distinct feeling of dread settled itself on her shoulders. This was going to be a difficult shift. Review?[Chapter 5] Sorry it's been so long! Here i am! (Sorry dont yell at me plze!) This is a rather filler-chappie, and I apologize (not really...), but I promise things will start moving along soon! Thanks so much for the follows, the favorites, the reviews - for reading! Cheers, yeah? Jason hadn't really been that concerned about the people who were working for him. In all honesty, he thought that ones he'd scared into working with him all deserved to be thrown in jail - and worse, because the criminals and gangs and drug lords currently under his reign (Black Mask was getting more and more jealous, but for now he wasn't messing with the Red Hood's business, which was awesome, because he got sick and tired of the man's temper tantrums real fast ) had done worse than he had (killed people, controlled criminals, beat people up, blow things up - the usual that the Red Hood did) and they all rightly deserved to go straight to hell without even being considered for the possibility of going to heaven (though he wasn't quite sure if that existed, but the whole idea of them needing to go to hell was true ). He was in his dingy, dark, silent apartment (one of them, anyway; this one was the dump of the lot that he owned throughout the city, because you could never have just one safe location when half the city wanted you behind bars and the other half wanted you dead while a select few just thought of him as nuisance, or a savior, just a pain in the ass that needed to get high-fived - in the face - with a chair or something like that), sitting on the couch, with his head in his hands. Dawn was nearing, and he was damn near dead on his feet with exhaustion, because, despite what certain people might think, being a crime lord was not the easiest job in the world (but it had it's moments - and besides, pissing people off by blowing things off always worked as a good stress reliever, though Bruce and Dick had never really approved of that method). In fact, all he wanted to do was sleep for another year and then wake up to everything being a bit easier to deal with. Because ever since he'd decided to go around Gotham as the Red Hood, he always ended up dead on his feet. He sighed, dragging his hands across his face as he leaned back into the old, musky (probably untrustworthy) fabric of the couch (he'd actually paid some junkie for this couch, because stealing a couch was not something the Red Hood, or Jason Todd, would ever do, though setting one on fire might be just for the hell of it), his head tilted towards the ceiling. His eyes were closed, and his eyelids were heavy, but suddenly he wasn't all that sleep. It took him a moment that he was bored . Bored of scaring the citizens of Gotham. Bored of scaring people for working for him. Bored of spying on Black Mask and messing up his deals. Bored, bored, bored . Jason had never been this bored in his entire life. Crime wasn't supposed to be boring (though superhero-work could be, but he'd never been that bored doing that while he'd been Robin, because he was either getting lectured because he hit a guy too hard or focusing on becoming a better Robin than Dick had been). It was supposed to be thrilling. It was supposed to get the adrenaline rushing through his system - but for some reason, he was bored of it all for the moment. It made him think. Maybe he could start making dusk and dawn appearances around the city, or maybe he could even make a daytime appearance just to remind the Gothamites that they weren't safe from him in the daytime (whereas they thought they were, and at night was when all the smart people stayed close to the good neighborhoods and tried to avoid dark alleys and shady-looking people), but then he quickly dismissed that idea (someone else could probably do that for him), because during they day he slept like a rock and he liked getting six to ten hours of sleep (if he was even that lucky) on weekdays (weekends were more fun because more people went out on the weekends, which meant more chances for crime to strike). Well... ... maybe he could pull a bigger stunt than stealing cars, blowing things up, scaring people, killing people - the usual. In fact, he realized, as he sat up, feeling a bit more alert than before (but still dead tired). He was smirking now, and his eyes were open. He wondered, almost frantically, what he could do that would pass off as a bigger stunt. Control the city? He frowned for a moment. No, that'd be too hard. And besides, he didn't know anyone who would even want to bother with the entire hell hole that was Gotham (besides Black Mask, but if he needed his ego inflated to the point where 'he owned all of Gotham once' than he probably had serious issues and, even Jason would love to shove something like that in Black Mask's face, he'd probably fail and Bruce would probably win and then Dick would probably drop a typical big-brother comment that he really didn't want to hear, so he scratched that off the list of possibilities). Could he kill a shit-ton of people? He shook his head silently, sighing heavily. No, that wouldn't do anything but piss everyone under the sun off. He was bored , not looking for the entire universe to come after him and kick his ass for mindlessly massacring a bunch of people - the Joker could do that without a problem, and he wasn't the Joker, so, yeah ). Well... what else was there? He certainly wasn't going to turn into a good guy , because being like Batman had its limits and those limits restrained him from doing what he wanted and that wasn't exactly even an option, so... Jason sat back again, and stared up at the ceiling, his mind churning with ideas. When he found the perfect stunt to pull (havoc to wreak, disaster to spread - whatever you want to call it), he would put it into action immediately. And then, the fun would begin. But for now, Jason was stuck with brainstorming. For now. ","Summary":" DISCLAIMER! Disclaimer on the idea, too! Midenigugtsu koyote requested that I write a story (severa"},{"Movie":"Batman: Under the Red Hood","Title":"It's About Time","Author":"Country Batgirl","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12253872","Passage":"[Chapter 1] (Melissa's POV) I ran down the street, into an alley, and quickly climbed the fire escape on a Gotham building. I quickly started jumping from roof to roof. My 16-year-old self was quite fast. Eventually I arrived at the the not-so-abandoned building I was staying at. I stepped in, and walked around the guys. I'm in a gang. I know what you're thinking, 'What on earth is a 16-year-old girl doing in a gang?' The answer is simple, when I was 9, it was the only way I could have a roof over my head. *flash back* The man had just walked out of the building. I followed him for half a block, before I ran at him, reached into his pocket, took his wallet, and ran off. \"Hey! That's mine!\" He yelled, as he chased me. I ran down an alley, and into an abandoned building. I stopped to catch my breath, when I heard a slow clap. I looked up to see a boy, around the age of 17. \"Wow. I'm impressed,\" he said. \"Would you like to join my gang? You can steal money for us. You can stay here, and we'll feed you.\" It took me almost no time to agree. The boy smiled, and said, \"You can come out now boys.\" I looked around at all the 16-17 year old boys that stepped out. However, one specific boy caught my attention. He looked like he was my age. He had red hair, and was much shorter than the rest of the boys. \"Hi, I'm Melissa,\" I said to all of them, but I was looking at the red head. \"Hi Melissa. My name is Jason,\" the younger boy replied. *end of flashback* He was actually one year older than me. I became really close to him. He was my best friend. After about a month, the other boys started to hit me. Jason always promised he would get me out of here. Two years after that, he left, got adopted by some rich dude, and forgot about me. He died not too long ago. He deserved it for abandoning me. I gave all the money I stole to Josh, our leader. I turned around, and started to walk away. \"200 bucks? That's it?\" He asked, angrily. I turned around to face him, and said through my gritted teeth, \"It's Gotham. Not many people walk around with cash. Plus, it's December. People are broke from buying presents.\" He took a step toward me, and back-handed me across the face. \"Don't give me that attitude, Mel! I want more money. Tomorrow, I expect twice as much as you got today!\" He spat in my face. I nodded, and walked to my room. After they thought I couldn't hear them, they started whispering to each other. \"Why is she still even here? We should put her ungrateful butt back out on the streets. She won't last 5 minutes out there,\" said Brad. They all know that's not true. They all sit on their lazy butts all day, getting drunk. I'm the one going out there in the cold, stealing money all day. If it wasn't for the fact that I need a place to sleep, I would've been out of here ages ago. I sighed, and laid down in my bed, and was trying to go to sleep, when I heard gunshots. I grabbed the gun I stole from Josh when he was drunk, from underneath my pillow. I walked the direction of the gun shots. I peaked around the corner, and saw a man in a red helmet shooting my gang. It's the Red Hood! He's been taking over and/or killing off gangs lately. I aimed my gun at him, and fired. Why am I helping these guys? Because if Red here kills them all, he'll take this building, and will probably kill me, or kick me out. The shot I fired hit him right in the chest. I got excited until he turned to look at me, and I saw his costume was bulletproof. He turned back to Brad, and broke his neck, leaving only me left. He started walking towards me. I started backing up, and repeatedly shooting at him. My hands were shaking though, making it incredibly hard to aim. I finally ran out of ammunition. Red kept walking towards me. I backed into a wall. I felt a tear go down my cheek. Well, there goes my last ounce of dignity. He noticed, and almost immediately put his hands up and said, \"I'm not going to hurt you, Mel.\" \"How do you know my name?\" I asked. His hands went up to his helmet, and removed it. I looked into his eyes, and felt so many emotions go through me. Happiness that he was alive, anger that he left me, sadness for the memories he reminds me of, stupidity for not figuring it out sooner, humiliation for crying in front of him. You name it, I was feeling it. \"Jason?\" I asked with tears in my eyes. -/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/- A/N: So, how was the chapter? Good? Bad? Great? Awful? Let me know in the comments. Also, check out my other stories. I'm still new to this, so I need to know how I'm doing. Don't be afraid of telling me you don't like it. Just make sure to explain why, so I can fix it. Thank you for your time! God Bless![Chapter 2] (Mel's POV) \"Jason?\" I asked, tears in my eyes. \"Hey Mel,\" he said. I just stared at him, in disbelief. All at once, I felt all of my anger toward him come back to me. I curled my hands into fists, and with all of my might, I hit him in the jaw. His head swung to the right with the collision. \"Why did you leave me?\" I screamed at him. He looked at me with hurt in his eyes. \"I'm sorry,\" he whispered. \"You're sorry?\" I yelled. \"You promised me you would get me out of this terrible place! It didn't bother you one bit that I was getting hit every single day, did it? All you cared about was yourself! How was it being a spoiled little rich kid? Must've been nice. I didn't get that experience. Y'know, when you promised me you would get me out of here, I believed you. When I was about fourteen years old, I finally realized, you weren't coming back. You were too busy eating seven course meals, while I'm lucky to get one meal a day. Gosh, I was stupid. And you know wha-\" I wanted to continue, but I was suddenly interrupted by him wrapping his arms around me. \"I'm so sorry Mel. I'm so sorry,\" he whispered, as I cried into him. \"I hate you,\" I whispered through tears. \"I know. I'm so sorry. I'm going to try to make things better,\" he said. I pushed myself off of him, and glared at him. \"How?\" I asked. \"I've got an apartment. We'll go there, and I'll explain everything,\" he said, grabbing my arm, and pulling me gently. I followed him as he lead me to the roof. \"How are you at parkour?\" \"Where's the building?\" I asked. He raised an eyebrow at me, and said, \"Warehouse 4 at the Gotham docks.\" \"Got it. Eat my dust,\" I said, as I ran, and leaped from building to building. \"Hey!\" He yelled. I could hear him running behind me. \"Let's go slow poke!\" I yelled behind me. I could hear him laughing behind me. I smiled and kept running, and jumping. After about ten minutes, I came to a gap between 2 buildings that was too wide to jump across. I looked to my left and to my right, and didn't see a way to go around it. I'll have to go backwards. At that moment, Jason jumped onto the same building as me, and asked, \"Why did you stop?\" \"I can't jump across. We'll have to go backwards,\" I said, as I went to go run off the end I just came from. Before I could get to the edge Jason grabbed my arm. \"What are you doing?\" I asked. \"Get on my back, and hold on,\" he commanded. \"Why?\" I asked. \"Just do it,\" he said, turning around so I could hop on his back. \"I see they didn't teach you how to say please while you were away,\" I mumbled as I got on his back. I could almost hear him roll his eyes, as he pulled out a weird looking gun. He ran, and jumped off the edge that was too wide to jump over. I squeezed my eyes shut, expecting to fall to my death. I opened my eyes when I realized I wasn't going to die. I looked up to see we were swinging from a grappling gun. After we landed on the next building, I slid off his back, slapped his shoulder, and exclaimed, \"You scared me!\" He laughed. I took this as an opportunity to continue running, and get ahead of Jason. \"Hey! We're going to do this again?\" I yelled after me, as I heard him running. \"Yup!\" I yelled, as I smiled while still running. Maybe Jason wasn't too bad… …Maybe… -/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/- A/N: So, I hate only having one chapter out, so here is the second chapter! I hope it didn't suck! I started on this yesterday, forgot about it, and finished it today. Oh, and just in case this is my last update before Christmas, MERRY CHRISTMAS! *Throws candy canes up in the air* *Throws out a Christmas tree* *screams jingle bells* I take Christmas very seriously. God Bless![Chapter 3] (Jason's P.O.V.) She ended up beating me to the warehouse. She always was fast. Once we were on the roof of the building, we walked through a door, and down some stairs, onto a balcony that overlooks the ground floor of the warehouse. I could see my men sitting a table, playing cards, obviously not prepared for intruders. They didn't even notice Mel and I walk in. After a few minutes of Mel giving me looks, one of my men finally realized our presence. \"Hey boss! When did you get here? And who's your lady friend?\" He asked. I rolled my eyes behind my helmet. I'll deal with this later. I looked at Mel, and gestured for her to follow me. I led her to the door of my upstairs apartment, and held the door open for her to walk in. (Mel's P.O.V.) I walked in, and turned to Jason. He closed the door, and removed his helmet and mask. \"No offense, but your men suck at their job,\" I said, honestly. \"I know. I plan to deal with it later. As of right now, do you wanna look around the place?\" He asked. I shrugged, and started walking around the apartment. I won't lie, it was pretty nice. I get my own spacious room. \"Hey, Mel! Are you hungry?\" Jason yelled just loud enough for me to hear in my room. \"Actually, yeah. I didn't eat much today,\" I said, as I walked into the kitchen. \"Okay then, what do you want?\" He asked, as he rolled up his sleeves, and washed his hands. I shrugged, and said, \"I don't care.\" When you grow up like I did, you tend to not be very picky on your next meal. Let me rephrase that. When you grow up like I did, you're lucky to have a next meal. Jason nodded, and pulled out a box of Mac & Cheese. I sat on the counter, as he prepared my meal. \"I could make that myself, y'know,\" I said. I'm not a big fan of people doing stuff for me. It never ends well. It's just the way I grew up. \"I know you can, but I wanna cook it for you,\" he said, stubbornly. I can't really make fun of him, because I'm usually just as stubborn as him. I just didn't feel like arguing with him right now. After he finished cooking the dish, he handed it to me in a bowl. I mumbled, \"Thanks.\" Then, I dug in, devouring the entire thing in minutes. Jason just gave me a weird look. I glared at him, until he stopped. I wasn't exactly taught table manners when I was younger. Once I finished, I stood up, and put my bowl in the sink. \"I think I'm gonna get some sleep,\" I said to Jason, as I walked towards my room. I walked into my room, and laid down on the bed. I was asleep in minutes. For the first time in a long time, I fell asleep, feeling happy and safe. /-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/ A/N: This chapter kind of a filler, and I apologize that it's been so long just for this. I've been REALLY busy. There's a lot going on in my life. Like A LOT. Anyways, if you haven't already, please like this story (and maybe some of my others?). If you have an opinion on this story, whether it be negative or positive, please tell it to me in a review. God Bless![Chapter 4] (Mel's P.O.V.) I rolled over in my bed, burying myself further into my nice, warm comforter. Wait, my blanket isn't anywhere near this nice. I sat up immediately. My head swerved from side to side, frantically searching the mysterious room with my eyes. This isn't my room. Suddenly, the memories of the previous night flooded my brain. The gang. Red Hood. Jason. New home. I thought about the gang. I watched most of them die. They were murdered right in front of me. The people I shared a home with are gone, and yet, I feel nothing. Well, not nothing. I feel a bit of satisfaction knowing they're dead. Is that normal? Not that it matters. Normal was never really my thing. I yawned, and got out of bed. I went to my own personal bathroom, which is amazing by the way, and got in the shower. *30 minutes later* I walked out of my room, ready for whatever the day brought. I made my way to the kitchen to make myself some breakfast. As I pulled the eggs out of the fridge, I saw a note on the counter top. I picked it up. It read: Hey Mel. Sorry I wasn't there when you woke up, but to be fair, I didn't know if you would ever wake up. Anyways, I have a few things I need to do. I should be back sometime between 2 and 3. See ya! -Jason I wonder what he needed to do. I shrug it off. I'm sure, as the Red Hood, he's quite busy. I glance at the clock. 12:34? How long was I asleep?! Good thing I'm not with the gang anymore. They would have beaten the crap out of me if they had caught me sleeping like this. There I go thinking about the gang again… I quickly shook my head, ridding my mind of those thoughts. Elsa had it right. The past is in the past, Let it go. What? When that movie came out, EVERYONE was singing Let It Go. Including the every citizen of Gotham. I might not have seen the movie, but I know every word to that song. I started to hum the tune to the catchy song as I made my breakfast- well, I guess it's more of a lunch. I finished making my food, and carried my plate to the decent sized table. I sat down to start eating my food when the doorbell rang. I sighed. Who on earth needs me right now of all times? People should know not to get in the way of me eating. I stood up, and made my way to the door. I opened it, and saw one of Jason's men. \"Boss told me to stand guard of your place,\" the man stated. \"And?\" It may sound harsh, but I was eating, and now I'm not. Why? Because this dude decided to interrupt me. \"And I just wanted to get to know the person I'm guarding,\" he said with a smirk that made me cringe. \"Oh, I see. What's your name?\" I asked. His smirk grew into a toothy smile. Well, I guess it's more of an almost toothless smile. \"The name's Rob. How 'bout you?\" He asked raising his eyebrows, and leaning towards me slightly. I smiled, and said, \"I'm hungry, because you interrupted my meal to flirt with me!\" With that, I slammed the door in his face. Again, I know I'm harsh, but I want food. Simple as that. I sat down to start on my meal. Once again, the doorbell rang. I ignored it. The dude didn't give up though. It kept ringing and ringing. Finally I heard him stop, followed by a loud thud. I finished my meal, and stood up to see what was going on. Next thing I knew, Jason walked in. \"Hey Jason. You're back early,\" I said trying to peek in the bag I just noticed he was carrying. \"Yeah, Some stuff didn't take as long as I expected. Was that that guy bothering you?\" He asked as he pointed at the door. \"He was trying to flirt with me, but I kinda sorta slammed the door in his face 'cause I was hungry,\" I mumbled the last part. That sounded worse out loud than it did in my head. Jason chuckled, and shook his head. Then, suddenly remembering what he was here for, he held out the bag. \"I got this for you,\" he said with a smile on his face. I raised an eyebrow, and slowly took the bag from his hand. I peaked inside the bag, and immediately looked up at Jason grinning from ear to ear. \"You got me a phone? Oh my gosh! Thank you so much!\" I said, squealing like a teenage girl. Well, I am a teenage girl, but whatever. Who cares? I have a phone! I suddenly ran up to Jason, and wrapped my arms around him. I can not believe he got me a phone. I've never had a phone before. \"You're quite welcome. I figure it's the least I could do after what my selfishness has put you through,\" he said, his smile dropping. I looked up at him, and opened my mouth to say, \"Jason, I've had some time to think. I'm not quite ready to forgive you completely, but I'm getting there. I am grateful for all you're doing for me though.\" He nodded, and smiled slightly. I felt something inside me. Was that happiness? I haven't felt that in a long time. I just smiled, went back to hugging Jason. I don't deserve this. Jason is just too good to me. /-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/ A/N: Hey y'all! Yes, I'm alive. Yes, this isn't my best chapter. I didn't really know what I was going to write when I started writing this. Oh, and I showed my sister Fanfiction account. Hi sister (whose name I can't say for privacy reasons)! I love you more than Jason loves Mel. Oops. Spoilers? Only those who actually read author's notes will know. I have a confession, I don't read author's notes 80% of the time. Okay, I'm rambling now. Please leave a review, and tell me what you think, because rappers are just gangster poets. God Bless![Chapter 5] (Jason's P.O.V.) I rubbed my temples as I sat on the couch in my apartment. Mel was still extremely excited about getting a phone. She was so excited, that she actually downloaded every song known to man, and decided to blast it in my Bluetooth surround sound speakers. I think this was the third time we've gone through her play list. Her entire play list. Don't get me wrong, I love that she's having fun, but how many times can a girl listen to Uptown Funk? Mel strolled in the room singingscreaming song lyrics. She plopped down on the couch with a smile on her face, and put her feet in my lap. \"Thank you so much for buying me this phone Jason!\" she yelled over the music, making me flinch considering she's like, what? Two feet away from my face? \"A decision I am beginning to regret,\" I mumbled under my breath. \"WHAT?!\" she yelled even louder. I flinched again. I shook my head, stood up, and replied, \"Nothing.\" I walked out of the apartment, pulling my helmet on as I did so. There's so much going on right now. I just need to think. I picked a random rooftop in Gotham, and sat on the edge. I sighed. What was I doing? I could barely take care of myself while being the Red Hood. What made me think I could handle another human being? Then again, there's no way I could've abandoned Mel any longer. Maybe I should've turned her in? Spending time in jail would allow her to get on the right track. She would have food to eat and a roof over her head. She'd be able to take care of herself there, right? I shook my head at the thought. It would be too risky. She could get hurt or killed. Then, how would I be able to live with myself? Maybe I could take her to Bruce? A disgusted look came over my face immediately. As long as I'm alive, she will not live under Bruce's roof. \"Y'know, you should be careful. A lot of people want you dead. You shouldn't be up here with your guard down like this,\" A voice said interrupting my thoughts. I rolled my eyes. \"I know what I'm doing, Dick. I would like to see someone try to kill me. I can tell you now, it won't end well for them,\" I said, chuckling to myself at my last statement. Dick sat down beside me. \"Careful, Jason. That's the same attitude that got you killed. I refuse to attend your funeral again,\" He said. I rolled my eyes again. \"Whatever, Dad,\" I said jokingly. Dick opened his mouth as if he were going to add something, but seemed to change his mind. \"So, I heard you got yourself a girl. I have to say, I was quite offended that I, your brother, had to get that information second-hand,\" Dick said, as he put his hand over his heart in a fake, hurtful manner. \"She's just an old friend of mine, Dick. Don't be so quick to jump to conclusions,\" I said, rolling my eyes for the third time in this conversation. \"Sure. She's 'just a friend'. I've heard that one before,\" he said, giving me a light push on the shoulder. \"What are we, twelve?\" I said, giving him a stupid look. \"I'm just saying, we'd all love to meet her, especially Bruce,\" he said, casually. I felt myself tense up at the mention of his name. I looked at him confused, and realization hit me. He must have realized he slipped up, because he looked like a kid with his hand caught in the cookie jar. \"Why would Bruce want to meet her? And, come to think of it, when did you become so friendly to me?\" I asked. He didn't need to answer; the look on his face gave it all away. I jumped up, and took off running to the warehouse. (Mel's P.O.V.) \"WHAT?!\" I asked, yelling over the music. Jason shook his head, stood up, and mumbled something. He made a bee-line for the door, and was gone. I sighed. Who peed in his cheerios? I shrugged, and continued to sing. Let's just say, the singing got out of hand. I sat my phone down on the coffee table, and started dancing, and singing the lyrics as loud as I could. Gosh, if Jason were to walk through the door right now, I'd probably die of embarrassment. However, Jason hadn't walked through the door yet, so I just kept on singing and dancing. I don't know how long this continued, but after a little while, I heard the music shut off all at once. My eyes immediately went to the coffee table, where my phone used to be. I pulled out the knife that I always keep with me, and scanned the room with my eyes. I started to walk through the apartment, scanning every inch. It was too quiet here. This guy obviously knew what he was doing. I felt two small, but strong arms wrap around me. Before I could react, something was sprayed in my face. I immediately felt the side effects. The room was spinning so fast. I fell, and someone caught me. I felt myself get hoisted over someone's shoulder before I blacked out. Well, this sucks. A/N: Hello. It's me. So, I actually typed this on my laptop instead of my iPhone. Hopefully it's better. Oh, and hey! Look! It's finally a chapter that isn't just a filler. Cherylblossomxo, if you're reading this, then thank you for your words of encouragement. I apologize that it took so long, but there's a lot of new and exciting and time-consuming things going on in my life right now. If I could just write all day, believe me, I would. Well, I guess I better finish this up. Thanks for reading! I hope you'll follow or even favorite this story! Oh, and please leave a review because it would be weird if your dog did it for you. God Bless![Chapter 6] (Jason's P.O.V.) I burst through the door of my apartment, and started frantically searching the place. I didn't see Mel anywhere. \"MEL?!\" I yelled as loudly as I could. There was no response. I let out a growl, and ran out the door, slamming it behind me. (Mel's P.O.V.) I woke up to a musty smell. I opened my eyes to find myself on a bed in a dark room. No, it was a cave and a big one too. I swung my legs over the side of the bed, and stood up. I attempted to walk forward. Notice I said attempted . I nearly fell on my face, but a pair of strong arms grabbed me. \"Easy there kid. The drugs are still wearing off,\" the man's voice said as he picked me up bridal style, and laid me down on the bed. I would have fought him, but I felt exhausted. I looked into the face of my captor, and was met with the most beautiful blue eyes I had ever seen. Very well. I guess I will just have to flirt my way out of this one. You'd be surprised how many times I've had to. What can I say? Guys aren't usually paying attention to their wallets when a young woman is distracting them. I did a mental hair flip before I started speaking. \"Well, hel-lo handsome! I must've died and gone to heaven, 'cause only an angel could be that gorgeous,\" I said. That was supposed to catch him off guard, but he just chuckled. Okay, I suppose I should have guessed that he was used to being flirted with. I mean, just look at him! I gave it another go, and said, \"You know, I'm writing a paper on the finer things in life.\" He looked at me with a quizzical look, but I continued with, \"And I was wondering if I could interview you?\" After I said that, he lost it. He started cracking up, his laughter echoing through the cave. That's not the reaction I expected, but I used this as a distraction, and kneed him between the legs. His laughter immediately stopped, and was replaced by a pained groaning. I'm assuming he had doubled-over in pain, but I wasn't sure considering I was too busy running like a mad-woman. I found a flight of stairs, so I ran up them three at a time. At the top of the stairs, I found myself to be behind a clock in a study. I shoved the clock, and wasted no time getting of there. I managed to find the front door, but someone must have seen me run out of it, because I heard someone yell, \"Master Bruce! She's getting away!\" Only when I was outside did I realize that I had been kept in the basement of a mansion. I ran down the incredibly long driveway to find a locked gate awaiting me. I knew I could climb it, but it wouldn't be quick. After looking around for a moment, I realized it was my only option. I grabbed the bars in front of me, and started climbing the expensive gate. It had to have been 20 feet tall! When I was only about halfway up, I heard footsteps coming my way. I tried to climb faster, but it caused me to slip. I fell to the ground, and before I could touch the gate again, I was grabbed around the waist. A pair of handcuffs were placed on my wrists, and I was hoisted over a tall man's shoulders. I tried to wiggle and fight my way out, but it was useless. I eventually just gave up, and accepted my fate in shame. When we were inside the mansion once again, I looked up to see the blue-eyed beauty still in pain. I had to smirk to myself because of that. I don't care how gorgeous he is, he kidnapped me, and so he deserves it. I was carried back down the stairs to the dark cave. He sat me down on a cold metal chair (when there was literally a nice, cushioned, comfy-looking chair that was about two feet away). He removed the handcuff from my left wrist, and attached it to the chair. \"Aw, Come on! Look, I pinky promise I won't run away again?\" I lied in an obvious tone. With no emotion, he just walked upstairs, ignoring me completely. How rude. After several minutes of me trying to free my hand of the handcuffs, the blue-eyed man came back down the stairs of the cave. I gave a little smile to the fact that he was obviously still in pain. I lifted my right hand to emphasize the handcuffs, and said, \"Are these really necessary?\" He answered my question with an annoyed look on his face. That just made my smile a little bigger. Sometimes I crack myself up. He pulled up a chair in front of me, and sat down slowly. He leaned forward in the chair, resting his elbows on his knees with his fingers intertwined. He looked me in the eye, and gave a small, friendly smile. \"I feel like you and I got off to a rough start. I think it'd be best if we just started over.\" He paused for a moment. It was as if he was waiting for me to react. When I did nothing, he just said, \"Hi, I'm Dick.\" I raised an eyebrow at him. When he gave no signs that he was joking, I had to ask, \"Wait, are you actually serious?\" He sighed as if he gets this reaction often. \"It's what everyone calls me. It's supposed to be short for Richard,\" He said as if he's said it a many times before. \"Then why don't people just call you Rich or Richie or something?\" I asked with genuine confusion. \"I don't really know,\" he said, shaking his head toward the ground, before continuing, \"It would make my life so much easier if they did.\" As if he suddenly remembered what we were supposed to be discussing, he looked up, and said, \"So, what's your name?\" I raised an eyebrow at him again, and inquired, \"Why would you kidnap someone, if you don't even know their name?\" \"It happens more often than you think, actually. You'd be amazed at the reasons I've seen people get kidnapped for,\" He said, slightly disgusted. \"You talk like you see crime often,\" I said, chuckling. Then it clicked with me. I was kidnapped just days after moving in with Jason, the freaking Red Hood. I looked around the cave to see various suits belonging to various vigilantes. Seriously, how did I not notice that before? I looked at my captor with widened eyes. \"Are you Batman?\" I said, almost fearful of the outcome. I was somewhat relieved, and yet, somewhat alarmed when he chuckled. \"Not quite,\" he said humorously. He expected me to say something, but I just sat there waiting for him to continue. After moments of idiocy, he still hadn't caught the hint. I huffed in annoyance. \"Well?\" I asked trying to get him to say anything. \"Oh, right! I guess I might as well tell you. I'm Nightwing,\" he explained. It took a few moments of me just blinking dumbly at him, for me to fully comprehend what I just heard. \"So, wait a second,\" I said eventually while resting my head on my left hand. \"I've been kidnapped by a knock-off Batman?\" \"Okay, first of all, ouch. That hurt,\" he started, \"Second of all, Batman and Robin kidnapped you. I'm just better at talking to people, so that's why I'm here, and thir-\" I interrupted him by saying, \"You can still be arrested for being an accomplice to a criminal, y'know?\" He chose to ignore my remark by continuing, \"Third, believe it or not, we're actually trying to help you.\" \"Oh and how is that? By kidnapping me? Wow, what a great idea!\" I said with extreme sarcasm. \"It was the only way we could get you away from Jason!\" He said, desperately trying to convince me that he did the right thing. I froze in my place. \"How do you know his name?\" I asked. I was confused, and scared. \"He's my brother,\" Dick stated. \"And my son,\" said a deep, gruff voice from the stairs. I whipped my head in the direction of the voice, to see the figure of the man that carried me down here approaching me. He stood behind Dick, with his arms crossed over his chest. They proceeded to tell me the story of Jason's life, and how he died and his return. Dick finished their tale off with, \"…So that's why we have reason to believe that his mentally-unstable self would be a danger to you. We only have your best interests in mind.\" \"Wow,\" I said with a hint of sarcasm, before saying, \"Well, thank you for the kidnapping adventure and the lovely story, but you are sadly mistaken.\" Dick cocked his head to the side in confusion, and Bruce just squinted slightly at me. \"You see, I've known Jason since he was ten. I mean, we lost contact a few years ago, but he actually was the one who saved me.\" I explained the story of him killing off my gang, and giving me a home. After my explanation, Bruce looked like he was going to say something, but instead seemed to get tense all of the sudden. I was confused at first, but then I heard what was going on. A faint sound was getting louder as if it was getting closer. I listened carefully. It sounded like a motorcycle. Dick stood up, and ran with Bruce to grab weapons. I yelled for them to remove the handcuffs so I could defend myself, but they ignored me. That's when I resorted to screaming various profanities at them. The motorcycle made it into the cave, but I couldn't see who it was because it was behind me. I heard a few quiet words being exchanged before I heard what sounded like a fight. I attempted to turn the get the handcuffs off, but to no avail. I heard someone running towards me, and I was somewhat relieved to see it was Dick. He removed my handcuffs, and I ran with him towards the stairs, when I heard the intruder yell my name. I turned to see Jason pinned to the ground by Bruce. I glanced to the ground in front of them to find an object I knew I would need. I took off in a sprint towards it, when Dick grabbed me. \"Sorry,\" I mumbled as I put everything I had into elbowing him in the nose. He released me, and I continued to sprint. When I arrived at my destination in the cave, I picked up the object, and held it away from me firmly. I wore a look on my face that could kill Satan himself. \"Get off him. I won't hesitate to shoot,\" I said firmly while I pointed Jason's gun at him. He didn't budge. \"Don't test me,\" I said louder. Bruce just stared back at me. Gosh, he's stubborn. \"Last chance, Bruce,\" I practically spat his name. No movement was made. BANG! A/N: Merry Christmas! As a gift, I present a crappy chapter from a tired author. Note to self: Try a little harder to fall asleep before 3:30am. Oh, so since my mostly-non-nerdy family wasn't excited about my Christmas gifts, so I'll tell y'all (people who belong to at least one fandom). So, I got Gryffindor pajamas, one Batman shirt, two Justice League shirts, Batman socks, The Maze Runner Series books, The Amazing Book Is Not On Fire, and a Doctor Who bracelet (along with a few other non-fandom related things). My family knows the secret; buy me fandom/nerdy stuff, and I won't bother you. Anyways, thank you so much for reading my story! Feel welcome to read my others, and if you don't mind, leave a review telling me what you thought about it. God Bless!

My name is Saddie L. Tunstall and I am John Tunstall's daughter. My dad has been taking in boys who don't have a place to go since I was ten. First came Josiah G. Scurlock. Then Dick, Charlie, Steve, then Chavez. He took in Josiah (Doc) a week after my mother died. Me and him haven't gotten along since. Just recently, he took in William H. Bony, Billy for short. He gets on my nerves more than Doc ever did. \"I'll tell you something Chavez,\" I overheard Steve one time. \"That kid never shuts his pie hole.\" \"Just like you?\" Chavez spat. I had personally liked Chavez better than any of 'em. I respected Dick for being the quietest and most mature, but Chavez understood me. I'd be surprised if he didn't understand everyone. \"Nup,\" Steve disagreed. \"Just like you.\" He lodged a wad of chew in his mouth and flounced off. That was one thing about Steve that I never liked: he had no manners. I'm about Doc's age, Billy's height, and Steve's weight. I have blue-green eyes and long, sandy blonde hair. Although Doc and I where twenty, we still fought like children. As I said, my dad has been taking homeless boys in since I was ten and Doc was the first. I didn't think of him as my brother like I do Chavez, a friend like Dick, or a no one like Billy. He wasn't someone I didn't talk to like Charlie, or someone I wouldn't talk to like Steve. He was just . . . there; sometimes I noticed him, sometimes I didn't. When I did, I was mostly taunting him or punching him. I've done a lot of physical damage to his things and probably caused a lot of emotional pain. Although I knew he was tough and could handle himself, I started to feel bad. Because of what I did to him when we were younger, he wont accept my apologies or accept the fact that I want to be my friend. \"I'm sorry Doc,\" I said after he flipped through his journal to see if all his poems and notes were intact. \"If there's one thing I know about you Saddie,\" he began, smiling. \"It's that you're never sorry.\" I held strongly to his innocent gaze and repeated my self. \"I'm sorry Doc.\" He stifled a small, hurt filled laugh and shook his head. \"I mean it.\" \"Doc, Saddie,\" John called. \"Come get your dinner.\" I fallowed Doc out of the room and to the dinner table. \"Hi Saddie,\" Steve said with his mouth full. \"Hey Steve,\" I greeted back, taking a seat next to Doc.[Chapter 2] \"Saddie took my journal,\" Doc said after taking a swig of water. \"Saddie took my journal,\" I mimicked, my mouth full. \"Don't talk with your mouth full,\" he snapped. \"I'll talk however I want, Josiah.\" \"Will you two just stop fighting?\" My dad yelled. I nodded and took my plate into the kitchen to clean it off. Doc fallowed. \"I'm sorry,\" he started, placing his plate in the sink on top of mine. \"Why are you apologizing?\" I asked. He looked down and smiled his usual stop-being-mean-to-me-I'm-so-innocent, smile. \"I should be the one apologizing.\" \"I didn't think you would,\" he said, his head still bowed. \"I'm not that heartless,\" I said, offended. \"I never said you were.\" He brought his head up again and looked in my eyes. \"You know, you're not like anyone of the other boys Doc,\" I said, trying my best not to sound like I was lying. \"Guys,\" Charlie yelled, sounding happy. \"Come get some pie.\" I smiled at Doc. We never usually get pie, and it was really rare when we did. \"Let's go,\" he said, smiling back. We walked out of the kitchen and into the dinning room. \"Here,\" Chavez said, handing Doc and I a plate full of pie. \"Thanks,\" I said, taking a seat. Doc pulled out the chair next to me and sat. \"Did you guys make up?\" My dad asked. I nodded, my mouth full of pie. \"I'm surprised,\" Steve said, spitting out bits of pie as he spoke. Doc whipped pie away from his face and gave Steve a disgusted look. \"Billy,\" my dad spoke. \"You haven't spoken all day, are you okay?\" \"Yes sir, I'm all right. This sure is some good pie.\" He laughed his annoying laugh. It seemed like no matter how hard you tried, that laugh fallows you everywhere. God, I swear I hear that laugh in my sleep! It's so annoying. Charlie had his pie down faster than Steve could even shoot a barrel. \"Dang Charlie,\" Dick yelped. \"Maybe you should slow down some so the rest of us could finish.\" Charlie reddened. \"Sorry.\" We all laughed.[Chapter 3] After dinner, while the boys were reading, I went up to the small bedroom Doc and I shared to go to bed. I took my hair beret out and watched my long, blonde hair fall to my lower back. I gazed in the mirror and sighed. \"He'd never love me,\" I murmured, studying my features in the mirror. Doc hated me, plain and simple. No matter how much I tried, it was pointless. I ran a finger down my jaw. I thought I was fairly pretty with my blue eyes, my long blonde hair, pink lips, and red cheeks. I was very slim and very pale. I glanced at Doc's journal on the dresser. I'd always wonder what he wrote about, always sitting away from me and the other boys. I picked it up and, carefully, opened it. I read through several poems, but I only found interest in a few. Sorrowful Aggravating Daring Dramatic Irritating Energetic I laughed at seeing what words Doc could come up with about me, but read on. I found one crossed out but it was still legible. Your blonde hair falls to your waist You tend to do everything in haste You always seem like you have no clue, but still I love you Your lips are the color of a rose In your hair are always bows You always smell sweat, yet you never keep your things neat When I see you, my heart shatters, like nothing else in the world matters. I shook my head after reading the poem. I heard the doorknob twist and hurriedly put it away. \"Hey Doc,\" I said, smiling.[Chapter 4] The next day, New Year's Eve to be exact, Chavez, Charlie, Doc, Dick, Billy, Steve, and I went outside to practice shooting (well for Chavez, throwing knives). It felt really nice outside that day. Chavez stood up and aligned himself perfectly even with one of our fence posts. He drew his hand back and flung the knife as hard as he could, his braded ponytail trailing behind him. Just then, someone shot the barrel next to him and everyone dived for cover. Just as soon as it happened, we heard a maniacal laugh and sighed. We looked up on the roof and there was Billy, sitting cross-legged, and holding two guns. \"Regulators,\" John called. \"We dance.\" We looked amongst each other, smiles crossing our faces. I then pranced on up the stairs and into my room before Doc could. I decided I would where a dress for once (the only time I'd ever worn a dress was the few days I went to church with my dad). Doc's POV Great, I thought as I heard Saddie and my bedroom door slam. She's going to take forever. I walked slowly up the stairs, wondering how long she would take. I got to the door and knocked. \"One second,\" Saddie called. \"Hurry,\" I called back. I heard her sigh. A minute or two later, the door opened and there was Saddie; dressed in a fine, wine red velvet dress that encircled her ankles. She was warring black, button up boots that went just below where the dress ended. I looked up and saw her hair was pined back with a bow; only her long bangs hanging out. The thing that surprised me was that she was warring make up. I could actually tell she was a girl-a beautiful one at that-. \"I-I-can-I use the room now?\" I stammered, trying to maintain eye contact. She laughed. \"Sure, You can Doc.\" Saddie's POV When I opened the door, Doc stared at me, eyes wide, mouth gaping. I couldn't help but smile. I'd thought he didn't like me, the poems he wrote about me told me otherwise. I decided I wouldn't tell him I liked him, but to play hard-to-get and make him fall for me more. It was a very deceitful strategy, but then again, I was definitely an underhanded person. It seemed easy when I thought about it, but I found myself falling more in love with him than the other way around. Anyone probably would have guessed that I would do such a thing. People thought of me as wicked, some even thought of me as cold-blooded and unfeeling. Whenever I looked into Doc's blue, pleading eyes, I felt guilty. I felt guilty for treating him badly and toying with his feelings. But I told myself that I'd have to get over it or I'd become weak like my mother was. Suddenly, my thoughts were interrupted by Billy's unrestrained laughter. Simultaneously, Doc and I glanced at Billy giving him an aggravated look. \"You can get ready now,\" I said, startling Doc. He nodded and pushed past me hurriedly. After I heard the door shut behind me, I made my way down the stairs. Suddenly, everything went quiet and all eyes fell on me. \"Well ain't you pretty,\" Chavez said, smiling. \"You actually look like a girl,\" Billy yelped, making only himself laugh. \"Wow,\" was all Charlie could say at Billy's aggravating annoyance. Dick cleared his throat and straightened up. I looked over at Steve who was unnaturally quiet. His chew filled mouth was hanging slightly open and his eyes were wide. A minute later, Doc strode down the stairs, his blonde hair perfectly combed back except for his long bangs that always seemed to flip back no matter how hard he tried to push them out of his face. \"Go tell John we can go now,\" Dick ordered Billy. \"Yes sir,\" Billy responded, leaving the room. \"You look nice Doc,\" I said. He stifled a laugh and smiled. \"Thanks, you do to.\" \"She looks weird,\" Steve protested. Everybody could tell Steve didn't even try to groom himself. His hair was always a mess, he always had dirt smeared on his face, he always wore ragged cloths, and always spat out spit mixed with chew wherever he went. \"You guys ready?\" My dad asked. He glanced at me and stopped in his tracks. \"Saddie,\" he murmured. \"You look beautiful.\" \"Naw,\" I protested. \"I just look like a girl, but don't get use to it.\" He nodded and led us out of the house. I rode my horse between Dick and Doc the whole time. \"Are you having any trouble there Miss?\" Dick turned around to ask. \"Yea, as big as that dress is, I thought you wouldn't even be able to fit on the horse,\" Doc agreed. \"It's not that big,\" I murmured. \"Just be careful not to fall off when we get there,\" Billy snickered. \"Everyone would be able to see your underwear.\" I rolled my eyes as he started to laugh. \"It wasn't funny,\" I shouted. \"Now shut yer trap before I ride over there and beat you!\" \"Billy got told by a girl,\" Chavez taunted. \"I ain't kidding either, Chavez.\" \"I bet you aren't,\" he agreed.

But sadly, many do not have the attention span to read so much in one post. It will be reposted in 6 parts. So enjoy my lovelies! Disclaimer: I own nothing of Young Guns. It's copyrights belongs to The Man, thus not me; and the real life men of the Southwest that have given me joy to write about their lives from a romantic viewpoint. So to our beloved outlaws, the women who loved them, and to those of us who still love them, I dedicate this story. I do not own the song \"Come Josephine in My Flying Machine.\" This specific version was performed by Moya (or Marie) Brennan from the Back to Titanic album. I also do not own the song \"A Small Measure of Peace\" (and \"The Way of the Sword\"), which are from The Last Samurai soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. I put these songs on repeat and let them take me away. You can find these songs on youtube or Bing music. I suggest using them if you want the full effect of the changing tone of the story. Also, if you ever watched the awesome Telenovela Zorro La Espada y La Rosa , you'll see a few connections; such connections I hold no account to - it belongs to Telemundo. Authors Note: When I started this story, it was after a trip to Phoenix (Glendale), Arizona & Anaheim, California, which was less than two years ago. Glendale fed me with its Billy the Kid scenery, and Disneyland, to be specific, fed me the desire to imagine anything. As time went by, I started my University experience, and took a Beginning Fiction Writing class, and then the next semester, a Craft of Fiction Writing class. I learned many things about writing, and to express myself in better words. Over five years in the making, since seeing it the first time at Umi's (aka Taenzcher's) house, I had a blast writing this! So, now to move on and continue working on the sequel to Setting of the Sun! Love you all! A Small Measure of Peace *~-|-~*~-|-~*Chapter One*~-|-~*~-|-~* Who couldn't help but look up every time Billy rode into the village. Billy, Arkansas Dave and Pat Garrett would always get off their horses and go inside of Beever's tavern. Celsa Baca lovingly hid the boys whenever soldiers came by, despite the $500 reward for Billy's head alone. Laisha had watched them for a few years, coming in, going out. It was always the same, sometimes resulting in a shootout with the townsfolk who wanted Billy's reward more than Billy's friendship. But one day, Billy rode in with a few strangers. One had bright blond hair, and the other was of darker skin, like her. The people of the village fled in fear of the new strangers. Her father, Jesus, had been called upon by Billy to find men to travel on Billy's new quest. But her father only found one man; it was Mr. French. Hendry French had lost his wife in childbirth, along with the child, and his farm within two years of obtaining all he had desired. Hendry would sometimes stop by and have dinner with her family after the passing of his spouse and baby. It had been heartbreaking to see such a kind man go through so much pain. The village recently had received orphans from an orphan train from the east coast. Most of the children had left to claim their fortunes on ranches that sucked the life out the people and the land, and the people's pocketbooks. Laisha noted how foolishly the boy hung around Beever's despite the fact that Beever threw the boy out on his face on more than one occasion. But Billy must have taken pity on the boy, because only a day after the stranger's arrival, Billy and his improved posse were preparing another departure. It had been rumored that Billy was setting his eyes on Governor Wallace, for what reason was probably stemmed from the bounty. \"Laisha, go bring some water for the soup,\" her mother ordered. Laisha did not argue and tore herself away from the garden. There was nothing else to do in the quiet village. She sat the metal bucket on the ground with a thump. Wiping the sweat off her brow, and lowered the rope-bound bucket into the well. She pulled it back and emptied the bucket into her own. \"Oh good grief,\" she said to herself as she was how little water the small bucket had to offer. It was take at least thirty minutes to have enough for the soup. She stood up quickly and her head hit something, and whatever it was, it gasped in pain. She rubbed her throbbing head and turned around, \"Oh I am so sorry!\" It was the Indian that Billy had brought in today with the blond man. She blushed a fierce crimson at her embarrassment. She wasn't graceful, but she wasn't clumsy either. \"S'okay,\" the man said and touched his face. \"It seems my nose is at least in one piece.\" Laisha laughed nervously, \"Really, I am sorry. I didn't hear you or see you.\" \"Obviously,\" the young man smiled. \"Am I bleeding?\" She grimaced, \"Unfortunately yes.\" He wiped off his nose with his dirty sleeve and drew in a breath of air quickly. \"Oh, please, let me help you. It's the least I can do.\" She picked up her nearly-empty bucket and motioned for him to follow her, and he did. She led him to her family's small home at the edge of the village. \"Mother?\" she called as she entered the hut. No reply came, \"She must be tending to the garden out back.\" She pulled out a chair, \"Have a seat. I need to check how bad I hit you.\" The man sat down, \"I'm Jose Chavez y Chavez by the way, ma'am. I go by Chavez.\" \"Laisha,\" she said as she used the little amount of water in the bucket to boil. \"Laisha? That's a rare name. I typically meet Maria's.\" \"My grandmother was a gypsy; I was named after her.\" She watched the water simmer in the pan. \"She died when I was very young, so I never was able to know her.\" She reached into a covered basket and pulled out a few strips of cloth. \"Do both your parents live here?\" Laisha nodded, \"Yes. My father was the one who went to find more people to ride with you, Billy, and the others.\" \"Jose or something like that wasn't it? His name.\" \"Jesus.\" Chavez nodded. \"My father is one of the head workers for the Maxwell family.\" She dropped the strips of cloth into the boiling water. \"What about your mother?\" \"She works here at home and sometimes at other homes.\" She turned to him and smirked, \"You are asking me all the questions.\" \"I just want to get to know my attacker better,\" Chavez smirked back. She put a wooden spoon into the water pulled out a strip. She walked over and began touching up his bloody nose with a gentle hand. \"Wow, all I felt was a little throbbing on my head. I did some major damage on you though.\" \"I've had worse. I been shot, stabbed, beaten; it's all good.\" \"Wow, you've lived an exciting life. What foray of business involved you in all of that?\" \"I used to be one of the Tunstall regulators.\" Laisha froze and looked at him, \"I remember reading in the paper about it. I remember that the Regulators had at least thirty men in the McSween house.\" Chavez shook his head, \"There was only five of us, actually, as well as Mr. and Mrs. McSween, and Yin – Murphey's hostage.\" \"So few?\" she said sadly. \"Billy, myself, and one other regulator survived of the original six we started out with.\" Laisha headed back to the kettle to get another strip. \"I've tried to keep a low profile since then; I took a job on a fruit farm in California. But someone turned me in; I was brought into Lincoln nearly a month ago. My friend-\" \"The blond man?\" she interrupted as she began working on his nose again. Chavez nodded, \"-Doc was brought in all the way from New York; they tracked him down that far.\" Chavez shook his head. \"Doc does not deserve being here. Ouch!\" Laisha raised an eyebrow. \"If you stopped moving, you wouldn't bump your nose.\" Chavez sighed. \"Well, Doc's a good man with a gentle soul. But put into bad situations, he has the ability to kill if he needed to.\" \"What about you?\" \"I've had to kill in order to survive since I was little. It seems to come with the territory of being an Indian these days.\" \"What people do you belong to?\" \"I'm half Navaho and half Mexican. What about you? You mentioned something about being partial gypsy.\" \"I'm half Mexican as well, on my father's side; and a quarter gypsy and a quarter Spanish on my mother's side.\" \"Spanish?\" \"My mother's father hailed from Spain. He was a well-to-do caballero.\" She leaned back. \"I think that's good. It's stopped bleeding.\" Chavez smiled, \"Thank you.\" \"Would you like to stay for dinner?\" A moment of silence passed between them as he gazed at her, \"I would like to. Thank you.\" Laisha grinned back. Laisha's mother, Maria Pia, looked upon her scornfully. When Laisha had told her mother about Chavez staying for dinner, she almost blew a top. She ranted to Liasha that there was not enough food, and to dine with an outlaw was different that living in the same village as one. \"So, you're going on an adventure with Billy?\" her mother asked as she spooned soup into her mouth. She had made it a point to sit directly across from Chavez, to make sure he was up to no funny business. \"Of sorts,\" Chavez said slowly. He cleared his throat, \"I hope I'm not a inconvenience.\" Jesus smiled, \"Not at all! Any friend of Billy's is a friend of the family.\" Laisha smiled at her father, happy at least that one of her parents decided Chavez was okay. He appeared to be a genuine person... \"I'm afraid that this is all we have to eat this evening: the soup and bread,\" Maria Pia snapped. It was Laisha's turn to glare at her mother, fighting the urge the kick her mother's shine from under the table. \"Oh, that's fine. I haven't had a home cooked meal in so long that I forgot how good it is.\" \"I'm sure an outlaw doesn't get the chance to eat real food often, especially good food.\" Chavez nodded to Maria Pia. \"That's true.\" \"So why start now OUCH!\" Maria Pia shot a threatening look at Laisha. Laisha shot daggers at her mother with her eyes. Chavez couldn't help but chuckle, \"It's okay. I'm used to being insulted. I had a friend once who used to insult me nearly all the time.\" \"What happened to him?\" Laisha asked. \"He died during the McSween battle.\" \"Okay, that's it!\" Maria Pia stood up. \"Are you finished Mr. Chavez!\" Chavez downed the rest of his soup and clutched his bread. \"Good! Get out!\" she shouted. \"Mother!\" Laisha yelled back. \"Maria Pia, please!\" Jesus argued. \"No, I want him out! Outlaws belong outside of this home!\" Chavez closed his eyes for a moment, his nostrils flaring. He could only take crap for so long... He stood up so quickly that his chair ricocheted off of him and hit the wall. He gritted his teeth at Maria Pia, \"Goodnight m'am.\" He nodded to Jesus, \"Thank you for having me over.\" Jesus smiled, \"Anytime!\" Chavez turned to Laisha and smiled softly. \"Laisha, I hope to see you again.\" Laisha smiled back, \"You will.\" She watched him turn and walk out of the house, closing the wooden plank door. She immediately grabbed the basket of biscuits and headed to the door. \"And where do you think you're going, with our food!\" Maria Pia shouted. Laisha glared at her mother, \"To make an apology, which you should be making! You're always horrible when it comes to being a hostess! Grandfather would be furious. You're never nice or courteous; you are in fact a black-hearted witch!\" Maria Pia gasped and placed a hand on her heaving chest, outraged. \"How dare you!\" Laisha rolled her eyes at her mother as Maria Pia began yelling at her in Spanish. She walked out the door and closed it on her mother.[Chapter 2] For disclaimers, please see chapter one. Made purely for fun, and was a free writing piece I did when I was frustrated during my Craft of Fiction Writing class. Yeah, this was my I-have-a-fiction-paper-due-and-I-have-writers-block work. But I think this turned our rather well. Writing this allowed me also to get out the story I desperately wanted to write since I first saw Young Guns II at 2 am at Taenzcher's pad. By doing this now, I was able to move back into the first Young Guns' fic sequel. I know some of you have been waiting ever so patiently for my Setting of the Sun sequel...so long in fact you've probably nearly forgotten the story. Sorry it's taking that long, but I am working on it! In fact, I brought a few notebooks to scribble things down in during class this past spring semester. Being an English major takes up all time of reading and writing for fun, but I am getting a Creative Writing minor out of is...c'est la vie. If you are curious about my works, please visit my homepage I set up specifically for my works, fan fiction and original fiction. Part 2 of 6. Enjoy! A Small Measure of Peace *~-|-~*~-|-~*Chapter Two*~-|-~*~-|-~* Laisha had looked all over the small village, but she didn't find him. She could only think he was, thus, at Beever Smith's, but she really didn't want to go in there. Beever was rather, well, vulgar about young women. But she felt that maybe between Billy and Chavez, she should be okay. She pushed the curtain back and saw Chavez, Billy, Arkansas Dave, Pat Garrett, Hendry French, the blond man from earlier that Chavez called Doc, and the young boy that had been seen around the village. Chavez looked up from his knives, \"Laisha!\" Giggles erupted from Billy and Dave. She made eye contact with Hendry French and beamed. \"Good evening Mr. French,\" she said as she walked to the table the men were gathered around. Hendry tipped his hat, \"Hello there Miss Laisha. What brings you to this place?\" Laisha sent a pleading look at Chavez, \"A major apology for the way my mother acted.\" She turned to Hendry, \"You know her; always sticking it where the sun don't shine.\" Hendry beamed and said sarcastically, \"Your mother has a right way this words; always knows exactly what to say and when to say it.\" The young boy joined the group and pointed to her basket. \"What's all them biscuits for?\" \"These,\" she swept an area of the table clean and gingerly sat the biscuits down, \"Are the apology for which my mother will never, ever make.\" Laisha turned to Chavez, \"Really, I am so sorry about what she said. She's always been pig-headed.\" Chavez smirked, \"I'm sure what was fuming at the thought of taking all the biscuits to feed the outlaws and Indian.\" \"Haha!\" Laisha laughed, \"Indeed she was!\" She saw how they eyed the biscuits, \"You may have them on one condition.\" Billy looked up from his gun, \"And what condition is that?\" Dave leaned on the table and crossed his arms. \"Do we need to sleep with you in order to earn those biscuits?\" he laughed. Laisha felt herself sink in as though someone had punched her in the chest. A somber and hurt look crossed her face that matched her sudden feelings within. A knife landed right in front of Dave and he jumped back from the table. Chavez stood and grabbed his knife, glaring at Dave. \"You don't mouth off like that to a lady.\" Dave opened his mouth for a comeback, but Doc beat him to it. \"Dave, watch your tongue. Chavez is right, you do not mouth off to a young lady. Billy proceeded to round up the biscuits and pull them towards him. \"For that Dave, you don't get ANY biscuits.\" Dave's mouth dropped. \"What! Come on Billy, that ain't fair!\" \"It's perfectly fair Dave. NO BISCUITS FOR YOU.\" Laisha smiled slightly, feeling a little better after Dave's insulting idea. \"Well, umm, I have to go now, so goodbye to you all. Mr. French, Billy, Chavez...\" She walked out of Beever's a little crushed. \"Laisha, wait up,\" a voice called. Laisha spun around and saw Chavez walking to her. She stood her ground, heart pounding. When he stood in front of her, he had a request, \"Would it be alright if we went somewhere and talked?\" She nodded her head. \"There's some benches on the side of the church.\" Chavez nodded and smiled, \"Sounds good.\" They both walked in the direction of the church, silence passing between them. Laisha knew what she was doing was rather dangerous. Chavez wasn't a total stranger, but she did not know him very well. And to sit with him in a dark, secluded area would send her mother flying if they were discovered. But for once in her life, she wanted to take a risk, a chance! Chavez pulled one bench up to another as to give them both more room. \"So tell me,\" he said as he sat down, \"What exactly was the original condition you were going to request.\" Laisha smiled a little more, \"That Beever Smith didn't get any.\" Chavez laughed. Laisha laughed now too. \"Don't laugh! For your information the man is a scoundrel, a greedy cheat, and is well known around the village for peeping.\" \"I've known him less than 12 hours and I have to agree with you.\" He turned to her, \"Look, it's my turn to apologize. I've also known Dave less than 12 hours and I can't stand him already.\" \"Then your journey with Billy should prove to be interesting.\" Chavez chuckled, \"Yes, it will.\" He looked up at the New Mexico sky. \"Clear tonight, isn't it?\" \"It looks like that every night.\" \"I haven't seen the sky here for a while. I've been in California for a few years, and then I was dragged back here. I was tied up in a storage car on a train, and then thrown into a pit for a while before Billy came to get Doc and me. I haven't seen this sky for so long.\" She looked up at the sky too. \"Is it different out there?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Is the world different than here? This is all I know, but I...want more than what this place has to offer.\" \"Every place differs. The further east you go, minus Texas, the less likely you are to get shot randomly.\" He glanced at her, \"I think you would fit in very well in the east.\" She smiled at him, \"Maybe I'll go there someday. My mother wants me to marry someone soon, but I don't want to. Not yet.\" \"Have you told her that?\" \"Oh yes, and then she proceeded to throw a chair at the wall.\" \"May I ask you something slightly personal?\" \"Of course.\" \"Why is your mother the way she is? I thought you said she came from humble origins.\" \"She did, but I guess she desperately wanted more, strangely like I want more. Her father was a caballero, but she was illegitimate, so she was denied his lifestyle. But grandmother loved her and so she let her go seek her fortune. The whole group was apparently happy to see her go. Mom is kind of the black sheep of the family.\" \"I thought you said your grandmother died when you were young?\" \"She did. I got this information from a friend of my grandmother's, who died a few years ago.\" A moment of silence passed between them as they gazed up at the sky. \"So if you don't plan on marrying soon, what will you do?\" \"Well, I know she'd kick me out if I told her I didn't want to marry yet. I know I would not resort to walking the streets. At least Paulita Maxwell's parents let her choose the relationship she has.\" Chavez stole a glance at her and she met it. \"What? Everyone in town knows she and Billy are involved in a little hanky-panky.\" He half-smirked at her. \"You into gossip or something?\" \"No; it just happens to be a well-known fact.\" He shook his head and whispered to himself more than anything, \"Leave it to Billy.\" He looked back at her with his eyes alone. \"So, what exactly do you want to do then?\" \"Well, I could be a teacher, or a nurse.\" Chavez was silent for a moment, \"Would you force your religion on those who belong to another?\" Laisha slowly looked at him, \"I...don't understand.\" \"For hundreds of years now, whites have been forcing an ultimatum on my people. And when I say my people, I mean every tribe that once lived on these lands before whites. That ultimatum was either to convert to Christianity; or to be killed quickly by gunfire or hanging, or slowly by being forced onto reservations. And even when we did convert, they did not treat us like the equals as they promised.\" \"I...I had no idea that was going on, Chavez,\" she said quietly. She wanted so desperately to apologize to him, but she, herself, had not done these things, nor anyone she knew. \"If I did become a teacher, it would be to help. I would teach people how to read, how to perform basic mathematics. I did stay in school as far as the system would let me go; mother demanded that of me. I read reasonably well, and although my mathematic skills are not up to par, I think I could still manage to teach it with help of books.\" \"You have no desire to force religion on people?\" \"I can't help but be truthful, Chavez. I would NOT force it on anyone, never ever. But if they were curious, I guess I could talk about it.\" \"Aren't there different branches of Christianity?\" \"Umm, yes.\" \"What's the one around here?\" \"Catholic mostly.\" \"Are you catholic?\" \"Yes...?\" \"Well, the farther north you go, it's more...\" Chavez creased his brow, frustrated. \"Oh, it's starts with a P...\" \"Protestant?\" \"Yes, that's it! And the two blend better when you go farther east. And the farther it spreads west, the more of my people loose who we are.\" There was nothing Laisha could say. \"They strip us slowly; inch by inch, acre by acre of land. Then we are made to move and keep moving while we die of disease and hunger. When we cried out for food or water, we were denied basic necessities because we were Indians. We were forced onto barren lands and told to farm for our living. How can you plant crops where the land is sandy and dry? Even when we speak amongst ourselves, fear overcame whites and dispersed us. Frustrated we fought back with the weapons we had bought or traded fair in square for. Army men came in and stripped us of those weapons. They thought us a threat so much for trying to survive, that they have massacred so many of my people...\" Chavez looked down from the sky and away from her. He took in sharp breaths. \"Chavez?\" She said quietly and placed a hand on his forearm. Chavez placed his other free hand over hers, but did not turn to look at her for many moments. When his breathing calmed, he leaned against the church wall, but did not let go of her hand. \"My life story is similar to many others. I am the last of my tribe. I went to California to find a way to revive my tribe, but I have failed. All I have left in this world is Billy and Doc, and Doc more than Billy.\" He quickly looked back and her and smiled slightly. \"So, what about your nursing career? Don't you have to go to some fancy school for that?\" The tension melted away with his slight smile. \"Oh no, schooling is for doctors. Doctors, from what I've read in the papers, tell the women what to do, and that's how they become nurses I guess.\" She sighed and leaned against the wall with him. \"I have watched children die in this village, and I cry over them because there is nothing I can do. I cannot whip up a magical remedy and cure them. I feel so powerless. I want to be able to possibly save someone if they've been shot, feed them to help them get better. No child, more matter what they look like or where they come from, should have to die when they are so young. No one should have to succumb to an illness. If he or she is bleeding from being shot, I want to stop the bleeding.\" She sighed and closed her eyes. \"I want to help others, Chavez, so desperately. I have no real desire to partake in the traditional female role of being a reproductive tool. I don't care what God supposedly said about replenishing the earth. I mean seriously? Does it still need replenishing? The last time I looked, it looked perfectly fine the way it was.\" After a few moments, Chavez turned her hand over, palm side up, and traced the lines ever so lightly. Laisha felt her checks go hot; his touch was so simple, so intimate. He looked up at her, \"Laisha?\" \"Yes?\" she whispered back. \"May I kiss you?\" She opened her eyes and gazed at him. A question such as that was unbelievably and undeniably personal that her breathing became a little heavy. \"If you do not want it, Laisha, simply say no. I just...I don't know if you feel it, but I feel an attraction to you, a pull. There's a strength in you that is rare in these parts. You speak your mind; you do not hide it in fluffy words. Billy has always been reckless. I do not know if I will live through this; I don't know if I will ever see you again.\" \"Then stay,\" she said softly. \"Stay here, Chavez.\" He smiled sadly and shook his head, \"I cannot. Your mother was right about one thing – I AM an outlaw. I cannot live like a normal person. My only chance is to escape. My best chances are in old Mexico.\" Laisha stared into the dark lands before her. \"But that's so far away...\" she softly said. One of his hands caressed her check. \"Laisha...\" She looked back into his eyes. \"Yes, please kiss me Chavez.\" Chavez gingerly let go of her hand, letting it fall slowly. He stood up and pulled her up with him. One hand went to her upper back, and his other hand cradled her neck, fingers splayed out, each gently touching her. His face dove down to her small oval one. His lips touched her with such a passion that she wrapped her fingers around his waist. She felt inexperienced and awkward as he lips parted hers and coaxed her tongue out to meet his. But soon she fell into suit as he moved his head to change things up. It was bliss. Laisha's body grew warm under Chavez's touch. She would never be able to think of mass the same way ever again after this night. He was the one to pull away and she found herself wanting more. He sat her down on the bench gracefully, but she was the one to reach for him this time. She tugged on the front of his shirt. Chavez smirked at her, \"Did you enjoy yourself?\" She nodded, her eyes wide and honest. He leaned forward and his arms encircled her neck. \"I don't like it when hair is pulled back like this.\" He pulled out a few pins and helped her hair fall down. The dark chocolate waves fell about her shoulders and down to the middle of her back. She looked back up at him. He smiled, \"That's better.\" He stroked one of her locks for a moment and leaned forward. \"I think women look much more beautiful when their hair is down.\" \"Do I look beautiful Chavez?\" Chavez smiled, \"Of course you do.\" Why did she have a feeling that he didn't mean it completely? Or maybe her insecurities were getting the best of her and Chavez meant it. \"Do you mean it, Chavez? Paulita Maxwell is considered the beauty of the village.\" Chavez tipped her chin up to him and kissed her softly. \"I do mean it, chica. You are beautiful.\" She smiled and threw her arms around him. Yes, it probably seemed rather childish, but it did mean a lot. \"I don't believe I've ever had this much confidence.\" She pulled back. \"How can it be that we've known each other less than six hours? You've already had a profound effect on me.\" He laughed, \"Glad I could help.\" \"Please, tell me more about yourself...that is if you want to.\" Chavez looked back up to the sky. \"There is so much that is to my life, it would be impossible to tell it in a few hours.\" \"Speak whatever you like, and leave out all the rest.\" Chavez proceeded to tell her about the massacre that he and his family were involved in. Now Laisha understood why he had become ridged when he asked her those questions pertaining to being a teacher. He talked about a man by the name of John Tunstall, who Chavez swore saved his life by teaching him a way to bury hate without hurting anyone. It was John's murder that had sentenced him to a life as an outlaw. Seven of them set out to capture those who killed John Tunstall, but four of them died in the process, and one of the four had been a traitor all along. \"Did you ever get this Murphy fellow?\" \"Billy took him down with one shot to the head from a great distance away. Billy, Doc, and myself went our separate ways, but now we find ourselves back here again in New Mexico. I thought the nightmare was over with when we all left, but it seems it will never end. I fear my fate will end in blood.\" \"Maybe, but maybe not. I guess...I guess you don't seem the kind of person who believes in fate. We make our on paths on fortune's wheel, and every different path creates a new wheel.\" She glanced to the side of Chavez, watching the lamps of the village being put out. \"Is it...really that late?\" Chavez turned around to see what she was looking at. \"What time is it then?\" \"It'd be around eight o'clock.\" \"When do you normally go to bed?\" She stared at him for a second, a little shocked. He held his hands up and smiled. \"I just want to make sure you get home in time so your mother doesn't throw a fit.\" She felt relieved by his intentions, and sighed. \"Well, sadly, I go to bed around nine.\" Chavez nodded. \"Then I'll escort you back to your home.\" He stood up and offered her his hand. \"So soon?\" she asked while she took his hand and stood up. \"She'll have a temper tantrum when she sees me taking you back to your place, but she can't accuse me of keeping you out past your bedtime,\" he laughed quietly. \"I guess...\" she murmured. But she latched onto his arm. She didn't want this to be over with so soon. Before she knew it they were standing in front of her home. \"So...is this goodbye then Jose Chavez y Chavez?\" Chavez smiled at her softly, \"Possibly. Maybe someday I'll come back, when the outlaw life has died down.\" All she could do was nod. What could she say? She had already asked him to stay, but he was right. He was an outlaw and he would be hunted. If he could reach Mexico, maybe he could survive. And throughout many years, maybe he would look back on this day. With two hands on either side of her neck, Chavez bent down to kiss her. He parted her lips, deepening he kiss. She gladly kissed him back, clinging to his shirt. After a few moments, he pulled back. He smiled down at her, his thumb caressing her cheek bone. \"Please don't forget me,\" she choked out. \"Never.\" \"And even if you do not meet again someday, I'll always remember you Chavez. I want to be a better person because of you.\" \"Glad I could help. And thank you for giving me an evening of peace and happiness. God knows I'll need it in the days to come.\" She nodded and smirked, \"Glad I could help.\" She wiped away a quick tear, \"Goodbye Chavez.\" \"Goodbye Laisha.\" Laisha stood on her toes and kissed him gently. She pulled away and walked to her door and opened it. Laisha heard her mother start to yell at her from the backyard. But it didn't faze her. She turned around and gazed into Chavez's eyes for a fleeting moment before she closed the door. She leaned against it, wanting to cry heavily. There was a heavy and sad feeling that sat upon her heart. Chavez walked to the door and touched it gently with his fingertips. He looked at the ground before letting go and trudging back to Beever Smiths. He knew Billy, possibly Doc, and company would all question him. And despite the fact that Laisha was back in her home, he would defend her from snarky Dave and anyone else until the day he died.[Chapter 3] Greetings everyone! Thank you for your patience! It's been over six months since part 2! I wasn't able to post these next few parts right away because from July 20th to Aug 15th, I was in Ireland! That's right! Ireland! It was for school – I took two classes over there and got 6 credits! The classes were Irish Literature and Craft of Fiction writing (except mine was an independent study due to the fact that I already took that class)! It was 3 ½ weeks in Dublin and Galway! I was there long enough to really enjoy myself, but for those last few days, I really wanted to come home. Plus a guy I had been seeing on the side (an old friend - someone I had known since high school) decided to break up with me whilest I was in Dublin. Yeah, was crushed at first few days, then was mad for months, but now I know it's his loss. Moving on from personal life...! I also was extremely busy with 15 credit hours of classes Fall semester, plus I was looking into doing an internship at Disney...but it started getting way too complicated. But I graduated! I officially have a B.A. in English, and a minor in Creative Writing! Huzzah! Unfortunately, they discontinued the Film Studies minor I was working on due to a high surge of incoming freshmen...whyfor always the good classes have to be cut first! My sound advice - go to community college for your beginning college classes – it's a lot cheaper and you get a lot more one-on-one time with the professors, and really good grades if you dedicate yourself to your studies (I got tons of A's and B's, and only one C and one D). Rant complete. And now I'm looking for a job so I can pay back student loans... On a Fan Ficy note! I am working hard at the Young Guns sequel! Not joshing you! I scribbled in my notebook all semester because when I'm not writing, ideas come most of the time, and I had to figure out a way to stay awake in classes. In fact, I'm coming so close to the end, that I'm gathering ideas on how the end will play out. Now, I just have to type it all up, and I'll start posting after my read through. It does need editing, badly, because I started working on it right after I finished Setting of the Sun ...so it's been, nearly six years in the making. Yeah, I will have a lot to sort through. But bear with me. Anyways, on with the story! For disclaimers, please see chapter one. Part 3 of 6. Enjoy! A Small Measure of Peace *~-|-~*~-|-~*Chapter Three*~-|-~*~-|-~* Laisha cried silent tears as she sat in the tub her mother forced her to take. He mother was furious that she spent time with Chavez alone and unsupervised. On top of it all, her mother said she smelled like a pig and ordered to her take a bath. \"Oh stop crying; a bath won't kill you,\" Maria Pia snapped as she came back into the private area next to the house. She poured hot water into the tub and shook her head when Laisha hissed. \"It's only water. Anyways, hurry up. Your father isn't going to spend all night over at the Maxwell's.\" She walked away. Laisha pick up the soap and sponge weakly. She lathered the sponge weakly and sorrow took over. She was washing away Chavez. After a thorough cleaning (because she knew her mother would notice), Laisha put on her nightdress and laid down in her cot, pulling the curtain closed so neither her mother nor father could see her. She hugged her straw-stuffed pillow and fell asleep, crying. The rooster called to the sun before Laisha knew it. Because her mother had taken away the one from yesterday, she was forced to wear a different shirt and skirt. If she had her way, she would wear pants. Skirts were so pointless while gardening. She poured some water from a pitcher into a small basin and washed her face and neck. It was time for another day. And that was when memories from last night flowed back into her mind. Even though she had her good, heartfelt cry last night, she still grimaced to keep her from weeping again. She walked out into the garden and looked over the potato rows. The plants looked rather dry. \"Mother, I'm going to go get some water for the plants,\" she called. But she didn't wait for her Maria Pia's response. Laisha grabbed the bucket and made her way to the well. The morning was still young. Only a handful of people, including her, were out and about this morning. The sun reflected gold and red into the sky, chasing away the moon. She looked around her, making sure she wouldn't hit anyone this time, but all she could see was the crazy chickens running around. She lifted the lid to the well and lowered the bucket down. When she felt it fill up with water, she pulled it back up, emptying it into her own bucket. She closed the lid and placed the bucket on top. She squatted down and picked up her bucket with both hands. It seemed as though she was sliding her feet forward. \"Com'mon Billy! We're losing daylight!\" Laisha's head jerked up and she nearly dropped her bucket, so she sat it down. She saw Billy's posse at their horses, but her eyes wandered from person to person until she saw him. Chavez was checking the straps on his horse. \"Oh shut up Dave. We're moving, okay? Besides, this ain't your gang, so back off!\" Billy shouted back at Arkansas Dave. The young men mounted their horses within seconds of each other. Except Pat walked out of Beever's. \"Well boys, take care and good luck. Heaven knows your gonna need it.\" Why wasn't he going with them? Pat and Billy had been together on adventures for a while now. \"Thanks Pat,\" Doc answered back. \"Find your way back home, okay Doc? I'm sure your wife is frightened to death.\" \"I'm sure she is. Take care of yourself Pat.\" \"Later boys.\" Pat turned and headed back into Beever's. \"Ready regulators?\" Billy smiled nostalgically. Doc sighed and rolled his eyes, \"Yes.\" \"Ready when you are Chivato,\" Chavez answered. \"Let's move out,\" Billy said and he tapped his horse. One by one, Laisha watched the leave. Hendry French and Chavez hung back for a moment. Please see me please see me , she begged with all her heart. It lerched forward when she saw him look around. Chavez made eye contact with her. His horse moved from side to side, eager to go, but he held her eyes. Laisha wanted to run to him, beg him not to leave, but she knew that wasn't her place. She was certain he could read her sadness within her eyes because he sent her a look that she read as caring. Her heart was breaking all over again. \"Chavez?\" Hendry asked, looking between Chavez and her. She couldn't hold him to her anymore. She gave him a half-hearted, small smile and mouthed the word 'Goodbye'. He stared at her for a moment longer. He was like an ancient warrior going off to battle; leaving the one he loved behind, knowing he would never see them again. 'Goodbye' he mouthed back to her. \"Gyaah!\" he shouted and pushed his horse into a full run with Hendry trailing behind. Laisha watched him leave and disappear from the entryway. She picked up her bucket and went back to the garden. She watered the potatoes until the bucket was empty. Hugging her sides, she fell to her knees, and once again cried. Her heart was broken. He haunted her dreams. His smile, his touch, his voice, everything. She awoke nearly every night, swearing she felt him holding her. To once again she would give a few tears out. Her prayers and wish were only for him and his well being. She continued her life in the garden and with the chickens. Maria Pia would darn socks, pants, and whatever she needed too. Her father would come home from the Maxwell's with his day's wages around dinner time, and they would all sit together to eat. But Maria Pia and Jesus did most of the talking. Laisha preferred not to talk when around her mother, which was virtually all the time. One eveing, both her and her mother snapped. Maria Pia gazed at one of Laisha's skirts. \"How did you manage to get this hole here?\" Silence. \"AHH!\" Maria Pia yelled and threw Laisha's skirt at her. \"Say something you stupid girl!\" Laisha picked up the skirt. \"You horrible woman! You hag! It's because of you he didn't stay!\" Okay, that wasn't true, but who would want Maria Pia for a mother-in-law? \"Back to that Indian again!\" \"His name is Chavez!\" \"I don't care what his name is! He is gone and there is nothing left to discuss!\" \"NO!\" Laisha yelled. He rushed over to the kitchen table with the skirt. She grabbed the knife her father always carried with him. \"What are you doing!\" Maria Pia whispered, backing away. \"You should be afraid mother,\" Laisha laughed darkly. She spread the skirt our on the table. Once it was even, she stabbed the middle of the dress. \"What on God's green earth are you doing!\" This time she was more furious at the dress. \"Making a god-damn pair of pants!\" Laisha pulled and ripped the fabric until she reached the bottom. On her own time, she sowed the cloth to make her first pair of pants. She didn't care anymore. In two days she was pulling weeds in the garden and feeding chickens in loose bloomers. News broke out in the village. Terrible news. The Santa Fe Ring had hired themselves a sheriff to bring in Billy the Kid, and anyone who accompanied him. The villagers kept their eyes open for any bizarre strangers, anyone who looked out of place. \"Here you go Father,\" Laisha said as she handed her father the sandwich her mother had made for him. \"Thank you Laisha.\" He took a large bite out of the sandwich. \"I'll see you when you get home,\" Laisha was about to leave the Maxwell property when Paulita came running in. \"Terrible! It's just terrible!\" Paulita cried. \"Paulita, what is it!\" Laisha begged. Paulita was bursting into tears. \"Pat Garret! He's the one the Santa Fe Ring hired! He's a good tracker! He's going after Billy, the man I love!\" Paulita took hold of Laisha and began crying. Laisha stood there, shocked. \"Chavez,\" she whispered. When Paulita let go of Laisha and ran into her home, Laisha marched into town. She saw Pat standing with his horse, waiting for godot. Adrenaline pulsed through her veins and she marched right up to him. \"Pat Garret! Of all the traitors written about in history, you will go down as the worst of the worst!\" Pat tipped his hat to her, \"And a good day to you too, Miss Laisha.\" \"Don't you 'Miss Laisha' me you traitor!\" she growled. Days ago she never would have dreamt of talking to anyone like this, with the exception of her mother of course. Any smile from his face disappeared, and the two became engaged in a stare down. \"I have a chance to redeem myself. You really think I'd turn it down?\" \"By betraying your best friend? Not a smart move. And letting yourself get hired by the Ring! How low can you possibly go!\" \"I have my reasons Laisha. I'm a sheriff now, and I can finally follow through with my dream of one day becoming a well respected citizen.\" \"You have no respect in this town. Get out! Go back to Lincoln, where your kind belongs!\" She spat at his feet and walked away from the traitor who might very well gun Billy down. This had been the warning she had felt when she begged Chavez to stay with her. Chavez was in danger, and Laisha could do nothing but just hope.[Chapter 4] For all disclaimers, please see chapter one. Greeting my fellow Gunners. My apologies for this late post...by over a year. So much has happened! Last March, I got a job as a Children's Librarian two towns away, so that's kept me really busy. Personal life wise, mehh, the same as before. I got a new computer back in August! Dell Insipron 660, with over 900 GB of memory and 6 GB of RAM; plus a fancy Dell LED HD 26 inch monitor; and a new comfort curve keyboard from Microsoft. Yes, yes I am a nerd. It's so nice to spend time on the computer without the fear of overheating, and be able to just do normal things without tons of lag time. Still got the laptop, but my new Windows 7 desktop is my baby right now. Plus, I've become a gamer in this last year. I love my Wii (my first gaming system ever in my life) and computer games - specifically Dragon Age II, LotR Online, Prince of Persia, Aragon's Quest, the many Lego games... Why yes, I am a super geek. Thank you for all the wonderful people who leave reviews! And the people have added this to a watch list / alert list, or a favourite! Pixie sticks of all of you! And Beth! It is LOVELY to see you back up on FF! Yes, her mother is horrible. At the time I wrote this story, ala 2008/09, I was having some major fights with my parents on a daily basis because I was 20/21 years old, and getting quite frustrated living at home (I was ready to leave home for dorm living at university). Of course, student loans haunt me now, so I'm back at home. Luckily, much less fighting. ^_^ When writing this part...oh man! Between listening to \"Come Josephine in My Flying Machine\" from the Back to Titanic soundtrack and the last two tracks from The Last Samurai soundtrack on repeat... I didn't want to the momentum of sorrow. I hope you feel it too! FYI, I cried like crazy when writing this...so I'm issuing a tissue watch...just in case. Part 4 of 6. Enjoy! A Small Measure of Peace *~-|-~*~-|-~*Chapter Four*~-|-~*~-|-~* Time went by. It had been over a week since Laisha saw Chavez, and she wondered if she'd ever get over the brief love affair they had had. But from what she heard from Paulita, no one ever got over their first love. Never. So Laisha felt doomed to remain heartsick until she finally moved on. At night, she heard her mother and father discussing her future to marry Eduardo, a local young man in Old Fort Sumner. Maybe it would be a good thing, but not at this moment. Eduardo was nice and polite, but Laisha was still involved with Chavez, emotionally. One day, in the early afternoon, she heard a little commotion in town, but as she headed to the door to check it out, her mother blocked the way. She said that someone rode in saying they had shot a Mexican dog trying to kill some of his cattle, and warned the other farmers to be aware. Disappointed, Laisha headed back to the garden and worked some more. That evening, her mother had been the one to volunteer to get the water, which confused her greatly. Seconds after her mother left, her father came storming in. \"Laisha!\" Laisha stood up from the ground and wiped her hands on the apron on her dress. Heading into the house, her father came out and pulled her inside. He tossed a wet cloth at her. \"Clean yourself up! Is your mother here?\" \"No. Is Eduardo here or something?\" she asked as she wiped her face and neck, dirt turning to mud from the water. \"No no no! Laisha, it's Chavez. He rode back in this afternoon with Hendry!\" \"What!?\" she gasped as she quickened her actions. \"Mother said the commotion was from some rancher warning against some dogs killing his cattle!\" \"Oh Maria Pia what have you done?\" He whispered to himself. \"No, now quick. He's at Beevers! Billy just rode in a few minutes ago, and I saw Chavez inside.\" Why didn't he come to see me? She wondered. Was something wrong? \"Thank you papa! I'm going to see him!\" She rushed out the door and down the street. \"I'll hold your mother off for you!\" Jesus yelled. She ran at Beever's place, and shoved aside the mangled curtain. \"Chavez,\" she called. What she saw before her confused and frightened her to no avail. Hendry and Billy sat across from each other at a table. They looked up at her, she looked between them hurriedly. \"Where's Chavez?\" Billy stood up and walked to the door. \"Where is Chavez?\" Her fear began to set in, and panic was eating at her. \"Please,\" she begged in a whispered voice. Billy stood at the doorway, leaning against the frame. He spun the barrel of his gun. \"He's heading to the graveyard.\" It was as though lightning had struck her. There was an emptiness in Billy's voice; and she glanced at his eyes, and saw them void of all emotion, almost near the idea of shock. She glanced back at Hendry. Hendry caught her eyes and she saw they were glistening. She turned back to Billy and gulped. Her fear was true. \"The graveyard...\" she echoed. \"Garrett got him. Got him good.\" Billy looked away, ashamed. \"He's dying, Miss Laisha,\" Hendry said softly. \"No...\" she whispered out of despair and backed out of Beever's. \"My pal is strong, but not that strong. No one deserves to die alone,\" Billy said to her while still looking down at the ground. He didn't need to finish. No one wanted to die alone, no matter what they said. Laisha turned on her heals and ran. Little clouds of dirt upturned from her slick bottom shoes. Within moments she rounded a corner and saw a cloaked figure staggering to the graveyard entrance. \"Chavez,\" she choked out. The figure stopped and turned to her. There she beheld his face, and his failing eyes. They searched for her. \"Laisha?\" Laisha dashed to his side and put his arm around her shoulders. \"I'm so sorry! I didn't know you were back. My mother kept me home; I didn't know, I didn't know.\" He cracked a half smile. \"Leave it to your mother.\" He nodded to a small outcove ahead of him. \"Please, let's go there.\" She walked with him, making sure to keep her pace steady with his. She glanced down and saw the wound in his stomach. A large stain of dry, dark amber was surrounded wet red. \"Chavez?\" she asked quietly. \"It doesn't hurt much anymore.\" He smiled at her. \"Laisha?\" \"Yes Chavez?\" \"May I lie against you?\" \"Of course Chavez.\" She felt tears forming, so she forced her eyes to stay open, hoping the dry air would soak up the liquid. She helped him to the ground. There she positioned herself so that his face rested on her chest. \"Are you comfortable?\" \"Yes,\" he breathed out. Unlike last time when she had been the one to cling to him, this time his hands and arms were wrapped around her. \"Feels nice.\" Like a mother, she wrapped her arms around him too. \"Good, that's good.\" \"Do you regret this?\" She was confused. \"What?\" Chavez looked up at her. \"I met you, advanced on you, and left you, but now here I am again, dying.\" She looked down on him and smiled sadly. \"Oh no Chavez. I don't regret any of this, and I'd never take it back. You have actually helped me make a very important decision in my life.\" \"What did I do?\" She beamed at him. \"I'm going to be a nurse, Chavez. I'm going to help people when they're sick. I want to hold their hand and calm their uneasiness.\" \"Like this.\" Chavez reached his hand out for her and she took it gently. \"Chavez, how long have you been wounded?\" He was silent for a moment, \"I was shot this morning.\" \"And you arrived here this afternoon?\" \"Late afternoon.\" Guilt was building in her stomach. \"Could I have saved you?\" she bit her lip. If her mother had prevented her from helping Chavez, of there would be hell for her mother to pay. \"No chica. The Spirit Horse calls me home. My mother, my brothers, sisters, and all those I loved slain at Red Sands...they call to me. I think this was my time.\" \"Have I given you anything, Chavez? You made me realized what I want to do in life. I've never felt this way before about anyone; you've left a mark on me. But did I accomplish something for you.\" Chavez took a sharp breath and grimaced. \"You have...in my life, you have given me a small measure of peace. You have reawakened in me the hope that there is still good in this hell of life.\" She stroked his hair, trying all she could to ease his pain. \"I care about you so much. I wish...I wish...\" \"I wish I would have stayed, like you suggested.\" He attempted to laugh, but broke into a cough. Red trickled out of the corner of his mouth. Her heart froze. \"Chavez,\" she swallowed. She let the gathering tears in her eyes fall. He tilted his head to look up at her. \"Oh please don't cry.\" He broke his hand away from hers. His hand touched a tear that was rolling down its own path. \"I hate seeing you suffer like this,\" she choked out. \"I wish I could do something.\" \"You are. You're here. That's...all I need.\" He sighed weakly. \"I'm so selfish. I want you to stay, but I know you can't.\" She tried her best to hold in the sobs that wanted to escape her, and it was slowly becoming difficult. She leaned over and kissed Chavez softly. \"Jose Chavez y Chavez, I will never, ever forget you.\" \"Hey,\" he smiled weakly, \"You remembered my full name. No one really does.\" He closed his eyes, \"Can you sing to me Laisha?\" He moved his head to face her again. \"Please.\" Laisha leaned over and planted a kiss on his forehead. \"I'll remember it forever Chavez.\" She gently moved a strand of hair from his face and moved it to the other side of his shoulder. Come Josephine, in my flying machine. And it's up she goes, up she goes. Come Josephine, in my flying machine. Going up she goes, up she goes. Balance yourself like a bird on a beam, In the air she goes; there she goes. Up, up, a little bit higher. Oh, my! The moon is on fire. Come Josephine, in my flying machine. Going up, all on, \"Goodbye.\" Laisha felt Chavez's breathing become ragged and breaths slow and sallow. Tears fell freely now. He was starting to leave her. Oh, say, Let us fly, girl. Where, dear? To the sky, girl. Oh, you flying machine. Jump in Miss Josephine. Come Josephine, in my flying machine. Going up, all on, \"Goodbye.\" When Chavez didn't speak, she was frightened. Only the feel of his breaths told her he was still alive. \"Laisha...\" She could barely get out the words \"Yes Chavez?\" \"I can hear them. I can hear my family's voices.\" \"Th-they must be happy to know you're coming,\" she choked out. \"They are...\" His eyes looked up at her. \"I'll miss you.\" She smiled halfheartedly. \"I'll miss you too.\" His eyes glanced to the sky. \"I can hear it; the Spirit Horse...\" Chavez let out a long breath and his weak body let go. His stained hands fell from her, tumbling to the sandy, brown dirt. \"Cha...vez? Chavez?\" She gently shook him. \"Chavez?\" Laisha gathered him up in her arms and rocked him. \"No...no! Please, oh please no…\" She looked at the same sky he had only seconds ago. It was full of hues of pink, orange, purple, and blue. Wispy clouds in horizontal lines sat in the sky. This was his sky, and it would always be his sky. Laisha fiddled with a sleeve on her dress. She had already read a dime-cent novel three times and it would have been too predictable if she read it again. She had nothing to ease the boredom on the train rides from Lincoln to Santa Fe to Denver. The thought of the city loomed before her, and her nerves were in panic mode. It had been raining all day, and the windows were streaked and spotted with rain droplets. \"Laisha?\" Laisha threw her eyes over at Hendry. \"Yes?\" \"Are you all right?\" She smiled slightly, \"Just nerves.\" Hendry closed his book. \"It's going to be okay. You've got the job. He'd be very happy for you.\" \"I know...\" She gazed into the cloudy sky. Would he be? Within moments of Chavez's death, she grew up. No more clinging to her childhood. She was a woman now. She wasn't sure if what she felt was true love for Chavez. It may have been a deep friendship; a devotion. Or maybe one of the seven deadly sins, known as lust. But she had truly cared about him. She had wanted his well being above all else. When Hendry has whispered those words to her, her heart cracked. With every step she ran, with every dust cloud she cause and every object or person she had dodged around, the crack traveled quickly down her heart. When he slipped away in her arms, her heart shattered like a rock through the perfect stained glass window. Every aspect and color of her heart fell to the ground, turning into nothing but a million pieces. Laisha glanced over at the entrance of the graveyard. Billy hung back, but Hendry slowly walked forward. \"Is he...?\" She nodded. Hendry looked over at Billy and nodded. She watched Billy walk hesitantly to the graveyard. Hendry ended up pushing him forward slightly. They both bent down and gazed at their fallen friend. Billy swallowed. \"Did he...was he in pain?\" She looked back at Chavez and gently stroked the wisps of hair matted on his forehead. She shook her head, \"I don't think so. He was quiet. I sang to him a little. He said he could hear his family...could hear the hooves of the spirit horse.\" She bit her trembling bottom lip. \"Was he happy when he was with you?\" Billy fell back. \"No,\" he whispered. \"We lost Doc. Doc and Chavez were the closest of pals, better than I was to either of them. He tried to save Doc, but Doc wanted to finish the game...\" Billy gazed off to a memory that had only happened less than a day ago. \"While Chavez was getting away, he was shot by one of Pat's men. Dave wanted to go without him, but I couldn't leave him. If I had known how bad he was hurt, I would have helped him right away. But even though he said was fine, he was hunched over...\" Hendry looked at his friend. \"He was a good man all the way to the end.\" Laisha hugged Chavez to her, \"Thank you for making sure he made it back.\" Billy snapped back to reality. \"How should we...with his body?\" ","Summary":" June 28, 2011 edit: Thank you to my two wonderful reviewers (moony1981 and Mizue-chan, and whoever "},{"Movie":"Top Gun","Title":"I Need You","Author":"DarkAlice0342","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8817078","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I Need You Top Gun Maverick/O.C. Disclaim: I Do NOT Own Top Gun, I only own Ally ** Ally's eyes shot up at the sound of her phone ringing. She turned on her bedside lamp and rubbed her eyes. She looked at her alarm clock. 2:45 A.M. She let out a grunt. 'Who would be calling me at this time?' She wanted to turn off the light, cover her head with her pillow and go right back to sleep; but there was probably a reason someone was calling her at this time. She sat up, picked up the phone and pressed it to her. \"Hello?\" \"Al,\" She recognized Maverick's voice. \"Mav,\" \"Al, something happened.\" She heard the tears in his voice and knew instantly something was wrong. \"Al,\" She heard his voice shudder. \"Mav, what is it? What's wrong?\" \"It's Goose,\" Ally shot up in her bed and gripped the phone tighter. Her knuckles broad white. \"What happened? Is he all right?\" \"He's dead. Al, Goose's dead.\" Ally felt like she was hit right in the chest with a ton of bricks. The tears slipped from her eyes. She couldn't imagine how Maverick was feeling right now. \"Mav, are you all right?\" He gave her a fake laugh. \"No, not really.\" \"Where are you?\" \"I'm still at the base.\" Ally wiped the tears from her eyes. \"Al, I need you. I need you so much right now.\" \"Ok, I'm coming.\" She hung up, wiped the tears from her eyes, and grabbed the keys to her Jeep. Ally looked at Maverick. He was still looking out the window of her Jeep. He had been quite for the entire ride. She wanted to say something, anything to make his pain go away. She knew what it was like to lose a friend, but she knew he felt like it was his fault. She pulled up to his apartment, turned off her Jeep and looked at Maverick. He was already looking at her. \"You're staying at my place tonight. I just want you to go ahead and get whatever you need.\" He did a simple nod and got out the Jeep. When he was in his apartment, she let her un-shed tears for Goose slip from her eyes. Ally and Maverick pulled up at Ally's house. She turned off the Jeep and looked at Maverick. He didn't even look at her. He got out the Jeep, grabbed his bag and walked toward her house. She knew it was going to be a long night. Ally made up a bed for Maverick on the sofa, while he walked in the bathroom. Maverick let the hot water run down his back. He couldn't get the images of Goose's death out of his head. He ran a hand through his wet, short, black hair. Maverick let out a deep sigh. He knew it wasn't fair to Ally to use up all of her hot water. He turned the tap off and stepped out of the shower. He grabbed a fresh white towel from the towel rack and was about to wrap it around himself, until he caught his reflection in the mirror. 'Why did Goose have to die? Why was I being so stupid? He would be alive if it wasn't for me.' He jumped a little when he heard a knock at the bathroom door. He grabbed a pair of boxers and long, grey sweat pants. He pulled them on and draped the towel around his shoulders. He walked to the door and cracked it. Ally was standing there. \"Al,\" \"Hey, are you okay?\" \"I'll be fine.\" \"Okay,\" She walked away and he closed the door. He rested his back against the wooden door. Maverick walked out of the bathroom. Ally looked at him as soon as he walked in the living room and she felt her mouth drop. He was wearing a pair of worn sweats that hugged his body nicely, a tanned upper body, broad shoulders, dark nipples, a flat stomach, little bit of black chest hair, and a little patch of hair that led...down there. He gave her a weak smile. \"Hey, Al.\" She gave him a simple smile. \"Hey,\" He walked over to her and sat next to her on the couch. She looked at him. She grabbed his hand and gave it a gentle squeeze. He looked at their joined hands. He looked at her. \"Ally, I've never wanted to lead you on. I just want you to know that we're just friends.\" Ally felt like this great weight put so much pressure on her chest. She gave him a simple nod and a fake smile. She released his hand and got up. \"I'll see you in the morning. My room's the last door on the left.\" She turned around and went to her room, before he could say anything. Ally layed in her bed with her back to her bedroom door. She didn't really care if he was hurting right now, she didn't want to see him right now. She wiped the tears from her eyes. He was such a jerk! He always flirted with her. He always did that and now she wanted to comfort him, but he really wouldn't let her. Her bedroom opened. \"Ally Al,\" She gripped her pillow. Hot tears ran down her face. She turned and looked. Maverick was standing there, leaning against the door frame. 'He better have a good reason to be in here!'

Chapter 2 Maverick walked in, closing the door behind him. \" We need to talk.\" She looked away from him. \" About what?\" He walked over to the bed and sat at the edge of the bed. He put his hand on her leg. She gripped her pillow. She didn't want him touching her. She wanted him to just leave. \" Ally, you've got to talk to me some time, because I don't plan on leaving.\" She wiped the tears from her eyes and sat up. He shook his head when he saw the look on her face. \" Come on, Ally Al. Don't do that.\" He made a gesture to wipe her face, but she kept her face out of his reach. He let out a deep sigh and placed his hand on his lap. He looked down at the hand in his lap. \" Ally, I'm sorry.\" She shook her head. \" No, you're not.\" He felt his blood boiling. The only thing he hated about Ally was her stubbornness. \" Yes, I am.\" \" No, you're not.\" He couldn't take it. He gripped her upper arms and pulled her to him. She gasped at his sudden actions. She felt her cheeks immediately flush red. She noticed how close they were. The only thing keeping them apart was her short, pink nightdress and his long, grey sweat pants. He wrapped his arms around her and hugged her to him. She felt his warm breath near her ear. \" I'm sorry.\" She didn't know what she could say. He pulled away and looked at her. His eyes locked with her's. He didn't know what it was, but it was type of force pulling him toward her. Her eyes slid close as he pressed his lips to her's. Her hands wandered to his short, black hair. She layed back on the bed and he layed on top of her. She felt his mouth gently work on opening her mouth. His tongue started battling with her's. She smiled against his mouth. She knew that this was a good way for him to apologize to her. DarkAlice0342: Oh, they made up:) YAY!

Drip. Drip. The ceiling of the aircraft carrier was leaking. This would normally be a source of concern for the two pilots in the hallway, but they were otherwise occupied crouching by the door of Stinger's office and trying desperately to figure out what was going on inside. \"I think she said, 'my Ritalin is more important to me',\" Maverick whispered. \"My children , Mav. Here -\" Goose nudged her out of the way and pressed her ear to the doorknob. \"Let me know when your ears pop, okay? We can communicate by semaphore in the meantime.\" \"Hey,\" Maverick complained, scooting back a little. \"'I can't do this anymore,'\" Goose quoted. \"Whoa. Is she -\" At that moment the door opened in Goose's face and she leapt backward, crashing into Maverick, who was so close on her heels that she fell back on the battleship linoleum with a yelp. \"What are you two doing?\" Cougar looked between them. \"Uh,\" Goose said, scrambling to her feet. Maverick followed suit. \"Noth - nothing?\" \"Whatever. She's expecting you in there,\" Cougar said, jabbing her thumb in the general direction of the door. \"I'll see you guys,\" she added, disappearing around the corner. \"What the hell was that about?\" Maverick said, dusting herself off and zipping up her flight suit a little. \"Lieutenants Bradshaw and Mitchell,\" Stinger called from her inner sanctum. \"Quit horsing around and get in here, goddamnit.\" Maverick and Goose exchanged a look. \"Last chance to desert and become Cuban barmaids,\" Goose offered. Maverick rolled her eyes and they both entered Stinger's office - warily, because she was prone to flinging small objects when angry. \"Well,\" said Stinger. \"I have some bad news.\" Maverick shifted her weight back and forth, eyebrows creeping toward each other in confusion. Goose cleared her throat and threw a glance at the door. \"For me, not you,\" Stinger added. \"Cougar just quit.\" \"Quit what, ma'am?\" \"Her job at Steak and Shake. The Navy , Goose, you blithering moron. She turned in her wings.\" Goose ducked as if expecting said wings to be thrown at her face. Stinger rolled her eyes. \"Anyway, she was the first in line to attend TOPGUN,\" Stinger said, \"and that's all kind of shot to hell now. You two assholes were second.\" \"We what?\" Goose responded. \"Ma'am?\" Maverick tipped her head forward and let a curtain of dark hair slide over her face in a half-assed attempt to hide her spreading grin. \"You're going to TOPGUN,\" Stinger said. It obviously pained her to say it. Goose looked befuddled. Maverick slid her phone seemingly out of the ether and fired off an all-caps, grammatically sub-par text message to everyone in their squadron: WERE GOING TO TOPGUN! WHOOOOO! :D \"Mitchell, what the hell are you doing?\" Stinger demanded. \"Nothing, ma'am,\" Maverick replied, clearing her throat and sliding her phone back from whence it came. \"You know, I knew you were trouble the first time you stepped foot on my deck. Just like your mother.\" There was a certain wistfulness to this statement that gave a new and vaguely disconcerting meaning to trouble . Maverick missed it, however, because her body was vibrating with excitement and every synapse in her brain was firing the same message wildly. TOP GUN! her very mitochondria screamed. \"So,\" Goose said, finally seeming to clue in on what was happening. \"When do we leave?\" \"Tuesday,\" Stinger said, and launched into a tirade of blah blah blah your actions reflect on me and if you fuck up I swear I will tear your arms off and make them into soup and feed that soup to homeless people and then pay those homeless people to beat the crap out of you blah blah dog shit Hong Kong cargo plane blah , all pops and buzzes barely punctuating the massive shield of Maverick's enthusiasm. She hadn't been this jazzed since Lucky Charms had introduced whale marshmallows. / Viper was not quite so jazzed. She had been faxed the final list of who was to attend the academy, and it looked like line after line of mediocrity. Where did they get these girls? she wondered. Yes, they were the best of the best, but by what standards? She had won ten medals, kicked a large amount of Russian ass, and fought in some of the most pivotal air battles of the decade, all by twenty-five. One name stood out to her, however, and she couldn't put her finger on why. Jester walked in and poured herself a cup of coffee. Having eschewed sunscreen in her twenties, Jester had aged faster than Viper, who looked alarmingly like Tina Fey - if Tina Fey wore aviators instead of glasses and had spent half her life in a tiny cockpit, barking orders at sweaty men hunched over radar screens. \"Paige Mitchell,\" Viper threw out. \"Hmm,\" Jester said, sipping her coffee. \"Any relation to Daisy?\" \" That's it,\" Viper crowed triumphantly, throwing the list onto her desk. \"Daisy Mitchell. Jesus, it's been forever since I heard that name.\" \"You flew with her?\" \"For years,\" Viper said. \"She had a stubborn streak a mile wide. Paige...\" she muttered. \"She was only fifteen when Daisy died.\" \"And now she's following in her footsteps,\" Jester said. \"Watch out,\" she added in a sing-songy voice, lighting a cigarette. \"I'll keep an eye on her,\" Viper grunted, adding a note on her iTouch: DEMON SEED TOUCHDOWN: 3 DAYS. / TOPGUN was not what Maverick had expected. Sure, what she had expected was an enormous marble complex with wall-to-wall jets - in other words, her usual patent lunacy - but it turned out to be the opposite of that. It was just a brick building with all of its doors propped open in the June heat, a large stretch of tarmac out back littered with the latest planes, and two big hangars. Driving by the base, you couldn't even see it. She hopped off her Ducati and waited for Goose, who had driven over in a rented Volvo. Her choice of cars had inspired the pimply teenage girl at the front desk of Enterprise's Miramar branch to refer to Goose as \"Edward\", for reasons that Maverick had yet to figure out. Pilots and RIOs were arriving in droves, strolling into the building with the particular fighter pilot swagger that rivaled that of rock stars. Maverick tried to look as nonchalant as possible. Damn straight you're at TOPGUN, she told herself. You're a badass. You're like a goddamn WWI flying ace. You shouldn't even be excited to be here. They should be excited to have you. That didn't really calm her down, but it helped somewhat. Goose finally rolled up and walked over. \"Why are you sitting on the curb? And why are you trembling?\" \"I was waiting for you,\" Maverick said. \"And I'm high on life. Wanna head in?\" Goose shook her head. \"I will never understand how you keep your cool facing death at thirty thousand feet and yet the very idea of walking into a building is giving you the shakes.\" \"It's not the shakes, \" Maverick shot back. \"I'm not a diabetic alcoholic. Jeez. Here.\" She handed her helmet to Goose, who tossed it in the general direction of her motorcycle. \"Since when do you wear a helmet?\" \"Since I got pulled over four times in the last two months,\" Maverick said. \"I just got off the phone with Carl,\" Goose said, as they walked into the barely air-conditioned main hallway of the academy. \"He forgot how to change a diaper. Sometimes I wonder if I'd have been better off marrying some random prehensile mammal.\" \"Oh, Carl,\" Maverick sighed. Once inside the dark little smoke-filled room the pilots had been instructed to crowd into, Maverick took a surreptitious look around. It was a pretty intimidating crowd. She rose onto her tiptoes a little. \"Who -\" she said, gesturing at a pilot and RIO pair in the corner. One was platinum blonde, wearing a cowboy hat and chewing something - tobacco? gum? It could have gone either way - and the other had a stack of Silly Bandz on her arm and was wearing a pair of Kanye-style shutter shades that were definitely not regulation. \"Ah,\" said Goose. \"Hollywood and Wolf. Two morons.\" \"Which is which?\" \"The Southern one is Wolf, the asshole is Hollywood. Actually - I know a lot of these girls,\" Goose added, looking around. \"Um - over there, the smarmy blonde, I remember her from flight school...\" Maverick didn't follow Goose's gaze - she was looking at the doorway, through which Viper had just entered. \"She looks familiar,\" she said, her eyebrows jumping together in confusion, as they were wont to do. \"Who, Icegirl? Oh, you mean Tina Fey over there? I think she's the base commander.\" \"Where -\" Maverick sighed. \"Damn. I know her from somewhere. Like...\" she bit her tongue. \"Have a seat, ladies,\" Viper called, breaking up the little circle that had formed around the afore-mentioned smarmy blonde, who was staring at Maverick. Maverick sat up front, the back of her neck prickling. \"Icegirl, you said?\" she muttered to Goose, but was interrupted as Viper hit the lights. / Icegirl didn't get excited by much. She wasn't the kind who hollered garbled declarations of jubilation over the comms, or flung herself at her RIO after making it out of a particularly rough battle . Sure, there were times when she was thanking God or whomever was responsible just to be alive, but unfortunately for Slider, she preferred handshakes to bear hugs. All things considered, though, she had smirked for twenty solid minutes after receiving the news about TOPGUN. Who wouldn't? Now that she was standing in the actual building, the initial happiness was being slowly replaced by insecure, competitively OCD I-need-to-win-I-need-to-win bullshit. Luckily for Icegirl, she loved that bullshit. As Slider blathered on about something or other, she caught a glimpse of Goose out of the corner of her eye and hit Slider with a sharp elbow. \"Mother Goose.\" \"Oh, yeah,\" Slider replied, running a hand through her hair. \"Huh. Wonder who she's flying with?\" The answer came through the door a half-second later, and Icegirl almost choked on her own spit. She was brunette and small - just your type , Slider would surely hiss later - with a slim, muscular frame, dark hair falling into her eyes. Half of it was up in a ribbon, the other half doing whatever the hell it wanted, in sharp contrast to the tight, hair-sprayed ponytails everyone else was sporting. Her eyes were liquid and Bambi-wide, some incomprehensible mix of green and blue that twisted Icegirl's intestines like balloon animals. Slider glanced at her, askance. \"What's wrong with you?\" \"Nothing,\" Icegirl breathed, poker face firmly back in place. Hollywood swaggered over. \"Checking out the competition?\" Slider bit back a comment that was more than likely a play on the first half of Hollywood's sentence. \"Who is that?\" Icegirl said, sliding her Navy ring up and down her finger. It was her only visible nervous tic, besides the pen-twirling thing. Hollywood slid her Kanye shades up and looked the mystery pilot up and down. \"Oh,\" she said, \" ho ho . That would be Maverick.\" She looked at Icegirl, as if to gauge her reaction. Icegirl stayed expressionless and lowered her aviators, in case her eyes were giving her away. \"I hear her callsign is pretty accurate,\" Hollywood added. Slider snorted. Icegirl said nothing. \"Hey, guys,\" Sundown said, coming over, her corkscrew curls bouncing in a cheerful way. Chipper tagged along behind her, completing the phalanx. \"Hey,\" they chorused. \"I also heard she had a nose job,\" Hollywood said. \"Who, Sundown?\" Wolf said, laughing as she entered the circle. \"Hmm?\" Sundown said, glancing up from her Blackberry. \"No, Maverick.\" \"Who's Maverick?\" Chipper said to no one in particular. \"Deviated septum,\" Hollywood said. It was obvious she was speaking directly to Icegirl at this point. \"It was doctor-mandated, so the story goes. I heard she broke it cheerleading in high school, or something equally bourgeois.\" \"Thank you, Ryan Seacrest,\" Slider snapped sarcastically. \"And there's the Penny Benjamin thing -\" \"Have a seat, ladies,\" Viper called out, cutting Hollywood off, who muttered \"I'll fill you in later\" to Icegirl. \"We don't care ,\" Slider said. \"I wasn't talking to you ,\" Hollywood snapped, slinging an arm around Wolf and heading for the back row. Slider snorted. Maverick met Icegirl's gaze suddenly, as if it had just dawned on her that someone was giving her the eye. Icegirl held it for a second and looked away as she took a seat next to Slider.[Chapter 2] \"In the technology day and age, when unmanned aircrafts are becoming the norm, there is a thin line standing in the way, preventing the United States military from being dominated by robotics. You are that line.\" The surround sound faded out as the informational video cut to black. The lights flicked on. Jester stepped aside and Viper began striding up the aisle. \"You are the best in your field,\" she said. \"Nowadays, girls, that's not saying much.\" Maverick cleared her throat. She could feel someone staring at her. \"But we will train you. Over the course of these eight weeks, you will become -\" \"Killing machines,\" Goose muttered. Maverick snorted. \"- better than the best, \" Viper continued. \"You'll be tougher, faster, but you'll know how to work with each other. That is the purpose of this program. That is something a computer can never do - work alongside its fellow pilot, feel their instincts. A computer would not go against the odds to save you.\" Maverick wondered briefly if that was a subtle reference to her, then thought, no, you're being stupid, she probably didn't even hear about that - \"However, only two of you will walk away with the TOPGUN title. One pilot, one RIO.\" Maverick shot a grin at Goose, who looked like she was about to barf. Viper began to drone about the \"rigors and challenges\" of TOPGUN, and Maverick zoned out almost immediately. She felt eyes on her neck again and turned. Icegirl was looking at her steadily, twirling a pen in her fingers. Maverick's heart skipped a couple of beats as they locked eyes, and she turned back around with an uncomfortably warm feeling in her stomach. \"Mav,\" Goose said as softly as possible. \"What?\" Maverick replied, feigning innocence. \"Stop it. What are you doing? Stop.\" \"I'm just wondering who here's going to have balls enough to really go head to head with me.\" \"Oh, God, what? We're not ice road truckers, Paige -\" \"'Scuse me, ladies,\" Viper said quietly. She had suddenly appeared before them and had her hand on Maverick's shoulder. \"Unless either of you happen to outrank me, I'd recommend staying quiet when I'm talking. No one here is TOPGUN quite yet, excluding myself. Meanwhile, you've got a lot to prove. I appreciate cockiness, but I don't tolerate complacency.\" Maverick shot a look at Icegirl, who was smirking broadly. \"Yes, ma'am,\" she muttered. \"And find some hair ties. What happened to the regulation bun? I swear to God,\" Viper said, flicking her hand in Maverick's general direction. She turned and addressed the group. \"Your first instructional period is tomorrow, oh nine hundred hours, out in the hangar. It will be followed by a hop. Dismissed,\" she said, and strolled out. Jester followed after her obediently. \"I can't believe we fucked up already,\" said Goose. \"Who the hell is Icegirl ?\" Goose gave her the side-eye. \"Uh...\" \"Never mind, tell me later,\" Maverick said, realizing that half of the girls in the room were staring at the pair of them. Goose took Maverick by the shoulders, turned her around, and steered her out of the room. / \"Do I look shoulder-y?\" The two of them were loitering outside of the officer's club, waiting for a lull in the music so they could make an \"entrance\". \"Shoulder-y?\" said Goose. \"No, you're fine.\" \"This is why I don't like the dress whites.\" \"Well, maybe a little, but it's more Beyonce than Working Girl .\" \"But Beyonce has hips to balance it out,\" Maverick said, tipping back on her heels and giving herself the once-over. \"Oh well. Okay, let's go.\" The officer's club was like any other officer's club: loud, dark, and full of people in uniforms trying to have sex with people who were not in uniforms. Maverick turned to Goose and beamed widely at her. Goose returned the smile nervously. She knew Maverick too well. \"I think I should sue Snapple,\" she said out of the blue. \"Why?\" \"My Snapple fact this morning was 'the average human swallows seven spiders in their sleep in one year'. I've never swallowed a spider in my life .\" \"How would you know, if it's in your sleep?\" \"My mouth's closed when I sleep.\" \"My mouth isn't...\" \"But you'd feel a spider crawl into your mouth. And why would a spider crawl into a mouth? That's not an M.O. that a spider would have, Mav, to get into someone's mouth. And if they got in there they're not going to continue into the esophagus and then walk their dumb ass right into a boiling pit of acid, right?\" \"What boiling pit of acid?\" \"Your stomach.\" \"Oh... it doesn't really boil, though, does it?\" \"It's hot down there.\" Maverick made a face. \"Ew...\" / Across the bar, Icegirl was watching them with a lazy, satisfied expression on her face, like a cobra that had just swallowed a small pig whole. There was a guy next to her, chatting her up, and as much as she wanted to say \"I'm not interested in your dick,\" put her hand on his face and shove him into next week, it looked better to have him standing there. She was undeniably curious about Maverick. She knew Mother Goose a little bit from flight school, but Maverick was an unknown variable. Icegirl let her eyes rove over Maverick's body for a moment and didn't even notice when what's-his-face turned to her, realized she hadn't heard a word he just said, and left in a huff. Slider appeared at her shoulder, beers in tow. \"Checking out the competition?\" Icegirl grabbed one and took a swig. \"That's the second time today you've asked me that.\" \"That's the second time today I've caught you staring at her.\" Icegirl snorted. \"Please.\" \"I wouldn't blame you. She's cute.\" She looked sidelong at Icegirl to gauge her reaction. When she didn't respond, Slider threw out, \"Well, what do you wager?\" \"Bisexual or at least bi-curious with more than three but no more than six gay experiences under her belt,\" Icegirl said. \"But she thinks she's straight and she exclusively dates men.\" \"Um,\" replied Slider. \"Trust me.\" \"I think I'll go say hey to Loosey Goosey,\" Slider said, nudging Icegirl with her elbow and departing. Icegirl sighed through her nose. / Meanwhile, on the other side of the bar, Maverick had become distinctly aware of Icegirl's presence and was taking the opportunity to get a good look at her for the first time. She was gorgeous - of course she would be - in a sharp, clean way, like a show dog. Her pin-straight blonde ponytail was so high on her head it practically defied gravity. She was tall and straight-backed, with such good posture it almost looked uncomfortable and body language that said quite plainly, \"I'm the rooster in this henhouse, so sit the fuck down\". Maverick let her eyes linger for a little too long on how Icegirl's dress whites had tented slightly in the chest, revealing ample cleavage when she turned to the left, then jerked her attention back to Goose. \"So, tell me about this, um -\" \"Icegirl?\" \"Yes'm.\" \"Well, she's a great pilot, but I always thought there was nothing really... special? About her flying? I don't know, but she never really takes any risks, it's all by the book. I mean she's incredibly effective that way but sometimes you think it might as well be a robot in the cockpit.\" \"Huh,\" said Maverick. \"And she's our main competition.\" \"Yeah.\" Goose glanced at her warily. \"Don't get cocky, though, Mav. She's what they want, remember. They're trying to prove that we're just as good as any robot but we have the human reasoning to avoid technical errors... that's her flying in a nutshell.\" \"Don't they also want to prove that we have the guts and creativity to take chances or see opportunities that UAV's don't? 'Cause... \" \"I guess we'll have to wait and see.\" \"Mother Goose!\" \"Oh, hi, Slider,\" Goose said weakly. Maverick turned to see Icegirl's RIO, an alarmingly tall brunette girl with an angry jaw. Maverick shrank slightly in fear the way a pug would shrink away from a Great Dane, then experienced a Napoleonic surge of rage and puffed up like a cat that had been stepped on while simultaneously rocking forward onto the tips of her toes. \"I see you still have the same shitty taste in beer,\" Slider said, glancing at the Budweiser Goose was clutching. \"I see you're still experimenting with human growth hormone,\" Goose shot back. Slider laughed mockingly. \"So you're flying with Icegirl now, huh? How sexually frustrating must that be? What are you, her fifth RIO in three years?\" \"For your information, we've been flying together for eight months now,\" Slider snapped, \"and we're perfectly happy. And we're going to be Top Gun.\" \"We'll see about that,\" said Maverick. Before Slider could respond, Icegirl appeared next to her. \"Goose,\" she said, smirking appreciatively and putting her hand out. Goose shook it. \"Um, Ice, this Paige Mitchell. Paige, this is Tammy Kazansky... or Icegirl...\" \"Maverick,\" said Icegirl, giving her yet another once-over. \"Yep,\" Maverick said firmly. \"So,\" Icegirl said, leaning forward and placing a hand on the bar beside Maverick, trapping her momentarily. \"Have you found her yet?\" \"Who?\" Maverick said, locking eyes with her. \"The pilot who's gonna go head to head with you,\" Icegirl murmured. \"Who has enough balls.\" Maverick was quiet for a moment. Icegirl was staring her down, waiting for her to break eye contact. Icegirl's knee brushed her thigh and her skin flushed at the touch. She drew in a breath. \"Not yet,\" Maverick replied. Icegirl's smirk widened. \"Right.\" So it begins. She drew back and turned her attention to Goose. \"We heard about that little stunt with the MiG-31,\" Slider said. \"Not very professional.\" \"No, but pretty badass, I would say,\" Maverick tossed back at her. \"Mav,\" Goose said, seeming to be on the verge of a massive stroke. \"See you around,\" Icegirl said, and departed with Slider in tow. \"Yeah, I'll see you,\" Maverick called after them, \"we'll see each other -\" \"Mav, Mav -\" \"Oh shush, Goose.\" \"Look, they're idiots. They don't know what they're talking about.\" There was a pause. \" Tammy ,\" Maverick said, \"Tammy Kazansky,\" and they both cracked up. / \"What about him? Three o' clock, the blondie.\" Maverick turned to look. She'd been finding herself glancing Icegirl's way all night and welcomed a distraction. \"Ew, he looks like a guy named Blake on a soap opera,\" she said. \"Or a porn star. A porn star named Blake on a soap opera and also he moonlights as a hot gay butler on Masterpiece Theater.\" \"Lots of guys around here get highlights and stuff,\" said Goose. \"It's California.\" \"He's so... metrosexual.\" \"I thought you liked that.\" Maverick glared at her. Goose muttered something that sounded like Penny Benjamin . \"Oh my god, shut up!\" \"I'm just saying...\" \"I like manly men. Big... manly... lumberjacks. This guy looks like the original Brawny paper towel guy was gay and he had a baby with the dumb girl from Three's Company .\" \"I'm cutting you off on obscure pop culture references. Buy him a drink. Remember, if you go home alone, you pay my tab.\" \"What, two Budweisers? Okay, I'll buy him a drink. Wait, hold on, can I do my Sexy Bitch routine?\" \"Please god no.\" \"Aww, Goose,\" Maverick said petulantly. \"No. Mav, please -\" \"Lemme check,\" Maverick said, and she walked up to the manager - or at least a guy she assumed was the manager from the way he was yelling managerially at someone. \"Hey, 'scuse me,\" she said, and he turned around. \"Do you have a hot mic lying around that I could grab and maybe you could also pipe the instrumentals from Sexy Bitch over your speakers when I signal you to?\" He stared at her. \"Ma'am?\" \"Is that a no?\" \"Yes?\" \"Yes?\" \"No, no.\" \"Yes no?\" \"No. Just no.\" He hurried away. \"Okay, we'll do this oldschool then,\" Maverick muttered to herself. She sidled up to Blake-the-hot-gay-waiter at the bar. \"Buy you a drink?\" she suggested. \"Uh, I have one,\" he replied, gesturing at his martini. \"But thanks.\" \"Extra olives,\" Maverick noted. \"You like olives?\" Shut the fuck up and get to the point , she told herself. \"Come here often?\" \"Relatively so,\" he said. \"I'm Charlie.\" He held out his hand. \"Oh,\" Maverick said, and shook it apprehensively. \"Civilian?\" \"Hmm,\" he said, without really answering. \"And you?\" \"I'm Maverick,\" she chirped. He raised his eyebrows. \"I mean my name is Maverick, my real callsign is Paige,\" she said. \"Wait, shit, the other way around.\" \"Name's Paige, callsign Maverick,\" said Charlie. \"Got it. Well, have a nice night.\" He stood. \"Hey, hold up -\" \"Sorry, Paige, but I'm kind of on a date,\" he said, and walked away. \"Damn,\" said Maverick. Goose appeared by her side. \"No luck?\" \"Crash and burn,\" Maverick said, making her hand into an airplane and sinking it straight into the bar with an accompanying whoooooooomph noise. \"He's going into the bathroom, go poach him,\" Goose said, poking her in the back. \"Yeah, all right!\" Maverick said excitedly, leaping to her feet and jogging in that general direction. \"Her name was Chrissy Snow, by the way,\" Goose called after her. / As soon as she walked into the bathroom, a man at one of the urinals let out a little shriek. \"Hey, what the fuck?\" he demanded. \"Oh, sorry,\" said Maverick. Charlie rounded the corner. \"Oh, this is stalking,\" he said. \"I'm officially alarmed by this.\" \"Hi, I just wanted to let you give me a second chance,\" Maverick said, \"despite your date.\" \"I'm trying to pee, here!\" yelled the shrieking man. \"I don't know about that, Lieutenant.\" \"You, woman over there!\" shrieked the yelling man. \"How do you know I'm a Lieutenant?\" Charlie bit his lip. \"Hmm,\" he said again, evasively. \"Listen, I'll see you around, Paige Maverick.\" \"Wait, hold on,\" Maverick said, and she grabbed his ass. \"Okay, I'm satisfied. See you around, Hmm-ing Charlie.\" He raised his eyebrows at her and departed. \"CAN YOU GO NOW?\" the shrieking yelling man desperately half-yelled, half-shrieked at her. But Maverick was already out and on her way over to Goose. \"What's the story?\" \"There was butt action.\" \"His or yours?\" \"His, what do I look like, a hooker?\" Goose nodded slowly. \"Okay. But he left, so you still have to pay for my beers.\" \"Fine,\" Maverick groaned. She felt someone looking at her and she swiveled ever-so-slightly to the left. It was Icegirl, lurking in the shadows. She made eye contact and held it for a moment, then turned back to Goose. \"Mav,\" she said warningly. \"What?\" Maverick replied, all innocence, and went to pay for their drinks.

So please head over to profile if you like this story because you will probably find that I have more stories you'll like. This wonderful story will follow through the movie and after. So please like it and be nice cause this is my first fanfic for this section! Disclaimer: Believe me I don't own anything except my oc. I believe every section should at least have one oc and so you got Abby. \"Pick up. Pick up! This is my one phone call Adam you got to pick up!\" I screamed into the phone. The guards began to look at me strangely which I took as a bad sign. I smiled back at them through the glass window and gave them a big wave. They waved at me halfheartedly, still a little suspicious. I mean I would be too if I saw a woman punching the wall of the phone booth and screaming insults and cuss words into the phone. \"What the Heck, Abs it's five in the morning!\" Maverick's familiar voice called over the phone line. \"God, I love you Adam!\" I sighed leaning against the phone booth giving another wave to the security guards. \"I know, but you don't have to call me at five in the morning to tell me. So what's up?\" Maverick grumbled. I could picture him blinking at the sun coming through his window and then looking at his clock beside his bed knowing that the time on there would be very different by the time he was finished talking to me. \"You wanna know what's up? I'll tell you what's up! I'm at the police station! THE POLICE STATION! The one where they lock up people up for all eternity! The one with the hard benches covered in flies!\" I screamed. \"Stop being so dramatic Abs.\" Maverick replied. \"I'm not being dramatic! I am just a very expressive person who will let you know EXACTLY what I am feeling at any given moment with as much detail as possible!\" I screamed causing the security guards to jump. \"Don't I know it\" Maverick laughed. \"Yeah, laugh it up buster cause when you use your one call to call me at five in the morning I won't answer!\" I yelled. \"Okay, Abby just calm down. What'd ya do?\" Maverick said in a soothing voice. \"Your gonna laugh\" I pouted. \"Probably, but I'm not moving out of this bed and putting on clothes just cause you ran a red light\" Adam replied. \"You sleep naked! That's sick Mav!\" I cried accidentally hitting my hand into the wall of the phone booth. The noise was deafening causing the lady at the front desk outside of the glass to jump. She glared at me menacingly. I stuck my tongue out at her. \"You just stuck your tongue out at someone didn't you?\" Maverick sighed into the phone. Okay so Maverick knew me a little too well. \"Maybe…\" I admitted. \"Hurry up and spill your guts cause your costing me a hundred dollar phone bill and believe me if I wanted to spend a hundred dollar phone bill it wouldn't be talking to you\" Maverick replied. \"Well it's beat up on Abby day isn't it?\" I muttered. \"Okay so I was speeding like really speeding down the road on your motorcycle…\" I started. \"What? You made my motorcycle an accomplice!\" Maverick yelled interrupting me. \"Hey do you wanna hear what happened or not?\" I cried. \"Okay, so this cop comes out of no where and I mean no where. I hear the sirens and what do I do?…\" \"You pull over and confess that you took my motorcycle without my permission\" Maverick answered. \"As if Mav. I thought you knew me! So I panic and speed up. Then this man's voice comes over the bull horn and he's all like 'Pull the motorcycle over!' Well I figured that if I listened to them when they pulled out the blow horn maybe I'd get off easy.\" Maverick snorted interrupting me. \"You just thought that maybe you'd be able to flirt your way out of a ticket\" \"This is not funny Mav!\" I cried. \"Continue, Abs\" Adam said giving me the okay to continue. \"So I pull over and the cop is all like 'Miss do you know how fast you were going?' And I'm like 'No but I'm sure you'll tell me.' And then he starts to ask for my license and registration. And I'm like 'Well this really isn't my motorcycle it's my best friend's but he said I could borrow it.' \"Lie 1\" Maverick said bluntly. \"Anyway he didn't take that well and he thought I was a car thief and hopped up on drugs.\" \"Were you?\" \"You know I don't drink!\" \"Anyway he had me walk a straight line which I did perfectly. Then he was like 'Okay but we still need to bring you down to make sure your not a car thief and that you did indeed borrow this car. Plus your gonna have a hundred dollar fine.' I told him he didn't have to do that cause I wasn't one.\" \"Lie 2\" Maverick said bluntly. \"Come on Mav if my six future husbands find out about this I'm history!\" \"Your actually thinking about my brothers that you have no chance with right now?\" Maverick laughed. \"I do to have a chance! William winked at me yesterday!\" I pointed out. \"He had hot sauce in his eye because you shook the hot sauce bottle at him\" \"You know what I'm about to be thrown in jail with rapists and murders I don't want to argue about hot sauce!\" \"Okay, Okay I'll get there as soon as I find my pants\" \"Great, just great\" I muttered. \"What you want me to come with nothing on? Cause that's what you'd get if I left right now\" \"True, I don't think they'd let me go home with an extremely hot naked guy\" I agreed. \"You are really sucking up to me right now aren't you?\" \"Duh, everyone knows you can't leave a girl who just called you hot at the police station all by herself\" \"True, I'll see you in five minutes\" \"But you live 30 minutes away\" \"Believe me I'll be there in five minutes\" \"Awwww! I can't believe your actually going to speed for me!\" \"Like you said I can't leave a girl that just called me hot at the police station all by herself\" \"I love you\" \"I know\" End Note: Please tell me what you think and review! I promise it will get better and please no flames! Oh and by the way I have never been to the police station and have a very clean record so if I got something wrong about anything Abby said I am sorry![Chapter 2] Author's note: I know no one has reviewed this story yet but I'm not an author that won't update till I have reviews like some authors are. I really would like to hear what you have to say about my story so I figured the only way to get you more into the story is by writing another chapter. This took me a while to get since recovering from writer's block is no small feat so please tell me what you think! \"Slow down Mav! Mav are you listening to me? I know I shouldn't have taken your bike, but you don't have to kill me over it!\" I shrilled over the roar of the motorcycle engine. I held onto him for dear life as we sped over a bumpy bridge, narrowly missing the stop sign that Maverick ignored. \"Adam this is Suicide!\" I tried again knowing it probably wouldn't have any more of an effect than my other protests did. \"Yeah well that sounds pretty good to what's gonna happen when they find out were not on the base at role call\" \"Jeez, Adam I got a fine and almost got locked up with pedophiles I think I got my punishment. A suicide murder isn't something I want to experience anytime soon\" I replied. \"Yeah, well Stinger's gonna murder us one way or another\" Maverick muttered as he slowed the motorcycle to the proper speed limit. He had a point though I didn't want it admit it. Stinger would be glad to bury us in a ditch somewhere and forget he ever even heard the names Abigail and Maverick. Though that'd be kind of hard to do considering I'm his daughter. He could get away with yelling at me, calling me names, giving me extra work to do, but even he knew it would be looked down upon if my body mysteriously disappeared from the base along with Maverick's. Plus he would be giving himself more work to do in finding pilots to replace us. Believe me my dad hated doing extra work, which was why he loved saddling me with as much of it as possible. IN A PLANE AFTER HAVING A LONG CHAT WITH DAD \"Faucet, This is Ghostrider Sector zero nine zero for bogey\" Ghostrider's voice rang out over the handheld radio as Cougar and me soared above the thick layer of clouds shielding our view of enemy planes. \"Who's up there?\" I heard my father's voice ask in background. I smirked knowing that he wasn't going to be happy finding out his daughter he had just yelled at for sneaking off base was up in the air the same day. The base rules were if you sneaked off you weren't in the air till days or even weeks later. It all depended on the mood my father was in. Our base punishment was no flying until further notice, but everyone knew if Mav and me weren't in the air consequences would be sure to ensue. There weren't any better pilots than us though we could never have done it without our partners. Maverick had Goose and I had Cougar though a lot of the time it seemed like we were all one big team. \"Faucet and Cougar and Maverick and Goose\" I heard Ghostrider pronounce dryly. \"Great, just great\" I heard him mutter in the background making me smirk all the more. \"You see him Cougar?\" I asked into the hand held radio as we sped above the cloud surface. I took that opportunity to watch the clouds just a few feet below us. The clouds had never ceased to amaze me. \"Not yet, but I'm sure he'll start to engage us soon\" Cougar replied as he watched his radar opposite me. \"Talk to me Goose\" I heard Maverick order playfully into the hand held radio. \"Roger I got him, 20 left 2900 miles, 920 knots closure\" Goose replied opposite Maverick just below us. \"Faucet, you hear that?\" Mav asked knowing full well I could. He just liked to act macho and arrogant in the air. \"Roger Maverick\" I replied as I ordered Cougar to set our destination closer to the bugger we needed to engage. \"Cougar, you got him?\" Goose asked knowing that our plane wasn't the best in finding radar contact. \"Roger I got radar contact\" Cougar replied dryly. \"I'll get an visual ID then Faucet you hook him\" Maverick joked as they swooped out to better see who we were dealing with. \"Roger and I'll clean him and fry him\" Goose crowed enthusiastically. \"Faucet this is Ghostrider sector 90903 I got an inbound bogey heading 2020 at 10 miles 900 knots closure\" Ghostrider's voice called loud and clear. \"Roger Ghostrider\" I replied as I ordered Cougar to span out to get a view of the bogey. \"Goose you see an trailer?\" I asked as I furrowed my brow in confusion. Bogeys don't usually travel alone and It was very unusual that the one we were tailing was. \"Negative Faucet, looks like he's an single\" Goose replied understanding my concern. \"Cougar, I'm gonna go head to head with him\" Maverick called over the hand held radio. \"Take it easy Maverick I don't like this crap. Were gonna break high and right, see if he's alone\" Cougar replied making me smile. Cougar had a small fear of being left alone and often forgot I was with him sometimes. Though it never affected his flying ability. \"We got a thousand knots closure Mav, he's coming right at us\" Goose cautioned watching the radar. \"Okay buddy what's on your mind\" Maverick muttered to himself. Suddenly I heard a rush of wind beneath us that took my breath away. \"Oh shoot there's 2 of them!\" Maverick's panicked voice penetrated my thoughts. \"Mg28's none of them has been this close before\" Goose agreed with the same concern in his voice as Maverick's. \"What the heck are they doing there?\" I cried as I scanned the sky for any trace of them. \"What's their position?\" I heard my father's voice ask Ghostrider just as concerned as we were. \"250 miles out sir\" Ghostrider replied diligently answering his superior officer. \"250 miles, get them out of there!\" my father's panicked voice rang out. \"You got mg1, I'm going after mg 2\" Maverick said hoarsely. \"Roger\" I replied as I continued to scan the clouds. \"Crap! There he is, right above us\" Cougar's panic stricken voice yelled causing my hands to shake. I wasn't used to hearing Cougar freak. \"I lost him in the sun! Crap what's he's doing!\" Cougar yelled this time the panic in his voice was even more provident. \"You got him Faucet?\" Goose asked concerned. \"He's coming around! He's coming around on our tail!\" Cougar cried really freaking out now. \"God damn it! This bogey's all over us!\" I cried as I was able to get a shaky visual. \"He's mp500. Go get him Mav\" Goose ordered. I \"I'm going for missile lock, see if we can scare this guy out of here\" maverick replied. \"I got him locked!\" Maverick cried but a second later. I sighed with relief knowing that we had one Bogey down. \"We got him Faucet! He's bugging out and going home!\" Maverick crowed as they soared a miles away from us. \"Faucet, this is Goose. Mg2 is heading home\" Goose confirmed what Maverick said. \"Cougar he's got missile lock on us! Get away from this guy!\" I cried as I heard an incessant beeping noise signaling a pilot's worst fear. \"I can't take this crap! He's engaging me! Mustang this is Cougar, 1274! He's got missile lock on me do I have permission to fire?\" Cougar yelled franticly into the hand held radio. \"Do not fire until fired upon!\" my father's voice rang out clearly upset by this whole ordeal. \"But then it may be too late sir\" I objected knowing we didn't have much hope if we were fired upon. \"The mg's in perfect firing position the mg's right on Faucet's tail\" I heard Goose exclaim above us. \"No way Goose, he'd have fired by now he's just trying to piss us off\" Maverick's hoarse assurance wasn't enough to satisfy me. \"Maverick get down here and get him off us!\" I cried becoming desperate. This was not how I wanted to go out. \"Easy, Abs. Break hard right and engage. I'm on my way\" Maverick said discarding my call name. \"If we can't shoot this guy then we can at least have a little fun with him\" I heard Maverick laugh. I watched as they soared into an inverted v just above our enemy bogey. \"Is this your idea of fun Mav?\" I heard Goose ask knowing full well that he was getting sick from being upside down. I watched above us as Maverick smirked giving the enemy bogey the middle finger. \"Greetings!\" Maverick laughed. \"Watch the birdie!\" goose instructed as he snapped a photo of the surprised looks of the enemy. \"Gee, I crack myself up!\" Maverick continued to laugh as they flew out of the inverted v. \"This is a great shot Mav! I should be a photographer\" Goose crowed. \"Cougar your tail is clear, big one's bugged out\" Maverick assured us. I furrowed my brow as I checked behind me at Cougar. He was breathing heavily and sweating profusely. \"Cougar, you okay man?\" I asked concerned. \"Cougar this is Maverick. We had enough fun for one day don't you think? I'm getting a little low on fuel so were heading home\" Maverick told Cougar as they pulled up beside us. I still watched Cougar suspiciously. Something was definitely up. \"I'll see you on deck Babe\" Maverick waved to me smirking playfully. I waved back pasting a fake smile on face. I knew I was definitely going to have some trouble landing the plane if Cougar didn't start responding. \"Cougar were running a little low on gas, we gotta get out of here!\" I tried tapping the gas gauge for empathsis. \"Cougar I am not going with you to the air force ball this year if we don't land this plane!\" I yelled hoping that would get his attention. His wife was always extra busy at work that day so he always asked me to go with him as friends. MAVERICK'S POV \"Maverick your at 3 quarters of a mile call the ball\" Ghostrider's voice called over the intercom. \"Roger Maverick has the ball\" I replied bleakly. I knew something was wrong but I couldn't put my finger on it. I waved to Abby and everything was fine I thought racking my brain for what it was. \"You okay Mav? You seem edgy\" Goose asked concerned. \"Yeah, just something seems fishy about Abby\" I replied thinking hard on what it could be. \"Cougar, it's time to land this thing!\" I heard Abby cry over the hand held radio. That's when it hit me. Abby's smile was fake when we parted. Abby never has a fake smile unless she knows she's not gonna see me for a while. \"Crap!\" I muttered. \"Abby was saying goodbye for good\" I whispered. \"What are you talking about Mav?\" Goose asked confused. \"When I alerted Cougar we were going to split he didn't respond!\" \"Come on Mav, you know Abs can handle Cougar just fine. hat are you doing Mav? We got no fuel for this!\" Goose protested as we pulled away from the base. \"It takes two to fly a plane, Abby wasn't prepared for this\" I replied determined to get her and Cougar back on the base as soon as possible. \"Tell him to land that plane! That's an order!\" Striker's voice yelled from the background noise of the base getting picked up by my hand held radio. \"This is Ghostrider, you are instructed to land! Land immediately\" Ghostrider's voice followed Striker's. I ignored him as we sailed right up beside Abby and Cougar. ABBY'S POV \"Any of you guys seen an aircraft carrier around here?\" a familiar voice joked over the hand held radio. My brow furrowed as I looked out the window at Maverick and Goose pulled up beside us. \"Boy am I glad to see you!\" I sighed in relief. \"What's the problem Faucet?\" Goose asked concerned. \"That mg really screwed him up, it's not like him to not respond\" \"I know what you mean, let me have a go at it\" Maverick agreed. \"Your okay Cougar, just stay on my wing, I'll take you the whole way in. Just stay with me\" Maverick ordered Cougar. I don't know what happened but Cougar began to respond. Not with words, but he began to ease the plane back towards the surface. \"Easy Cougar, just a walk in the park buddy\" Maverick reminded him as we steeped a little lower, the base now in our view. \"A little low, buddy. You're a little lower. Pull up buddy, come on pull up\" Maverick instructed him trying not to make him panic any more than Cougar always was. \"Go up Cougar, that's it. Almost there\" Maverick continued as Cougar pulled up slightly. \"This is ghostrider your at 3 quarters of a mile heading home\" \"Were too low Cougar!\" I cried as the plane alarms started going crazy. \"Your too low Buddy!\" Maverick cried getting hysterical. \"Pull up! Pull up!\" I screamed as I squeezed my eyes shut. The next thing I knew the familiar sound of the plane connecting with the base filled my ears. I sighed as I leaned back into the seat with relief. Almost immediately my window was lifted and Maverick was hugging me like he was never gonna let me go. Maverick pulled away smirking playfully. \"Don't you ever do that to me again\" he laughed. \"Believe me it's not in my plans\" I agreed as we were greeted by our shipmates.

LET'S FACE IT, ANIMATED CHARACTERS ARE HOT, JUST LOOK AT JACK FROST FORM RoTG. NOW WITHOUT FURTHER ADIEU, ENJOY. Chapter 1 The New Recruit NO POV. It was a normal night in Gotham for a few people. For some this could mean staying at home for a night in, or having friends over, for some with the doors locked, it was still Gotham after all. For others it would be another charity or high class social event with snootiest of the high class. For a certain few, it meant patrolling the city for the scum of Gotham, and for one it meant the first step to the rest of her life… A young boy, about age thirteen, in red, yellow and green looked down from a gargoyle statue to a robbery at a grand opening of a museum, an older man, between his thirties and forties, in black and grey stood next to me. The young boy looked up to the older figure, who nodded. With that, the two leapt into action. From a higher point a girl watched the two. She was twelve, with black hair and kind eyes, but as she watched them, she couldn't help but smile. She watched them head to the museum, and leapt from the building she stood on and to the roof of the museum, being sure to avoid the hole that the young boy had made when he jumped through the glass. She had to wonder, how did he do that without getting and cuts or scratches? She shook her head and looked back to the action. \"You guys having a party?\" the boy asked as he kicked two of the Riddler's men in the face, and tripped up another with marbles, then landed. \"Guess our invite got lost.\" he concluded. \"It's over Riddler.\" the man in black stated. The Riddler tried to make a run for it, but the young boy went after him. One of the Riddler's men who wasn't out had trip to trip the boy up with a lengthened cable, but failed. To the girl's surprise, the boy sliced the cable before it went taut. After, we cut the Riddler off, stepping in front of his path, and spoke. \"Riddle me this, what's green and purple, but covered in red and yellow?\" he asked. The Riddler went to attack him, but missed and kicked down by the boy and to the floor. The boy jumped from the stairs and landed on him, no doubt breaking some ribs from that jump. \"You, when I land on you sorry butt.\" he finished. The young girl giggled softly and covered her mouth. She had to admit, he was funny and kinda cute. She blushed to herself, and watched as the two below her took care of the rest of the Riddler's men, and left before the cops got there. They went on patrolling, and the girl trailed behind them. Close, but out of sight. She was a very different kind of girl. She came from a family business of spies on her dad's side, and her mother was the sister of Bruce Wayne, needless to say she knew her uncle was Batman, and wanted to live up the family's secret legacies, even more so after her father was killed on a mission. And she had just downright fallen in love with The Arts. Hey, even spy/heroes need a day job she would tell herself. After finding out about her uncle Bruce being Batman, she trained to become the heroine she was today. Her heroine name was Mocking Jay. It was interesting what a freak accident with a short circuiting microphone in your hand and accidental electrocution could to one's voice. It cause her to be able to add and emit a siren like lull to her voice. She could also use an ability she had called Opera Voice, which allowed her to let out a supersonic high C and/or scream that could cause some real damage. Besides that, she was also a very experienced martial artist in many different kinds of martial arts. Going to a top secret all-girls school for spies could do that. She continued to follow them. She glanced at the older man and caught the sliver of a smile on his face as he glanced at her for a nanosecond. She knew that he could tell she was there, but that was okay. He was Batman after all, as well as her uncle, and he had promised her mother that if anything went wrong, he would protect Lena. Even so, she was a trained spy and still being trained, so she could definitely handle herself. She smiled as she followed them back to the Bat Cave undetected and watched as the younger boy trained. She watched from the very top cliff in the Bat Cave and didn't look away when the older man came to her side. \"So?\" he asked. \"He's good.\" she stated, still not looking away. \"Glad you think so.\" he replied. \"But he wouldn't be able to beat me.\" she replied. \"Don't worry, you'll get you chance out there before you know it, don't be in a rush. Trust me.\" her uncle stated, patting her head. The girl continued to look on, a small smile gracing her lips. She couldn't wait for the day when she meet him in person… ONE YEAR LATER. The young boy, now age fourteen, and older man had just arrived back at the Bat Cave after a night of patrolling. Just then, a new voice appeared. \"Wow, this place has changed a bit. I like the new set up Bats.\" the girl stated. The boy sprang into action. He delivered a series on kicks and punches that the girl easily blocked, then side stepped him and put him in a head lock. The girl smiled and spoke. \"Not too shabby, of course, I would beat you.\" the girl stated. \"Alright, that's enough Lena. Let him go.\" the older man stated. \"Fine.\" she stated, and let the boy go, easily dodging a kick meant for her face. \"Must you all ways be so rowdy when proving yourself, Miss Morgan?\" a new voice asked. They turned to see Alfred Pennyworth standing there and setting down a tray with hot chocolate on it. \"Alfred!\" the girl exclaimed and ran up and hugged him. \"Nice to see you again as well, Miss Lena.\" he stated. \"I can't believe how long it's been. Have you been keeping them out of trouble?\" the girl asked. \"As best I can.\" he replied. Lena looked back to Batman and smiled then ran over and hugged him. \"I didn't forget about you, Bats. It's been a while.\" Lena stated. Jason looked at the scene, not believing what he was seeing. \"Can someone tell me what's going on here?\" he asked. \"In the morning we can discuss everything, but for now, introductions are in order. Jason, this is Annalena Morgan, or as she would prefer, Lena. I'm supervising her training while she's here. Lena, this is Jason Todd, the new Robin. We'll talk more in the morning. For now we all need to sleep.\" Bruce stated. \"Okay. Nice to officially meet you, Jason. Night Alfred, Uncle Bruce.\" Lena stated, walking off, grabbing a cup of hot chocolate. \"Uncle!?\" Jason exclaimed. \"Yeah. What, he didn't tell you?\" Lena asked laughing softly, making an unusual feeling stir in his stomach. He looked to Bruce who just started to walk towards his own room, taking a cup of hot chocolate. \"In the morning.\" Bruce stated, before going to show Lena where her room was. Jason was left standing there, before going to his own room. As he laid in bed his thoughts went to Lena, and he felt the weird feeling come back and his face slightly flush. He looked at the ceiling, then decided that after what had just happened he needed some sleep. He would just have to wait until morning to find out what was going on. I HOPE YOU GUYS LIKED THE FIRST CHAPTER. PLEASE REVIEW BUT DON'T FLAME. PEACE OUT![Chapter 2] Chapter 2 We'll Get Along Just Fine THE NEXT MORNING. The next morning, Jason woke up, showered, brushed his teeth and headed down stairs so that he could talk to Bruce about what had happened the other night. After all, he had a right to know what was going on and who the girl who claimed to be Bruce's niece was…didn't he? As he descended the stairs he saw Bruce. Sniffing the air he smiled and spoke as they neared the kitchen. \"Alfred does know how to make a great breakfast.\" he stated. \"While that is true, Master Jason, I am not the one cooking breakfast. It seems that someone beat me to it.\" Alfred said from behind them. As they entered the kitchen, they heard music and stopped in the doorway, as they watched Lena making omelets on separate skillets, as she sang and slightly danced and bopped to the music and sing to it. A little bit of rum in my tummy, yum yum Must shake it up, and dance like a dummy, dumb dumb He kissed me and he called me his babe Asked me to stay How could I turned that away? Don't judge, it was made late I had a lot to drink But I was only being safe Jason watched as she sang and flipped both omelets simultaneously in the air off the skillets spun around and caught them again perfectly. Don't act like you haven't been there 7 A.M. with the bed head Everyone knows it's the walkashame My daddy knows I'm a good girl We all make mistakes in the drunk world Everyone here's on the walkashame Don't act like you haven't been there 7 A.M. with the bed head Everyone knows it's the walkashame I said a walk, a walk Do the walk, the walk, oh walk Do the walk, the walk, walk walk It's the walkashame! As the music went out, she tapped her iPod which had been plugged into a speaker and stopped the next song from playing. As she finished the breakfast, she noticed the three males watching her. \"Good morning Uncle Bruce, Alfred…Jason.\" she said smirking while saying Jason's name. He looked taken aback but quickly put up an unfazed look. Lena simply smiled and put the last bit of breakfast on the table. She had not only made omelets for everyone, but potato wedges, toast, blueberry muffins, and sliced fruit. There were also pitchers of juice and milk. \"I hope you boys are hungry. Oh, and Alfred, I hope you don't mind me already taking care of your work today. I know that Uncle Bruce keeps you busy. I figured you deserve a day off.\" Lena stated smiling. \"As always, you have a heart of gold, Miss Morgan.\" Alfred stated smiling. \"No problem, now let's eat. I'm starving.\" Lena stated. They sat down and began to eat, all the while, Jason stared, trying to figure out who this girl really was, besides what she had said so far. \"You might want to take a picture, but even then, you'd never be able to figure me out.\" she stated. Jason's eyes widened and he blushed slightly, before looking down at his food and taking a bite. \"We should probably explain.\" Bruce stated. Jason looked to Bruce for his explanation. \"Jason, this is my niece, Annalena Morgan. She'll be staying with us for a while as well as helping us on patrol.\" Bruce stated calmly. \"Since when do we need help?\" Jason asked, his mouth full. \"Master Jason, swallow before speaking!\" Alfred stated sternly. \" 'Orry, Alfred.\" Jason stated with his mouth still stated with a full mouth before swallowing. Lena laughed softly, making Jason blush lightly once again. \"To answer your question, I'm here to learn as well. Besides attending the Jillian Academy here in Gotham, which is an all girls school for the future spies and agents of the world, I'm here to get Uncle Bruce's help in honing my other abilities, ones you'll no doubt see in the near future.\" she stated. \"You're a spy?\" Jason asked in a tone that stated he didn't believe her. \"Yeah, it's one way I know your full name in Jason Peter \"Rojo\" Todd, or how you've been Robin for three years now. It how I stole your wallet as you walked in.\" she stated, holding up his wallet, and throwing it to him. He looked at her like she had two heads and she smiled. \"Don't worry, I have no reason to hate you, so you're not on my bad side, you just have to make sure you stay off my bad side. Think you can do that?\" she asked with a smirk. \"Just as long as you do the same.\" Jason replied. Lena smiled. \"You know, I think we're going to get along just fine.\" Lena stated. \"Yeah, me too.\" Jason stated smirking. THREE MONTHS LATER Things had been going smoothly. It hadn't taken Lena long to work well with Jason, and as she'd said, he had seen her use her vocal abilities and was glad not to be on the receiving end. She was pretty incredible. Or at least, Jason thought so. But it was nothing more than in a friends kind of way. Right? At the moment they were without Batman fighting off Poison Ivy in one of the central greenhouses of Gotham. Giving the green clad villainess a good kick to the face, she jumped back and let loose a high C scream, temporarily deafening her. \"Jason, give me a boost!\" she called. Nodding Jason spoke. \"You got it, Song Bird!\" he stated. He made a step stool with his hands and boosted her up so she could deliver the final blow. With a final kick to the chest, Poison Ivy fell. Lena landed perfectly on her feet and smiled at Jason. \"See, not only was that a job well done, it was a job well done without Bats.\" Lena stated, not noticing the vines creeping around her legs. She fell suddenly and was dragged back by a giant fan in the green room that had been switched into reverse. And it was pulling her in quickly. \"ROBIN!\" she cried, fear flashing through her eyes as she drew closer to the fan. Jason grabbed her arms and held her to him as he took out a batarang. \"Hang on!\" he stated, slicing the vine, freeing her and throwing the batarang into the fan to stop. They were jerked back away from the fan, with Jason still tightly holding Lena to himself. Sitting up she smiled at Jason. \"Thanks.\" she stated. \"Anytime.\" he stated smiling back. She just knew that they would get along and she had been right. They had become good friends since her arrival. She had a feeling nothing could tear them apart. OKAY, I HOPE YOU ALL LIKED THE SECOND CHAPTER, PERSONALLY I DIDN'T, BUT I NEED AN OPENING BEFORE I CAN GET TO THE REAL STUFF. PLEASE REVIEW BUT DON'T FLAME. PEACE OUT![Chapter 3] Chapter 3 Past and Present LENA'S POV. ONE YEAR LATER Jason and I sat in the hammock together in the backyard watching the stars. It was the night of the meteor shower. Uncle Bruce said that we could stay and watch, and that he'd get Dick to help him with patrol tonight. We had no problems with that. It was nice to have some off time. We had come a long way since they first met. We had become best friends, bordering on something more. I sat, leaning against Jason's side curled up underneath the blanket we had brought out for them to share. I had her eyes closed with a content smile, then opened my eyes and looked to Jason when he tapped my shoulder. \"Hey. Want another smore?\" he asked. \"Sure.\" I replied. I took the smore and bit into it. The gooey marshmallow and chocolate was so good. I finished and noticed Jason staring at me. \"What?\" I asked. \"You have chocolate on your nose.\" he stated. \"Oh, why didn't you say that?\" I tried to wipe it off. \"Did I get it?\" I asked. \"No, here let me.\" he said. The next thing I knew, he was close, very close and his face was inches from mine. It was to the point where I could smell his smores breath on my face. The next thing that happened surprised me. He licked my nose. I stared at him for a second before laughing and pushing him off the hammock. \"Why are you so weird, Jason?\" I asked through my laughing. \"I'm just like that.\" he stated, getting back into his spot. He got quiet after that. After a bit he spoke up, but he seemed nervous. \"Hey, Lena?\" he spoke. \"Yeah?\" I asked. \"You know that you're my best friend right. And that I never wat for something to ruin that.\" he stated, looking into my eyes. \"Nothing ever could Jason. You know that.\" I replied. \"I know. It's kinda hard not to think about it though, when you like someone as more than just a friend.\" he stated, then looked like he wanted to slap himself for saying that. I felt my heart beat increase. I knew what he was saying. He started rambling on trying to make damage control. I rolled my eyes and smiled, then spoke. \"Jason?\" I asked. \"Yeah?\" he replied nervously. \"Stop talking.\" I stated smiling. I wrapped my arms around his neck and pulled him into a sweet kiss. He made a surprised sound, but kissed me back, wrapping his arms around my waist. As we kissed, I noticed that the meteor shower had started. It was so beautiful. We pulled back both panting. We were about to share another kiss, when we heard a deeper voice. We turned to see Uncle Bruce. \"Keep it G-rated please. I don't want to have to turn the sprinklers on you, but I will. And you know I will.\" he stated, then went back inside. We laughed a bit, both blushing. We cuddled once again, enjoying the night together and watching the stars. Nothing could tear us apart. Nothing. That was five years ago, when Jason was sixteen and I was fifteen. I'm twenty now, and it still doesn't make the pain go away. I remembered it like it was yesterday. We had gotten a tip about Ra's al Ghul, and were heading out. Bats was skeptical about letting Jason go. As our relationship progressed, I noticed that Jason was getting a lot more violent and moody, and angry. Of course he never acted like that with me, and tried to play it off as if nothing was wrong. But I knew, that he knew, that I knew something was wrong. I was a spy in training at the time. I remember what happened when we had done a bust on some of the smaller traffickers. We busted in and were taking them down… 5 YEARS AGO. We had taken down the first two, when we heard someone speak. \" Don't move, or I'll-\" he was cut off by Jason. \" You'll what? Shoot me?\" Jason asked, then took the guy and one of his accomplices down, while I helped Bats. \" Twenty rounds a second and you were still too slow.\" he stated, then heard the cocking of another gun. The leader stood there with a gun pointed at us. \" I'm not slow, punk.\" he stated shooting at Jason, who dodged it. \" Me neither.\" Jason stated. \" I got him.\" Bats stated, knocking the gun out of his hand. Jason still continued, and elbowed him in the shoulder. The man fell with a cry of pain. I stood there, my eyes widened beneath my mask, and my mouth wide open, not believing what I had seen. \" ROBIN!\" Bats yelled. It was a quiet ride back to the cave. I had tried to talk to Jason, but he didn't want to talk. Once we got there, the bats in the cage fluttered at the sound of the Batmobile's doors slamming. Jason stood against the car, with me next to him. His arms crossed and a frown on his face as he spoke. \" I had to take him down.\" he stated. \" You shattered his collarbone!\" Bruce stated angrily. \" He's a drug dealing pimp. I didn't think I had to prop up a few pillows before I took him out.\" Jason replied. \" We needed him. He would've talked, but you put him into shock.\" Bruce stated, trying to calm down. Jason seemed to realize what he had done and spoke. \" Sorry. That was dumb. But he deserved it.\" Jason said, before marching off towards his room. That left me alone with Bats. I looked towards the way he'd gone sadly. \" I know you can see it too, Lena.\" he stated. I looked at my uncle. \" I know you can see how he's changed.\" he continued. \" What am I supposed to do?\" I asked. \" Be there for him. I'm trying to be as well, but I think you have more of a chance. He needs you to be there for him Lena, the most. Before he gets himself hurt, or worse.\" he stated, before heading to the monitor. I looked at the ground and wished him a good night, then headed to my room. It was good advice, really good advice. If only I'd done more to follow it. I wish I'd known just how right he was… SEVERAL MONTHS LATER. We raced to the abandoned ware house. We had stumbled upon the Joker, and Jason had gone after him. We had gotten coordinates from his tracker and headed there straight away. We were in sight of the building. I had jumped off my anti-gravity board and Bats of his bike. We raced to the building and were just about there when an explosion blew us back. Once the smoke had cleared, I rubbed my now aching head, before gasping and looking around rapidly. Where was Jason? I got up and started to help Bats move ruble, when we got to a particularly large piece I gasped, then screamed. There lied Jason. Dead. I felt my legs give out as hot tears streamed down my eyes. \" No, Jason…\" I could hear Bats make out as he picked up his lifeless body. I couldn't control my sobs and started to hyperventilate. I force myself to breath properly, but the sobs and tears kept coming. In the course of a few hours I had not only lost the only boy I'd ever loved, but my best friend as well. It just couldn't be happening. But it was. Jason Todd, was dead. I continued crying once we got back to the mansion and I didn't come out of my room or eat a lot, but enough so that I wouldn't hurt myself. I woke up crying from nightmares that had extremely moody. It was like PMS, but worse. I started to eat more than what I had been, a whole lot actually, but my depression had kept me at my same weight as well. When the funeral came along, I cried the entire time. At one point I had no more tears and sobbed with no tears at all. I couldn't bring myself to speak at the funeral either, it just wasn't in me. After a few months and a certain event, and a lot of therapy with my mother, I was finally able to get out more. After another month I was able to smile a bit again, and after a lot more comfort from mom, Alfred, and my uncle I was back to my old self. Still a bit sad, but better than I had been. Still when I was alone and would look at the pictures of Jason and I together, or if I looked at the bracelet he had given me for my birthday one year, that I never took off, I would cry a bit, but I told myself I had to be strong. For Jason and myself. Still, I think one of the things that really hurt, was that I never got to say, or hear him say, 'I love you.' PRESENT DAY. I had continued being Song Bird, well, Mocking Jay now. I still helped my uncle with Gotham and Dick too sometimes when he needed the help. Even Oracle sometimes, it was always great to hang out with Babs, Dick, and even Stephanie and Tim on occasion. We always talk about girl stuff or what's happening when Babs, Steph, and I have a girl's day out. Babs told me that she was going on a date with Dick. I was happy to hear that they were trying for a relationship again, and I had a feeling it would work out this time, now that Dick has stopped being an idiot and Barbara told him how she had felt during his time with Kory and countless other women. That was a heart to heart just waiting to happen and it finally had. So, we were all happy for them. Plus, he knew he'd get his ass kicked by me and Stephanie if Babs came to us in tears again. And Steph had told me that she and Tim were steadily mending things with their relationship. I'll admit I threatened him a bit when I found out how he'd treated Stephanie, but he knew what he had done was wrong. He was determined to make up for it and make their relationship more relaxed again, and not as strained. He wanted to make sure it was stronger than before. As for me, I had gotten a day job. I was a performer. A singer and actor was more like it. I was a world renowned singer and actress now, so that was also good income. I had managed to balance out being a performer, Mocking Jay, and my work as a spy for the government, which would play into being Mocking Jay a bit. I had continued my training and was now a member of Spy Society, an organization with several divisions of spy for the government. I was one of the elites, which was expected. I sat on the ledge looking down from a rooftop. It had been a slow night, when I heard the sound of glass breaking. Switching to my magnified vision through my domino mask and saw some of the Black Masks goons breaking into the museum. \"Well, I needed something to take my mind off things, anyway.\" I stated to myself. I got up and was about to leap into action, when I got the feeling that someone was watching me. I turned around and looked, but saw no one. \"I must be working too hard. As soon as I finish with this, I'm taking a long bath and going to sleep.\" I told myself, before turning and throwing myself into the action, though I still couldn't shake the feeling of being watched that I'd had… I HOPE YOU ALL LIKED. PELASE REVIEW BUT DON'T FLAME. PEACE OUT![Chapter 4] Chapter 4 New Occurrences LENA'S POV. I still couldn't really shake the feeling I had before, but I made myself push it aside for the most part. A week later I found myself on patrol. It was actually a quiet night, not too much happening- BOOM! I felt the ground shake and heard a big thud coming from the docks. Taking off, I leapt into action. Five minutes later, I saw Bats and Nightwing fighting an Amazo. I'd been briefed about them just last week at SS HQ. Figures one would show up in Gotham, crime city list A. I gave them about five more minutes before jumping into action and hitting Amazo with a sonic scream that through him back a bit, clutching his ears. \"Hey guys, I'm here to save the day as usual.\" I stated. \"What are you talking about?\" Nightwing asked. \"On the last several missions, who was the one to save both your asses?\" I asked. \"You.\" Dick stated in a defeated way. \"Exactly.\" I stated, sending a powerful miniature bomb at Amazo. It threw him back and succeeded in pissing him off even more. Although it did blow one of his arms off. Just then Bruce through a black substance in his eyes. \"I don't think putty in his eyes is gonna hurt him.\" Dick stated. Amazo's head began to spark and once it ignited with the substance, it blew his head right off. \"But plastique will, nice.\" Dick stated. \"You still got it uncle Bats.\" I stated. He turned to me and smirked. I turned to look at the three guys he'd caught. \"Now to deal with them.\" I stated. We walked over to the three men, who shrunk back, or at least tried to as we approached. \"This shipment was meant for the Black Mask, I doubt you're behind this.\" Bruce stated, \"Who do you work for?\" he asked. \"I swear, we're not working for anybody. This is our gig all our idea.\" The leader stated. I rolled my eyes and scoffed. \"Yeah right.\" I said disbelievingly. Bruce looked to Dick and spoke. \"Let it go.\" he stated. Dick, who had been standing by a cable that held Amazo suspended in air, tugged on it and down Amao came, stopping suddenly and spluttering oil onto the three. The leader yelled out in fear and I had to hold back a laugh. \"I'll talk, I'll talk! Just stop! Just stop! The Red Hood, we're working for the Red Hood. We don't have any choice. He's got-\" the leader was cut off as he convulsed suddenly and the other two did the same. A sniper. We took cover and Dick spoke. \"The shots came form the roof top. A sniper.\" he stated. \"A good one.\" Bats stated. I had to agree. I nodded my head. Whoever he was he was good. Stepping out from our cover, Bats took out his binoculars. I switched the vision in my domino mask to binocular mode as well. \"See him?\" Dick asked. \"Yeah.\" Bats stated. \"Me too, he's making a run.\" I said. Bruce already had the Batmobile on its way and I had jumped onto my anti-gravity board. I jumped on and followed after my uncle as he was lifted away. \"Hey wait!\" Dick called as we flew off. Bats wasn't the only one with toys of his own. What would I ever do without my board? It's scary just thinking about it. Bat's was pulled up into the Batmobile with me right by it. \"I'm locked on the signal.\" I stated. As we flew towards it, there was a couple on a roof making out, I rolled my eyes and shouted, \"No PDA, children!\" I yelled laughing a bit. \"Lena…\" I heard Bats trail off through my earpiece. \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.\" I stated with a light eye role. He kept going. I had to admit, he was really good. And he wasn't showing any signs of fatigue at all. Even I would get slightly winded after running like this. Slightly winded. We saw him get into a car and speed away, following him, even when Bats used the grappler on the Batmobile, he still kept going, and Bats kept going even when he went into a tunnel. I really have to ask sometime how Bats learned how to do that, without getting a single scratch on the car. We soon came to a plant and crashed inside unharmed. We looked around. I knew where we were, and I definitely knew that Bats knew. How could he forget? It was the birthplace of the most sick and twisted psychopath in Gotham, possibly the world. I saw Bats look at the spot where it took place. \"Bats…\" I started. Just then we heard a deep male voice, which was, I'm ashamed to admit, very sexy. \"Hard to forget that night. One might say, one of your biggest failures, but certainly not your last, right? Ah, memories.\" he stated. He pointed the gun at Bats and I, then pointed to the car and shot at it, inciting a huge explosion. We jumped out of the way, some of what was in the vat splashed my arm. I hissed in pain. \"Mocking Jay.\" Bats stated. \"Yeah, I'm good. Let's go.\" I said. We raced out, just as the place blew into a fiery burst. I caught my breath for a moment, before heading to the batmobile with my uncle and heading back to the cave. Once we got there I noticed that Dick had made it there first. I guess he'd have too. We did kind of leave him at the docks. He looked at me and gave me one of his faces. I shrugged and spoke. \"Sorry. So found anything on who the attacker was?\" I asked. \"You let him get away?\" Dick asked. \"If by get away, you mean, escape from a fiery explosion still intact and alive, then yes, we let him get away.\" I stated with a pointed look. He shut up about it after work and proceeded to tell us about why he was in Gotham. He'd heard a few things about the guy who attacked. Apparently, he was calling himself the Red Hood. I involuntarily shivered. I still had some issues with...him. \"There's been a ton of imposters before.\" I stated as we watched the footage again. \"Yeah, but he's good. Like that, right there. He sliced that cable before it went taught. You don't just do that. That has to be practiced, learned.\" Dick stated. I felt a lump in my heart, but pushed it aside. The way whoever this was sliced through the cable reminded me of Jason. Dick was right, this guy had been trained well. \"And then there's the knife.\" Bruce stated. \"What about it?\" Dick asked. \"You know many knives that can cut my lines?\" Bruce asked. \"Not many. Dick stated as he grabbed two mugs of hot chocolate, and handed one to me. \"No, not many.\" Bats stated. \"But he is locked up right? Like a lot locked up. I think we should pay him a visit.\" Dick stated and turned to see that Bats was already in the car and waiting. Dick put the mug down and spoke as he went towards the car. \"Can you just one say let's get in the car? Is that so hard?\" he stated. Before he got in the car, he glanced at me. \"Lena?\" he asked almost nervously. \"I'll be here going through some old files, maybe I can find something in the S.S. files and documents. Good luck boys.\" I stated. \"You sure?\" Dick asked. \"Yeah, I'll be fine see you later. By the time you get back I may be gone and back home though. \"Alright, good luck to you too.\" Dick stated before getting in the car and rushing of with Bats. I watched as they drove away. I knew Dock and Bats knew about why I was staying. They were going to see that son of a bitch. I knew it wouldn't be good for me to go with. Lest there be a repeat of what happened. I sighed and started going through old files trying to see if I could find anything. All I found was a bunch of impostors. I sighed and went into more case files. This would be a long night. At about one fifty-nine, decided to call it a night. Saying my goodbyes to Alfred, who really should have been asleep already, I left. I made my way unseen to my apartment in the shadows. The second I was in my apartment, and I had locked the door, I sighed and made my way to the shower. After a relaxing shower, I was in my pajamas, and in bed within minutes. I slipped under the covers and began to drift off into sleep while thinking about the new events that had transpired. I pushed the thoughts away and let sleep take over. However as I drifted into sleep, I could quite shake the feeling of being watched again. I HAVE NO EXCUSE OTHER THAN SCHOOL AND KEEPING MY GRADES UP. I HOPE YOU GUYS LIKED. PLEASE REVIEW BUT DON'T FLAME. PEACE OUT![Chapter 5] Chapter 5 Coming Out and Coming Back To You LENA'S POV. We were still no closer to finding the Red Hood, but we had managed to find out about a drop for the Red Hood. The Red Hood would probably be there, then we would have a chance to get him and find out just who he was. Somehow I had a feeling that Red Hood and the feeling of being watched were connected. I just had some weird feeling that wouldn't stop pestering me. But I digress. We were waiting on a rooftop for the drop to happen. I chatted idly with Dick while waiting. \"So where are you taking Babs anyway?\" I asked. \"We're going to Dave and Busters. After that, a movie and then back to my place for dessert. If you catch my drift.\" he said smirking. \"Yeah, I do, please don't make me sick. And you better not screw up this time. You know how hurt she was when you didn't realize her feeling and started sleeping with other women after breaking up with Kory. She was sad and almost always coming. I know because she came to me and Stephanie with everything. We were both super close to coming over and beating the stupid out of you.\" I said. \"I know. I'm still trying to make all that up to Babs. I finally stopped being stupid and realized I want to be with her. To be honest, I really don't know what an amazing woman like her sees in a guy like me.\" he stated. \"It's because she loves you, you idiot.\" I replied. \"Yeah, I know.\" he said with a content smile. \"But seriously, if you hurt her, just remember, I know where you live and where your safe houses are. All fifteen of them.\" I stated. \"I know. You know you can be scary at times?\" he questioned. \"Yeah I know, Tim knows too. The same thing goes for him is he does anymore bullshit with Stephanie. I am glad that each of you are working things out.\" I stated. \"Thanks, Lena. So, how's your love life?\" he asked. \"Non-existent.\" I stated. \"I thought you went out with that one guy from the café?\" Dick asked. \"We did, I had to sneak out the window. It was unbearable. I think I'm just unlucky in love right now.\" I stated, \"There's only one person I've ever loved romantically, and you know it.\" I stated. \"I know, but I also know that he would want you to be happy.\" Dick said. \"Yeah, I know. I just miss him.\" I stated.\" \"I know, you aren't the only one. Imagine how Bruce and Alfred still feel every time they see his old robin uniform, in it's case?\" he asked. \"Depressed…a lot. Jason and I were together and we loved each other, but he was also Bruce's son. He loved him, and then he died.\" I said. \"But Bruce knew that Jason knew that Bruce loved him like another son, it should be enough.\" Dick stated. \"Yeah, but it's not.\" I replied. Just then, Bats appeared. \"Get into position.\" he stated. We got into place, just as the chopper with all the Black Mask's guns appeared. And who should be piloting it than none other than the Red Hood? Bats shot a missile like projectile at it, making the controls go haywire. Just then, Red Hood jumped out, and let the chopper go plummeting to the ground with tons of innocent people about to be crushed. \"Lena-\" I cut Bats off. \"Yeah, on it!\" I stated before leaping out and using one of the reinforced net catapults to help catch the plane. I headed back over to Dick who had used strong staples to hold down the wire that was attached to the projectile which was still merged with the chopper, it helped slow it down as Bats cast two other strengthened nets to catch the chopper before it could crush anyone. After that we followed after the Red Hood. Had to admit once again he had skills. \"He's very good.\" Dick stated. \"Yeah, he is.\" I agreed. \"Nothing we haven't seen before.\" Bats stated. \"If you say so.\" Dick stated. I had to admit that this guy was great. He had some serious skills. Skills that seemed very familiar, but I pushed that thought aside as we kept chasing. Eventually we followed him to a train station, just when we thought we got him, we saw that there was a planted explosive. We moved away, but it still managed to blow us back. I heard a sickening crack and heard Dick groan in pain. \"Nightwing, you okay? What am I saying, of course not. That's probably a broken leg.\" I stated. \"Yeah, thanks Len- er, uh Mocking Jay.\" Dick stated in pain, which is probably what made him almost say my name instead of my heroine name. We saw the Red Hood about to get away on his bike, before he fled he turned to us and spoke. \"You still got it Song Bird, and you haven't lost your touch-\" he was cut off as the train came by. Bats threw Dick out of the way as we moved out of the train's path. Dick groaned in pain once more as we looked to the place where the Red Hood had just been minutes ago. Once back at the Cave, we had treated Dick's leg. After that, Bats sent us both home. It was just like him to send us home to rest while he pulled endless all-nighters. It was a wonder he was able to still fight crime and manage Wayne Enterprises with basically no sleep. Once I changed back into my normal clothes, I headed back home. Tonight had been a long night. I entered my apartment and went up to my room. I went to the bathroom and changed into my pajamas. I was calmed by now, but not too calm to not notice the person hiding in the shadows on my room from the moonlight. I threw punches and kicks they dodged, I had to admit they were good, but I was better. I side stepped them and grabbed their arm. Shifting the weight, I threw them over my shoulder. I was shocked to see it was the Red Hood! \"How the hell did you get in here and how do you know where I live?\" I asked with venom. \"Now that's harsh Song Bird, oh right, It's Mocking Jay now, right Lena. I see you haven't lost your touch.\" he stated chuckling. \"Unless you want to end up in a body cast for a year, I suggest you tell me how you know my name and who I am. And what your planning for Gotham.\" I threatened. \"Really, you don't remember me Song Bird. I'm hurt, I thought I was your only one.\" he stated, before switching our weight and back-flipping away. I moved quickly and had my laser gloss pointed at him in a flash. \"Hey, before you shoot your boyfriend, wouldn't you like to see his face one more time?\" he asked, hands up in surrender. \"Don't screw with me, my boyfriend has been dead for-\" he cut me off. \"Five years I know.\" he stated, then took of his helmet. My eyes widened as I saw his face. \"Jason.\" I stated. He smiled at me and spoke. \"It's me Lena. I'm back.\" he stated. I walked forward and put my hands on either side of his face. Tears spilled from my eyes as I looked at him and laughed softly in happiness and disbelief, before hugging him tight and sobbing. \"It's really you. Jason…\" I trailed off. \"It's me baby. I'm here for you again.\" he stated. I looked up into his eyes and he in mine before he leaned down and kissed me deeply. More tears spilled from my eyes. I could ask questions later, right now all I knew was that Jason was back and he still loved me. We held the kiss, as we made it to my bed, and lost ourselves in love and passion… OKAY, I HOPE YOU GUYS LIKED. PLEASE REVIEW BUT DON'T FLAME. PEACE OUT![Chapter 6] Chapter 6 Morning After JASON'S POV. I had missed this. Missed her. Missed being around all the time. I looked down at the beautiful women entangled with my limbs in her sheets. A content smile was on her face as she slept. She was so amazing, and she was mine. Finally she was mine. I knew she had been completely devastated when I died. When I was brought back, after my breakdown from being brought back from the dead, I had calmed enough to find clothing. After, I had made my way back to Gotham. I had seen her at my funeral, and it hurt having to watch her cry. It wasn't just that though. She looked pale and sick. It looked like she was eating, but only just enough. I'd followed them back to the mansion, and seen how she just laid in bed and cried herself to sleep. She'd wake up, eat just enough, cry some more and repeat. I had planned to surprise them when they went on patrol again, but then I got a bitter surprise. I had followed them to a bank heist and was about to make an appearance, when I saw who they were fighting. The Joker. I was filled with betrayal, rage, and hate. Why had he still been alive? Bruce had done nothing to avenge me. It must have made it worst for her. Right? It hurt honestly, knowing that Bruce had done nothing about the Joker for what he did to me. As much as it hurt, I stayed away for those five years. Everything was ready now. After, I could finally stop. I could be with Lena like I planned. And the Joker would finally be dead. He could never hurt Lena or anyone else again. I hadn't realized I'd been squeezing Lena in my grip until I heard a quiet groan of discomfort. Lena began to stir and I loosened my grip. She opened her eyes and looked at me with that sweet smile I had come to know and love. She smiled at me with sleepy eyes and I couldn't help but smile down at her. \"Morning.\" she stated. \"Morning, beautiful.\" I replied, leaning down and kissing her heatedly. She moaned, and I felt her hands slid up my chest and around my neck, hanging on to me tightly, deepening our kiss. I shifted, so that I was now on top of her again, sliding my hands down to her hips. Just as I was going to begin kissing her neck, she stopped me. I groaned out, making her laugh softly. \"As much as I would love to continue with this repeat of last night, we still need to talk.\" she stated. \"Or we could talk later and continue with this.\" I replied, giving a long lick to her neck where various hickeys lay on her neck. \"Jason…seriously…we need to talk about all this Red Hood stuff.\" she stated. I stopped and looked at her before looking elsewhere and sighing. \"Why are you doing all this, why not tell Bruce you're alive? How long have you been alive anyway?\" she asked. I didn't meet her eyes or speak, so she tried again. \"Jason…\" she trailed off, cupping my face with her hand. I looked back at her and spoke. \"Let me take you out tonight.\" I stated. \"Jason-\" I cut her off. \"Please. Just let me do this for you, Lena. I've missed you, so much.\" I stated, kissing her softly. She hesitated, I knew she wanted to press this conversation, but at the same time she wanted to spend time with me. \"Alright, but this conversation isn't over.\" she stated, getting out of bed and slipping on her her underwear and one of her large shirts. I chuckled and she smacked my arm before speaking. \"You want breakfast?\" she asked. \"Yeah. Thanks.\" I replied, putting on my boxers. \"Pancakes okay?\" she asked. \"Yeah, sounds great.\" I followed her to the kitchen and watched her as she moved about he room with a content smile on my face. \"So, am i going to find out how you're alive at least?\" she asked as she stirred the pancake mix. \"Ra's al Ghul. He was working with the Joker the night I died, but I wasn't supposed to die. He felt guilty, and used the Lazarus Pit to bring me back to life. After, I waited five years and here I am.\" I explained. \"Are you going to tell me anything else at some point soon?\" she asked. \"Yes, just not right now.\" I stated. \"I'm guessing that you don't want me to say anything to Bruce?\" she asked. \"Yeah.\" I stated. She sighed and spoke. \"Alright.\" she replied. She went back to cooking pancakes and soon we were eating them while reminiscing about the past. It was nice. Really nice. Once we finished eating I'd gotten dressed and was about to leave, but stopped when wrapped her arms around me and pressed out lips together. Once we pulled apart, she spoke. \"So, what are we going to do for this date night?\" she asked. \"How about dinner, then we can come back here for desert.\" I stated with a smirk. \"Or we could talk and then maybe have desert. I really want to know what happened with you while you were gone Jason. I'll tell you everything that happened with me too. Then it will fair. Okay? I want us to talk about this.\" she said, taking my hand in hers. \"Alright. That's fair. so when do you want to get dinner?\" I asked. \"How about tonight at seven?\" she asked. \"Perfect. I'll see you then.\" I stated. I kissed her deeply once more, before heading out. That went well. It could have been bad. At least we get to have another date before I have to tell her about everything. That's sure to be a fun conversation. I still had planning to do, but at least I could forget about that for one night. Now I just had to get ready for the date tonight. SORRY FOR TAKING SO LONG, BUT YOU KNOW HOW IT IS WITH SCHOOL.

It was June now, and the sun was rising sooner than usual each day. This morning found a forty-five year old John Tunstall, accompanied by his lawyer and close friend Alex McSween and Alex's wife Susan, stopping his wagon in front of his brand new store at the south end of town. It had been nearly two months ago that he'd come here to this little western town all the way from London England, and since then he had managed to set up quite a fine new life for himself here. There were a large group of cowhands coming up from Texas, scheduled to arrive in a few weeks, bringing the cattle he had purchased with them. They had been hired to drive them to John's ranch and then drop them off there before heading back to their own outfit in Texas, so there was still the matter of hiring on hands once the cattle arrived. The ranch itself was three thousand acres of wild New Mexican wilderness where somewhere in the very center a little adobe house stood, with a barn in front of it and a bunkhouse out back. There was land enough for hundreds of cattle but for now John would be starting off with only fifty head. But this was only until he could find some willing ranch hands to hire on. He'd buy more cattle when he had the men to take care of them. Now the store was a different story. This was something he could start on right away. The old place needed a lot of repairs and even more cleaning, but John was confident that he could get it up and running before his cattle arrived at the ranch in around three weeks. \"Well, my dear friends, what do you think?\" John asked, turning around in his seat to face Alex and Susan. Alex shook his head. \"The place needs a lot of work, John.\" He said. \"I don't know if we can get it done on time. Not even with the three of us working together.\" John got down from the wagon and walked up the front stairs to the store. \"Nonsense, Alex.\" He said with a confident smile. \"If we give it everything we have this old place will be up and operating in no time.\" Susan chuckled at as Alex shook his head. John sure was a persistent fellow. \"Now then, Alex...\" John continued opening the door of the old building. \"Shall we get started?\" Alex sighed and got down from the wagon before helping Susan down too. The couple then walked up the stairs of the boardwalk and followed John into what was now his general store. ... For two weeks they worked to get the old place back into shape, but still with only the three of them, they were falling behind schedule. They needed another set of hands to help out. Another worker would surely be the answer to their prayers. And it just so happened that that answer was closer then any of them thought. The stagecoach came into Lincoln one hot sunny day at noon, and almost as soon as they'd stopped, a young, dark haired, dark eyes boy jumped off of the front seat where he'd been sitting next to the driver. Over one shoulder he carried a burlap sack filled with some clothes he'd packed before leaving home, and in his other hand he carried a rifle. There was a belt around his thin waist that held a six shooter as well, though he looked and should have been way too young for such weaponry. Especially when he seemed to be alone. John had been out on the front porch of the store, replacing the window glass when the stagecoach dropped the boy off, and now he stood, watching the child with a curious and worried eye. Why would such a young child be traveling alone out here in the rough and unforgiving West? John haulted his work and stood up straight by the front door to keep a better eye on the boy as he approached the door of the little cafe in the middle of town. The poor thing was probably starving if he'd been on is own for so long, and since John assumed that the child had no money, he figured he'd follow the young man in and treat him to a nice big meal. Then maybe he could find out more about this mysterious young stranger. \"Alex, Susan. I'm going for dinner.\" He called to his friends who were inside the store. \"Would you like to accompany me?\" Alex shook his head. \"No, that's okay, John.\" He said. \"We ate a big breakfast this mornin'.\" Susan nodded in agreement. \"You go on ahead, John.\" She told him. \"We'll be fine here for a little while.\" John nodded and tipped his hat with a smile. \"I'll be back shortly.\" He promised before walking back outside and crossing the street to the little town cafe. He entered the little restaurant just in time to the the young boy place a couple of shiny pennies on the front counter. \"Sweetie, this ain't gonna cover a whole meal.\" The young lady behind the counter told him. John could see the disappointment in the child's eyes from where he stood. The poor thing was starving but he didn't have the money to pay for food. The boy sighed and turned to walk away but before he could leave John walked up to the counter and placed two shiny silver dollars on the counter. \"Two meals please. One for me and one for this young gentleman.\" John turned and smiled kindly at the boy who was now looking at him with confused brown eyes. The woman nodded. \"Sit wherever ya want.\" She told them both. \"Your food'll be out in a minute.\" John turned to the boy and motioned for him to follow him. The boy hesitated for a moment, obviously confused why this strange man would pay for his food, but confusion and fear quickly gave into hunger and he followed John to a table. \"Now then, my young man.\" John said, once they'd taken their seats at a table at the fat end of the cafe. \"Allow me to introduce myself. I'm John Tunstall. I own a ranch just outside of town. And the new store that will soon be in operation here.\" John extended his hand to the young stranger. The boy nodded and shook John's hand. \"Nice to meet ya, mister Tunstall.\" He said. \"Name's Richard. Richard Brewer.\" John nodded and smiled at the boy. \"A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Richard.\" He said. The young boy gave a small grin then went silent. John looked him over carefully. \"I don't mean to pry, Richard...\" He said. \"But you look a bit young to be out here on your own...Are your parents nearby?\" The boy looked up at him with sad eyes and shook his head. \"No sir.\" He answered. John frowned. \"I'm very sorry, my boy.\" He said. \"You have my condolences.\" \"Oh, no sir.\" The boy replied. \"They ain't dead...or at least not both of 'em anyway. Pa died of small pox last year but Mama's still alive and well.\" John nodded. \"My apologies, Richard, I shouldn't have just assumed.\" The boy shrugged. \"It's alright.\" He muttered quietly. John eyed him carefully. \"If you don't mind me asking, dear boy, where is your mother?\" He asked the child. Richard looked up at him again, but this time he seemed very reluctant to answer. \"She's back home.\" He said, his voice uneasy. John raised an eyebrow. \"And where exactly is home?\" He asked. The boy looked down at the floor before replying quietly, \"Vermont.\" John's eyes widened at the boy's reply. \"Vermont?\" He asked. \"Well you're a bit far from home then aren't you?\" The boy nodded slowly. \"Bank took the farm after Pa died.\" He said. \"We're real poor, Mister Tunstall. I came out here to find work. Mama can't feed us all with the money she's been makin'.\" John's eyes saddened. The poor child. He needed help, that much was obvious. \"Does your mother know your here, lad?\" He asked his new young friend. Richard looked up at John for a moment and then down at the floor before shaking his head. \"I left her a note.\" He told John. \"Told her I was headed to New Mexico. Said I'd heard there might be some kind of ranch work down this'a way.\" John nodded. \"Don't you think she might be worried?\" He asked. Richard shrugged. \"Probably not.\" He replied. \"She's probably glad I left home. She's got one less mouth to feed with me gone.\" John frowned. \"I'm willing to bet that she's worried sick about you, young man.\" He told Richard. \"How old are you anyway?\" Richard looked up at John. \"Ten.\" He told him. John sighed. \"Well, Richard. I know you'll probably think that I'm wrong by telling you this but I think you should go back home to your family. The West is no place for such a young man.\" Richard shook his head. \"I can't Mister Tunstall.\" He told him. \"I promised my Pa 'fore he died that I'd be the man of the house. That take care of Mama and the little ones. I can't go back to 'em with nothin'. I gotta do somethin' to help or they'll all end up starvin'.\" John could see tears forming in the boys eyes. He was desperate. Anyone with a good eye could see it. This boy needed help now, and John decided he was just the man to do it. He sighed as he finally made up his mind about what to do. \"Well, my young man, if that's the case I suppose it wouldn't be right to send you back now.\" The boy sniffled and looked up at John hopefully. \"I'll tell you what. Why don't we send your mother a telegram and let her know that you're safe and sound and where your at, then you can stay here if she gives her blessing. Fair enough?\" He asked the boy. Richard nodded. \"Yes sir...\" He agreed. \"B..but how am I gonna find work if she let's me stay? All the folks I asked already said I was too little to handle a man's work and sent me away.\" John pulled a thoughtful face and looked the boy over again. \"Stand up for me, lad.\" He told Richard. The little cowboy obeyed and stood up from the table. \"Well you seem able enough to handle a man's work to me.\" He told him. \"How are you with cattle, Richard?\" The boy's face lit up. \"Real good, Mister Tunstall.\" He told him. \"We raised cattle back home 'fore the bank took the farm.\" John nodded. \"Well..\" He said. \"It just so happens that I'm expecting a shipment of cattle to arrive at my ranch in a matter of days now. But, alas I've yet to find a single wiling sole to work them.\" Richard gasped and gave John a hopeful look. \"Are...are you offerin' me a job, Mister Tunstall?\" He asked, his dark eyes filled with hope. John smiled and nodded. \"I'm in desperate need of a Foreman more than anything else at the moment.\" He said to the boy. \"If you're interested, Richard, the job is yours.\" A smile wider than John had ever seen spread across the young cowboy's face and he looked up at John with big brown, grateful eyes. \"Thank ya, real kindly, Mr. Tunstall.\" He said. \"I don't know how To repay ya fer this.\" John smiled then turned his head when he heard foot steps behind him. The young woman who owned the Cafe laid two big plates of food in front of John and Richard. \"There ya are, Fellas.\" She said, before walking off. John looked back at the boy. \"How about you just put some muscle back on those bones of yours and we'll call it even, huh?\" John said with a smile. Richard smiled back and nodded before he began digging into what was most likely his first meal in days. John smiled. He'd taken care of the foreman job, and he'd managed to save a young runaway from starvation and probably help his family start to edge there way out of poverty as well. It had been a very successful day for him. Now if he could only find some other ranch hands to assist Richard and himself everything would be perfect. TBC[Chapter 2] A whole year had passed since John had taken Richard Brewer into his home. The boy was now eleven years old, and would be turning twelve this coming winter. He'd put on a lot of muscle since first arriving in Lincoln and had also proven to be a very hard worker around the ranch. He did everything that was asked of him without complaint but most of the time he didn't even need to be asked to do anything. He just did the work when he knew it needed to be done. John was proud of the boy. Proud like a father would be of his son, and of course, young Richard was like his son now. After all he had been living and working with John for a year now. John had also been teaching the boy to read and write. Even though Richard had had some schooling back up North, he still had trouble with a lot of reading material, and writing was the same for him, but John had taught him well and now the little cowboy could read just about any book or newspaper that was given to him. There was another thing about this little dark eyed cowboy that John had noticed after a while. Richard seemed to have a lot of very strong leadership qualities. He often demonstrated them whenever the merchandise wagon came to drop of John's store supplies, or when the Texans arrived at the ranch with more cattle. Richard would always be right there to meet them with a list of instructions on what to do and how to do it. Then after he'd given his orders he'd demonstrate how to do the task properly before supervising the men while the task at hand was completed to be sure everything was done right. John found this quality in the boy to be both useful and very humorous since it was quite amusing to watch a small eleven year old boy dictate a group of grown men how to do their jobs. But some of the locals were annoyed by the young lad's bossy behavior and had christened him with the nickname \"Dick\". Yes it was a common nick name for Richard, but John soon began to realize that the people who'd come up with the boy's new nickname had their own reasons for giving the child this name. So instead of going along with the other citizens of Lincoln, John, Alex, and Susan continued to call the boy by his god given name, never once letting Richard know the reasons behind the nickname the towns people had given him, fearing that it would upset him. But of course you can't keep secrets forever, and that fact proved right when one night before reading, Dick had asked John why he and the McSween's still called him Richard when everyone else now called him by his nickname. John hadn't replied right away. He simply told the boy he had something special for him to read that night, and after they'd cleaned up the kitchen from supper, John went to his bookshelf and pulled out an old book that described the life and reign of King Richard the 1st of England. He'd had Dick read from the book that night, and surprisingly, Dick continued to read it whenever he got the chance. He'd read from the book whenever he had free time, and finally one night after dinner Dick finished reading the last page of the book aloud to John, and as he closed it shut he looked up at John and asked. \"John? If this guy was Richard the first, doesn't that mean there were more after him?\" John just smiled and nodded. \"Yes, my boy, it does.\" He told him. \"There were two more after him actually.\" Dick gave John a questioning look. \"Were they kings too?\" He asked. John nodded. \"Yes they were.\" He said with a grin. Dick gnawed at his lip and thought for a moment. \"How come there was so many kings with my name?\" He finally asked after thinking it over for awhile. John simply smiled at the boy. \"Well, my young man, Richard is a name well fit for a King.\" Dick raised an eyebrow. \"How so?\" He asked, confused. \"The meaning of your name is Hard Ruler, Richard.\" John told him. \"Richard the first proved that this is in fact true, for he was a very great and respected leader. He had all the qualities that a good leader should and he was very successful because of this. I see these same qualities in you, my dear boy. You have everything it takes to become a great leader, and if you learn to use these qualities wisely you too will be successful just as the King was.\" John's words on that night had lit a fire of confidence inside the young cowboy's heart, and he began trying to control how he used his leadership skills. He wasn't as bossy anymore, only when he needed to be, and he tried to be more helpful when he was giving people instructions by actually lending a hand and taking part in the task instead of standing by and dictating how it should be done. John was even prouder of the boy then he'd been before. Dick truly had become a great leader, but his skills were normally wasted since John still had yet to find anymore hands to hire on. And aside from the matter of his leadership skills going to waste, Dick was getting rather lonely. Sure he had John, Alex, and Susan for company, but he was a young boy. He needed the companionship of other children his own age, and the only time he ever got that was when their were parties in town, which wasn't often at all. John realized that he was going to have to find a permanent source of companionship for his young adopted son, and it was with this realization that a solution presented itself almost immediately. ... John and Dick were sitting inside the house, eating dinner one dark stormy Autumn night, when suddenly there came a distressed high pitched nicker from the barn. Both John and Dick got up from the table, grabbed their slickers and rushed outside with a lantern to see what had happened. Dick had brought a rifle with him just incase there was trouble. When they reached the barn, the two realized that the door was open, when it had been closed before. A bolt of lightning suddenly flashed then, and lit up the barn hard. Dick gasped when he realized there was blood dripping down the handle on the barn door and running down the length of the door to the ground. John's eyes grew wide. \"Hand me your rifle, Richard.\" He instructed the young boy. Dick nodded and handed over his weapon to John. \"Now follow me, and stay close.\" John then told him. Dick nodded and followed John closely as the older man slowly pushed the barn door open before stepping inside and tiptoeing across the barn floor, using the lantern to light the way. There didn't seem to be anything abnormal inside the barn that John noticed, and he turned back to Richard after he'd checked the whole barn. \"I expect it just some of the stallions getting into a quarrel again. They probably got out somehow while they were fighting.\" He told the boy. \"Come, let's go back inside.\" Dick nodded and turned to leave, but as he took his next step, a hand shot up out of the hay and grabbed his ankle. The boy jumped and shouted and fell back into the hay when the owner of the hand let go of him. John looked back to be sure that Dick was okay then looked back to see just who the hand who'd grabbed the boy belonged to. He held the lantern close to the ground and kneeled down, and lying there, half covered by the hay, there laid a young boy with bright blonde hair and blue eyes looking up weakly at him. The boy was bleeding. He'd been shot. \"Hel..help me... pl..please .\" They boy begged before his eyes closed and he passed out. John's eyes widened and he quickly checked the boy's pulse. He was alive, but he needed help right away. John picked the boy up and carried him towards the barn. Dick jumped up and followed him. \"John!\" He shouted after him. \"John! What's goin' on!?\" John rushed the new boy into the house and laid him down on his bed before finally turning back to Richard. \"Richard I'm going for the doctor. Stay here and keep an eye on him.\" He told his young companion. Dick nodded and stepped into the bedroom where the young stranger was lying. He knew what to do. He had to wrap the wound. Quickly, Dick ran to the drawer that John kept all his emergency medical supplies in and dug out a bottle of liniment and some bandages. He put a pot of water on the stove to heat up too, and while it was warming up he kept pressure against the wound with a damp rag to try and stop the bleeding. Suddenly the young stranger opened his eyes a bit. \"Wha..what happened?\" He asked, weakly. \"Your hurt.\" Dick said, looking up at the boy. \"Try to hold still. I'm gonna try and patch ya up for now. Mr. Tunstall went to get the doctor.\" The blonde boy looked confused. \"Wh..who?\" He asked. \"Just relax, okay.\" Dick told him. \"We can talk later.\" The blonde just laid back again and passed out. Dick sighed, and went to get the hot water from the stove. He cleaned the wound out, and coated it with liniment oil before gently wrapping it with the bandages. John arrived back with the doctor a few moments later. \"What happened to him?\" The doctor asked John. \"I'm not entirely sure.\" John replied. \"Richard and I found him like this in the barn.\" The doctor immediately went to work, though it seemed like Richard had already done most of his work for him. \"It's only a flesh wound, and it's gone straight through. I think he'll make it.\" The doctor told John after awhile. \"He was lucky though. A couple more inches and he would've been gut shot.\" John nodded. \"Thank you for coming out, Doctor.\" He thanked him. \"No trouble, John.\" The doctor replied before leaving. John looked at Richard. \"Go on and prepare for bed, Richard.\" He told him. \"I'm going to keep an eye on him.\" Dick nodded and headed towards the guest bedroom he'd been sleeping in, since John didn't want him to have to stay in the bunkhouse on his own at night. He dressed himself in his night shirt then went into the kitchen area to get himself a glass of the milk that he'd brought in for dinner earlier, but after he'd gotten his drink and walked back across the house to his room, he heard John talking softly in the main bedroom. Dick stopped in his tracks and then walked slowly towards John's bedroom. As he approached the door he could just barely hear yet another voice, though this one was much quieter and sounded a bit weak. Dick poked his head in from behind the door slowly and inside the room he could see John sitting on the edge of the bed, talking to the young blonde boy who's bright blue eyes were now open and alert. Richard could faintly hear the boy say something and then saw him slowly turn his head to look at him. John turned to look at him as well. \"Oh, Richard, come on in.\" He said, motioning for Dick to come into the room. Dick hesitated for a moment. \"Come now, Richard...\" John tried again. \"There's no need to be afraid.\" Dick stood still for a moment but then slowly opened the door up and stepped inside. He kept his eyes on the new boy the whole time. \"Richard, I'd like you to meet Josiah Scurlock.\" John said, calmly as he placed both hands comfortingly on his young companions shoulders. Richard kept staring at the boy. \"Josiah, this is Richard Brewer. He's my foreman.\" Richard just kept staring at the other boy, not knowing what to say. \"Well, aren't you going to say hello?\" John asked Dick. Dick pressed himself back against John. He didn't know why he was afraid of this newcomer. Maybe it was because the boy had obviously been in some kind of gunfight and he thought he might be violent. \"He..hello.\" Dick said, timidly. The very pale, sickly looking, blonde smiled slightly. \"Howdy.\" He replied. \"It's okay, I won't bite ya.\" Dick slowly stepped forward a bit. \"Thanks for patchin' me up.\" The new boy told Dick. Dick nodded. \"No trouble.\" He replied. \"Couldn't just let ya bleed out.\" Josiah smiled. \"Well thank ya all the same.\" He sad again. Dick nodded. John smiled at Dick then turned his attention to Josiah. \"My boy, how exactly did you get all shot up like this?\" He asked him. Josiah looked down at his now dressed wounds then slowly glanced back up at John. \"I um..I don't know if ya wanna hear it or not..\" He said, voice low. \"I might not enjoy hearing it, young man, but I think I should know, for your safety and ours.\" John replied. Josiah sighed. \"Alright...\" He agreed. \"I..um..I was riding with the um..the Dirty Underwear Gang...Out in liberty Missoura.\" Josiah admitted. John's eyes widened. \"Why on earth would a bloody gang like that have an ten year old boy riding with them?\" He asked in shock. \"Eleven, sir.\" Josiah corrected. \"And, They thought I could help patch people up...I was a doctor's apprentice before I joined the gang. The old man was like a father to me, but he died and I didn't have any family left.\" John sighed. \"I'm very sorry, Josiah..\" He said. \"You have my condolences.\" Josiah nodded. \"That's alright, Mr. Tunstall.\" He said, weakly. \"I know he went to heaven. He was a good man.\" John nodded. \"I'm sure he did.\" He replied. \"So how come ya got all shot up?\" Richard asked. \"Richard...\" John said, sternly. \"It's okay, Mr. Tunstall...\" Josiah said, before looking at Dick again. \"We were robbing a train a few days ago when some fella pulled a gun on the boss's brother. He pushed me in front of him and the bullet hit me instead of his brother...Guess I can't blame him much though. I ain't worth much anyway.\" John's eyes softened. \"My dear boy, I know we've just met but please don't say such things. I assure you that you are worth a great deal.\" Josiah just smiled. \"Well thanks, Mr. Tunstall.\" He replied. \"It's been awhile since I've heard any kind words.\" John sighed. \"Josiah, I hope I'm not being to forward, but I'd like for you to stay here with Richard and I. I don't want you out on your own again.\" Josiah gave him a really thoughtful look. \"Well...You don't have to do that, Mr. Tunstall. I've been takin' care of myself for awhile now. I reckon I can keep on doin' it.\" John shook his head. \"Nonsense.\" He said. \"I won't have a young boy being out on his own in a place like this. You may stay here with Richard and myself. It's much safer.\" Josiah looked to be deep in thought. \"Besides...\" John added. \"It'll be nice for Richard to have a friend a bit closer to his own age, won't it Richard?\" Both John and Josiah looked down at the dark haired, dark eyed boy. Dick nodded. \"Yes sir, it sure will be.\" He replied with a smile. Josiah grinned and looked from Dick to John. \"Well, Mr. Tunstall...I guess I could stay...but I ain't real good with cattle. Mostly just horses.\" John nodded. \"You can start out working with the horses.\" He told him. \"As for cattle, I'm sure Richard would be happy to show you the ropes, wouldn't you Richard?\" Dick nodded. Josiah smiled. \"Well, then I guess if it ain't to much trouble, I'd like to stay.\" John smiled. \"Good.\" He said, nodding. \"There's plenty of room in the bunkhouse. Once you're well enough you and Richard both can move your things out there. It'll be a pleasure to have you here, Josiah.\" Josiah smiled. \"Thanks Mr. Tunstall...and my friends call me Doc.\" He said. Mr. Tunstall smiled and nodded. \"Well it'll be a pleasure having you here with us, Doc.\" He corrected himself, giving the boy a friendly pat on the shoulder and a kind smile. Dick smiled too. It really was gonna be nice to have a boy his age living here too, even if he took a little time learning how to do a lot of the ranch work. Dick was perfectly happy now. After a whole year of being around no one except for adults, he finally had a friend his own age to pal around with. And very soon, though he didn't know if yet, he'd have yet another little shadow lingering at his side. TBC[Chapter 3] It didn't take long for Doc to take to life on the ranch. As soon as he'd healed up from the bullet wound he'd started working with the horses in the stable, then soon after Dick had taken him out to the beef herd and taught him how to work cattle. It hadn't been as hard for him as Doc first thought it would be. In no time at all he and Dick were a perfect team when it came to working the cattle, but of course, Dick was still the leader. He seemed to need to be in a dominant position, so Doc just went along with it. He was his best friend now after all. Everything seemed to be going very well now for John and the boys, but one fateful Autumn night, their world was turned upside down. John came into the kitchen early one morning to find both Dick and Doc already dressed for the day and sitting down at the table for breakfast. Dick was reading from the town newspaper and Doc was listening with interested and wide eyes. \"Good morning, gentlemen.\" He greeted them with a smile. \"Mornin' John.\" They both replied in unison. John walked into the kitchen to get breakfast started, but he could hear the boys talking behind him. \"What's it say he looks like?\" Doc asked Dick. \"Says he's real tiny, with dark hair and brown eyes, and he's kinda on the pale side.\" Dick replied. John raised an eyebrow in confusion and turned around. \"What is it your reading?\" He asked, approaching the table where the boys were sitting. Dick handed John the paper. \"Some kid escaped from the orphan train that came up from Mississippi.\" He explained. \"The train was stopped in Albuquerque and he stole somebody's horse and took off on it.\" Doc added. John looked the paper over carefully. \"Does the young man have a name?\" He asked. \"Top of the page.\" Dick said. John looked toward the top of the paper and sure enough there was a name in big bold letters. \"Charles Raymond Bowdre.\" He read aloud. \"Forty two and a half inches tall, thirty pounds in weight and eight years old. The boy is said to have dark brown hair and dark eyes to match it. Bowdre was last seen in Patricio outside of the general store trying to get away with a bag filled with stollen food. If you happen to see this boy please turn him over to the authorities and they will return him to the Chickasaw County Orphanage back in Mississippi.\" John stood, looking at the picture that was provided of the boy next to the story. \"Tiny little thing, isn't he?\" He muttered. Dick and Doc both nodded. \"What if we find him, John?\" Doc asked. John sighed. \"Well, my boy, I doubt that he'll be in New Mexico for long with so many people looking for him.\" Doc and Dick didn't look away. They both expected some sort of answer. John looked back up at them. \"However...\" He continued. \"I suppose if we do find the boy, we can try to keep him out of the way of the authorities.\" He grinned and went back to preparing breakfast. Dick and Doc both smiled. It would be fun to have a little brother running around the ranch with them. \"Oh, and by the way, gentlemen...\" John spoke up again. Dick and Doc looked back over at him. \"I'd like for you to lay out your Sunday clothes for dinner tonight. We'll be having company.\" Dick raised an eyebrow. \"Company? Who is it?\" He asked. John smiled and brought both boys over their plates that were filled with eggs and a couple slices of salt pork. \"You remember Allison, don't you Richard? Alex and Susan's daughter?\" He asked, setting the plates down in front of the boys before taking his own seat at the end of the table. Dick nodded. \"Well...\" John continued. \"You remember she's been overseas in London, staying at my old cottage while she attended Medical school?\" The boys both nodded. Doc knew this as well. He'd never formally met Allison McSween, but he'd written to her just like John and Richard had while she'd been in London. \"Well, she's just graduated.\" John told them with a smile. \"She boarded the ship to return to America three weeks ago, and then shortly after arriving in New York she boarded a train to Roswell. Alex and Susan took a wagon there this morning to pick her up. She'll be arriving home tonight, so I thought we'd celebrate.\" Dick and Doc both nodded again as the ate their breakfast. \"So is she a doctor now?\" Dick asked John a few minutes later. John nodded. \"That she is, Richard.\" He confirmed. \"Only, Allison isn't just any kind of doctor, she's a psychologist.\" Doc swallowed his mouth full of food before asking, \"What's that?\" \"Well, Doc, a psychologist is a doctor who specializes in treating mental illnesses. Allison will be practicing in Albuquerque soon at a mental rehabilitation facility for young children.\" Doc nodded in understand meant then continued to eat his breakfast. That was the last he and Dick thought about the subject until that night. ... \"Richard, will you tie this for me?\" Doc asked as he struggled with his tie. Dick sighed and finished slicking back his jet black hair before approaching Doc and fixing his tie for him. \"It ain't that hard to do.\" He mumbled. \"Hey!\" Doc snapped. \"Sorry.\" Dick apologized. \"Now come on, let's get back to the house. We gotta help with supper.\" Dick quickly walked out of the bunkhouse with Doc following him close behind. Before the two of them reached the house, though, they heard the sound of horses approaching. Dick looked over his shoulder at the trail that led to Lincoln and saw the McSween's buggy approaching the house. He smiled and hurried into the house. \"John! They're here!\" He said excitedly as he came into the kitchen, followed by Doc. John looked out the kitchen window to see the buggy coming down the trail. \"That they are.\" He muttered, before turning to Dick and Doc. \"Will you boys be so kind as the set the table for me, please?\" He asked. The boys both nodded and went to get the plates, glasses, and silver wear down from the cupboards. They set the table carefully and then helped John bring the food out to the table from the kitchen. Suddenly there was a knock at the door. John smiled and walked across the house to the front door before opening it up to see Alex, Susan, and their daughter Allison standing in the doorway. \"Good evening, my dear friends, come in, come in.\" John greeted them, ushering all three of them inside. \"Good evening John Alex replied, smiling and shaking John's hand. \"Hello, John.\" Susan said, accepting a hug from John. \"Hello, John, it's very nice to see you again.\" Allison greeted John as she came inside. \"Ah, Allison, you've grown into a beautiful young woman.\" John said, hugging the nineteen year old girl and kissing her cheek. \"I trust that the cottage was to your liking?\" He then asked her. Allison nodded. \"It was wonderful.\" She said with a smile. \"I enjoyed London a lot. I hope to go back some day.\" John smiled. \"Well I'm very glad you enjoyed yourself.\" He said. Allison smiled back at him, then her eyes focused on the two young boys behind John. \"Hello, Richard.\" She greeted the boy who she'd met before leaving for school. \"You've gotten bigger since last time I saw you.\" Dick blushed. \"Howdy, Allison.\" He replied. \"Good to see ya again.\" Allison hugged him and kissed his cheek before turning to Doc. \"Now, you must be Doc.\" She said, with a smile. Doc's eyes widened. She was so beautiful, with her bright blue eyes and dark brown hair. He nodded slowly. \"Yes m'am...\" He confirmed, timidly. \"That's me.\" Allison smiled brightly and kissed his cheek before hugging him too. \"It's great to finally get to meet the little Shakespeare that wrote all the poems in the letters I received.\" Doc blushed and looked down at the floor. \"You're very talented, you know.\" Allison continued. \"I couldn't write like that to save my life.\" Doc smiled. \"Thanks, m'am...\" He said, shyly. \"But I bet your a lot more talented than I am.\" Allison laughed softly. \"Well aren't you just a sweetheart.\" She said, kindly before standing up. Doc couldn't take his eyes off of Allison. He was in love. Dick looked over at Doc while the adults were talking. \"You okay?\" He asked. He asked him. \"You look kinda out of it.\" Doc continued to stare at Allison. \"Hello! Doc!\" Dick tried again, snapping his fingers in front of the other boy. Doc came to suddenly and looked over at Dick. \"What? Did you want somethin'?\" He asked. Dick chuckled. \"Gosh, Doc, you sure do seem to like Ali.\" Doc blushed a dark pink color. \"I..I..\" He tried to speak but couldn't. \"Don't try to deny it, Pal.\" Dick said, amused. \"I can see it in your eyes. You like her.\" Doc sighed. \"Okay, fine, I do.\" He muttered. Dick smiled. \"Hey, I don't blame ya.\" He said. \"She's purdy.\" Doc smiled and turned back to look at Allison. \"Well, dinner's ready.\" He heard John say suddenly. \"Shall we eat?\" Everyone nodded in agreement. Doc and Dick crossed the room to take their seats on either side of John. Allison came around the table and took the seat next to Doc. The blonde boy blushed and smiled up at her. Dick grinned. Doc had his first crush. It was kinda cute. Even if the girl was eight years older than him. ... Most of the night went by peacefully. Dinner was great and while they all ate, Allison entertained everyone with stories about the time she'd spent in London while going to medical school. The girl was just in the middle of telling them about the time she and her classmates took a ferry across the English Channel to Paris during their summer vacation, when suddenly their peaceful evening was interrupted by a loud crashing sound outside, followed by the chickens sounding out in panic. \"What on earth?\" John muttered. Doc and Dick looked at him. \"May we be excused, John?\" Dick asked. \"It's probably just that fox again. We can take care of it.\" John sighed. \"Very well.\" He agreed. \"You're excused, but be very careful.\" The boys nodded and got up from the table, grabbing their rifles off the gun rack by the door before heading outside. \"It came from inside the chicken coop.\" Dick whispered as he and Doc creeped up along side the coop. Suddenly lightning crashed in the sky, and a loud crack of thunder followed it. It looked light rain. Doc and Dick knew they'd have to get this done quickly before the storm hit. \"Stay close.\" Dick said. \"If we block the door it won't be able to get out.\" Doc nodded and he and Dick entered the chicken coop together slowly and carefully. They came through the door, rifles raised, expecting to see a fox, but instead they came face to face with a small boy who was trying to get away with a sack full of chicken eggs. \"Hey!\" Doc shouted. \"Grab him!\" Dick demanded. As soon as the words left Dick's mouth the little boy panicked and punched him hard in the face. Dick yelled out in pain and fell back. Doc tried to grab for the boy next and then he too took the boy's surprisingly hard fist to the face. \"Ow!\" He shouted and fell backwards next to Dick. The little boy jumped over them and made a break for the trail that led to Lincoln, but before he could get away, John and the others came running out of the house and stopped him in his tracks. \"What on earth is going on!?\" John shouted, looking around for Dick and Doc. The boy slid to a stop in front of them all and looked up at them with wide, scared eyes. John, Alex, Susan, and Allison all looked down at him. The boy made a terrified face and tried to run away but Doc and Dick came up behind him and cut him off. He was surrounded. \"Pl..please..don't..hurt me.\" He panted. Allison pulled a worried expression as she watched the boy start to hyperventilate. She gasped and pushed forward to get to the boy. \"What's wrong with him!?\" John asked, worriedly. Allison bent down next to the boy, who then fell to the ground, shaking violently and hyperventilating still. \"He's having a panic attack!\" She exclaimed, picking the boy up and rushing him towards the house. The boy's frightened eyes stared up at Allison before suddenly he gasped and feinted in her arms. Alex and Susan quickly followed her into the house and John gathered up Dick and Doc before following them as well. \"What on earth happened to you two?\" John asked the whimpering boys. \"He hit us, John.\" Dick whimpered, rubbing his nose that was dripping blood down his face and onto his shirt. Doc sobbed quietly and held his face in his hands. \"Let me see.\" John said, gently prying the boy's hands from his face and revealing a black eye where the little boy had hit Doc. John grabbed a couple of cool clothes and gave one to Doc, pressing it against his eye. \"Hold that there.\" He told him. \"It'll bring the swelling down.\" He then turned his attention to Dick. He gently wiped the blood from the boy's nose then pinched it gently with the cloth when it continued to bleed. \"Tip your head back, Richard.\" He said. Dick tipped his head back while John held the rag over his bleeding nose then a few moments later John took the rag away and allowed him to look back down. His nose wasn't bleeding anymore but it sure was sore. \"Well, you'll both have a shiner, but I think you'll live.\" John said with a kind smile. \"That kid's got a good arm on him for a little guy.\" Dick said, still holding the cold rag against his nose to help the swelling. Doc sniffled and nodded, still holding his rag against his black eye. \"He's got fists like rocks.\" He whimpered. John sighed, and lifted the rag gently from Doc's eye. \"He did do quite a number on you both didn't he?\" He muttered. Suddenly the guest bedroom door flew open and Alex came out. \"I'm going to get the doctor.\" He said. \"That little guy doesn't look to good.\" John nodded and watched him walk out to get the buggy. Dick and Doc looked up at John. \"Are you two alright?\" He asked. \"Do you want some codeine powder?\" Dick shook his head but Doc nodded. \"Alright.\" John said, and stood up before walking to the kitchen to get the codeine down from the medicine cabinet. He poured a little bit of the powder into two glasses of water. \"Here, Doc...\" He said, walking back over to the blonde boy and handing him a glass, before turning to Dick. \"Richard, why don't you have some too.\" He suggested, handing him the other glass. Dick took it willingly. He'd wanted the painkiller too but he had a tendency to act like a tough guy, so he'd acted like he didn't need it before. \"Thanks, John.\" They both said. John ruffled their hair. \"No trouble at all, lads.\" He replied, standing up. \"Now, why don't you two go on and prepare for bed.\" He suggested. \"I'm going in to check on the little one.\" The boys both nodded and stood up to go out to the bunkhouse, while John went back into the guest room to check on the strange little boy. ... Dr. Mark Davis used his stethoscope to check the heart rate of the unconscious little boy who Allison McSween was currently rocking gently in her arms in John's old rocking chair. \"How is he?\" John asked, from where he stood behind the doctor with Alex and Susan. The doctor sighed and stood up. \"Well his heart rate seems to have returned to normal, so he seems to be alright for now.\" Allison stroked the boy's hair gently. \"Poor baby...\" She said softly. John looked at the doctor. \"What exactly is wrong with him, Doctor?\" He asked. Doctor Davis turned to face all of them. \"Well, John, there's nothing wrong with him physically.\" He said. \"But, The boy has a lot very serious problems that I can't do anything about.\" John nodded. \"It's psychological then?\" He asked. The doctor nodded. \"Yes sir.\" He confirmed, running a hand over his tired face. \"What the boy's got is somethin' called Panic Disorder. People sometimes refer to it as \"Weakness of the Nerves\", and it's more than often passed off as cowardice, but in fact it's a very serious issue.\" John sighed. \"Is there anything we can do?\" He asked. Doctor Davis nodded slowly. \"Actually there is...\" He said. \"See all I can do for him is give ya some sedatives to give him whenever he has an episode, but if the boy could see a psychologist regularly then we might be able to help him a lot.\" \"Our daughter just graduated from medical school.\" Alex spoke up. Susan nodded. \"She's a certified psychologist now.\" The doctor looked back at Allison, who was still holding the little boy and rocking him back and forth gently, then back at John. He sighed. \"John...\" He said to the Englishman. \"As a fellow christian man I know you'll agree with me when I say that this was no coincidence. I believe God sent that little boy here.\" John nodded before crossing the room and looking down at the little boy that Allison was rocking. He was so small, a lot smaller than a boy his age should be. His hair was a dark brown color, and his skin was pale. This was the little eight year old boy who'd escaped from the orphan train. This was Charles Bowdre. John looked back at the doctor. \"You know who he is?\" He asked. Doctor Davis nodded. \"I won't say a word to anyone, John.\" He promised. \"That boy needs a lot of love and care, more so than a normal child would. An orphanage won't give him that. He needs to be with you.\" John nodded and stroked the child's dark hair. This wasn't going to be the same as when he took in the other two boys. He was going to have to put a lot of time and effort into this boy. But even so, John was more than willing to take the child in and give him a home. Even though it was going to be difficult for awhile, he couldn't turn him away. The boy began to stir suddenly, whimpering as he squirmed. \"Shh...\" John whispered, leaning down as he continued to stroke the boy's little forehead to comfort him. \"Don't fret, my boy. You're safe now.\" The boy's whimpering and squirming suddenly ceased and once again he was peacefully asleep in Allison's arms. John smiled. \"You're home now.\" He whispered to the child. \"Everything's going to be alright.\" TBC[Chapter 4] John waited in the hallway at the hospital in New Orleans that he'd taken his new charge to for a recommended series of tests to determine what exactly his mental and emotional problems were and how they could be treated. What there doctor in Lincoln had considered just a case of panic disorder and nothing more had turned out to be panic disorder along with several other issues. So a three days ago John and little Charley had boarded a train to New Orleans and were now here in the mental health ward, getting the little guy a exam. Allison McSween had come along as well. Since she was Charley's physiologist the doctors were going to want to talk to her and give her some idea of how to treat Charley's problems. \"I do hope that it's nothing to serious.\" John said as he and Allison waited for the doctor to call them back to the exam room. Allison gave him a reassuring hand squeeze. \"The boy was able to plan and execute his escape from that orphan train in Albuquerque, John. I'm sure whatever he has it isn't affecting his brain to much.\" John nodded. \"I suppose your right, Allison.\" Ali smiled at him. Suddenly the door to the exam room opened and the nurse to the doctor stepped out. \"Mr. Tunstall, the doctor would like to see you and Ms. McSween in his office.\" She said. John nodded and he and Ali stood and followed the nurse. The doctor was sitting behind his desk with a smile on his face, chuckling amused as little Charley sat on the couch in front of his desk, telling him some kind of story. The nurse shut the door behind John and Allison and looked at the doctor. \"Doctor Camfield?\" She asked. The doctor let out a great laugh all the sudden before looking up at the nurse and John and Allison. \"Oh, come on in, Mr. Tunstall. Ms. McSween. Have a seat.\" John and Allison nodded and came and sat on the couch with Charley, who quickly climbed onto John's lap. The doctor smiled at them all. \"You'll have to excuse me, your boy there is quite the little entertainer.\" He was still chuckling as he spoke. John and Allison both smiled. \"Well I'm glad that you two have gotten along.\" John said. The doctor nodded, as he wiped his watery eyes with a handkerchief before looking up at his nurse. \"Anna, will you be so kind as to take young Charley to get a lollipop. He's been such a good little patient. He deserves a treat.\" He said to the nurse. The young woman smiled and held out her hand for Charley to take. \"Come along, Charley.\" She said gently. Charley looked up at John. \"Go on, my boy.\" He said with a smile. \"Allison and I will be right out.\" Charley smiled and jumped down from John's lap before running over to the nurse and taking her hand. The young woman smiled and led Charley out of the room. The doctor smiled. \"He's a fine boy, Mr. Tunstall.\" He said. \"Thank you, Dr. Camfield.\" He replied with a smile. The doctor nodded. \"He seems a lot happier than the child Dr. Davis described in his letter.\" He said. John and Allison both nodded. \"He's come a long way since he first arrived.\" Allison said. \"That he has.\" John agreed. \"Thanks to Ms. McSween, here, of course. She's been treating the boy ever since he came to us.\" The doctor nodded. \"What school did you attend, Ms. McSween?\" He asked. \"London.\" Allison replied. \"She graduated in the top of her class.\" John added. The doctor nodded. \"A marvelous achievement, Miss McSween. I'm sure your parents are beaming with pride.\" He said with a smile. Ali blushed and smiled back. \"Thank you, Doctor.\" She replied. The doctor gave a nod. \"Your very welcome, young lady, but there's no thanks needed. An accomplishment such as this deserves all the praise in the world. Especially when you've been able to so successfully treat a patient in such little time, and when you've just graduated.\" He continued. Allison's blush got deeper. \"Oh, doctor Camfield, stop, your making me blush.\" She giggled. John and the doctor chuckled a little. \"Well my lovely young colleague, as well as you're doing with young Charley, I do have some suggestions for his treatment. With your consent I'd very much like to share them with you both.\" Ali looked at John and they both nodded. The doctor smiled. \"Wonderful...now, as you know Charley does have some other issues along with the panic disorder, which is what you've been treating him for so far. I've found that he also suffers from an abandonment issue known as Abandoned Child Syndrome. It's a long term abandonment issue that normally occurs shortly after the loss of one or both parents. Now, I know Charley is an orphan, so that's probably why he suffers from this, but I get the feeling that his parents didn't just die. Mr. Tunstall, did the orphanage happen to mention any kind of traumatic occurrence in his earlier years when you adopted him? John thought for a moment. Shortly after Charley had arrived John had gone to the orphanage in Albuquerque where the orphan train had been taking Charley in the first place, and legally adopted him. While he had been there the orphanage supervisor had given him all the information he needed in order to take care of Charley. John nodded to the doctor. \"They told me that his father was killed in a train crash. Right in front of himself and his mother too.\" The doctor sighed. \"The poor child. That would explain the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder that he also suffers from, but the Abandoned Child Syndrome is usually caused by a parent abandoning or neglecting the child.\" Doctor Camfield informed John. John nodded. \"It was more than likely his mother that caused it then when she left him at the orphanage. They told me that she left the boy there when he was four and promised to come back, but four years went by and she never came for him.\" He told the doctor. Doctor Camfield nodded again. \"That would do it.\" He said, voice low. \"That poor child. As sweet as he is you wouldn't think he'd had such a rough time with life.\" John and Ali both nodded in agreement. Doctor Camfield looked up at them again after awhile. \"Now, the treatment I recommend for the Abandoned Child Syndrome is simply a lot of love and comfort. He needs to know that neither of you , or anyone he's close to for that matter, is going to leave him like his mother did. However, if the boy gets to attached to one of you that could cause separation anxiety, so in my opinion he needs the companionship of a another child his own age. Now, Charley has told me that you also have two other young boys with you at the time Mr. Tunstall.\" The doctor said. John nodded. \"Yes sir, I do. Richard and Josiah. They're a bit older than Charley though, but they are very helpful with him.\" He told the doctor. \"Being older though, I assume that the other boys have other activities that they do together in which Charley usually gets left out, correct?\" Dr. Camfield asked. John nodded. \"Sadly yes, but I don't believe they mean to leave him out. He's simply uninterested in their types of entertainment.\" John said. The doctor nodded. \"I have sons as well, Mr. Tunstall and I've often seen the same type of behavior with them. The younger ones just don't share the same interests as the older ones when it comes to fun and games, or even work for that matter. Which is why I think it would be beneficial to Charley's mental and emotional health if he had a young friend a bit closer to his own age.\" The doctor told John. John raised an eyebrow. \"Are you suggesting that I adopt another child, Doctor Camfield?\" He asked. The doctor simply nodded. \"I know it's no small task Mr. Tunstall, but I do believe that Charley's problems could become very close to being completely gone if he had a young companion to his own age to be with. And I'm sure there are plenty of children in New Mexico who would love to have a such a loving home as yours.\" John sat in silence for a moment, thinking the subject over. Ali looked at John anxiously until finally the Englishman finally looked back up. \"If it will in fact help with his condition, I suppose I could take in a new little companion for Charles.\" He said. Ali smiled brightly and the doctor nodded approvingly with a grin. \"I'm happy to hear it Mr. Tunstall.\" He said. \"And as for the boy's post traumatic stress disorder and the night terrors, the therapy sessions with Miss McSween combined with some prescription sedatives before bed should work wonders for the boy.\" John and Ali nodded. \"Thank you, Doctor Camfield.\" John said as he stood up and shook the doctor's hand. \"Yes, thank you, Doctor Camfield.\" Ali said then. The doctor kissed her hand. \"My pleasure.\" He replied to both of them. \"Have a safe trip home now.\" John and Ali nodded as they headed out of the office. \"We will.\" John replied. \"Good day, Doctor Camfield.\" John held the door open for Ali and they both walked out into the waiting room where Charley was waiting with the nurse, who was smiling and holding the child's hand while he sat there telling her some sort of story and licking a lollipop. John smiled. \"Come along now, Charles. We've gotta catch our train in an hour.\" Charley looked up at them. \"Okay...\" He agreed, getting down from his chair before turning to the nurse and kissing her cheek. \"Bye bye, Nurse Anna.\" He told her. The young nurse smiled and blushed. \"Awe, bye bye sweetie.\" She replied, kissing his hand before letting go and watching him walk to John and take his hand and also take Allison's with the other hand before walking down the hall with both of them. They were heading home now, but the journey to cure Charley's illnesses had only just begun here. Luckily for the little boy though, his new companion that John was planning on adopting was going to arrive a lot sooner than anyone planned. ... John had planned to pay a visit to the orphanage in a few months time once he could get the house prepared to shelter yet another child, but a few weeks before he planned on going to Albuquerque the new child ended up making an early appearance. It had been raining for several days in Lincoln and there was nothing but mud and puddles all over the ground outside. Normally in the spring time John would take the boys outside to have their lessons. Since he now had three boys to teach, the idea of enrolling them in the Lincoln school in town had been brought to his attention by Alex and Susan, but John preferred to teach the boys himself. For the last few days though, the boys had been having their lessons inside the house due to the rain, and one day in the middle of a writing lesson, a big thunderstorm blew in and John rushed all of the boys down towards the storm cellar outside. \"Hurry now, lads.\" John told them as he held a very scared Charley in his arms and followed Dick and Doc down the stairs of the storm cellar. Richard had the lantern so he was going down first with Doc following him and John coming behind them, carrying Charley. \"Don't fret my boy...\" John said to Charley as he closed the cellar door and followed the other boys down. \"Everything's going to be just...\" \"Whoa!\" Richard suddenly exclaimed and stopped in his tracks, before moving the lantern around and looking everywhere around the cellar. The others all stopped behind him. \"What is it Richard?\" John asked with concern. Richard turned to look at him, eyes wide with a fear John had never seen before. \"There's somethin' in here, John.\" He whispered quietly so that Charley wouldn't hear him and get scared. John gave Dick a serious look and gently handed Charley over to Doc. \"Hold on just a moment, Charles. I have to help Richard with something. John walked down the stairs to Dick and then took the lantern. \"Hand me your gun, Richard.\" He said. Dick pulled his gun from its holster and handed it to John. John looked back at the boys. \"Stay close to me.\" He told them as he slowly walked around the cellar, shining the lantern light in every corner to check for whatever or whoever it was that Richard had seen. There didn't seem to be anything strange here, and John was about to give up the search, but suddenly when the lantern light shone on a barrel that had once stored apples, John noticed movement from inside, and a pile of apples that had know doubt once been in the barrel, lying on the ground next to it. \"Stay right there, all of you.\" He said to the boys before slowly approaching the barrel with Richard's pistol cocked and ready if the need for it arose. Charley was beginning to sob. \"John...\" He whimpered, wanting his adopted father to hold him and settle his fears. \"It's okay, Charley.\" Doc assured him. \"John's gonna take care of it.\" \"Shh!\" Richard shushed them. \"Be quiet. You'll spook it.\" They all quieted down and watched John approach the barrel. Slowly John reached for the barrel lid and knocked it off the top of the barrel. He then took the lantern and held it above the barrel so he could see down into it. What he saw shocked and relieved him at the same time. At first all he could see was a little head full of messy brown hair, but then the owner of that head turned his their up to look at him and John found himself looking down into the big, scared brown eyes of a young boy. John breathed a sigh of relief and lowered the gun after pushing the hammer back down and unloading it. \"It's alright lads.\" He called to the other boys. \"There's no need to be afraid.\" The three boys came closer and John lowered the lantern a bit so that the light wasn't blinding the mystery child. \"Hello my boy. May I ask what you're doing in that barrel?\" He asked the child. The little boy cowered down into the barrel. \"It's alright lad.\" John assured him. \"Come on out. There's no reason to be afraid.\" The boy then slowly began to climb out of the barrel where he'd been hiding. Once they could see all of him it was very clear that the child was an orphan. He looked half starved to death and he was absolutely filthy. Dirt streaked his pale skin from head to toe and his clothes were worn and tattered. John gave the boy a kind expression. \"Hello young man.\" He greeted him. \"What might your name be?\" The boy coughed before replying with a very thick southern drawl, \"Uh..I'm uh..Steven Stephens...Steve to my friends...some call me Dirty Steve.\" John nodded. \"Steven. A fine name. My name is John Tunstall, and the young men behind you are Richard Brewer, Josiah Scurlock, and Charles Bowdre.\" The other boys waved to the new boy. He slowly waved back. \"It's nice to meet ya Mr. Tunstall.\" He said to John then, extending a hand. John shook the boys hand with a smile. \"It's a pleasure to meet you as well, Steven.\" He replied. \"Now, would you care to share with us how exactly you ended up in our storm shelter?\" He then asked him. Steve looked at the floor. \"I'm awful sorry bout that, Sir.\" He said, low. \"It's jus' that I been out of food ever since I crossed the state line into New Mexico and well...I was real hungry.\" John nodded. \"That's quite alright my boy. No harm done.\" He told the child. There was a long silence until John spoke once more. \"Are you alone, Steven?\" He asked. Steve nodded slowly, still looking at the ground. \"I ran off so's they didn't throw me in no boys home after Pa died...I come all the way from Alabama. Been livin' out in the open country ever since.\" The boy explained. John frowned. The poor thing. He looked like he'd been through a lot of rough times, and if there was anyone who could use a good home it was probably him. Maybe it was John's soft spot for troubled youth that pushed him to make the decision, or maybe it was just his kind, caring heart, but whatever the reason the fact still stood that John was in fact in desperate need of a companion for little Charley, and it just so happened that this boy was the perfect age for Charley to pal around with. \"Well, Steven...\" John finally said. \"The wilderness is no place for a child to be living. I think it's time you found a home.\" The child shook his head in fear. \"I don't wanna be put in no boys home, Mr. Tunstall.\" He said, frantically. \"I heard real bad things about them sorts a places.\" \"Those sorts of places.\" John corrected him. \"And what I meant was that I would be happy for you to stay here if you'd like.\" Steve looked confused for a moment. \"But..but you don't even know me...\" He said. John grinned. \"Well what better way to get to know you?\" He asked. \"I've been looking to hire on a new hand for quite some time now, and I think you'd make a fine addition.\" Steve gnawed at his lip as he mulled the idea over in his head. \"Are ya sure I won't be a bother?\" He asked finally. \"Most folks sorta look down on me on the 'count a I ain't got no learnin'.\" John just smiled at the boy. \"Of course you won't be a bother.\" He assured him. \"And as for the learning issue, we can fix that soon enough I'm sure. The decision is your's to make, Steven. Would you like to stay?\" The other boys looked at Steve anxiously. The young ruffian thought long and hard about the decision at hand but finally he looked back up at them all and replied, \"Yeah, I'd like to stay with ya'll, if'n ya don't mind.\" John smiled and ruffled the boys messy hair. He'd now welcomed his fourth member to the little family he'd made for himself here in Lincoln, and now little Charley would have a friend closer to his own age who would hopefully help him overcome his issues. Everything seemed perfect now, and John was perfectly content with his four adopted sons. But not long after Steve's arrival at the ranch, John was to be blessed with a fifth son, but this son was going to be a lot different than the others, that much was certain. TBC ","Summary":" The morning sun rose and lit the little town of Lincoln, New Mexico fully at around seven o' clock."},{"Movie":"Batman: Under the Red Hood","Title":"Jaybird's Nightmares","Author":"Jadewing47","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12557708","Passage":"[Chapter 1] It's a quiet night in Blüdhaven, there are no cars rushing down the dark streets, and the loud, smelly buses had retired for the night. The midnight critters had long since gone to their homes, not wanting to risk going out on this quiet, still, suspicious night. And that's just what it was; suspicious. Blüdhaven was just too still, just too quiet. It was the kind of quiet that made the back of your neck prickle, the kind of quiet that made you want to scream just to hear some sort of sound in the dark night. Dick Grayson, fully dressed in his Nightwing gear, jumped and flipped and swung on his grappling hook, darting across dark rooftops, searching for any sign of crime. But he found none. Coming to a stop, perched on the edge of a tall, grey building, Nightwing realized that the only time he had seen any sign of life tonight was a late-night worker rushing into his house, and that had been 3 hours ago. It was like the city and all life in it was holding it's breath, waiting for something terrible to happen. And it felt so wrong. So wrong that Nightwing had to take a couple deep breaths to steady himself because it was the exact same feeling, exact same scenario that he had been faced with before Jason's death. Nightwing scanned the dark sky, the moon hidden from view by hazy clouds, or was it a new moon tonight? Nightwing could not remember. He looked down into the dark streets of Blüdhaven, even jumping to a couple other buildings, trying to find a body, a machine, a criminal, something to explain the bad feelings... And then Nightwing's earlier thought process finally caught up to him, like a boulder to the face and he stumbles, landing hard next to a puddle of murky water and the feeling of unease suddenly turns to dread because Jason. And this was the exact same feeling he'd had before Jason died, before he was murdered. Before any rational thought could process in his head, Nightwing was running, running, running. At a speed that would put Wally West to shame. And he was on his motorcycle, speeding towards one of Red Hood's 'secret' safe-houses that only Nightwing was aware of. Besides Jason himself of course. But then again, he's not even sure that Jason knows Nightwing is aware of the safe-house. Nightwing isn't exactly sure why the unsettling silence of his city made him sick to his stomach with worry over Jason , who was in Gotham. (He thinks) But Nightwing is 97% sure that Bruce has something to do with it, and yet again before he thinks his hand his slamming on the button that controls the communicator in his ear from his motorcycle. We haven't talked in so long... \"What?\" Came a Bruce's angry voice in Nightwing's ear. And then the surpresed anger Dick had been keeping at bay bubbles to the surface. \"What the hell did you do to Jason?\" Dick yells, because suddenly he isn't Nightwing anymore. He's Dick Grayson who is worried sick about his younger brother. \"What?\" Bruce's voice barks again, but this time laced with something close to confusion. \"Don't mess with me Bruce.\" Nightwing warns, his voice dripping with venom. \"Dick...\" Bruce's voice is hesitant, \"What's going on? Did Jason hurt you? Is he with you?\" \"Answer the Damm question.\" \"I don't know how to answer that Dick.\" Bruce replies, and suddenly his voice is tired. \"Just.\" Dick sighs, he really didn't want to fight, \"did you two fight recently?\" \"A couple hours ago, why?\" Dick tenses, and that cold feeling of dread is intensifying. \"Nothing, just, sorry to bother you, Bruce.\" \"Dick, tell me what the hell is going on or so help me-\" \"I see any sign of you or Batman around Jason for the next week I will personally make sure you can't fight for a fucking year, you got me?\" \"Dick, I don't know what's going on but-\" \"You got me?!\" \"Fine, I won't go around him. But that doesn't mean I'm not keeping tabs.\" Nightwing cuts the call.[Chapter 2] A couple blocks away from Jason's safe-house, Dick parked his Nightwing motorcycle in a hidden spot, and headed for the safe-house. As he ran, his hidden doubts begin to surface in his mind. What if Jason's hurt? What if he isn't there? What if he doesn't want to talk? What if he runs away? The last thought struck Dick as the most important. He hadn't always been there when Jason and Bruce, (Batman and Red Hood) had fought. But he did know that they were nasty, and lately whenever Red Hood was aware that Batman had spotted him he ran. So Dick was not confident at all that Jason wouldn't take off at first sight of him. So Dick decided he would sneak in, maybe watch Jason a bit to make sure he was ok. Yeah, maybe he sounded like a stalker... but he was worried about his little brother. Reaching an old building that had been abandoned for a couple years, convienently hidden from view and in a near deserted part of Gotham, Dick crept around it. The building was small, and it was old. Trash littered around the side, and most of the windows were boarded up. The door was securely locked, but although Dick knew he could easily pick the lock, he decided to enter the safe-house via the window. Unlocking the window in under 7 seconds, Dick quietly dropped into the safe-house, closing the window as he went. Melting into the shadows, Dick scanned the room. It was rather unpleasant, a small kitchen was to his left, along with the locked door. There was an open door which lead to a tiny, dirty bathroom behind Dick, and to his right was the rest of the house, which consisted of a small desk with a black laptop sitting on top, a ratty wooden chair next to the desk, a small coffee table with an open box of bullets, a gun, to knifes, a pair of headphones, and a small picture. Placed a couple feet away from the coffee table was a worn out, dirty red couch that looked like it was going to fall apart at any moment. Jason Todd lay across the couch, an iPod clutched firmly in his hand. He was scrolling through songs, and seamed to pick one just as Dick got in. Before Dick could take in Jason's appearance or make notice that he was there, the song Jason had picked began to play, and Dick was thrown into a wave of memories. He remembered this song. The movie-soundtrack-like intro of Narcissistic Cannibal began to play. Back when Jason was Robin and living at the manor he used to blast this song in his room whenever he could, especially when he was angry. Then Bruce had gone and bought Jason that dreaded red guitar, and he would play it as loud as he could, screaming the lyrics and playing until his fingers cut open. Dick was snapped back into the present as Jason began to sing. And as he listened to the lyrics, Dick realized that the song related so much to Jason, it could have been written for him. Also, Dick realized that when Jason wasn't screaming the lyrics to angry songs, he had a beautiful voice. Don't wanna be sly and defile you Desecrate my mind and rely on you I just wanna break this crown But it's hard when I'm so run down And you're so cynical, Narcissistic Cannibal! Got to bring myself back from the dead! Sometimes, I hate, the life, I made Everything's wrong every time Pushing on I can't escape Everything that comes my way Is haunting me taking its sweet time Holding on I'm lost in a haze Fighting life to the end of my days Don't wanna be rude but I have to Nothing's good about the hell you put me through I just need to look around See that life that has come unbound And you're so cynical, Narcissistic Cannibal Got to bring myself back from the dead Sometimes, I hate, the life I made Everything's wrong every time Pushing on I can't escape Everything that comes my way Is haunting me taking its sweet time Sometimes, I hate, the life I made Everything's wrong every time Pushing on I can't escape Everything that comes my way Is haunting me taking its sweet time Holding on I'm lost in a haze Fighting life to the end of my days Holding on I'm lost in a haze Fighting life to the end of my days The song ended, and for a second all was quiet, before Jason whispered, \"Sometimes, I hate, the life I made. Everything is wrong every time.\" Then he threw the iPod across the room. He sighed softly, sinking into the couch. Dick watched, frozen, as Jason's eyes slowly close. As soon as they do though, he snaps them open, rolling off the couch onto his feet, growling. He takes one step before his knees buckle, and Dick can't get there fast enough before Jason's head slams against the floor. Review please and I will continue!![Chapter 3] (Previously ) He sighed softly, sinking into the couch. Dick watched, frozen, as Jason's eyes slowly close. As soon as they do though, he snaps them open, rolling off the couch onto his feet, growling. He takes one step before his knees buckle, and Dick can't get there fast enough before Jason's head slams against the floor. \"Jay!\" Dick yells, dropping to his knees by Jason's face. His mouth falls open in shock as he takes in Jason's appearance. His face is pale, black hair dirty and tangled. He's much too skinny to be healthy, and he's trembling, his pale green eyes, faded and drooping. Dick gently brushes Jason's white bangs from his forehead to get a better look at his face, then flinches when he touches Jason's skin. He's so cold. Something wasn't right, and Dick was beginning to feel very relieved that he had come. At Dick's touch, Jason seamed to snap out of whatever trance he had been in, and he moved his head, pastel green eyes flickering up to meet Dick's blue ones. (Dick's POV) \"Dick?\" Jason whispered. His voice was hoarse and he struggled to lift his head from the dirty floor. \"The one and only.\" I reply, carefully calculating my options. It was clear that Jason was not well, and needed help, but it wasn't like I could just take him back to the manor. First of all, Bruce and I were not on good terms at all, even though I'm sure Tim and Alfie would welcome us, I don't trust Bruce around Jason. And Jason would not agree at all to coming home. As soon as we had learned that Jason was alive, Bruce had been searching for him non-stop. But when he finally found him, they had fought and Bruce had been ruthless, going into full Batman mode. (I had found the video feed, and I herd Jason's pained grunts and yells.) Now Jason wouldn't even come near any of the Bats, and he certainly would not want to come home. But it also wasn't like I could just leave him here either. The safe-house was dirty and smelly. It was obvious that Jason did not have very much food because he wasn't eating anything, and by the looks of it, he wasn't getting enough sleep either. No, I couldn't leave him here. Fear lit up in Jason's eyes and he began to weakly struggle. \"N-no! No no you can't! Please!\" He screams, but it comes out more like a strangled choke. \"Jason, hey what's wrong?\" \"No no you can't take me back! Please Dick y-you can't!\" he begs. Admist his struggling, Jason managed to get into a sitting position, and now he slumps against me, breathing heavily and shaking violently. I'm at loss of what to say. I knew Jason wouldn't want to come to the manor, but I didn't know that he would freak-out this much. I decided to play dumb. \"Why?\" I ask softly. Jason freezes, and I can feel his muscles go super tense. He shakes his head, lips pressed firmly closed. \"Please Jaybird, I promise I won't take you ok? Just tell me why.\" Jason lifts his head slowly, and whisperers so softly I have to stain to hear, \"Bruce hates me. I-I'm a monster. He doesn't w-want me in his family, a-anymore. He never did.\" A feeling akin to guilt floods my system, and I mentally stagger back. \"Oh God Jay no, that's not tr-\" \"Don't lie to me \" he snarls, trying one again to get up but failing miserably. I scoop him up into my arms, shocked and worried about how skinny he is. Jason gives a tiny yelp, but then quietly leans into me. This also concerns me. As much as I love hugs and stuff, Jason wasn't someone who would ever willingly give up like that. Something was seriously wrong with him, and I felt guilty for not getting there quicker. I find Jason's precious leather jacket on the floor beside two guns and his red gloves. With that, I find his keys and get out of the safe-house the normal human way, through the door, locking it behind me and carrying Jay to my motorcycle, securing him in front of me and speeding away to my apartment in Bludhaven.[Chapter 4] Upon reaching my apartment, I'm forced to use my grappling hook to break in through the window, pulling Jason inside with me. Jason makes no protest, his body is limp, cold, and lifeless. His eyes are dim and staring up at nothing. In fact, the only reason Dick knew Jason was alive was because of his choked breathing and faint heartbeat. Had Jason been breathing quietly, Dick would have been panicking as he tried to get a pulse. Pulling Jason through the window, Dick renables his security system, drawing the dark curtains closed and turning on the lights. Compared to Jason's safe-house, Dick's apartment was a mansion. Dick stood with Jason leaning against him in a moderately-sized living room, in front of a large, dark blue couch. The television was behind them, with a chestnut coloured bookshelf on each side full of books, movies, and video games. There was a dark blue carpet, and a chestnut coffee table in front of them. To the right was the bathroom and Dick's bedroom, and to their left was the kitchen a small dining room. Dick brought Jason to his bedroom. The walls were a light ocean shade of blue. The floor was wooden. In the left side of the room was a small bookshelf and a desk. The desk had a laptop and a closed file sitting on top. In the center of the room was Dick's bed, with orange sheets and blankets. There was a small nightstand with a lamp to the left of the bed, and to the right sat the closet and dresser. Laying Jason down on the bed, Dick pondered what to do. The first concern on his mind was what was wrong with Jay, and he wondered how to approach that. Dick dragged his desk chair to the bed and sat beside Jason's head. \"Are you hurt?\" He asked. It took a couple long seconds for Jason to tear his blank gaze from the ceiling to Dick, but he did. \"Huh?\" Jason said slowly, confusion written on his face. \"Bruce told me you and him had a fight recently.\" Dick explained, watching Jason's muscles go tense. \"I know how ruthless he can be in \"full Batman mode\",\" Dick explained, hoping to ease some of the tension from Jason's body. \"You seemed really...not okay in your apartment, this is me trying to figure out what's wrong.\" Dick frowned when the tension in Jason only seemed to increase. \"Nothing's wrong.\" Jason snapped. He seemed to take in his surroundings. \"Where are we?\" he asked, frowning. Dick was confused, Didn't Jason recognize the place? \"I-It's my apartment.\" Dick replied, and Jason seemed to frown more. \"Really?\" He asked, and when Dick nodded, \"Oh. It's...nice.\" he said, sorrow claiming his tone. Dick felt a tug on his heart. He guessed that Jason hadn't really seen a place as nice as Dick's after his \"death\". Pushing those thoughts aside, Dick still had questions, questions that needed answers. \"I'm still confused, and worried Jay,\" Dick said, and if Jason had at all relaxed, he definitely wasn't now. \"What happened back there?\" Jason's face took a dark pained look, and he turned away from Dick. \"Don't worry about it,\" Jason growled. The next part Jason probably didn't intend for Dick to hear, but he did, and it killed him. \"It's not like anybody ever did, so why start now?\"[Chapter 5] I jumped up, in the process hitting his leg with my arm by accident. Jason screamed, his body arching back before going limp once again. \"Jay!\" I yell. \"Jason!\" At first I think he's passed out, but then I hear him growl through gritted teeth, \"Shut. up.\" \"Lemme see.\" \"It's nothing.\" If it was nothing then you wouldn't have screamed. \"Jay, lemme see.\" I insist. Jason growled, but tears are beginning to shine in his eyes. \"Leg's not bad.\" He said softly. He opens his mouth, as if about to say something, but then decides against it and snaps it shut. I sit beside him on the bed, next to his face, gripping his shoulders and gently pulling him to lay on his back. Jason flinches, and bites his lip, hard. \"Jay.\" No response. \"Come on Jaybird.\" Still nothing, however tears are threatening to spill from his eyes. \"BlueJay,\" I whisper, using his old nickname, his eyes meet mine, and the tears are falling. I grip his hands, gently rubbing small circles on them with my thumbs. \"What did Bruce do?\" Because I know. I know something about that fight has something to do with it. Jason whimpers, and gestures to his abdomen. Bile rises in my throat as I spot the hilt of a bat-a-rang embedded in Jason's side. How could he? How could Bruce do that? Hell, h ow could I not notice that? Jason's crying hard now, and desperately trying to explain to me what had happened. \"I-I wasn't fast enough.\" he says first, though stops when I meet his eyes. We both know that he is. I've watched him dodge Bruce's attacks so many times. Yeah, no one was perfect, but if Jason was going down, it wasn't gonna be by one of Batman's batarangs, not even if he was super unfocused. Something was up. Jason, knowing that I wasn't buying it, seemed to deflate. \"I-no. That's not-I mean, you know-I-I just, I-I don't know I...\" My grip on Jason's hand's tighten slightly, and I squeeze them in what I hope is reassuring. \"Jay, what happened?\" I ask softly, refusing to break eye contact with him. \"I...I didn't dodge. I-I didn't want to. I don't know why, I just,\" Jason's eyes are filled with pain, \"I crawled out of my own grave, my fingernails ripped off as I broke the top of the coffin off. I crawled out and it was raining, and there was dirt in my mouth and I hurt everywhere, and-\" Jason cuts himself off, his breaths are harsh and panicked. He was going to have a panic attack if I didn't act quick. \"Hey, shuush,\" I whispered, stroking Jason's white bangs and whispering nonsense to him. \" I get it Jay, I really do. You were alone and in pain. Fuck, who am I kidding? You still are in pain, I can see it now, even more than you probably were before. Jay, I know I haven't been the best big brother to you. Ugh, fuck it. I haven't been a big brother to you at all. I wish I could say that I knew what you felt like, what you still feel like, but I can't really. I felt sorta like you had when I found out that Bruce had given you Robin. But it wasn't really like how you felt. I had already moved on. But still, I resented you at first, but then you grew on me. I didn't really know how to apologize or change my behavior. But, Jay, lemme try now. I love you. I know you might think differently, but, oh god Jay I really do. J-jay, I can't lose you again. You are worth it, so much. And if you can't see that you are to everyone else, then see that you are to me. I love you. Please, dodge next time. Please Jay. Promise me you'll dodge.\" I could feel the tears streaming down my face, and the shocked look in Jason's eyes hurts me, but he gives me a weak smile, one that actually reaches his eyes. \"o-okay,\" he whispers, \"I promise.\" and for a moment there, we are just two brothers, with a new-found bond that feels so big and beyond me that it's unbreakable... But the moment ends when Jason suddenly leans to the side, coughing up blood. Review and I will continue. I'm thinking about making this a long story, like Jason moving in with Dick and how that goes and all that stuff. Tell me what you think! Jadewing out![Chapter 6] Dick was really beginning to regret not hiding a first aid kit in his room, as the only ones he had were located in the kitchen and the bathroom. The bathroom provided the least amount of distance from Dick's room, yet it was still a little ways down the hall. Dick stands, bile rising to his throat as he stares at the bat-a-rang embedded in Jason's abdomen. \"I'm gonna go and get the first aid kit, I'm gonna help you Jay, I'll be right back.\" Dick murmurs, beginning to walk out of the room. He needed to do this fast. Dick is stopped by a hand wrapping around his, squeezing it painfully tight. \" Please ,\" Jason begs, his eyes are blown wide with fear, and there is blood on his face from his coughing fit. \"Don't leave.\" Dick feels his heart give a painful lurch. \"I'm gonna come back, I promise, but I need to fix you up so you can heal.\" Dick reassures him, and Jason reluctantly lowers his hand, his head flopping back into the bed. It takes Dick a few minutes to retrieve the first aid kit and return to Jason's side, as his hasty steps had faltered mid-way through the hallway as a thought entered his head. Jason had been stabbed. Stabbed. And all he had been doing was laying on his couch. Did he... did he not want to get medical help? Dick wanted to scream. Why hadn't any of the Bat's noticed Jason's pain earlier? oOo It takes Dick a good twenty minutes to coax Jason into listing his injuries. When he does, Jason's voice is dead, flat, devoid of all emotion. Three cracked ribs, fracture to his left leg, bullet wound in his shoulder, and of course, the bat-a-rang. But these are only the physical injuries. Dick knows there are more, and he can point some out himself just by looking at his younger brother. Jason hasn't been eating. Dick suspects that. Jason's body temperature is concerningly low, his face is pale, he is really weak, etc. Dick's assumption is also based on all the other information he has gathered that pointed to a rather screwed-up mental state, Jason is choosing not to eat. The thought brings tears to Dick's eyes, but he furiously binks them away. After all, it was an educated guess, not a fact. Second issue is sleep. The huge dark circles under Jason's eyes, and basically everything about Jason is screaming 'I'm not sleeping!' rather obviously. Dick isn't sure whether it's because Jason is choosing not to, can't, or a mix of both. He'll have to ask him later. It takes Dick about an hour to fix Jason up, and once he has finished and cleaned up, Dick thinks they both need a good night's sleep. They can discuss this problem more in the morning. Dick begins to explain this to Jason, but he is abruptly cut off by Jason shooting foreward in bed, gripping Dick's wrist, whcih had been pulling the covers down, painfully. \" NO. \" For a moment, Dick can only stare in fear. Yes, Dick is afraid. Not because of the painfully tight grip on his wrist that almost certainly will leave a nasty bruise. Not because of the way the one word, \"sleep\" had fueled Jason with enough strength to sit up and attempt to block Dick, when before Jason couldn't even stand. Not because of how Jason's body trembled so hard he looked as though he were vibrating like a speedster. Not because of how all the blood in Jason's face had drained, making him look like a ghost. Dick could list a few more scary things Jason was doing that he was not afraid of, but the fear that was choking his gut made his tongue feel like sandpaper, and he couldn't move. The room was dark, something Dick hadn't noticed until now. A chilly breeze blew in from the open window. The dark curtains blew gently with it, and the breeze tousled Jason's hair, his white bangs dancing around his forehead, making him look even more eerie. The space around the bed was bathed in a green light, and it wasn't from a creepy nightlight. Nope. Dick's eyes were glued to Jason's, and he found he couldn't look away. Jason's eyes were filled with haunting pain, suffering, and fear. And they were glowing a fucking neon green.[Chapter 7] It took Dick a long while to finally regain his voice. \"J-Jay?\" He whispered. Jason blinked, as if only now realizing what was happening. He released his grip on Dick's wrist immediately, scooting backwards until his back was pressed up against the headboard of Dick's bed, drawing his knees to his chest, somehow despite his injuries. Jason blinked hard a few times, and the neon green light faded from his eyes. The room was suddenly much darker, and Dick was shocked at how bright Jason's eyes must have been glowing. \"I-I'm sorry,\" Jason whispered faintly, and if Dick hadn't still been frozen in shock he wouldn't have heard the broken voice. Dick shook himself, realizing that he still had his Nightwing suit on and hadn't taken a shower yet. \"I'll be right back.\" Dick whispered, missing the look of raw panic that filled Jason's eyes as he left the room. Dick entered the bathroom and closed the door. He striped from his suit, sitting on the toilet seat as he waited for the water to warm up in the shower. Seeing his phone sitting on the counter, he picked it up and unlocked it. The text he saw from Bruce made his blood boil. Are you okay? Is everything alright? Dick took a deep breath, however he couldn't stop the angry tears from rolling down his cheeks. It wasn't fair! Yeah, Jason's way of stopping crime was wrong, compared to Bruce's standards, and for a while that's all the family could think about. Hell, it's probably still the only thing the family could think about. Dick had stepped out of his blind stupor when Tim had come home after missing for a week. He had told Bruce, Damian, and Alfred that he was really sorry, but the fight he'd had with Bruce had pushed him over the edge and he had needed some time on his own. The cold glare anyone would receive after asking Tim where he had stayed was frightening, and caused the questioner to hold any further inquiries, even Damian. Tim didn't wish to discuss it, and it was hard to tell if Tim was lying. Tim had been fighting with Bruce before he disappeared, and he'd yelled about him 'having enough' and how he 'couldn't take it anymore'. Bruce may not have actually believed Tim, however he'd made an effort to not fight as much with the teen or push him. The night Tim had come home, however, he had came to Dick's room with a confession. He told Dick that, although the fight with Bruce had initially caused Tim to escape into the night as Red Robin, he hadn't actually intended to leave for so long. He had been distracted by his emotions and allowed himself to get stabbed. Jason had found him, taken him to his safe-house, and taken care of him until he had been ready to leave. Not without forcing Tim to promise to never say a word to Bruce, of had told Dick because he knew Dick really cared about his younger brother, and thought that maybe this information could snap him back into reality to actually realize that fact. It did. Fuck you Bruce. With that said, Dick stepped into the shower, a bit of the tenison lifted from his shoulders. It may have only been a little bit, but it made a difference, and it filled Dick with a strange sort of hopeful feeling. He could save Jason. He could fix the screwed up relationship they had. He could prove to Jason that he mattered and that Dick loved him. He would. oOo Finished with his shower, which only lasted about six minutes, Dick towelled off his hair, and pulled on his pajamas; a deep blue t-shirt and a pair of grey sweats. Stepping back into his room, he was met with complete blackness. Dick switched on a lamp beside his bed, and was shocked to see Jason in the same position as he was before. He was trembling, silent tears rolling down his cheeks as he stared at the bed in silence. Shit! \"Jay,\" Dick murmured, climbing into the bed to sit beside his brother. Jason noticeably stiffened, however remained silent, choosing to ignore Dick's greeting. \"Little Wing, you know I'm not mad at you, right?\" Dick asked, contemplating whether it was okay to touch the younger man. Boy. Dick corrected himself in his head. Jason was only 15 when he died. He's still mentally a boy, in some aspects. Jason glanced at Dick out of the corner of his eye. \"You...you're not?\" He asked softly, voice raspy from the tears. \"No of course not Jay! To be honest I was just a little spooked, that's all.\" Jason's gae dropped to the floor, and Dick mentally winced. That came out wrong. \"So, you're afraid of me.\" Jason said flatly, more tears running down his face. \"It's okay. I would be too.\" Horror gripped Dick's gut and squeezed. \"No! No that's not it! I'm not afraid of you , Jason, I was just spooked 'cause I didn't know you could do that. How, exactly, can you do that?\" Jason frowned, and gave the smallest of shrugs. \"I don't know. It happened when I...uh, wh-when I came back.\" Jason explained quickly. Mental note: Jason's death scares him. Dick thought. Perhaps that was the cause behind some of Jason's odd behavior. \"What causes it?\" Dick asked. \"Or, do you just like...do it?\" \"It happens whenever I get like, bad emotions; like if I'm frightened or angry or something. Sometimes...well often I get these sensory overload things, and it gets bad. The light also sorta dampens my emotions. If I let it get bad...well...people die.\" Jason said. \"What about sleeping made you scared?\" Dick asked, and immediately regretted it as Jason's pupils dilated, his breath shortening, his face quickly growing pale. \"Hey, hey it's okay, it's okay, Jay. We don't have to do that. How about we just lay under the covers? We don't have to sleep. Just lay there. That okay, BlueJay?\" Dick reassures him, and Jason nods, allowing Dick to maneuver him so he's laying down, pulling the blanket around them both. Dick turns out the lamp, his eyes adjusting quickly to see Jason trembling beside him. Dick runs a comforting hand through Jason's hair. \"It's okay, BlueJay. I'm here.\" Dick whispers, and it's not long before both boys are asleep. ","Summary":" It's a quiet night in Blüdhaven, there are no cars rushing down the dark streets, and the loud, sme"},{"Movie":"Top Gun","Title":"Devil of the Skies","Author":"Blue Moon One","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13053541","Passage":"[Chapter 1] SUMMARY Modern AU \"Can you hear me, pilot with the lightning bolt?\" In the year 2018, Canada has declared war on America who is backed by no one but their own forces as Canada brings Britain into play along with an unusual asset... A mercenary fighter pilot, born and raised Canadian they gave her a spot as fleet commander with her lethal SU-33. The TOPGUN trainees have no choice but to be on the front lines with this pilot tracing the skies, and they figure out that war is more brutal up close than it is in a classroom.[Chapter 2] \"They call her Spitfire, and she is deadly,\" Viper spoke in a voice that even made the pilots question his ability in air to air combat. Her aircraft was seen on the board, a large SU-33 in a scheme that reminded Iceman of fire- the exact opposite of himself . A picture surfaced, a young girl who looked not even close to an adult was standing by the jet that was now front facing. She was pale skinned and brown-gold with slight red coloured hair and dull grey green eyes that showed a remorseless gaze. Her helmet was black, pure black with little flame decals on the sides; and it made him feel strange. Those eyes that seemed empty now that he thought about it, something was so...off about this young fighter pilot. \"She has fired down many of our own, killed many American pilots. She has succeeded in aerial dominance, and only sixteen years old.\" Viper explained. \"Spitfire may be our worst aerial foe yet, no one knows who trained her and many believe the Egyptian goddess of war Bastet has possessed her.\" \"What does that mean? Some fictional cat goddess is making her the deadly pilot she is?\" Maverick asked from beside him, he seemed rather amused, stereotypical cocky pilot who had a knack for not listening. \"Mitchell this may be something else. There are rumours she is a real psychic. And if she is that helps with her combat ability.\" Iceman pointed out. \"Psychic abilities aren't real Kazansky,\" Maverick said, rolling his eyes, lying back on the chair. \"How do we know? If we get this kid we may be able to run cover experiments on her.\" There was something about his voice that made some of the pilots look uneasy. \"If we all don't die,\" Maverick argued. \"We won't die,\" Goose told him. \"Spitfire is miles away from here, her airspace is the Indian Ocean, remember?\" \"We were there, Goose,\" Maverick reminded. \"We saw her flying around at night, firing down our Tomcats with ease. This pilot is not human!\" \"She never was,\" Kazansky told him. \"This is a teenage pilot who gives no mercy, how is she human? No man or woman would kill someone without feeling guilt!\" It was a valid point, no normal(or not traumatized) human being would slaughter many others just for the thrill of it. Unless they were a sociopath or psychopath of course. Maybe Spitfire was so young she thought it was just a game? That aerial warfare was nothing more than something like a card game, War. It was another valid point, if he met this girl in the air it was likely he was facing a literal child. Ice felt uneasy about this, something was so terribly wrong about having to see a young fighter pilot that was grinning a little, smirking almost with a stare numb as ice yet blazing like fire. Spitfire . They were dismissed soon after, and those images never left his head. They swirled in his head, and soon that small images of her holding a gun to his head, only they had heard a snippet of her voice taunting a few pilots before she killed them. \"I will end your life lieutenant, I will make sure the world hears of my accomplishments!\" Her voice hissed like an angered feline, slightly tinted with British and the harshness of German, the generousness of a Canadian which was where she was born. It was so eerily strange, like something out of a horror show, a sci fi horror show. Iceman went off to the quarters, taking out the computer he had. He wanted to research more about this mercenary fighter pilot. But how did she get ahold of that jet? How did a young civilian like her get ahold of that Sukhoi SU-33? A navy aircraft that was better than an American navy aircraft, the Russians made sure their craft were the best. It was chilled, her jet looked far menacing with its dark colour scheme in which the red-orange parts gleamed under the frosty moonlight. It made a couple rounds, those MiGs didn't dare to fly in front of her in fear of being shot down by a careless pilot. Not immature careless, but merciless careless. It was a massive Sea Flanker, capable of flying for hours on end, an excellent dogfighting aircraft. A MiG-28 dashed before her, and the pilot inside the Flanker hissed like a cat. \"Watch it,\" She hissed, bitter cold like the water below them, forcing the pilot to come back around as she teasingly switched to her air to air missiles. Coming out into the upper atmosphere, the canopy was dark blood red, and the lighter red orange camouflage patterns shone like the colour of a blood moon. The moonlight brought out far more colours. The avionics were improved as well as translated into English. The pilot didn't exactly bother to learn the rather difficult yet expressive Slavic tongue. English had very little expression in it, and that is what she loved for it made her cold whenever she spoke. \"Let us head home,\" The female pilot said, being the first to bank around. They all understood her turning away from the now closer ocean as they went inland, following her tightly on her back angled wings. Most Russian aircraft favoured those wing sweeps, it made them much more agile therefore deadly. They flew towards a Russian naval air base, landing with the young pilot coming in last. Her landing was delicate, like this jet was something to be treated with specialty. The canopy opened up, and stepping out had been one demonic pilot. It took her awhile before she got back into the swing of things. She'd taken a long break, the pilot relished in the rest she had gotten and the pampering that was given by the communist nation. Spitfire turn to the Russians who saluted her, then stared back up at the moonlit sky that now slowly cleared. \"Amazing how they have yet to see the adversary in their sights,\" She chuckled a little. \"He really is foolish isn't he?\" One of the pilots asked, amused. \"Who knew that Viper would have followed me like that,\" Spitfire agreed, stepping down from the Sea Flanker to accompany her friend, a MiG-29A Fulcrum pilot.[Chapter 3] Spitfire, the World's Deadliest Mercenary? Spitfire, the Future of the Mercenary World? All headlines had something similar to it, amazing how he hadn't heard of the young mercenary before. She was there, pictures of her standing by the nose of the jet as it's flames shone in the light. One image where she stood under the snow covered treetops, her G suit was different though, highly advanced it seemed and the chest piece centre glimmered blue. In a few videos he watched, Spitfire had a strange heavy breathing in her chest. She winced occasionally. He was rather intrigued by this fighter pilot, reading up on her gave him a whole new approach to the world of a young fighter pilots, how there were pictures taken by family in her cadet uniform, eagle perched on her shoulder as they both stared at the camera quizzically. She was pretty for her age, no make up ever accompanied her looks at all, but she was part German, what was he to expect? There was one where she stared back at the camera, grey green eyes glistening under the sunlight, she looked just as majestic as the eagle that flared out her wings, screeching in the photo to the sky. It was a deep, dark blue. Does the colour of the sky mean anything...rather special to you? It does to me, very much, who wanted to live in a world where the sky was some flashy hot pink or some atomic, post apocalyptic orange? When I close my eyes, the sky in my dreams is either a bright sky blue or a deep dark blue like the ocean's deathly, watery depths. I rest my hand under my SU-33's snout, I treated her a lot like family, I felt like I was the machine, that I'd bonded with her over our few months together; my big girl was everything to me. She was a sleek dart like fighter that took down even the greatest of Tomcat pilots, I didn't feel remorse obviously. Humans were a naturally violent species, just like the animals around us, we were truly like them whether we wanted to admit it or not. Things like PTSD in my mind were just stress responses, it made us remember what things we stayed away from although it was traumatizing to re-witness again and again. As a German I felt some weird superiority complex over many people, especially Slavic, somedays I'd laugh at them they were rather foolish in my mind. I pull my hand away from the jet's cool nose, rubbing my index and thumb together like as if I were expecting some reaction to it, I wasn't really. No pyrokinesis for me at all, it wasn't even possible for fire to combust in this temperature. I hear the warning alarms blare, it's time to take off again. I get into my jet, lowering the canopy and strapping myself in, activating the G suit I wore that allowed for me to actually breathe properly. It was hard to, but the Russians built a specialized flight suit that allowed for better air combat maneuvering, and for me to take on more G force than a normal pilot could, plus for me to actually breathe and my heart not skip beats like it often did. It was common in my family though, and God did I secretly hate them for it, but with this G suit, I felt normal. I'm in the air in under two minutes, flying towards the fleet of Tomcats that threaten this naval air base's extinction, I would easily take them down but I let my Soviet friends have their fun too. I bank around sharply, chasing one of the Tomcats and launching a missile at him, but the bastard releases chaffs, making my attack useless. I switch to guns, firing it at the jet, and it starts to smoke from the wings. I feel a sense of accomplishment as I take him out of the sky, rocking my jet from side to side, following another as it flies for the air base, and I fire it out of the sky, watching it splash into the freezing depths below. Russia wasn't the warmest country. I move around to engage with any other possible aerial vehicles, then I see their B-1 bombers approaching the airspace, it was easier to take them out with my S-13 rockets since this thing could barely outmaneuver me without killing almost everyone in the cockpit. I fire my rockets at the black bomber, shredding its wings to make it unable to fly. I feel guilty as I see it fall to the side, slowly going wing first into the cold ocean, but happy at the same time. I look forward, getting a lock on a rather stubborn Tomcat that tried hightailing it back to his carrier. I apply my afterburners, rushing towards the silver glistening aircraft as it tried to bank around before almost stopping midair-he knew he would never be able to fight back against me. I launch a heatseeking missile at him, the jet exploded into a flaming fireball, metal pieces scattering across the icy blue sky. I laugh, \"Tomcat down!\" I say. A mercenary's job was never pretty, let me tell you that. It was full of betrayal often, where your own kind would backstab you because pay was higher in another air force. The dogfight was so peaceful and for a moment I felt like retreating but then again I remembered where my allegiance was lying currently, the Russians needed and wanted my help so I gleefully gave that away in exchange for aircraft maintenance and repairs that I couldn't do on my own. Along the way I wasn't afraid to admit that I, as a sixteen year old may have had a small crush on one of their lowest officers. Ironically that meant he was young too. Stereotypical Soviet blonde hair and blue eyed, he was the standard height for a fighter pilot and his aircraft was the Fulcrum. I often saw him walking around the base or discreetly watching me; he always had an interest in the mercenary business. After the fight that lasted only a few more minutes we all go to land, I am the last, rounding up the seemingly lost pilots. The one in front of me is him, I have no idea how to pronounce his name at all but I'll grow to figure him out, I just like to call him \"Angel\". I'm lying on my Flanker's wing when he walks up and tries to climb up and join me, his English isn't too good but he tried at least. Probably because he was among a mercenary, most of us were all required to at least speak it or some form of English, even write in it. \"Spitfire,\" He says, nodding at me. \"Privijet,\" I say, a casual Hello in Russian since I can barely remember the formal way of saying it to which he says it and laughs at my confused expression. He sits by me, taking a bit of time to remember the words correctly and playfully pushes me a little once I sat up with my legs crossed over the other. \"You will remember soon.\" \"You will remember IT soon,\" I correct him. He gives me that look, and I laugh a little. It's a look of teasing sadness, he's mocking that of a puppy and I find that weirdly adorable. Let me tell you, people in the military weren't cold hearted people a lot actually were fricken hilarious. \"You are no fair,\" He tells me, playfully though. I know he's uncomfortable by the fact that English can't express very much at all. \"I'm perfectly fair,\" I tell him. \"No,\" He shakes his head. \"Da,\" I say. \"Nyet.\" He says. It goes on like this for a few minutes before we hear some weird cooing and aweing from his wingmen below us, staring up at the two of us. I glare down at them, and they scurry away, chuckling. \"So what did you find?\" Iceman stares up from the computer, having been fully engrossed in the topic of mercenaries and The Devil of the Skies herself, it was hard to even imagine what she'd seen. He wondered how long Slider had been there for, watching his wingman with a smile. The room was dark, very dark. Night had hit and he hadn't even realized it. He stared at the computer's internal clock, in small white littering it wrote 22:30 , it had been ten thirty at night. \"The commander was right-this pilot is scary skilled, she could shoot him out of the sky without having to spare another missile,\" Iceman explained in a shocked voice. \"NATO calls her 'Devil in the Sky' because of her air combat maneuvering-how can a pilot be that good?\" \"Ever heard of ADHD?\" Slider asked. \"Yeah, neuordevelopmental disorder, part of the brain stops grow-\" Slider shut him up. \"She has it, if it's harnessed properly it gives one a survival mentality, that means you can kill almost anyone, Kaz,\" Slider said. \"You know I hate that nickname,\" Iceman said. \"That's the only way to get you to damn listen,\" Slider told him, walking over to the lights to switch them on then lean over to see the computer screen. \"It's not much, just news coverage reports of her. Sightings. The Demon, all of her nicknames. They're scary, Mitchell had to see her once.\" Iceman switched topics. \"And someday we will too,\" Slider was barely the best at making his friend feel better. \"That's why we're training here.\" \"We will be taught how to fly against her?\" The naval officer asked. His friend hung his head at his Slavic friend's stubbornness. Kazansky was too stubborn for his own good, that ego and pride would get him killed by the younger pilot. That always swam in his head, seeing his friend's skull cracked as bullets shot from the Sea Flanker had embedded into his head, blood pooling around the controls. Slider didn't want to see that outcome, it would be terrible and terrifying to witness. He looks out the window where the sky is dark blue with cloud formations and little crackles of light-a storm was coming; metaphorically and literally.

This was it, this was the moment he had been waiting for! If he completed this assignment, he was an official agent, no longer a Spy Kid. The Director projected up an image of a girl who looked like she was about 19 and looked like she could easily murder someone before breakfast and not miss a second in her daily routine. \"This is Lila Reynolds, one of her many alibis. She is a freelance spy, who completes missions for money, usually for the highest bidder.\" Gary felt disgusted at her lack of loyalty to anyone other than herself. \"She recently infiltrated the OSS and stole very valuable information to us. We have sent a few other spies before you after her, with no success. The last one she sent back to us barely alive. I understand that is quite a dangerous mission, but I have no one else I can ask.\" The Director said, and Gary swore that he would destroy this Lila Reynolds and everything she held dear. \"I'll do it.

Lila swore fiercely when she found the tracker on her car. She put it down on the asphalt and said \"later, bitches\", knowing the bastards on the other side of the tracker could hear her and stepped on it hard with her high heeled boot. She leaned against her car and sighed, raking a hand through her black curly hair. Infiltrating the OSS had been incredibly easy, after all, her parents had been members. When they had died on a mission though, the OSS had abandoned her, their best Spy Kid. She had been surviving ever since that day, using the very skills they had given her. The past months though, they had sent spy after spy after her. Each one seemed to be less trained than the last one, it was almost pathetic how easily she beat them. One of her contacts texted her and she opened her disposable phone, rolling her eyes at the amount they were offering her. \"Sweeten the deal, or you won't get anything.\" She texted back and sent it back, rolling her eyes again.

Another successful mission. Tell mister Giggles he is not the only prodigy in the family\" \"Thanks Chris.\" Gerti grinned at her new secretary/office manager. \"I'll be sure to rub it in his face. But enough about yesterday's mission, what about today? I heard something serious came up.\" \"It is serious.\" Gerti turned to see her father standing at the door to the briefing room. \"And this couldn't have come at a worse time.\" A distraught look on his face. \"What is it?\" Gerti inquired. She could only think of a few incidents that had caused such a look of worry on her dad's face. Mr. Giggles shoulders slumped and he turned to Chris. \"Mr. Stallings, could you please leave us.\" Gerti could hear the urgency in his voice and all her doubts dissipated. The situation must be grave if her father, a man usually comfortable speaking in front of anyone, was telling people to clear the room. After Chris left Mr. Giggles continued. \"I don't have time to explain too much but someone stole a dangerous device from the OSS Deep Vault.\" Deep Vault huh. I wasn't aware the OSS even had a vault. \"It's a prototype EMP device that was still undergoing testing. Someone tripped the silent alarm last night and when we opened the vault the device was gone. The cameras were damaged. There are no fingerprints or significant evidence that someone even entered the vault.\" \"Wait, wait, wait, you least me at Deep Vault. What is that? Why do we have one? What else is stored down there?\" Mr. Giggles motioned with his hand for silence. \"I'm getting to that.\" He said matter-of-factly. \"But I'm trusting you with this information, so I need you to listen not talk.\" Gerti grunted but nodded in agreement. \"Over the past few years the OSS has been a completely independent facility. The local government has never approved of this due to our covert operations around the globe. This is especially true in the case of the military. For years were able to stay independent until 3 years ago when our budget fell into the red…\" Gerti fidgeted in impatience Gosh, briefings are always full of boring jargon. Please hurry up with point \"When our budget tanked a few our adult representatives went to city hall to negotiate for funding.\" You mean beg Gerti thought as she rolled her eyes. Adults are always try to change things \"After a long debate we finally came to an agreement. The OSS would receive government funding if we agreed to become a public entity and build a storage facility for most of the military's experimental devices.\" And now we lost one. Gerti was starting to get the picture. \"And now we lost one.\" Mr. Giggles continued. \"Now normally this wouldn't be a problem if not for the government's routine monthly inspection of the vault… which is in 2 weeks\" \"Which means we have two weeks to get it back.\" Gerti blurted out. \"Plenty of time.\" Mr. Giggles sighed. \"Normally you would be right, but with most of our agents out on other missions and the remaining ones preparing for this year's graduation ceremony.\" He paused for emphasis. \"Your brother's graduating ceremony.\" Gerti turned to the flyer on the wall behind her. These flyers were posted all throughout the building, but she somehow forgot about it. She always loved the food and games and dancing to the hottest pop music but this time it was special. He brother, and his class would be graduating from the OSS Spy Kids Division to pursue is career on a higher level. \"We need to get this case finished before the event starts and the military inspectors come.\" Mr. Giggles said. He moved closer and put a hand on her shoulder. \"I want you to lead this operation.\" Gerti turned around in awe. \"Really?!\" she exclaimed. \"It's about time!\" She paused in realization \"Wait, but why not Gary?\" She looked at her father intently \"We are usually paired together on missions.\" \"Gary is not here.\" Her father answered. \"He and his partner are off on another mission.\" With who?! How dare he not tell me! How dare you not tell me! Gerti's mind raced. What is going on around here! \"He's paired with Carmen Cortez.\" Suddenly it all made sense. Carmen was her brother's girlfriend. Even though they had never officially broken the news everyone knew there were an item. Gerti also knew that Gary was dying for a solo mission with her, so they could have some unsupervised alone time. Well looks like you finally convinced mom and dad huh. Gerti shook here head in disbelief and admiration. Wonder how you guys convinced the Cortezes She looked up at her dad. \"Does this mean I get to run this mission alone?!\" She exclaimed. \"Your finally trusting me with something for once! Oh my gosh th-\" \"My goodness no!\" He dad cut her off. \"You'll most definitely have backup. The only thing I;t trusting you with is to find a partner and report to the debriefing room by oh-five-hundred. I have a meeting in the next hour but I will be there to see you off. Good luck\" And with that Mr. Giggles hustled out of her office. Crud. Gerti pouted. I though Dad was loosening up a little.

I was just watching Spy Kids 3 again, and I realized that you know next to nothing about Demetra, and I feel like she'd be kind of lost in the data once Game Over was shut down, so I thought I'd do a Fic where she came back. I already have some kind of idea about where I'd wanna go with this. I just want to say now, sorry if I get anything wrong about anything, I'm not exactly an expert when it comes to computers and game coding and all that fun stuff. The doors closed just as the massive robot reached out a hand. I sighed in relief. Juni was safe. And everyone else, too. The robot looked at me, clearly offended. I shook my head in silence, and walked away. I walked through the levels, watching as kid after kid ran played through, only to be beaten at level 4 or earlier. Juni was the only one who made it, the only one who beat the game. If it wasn't for him, the door to level 5 would still be closed. The thought made me smile; even a program by the game maker couldn't stop him, the all-so-powerful creator. But my smile faded as I sat on the edge of a wall overlooking the Mega Race. If it wasn't for me , the level wouldn't be so difficult, and Juni wouldn't have been the only one to reach it. I left the race and walked through more of the world, the urge to obey my programming tugging at me. If I didn't move around, I was sure I would corrupt myself fighting it. I didn't stop until I reached an area outside the generated maps. It was a seemingly endless field of grass, with a single tree in the middle of it. It was perpetually raining, the \"water\" going right through me. It was supposed to be part of level 4, but when the maker saw my deceiving image give way because of the rain, he decided to push it underneath the game map, replacing it with a long, narrow bridge made of rock. But I found a way to get there, knowing the exact place to fall through and re-spawning when I wanted to leave. I could even see the game world above me, everything so high up it looked like an upside down map. It was peaceful without other players, my special place. I must have sat there against the tree for a while, because all of a sudden I looked up to see everything going dark. I looked up; the players were all disappearing, the words \"Connection Lost\" showing above their heads. I watched as the game world crumbled around me, but I didn't move. I let it get dark, until only a chunk of the ground I sat on remained, the rain stopping. \"This is for the best,\" I whispered. Somewhere, deep down inside myself, I slept. It was warm, and dark, and safe. It was a place where I didn't have to talk, didn't have to run, didn't have to think, didn't have to feel. Sometimes, I could feel my memories pulling at me, the little voice telling me to wake up, to open my eyes and fight. But I pushed it down, falling deeper into the purplish haze that was my dream, comfortable nothingness. I don't know how long it'd been, or how long I'd slept, but I felt something. No, that was wrong, I didn't feel anything. I heard something. It was a voice, calling to me from the edge of the darkness, begging me to wake up. I turned away from it, wanting to plug whatever I had instead of ears and go back to sleep, but it wouldn't let up. It grew in size and volume, moving towards me slowly but surely. At first I was irritated, then annoyed, and then finally angry; enough to turn towards it and shout, or whatever the communication I could make with it was called. What do you want? I asked it. I want you to come back, it answered. Why? We need you. As it spoke, I started to realize that I was changing. I was no longer just 1's and 0's on a screen, I was taking a shape. No! I wanted it to stop, wanted to go back to my dreamless sleep, where I couldn't hurt anyone anymore. You'll be fine. I promise. It sounded so confident, so sure, that I almost started to believe it. But a small voice in my codes responded, my curiosity waking up. I was waking up. I could hear the smile in the voice, as my shape and form completed. See you in the game, Demetra.

Gary!\" 15 year old Carmen Cortez shouted as the holographic screen connected the transmission. She sat in her bedroom in the Cortez house. Her own bedroom- Juni had finally decided that he wanted to have his own room, which Carmen was thankful for. It was just after Christmas, and Carmen had just received the best present yet. \"What? Carmen what's going on?\" Gary Giggles' face appeared on the screen. He was 15, like Carmen. The two teens had somehow become friends over time. Carmen had had a huge crush on Gary back during Ukata assignment. Back then, the Giggles kids and the Cortez had been on pretty opposite sides. Donnagon Giggles, Gary and Gerti's father, had tried to steal the Trasmooker device and take over the world. But, Gerti had changed and helped the Cortez. Gary had been stripped of his level 1 standing and was fired. However the OSS had had a vote and Gary was allowed to continue training. He and Carmen were in most of the same classes and were always fighting for top spot. Somewhere between the lines, the two had become friends. Carmen still had a crush on Gary, something that she would never tell anyone. \"I just received an assignment!\" She smiled. \"No way!\" Gary smiled right back at her. \"I'm leaving tonight,\" Gary's smiled dropped. \"Tonight?\" He questioned. \"Yeah,\" She looked down. \"I just wanted to let you know.\" \"How long are you going to be gone?\" \"Not too long,\" she forced a smile, \"I mean how hard can it be to beat a stupid video game?\" \"That's what your mission is?\" he raised an eyebrow. \"Can you…come here?\" Carmen sighed. \"I'll explain everything.\" \"Already on my way,\" He smiled and powered off the transmission. Carmen leaned back in her seat and sighed. She was ecstatic for her mission, but she was also very nervous. She was doing this mission alone. It was her first mission alone. She wanted her brother, Juni to come along but he wasn't answering his phone. She hadn't seen him since Christmas, which was a week ago. That was normal amongst a family of spies, but Juni had quit the OSS. So, Carmen was going on this mission alone. It was a new sort of mission, the first of its kind. She was one of the highest ranking agents in the OSS Jr., so she had received the mission. Gary, the other highest ranking agent had already been assigned to another mission, he was set to leave in a week. Knock Knock Knock A tapping on her balcony window snapped Carmen out of her trance. Gary was standing on her balcony. Carmen ran to the balcony, opened the door and threw herself into Gary. \"Whoa, Cortez\" Gary put his arms around her. She pulled away from him smiling, \"Gary!\" \"So tell me,\" He said sitting down on the stone balcony, \"What's the deal with the video game?\" Carmen sat beside him, \"It's weird. They're trying something that's never been done before. They're physically going to put me into the video game.\" \"Why? What video game?\" \"Umm Game Over?\" She said thoughtfully, \"Does that game ring a bell?\" Gary's eyes widened, \"That game was only announced a week ago, it's already the highest pre-ordered game. It's supposed to be released in 6 months.\" \"Well it's my mission to make sure it doesn't get released.\" She said. \"Why? What's wrong with it?\" \"Everything,\" Carmen explained. \"The game was invented by the Toymaker.\" \"He's back?\" Gary leaned towards her. \"He never was gone!\" \"How are you going to stop him?\" Carmen lay back, \"I have to beat the game, shut it down from the inside and get out…alone.\" Gary lay back beside her, \"You know I would-\" \"I know,\" she said cutting him off. \"I just wish Juni-\" \"I know.\" Gary said, \"He'll come to his senses some day.\" \"I just wish it was sooner,\" Carmen sighed The two teens sat in silence. Both thinking about the other, but not wanting to say anything. \"What time do you have to go in?\" Gary asked, breaking the silence. \"Midnight,\" She said. \"Do you want me to-?\" Gary started. \"Yeah,\" Carmen finished. Gary smiled softly and Carmen smiled back. The two teens stayed out on the balcony together until it was time for Carmen to go to the OSS. They kicked their shoes into gear and flew side-by-side right to the front doors. Right before Carmen walked through the doors; Gary grabbed her hand and pulled her back. There was something he needed to do. Carmen was about to go on an extremely dangerous mission, one that she may not even return from. She turned around to face him. \"Carmen,\" \"Gary,\" They stared at each other. Both wanting to tell the other how they felt, but not wanting to at the same time. \"Um,\" Gary cleared his throat, \"See you soon?\" Carmen blinked and cleared her head, \"Um yeah. Soon.\" The teens smiled awkwardly at the other and Gary dropped Carmen's hand. \"Good luck.\" \"Thanks,\" She smiled, \"Uh you too.\" \"Thank you,\" He said quickly. With another shared awkward smile. Carmen turned back around and started for the door again. It's now or never Giggles! In a moment of pure craziness, Gary reach forward, grabbed Carmen by the arm and spun her around. \"Gary, what are you-\" Carmen never finished. Gary pulled her forward and crashed his lips over hers. Carmen was frozen for a second, her eyes wide, clearly shocked. A second later though, she closed her eyes and melted into him. Carmen threw her arms around his neck as Gary dropped her arm and wrapped his arms around her waist, pulling her as close as possible. Neither of them knew how long they stood there, but apparently it was too long. \"Agent Cortez? Are you out here?\" Donnagon Giggles called out as he stepped outside. Carmen and Gary broke apart with a start. Gary put a finger to his lips, signaling for Carmen to be silent. Donnagon was looking the other way, so he didn't see the two teens kissing. Gary leaned in close to her ear, \"You can do this.\" Carmen let out a shuddering breath and nodded, \"Good luck on your mission.\" \"You too,\" He whispered, and then pushed her out of the shadow. \"Agent Cortez,\" Donnagon said, noticing her for the first time. \"There you are! We need to get you inside the game now. The more time you have the better.\" He opened the door and ushered her inside. Right before Carmen walked inside, she threw one last glance over her shoulder. Her eyes met another pair in the darkness and she smiled. Soon, She thought. Gary watched as Carmen was led into the building. She looked back at him and their eyes met. The two teens shared a smile before the doors closed behind her and Gary was left alone outside. Soon, He thought, soon. . ","Summary":" \"Gary!

Back at the Cortez House Juni was still holding his sister by the neck. Carmine begs \"Please Juni let go of me\"? Juni then notices what he had been doing. So he let's go of his sister and starts to cry. Carmine goes over to her brother for comfort. They just look at one another for a few minutes. Then all of a sudden Carmine kisses Juni on the lips. Juni just goes with it. He doesn't see that the phone is ringing. Carmine says to her brother \"I want to suck your dick right now\". Before Juni could say anything his sister had already pulled down his pants. Carmine said \"God Juni your not warring any boxers\"? Juni says \"Well I was looking for one but could find any\". Carmine just looked at Juni and said nothing. She then started to suck her brother's dick. All that Juni said \"Oh god Carmine\". Then Carmine pulled Juni's pants down then went for his shirt. But Juni says \"Wait Carmine I don't think we should be doing this\"? Carmine roles her eyes which Juni knows that she's angry. Carmine said \"Don't worry about it no one is going to know as long as you don't tell mom and dad\". Juni promises that he won't tell anyone. Carmine goes to grab a condom and puts it on her brother. Carmine then places herself on to Juni. Carmine says out loud \"Oh fuck yes Juni fuck me\"! Juni couldn't really say anything else to his sister. There was a few seconds where Juni thought that his sister was going to kiss him. But she didn't kiss him at all. Carmine than says \"UHHHHH YES JUNI FUCK YOUR SISTER\"! Then Carmine leaned on her brother and he didn't seemed to care what she was doing. Then Carmine gets up off of Juni. He says \"Where are you going\"? Carmine said \"I just had to rest for a few minutes. But now I'm ready for more\". Carmine gets back on but faces the other way. Carmine says \"UHHHHH yes Juni fuck your older sister\"! Juni says \"Oh god Carmine, oh fuck yes\"! Carmine then leans back and puts her arm around her brother. Carmine says \"Uh Ah Ahhhh\"! Juni grabs his sisters boobs and squeezes them. They just have a moment of looking at one and other. But they almost end up kissing each other but didn't. Juni says to his sister \"Carmine I need to go do something\". Carmine says \"Oh alright just be fast\". Carmine gets off of Juni and lays in bed. A minute or so Juni comes back to his room. But this time Carmine is on her hands and knees. Juni says \"So know you want me to do that\". Carmine says \"Yes Juni I wanted you to fuck me from behind\". So Juni puts his dick into Carmine's ass. Carmine yells really loudly. For some known reason Carmine and Juni feel to their side. Carmine says loudly \"Fuck Juni Fuck your sister\"! Juni just fucked her. He then felt like he was going to cum. Carmine looked back at her brother. She knew he had to do something. Juni said \"Uh, Carmine I have to\"? Carmine interrupts to say \"Yes Juni I know you have to cum. You may cum on me\". The two get off the bed and Carmine goes to her knees as her brother stands over her. As Juni starts to jerk off he says \"Oh god Carmine oh yes\"! Carmine just stood there in wait for Juni to cum. All of a sudden Juni comes over Carmine. Carmine just looks at Juni. Carmine says \"Well that was great. Know Juni you want tell anyone about this, right\". Juni says to his sister \"Yes Carmine I promise not to tell anyone about this\". Back Downstairs Juni wakes up downstairs on the coach. He couldn't believe if that was a dream or really. Juni looked up to see the TV on to The Big Bang Theory. Juni looks around to see if his sister, but she isn't down here. Juni yells out \"Carmine where are you\"! Carmine says \"I'm in my room I'm about to come down to watch a movie with you\". Juni sees his sister come down the stairs in full clothes. Carmine looks at Juni \"Is there something wrong\". Juni just started at Carmine for a few minutes. Carmine says as she goes to sit down \"What Juni what are you looking at\". Juni says to his sister \"I was just wondering, did we have sex and where you naked in your room\". Carmine took a long paws while looking at her brother. Carmine says is a worried voice \"Uh no we didn't fuck and no I was looking for a movie this whole time\". Juni was relieved that they didn't fuck. So the two movies where The Dark Knight Rises or Captain America: The Winter. The two decided on Captain America: The Winter Solider. As the watch the movie Carmine, she has a mysterious look.

Well better get up before Mom takes a chainsaw to the door again.\" Slowly the girl started getting ready by combing out her soft and wavy waves of caramel hair and putting it up in a sloppy half-hearted ponytail. Next she brushed her perfectly straight teeth that had a pair of large black braces, something had to make them straight and it sure wasn't gravity. Then the girl just throw on a pair of worn gray jeans and a howdy with the word 'Giggles' on the back in white letters. Her golden hazel eyes still foggy with sleep. \"Well first rule of being a new freak in a school is making sure you have the freaky part of you at all times.\" The girl opened a tank and pulled out a spider the size of her hand \"Deadly Nanette super rare and near extinct, highly poison to human but as loyal as any dog to its owner. Isn't that right Chip.\" The spider in response crawled up the back of her howdy to sit for the day. Only to come out when called and no sooner. \"Junior high here I come.\" ~~~## \"I'm not kidding Gary, Dynny has a serious problems. She's skipping school, she's smart but doesn't put any effort into things, she has authority issues, not much self-confidence, kids who bullies her always end up with a black eye, and she in antisocial with everyone her age.\" Carmen stressed to her husband Gary as she made 'breakfast' and prepared everyone's 'lunch' for the day. \"I'm here so if you're talking about me and don't want me to know about it stop talking about it.\" Dynny sang as she came to sit at the island in the kitchen with her father as he read the newspaper and drank his coffee. \"So what's on the schedule for today day?\" \"Your mother and I are going to go get some film of a local reserve not that far from here with the Monic's and then we'll be having dinner. So after school you and Hunter will be coming here and we should be back around four. Okay?\" Gary explained. \"Does Hunter HAVE to come over here?\" The girl whined. \"Yes, besides it would be wise for you two to become friends seeing how often we move and the fact our two families travel/work together.\" Carmen reminded grabbing two bowls and pouring a white liquid into both. The Liquid had chunks in it and smelled rotten it was also slowly bubbling. \"Honey what are you doing?\" \"Cooking.\" \"I think that's offensive to the term cooking.\" Dynny mumbled silently. \"I think the substance has to be edible to be considered cooked.\" Gary muttered \"What was that?\" The former Cortez asked innocently. Gary cleared his throat quickly. \"I said Dynny's running late and it's my turn to take her, so we'll just get something on the way.\" \"Ya first day don't want to be late.\" Both people ran out of the door before they could be stopped. \"Love you Carmen.\" \"By Mom, Love you.\" \"Wait!\" The care quickly speed away. \"You forgot you lunches...\" \"You know Dyn, your moms worried about you again. You haven't made any friends in a while.\" Gary started as he drove down the crowded streets to the local Junior High. \"Why is that?\" \"What the point in making friends if soon you'll just have to move again. Dad this is my seventh school in the last two years. I understand you have to travel for the Blog you and Mom run, but it's hard always being the new kid all the time.\" The retired agent sighed, he wasn't so much as moving to do the blog as to stay off the radar of all organizations. Still he had left the O.S.S to give his daughter a life and what was that worth if she wasn't even happy. As Gary parked the car he turned to his daughter with on of his signature smiles and gave one of his iconic laughs. \"Here's a deal this is the last move for at least a year, but try to at least make some friends. Promise?\" \"Promise.\" The girl smiled hugging her father before jumping out of the car to school. \"Love you dad.\" \"Love you to and be safe.\" ","Summary":" Spy Kids: The family business Prologue: Enter the Giggles \"Dynny Giggles, hurry up or your going t"},{"Movie":"Spy Kids","Title":"Spying on my HOUSE","Author":"SuppahBarkada12","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9729839","Passage":"[Chapter 1] BELIEVE IN WHO YOU ARE,CAUSE YOUR perfect...

An array of thoughts swam in his mind as he idley sunk his fingers into the beige clay he held in the palm of his left hand. He stared down at the mesh before him. What used to be a refined, smooth sculpture of his face, was now a crude, lumpy blob before him. He had absentmindedly duplicated how he himself felt on the inside; a useless glob. He wasn't supposed to feel this way. He was supposed to be happy. He was a genius. He invented great things! Like...the Thumb-Thumbs. Although, they were clumsy and uncoordinated...but that was besides the point. He'd made great things before. Hadn't he? What about his fooglies? I mean, sure they were just mutated OSS agents, but being able to take people as dull and boring as them and turn them into fascinating works of art had to count for something. Right? Or maybe he was just a useless glob. A man with too much borrowed government money that he'd wasted on meaningless projects, and broken dreams. He had no idea how he'd get out of this slump.

She just didn't feel good. Sad and lonely. She had no reason to, she knew. After all, she was one of the most successful spies in history, and she was only 16 years old. She had her own apartment, millions of dollars in the bank, and gadgets the rest of the world wouldn't see for years. But something was missing. Ever since her parents had been lost on a mission, everything had been different. Carmen thought back to the day when she first got the call. \"Carmen, listen to me.\" \"Uncle Felix! How are you?\" \"I'm not your uncle. Carmen, I have some bad news.\" \"What? Did something happen to Gary and Gerti or something?\" \"I'm so so sorry.\" Then he hung up. Carmen felt it deep down, a stab to the heart. Something had happened to her parents. She had only 13 when it happened. 3 years later, they were still MIA. Not confirmed dead, but what else could have happened? Juni had never been the same after he got the news. He broke off from the OSS immediately, blaming them for his loss. A few months later, he took off. Carmen hadn't heard from him in over a year. Gerti was constantly on missions, another top agent. She never had time for anyone. Carmen didn't want to be like that, but she often worried she was. She missed Gerti a lot. And Gary? He disappeared around the same time as Juni. She still had a picture of him. Not like the giant collection she used to have, but still… She missed him, and thought about it all the time. In fact, that was probably why none of her other relationships had worked out. She couldn't kiss a guy without thinking about him. But now was not the time to think about Gary. After all, there was the spy rule: trust no one. She couldn't afford it. She heard a buzz coming from the living room, and ran in. Just as she thought, the OSS was calling. She pressed accept. \"Carmen, we have a new mission for you. You know how recently, new inventions have been disappearing from headquarters?\" \"Yeah. What about it?\" \"We caught the person on camera.\" \"Well then, who is it?\" \"We don't know. But we do know who they are working for. The Ninyas. We need you to go on a stakeout, find the headquarters, and take out this ninya.\" A picture appeared on the screen. Carmen memorized it instantly. \"Got it. I'll be there tonight.\" She ended the call and pulled up the picture. Those eyes. Where had she seen them before?

All rights go to their respective owners! This is for recreational purposes! I only own the OCs in the story! Enjoy! Read and Review!* (This takes place during the Young Guns Movie. I've only added in a couple of new characters.) \"What's the plan?\" asked Kelsey. \"Evelynn said that we have to help with the period play,\" said Ann. \"Really?\" asked Kelsey dropping her notebook on the table. \"I don't want to help with that. Can't she strong arm someone else to do it? Doesn't she have enough lackeys to do it without pulling in us?\" Ann laughed. \"Surprisingly, or not so, her friends are all on \"holiday\" with their families that weekend according to her. So we're stuck doing it.\" \"Can't we go on holiday? I'm sure I can think of somewhere we can go,\" said Kelsey. Ann shook her head. \"She's your cousin. I should be the one complaining.\" \"Yeah, but I've known her longer. I'm allowed to complain about her,\" laughed Kelsey. \"Come on, might as well get down to the dress shop. If we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it right!\" Ann laughed as she grabbed her coat and followed her roommate out the door. \"OOO! I like this one!\" said Kelsey running through the dress shop looking at different dresses. Ann shook her head as she made her way to the counter. The shop attendant was laughing at Kelsey when Ann arrived. \"Can I help you?\" she asked. \"We're doing the period play,\" said Ann. \"KELSEY! Jesus…\" Kelsey stopped mid run and smiled at both women before she started to seriously peruse the dresses. The attendant nodded her head. \"Then you two must be Ann Wheeler and Kelsey Dodge,\" said the attendant. Ann nodded her head. \"Eve called in yesterday saying you would be stopping by. I've got a few pulled in the back for y'all to look at,\" said the attendant. \"Kels!\" shouted Ann. \"This way.\" Kelsey put a 1920s dress back on the rack and followed her friend through the \"Employees Only\" door. They were led into a small room that had two racks of dresses. Ann smiled as she looked over them. \"Just holler if you need anything,\" said the attendant. \"My name is Bridgett.\" Ann and Kelsey nodded as they started for the dresses. \"Which one is ours?\" asked Kelsey looking at one of the racks. \"We get to pick,\" said Ann. \"Sweet,\" said Kelsey pulling a dress off to look at it better. \"I love this dress,\" said Kelsey spinning around. The dress she was wearing was a maroon afternoon dress. She had on a pair of black side button boots. She was in the process of pulling her hair back into a bunch of bobby pins. Ann chuckled as she walked out of her dressing room. She was in a green afternoon gown. \"Did you..,\" said the attendant walking into the room. \"I guess you found everything okay.\" \"Yes,\" said Kelsey as she spun around in the dress again. Ann rolled her eyes as she pulled her hair into an up do. \"How much do we owe you?\" \"Eve already covered everything. I can have my guys bring the dresses by the rehearsal studio later today,\" said Bridgett. \"What?\" said Ann looking at the woman through the mirror. \"Eve bought them all,\" said Bridgett. \"It cost a pretty penny, too, but apparently she wants several costume changes throughout the day.\" \"Really?\" said Kelsey looking at Ann. \"this is what you got me into?\" \"She's your cousin,\" said Ann. \"Thank you. I will let Evelynn know when we see her later today.\" Bridgett nodded and walked out of the room. Kelsey looked at herself in the full length mirror while two women packed the dresses into trunks. \"As much as I don't like you right now,\" she said. \"I still like this dress. \"Come on,\" said Ann. \"We need to hurry if we are going to make the rehearsal meeting.\" Kelsey sighed dramatically as she followed her friend out of the shop. Kelsey's blonde hair blew around as they walked down the street. Her five foot five frame was that of an athlete. She had been on the track team when she was in high school. She had a tiny waist before she put the dress on and the dress made it look like she didn't have one to begin with. The only problem she had found with the dress was that her chest didn't fit quite right in it. She had to have one of the store attendants help her into it and button it up for her. Otherwise she'd never have gotten into the dress at all. Ann was a few paces ahead of her. Her dark hair had been pulled back into a similar style as Kelsey's. Ann stood five foot seven inches, and with her boots it put her at five foot nine. She, too, had an athletic body. But unlike Kelsey she didn't have to work for hers. Hers had come naturally. She was part Native American. She shared her mother's tan skin and dark hair, but she was completely her father's daughter. Her mother had left them when she was still little and she only knows what she looks like from pictures. She'd found out later that she was Navajo after talking to a few people in her neighborhood. They'd seemed to settle in a neighborhood that was populated mostly by Navajo Indians. \"Slow down,\" said Kelsey as she tried to catch up with her friend. \"I can barely breathe in this dress.\" \"Then why did you pick that one instead of one that your boobs could fit into?\" asked Ann stopping. \"Hush,\" said Kelsey. \"That dress makes you look even darker than you already are. Damn, I wish I could get as tan as you.\" Ann rolled her eyes. Kelsey had been trying to tan since they'd first met, but because Kelsey's mother had red hair, she'd not able to hold a tan long and she usually burns first. She's all but given up on it. \"Come on. We're almost there,\" said Ann. As they turned the corner a gust of wind blew dirt up into the and into their faces. The both started coughing and trying to wave the dirt from their faces so they could see. Once the dust settled they looked around. Their scenery had changed, dramatically. \"I...uh…,\" started Kelsey. \"I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.\" \"So I'm Toto now?\" asked Ann looking at her friend. \"And what gave that away?\" About that time there was a gunshot. Both girls turned to see a young man run out of a building and down the street. Three men exited the same building only a few moments later. \"Does this look familiar to you?\" asked Kelsey watching the boy dart through the people. \"Only one way to find out,\" said Ann making her way down the street after the young man. A/N: Hope you've enjoyed this chapter...I\"m working on the second one now (12/23/12). Review and let me know what you think! ~Kat[Chapter 2] As the girls neared the cow pen a wagon pulled up to it. There were two men in the buggy. One was an older gentleman and the other was quite younger than the first. Possibly in his early twenties. The young man hiding in the cow pen climbed out and into the buggy. As it started to pull away the young man with the shotgun turned back to see Ann and Kelsey standing there. As he went to smile Kelsey gripped Ann's arm before she fell to the ground. \"John, stop the buggy,\" said Doc as he jumped from the wagon. He tossed the gun to the old man as he made his way to the women. \"Is...Is she okay?\" he asked Ann. \"I…I don't know,\" said Ann fanning Kelsey's face. \"She was fine a minute ago.\" \"Why don't you help the young miss into the wagon, Mr. Scurlock,\" said the old man. \"And then we will attend to her friend at the house, hmm?\" Doc nodded. He picked up Kelsey and laid her on the floor of the wagon. Ann was only a few feet behind him. She'd already had her foot up on the small step when Doc turned to help her. She smiled meekly at him and accepted his hand. The other young man, from the cow pen, moved away from the women as Ann sat down to cradle Kelsey's head in her lap. The ride was a long one and Kelsey still hadn't woken up. As they made their way down a hill a group of people came into view. Ann kept her mouth shut as they neared the house. \"Who are them?\" asked the boy. \"They, William,\" said the older gentleman. \"Who are they. They are the boys of the dregs. The flotsam and jetsam of frontier society, if you will. We've got room in the bunk house, my young man. If you don't want to stay, the Santa Fe runs out of Albuquerque in the morning,\" he said as he pulled the buggy up to the bunk house. \"If you do wish to stay, well, we have just the job for you.\" John stepped down from the buggy and walked to the back end. He held out his hand and helped Ann from the buggy. He grabbed Kelsey and picked her up and made his way towards the main house with Ann in tow. She tried to keep her eyes on his back and not stare at the men who were staring at her. \"Your friend should be just fine,\" said John after he laid Kelsey on the bed. \"She just need to be in, *ahem*, more comfortable clothing.\" Ann blushed at his meaning and nodded her head. A few moments later the man that had been with him in the buggy walked in with a trunk. He set it at the foot of the bed before he quickly walked out. John shut the door behind him as he left. Ann turned to her friend and practically ripped the dress from her. She grabbed the pitcher of water on the stand next to the window and poured it on her face. She would have to remember to change the linens before everyone went to be that night. 'HOLY SHIT THAT'S COLD!\" shouted Kelsey as she came too, sitting up on the bed. \"I think they heard you,\" said Ann. \"Who? What?\" said Kelsey wiping the water from her face. It was then that she got a good look at her surroundings. \"So, we're not in Kansas anymore?\" said Kelsey. \"Pretty much,\" said Ann sitting down next to her. \"Clothes?\" asked Kelsey. Ann nodded to the trunk. Kelsey stood up and started to rummage through the dresses. She finally pulled one out and started to redress. \"Why does a man, who lives with men, have women's clothes?\" asked Kelsey as Ann buttoned the dress. \"I'm sure he had a wife,\" said Ann. \"Or they were his mothers. Who knows, and don't ask him. It's rude.\" Kelsey rolled her eyes as she fixed her hair. \"So what do we do now? We're probably miles from town and hundreds of years from a cell phone.\" \"We're just going to have to stick it out until we can figure out how we got here. Now, I don't know about, but I'm hungry.\" Kelsey nodded and followed Ann from the bedroom. The men had cleared out except for Mr. Tunstall. He was sitting in a rocking chair looking at the fire. \"I see you are a wake,\" he said. \"Feeling better, yes?\" \"Um, yes. I am, thank you,\" said Kelsey. \"Thank you for the dress.\" \"You're very welcome. It belonged to my late wife,\" he said. \"I'm glad to see it is getting some use.\" Kelsey smiled sheepishly at him. \"Now, the boys are out working and I have some things to see to as well,\" he said standing up. \"Please make yourself at home. Supper will be at seven o'clock.\" He nodded to them before he left the building. \"Now what? We've got three hours until dinner,\" said Ann. \"Cook,\" she said nodding to the kitchen. \"I barely know how to cook in our own time, let alone in this one!\" said Ann following her friend into the kitchen. \"I do,\" she said grabbing a few pots. \"Go get some water. Or see if you can get one of them boys to do it for you.\" \"How am I supposed to do that?\" she asked looking at the buckets. \"Bat your eyelashes, shake your chest,\" said Kelsey. \"I don't care, just do it.\" Ann groaned as she grabbed the bucket and made her way out the back door. Kelsey was hallway through chopping vegetables when the door opened again. Ann walked in with a smile on her face but no buckets. Kelsey was about to protest when she saw one of the boys walking in behind her with the buckets. He set them down on the counter next to the vegetables pot before he took his hat off and smiled at the girls before he left. \"Well?\" asked Kelsey. \"I didn't do anything. He just came over and insisted that he do it for me,\" said Ann with a smile. Kelsey rolled her eyes as she went back to working on supper. \"Well, look at those appetites,\" said John as everyone ate. Sitting at the head of the table was John. To his right was Richard (Dick), then Josiah (Doc), then Billy. On John's left were Steve, Charlie, and then Chavez. The girls were sitting at the other end of the table squished in close so they could all fit. At one point Steve went to grab a piece of bread and Charlie smacked his hand. The girls were a little shocked at the manners that some of the men possessed. \"William\" said John. \"Have some more.\" Billy nodded and dished more food on his plate. \"Ladies, this is a very good meal,\" said John. \"Thank you, but you did not have to cook. You are guests in this house.\" Kelsey smiled. She was sitting next to Chavez. \"It was our pleasure. You didn't have to help us, and it gave us something to do in the meantime.\" John nodded with a smile and the meal progressed. The boys started talking about work and the girls started to tune them out when Steve and Charlie started laughing. \"What's so jolly funny, Master Stephen?\" asked John. \"That's not proper table manners.\" \"Got away with hogs,\" whispered Charlie which sent them both into another round of laughter. \"Congratulations Charles. You and Stephen will be doing the dirty crockery alone this evening,\" said John. \"Sorry John, stuck me funny,\" said Charlie. \"And to William, both of you,\" said John. \"Apologies William, just hacking on ya. That's all,\" said Charlie. \"Yeah, we's just hacking on ya,\" said Steve. The girls shared a small smile as they continued to eat. \"Rumor has it that you killed a man, Billy,\" said Dick. \"You don't seem like the killings sort.\" \"Yeah, Billy. What'd you kill him for?\" asked Steve around a mouth full of food. Billy sat there a moment before he answered. \"He was hacking on me.\" Steven swallowed his food and looked warily at Charlie who had done the same thing. Chavez had a smug look on his face at the comment and Ann could see the small smile on John's face. Dinner was over and the girls offered to help with clean up but John sent them off into the living room. Ann took a seat in one of the chairs while Kelsey sat down on the edge of the hearth next to the fire. Slowly the men came into join them. The only ones to stay behind were Doc and Dick. They sat at the table. Doc had a book in his hand while Dick looked on at the group by the fire. Billy was sitting cross legged on a trunk. Steve was sitting at the far end of the heart while Charlie was sitting on the bench in front of the fire. John had taken up his spot in the rocking chair again while Chavez had sat down on the other end of the fireplace. John handed a newspaper to Steven and told him to read. \"There are…plenty of men…who will never…susseed…\" read Steve \"Succeed,\" corrected John. \"Who will never succeed…anywhere…\" continued Steve. \"Got a whole room full of them here,\" said Dick from the dining table. There was a chuckled from a few of the men. \"Well done,\" said John with a smile on his face. \"William.\" Steven tried to hand the paper off to Billy but he refused. \"Well, excuse me Billy,\" said John. \"Very sorry to offend you. But we congregate in here to learn to read and write. You need more than skill with a firearm to succeed in the New World, Billy. So take up the Journal and start where the other boy left off. Or you can go back to your home on the streets.\" Billy took the paper from Steve and started to read, \"Young men who don't know how to do any kind of business and have no energy or application had better stay at home near their relatives so they can be taken care of.\" Doc and Richard looked surprised at how well Billy could read. Billy continued, \"They are not wanted here and will only come to grief. But men of enterprise are practically sure of success.\" Billy folded the paper and tossed it down. \"Splendid,\" said John. \"A splendid reading, William. Thank you. Good night, gentlemen.\" John walked from the room. A moment later he returned, \"Ladies, there is an empty bunk house if you wish to sleep there tonight.\" \"Thank you,\" said Ann. John nodded his head as he left the room. Ann stood up and straightened her skirts before she turned towards the door. Kelsey reluctantly stood up to follow. \"Allow me to escort you to your bunkhouse,\" said Charlie practically tripping over himself to open the door for them. \"Thank you,\" said Ann as she walked through the door. Once the girls were settled and sure that the boys had gone to bed they undressed and climbed into bed. \"So what are we going to do?\" asked Kelsey. \"Try not to get wrapped up in this,\" said Ann. \"You know as well as I do how it ends.\" Kelsey let out a sigh, \"Yeah. After a moment Kelsey chuckled. \"Charlie seems to like you.\" \"Don't get involved!\" said Ann as she rolled over and closed her eyes. A/N: I', so sorry for taking this long to post! Everything got a way from me. Its not easy to find time to write with a new baby! Anyway, here is chapter two, i'm writting chapter 3, but my disc is messing up so it may be a while before i'm able to get that one posted. But until then, enjoy![Chapter 3] The girls woke early the next morning. At some point the trunk had been placed outside the bunkhouse door. They pulled it into the building and they each pulled out a dress. Once they were dressed and ready for the day they left the building and made their way to the main house. When Kelsey opened the door the smell of coffee hit her in the face. They walked into the dining room and saw that the boys were sitting at the table. \"OH! I didn't realize we over slept!\" said Kelsey. \"No, you are right on time. We were about to say the blessing,\" said John. Charlie quickly stood up and pulled Ann' chair out for her. She smiled as she sat down at the table. He then turned to do the same for Kelsey. \"Thank you,\" she said with a small smile. John nodded to Charlie and said the blessing. Breakfast was a quiet meal and when they had finished the men quickly left to start their morning chores. The girls had convinced John to let them clean up since they were late to breakfast. He nodded and left the house. They were in the middle of drying to dishes when Ann saw a group of men come over the top of the hill. \"Uh-oh,\" said Ann. \"What?\" said Kelsey. \"Trouble has arrived,\" she said pointing out the window. \"Shit,\" said Kelsey. They set the dishes down and watched the events unfold. Of course Billy had disappeared when the men had showed up. After a few tense moments the group rode off and the Regulators went back to work. By mid-morning the girls had cleaned up the main house. John was delighted to see the place clean. They were sitting around the fire when there was a knock at the door. John stood up and answered it. \"Mr. Tunstall, my name is J. McCloskey. I, uh, heard you were having some trouble finding help,\" he said. \"McCloskey? You're one of Murphy's boys, aren't you,\" said John. \"Uh, used to be,\" he said. \"He fired me. I called him a fat sow,\" he said with a chuckle. Ann and Kelsey rolled their eyes as they listened from just inside the doorway. \"Can you believe this guy,\" whispered Kelsey. \"Hush,\" said Ann. \"Did you?\" John thought a moment before saying, \"Lovely. Bunk house is over there.\" John walked back into the house just as the girls returned to their seats. He had a knowing smile on his face as he sat down and read the newspaper again. \"Ladies, do you fancy a trip into town?\" asked John. \"Really?\" said Kelsey lighting up. \"Truly,\" smiled John. Billy walked out of the store and tried on his hat. He looked at his reflection in the window. Kelsey and Ann joined him and John a few moments later. They had on new dresses and had ordered more and Johns urging. John placed a pocket watch in Billy's vest pocket as the girls walked up. \"Don't you clean up well,\" said Ann with a smile. Billy smiled before he drew his guns and watched his reflection. He did look good in his new suit. \"Come now. Time to get back,\" said John. \"We have a party to get ready for.\" The girls smiled as they climbed into the buggy and took off back towards the house. \"What is going on out there?\" asked Ann as she looked out the window. All the boys had cleaned up and were wearing their nicest clothes. Chavez was throwing his knives at the well bucket. All of a sudden gunshots rang out. Ann and Kelsey dropped behind the counter and only emerged when they head Billy laughing. \"We should've seen that coming,\" laughed Kelsey. \"Shush,\" said Ann. John ran out of the house, \"Regulators!\" Billy stopped laughing as the guys pulled themselves together. \"Let's dance,\" John said with a smile. \"Ladies,\" Ann and Kelsey walked out of the house. Billy smiled at them as he climbed off the roof. They both gave him a disgusted look as they climbed on the back of the wagon. By the time they had reached the party it was almost dark. They could hear the music playing and the girls smiled as they drew near. The wagon barely stopped when they were clamoring to get down. Charlie about fell off his horse to be the first to help. Chavez walked over and extended his hand. Kelsey smiled and took his as he helped her down. The girls were quickly swept away to dance with the men at the party. They couldn't help themselves and let loose and had some fun. \"Hello, boys,\" said Ann as she sat down next to Steve, Charlie, and McCloskey. Charlie turned white but stood up and dusted off his hands. \"Could I have tis dance?\" \"I'd be delighted,\" laughed Ann as she drug him out by the fire to dance. Kelsey watched Doc asked the Asian girl to dance. She also watched as Billy introduced himself to Pat Garrett. She rolled her eyes at the interaction. She was getting tired and was hoping that they would leave soon. Her feet were killing her too. She wasn't used to wearing shoes like this. Hell, she barely wore shoes in her own time. She preferred to run around barefoot if she could. \"Having a good time?\" asked John walking over to her. \"Yes,\" she said. \"But I'm feeling a bit tired.\" John nodded his head. \"We will leave shortly. It is the New Year after all,\" he said with a smile. Kelsey smiled back. She'd forgotten that this was the New Year party. Great , she thought. I know what happens next. Ann had found Kelsey and was sitting off to the side watching everything when they saw a man deliberately run into John. They stood up and made their way over. Charlie beat them to it, though. In fact, all the regulators had formed around the man and the nearby table. \"No, no, no,\" said Charlie. \"No. It's you and I,\" he said. \"Right John?\" \"Yes, yes, it is,\" said John. Charlie took off his coat and handed it to John. The guy took a swing and Charlie punched him a few times in the face. By this time Ann and Kelsey had made their way to the circle. The fight didn't last long before the man fell over one of the chairs. John handed Charlie his coat back. That was when Charlie noticed Ann. \"I, uh, I'm sorry you saw that,\" he said. \"You are a good fighter,\" she said. \"Nothing to be sorry of.\" Charlie smiled as he walked away. \"What happened to not getting involved?\" asked Kelsey. \"Hush,\" said Ann shoving her friend. \"HAPPY NEW YEAR!\" shouted man on stage before he fired his gun. Soon every man there was shooting up in the air. Kelsey gave a start as the shots started. She could see Chavez smiling out of the corner of her eyes. \"Not used to guns?\" he asked. \"No, not really,\" she said. \"Where did you live that there were no guns?\" he asked. \"There were guns,\" she said. \"They were just used for hunting mostly.\" Chavez nodded at her explanation. The boys were singing \"Auld Lang Syne\" as they made their way back home. Ann and Kelsey were sitting in the wagon with John when he called to Charlie and Chavez. \"Why don't you take the girls on down to the house? I'm sure they are ready for some sleep,\" said John. The boys nodded and helped the girls on the horses. At about that time a quail flew up into the air and then took off after it, Charlie and Chavez included. Billy followed shortly after. Kelsey was laughing as they chased after the bird while Ann was holding on for dear life. The boys turned when they heard gunshots. Chavez and Charlie took off while Doc tried to wrangle Billy. The smile was gone from Kelsey's face as she held on as they raced across the fields. Ann rested her head on Charlie's shoulder while Richard read from the Bible. Kelsey was nowhere to be found, which worried Ann. \"For much as it is pleased, All Mighty God…\" continued Richard. Ann wiped away a tear as she laid a flower on the grave. Kelsey was still missing. \"Where were you?!\" shouted Ann as she pulled Kelsey off to the side. \"Making a few purchases,\" she said looking over her shoulder. \"What's going on?\" \"Alex is talking to the Justice of the Peace about bringing in the men who killed John,\" said Ann. \"What kind of purchases?\" \"Just stuff we're going to need,\" said Kelsey still watching the conversation from afar. \"I'm not going to like this, am I?\" asked Ann. \"Not one bit,\" said Kelsey. \"Not one bit.\" \"Stay at the house!\" said Charlie. \"Excuse me?\" said Ann turning to look at him. \"Was I talking to you? Who are you to tell me what to do?\" \"Look here, woman,\" said Charlie. There was a gunshot and Charlie's hat flew off his head. Kelsey had come around the corner on a horse. She was dressed to the nines. She had on a pair of pants and a button shirt. She had her dark hair pulled back in a tie and a hat on her head. She was holding a gun in her hand. \"I suggest you let her do as she pleases,\" said Kelsey. \"I think I'm in love,\" said Chavez to Steve. Steve shook his head at the comment. \"Stick behind us at all times!\" shouted Richard as they all mounted up and took off. It didn't take them long to find their first victim. \"We have a warrant for Henry Hill. We should find him at the run down whorehouse just over the ridge,\" said Richard. It wasn't too long before the shack came into sight. \"Bad medicine, my friend,\" said Chavez. \"You got that right,\" said Doc. \"Well, hell Doc. You grew up in a hole worse than that, didn't ya?\" asked Steve. \"Yeah, but I've been cultured since,\" he said staring at the shack. \"Okay. Henry Hill is supposed to have been in there with a lady since noon,\" said Richard. \"We're going to show him the warrant and take him home. \"Yeah. Yeah, we gotta take him,\" said Charlie hesitantly. \"Hey, uh, Billy. Why don't you go inside have a looksee,\" said Richard. \"Go one Billy. See if Hill's in there. If he is, bring him to us.\" Billy took the warrant and rode off towards the shack. \"You know this probably isn't going to go well,\" Kelsey said to Chavez. \"No, Billy knows he's the law. He will do right,\" said Richard. \"Bet you a dollar he don't,\" said Ann rolling her eyes. \"You're on,\" said Steve. \"Now what the hell is he doing?\" asked Richard as Billy walked out of the shack. \"Still wanna make that bet, Steve?\" asked Ann. \"Yeah. I'm still in,\" he said. A few moments later a gunshot rang out. Steve let out a curse as they steadied the horses and drew their weapons. Ann and Kelly had their guns drawn as well but stayed towards the back of the group. A group of men came running out of the shack at the sound of the gunshot. The boys took off shooting at the men. The girls took the odd shot or two from the trees to give the boys a little cover. Charlie grabbed Billy's horse and took him around so that Billy could jump on. The girls hightailed it out of the trees to catch up with the boys. Kelsey let out a hiss as they took off away from the chaos. Richard started yelling at Billy as they took off back into the woods. \" Nine lay dead or at death's door yesterday noon following a gun fight between Lincoln resident Henry Hill, 45, and what patrons have called a kid. A local minor has identified the kid as Henry McCarty, also known as William H. Bonny, 19 or 20. In a flaming shoot out the kid, Billy, killed Mr. Hill then took off an onslaught of Hill partisans. Bringing the damage to 6 verified slayings. Bonny is believed to be the captain of a deputized gang ,\" read Doc, looking up from the newspaper. \"Shit, Dick,\" said Charlie. \"You send a lamb into slaughter and he walks out a king sheep!\" \"El Chivato! Billy the Kid,\" said Chavez with a smirk. \"Yeah, Murphy is going to want blood, brains, and balls for this,\" said McCloskey. Doc said something as he took off towards the end of the wall they were hiding behind. Chavez turned to say something to Kelsey when he noticed a red spot on her shirt. \"Shit!\" he said pulling her to the ground. \"Chavez! Can't it wait? I know you like the girl, but damn!\" shouted Steven. \"She's bleeding, you idiot!\" he shouted as he ripped the bottom of her shirt open. \"Get me something to wrap it with!\" Richard pulled a spare rag from his bag and they started to wrap the wound. That was when Ann came back from the store with provisions. \"What are you doing to her?\" she asked seeing Kelsey on the ground. \"Uh,\" said Charlie standing up. \"The thing is…well…she's been...\" \"She's been shot,\" said Richard not sparing her feelings. \"Son of a bitch!\" shouted Ann as she shoved Steve out of the way. She batted Chavez's hands away from the wound and grabbed her water sack. She poured the water over the wound to try to clean it before she put the rag over the whole. The whole time she was cursing under her breath. When she was finished she got up and grabbed a bottle of whiskey from one of the bags and then shook Kelsey. Kelsey groaned and grabbed her side at the sudden motion. \"What the hell did you do that for!?\" she shouted. \"Cause you're being stupid!\" shouted Ann. \"Drink this.\" \"No,\" she said turning her nose up to the bottle. \"Either you drink it or I force it down your throat,\" said Ann. \"Those are your only two options.\" Kelsey grumbled to herself as she took a large swing of the whiskey. \"Belch!\" she said after she'd swallowed. \"Nasty.\" \"That's why women folk don't drink it,\" said Steve. \"You owe me a dollar,\" she said shooting him a dirty look. \"What did I miss?\" \"Apparently Billy is the captain of this here little outfit,\" said Charlie. Billy had a smug look on his face. Kelsey just rolled her eyes. \"We got trouble,\" said Doc running behind the wall. Richard looked out of a hole in the wall to see Dolan and some of his posse riding down the street. \"So Dick,\" said Billy playing with his gun. \"Who's next?\" \"You,\" he said looking at Billy. \"How are you feeling, pequena?\" asked Chavez. \"Sore,\" said Kelsey. \"But I'll live.\" \"We'll stop here and let them come to us,\" said Richard stopping his horse. \"And you two stay out of the fight!\" Kelsey nodded as she slid off her horse. They led the horses into the brush to hid and let the boys do their thing. It didn't take long before the men they were waiting on showed up. One of them picked up some of the horse shit on the ground and picked at it saying something about the horses grazing wild. That was when Chavez snuck up behind him and put his blade to the guy's neck. The rest of the group popped out of their hiding places with guns drawn. \"Not that good,\" said Chavez. \"Buenos Dias, shitheads,\" said Richard. Ann chuckled a bit at that. \"You don't understand, Dick,\" said one of the men. \"By killing Henry Hill, y'all started a war.\" \"By killing Mr. Tunstall, you all started the damn war!\" said Richard. \"We're talking fifty, sixty, men against your, what? Six or seven?\" said one of the men. \"We're with The Ring, Dick!\" Billy said something to the man and Richard shouted at him. \"We're taking you to jail. No killing.\" \"Objection! Your Honor,\" shouted Billy. \"This isn't going to end well,\" said Kelsey getting more comfortable. \"Yeah, that's for sure,\" said Ann. \"You plan on sitting still any longer?\" \"Not really,\" said Kelsey. \"But I don't fancy getting shot again either.\" Ann chuckled at the comment. They got settled and waited for the shit to hit the fan, so to speak. \"These boys are going to the grave in the name of John Tunstall,\" said Billy. \"I said quiet, Billy! I don't need that kind of talk!\" shouted Richard. \"Law don't talk like that.\" \"Yeah, well law don't kill innocent merchants either, do they!\" said Steve. \"Shut up, dirt face,\" said Doc. Kelsey was having a hard time not laughing at the exchange between the men. \"I say we take these men up to El Capitan Mountain and blow their brains out,\" said Billy. \"What do ya say Steve?!\" Steve chuckled in agreement. Ann rolled her eyes. \"These guys are dumber than a box of rocks!\" she said. \"Duh,\" said Kelsey. \"Hey, Billy! Easy,\" said McCloskey. \"Dick, I don't think we should go by way of South Point.\" \"Why's that?\" asked Richard. \"I think Murphy'll be watching the trail in for ambush,\" said McCloskey. \"I think we should go straight through to Lincoln.\" \"Hey,\" said Billy. \"I saw that. \"Saw what?\" said McCloskey. \"What? What'd you see?\" asked Charlie. \"He knows what I just saw,\" said Billy making is way towards McCloskey. \"What ya talkin' about?\" asked McCloskey backing away. Doc pushed him forward when he got near him. \"Where's the ambush, McCloskey?\" asked Billy. \"In Lincoln? You're trying to steer us away from Captain cause your men, Murphy's men, are waiting to kill us in Lincoln.\" \"Billy! What are you talking about!? McCloskey's one of us! He's a regulator!\" shouted Richard. \"I wish they would get to shooting already. My butt is going numb from this rock,\" said Kelsey. Ann rolled her eyes. \"Yeah! But he used to ride with Murphy!\" shouted Billy. \"See, that's what I'm talking about!\" \"That was a long time ago!\" shouted Richard. \"HE'S A SPY!\" shouted Billy. \"He's been with us! We made a pact! Right McCloskey?\" said Richard. \"Right,\" he said. \"Jesus, Billy. Come on.\" McCloskey stuck out his hand. It was a tense moment while Billy stood there and did nothing. Finally Billy holstered his gun and shook his hand. \"Ah, shit. I'm sorry McCloskey,\" said Billy. \"It's all right,\" said McCloskey. \"We're all upset about John.\" \"I'm sorry I didn't sniff you out sooner, you goddamn traitor.\" Billy pulled his other pistol and shot McCloskey in the head. \"BILLY!\" shouted Richard. Doc grunted as blood sprayed across his face. \"Oh shit!\" shouted Steve and Charlie. \"BILLY!\" shouted Richard. Ann had covered her eyes and held them closed tight. \"Billy! What the heck!\" shouted Charlie. \"Jesus!\" Billy shot McCloskey in the stomach, sending him flying into the river behind Doc. Murphy's men ran for the horses and tried to leave. Chavez grabbed one of his blades and threw it, hitting one of them in the back, knocking him off his horse. After that an all out gun fight started. Ann and Kelsey dove into the dirt to avoid getting hit by a stray bullet. \"Hold your Goddamn fire!\" shouted Richard. \"Get that son of a bitch!\" shouted Doc. Steve pulled it rifle up and shot him. The body landed in the brush a few feet from Kelsey's head. Chavez walked over and pulled his knife from the body and wiped the blood off on the man's jacket. Billy had a smirk on his face. \"Court adjourned,\" he said with a chuckle. Ann and Kelsey stood up and dusted themselves off as they walked around to join the group. \"What the hell is wrong with you!?\" shouted Ann as she walked over to Billy. \"Have you lost your God damned mind!?\" Billy just stood there stunned. \"Are you incapable of foolowing simple order or are you just too stupid!?\" Ann continued to shout. \"ANN!\" shouted Kelsey. \"Stop. Let them handle it.\" Ann grunted in anger but turned to join her friend next to their horses. \"Moron!\" shouted Dick. \"You got the law on your side!\" \"Richard, he was right! McCloskey was actin' strange,\" said Doc. \"Well that means we just killed three more Murphy men, right?\" said Dick. \"Right,\" said Doc. \"Oh, Christ Jesus,\" said Charlie freaking out on his horse. \"Brady's gonna hang us for sure now!\" \"Quite!\" shouted Dick. \"Would you close that farggin' lip for a god damn second and let me think.\" \"We better skin outta here,\" said Doc. \"Okay. Everybody, skin up the river,\" said Dick. \"Now!\" The girls mounted their horses and took off after Charlie and Steve up the river leaving the others to follow behind. \"Why did you stop me?\" asked Ann as they raced down river. \"As much as Billy needs to be ripped into,\" said Kelsey. \"We can't change history. Things have got to happen the way they are supposed to happen.\" \"I still think he needs to be taught a lesson,\" said Ann. You and I both, thought Kelsey as the rest of the group caught up to them. A/N: Sorry it took so long for me to update! IFnally got my DVD working right. I'm almost done with the story so the last few chapters should go up soon. Review and let me know what you think. The rating is subject to change in the following chapters...[Chapter 4] \" Advices from Lincoln say that a young lad of lightening rigidity and iron nerve and marvelous skill apparently single handedly took down Morton and Baker of the Murphy-Dolan faction, including a miraculous shot at fifty yards ,\" read Doc. \"There's a picture here. It says \" Billy the Kid \", but it aint Billy.\" Richard stood up from the fire where he was cooking food in the skillet and took the paper from Doc. \"Let me see that,\" he said. It was his own picture accompanying the story about Billy. \"Well, that's me,\" said Dick. \"This is bullshit. Papers can't get nothin' right,\" he said walking away from the group. \" Advices from sources say a kid, a left hander, is tall, handsome and unequal in the elements that appeal to the holier emotions, \" read Doc. \"Jesus Christ this country needs a hero. \"However Murphy, of Lincoln, has hired none other than John Kinney and his bunch to help hunt down Billy the Kid and the gang. \" \"Oh, great. John Kinney,\" said Charlie. \"Well who's Kinney?\" asked Billy. \"Says here he's an ex-soldier who suffered injury and is now a bounty hunter,\" read Doc. \"Well, what's that mean?\" asked Steve. \"It means he can whoop some ass,\" said Charlie. Kelsey shook her head as she tended to the food over the fire. Ann was off by herself trying not to lay into Billy again about his actions. Kelsey looked up from the fire to see Chavez off in the distance picking things from nearby shrubs and off the ground. She shook her head knowing what was going to come next. \"Hey, Doc,\" said Dick from his spot in the forestry. \"Can you come here for a minute?\" \"Yeah,\" he said folding up the paper and handing it to Charlie. \"Well, we can't go north 'cause Murphy's got men coming out of Fort Sumner,\" said Dick. \"We can't go south because he's got Brady comin' in.\" \"Yeah,\" said Doc. \"East is no good 'cause we got John Kinney comin' up now,\" said Dick. \"We could go west,\" said Dick. \"But there is that reservation.\" \"Yeah, and they are havin' a good year with scalps,\" said Doc. \"No thanks, Richard.\" \"I don't know what to do,\" said Dick. \"What the hell's he doing?\" asked Dick as Chavez walked by. Night finally fell and the group gathered around the fire to eat. It was a quiet affair. Chavez didn't eat much and sat off by himself during the meal. Once everyone was down they set the dirty dishes off to the side. That was when Chavez returned to the fire. Now his face was painted white a black. He resembled a skeleton. \"We have come to a place where we are lost, no?\" he said. \"When an Indian is lost he must reach into the Spirit World to find the way. On the Spirit Road he will be shown a sign. This is the way to the Spirit Road.\" \"Is he for real?\" asked Ann. \"Shut up. And yes,\" said Kelsey. \"We're lost right now, but I will find us the way,\" he said taking a drink from the bowl. \"Oh, Christ, Chavez,\" said Steve. \"That's all we need is some more of your red-ass Navey-ho mamba-jahamba. We're running out of time here, Chavez.\" \"Shut it, Steve,\" said Kelsey. \"What are you getting in a twist for?\" he asked. \"I'm half Navajo as well, you dipshit,\" said Kelsey. \"Great. Another one,\" grunted Steve. Kelsey started to lean over to hit him when Ann pulled her back into her spot next to the fire. Chavez took a sip of the liquid in the bowl. He passed it off to Billy who did the same thing. \"Is that any good?\" asked Charlie as Billy coughed. \"Chavez, what-what is that?\" \"Peyote,\" said Chavez. Slowly the bowl made its way around the fire until it got to Ann. \"I'm not drinking that,\" she said sniffing it. \"Do it,\" said Kelsey. \"Now!\" Ann grunted as she sipped the drink. She had to keep from gagging at the taste of it. She passed it on to Kelsey who finished off the little bit of liquid. She had never had Peyote before and she wasn't sure she would want to after the night was over. The only one not to drink it was Richard. He just watched the rest of the group. As the group sat around the fire the peyote started to kick in. A few of them started to stare at their hands like it was something new. Slowly they stood and went off on their own. Ann started giggling for no reason. Dick just rolled his eyes at everyone's actions. Kelsey stood up and walked away from the fire. Ann and Richard were the only ones left sitting next to the fire. She still had a smile on her face but her giggles had died down. She turned to Richard and smiled. \"What?\" he asked. \"You're so stern all the time,\" she said, furrowing in eyebrows. \"Someone has to keep them in line,\" he said poking the fire. \"Not Billy,\" she said. \"He thinks he's better than everyone else. He needs to have a good beatin' to knock some sense into him. You're cute…\" \"Yeah…wait, what?\" said Richard catching the last bit of her sentence. \"You're cute. I like you…I think you're pretty,\" she said taking his hat and putting it on her head. Richard leaned over to take his hat back when Ann launched herself at him. She knocked them both over so that he was lying on the ground. He stared up at her, shocked at her forwardness. \"How long has it been?\" she asked with a drunken smile on her face. \"Ex-excuse me?\" he said. \"How long since you've had a woman?\" she asked again. She didn't wait for a response before she kissed him. It had indeed been a long time since Richard, or most of the men, had been with a woman. And even though he was the only one left with his senses, he wasn't going to pass up this opportunity. He rolled them over so that he was lying on top of Ann and returned the kiss, tossing his hat to the side. Kelsey wandered around the camp. She could hear Doc talking to himself about butterflies and flowers and how they relate to his relationship with Lin. Steve was starting to freak out bit. Slowly, as she rounded a boulder she saw Chavez standing on the top of a cliff. She stopped and stared. The sun was starting to rise at this point. \"Kelsey,\" Chavez said as he came down from the cliff. Kelsey stared at him, but didn't say anything. She was starting to feel a tingling sensation make its way through her body. He was staring at her. He had a contemplative look on his face, as well. Before either one of them said something Kelsey launched herself at him, knocking them both to the ground. Chavez countered and rolled them so that he was lying on top of her. They were shielded from the rest of the group by a grouping of shrubbery. Neither one of them said a thing as Kelsey started pulling at his shirt. Chavez did the same, sending buttons flying in different directions. Kelsey moaned as he leaned forward and kissed and sucked on her collarbone. She started pulling at the lacing on his pants as he continued his assault on her neck. Chavez moaned when Kelsey brushed across his stiff member. She smiled and lifted her hips into his. Whatever coherent thought he had went out the window at that point. He leaned back long enough to undo the lacing of her own pants and pull them down to her ankles. They were way past niceties and comforts. He freed himself from his pants and thrust into Kelsey. Kelsey moaned as she dug her nails into his shoulders, leaning half-moon indents. \"Regulators! Saddle up!\" shouted Richard. \"Godless heathens.\" Chavez and Kelsey had redressed by this point. Chavez jumped up onto the back of his horse, screaming a battle cry, as Kelsey made her way over to her own. Billy climbed onto his horse backwards and grabbed the tail thinking they were the reigns. As started on their journey again Charlie started singing. Ann had started giggling again and was having trouble stopping. Kelsey had a smile glued to her face as she followed Chavez's horse. Soon they came upon and Indian settlement. They were giving them all strange looks. Billy was greeting them as his horse went by them. \"Hey Chavez, how come they aint killing us?\" asked Charlie. \"We're in the Spirit World, asshole,\" said Steve. \"They can't see us!\" By the time they stopped to water the horses everyone had come down from their high. Ann had stopped giggling and seemed to be staring at Richard and blushing when he would turn to look at her. It seemed like he was avoiding her as well. Steve took a swing of his whiskey before he corked it. He turned to look out at the river and saw a man approaching them. \"Lord forgive us for our wrong doings, for our misguiding's by heathen religions. Thank you for keeping us alive,\" prayed Richard. When he paused Billy assumed he was done and reached for the food. That was when Richard started up again. \"Please help guide us in doing the right thing. Our Father, who art in Heaven. Hallowed be thy name…\" \"Please, Dick, it's getting' cold!\" said Billy. Both men drew their guns on each other. \"I coulda killed ya, Dick,\" said Billy. \"I coulda killed ya.\" Kelsey rolled her eyes at the confrontation. She smiled when she felt Chavez toe her boots with his own. She could've swore she saw him smirk out of the corner of her eye. \"But I don't want to kill you. I want to eat,\" said Billy. \"When we finish this meal, you little rodent, we're going to go out in the yard and see who has the right to run this group of regulators,\" said Richard. \"Richard, would be so kind as to pass the gravy, please,\" said Doc trying to break the tension and change the subject. \"Mighty well held man headed this way,\" said Steve running into the building. \"Just one?\" asked Richard. \"Uh-huh,\" said Steve. \"Good Lord, it's \"Buckshot\" Roberts,\" said Charlie from the window. \"We got a warrant for him,\" said Richard, still eyeing Billy with his gun drawn. \"You think he's comin' to surrender?\" asked Doc drinking his coffee. \"Don't look that way,\" said Charlie. \"He any good?\" asked Billy as Chavez took a bight of chicken off his knife. Kelsey smiled at his non-chalant attitude at the whole situation. \"He's killed more people than small pox,\" said Charlie. \"Well, hell, introduce us,\" said Billy putting his gun away. \"Stay inside the damn building,\" said Richard looking at Ann, first, then to Kelsey who was still eating. \"But…\" said Kelsey around a mouthful of food. \"Stay put,\" said Chavez standing up to follow them out. Kelsey grumbled as they left the building. She and Ann walked over to the window to watch what was happening. The men made their way out into the yard as Roberts pulled his rifle out of its saddle holster. \"Got a warrant for you, old man,\" said Dick. \"I aint got no business with that war no more,\" he said holding a rifle in one hand and a shotgun in the other. I'm on my own. I'm here to get that $150 Sheriff Brady is puttin' down for The Kid. The rest of you little shits is only worth $110, but I'll take it,\" he said eying the group. \"What's going on?\" asked Ann. \"I can't read lips,\" said Kelsey. \"And I don't rightly remember what they say…\" \"But?\" said Ann. \"But what?\" said Kelsey not looking at her friend. \"There is a but to that sentence, you just didn't say it,\" said Ann. \" But I remember what happens,\" said Kelsey. \"And?\" asked Ann. \"Just eat your food,\" said Kelsey avoiding the question. \"What a sweet disposition,\" said Doc. Roberts dropped the rifle to the ground and cocked the shotgun. \"Let's Dance!\" The group scattered behind various object that were in the yard as they started exchanging fire. Chavez was shot in arm before he could find cover. \"Chavez!\" shouted Dick from behind a stack of logs. \"Son of a bitch!\" shouted Kelsey as she grabbed her gun. Before she could get to the door the owner slammed it closed and stood in front of it. \"That Indian told me to keep you in here,\" he said with a shaky voice. \"I will shoot you,\" she said. \"I'm more afraid of what he'll do to me then you, ma'am,\" said the man. \"Goddamn it!\" she shouted slamming her gun on the table. As the fight continued Roberts went into the outhouse. \"Chavez?\" shouted Doc. \"What?\" he replied. \"He's going into the shitter,\" said Richard. \"Billy, go in there and cut that son of a bitch in half.\" Billy just stared at Richard. \"I'm daring ya, Billy,\" said Dick. Billy smirked at him and pulled his pistols out as he stepped from behind the logs. As he did Roberts kicked the door open and started shooting at them again. \"Screw that!\" said Billy ducking behind the logs. Roberts opened fire on them again as the door swung open. The boys returned fire as the door swung closed. After a moment the shooting stopped and they heard grunting from inside the outhouse. \"Cover me,\" said Richard as he stood up. As he neared the outhouse Roberts stuck his gun through a hole in the door and shot him three times. Steve shouted as he opened fire on the outhouse. The rest of the regulators followed suit. Ann was screaming as she ran for the door. The poor owner didn't stand a chance. Ann knocked him out of the way, as if he didn't weigh a thing, and jerked the door open. As she stepped outside the Regulators were climbing on their horses. Kelsey helped Doc get Chavez onto a horse before she climbed up with him. Doc pulled and over to his horse forcing her to climb up. He slowly made his way up behind her before they took off out of the town. They were a good distance away from the town and Ann still hadn't stopped crying. They were slowly making their way across an open desert brush. They rode down into a hollow before they dismounted. Once Chavez was off the horse Kelsey jumped down and started to tend to his wound. \"Where to Doc?\" asked Billy. \"The road into Patricia looks safe,\" he said. \"I've got to write Dick's mother in Vermont. Get some clean wraps for this,\" he said raising his bloodied hang. \"Well, whatever you do, don't go near Lincoln,\" said Billy. \"See ya,\" said Doc as he turned his horse and rode off. \"Whatcha doin' there, Billy?\" asked Steve as he shoved a large was of chewing tobacco in his mouth. \"Well, with the side filed down, I get an eighth of a second drop on our good Sheriff Brady,\" said Billy. \"Billy, we can't touch the Sheriff, Dick said so. You know that,\" said Charlie. \"Besides, we can't keep this up.\" \"Yeah, well, Dick aint around anymore, is he, Charlie?\" said Billy. \"You heartless bastard!\" shouted Ann, lunging for Billy. Billy fell backwards off his bedroll. Ann was clawing and smacking at him. It too both Kelsey and Charlie to pull her off of him. \"Calm down!\" shouted Kelsey. \"We're all upset about Richard,\" she said giving Billy a dirty look. \"But you have to keep your head about you. Understand?\" Ann grunted her agreement as she sat back down next to her bedroll. \"Right now Sheriff Brady is in desperate need of being removed from office,\" said Billy dusting himself off. \"We're not going after Brady,\" said Chavez. \"No Murphy men, no more. I told you I would find a way and the way is west.\" \"West, huh?\" said Billy. \"Well west is that way, and the bastards we gotta kill are that way,\" he said pointing in a different direction. \"The only bastards that are going to get killed are us, Chivato. Let it go,\" said Chavez. \"Let it go!? Murphy's taking inventory in Tunstall's store right now and you're saying it means nothing to you?!\" said Billy. Chavez slowly turned to face him. He was standing up on a ridge above the group. \"It means nothing to me? Murphy and his politicians have taken more blood from me than they ever will from you.\" \"Yeah, how you figure?\" said Billy with a cocky attitude. \"The Red Sand Creek Reservation,\" said Chavez. \"What's he talkin' about?\" asked Billy. \"I dunno…\" said Steve. \"207 people butchered in the snow with their stomachs emptied. My mother's people,\" said Chavez. \"You see, Murphy and company was under government contract to supply us with beef. And two winters ago he sent only rotten meat. No corn, no flour. Only rancid beef crawling with worms. So I went out with a band in the night to a trader's camp to try and get food. Oh, yeah, they welcomed us in and then they opened fire on us. Only I got away, only me. But when I got back to the Red Sands, I found out that the army had already heard about out big Indian uprising and they beat us back.\" Kelsey has sank down next to the fire while he was talking. She wiped a tear away from her face as he continued talking. \"My mother was cut by a saber from her privates to her neck! My sisters were just babies and they had their heads bashed in with boot heels SO THAT THE ARMY COULD SAVE BULLETS! EVERYBODY ON MY RESERVATION WAS BUTCHERED, AND IT MEANS NOTHING TO ME!? Oh yeah, yeah, I went to Lincoln to take Murphy's head, and that's when John Tunstall found me. And he took me in, and he taught me a better way to bury Murphy.\" \"Murphy buried him the old Irish way, Chavez,\" said Steve. \"That's right, Steve,\" said Billy. \"And he starved out your family, Chavez. And now he's doing to every small farmer in the territory.\" \"Uh-huh,\" agreed Steve. \"But you want to run, go ahead. Just go right on ahead. Bye,\" said Billy. \"Got no loyalty, Navajo.\" \"Navajo,\" said Steve. \"No. We had our ceremony back on the ridge, chivato. Now, I don't know what your vision told you, but my vision told me that we're headed for blood. Blood like a river. I'm the last of my clan, the last of my people. If I die, then I'm not afraid of dying,\" said Chavez. \"Now, I have to go west to make my people live again.\" Chavez turned walked over to his horse. When he reached it stopped and turned. \"Charlie, are you comin' with me?\" he asked. Charlie stood up from the fire and looked between Billy and Steve. \"You're not saying much, Steve,\" said Charlie. \"That's because he doesn't have much to say,\" said Billy. \"You see, Steve understands the meaning of the word \"pals\". Don't you, Steve,\" said Billy. \"You got three or four good pals, why then you got yourself a tribe. There aint nothing stronger than that. We're your family now, Chavez. You walk away from us, you break our sacred hope. We got to stick together fellows, that's the only way I see it.\" Chavez mounted his horse and turned it west. Kelsey watched him as he disappears over the ridge. \"What are you thinking?\" asked Ann. Kelsey didn't say anything. She dusted off her pants and walked over to her horse. She mouthed it and turned it west as well. \"If you leave us now, Kelsey, there won't be anyone to protect you. You will be on your own!\" shouted Billy. Kelsey glared at him as she kicked her horse. \"WAIT!\" shouted Ann, jumping to her feet. \"How am I supposed to get home without you?\" \"You'll figure it out,\" said Kelsey as she took off to catch up with Chavez. \"Chavez, hold up,\" said Kelsey as she caught up to him. \"What do you want?\" he asked slowing his horse but not stopping. \"Look, I hate Billy half as much as you do,\" she said grabbing the reigns and pulling the horse to make him stop. \"But they are your friends. John wouldn't want you abandoning them when they need you most. Billy is as dumb as dirt. He's going to get them killed!\" \"You think I don't know that!?\" he shouted. \"Don't yell at me,\" she said. \"I tried to come out here and be helpful. Make you see things right. I'm going back for Ann, I'm not going to let him get her killed. She's my friend. And if I die trying, the so be it.\" Kelsey turned her horse around and made for Lincoln. She knew that's exactly where Billy was going to be. Kelsey was walking out of a small hotel when she heard gunfire. She turned to see Billy standing in the middle of the street. She saw Steve and Charlie run out from behind a fence. She heard yelling and saw Chavez come riding around the corner. He threw one of his knives, hitting the man in the neck. Kelsey made a dive behind the wall to see Ann just sitting there with her head in her lap, clutching her knees. \"Having fun yet?\" asked Kelsey loading her gun. \"Not in the slightest,\" said Ann. \"Come on! Saddle up!\" shouted Billy as he mounted his horse. Kelsey smiled as she rode up next to Chavez, but he wouldn't look at her. They made their way to Alex's house. \"This is for you, Alex,\" said Billy handing over a picture of himself. \"You weren't supposed to touch Brady!\" said Alex. \"Sheriff Brady sent the men who killed John,\" defended Billy. \"It was a good move for us, Alex. \"Oh, was it Billy?\" \"Yes it was!\" \"Have you seen The Independent ? The Governor has revoked your deputization powers! You're now wanted by the legitament law as well as those outside the law,\" said Alex. \"You're not only being hunted by John Kinney and Murphy's men, you're being hunted by troops. Fort Stanton, Billy, the U.S. Army. The governor has but a $200 bounty on your head!\" said Alex starting to pace. \"You were supposed to serve 11 warrants and expose The Ring. Instead you went out on a war path , on a rampage. Now Richard's dead and we're living up here like fugitives. What the hell you think you're doing out there?!\" \"I don't know. Maybe I'm trying to get some attention,\" said Billy. \"Maybe I'm trying to get President Hayes to look this way. He'll let Murphy and his bankers get away with anything and I can't allow that.\" Said Billy. \"The more bastards I dust, the more stories they write. More troops they send after us the more President Hayes will raise an eyebrow and come down to see for himself what's going on here. And they'll find out who's really doin' the killin'.\" \"Alex, what are you gonna do?\" asked Charlie. \"I'm going to try to reach the President myself, legally,\" said Alex. \"Won't be easy to get past the governor.\" \"Yeah, I got plans for the governor,\" said Billy. \"Alex, what if you can't get in touch with Hayes?\" asked Doc. \"I'll go back to Lincoln and reopen John's store. Try to deal with that. That's what John would want,\" said Alex. \"Well, we'll escort ya,\" said Billy. \"You'd be a death sentence to anyone now, Billy. I don't want your help,\" said Alex. \"Alex, you didn't see what they did to John,\" said Billy. \"We did.\" Billy tried to hand the picture off to Alex again. \"Christ Billy,\" said Alex looking away from them. \"What about them girls?! Huh? You willing to get them killed, too?\" \"They chose to come along. They knew what they were gettin' into. I aint responsible for them!\" said Billy. \"You're right,\" said Alex. \"Hell, you're not even responsible for the men that ride with you, either. Are you?\" Billy didn't answer. Alex shook his head again. \"They stay here,\" he said. \"If you take off to continue doing this, then I want them to stay here. They are less likely to get killed if they are here with us.\" \"Wait just a minute,\" said Kelsey standing up. \"Billy was right. We did choose to ride with them. We knew damn well what we were getting into when we did so. So you can't just say what we can't just say what we can and can't do.\" 'He's right,\" said Billy. \"And I aint gonna have no more women-folk ride with me.\" Kelsey pulled out her gun and pointed it at Billy. \"What about me or my personality constitutes me as women-folk ? I shoot just as well as you men-folk do and I red better than half of you. So you won't tell me what I can and can't do. Understood?\" \"Put your gun away,\" said Alex. Billy turned and handed the picture to Susan, Alex's wife. \"Thank you, Billy,\" she said. \"Billy, please go to Old Mexico. Please?\" Billy put his hat on and turned away from her. He looked down at the badge pinned to his chest. He pulled it off and tossed it in the dirt at Alex's feet. \"Gentlemen, let's ride,\" he said walking off to his horse. Steve stood up and tossed a tin cup to the ground. He pulled off his badge and tossed it at Alex's feet as well. Charlie and Chavez did the same. Doc stood up from the seat and walked up to Alex. \"Alex…\" he said. \"What the hell happened, Doc?\" asked Alex. \"There's a whirlwind out there,\" said Doc. \"When you're in it, you can't get out. I'm sorry,\" he said looking at the badge in his hands. \"I was wondering if you remember that China Doll. You know, the one that danced the Fandango? I was sorta thinkin that since you're a lawyer and all, that maybe there was a legal way…\" \"I don't even have enough ground to stand on anymore, Doc,\" said Alex. \"I mean…\" \"Okay…okay…\" he said fingering the badge in his hands. \"Thanks,\" he said handing the badge to Alex. \"Take care of yourself, Alex.\" Doc walked off and mounted his horse. Ann and Kelsey stood up. Kelsey smiled at Alex and Susan before she walked off to mount her horse. When she turned around Ann was still standing by the house. \"Aren't you coming?\" she asked. \"No. I'm going to stay here,\" said Ann. \"I think Alex is right. It is safer for us here than off riding with Billy.\" Kelsey nodded her head as she kicked her horse. She took off out of the fence and caught up the rest of the group. Ann sighed as she followed Susan into the house.[Chapter 5] \"Dirty Steve told me, Billy,\" said Charlie. \"Told me what they were writing in the papers.\" \"Steven told him about the party Sheriff Peppin is plannin' for us,\" said Doc. \"Party? Oh, you mean the hangin',\" said Billy with a smile. Kelsey and Doc both rolled their eyes and Chavez looked as if he wanted to smack Billy. \"Goddamn it Billy!\" shouted Charlie. \"You ever seen a man hang? His face turns flat purple and his eyes come up on him.\" \"Yeah, I seen Red Smitty hang,\" said Billy. \"Seen his head come clean off,\" said Billy laughing. \"It was a hell of a sight.\" \"Billy,\" said Doc. \"I don't think Charlie wants to hear about Red Smitty. I think what he's like to hear is that we're not going to hang.\" \"You mess your trousers, they say,\" said Charlie. \"Gals watching and everything,\" he said motioning to Kelsey. \"Leave me outta this,\" she said. \"Well, if we get caught Charlie,\" said Billy. \"We're gonna hang.\" \"We gotta do something before they catch us,\" said Charlie. \"Y'all gotta let me do somethin'.\" \"Okay, Charlie,\" said Billy nodding his head. They all mounted their horses and took off. After a few hours of riding they came to a small town. Charlie led them through the town to a small building. \"Damn, Charlie, this is your last wish?\" said Steve. \"Get your little carrot wet? You coulda done that back in Juarez.\" \"Something called a special woman, Dirt face,\" said Doc dismounting. \"Someday you'll understand that.\" \"All right gentlemen, square up and shell out for Bowdre,\" chuckled Billy. \"We'll be at the den. Just yell if you need any help.\" The group left Charlie and headed into the local bar. They made their way to the back of the place and sat down before ordering a round of drinks. While they were in there Doc and Steve started up a game of cards. A woman walked over to Chavez and started to sit down next to him. Kelsey glared at her and she walked away. \"What'd you do that for?\" asked Billy. \"None of your damn business,\" said Kelsey tossing back a shot before walking to the bar for another one. One her way back the group looked up at the bar. There was a man standing there talking about how he was going to capture Billy the Kid. Kelsey rolled her eyes as she sat down next to Chavez. But Chavez was busy looking for the woman she'd scared off. She scoffed and downed her drink before she left the building all together. \"What's wrong with her?\" asked Steve. Doc just shook his head as he watched Billy. Kelsey walked through the town and looked at all the women. They were pretty in their own right. She looked down at her outfit. Chavez really hadn't given her second look since she'd donned the outfit, with the exception of the romp during the Peyote high. She sighed as she stopped one of the women. \"Excuse me, miss,\" she said. The woman stared at her in confusion. She sighed again. She was going to have to speak Spanish, or at least try. \"Um, where can I find a dress? \" asked Kelsey in her broken Spanish. The woman smiled and patted her hand before dragging her towards one of the small houses. \"Where is Kelsey!?\" shouted Doc as they mounted their horses. \"The hell if I know! Let's get outa here!\" shouted Billy kicking his horse. Chavez looked around as he mounted his horse. He was fixing to follow the group out when he saw Kelsey walking out of a woman's home. She was in a dress. He whistled to get her attention. \"WE GOTTA SKIN OUT! JOHN KINNEY IS ON HIS WAY!\" shouted Chavez. He watched her say something to old woman before she hiked up her skirts and ran for her horse. She pulled herself up onto the horse with ease before she kicked it and took off after the group. As they raced across the desert terrain John Kinney and his gang chased after them. \"Where are we headed!?\" shouted Kelsey as she caught up to Chavez. \"I don't know!\" he shouted following the group. They ran down a hill and into thorny weeds. The horses protested but the urged them through the tall grass with vigor. As they rode through the grass it ripped and tore at Kelsey's dress. She cursed the whole way through, urging her horse to run faster. They finally lost Kinney and his crew and took refuge next to a hot spring. Everyone dismounted and took care of their horses. While Kelsey was tending to her horse Billy started to read from a book he'd picked up in the town. Doc disrobed and sank into the hot spring while Chavez pulled thorns from Charlie's ass. \"I know, I know. It breaks my heart,\" said Chavez as he poured whiskey on to the wound before taking a sip from the bottle. Once he was done with Charlie he corked the bottle and walked over to Kelsey. She was shaking out her dress and cursing up a storm. \"Why are you wearing that?\" he asked. \"I can very well ride around naked, now can I,\" she said glaring at him. Chavez chuckled. \"That's not how I meant it. I was just trying to figure out why you would go back to wearing a dress when we're gonna be doing the riding that we're doing.\" Kelsey sighed as she unrolled her saddle bag. She'd packed her pants and shirt away after the lady had brought her the dress. \"If you have to ask, then there is no point in me telling you why,\" she said disappearing behind her horse to change clothes. Chavez frowned and followed her behind the horse. She quickly pulled the shirt closed around her chest. She was still wearing the tattered skirt. \"Why'd ya do it?\" he asked again. Kelsey rolled her eyes. \"Cause I was being stupid, that's why,\" she said buttoning the shirt. She reached for the pants but Chavez pulled them out of her reach. \"I need those,\" she said. \"I can't wear this anymore. It's completely tattered.\" \"I can see that,\" he said. \"But I want to know why you changed.\" Kelsey sighed in defeat. \"I wanted you to notice me.\" \"I do notice you,\" he said. \"It's not like I've ignored you.\" \"That's not what I mean,\" she said grabbing for the pants. \"Then what do you mean?\" he asked pulling them just out of her reach again. \"You haven't given me second look since we were on the ridge,\" she said. \"And when we were back at the bar you only had eyes for the whore who was serving drinks.\" This time when Kelsey made a grab for her pants she was successful. She slid them on under her skirt and fastened them before she pulled the skirt away and tossed it to the side. \"You did it for attention?\" he asked with a smirk. \"Don't laugh at me,\" she said glaring at him. Kelsey pushed past him and back around to where the group was. Billy was still reading from the book when Steve popped up out of the hot spring with a wad of tobacco in his mouth. \"Billy, I was thinking about our course,\" said Doc messing with the bandages on his hand. \"And it looks like we've done a big circle, twice.\" \"Yeah, and?\" said Billy still looking at the book. \"Well, it also looks like we're going back into Lincoln. I know we can't be going back into Lincoln,\" said Doc. \"We are,\" said Billy. \"That aint a good idea, Billy\" said Steve. \"Christ in heaven Billy, what are you thinkin'?\" said Doc. \"Billy, we're lucky to be alive,\" said Charlie. \"Going' back to Lincoln, well, that's crazy.\" \"Lincoln's where we'll find the rest of the men who killed John,\" said Billy. \"It's 100 against 5!\" said Doc. \"Six,\" said Kelsey. She was sitting next to the fire trying to cook up some sort of meal before they took off again. \"It's a hundred against five,\" mocked Billy. \"Six,\" said Kelsey again, but they weren't paying attention to her. \"We take Murphy and The Ring falls,\" said Billy. \"We take him and we win this war. Then it will be over.\" \"We can't even get to him, Billy,\" said Steve. \"It's not just a hundred men. There's bounty hunters too, everywhere we go,\" said Chavez. \"But not west.\" \"Oh, Christ, here we go again,\" said Billy rolling his eyes. \"No! I followed you! I chose your way chivato, but I don't trust it anymore. Now California is where we have to go,\" said Chavez. \"Dang it to money! I believe in that Spirit World stuff, Chavez. Let's go,\" said Charlie. \"Yeah, California sounds about right to me.\" \"You're all scared,\" said Billy. Steve sat up straighter in the water taking a slight offense to the accusation. Charlie took a sip of the whiskey and nodded his head. \"And you're gonna fail the test,\" said Billy. \"What test?\" asked Doc. \"You have to test yourself everyday gentlemen,\" said Billy. \"Once you stop testing yourself you get slow. And when that happens they kill ya. You guys don't feel that? Whoo! Like when John Kinney's riddin' up on our ass and the balls are flyin' and the blood goes right to your head? Whoa!\" said Billy firing a shot from him gun, startling Charlie. \"Ha ha! Whoo! It's quite a sensation.\" \"Yeah, I bet it is,\" said Doc. \"And I'm sure in your mind you hear a trumpet sound and angels singing a farggin' hymn. I shit my goddamn britches, okay! We've taken enough goddamn Murphy scalps. We cannot win this war! Not the five of us! Do you understand?\" said Doc. \"Billy, you want to get the presidents attention, go ahead. You want to keep on testing yourself, fine. Let me tell you something. Tonight I'm ridding to the border and I'm going to get myself a hot meal and a good night's sleep and come morning I'm a Mexican.\" \"Yeah, Billy. Yeah, me too,\" said Charlie. \"Mexico, huh?\" said Billy. \"Yeah,\" said Charlie and Doc. \"I see,\" said Billy. \"Y'all are testing yourselves and you don't even know it. Trying to make it to Old Mexico, that's a hoot,\" chuckled Billy. \"What do ya mean?\" asked Doc. \"They'll be covering every possible which way in from Texas to Arizona,\" said Billy. \"John Kinney knows everyone down along the border. There's a good days ride through those thorns we love so much. Which makes a good hiding place for scalp hunters and renegade Indians. The chances of making Old Mexico, well hell, that's the test of all tests if you ask me. I'm in,\" he said with a smirk. \"And now that you're done being a jackass, why don't you shut your trap long enough to eat something,\" said Kelsey as she pulled the skillet off the fire. They boys gathered around the fire and dished out some of the food and ate in silence. Kelsey looked up at one point to see Chavez staring at her. She glared at him before returning her attention back to her food. When they were done eating they packed up their horses and started for the border. As they came to a border town a woman started yelling. The town's people came out cheering and shouting \"El Chivato\" as Billy rode into town. Kelsey rolled her eyes at the spectacle. The dismounted in front of the hotel in the town and Billy disappeared into the bath house, telling Doc he wanted him to transcribe a letter for him. Doc nodded and followed him into the bath house with a pencil and pad of paper. \"Senorita?\" said the woman. \"Oh, yes?\" said Kelsey looking to the woman. \"New clothes? Yes?\" said the woman. \"Uh, por favor,\" said Kelsey. The woman smiled and led her into one of the buildings while the men disappeared. Kelsey came out of the building an hour later completely bathed and in a new dress. She had her hair pulled back off her face. As she came out there where some children running about. A girl ran after a couple boys crying. The boys had her dolly. Kelsey frowned at the action. When the boys ran by her again she yanked the doll from his grasp and glared at him. He gasped and ran off in a different direction. She handed the doll to the girl, who smiled in return. Gracias, Senorita!\" she shouted as she ran off. Kelsey smiled as she walked across the main square of the town. As she neared the center of town she saw Steve running across the way to the bath house. \"What's going on?\" she asked Chavez. \"Charlie's getting' married,\" he said. \"What!?\" said Kelsey looking at him. That night after the wedding the whole town threw a party for Charlie and Manuela. Kelsey couldn't help but be in a good mood as she watched Charlie and his bride dance around. \"It's good to see you smiling again,\" said Chavez sitting down next to Kelsey. \"Go away,\" she said frowning. \"No,\" he said. \"I want to talk to you,\" he said placing a hand on her thigh. \"You can avoid me.\" \"Like hell,\" she said looking at him, brushing his hand from her leg. \"I might not be able to avoid you, but I sure as hell don't have to talk to you.\" \"Why are you mad at me? What did I do?\" he asked. \"You laughed at me,\" she said. \"I don't take kindly to being laughed at.\" \"What are you talking about?\" said Chavez. \"When I was chanign' out of my ruined dress,\" she said. \"You laughed at the reasons why I bought it.\" Chavez shook his head. \"I wasn't laughin' at you.\" \"Sure as shit seemed like it,\" she said. Chavez grabbed her hand in his. \"I was laughing at the fact that you thought you had to wear a dress for me to notice you.\" Kelsey started to protest. \"Hush and listen,\" said Chavez. \"I haven't been able to get you out of my mind since that night on the ridge, Kelsey. No woman has ever had that kind of hold on me. And it scares me,\" he said gripping her hand tighter. \"It scares me because if we get caught we're going to hang and I'm going to lose you.\" \"I'd hang too,\" she said. \"No. They don't know you're with us. They'll just assume we've kidnapped you. And if they find us I wasn't you to do just that.\" \"Act like I've been kidnapped?!\" she said. \"Are you crazy?!\" \"No, but that's what you're gonna do. Understand? For one, do as I ask, please?\" he said. She could see the hurt and pleading in his eyes. She consented and nodded her head at his request. \"Thank you,\" he said kissing her cheek. \"Now, as for you wearing these dresses…\" \"What's wrong with my dress?\" she said. \"Nothing,\" he said picking up the bottom of the skirt. \"It's just a lot of fabric to get you out of.\" \"Excuse me!?\" she said. Chavez stood up and pulled her to her feet. Before she had a chance to object he tossed her over his shoulder and made for his room at the hotel. Kelsey started laughing as they neared the building. \"Put me down!\" she said smacking his back. \"I'll go willingly!\" she said. Chavez chuckled as he set her down. He wrapped his arms around her waist and pulled her close to kiss her. Kelsey wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him into the kiss. They were startled out of their embrace by a gunshot. \"Regulators!\" shouted Billy. \"Let's mount up!\" \"What the hell is he doin' now?\" said Kelsey. They walked over to their horses and Chavez mounted his. Kelsey walked her horse over to the group. \"Hey Charlie,\" said Billy. \"Maybe you should stay. You can't shoot worth a piss anyhow. Besides, your girls crying and she'd giving me a headache.\" \"Charlie, you got a wife now,\" said Doc. \"You should stay.\" \"He's right Charlie,\" said Kelsey. \"You don't want to make her a wife and a widow all in one day.\" \"You're staying too,\" said Chavez. Kelsey turned to protest. \"I'm serious. I don't want you there,\" he said. \"Stay here. Manuela's mother will take care of you.\" \"In case you've forgotten,\" she said mounting her horse. \"Ann is staying with the McSween's. I aint going to let her die up there.\" \"Son of a bitch,\" said Doc. \"I completely forgot about that.\" \"So there,\" she said turning her horse towards them. Charlie kissed Manuela and passed her off to her mother. She turned and started crying on her shoulder. Kelsey rolled her eyes as he mounted his horse. \"You're going to regret this, ya know,\" she said. Charlie nodded and followed Billy out of town. \"Aint easy havin' pals,\" said Charlie looking at Billy. They took off out of the city and headed to Lincoln. They were kicking up dust as they headed for the McSween's house. Kelsey was right behind Billy as they reached the back of the house. Everyone dismounted and grabbed their guns and ran inside the house. \"Alex?!\" said Doc as he came in the back door. \"ALEX!?' shouted Billy coming in behind him. \"Ann!? Ann?! Where are you?\" shouted Kelsey following them in. \"What in the name of…\" said Alex from his writing desk. Susan and Ann were standing at the base of the stairs. \"What's going on?\" asked Ann. \"Alex, let's go. Word's out,\" said Billy. \"They're gonna come kill ya.\" \"Damn it Billy. I told you not to come here,\" said Alex. \"I'm not leaving my house.\" \"Alex, if you stay here they're gonna kill you,\" said Billy. \"And then I'm going to have to go around killin' all the guys that killed you. Now that's a lot of killin'.\" \"You heard me, Billy,\" said Alex. \"Alex, maybe we…\" started Susan. Alex turned to her, \"You heard me!\" \"Well we can't just stay here and hope the good Lord saves us from an all-out…\" said Susan. \"Susan, I'm sick. I can't go to Old Mexico,\" said Alex. \"Don't fret Alex,\" said Doc closing up the curtains. \"Trips postponed. They're comin' round the front.\" \"OH, shit,\" said Billy looking out the window. \"That's Peppin.\" Chavez cracked the front door open and looked. \"Chavez, how is it from the east side?\" asked Billy. \"Murphy men,\" he said cocking his gun. \"Charlie!? How's it over by you?! Can we break?\" asked Billy. Charlie stood staring out the window but didn't answer Billy. \"Hey Charlie!? How is it!?\" shouted Billy. \"It...Its…its John Kinney,\" said Charlie. \"I think the word you got was just a trap to get us all in the same place,\" said Alex looking out the window behind Billy. \"My God. This could be a massacre.\" \"So what are we going to do?\" asked Ann. \"Just sit here and hope they let us go!?\" \"She's got a point, Billy,\" said Kelsey. \"There's no way we can win this. Not with that many men out there,\" said Kelsey peeking out the window. \"It's John Kinney,\" said Charlie walking over to Billy. \"Well maybe they just want us,\" said Billy. \"No. They figure they can end the war right here in one fail swoop,\" said Alex. \"And that's just what they're about to do.\" \"It's…its John Kinney!\" said Charlie again. \"Thank you very much Charlie!\" said Doc. \"Jesus.\" \"Oh, God…hangin' for sure now..\" said Charlie sliding to the floor. \"BONNY! We got you up there Kid!\" shouted Sheriff Peppin. \"Take a look at the fire power down here! Y'all come on out, real slow! You up there Bonny!?\" \"Let's have some fun, Doc,\" said Billy. \"YEAH, I'M HERE YOU BASTARD!\" The group outside opened fire on the house. Everyone ducked down away from the windows as bullets started flying through the house. \"What the hell are we doing?\" Ann asked Kelsey. \"We can't die here! We're not from here! I want to go home!\" \"Me, too, but I just don't know how to do that,\" said Kelsey. Bonny started handing out jobs. Ann followed the McSween's up the stairs. Kelsey followed after her. As they settled into their spots he men outside started setting up camp as well. Alex grabbed a blanket and wrapped it around his and Susan's shoulders. Steve was leaned back against the wall snoring. Ann was curled up next to Susan with a blanket of her own. Kelsey was pacing back and forth along the floor while Doc, Billy and Chavez kept a look out. Chavez sighed and set his rifle down. He grabbed a blanket from the open trunk and wrapped it around Kelsey's shoulders. \"Sit down,\" he said. \"And try to get some sleep.\" \"I can't sleep,\" she said from her spot on the floor. Chavez sighed and sat down on the crate behind her. Kelsey wrapped the blanket tighter around her shoulders and laid her head on his knee. The sleep that had eluded her suddenly and swiftly took over as she inhaled his scent. As morning came the group was roused by new sounds outside. \"Chivato,\" said Chavez nodding towards the window. Billy stood up and looked out. The US Army was marching into Lincoln. \"They sent in the troops,\" chuckled Billy. \"Billy, we're good. But this is getting ridiculous,\" said Doc. \"I like these odds,\" chuckled Billy. \"There is something wrong with his head,\" said Kelsey as she stood up. Chavez smirked as he nodded in agreement. As they sat watching Murphy rode up to the scene in a carriage with Yen in the back seat. They were discussing why the army was in Lincoln when Yen jumped out of the carriage and ran for the house. Murphy started yelling for her. \"YEN!\" shouted Doc as she ran through the fence. Two soldiers ran after her at Murphy's urging. When they got close to her Doc fired on them making them fall back behind the barrier. \"Cover me,\" he said heading for the stairs. As Doc was coming up the stairs the army started firing on the house. Kelsey and Ann ducked down under the blanket to shield them from flying glass. \"Billy…please…I gotta go,\" said Charlie. \"I got a wife. She's a little Mexican gal…please…\" \"Charlie! If you don't stand up and start whooping some ass you aint never gonna see her again!\" shouted Billy from his crouching spot. \"Now, come on Charlie!\" Steve turned to look out the window when he heard voices. \"They lit it, boys. They lit the house.\" \"MR. BONNY! MR. MCSWEEN!\" shouted the army Colonel. \"This is Colonel Nathan Dudley out of Fort Stanton! Come on out, with your hands high!\" \"With your hands high…\" chuckled Billy. \"Okay. I better reason with him. Hey, Colonel Shithead! You can kiss my ass!\" laughed Billy. \"Goddamn it, Billy!\" yelled Alex. \"You get President Hayes down here, then we'll come out!\" he shouted out the window. \"We'll see how they like that one.\" The army opened fire on the house again. Kelsey grabbed her gun and started to point it at Billy when Chavez stopped her. She frowned but put the gun away. Charlie started yelling as he loaded his gun. \"Hey, Kinney! You bastard!\" he shouted. \"I'm gonna shoot your ass! You shitdog! Maniac!\" \"Yeah, Charlie!\" whispered Billy. Charlie stooped up and unloaded his rifle on the men on the ground, shouting the whole time. \"Yeah! Charlie! Yeah!\" shouted Steve as Charlie picked up the other rifle. \"YEAH CHARLIE!\" shouted Billy. \"Yeah!\" shouted Charlie and Steve. \"Yeah Charlie!\" shouted Billy as he stood up to shoot out the window. \"We're going to die because of his stupidity,\" said Ann looking at Kelsey. \"That we are,\" said Kelsey. \"Alex! Get Susan and the girls outta here!\" shouted Doc. Alex grabbed Susan and forced her away from the trunk she was digging in. Once he got her to the door he waved his handkerchief. \"THERE'S A WOMAN COMIN' OUT!\" he shouted. \"LET MY WIFE COME OUT!\" \"Hold your fire, there's a lady comin' out,\" said Murphy. \"HOLD YOUR FIRE!\" shouted the colonel. \"Go, go, go!\" shouted Alex as he pushed her out the door. \"Ann! You're next!\" Ann stood up and practically ran out the door and down the stairs behind Susan. \"Kelsey! Come on!\" shouted Alex. Kelsey just stayed put with her arms crossed over her chest. \"Kelsey!\" shouted Doc. Alex turned and grabbed her arm and pulled her from the crate she was sitting on. As he neared the door he shoved her out and pulled it to behind her. Kelsey turned and followed Susan and Ann down the stairs and across the yard. She linked arms with Ann as they reached the Colonel shortly after Susan. Murphy made a lewd comment about Susan. Susan smacked the Colonel and tried to attack him. Kelsey smiled as the officers pulled her off of him. \"You need to keep her under control,\" said Dudley. \"She's her own woman,\" said Kelsey as Ann followed them across the street. \"And I think she could've hit you harder, but that's just me,\" she said with a glare as she walked across the street to join her friend. \"Where's Chavez!?\" shouted Steve. \"I don't know!\" replied Doc. \"He-he must've skinned out!\" said Charlie as he reloaded his gun. \"I knew it! That dirty Mexican gone!\" shouted Steve as he started kicking the trunks sitting on the ground. \"I knew we should never trust him! We're gonna die and he's, he's out there doin' it with his horse!\" Steve continued on with his rant and kicked out one of the windows. They continued to toss things out of the attic in hopes of saving them. Kelsey was standing on the porch of John's store as she watched books and trunks get tossed out the window. A blue trunk came tumbling out the window and landed on the ground. As it settled Steve stepped out the side door and opened fire on the men. Billy suddenly jumped from the trunk and started shooting. Kelsey had a smile on her face as she ducked down behind the rail. Doc came out behind him with Yen. He fired as he ran across the yard telling her to run. Charlie came out behind him and started unloading his rifle. As Steve stepped out again Chavez came riding up with all their horses. \"Billy!\" shouted Chavez. Billy shouted as a bullet hit him in the shoulder. Charlie turned to see John Kinney smiling. He reloaded his gun as he turned to the bounty hunter. \"JOHN KINNEY, YOU BASTARD! IT'S YOU AND I!\" shouted Charlie as he cocked his gun. Kinney aimed his gun and fired at Charlie. As Charlie fell to the ground he continued shooting, ultimately killing Kinney before he died. Doc was shot in the shoulder as he rode over to pull Yen up onto the horse. Billy was shot a few more times as he climbed up on his horse. Steve helped Chavez back up on his horse. Kelsey hugged her friend before she ran out into the street and met the horse. He slowed down long enough for her to pull herself up onto the horse before they took off to the edge of town following Doc. Steve was shot four times before he fell to the ground. \"Wait! DUDLEY! Get that son of a bitch!\" shouted Murphy running down the street. \"RUN BOY!\" shouted Alex as Billy rode out of sight. As they reached the city limits of Lincoln Billy turned around and headed back. \"Where is he going?!\" shouted Kelsey as they all stopped to watch. Billy rounded the corner and stopped his horse. He cocked his gone as he looked down the street at Murphy. \"Reap it Murphy, you son of a bitch!\" he shouted aiming his gun. \"Reap it!\" he said firing. The bullet hit Murphy in the head, killing him instantly. Billy turned his horse around and headed for the city limits as fast as he could. The group kicked their horses as well and took off after him. Chavez and Kelsey had gotten as far as the Juarez village when they stopped for the night. She slid off the horse and stretched her legs while he went to procure a room for them. As she wandered around the town she saw a familiar face come into view. It was Ann. She ran over to her friend with a smile on her face. \"How did you get here?\" asked Kelsey. \"I took off after you left,\" said Ann. \"I was maybe two or three miles behind you the whole time. I just couldn't catch up.\" Kelsey hugged her friend again as the wind started to kick up around them. \"No!\" shouted Kelsey. \"What?\" asked Ann looking around. \"I think we're about to go home!\" shouted Kelsey trying to breath in the dust storm. \"Finally!\" smiled Ann. \"No! Where's Chavez!\" said Kelsey looking around frantically. She ran to the hotel and couldn't find him. The owner was closing up all the windows. She grabbed scrap of paper and penned a quick good bye before the door flew open sending dust and papers everywhere. She handed the paper to the owner before she ran from the building. When she reached Ann the dirt cloud swelled up around them before settling down again. The girls were gone. Advices from Lincoln report that Jose Chavez y Chavez moved to California where he changed his name and took work on a fruit ranch. Josiah \"Doc\" Scurlock was reported to have left the west for the east, taking with him his celestial bride, her mother and fourteen brothers and sisters. Susan McSween went on to see her husband's and John Tunstall's dreams into fruition by becoming one of the most prominent cattle women of all time. Governor Axtell was forced to resign by President Rutherford B. Hayes. Both the Murphy-Dolan faction and the Santa Fe Ring collapsed. William H. Bonny, also known as Billy the Kid, continued to ride, never leaving New Mexico. He was caught in Fort Sumner by the sheriff Pat Garret and killed. Sources report that he was unarmed and shot in the dark. He was buried with Charlie Bodwre in Fort Sumner. Advices report that sometime later an unidentified person snuck into the graveyard and chiseled an inscription. The epitaph read only one word: Pals. \"They're waking up!\" shouted someone. Kelsey furrowed her brows against the sudden onslaught of noise. She coughed as she tried to sit up, but found it difficult. \"Hold on miss,\" said the voice again. After a moment she was able to sit up properly and breathe a little better. When she opened her eyes again she was sitting on a sidewalk in the middle of the city. She looked around to take in her surrounding when she realized she was only a block from the dress shop. She grabbed her head as she took in deep breaths. \"What happened?\" she asked. \"Where is Ann? Is she okay?\" \"She's fine,\" said a familiar voice. It was Evelynn. \"It looks like you two laced your dresses too tight and passed out on the side of the road. Good thing I was coming to check to see if you'd been by.\" \"What? What time is it? What day is it?!\" said Kelsey. \"April 15,\" said Kelsey. \"And it's about two in the afternoon. Are you feeling okay? Maybe you should go to the hospital.\" \"I'm fine. I just need to go home,\" said Kelsey standing up. \"I insist that you at least get check out by my associate. You were unconscious for quite some time,\" said the voice. Kelsey turned to see who was talking to her. It was an EMT. She sighed and nodded as she was led to the ambulance. Ann was sitting on the bed inside the truck having her vitals checked. She smiled weakly at her friend. \"Do you remember…\" started Kelsey. \"Or was I going crazy?\" Ann laughed. \"I don't know. Tell me how your side is.\" Kelsey ran her hand over her side. Even through her dress she could feel a fresh scar where she'd been shot. She smiled as the EMT checked her blood pressure. No one would believe them, but she really didn't care. \"Let's go home!\" said Ann jumping from the truck. \"I want to watch a movie.\" \"Yeah, me too,\" laughed Kelsey as they grabbed a change of clothes before heading home.

They had their rightful place in NHL, and competed equally against other big towns' widely supported hockey teams. They were normal in the world of the adored sportsmen, a good team amongst others, with good players amongst others. It was a cold day of December, and the wind blew hard around the town's ice rink. Inside it, the team was preparing for a normal day's practise, warming up on the ice, skating around the rink randomly. A handful of supporters sat on the first rows, chatting with each other about the last game. Mike Metcalf, the coach, made everybody gather around him and told them the instructions. One more player jumped onto the ice, helmet under his elbow, and joined the group. \"Guys, this is Pete Mitchell, that most of you know as Maverick\", said Metcalf. Mitchell's jersey, indeed, showed this name. He had been for long the \"second Mitchell\" of his former team, and to avoid any confusion, his nickname was printed on his jersey instead of his actual surname. \"Cortell's out, so Mitchell's going to play with us until he gets back – which is nothing but sure, I've been visiting the guy this morning, he's got a hell of a trauma. Kept going on about losing the edge and holding on too tight or something. Anyway, Mitchell's gonna take his place in first line, right winger. Maverick, you have Heatherly as left winger and Kazansky as center. Gonna work on your chemistry today, gotta beat the hell out of the Migs on Saturday. And if anyone's gonna do that, it's you three guys.\" The three guys in question nodded. Maverick felt the helmeted look of all his new teammates on him; he felt their suspicion. Was he as good as Cortell, a.k.a the Cougar? Was he going to live up to their expectations? One of them was looking more intensely at him. He was tall and, for what he could see through the helmet's grid, blond and not so welcoming. On his jersey was the letter \"C\" for Captain. As the coach clapped for the practise to start, the blond cast a last hard look on Maverick and turned around, revealing the number 4 surmounted by his surname: Kazansky. The training went quite well; Kazansky's team, in which Maverick was, won by 3-1, two of the goals having been scored by Mitchell and the last by the team's captain. They then trained passes and long shots, and were dismissed. \"Mitchell\", Kazansky called once they reached the locker room. The black-haired player turned around to face him. \"You play solo. I don't like that.\" Maverick raised his eyebrows, looking at Kazansky in the eye, shook his head with a slight smile and sat down on the bank. \"I score, that's what matters.\" \"Won't work this way on Saturday. The Migs are good. Don't underestimate them.\" Maverick started to undo his skates' laces. \"Do you hear me, Mitchell?\" \"I'm not deaf, Kazansky.\" \"Then listen to me. Don't – play – solo\", he said, marking every word. \"I'll try my best\", Maverick replied, shrugging. \"But that's how I play. Your managers, they hired me for this, for my game.\" Kazansky leaned down so that his face was really close to Maverick's. \"You're arrogant, and you're selfish. You want all the glory to yourself. On Saturday, if we miss even one goal because of your stupid game, you're out. I'll see to it myself.\" \"Iceman!\" another player called. Kazansky straightened himself and looked around. \"Beer with us?\" \"So that's what they call you?\" Maverick was laughing. \"Iceman, huh? King of the rink, or something?\" Kazansky shot him a dark look. \"I'm the captain here, Mitchell. I'm the one who gets to think . I don't let the opponent get to me, as I won't let your mistakes ruin our game.\"[Chapter 2] They were 15 minutes into the game when the Migs scored the first goal. Their supporters, stacked in a corner of the rink as they were the guest team's, roared with joy while their players gathered into the usual congratulation hug. Metcalf shouted some orders, and the first line jumped on the ice, ready to fight, to try and even the score before the end of the first 20 minutes. Kazansky won the faceoff, passed to Maverick who raced towards the Migs' goal; Maverick heard Kazansky call the puck back, glanced at him, decided he was in better posture, shot, and missed. A Mig intercepted the puck. Mitchell was circling the goal to get back to their defensive side when he got violently projected against the board, his back getting the most of the impact, his head following closely; the \"WHAM\" resonated in his ears as he fell down with his checker, letting go of his cross just in time to put his arms behind him and absorb some of the second shock. He tried to inhale but his lungs seemed closed. The referee blew his whistle, thinking of a foul; he then realized the two were on the same team, and looked rather confused. Heatherly was skating towards the mess of the two bodies. When he was close enough, he shouted over the crowd: \"What the fuck, Ice?!\" Maverick was breathing again. He looked around, made out the crowd and various players zooming towards them; he didn't understand what had just happened. Kazansky was trying to get up, which he finally managed to do after three attempts. He skated away uncertainly, but was stopped by an angry Heatherly. \"What is wrong with you, Kazansky?\", the latter was shouting. \"What are you trying to do?\" \"MITCHELL! KAZANSKY!\", Metcalf called from the bank. Maverick had gotten up with the help of the Migs' goaltender and skated shakily towards the bank. \"Locker room, now\", said the coach, his features all messed up with anger. A doctor followed Maverick as he entered the locker room and sat down heavily. The doctor removed his helmet and started checking his pupils for signs of internal damage. Kazansky entered the room with Metcalf on his heels. The coach looked at Maverick briefly, and then started shouting at Ice. \"What on earth was that about, Kazansky? Do you realized that you've just jeopardized the whole game, and with that our whole season? This is a critical game, in case I haven't made it clear enough. What are you trying to do?!\" Kazansky took off his helmet and threw it to the ground. \"I warned him!\", he shouted back, pointing an aggressive finger at Maverick. \"I warned him that playing solo wouldn't work against them. He's jeopardizing the season, not me!\" \"What, and you just decided to… take him out?\", Metcalf shouted louder. \"Someone had to do it, and you weren't going to! Just because you played with his father! He's not good for us, Mike! He's dangerous!\" Metcalf seemed to think for an instant, and then spoke in an even tone: \"Well, doesn't matter now, does it? You're both out. Now–\" \"What do you mean we're both out?\" Iceman exploded. \"Did you think I was going to let you go on the ice again after what you've done? You're the danger here, Kazansky! You're out because I say so!\" Kazansky looked revolted. Metcalf continued calmly: \"Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go back out there and try to motivate a bunch of shaken players to win this fucking game with half of their first line missing.\"[Chapter 3] \"You'll be okay\", the doctor said to Maverick. \"You're quite shook up, but nothing serious. You can't go back to today's game though, I'm afraid. Need to rest.\" Maverick thanked him distractedly, his eyes on Iceman, who was kicking random things in a corner of the room. The doctor left, leaving the two alone. Iceman turned around, not looking at Maverick, though, but at some spot over him. \"I warned you\", he said, his voice imperceptibly shaky. Maverick just kept staring at him, quiet. \"I had to do this.\" Silence. \"For the team.\" Silence. And then Ice exclaimed: \"Won't you say something?!\" \"Won't you tell me what you really did this for?\" Ice looked at him, puzzled. \"I told you.\" \"You told me nothing.\" \"Your ego is hurt because I stopped your stupid game.\" \"Let's leave my ego out of this.\" \"I don't think so. Your ego is what it's all about.\" \"Oh, really?\", Maverick replied, tilting his head to the side. \"See, I don't think that's true, Kazansky. I think the problem is way bigger than that.\" \"What do you mean?\", Iceman asked, defiant. Maverick stood up and walked towards him, stopping only when the tip of their ice skates were an inch from each other. \"I mean that there's a lot more to this than my solo style. I think you're afraid, Kazansky. You don't like my presence here because it's disrupting your quiet little world.\" These words seemed to confuse him even more. He frowned at Maverick, and looked away. \"What's your point?\" \"I got it, Kazansky. You think I didn't notice the way you were looking at me after the practices, but I did. You don't want me in your world because you're feeling something for me, and you think you shouldn't.\" Iceman's eyes went back to Maverick. He stared at him for a while; frowned again; gulped. \"I…\", he hesitated. \"It's alright. I get it. Look, I didn't want to confront you with that because, obviously, you think it's wrong. But tonight, you didn't give me a choice. You tried to injure me so I would be out for a few games, maybe even the whole season and you wouldn't have to see me anymore.\" Maverick laughed sarcastically. \"Well, you didn't put enough heart in it.\" Iceman shook his head and stared at his feet. When he looked at Maverick again, his eyes were a bit watery. \"I'm sorry\", he whispered. \"I didn't mean to hurt you – well, I guess I did, but – I don't know. It was so stupid. I'm just… I'm lost, Maverick.\" Maverick lay a friendly hand on his shoulder. \"Hey, it's okay. Relax. I get it. Been there before.\" Ice raised an eyebrow, looking suspicious. \"Yeah?\" \"Yeah. It was a few years ago, in a former team of mine. Kinda fell for the goaltender's badassery\", he let out with a laugh. A shy smile formed on Iceman's lips. \"Anyway\", Maverick continued, serious again. \"We're not here to discuss that. But I can say for sure that, back then, I was a lot better at dealing with it than you are right now.\" Ice's smile faded, he dropped his head. \"I guess. How… how did you deal with it?\" \"Well, I dealt with it by not making a big deal out of it. I accepted it. Embraced it. Everything you didn't do.\" \"It was stupid. I'm sorry\", Iceman mumbled, looking down again. \"You're not stupid, Kazansky. Hey, look at me.\" Ice obeyed. \"You don't have to feel guilty or embarrassed about what you feel. Now, everyone doesn't have to know if you don't want to. Me, I don't care, people already know that I'm not limited to girls.\" Iceman frowned, not sure he understood what Maverick was saying. \"What do you mean?\" \"What do you think I mean, Kazansky?\" Maverick teased with a crooked smile. \"Do you…\", Iceman hesitated, not daring to even think it. \"Do I like the way you're looking at me when I come out of the shower?\" The blond player blushed, but the corners of his lips raised. \"Yeah, I do, you lumpish brute. I also happen to watch you, but I'm a tiny bit more discreet and subtle.\" This time, Iceman smiled full-heartedly. \"It's really okay, then?\" \"What, this whole thing? Well, if we let aside the fact that you almost killed me, I guess it is.\" They laughed, then just looked at each other intensely. Iceman's hand grabbed Maverick's neck and gently pulled his head to his. Their lips didn't have time to touch; the end of the first period rang loudly, and the ceiling of the locker room shook with the heavy steps of the supporters. The team was going to be there any second. Iceman let go of Maverick, giving him a smile that said \"Sorry. Later.\" Maverick nodded, and smiled back.[Chapter 4] The game was in full swing when Iceman scored the third goal. They gathered into the celebration group hug as the speaker's voice resonated in the roaring rink: \"Aaand this is the third goal from the Tomcaaats! Scored by number 14, Tom–\" \"KAZANSKY!\", the public completed. \"With an assist from number 4, Pete–\" \"MITCHELL!\" \"Time: 47 minutes and 3 seconds.\" They changed lines; Maverick and Iceman sat on the bank next to the others, who punched them in the shoulder joyfully. They were 13 minutes away from winning this game and passing first in the season ranking. Maverick leaned to Iceman and said, just loud enough so no one but he could hear: \"Kazansky, this is terrible situation that we're in. There's 13 minutes left until the end of the game.\" A crooked smile formed on Iceman's lips. \"And then there's the player of the game award.\" \"And it's going to be you, so you'll have to do the stupid rink tours for the supporters.\" \"And then there's the locker room congratulations and debriefing.\" \"Which means we're at least 30 minutes away from being alone.\" \"I'm thinking of the small classroom on third floor\". \"Definitely.\" \"That is if no interviewer gets in our way.\" The coach Metcalf patted them in the back, meaning they were next to go on the ice. 8 minutes left. The referee blew his whistle, the five players headed towards the bank; the first line jumped in. \"Your faceoff\", Iceman shouted to Maverick. Maverick nodded. He positioned himself, concentrated on the puck in the referee's hands; it was thrown on the ice, and with a skilful move of the cross, Maverick passed it to Heatherly behind him. They skated at full speed to the opponent's zone, the puck zooming between them, the other team vainly trying to intercept. Maverick was in front of the goaltender; he couldn't get a clear shot. He passed the puck to Merlin behind the goal, who got checked by an opponent; they were stuck with the puck between their feet. Maverick and a player of the opposite team came in for help. One of the opponent could get away with the precious cylindrical thing. Maverick was about to chase him when he was checked against the board – gently. It was Ice. \"Not sorry\", he said. \"This time I don't want you dead… I just want you.\" He smiled, and skated away. Maverick followed as quickly as he could, shaking his head. Ice wouldn't get away with this so easily. ","Summary":" The Tomcats was an American big town's hockey team, widely supported by most of its citizens.

Another day of hard work and scheming wasted because of the Spy Kids. He felt his brain pulse in irritation and pain, if he had a head, he would call it a headache. He placed a robotic hand over his some and groaned. \"What I wouldn't give to have those kids eradicated!\" He huffed as he stomped through the hallways of his evil lair. The grunts were smart enough to stay out of his way. Most of them sticking to the walls and avoiding any sort of eye contact with him. Any misstep and they would be electrocuted with his cane. But all Golden Brain wanted was to hide in his quarters and wallow in his growing hatred of the Spy Kids. He had wasted too much of his time, his grunts, weapons, and money, all to destroy them. Yet, he failed. Again. The moment he entered his private lair, he collapsed on his purple couch. A nap would help alleviate his \"brain-ache\". He blinked a few times, turned, and turned again. He let out another groan as he clutched at his dome. He couldn't sleep. He couldn't relax. Not while he kept thinking about the spies. He lifted his cane, ready to zap himself with it until he heard a voice calling for him. \"Mr. Brain! Oh Mr. Brain!\" The voice sang out. Golden Brain's eyes narrowed in annoyance as he lifted himself up from the couch. He was tempted to go and hide but it was too late once the red-head walked in. \"Oh there you are! I was looking for you everywhere!\" \"Of course, Therese and here I am.\" Golden Brain started in a cold tone. \"Just tell me what you need from me and go, perhaps quickly.\" Therese was red-haired young women, who was as brilliant as him. She was dedicated to her job and always does her work without complaining, unlike the slackers he had in his army. But, Therese was also an excited, overly-energetic and naive young women. Her excitement itself was enough to drain him. He was lucky to have her in his nefarious schemes even though she didn't know that herself. But, keeping the truth from her was much more stressful. \"Well, I couldn't help but notice you are in a bad mood. Did the meeting with the algae collectors not go as plan?\" Golden Brain didn't have a meeting with algae collectors, it was a front to keep Therese in the dark about his secret agenda. He actually went to talk to new recruits and make unsavory deals. \"The collectors pulled out from my deal, they were not interested.\" He answered swiftly making her eyes widen in concern. \"Oh well, I'm sorry Mr. Brain.\" She said softly. \"T-they're a bunch of dummies to not join the company.\" \"Ugh. More like idiotic neanderthals.\" He muttered. He rubbed the top of his dome, feeling his brain pulse again. \"And now I have this blasted headache because of them.\" \"Oh I heard taking a nap might help!\" \"Yes.\" He said in a long droll. \"Which is what I was planning on doing but I can't seem to relax so if you don't mind-!\" \"To help you relax? Sure!\" Therese said in a large smile and hopped onto the couch beside him. He shook his hands at her. \"No, no, no, no, I don't need any help, I just want to be alo-ack!\" Therese quickly grabbed his wrist and pulled him down towards her, much to his protest, the back of his head was forced down against her lap. He froze up when Therese smiled at him. \"My mom used to do this to me when I was a kid. I use to have terrible migraines but my mom had this trick and it put me right to sleep!\" \"Yes, But Therese I don't think I am entirely comfortable with this so I'm just going to get up and-\" he lifted himself up only for her to grab his shoulders and put him right back down. \"Oh don't be silly, Mr. Brain!\" She said while she patted his glass dome. \"I'm happy to help!\" \"Oh no.\" He muttered, as he sunk into himself in slight embarrassment. He could only pray that none of his henchmen's walk in on them. He cleared his throat and placed his hands over his stomach. \"A-alright. What do you plan on doing?\" \"Okay! First, close your eyes.\" He was reluctant at first but seeing her patiently waiting for him with her gentle smile, made him finally close them. \"Now what?\" He asked, tapping his fingers against each other. He suddenly felt her small hand grab his left one. He jerked from the sudden touch but she immediately patted his head again. \"You need to relax, Mr. Brain...you need to breathe calmly.\" He let out a grunt. It was hard for him to relax since she was now holding his hand like a child. He breathed out slowly, trying to make his breathing steady. He felt her thumb stroking the top of his hand while her fingers slowly wrapped into his own. If he had skin, it would have been red. She then started to hum. It was no song in particular. Not one he recognized. He suspected it came from her mother. It was a soft tune and it slowly began to have an effect on him. He felt his body become more heavy. His eyes began to flicker and he saw Therese had stopped humming. She slowly shifted, trying to silently slide her way out. He grabbed onto her hand, giving it a squeeze, making her stop from moving away from him. He closed his eyes, falling into a deep sleep while his hand clutched her own. Golden Brain slowly opened his eyes. His headache completely gone. When he looked up, he saw Therese sleeping peacefully against the back of his couch. Her head slightly down against her shoulder. He slowly sat up, careful not to wake her. He noticed how her hand was still holding his own. His eyes soften when he saw it. It was a shame when he had to let go of her. He got up from the couch and looked at his wrist watch. He had slept for more than an hour. He glanced back at Therese, who was still sleeping. He looked around his lair, making sure no one was around as he took off his yellow suit jacket. He gently grabbed Therese's shoulder and head, laying her down on the couch. He draped his jacket over her and saw her smile in her sleep. He chuckled softly before leaving her to continue his work.[Chapter 2] Golden Brain was strolling in his secret compound when his top general cane running up to him. Golden Brain's brow arched when the general stopped in front of him. Golden Brain rolled his eyes at his general who was struggling to catch his breath. \"Sir! W-we have-! A bit!...of a-! Problem!\" His general managed to pant out. Golden Brain brought his cane up to his chest, grabbing it with both hands. \"Problem? What type of problem?\" He demanded with a hint of irritance. \"With what?\" \"It is the weapon you wanted.\" \"What?\" The grip on his cane tighten in growing anger. \"I thought I told you I didn't want any drawbacks. I sent clear instructions!\" The general sunk in terror. \"It wasn't my fault! It was Therese!\" \"Therese?\" Golden Brain blinked and released his powerful grip off of his cane. \"How? All she ever does is make the weapons better!\" \"S-she told me that she can't figure out how to make it work!\" \"Oh please, how much trouble can it be? I seen her fix and improve countless weapons before...ah, I better go check on her. Just go and train the grunts, will you?\" He said, shooing his general away. Golden Brain swiftly made his way down the hall to the inventions room. It was a large room that held most of their destructive products and office supplies. He saw Therese with half of her body into a hatch of a giant machine. She was kicking her legs, as if she was struggling to get out. Golden Brain rushed to her side. \"Therese! Are you alright?\" He asked as he peeked inside of the hatch. He saw that her dress was stained in black oil, completely ruining the fabric. Her face was covered in black and her hair was a mess. \"I uh! Just need a little help, please!\" She yelled out. Golden Brain set his cane down and grabbed her waist with both of his hands. With one pull, she was out of the hatch. \"Thanks, Mr. Brain…\" Therese muttered. It was a different tone than what he was used to. She was usually so energetic and now she looked like a sad kitten. \"Therese, what's wrong?\" He asked gently. \"I never seen you so flustered…\" Therese bit her lower lip and rubbed her elbow. \"It's just…\" she let out a sigh. \"I can't fix the wheatgrass extractor or the \"subatomic particle ray\" as you call it.\" Golden Brain chuckled nervously as he pulled at his collar. \"W-what's wrong with it?\" \"I can't turn it on. Something is off with the machine which was why I was looking inside of it. But now...I don't know.\" She kicked at the ground and crossed her arms. \"I just can't figure it out! I tried everything!' She exclaimed and began to pace the floors as she gave him a full list. \"I check the fuel gauge, the power source, the wiring and even the tubing!\" She leaned against the metal machine, holding a frown. \"And I still can't figure it out. I'm sorry, Mr. Brain.\" She said. \"W-what are you apologizing for? It's just a slight hiccup.\" \"But its not!\" She argued. \"I know you expect a lot from me and I really want to fix the machine but..I'm not as brilliant as you.\" She said in a small voice. Golden Brain was surprised. One being that she called him brilliant, which he was, but in how she compared herself to him. He could tell she had been working on the machine for more than an hour, possible even a few. She could have gotten the grunts to look at it but she didn't. She always wanted to do it herself. She wanted to get all of his machine in great, working order. She gave herself that responsibility. Now, when he stared at her, all he saw was her disappointment in herself. Golden Brain took a step towards her and put a gentle hand on her shoulder. \"Miss Therese.\" He began. She looked up at him, still holding her frown. \"You are the most brilliant person I had ever known.\" Her eyes widen from his words and he saw her frown beginning to lift up. \"Oh. You are just trying to be nice.\" She replied. \"No, no, I'm serious.\" He said as he tilted his head at her. \"You are so brilliant, well, I think...you're even smarter than I am.\" \"What?\" \"Please, don't let me repeat that. It was hard the first time. But it's true.\" He said as he lifted her chin up. \"And...if you are having trouble, you can ask for my help.\" \"No! I can't do that, you are so busy with running the company I can't possibly ask you to-!\" He grabbed her shoulders again, making her face him again. \"Therese, you can come to me. I won't turn you away.\" She sniffed and turned her head away. Her cheeks turning into a darker shade of pink. He then noticed he was still holding her. He quickly let go and placed his hands down to his side. \"I...What kind of boss would I be if I didn't help my most promising employee?\" She giggled at his response which made his eyes lit up, if he had a mouth, he would have been smiling alongside her. \"Then, Mr. Brain...Can you please help me?\" She asked. Golden Brain chuckled and rolled up his sleeves. \"But of course! Let's see if we can find the problem together, shall we?\" ","Summary":" Golden Brain felt deflated.

She and her brother Juni Cortez were on their way to their mission debriefing. Their father, Gregorio Cortez, had called them earlier this afternoon. -Flashback Carmen Cortez was sitting on her bed reading Mary-Kate and Ashley, A New-York Minute. Tick, Tick, Tick. That's all I can hear. A clock ticking, quietly at first, then - \"You have an unread message. Would you like to view it?\" said the T.V. Carmen looked up from her book. 'It was just getting good!' she thought to herself. \"Yes,\" she said. \"To Carmen and Juni Cortez,\" replied the T.V. \"Pause,\" said Carmen, as the T.V obeyed. \"JUNI!\" \"WHAT?\" Juni shouted back. \"COME HERE!\" yelled Carmen. \"Stop shouting kids,\" Ingrid, their mother, called. \"WE'RE NOT KIDS,\" they said in unison, as Juni entered the room. \"Continue,\" Carmen said to the T.V. \"Hello children,\" said the father, Gergorio. \"Hi dad,\" they said. \"You are requested in the mission briefing room as soon as possible. It is very urgent. Do you accept?\" Carmen and Juni looked at each other for a moment. \"We accept,\" they said. \"Good, see you there agents,\" replied their father. -End of Flashback They continued walking in silence until they reached the mission debriefing room. \"State your name,\" said the identifying machine. \"Carmen Elizabeth Juanita Costa-Brava Cortez,\" said Carmen. \"Confirmed,\" replied the machine \"State your name.\" \"Junito Rocket Racer Rebel Cortez,\" said Juni. \"Confirmed, you may enter,\" said the machine. The doors opened and they stepped in. Inside the room they found four chairs, two had been claimed to none other than Gary and Gerti Giggles. \"Hey guys,\" said Carmen. Gary and Gerti's head spun to look at them. \"Oh, hi Carmen, Juni,\" replied Gerti. \"Hey,\" Juni said back. \"Wow Carmen, you look great,\" Gary said, in a stunned voice. \"She always looks great,\" Juni whispered to Gerti, who laugh. \"Please take a seat,\" said Gergorio Cortez. Juni sat down, next to him Gerti, then Gary and last Carmen. \"Agents, I would like to introduce you to our newest agent Nico Hunter. He will accompany you on your mission. Now, you all must be wandering why you are here,\" said Gergorio. \"It has come to our attention that a certain gadget, disguised as a small coin,has been stolen. There is a button on this coin, a tiny one, and when pressed, the coin will open up and a small disc will be inside. This disc holds valuable and powerful information. If it gets into the wrong hands, it could end the world,\" he paused before saying \"It is your job to retrieve this disc and safely bring it back here. Do you accept agents?\" There were a few nods. \"Good, you start tomorrow,\" said Gregorio. All five agents left the room. \"So, your Nico huh,\" announced Carmen. \"Yeah, that's me,\" said Nico. \"Cool, I'm Carmen, this is my brother Juni and these are our friends Gary and Gerti,\" replied Carmen, pointing to each one in turn. \"Carmen huh, that's a beautiful name... like you,\" declared Nico. Carmen blushed, Juni rolled his eyes but Gary was seething with anger. Luckily Gerti saw this and put her hand on his arm to calm him down. \"Carmen? Can we speak privately ,\" asked Gary looking at Nico when he said privately. \"Sure,\" answered Carmen \"Let's talk in my office.\" Carmen's office was fairly large. Her desk was in front of the window and had two chairs in front of it. She had a cabinet to the right of her desk and a couch on the other side of her room. They both plonked down on the couch before Gary said, \"It's about Nico, he-\" Gary tried to say. \"Is someone jealous?\" Carmen teased. \"Is Gawy jealows because he doesn't have Carmwen all to himwself anymwore.\" \"NO!\" Gary objected. \"Then what is it?\" Carmen tormented. \"It's, uh, just... that... um, \" Gary stuttered \"Urgh! Never mind.\" \"If that's all,\" Carmen said \"Then-\" \"NO! Um, I was wondering if you wanted to come to my place today. You know, just hang out,\" asked Gary. \"Sure, that would be nice. I'll ask my parents,\" agreed Carmen \"We can meet up at 3 today.\" \"'K,\" replied Gary \"See you then.\" \"'K, bye,\" spoke Carmen. With that they walked out of the room to do their jobs. Hey Guys!

Um, I was wondering if you wanted to come to my place today. You know, just hang out,\" asked Gary. \"Sure, that would be nice. I'll ask my parents,\" agreed Carmen \"We can meet up at 3 today.\" \"'K,\" replied Gary \"See you then.\" \"'K, bye,\" spoke Carmen. With that they walked out of the room to do their jobs. \"Urgh!\" Gary thought \"That was so embarrassing!\" Gary had just walked out of Carmen Cortez's office after their private talk. It didn't go well. Gary thought back to their conversation. \"It's about Nico, he-\" Gary tried to say. \"Is someone jealous?\" Carmen teased. \"Is Gawy jealows because he doesn't have Carmwen all to himwself anymwore.\" \"NO!\" Gary objected. \"Then what is it?\" Carmen tormented. \"It's, uh, just... that... um, \" Gary stuttered \"Urgh!

Now Carmen probably thinks I'm a jealous, overprotective friend. Probably no point in trying to get any further in our relationship.\" mumbled Gary. One of Gary's biggest secrets was that he had a HUGE crush on Carmen. They may be their rivals, but he couldn't help but notice how her body curved in all the right places and how she talks and moves and how kind, sweet and caring she was. They had become good friends after the toymaker incident. \"I'd better check all my gear for tomorrow's mission,\" remembered Gary. \"I've got half an hour before lunch. Where I'll see Carmen...and Nico.\" Carmen just walked out of her office. \"I wonder what's up with Gary?\" Carmen thought \"Well the best person to ask is Gerti I suppose.\" As Carmen made her way over to Gerti's office, she thought about Gary. One of Carmen's biggest secrets was that she had a GIANT crush on Gary. He wasn't the nicest or kindest but he was a bad boy. Carmen had a thing for bad boys. She thought back to the time of the Ukata assignment. After they had stopped Donnagon and retrieved the Transmooker Device, Gary had been suspended. They had a little chat and then he had walked away with 'Bad Boy' across his sunglasses. \"Huh...,\" Carmen sighed \"Those were the days.\" When she arrived at Gerti's office she knocked on the door. \"Who is it?\" asked Gerti. \"It's me, Carmen,\" replied Carmen. Carmen stepped in and was greeted by a cheery voice. \"Hey! What brings you here?\" \"Well, it's about Gary. Is there something that happened?\" asked Carmen. \"Mmmmm, no, not that I can remember. Why?\" \"Well, he was acting kinda strange when we were talking,\" replied Carmen. \"I'll ask him about it if that will help,\" \"Sure. Thanks Gerti,\" said Carmen as she walked out of the office. \"No problem,\" Carmen heard Gerti say. \"Hmmmm. Ten minutes till lunch,\" Carmen said to herself. \"I'll go check my gear for tomorrow.\" As Carmen made her way to the room where all the gear is, she thought about the assignment. \"I wonder who stole it? What information does it contain? How can a small disc be used to destroy the world?\" all these questions flooded through her head. With those questions still in her head, she walked to the gear room the arrange her gear. Hey Guys! Here's the next chapter. Sorry it took so long to update.

It all started on a normal school day when I was walking with my best friend Victor Andrews. \" Nothing exciting ever happens around here.\" I said. \"Everything is too predictable. \" Oh, please don't say you're going to do that thing all those movies, shows, and books do when they a character says that.\" Victor said \"What do you mean?\" \"You know, when the character says that, they then show whoever they are with exactly what's going to happen before it does.\" I did do it, mostly just to annoy him, and partly because I was going to anyway before he said that. But let'sjust skip that scene here, since you know how that works \"So, are you trying to make something exciting happen by saying that?\" Victor asked.\" Because that only happens in movies, shows, and books.\" \" You never know.\" \"What I do know is that it seems like we've been walking in the halls for a long time.\" \" Well, the bell's going to ring right about now.\" RING \"Stop doing that.\" \"Sorry, couldn't resist one more.\" When I got home that afternoon after school, my parents were sitting at the table they way they do whenever they have an announcement to make. \"Connor,\" my mom said.\"Your dad and I have to take Lexi to some midnight orientation for college but we can't find a babysitter for you. Henry is staying with Ben.\" \"Mom, I'm almost a teenager. I don't need a babysitter.\" \"You sure? It's going to be overnight.\" \"Yes,\" \"You're going to…\" \"Yes.\" \"How about…\" \"Yes.\" It went on long this for a while. \"Alright, you know my number if you need anything.\" AN: Just to warn you ahead of time some chapters will be short. Hope you liked this intro chapter. Please review.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Now let's skip to night where it all truly starts. I had already fallen asleep, but I woke up hearing some noise downstairs. It sounded like someone saying,\"Where is it?. My first thought was, \"Maybe my father left something here and came back early to look for it.\" But I looked at the home phone in my room (There's one in every room) was unconnected. I had two choices; I could do the safe thing and stay in bed like nothing happened or I could go investigate like in movies or books. It's pretty obvious which choice I'd chose. So, I went downstairs as quietly as I could. The living room was full of boxes and containers of toys and object. I could now clearly hear whoever it was repeating over and over, \"Where is it? Where is it?\" I could see him too, but just barely because he was covered all in black. I must have gasped or maybe I wasn't being as quiet as I thought I was because he turned around and saw me. He came toward me and I kept moving back eventually moving into a wall. He picked me up and held me against the wall and asked, \"Where is it?\" \"Where's what? I asked, admittedly a little scared. \"Don't play dumb with me kid. My sources brought me to this location.\" Then I got in idea. \"Okay, I'll get it.\" He put me down. I went to the nearest box and saw a Frisbee.\"Perfect,\" I said \"You found it?\" he asked. \"Yes, I found it.\" I don't mean to brag but I have some quick reflexes, so I threw the Frisbee behind me and he didn't know what hit hm but then he was knocked onto the floor. There was also some rope in the box, probably from when me and Ben were younger and played cowboy. So I tied him up as good as I could and went outside to get some help. But by the time I got to my neighbors, I saw him turning the corner at the end of the street and heard a car start up. So, I must not have tied him up good enough. So I just went back inside and turned the phone lines back on and went back to sleep. You would think after that I'd be too scared to sleep but I was actually excited because I had something exciting to tell Victor the next day at school.

Welcome to the sequel of The Unknown Regulators: The Wildcat Returns! Please know that I do not own Young Guns II or any of it's actors or copyrights. Please review and to anyone who reviews will get a preview to the next chapter. Well, enjoy! When we last left our Regulators, they had just gotten away from the law. Steve and Charley are both dead but so is Lawrence Murphy. Doc, Chavez, Billy, and Ember are all separating from each other. Doc and Yen are planning to go to New York and marry. Billy was determined to stay in New Mexico and prove that he couldn't be run out so easily. Chavez and Ember are headed towards California to start anew. But the Regulators have run into trouble and I mean big. How will they get out of this one? Let's find out! Chavez and Doc sat still on the porch, happy to be out of the rain, and the pit, for the time being. It had just been a few hours since Doc had been brought to Lincoln. \"So, where's your girl?\" Doc asked quietly. His throat sore from the rope they had around his neck when they had brought him into town only a day ago. \"Wife,\" Chavez corrected him. His usual silence following as he stared up at the rain coming from the sky. Doc looked up stunned ,then he looked down, just now seeing the colorful bead bracelet on Chavez's left wrist. Chavez had told him once that when his people marry that they use bracelets instead of rings. \"Ember?\" Doc asked looking back up at Chavez. Chavez turned his head to his friend and smiled then nodded. They were silent for a few moments then Doc spoke again, \"Where is she?\" he asked. Chavez sighed, \"I don't know,\" he answered truthfully. When they were being followed, Chavez had managed to distract the pursuers so Ember could get away. She had been reluctant to go and Chavez finally reasoned with her. *Flashback* \" Ember, if you stay we'll both be caught and killed. Don't make me have to watch that. Go, and if I get caught at least one of us will be free,\" Chavez told his wife, as he held her face in his hands. Ember squared her shoulders, \"Where you go, I go, remember?\" she told him forcefully. Chavez leaned over and kissed her firmly on the mouth, \"Do this for me. Get away and if you can, then come back. But don't make me have to watch my wife be hunted down like a wild coyote and murdered,\" he said, when they pulled away. Ember looked at him with tears in her eyes then she leaned forward and kissed him hard. Chavez kissed her back then pulled her back away. He helped her onto her horse then hit it's back end to send him forward. The last time thing he remembered seeing as Ember rode off, was her wild hair flying behind her. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Chavez dropped his head forward, the rain was letting up now to where it was almost about to stop. \"When did you last see her?\" Doc questioned. Chavez was silent for a moment, lost in thought, then he answered, \"Two weeks, three at the most.\" The two became silent then, both lost within their own thoughts. Suddenly, Doc nudged Chavez, his chains tinkling as he did so, \"Here comes Bill,\" he said as Bill Fisher, one of the deputies of Lincoln came riding up on horseback. Bill rode up to Sheriff Kimbel, who was by the porch so as to keep an eye on the prisoners. \"They got you some wild game, Sheriff,\" Billy told him laughing. The Sheriff raised an eyebrow at him, \"What are you talking about?\" he asked him. Bill grinned, \"How do you fancy, Wildcat?\" he said laughing. Chavez's head flew up and he turned to Doc who looked just as surprised. The Sheriff was about to say something, but then a large stage coach pulled up. A burly man with a rust colored mustache jumped out and turned to the Sheriff, \"Got you a present, Sheriff,\" he said with a filthy smile. The Sheriff grinned, \"Did ya now, well, let's see it,\" he instructed. The man nodded and turned back to the coach. He reached inside and pulled something hard out of the coach. Ember followed the man's grip. Her clothes were torn and soaked. Her hair was tangled in places and soaked through and hung limply on her back. Her hands were tied in front of her with a thick piece of rope. Her face was red on her left cheek from some unknown reason and her lip had been split recently and was already nearly healed. Chavez was ready to leap off the porch, but he knew he couldn't because of the shackles. Ember looked up and met his eyes. She looked ready to bust the ropes and run to him but the man that held her was strong, much stronger than she was. Especially now that she was so weak. \"Jesus!\" Doc whispered. The man that had Ember pushed her in front of the Sheriff. \"Well, well, what do we have here? The infamous Wildcat. How's it feel to be back, Miss Montgomery?\" Kimbel asked her. Ember kept silent and looked the sheriff dead in the eyes with a cold stare. The sheriff looked over at the man, \"Smith,\" he stated. Smith nodded then walked around Ember to where he was in front of her again. He smirked at her then punched her in the stomach with enough force that could break a rib. Ember doubled over in pain, but she didn't scream. Smith yanked her back up to where she would face the sheriff again. \"Now, as I said before what do you think of Lincoln? It's been improved since you've been here,\" the sheriff asked again. Ember glared again, \"It still looks like a bunch of flat land with piles of shit everywhere. And it looks like the biggest pile is right in front of me,\" she said in a mockingly sweet tone. The sheriff narrowed eyes then pulled his hand back and smacked Ember hard across the face. The red mark that was already there turned a brighter shade of scarlet to indicate that wasn't the first time she had been hit. \"Now, you best keep your wise lip shut or I may have to shut it for ya. But if you're a good girl I may bring you a little bit of pleasure in the middle of the night,\" he said winking. \"I'd rather die first,\" she bit out. The sheriff frowned deeply at her the shrugged, \"Too bad you're an outlaw. You're a pretty thing and that's a lot to waste. Yeah, you'll hang from them gallows tomorrow just like your friends there. Just like The Kid,\" the Sheriff said. \"Where should we put her, the pit?\" Smith asked. The sheriff shook his head, \"Nah, put her up there,\" he said pointing to a window across the street. Smith nodded then pulled Ember roughly around and stared half dragging half pulling her towards the room. \"Sleep tight now!\" Bill called after her. \"Alright, you jail rats, bed time!\" Bob Ollinger, another deputy, called. All of the prisoners filed into the pit reluctantly, but they had no other choice. If they disobeyed they would be shot by the five men with guns that were surrounding her. Once inside, Chavez and Doc leaned against the wall. Chavez looked up and saw the window where Ember had been sent. \"Be safe, amor.\" he whispered to where not even Doc could hear him. Then he watched as the light lit up the room. Smith pulled Ember up the steps and threw her into the room. Ember stumbled in and nearly ran face first into the window. Smith turned on the light and crossed the room behind her. Ember turned and flattened her back against the window, determined to keep as much distance between her and her captor. Smith came forward with a knife in his hand. Ember held her breath, \"Oh god, he's going to kill me!\" she thought. Smith grabbed her arms roughly and slashed the ropes from her wrists. \"Now, don't make trouble for yourself, you'll get new bonds tomorrow. Sleep tight,\" Smith said as he turned and walked out of the room. Ember looked down at her wrists and saw how raw and red they were. They hurt badly now. Smith and his men had caught up with her, while she was near a large river. She had tried to run but they had planned their route perfectly. While a few had followed behind her, another two had come in front to block her escape. Ember saw her only chance, the river. The river was high and moving fast but it was the only choice she had. She had spurred her horse forward into the water. She was halfway across when one of Smith's men had fired a shot that hit her horse, killing it instantly. The horse fell into the water, taking Ember with it. Even since she'd been with Chavez, Ember, still didn't know how to swim. She had struggled to get to the other side on her own, but Smith himself had grabbed her from the water. He had taken her and thrown her on the dirt. She had swallowed so much water and hit the river's rocky bottom several times, thus tearing her clothes and arms. Smith had tied her hands roughly with the rope and loaded her in the coach and taken her straight to Lincoln that very day. Ember turned and held her wrists against the cool glass. They stung now. She looked down and saw that the prisoners had been thrown back in the pit. Ember looked straight down and thought she could see Chavez and Doc in the hole. Ember leaned her head on the glass and pounded once on it. She closed her eyes. \"We're all damned now.\" she thought. Weary, she raised head to look out over the buildings. Towards the setting sun, towards where she and Chavez had once been free. Something caught her eye as she was looking out. She thought she saw someone running across the rooftops. A person of very small stature. \"Children should learn not to play on rooftops. They could get themselves shot,\" she thought bitterly. As she thought this, something in Ember's mind clicked as she tried to get a better look at the person. \"Billy?\" she whispered to herself, but it was too late, the form was gone now. Ember groaned and hit her head on the pane again, \"I'm going crazy now,\" she said out loud. She looked back out towards where she thought Chavez was, \"Chavez, is it all going to end here? In the place where it started?\" she questioned the silent room. Chavez watched as Smith cut Ember's bonds and walk out of the room without a single glance at her wounds. He watched as Ember sat by the window and held her wrists against the glass. She looked exhausted and more than a bit frayed. \"Hey, Indian! Tenderfoot!\" a voice called from above. It was Ollinger. Chavez and Doc looked up at the fat scruffy man. He was holding up a piece of rope in his hand. It was a pale white color and looked brand new. \"How do you think your pretty little friend will look with this rope necklace around her neck?\" he laughed. \"You son-of-a-bitch!\" Doc swore quietly. Chavez was ready to tear the man limb from limb with his bear hands. Ollinger laughed heartily, \"Well, she will be wearing one tomorrow. Along with the two of you. Maybe I should go pay her a proper visit. One with my 'member'!\" he laughed. Chavez nearly jumped up and grabbed the bars above him and swung up, but Doc grabbed him in time before he could do anything. \"Don't get yourself killed. Ember won't let them touch her, you know that. She's your wife and if I know one thing about Ember it's that she's loyal,\" Doc whispered in Chavez's ear. Doc looked back at Ollinger, \"You mean you actually have one?\" he asked in a smart tone. Ollinger frowned deeply, \"Yeah, keep talking that way, Scurlock. You won't have a smart remark when that lynch mob comes for ya, I can bet that.\" he said then turned, \"Let's go see what Miss Wildcat has up her sleeve, or should I say pants.\" he laughed as he walked away. Chavez was ready to kill Ollinger if he touched Ember. Ember tensed slightly as the door to her cell opened but she didn't move a muscle. \"Miss Montgomery?\" she heard a cheery voice say behind her. \"Ollinger,\" she said calmly. She didn't move though. \"Why don't you come here?\" he teased her as he walked inside the room and sat down on the small cot. Ember bit her tongue, literally, and then answered, without turning, \"Why don't you get out,\" she forced out calmly. She could feel Ollinger's anger boil as he stayed silent. Ollinger slid off the bed and walked a few steps toward her, but stopped. \"Now listen, you breed. You're nothing, I'm probably the only one who will ever touch your mixed blood skin so you best feel grateful and come over here and help me be satisfied,\" he snarled at her. Ember kept her voice calm and emotionless even though she felt violated and disgusted, \"I'm married,\" she replied \"so go find a brainless chickadee that will 'satisfy' you because it won't be me,\" she replied. \"Married, huh? How long?' he questioned. \"A week technically, though our honeymoon was ruined. Hm, wonder why?\" she told him the last part sarcastically. Ollinger threw a bottle at the wall that was beside her. It shattered into thousands of pieces and they landed all over the floor. Ember had to fight back the urge to flinch, so as to win her little game with Ollinger. But he wasn't going to walk out of here without the last word. He crossed the room in two strides and turned Ember around with one quick movement of his hand. Then he pushed her hard against the glass. Ember thought she felt the glass give way a little but she ignored it. Ollinger was right in her face now, \"You'll be wishing you took my offer when the sun goes down. I've heard the lynch mob is coming for ya. You and the other three. Yeah, we've got The Kid here too. So there's no way you're getting out of this. No chance,\" he let go of her and walked back across the room. \"Have a nice night. Let me know if you change your mind.\" he laughed as he walked out the door and locked it behind him. Ember slid wearily down the glass. He legs were trembling so bad, that they could barely hold her weight. She sat on the floor shaking, \"A lynch mob. We're definitely going to die now,\" she thought. Ember slid sideways and looked out the window at the fast setting sun. She shook her head, \"First robbed of my wedding night, now this,\" she groaned out loud. She stayed near the window now, not wanting to look away from where she could see Chavez now. His hair had gotten a bit long since she had see him. She couldn't blame him though, her once waist length hair was now grown out to reach her hips. She sighed, \"Where you go, I go.\" she whispered to herself as she closed her eyes. Then fell asleep against the glass, beaten but not broken.[Chapter 2] Hi, everyone! Welcome to the Wildcat Returns! I hope you all read my first Young Guns fanfic: The Unknown Regulator. If you d id I hope you enjoyed it! Well, let's get started shall we! Here we go! Ember woke up suddenly, by a commotion that was coming from the street below. She sat up, stiffly, from her position by the window and looked out through the clear glass. Coming down the road, was a lynch mob consisting of about five men. About three of them were carrying torches and another was leading two spare horses. \"Oh my God!\" Ember muttered aloud, a hand rising to her throat. The group stopped in front of the pit across the street. Ember stood as she looked upon the scene. If she strained her ears hard enough, she could hear the conversation. Ollinger was beside a fire with his hands up as if in surrender. \"You're a bit late?\" she heard him complain. Ember listened as Ollinger explained that Billy the Kid had escaped. A hooded man jumped off his horse and ran inside to make sure Ollinger wasn't lying about Billy's whereabouts. A few minutes later he ran back out confirming about the missing prisoner. One of the men on horses, with an Irish accent, turned to one of his companions, after looking inside the pit an not finding Billy. \"We might as well go,\" he suggested, but Ollinger wasn't finished yet. He stepped forward and said, \"We got a couple of his Regulators in there. The Indian and the Tenderfoot. We also got the Wildcat up there,\" he finished pointing at Ember through the window. \"The Wildcat, huh? Well, hell why not bring them all out,\" The tallest man encouraged. Ollinger grinned at them, then signaled to Bill to fetch Ember. Ember turned as she heard the heavy footsteps on the stairs and placed her back against the window. Bill unlocked the door and peeked his grinning head around. When he caught sight of Ember he pushed the rest of himself inside the room. \"Alrighty, Miss Wildcat, let's go,\" he told her grinning. He reached his hand forward to pull her, but Ember just stepped out of his reach and glared at him. She squared her shoulders and lifted her head. \"I can walk by myself, thank you, Bill,\" she stated to him. She then walked around the scrawny man and down the steps, Bill following behind her. When they got to the bottom of the steps, Ember moved to the side and allowed Bill to slide around and open the door. Ember stepped out into the cool night air. Across the street she could see that Doc and Chavez were already loaded onto the spare horses. Ollinger came up to Ember and gripped her forearm and half dragged her over to the lynch mob members. \"See, I told ya we had the Wildcat,\" he announced proudly. \"Well, so you have,\" the Irish man said form behind the hood. Ollinger spun Ember around again, where she would face him, and pulled out a piece of rope. He had Bill grip Ember's wrists and hold then together while he tied them roughly and tightly. Ember winced as the new robes cut even deeper into her skin than the previous ropes had. Ollinger admired his work when he was finished then he had Bill bring him another piece of rope. Ollinger took this piece and tied it, again, tightly and roughly around the other piece. Entwining the ropes in random places. When he was finished no one could tell where one piece of rope ended and the other began. Ollinger grinned at her then rubbed the back of his hand over Ember's red, left cheek. Ember glared at him the yanked her head back out of his reach. Ollinger narrowed his eyes at her then balled his hand into a fist. Ember wanted to reel back, but she kept her ground and kept glaring at Ollinger. Ollinger leered at her, then punched Ember's cheek, hard. Ember wobbled backwards a bit but the taller lynch mob member caught her by the shoulders. At some point he had gotten off of his horse without either Ember or Ollinger noticing. \"Alright, Ollinger, don't bruise the tender skin yet,\" he scoffed. Ember felt her cheek throb with pain but she tried to ignore it. Ollinger just laughed and waved his hand for the man to carry on. The tall man walked Ember over to the man who had run inside earlier to look for Billy, the one who was on his horse already. The tall one placed Ember behind the man on the horse then went to mount his own horse. The Irish man gave the signal and the group moved on through town. Around them people started laughing at jeering at Ember, Doc, and Chavez. \"Pick your tree, breed!\" the Irish man laughed as he spoke to Chavez. Ember looked at Chavez and tried to give him a small smile. Doc caught this out of the corner of his eye and started trying to lie through his teeth to get them out of the situation. \"Gentleman, I'm a school teacher form the city of New York and the lady back there is my sister while the breed is, well he's our guide. And I believe you're about to make an enormous error,\" Doc explained. The tall man rode up to Doc, \"We know you rode with the boy, now you're going to hang for it,\" the man explained back. \"I swear I never laid eyes on him. I'm a school teacher form the city of New York,\" Doc defended. The Irish man rode up beside Doc now, \"I'm a school teacher from the city of New York!\" he mocked then laughed a very familiar laugh. Ember's head shot up as she eyed the man curiously. The man took off his hood and there sat Billy. Following his lead the other men took off their hoods as well. The tall man turned out to be Pat Garrett who Ember recognized fairly well and the man Ember was riding behind turned out to be a man named Dave Rudabough who they all recognized faintly from wanted posters. \"Howdy, Doc. How are your drawers?\" Billy asked Doc, laughing. \"Good to see ya, Billy,\" Doc answered almost nervous. Billy laughed. Behind her, Ember heard Ollinger finally realize who had taken his prisoners. \"Come on, let's skin out!\" Billy told them enthusiastically. Unfortunately, there were about twenty men blocking their way out of town. \"Jesus, you sure got a lot of boys riding with you these days,\" Doc commented almost dumbstruck at all of the men. \"Them ain't my boys. It's the real lynch mob! SKIN OUT!\" Billy yelled at them. \"Hold on ,darling!\" Dave told Ember as he spurred his horse the other way. Ember gripped as tight as the bonds would allow her to onto Dave's coat as he maneuvered his horse through the town. The whole place fell into mass chaos. Fires spurted up everywhere. Dave directed his horse onto a porch of a burning building as one of the sheriff's deputies started shooting at them. Dave pulled out a large gun and started firing randomly, missing most of his targets. \"What are you doing?\" Ember yelled at him over the roar of the gun. \"Blowing us a way out of here, sweet cheeks!\" he answered, \"Now, watch me take down this tenderfoot,\" he told her as he pointed the gun at the man. Dave fired the gun but now bullets ever exited. \"Oh, look there. No bullets left,\" Dave mused, shooting a few more times to make sure the cartridge really was empty. \"NO BULLETS!\" Ember screeched. Just then, a few more bullets sailed over them. \"Hold on!\" Dave yelled. Ember gripped Dave's back for dear life as Dave pulled out a pistol and ran at the man that was firing at them. Dave knocked over the man and sent him crashing through a window that had all kinds of plates and china ware. Behind them, Ember turned and saw the sheriff and another one of his deputies. \"Great, you got him now what about those two!\" Ember pointed out to Dave. Dave turned towards the two then back toward the shop. He pushed up on the already falling rafter and pushed the horse inside the store and not a moment too soon. The sheriff and his deputy started firing on the two. Dave shot back, but somehow they pushed Dave farther back into the store. Dave and Ember looked around the small room, \"Now what do we do?\" Ember questioned, almost panicked. Dave smirked, \"This!\" he said as he pushed his horse through the glass and started shooting. Dave got them past the sheriff then they headed towards Billy. Ember peeked around Dave and saw Billy, Doc, and Garret. Frantically, she looked around and saw Chavez come up beside her and Dave. \"Come on! Hurry! We gotta skin out of here!\" Billy yelled at them. Just as they reached the others, there was an a series of explosions behind them. Ember turned slightly and saw a bunch of explosions that spooked their enemies horses. Dave spurred his horse on to catch up with Billy. Ember heard Billy laugh his crazy laugh as they headed towards the river. \"Alright, Chavez, I'll get you loose first. Pat, you get those ropes off Wildcat,\" Billy ordered as he slipped off his horse and walked around their little hiding spot. Pat walked over to Ember, who had fallen asleep, and gently shook her to get her up. Ember stirred then looked around. Pat pulled her off of Dave's horse and walked her over to a large boulder. Ember watched as Billy took aim and blasted apart Chavez's chains within seconds. Chavez stood and rubbed his wrists for a moment then went toward Pat and Ember. Ember looked down and saw Pat kneeling in front of her with a large knife. Carefully, he started to try and cut his way through her bonds without cutting her. The ropes moved over Ember's skin, chaffing even worse. \"Ouch,\" Ember muttered. Pat looked up at her apologetically, \"Sorry,\" he apologized then went back to his work. Chavez walked over and put a hand on Ember's shoulder. Ember looked up and smiled at him. Chavez gave her a small smile in return, then he turned and went to check his horse. Ember looked over and saw Doc getting behind the same rock Chavez had and prepared to get his chains removed. \"Now hold still now. I got this buckshot infection in my elbow. Makes my right arm kind of…whoa. Hold still now,\" Billy joked with Doc. Doc looked up, weariness and irritation in his eyes, \"I am still. Just shoot the chain, ok?\" He said as he ducked back behind the rock. Billy pulled the hammer back on the gun an looked at Doc, \"God damn, it's good to see ya, Doc. I knew you'd come back. We made a pact, remember? You, me, Ember, and Chavez. Pals. Forever,\" Billy said, reminiscing. Ember looked down just in time to see Pat cut through the last of the ropes. The thick pieces of twine fell away from her skin, leaving it raw and nearly bleeding. \"There ya go, Wildcat,\" Pat said, standing up. Ember grinned at him in gratitude. Then she turned around and ran to Chavez. Chavez, who had been watching as the last of the ropes fell away, held his arms open to her. She jumped on him and he caught her easily. Ember crashed her lips into his and Chavez smiled against her lips and kissed her back. The two pulled back almost breathless but finally happy. Chavez set Ember on her feet then hugged her close to him. Ember smiled then hugged him back. After a few moments, the two let go of each other, but Chavez still kept one of Ember's hands in closed in one of his. Behind Ember, Pat cleared his throat. Ember turned towards him and saw him hold out some extra clothes. \"Thought you could use these,\" he explained. Ember laughed loudly for the first time in about a week. She held Chavez's hand to her lips and kissed it softly then slid her hand out of his. Ember walked over to Pat and took the clothes from him, \"Thank you, Mr. Garrett,\" she thanked. Pat laughed at her now, \"It's Pat to you and it's no trouble they should fit,\" he explained. Ember nodded then went off a few yards behind some brush to change. \"Well wasn't that sentimental.\" Dave mocked as he started walking around impatiently. \"Billy the chain come on!\" Doc pleaded. \"Like I said, forever,\" Billy mused. Dave walked up suddenly, \"Look, I don't care if you all swapped spittle and pissed in each other's boots. I don't take to tenderfoots in my gang and I definitely don't take to no Mexicans,\" he pointed out. Ember walked back into the campsite and went and stood behind Chavez who was checking his horse. She heard the last part of what Dave had said and started watching Chavez carefully. \"It ain't your gang, Dave,\" Billy told him exasperated, as if he'd had this discussion before. Chavez glared at Dave, \"It's Mexican-Indian you son-of-a-bitch,\" Chavez corrected. Dave raised his hand and laughed a little, \"Oh, I'm sorry. Tell me something, Cha-vez. Was it the savages putting it to a Mexican whore or was it an Indian whore putting it to the whole god damn Mexican army?\" Dave asked. At the end Chavez leaped for Dave but Billy and Pat rushed in on this one. \"Migisi!\" Ember yelled to get Chavez's attention. Billy pushed in between the two and flung them backwards. Ember grabbed Chavez by his shoulders and turned him towards her. Softly, she started speaking something in another language, that the others couldn't understand but Chavez could, and stroking the side of Chavez's face with her fingertips. Dave finally figured out what she was doing. \"Oh my god! Is she Indian, too?\" he almost yelled. Ember glared at him then stepped in front of Chavez to face Dave. \"Only half.\" she confirmed, smirking. Dave laughed, \"Is that so? Well, guess that makes you the next generation of the Indian whores, huh?\" he laughed. Ember's eyes both narrowed and darkened as she leapt forward, knocking Dave to the ground on his back. Ember sat with her knees on his chest as she pushed down on his lungs, \"Want to say anything else, Rudabough!\" she spoke darkly. Behind her Ember heard Pat ask Billy, \"Are you going to stop them?\" \"Nope, never step in front of a Wildcat when she's angry,\" Billy replied chuckling. Ember and Dave ignored the two. Dave grinned at her stupidly, \"Yeah, you're really cute when you're angry,\" he said. Ember balled her hand into a fist and punched Dave in the jaw. \"You bitch!\" he screamed trying to hit her now, but Chavez had already grabbed Ember by the waist and pulled her off. If it hadn't been for Billy, Dave would have torn through Chavez. \"Come here, you little bitch. I'm going to kill you!\" Dave roared. Ember was struggling in Chavez's grip as well, trying to get loose. \"Yeah! Come on and hit me! I've been hit enough and I've got the bruises to prove it! You can't do anything to me that they haven't already done!\" she screamed back. Finally the two were separated and Billy looked Dave hard in the face, \"Remember something, Dave. These are the Lincoln County Regulators,\" he told him sternly. Dave scoffed, \"Yeah, was.\" Doc corrected Dave's grammar and finally got Billy to shoot the chains off of him. Billy explained that he was taking the broken trail called the Mexican Blackbird. Chavez looked at Ember who was beside him now, \"It's your choice, Leona. Should we go?\" he asked her quietly. Ember shook her head, \"I don't see any other way. They already caught us in California. As bad as I hate to say it, but I think we should follow Billy's lead on this one,\" she admitted. Chavez nodded the kissed her forehead. The couple looked up when they heard Doc mount his horse. They could see a watch in Billy's hand that could only have been Doc's. Billy walked up to Doc's horse and looked up at Doc, \"The horse ain't for sale, Doc. But what about my boots, they're nice and broken-\" but he was cut off by Doc kicking him in the face, \"You son-of-a-bitch!\" Doc growled as he jumped out of the saddle and onto Billy. The two started rolling on the ground as Chavez and Ember stood immediately. Chavez rushed forward and seized Doc under the arms while Pat did the same to Billy. The two started screaming at each other. \"I SAW YOU KILL!!\" Billy screamed at Doc. Ember rushed forward, in between the two, \"STOP IT! BOTH OF YOU!\" she screamed at them. Billy looked past her now, \"You remember, John Tunstall?\" he asked Doc. Billy went into a rant about a story John had told the Regulators a long time ago. Ember felt a tear well up in her eye as she remembered what had happened before the Lincoln County War. \"I shall finish the game, Doc,\" Billy finished. He turned towards his horse, \"Who's ever riding for Old Mexico, we ride now,\" Billy instructed. Chavez placed a hand on Doc's shoulder as he passed him them went to Ember as she walked with him. Billy looked over at her, \"We'll get you a horse in the next town,\" he told her as he mounted his horse. Ember and Chavez walked to his horse while Pat and Doc were talking. Chavez helped Ember onto the horse first then turned to Doc who had finished talking with Pat. \"They'll catch you, Doc. They caught us,\" Chavez said looking up at Ember then back at Doc, \"Everybody but him. The villagers say he's the diablerro, he can change into a coyote and disappear and never gets killed. Me? I think he's just the luckiest wide eye in New Mexico. But he'll cross the border, he will,\" Chavez told Doc ad he climbed up on the horse, trying to convince him to come along. \"Chavez, I can't ride with him anymore. I've been trying to spend the last year forgetting him. I read about them in the newspaper and in those damned five cent books. Jesus Christ , the children in New York City imitate him in the streets. He's in my sleep. You've gotta understand what I'm saying. It's over,\" Doc reasoned. \"When the spirit horse comes, then it's over,\" Chavez argued the turned the horse towards where the others had gone. \"Hold on, Amor,\" he told Ember as he sent their horse into a full gallop. Ember replied by snaking her arms tightly around his waist. After a few moments, Ember heard hoof beats on the ground. She turned and saw Doc riding hell bent for leather. When he caught up to them Ember called across, \"Glad you could make it!\" she laughed, beaming at him. Doc laughed then the three followed the others closely.[Chapter 3] I do not own Young Guns or any of it's actors. Though I wish I did! Ha! Enjoy! _____________________________________________________________ \"Billy, where are the men you promised us? You said you had an army,\" Doc said, sounding impatient. The group now sat in Beaver's eating establishment in Fort Sumter. Ember looked over at Doc, from her place between Chavez and himself, then placed a tentative hand on his shoulder. Doc looked over at her, then sighed as he smiled back, trying to relax. Ember removed her hand from his shoulder and looked around at her surroundings. The group sat in a private room of the restaurant. Doc, Ember, Chavez, Dave, and Billy sat at a large table. Pat was at the other, smaller table by himself. Billy looked up at Doc, \"I do,\" he confirmed. Behind them, they heard the sound of footstep, \"Here it comes,\" he said in a matter-of-fact tone. Through the doorway came the Hispanic man, that Billy had sent out earlier, followed by a rather tall white man. Billy stood and went to the door and looked around the stranger and out the door. He went back to Hispanic man, \"Jesus, only one?\" he asked. Jesus shook his head, \"No one want to come. Everyone afraid,\" he replied simply, in his atrocious English, then turned and walked out without another word. \"You a farmer?\" Dave asked the man gruffly. The man swallowed nervously, \"Yes, sir. My name's Hendry William French,\" the man answered. Dave chuckled, \"You ever shoot anyone before, Hendry William French?\" Dave interrogated. Hendry shook his head warily. Chavez looked up, \"You ever shoot anything before?\" he inquired. Ember looked over at him and nudged him with her elbow. \"Sage hen,\" Hendry responded. Dave started laughing out loud. Ember glared at him then stood up. She took the palm of her hand and smacked the back of his head. Hard. Dave looked up and glared at her but she had already looked away from him, \"Try and ignore him, we do,\" she told Hendry, giving him a small, friendly smile. Hendry returned the smile shyly as Ember re-seated herself. \"Well, tell me something, Hendry, why is it you want to join my gang?\" Dave questioned. \"Well-\" Hendry began but was cut off by Billy taking his gun. \"Well, I'm ain't a farmer no more. I lost my wife to the pox; my land and the money then,\" Hendry explained. \"Hey, Big Casino!\" Billy spoke over his shoulder to Pat. He walked over to Pat and handed him Hendry's gun, \"Saw a foot off this thing, just in case we meet up with General Wallace on the way,\" he told Pat. Pat sighed and stood, \"I don't think I'm going to make this one, Kid,\" he explained to Billy. \"Smart guy,\" Ember muttered to Chavez and Doc. Chavez reached over and took her hand in his as they watched Pat turn and walk out of Beaver's. \"WELL GO ON! WE DON'T NEED YA, PAT!\" Billy yelled after him. In the corner, Ember saw a small hand reach under a cloth toward a loaf of bread on a plate. Beaver walked over and stepped on the hand. From behind the curtain he dragged out a young boy of about fourteen or fifteen. Beaver dragged the boy over to a spittoon and tried to shove his face in it. But Billy was quicker. Billy rushed over to Beaver and put a gun to his head, \"Howdy, Beaver,\" he said cheerfully. Beaver knew Billy's game and released the boy. Billy stood as well, and pushed the boy toward the table, \"Go sit with the boys,\" he told him. Dave looked up confused, like the others, \"What the hell's this?\" he demanded. Billy threw an arm around the boys shoulder, \"This is the Prince of Pennsylvania,\" Billy laughed. Billy pulled out one of his guns and spun it professionally and handed it to the boy. The boy took it like it was a new train set. Ember stood abruptly, \"Billy no! Don't pull him into this!\" she nearly screamed at him. Billy looked over at her mischievously, \"Aw, come on, Wildcat. Lighten up,\" he joked with her. Ember narrowed her eyes at him, but the boy looked over at her surprised. \"Y-y-you're the Wildcat?\" he asked, stunned. Ember looked at the boy now, \"How old are you?\" she asked softly. The boy swallowed, \"Seventeen,\" he answered, shakily. Ember arched an eyebrow at him, \"Alright. Now how old are you really?\" she interrogated. The boy blushed then looked down slightly, \"Fourteen and a half,\" he admitted. Ember's eyes flashed over to Billy now, \"Fourteen and a half?\" she asked angrily. Billy rolled his eyes, \"I know what I'm doing. Besides, if we leave him here Beaver will kill him. So, you decide,\" Billy said, challenging her. Ember glared for a few more minutes then finally sighed, defeated and took her seat again. \"Cocky, son-of-a-bitch,\" she muttered to where Billy couldn't hear her. Chavez looked at her then threw an arm around her shoulder and kissed the crown of her head. Billy looked at the rest of his so called, 'gang'. \"Alright, let's move out!\" he commanded. The group followed Billy out of town and towards one of John Tunstall's old friends, John Simpson Chisum. Ember looked up at the gorge and saw the men watching them as they rode by. Ember sped the horse that Billy had given her, forward to where she was in between Doc and Chavez. The boy, Tom, was riding beside Billy, looking at him like he was a god. \"If he gets that boy killed I'm going to finish him,\" she thought disgustedly. Finally, a house came into view. The group slowed their horses to slow as they neared it. As they entered the yard Ember saw Mr. Chisum waiting for them. She had only met Mr. Chisum once and that was when John Tunstall had had him for company one night before he died. He hadn't changed one bit. \"Well, by God. You really turned out to be a snake, Billy. When they catch you they're going to drag out your stinking bones,\" Mr. Chisum greeted. \"I guess it's safe to say he remembers us,\" Doc said quietly to Chavez and Ember. Mr. Chisum was about to say something else, but Billy interrupted him, \"Mr. Chisum, I'm just trying to get my friends to Old Mexico. We need some pesos. Now, I done some figuring and I figure you owe us about five hundred dollars, Mr. Chisum,\" Billy explained. Ember watched as Mr. Chisum's face grew angry as he looked at Billy. Ember pulled her hair around to where it covered her face and where no one could see her frustrated expression. \"Well, you can take those figures and shove them up your arrogant little ass and set fire to them. I don't owe you a god damned thing. Now get the hell out of here or I'll bring my fifty down and give you a real game!\" Mr. Chisum threatened. \"And Billy always brings the best out of people,\" Chavez muttered beside Ember. \"Yeah, we saw some of your men out there on the high range. Passed right by em, fine bunch,\" Dave commented. \"How did I know he was going to open his mouth,\" Ember muttered back to Chavez. \"Mr. Chisum, you're right. The Lincoln County War is over. We just want to get out of here, get down below,\" Doc said ,trying to smooth things over. \"Oh, you'll get down below, Doc. You're Billy the Kid too, you know. You all are. Dirty little Billy bastards,\" Mr. Chisum argued. \"I'd like to left out of that pole, if you please,\" Ember piped in. Chisum ignored Ember and kept giving Billy a hard glare. \"You took my farm, Mr. Chisum. You took a lot of farms, Mr. Chisum. As long as Billy the Kind is taking some back, I'm with him,\" Hendry interrupted. \"Of course you are,\" Ember mumbled. Just then, two Hispanic men walked up behind Mr. Chisum. \"Everything alright Mr. Chisum?\" one man asked. Mr. Chisum turned and tried to get the men away so they wouldn't get hurt, but Billy had to have his fun, \"Yoo-hoo, \"I'll make you famous,\" he said to them as he pointed his gun. \"Oh God,\" Ember groaned as she leaned her head into one of her hands. Somehow, Billy had managed to talk the two men into a gun battle. Billy made a deal with them that when he went for his guns, one could start shooting. Although, when Billy asked if he was ready, it was Dave who shot the first man. Chavez pushed Ember's and his horses back a couple of feet so they could get out of the way. Next, the other man started for his guns but when Billy called on Hendry, he almost didn't make it. Instead, the shot came from Doc's gun. Ember and Chavez both looked up suddenly when Doc threw down his gun and rode off. \"Bonney, you are a fool. You call yourself the scourge of New Mexico, but by god I am New Mexico and you are dead,\" Chisum threatened. Billy laughed, \"Well, let me tell you something, Mr. New Mexico. I wouldn't give a bucket of piss for you future,\" he said turning toward his horse, picking up Doc's abandoned gun on his way. \"Let's skin out boys,\" he said to the others then he looked at Ember, \"And Wildcat.\" he joked. Ember shook her head, \"Don't drag me into this one,\" was all she said as she turned her horse and raced off the way Doc had gone.[Chapter 4] I do not own any of the Young Guns movies or the actors. The copyrights aren't mine either. \"Doc! Slow down!\" Ember yelled after Doc as he raced across the open prairie. Doc stopped and as Ember neared him he turned to her with eyes full of self loathing. \"Doc?\" Ember asked quietly. \"I can't get away from it, Ember. I'll always be the man from my past. I promised myself I wouldn't kill again, but look at what I just did,\" Doc said in a trembling voice, tears welling up in his eyes. \"Doc, you did what you had to do. To survive. You were doing what you had to do to get back home safely. To your family. If that man had killed Billy, we would all be back in the pit for sure. And who cares if you are you're the man from your past? I learned it the hard way, Doc, you can never run from your past. It will always catch up with you. So please, take my advice, do what you have to do to survive. Or as Billy says, finish the game,\" Ember argued with him. Doc rubbed an arm over his eyes, then looked back at Ember. \"Thank you,\" was all he said to her. Ember smiled, then looked up at the sky as the others neared them. When they approached, Ember looked at Billy, \"Billy, it's getting late, we should probably camp out for the night. Make for town in the morning,\" she suggested. Billy pondered her suggestion for a moment, then nodded. \"Sounds good,\" he replied then pointed to some nearby cliffs, \"We'll hide there for the night then set off at dawn,\" he told them then started off in the direction of the cliffs. Ember waited as Chavez rode up beside her then they started having their horses trot in sync, happy to have a moment to themselves. \"Doc all right?\" Chavez asked with worry for his friend evident on his face. Ember nodded, \"For now he's fine. For now, we're all fine and I'd like to keep it that way,\" Ember said, glaring at Billy's back. Chavez looked at her for a long moment, \"I agree,\" was all he said. Once the group arrived at the cliffs that Billy had pointed out, the sun was just about to set. \"Alright, starting tomorrow morning we need to make a little pit stop at Mr. Chisum's pastures,\" Billy informed the group as everyone dismounted their horses. \"Oh, and why is that?\" Doc questioned as he loaded his blanket and gear off his horse. \"Well, sir, I think if Mr. Chisum is in such a hardship about giving us some money I think we'll help him out by taking a few cows to lower the expenses he has to pay on them,\" Billy explained, laughing at the end. \"Of course you think that,\" Ember muttered to herself. She dismounted her horse and grabbed her gear off the ground where she had thrown it a few moments earlier. \"Is that a good idea, Billy?\" Tom asked, innocently. \" 'Course I do, Tommy. Now everyone settle down. Hendry, Dave, go get some wood for a fire.\" he ordered just like he had done when he was the so called \"captain\" of the Regulators. Ember froze and stared at Billy and Tom. The nickname Billy had given Tom had sparked a memory in her. A memory of a small body thrown into a river. Chavez placed a gentle hand on Ember's shoulder and his wife jumped slightly. \"Are you all right?\" he asked her, worry evident in his voice. Ember sighed. \"Fin… just remembered something I didn't want to,\" she sighed then strode over to a place of dirt closest to the cliff wall. She whistled to Doc and Chavez, who were unpacking the cups and dishes, to get their attention. \"Throw me your packs. We can setup over here,\" she told them. The two men obeyed and tossed their sleeping packs onto the dirt beside her. Ember began to set up blankets as Dave and Hendry came back and began talking to Billy, Chavez, and Doc. As she rolled out a large blanket for herself and Chavez, a small shadow fell over her. Ember froze then noticed the shadow meant her no harm. She turned and saw Tom standing over her, shuffling his feet in the dirt. Ember sat up on her knees and turned to Tom who had stepped to her side. \"Do you need something, Tom?\" she asked, she liked the kid, didn't think he should be there, but liked him nonetheless. \"A-are you r-r-really the Wildcat?\" the boy stuttered. Ember smiled softly at him, 'Yes, that's me unfortunately,\" she answered. Tom stared at her wide eyed. \"And those other men? Are the other Regulators?\" he asked, his stutter gone for the moment. Ember nodded. \"Now why are you here Tom?\" Ember asked. Tom blushed, but answered, \"I wan to ride the trail with Billy the Kid and the Wildcat.\" Shaking her head Ember sighed, \"I haven't been the Wildcat in a long time,\" she said as she turned back around to her task. Tom sat down beside her and began helping her, without being asked. \"How come?\" he questioned. Ember smiled softly, \"I tried to get away. Tried to become Ember instead. Unlike Billy I don't want to be remembered as The Wildcat, I'll be happy as being remembered as a happy wife,\" she admitted. Tom turned to look at her with the curious expression in his eyes that she had seen once in a two year olds eyes. They finished their task, and Ember shook her head and smiled at the boy in front of her. She reached out her hand and ruffled Tom's hair, \"But you're a kid, go have fun, but please don't be stupid. If one of these days I say run, you run. Got it?\" Tom nodded and grinned at her then out of no where lunged at her waist and hugged her tightly. Ember tensed slightly then relaxed and hugged him back. After a moment, Ember pulled him back then nodded her head for him to run along. Tom grinned then stood up and jogged off toward Billy. Ember stood on her own and stretched. Suddenly, two arms wrapped around her waist. This time she didn't jump, only one person did this. A head rested lightly on her shoulder, \"Have I ever told you that you would make an excellent mother?\" Chavez's voice whispered in her ear. She smiled, \"Only once or twice,\" she joked with him, placing her hand over his on her waist. Chavez pecked her on the cheek, \"And I meant it,\" he whispered again. \"You two love birds done or are we going to watch you all night?\" Dave's voice interrupted them from across the fire that had just been built. The couple sighed and pulled away from each other and went to the fire and sat down. \"We better get some sleep it's going to be a long day tomorrow. Everyone needs all their strength,\" Billy told the group who were already tired, \"Dave take the first watch.\" Dave looked at Billy with a surprised look but said nothing. He crossed his arms over his chest ins a pout. With that everyone retired to their plots and fell asleep.[Chapter 5] I do not own any of the Young Guns movies or the actors. The copyrights aren't mine either. \"Sherriff of Lincoln County. Sherriff Pat Garret. Now how does that sound? One thousand dollars, and all the resources you need to catch one William H. Bonney,\" Governor Lew Wallace told Pat as he sat in front of the remaining Santa Fe ring. Pat sat there, blinking at the money on the table. \"Plus we're also giving you a deputy,\" John Chisum. Chisum snapped his fingers and a young man about nineteen years old walked out from around a corner. Pat looked at the boy and thought he had been punched in the gut as he stared on. The boy lifted his hat, \"Hello, Mr. Garrett. My name is Aaron Murphy. It's a pleasure.\" Ember blinked her eyes a little then curled closer into Chavez's side. The gang had decided to hide out in an abandoned structure of some kind out of sight. All of a sudden, shots from a gun rang out. Ember, Chavez, Dave, and Hendry all shot up looking around wildly. Chavez jumped up first and ran forward with his guns up while Ember followed and the other boys followed behind. When they came out of the opening all they saw was Billy with his guns held up, staring intently. \"Oh dear lord he's finally lost his mind,\" Ember muttered as she slammed her guns back into her belt. \"What did they do spell your name wrong,\" Doc called out from the other side of some rubble. Billy stepped forward and pulled a piece of paper off of the wall he had been shooting at. \"We got a new Sheriff on us boys. Sheriff by the name of Pat Garrett.\" As the words left his mouth everyone turned their heads toward Billy. Tom peered over Billy's shoulder and squinted at the printed words that now had holes near them. \"Who's Aaror Murphy?\" Tom asked. Dave tilted his head at the boy, 'What the hell is a Aaror?\" \"That's what it says in the paper, read it for yourself.\" Tom held the paper out to Dave. Dave just pushed the paper back, \"Real men don't read.\" Ember huffed then grabbed the paper from between them, \"Give me that,\" then she scanned the lines and almost dropped the paper. \"We are in big trouble now,\" she whispered. \"What do ya mean?\" Hendry questioned. Ember turned and looked at Billy, Doc, and Chavez, \"They've made Aaron Murphy Garrett's Deputy. Think he wants revenge or did he just volunteer to be a good citizen?\" Doc opened his mouth to answer but Billy interrupted him, \"No time to worry about the small fry, let's skin out of here while we still can. We'll give Pat a chase of that's what he want. Let's go.\" With that he turned and walked away but not without pulling out a tobacco pouch from his side saddle and place it on a branch with the poster inside. \"What's that for Billy?\" Tom asked. \"Well, Tom, I figure Sherriff Garrett needs to remember who he's dealing with.\" After three hours the gang began to go down hill into some mild looking valleys. \"Billy! Where are we headed?\" Doc shouted to Billy from the back of the group. Billy turned in his saddle to face Doc, \"Taking a bit of a rest Doc. We're headed to White Oaks!\" \"White Oaks? Isn't that where Jane Greathouse lives?\" Ember asked. \"That's where she was last time,\" Doc answered. The group finally got to the bottom of a valley and Chavez pulled forward to the front of the group and help up his hand, \"Whoa. Burial ground. Warm springs people. Apache.\" Everyone surveyed the makeshift grave markers of the cemetery and sat in silence. \"We'd better get going,\" Tom suggested and Chavez nodded. \"We'll go around.\" Ember pulled her bowed her head in a silent prayer as Dave started arguing with Chavez about getting Indian bones for money. Raising her head, Ember pulled up beside Dave, \"Valuable to you in one way but in their eyes you will be disturbing precious ground. If they catch you they'll kill you and you can bet we won't stand in their way to protect your sorry ass because you wanted to make a quick buck.\" \"You're all sentimental as hell, but fine whatever you say, oh Princess.\" Dave drawled. Eyeing him for a moment, Ember shook her head then began to move on. As everyone turned, Dave pushed his horse forward and jumped onto the ground and started digging through a pile of rocks. Chavez ran his horse forward and leaped onto Dave. The two began to fight but Dave managed to pull his gun only to get it knocked out of his hand by Chavez. Ember began to get off her horse but it was Billy who grabbed her arm, \"Hold on a minute Wildcat. Wait until they get it out of their system,' he told her calmly. Wrenching her hand out of his grasp, Ember glared at The Kid, \"You're a sick bastard if you really think I'm going to let them kill each other,\" she growled. By now both men have their knives out and were now circling each other. Chavez ducked and cut Dave's arm, but Dave grabbed some dirt and threw it in Chavez's face. As Chavez stumbled backward trying to clean his eyes but Dave hit him again with an Indian artifact and sent him falling backward. Dace came forward with his knife held out Ember felt her heart stop. When the knife came down she heard herself scream but couldn't really make heads or tails about what was going on, all she could see was the knife plunging into her husband's arm. Then she found herself behind Dave as he was on the ground grabbing his gun ready to pull the trigger as she pulled the hammer down on her own weapon along with the rest of the boys behind her. \"I don't think so Dave,\" Billy said but Ember didn't react when they put their weapons down. Ember held her gun up and pointed at Dave's head as Chavez stood up. \"You want your knife back?' Chavez asked. Dave stared at Ember like a scared rabbit then turned to Chavez, \"Uh, yeah.\" Ember followed him, lowering her weapon slightly, then she had to look away as he yanked the large knife out of her husband's arm. Dave turned and walked back toward his horse but not without hearing Ember utter a warning, \"If you ever do anything like that again make no mistake I will kill you on spot whether Billy is here or not.\" Dave nodded his head slightly as he walked then Ember rushed forward to inspect Chavez's arm. She bite her cheek when she saw how much blood there was. \"It's not as bad as it looks,\" Chavez whispered to her. Ember's eyes flashed up to meet his, \"You're right it's worse,\" then she ducked her head back down and began to remove her coat. \"Tom,\" she called over her shoulder, \"Go get Chavez's horse for me please.\" Chavez looked up as the boy did exactly as he was instructed but then his attention was brought back to his wife as a loud ripping sound broke the air. He looked down and saw Ember pulling off the rest of her shirt sleeve then moving her other sleeve and ripping that on off too. \"Hold out your arm,\" she commanded and Chavez obeyed. Tom appeared beside Ember as she began to gently cut Chavez's sleeve with her knife. As she worked she instructed Tom on how to bandage a would properly until you could find medicine and proper bandages. Once she was finished she sent Tom to check on Dave's wounds. Ember looked into her husband's face and saw he small smile he wore. \"What?\" she asked but her only answer was the soft kiss Chavez placed on her lips which she deepened. When they broke away Ember placed a soft hand on the side of Chavez's face, \"I thought I was going to lose you,\" she whispered leaning her head against his chest, Chavez pulled his arms around her and held her for a few moments until they both heard Doc calling for them then they were forced to let go and follow the others. \"Sheriff, at the risk of offending you, you're newspaper man is hindering an important government an important government operation. I have to request that he be discharged from service,\" Poe commented to Pat as the watched Ash get off of his horse. \"Good thing it's the Sheriff's decision whether he be discharged or not, Mr. Poe. That newspaper man could be the only way that anyone will ever know the real story of the hunt for the most infamous man in New Mexico,\" a voice sounded behind the two men and they turned to see Deputy Murphy walking through an opening in the abandoned structure. Poe rolled his eyes, \"Why don't you go find somewhere to play, boy, while the grown ups talk.\" Aaron glared at the man with dark hating eyes, \"Like it or not, Mr. Poe, I am an officer of Lincoln County and I would like you to address me as such, are we clear?\" The two men stared at each other for a moment before Poe turned away and Aaron started to walk back to his horse. Ash came up beside him, buckling his belt as he went, \"So I never asked you, Mr. Murphy, why did you tag along on this expedition?\" Aaron turned and smiled a friendly smile at the newspaper man which made Ash's stomach turn, \"Well, you see, Sir,\" Aaron started, \"I'm here to catch me some Wildcat and I'm not leaving till I have a scalp hanging from my belt.\" Just the, Pat climbed onto his horse and announced they were headed north. Aaron looked back at Ash, \"Shall we, Ash?\" Ash just nodded numbly and climbed onto his horse. Hi guys! I am so sorry it's been so long with trying to get stuff done for college and all that everything has been really hectic. Again I apologize but I'm going to try and be faster on getting the rest of the chapters out but I hope you all will help me with something. If I do end up getting behind please someone yell at me and tell me to get on the ball. Well thank you to everyone who reviewed hopefully you got the previews! Well thank you all so much! Bye![Chapter 6] I do not own the movie Young Guns 2 nor do I own any of its copyrights. The ride to White Oaks, a small town in the New Mexico territory, was a short one but with the enemy always at your back it feels like an eternity. As Billy's \"gang\" rode into the city limits the arrived at a sign which read, \"White Oaks. We will not tolerate scum.\" Tom cocked his head to the side, he struggled for a moment with the words then looked at Billy, \"What's scum?\" Billy smiled slightly, \"Well Tom, that's bad types. Politicians, bankers, cattle kings. Scum,\" he flashed a grin the nodded his head toward the road, \"Come on.\" They all moved forward and Doc coughed, \"He's going to corrupt that boy for the worst mark my words.\" As they all began to ride through the town, the people began to notice. Some of them where so shocked they actually stopped in their tracks to stare at the procession. Passing a dress boutique, two young ladies stared up at Ember as she rode by. Their hair was all pretty and tied in the new fashion and their dresses were things to die for. The two women stooped their heads and began to whisper gently sending looks at the pale red head on the horse. Already Ember wished she had put on her coat before they had rode into town; her face was also turning a bright shade of pink. \"Ember, you sick?\" Hendry leaned asked as he leaned toward her. Blinking Ember was about to answer when Dave turned around, \"Yeah Princess you look flushed? Shall we stop and get you chilled refreshment from yonder establishment,\" he commented with his best fake rich accent. Ember grinned radiantly, \"Only if I get to pick out your new dress, Mr. Rudabaugh, because since we've been riding all I've heard you do is bitch,\" at the end she winked. Dave's faced darkened to an angry red color and he was going to yell but he was also cut off this time by Billy's laugh, \"Oh come off it Dave. She got you there. Besides we're here.\" They all stood in front of a large white house that looked to for a rich banker instead of a whore house. Doc cleared his throat, \"Looks like Ms. Greathouse has moved up on the financial ladder.\" \"H-How do you reckon she did that?\" Hendry questioned. Chavez shrugged, \"She was very good at aiming a gun in the dark.\" Both Tommy and Hendry's mouths fell open and Ember rolled her eyes, \"Chavez don't scare them. Besides she was a poison master not a gun slinger,\" she slipped off her horse and followed the rest of them up the steps. Tommy and Hendry a few steps behind her glancing nervously at the windows of the white house. As the approached the door they noticed it was slightly open so they entered. Inside a small colored boy stood in the corner next to the bar but they didn't have time to ask him to fetch the owner of the establishment for she was headed straight for them. \"Well I'll be hogtied and sent to Hades. Billy,\" the woman threw herself into Billy's arms and hugged him fiercely; then she looked at the others with a giant smile on her face, \"What have we got here? Wicked boys?\" she hugged Doc, \"four, five, six wicked boys.\" Finally Jane's eyes found Ember's, \"And one wicked feline,\" she grinned. Ember smiled then hugged Jane tightly, \"Good to see you, Jane,\" Jane hugged back and they shared the longest hug out of all of them but then Jane held Ember at arm's length to look at her. \"You look awful dear,\" she said wryly, \"Your husband over there deserves better but I can fix that later,\" then she turned to Billy, \"Wicked and wanted or just plain wanted?\" Billy grinned as the subject turned to him, \"Got a thousand dollars on me,\" he told her. \"Really, I heard five hundred.\" \"You heard wrong, Jane,\" Billy explained as he took a drink of his glass of whiskey that had been passed out to all of them. A small laugh escaped Jane's lips, \"Well, I hears you aren't long for the territory, Billy.\" \"We aren't,\" Doc cut in as he stared Billy down, \"Going to old Mexico right Billy,\" this was not a question this was an agree-and-we-have-no-problems statement. Billy just nodded as Jane spoke again, \"Well good luck.\" Ember moved her way over to the couch and sat in a free seat bedside Tom and this is where Jane's eyes narrowed in on the young boy, \"How old is this fellow?\" Tom began to answer truthfully but Billy said seventeen. Jane got a surprised look on her face, \"Fourteen and a half? Well don't forget that half there's a lot of experience packed into that half.\" Ember was surprised Jane didn't make a fuss over Tom's age but she was just like Billy: wide eyes, adventurous, bold, and sometimes just damn stubborn. Billy looked around and began to speak about how everything was different. Jane fussed about her hair and Ember watched as she did so. Jane's eyes never left Billy's form for a moment. She watched him with admiration and love. The love could have been confused with lust but Ember wasn't so sure. Billy on the other hand looked at Jane every now and then but his eyes always seemed to wander and then stray back. Taken aback, Ember shook her head mentally, \"He doesn't realize what he could have if just asked the right questions. I knew he was a damn fool but not this much of one.\" \"Well I've heard enough,\" Dave finally interrupted, \"My boys would like some bundah upstairs right quick darling.\" Ember took a sip of her whiskey, and watched as Jane advanced on Dave, \"Did I hear you say you wanted an excellent malt six times served with a room with a southern view,\" she corrected and Ember couldn't control herself and had to laugh out loud. \"You're related to the manor born, Jane. To the manor born,\" Doc handed Jane a glass and raised his glass in a toast. \"Well thank you Mr. Scurlock,\" said Jane as she smiled then downed her whiskey just a good as any man. Tom stared in amazement because he could barely get a single sip down. Jane placed her glass on a table then gestured to the ladies behind her, \"My girls will take very good care of you. Make yourselves at home, except you,\" she pointed to Ember. The paler red head didn't look up from her glass, \"The boy won't get into any trouble I can assure you that, Jane.\" Rolling her eyes, Jane crossed the room and grabbed the shot of whiskey from Ember and placed it into Tom's free hand, \"I have every bit of confidence the boy can handle himself without you holding his hand. What I'm more worried about is what you decide to wear,\" she eyes the ripped sleeves of Ember's sleeves,\" You will never make a proper lady that way.\" A large laugh escaped Ember, \"Yes and opening my own whore house will solve my problem's there? No thanks Jane I like myself the way I am,\" she grabbed the whiskey back from Tom and drank the whole thing in one gulp. \"Yes, well that is a fine while you are riding a horse across the border but in my establishment you will dress the way I advise. Now upstairs,\" Jane commanded. Ember sighed, \"Fine but one more thing,\" she grabbed Tom's glass this time and shot the bitter liquid back with ease then stood already feeling a buzz in her head. Then she followed Jane up the stairs. \"I really really hate you, Greathouse,\" Ember growled as she stared at herself in the full length mirror. Jane walked around the bed on the other side of the room, \"Why? I think you look rather fetching,\" she smiled, grabbed a brush and started to run it through Ember's hair. Ember never looked away from her reflection. She was now wearing a tight, black, lace corset with matching underwear. Her hair was down and the strings were pulled painfully tight and breathing was nearly impossible. Worst of all, Ember felt completely naked even under the skimpy clothing. \"I look ridiculous cut them off,\" Ember hissed at Jane. Jane eyes her in the mirror, \"Absolutely not. This is the finest silk and lace money can buy. There done,\" Jane back away from Ember's hair and admired her handiwork, \"Amazing what a few strokes of a brush can do.\" Ember eyed her hair. It did look nice better than it had, \"I'd rather carry a knife than a brush,\" she moved to the bed and sat down, \"Why exactly am I wearing this?\" Sitting down beside the tired looking girl, Jane took Ember's hands in hers, \"Because you deserve a night with your husband, and I am going to give it to you.\" Bright green eyes widened, \"You want me to walk in front of Chavez with this on? Woman have you lost you damn mind?\" Jane's chin lifted slightly, \"No, but I do know more about pleasing men than you and he's been staring at you hungrily for hours. Do you know how hard it is to get you two separated?\" \"You're evil do you know this?\" A laugh sounded in the air, \"I make my life on being evil darling. I do own one of the devil's inns,\" with this Jane winked then pulled Ember to her feet, \"Now let's get this started.\" Ember began to beg now, \"Jane. Please, let me just put pants on, please. I can't go in there looking like this.\" They arrived at a door and Ember froze, \"Don't be cruel please,\" she whispered. Jane ran her hand once more through Ember's hair then leaned to where she could whisper in her ear, \"You are the Wildcat you can do this. And if you can't please your husband with this I will certainly burn this place to the ground and go to church like the old biddies in this town. Now go!\" with that Jane opened the door and pushed Ember through and shut the door with one fluid motion. It took a moment for Ember to adjust to the lighting before she realized Chavez was sitting on the bed. His shirt was off and he only had his trousers on. His dark eyes glinted in the candlelight as he watched her by the door. \"I will hang Jane for this come morning,\" Ember thought. Looking for a moment at her husband, Ember finally let out a loud sigh, \"Do not say a word this was not my idea,\" she confessed. Slowly, Chavez stood and began to walk toward her, \"I swear if I ever have to power to outlaw corsets I will make sure every one of them is burned at the steak. I mean look at this I look like, like, well a whore,\" she kept rambling and Chavez kept walking. As he was nearly close enough to touch she looked up at him, \"Chavez,\" he hadn't said anything, not one stupid comment or a compliment, \"are you alr-\" Her question was broken off by Chavez pressing his lips to her, harder than he had ever done, and pressing her against the door. At first, she was too shocked to do anything then she came back to Earth and kissed him off. Chavez broke the kiss first and looked down at his pale wife; her bright green eyes stared up at with nervousness and uncertainty in herself shining through. He slid one hand down her cheek barely touching it but Ember felt it all the same. The touch sent a shiver running down her back. When he reached her jaw, he removed his hand and moved it behind her head. Ember was lost until she heard the click if the lock fall into place. She kept looking into his eyes this time with a questionable look. \"No distractions right now,\" he answered her, \"tonight you're mine,\" and with that he kissed her again, but this time Ember didn't waste any time to respond. Without looking, Chavez yanked Ember up and placed her on his hips as he began to walk backwards. The next thing Ember knew was she was on her back, on the bed with Chavez leaning over her. They stared at each other for a few moments, his hair creating a curtain around their faces. With one hand she cupped his cheek and he leaned into it, closing his eyes. With his other hand he took her hand and moved it to his mouth. He kissed each one of her fingertips, then her palm, her wrist, the middle of her arm, the crook of her elbow, her forearm. He kissed her shoulder and leaned further over her and began to kiss her collar bone. Ember's eyes began to flutter as he kissed her. He moved up to her neck and around her jaw, finally he got to her ear, \"I have missed you,\" he whispered. Opening her eyes, Ember looked at Chavez, \"I missed you more, but I'm not going anywhere anymore,\" she whispered back then leaned up and kissed him, softly but passionately. By this time the candle had gotten smaller but was still there, sending their elongated shadows upon the wall, and kept it light where they could just see each other's faces as they reunited once more. I believe huge apologies are in order. It has taken me a very long time to finally get this out but I have be going through a rut but I promise I'm back and I'm here to stay as you read this I am going to go start the next chapter and try and get a chapter up almost every few days at the very least one a week. Thank you all for the loving reviews. You all are the reason I decided to come back so thank you thank you so much. ","Summary":" Whoohoo! Welcome to the sequel of The Unknown Regulators: The Wildcat Returns! Please know that I d"},{"Movie":"Batman: Under the Red Hood","Title":"Third Time's the Charm","Author":"Deathwriter42","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9703524","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Welcome to another new story, and to those waiting on others don't worry I'm working. Just had to get this out of my head before I explode! Disclaimer: No, don't own any characters from the DC universe. This is fan based and it's meant to be fun. The ringing in his ear from the explosion still ran through his head as he trudges down unused alleys. Fortunately for him he wasn't bleeding obsessively, but most of the pain he suffers from comes from internal injuries like broken bones and strained muscles. He had worst though. There was the night of his murder is one, and the night of his resurrection is a close top as well. But now, he doesn't know what he's feeling and sees no reason to keep going. From a distance he can hear the sirens going off from first responders and soft traffic sounds coming from behind the tall brick walls. He finally falls as he trips over some trash bags from an overfilled dumpster (people, you must recycle! Half of that shit is recyclable!) and lands hard face first. Slumping up against the wall, he finds no strength to get up again and gives in to the darkness. In the phase between life and death, he could hear footsteps coming his way. ' A woman ' he thought as the clicking of heels gets closer and stops a few feet away from him. Those said heels now run towards him, and said person starts to shake him. \"Hey dude, wake up! You'll catch your death if you sleep out here.\" The voice held true concern, a rarity in this city full of strangers, as she tries to get him back from the world beyond. He shakes her off and tries, to no avail, to shift away from the warm hand. \"Shut up, I don't need you to tell me that.\" His voice came out cold and cracked, giving himself extra points for not sounding weak and in need; but with life just loving to suck ass, he moved the wrong way and let out a struggled breath. She obviously caught this sign, and through the dim lighting of the ally she could see some bones poking out here and there. \"Damn, you're hurt aren't you. Come on, we need to get you to a hospital.\" She attempts to get him up by using her body to hold him up, but he wouldn't have it. \"Fuck off, I don't need your help. If I die here, so be it.\" He shoves her off and he falls again. She huffed as she crossed her arms, pondering on what to do. \"No way in hell. You're not dying right in front of my home.\" She tries to pick him up again, but the size difference between the two of them becomes a big issue for her. \"Do you know how rank the smell of death is in the morning? Get the hell up.\" Again, he shakes her off and they both fall to the ground. He wipes sweat from his forehead as frustration starts to build up within him. That frustration brought new energy as he was now able to stand up, her following, and he easily beat her on height as well. \"There's no fucking way I'm going to a god damn hospital.\" The air around the woman felt like she's also becoming very frustrated. ' Stubborn bitch, ' he thought as there's no sign of her giving up. \"I told you to leave me the fuck alone and- ow, did you actually just kick an injured person?\" He holds his shin as the pain subsides, but he falls from lost of balance. Her face holds a triumphant smirk. \"Yes I did, now get off your fucking lazy ass and come on. You won't survive an hour in this city if you're like this. I know life is a bitch, but we're all damned and fucked, so just rely on a little charity once in a while.\" \"You don't even know what's it like to survive. I bet your just a prissy spoiled brat thinking you're all that just because you're raised in one of the most dangerous cities in this country. Don't even joke about the shit that goes on around here.\" \"Ya, I know what's it like here. Now just shut up and let me help you.\" \"Why help a scummy stranger like me. Better for you to let me die here.\" \"I said to shut your fucking mouth the hell up! Unlike others around here I have a blood conscious.\" Before he could spew out another line of cusses back at her, he feels a hard impact hit him on his neck before fading into the dark numbness. To what felt to him like a few seconds past, real time it was mid afternoon, he woke to face a ceiling and smell of food lingering throughout the air space. The smell made his stomach whine since he hasn't really had a decent meal ever since he retuned from Death's grasps, but looking around made him couscous as he didn't recognize this alien place he finds himself in at the moment. To top it off, he didn't have a shirt on and couldn't find any of the weapons he still had on him from the explosion. He lay on an old lumpy bed, and he could easily feel that his wounds were bounded and wrapped in a very skillful manner so that movement wasn't a threat to him. There's also a soft humming of a melody coming from the same direction as the scent of fresh food. Jason finally sat up and paused to let the blood return to its normal circulation, not knowing that the minimum sound from his movements has alerted the other person just on the other side of the door. When he stood on his feet, a sudden pain from his shoulder cries and he couldn't help the soft moan that escaped from his cracked lips. \"Sorry I couldn't do much for your shoulder. If I moved you, you would have woken up.\" He was startled. Even on his worst day, it was hard for anyone to be able to sneak up on this former vigilante. He turns to the voice he recognizes as the same girl from last night, and his emerald eyes lock with crystal blue eyes. The haze of the pain and dim lighting now clear allows him to get a better look at the person who supposedly saved him from Death's front door. There was something about her that reminded him of someone, but he couldn't put the pieces together. Physical features of her is a lean short woman that could easily be mistaken for a child if she dressed like one. She's pretty, but saying gorgeous was pushing it, more like she'll make a perfect mom figure. Her black hair is in a messy pony tail, and wearing what'll typically be called a lazy day outfit. As he a analyzed her, she walks towards him silently to a nightstand just beside him covered with gauze and medicine. \"Here. If you don't want it to hurt that much anymore, then let me wrap it up.\" Two voices screamed through his head; one saying to let her help him with his injury, while the other cusses and yells for him to get out of there. But with a slight shift of his arm gave the first voice the win and left her to quickly wrap his limp. They were both silent as she finished, and he could feel a little better about accepting her help. With silence playing in the air, she packed the materials away as he looked through the window for a beautiful view of Gotham bay. He was lost in thought when she spoke, her voice dragging him out of the deep caverns of his brain. \"Can you walk? Or do you want to eat your food here?\" He didn't turn to face her, she almost doubted that he heard her. A few seconds past without a response, so she starts to head out the door when he responds with a question, \"Why'd you help me?\" Looking over her shoulder, she could see that he wasn't facing her still. \"If you think I'll pay you back to show how grateful I am, don't hold your breath. I'm penny-less and there's no where in hell will I ever be a sex toy.\" Without even looking, he could tell that she felt pissed about his last retort. But her voice showed patience, calmness and warmth, \"Whatever happened to just helping out another human being?\" She turns to open the door, but she has to throw one more thing out before she heads into the other room, \"And I can get a dick anywhere. There's no way I'll ask for some from a street rat.\" She left and closed the door, cutting off the next words about to jump out of him. Again, she left with being able to say the last word. A total stranger. He always had the last word. Only a few others know how to leave him speechless, but this is the second time she left before he could say anything, and that pissed him off. The hunger also fuelled his anger, and the effects of that lagoon is still fresh inside his mind. ' This bitch doesn't know the danger she's in. Maybe I should scare her a bit. ' A smirk slowly came to his face as he pictured the look on her face when he tells her. But then a little thing called his conscience got to him, and he decided against it. Before he could change his mind again, he walked to the window and opened it. The air wasn't the freshest, but it's open and free. Better then inside the cramped apartment. Looking down was a five story drop, but he jumped higher rooftops and this little jump would only have leave small damages to his already broken body. Just at the moment his left leg goes off the ledge, she choose to come in with a tray of food. The normal response would be to drop the tray and run to help, but her's just landed on an arched brow and she calmly places the food down on a desk just beside the door. \"Really? You're actually planing on jumping a five story window with those injuries? It's either you're damn careless about your own health, or you're amazingly stupid.\" He forced himself not to sigh or say anything that could lead her to calling the cops, \"Look, don't take this the wrong way but if I stay here, you'll be in trouble.\" He turns away, getting ready to slip through the window, \"So, with that in mind-\" Without him noticing, she appears behinds him and cuts him off. \"Do you really think I'm stupid?\" She grabs his uninjured shoulder, and with surprising strength, pulls him back in. \"Say any excuse you want, but you'll die out there. Even a skilled fighter knows their own weakness. And this is yours.\" She lightly touches one of his bandages and a surge of pain flows throughout his body. \"Did you even think about what might happen if you didn't land properly? You'd be paralyzed at best.\" He picks himself up without her help, and glares her down. His height gives him extra intimidation, but that still hasn't fazed her. \"If you knew who I really am then you'll think twice about helping me and having me in here.\" \"Try me.\" She smirked, showing no fear of who he might be. \"You've been awake for a while and there's no problem.\" He took a step closer, and hardens his glare. Most people would shrivel at the air around him, but she stood just as tall and unaffected by his stance. He was impressed with her bravery, but that alone wouldn't help her against him. \"And if I were to tell you I'm the Red Hood?\" Once the words flew out of his mouth, he expected her to feel scared and easily kicked him out, but he got a much different reaction. \"If you are, then why don't you kill me?\" She turned around and went to the night stand again. In the drawer came out his gun and he can clearly see his other weapons in the same drawer. She took the gun out and tossed it to him. \"If you really are who you say you are, then you'll need this.\" There's wasn't even a hint of hesitation in her words, it was like she was just talking about the weather or what's for dinner. \"But if you're really sure about going out, and if you really are who you say you are, then you're a dead man even without your injuries. There's a lot of people out for your head.\" He was torn with leaving and facing his death, to staying for an uncertain fate. Looking into her eyes gave no hint of whats in her mind. It reminded him of a formal life, where he'd blindly follow a code he feels he'll always question. \"Are you actuatlly saying that you'll care of a total stranger, and one that could protentionally be a murder? And on the top of not only the police's list, but even the Batman's list.\" He inwardley smirked, curious of what her answer be. \"Even if the chance of lengthing your life is right infront of you? Are you looking for protection, or do you just go for the bad boy type?\" Again, her response is something he would never guess. \"Do I really look like the desperate type? Besides, there's a whole range of 'bad boys' just outside this door. And if you think that you're that much of a big shot, then if you make me fall on my knees then I'll let you leave.\" Something shone in her eyes for a moment, but it was muddled and flashed dully. However, that one flash was enough. Enough to show that there wasn't any hidden motive to her kindness. But he couldn't trust it. He shouldn't. He knows nothing of this person infront of him, except that she's skilled in medical care and has a strong backbone. Also that famillure feeling he gets at just looking at her. Almost like a girl version of someone, but he couldn't place a strong guess on who. Other then that, she's a total stranger. And the quote ' stranger dange r' was beat into the minds of children ever since they were allowed to get out of the house, but not him. Strangers were never a problem to him, the police was one, but never strangers. Still broken between the choices of leaving and staying, her bargin would be easy. Just the fact of hurting an innocent person, even a woman smaller then him, still effected him. Even through the whole ordeal of being a crime lord by force and fear, he still wanted to protect the innocent. But this situation called for the use of force. \"I'll take you up on your offer.\" A smirk graced her lips as if she was expecting him to say exactly that, \"Good. Now choose. Attack first or defend?\" Confusion painted his featured, thinking how crazy it was for her to let him choose how this fight went. ' Well, it'll be an easy win. ' He thought, knowing full well that he'll be able to take her down even with his injuries, and he'll be scott free. Without even saying anything, he went for the direct charge and throws in a fast left hook. Making contact, the results as always wasn't what he was expecting. His fist made contact, yes, but not where he was aiming for. She somehow managed to catch his arm without even a moments hesitation to what could happen if she wasn't fast enough. He retrated his arm to his side, and glared a bit at her cockey grin. \"You're actually skilled.\" He sneered as her smirk deepened. \"You need skill that'll match your core in this city. And my core is rock solid.\" Not even wasting a second, he went in for another attack which she easily blocked. This went on a little longer, him aiming at all her open areas and attacking, only for her to easily block him in that last second. Neither side was giving in, until she finally decided to end it. The final punch was thrown and again she caught it, only the difference from then and now is the fact that she grabbed hold of his arm and shifted both of their weight. Resulting in him being carried off his feet and flipping ontop of the bed, which was right behind her. A trumpant smirked fell on her again, placing her hands on her hips and looking very pleased with the result. \"And you wanted to go out in the streets again. You can't even beat someone my size.\" She stuck out her hand for him and he accepted her offer. A sense of respect fell between the two, that fight held a lot of meaning between the lines. It showed their personalities and their true intention, and in a way it has brought them both on common ground. Though the idea of being easily taken down by a woman the size of a girl did hurt his pride, he knew that he wasn't at his best and there was obvious signs that this woman wasn't even trying her hardest. In a way, it made the situation interesting. Usually women would be an open book to him, or be total obvious about their interest in him that it'll be very annoying, very fast. But not only did she show no interest in him; the more he learns about her, the more questions forms. He wondered for a second if he got that trait from HIM, but shook that thought out. It might just be because she's different from all the others he's met, and it's natural curiosity that has him wanting to stay. Or maybe, he was sick and tired of being on the streets and hiding. Always on the move. Always on edge. Maybe here, he could actually start over again. Be normal for once in his life. Get a job, find a home and maybe settle down. Just maybe he could erase everything and just be Jason Todd, or someone else since that Jason Todd to the public is dead and not alive by some weird ancient water. Either way, he just feels like it would be better to stay here then out there. Sure it's unclear if this will be the right choice or not, but he's willing to take this chance. It's a 50/50 shot. What does he have to lose? His life? He shouldn't even be breathing or feeling pain. At least this choice looks like he'd be taken care of and no certain death. Yet. Well that's it for now. Tell me what you think, and if you want more. The results of the reviews will show next week. I'm gonna try again for a weekly update, but in order to do that I need the reviews from you guys. I hope I can see you all next weeK![Chapter 2] I still want to do this story, and really the ideas are just fun. So anyone up for some fun please read along! Disclaimer: No, don't own any characters from the DC universe. This is fan based and it's meant to be fun. It's been a couple weeks since Jason was dragged from the alley to a warm bed, and he's been healing fine. He's gotten plenty of rest from her strict orders, and now all that's left are a few bruises. Their routine would be what you'll call normal, but there's only one thing that's out of the ordinary. Jason still doesn't know the name of this girl. Not like he's given her an actual introduction, she just addresses him as Red and he'd just use the usual 'hey you' to call her. It was like they have a formal agreement that names were strictly off limits. But it was ok, since names would soon get you attached to something, and he didn't want anymore attachments that should never have been made. Another thing that bothered him was how quiet that girl is. There'd be times when he's looking for her and turns out she's not even in the apartment, then out of nowhere she'd appear like she'd never left. There was one time in the middle of the night she left. He heard her leave the silent apartment at around midnight and come back near dawn. There was heavy breathes, deadly cusses, and metal clanging on the floor. But when he got up to see what was going on, she disapperared into her room at the opostie end of the apratment and never found his answers. And just around an hour later, he sees her walking around like she haven't been up all night doing whatever she does. He could also see that under her clothes seemed to hide bandages that covered most of her body. ' That could explain why she's good at medical care in America .' He thought, examining what little he could see of her wounds. Speaking of wounds, there's one he noticed that's a slight scar. It's small and unnoticeable, but he got a glance when she was cooking. Her hair was put up as always and he was in the small kitchen to help as much as he can. That's when he sees the two small holes on her neck, they were almost bite like. The location was at the back of her neck and just a little under her hairline, making the mark even more harder to spot. If he wasn't trained to see every detail he'd easily missed it. Other then those shall we say 'abnormalities,' she's like any other girl that lives in the ghettos of Gotham. There looks to be like a steady income seeing as all the utilities work and the apartment is big enough for the both of them to have their own space; however, there's no sign of a uniform or any kind of job that could have a decent wage to be able to pay for everything. Well, anything legal at least. Some guess were either that she's in the prostitution or hostess business. Or she could be part of a gang or underground mafia. Either is a good guess, seeing as she's able to defend herself easily. But they're not sitting with him very well. Though it would explain why she's able to stand a said killer to be staying in her private residence and her late night excursions, there's no evidence at all that she does those sort of things. So yes, he has many questions and little answers. He could get answers the usual way and look through her room just opposite of his, but something was stopping him. It wasn't guilt, he felt that before and in the past he'd look into people's personal life all the time. He even did it to his guardian. But when he gets close to the door when he knows she's outside doing whatever she's doing, something pulls him away. He guessed that it was his instincts telling him that that door should never be opened. That the answers he's looking for is something he should never know. His instinct was strong enough to stop him from finding answers, but not wanting to find the answers. Sitting on the windowsill in the living room, he watches the steady movement down below as he tries to piece together what he knows of his so called 'saviour.' Without him noticing, she stood just in front of him. Her head tilted slightly to the side as she studied him for a second. Before she could get too lost in thought and forget what she was doing, she pokes his cheek to get his attention. Normally she'd expect a person to jump from shock from being that deep in thought; but getting to know him a little, she knows that it'll take much more then a little touch of skin to have him jump. ' Or maybe he's just good at hiding his true emotions. ' She thought as a final note. Jason turns to face her, knowing full well that it's her from her signature signal of getting his attention. \"Hey, you ok?\" As usual, she showed concern for him. \"You look like you're about to explode from whatever you were thinking of.\" He gives her a cocky grin, \"And you think the best way is to bug me? What if I was going through a rage and snapped? Your neck would have been the next thing that'll snap.\" As always there's no fear in her eyes or regret on her face. She rolls her eyes and sits on the other side of the windowsill. \"Well sorry for trying to be helpful. You've been like that for almost an hour and you looked like you weren't going anywhere. I thought I might help.\" He reads her eyes and see nothing hidden. Quickly he thinks of different scenarios that could happen if he asks, so his safest bet would be just to find out her name. At least it's a different turn from just saying 'you' all the time. Just an easy question, but the outcome is not to his liking. \"What's your name?\" By the looks of it, it looks like she'll burst from holding in her laugh. A bit ticked off, he glares daggers at her. \"I'm being serious. I've just been calling you without a name, and even after all this time I don't know it.\" She tries to calm her laughing to a chuckle before answering. \"Really? You want to know my name even though you haven't even told me yours? You're kind of skipping steps here.\" He opens his mouth to answer, but then closes it again knowing that she was right. Why should she tell him her name when he didn't even do the same? She sees that he wasn't really satisfied with the answer so she decides to give him a bone. \"If it really bugs you that much, then just call me Jay. It's a name I go by with friends.\" Jay. Reading her gives no hint on whether it's really her name or not, but it's better then nothing. He sticks out his hand for her to take and they both shake hands. \"Well Jay, it's nice to finally get a name.\" It felt weird to him to call someone by the same name he used to have. She smiles in a joking manner, but the smile was true. \"It's nice to meet you too Red. Hope we can get along.\" It's around 2 in the afternoon now, and it's time to change the bandages again. Everyday he's improving and it felt like his time here would soon come to an end. Jay quickly finished wrapping Red up again, and he went back to staring out of the window. It's their usual routine and they've gotten used to each other's company, maybe a little too used to it now. While he stares out the window and somewhat 'rest' Jay gets busy with whatever goes through her mind. Today she just decides to watch some TV and rest before she has to go later. Not even paying attention to what's being shown, she thinks that it's a police drama or something, she plays back the events of the previous days. A question always plays again through her head, why did she help him? Out of all the people there on the street, she helps him. She doesn't quite get it herself seeing as it doesn't take a Sherlock to know that he could have taken care of himself. It bugged her this whole time, it was like a in the moment decision. Ya, she wanted him away from her house so she wouldn't wake up to rotting flesh the next morning, but helping was never part of the agenda. There was just something that pulled her into helping him. She considered that maybe she found him attractive, but then again she's met a lot of people that could easily pass him in the look factor so she crossed that out. There was no relation to between them, but this event. Which would soon end and they'll become strangers again. Then again, it wouldn't be that bad seeing as she doesn't want her secret to be out. Most of her life forced her into questioning everything and sit back and watch everything play out until there's a definite chance of winning and survival. But she broke every rule she swore to and let a total stranger to come into her home, and almost get caught with her late night activities. After that one night of almost getting caught, she just climbs in and out of her bedroom window to lessen the chance of getting caught. It's a pain, but then again life was never going to go her way, not with this secret holding her down. Maybe he could help her get out of this mess, but she shook that plan out of her head knowing that she shouldn't get anymore people involved. Plus he claims to be a major crime lord, even if he hasn't done anything to her and if that rumor is that he doesn't hurt innocent people, there's still that danger of the truth being spilled. And she knows that if the truth were to leak then blood would soon follow. There's too much blood lost, so she choose the path without much blood the best she can. Taking a quick peek with her peripheral vision she examines him. He's a good fighter and she can easily tell that he's well trained. She remembers back to the night she first met him and how beat up he looked slumped on the wall. At first it looked like he was a dead body, but with a closer look he was barely breathing. That's when something pulled her closer to confront him, she didn't even have a full control for some reason and that's when she got him up, at least she had control of what she said, it was like there was a little voice in her head forcing her to help him and before she knew what she was doing she got him in her brother's room. Now her life isn't that lonely. There's someone here even if she doesn't know much about him. Well no, the truth was that she used to be totally normal. She had parents, an older brother and a great family that was never related to her. But that all changed in that one night she was pronounced dead along with her family. What the police didn't know was that she and her brother survived, but they had to change their name and their whole life went downhill from there. At least they were together from then till a few years ago. Those few years was when she was totally alone in this apartment. Even though she has what people would call 'friends' just outside the doors, she kept her distance because of the secret just hidden behind her eyes. She learned to lie, cheat and kill throughout the years, and even though her brother tried his best to stop her from going down that path, they both knew that they both need those skills in order to survive their new lives. Her eyes itched as she stared at the screen, and her vision began to blur. Quickly, she blinked the coming tears away as discreet as she can and kept her face calm. Thinking about her brother, the only one that knew what she was going through and her only confidant, is scarring as it'll always result in her seeing his body. His body was hung by a rope around his neck and it was badly beaten, burned and slashed with both whips and knives. She could tell by the look on his face was he's gone through hours of torture before they finally let him rest for eternity. The warning from the others still rang through her skull, \" Don't think we're not watching you. \" the whispers from the dark would haunt her for the next couple of nights before she finally deemed it safe to return to the home she kept secret from the others. Here they wouldn't find her, here at least she was safe from the eyes. A cool breeze danced through the room and a quick glance to Red shows that he opened the window. Throwing him a questioning look he just smirks and jumps out. He does that sometimes, but for some reason he always comes back. The wounds on his body is less intense now, and this window was only a two story drop to the next roof top, so a well trained person wouldn't get hurt. Sometimes she'll watch him jump from rooftop to rooftop until he disappears, from watching she can tell that he wasn't your regular criminal. The guns she got off him was also custom made and was absolutely flawless. The scary part was that it fit him so well that maybe he was trained to be a hunter. She'd be lying if she said that the thought of him being sent out to kill her never came to her, it did show itself at the times in the beginning but she was reassured with the fact that he was hurt and she could easily beat him down. But when he got to the point where the injuries wouldn't stop him, she worried that she'd find herself with a bullet somewhere if she wasn't careful. A couple days past then and still she's breathing life, and there's no sign of him planning to kill her. The thought that maybe he was waiting till she fully trusts him was also fresh, and it's clear that he could easily overpower her when she wasn't ready, but still nothing happened. ' Maybe he asked for my name to confirm that I'm his target, but then again he might actually be Red Hood and is just looking for more information for himself. ' She thought as she got up and turned the TV off. ' I should go grocery shopping for dinner. There's always too much of a rush when office workers get off. ' With that in mind, she slipped out of the door like a normal person. Jason flies over the rooftops and feels better as the air whips his face. Sometimes going through the skies reminds him of the old days from before everything was screwed up. To the world again, he was dead. Maybe he can start over like he thought at that first night, but then he needs to find a job and get an ID for his new name. Jay looks like she's got some sort of network, maybe she can help him. Then again she helped him a lot already and he doesn't want to trouble her anymore. He still has his pride. He finds a roof in an isolated area and gets down to the streets. It helps him clear his mind and it's something to do instead of staying inside. Walking down the streets where you could find deals going on also remind him of a former life. Placing his hands in his jacket, or more like in Jay's brother's jacket ( he could tell that it was a touchy subject so he never asked what happen ), he feels like another citizen of this big city. He wasn't some vigilante's sidekick or a crime lord looking out for revenge anymore, just some man who's walking down the street to some destination. Maybe this time he'll just be part of the crowd and be a model citizen. He did have two lives worth of action and danger, so now he just wants what people seem to take for granted. Taking a few turns around corners he finds himself in an area that's mixed of street thugs and honest people. Then there was a common screech coming from the back way of a grocery store. Without even taking a breath he finds himself running to where the voice was located. The moment he got there he had to stop to see if what he's seeing is really there. Before him is Jay covering a pregnant woman from five men each caring a rape face on them. One man charged to them and Jay easily caught his fits before she went in to break his nose. A second got behind her and tried to knock her from below, but she was too quick and jumped out of the way. \"Jay!\" Jason called as he snapped out of his shock. He comes running and takes on another two just behind their friends. They both work together in covering the pregnant woman and soon four of the five men are out for the count. Both of them turn to the last thug standing, he takes a gun out and aims at them. \"Don't move or I'll shot you!\" The thug commanded in a not so convincing tone. However, that didn't scare them and they both mirror each other's smirk. \"I'll do it! I'll actually shot you both dead!\" Jay had to hold back a chuckle as she gave Jason a side glance, \"What do you think Red? Fight or flight?\" He returned her all knowing amusement and threw the thug a sinister glance, \"Him flight, I fight.\" And before the thug could even think about pulling the trigger Jason quickly moved forward and knocked the gun out of his hands. A heartbeat later, the thug got knocked out and danger was avoid yet again. There was a moment of silent victory before the woman they protected cried out again, but this time it's for joy. She gave a quick hug to Jason and Jay, thanking them very loudly. \"Oh thank you so much. How can I ever thank you?\" \"There's no need to thank us.\" Jason smiled to the woman and she slightly blushed a bit. She giggled slightly as she got herself together, \"My would your children have charming parents.\" The woman elbowed Jay and gave her a knowing smirk, \"But I'm sure they'll become amazing people like the two of you.\" Jay gave the woman a confused look, \"What do you mean by that? I'm not even married.\" The woman threw back her head to laugh, \"Honey, in this day and age, the young get pregnant with just being in the same room as each other. Besides, I'm sure a couple like you will make a gorgeous baby together!\" The woman sang her last sentence before leaving to her car . Little did she know that she just left a ticking bomb called 'awkward' behind. \"What the...\" Jason started, his face feeling a few degrees higher then it should be. \"The hell?\" Taking a quick glance over Jay had her hands covering her face, but it was clear that her ears were bright red. He was going to say something when she stopped him with by sticking her hand out in like a stop sign, \"Don't even say anything.\" \"I wasn't going to.\" The silence was choking them from the tension and neither of them seemed to be able to break it. Sighing Jason decides to cut both of them some slack. \"Why don't we just forget about it? It's easier that way.\" Jay nods but there's still a hint of pink on her cheeks as she looks at him, \"So why are you here?\" Jay shrugs, \"You know, getting food for tonight.\" \"You need help?\" Jay tilted her head in a questioned glance, \"What? At least let me help around the house now, I'm able to move freely now.\" He starts to head to the store, \"Just consider this as pay back for helping me.\" Jay let out a soft chuckle as she rolls her eyes and follows him. The both of them got through the list quickly and just had to get milk and juice. But for some reason they decide to put them on the top shelf and out of reach of Jay. \"Why the fuck is it on the top today?\" (Ya, wonder why.) Trying hard to reach the one that's in the front, but of course it has to be in the middle of the shelf. During her struggle with the milk, Jason tries his best to hold in his laughter and the juice at the same time. Jay throws him a deadly glare when she takes a break from stretching. \"Really, you watch as a helpless girl struggles to get food?\" He walks up to the self and easily grabs it from the shelf, \"I'm only laughing because it's you.\" She gives him a good punch on the shoulder, but he just shrugs it off and continues to laugh as they head to the till. Even paying, they'd poke fun of each other and the people around them each thought that it looked like a good relationship. They didn't even notice that people were watching them, some even thought that maybe they were models or something. Outside they even fought about how much bags the other was carrying, \"Red, you're injured! You can't carry that many bags at ounce!\" \"I can carry as much as I want woman! You shouldn't have to carry this much.\" Jason grabs another two bags from her hands and she was left with the three lightest bags they have, \"Besides you're a girl.\" The moment those words came out of his mouth he regretted it. And he was right. Taking a quick glance, she could have killed him right then and there with just her stare. \"Really? Are you really going to be that douche?\" He gives her a weak apologetic smile and tries to sound as regretful as he can, \"Slip of the tongue, I swear that wouldn't happen again.\" Her glare only softened a bit, but he has a feeling that he's in the clear. For now. \"I'm sorry. It's all I can really do to pay you back for helping me. I don't have a job and there's a lot of people who'll love to see me dead, so I can't really do much but help around with little tasks.\" \"Fine.\" She sighs out as she slowly shakes her head, \"I'll let you have your male ego and help a damsel in distress.\" The last words were spewing with sarcasm that both of them just had to laugh. \"But really, you don't have to pay me back. People just need to be more kind with one another anyways.\" The rest of the walk back just became random conversation just to past the time and before they knew it they were back at the apartment building. As they were putting away the groceries Jason got the question out that he has been mulling over in his head. \"Hey Jay.\" He called out and she answers with a quick 'ya', \"Do you know if there's a place where I can work?\" Jay turns to him with her arms crossed as she thinks it over. \"Starting a new leaf Red?\" She arches her eyebrow as he nods and thinks again. \"And I'm guessing you don't have any form of identification on you.\" It wasn't a question, and they both knew that. \"I might have a place for you. We'll go there tomorrow after I call them.\" Was her final answer, and that was the end of that conversation. Well there you go! Now I want you guys to help by putting up suggestions on what Jason's fake name should be. Leave suggestions in reviews and this story will come back next week![Chapter 3] May I start this chapter off with a warning. Warning: Names will be an issue since Jason is now going by 3 names, and most of you might already know my style with names. If not, here's a cheat sheet. Jason: When it's in his point of view and not working Red: When it's in Jay's point of view DJ: When it's in his point of view and working As promised, Jay found a job that Jason could have even without all the legal stuff. It's noon on a wednesday and they were walking down a pretty high end street. Of course it's busy from the lunch rush, but with a turn of the corner the air around them became dead silent. \"So here's where you'll be coming in from. Berry doesn't like it when us street rats come in from the front.\" Jay points out like someone doing an orientation for a new comer. \"Did you pick out a name you'll be using? Your name tag should have a better name then Red. Unless you want to tell me your real name.\" Jason shakes his head and a small smile plays on his lips, \"Not a chance. I want to be able to forget my previous life.\" Jay pouts a little at not being able to know, \"Just call me DJ N. Daston now.\" She stops walking and starts to examine him. Since they were walking side by side, he soon walked in front of her. He soon noticed that she wasn't beside him and turns to look at her. \"What's wrong?\" \"Nothing. Just that the name's not really clicking with me.\" She shrugs and returns to his side, \"I'll just call you Red. To me it suits you better then DJ.\" Jason felt annoyed about her comment, \"What's wrong with DJ? It took me a while to think of a good name.\" Jay lets out a little laugh, \"Sorry, I didn't mean for it to sound insulting. There's nothing wrong with that name.\"They resume walking towards the back door, \"It's just that I'm used to calling you Red, and I might accidentally slip up when calling you by that name. Besides, this nickname could be like an inside joke for us.\" \"Haha, and the joke is I'm a former pro assassin.\" Jason retorted sarcastically as he rolls his eyes and Jay smiles while shrugging. \"Ok, move on from my name. What exactly is my job? Don't tell me I'm some host or some weird enjoyment for the rich.\" \"Well...\" Jay was at a lost of words as she tried to choose her words carefully. \"Jay!\" Jason yelled, scared that he might actually have to become a male pole dancer. Or worse. \"What? You needed a job!\" She looks at him, but doesn't really look him in the eye. \"And besides, it's not you'll do anything weird. You'll be a bartender.\" She also mumbled something else, and not being able to hear it clearly made him worry more. \"What is it Jay.\" It annoyed him that she wasn't being very direct like she usually is, and really it worried him a lot. Though he doesn't know much, he at least know that she usually won;t be like this unless its something that's really unpleasant. \"You'll sometimes...\" More mumbles come out of her mouth, and motions for her to speak up. Sighing she lets it all out quickly, \"Youmightgetaskedtobeacompanionforsometimesandactl ikeaposterboyfortheclub.\" It all came out in one breath, but he was able to catch it. She turns her eyes to the ground, looking really guilty. \"I know you don't want to have your face put up anywhere, but this is the only honest work you could do under your circumstances. Unless you don't mind being someone's sex toy. Berry can also get you a fake ID from his rich costumers.\" Jason looks at her and takes the information in. Sighing, he knows that there's not much to do for him and he should just accept it. \"It's ok. If it's just pictures then I don't mind. The press never got a good look at my face anyways.\" He shivered at the idea of being touched in weird places, \"But would I have to go to bed with them?\" Jay shook her head, still finding the ground very interesting. \"Well then all's good. The only problem is that I don't know a thing about bar tending, so I might get fired by my lack of skill.\" Jay dared to look Jason in the eye this time, \"Are you really ok with being a poster boy?\" Jason nods and tries to look ok with his new job, which Jay knows he's trying his best. \"If you're ok with that, I'm sure you wouldn't be fired. You'll learn fast since you're already good with your hands.\" Jason nods again and the door opens to a round man dressed in a three piece suit. There's a slight angry look in his eyes, but it could just be a regular stare for him. The round man looks at Jay and Jason felt the need to step in front of her to stop this man from eating her in one bite. And with the size difference between the two of them, it could totally be 100% possible for the man to gulp Jay down. \"Jay! You're two minutes late!\" (Don't you just love those kind of bosses?) The man barked, and Jay just returns with a business smile, \"12 o'clock means 12 o'clock! And I'm guessing this is the man who's looking for the job?\" Jason froze as the man looked him over, and a creepy smile played on this man's lips. \"Where do you find all these good looking men Jay? I thought you don't sleep around with men.\" \"Very funny Berry.\" Jay rolls her eyes and places her hand on her hips, getting back her usual confidence. \"This is my friend, DJ N. Daston, and like I said over the phone, he wants to start over again. So he needs a job to help him get started.\" Berry turns and goes back in, Jay and Jason follow behind and the smell food wraps around them. \"You two eat yet?\" Both Jason and Jay shake their head, and Berry ushers them to a booth in the back. \"Wait here, I'll get you something good. On the house.\" Without another word Berry left the two alone and disappeared into the kitchen. The restaurant slash bar, lounge has a rich feel to it, and the two were standing out like a sore thumb. The design has that of a regular lounge, off to the side there's a stage with a small drum set and a baby grand piano, while bar splits the room in two. There wasn't much light coming from the chandlers as most of the light is coming from the ceiling high windows on one wall. The whole room is dressed in black and silver, and holds a heavy mature feel to it. There's people in other tables dressed in suits and acting all sophisticated while they're dressed in jeans and shirts, looking like they just got off the streets. Even in the dim lighting, they could tell that the people are whispering something and they could feel some stares coming from other tables. \"Well, how do you like your new workplace?\" \"Will I be serving a bunch of princesses?\" Jay gives him a 'duh' face and he sighs, \"Is there any other job out there?\" She looks at him, jokingly insulted. \"Hey, bar-tending is an art. You're also not qulaified enough to be a gay prostitute.\" Jason glares at her, and she holds back a laugh. \"Ok, in retrospect a bar-tender makes good money from drunk tippers and this bar usually has loaded people coming in through those doors. Besides, Berry doesn't like to hire those with sketchy backgrounds unless it's profitable for him. So be grateful.\" Jason's eyes widen at a thought, \"Don't tell me you have to blow him for him to hire me. Cause I won't allow you to do that.\" Jay was drink her water when all of it spilled out of her mouth. \"No! Ew! No, Berry doesn't do that. He's 100% dedicated to his businesses and he's asexual. The only way for him to get hard is when he wins the money ball.\" They quickly wiped the water away with the cloth used to wrap the utensils. \"It's not what you think. I'm doing a favour for him every couple weeks, but I'm hoping that since he approves of your look then I wouldn't have to do it.\" Jason arches his brow at her, \"What is this so called favour?\" \"Hopefully you never have to find out.\" Jay smiles to reassure him, \"And no, it's nothing illegal. Just really embarrassing.\" Jason cracks a smile, leaning in hoping to hear more. \"Oh? What is it? You know you can tell me.\" \"No, I rather post a nude shot on the internet then have you find out.\" Of course it doesn't end his questions and it goes around in a circle. People stared again, but they didn't give a damn since they just had fun teasing each other. Soon the food comes out on the table, and their stomachs couldn't hold back their growls as their eyes laid on top of the high class spread. Without another word, they dig in stuff their face. Berry soon comes out again to their table. \"So how's the food?\" \"Amazing, as always.\" Jay smiles as she swallows a forkful of steamed vegetables. \"That's good.\" Berry then turns to Jason, \"So DJ, I need you to start working today. Shift starts at 4:30 and ends around 11. You won't be serving drinks since you're not trained yet, but you'll take orders and payment. I'll have Sean teach you how to mix drinks when we're not busy. You might also need to work as security detail and escort some drunks to a cab.\" Jason nods, making notes of the information he's been given. \"Jay gives lots of praise for you so you better not disappoint.\" He then turns to Jay to give her disappointing news. \"And Jay, about what we discussed earlier. I already advertised it for tonight so you're coming in at 7 and it'll go till 10. And don't worry, Venus will have everything you'll need for tonight.\" Jay groans as she puts her face in her hands, and Jason took this moment of distraction to ask Berry. \"So what is this favour that Jay has to do for you.\" Berry sees the mischief look in Jason's eyes, but before he could answer Jay recovers and glares at the two men. \"Don't even think about telling!\" Berry steps back with his hands showing he surrenders, but a smirk is gracing his lips. \"I wasn't going to. He'll find out tonight anyways.\" And with that he left without another word. The sky is still painted blue as Jason walks into the bar, dressed in his work clothes. It's a simple white dress shirt and bow tie under a grey vest, matched with black loafers and black slacks. Berry is the first one to greet him, \"Good, you're on time. You also seem used to getting dressed in formal attire, most people don't even know how to properly tie a bow tie nowadays.\" \"My father taught me how to do it. Says it makes a man look dignified.\" Jason straightens his tie and stands tall, remembering a time before. \"So, what's the first thing I need to do?\" Berry motions for 'DJ' to follow him and brings him to another man already wiping a glass. This man is about DJ's height and very clean cut. The man's dark brown hair was gelled back and his eyes had a hard glint to it. \"DJ this is Sean, your new mentor. Sean, DJ.\" The two men shook hands and scanned the other down. \"DJ, your job is to listen and learn as quickly as you can. And don't even think that mixing drinks is an easy job.\" With that, Berry pats DJ on the shoulder and leaves to the back of the room. When they were left alone, Sean chooses now to speak. \"So DJ, I hear from Berry that you're pretty good with hand coordinations.\" \"Ya, I've been trained in self defence since I've been young.\" Sean chews on that idea for a minute. \"I'm also pretty good with vehicle motors.\" \"Not really what I'm looking for, but at least you're good with your hands.\" Sean then starts to teach DJ the different stories behind some drinks and simple recipes that any amateur can make with a little practise. Sean of course wasn't easy with his teachings and made sure that every little detail would be perfect. Then came the dinner rush, and even with a weekday there's a lot of orders coming in for some strong drinks. The peek of the dinner rush comes and soon the whole building is filled with people. There's whispers of a performer, and giggles from the girls staring down the new bar-tender working orders. DJ ignored the girl's stares as he asks Sean what everyone's deal was. \"If you're wondering about the people waiting for the performer, you'll be in for a treat. If it's about the girls, do I even need to explain?\" DJ gives him the satisfaction of giving him a fake laugh. The work distracted DJ, then suddenly the orders just froze over. \"What's going on?\" He asks Sean, who's leaning on the opposite side of the bar table from him. Sean points with his chin to the stage and a smile grows on his face. \"She hasn't performed her in a while and everyone is getting anxious. Just watch and you'll see why.\" DJ joins Sean on the table and turns to the stage in time for the piano to start playing and the lights dim even more. He easily recognizes the tune to be 'What a Wonderful World' and soon a spotlight turns to the middle of the stage. There stood Jay dressed in a formfitting long midnight blue sequence dress. Her hair is pinned in the back as the left side of her face gets covered by her hair in a soft curl. Then she started to sing, and some men start to whistle as she moved around the stage. \"What'd I tell you?\" DJ couldn't help but hold his laughter. He now knew why Jay wanted it to be quiet. He knows that this girl hates getting attention, and she's dressed up like a doll now and walking around seductively. This girl got embarrassed at the that she was coupled with him, but she's able to give off this strong pheromone that strong men could just become dogs to her. Then the songs changes to 'At Last'. with her still singing, she got down from the stage to mingle around with the crowd. She'd place her hands gently on the arms of men and quickly wink at them before moving around. Some men even have the nerve of grabbing her hand and kissing it. Before long, orders started to come in again and he couldn't pay attention to the rest of the performance. Sometimes the he'll listening be shocked the someone like her could easily hit those notes. The peak of the night comes and some of the audience members start to get a bit more rowdy. Some stood up and started to grab onto her the wrong way, and she couldn't do anything about it. This is why she finds it embarrassing. Not only did she have to dress like a doll for a bunch of wolves,but she couldn't even do anything about the harassment from them. She can never stand the feeling of being unable to do anything for herself, but it's part of the job and she has to trudge through her troubles. Berry tried his best with protecting her, but there's not much you can do since most of these men were high end and would easily put him out of business without a second thought. So she doesn't blame him. Venus is good enough to hide what she really looks and she could easily beat them when no one's looking. The last song for this hour ended without any problems, and she bowed; acting like the she enjoyed performing in front of them. The lighting returned to it's usual glow and Jay tries her best to avoid the spectators wanting to chat it up with her. The moment the door shuts behind her does the mask falls. Venus is there with a bottle of water ready. \"Darling you were great! Though it would have been better if those men knew how to keep their hands to themselves.\" Jay smiles to her friend. Venus acts as her desser and good friend that doesn't know too much. Venus is what you'll call a drag queen, but he claims that his heart is that of woman's and she never judges him. Even if a bystander were to come and witness the two talking, it actually looked like two women talking. Venus looks even prettier than most girls, and he didn't even have any work done on his body. Venus is also as beautiful as the name suggests, making other women jealous on how a male can look better in a dress than them. \"You know it's always like this.\" Jay takes the bottle gratefully and takes a few gulps. She likes the supportive and protective nature of Venus, almost reminds her of her mother a long time ago. \"What can we do? They're loaded and it's hard to out talk their high priced lawyers.\" Venus crosses his arms and blows a stray red strand away from his face, \"Someone needs to beat the fucking crap out of them. That'll show them.\" Jay feigned shock, \"Venus, did you actually swear? I thought that it wasn't ladylike?\" Venus fake hits the girl, \"You know very well that you got me to say this.\" He takes a deep breath to calm down, and a mischievous spark twinked in his ember eyes. \"Since you have a break for now, why don't you tell me where you found that new boy? He's absoulty delicous. What's his name again?\" \"DJ? He's a stray cat that I happened to past by. I decided to help him since he was all beat up.\" She shrugs like it's no big deal. \"You know me, I love to help people.\" However, the look on Venus' face showed that he was not convinced. \"You like him. There's no way you'll get a job for a total stranger, let alone have him stay over at your place.\" Jay's jaw and bottle drop to the floor and Venus has the biggest smile of victory on his face. \"Oh yeah, I have my ways.\" Venus left the room to get some air, and left the girl there mumbling to herself and an amused look on his face. \"And a warning Jay. It'll become dangerous for the two of you to be under the same roof alone.\" And with that the door closed. DJ and Sean (and others) are busy keeping the costumers happy with the efficient service, seeing as some were getting restless for the next performance. Some even got drunk enough to feel that they're invincible. (Ha, wimps. I feel like that everyday!) And obviously those drunks were getting on the nerves of both the staff and costumers, so it was DJ's job to escort them out with other bouncers. Some were ok with leaving and some actually tried to start something. They'd drunkly frail their arms towards DJ and he'd just move back until the drunks trip on something and 'lose' their little scuffle. Berry showed up at the bar talking to Sean when DJ returned from sending another one out. When DJ returned to his post, Berry waved him over to talk. \"DJ, there's something I need for you to take care of.\" Berry had a hard glare in his eyes, and his whole body scream seriousness. \"It's an important job and you might be the only one who could do it.\" Looks like you survived through the chapter. And most likely it'll be like this for a while. If it was confusing, I'm sorry, but you have to remember that it's just how life is. Hope I didn't lose any readers and see you all next week.[Chapter 4] Hey, sorry for the double lateness, but sometimes I lose inspiration. Great inspiration boosters are reviews, so hope you remember to write one after this. Jay happily changes from that shining flashy dress to her plain jeans and t-shirt. She feels so free from being able to get out of here, and she couldn't wait till she got home and just forget about it till next month. She waves goodbye to Venus and walks out the back door. The alley looks different from when she first came in. The only source of light there is the single lightbulb just above the door. The sight would have the weak stay put and those without experience to cower, but her home lies in shadows and job is an everyday struggle to not get caught. The dark is her friend and those who encounters her can never get away. So she walks confidently down the alleyway, taking her time to get to the bright lights of the common street. Her guard is down as she enjoys the quiet of the night, then she feels a presence and soon a hand grabs her from behind and pulls her further away from the common street. She starts to struggle but a hand soon covers her mouth with a moist rag and she would have some trouble fight back half drugged. She gets the hand with the rag off her face, but she breathed in enough to start to feel a little dizzy. Jay turns away from her attacker and starts to fight against the dizziness to get out of there. But her luck is always the shittiest and she hears two other people with her and her attacker. Not wanting to take any chances, she tries her best to fight off the other who grabs her arm, but this person pulls her close and whispers in her ear. \"Don't worry.\" She knows who the voice belongs to and allows to be the helpless one. The images she sees get blurrier, and she can tell that Red pulled her behind him to get whoever was aiming for her. Jay hears the struggles and can point out two male voices that she doesn't recognize, most likely someone that just want a good time. After a while, her vision returns a bit and her eyes are now a costumed to the dark and Red's face shows up just inches form hers. \"How you feel?\" There's a warmth in it, and it suits him in a way that it seems as if he used to be a saviour or protector to those who need it. Jay weakly smile, still feeling the effects of the strong drugs. \"I feel like throwing up.\" Her voice comes out shaken and she curses to herself for sounding needy. \"I'll be fine after some rest.\" Red wraps his arm around her and helps her up. Standing caused the blood to flow faster and a bigger wave of nausea flows through her head. \"Just lean on me. I'll take you home.\" \"How about work? You still have like an hour left.\" Jay starts to push off him, but he tightens his grip on her. \"Red, I just need five minutes and I'm good by myself.\" Red lets out a chuckle, \"Don't worry. It's Berry's orders to escort you home. Besides, you look horrible.\" Jay weakly kicks him in the shin, but he doesn't even feel it. \"Just trust me. I'm not gonna attack you like what those creeps were planning to do. Just relax. I'll help you get home.\" Still trying her hardest to fight the dizziness resulted into nothing, and soon everything became one colour, resulting in her passing out. Jay wakes up in a cold sweat. Looking around, she's glad to see that she's in her bed. Blinking the images from her nightmares away, she's grateful for not waking up in a random place. Being careful, she gets up slowly and waits as her blood flow returns to normal. Looking at the clock, she could tell that she was only out for almost an hour. She then spies a note near her lamp beside her bed and it reads, 'You were out like a light and saying this weird thing about life. I set you down and went back. Be back later, and don't do anything stupid while I'm gone. Who knows what you might do if you're in this state. Red.' Letting out a laugh, she lays back down, planning on getting some more sleep. Jay lies there in bed. It's her night off today from her usual job but thinking kept her up. She knew that she wouldn't get sleep again tonight. Giving up on trying to sleep, she got up and just stared out her window. Before, she was able to sleep without hassle, but the night she found her brother she stopped getting a good night's rest. A miracle really is that she's able to still be up without the need of caffeine. The night still plays fresh in her mind as it all started because of one mistake she made. Closing her eyes, she can easily think of the night she was sent to Paris to end a life of a public figure for the firsts time. Jay crouched down as she waited for her target to go inside. Usually she's in charge of getting the information from groups, but sometimes she's placed into these kinds of missions. She doesn't like the fact that she has to target a public figure, but orders are orders. She just wish that it'll be called off, this target is still young and has so much potential to make the world a better place. They wanted it to look like a natural death so she has to get closer then she does with others. Thinking about leaving and facing a big punishment the door made a soft beep, allowing the holder of the key card to pass through. The lights were still off and the light of the hallway showed a silhouette of a female, most likely her target. Jay got into place behind an arm chair and the lights went on. A soft humming came from the target and a wave of innocence came with the voice. It almost brought a tear to her eye at the thought of having to end a life that had no reason to be killed. Then the humming stopped and there was no sound of movement coming from her target. She tried to keep still, but then a hand got hold of her shoulder. She would have jumped from shock if she wasn't in stealth mode, but when she turns to face the owner of the hand, her jaw drop then and there. The owner of the hand is her target and musical protege Aria Muses. \"If you think that this is what it takes to kill me, then you have it all wrong.\" Aria's voice lost its usual cheeriness and innocence, and took the tone of deadly and serious. Her black eyes showed no emotion, but Jay felt as if her life was being sucked out of her from just looking into them. \"Who sent you?\" Jay's voice was taken out of her as a cold smile came to the Heiress' face. \"You don't want to know.\" A dry whisper escaped her lips and she stood up so that the two could see eye to eye. Their height was close to one another and unknown to the other, they were heavily armed just under their clothes. Jay moved her arm and a blade came out of her sleeve and she aimed to hit the neck, her boss said a quiet kill but desperate times. Aria didn't even flinched as the blade got closer and closer to her neck. Her black eyes morphed red and a flash of movement had metal clanging with another. Jay has shock written all over her face, ' how can she stop me in that frame of time. Where did that even come from. ' \"You're pretty skilled, but you'll have to try much harder.\" Aria twisted her blade and knocked the blade out of Jay's hand. Without blinking, Jay got another blade out and charged again, while Aria gets out of the way with only a second to spare. Jay tries again, but this time Aria disappeared and got behind Jay, a knife just touching the skin of her neck. \"It's my win, now who wants me dead.\" \"Kill me. I'll never tell you.\" Jay's voice came out as a harsh whisper, and she could feel the blood slowly flowing down her neck. However, Aria didn't comply, instead she let out a dry chuckle. \"What's so funny?\" \"I find that your so called loyalty to your master is amusing. You're not even loyal to your so called master.\" The blade moved slightly away from her neck, \"You don't even want to do this. The only one you want dead is that master of yours.\" Jay's eyes flew open and dared to look into the eyes of her target. She could read that this wasn't the first time for Aria, there's was like a hidden rage inside the musician that mirrored hers but the difference was the intensity of that rage. It clearly shows that Aria had a deep rage inside her, and for the first time in a while Jay felt scared. \"Do you even understand that I have no choice?\" Jay finally got her voice back, but her declaration still didn't move Aria. \"You always have a choice. It's just a matter of finding it.\" Suddenly the blade left her neck and Jay turned to fact her could be killer. This time Aria's eyes returned to it's regular dark color and it held understanding in her situation. \"If you ever want to leave and hide from the Knights then you can ask for my help.\" Aria handed over a business black business card and all it has is a number that's barley seeable. \"And if you don't believe that I know what I'm talking about, then answer this. Do you know how the fall of the Kages came?\" At the mention of the hidden assassins group, Aria's eyes shone crimson again. Jay didn't want to believe it, but Aria just named two of the worlds most dangerous groups without even blinking. Not even the public has knowledge of the groups existence. Then it came to her, \"You're one of them!\" Aria nods, and she felt lucky to even be standing. The Kages were known for being able to kill anyone within a heartbeat and they're never one you want to anger. \"How'd you know what group I'm in?\" \"Your fighting style.\" And that was the end of the conversation. \"Now I suggest you leave now. Tell your master that Aria got scared and called security before you could even get close. You have five seconds.\" With that, Aria changed to her usual helplessness and scream at the top of her lungs. Jay took the cheque and jumped out of the window. Hoping that the evidence left behind would be destroyed before it even gets to the police. Jay then stops the memory from playing, since just a few hours later she finds her brother missing. And soon dead the next day. The images don't go away though as the bloody images just plays through her head. She's scared to close her eyes since it makes the images more vivid, but she needs to meditate so that she can calm herself down. Giving up with meditation, she sits against her bed frame and looks at the business card she always keeps with her. It's changed over the years as new wrinkles show every now and then on the black card. She's never once called the number printed on the card, but she did get some more information about her only target she let go. It seems that Aria has made a great name for herself over the years and is one of the most influential women in the world when it comes to both business and politics. With just one word from her mouth, all of the dark secrets of the criminal world will come out and the hierarchy would fall, bring down top names in the world for being associated with them. However, that'll also bring down her name as well as make her a top target for every criminal group out there. Ruffling her hair to get the thought of political power out of her head, she looks back at the card. Maybe the reason why Aria hasn't moved is because she's waiting for something to happen. Maybe she's waiting for her to call and ask for her help so that everything will fall. Jay lets out a scream of frustration and hits her head on the wall. Groaning from the pain, Red comes running in through the door. \"Are you ok?\" Jay nods as she rubs the back of her head to heal the bump. \"What happened?\" Red sits beside her to examine the wound. \"It's fine, I just need to remember to not be thinking too much.\" Jay waves his hands away and gives him a reassuring smile. \"I'm fine, thanks for taking care of me.\" Red nods, still looking a little worried. \"Does this happen often?\" Jay tips her head to the side in a questioning manner, \"Does what happen often? If you mean screaming at myself, no. The people trying to drug and rape me. It's Gotham.\" Her smile drips with sarcasm as Red rolls his eyes. \"Yes I meant the attempted rape.\" Red then got really serious. \"But what was that back there?You could have easily taken them to the ground. Why didn't you fight back?\" Jay gives a sad smile. \"They know my face, and I can't have any bad publicity happen to Berry's lounge, so I can't go full out without them getting seriously hurt.\" Jay stretches and crosses her arms behind her head. \"Besides, they might not believe that it was self defence when one of them has their arm badly disconnected.\" Jay jokingly smiles, but they both know that she would have done it when given the chance. Red let out a half-hearted let out a chuckle as he brushes hair out of his eyes, \"Well, looks like I have to make sure you don't harm any innocent bystanders. No wonder Berry told me it's a very important job.\" \"Really?\" Her eyebrow arches, showing a really big expression of disbelief. Shaking it off, she changes the topic. \"Enough about that. How did you find your first day?\" Red shrugs as the recent image of his job plays. \"It's not that bad. I thought it'll be much worst.\" Then a devilish smirk lights up his face. \"Nice dress by the way.\" Jay's face turns crimson as she tries to hit the smirk right off his face. He pushes her back into her covers and gets up, starting to leave. \"Taking a better look at you now, you seem still a bit out of it. Time for children to go to bed.\" He stops as he starts to head out of the doorway, \"Oh, and you sounded great tonight.\" He closed the door just in time for a pillow to hit it. Anyone else getting a sense of Deja-vu? I do! Word to the people who knows what I'm talking about! Sorry again about the lateness, but reviews help the updating process since you tell me you want more. See you Saturday![Chapter 5] Welcome to a new chapter! I have nothing to add, except for you to enjoy! Jason's been getting the hang of working as a bartender. It's been a little over a week since he first started, and it's actually more fun then he first thought it'll be like. He's also getting pretty good with mixing easy cocktails together, and according to Sean he's learning faster then your average rookie. It's a regular Friday night shift, and he's been doing his regular routines. It's getting pretty late now and his shift's almost over for the night. That's when his night's been shifted from casual to deadly. DJ's just cleaning the counter with moist cloth when a couple comes in through the doors. Nothing out of the ordinary, just a couple decked out in the latest high end fashion. Typical rich. Taking a quick glance he sees a striking tall mysterious type man with a drop dead gorgeous Barbie doll. The couple sit in the area DJ works in and he walks up to them to ask their orders. He quickly writes down their order, and he can't wait till he leaves. This lady just doesn't know how to shut up. \"Oh Brucie, why are we here? The place is a total bore!\" DJ's eyes slightly widen at the name. Taking a glance through his pereferal vision and can clearly see the face of his former mentor. He lowers his head more, grateful for the dim lighting and curtain of shadows given by the bar that's hiding him. \"I mean look at the place! It's totally dead.\" The room was pretty busy actually and some great jazz tunes are being played to liven up the mood. DJ gives Sean the orders and he quickly makes them and hands the drinks for DJ to serve. He gives the drinks to Bruce and his beaut, hoping that he wouldn't get recognized. As the bartender places the drinks down in front of them, Bruce turns to grab the drink and sees the hand that brought it. The right hand has a noticeable scar forming a half circle on the inside of the first joint of the middle finger. In that one second of seeing it, a flash of memories flooded his head. Bruce couldn't believe it, the last time he's seen that scar was from a form child of his. He takes a look at the owner of the hand, but it was too dark for a positive identification. The hand starts to pull away, so he screwed the need to look at the face and grabs the hand before it leaves the table. \"Jason?\" Bruce wanted his voice to sound sure, but he couldn't help the hesitation from his voice. He watches closely as the bar tender shows signs of confusion and shock. But that still doesn't give a positive sign of whether it was his lost son or not. \"Excuse me, but I think you have me confused with someone else. I've never been a Jason, though I do have a J in my name.\" The voice that spoke didn't sound like the voice he last heard from his lost son on that final battle. This voice sound scared and not as bloodthirsty as his son's, almost like this person has no hidden motive behind his words. Bruce reluctantly let go of the hand and tries to hide his disappointment with a smile. \"I'm sorry, it's just that you remind me of someone I used to know.\" He sees the bartender nod and turn to the co-worker who called his name. 'So his name is DJ.' Inwardly sighing, he shakes his wishful thinking and turns back to his date. 'Bruce, he's gone. It's in the past now.' However, with that thought in mind, he still feels like Jason's out there. They could never find the body through the wreckage and there was no reports of someone getting admitted into a hospital with his description. It's like Jason just disappeared. There was no way for Jason to have left that site unharmed. Even he has gotten badly injured and had Dick fill in for him until he had healed a little bit. The trail all ends on that night, and the city thinks that the Red Hood is dead so he finds himself believing it a bit as well. Bruce has to forget about this encounter, or he'll feel even worst then when he knew Jason was dead. Jason let out a sigh of relief as he got changed out of his uniform. It was a very close call, but he held it together and everything was in his favor. He's just glad that he was left off early and there'll be a little chance of Bruce seeing him again. Looking at the mirror in the locker room, he knows if they were to meet in the light then Bruce would defiantly arrest him and hand him over to the cops. Before all this, he would have been proud of ending those criminals. But now, he wasn't so sure. Right now he's doing a crime by having a fake identification and he might be rooming with someone having to do with the criminal world. So he can't really say that what he did was just. Maybe he did go a little overboard with killing those thugs, but would he be forgiven of his crimes? No, that's not how the justice system works. They let the Batman beat criminals and harms them, but that's the Batman, and he never ends a life. Sighing, he closes his locker and starts to head out. The streets are full of life as he walks back home. Some cars past by and he watches them with a sidelong glance as he still walks forward. The cars remind him of some old memories that should have died long ago, but they remain to breath in his mind and start to grow, almost yelling at him to notice their presence. However, he blocks them off and turns back to the front. There's no reason to be reminiscent right now. Bruce is finally glad to get out and get in the car. The reason he choose that lounge was because it wasn't that loud, but his guest however didn't like it and tested his every nerve the whole time. He's just glad that she's passed out in the back seat and Alfred took nothing of it, knowing full well that silence is best at this moment. He got in the front passenger seat to give his drunk date the comfort of a makeshift bed and watches the lights go by. Falling halfway into a sleep, his eyes catch someone familiar. Under a street light waiting for the light to change, there stood Jason alive and well. There's no mistaking it. Even without the mask on, he can tell it's Jason by the shape of the face and hard set expression. Even without seeing the eyes for over five years, he can tell that it's his son. The light then changed and Bruce is jolted awake as he watches Jason disappear into the crowd. \"Master Bruce?\" Alfred's voice broke through his thoughts and his concentration from the crowd. \"Are you alright?\" Taking another second to see if he'll be able to get another glimpse, to no avail, he turns to his loyal butler. \"I'm fine. Just getting over this headache.\" Alfred studies him for a second, but returned to focusing on driving. Alfred can read his master like a book, and finds himself treating him as his own kin. So Alfred knows full well that Brice isn't feeling well, and wishes to keep it to himself. Alfred doesn't mind, he knows full well that Bruce would tell him everything when he's ready or needs another opinion. Jason walks up the steps out of habit and starts to look through his pockets for his key. Successful in his search, he turns the corner to the apartment door when he sees it wide open. The door frame has holes where the lock would be around and there's also sighs that the door was rammed in. There's also little droplets of blood on the floor and what he could see of the room looks as if a struggle has taken place in it. Without blinking, he puts his guard up as he takes careful steps into the room. Scanning, nothing else seems out of place throughout the whole room besides the coffee table and couch. The little blood trail lead to behind the couch. He looks down to the blood trail and sees that it has already dried and browned. Following the trail, his eyes catch a pair of shoes he failed to noticed before. Those shoes were attached to a body, and that body still held on to the disappearing string called life. Taking a closer step, he sees that there's multiple wounds on the body and a sleeping dart just a few inches away from their hand. Another step and he can now see who the person is. Wide eyed with shock he runs closer to Jay lying there on her stomach, and starts to wake her up. \"Jay! Hey, wake up!\" He rolls her over to see her with a peaceful look on her face. \"Jay, come on! Get out of dreamland!\" Feeling frustrated he gives up on being kind and slaps her in the face. The slap makes a loud, empty sound through the apartment room and the only thing she does is stir. He shakes her again and she's a bit more responsive now and her eyes flutter open. Her eyes are still slightly foggy, but they hold life and that's all he needs to know. \"Hey there sleeping beauty.\" Putting a light on things helped as she rolls her eyes and becomes more alert at every breath she takes in. \"We need to get you to a hospital. I'll go call...\" But she shakes her head and holds a strong plea in her eyes. \"You're crazy!\" \"Please.\" Jay's voice comes strong and healthy. Jason looks at her like she's crazy, but then he remembers giving a request like that when they first met. This is just history repeating itself, but this time there isn't any clear signs that she'll being going off to the next world anytime soon. Jay can easily see that he's being compliant with her pleas and she smiles while trying to get up. Jason sees her try to get up and he helps her up. Jason leads her to the couch and she takes a seat with Jason being careful not to hurt her anymore. He turns to turn on the light and now with the light on, he can see the huge blood stain on her back and he can't help but feel like she shouldn't be alive right about now. \"Here, let me help you.\" She shakes her head, looking as if the wounds around her body isn't even there. \"I'm fine.\" She gasps in pain when he pokes the wound, \"The hell Red!\" \"You helped me, it's my turn to help you. Now sit down.\" She sits and he goes to grab the first aid kit. He comes back soon later and sit behinds her. \"I'm going to need you to take off your shirt. Unless you want some help with that.\" \"I can undress myself thank you very much.\" She sneered as she tries to get the article of clothing off with little pain possible, to no avail. Jason held in a chuckle as he helps her remove the shirt and examine the wound on her back. There in her flesh is a shiny bullet just inches away from her spinal cord, luckily it hasn't exploded or it'll take even longer to take out. Being careful about not hurting her, he's able to cut the wound deeper to get to the bullet and start to pull it out. During that process he can tell that she was trying her hardest not to scream or curse out a storm, though there were some in different languages just under her breath. After what felt like hours for her, she hears the distinct clang of metal hitting hardwood and she knows that the worst part was over. He gently disinfected the wound and wrap it tightly with gauze, then moved onto the other wounds located on her shoulder blades. By the looks of it, it seems as she landed hard on her back from an explosion of some sort and skidded down the pavement for a good while. There's small bits of derby and rocks in the cuts, maybe even a few bits of glass, but other then that it doesn't look that bad. He quickly washes the foreign objects out of her wounds and gets ready to wrap it when a problem arises. \"Jay, not to sound like a pervert or anything, but I need you to take off your bra.\" Her head whipped around so fast he thought that she might have given herself whiplash. But before she could say anything he opened his mouth, \"There's even some more cuts under there and you need that disinfected. We also only have wraps. So unless you want to not be able to sleep on you're bed tonight, then I suggest we get this over with quickly and be done with it.\" He can tell that she didn't like the idea, but complied anyways. He finished quickly and started to put stuff away as she got up and got to her room. The moment he put the first aid away, he got to the front of her bedroom door and knocked on it. She ignored the first time he knocked, but he's getting the answers tonight even if it kills him. And it might just kill him, since Jay actually did open the door and the first thing he notices is the a mark VII desert eagle being pointed between his eyes. \"Really? Are you that mad at me?\" He tried to play it off as it was nothing, but the look in her eyes is ice cold and there's not a single hint of hesitation. It's the look of having done it before, and in a way it only half surprised him. As gently as he could, he pushes the gun to aim it to hit the floor and she let him, but to her it's wouldn't make a difference. \"I just want to talk. It's the only way to kill my curiosity.\" Jay searched his eyes for anything to help her resolve to kill him, but then again she swore to never kill outside her hit list. That'll just put her over the edge. Without saying anything, Jason lead her back to the couch and they sat on opposite ends, like the distance would help. Jason sat so he was facing the TV while Jay sat so her back was to the window and she was facing Jason. Gun still in her hand, she put the safety on and calmed herself down a bit. When he heard the click of the safety he found it best to ask now. \"What did you do to get yourself like this?\" He leaned back on the couch and turned to face her. There was silent for a while and he could tell that Jay was having an argument with herself of whether to tell the truth or not. Finally she lets out a heavy sigh and places her head on top of her knees. \"I had a job to do. A hit if you like to call it that.\" Her eyes became faded as the memory played in her head, \"The boss said that it'll be an easy in and out, but he didn't tell me that others were there. Or that a bomb was going to be set off.\" He watches her carefully, trying to see if she'll say more. When she doesn't he goes a different route. \"Who's this boss?\" Again with the pause and debate going on in her head. \"It's my father.\" Well, now we have this to deal with. Bruce comes in now, he'll do something. Also more characters are coming! Tune in next time! Hint: Reviews=weekly updates=longer chapters! TILL NEXT TIME![Chapter 6] Hey, it's been a while huh? Sorry, but things happened and exams can now suck it! I finally have time again, but don't expect much from me since I don't know how much free time I have left, so bear with me a little. I'll shut up now and let you enjoy! Disclaimer: All rights reserved to their rightful owner. I had nothing to do with the creation of known characters. \"It's my father.\" Jay paused before changing her answer. \"Actually, he's more like my prison's warden.\" Her eyes now held a slight glint of humour in them at a distant memory of the joke. Jason sees this and relaxes a bit more, even leaning a little into the couch. However, Jay didn't open her mouth again and Jason watches her eyes closely. He never told her and he's fairly certain that no one has ever told her about it, but her eyes could never tell a lie and that's one of the reasons why he knows he can trust her. Right now, her eyes frame the massive conflict going through her mind again, and it's clear that if he doesn't do anything then it'll result in her not saying anything. So he decides to go with the gentle route. Placing his hand on top of her's grabs her attention back to him and he knows that she'll spill now. \"Hey, you don't have to force yourself.\" He whispers calmly and that's that. Jay blinks a bit to clear her thoughts and all her walls now fall. Without even thinking anymore, she spills everything. Well, everything that the scums of the elite criminal world already knows. Without saying any names or any distinct details, she constructs the tale holding information that's enough to satisfy him. She goes on on how her so called 'father' (firstly cleared that he 'adopted' her) has gotten her into this life since he's the head of a group that's called the Knights and her main job is elimination. She clarifies that the Knights are the major info grabbers for the other top criminal groups, but sometimes taking the information is a messy job and there'll always be leaks here and there. That's where she comes in. And today's job was harder then it should have been. \"Hence why I look like this.\" Jay ends with motioning to her bandages. At the end of story time, the clock makes a finger to night and they both felt tired. Looking even more tired then the other, Jay lets out a ghostly sigh as she reads the clock. \"Anymore questions?\" \"Why not go to the police?\" Jason's words slip out and he didn't notice it until after they came out. Knowing it was a very stupid question, he regretted that it came out without him thinking it over, but it was too late to deny it so it hangs there like a nose on a branch. Jay looks Jason right in the eye, sending a message of 'Why not?' and Jason couldn't help but know that she's in hot water. It's a choice of kill or be killed. Hunt the weaker ones or have the whole hunt you. And the answer is clear, and that doesn't sit well with him. \"That's just bullshit.\" Came out his final words of the night. The next day is no better. Jason was amazed at how Jay could move around efficiently with those wounds decorating her right side, but he left the questions to that to the wind. He didn't get any sleep last night, too busy thinking about the information on a more hidden criminal hierarchy that not even Batman knows. And according to Jay, it's not even a new group. It's a centuries old group, and there seems to be a multiple of them. This information pulsed repeatedly in his brain, and it almost drove him into getting the phone and calling the police. But he stopped since he knows that no one would believe him. There's no proof, and most likely there's someone on the inside with the authorities and he'd be taken care of before he even has the time to prove it. It's a little past noon, and throughout the morning he's been watching her. Jay would notice his worried stare and just smile so he wouldn't be worried, but it gave the opposite effect since he couldn't shake the image of her telling him. Jason tried his best, but the image of her hugging her knees as her voice slightly cracking here and there, while her hands would clench and unclench to the sound of the clock. But the worst of all was the look in her eyes. Throughout that whole tale, she never once looked away from him and he watched as her eyes slowly lose their life and faded into a cold, disconnected sapphire. It was the eyes of a dead fish, stuck in one position and holding nothing. And just watching her eyes, he can tell that this shouldn't happen to a girl like her. That look doesn't suit her, her eyes should hold all the joy in the world and more. Jay should be living life and struggling through her first year of post secondary, or working so she could be independent from her family and not worry about someone watching you. His thoughts brought him to how harsh his life used to be before he met Bruce, and he slowly started to sink deeper into his mind. Jay looks in the mirror and swings her arm around. She smiles at the result and starts to throw the dirty bandages away. \"All better. And I was worried that the skin would grow over the bullet.\" She says to herself as she starts to get dressed. Her thoughts go to what happened last night and goes over the mistakes she's made. Remembering leaves a burning sensation through her shoulder, and the area where the bullet hit stings, but she knows it's only her brain telling her that the wounds should still be there. Splashing water on her face, her mind returns to the old factory where her target was spilling his mouth on the group and how powerful he is to another group of younger boys. Suppose to be easy pickings, but of course it had to be one of those days and it turns out that her targets are actually one person having the ability to multiply and shape-shift into anyone. The moment she got a few feet away from her targets does the group transform into a monster that looked like a wet pile of clay and her eyes caught sight of a bomb just a little past her. She heard a gun go off and the bomb starts to beep, having the images fly past her as she ran from that room. She got out of the room, but the bomb went off the moment she stepped out and she got caught in the force of the explosion. Her head was ringing, but she was lucky to get out in one piece and got up to leave. Before she could even get a foot away from the site is she met with thick daggers of cement getting a little too close to her skin. If it wasn't for her nerves being on edge then she wouldn't have been able to avoid getting any serious injury. \"Well, it's clear that you're very skilled.\" Jay turned to the voice behind her and comes face to face with her own image. \"Just all the more reason to kill you I guess.\" The battle takes sometime, but it was clearly even on both sides. Luckily for her, she was able to escape, but that resulted in the bullet in her back and another opponent chasing her. She was able to get away when she dove into a crowded street and shuffled away back to the apartment. Her biggest regret was not being able to see the other person's face before she went to hide, but she's just fortunate enough to be alive. Another big regret would be that she told Red her secret and now he's going to be dragged into a mess that he should never know about. He was a criminal according to him, but what she remembers from the news reports was that he didn't even graze the surface of the elite underworld, and of course would have no clear idea as to what he's going to face. The only plus side she could see is that she's now certain that Red isn't an assassin from the Inside, since he didn't show any sign of him moving in to kill her for giving information to an outsider. Just the thought of an agent from the Inside having her name on their hit list makes the hairs on her arms stand on end. She doesn't know much about them, but according to rumours, they don't have any leader. They're able to make anyone disappear without a trace in any status just because of a breach in the rules that were placed down by all 13 groups of the elite. And telling outsiders is a big crime to them. Not only would they hunt down the offender, but also their family and the listener and the listener's family. Slapping herself to get out of her thoughts, she looks around the bathroom to see if she has missed anything before walking out the door and into the sunny living area only to be faced with Red sitting on the couch deep in thought. She sighs, knowing what he's thinking of and puts on a smile. She walks over to him and pokes his head to bring him back from his thoughts as she sits beside him. Red snaps out of it and turns in time to see Jay settle into the old couch. \"If you're thinking about last night again, I suggest you stop right now. You'll just bring more trouble then it's worth.\" Jay shrugs her shoulders and plays on a laid back attitude. \"I know, you've told me that already. But I can't stop thinking about it since it's something like that. It's not something you find out everyday.\" Red's eyes start to grow distant again as something comes into his mind. \"There's a way to get them.\" The words came as a whisper, but Jay could easily hear it. A smile forms on his lips, but he never voiced his idea. Jay felt worried about what he was thinking now, but is in no mood to stop him. Letting out a sigh again she gives him a final word of advice, \"Red, whatever you're thinking now better not involve the police. And please don't die because of your idea.\" She gets up and starts to cook their lunch. Jason looks up at the iron gates and thinks over his actions. It feels weird to be standing there and having the gates closed to him when before he was able to come and go freely through those very gates. Just behind those gates, anyone could see the castle like home just on top of the hill and it hasn't looked so foreign to him till this very moment. But times change, and he's unsure of what might happen if he were to be seen. Rethinking his decision, he puts his hood back on and starts to walk away and blends with the crowd. Little did Jason know that he was seen. Even with eyes going dim from the years passing, there was no mistaking that boy walking past him. He lost himself for a moment as he watches the boy merge into the crowd. Jay sits in her room, looking at the number again. Every time she looks at it she doesn't even have the courage to take a phone in her hand, but today seems different. Today she actually has her phone that she uses outside of the organization that they don't know she has and actually dialed the number in. All that was left was to hit the call button, but her finger just wouldn't hit it. Different scenarios kept playing through her mind, but they all ended in the same where she ended up in a bloody mess. It was laughable for her to fear her own end when she has ended so many before her. Someone like her shouldn't even beg for their own life when the time has come, when she has ignored others' pleas for mercy. Maybe calling this would just lead to another dead end for her, it's actually a trap to get her to succumb into her own death. So many questions. The only thing she's positive on is that she did get this card from Aria all those nights ago. She's certain that Aria was trained, but she could have been trained with other groups. The Kages were the most deadly, yes, but since that group has disappeared there's been other groups who has grown stronger. The information that Aria was one still didn't click into her mind, but what if it was true? When Aria admit it, there didn't seem to be any lies. It's just it's 'that' world. A world where lying and deceit was as easy as asking about the weather or how someone was doing. What are the chances that this was actually a way out of that world? Without even thinking, her finger goes over the call button and it starts to ring. Jay's eyes go wide as her phone's screen reads the call connecting, but she's too much into her mind to even register the fact and end the call. Her brain still doesn't reconnect itself and finally the call gets answered on the other end. A muffled 'hello' sounds from the speaker, and Jay struggles to place the phone to her ear. Taking in a few deep breaths for good luck, she speaks clearing to the receiver. \"Um, hey? I'm looking for Ms. Muses. Aria Muses.\" She curses to herself for sounding uncertain. Before Jay could deny calling and hanging-up, the answerer spoke. \"You're speaking to her.\" Jay's eyes open wide at the news. She wasn't expecting for Aria to personally pick it up; most likely it would have been an assistant of her's or someone working under her, not her personally. \"It took you a while to call didn't it?\" Jay could tell that Aria had on a genuine smile on her face as she spoke, but she couldn't help but wonder if she mixed her up with somebody. \"I think you have me confused with somebody else.\" Maybe Aria swung that way, and was waiting for her latest catch. It would explain why there was never a report of her dating anyone. However, Jay's thoughts were interrupted by laughter from the other end. \"No, I know who you are. You're the girl you tried to kill me that night in my hotel room.\" Her laughter died and she was back to her serious self, \"I never forget a voice. Now since you're calling, it's most likely because you finally want to move.\" Jay nods, but smacks herself for being stupid. 'There was no way for Aria to be able to see that' she thought before answering. \"Yes, the situation changed and I think someone wants to get rid of me now.\" Aria instructs her into meeting in person, and Jay almost moved to hang up the call. But against her better judgement, she agreed and marked the date. The call ended and Jay is left feeling like the whole world just left her shoulders. DJ works his shift as an automatic zombie. His mind is still muddled, and Sean could see it. Usually Sean would leave his co-workers alone to settle their problems, but he could tell that DJ was really not present and it was scaring some of the early costumers. There weren't many costumers around so he decides to pull DJ back to earth. DJ stands there wiping away at an already clean and dry cup, while Sean walks up and smacks him on the top of his head. DJ jumped at the sudden impact and turns to see Sean standing there with a smirk painted on his face. \"The hell was that for? I could have dropped the glass!\" \"Good, looks like sleeping beauty is up now.\" Sean then leans on the table, acting as if nothing happened. \"Now what's up? It's not like you to be so distracted. Is it a problem with the ladies?\" DJ gives Sean a look of disbelief, \"Is women the only thing that goes on in your brain?\" DJ puts the cup away as a joking smile moves his face. Sean rolls his eyes and plays along, \"Hey, it's not just women. It's women and drinks. Always women and drinks.\" Standing straight up again, Sean loses the jokes and looks DJ dead in the eye. \"But seriously, what's up? I know you find some of the women that come here irritating, but you usually hide that.\" DJ sighs, and thinks of a way to avoid the question. But when he turns to face Sean, it's clear that there was no way of avoiding it since there would be no way in hell would Sean let it go. \"I can't talk about it. It's not really something I can share.\" Sean looks DJ in the eye and can tell that it's not your usual, everyday, first world problem. It's something much bigger, yet has to kept under lock and key. Ten fold. Giving an understanding nod, Sean pats DJ's shoulder and gives a brotherly smile. \"Fine, but you ever need any help I'll be there to drag your ass out of any trouble you get into.\" DJ nods in response, but inside knows that Sean's words did little to no help. It's the thought that counts though. The room's only source of light shines pass the figure sitting neatly into their chair. In front of the chair, two more stands fearing the one sitting in front of them. One had a snipper on their back while the other still retained the image of their target. The seater holds a cheshire smile as they play a recent video of their target walking out of an apartment building. \"Well, any explanation as to why she's still breathing?\" The figure calmly asks the two standing before them. The two struggle to take air in as that smile becomes a straight line. \"Well!?\" Boom's the head's voice as they slammed the desk hard with their fist. The two assassins shake as the one with the gun speaks, or more like squeaks out the answer. \"Apologies sir, but she was more skilled then the others before. We were caught off guard.\" The snipper dares not to look at the figure in the eye, knowing full well that they will not be given a second chance. Again with another sound of abuse to the desk before the figure responded. \"Then don't let it surprise you again!\" The two standing were shocked at the miracle of a second chance. \"But just remember, this is your last chance.\" They two bows and quickly escapes the crammed room. The only one left turns away from the door and watches the light blind their eyes. \"If all goes well, then I would soon take control of the network. And that man would never know what's going to happen to his precious daughter.\" The figure then watches the paused image of Jay dressed in her civvies. \"And don't worry little girl. If you cooperate with them, then the end would come much sooner.\" Ya, I don't know how you guys would respond to this chapter but the story must go on! News years resolution is to get at least one story done this year, so I had to move it forward with what I could do. Reviews are nice, I don't mind any critics either, and hope you stay tuned for next time. Might come sooner than you think![Chapter 7] Hey guys! How's it been? I've been busy and just trying to avoid this for a while since I couldn't think of anything. So I took a break, and the ironic twist is that I started to rewrite this when I have little to no free time, so yes I'm a little tired. Anyway, enough about me and on with the good stuff. Disclaimer: All known characters from media are own by their respected owners. Just a contributor of a forever growing fan base. Today's the day. Jay's heart kept leaping out of her throat when the seconds crawl closer to the agreed time. For the whole morning, she's been jumping at every little surprise out there. The slight movement of the curtain, the small creaks going through the walls, and every common noise possible made her pale. Red even noticed her nervousness, but she waved it off with a half smile saying that it happens sometimes. Jay wasn't sure whether he bought it or not, but her mind's already occupied with something even bigger. Something that might as well change the rest of her life. Checking her watch for the millionth time today, she makes it to the said meeting place and sits at the bench as instructed. As she waits, she looks around at the peaceful scenery in front of her and feels jealous of the others' normal lives. To be able to walk around without a noose around one's neck was something she's not even allowed to dream of. Looking to the sky, she prayed to whatever god up there for this meeting to be her chance. \"I just need one chance.\" She whispered to anyone listening with her eyes closed. \"And a chance I'm giving you.\" Jason gets up at around noon to find that he was alone. Sometimes he'd wake up this late and Jay would be there just finishing cooking the food. However, there wasn't any noise, save for the usual city tune, and that got him bolting out of his bed. Stepping out of his room, he scans around to see everything was still intact and nothing out of place. It didn't take long for him to spot the only difference in the room, a bright yellow note stuck on the fridge. Relaxing a little, Jason heads towards to see the note holding a familiar handwriting. ' Going out for a bit. If you're hungry, there's some food ready for you in here. Make sure to clean up after. Jay ' was all the note said, but it was enough for him to know that she was fine. He takes the food out and puts it in the microwave. While leaning on the counter as he waits, he lets his mind wander to past the time. Without his consent, his mind plays an image from a few nights ago. The image of Jay in a fettle position comes here and there from time to time, and it hurts him to see someone who normally has a strong aura to show a vulnerable state. Before the timer rang, he makes a decision that he was going to do something. And there's only one way to do it. \"And a chance I'm giving you.\" A strong, confident voice responded to her plea. Jay's eyes fly open, not expecting to get an answer from anyone. And a response that sounds right beside her. She turns to the direction the voice came from and is shocked to see it belong to a girl who seems to have no self esteem at all. The most shocking thing is that a normal person wouldn't have gotten closer to her without her feeling their presence. Even when relaxed, she would have at least heard something. Looking around to see if she was mistaken, the girl sitting beside her is looking her straight in the eye, hiding a strong will. If one didn't look this girl in the eye, they would have mistaken her for another emo kid. Half of this girl's face is covered by her bangs and she's dressed completely in black while also having headphones hang around her neck. \"Um, can I help you?\" Jay asked, still uncertain whether this girl was talking to her as a joke or not. The girl in black rolls her eyes like this happened every time this girl talked. \"It's not what you can do for me, it's what I can do for you. You need my help, and it's not the other way around.\" Jay looks at the girl with an even more confused look on her face, and the girl in black rolls her eyes again. \"Just give it a minute.\" The girl sighs out while placing an elbow on her knee and become the Thinking Man statue while keeping eye contract with Jay. Jay replayed what happened in that minute and she finally came to the meaning of this strange event. \"You're Aria, aren't you.\" The words crawled out slowly and a sly smile paints itself on the other's face. That was all the response Jay needed to know that she was correct. Eyes wide, Jay almost toppled over at the news. \"There's no way. You look so different.\" Aria shrugs her shoulders and stands up. \"It's a trick I learned since I was young. It comes in handy when you're in my shoes.\" Aria puts her hands in her sweater's pockets and turns to the opposite direction, losing her high class posture. \"Now we go somewhere else to talk.\" Still a little awestruck, Jay follows the prodigy down the park's path and gets lost in her own thoughts. It's been a while since they last saw each other in person, and she couldn't help but compare Aria to herself. They both had shoulder length black hair and it seems that she's taller than the heiress by a good few inches. Aria also looked different now than when they met in the hotel room. Right now she looks like a regular kid on the street, while before she had on the greatest brands that any girl would die for. However, there's one thing that didn't change and that was her eyes. They were the same midnight color, a time where anything could happen and no one would ever know. They're still unreadable and every step they took farther away from the park bench does her willingness to follow falls. \"I suggest you don't run away.\" Came Aria's voice, clearing Jay's thoughts away in a second. Aria stops walking and faces Jay who looks at the woman standing a little ways in front of her and the look on the heiress' face killed any doubt she had in following the former assassin. Aria sees the transition in thoughts and continues to walk to whatever their destination was. Finally able to register their surroundings, Jay notices that they left the park and are now walking beside the busy streets of Gotham city. Aria easily weaves between the people walking in a hundred different directions while Jay, though she hates to admit it, is having trouble going through the crowd of people. She almost lost track of Aria, but she would find her in the last second and hurry to the direction she last saw her. Happily for Jay, they finally turn to a quiet street with few people on the sidewalks and start to go through different alleyways. They walk through the slums for a few more minutes before Aria stops in front of a door and opens it for Jay. \"Here we are. This is a safe place to talk.\" Jay looks up to see a sign for a vietnamese noodle house. It wasn't until she saw the neon noodles does her stomach finally roar from her skipping breakfast in fear of upchucking. \"And don't worry, I'll be paying.\" Aria smiles as she waits for Jay to go in. Jay walks in and her nose is soon invaded by the smells from the kitchen. They soon get a table and order their food. An air of silence surrounds the two and the silence slowly kills Jay, while her questions beat into her skull as every second pass. Aria looks at Jay with a kind smile on her face, \"Ok, now that everything is settled. Time to get down to the problem.\" Jason stands in front of the iron gates again. The only difference now is that he feels more confident than yesterday. Knowing fully well that he can't just waltz right in, he scans the lot to see if he could spot any changes to the security. To his luck, there seems to be none and starts to head to a less public area. The only quiet shaded area in the sunny busy street was not far from his previous location, and Jason quickly checks his surroundings for any curious eyes before scaling the wall to the land beyond. Landing softly like a cat, he takes careful steps to avoid alarming the owner and heads to the front door. Usually that would be the last choice, but this is a different matter all together. The moment he stands in front of the door, is the moment he gets cold feet. However, he's determined to help, and a little fear wouldn't stop him. Swallowing down the knot and taking in a breath for good luck, jason brings his hand to the heavy knocker (thought it'll be cooler than a doorbell) and waits for a response. A few minutes past and he turns to leave, only for the door to open. At hearing the door open, Jason turns his head to face the man who answered the door. \"Jason?\" Ya, it's kind of short but I've been pressed for time and just want to move on from the going around in circles bit. And thanks for reading through what came out from my sleep deprived mind. Reviews are nice and you could even say what a bad writer I am, it'll help me to improve so go do it! Hit the review button! I like to know how you guys think about it so far, you could even try to guess what happens next on this all too predictable plot! Have a great day![Chapter 8] \"Jason?\" Jason turns his head to face the man who answered the door, and goes wide eye not expecting to see him. \"Is that really you?\" The man steps out of the gloom of the mansion and into the light of the afternoon, his black hair reflecting the sun. It hit him from seeing the man that both Jay and the man hold similar physical characteristics. Blue eyes scan Jason up and down to make sure that it wasn't a trick of the light. Jason stood there awkwardly, not sure what to do with this unforeseen reunion. Richard Grayson, the first boy wonder, now stands before him in normal civvies. \"Uh hey Dick, is Bruce home?\" Jason acts as if this was a regular visit, but the look on Dick's face says otherwise. \"What?\" Dick takes a second before answering, \"Nothing. It's totally normal to just come out of hiding and ask for Bruce. Not to mention you're whole crazy scheme of getting back at the Joker is just an everyday event.\" He leans against the doorframe with an unamused expression. \"You should already know that Bruce doesn't play that way.\" \"I know.\" Jason resists the urge to roll his eyes, \"I'm here to ask for help.\" Without even blinking, Dick starts to close the door. \"Wait! Wait! Let me explain!\" Jason grabs the door and starts to push it open while Dick does the opposite. \"Why should I? We all thought you were dead! Then you suddenly show up and start painting the town red!\" Dick yells from the small crack in the doorway, \"This could be another scheme for revenge or your screwed sense of justice!\" They both go at it as the force causes the door to slightly crack and bend, their voices echoing throughout the hallway and out. Neither side was giving in and it seems that the poor door would break any second. \"Ahem.\" Came a voice behind Dick, causing both men to turn to the new arrival, saving the door from certain death. Alfred Pennyworth stood there with his usual monotone expression, \"I ask that you both unhand the door. The years have not been too kind and there needs not be two people acting childish to destroy it.\" The two do as asked and blush in embarrassment. The older man looks close to pleased and turns to leave, but not without adding, \"And Master Richard, it's best to hear someone out before throwing them out.\" He turns to the two boys again with what could only seem like a smile on the old man, \"Welcome home master Jason.\" Dick sighs as he lets Jason in, \"Always the one to have the last word.\" Jason comes in and they both start to head to the den area. Knowing where everything is, Jason doesn't even pay attention to where he was going, just letting his body go by instinct. They get to the den and sit in the chairs that surround the coffee table as Alfred comes back with tea and snacks. \"It's been a while, hasn't it?\" Dick starts as he takes a cup and starts to blow on it. \"Mind if I ask where you've been the past few months?\" Jason shrugs his shoulders as he takes a bite out of the Pennyworth recipe chocolate chip cookie. \"Working.\" The cookie goes down, and Jason attempts to surpass the sensation of a mmhmm coming out, to no avail. Dick arches an eyebrow, not really buying the answer. \"What?\" Jason slightly glares at the older, feeling hurt for not being trusted by the man he thought was a brother to him. An annoying brother that was easy to pick on, but still a brother. \"Working on?\" Dick eyes him suspiciously. \"Healing myself.\" Jason slumps into the chair and crosses his arms, \"I was thinking of dying in a back alley. I was heavily injured and there was nothing left for me, so there was no point in going on. That's when I met someone who literally dragged me away from Death's grasp.\" Jason couldn't help it as the words come flowing out like a broken dam's water. \"That person helped me to start over and become a new person. I now have a legitimate job.\" He can feel his first start to harden as he remembers how weak and scared Jay looked, \"Now they're in trouble and I want to help, but I can't do it alone.\" \"That's why you're looking for Bruce.\" Dick cuts in and Jason just nods. Both men fall silent again as they both take a sip of tea. \"So, what's the name of this girl?\" Dick puts in, hiding a smirk behind his cup. Jason nearly chokes on his tea, \"What girl? I never mentioned a girl.\" Dick arches an eyebrow again and places the cup back on the coffee table. He has his elbows rest on top of his knees and his chin on the palms of his hands, \"You're seriously going to try and hide it? Come on, it's obviously about a girl. I know we haven't talked like this for a long time, but it's written all over your face.\" Before Jason could even say anything, a new voice interrupts the two. \"Jason. Alfred tells me that you were looking for me?\" Both turn to the new voice to see a man they both highly respect standing in the doorway, towering over their sitting position. Jay returns home, feeling satisfied for having someone that has gone through the same troubles she's going through. Talking with Aria made her feel less alone in her struggle, and Aria resembles her brother in character. With a happy tune in her head as she turns the key in the lock; all walls have fallen and a huge weight cones off her chest, letting her breathe freely. However things hardly goes the way we hope. Once the door opened, all hell broke loose. Jason stands, finding out that he actually wasn't ready for the encounter with Bruce. But he takes a few quick breaths and looks his former mentor in the eye. With a calm voice, Jason starts, \"Look Bruce, before you try and arrest me, I need your help.\" Bruce's expression doesn't shift, so Jason continues with more confidence, \"I know you might not believe me, but I've gone straight and the person who's helped me is in need of some help and you're the only one I could turn to.\" Bruce nods, sensing the sincerity of his words, \"I already heard the story when the both of you were talking.\" Bruce walks in and takes a seat at an empty chair, \"However, that's too little information. Is there any details you can tell us?\" Jason shakes his head, \"Sorry, but I don't know much myself.\" Jason sits back down and relaxes a bit, \"But she should be able to tell you more if I talk her into trusting you.\" \"Her! I knew it was a girl!\" Dick claps triumphant, a huge smirk on his face. Jason, however, wasn't amused and glares down his adopted brother, \"Shut up, would you!\" Dick attempts to wipe the smile off, but there was no chance. Jason sighs as he returns his gaze to Bruce who just stays there unmoved, use to his sons' antics. \"So can you help? If you don't mind, I'd like to finish this off quickly.\" Bruce gives it a thought for a moment, then nods. Jason smiles and gets up, \"Great, she should be home now. We should get the information from her so we can know where to start.\" \"Wait, you live together don't you?\" Dick smirks again. \"Oh shut up!\" Jay ducks out of the way of the blizzard of bullets coming out her front door. Without even stopping, she races down the stairs and out the door to the street where she attempts to blend in the crowd. However, there was barely anyone around her so that plan was quickly trashed. Trying to come up with a new plan, she takes too long as two people walk out the same door carrying a hunter's eyes. With nothing left to do, Jay runs across the street and plans to get to the place where she knows it's secluded and holds a stash of weapons hidden a while ago. The only close by area where she's able to fight back in the middle of the day. Turning the corner after running through an open field park, she heads to the dock towards the abandoned warehouse at the far end of the pier. Before she could even see the warehouse, a bullet just grazes her shoulder and she dares not look back. Finally making it inside the warehouse, she follows her instincts and goes to the hiding place for her extra guns. As she starts to load her guns as quietly possible, she looks through her pockets to try and find her phone. While hiding in the shadows with gun in her left and phone in her right, she listens for any movement as she dials the number she recently memorized. The moment she hits call, she could hear footsteps come in the empty building and those footsteps kept in sync with the phone trying to connect. Her finger goes to the trigger as her heart leaps for the person to answer. \"Come on! Come on!\" She secretly prayed as she now sees shadows grow bigger. It wasn't until she could hear the faint breathing of her opponents was her call finally answered. Jay hears the familiar click of the call connecting and she almost yells to the person, \"You gotta help me! They're back!\" Without even blinking, Aria's voice comes out calm and collective. \"Calm down. Where are you right now?\" Jay tries her best to tell Aria all the necessary information but her voice cuts off as she now sees a bit of a boot. Aria reads the change in Jay's voice and reassures her, \"Jay, stay there and don't bring any more attention to yourself. I'll be there as fast as I can.\" With that, Jay puts her phone back and grabs another gun since now a person can be seen. \"I still can't believe you're going like this.\" Jason sighs, pointing at his former family's uniforms. \"It's almost 3 in the afternoon. You'll just be bringing unwanted attention.\" Before Dick could say something, an update on police movements shows up on the screen in the batcave. All three men turn to the screen to see nothing the police couldn't handle, but then Jason noticed a familiar address. Reading it over, his eyes go wide as he heads to a bike. \"Where are you going?\" Dick watches, turning back to the screen to try to put things together. \"What's wrong? \"Gunshots heard at Whyte!\" Without waiting for a response, Jason drives off knowing that they understood. Aria was breathless and her thighs burned, but she couldn't afford to slow down. Having a general idea of where Jay is, Aria gets to the docks and scans the area for any signs of a struggle. She notices a cartridge on the ground and can hear the sound of combat. Rushing to the direction of the sound, she can now hear voices and a body hitting the floor hard. \"We finally got the bitch. Time to make the original disappear.\" Risking a peak, Aria sees Jay on the ground with a stream of blood flowing from her while two men stand above the fallen girl. One man, tall and lanky with a military buzz cut, has a good number of weapons on him to not hinder his movements while the other slowly changed from a good looking male to the form of their fallen prey. \"How do I look?\" The morphed man asked as he struck a pose in his new body. His voice also slowly changes into a higher pitch. \"Why do I even need to ask? I look exactly like her!\" The man turns as he tries to act like a cute teenage girl, \"No one would ever know.\" \"Just shut up and help me dispose of her.\" Before the two men could move any closer to the fallen girl, Aria takes out a smoke pellet and throws it at them. In a matter of seconds smoke covers everyone as Aria moves in, blood boiling for what she calculates as a quick battle. What she didn't account for was the morphing man to be able to multiply or that the battle would attract attention. Jason turns the corner hard on the bike just to see that there was already cops at the scene. Ducking to a shaded corner, he could see that the only pair of cops there looked bored as they questioned the few wittiness (or better yet listeners) to the sound of guns. He wasn't surprised that the cops were uncaring since this neighborhood was used to hearing loud sounds that bump in the night, only for it to result in an idiot thinking they're badass with a gun. Jason prays that it was just that, but he can't fight the feeling that it wasn't just a jackass who pulled the trigger for fun. He scans the area as Nightwing and Batman get to him. \"What's up?\" Nightwing asks, but Jason just silences him with a look. With all three being silent, they hear the faint sound of an automatic going off and without even a second to doubt, they head towards the direction they heard it from. As they get closer, the sounds of gun fire gets clearer. They make it to an abandon warehouse at the end of the dock, and see smoke slowly clearing away from the open door. Before they even made it to the door, everything becomes silent and Jason forces his body to go even faster. Jason gets to the door before the others and sees a hooded figure kneeling over a body pooled in blood. He cranes his neck to a different angle to see that it was Jay on the ground with her eyes slightly open. Without thinking, he lunges for the hooded figure and they both crash to the ground. In the badly lit room, Jason uses his training to fight the hooded figure. Unfortunately, the other was a skilled fighter as well and easily blocked his blows. Batman and Nightwing finally come in and Nightwing starts to perform first aid on Jay as Batman runs to Jason and the hooded person. After Jason and Batman teamed up against the hooded opponent, it didn't take long until the duo had the other slam out the window. They both run to the window to finally see the face of their opponent. The other slowly starts to stand as they shake the glass and dirty out of their long black hair and turns up to glare at her assailants only to stop dead in her tracks. \"Bruce?!\" Aria couldn't help her jaw from dropping as she sees her family friend stand there with his cowl. \"What the heck!\" Jason stops to look at his former mentor then to the woman that easily let out a secret fact like it was nothing. \"Aria, what are you doing here?\" Batman was unscathed by the sudden mention of his name as he holds his hand out to help her over the window. Jason steps in, feeling confused. \"Hold on, the hell is going on? Who is she and how does she know about you?\" Both adults look at him with a unreadable mask and not knowing where to start. Luckily Nightwing comes to break some news. \"The girl is alive and needs medical attention, however she's begging to not go to a hospital.\" He then notices Aria standing beside Batman and points to her, \"What are you doing here?\" Without missing a beat, Aria turns to Nightwing, \"I'll explain later, but it's best to not take her to a hospital. There'll be too many questions and they wouldn't like the answers.\" She then turns back to Batman, \"She'll be fine with a bit of rest. You could also treat her back at the cave.\" Jason goes slack jawed again, \"How the hell does she know about the cave!?\" Sorry that it's been a while, but sometimes just stepping away from something is best for everyone. Can't make any promises of when the next update will be, but it'll come. I'm not someone who just works on something and not finish. Thanks for sticking with me!

I do not own Spy Kids. She took a look around her surroundings. Behind her was a beach with soft, white sand and clear blue ocean water. The smell of sand and salt water still in the air. In front of her laid an forrest with lush green grass and plants. There were cloroful flowers in her veiw and she could smell the grass, and the rain that had fallen just hours before. Who is she? Carmen Cortez, sixteen year old kid secret agent of the O.S.S Jr. And, She was on a mission. You may be wondering what this mission was. She had to retrieve a stolen jewel and get it back to the museum. She had no idea who stole the jewel or why. She had asked but her dad, the director of the O.S.S, gave her no answers. Carmen trekked through the forrest, using a small dagger to cut through the plants and wild grass. She soon found a fortress. She knew this had to be the place where the theif kept the jewel so she entered. The jewel was right there, in front of her, in a case. She had a strong feeling that something was not right. Just then, somebody jumped in front of her. She couldn't tell who it was for whoever it was, was wearing a pink ninja suit covering her face and body. She could tell that whoever it was has had deep brown eyes. \"Carmen Cortez,\" The person said, darkly. Carmen could tell that the voice was defiantly female. \"Who are you?\" Carmen asked. \"That's for me to know and you to not find out,\" the girl sneered. \"Get her!\" Another female voice screeched through some sort of intercom. All of the sudden, dozens of goons in ninja suits came out of nowhere. Carmen immediatly started to fight, but even more came. One kicked her causing her to fall on the ground. That's when a bunch of them started to surround her. Carmen tried to get up, but a goon put their foot on her, keeping her on the ground. Just then, somebody came to her rescue knocking the goon to the ground. The person struggled with the goon, for a while before thrusting them into the wall. Then he put on a mask, and threw down something that caused smoke to come out of it. The person then grabbed Carmen's hand, pulled her up, and took off running, pulling her with him. Carmen had no other thing to do but follow him out of the fortress. Once they were out, the person stopped, and looked over at Carmen. \"You alright?\" He asked in concern. Carmen didn't answer instead, she just said, \"What about the jewel? You just caused me my mission!\" \"I saved your life,\" The guy said. \"And, don't worry, I got that covered.\" He took something out of his pocket and showed it to you. It was a ruby. Carmen looked at him in surprise. \"How'd you get that?\" \"Easy, after I threw the smoke bomb, I went for it, then I got you,\" The guy said casually. Carmen squinted her eyes at him. She couldn't tell who it was because of the mask that he was wearing, but there was something about him that seemed so famillar. \"Who are you?\" She asked. The guy took of his mask and smirked at her. Carmen's eyes widened. It was Gary Giggles. He and his sister, Gerti were sort of rivals of Carmen and her younger brother Juni. But, Carmen had trusted Gary, due to her crush on him. But, he had betrayed her trust when he helped his father almost annhilate them and almost take over the world. But, his sister put a stop to that and Gary got demoted. Donnovan Giggles became good and helped Juni on a mission to save Carmen from a video game. Gary also became good and was winning a spy award when Carmen had called him in trouble. He immediatly came to save her. Carmen had not seen him since. \"Gary Giggles?\" She asked. Gary smirked, \"Carmen Cortez, it's good to see you again.\" \"What are you doing here?\" Carmen asked. \"Your dad had a feeling that this mission might be more dangerous than it seemed, and since Juni was on another mission, your dad asked me to accompany you on the mission, but you had already left so I had to follow you. Good thing I came in time to save you,\" Gary said with a smirk. \"Hey, I would have been able to get myself out of that mess,\" Carmen objected defensivaly. Gary looked at her, \"Come on, Carmen, you were surrounded. That goon could have killed you.\" Carmen smirked, \"You seem concerned about that.\" \"Well, they would have taken out one of the best spys,\" Gary replied. \"The O.S.S couldn't afford that.\" Carmen smirked, her brown eyes dancing. \"Right, right.\" Gary smiled at her. Just then, they were caught up in a net. So sorry I haven't updated in forever, but I'm working on the next chapter. Thank you so much for the support, love ya and so does God. God bless.[Chapter 2] I dedicate this story to my Everloving, Graceful, Forgiving, Faithful Father, without whom I couldn't write this. He is my Everything, and His name is Jesus. Before the disclaimer, I want to take the time to just say I am so sorry for being so slow in my story writing. I have gone through so much, but I'm going to try to do my best, and I thank you all for being so patient with me, and waiting for me to upload my stories. I ask for you to keep on waiting, and being patient while I do be best to update my current stories and maybe write some more. I want to explain why I have really been slow on this story. It's because I had something written on it, and then one page ended up ripping out, and then I lost the journal. I do think I did type some of it up, but I lost it. But you're support and reviews and follows/favorites have encouraged me to keep writing so thank you, and I'm so thankful to you all. God bless, He loves. Well, I do not own Spy Kids, the characters or anything I may add that I myself did not make up. Chapter is slightly revised but please read, for it is important. Well, I feel it is. I decided to split the second chapter into two chapters since it was so long. So you guys get a two for one. A dark purple gas filled the net causing the two who just broke eye contact and realized what happened to fall into a deep sleep. Gary woke up, somehow leaning against the net in a way that was not sitting up but wasn't quite laying down either. He looked around, and he found that Carmen curled up in a ball sleeping on the other side of the net. Gary couldn't help but smile at this picture. But realization of the situation that they were in set, so he got up and walked over to Carmen, who woke up, looking around. \"What?\" Realization set in and she realized that she had fallen asleep. At first she smiled, when she saw Gary, which made Gary feel good, but then she took on a nervous look and got up as far as she possibly could. Worry, and panic filled her for they were stuck in a net with no way out. Carmen got up, and began frantically looking for a way. She linked her hands in the holes of the net, and scanned the area, desperate for a way out. She gave a small prayer to God saying, 'Jesus, help us, nothing is to big for You,' Then she turned to see that Gary was still there in the very same spot doing nothing but sitting there with a thoughtful look on his face. \"Gary, can you stop sitting there and please come help me?\" she snapped much like she would if she was yelling at her younger brother Juni. She gave a weird look. She had never yelled at Gary like this before. She groaned. She must have been stressed due to the mission, and the fact that she hadn't had much sleep for that past few days. A voice interrupted her thoughts. \"Carmen,\" But she was too distracted in finding a way out to pay attention. \"How strong do you think this net is?\" She asked. \"Carmen,\" \"How far do you think we are?\" \"Carmen,\" Carmen felt the rope of the net. \"Feels like this net is made out of nylon rope, so if it got wet it could break. But we can't get water from here,\" \"Carmen,\" Gary called out finally getting the girl's attention. She looked at him, frustrated that he broke her thoughts. \"Yeah?\" Gary stood up. \"You might want to get away from there,\" He said. Confused as to what he might have meant or what he had in plan, she stepped away, and walked towards him. When she was close to him, he got in front of her making sure she'd be safe. He held out his arm which had a high tech watch that to Carmen's surprise looked like an average watch and wasn't that big. He pressed a button, and out came a ultra ray laser which he used to cut the circumference of the net while holding Carmen back with his arm to assure that she wouldn't get blasted by the laser. Then all of the sudden they fell out of the net, which thankfully was only two feet from the ground. Gary picked himself up, walked over to Carmen, and held out his hand to her. Carmen groaned, but gratefully took his hand, while he helped her up. She smiled thankfully at him, her brown eyes sparkling once again. This caused Gary to smile, softly. He sure hoped that she couldn't see him blushing. Carmen then grabbed his hand and turned it over to look at his watch. \"Where'd you get this new watch? It's not as big as all your other ones?\" She asked him in a more curious way. Gary took a deep breath. \"It's the latest gear, Carmen\" Gary told her smugly while smirking, though the glint in his eye told her that he was teasing. He cleared his throat. \"I realized that it's what's in an agent's head that makes the agent, and the big clunky stuff would only slow them down.\" He smiled at her. \"Besides, this smaller model is twice as good as any of those big model's I used to wear back in the day. \" Carmen smiled at this. Maybe he has changed. Gary continued. \"It may be small, but it's jam packed with a ton of useful stuff, Carmen,\" Carmen shook her head. Same old Gary. She sighed. \"Well, we better get back before something else happens,\" she said. Gary nodded in agreement, and the two left. Little did they know that they were being watched... \"So, where should we go?\" Carmen asked, not knowing where to go. \"Shouldn't you know?\" Gary asked, annoyed. He didn't mean to snap at the girl but they've been walking for hours. Carmen sighed. \"I lost my map, and there's not one on my watch,\" She sighed. Gary shook his head, held out his arm and pulled out his watch which had a global position system in it. He put in the coordinates and a map came up like a 3d screen. Carmen gaped in surprise. \"How'd that come out of that little watch?\" Gary smirked. \"You'll be surprised what the smallest packages can carry, Carmen,\" he said. Then he looked at the map, and pointed to the right. \"We go this way.\" Carmen followed him. They walked for what seemed like hours through a forest of bushes and trees. Thankfully, and oddly, Gary had a small dagger that came out of his small watch he used to cut through the forest. When they came through, they found to their displeasure, the same pink ninja along with a yellow ninja and about a dozen other black ninja's. Carmen groaned. \"Oh great,\" she said. \"It's a trap.\" The pink ninja nodded. \"Yes, it is a trap,\" she smirked, though you couldn't see behind her mask. \"And all you have to do is give us the ruby.\" Gary grimaced. \"Never!\" he yelled. The pink ninja looked at him. \"Oh, and you have to join us, Gary,\" Gary gaped at her. \"What?\" This time the yellow ninja spoke. \"You're bad, Gary. You belong on the bad side,\" she said. Gary shook his head. \"No, not anymore,\" he said with defiance. \"I don't know who you are. But, I'm good now.\" He looked to Carmen. \"And, I'm staying that way.\" The pink ninja smirked. \"Fine be that way,\" She yelled over to the other ninjas. \"Minions attack!\" The black ninja's along with the pink and yellow ninja's all surrounded Carmen. \"Gary!\" She yelled. \"Carmen!\" He yelled. Next thing he knew was the pink ninja getting cornering Carmen. Carmen had fear in her eyes. Without even thinking about it, Gary charged towards Carmen and the ninja. \"Watch it miss ninja,\" he warned. The ninja turned to him. \"Now you wouldn't hurt a girl, would you?\" She sneered. Gary knew that he couldn't hurt a girl, but he couldn't let her hurt Carmen, so he pushed a button on his watch and out came a rope, which wrapped around the girl's legs and pulled her away from Carmen. Gary then used the watch to tie up all the ninja's. He turned to Carmen, and held up his hand for her. \"Now what do you say, we get out of here?\" Gary asked. Carmen smiled, took his hand so he could help her up, and they used their jet boots to get off the island. But they couldn't help but feel like they forgot something. Just then, the yellow ninja came out of hiding and untied everyone. Once she tied the pink ninja, the pink ninja turned to her and said. \"You know what to do,\" The yellow ninja nodded, and walked away. When they made it back to the O.S.S Jr, they found Gerti Giggles, Gary's younger sister, and Carmen's best friend to be waiting for them. She perked up when she saw them. \"Oh you're back,\" She said happily to Carmen. Then she turned to Gary, and her face took on an annoyed one. \"Gary, you'll never believe who's here,\" she groaned. Both Carmen and Gary had a confused look. \"Who munch?\" he asked. And before Gerti could answer, Gregorio Cortez, Carmen's father, and the head of the O.S.S came into the O.S.S Jr lobby with a girl who looked about Carmen and Gary's age. She was tall, about 5'6, had blond, curly medium length hair, and really pretty silver blue eyes. The girl gasped when she saw Gary. She ran towards him and hugged him. \"Gary, Gary Giggles? Is that you?\" She asked. Gary looked confused. Who are these Ninja's? And who is this mysterious person that knows Gary? Hope you read this story. Review, if you want. Thanks and God bless. He loves you.[Chapter 3] I dedicate this to my awesome God, who I know I can trust. He is my Healer, and my Everything. I do not own Spy Kids or the characters. God bless He loves you. \"Yes, and who may I ask are you?\" The girl giggled cutely. \"Silly, it's me, Ellie. Eleanor R. Shaw,\" She said hopefully. \"We went to school together before you 'moved' and I never saw you again.\" She looked around. \"Well, now I know where you went. You didn't move, you just joined a spy group for kids.\" Gary's eyes widened.. \"Ellie?\" He gasped. \"Ellie?\" Ellie turned to him and nodded. \"Yep, that's me,\" She smiled. \"I missed you Gare Bear\" Curiosity stirred in Carmen. Who was this girl? Carmen stood there awkward while the two were talking, just waiting to be introduced. She took a look at Gertie who had a look of both confusion, and distrust. Suddenly Ellie finally noticed Carmen. \"Oh?\" She question. \"And who are you? She asked curiously. Carmen gave a small spy like smirk and held out her hand. \"Carmen Cortez,\" she said. \"Level 1 spy, and who are you and may I ask what are you doing here?\" She didn't mean it in a bad way, she was just simply being cautious like all spies should be. Elllie flipped her hair. \"I'm Ellie Shaw, and I'm a 2 spy,\" Michelle said, causing Gary's, Gerti's and Carmen's jaws all to gape. How was she a level two? Did she transfer from another spy organization or something? Just then Gregorio spoke. \"Carmen, Ellie will be working here from now on. I want you and Gary to show her the ropes and take her on some missions.\" Carmen, Gerti, and Juni who just came up to them all gasped. \"What about me?\" Juni asked. \"I'm her partner! Not..\" He looked at Gary with a mean look. \"him.\" Gary just looked at him. Carmen looked at her brother as if to say 'Leave him alone Juni'. Juni held up his hands as to surrender. Gregorio looked at his son. \"Juni, I need you and Gerti here at the head quarters doing equally important assignments. You will be partners on these assignments but with supervision.\" \"Me? With him? On assignments in the headquarters?\" She asked. Carmen took a look at her and could tell that even though her lips and her tone were saying no, that her bright blue eyes were saying 'yes'. Carmen knew that the little blond girl had a crush on her brother even though she tried to hide it, and even if it may be boring rinky dinky assignments at the headquarters for some reason spending the time with Juni excited the girl. Carmen didn't understand but she couldn't help but 'girl-power' fist bump her best friend which she gladly obliged. Gregorio turned to Gary and Carmen. \"Okay, now Carmen and Gary, can you show Ellie around headquarters?\" Carmen nodded. \"Sure dad,\" she nodded. Ellie eyes widened. \"He's your dad?\" she asked. Carmen nodded. \"Yes, he is,\" she smiled. Ellie turned to Gary. \"Oh, then you better be careful huh, Gare bear?\" Gary who was lost in his thoughts and looking at something or shall I say someone, looked up at Ellie confused. \"Huh?\" Ellie smirked. \"Well, aren't you dating? you'll want to be careful and not hurt her.\" Both Gary and Carmen blushed and before Gary could reply Carmen answered as quickly as she could. \"Me and Gary,\" She scoffed in a repulsed tone, as if she'd never give it a second chance. \"we're not dating.\" This put a sting, or rather a million stings in Gary's heart, and he didn't know why, or did he? Before Ellie could ask any other questions, Carmen said. \"Now, come on, we better get going.\" Carmen and Gary gave a full detailed tour of the O.S.S Jr. They showed her the debriefing room, where they go to get the subs, the lunchroom, the office room, and then finally the gadget room. Carmen walked up the to door. \"Okay, now here's the gadget room, but be very careful,\" She said. Ellie nodded. Carmen opened the door and inside there were every kind of gadget imaginable. Carmen picked up what looked like a gumball, opened it and put it in her mouth. She chewed it, took it out of her mouth and threw it in the air. \"That is an electrical gumball made by Machete. He makes a lot of the gadgets you might use here,\" she said. Michelle looked at the ceiling were the gum landed. \"Ew,\" she shuddered. Gary gave a smirk. \"Some of the gadgets don't always work,\" Carmen looked at him with a look that could kill and said 'that's my uncle'. He returned the look with one that said. 'I'm just saying.' Gary sighed. \"But, Machete is getting better at making gadgets and a lot of his newer ones are actually pretty good.\" He held up his arm, and showed Ellie the watch that was on his arm. \"Like this watch.\" Carmen gasped and looked at Gary. \"That watch was made by Machete?\" She asked. Gary nodded. \"Yes, yes it is, Carmen, the first prototype in fact,\" Gary said with a smirk on his face. Carmen was still in awe. Just then Ellie spoke up. \"Ooh, what's this?\" Carmen looked away from Gary's gaze, and saw that was in her hands was what looked liked a normal flower hair clip but was actually a really cool gadget. Carmen walked over to her. \"Oh, that is not your ordinary hair clip,\" Carmen said with a smirk. \"Can I see that?\" Ellie gave it to her. Carmen put it in her hair, and pressed a button. Out came little pellets that then burst in the air. \"These only hurt the enemies like little be-be pellets but while stinging like bee's. It doesn't harm them any more. It also does this,\" Carmen walked to a locked door, pressed a peddle on the flower of the clip and out came a barely visible laser that went from the clip to the lock and unlocked the door. Carmen opened the door with a breeze. \"It's a hair clip that unlocks doors with out having to take the clip out your hair, and you having to hassle with trying to pick the lock,\" Carmen said. \"And it does a lot more.\" She pulled out the clip and gave it to her. \"Here you can keep it.\" Ellie smiled, and put it in her hair. While she was in awe of the gadget, Carmen couldn't help but see a intelligable glint in her eye. A glint that gave Carmen the message that she needed be careful around this girl. \"Thanks Carmie,\" She hugged her. Carmen hugged back but with a weird look and not just because the name that was just given to her. Gary couldn't help but chuckle. Carmen glared at him. Just then Gerti came into the room. \"Hey Carmen, your dad wants to see you and Gary,\" she said. \"It's about the mission from earlier.\" Carmen let go of Ellie, and nodded. \"Okay, Gerti, we'll be right there,\" she said. Gerti nodded and left. Carmen turned to Ellie. \"Well, we'll see you later okay?\" Ellie nodded. With a wave, Carmen and Gary left and went to the debriefing room. When they got there, they both sat down at the table across for Gregorio. Gregorio looked at them. \"Carmen, Gary, how did the mission go?\" he asked. Carmen sighed. She would only have to tell her dad the truth. \"It went fine, we had a few minor setbacks, but all in all it was a success,\" Gary looked at her, but knew that the report she gave was true. Gregorio nodded. \"What setbacks?\" He asked concerned for his daughter. Carmen scrunched up her nose. \"I'll tell you later, it's kind of a long story. But, Gary saved the day three times . I really owe it to him,\" Carmen knew that God had used Gary to help them get through the mission, and if it wasn't for God or Gary then they probably wouldn't have made it alive. Gregorio looked impressed. \"Really?\" Carmen nodded. He looked to Gary. \"Thank you, Gary, for saving my daughter.\" Gary nodded. \"No problem sir,\" Gary said, rather humbly which shocked both Carmen and Gregorio. Gregorio looked to the two teens. \"Now, do you have the ruby?\" he asked. Realization hit Carmen. The ruby, that she was sent to retrieve. She had been so distracted with everything; the first ninja ambush, Gary saving her, Gary finding the ruby for her when she lost it, apparently the first time, getting lost in Gary's eyes, then them getting trapped in the net, Gary finding a way out, the second ambush, the ninja's trying to get Gary to become bad again, him refusing and saving her again, and then the new girl Ellie coming. Carmen snapped out of her thoughts to reach into her pocket to get it, but panic struck her as she could not find the jewel. She searched all over her pockets and through her bag. Where could it be? Gregorio looked at her. \"Problem Carmen?\" Carmen looked at him anxiously. \"I don't understand,\" She said. \"the thing I remember was that I lost the ruby and then Gary...\" She looked at Gary. Gary looked at Carmen, gave a light chuckle and a sheepish smile. Well, there it is. I really hope you liked this chapter. Who are these ninja's? Who is Ellie? Yes, I know I changed her name, I had to for certain reasons. Does Gary have the ruby? What will happen? Hope you read and review if you want. Thanks and God bless, He loves you.

I only own my character, Charlotte. Okay, so, I'm going back and revising the chapters that I already published to change and add some things in it. Chapter One (Revised on July 31, 2010) The ride back home from town wasn't that far and it didn't take that long. John Tunstall, a kind Englishman in his late forties, and Josiah 'Doc' Scurlock, a nice young man in his late teens or early twenties, were just coming back from there. While they were in town, they met Billy. A young man about seventeen or eighteen. Billy was running away from some people and John offered him a room to stay at in his home with the rest of the Regulators. When they arrived at the house, the Regulators were outside and, of course, there was fighting. The fighting was always between the same three people. A dirty man, an Indian, and a girl. The Indian was holding the girl back as she tried to get to the other man that she was arguing with. \"You idiot! You want to know what I really think of you? I think that you're-\" She started to yell at him in her English accent that sounded similar to John's. \"Faith, calm down,\" a man intervened. He had short brown hair and he seemed like the leader of the group. \"Don't tell me what to do; got that Dick ,\" she said, turning around to glare at him. \"John's back,\" another person said. He had curly brown and was a tiny bit chubby. John pulled the wagon up to the house and Doc and Billy got out of the wagon. \"What happened now?\" John sighed, but he was smiling at them. The girl and the dirty man tried to explain at the same time and their words were being mixed together. \"One at a time. Faith, you may go first.\" \"Steve said that he wouldn't get into another fight with Chavez and that he would keep his comments to himself. Well, he got into a fight and then he brought me into it.\" \"How did he do that?\" John asked her. \"Chavez and I were talking then Steve came up and started talking about Chavez like he normally does. I attempted to make him stop, but then he called me a-\" \"There ain't no need to go into that,\" the man said, interrupting her. \"It's 'There is no need to go into that,' not 'There ain't no need to go into that.' Also, there is a reason to go into what you called me.\" \"No, there ain't.\" \"Yes, there is and it's 'isn't' not 'ain't.'\" \"Stop arguing,\" the man with the short hair exclaimed. He then turned to John, Doc, and Billy. \"I'm Richard Brewer.\" \"I'm Charley,\" the man with the curly brown hair said. \"Steve,\" the dirty man said, nodding his head towards Billy. His face wasn't that clean and he was chewing tobacco. \"Chavez,\" the Indian said, letting go of the girl. \"Josiah, but you can call me Doc.\" \"I'm John Tunstall and this is my niece, Charlotte Rebecca Tunstall.\" \"But you may call me Faith,\" the girl added. \"This is William and he'll be staying here with us. You'll be staying in the bunkhouse with the rest of the boys. If you don't want to, then you can take the Santa Fe out to Albuquerque in the morning. If you do want to stay, then we have the job for you,\" John said. \"Go on, get!\" Billy yelled at the pigs in the pigpen. \"Did you know that pigs are as smart as dogs?\" Charley asked, walking up to Billy and the pigpen. \"I knew a guy who taught his pigs how to bark at strangers.\" Billy pulled his gun out and pointed it at the pigs. \"But I ain't no pistoleer or knifesmith like that Chavez. I'm a pugilist, but I ain't gonna expect you to know the meaning of that word.\" \"Hell, you don't even know why I'm here,\" Billy said, smirking and putting away his gun. \"Sure, you're a petty thief,\" but Billy had shook his head. \"Rob a bank? Kill somebody?\" This time, Billy nodded his head. \"Huh, killed somebody,\" Charley said, looking a little surprised. \"Regulators!\" Dick yelled. \"Cattle's looking spooked, let's take a look!\" \"Whoa, boy! You ain't a regulator; you got to stay here,\" Charley said as Billy looked around and was about to get away from the pigpen. Charley walked away to the stable to get a horse. Then, he rode off with the rest of them. \"Don't mind them; Charley is always like that to the new guys,\" a voice said. Billy turned around and saw John's niece, Charlotte Rebecca. \"You're Charlotte Rebecca, right?\" Billy said. \"It's just Faith,\" she said, walking towards him. \"Why?\" He asked as she sat on one of the posts of the pigpen. \"It's better than saying Charlotte Rebecca, William.\" \"It's Billy,\" he said. \"See, it's for the same reason you like to be called Billy.\" He just shook his head and finally got a good look at her. She had dark, black hair and bright blue-green eyes. She looked to be about medium height and her hair was past her shoulders. He looked at her dress, but she wasn't wearing one. She was wearing men's clothing. \"It's more comfortable to wear this than a dress out here,\" she said, noticing his look at her clothing. \"William, Charlotte Rebecca, it's time to get ready to eat!\" they heard John say from the house. They both got out of the pigpen and started walking towards the house. \"What does he mean by that?\" Billy asked Faith. \"It means we have to wash up and get our dinner clothes on, but we might not tonight since you don't have any yet. Or did you bring another set of clothing with you?\" She asked him as they got nearer to the house. He shook his head and they got to the door. \"So, how do you like taking care of the pigs?\" Faith asked as she opened the door. Billy had let her gone in first and followed after her. The house was spacious and looked cozy. \"It's alright, I suppose,\" he said. \"Ah, Charlotte Rebecca, please show Master William where we wash up at and tomorrow we will go get your dinner clothes,\" John said as he saw them come in. \"Yes, Uncle John,\" Faith said and she made a face at her name. She led him through the house and into a small room. Inside was a washstand with some water in it. \"I suppose Dick already filled it up. Oh, you never did answer my question,\" Faith said, as Billy finished washing. \"What question?\" \"The one about you taking care of the pigs,\" she replied. \"What about it?\" \"Do you like taking care of them?\" \"Not really; I'm better with cattle.\" \"Oh, well, maybe Uncle John can let you work them,\" Faith said when she was finished washing. \"You don't look like him,\" Billy remarked. \"How so?\" \"The only thing have in common is your accents and maybe your eyes,\" he said as they walked out of the room. Faith led him to the table where everything was set up. The others came in and went to the washing room. \"Well, maybe I don't want to look like him.\" \"But what if you do?\" \"But I don't,\" she said as the others came to the table. Doc pulled out her chair and she sat down. \"I think you do,\" he said, taking a chair across from her. \"Well, I don't,\" she said as the others sat down. \"William, Charlotte Rebecca, are you two getting along?\" John asked them. \"Yes, we are,\" Faith said, as everyone began to bow their heads for the prayer. Billy looked at Faith and she mouthed, \"We pray before every meal,\" and she bowed her own head as Billy did the same. Reviews are greatly welcomed. :)[Chapter 2] Chapter Two – \"Hacking on me.\" I don't own Young Guns. I only own my character, Charlotte. Okay, so, I'm going back to the chapters that I already published to revise and add some things. Chapter Two (Revised August 1, 2010) \"Well, now, look at those appetites. William, have some more,\" John said. Billy looked up at him and got some food from a bowl. \"Billy, have you ever worked beef before?\" Dick asked, breaking the silence. \"A little; I did some work for Pete Maxwell in Fort Summer,\" Billy answered. Charley and Steve snickered at that. Everybody else looked over at them and John didn't look too happy at what they did. \"Is that so jolly funny, Master Steven? That's no proper table manners,\" John said to him. \"He's got a way with hogs,\" Charley snickered to Steve. \"Congratulations, Charles, you and Steven will do the dirty crockery alone tonight.\" Faith glanced over at them and they didn't look too bothered by that. \"Apologize to Master William.\" \"Sorry, Billy,\" Charley laughed. \"Yeah, sorry, Billy. We were just hacking on you,\" Dirty Steve said. \"Rumor has it that you killed a man. Why'd you kill him?\" Dick asked, trying to get back into a conversation with Billy. \"He was hacking on me,\" Billy said and he looked at Charley and Steve when he said this. They both gulped and looked at each other. Faith laughed, but covered it up by coughing. John looked at her and smiled a little at her. Dinner was soon over and Charley and Steve did the dirty crockery. The rest of the regulators talked to Billy, but he mostly hung around Faith. They would tease her and Billy would laugh along with them. She would retort something back or laugh along. Night was coming soon and it was getting darker outside. The settled around the fire while Doc and Dick sat the table. John had gotten a newspaper and the boys would take turns reading parts of it. Billy looked a tad bit surprised when Faith had started reading. \"You learn how to read at an early age when you have John for an uncle,\" Doc said to Billy, while she was reading. After her, it was Dirty Steve's turn. He had trouble with a few words especially with the word succeed. Dick made a comment saying that there was room full of people that wouldn't succeed in life in front of them. \"Well done Master Steven. William, it's your turn now,\" John said as Dirty Steve handed Billy the newspaper. \"Yeah, sure,\" Billy said, not taking the paper. \"Billy, here you learn how to read and write. You need more than the skill with a firearm in the world,\" Faith said. He looked over at her and started to read. \"Young men who don't know how to do any kind of business have no energy or application and have better stay at home near their relatives so they can be taken care of. They are not wanted here and will only come to grief, but men of enterprise are practically sure of success,\" he reads. He looked up when he was done and John was smiling. \"See, that wasn't too hard, now was it?\" Billy looked over and saw Faith smiling at him. \"Splendid! A splendid reading, Master William; thank you. Good night gentlemen, good night Charlotte Rebecca; don't stay up too late,\" John said as he walked out of the room to go to his bedroom. As he walked past Billy, he ruffled his hair. \"Goodnight, Tunstall,\" the boys chorused. \"Goodnight, Uncle John,\" Faith said. \"So, Billy, did you actually kill a man for hacking on you?\" Charley asked him when John left. \"Yeah,\" he said and Faith snickered. \"What's so funny, Charlotte Rebecca?\" Charley asked, glaring at her. \"Now, let's not start a fight,\" Dick said. \"Come on, it's time to go to bed.\" He walked out of the room with Doc behind him. Charley and Dirty Steve followed them and Chavez stayed behind. \"I'll show you where you'll be staying,\" he said and Billy followed him out to the bunkhouse. \"Good night,\" Faith said to the regulators. \"Good night,\" they replied. \"Good night, Faith,\" Billy said. Faith walked over to room, across from her uncle's, and looked out the window. Her window faced towards the bunkhouse. She could faintly hear Dirty Steve and Chavez arguing. Then, the faint yelling of Dick telling them to shut up. She smiled and shook her head. Even though they can get on her nerves and irritate her to no end, they were like her older brother except for Billy. She didn't know him well enough to determine what he would be like. She closed the curtains and got ready to go to bed. He acted different from most of the male population in Lincoln County. She could tell that he didn't trust them completely yet, but she hoped that he would trust them. Please review! :)[Chapter 3] Chapter Three – Mr. Murphy I don't own Young Guns. I only own my character, Charlotte Okay, so, I'm going back and revising the chapters that I already published to change and add some things in it. Chapter Three (Revised August 1, 2010) The next afternoon there was some trouble between Mr. Murphy and John Tunstall. Mr. Murphy didn't like that John had a store because his customers switched their business from his store to John's. \"John, Mr. Dolan and Mr. Murphy here are complaining about their merchandise wagon being plundered on several occasions on their way into town. Quite frankly, John, they think you're behind it,\" Brady said. Some of the men whistled and looked at Faith, but she ignored them; she was looking for Billy. Billy was hiding out in the pigpen; definitely not his first choice of hiding place. \"That's a fargin' lie and you know it!\" Dick yelled at them. \"Richard!\" John reprimanded. \"Sheriff Brady, Mr. Murphy is going to continue coming to you and claiming I've taken his property until I'm pronounced a thief and shaken out of Lincoln. I've never touched his property because I have no cause to.\" \"Well, the Belted Earl has spoken,\" Murphy said. He was a man a little bit older than John Tunstall. \"Look behind you, Earl, all I see is hired thieves and probably household entertainment,\" Murphy said, with a look towards Faith. Faith glared at him while Doc got in front of her. Billy could feel his finger inching towards the trigger of gun when Murphy said that about Faith. \"Don't ever talk about Faith like that,\" Dirty Steve said, glaring at him. \"These boys are promising young men, acquiring an education. As for Charlotte Rebecca, she is a young woman who is growing up quite nicely into a woman,\" John said. \"And she isn't household entertainment,\" Charley put in. \"Well, I had you pegged as the type that, uh, likes educating young boys, Englishman. Rumor has it that you want to be bidding against me for the Government beef contracts. It is just a rumor, isn't it?\" Murphy said to John. \"Lawrence, you have a beef outfit and a store and I have a beef outfit and a store. You're going to try to make money and I'm going to try to make money. It is simple and it's fair,\" John said. Murphy led John away from the group of people and over toward the pigpen where Billy was hiding in. \"You see our good sheriff sitting up there on that horse? Do you know how much money he's got invested in my store? His life savings, John, and it's not just Brady who wants me to acquire those contracts. It's the Territorial District Attorney, the Chief Justice, the U.S. District Attorney, the Chief Justice, and the Santa Fe Ring. It's a family ring, John, and you don't come prancing in here with your fat foreign capital and try to change things!\" \"I made a very long steamship journey from London with my late brother and his family, Mr. Murphy. So, I should be damned if I'm going to be dissuading by something as ugly as political corruption. So, I'd like you to take your threats and your sheriff and get off my property!\" John said back to Murphy. He just looked at him before walking back to his horse. John looked down at the pigpen and saw Billy hiding there. \"You are ambitious, Earl, but you'd be better off selling ladies' undergarments in Hempstead,\" Murphy said. His men laughed at what he had said and the regulators all cocked their guns. \"Alright men, that's enough. Clear the way!\" Brady said as the Regulators put away their guns. \"This is a new country. We won't be bowing down to you any more, Englishman. Get ready for hell!\" Murphy said. He and his men rode off on their horses. Some looked back and winked at Faith. \"Even though you're wearing men's clothing, you still look good,\" one yelled back to her. The Regulators got their guns and pointed them at him as he rode away laughing. \"Back to work, chaps,\" John said, walking away from the pigpen. \"Charlotte Rebecca?\" \"Yes sir?\" She answered. \"Will you please go ahead and start lunch?\" \"Yes, Uncle John,\" she replied and walked towards the house. \"Billy, you can come out now,\" John said as he went towards the house with Faith. \"Mr. Tunstall, my name is William McCloskey. I heard that you were having some trouble finding help,\" said the newcomer. \"McCloskey, you're one of Murphy's men aren't you?\" John asked. \"I used to be. They fired me because I called him a fat Sal,\" he said, laughing. \"Did you?\" John asked, smiling a little. \"Bunkhouse is over there,\" he said, pointing and he walked back inside the house. McCloskey started to walk towards the bunkhouse. The Regulators, John, and Faith rode into town. John said something about getting Billy and McCloskey some supper clothes. Billy came out of the store with some new pants, a shirt, jacket, hat, and some shoes on. John stood in the doorway of the store with Faith while Billy looked in the store window at himself. He put the hat on and John put a pocket watch in his coat pocket. Billy smiled and twirled his guns. \"Well, don't you look handsome?\" Faith said, walking over towards him. She stood by her uncle while Billy put his guns away. \"Thank you, Faith,\" he said. John has been teaching him some manners. \"You're welcome,\" she replied. Across the street Murphy and some of his men were watching them. Reviews are greatly welcomed! :)[Chapter 4] Chapter Four – Happy New Years Here is Chapter Four of Take Care of Her! I don't own Young Guns. I only own Charlotte Rebecca Faith. Chapter Four A few months have passed since Billy came to live with John Tunstall and the Regulators. Time passed quickly and soon it was the end of December. John had taken back to town to get them some new clothes for the New Year Eve's party. At first, he wasn't going to let Faith go, but after some persuasion from Doc, Dick, and a little bit from Billy, he had agreed to let her come as long as she wore a dress. \"Charlotte Rebecca, come on!\" John yelled for the third time. \"I'm not coming out!\" She yelled back. She knew that she had to wear a dress, but not this kind. It was a dark blue color and went down to her feet. It was tight until it got to her waist where it flowed down. It had long sleeves and they flowed from her elbows down and had lace at the end. The sash was tied nicely in the back. Her hair was curled and the front was pulled back with a clip. Even though she looks nice, she wasn't going to go outside her room looking like this. \"If you don't come out right now, then you aren't coming!\" She sighed and opened the door. She didn't see anybody inside the house, but she did hear gunshots and Billy's familiar laughter. She opened the front the door and walked out. The laughter stopped and everybody looked at her. \"What?\" She asked. \"Charlotte Rebecca, you look beautiful like your mother,\" John told her. She blushed slightly and walked towards them. \"Thank you Uncle John,\" She replied. \"Well, what do you know, she's actually a girl,\" Charley said. \"Shut up, Charley,\" She said. \"Regulators, let's dance!\" The party had already started and was in full swing when they arrived. They all rode on horses except for John and Faith; they rode in the wagon. They tied up their horses and Billy helped Faith out of the wagon. As soon as her feet hit the ground, she went off with some other girls. \"Thank you, Billy!\" She yelled back to him. He tipped his hat to her and went off to where other people were dancing at. Steve, Charley, and McCloskey were all drinking, John was talking to Alex McSween and his wife, and Dick and Doc were talking to each other. Billy was dancing with a pretty girl. \"Look at that body go,\" McCloskey commented as Billy started doing a jig. \"He ain't all there is he?\" Steve asked. \"Nope, and as Charlotte Rebecca would say,\" Charley said, using his best English accent, \"It's isn't, not ain't.\" Then, they all started laughing. \"Looks like one of your uncle's new helpers is dancing with Mary,\" Faith's best friend Clara said. Faith looked over and saw Billy dancing with her. \"Oh, that's Billy,\" Faith said as she and the girls walked over towards Charley, Steve, and McCloskey. \"He's a pretty good dancer,\" Elizabeth commented. \"I suppose so.\" \"Nope, and as Charlotte Rebecca would say, it's isn't not ain't,\" Charley laughed. \"That's correct Charles and I'm glad you remembered that,\" Faith said coolly. They all turned around and saw her standing there with Clara and Elizabeth. \"Well, um, he's there enough to be dancing with a pretty gal while we're sitting here pulling our tallywhackers,\" Charley said, looking a little embarrassed. \"Damn straight,\" McCloskey said. The guys all looked at each other and went separate ways. The girls just looked at each other and laughed at them. \"Well, Miss Charlotte Rebecca, I think you look quite pretty in your dress,\" said a man. She turned around and saw a young man. \"Do I know you?\" \"Oh, I'm John Roberts,\" he replied. She looked at her friends and saw the same confused looks on their faces. \"Well, it was nice meeting you, John, but I need to go talk to my uncle,\" Faith said, walking away from him with her friends following her. \"That was strange.\" \"Yes, it was, but he was also kind of cute,\" Clara said. Faith laughed and started to walk away from her uncle. \"I thought you had to talk to your uncle?\" \"It was an excuse to get away from John,\" Elizabeth said, shaking her head. The song changed to a slow one and they ran into somebody. \"Oh, excuse us,\" Faith said and she saw an older looking man with a woman. \"It's quite alright, ma'm,\" he said. \"Pat Garret.\" \"Charlotte Rebecca Tunstall,\" she said, curtsying. \"Well, we got a request for the band,\" he said. \"Go right ahead,\" Faith said, moving out of their way; her friends moving with her. Pat and his friend moved past them and towards the band. \"Well, it seems like you can't keep away from the guys tonight,\" Elizabeth remarked. \"And what's that suppose to mean?\" \"First, there was that John person and then there was Pat Garret. Who'll be next?\" \"No one because I won't run into anyone any-\"she didn't finish her sentence because tripped, but she didn't fall. \"Thank you,\" she said, looking up to see Billy there. \"I never thought you were the clumsy kind,\" he remarked. \"I'm not, it's the dress.\" \"Of course, blame the dress,\" Clara said and Faith glared at her. \"May I have this dance?\" McCloskey asked Clara. \"Yes, you may,\" and he took her hand. \"Well, I best be looking for my family,\" Elizabeth said, leaving. \"Oh, well, thank you for not letting me fall,\" Faith said again. \"Oh, you're quite welcome, Miss Charlotte Rebecca,\" Billy said, smirking at her. \"It's Faith, not Charlotte Rebecca,\" she said, glaring at him. Billy laughed at her and she just started to walk away from him and towards Doc. \"I saw that you met Pat Garret,\" he said, catching up to her. \"Yes, I did,\" she said, nearing him and saw that Alex was there. \"Faith, it's good to see you!\" Susan exclaimed. \"I knew that dress would fit you.\" \"So, this was your idea?\" She asked, motioning towards the dress and she nodded her head. \"You must Billy,\" she said, looking at him. \"John was telling us about you.\" Billy looked a bit embarrassed and Faith laughed at him. \"Somebody break up your dance?\" Alex asked Doc. \"Yeah, he's the girl's guardian.\" \"What girl and who's her guardian?\" Faith asked. \"The girl I was dancing with and her guardian is Murphy.\" \"Guardian? That's a gentle euphemism,\" Alex remarked. \"What do you mean?\" Faith asked. \"He had a shirt ruined in the Silver City laundry. He took the celestial woman's daughter as payment.\" \"What?\" \"She house entertainment as I understand it. Come on, you can dance with Susan; it's safer.\" \"No, thanks,\" Doc said. \"You can dance with me. I haven't danced at all so far,\" Faith said. \"Nobody's offered?\" \"Kind of. There was this one person named John Roberts and he just came up out of nowhere and said how nice I looked in this dress. I didn't know him, but apparently he knew me.\" \"John Roberts? Isn't he one of the new settlers in town?\" Susan asked Alex. \"Yes, I think he came by the store earlier this week and John was talking to him about you.\" \"Why would he do that?\" \"To make sure you get married.\" \"But I'm too young to get married.\" \"No, in a few years you'll be considered an old maid,\" Susan said. \"What if I want to become an old maid?\" \"You're too pretty to become one. Now, go find your uncle and maybe he'll dance with you.\" \"Oh, alright,\" Faith said and started to look around for him when she saw him standing next to Charley who was fighting another man. She walked up to him, but stayed back to make sure she doesn't get into the fight. \"Pugilist,\" she heard Billy mutter behind her. \"He's something, ain't he,\" Doc said. \"It's isn't, not ain't,\" Faith corrected. \"Can't you stop correcting us?\" Doc asked. \"No,\" she said. The fight broke up and the other man walked away from Charley. \"Happy New Year!\" A cowboy shouted and shot off his gun. \"Happy New Year!\" Billy and Doc yelled together and shot off their guns. After everyone stopped their shooting, they began to dance. \"May I have this dance?\" Billy asked her. \"Yes, you may,\" the song was a slow one and Billy was good dancer. The next morning, they were headed back towards the house. The boys were on their horses, singing way off key and John and Faith were in the buggy laughing at them. The boys saw some pheasants and started chasing after them. Billy stayed beside John and looked at the other boys. \"Go on Billy, boys will be boys,\" John said, smiling. \"Faith, do you want to come?\" Billy asked her. \"No, thank you,\" she said, shaking her head. \"Okay, then,\" he was about to ride off with the others when John stopped him. \"Billy, will you promise me something?\" \"What is it, John?\" \"Please take care of her.\" \"Take care of who?\" \"Charlotte Rebecca,\" he said. Billy looked at him strangely before riding off. \"Uncle, what do you mean?\" She asked him. \"It's nothing, Faith,\" he answered. \"You actually called me Faith,\" she said, surprised. He just gave her a small smile and watched the boys ride off. The sound of horses was getting near and John turned around. \"Get down,\" he said. \"What?\" she asked. \"Charlotte, get down now!\" She glanced at him, confused, but did as she was told. She sat down on the floor of the buggy; sound of horses was getting louder and nearer. The sound of guns cocking surrounded the buggy. Then, there was shooting. Blood splattered on Faith as she screamed. John's body fell on top of her and out of the buggy. The horse fell down and tried to get up, but it was shot. \"Get out of here!\" Doc yelled. \"What about Faith?\" Chavez yelled back. The men who shot John rode off towards the Regulators and just left his body there. Faith got out of the buggy and went towards her uncle's body. \"Uncle John, come on, please get up,\" Faith whispered; tears filling her eyes. She sat down beside him and let the tears fall. She could hear the others calling her name, but she ignored him. The horse was and so was her uncle. She turned him over so that he was lying on his back. She saw the gunshot wounds, but still couldn't believe it. \"You can't be dead, you just can't be.\" She felt somebody grab her arm and she looked up; it was Billy. He hauled her to her feet and up onto his horse. She wrapped her arms around him and he rode off towards the house. The others were riding around, trying to lose Murphy's men. When Billy and Faith arrived at the house, he put his horse in the stable and Faith went inside. She looked in the mirror and saw blood on her face, hands, and clothing. Her eyes were red from crying and there was dirt on her dress from when she sat on the ground next to her uncle. She heard Billy come in and he stood beside her. \"Are you okay?\" he asked her. \"What's going to happen now?\" She asked her voice hoarse. \"Well, I'm going to take care of you like I promised him.\" \"How?\" \"I'm not sure, but I guess the first thing would be to get you cleaned up. So, um, I guess you need to get the blood off and get changed.\" She nodded her head and walked towards her room. Billy followed shortly after; brining water and a cloth. She got the blood off and went to her wardrobe. She got out trousers and a shirt. Billy left the room and she changed; leaving her dress on the floor. She crawled into her bed and under the covers. Her eyes felt heavy and slowly closed; darkness overcoming her. Please Review! (:[Chapter 5] Chapter Five - The McSweens I don't own Young Guns...I only own Faith Tunstall. Sorry I haven't updated in awhile. School started and it doesn't exactly help that I kind of broke the computer...but it's now fixed and hopefully I won't break it again because my dad was kind of mad that it was. The bad part is that everything had to be deleted off of it for it to be able to work because this thing called ThinkPoint somehow installed itself onto my netbook and it basically shut down my computer. When I turned the computer on, all that would pop up is a black screen with a blinking, white cursor in the upper left corner. So, everything got deleted and this is just something that I quickly put together because I felt like I had to write something for Take Care of Her . So, now, read on and see if you like it! (: Chapter Five When I woke up, it was lighter outside and my eyes and head hurt from all the crying I did. I felt absolutely horrible and the yelling from outside my room didn't help any. \"Charlotte Rebecca is going to stay with Alex and Susan,\" Dick said, sounding mad. \"No, Faith is going to stay with me,\" Billy argued. \"Why do you keep saying that?\" \"Because she is!\" \"Says who?\" \"John did!\" \"When?\" Dick asked, their voices getting louder. \"Before he died, he made me promise him to take care of her!\" Billy yelled, sounding frustrated. I slowly sat up and got out of bed. I went to door and opened it. There, outside my door, stood Doc, Charley, Dirty Steve, Chavez, Dick, and Billy who looked like they were about to kill each other. \"Faith, are you okay?\" \"No, not really.\" \"Are you ready for the funeral?\" Doc asked gently. \"As ready as I'll ever be,\" I answered. \"Well, I guess we should start going then,\" Dick said. \"Come on, Faith,\" Billy said, leading out the door and to his horse. \"What were you and Dick arguing about?\" I asked him. \"About what's gonna happen to you,\" he answered, getting on his horse. \"Going to,\" I automatically corrected. \"And what's going to happen to me?\" \"You're staying with Alex and Susan,\" he replied, helping me up. \"But I heard you say that I wasn't,\" I said, confused why he said that. \"Oh, so you were eavesdropping?\" He said that familiar smirk on his face as we started away from the house. \"It's not eavesdropping when you're yelling outside my door.\" \"Yes it is, but maybe you staying with Alex and Susan will be the best for you.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"John said to take care of you and I don't think that you coming with me to bring down Murphy and his men would be the best thing for you.\" \"But-\" I started to protest. \"I know you don't want to, but it's for the best.\" \"But-\" I tried again. \"We'll talk more after the funeral.\" At the funeral, Dick was reading some passages from the Bible while I stood beside Billy. The coffin was already in the ground and someone was there to cover it up with the dirt when Dick was finished. Susan was there, wearing a black dress, and she was looking at me sympathetically. Soon, he was done and I couldn't stop the tears that were pouring out of my eyes as the man covered the casket. Billy squeezed my hand and I hugged him, burying my head into his shoulder. He was shocked, I could tell from the way he stiffened, but then he wrapped his arms around me. His shirt was getting wet from my tears and he slowly pulled away from me. He looked down at me and there was something in his eyes, something I couldn't place. I looked back up at him and he opened his mouth to say something, but before he could Dick came up to us. \"Billy, come along. Faith, stay with Susan,\" he said, taking Billy with him and the others to meet with the Justice of the Peace. I slowly dried my tears and faced Susan. \"Hey, don't worry about it,\" she smiled at me, though her eyes looked sad. \"I'm trying not to,\" I replied, smiling back through my tears. \"Why did Dick take Billy to meet the Justice of the Peace?\" \"They're going to be deputized and get Murphy's men.\" \"Really?\" I asked, as they came back towards us and saw their new badges. \"Yes, and isn't that the John Roberts man you met at the party?\" \"Where?\" \"Right there,\" and I saw him standing near Murphy's store with Murhpy's men with him. \"I suppose it it,\" I answered. \"Faith, we're going to go back to John's place and get your things while the rest will take Susan home,\" Alex said before Susan could say anything. \"Yes sir,\" I replied as I got into his buggy. When we arrived back at my uncle's home, I hurried up and got out of the buggy before Alex could help me out. The faster I got my things, the faster I could leave. I went inside to my room and got a trunk from the corner of my room. I packed my man clothes and the dress that I wore to the New Year Eve's party. I closed the trunk after it became full. Alex came into the room while I was packing and he took the trunk out to buggy then we set off to his home where the Regulators were waiting for us. The McSweens lived outside of town and they had a beautiful home. I saw everybody's horses tied on the post and they were waiting outside the house for us. When Alex pulled the buggy up to the house, Billy helped me while the others took the trunk inside. \"Faith, I'm going to put the trunk into the room you'll be staying in,\" Alex said and I nodded my head. He and Charley lifted it and headed towards the door. \"Well, all of you must hungry so before you leave I'm going to fix you lunch. Faith, you don't have to help,\" Susan said as I moved towards her when she mentioned lunch. The Regulators followed her inside except for Billy. \"So, you're going to get all of Murphy's men?\" I asked Billy I started to walk towards the side of the house. \"Yeah, and you're going to stay here while we do it,\" Billy replied, following me. \"And what if I don't?\" \"Then I won't be able to fulfill my promise to John.\" \"But I don't you to leave me with Alex and Susan. I mean, they are wonderful people, but they won't…\" I trailed off. \"They won't what?\" Billy pressed. \"They just won't!\" I huffed. Billy laughed at my childish reply. \"Don't worry. I promise I'll write and visit when I can,\" he said. \"You do?\" I asked. \"Yeah,\" he replied, grabbing my waist and moving me towards the side of the house. He pushed me against the side of it and looked down at me. I looked up into his blue eyes and he leaned down. Then, all of a sudden, his lips were on mine! I stiffened from shock, he pulled away, and laughed at me. \"Billy, what was that for?\" \"Wouldn't you like to know?\" \"Yes, and I would appreciate it if you told me,\" I answered as he moved away from me, a smirk playing on his face. \"I'm not going to,\" he said, walking away from me and heading towards the house. \"Billy,\" I called after him and following him. \"Yeah?\" He said, turning back towards me. \"You're an ass.\" Sooo...how was it? Please comment tell me how it was and I'm sorry if you don't like it...[Chapter 6] Chapter Six Henry Hill Okay, so here is chapter six and I'm sorry if it sucks :(. It's not one of the best chapters in the world. \"You know, waiting by the window won't make them come back any sooner,\" Alex said. \"I know, but you never know when they might,\" I replied. I waiting for the slightest sign that one of them will come by and tell us how the first arrest went and how they're all safe. \"Alex, maybe you could take her into town and pick up a paper to see if there is anything about the boys in it,\" Susan suggested. \"It might take her mind off of them for awhile.\" \"Please, Alex,\" I begged him. \"Let me get the wagon ready,\" he answered, walking out of the house. \"Thank you, Susan,\" I said, walking over to her. \"I'm just glad you're wearing dresses now.\" \"Well, I can't exactly work on Uncle's land anymore,\" I answered. \"Faith, come on,\" Alex yelled. \"Bye Susan,\" and I walked out the door. He helped me into the wagon and we set off towards town. The ride was quiet, but in a peaceful way, and it doesn't take long to get there from the McSween's household. Alex pulled up next to a store, got out of the wagon, and helped me out. \"Alex, I'm going to walk around town,\" and he just nodded his head. I was glad to be away from him and Susan because it's as if they think I'm going to breakdown at anytime, but I'm not. I headed towards my uncle's shop and saw Doc's china doll that he danced with at the New Year's Eve party with Doc following her. \"Doc?\" \"Oh, hey Faith,\" and he caught up with her, offering her flowers. I stared at them as the continued to walk down the street. I started walking down towards the shop, wondering where the others were since Doc was in town. \"Faith, over here!\" I heard a voice say. I looked over and saw Billy standing behind the fence. \"Billy!\" I exclaimed and walked over towards him. He pulled me over to the other side of the fence and I saw the others. \"Faith, what're you doin' here?\" Steve asked with his mouth full of tobacco. \"Well, considering that I live outside of Lincoln now, I came here with Alex.\" \"It's nice to see you wearing dresses now,\" Dick commented. \"Thank you,\" I replied. \"Charley, what's the matter?\" \"Ah, it's El Chivato's fault,\" Chavez said. \"What in the world does 'El Chivato' mean, Chavez?\" I asked him. \"The kid.\" \"Who are you calling that and why?\" \"You mean you haven't seen the paper?\" Dick asked and I shook my head no. \"Well, the idiot over here,\" and he pointed over at Billy, \" killed Henry Hill.\" \"Why would you do that?\" \"He was part of the gang that killed John, your uncle.\" \"But you were only suppose to arrest him, not kill him.\" \"Faith, follow me,\" he said, walking away from the others and I followed him. \" I know you want revenge on the ones that killed John.\" \"Yes, but—\" \"And that means we have to kill them because they killed John!\" \"No, you don't have to kill them! If you continue to kill them, then you're just getting in bigger trouble with the law!\" I exclaimed. \"You don't understand it, Charlotte Rebecca,\" Billy said, looking disappointed at me. \"I don't understand why you're going to continue to kill the people who killed my uncle? Oh, I understand perfectly, William, but perhaps it is you who doesn't understand the concept and consequences of killing them,\" I replied, coolly, walking away from him. \"Faith,\" he said, walking after me. I walked to the other side of the fence and started towards Alex's wagon, when Billy grabbed my arm. \"William, let go of—\" and I couldn't finish because his lips were on mine. \"Billy, Faith, um,\" Doc said, surprised to us like that. \"Oh, hello Doc,\" I said, after Billy broke the kiss. \"Since when are you two like that ?\" \"Since when do you chase after China Dolls?\" I asked him. \"Oh, so that's where you went,\" Billy said, laughing a bit. \"Don't say a word to Richard.\" \"Faith!\" I heard Alex call. \"Well, I have to go,\" I said, moving away from them. \"See you soon, Faith,\" Billy said, giving me a last kiss and walking away with his famous laugh. \"Doc, please make sure he doesn't kill anymore people.\" \"I can try, but I'm not promising anything,\" he replied. \"I guess that's good enough,\" I sighed. \"Bye, Faith.\" \"Oh, Doc, one more thing.\" \"What is it?\" \"Please be safe, along with the others,\" I begged him. \"I'll do my best,\" he said, smiling a little. \"Bye, Doc,\" and he walked back towards the others. I walked back to Alex and he stood there with a man. \"Faith, you remember John Roberts, right?\" \"Oh, you're the man from the party,\" I said. \"Yeah, I'm glad you remember,\" he replied. \"He was wondering if he could stop by some time,\" Alex said, looking at me. \"That's fine,\" I said, reluctantly. I couldn't say no with him being here because it would be rude and second of all it would disappoint Alex and Susan. \"Good, well. I'll see you some other time then,\" he said, walking away without saying goodbye. \"Are you ready to go home?\" \"I suppose so,\" I answered, not saying that his house wasn't my real home.[Chapter 7] Chapter Seven – History Lesson Alrighty, so here is chapter seven! Chapter Seven Today was the day; today was the day that John Roberts was coming over. It was late in the afternoon and lunch had passed. The sky was still blue and the sun was slowly getting closer to the west. I was sitting in the front room with Susan and Alex. Susan was knitting and Alex was reading the newspaper. Every now and then Susan would look up at me and give me a little smile. I was, of course, wearing a dress, though it was a pretty one; It was sage green and fitted nicely. The sound of a horse galloping approached the house and someone commanding the horse to slow down. I looked out the window and saw John there. I quickly turned back around before he could see that I was looking at him. A knock sounded at the door and Alex put his newspaper down. He got up and went towards the door and opened it. \"Hello, Mr. McSween,\" John said at the doorway. \"Hello, John. Come on in,\" Alex said, welcoming him in. John came into the room and he was wearing a beige pants and a nice red shirt. He had brown-blonde hair and green eyes. \"Good afternoon, Mrs. McSween,\" he said, nodding his head towards her. \"Good afternoon, Charlotte Rebecca.\" \"Good afternoon, John,\" I said, placing a smile upon my face. \"John, take a seat,\" Alex said, motioning towards a chair and Alex picked up his newspaper. \"I'm going to work on some papers. Susan, will you watch them?\" \"I need to get supper ready, but I think they can watch over themselves,\" Susan replied, getting up herself. Alex sighed and went towards the room adjacent to the front room and Susan went into the kitchen. John sat down and cleared his throat. \"How are you, John,\" I asked him. \"I'm good, how are you?\" \"I'm fine,\" I answered. \"That's good,\" he looked around nervously. The room had gotten only a shade darker from the clouds covering the sun. \"Did you hear about the killings of Morton, Baker, and McCloskey?\" \"Yes, I did,\" I replied, remembering when Alex read aloud the newspaper article last night. \"I can't believe that you know the people who are going around and killing all of the men associated with Murphy,\" John said in awe. \"Where are you from, John?\" I asked him, changing the subject before I could say something that I would regret. \"My family is from Massachusetts,\" he answered, running a hand through his hair. \"What about you, Charlotte Rebecca?\" \"Hackney, London, England and please call me Faith,\" I replied. \"Why the name Faith?\" \"It's the nickname my mother called me.\" \"Why?\" He persisted. \"It's a very long story,\" I sighed, glancing out the window. \"I've got time,\" he smirked, his green eyes daring me not to tell him. \"My father moved my mother, brother, and I to Victoria, British Columbia, Canada when my uncle John was around thirty and my father were about twenty-five. My grandfather was a partner of a store where Uncle John worked at while my father tried to do well on the farm he created,\" I started to tell my life story so far. I could still remember what happened. \"My father moved us to Canada when I nine and my brother, James, was eleven. I didn't like the move, in fact I hated it. I had leave Grandfather and Grandmother Foster, my mother's parents, back in England. The only reason we came to Canada was because my father wanted to follow his brother and father. Grandfather Tunstall and Uncle John lived in town while we lived outside of it. We quickly befriended our neighbors, the Adams, and they were quite nice. Mr. and Mrs. Adams didn't have any children and they had hired help around their farm. Mr. Adams helped Father get started and Mrs. Adams helped Mother set up the house. James would help our father and I was expected to stay inside and help Mother. One day, Father had gotten sick and I knew James couldn't do all the work by himself. So, instead of letting James get Mr. Adams, I decided to help. I woke up early in the morning and looked for some of James' old clothes I slipped on some old trousers, a shirt, and looked for James. I found him in the barn and I told him I wanted to help.\" \" James, I want to help you,\" I said, walking up to my big brother. He had dark brown hair and our father's laughing brown eyes. The barn was still dark and the only light came from the lantern James had placed on the table. \" And what can you do, little Lottie?\" He asked, turning around with a grin on his face. His grin turned to surprise when he saw I was in men clothing. \"Why aren't you wearing your dress?\" \" I can't do much if I'm wearing a dress,\" I retorted \" You aren't going to do anything,\" James said, rolling his eyes. \" Please, James,\" I begged, giving the look that no one can resist. I could tell James didn't want to say yes, but he nodded his head. \" Fine, but don't blame me if you get in trouble,\" he sighed and I grinned. \"I did get in trouble with my mother for wearing men clothing, but my father was happy that the chores had gotten done and I was allowed to help on the farm for a little bit each day after that. The farm and crops flourished, but nothing good can stay. When I was eleven and James was thirteen, there was an accident. One of our horses saw a snake and was spooked. James tried to calm her down, but the horse bucked and hit him in the head. James suffered from the injury to his head and every day we prayed and prayed. On the third day, he died,\" and my voice cracked when I said that. \"James was my best friend and he was big brother. They held the funeral the day after and it was a very sad day. The farm began worsen, my mother lost hope, my father didn't take of it, and he wouldn't let me. We weren't going to be ready for winter if that kept up, so I decided to do something. I woke up early one morning and dug through my wardrobe for some old clothing to wear. I found trousers and shirts that belonged to James that he gave me. I put them on and grabbed my shoes. I quietly slipped outside and sat on the porch to put on my shoes. I went to the barn and began to set up the horses. The sun was bright that day and it was warm. I worked hard that morning and my father came outside to find me because I wasn't in the house. Father was beginning to smile when he saw me attempting to work the plow. My mother, for once, was glad to see me in my working clothes. \"My mother had hope again and began to call me Faith because she knew a girl once named Hope and they didn't exactly get along that well,\" I said, finally finished with how I got my nickname. \"What happened to your parents?\" John asked. He leaned forward on his knees, intrigued with my story. \"My mother died of consumption and my father was shot in a bar fight as he and Mr. Adams tried to settle it,' I explained, my throat tightening at the thought of the memory. \"Is that when you moved down here and like to wear men's clothing?\" And I nodded my head. \"What did your uncle say about the clothing?\" \"He wasn't happy about it at first or the fact that I wanted to help on farm, but he began to understand after a while.\" \"So, how did John meet the hired hands?\" \"When he found someone who was a hard case, he took them in because he believed that everyone deserves a chance.\" \"I heard that the last one he took in killed someone before he took him in,\" John said, almost in a whisper. \"He did,\" I replied, confirming it. \"But it doesn't make sense that even though he killed someone that he would still take him in. And what about the others?\" \"What do you mean 'And what about the others'?\" I asked him, not liking where this conversation was going. \"Well, I mean, they all did something that would make people look down upon them.\" \"That's why my uncle gave them a second chance.\" \"And that's probably why he got shot!\" John exclaimed. \"No, it isn't,\" I hissed at him. \"It's because Mr. Murphy can't handle a little competition or learn to share the business.\" \"Murphy is a great man!\" John defended him. \"If you think he is such a great man, then why don't you go talk to him?\" I retorted to him, seething. \"Maybe I will!\" John said, getting up from the chair. \"No one's stopping you,\" I said, not getting up. John walked towards the door and slammed it closed. A moment later he got on his horse left and I sighed in relief that he is finally gone. \"I heard what he said,\" Susan said, popping her head out of the kitchen. I smiled at her. \"Do you need help with supper?\" Supper ended and we talked about the conversation with John Roberts. Alex and Susan knew about what happened with my family because my uncle told them after I arrived. It was now night time and the only light that came into my room was the one from my candle and the faint light from the moon. My room was medium sized and not much in it. I had a bedside table with the candle on it and a washstand for in the mornings. I had plain red-pink curtains in front of my window with the window open because of the hot nights. There was a trunk in front of my bed with my things from Uncle John's house. Alex and Susan were already asleep and I got into my nightgown. I got into my bed and under covers. I leaned over and blew out the candle. I tried to get comfortable in the bed and closed my eyes. Today was a very tiring day and I was ready for it to be over with. A sheet of quietness and peace filled the house and it was very soothing. Though, it didn't last long because I heard a noise close to my bed. I opened my eyes and saw a figure standing next to the bed, holding their leg. My eyes widened and I sat up in bed. I almost screamed when the person dived towards me and placed their hand over my mouth. My scream became muffled and I thrashed around. The person pulled me to their chest and leaned towards my ear. \"Faith, it's me Billy!\" He hissed in my ear. I stopped moving and tried to turn around. He removed his arms from me and I got up to light the candle. When it was lit, I faced him and there he was, sitting on my bed. I walked to get something to cover me up and went towards. He grinned at me and I slapped him. \"What the hell was that for?\" \"That was for scary me half to death,\" I glared at him. I was in no mood for him. \"What are you doing here?\" \"I came to see you,\" he answered simply. \"Why?\" I questioned. \"Can't I come to see you?\" \"We barely know each other.\" \"We can learn more about each other.\" \"How?\" \"By asking each other questions.\" \"Okay, but why are you really here?\" I asked him and I saw him sigh. \"We got into a gun fight with Buckshot Roberts and Dick was killed,\" he answered, looking down. Dick was killed? I couldn't believe it. I sat down at the edge of my bed and covered my mouth with my hand. He was like my brother. He protected me like James did and he gave me advice when I needed it. I felt tears in my eyes and when I blinked they fell. They continued to fall as the news sank in. Soon my shoulders were shaking from the sobs and I felt the bed shift. Billy pulled me into his arms and I wrapped my arms around his neck. \"He...was...like...my...brother,\" I said in between sobs. Billy rubbed my back and tried to be soothing. \"He tried to kill him, but Roberts got him first. We wound up killing him in the outhouse,\" Billy said, seeing if that would calm me down, but I just cried harder. \"Shit, Faith, I'm not good with crying women.\" \"No guy is!\" I almost wailed. \"Why did you let Dick die? Why didn't you try to kill him?\" \"I did try!\" \"You should've tried harder!\" I said, pulling away from him. I got out of his grasp and pulled my shawl closer around me. \"I know,\" he said, putting his head down. \"He took my brother's place in protecting me.' \"You have a brother?\" Billy's face shot up and his bright blue eyes were questioning. \"John Roberts knows more about me than you do,\" I scoffed at him. \"That's why I want you to come with me.\" \"What do you mean?\" I asked him. \"I want you to come with me back to the boys and you can ride with us.\" \"Why would I do that?\" And Billy looked at me like I was an idiot. \"Because you'll be safer with us than here,\" He said like it was the simplest thing in the world. \"Says who?\" \"Me,\" and with that he got up and went towards my wardrobe. He threw a pair of trousers and a shirt at me. \"Put those on.\" \"No,\" I said, I'm not going with him. \"Either you put those on, or I'll put them on you myself.\" \"You can't talk to me like that!\" \"I rode all this way to get you and I'm not leaving you here!\" Billy said, walking towards the window. \"If you're not out here in five minutes, I'm coming back inside,\" and with that he went outside the window. I stared at the window, no has ever talked to me like that before. I closed the window and the curtains, making sure that Billy wasn't going to look in. I grabbed the trousers and shirt and began to get dressed because he sure wasn't going to dress me, ever. When I was done, I grabbed comb and change of undergarments. I opened the window and leaned out of it. \"Billy, I need your saddle bag.\" He looked over at me and went to his horse. He handed me the bag and I placed my things inside underneath his things. I handed it back to him and I walked over to the candle and blew it out. I made my way back to the window and Billy helped me out. \"I can't believe I'm doing this,\" I muttered as he helped me onto his horse. \"I don't even know why either.\" \"It's because you love me,\" Billy answered cheekily as he got onto the horse. \"No, I don't think it's that,\" and we rode off. This story has been going downhill and a very useful reviewer helped me realize it. The reviewer is Brian The Dog and it's the most helpful review I have ever gotten. If you haven't read it, then you should. It opened my eyes that I haven't been really doing a good job with this story and I'm sorry for it. :( But, I'm going to do good for now on! Please, please, please let me know what you really think about this chapter and if I should redo the others. And thank you soooo much Brian The Dog !

It was editing October 10, 2016 as was every chapter up until 5. The ballroom was bustling with staff members preparing for the event that started in less than three hours. Alfred was taking care of things in the kitchen, ensuring that the wait staff knew what was in each appetizer, and what time to bring out specific dishes that were coming in from the newest caterer. Glancing back, Alfred saw the containers coming in with food, with warming trays ready and a freezer constantly being opened. Although the wait staff and Alfred offered many times, Camilla Marino was insistent that she was fully capable to carry things in with her young assistant- her daughter Julietta. Camilla had been recommended by Bruce Wayne's friend Zanobi Esposito plenty of times as they were working out a business arrangement. Zanobi even went to the point that he brought in some semifreddos from the bakery that Miss Marino worked at. Bruce enjoyed the passion that Zanobi had for this, even to the point where he claimed that these were the best semifreddos that you could get in the States. What Zanobi hadn't told Alfred or Bruce was that Camilla had been new to the business of catering. She was doing it as a side business while also working in an Italian coffee shop to support herself and daughter. Camilla's daughter, Julietta, was carrying in some containers before setting them down and smiling at Alfred. If the Butler would have to guess, this girl was around the same age as Master Jason. Dismissing the wait staff to go relax until the banquet were to begin, Alfred went to fetch refreshments for the two. He was sure that they must be thirsty from carrying enough food to appease over 200 people with appetizers and desserts. Alfred called over Camilla and Julietta as he held out the two glasses for them. \"I must insist that you two take a break to at least drink some. After all, you are in for quite a long night.\" Alfred reason as Camilla gave him a genuine smile. \"Thank you Alfred.\" She said as Camilla handed her daughter one of the glasses. Having both of them beside one another it was clear to see that they were related. Both with light brown-almost considered blonde hair in loose curls with tanned skin. The most noticeable differences was Camilla had deep brown eyes with a mole beside her left eye, whereas Julietta had hazel eyes and was splattered in freckles. Glancing down, Camilla gave her daughter a look before the young one smiled up at Alred. \"Thank you Mister Pennyworth.\" Julietta said before finishing it and turned to run and grab more things from the van through the kitchen door. Not paying attention to her surrounding area Julietta crashed into a pair of legs. Falling to the ground, Julietta let out an oof and looked up to see what she collided with. It was two men, a large man with thick dark hair and a neatly trimmed beard next to a man who looked as if he should be on the cover of a fitness magazine, which you could tell even in his well-tailored suit. The first man helped Julietta up as she rushed out an apology. \"I'm so sorry!\" Taking a step back, Julietta dusted off her pants. \"Bambino, it's okay.\" The man said as he let out a small laugh and patted her head. \"Mi dispiace molto Signore Esposito.\" Camilla rambled out as she pulled Julietta to rest against her. Camilla's face was flustered. \"She didn't look where she was going.\" Julietta, on the other hand, wasn't sure why they were still talking about this since she apologized. \"Camilla, there's nothing to worry about. Jason constantly runs into things since he'll get so focused on his path and not pay attention to anything else.\" Bruce offered as he glanced between the relaxing Camilla and his friend Zanobi. Smiling, he ushered for Julietta to follow him as the other two were left to speak in Italian with one another. Bruce smiled at her as he helped Julietta grab the last few boxes talking with Julietta as if he had known her for quite some time rather than just the child of someone he had hired before going to speak with Alfred. - The gala was well underway, as Julietta watched her mama coming in and out of the kitchen constantly to ensure that everything was in order and trays were being refilled properly. Julietta was in admiration of her mother for doing all this yet still looking beautiful with a twisted ponytail, dangling silver earrings in a black dress, red heels and beautiful smokey make up. Julietta rarely saw her mom wear make-up or care about her attire much until Mr. Esposito entered the coffee shop a few months previously. Zanobi even made the point to come in and chat with Camilla occasionally in the kitchen with a soft touch on the elbow or back. Wiggling in her chair at the table, Julietta puffed out her cheeks. With her homework done and more interest in the drama going on with her mother's life than going out to socialize with the older guests at the party or find something else to distract herself at the table. The door opened again, this time a bit longer than usual as Julietta looked over to see someone her age. The boy was dressed up in a well fitted suit with his dark hair combed back and bright eyes scanning the area as if this was some sort of mission. His eyes landed on a plate of zeppole as he licked his lips and walked over towards it. Moving out of the chair, Julietta tip toed behind this boy. \"So, you enjoy deep fried filled pastries?\" Julietta questioned as she cupped her hands behind her back as the boy jumped a little bit. \"Oh yeah.\" The boy said before laughing and rubbing the back of his head before turning to look at Julietta. \"Everyone else keeps taking them before I get a chance.\" The boy angrily huffed as Julietta moved her hand to cover her giggles. \"Well, I may be able to see if mama can leave the leftover for you.\" She offered as he beam with delight. \"Or you could ask Signore Esposito for the address to the coffee shop. \"Please! That would be great.\" He exclaimed before grabbing a handful and popping one in his mouth. \"I'm Julietta by the way.\" She offered to go offer her hand but realized his were occupied. \"I'm Jason Todd.\" He said with his mouth full of pastries. The dark haired boy was grinning ear to ear. Julietta had to figure that he had quite the sweet tooth. Jason continued to stay and followed Julietta to sit at the table. Raising an eyebrow, she leaned forward to look at her new friend. \"Won't your parents be upset at you for hiding in here rather than being out socializing with Gotham's elite?\" Her brain went through what she had learned in school about the original families of Gotham and from the tabloids trying to figure out who Jason's parents were. \"Nope.\" Jason popped out as he leaned in a bit. \"My guardian is way too busy with everyone flocking me to worry about where I am at these boring events.\" Jason said with a whine before pointing to the food over there. \"At least the food is always great.\" He added as the kitchen door opened again with Camilla and Zanobi walking in again. They hadn't noticed the kids so Julietta leaned over and grabbed Jason's hand dragging him to hide behind the large fridge and empty containers. Jason turned Julietta to look at him with a confused expression as she grinned and whispered. \"Signore Esposito has been visiting mama all the time at the coffee shop, and even helped her get this contract with Bruce Wayne.\" Turning, Julietta leaned over to peek her eyes around the fridge as Jason leaned against her to see too. Quietly, she added. \"Mama hasn't dated since she split with papa and I think they'd be great together. He makes her laugh.\" Jason was grinning as he watched the two adults interact before leaning even closer to whisper. \"Well, if it helps, Zanobi always brags about her to Bruce and Alfred for her cooking, to intelligence and even her ability to speak Italian. Julietta smiled ear to ear as they continued watching until a cough pulled them away from watching. Glancing back, the two kids saw Bruce standing behind the pair. \"Is snooping something you two should be doing?\" Both looked at one another as they gave Bruce an awkward smile. They both thought of the same word. \"Busted.\" Julietta reacted first as she looked up to Bruce. \"Sorry Mister Wayne, I wanted to spy and dragged Jason to join me. Please don't tell his guardians.\" She asked while clasping her hands together. \"We weren't causing any harm.\" Jason looked at Julietta with a raised eyebrow before chuckling and whispering. \"Bruce is my guardian.\" - \"Bruce we could still go onto Patrol today afterwards.\" The now fourteen year old Jason whined as he adjusted his tie once more. It had been nearly five years since he met Julietta and Camilla. Sighing, Bruce put a hand on Jason's shoulder and crouched a bit to look him in the eye. \"Jason, we aren't going to rush through the wedding just to go on patrol. We deserve a night off once in a while. We had a busy month, take the time to relax.\" Bruce recommended as his young ward nodded slowly. Pausing, Jason weighed the pros and cons before nodding slowly and walking with Bruce to the car. Bruce was concerned for his ward since Jason was getting more aggressive during the missions and eager to take on missions. This was the closest event that Bruce knew would help Jason unwind. The car ride was long when they arrived to the church. It was a large stone church with beautiful stained glass, that made the inside of the church bask with a magical glow. Reporters were outside along the rode waiting to catch a photo of this Cinderella story. After all, it wasn't every day that a millionaire known for his wineries and other investments was marrying an Italian immigrant who had been working in a coffee shop previously. Jason and Bruce met Bruce's date for the wedding at the entrance where Julietta greeted them. She smiled at the trio, making sure to introduce herself to Bruce's date before hugging Jason. Seeing the young teens close to one another, it was clear to see how much they had grown in the past few years with Jason starting to grow taller than his friend. Jason let the hug linger as a small flush was on his face. Bruce grinned as he diverted his focus elsewhere. Every day, Julietta was blooming into a kind and beautiful young woman that look greatly like her own mother. Finally the hug separated as Julietta looked over to Bruce. \"I'm so glad you could make it today, mama is so nervous but everything seems to be running smoothly.\" Grinning, she glanced backwards towards the inside of the church. \"But this is all thanks you Mr. Wayne, after all Mr. Esposito asked mama out at the event.\" Wistfully sighing, Julietta snuck a glance at Jason- who was oblivious before waving for them to follow her. They were all sitting in the front row with Julietta since they were basically family. Julietta and Jason immediately sat with one another as Julietta pulled out a phone from some mysterious pocket in her dress and leaned to converse more privately with Jason. His hand rested on the pew behind her back. \"So, you remember that blogger I told you about? They believe Two Face was the one responsible for the bridge being taken out last night.\" Julietta began as she scrolled down on the phone screen. \"They think it was to take out the competitor's main travel route for shipments of drugs coming into Gotham and take them for themselves.\" Jason smiled at her as he leaned forward to look at the screen. He couldn't help but be amused that she was always reading up about the criminals of Gotham. Julietta would message him at all hours of the day, even risking it during class about her theories regarding anything relating to Batman and Robin. Jason was amused by hearing Julietta ramble about the Dynamic Duo. Pointing to a photo, Julietta glanced up before down again. The photo showed some of Two Face's goons holding guns and putting crates into their own vehicle with labels that this blogger said meant various drugs in coded numbers. \"Now you notice that Batman and Robin were nowhere around here. I think that Two Face purposely diverted Batman and Robin's attention to do this. After all, if he got rid of the competition, he could create a larger empire and monopolize the market, charging double at least for the portions he's already selling in the streets.\" Jason took some time to think before shrugging. \"That's pretty genius of Two Face.\" Jason was trying not to think about the latest case when he was unable to work on it. \"So, does Camilla know that once again you're investigating them?\" Jason questioned. Julietta shook her head while putting her phone away. \"She would be so upset if I did, even if she heard that I was looking into criminals.\" Puffing her cheeks a bit, she leaned back with her bare shoulder blade touching Jason's hand. \"If she asks, I'm just excited about high school and the wedding, got it?\" Julietta added with a serious look before holding out her pinkie to him. She waited for Jason to wrap his pinkie around hers before flashing him a smile. \"Just think, we'll be in school together this time and you can torment me in person.\" Jason feigned being upset as he placed a hand on his chest. \"Torment? That seems like a harsh word to use for your best friend. I prefer 'keep you company.'\" Chuckling, Jason could hear the music begin before tapping his fingers against her shoulder. \"Anyways, it's time.\" - The wedding and dinner following had gone beautifully. The dancefloor was now full of their guests dancing to the upbeat music while chatting and enjoying alcoholic beverages. Camilla and Zanobi were sitting down after doing the first dance and Daddy/Daughter dance. Julietta swayed through the crowd before taking a seat in the reception beside Jason. She rested her head on her hand before tilting her head. \"You have to be bored just sitting here.\" Julietta remarked as Jason shrugged. If he was honest, he would much rather be throwing punches while on patrol. Jason shook his head. \"Nah, I'm just a bit warm.\" He replied nonchalantly as he noticed the concern on his friend's face. He knew that Julietta would react soon if Jason didn't stop her. \"But it's fine tho-\" he began but Julietta had already began to drag Jason through the crowd towards the glass doors. Julietta pushed them open and he felt much better the moment the cool breeze hit his skin. Moving her hand now, Julietta intertwined their fingers to get him to follow her until they reached a fountain. Sitting on the edge of the fountain, Julietta glanced to his hand before hesitantly letting his go. Jason missed having her pleasantly warm hand in his but shook it off and stood nearby. \"Better Jason?\" Julietta questioned while tilting her head. Moving to sit beside her, Jason distracted his hand by playing with water. \"Much better, I enjoy being away from all those people.\" There was a comfortable silence, as Julietta glanced around and bit her lip. \"So…\" Julietta hesitantly began before looking towards him. \"What's it really like being brought into all this.\" She questioned waving with one hand to gesture to the large property of the custom mansion. It had its own garden that was practically a maze. \"These people have had a cucchiaio d'Argento in their mouths their whole life! Before today, I just had to see them when my step papa hosted events and insisted I come.\" Sighing heavily, Julietta leaned her head against Jason's shoulder. \"I still remember only having hand me downs and struggling to make it to the next pay day for food.\" Jason let the silence take hold for a moment before he began to speak. \"Honestly… it's going to be hard Jules, these people have their own code of ethics.\" Jason's arm wrapped around Julietta's shoulder as the other one continued to play with the water in the fountain. \"But just know, I've been here for you since we met and I will always be there to help.\" Chuckling, he glanced down to look into Julietta's hazel eyes. \"Besides, if any of them give you trouble, you can always just clock them.\" Laughing against Jason, she rested a hand on his thigh and stared forward. \"I think mama would throw a fit if I got in trouble,\" grinning she added. \"but she'd be more upset if I didn't finish the fight.\" Jason smirked with the one side curled up a bit more as he pulled his hand out of the water to flick it in Julietta's face. Gasping in shock, Julietta pulled away with a look of betrayal, before the challenge set in as she flicked water towards Jason. Flicks soon became splashes as they both became drenched in water when Julietta tried pushing Jason in only to be dragged in herself. Getting out of the water, Julietta bursted into laughter and dropped to lay on the grass. Jason fell beside her while his eyes watched her cheerful face. Julietta stopped laughing to look back at him. He wasn't sure how long they stared at each other, or that they were staring until a drop of moisture landing on his nose brought his focus back. Looking up, Jason saw the stormy sky as he jumped up and held his hand out for her. Jason waited until she wrapped her hands around his before he pulled her onto his own two feet. They walked slowly back until the rain began to pour heavily down as they ran inside. Inside there was many couples slow dancing to a romantic song that was heavy with the piano. In the center was Camilla and Zanobi leading the dance. Walking behind the crowd, Julietta led Jason until they found a spot to watch. Their intertwined hands fell to her side as her grip loosened. Jason could see Julietta watching her mama dance with her new step papa. Jason could see the soft and whimsical look in her eyes. Jason could tell that Julietta was thinking about how it must be dancing. Taking a chance, Jason placed his hand on the small of her back. \"Follow my lead.\" He whispered to her as Jason led her to the edge of the dance floor. His hand moved to intertwine with his as Jason pulled her close with his other hand on her lower back. Julietta placed her hand on his shoulder as she smiled up at him. Julietta let Jason instruct her for a bit until they fell into a familiar rhythm. Jason felt Julietta rest her head on his shoulder, as his breath hitched for a moment hearing a whispered. \"Is this something you were taught in school?\" \"Yes, but you've been the best partner.\" Jason responded with his head gently resting against hers. His eyes scanned the dance floor to see Bruce dancing with his date as the bride and groom walking to watch the rain. Julietta had told Jason that it was good luck for the wedding if it rain apparently. Jason hoped this new family got all the happiness, and that the evening could last forever.[Chapter 2] More background! Yay :D This was updated on October 10, 2016 \"Come on down you two!\" Camilla shouted out of the back door towards the large treehouse in the backyard before going back into the house. Since Zanobi and Bruce were busy as of late with work at Wayne Enterprise, Camilla insisted in feeding Jason. Julietta and Jason had been in the tree house since school had finished to do their readings but Jason had hastily fell asleep. Julietta glanced to him, as she felt bad for disturbing the tired teen. He was constantly tired nowadays, as if he hadn't slept a full night in months and Jason was also quite grumpy when he was woken up before he wanted to be up. Glancing back to the house, she knew that her mama would only be patient for so long. Leaning over, Julietta began to shake his shoulder. \"Hey, Jason come on.\" Julietta told him as a large hand wrapped around her wrist, tight enough to hold it firmly but not bruise. Sleepy eyes opened, as he looked directly at her. \"What Jules?\" He groaned out in a sleepy mumble, still holding her wrist. Patting his cheek, with her free hand Julietta told him. \"It's dinner time, Mr. Snores-A-Lot.\" She remarked as Jason raised an eyebrow before sitting up- still holding onto her wrist. \"I do not snore.\" He bickered as he stared Julietta, trying to see if she was kidding. \"Yeah, you kind of do.\" Julietta retorted with a grin. \"It soft at first and almost cute, but then you began sounding like a chainsa-AH!\" she squealed out as both of her sides felt the assault of tickles. Julietta could feel the hands sliding up to tickle her waist- the most ticklish part she found out was there and Jason knew that. Her hands pushed at Jason as she squirmed under his touch. \"E-enough, please!\" Julietta choked out between the fits of laughter as Jason stopped to look to look at her. Another call for the teens was heard, with Italian being added to it as Jason helped Julietta to stand and head down the ladder for dinner. In the dining room was a variety of foods that Camilla made waiting for them. Julietta pointed to the tiny name cards in front of each dish, a clear sign that her mama was testing new recipes for catering. The two sat across from one another, with Camilla's spot beside them at the end of the table and looked down at the soup already poured. According to the name card, it was a Cannellini and Pancetta soup with Spinach Risotto on standby. Jason didn't even hesitate before he began to eat. In the last few months, the boy had shot up in height to be well into the six feet range and gained a lot more muscle to his previously lanky frame. With this, Jason seemed to be eating constantly and exercising in a lot of his free time unless Jules dragged him away. Camilla noticed this too as she tilted her head to Jason, and looked at Julietta while asking \"Egli può anche gusto che?\" Julietta giggled at the question of whether Jason was even tasting the food. \"Sì mama.\" Julietta responded, glancing over to see Jason slowing down on his eating and looking between the two women he was currently with. Obviously, Jason had no idea what they were saying but was curious. Camilla excused herself when the phone rang as Jason leaned forward. \"What was your mom asking?\" Jason inquired with a loud whisper. Setting down the spoon, Julietta put on a serious expression and intertwined her own hands on her lap. \"I'm afraid, you are not at liberty to know.\" Julietta remarked as a grin covered her face before she went back to finishing her soup. \"But she did ask a question, if that makes you feel better.\" She saw his eye twitch in annoyance and lips start moving to speak only for him to stop when Camilla walked back in. Although, he continued eating the food, Julietta saw the look in his eyes that he was planning on asking Julietta about it later or learning Italian himself. Jason's fingers drummed on his desk, as he stared at the chalkboard ahead of him, clearly bored of the subject. It was his last class of the week. Choosing to distract his mind for the last few minutes, he looked around the room as he saw Julietta diagonally in front of him. She was completely focused on what the teacher was saying with her focus only leaving when she needed to respond to the note that kept being passed to her from another female student. Moving onto others, he watched some students blatantly staring at their crushes- with a surprising amount being the teacher at the front of the room, a few constantly were looking to the wall clock with hope to get out of the classroom to start their weekend or even focusing like Julietta from the pressure to succeed. Jason was passing well enough, that he could get into university if he wanted to, but his heart was focused more on his current profession of vigilante justice. Returning his gaze to Julietta and the front of the classroom again, he saw her brow furrowed, with her hair now tucked behind her ear and she was biting her lower lip. Jason knew math was her weak point in school, and that this new equation was clearly causing her confusion. Jules told Jason that she wanted to get high grades so her mama and step papa were proud of her. The bell ringed loudly and as quickly as it started, the chairs began to be shoved. Jason packed his things slowly, waiting for the rest of the class to file out before he attempted to stand up. He wasn't foolish enough to put himself in that stress of the rush out but it seemed that Julietta was today. Walking behind the last heirs and heiresses, he saw her leaning against the wall talking to a couple kids- including the one Jason saw her passing notes with. Seeing Jason, Julietta smiled and turned to Jason, waving a farewell to the kids talking with her. Her cheeks seemed to be flushed from the conversation. When Jason stood beside her, he saw the stern look she gave him. \"What?\" he questioned as Jules rolled her eyes at him. \"You were so obviously not paying attention Jason.\" Julietta remarked with a bit of a whine. She was trying to be stern with him and it was clear that she was forcing the expression on her face. Jason shrugged before throwing an arm over her shoulder as he chuckled. \"Cut me some slack, Jules, its FRIDAY and the last class at that.\" He retorted as Julietta sighed in defeat and replaced her expression with a cheeky smile. \"I suppose that's true- but you are stuck with me, you sure you want to be excited?\" Julietta questioned as he grinned and nodded. \"'Course, it makes it even better. I don't have to attend the gala tonight all our classmates were talking about.\" Although he was a master at feigning enjoyment at events Jason would much rather be on patrol or even at the manor. Jason knew that Julietta enjoyed getting dressed up and seeing her parents showing how picture perfect they were but it was more stressful since people had begun to demand their time for socializing or dancing instead of ignoring the youth. Pulling away, Julietta looked at Jason with wide joyful eyes. \"You mean you actually enjoy my company?\" Putting a hand over her heart, she let out an exaggerated gasp. \"Jason Todd actually does like at least one other human.\" Laughing, Julietta shrugged off Jason's arm to open her locker. Yanking out her overnight bag that she had crammed into it this morning was the first step before she tossed the books she didn't need inside her locker. An arm went over her as she saw Jason putting his own books on the top shelf of Julietta's locker. Although he couldn't see her, Jason knew she was raising an eyebrow at him. \"What? My locker is on the other side of the building and Alfred's meeting us on this side. You don't want to be cruel and keep Alfred waiting, do you?\" Jason rationed as he picked up her bag and flashed her his charming smile that was camera ready. \"Or, you just want me to start baking those hazelnut and chocolate filled zeppole.\" Leaning down, Jason patted her cheek. \"You caught me.\" - Jason carried the large tray of snacks as Julietta flopped on the couch and let down her curly hair from the hair elastic. Jason set the snacks on the ottoman in front of the couch before putting on the first movie. Taking his seat, Jason stretched out and let his feet rest on the second ottoman as Julietta tucked her own feet under his thigh. The movie started as he saw Julietta immediately letting her mind overthink things in an attempt to discover the plot. Jason had a love for horror movies, and Julietta promised he could watch some this time with her even if she was scared easily from them. Typically, she spent most of any horror movie hiding her face against Jason. It was a guilty pleasure of Jason's, having her curl into him and cling like a life line. During the movie, Julietta shifted constantly so she could be comfortable and also reach the snacks. At some point her head came to rest on Jason's shoulder. Both were comfortable with one another since they had known each other for quite some time. During lunch periods, it was rather common to see Jason resting his head on her shoulder or lap as he took a nap. Jason glanced at her as he noticed that Julietta seemed to be interested in this movie as her hand moved to rest on his thigh before moving to cling onto the hand that was resting there. Pausing for only a moment, Jason then flipped his hand so Julietta's fingers could intertwine with his and give her a reassuring squeeze. The detective side of him could see that Julietta seemed nervous more than terrified since her eyes were darting around constantly. Shrugging it off as overanalysing his friend, Jason focused on the movie with only an occasional glance at her. His mind did keep coming back to the pleasant thought that they had hands intertwined. Julietta hid her face in his shoulder for the majority of the ending as she occasionally squeezed his hand whenever a scream was heard on screen. When the movie was over, Jason let go of Julietta's hand as he switched it to some comedy he heard was good before giving her a tight hug with his arm over her shoulder, and the other one wrapped around her front. Julietta's hands wrapped around his as he smiled against her hair. \"You could have asked me to stop the movie.\" He whispered into her fruity smelling hair. She shook her head before Jason pulled away from the hug, the arm on her shoulders staying though. Jason was sure that Julietta was distracted by something else as he decided to call it out. \"Hey… you okay?\" Jason asked cautiously as he loozed into her hazel eyes. Julietta nodded. \"Yeah, don't worry about it Jason.\" She offered as an answer as Julietta gave him a soft smile, looking at something on his face but Jason couldn't pinpoint where exactly. \"If you ever need to talk, let me know. Or to punch someone.\" He offered with a small laugh as she nodded to him. \"I'll always be around for you Jules, always.\" \"Thank you Jason.\" She mumbled, as Julietta continued to glance between his eyes and the lower part of his face. Jason felt like he should ask, as he opened his mouth slightly when he saw Jules lean forward and felt soft lips barely graze his own. Jason immediately noticed how soft and plump they were as his eyes widened from the thought of his best friend kissing him. It felt tlike things clicked into place for him as Jason shut his eyes and pressed his own lips against hers. Jason could feel Julietta's curl into a smile from the innocent kiss. Julietta pulled away as he slowly opened his eyes a bit. Jason's free hand went on Julietta's cheek as he pulled her close to him again, pressing his lips against her for a more demanding kiss. Both teens had a few other kisses, but this one felt the most natural. Jason let the arm on her shoulder drop to her waist as he felt hands playing with his dark hair and rubbing the scalp. Neither one had said anything, but both knew that this was a game changer in their friendship. The unspoken feelings had finally been unearthed and wouldn't be as easy to deny when they were requited. It wasn't something that came up for some time since when Bruce returned that night, after the gala and even doing a round of Gotham as Batman the two teens were curled up on the couch together with legs intertwined and Julietta laying on Jason's chest- hands resting on one another's body.[Chapter 3] This was updated on October 10, 2016 and is the first one that is in the movie timeline now. It was your standard night in Gotham, dark yet full of life with various buildings being alight in attempts to sell their goods to the people of Gotham. Some people felt a sense of safety from Batman and Nightwing roaming the streets. This included a young woman who walked out of the library and was speaking into her Bluetooth. An oversized leather jacket hung on her shoulders, sheltering her from the cool night air. \"No mama, I don't want someone to accompany me to papa's gala next month.\" She spoke absent mindedly twirling the curl that escaped her ponytail. \" Julietta, I haven't heard of you dating anyone since Jas-\" \"Mama, when I'm ready. I'll go out and tell you but for now I have larger concerns. Like schoo and Thomas.\" Julietta groaned before adding. \"How is everyone doing by the way?\" she inquired, a clear attempt to change the conversation. Her mama took the bait, and Julietta relaxed as she listened to her mother rambling on. Getting towards the apartment building she called home, Julietta let out a sigh of relief and rolled her shoulders. She let out the proper noises to make sure that her mother knew she was listening as she climbed up the many flights of stairs until she reached the top floor. Would it have been quicker to use the elevator? Yes. Is this what Julietta considered a regular exercise to walk up the twenty some flights of stairs? Yes. Panting slightly, Julietta typed a code into a panel before she unlocked the door. Interrupting her mama's ramble about the latest client. \"So, is Thomas okay? You didn't forget anything when you picked him up, did you?\" Jules questioned as she locked the door behind her, then began on the deadbolts before moving to the security system where she typed in a password and watched it turn green signifying it was active once more. \"No, no. Thomas is fine. He's with his Grandpapa right now.\" Camilla assured her daughter, as she turned around. Turning around, Julietta noticed a small potted plant now resting on the table. It was a round red mug with tiny blue flowers that were Julietta's favourite flowers- forget-me-nots. The tiny mug had the Robin symbol decorated on it. \"He mama, did you leave flowers on my coffee table?\" \"No? Your papa didn't either. Why? Was there some at your door?\" Camilla question, as she switched to Italian and began talking about maybe Julietta having some sort of secret admirer. \"You know, it was probably Bruce or Alfred- they like to keep in touch and do surprises like this. I'm going to let you go so I can call him, okay?\" Julietta hung up as she began to walk closer to the plant. She wasn't sure she had even called The Wayne Estate until the ringing in her Bluetooth drew her focus. Alfred answered punctually as she let out an anxious sigh. \"Hi Alfred, it's Jules.\" She sputtered out before her fingers dug into the jacket pocket, the small switchblade brushing against her fingers. \"Ah yes, Miss Marino. What can I help you with? Master Bruce is out for the evening.\" Alfred responded, as Julietta brushed her fingers tentatively against the petals. \"I was wondering if you or Bruce happened to have anything delivered to my apartment lately?\" Julietta questioned as she saw a tag tucked underneath it. Moving the cup carefully, she grabbed the tag. \"No, I am not aware of Master Wayne sending you anything. He typically would hand it over in person to you,\" Alfred responded as he heard a choked sob on the other line. \"Miss Marino?\" \"Th- thanks Alfred. I'll call you later.\" Julietta hung up as she tossed the Bluetooth onto the table, fingers going over the note as tears oured down. She bit back another sob. Guess who's back? J.T. was what had been written as she traced the letters, recognizing the familiar script. How could this be? It had been almost five years since Jason died and yet this was his work. Fishing her phone out, Julietta took a photo of it and sent it to Bruce's number- knowing that Alfred would get it. In the background was the plant and the text message contained only \"?\" Only a few people knew about her love for forget-me-nots. It had been a flower that Jason saw one day in the garden, and plucked a bunch to take for Julietta, leaving them in her locker just after they began to date. Alfred sent a response back to her on the cellphone, asking if it was sent to the wrong address. Julietta sent simply. No, it was INSIDE the apartment before shoving her cellphone in the pocket and pushed herself to search the apartment. Her fingers wrapped around the switchblade. Julietta started with her kitchen, opening all the cupboards and ensuring nothing was on that shouldn't be on. She then followed with the small closet and bathroom before going into her own room. The bed way messy, covered in some stuffed animals and clothing but nothing seemed out of place. She moved to the closet, opening it quickly and pushing the clothes around to make sure no one hiding. Going over to the bed, Julietta looked underneath and made sure that there was only the one box underneath. Moving to sit on the bed, she took the thought that maybe the pressure for school had finally gotten to Julietta before noticing the framed photo was missing from her bedside table. Glancing around the area, she spotted it on the bed under a sweater. Her fingers moved towards it slowly, as if it would catch aflame at any minute before wrapping her fingers around the frame and turning it around so she could see its front. She was met with the cardboard backing, but not the photo that once was inside of it. The photo of Jason and herself was now missing. She sat on the thought of it for some time before realizing that she had one more place to check, the spare room that anyone was hardly in yet since Thomas still had been sleeping in Julietta's bed and she had yet to order furniture for it. The door creaked slightly as it opened. The room was cold and the breeze swept around her. Other than a few tools, mainly paintbrushes, the room was empty. She flicked on the light and walked over to the open window. On it was a post it note that said \"See you soon.\" Julietta took a photo of the area before shutting the window. Her mind was racing as she left the room to sit in the living room. Burying her face in the large jacket, she closed her eyes and knew life was about to get complicated.[Chapter 4] Here is the updated version of chapter 4, done on October 10, 2016. After this, it'll be all new chapters :D It was no shock that she couldn't sleep, and so when the sun was rising, she changed into more appropriate clothing, and tossed on make up to make it at least look like her skin had some colour before hailing for a cab. It was a slow ride as Jules stared out the window waiting to arrive at the Wayne manor. When they arrived, Jules handed the cab driver more than enough before hurrying to get the door. Just as she was about to knock, the door swung open. Alfred was opening it but seemed just as shocked as Julietta to see the other. \"Miss Marino.\" He said as Julietta smiled softly. \"Morning Alfred, I need to speak with Bruce.\" She spoke softly, noticing Dick in crutches behind him. \"Hey Dick.\" She added as he grinned at her. \"Master Bruce is currently occupied,\" Alfred began. \"Could this possibly wait until later today?\" He looked at her with soft eyes, but there was clearly something hidden from her. She shook her head and gave Alfred a pouty look. \"I need to speak with him, I'll bother him for all of five minutes.\" Julietta pleaded as she stepped back to let the two men out. Alfred seemed to ponder before nodding. \"Alright, just go down quickly. Perhaps it would be good for Master Wayne to have a fresh face to talk to.\" Julietta nearly hugged the butler, before just flashing him a small smile. \"Thank you.\" Patting Dick on the shoulder, she slid inside quickly, and followed the instructions Jason had told her long before when he had been feeling pretty reckless and foolish. Better than the old abandoned building at least. When she walked down the stairs, Julietta saw Bruce staring at the Robin costume. The atmosphere in the cave just seemed to ooze sadness as Julietta wrapped the oversize jacket around herself more. Standing behind Bruce, Julietta stared at the glass case, a mix of emotions running through her. It had to have been a good five minutes before she find her voice again. \"Bruce?\" He turned to her slowly, clearly masking his emotions as he looked into her own misty eyes. \"Julietta, why are you here?\" Bruce questioned as she thrusted the box towards him. \"I- he,\" Julietta wheezed before squeezing her eyes shut and taking a deep breath. \"I came home last night to find these in my apartment.\" She said before opening the box to show the plant and note. Pointing to the frame, she added. \"Someone also took a photo of Jason and I.\" Bruce was examining both notes, as her focus went back to the costume. Remembering all the moments she got to see the costume up close. It used to be a beacon of positivity to Julietta. It was almost as if she could hear Jason's words as he used to tell her bad jokes or cheesy one liners when their paths crossed- which was semi regularly due to the villains loving the one percent of Gotham. \"The spare room also had the window wide open yet the security system said everything was fine.\" She added before forcing her eyes to look at something else in the room. \"Bruce, I just… why would someone be so cruel into making us think that Jason is back?\" Julietta whispered as her hand went to touch the glass gently. \"He died, you were there. Jason can't be back.\" Julietta could hear the beeping of her cellphone but chose to ignore it as she stared at Bruce's pensive face. \"And you did make sure your entire apartment was secure?\" Bruce asked as Julietta nodded while running a hand through her hair. \"Yeah, I did.\" Her phone began beeping again as she sighed. \"Bruce, I need to go, mama wants everyone to have a family breakfast and are probably waiting on me.\" Gesturing to the box now in his hands. \"If this can help you, check it out.\" Julietta turned to walk away as she heard Bruce call out. \"I'll come check the apartment later, I'll let you know if I find anything.\" Jules called for another cab so that by the time she walked through the gates, it had arrived. It was a much quicker ride as she arrived to the Esposito house, and already saw Camilla waiting at the doorway. Her mother was still quite recognizable but age was starting to show with the slight wrinkles- mostly laugh lines on her face and some grey hair peeking at the roots. Julietta walked up to her mother and felt the embrace, giving a small hug in return as she was ushered into the house. Julietta barely paid attention as her mother rambled about the newest recipes she baked for Zanobi and her business. It wasn't until they arrived the kitchen that her body seemed to wake up from auto-pilot. Zanobi was dishing crepes onto plates as his little helper carried a bowl of whipped cream, not so masterfully sneaking a spoonful of it when Zanobi was distracted by Camilla kissing his cheek. Julietta sent Thomas a one eyebrow look as he smiled at her. She walked over and scooped the young boy up as he set the whipped cream on the breakfast island. Thomas had some whipped cream on his nose, so she swiped her finger along his nose to wipe it off before wiping it on her pants. Zanobi had made four servings that were now on the table as he embrace the pair. \"My little bambino and tinier bambino.\" He exclaimed while patting both of their backs. Julietta set Thomas on a stool as Zanobi pressed his hand on a shoulder. \"Stay for breakfast! You are always so busy nowadays.\" Smiling at her, he took his hand off her shoulder. \"It'll be nice to see you outside of business occasions.\" Moving to take his own stool, Julietta found her own as a cup of coffee was handed to her. The smell of coffee awakened her senses, and she felt her body ache for the caffeine. Tommy was sitting beside her as he piled on the fruits and whipped cream onto his crepes before smiling at her. \"Mommy, you should have come with grandpapa and i!\" he began, staring at his mom with bright eyes. \"We went ot the museum yesterday, they had this HUUUUGGGGEEEEE section on Batman and Robin!\" He rambled as his green eyes lit up in excitement. \"Plus they had even more dinosaurs this time.\" Jules smiled at Tommy as she drank her coffee, feeling the warm envelope her. \"Grandpapa even went and bought these stickers so we could cover my room with dinosaur stickers.\" The young boy continued as he shoved a large mouthful of breakfast into his mouth, and barely chewing. Zanobi saw the bow was struggling to talk and eat as he continued for his grandson, while pushing the berries to her. \"Yes, we got Thomas lots of dinosaur things for him, it'll be great for his bedroom to be personalized at the apartment.\" Zanobi paused as he glanced at Camilla. \"Your mama even ordered dinosaur themed room accessories to go with the rest of the furniture.\" Julietta nodded as she spooned some berries on the crepe she had. It took her a few moments to realize what he said. \"Wait, the rest of the furniture?\" Julietta asked as Zanobi nodded. \"Yeah! Grandpapa and I went and shopped for all this bedroom stuff. They are even able to bring it today!\" Thomas exclaimed as she sighed. Zanobi and Camilla meant were just trying to help but Julietta hated when they bought her extra things since they were already so generous to her with her monthly allowance while in school. \"Okay sweetie, \"Julietta began as she stifled a bit of a yawn. \"Bruce will be stopping by later too.\" She began taking small bites of her food, as she listened to Thomas tell Camilla all about the museum trip- especially what grandpapa really enjoyed. Jules eyes focused on Tommy as she felt the twinge of bittersweetness. Thomas looked more like his father with each passing day- and it stung with the incident of last night. Tommy had the same facial structure as Jason, and his bright green eyes. From Julietta, he gained a tanner complexion and mole and his hair being a dark brown that some would mistake for black at night. Anyone that had known Jason could easily see him in his son. Thinking about last night and Jason made Jules lose her appetite as she pushed away the half eaten crepe. She was patient in waiting for everyone else to finish, and answered questions as they came. When everything was cleaned, Zanobi insisted on driving them back- which Julietta was slightly grateful for since they had a carseat installed in the one vehicle. Everyone piled into the car, as Jules sent Bruce a quick text about the unexpected company to her apartment. Her brain went back to the idea of a nap later with Thomas. She was sure he'd would join her since Thomas was a cuddler that had been keen on sharing a bed with Julietta long before he was out of his crib. With Thomas starting school in September, Julietta knew that the few months to adjust first would be good for Thomas to adjust to his own space. At the apartment complex, Julietta opted for the elevator with present company as they opened it to see Bruce waiting for them. The flower pot was back on the table. Zanobi was the first to go hug Bruce. \"Bruce my friend!\" Zanobi said before looking at the boxes around. \"I hope you don't mind, but I let the furniture movers in.\" Bruce told them as Julietta smiled. She was shocked though to see Bruce acting so alert since she was almost positive that he hadn't slept yet. \"Thanks Bruce. To be honest, I just found out about it an hour ago.\" She responded as her parents and son went to inspect the room that was filled with furniture now. Julietta stood next to him as she whispered quietly while staring at the plant. \"Did you find anything?\" Bruce nodded to her as a sigh escaped her lips. \"Are we safe?\" Julietta questioned as Bruce hesitated and nodded. He whispered to her though, \"I'm going to make sure that there is extra patrols for this area in the meantime though.\" Jules nodded as she walked towards the spare room. The room looked as if Thomas had pulled it directly from his mind. Thomas was jumping on the bed saying how this was the best day ever as her parents were embraced as Zanobi leaned against the wall. They were tenderly watching their grandchild, both grateful to have some youth around. Julietta knew that her mama and step papa had tried for their own child, but were never successful. Both had given up on the idea when they were delightfully surprised with the news about being grandparents and were as active in his life as possible. After all, finding out about Thomas had been a silver lining in the dark grey clouds. - Jason sat on the rooftop across the street. Seeing the bare room he had snuck in and out of the previous now full of life with people he was quite familiar with almost warmed his heart. He stared at them through binoculars through the mask. Jason's intrigue was on the youngest member in the room. The kid was maybe a kindergartener, and had the same smile as Julietta who was now helping the boy put up stickers in his room. Jason watched Bruce, Zanobi and Camilla leave but he didn't move. He was unwinding after all and musing at the idea that this kid was clearly interested in dinosaurs but what young kid wasn't? Jason relaxed a bit as he saw Julietta hugging her son while he stood on the bed. She seemed to be a natural mother and had been raising the boy well as a single parent. Glancing to a watch, Jason saw the time and stood up. Although this had been fun, he had much more important tasks at hand than spying on them. There was so many more things to do before he visited again.[Chapter 5] So, my laptop was gone for a month approximately and I had to rewrite this chapter, so while I was at it I revised all the previous chapters. I feel like the story flows better now and is getting built up to have quite a few more chapters ahead that should make you all proud. Night had come quicker than Julietta would have liked as she stared at the laptop screen in front of her. It was a final assignment for her course that she was having difficulties. Since Thomas went to bed she had been working on it with no luck. Her mind was elsewhere. Leaning forward, Julietta grabbed her glass of wine and took a large gulp before looking at the time. It was already 2 am. Pressing her fingers against the bridge of her nose, Julietta opened her web browser to check the news for anything relevant. There was a few articles on the new Red Hood of Gotham, on how since his arrival the crime rate had dropped but drug trafficking rose. A separate article was rambling about how minors were having a more difficult time acquiring drugs. Julietta raised an eyebrow as she saved them to her desktop before shutting the laptop. That may be something to look into when she wasn't cramming at the end of the semester. Standing up, Julietta finished her glass of wine before walking to Thomas' room and checking on him. He was deeply asleep and snoring with his arms wrapped around the teddy bear that wore a Robin costume. The matching Batman one was on the floor. Julietta stayed leaning against the doorway for a few minutes, hearing some sniffles which made her think that perhaps Thomas was getting sick. Going over, she pressed a kiss to his forehead before placing the Batman teddy bear back on the bed and heading to her own room. The room felt off as she walked in, but Julietta pegged it to Thomas not sleeping in here nor having his things in this room anymore. She checked her phone once more to ensure that Bruce hadn't been trying to contact her. The screen was blank as Julietta sighed and ran a hand through her untamed curls before closing her eyes. Maybe she was being paranoid- perhaps spending time with Bruce had worn away. Setting the phone on her bed, Julietta moved to take a step forward when an arm came around her and a hand covered her mouth. Squirming, Julietta tried throwing an elbow back as she felt it connect with the torso before trying to lunge forward only to be yanked back against the chest. Julietta drove her heel down her assailant's shin as cursing was heard behind her but she still was being held onto and dragged to the wall. Julietta's body was twisted as she felt her back against the cold wall, a hand continued to cover her mouth as the other one held her wrists over her head. She was faced to face with a man in a large red mask that covered his head. \"If you promise not to scream, I'll take my hand off your mouth.\" He said as Julietta glared to the man. \"You wouldn't want to wake up Thomas.\" Julietta stiffed as she took a moment to think before nodding. She watched the figure release her and take a step back as Julietta stayed pressed against the wall. \"Red Hood.\" She whispered out as her hands rested beside her. He laughed and held his hands up. \"Well, at least I don't need to introduce myself,\" he kidded before asking. \"So, how did you like the flowers you got yesterday? After all you did even show them to Bruce.\" Julietta crossed her arms over her chest as she tried staying brave. Her phone was behind Red Hood and it would take too long for her to call Bruce to save her. Words weren't coming to her as she bit her lip and nodded to him slowly. She took a step forward as Julietta tried to find the words. \"How did you copy his handwriting? Why did you take my photo?\" Julietta questioned as she planted her feet firmly on the floor. She knew that Red Hood could overpower her easily. Heck, even Julietta could see the gun on his side. Julietta bit back her comment about if Red Hood had a sick fetish in tricking people regarding their loved ones. Her eyes were full of anger as Red Hood smirked, not that Julietta could see his expression. \"I didn't have to forge the handwriting.\" He reasoned as Julietta marched forward waving her finger at him. \"So you are just telling me that you have the exact handwriting of my dead boyfriend? Huh?\" she hissed out at Red Hood grabbed her wrist. \"Well, that's just my handwriting you see.\" \"What about the photo?\" \"Well, I thought it'd be good for old time's sake.\" He reasoned as Julietta raised an eyebrow. \"Old time's sake? The photo was of me and Jason- no one else. He DIED and has been for five years. If Jason came back, he would never have been away for this long.\" \"You of all people know that strange things can happen Jules,\" Red Hood offered as she paused. \"Wha- what did you just call me?\" \"Jules,\" Red Hood said as he smiled. \"The Jules who named her son Thomas Peter Todd and always made zeppole for her boyfriend.\" Gears were clicking in place as her bottom lip quivered a bit. \"What did you do to Jason?\" Julietta finally asked him as he took a step forward and clicked the button on the side of his helmet. It hissed when it unlocked as Red Hood pulled off the mask. A gasp broke off the silence as Julietta stared at the familiar face. Even after five years, Julietta could recognize him. \"J-jason?\" \"In the flesh, Jules.\" He whispered and waited for her to close the distance. He had thought of this for the better part of the day, for how Julietta would respond to this. Part of him hoped that she would just rush over and kiss him; part of him also expected her to slap him. What Jason hadn't expected was that Julietta would cling to her chest and burst into tears. It wasn't a pretty crying, her face was red and the sobs sounded more like choking sounds as the tears flowed down. His heart ached seeing her cry as Jason took some steps forward to embrace her. He could feel that Julietta's legs were wobbly as her hands clung to the shirt under his jacket. Jason arms held her close as he could feel her head nuzzle into his chest. One of his hands moved to gently stroke her hair and closed his eyes. Jason waited until the sobs turned into the occasional sniffle and the woman in his arms felt more secure before he loosened is grip enough so that Julietta could lean back and look at him. Tentatively, her tanned fingers moved up to take off his eye mask and dropping it. Time felt like it slowed down when her hazel eyes connected to his green ones as a smile came on her face. It was a miracle to her to see Jason once again. \"Jason,\" She whispered over and over again quietly as he nodded to her- feeling bliss hearing his name from her lips. \"I- how, why?\" Julietta questioned as he let out a sigh. This was the fun part, explaining everything to her about where he had been for the last five years. \"This'll take a while Jules, let's sit down.\" Julietta watched Jason as he finished explaining what had been going on to him from Sarajevo, to his resurrection and to his desire to remove the Joker from Gotham permanently as he laid on her bed. His jacket and boots had been discarded. Julietta sat near his head, occasionally touching him as if he was checking to make sure she hadn't been dreaming. Julietta was listening intently to him, and instinctively began to rub Jason's scalp or intertwine their fingers when feeling tense. She wasn't sure how to react with her brain still processing everything as Julietta stifled a yawn. It was around 3:30 in the morning and even Jason was starting to feel the exhaustion that he attributed to nearly being killed lack of sleep. It didn't help the bed was quite comfortable, and he felt at ease. \"Enough about me, Jules why don't you tell me your favourite memory about Thomas?\" Jason asked with his eyes half lidded. Pausing, Julietta looked at him before down to her lap. \"It's cheesy, I know but my favourite memory was about the day he had been born.\" Julietta whispered as her hand came out and grasped his in both of hers. \"It had only been a few months since I lost you,\" Julietta began as Jason raised an eyebrow as he sat up a bit. \"A few months? Jules you were only three months along when I went to Sarajevo. Thomas' dating ultrasound said he was like six months away from being born. Wasn't he the size of a lime?\" Jason asked as Julietta nodded. Giving Jason's hand a squeeze she nodded. \"Yeah, there was some complications and if it wasn't for Dick I may have lost Thomas.\" Jason raised an eyebrow as she felt the pressure to continue. \"I went to a gala with my parents, Dick and Bruce. The Joker decided to try and have hostages. Who better than a pregnant single teen mom?\" She said with a half laugh before going on. \"He threatened everyone and kept waving this crow bar around.\" Julietta said as Jason's eyes widened. \"At one point, I tried to get away from him but he just slammed the crowbar right at the top of my stomach before pulling me into a hug and whispered. \"Sometimes to make an omelette, you need to break a few Robin eggs.\" Sucking in a breath, Julietta looked at Jason. \"I was then pushed down the stairs beside him- thankfully Dick was able to stop me quickly as Batm- Bruce intervened and arrested the Joker. I was in shock, and Richard noticed that I was bleeding. He rushed me to the hospital and at six months I had to give birth to Thomas.\" Jason's knuckles were white in anger as Julietta's tone changed. \"But the moment I held Thomas, this sense of loneliness left me. I felt like you were with me, even though you were gone.\" Her eyes were soft as Julietta continued. \"Mama came into the room with my step papa and they were crying tears of joy. When Bruce came and met Thomas, it was the first time I saw him or Alfred smile in quite some time.\" Laying down, Julietta put her head beside Jason's as she looked at the ceiling. \"It was the first time things felt relatively happy since we lost you Jason.\" Yawning, Julietta turned on her side as she smiled at him as Jason moved his hand to rest on her hip. \"I promised you I'd be there for you always Jules.\" Jason said as he leaned forward and pressed a kiss to her forehead. \"Why don't you tell me some more stuff?\" he inquired as Julietta started talking, the occasional yawn cutting her off mid-sentence. Jason let Julietta continue her stories, even when they became barely coherent words as she fell asleep and curled up against his shoulders. He supposed that he could close his eyes for a few hours, after all it was more comfortable than the abandoned apartment with a mattress on the floor. - The sun was shining through the windows as Jason slept on Julietta's bed, still deeply asleep as he snored and curled into the pillows nearby. He was stirred awake by a buzzing with music. Looking up with half shut eyes as he pawed around for the source of the noise. Jason saw Julietta's phone buzzing with a call from Bruce. He knew he shouldn't answer it but looked around to see where Julietta was. Sitting up, Jason saw that she wasn't in the room but the bedroom door was open. Taking a minute, Jason went through Julietta's one drawer to find a shirt that may be more casual than his work shirt. Finding a band shirt, Jason smirked as he recognized it as one of his. He stripped his off before throwing on the band shirt. Walking carefully to the main section of the apartment, Jason noticed Thomas sitting on part of the counter as he seemed to be animatedly trying to talk as Julietta was cooking beside him. Thomas looked over at Jason as he smiled and waved. \"Mommy, you're friend Jay is up!\" he exclaimed before a small coughing fit. Jason smiled as he went up to Thomas and smiled. \"Hey little man,\" Jason said as he held his hand out for a fist bump before noticing a cup in his face with Julietta smiling at him. He took it and gave Julietta her phone instead as he watched Thomas scooting off the counter to run to the television. He could hear the familiar melody of a cartoon on as he laughed. \"Man, I thought they would have replaced that show by now. I remember being obsessed with that sponge man and star fish.\" Jason said as he took a gulp of coffee. It was a good cup and somehow Julietta still knew how he took it. He stayed near her as his back leaned against the counter. \"Bruce tried calling you Jules.\" He muttered as she glanced to screen before setting down the phone and continuing on making food. Jason's mouth water at homemade food instead of some convenience store microwave sandwich. He could see there was scrambled eggs, hash browns and bacon. He hadn't been planning on staying for breakfast, but Jason was not going to turn down a chance at some good food. Setting down the cup beside Julietta, he searched for the dishes, making sure his fingers danced across the small of Jules back or hips bumped when he passed her. Jason chuckled to himself, thinking about how if things had gone differently this could have been a typical day for the trio. It felt quite domestic and different than the norm for him as of late. Julietta came over to the table with food as Thomas was quick to follow. He sat across from his mother and left the seat at the end for Jason. Thomas and Jason both stacked up their plates with food before Julietta dished out only a small amount of food onto her plate as she ate. Thomas glanced between Jason and Julietta as he spoke to his mother, of course in Italian as Jason groaned. Great, another person to be able to speak about him in front of Julietta. Shaking it off, Jason told himself that his future would need to include Italian lessons. Distracting himself, Jason looked at Thomas as he couldn't help but see the resemblance between Thomas and himself. There was no doubt that Thomas was his son- after all if it wasn't for a slightly lighter hair, tan skin and a mole Tommy could have been his twin at that age. The buzzing of a phone cut Julietta off as she excused herself from the table to take a phone call from Bruce again. Thomas waited until the bedroom door shut before turning to Jason. \"So Jay, I have a question.\" He asked through a mouthful of egg before swallowing the mouthful. \"Are you dating my mom?\" Jason paused as he looked to Thomas. \"Why do you think that?\" \"Since you were cuddled up with mommy and she seems really happy with you around.\" Jason smiled at Thomas before shaking his head. \"Well, we aren't dating but we do care about one another.\" Jason tried explaining, not wanting to give away too much since he didn't want Thomas to get his hopes up. \"Could you though? Grandmama says she hasn't dated since my dad.\" Thomas paused as he set his fork down. \"Earlier it looked like you were looking at mom like how grandpapa looks at my grandmama.\" Leaning over, Jason looked at the door to make sure it was closed still before looking at Thomas. \"You know, when your mom found out your grandparents were engaged she said that's what she wanted in life. Someone to love her like your grandpapa loved your grandmamma.\" Jason leaned a bit more forward. Thomas smiled as he was about to ask something when he began to cough some more. Thomas shook it off with a sip of orange juice before the door opened revealing Julietta. She smiled at the two before sitting down. \"Sorry about that, Bruce has some news to give me later and wanted to figure out a time for me to come over.\" She explained with a purposeful glance to Jason before Thomas asked. \"Can Jay come with us?\" \"Sorry bud, not today.\" Jason replied as he leaned over and ruffled his hair. \"But maybe if you're mom wants, I can come some time again.\" Thomas seemed to beam in delight as he nodded. \"Can he mom? Jay could watch the Jurassic Park movies with me if he likes dinosaurs! Or even those Goosebump shows? Pleeeeeaaaasssssseeee?\" Thomas begged as he glanced to Jason. \"Do you like dinosaurs or scary things?\" Thomas asked as Jason grinned. \"Yes I do, I used to watch horror movies with your mom all the time but she'd have to hide behind me,\" Jason said before adding. \"Or your dad.\" Thomas seemed so excited. \"This is awesome!\" Julietta smiled as she looked at Thomas. \"If Jay is able to, then he is more than welcome but his work is busy.\" Julietta picked up the empty plates as she looked to Thomas. \"Now, why don't you go shower before we head out to see Bruce and Alfred.\" Thomas nodded as he ran to his room shouting. \"I'm going to wear that new sweater grandpapa got me mommy! Bruce will love it, the hood has the Robin mask!\" he exclaimed as Jason laughed and leaned back. Looking over to Julietta, he sighed before picking up the rest of the dishes and brought them to the sink. His arm went on either side of Julietta as he pressed a kiss to the back of her head as she rinsed off the plates. \"You really are okay with me being around Thomas?\" Julietta turned around as she glanced up to Jason, a flush covering her cheeks. \"Of course Jason- he seemed to really like you. Usually he takes a bit to warm up to people.\" Her hands were beside Jason's on the counter as she whispered. \"But I think you may need to head out with us when we go.\" Jason nodded as he pushed away to let Julietta have her space. \"Sounds reasonable, but do you have a bag I could shove my helmet and things into?\" Julietta nodded as she grabbed Jason's hand to lead him into her room before letting go of his hand and grabbing a bag from the closet from him. He collected his things and placed them on the bed, before grabbing the bag from Julietta. It took less than a minute to pack her things as he listened to the water from the shower running in the background as Julietta seemed to be staring at him. \"Jason, you will be careful, right?\" Julietta questioned as he looked at her and hesitated to answer. Jason didn't want to tell her that if it came down to it, he would blow up himself with the Joker and even Batman if it came down to it. Sighing, Julietta looked at their feet before back up at Jason. \"Try to come back to me Jason.\" Julietta whispered as she leaned up on her tip toes to kiss his cheek delicately. Jason's hand moved to cup her chin as he stared down at Julietta. \"I'll try, but can I at least get one kiss, just in case?\" Julietta nodded as she felt his head lean down to brush her lips slowly. It was a hesitant kiss at first that quickly turned into one that showed off a deeper meaning. One of longing and love as hands naturally fell into place on the other person. Jason could hear the sound of the shower turn off as he pulled away slowly, pressing one gentle peck at the end before he walked away to slide on his boots. Soon Jason will have made Gotham a safer place, and all he could hope was that he was going to be there to continue his life and see Thomas grow. Voila, here is the newest chapter! I hope you enjoy this and I hope to give you more updates soon.[Chapter 6] Lots of stuff happens in this chapter but I like how it progressed a bit. I'm not sure how many more chapters are left but I do have a good deal planned for this. Julietta stared at Bruce, as she twirled the cup in her hands as they sat in the sitting room. She leaned in the soft chair as she avoided eye contact with Bruce. \"Jason is back.\" Bruce spoke softly as Julietta took a deep breath. Her brain was debating between lying to Bruce or not. She knew that Bruce was skilled in detecting lies and had called her out on lies before. From reading body languages to devices that assisted him in this. Glancing up, Julietta's eyes connected with his as she nodded. \"I know.\" It was barely a whisper as she could feel the eyes on her. \"Jason came to visit last night to tell me what exactly happened.\" Biting her lip, Jules leaned forward and set the cup on her table. \"He then crashed in the apartment.\" \"Did Thomas see him?\" Bruce inquired as Julietta gave him a nod. \"Yeah, he thinks Jason is just a friend named Jay though who's visiting Gotham and needed a place to crash since he couldn't find a vacant hotel.\" Julietta looked up to Bruce as she leaned into the cushions. An uncomfortable silence fell into the room as Julietta felt her anxiety build up as she began to pluck at the cuticles around her nails. \"What's your plan if Jason stays around? Will you make him part of Thomas' life again?\" Bruce questioned as Julietta immediately felt her shoulders slump forward and the air kick out of her lungs. Of course Bruce was asking all the tough questions today. \"I don't know Bruce. I want him to be in it- but I've heard what Ja-Red Hood has done since he came back.\" Jules began as she stopped picking at her cuticles. \"It was already enough risk to be with Jason when he was Robin, but as Red Hood?\" Closing her eyes, Julietta could feel her eyes stinging. Tears threatening to come out. \"He's not exactly a hero, but he's also not a villain from what I can tell. Like he's killing people; but he's also reduced the amount of kids getting drugs. Maybe he could do good for Gotham in a different way.\" Julietta sat there trying to calm herself down as she then opened her eyes and glanced at the older man. \"Besides, Jason wouldn't be able to do a lot of normal things. After all, he was your ward so many people know his face- so going out to dinner with Jason and Thomas would be hard and he couldn't attend holidays with my parents since they'd recognize him in a heartbeat. Thomas couldn't be picked up from school in September by Jason because he's legally dead…\" \"You seem to have put a lot of thought into this.\" Bruce remarked as Julietta nodded before leaning forward to grab her cup and take a sip. \"As much as you can in 9 hours.\" Julietta retorted as she let out a sigh. \"I feel like everything is going to hit the fan soon, Bruce.\" In her mind, Julietta couldn't help but add ' I'm scared.' Bruce wasn't a master detective for nothing, He could tell the young woman in front of him was terrified about everything. He wasn't sure how to comfort her since there was so many things going on. In such a short time span a dear family member came back from the grave but had different morals than before- or maybe was just more willing to show his morals now. \"I have to agree with you. Red Hood has caused an uproar in the criminal empire; which won't go without consequences.\" Bruce responded as Julietta nodded. \"Let's not focus on that for the moment. Why don't we check on Alfrred and Thomas?\" He suggested as the two stood up with their cups to go to the kitchen. The smell of cookies was wafting through the room as Julietta and Bruce looked in the doorway. Alfred and Thomas were dropping cookie dough onto trays as Alfred told Thomas stories of Jason and Bruce when they were growing up in the manor. Bruce smiled at Julietta. \"Alfred really enjoys having youth around the house, doesn't he?\" Julietta questioned as Bruce nodded. \"He won't admit it, but he really does. I'm sure Alfred thought we may not have any more youth here after Jason. Yet now he has Thomas and there was even Tim until he joined the Titans.\" \"You know you probably should look into getting a new assistant. I know Alfred has been taking on the reigns to help recently but he could probably use the help.\" Jules nudged Bruce as she looked to him sincerely. \"Maybe someone who knows of the bat in your closet to cover you.\" Julietta grabbed the cup from Bruce's hand before moving around Alfred and Thomas to rinse out the cups. Thomas was grinning as he asked Alfred questions, although his voice was sounding far raspier than when they arrived to the Wayne manor. Poor boy was getting sick but he wasn't letting it ruin his enjoyment. Julietta joined Bruce to take a seat near the duo making cookies, as Thomas began to retell the stories Alfred just told him. - It wasn't long after that Thomas and Julietta left the Wayne Manor. Thomas was starting to feel quite unwell and just wanted to take his nap. Alfred was kind enough to escort them home with a stop to the pharmacy. Thomas, however, had fallen asleep before he arrived home and so Julietta carried the four year-old up to their apartment- electing to use the elevator this time. Thomas made no protest as Julietta tucked him into bed, giving him a bit of medicine and water. It gave her the rest of the afternoon to let her mind run through everything else. Schoolwork was a beautiful distraction. By the time it was dark, Julietta cooked, cleaned the apartment and got Thomas to eat a bit of soup before he went back to sleep in his Batman pajamas with some more medicine. The apartment was eerily silent as Julietta continuously refreshed the news page's website. The Joker had nearly set all the drug lords aflame, until Red Hood and Batman intervened. Then Red Hood took the Joker away from Batman. That was hours ago and now Julietta was sitting in the apartment in hopes of hearing any word about Red Hood's condition or if the Joker was back in Arkham. Her heart raced and palms were clammy and nothing seemed to calm her- not even a long soak in the tub. Hearing a thud, Julietta's heart skipped a beat as she ran to her bedroom to see if it was a good or bad ruckus. Jason was laying on the floor with a groan- no Red Hood mask to be seen as Julietta noticed the bloody hand. \"Holy fuck Jason.\" She gasped out as she ran towards him and checked for any worse damage. He looked as if he had been thrown through a wall or something. His hand was bloody and raw in some areas, there was cuts all over his body and bruises. Julietta let out a sigh as Jason began to sit up. Soft groans escaped his lips as he clenched his side with his good hand. Julietta's hand went onto his cheekbone as she looked at him in the eyes. \"Can you move?\" Jason nodded as she stood up, holding her hands out to help him up as Jason waved them off- choosing to take his time getting up without help. He winced with each movement but was too hot headed to accept Julietta's help. \"Come on, you need to get all this dirt and debris off of you before it infects your cuts.\" Jason followed Julietta as she marched towards the bathroom. Although she was keeping a calm expression on for Jason, her heart was racing. Jason shut the bathroom door behind the two as he leaned against it. \"I… I'll be fine Jules.\" He finally muttered only for sharp hazel eyes gave him a look to immediately silence him. Julietta wasn't buying that crap for an instance. Jason also knew Julietta like a book; and could tell the worry that was wrecking havoc on her mind so he raised his hands in defeat. Julietta's expression softened as she turned to put the stopper in and began to run hot water for a bath. Julietta turned over once again as Jason was struggling to get his shirt off one handed. Taking a deep breath, she stepped forward. \"Let me help.\" Jason nodded as Julietta untucked his shirt to pull it over his head. \"I got it from here Jules.\" Jason said with a small smile as she nodded. \"But, you can stay in here… you know, if you want.\" Jason added as Julietta flushed a bit as she tried to calm her racing heart. \"Okay.\" Turning around, Julietta gave him privacy with her hands covering her eyes until she heard the sounds of Jason getting into the bathtub. Julietta lowered her hand as she knelt to get the first aid kit from under the sink. She backed up until she felt her calves touch the bathtub before she sank down so her back was against the bathtub. Julietta's knees were pulled to her chest and tilted her head up a bit so she could stare at the ceiling with the first aid kit beside her. \"You didn't have to turn around you know.\" Jason said. Scoffing, Julietta shook her head. \"It's been almost 5 years Jason. I wasn't going to watch you get naked without your consent. Now lay your hand on the side of the tub so I can clean it.\" \"Well, I know it's been five years but you are allowed to look at me Jules.\" Jason said as he rested his bad hand on the edge of the tub. Julietta turned slightly to get a better look at it, still giving Jason as much privacy as she could. The skin looked as if it was burned off with various layers worse than others it mostly was near his index finger and thumb. Biting her lip, she opened the first aid kit and took out an alcohol wipe. \"Jason, this'll sting.\" She said before pressing it on Jason's hand as she heard Jason bite back a groan. Glancing over, Julietta gave him a sympathetic look before she discarded it and did the other side of his hand with a second alcohol wipe. He didn't sound as pained this time. Grabbing the gauze and medical tape, she pressed a square on the skin between the thumb and index finger before wrapping up the rest with general gauze and taping the edges of the gauze down. \"There… that should do.\" Julietta said as she kept Jason's hand in between hers delicately. It was quiet in the bathroom before she spoke up. \"I was scared tonight when I heard about you on the news Jason.\" She admitted before continuing. \"I was more scared when they didn't know what was happening. To be honest I just wanted to wake up and see you curled up in bed beside me with Thomas calling you daddy.\" Jason's hand squeezed one of hers before he took his bandaged hand out of the grasps to grab her chin. \"Julietta I want that more than anything; but I also know that Gotham needs people to keep them safe and make it a better place for Thomas' generation.\" Jason said before he turned her head to his with green eyes staring into hazel ones. \"Jules, I love you so much.\" He admitted before leaning over and kissing her. A spark ran through Jules as she closed her eyes and kissed back as her hands grasped onto his shoulders. Jason's hand clutched onto her cheek as the other one tugged onto her shirt. Lips fumbled to get their rhythm back as Jason nipped at her lip as she pulled away a moment before she stood up enough to crawl into the bathtub and straddle Jason not caring about her clothes getting wet. Jason grinned as he leaned forward and pressed her lips against hers once again. Jason took lead in the kiss as he pushed his tongue between her lips as Julietta's fingers wound into his hair and tugged it a bit. Jason hummed in enjoyment before his good hand began to pull up the wet t shirt and throw it away. His lips pressed against Julietta's neck, kissing a trail down her neck to chin with nipping along the way. Julietta gasped as she pulled her body back a moment as she took a deep breath. \"Jason, I- you're injured, we shouldn't do this until you're better.\" Julietta tried to be rational as Jason scoffed. \"I don't care if I'm missing both an arm and a leg Jules, I will always want you.\" Jason retorted before kissing her again. \"Do you want to?\" Jason asked as Julietta pulled him into a kiss. \"Fuck yes Jason.\" She said as Jason pressed his lips against hers, helping Julietta fiddle out of the rest of her clothes. - Julietta laid on the bed as she looked at the time. It was 7 am and she felt energized even though she barely got any sleep. Panting, she smiled at Jason who was curled up with his head on her chest. He kissed the skin softly and looked at her with sleepy eyes. \"Jason, as much as I'd love to go another round with you, our son needs breakfast.\" Julietta whispered as Jason pouted at her and wrapped his arms around her tighter before letting go. Laughing at him, Julietta and Jason sat up to get dressed. Julietta made sure to wear a scarf because she noticed the hickeys on her neck. Jason on the other hand, decided to rifle through Julietta's closet, quickly finding one of his old sweaters. He gave her a look before throwing it on, and both headed to the kitchen. Jason began to make food as Julietta checked on Thomas. By the time Jason finished making oatmeal, Julietta had curled up with Thomas on the couch as Jason brought the three bowls over. Each one had berries in it and Thomas slowly ate at it as he watched cartoons on the television. It was almost peaceful for Jason, as they spent the next while watching cartoons. However, he knew when there was a knock on the door. Julietta went to get it as Jason immediately made eye contact with Bruce. The room was tense, except for the small child who was now laying with his head in Jason's lap that seemed to be asleep. Julietta awkwardly let Bruce in, and sat back down with Jason. \"Jason.\" \"Bruce.\" \"Jay why is he calling you Jason?\" Thomas croaked out as Julietta's eyes widened a moment, as did Jason as they looked at Thomas. Thomas sat up a bit, as he rubbed an eye. \"Isn't Jason daddy's name?\" he mumbled. \"Well you see kiddo…\" Jason began as he looked at Julietta for assistance. \"Thomas, this is your father. Meet your dad, Jason Todd.\"[Chapter 7] \"You lied!\" the toddler screamed as the hot tears poured down his face. Thomas had taken it as expected as anyone could expect- which was terribly. He had been crying and getting upset for quite some time. Even though earlier Thomas was sick enough that it hurt to speak; he still yelled. Julietta glanced over at the two men who were looking to her for advice as she crouched to be eye level with Thomas. \"Hey Thomas. Thomas honey, look at me.\" Julietta asked as the young boy sniffled and glared at her with piercing eyes. A look that duplicated Jason's. \"This is complicated but I'm going to explain, okay?\" \"You lied! You lied!\" \"Tommy; I didn't mean to lie. You see up until a few days ago, we all thought your father was dead.\" Julietta admitted, not sure how much she should tell a young child but decided to take the risk. \"Why?\" Thomas asked as Julietta paused. Because the Joker thought it'd be interesting to blow him up and then a man decided to throw him into a pit of water which brought him back a little screwy for a few years? That wasn't something she could tell Thomas. \"He uh well,\" Julietta started as she looked to Jason for help as Jason came over and sat beside Julietta. \"What I was told was I was found after an explosion and brought to the hospital. I woke up after with no memories;\" Jason began as he leaned forward. \"But then I started to remember and when I finally could; I came back home to your mother and me.\" Thomas nodded before asking. \"Who all knows?\" \"Just us four right now.\" Julietta actually thought that was a believable reason as she watched her son on the couch. It was a moment of tense silence before Thomas spoke. \"Are you going to leave?\" Thomas whispered as a huge sigh left Jason. IT was a good question, as he shook his head. \"I'm going to be around for as long as you'll have me.\" \"I'm still mad.\" \"You know what? That's okay Thomas.\" Julietta said as she stood up. \"But how about right now; we put you down for a nap?\" Julietta questioned as her son raised his arms up and nodded. Julietta scooped him up as she sent a look to the two boys as she mouthed Fix This before taking Thomas to his room. When Julietta came out of the room, she heard the two bickering as she rubbed her temple. There was just too much drama for the day. \"Enough you two! Can we put aside all this drama for a day?\" Julietta squeezed her eyes tightly while taking a deep breath. \"I get it that you have conflicting views; but we have other stuff to worry about. What are we going to do now that Thomas knows about Jason? It's already hard enough to keep this discreet, but if some paparazzi catches a glimpse of him near you or I Bruce, there's going to be questions.\" The two men quieted down as they looked at the young woman who was clearly too annoyed to be dealing with their issues at the moment. She honestly wished she could just push all this drama back a week until she was done with school for the semester but fate was cruel. Jason glanced over at Bruce with a look as a hand moved to run through his hair. \"Can we talk to Barbara; I have an idea.\" Julietta hadn't been expecting that they would bring Barbara to her apartment; so once again it was crowded as the three members of the Bats family were chatting in her living room with Barbara typing a mile a minute with the computer resting on a tray on her wheelchair. Their plan was to plant some articles around that led people to believe Jason was thought to be dead- but really was found and brought to a hospital where he remained in a coma for three years. For a year, this \"John Doe\" went through physio and hypnosis to recover his memories. It wasn't the greatest plan but at least it should do for the general public. Which would be evidence for when Bruce released a statement later welcoming Jason back as a 'blessing'. It would still be the center of news in Gotham; but at least Bruce and Jason would have more control over the situation. Glancing to the hallway, Julietta saw Thomas peeking his head out- eyes red from tears as Julietta gave him a smile but let him move at his own pace. Thomas eventually came out to greet his 'Aunt Babs' before curling up on the couch and watched her work. Bruce had left with Jason to sort things out with Alfred and Dick as Julietta read over Barbara's writing. \"Why don't you change your flow in this article? It is supposed to be written by someone else but they have the same flow as the last one. Maybe shorter and blunt sentences?\" Barbara nodded as Julietta fell ungracefully onto the free space of the couch. \"Rough week?\" \"Well; its not every week you have a ton of assignments, have your first love and father to your child come back from the dead.\" Julietta said before remembering Thomas and quickly adding. \"Or what you thought was the dead.\" \"That's fair. I was just as shocked when Bruce told me.\" Barbara admitted, \"Even when I saw him I thought it was fake. Like my mind was playing tricks on me.\" Thomas listened carefully as he watched Barbara with wide eyes. Barbara caught sight of it as she smiled to Thomas. \"What about you little guy? How are you doing with this?\" Thomas seemed to pause as he thought; looking between his mother and Babs before he answered in a hoarse voice. \"I don't like they lied to me.\" \"Anything else?\" \"Happy I have my daddy.\" Thomas whispered as Barbara nodded. \"I get that Tommy. I didn't have my mother there in much of my life; and I constantly wished I could have two parents like everyone else. Now you have both of them life will change; for the better though.\" Thomas nodded in agreeance as he curled up a bit on the couch. Julietta smiled at both Barbara and Thomas. Maybe this would work out, she thought. Jason and Bruce finally had everything planned out; that evening they would go to a nice restaurant with a private room for Bruce, Alfred, Dick, Jason, Tim, Damian, Barbara, Julietta and Thomas. Stephanie was invited but was unfortunately unavailable- whether that was because she didn't want to deal with Tim during an off period or not; it wasn't any of Bruce's business unless they made it his business. Jason sat in the restaurant waiting for Bruce to return with Tim and Damian, while Alfred fetched Julietta, Barbara and Thomas. Tapping his fingers restlessly on the table before pulling out his small flip phone. It was a disposable phone that he used to contact the gang leaders. He refused to pull it out anywhere near Bruce who was still quite upset with Jason's methods. Sending some messages quickly, he knew that it would be fine to stay a little later this evening before doing his Red Hood duties. Especially with Black Mask and Joker currently under tight supervision. He was pulled out of his thoughts when the door opened and Barbara wheeled into the room with Thomas on her lap. Alfred and Julietta followed behind; although Jason had to note that Julietta looked like she did try to dress up for this evening and by comparison, Jason looked almost too casual. Thomas saw Jason as he waved before crawling off of Barbara's lap and walking over to Jason before sitting on the chair beside him. His head barely reaching the table as he immediately started asking. \"So; what do I call you?\" Thomas questioned as Jason paused. \"What do you mean?\" \"Do I call you dad? Jason? Jay?\" Thomas questioned more as Jason paused. He didn't know how to answer that- but for him his only father figure was known as Bruce. \"Any of the three; I mean usually dad comes with a lot of trust and parenting first but I haven't given you that yet bud.\" Thomas seemed to nod in understanding before he asked another question. \"Okay… what's your favourite colour?\" \"Red.\" Jason responded with a grin before he asked. \"You?\" \"Green!\" Thomas immediately said. \"Though last week it was blue.\" Thomas seemed to be enjoying this as he continued asking more questions until the rest arrived for the chaotic dinner. The moment that Dick entered the room, it felt as if there was a pin dropped in the room as one minute Jason was sitting down and the next he had kicked back his chair to stand up with Dick standing in front of him, just staring at him. The two ex-Robins stared at each other for a few moments as Julietta glanced around to see what anyone else was doing. Thomas looked confused as he sat beside them. \"Dick.\" \"Jason.\" The two spoke; before walking away from each other as if their conversation was much longer than just saying each other's last names. Next Alfred came up to Jason; it was pleasant that Alfred joined everyone for dinner, but also needed since Alfred was just as much family as anyone in the room. Jason wasted no time in hugging the Butler tightly; Alfred holding on just as tightly while whispering how it was good to see Master Todd once again. Julietta relaxed as she watched them; seeing them finally let go of the hug as Jason fixed his chair and sit beside Thomas again. Bruce cleared his throat and smiled at everyone. \"Thank you everyone for coming.\" He began; with it sounding more like a business meeting than a family meeting. \"It's been a while since we have all been all able to be at this table together; but I am proud to say that many people are getting introduced to each other for the first time. Jason; I'd like for you to officially meet Tim Drake and Damian Wayne.\" Bruce's voice was clear and using his business voice. \"I am hoping this dinner will be good to have everyone relax and reconnect as a family; and NOT a work dinner.\" Bruce added, sparing a glance at Damian as he snorted and leaned in his chair. Thomas barely paid any attention as he swung his feet impatiently. Jason and the rest of the Batfamily nodded silently. Julietta sat there, slightly awkwardly knowing that business meant their criminal vigilance than anything else. Looking down at her lap a bit, Julietta bit her lip. A strong hand slipped into hers as she glanced over and noticed Jason holding her hand giving it a reassuring squeeze. Julietta smiled to Jason as she continued holding his hand. Bruce looked over at Julietta and Jason, as they glanced between one another. \"So;\" Julietta began as she sat straighter in her chair and kept Jason's hand in hers like an anchor. \"It was this week we found out that Jason hadn't actually died in Sarajevo. In fact, he had been in a coma for quite a bit; waking up with temporary amnesia. When Jason found out his past, he worked his way back here.\" \"As of today; Bruce and I have gone through the steps to legally bring me back from the dead; but we want to be ahead of the press in getting this out. So Bruce is going to be taking photos tonight to post.\" Jason added as Julietta nodded. The rest of the table nodded as a comfortable silence fell on the table. \"So, shall we eat?\"[Chapter 8] Julietta was surprised about how well the dinner went. The Robins all were getting along with playful teasing. She had left early with Thomas, leaving the Batfamily to catch up and speak about their more private matters. Matters that she didn't want to know. So, when Jason came back later, she was pleasantly surprised when he had used her front door. Julietta opened the bedroom door as she watched him check on Thomas. It warmed her heart. She adjusted her weight, not realizing she was on a squeaky floorboard. Jason whipped his head to see Julietta as he relaxed. Walking over to Julietta, he grinned and wrapped his arms around her waist before hoisting her up and heading towards the bedroom. Julietta buried her head into his neck, as she wrapped her arms around him before being laid on the bed with Jason cuddled against her. \"Good night?\" Jules questioned against his skin as he nodded. \"So great; I missed Bruce, Alfred and Dick.\" Jason replied as he kissed her cheek. \"What about Tim and Damian?\" Jason chuckled as he leaned up a bit. \"Tim seems like a smart kid, and Damian well… I think he and I will get along well.\" He responded as Julietta looked up to him with a genuine smile. Jason gave Jules a peck on the lips as he grinned. \"You know, we should sleep because of how busy tomorrow will be…\" Jason began as she raised an eyebrow to his mischievous grin. \"But…?\" \"But I'd love to spend more quality time with you.\" Jason said as he leaned down and kissed her once again, hands this time going on her cheeks as he happily deepened the kiss. - The next morning, Julietta could hear her phone going off as she groaned and ignored it. Choosing instead to roll over and curl into Jason's side. Jason chuckled as he leaned over and turned her phone on silent. He murmured against her shoulder that they should at least check the news to see what happened. Julietta rolled her eyes. \"Five more minutes.\" That didn't happen however, since Thomas chose that moment to come into the room and jump on the bed with Jason and Julietta. He curled up in between his parents as Jason laughed. Thomas smiled as he looked at his mom. \"Mommy can we have chocolate chip pancakes today?\" Julietta paused as Thomas leaned closer. \"Please.\" He drawled out as Julietta nodded. \"Yes; just give me a couple moments, kay?\" Thomas cheered as he scrambled off the bed and throw the doorway to the kitchen. Julietta gave Jason a look as they both got up with an unspoken agreement to do so as they changed into new clothes for the day. They both walked out to start the pancakes when a pounding started on the door. Julietta and Jason both looked at each other with a raised eyebrow as Jason's hand immediately went to his pocket where she was pretty sure a knife was. Giving him a look; Julietta went to the door and peeked through the peep hole before opening it. \"Mama, papa?\" She questioned as the two pushed into the house. Immediately Camilla was yelling in Italian faster than Jason think he had ever heard him. \"Mama; calm down.\" Julietta began as she glanced at Jason. Camilla saw this glance as she then stormed towards Jason and changed to English with a finger digging at Jason's chest. \"Who are you and what are you trying to pull? Pretending to be my daughter's dead fiancé and father of her son? Huh?\" Camilla asked as she continued. \"How did you convince Bruce this too, huh?\" Jason felt his back against the wall as the woman stared him down. He was actually somewhat afraid of this woman- which made him laugh thinking about him fighting the Joker with no fear. \"Camilla; its me. Jason.\" He began as Camilla glared at him. \"I'll prove it.\" Jason sighed as he began to speak. \"You catered Bruce's dinner event for the little café you used to work for and met Zanobi after Jules ran into him.\" She glared harder. \"You always teased me about how much I ate.\" \"You are terrified of spiders so one time, Jules and I hid a toy one under your oven mitt and you broke a heel when you saw it from falling back.\" Camilla gasped. \"THAT WAS YOU TWO?!\" before pausing and asking quietly. \"What else?\" \"Bruce ran the DNA tests himself Camilla… its me, Jason.\" He said as Camilla looked back to Julietta who just nodded. Zanobi stood beside Jules as Thomas held the chocolate chip bag for the pancakes but was more interested in watching his grandmother. Camilla cried out something again in Italian as she made a cross over her chest before hugging him. \"It's a miracle.\" Jason laughed softly as he hugged Camilla. \"It'd be more of a miracle if I'd have learned Italian in that time.\" When Camilla let go, she turned to her daughter. \"Why didn't you tell us Julietta? We found out this morning from the news and were so scared, then you didn't answer the phone.\" Julietta looked at her stepfather who gave her a questioning look as she sighed. \"Its been a long few days mom. Jason tried contacting me at first with the flowers, then with some other stuff. Bruce, Jason and I spent yesterday trying to get through stuff so we could have Jason legally brought back to life.\" Camilla nodded before she finally sat down, pleased with the answers. \"Does this mean you two will be married soon? Will Thomas have more siblings?\" \"MOM!\" Julietta asked as she sighed. Jason had only been alive again for Camilla for less than a minute but she was already wanting more grandkids. Jason was flustered as he looked at Thomas. \"So; pancakes?\"[Chapter 9] So sorry about the delay in updating. I kind of lost motivation with this story, thinking it wasn't that good and that people weren't interested in it. Then I got distracted with school and a lot of personal issues. I am back, and hopefully will have a new update for you in very early 2018. Julietta was walking up the stairs to her place as she hummed and fiddled with her keys. Thomas was at preschool for the day and now she was going to spend a few hours relaxing while Jason slept. He had been out all night and from what she had read in the papers, the streets have been hellish as of late. It seemed that in the time he had been dealing with his family, people were starting to become bolder and rebelling against his rule on the streets. With drugs going throughout the schools in bulk. Her gut churned at the thought, but she knew Jason putting the fear back on the street may be a necessary evil. After all; he was working with at least some good motives; protecting the youth and such. As she exited the staircase, Julietta looked up and saw someone sitting in front of her door. Her heart dropped as she froze. The man was in his forties, with a beer gut and his dark hair was greying and receding. Even though she hadn't seen him in many years, she recognized him immediately. \"Get out.\" She spoke as she crossed her arms over her chest to hide her shaky hands. The man stood as he grunted while standing up. \"That ain't no way to welcome family now, is it?\" he spoke with a lop-sided smile as he walked towards her with his arms wide open. \"Usually you give family members a hug.\" Julietta saw the gun on his hip as she pushed past him and stood in front of her door. \"The last time I saw you was when my mother finally left that man you call a brother.\" She pointed to the elevator door. \"Now I don't believe you were welcomed here, so leave.\" Her hand was shaking as she pointed it. Even after all these years, she was still fearful of her uncle and father. A glint left the man's eyes as he lowered his arms. \"Let me guess, your mother told you to forget about me and your pa?\" He scoffed, as he walked closer. \"No matter what your gold digger of a mother thinks, your father IS still my brother. He is ALWAYS YO PA.\" His fist connected with the door; causing a loud bang as Julietta flinched. He towered over her as Julietta kept her eyes on him. \"It was because of him and me you two even got a chance in America. WE did what work we could to make a living, putting food on the table and a roof over your ungrateful heads. Maybe your dad wasn't perfect, but he tried. He just seems to have lately run into some rotten luck.\" \"He beat my mother! As for rotten luck? You were working for Black Skull and the fucking mob!\" Julietta spoke as she saw his eyes darken and he raised his fist. She closed her eyes in fear; but the hit never came. Julietta noticed the firmness of the wooden door was gone against her back. Peaking open an eye, Julietta glanced back as she saw Jason standing behind her with his arms in a relaxed pose. \"Problem here, Jules?\" he asked, not taking his eyes off of Julietta's uncle as one hand firmly grabbed hers and tugged at her to come into the apartment. \"You interrupting my lesson to my niece about who her father is.\" Michael spoke as he looked down at Julietta again. \"The little fool forgets who her father is, gets convinced her dead boyfriend is replaced by a deadbeat like you. Hell, she's worse than her mother for falling for stupid lies.\" Jason scoffed as he looked down at himself, before letting go of Julietta's hand. \"Well; to be honest, even I thought I was dead for the longest time but you see…\" Jason began before he moved. In a flash, Michael was pinned against the opposite wall. Jason holding the man by his collar. \"I came back with a lot of anger built up. The man was shoving at Jason, but it looked like Jason was barely struggling. Michael spoke as he spat in Jason's face. \"I ain't scared of no rich boy.\" Jason swung his fist into the man's gut. \"I was a street kid.\" Jason spoke as he tossed the man to side. \"Now get the fuck out. I bet the neighbours have called the cops by now.\" The man scrambled up as he looked at Julietta \"Non puoi nasconderti dietro quel ragazzo per sempre. Tuo padre tornerà presto per sistemarti.\" Julietta face paled as she waited until her uncle was clear down the stairs before walking into the apartment. \"What did he say Jules?\" \"That you won't be around to protect me and dad will back soon to 'fix me.'\" Jules spoke as she dumped her bag on the table before sitting down. \"Seriously, what the fuck?\" Julietta spoke as she looked at Jason. \"It's been YEARS since we left, you'd think they would just give up by now. He's been in and out of prison a few times.\" Julietta rolled her eyes. \"Hell, you put him away a few times back in the day.\" Jason sat beside Jules as he put a hand onto hers. \"I think I have a solution to that but for now, you nap.\" Julietta agreed as she went down for a nap with Jason coming back soon after. She woke up before Jason did from the nap though, and knew she needed to get things ready before Thomas needed to be picked up. Walking into the living room, Julietta paused upon seeing the figure on her couch. Dark hair, and bright piercing green eyes were the first things she spotted. Sitting on the couch was Damian on a laptop. Jules tugged down the shirt she had further down her shorts as she raised a brow. \"Damian, what are you doing here?\" Damian did not respond right away but when he did, his eyes did not look over at June. \"Jason called me. Saying you needed someone to watch out for you.\" June nodded quite slowly as she headed to the kitchen pulling things out of the freezer. \"I take it you'll be here for dinner then?\" \"I've already set up some food to be delivered later.\" Damian spoke as Julietta puffed her cheeks up. This boy was a genius, but he was also an ass when it came to other humans. She put the food back in the freezer as she ran a hand through her hair. \"We've set a schedule to look out for you in the mean time while we look into what your uncle and dad want.\" There was a tension in the room as Damian added. \"Black Mask worked his money to get your dad out of jail. He's set to be released in a few days.\" Jules sighed, thinking about this. \"Okay, I guess I should let my mother know. Since a restraining order can only do so much.\" Damian pushed her cellphone towards her as she raised a brow. Damian merely shrugged. \"I checked it for any tampering.\" Jules phone call with her mother was quick, telling her that she found out about her father getting released. She also loosely told her mother about her uncle visiting, claiming that he told her. She left out the bit where Jason beat on Michael though. Damian was speaking to her after that, coming with her to pick up Thomas but she barely registered anything she said. Life was not fair, and Jules was just thankful it wasn't Jason experiencing this luck.[Chapter 10] Jules was starting to think she was dreaming when she woke up again to Jason crawling into bed with her and Thomas, who came in after a nightmare. It was near 4am and she would need to be up in a few hours but still. Once he settled the sheets over him, Julietta shifted to snuggle close to him with Thomas laying behind her. She knew it seemed crazy to have Jason back with her and to start things off where they left off but if Jules was truthful, this is what she had been hoping for every day since she lost him. Everything felt like it was right, and that worried Julietta. Nothing ever went in the right way for Jason. He saw his mother again after thinking she was dead, only to be beaten and blown up by the damn Joker. He tried getting rid of the Joker, but had to go against his own mentor and failed. Jules knew it was still a tense subject and she was glad the group of the Batfamily was working on figuring it out. \"Non puoi nasconderti dietro quel ragazzo per sempre.\" repeated in her mind as she bit her lip. You cannot hide behind that boy forever. It was true, but Jules had no idea what else to do. Her life was fleeing not fighting and hated violence. Sighing, she brought hands up to dig her palms into her eyes. There was likely no chance of Julietta getting sleep anytime in the near future. Her father was going to be released. Thankfully, Jason had already prepared for that, but it made her think more about the idea that she was once again hiding behind him. There was a shift to her side as Jules glanced over to see a pair of eyes staring at her. They were half lidded and clearly still wanting sleep but was reading her expression. Jason knew she was concerned, and not wanting to bother him, Julietta gave him a half smile of false assurance before curling up more against Jason and trying to go back to sleep. Maybe in the morning she could worry about it. Unfortunately with a young child, Julietta had to be up pretty soon. So, when she awoke to the sun filling her room, she gasped and jumped out of bed. Thomas nor Jason were with her in the bedroom. Changing out of her nightgown, Jules headed to the main area as she let out a sigh of relief to see Jason sitting with Thomas and playing with some lego bricks, each creating their own thing. Glancing at the sink, she noticed there were dishes in the rack that she had emptied before bed. So at least she knew that Thomas had been fed. Pattering over, she grabbed some fruit before walking to sit near the two. Julietta didn't bother talking as she watched them. Jules wanted to give Jason a lot of credit, he was good with Thomas after being kind of thrown into this. Although, Julietta wondered if that was because of him not having the greatest of childhoods and wanted to give his son a better one. \"Morning.\" Jason spoke as he looked at her. \"Sleep well?\" \"Yeah.\" Jules spoke although she was checking out worried in thoughts. Jason had noticed this but decided to let her process her thoughts. It's been a rough time lately. Later in the day, Jason took Jules and Thomas to the Wayne Manor, although Thomas immediately started napping on a couch near his mom with his head sprawled on Julietta's lap. Alfred gave her a cup of coffee which was always perfect. Taking a heavy sip, she began listening to the conversation. It was about monitoring Black Skull and his goonies. Eventually, Jules scooted out of her seat, tucking her sweater under Thomas' head. Claiming that she needed to use the bathroom. Instead of using one of the downstairs one, Jules headed towards the upstair bathroom ducking over to the study that she knew where Tim would be located if he was around. Instead she found Dick, which was surprise since she suspected that he would be in Bludhaven. Deciding Dick would work, Julietta knocked on the doorframe as Dick looked up. \"Jules, what's up?\" \"Dick, I want you to teach me to defend myself. Jason doesn't get to know.\" - Jules was paranoid the next few days as she made sure to take different routes every day, and did not risk things with Thomas; opting to having Jason come with her whenever Thomas was around. She hated being paranoid like this, but knew it was worth it. Especially when in front of her class stood her father. Julietta's stomach dropped as she saw him looking around for her but hadn't seen her as she ducked into the washroom beside her. Her palms were sweaty as she thought about the solid man out there with dark hair, tanned skin and the same hazel eyes as her own. Covering her mouth, Julietta hid in the stall as she closed her eyes. Although she really wanted to be in that class since it was her final day before the exam; Julietta couldn't bring herself to it. Sitting on the closed toilet seat, Julietta was cursing at herself internally. Even in a public setting like this, Jules could not be brave enough to go out anywhere near him. Sighing in defeat, Julietta knew if she stayed in the washroom, she would continue having a panic attack. Biting the bullet, Julietta shot out a text message to Jason, hoping he'd be awake. It was a simple. \"Hey I think I got what Tommy had. Could you meet me by the B Building of my school?\" Although it meant coming out of the washroom and risking being spotted to get to the stairwell that would go down right to where she needed to be. Her phone buzzed as Jules let out a sigh of relief. \"K. B there in 10.\" The next nine minutes dragged on as Jules stood by the door and took a deep breath. \"Come on Julietta. You were less scared of being around the Joker than this. You're safe at school.\" She told herself before holding her head up high and walking out. Feigning confidence on where she needed to go would help, Julietta hoped. She weaved through the people as she got to the stairwell and felt the breath she was holding come out. As she pushed through the door, Jules felt a strong arm grab hers. \"Now hold up.\" the deep voice spoke as Julietta bit her lip and froze. \"I heard you gave your uncle a poor welcome when he went to visit you.\" Julietta stayed silent as hot breath tickled her ear. \"That was mighty rude of you. I know, you remember what I said about manners to your family.\" Jules let out a gasp as she felt the hand tightening around her arm. She could feel her phone buzzing in her pocket, knowing that Jason was probably getting concerned. \"Let me go.\" Jules whispered out, her voice shaking with fear. \"Or I will scream.\" \"You wouldn't dare.\" her father spoke, his voice now getting laced with anger as Julietta immediately thought back to being a child and shaking from this. Thinking of how small she was, reminded her that she was just about Thomas' age when she remembered being afraid of her own father. Thinking of his son seem to motivate her as Julietta planted her feet. \"GET YOUR FUCKING HAND OFF OF ME.\" Julietta screeched out as she tried tugging her arm away as the nearby security officer ran over yelling at her father as he dropped her arm before walking away from her. Julietta took the time to run down the stairs, practically tripping in her haste to get down as she pushed open the outside doors and ran to Jason on his bike. She wiped her eyes, not realizing she had been crying until that moment as Jason looked at her. \"I don't want to talk, Jason take me home.\" Julietta said before Jason could say anything as he handed her a helmet. Julietta put it on as she took a seat behind Jason and hugged onto him. During the ride, Jules buried her face into his leather jacket as she let herself cry against his back. After they got back to the apartment, it took Jason nearly three hours to calm Julietta down enough so she would explain what happened, mostly since when Jason had drawn a bath for her, he could see the distinct hand shaped bruise on her arm. Then it had taken Julietta nearly an hour to calm Jason down from tracking her father down and murdering him. She could see the murderous intent in his eyes, she knew if Jules let him go, he would do it. Instead, Julietta had decided to report the incident to police by having Gordon sending an officer over that he trusted. This process could create a restraining order at least. The officer left to get camera footage from the school in the early afternoon, just as Jason and Jules headed to preschool. While they headed there, walking since it was not safe for a small child on a motorcycle nor did Jules have the car seat to take a taxi, Jason spoke. \"I think being your apartment isn't safe.\" \"Where would we go? A hotel? They have about the same amount of security of my apartment building.\" \"I was thinking of moving back in with Bruce.\" Jason responded as Julietta shook her head. \"No. I think this is too soon for something like that Jason. Yes they know my address, but the door is secure and they haven't gotten in.\" \"Yet.\" \"They won't.\" Jules pushed as Jason sighed. Julietta ran a hand through her hair as she took a moment to breathe. \"Let's just wait, okay?\" Jason glanced at her as he put his hand on her cheek. \"Okay but just know I want what's best for you and Tommy, okay? That's my priority.\" Jules put her hand on his as she smiled and leaned into it. \"I understand, Jay.\" ","Summary":" I hope you all enjoy this Jason Todd/OC story that will start out with some background before jumpi"},{"Movie":"Spy Kids","Title":"The Unordinary Spy Kid","Author":"FictionStoryLover","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9964768","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Please Note: Please remember that these are only if I'm bored to death so don't expect regular updates. Also the following content may cause nightmares. Not for readers under 6. I own all the characters of this content. Please Enjoy CHAPTER 1 From the time he woke up today he knew something was up. Of course, it was him, with his luck some relative died or worse his sister trashed his trophy case, AGAIN probably to mock him! Nothing was in it, but still that was so unfair. But no, this was Carter Kesh's luck, whatever he thought would happen that day it would be twice as bad. But today he knew he would remember, little did he know that today his life would change forever. Today was September 3 or as he called it THE DAY MY LIFE BEGINS TO END. Today was the first day of school. Carter is a seventh grader in Summerton Middle School but unlike the most kids in Summerton he is not so well admired. Unlike his sister may I add, Alisa Kesh who everyone adored. She was always the favorite. She was the one who always got the trophies, And off course like most brother/sister relationship he hated her. He was the least popular kid in his school. Out of 2,000 people everyone hated him. His sister the 2nd most popular kid in school next to Sabrina Skye. Wherever he went mischief followed. Carter is a 13-year-old with short, black hair, deep-sea green eyes, and a tall 5 foot 10, lean, skinny, muscular and athletic body. He was also a very smart. And yet even though of his peculiar physical and metal abilities everyone hated him. But before school he had a feeling today is going to be different. Why would that be, you might ask? Well, last night he had a dream. He was sprinting as fast as he could in the forest, the trees were flashing by him as he ran, ran for his life. He heard a high-pitched whine, like something was shredding itself with a blade. His feet felt limp and tired after running what seemed like miles. He wanted to disappear, disintegrate right there. Yet he kept running though now his feet changed course. He was heading towards where the terrible whine came from... The murderous scene petrified him. There, a dear's head lay on the ground. Red blood still oozing from its ear. 2 meters forward was the empty carcase of the dear's body. He wanted to run, but his legs would not work. He sprinted out of there. Running faster than he thought possible. Yet something in the shadows was moving faster still. Out of nowhere a wolf jumped out. It was not something he expected. Instead of the cute fluffy creature he expected a massive creature appeared before him blocking his path. There was nothing cute or fluffy about it. It was as tall as him. His powerful jaw hung open as drops of fresh blood hung to his sharp teeth. His dull, grey fur looked like it was attacked with a weadwhacker, and was smeared with fresh blood. At that moment he knew all hope was lost. Then a loud shot rang out from behind him, the bullet missing him by centimeters, but hitting the wolf. He woke up with a scream, the nightmare was over.[Chapter 2] Its me again. Hi and here I give you the second Chapter of The Unordinary Spy Kid Breathe, Breathe! Inhale, Exhale, in and out. Sabrina Skye was recovering from a nightmare. She had to get it together, today was the day before school, or 3 AM of September 3 and she being one of the most popular kids in school had she to be at peak performance. Sabrina is a tall 5 foot 6, 12-year-old (almost 13), with caramel brown hair, dark brown eyes, a smart and I know it type of attitude, and with a very athletic body. She and Alisa Kesh were best friends, and she decided to call her.\" Do you know what time it is?\" Alisa asked Sabrina almost yelling. \"Yes its 4 in the morning, I'm calling you for a reason!\" Sabrina snapped right back. \"Lets meet up now, it's very important.\" she said almost in a begging voice. Alisa has never seen her best friend like that, and she decided to sneak out, when they met up Sabrina told Alisa about her terrifying nightmare, which Alisa's brother was a part of, Alisa asked her if she and her brother had ever even met, She replied with a no. \"Weird, very, very, weird, just like my brother.\" Alisa said. Then, Alisa decided to tell Sabrina about her nightmare. They were almost identical. \"What are the chases that we would have the same dream, at the same night, at the same time?\" Alisa asked. \"NONE! Zero! Not Possible. Considering that we are two entirely different people!\" Sabrina answered. Sabrina saw an outburst of emotion cross Alisa's face. Surprise, confusion, what was that, love, hate? Alisa's gaze became blank, and her breathing slowed as her body tensed and relaxed, tensed and relaxed. She entered a Thoughtful, dreamlike state. Sabrina knew her friend well, and she has seen her like this before, she is concentrating to block everything out, as if putting every single thought,every single sound on mute, besides the one question she needed to find the answer to, what in hell is going on here? Sabrina wanted that question answered to. What is going on here? Why did they have the dream. No, the real question is why, and HOW did they have the same dream at the same time. It should be impossible. Something very strange is happening, something beyond them. The government maybe, maybe some super secret organization who knows, but this can't be a coincidence. This just can't be. \"Earth to Sabie! Anyone home?\" Alisa asked. Oh my God I am so sorry, I was caught up in my own thoughts, I didn't notice you were looking at me!\" Sabrina answered back. \"I'll go home now and ask my brother if he had that dream too.\" Alisa said. \"Why would that loser have the same dream.\" Sabrina exclaimed. Doesn't hurt to check, see you tomorrow. Alisa said and sprinted away.[Chapter 3] Dear readers, I thank you for your support and hope that you enjoy reading the Third chapter of The Unrdinary Spy Kid. Thank you for your time. The next day, Carter was walking around shaking, every sound made him jump. Every step was a toll taken from him. His hands shook violently as he walked to school. As he walked, he felt a hand, gripping his shoulder with force, he screamed and yelled, then powered away from whatever that touched him. \"Wait come back\" he heard a familiar voice yell. Alisa powered after him but was no mach for Carter. He was gaining ground fast, until he stopped. Alisa, not noticing he stopped focusing on catching up to him, crashed into him and they both fell to the ground in an unintended tackle. \"AAHH, what in hell are you doing, Alisa?\" her brother shouted at her. She was in such shock, her brother, her brother is yelling at her. Carter never ever yelled or screamed or lost his cool. Alisa on the other hand was always putting her brother down. \"He must be really nervous about something.\" she thought. \" I'm sorry, I wanted to talk on the way to school.\" Alisa replied to his yelling.\" About what?\" Carter asked already forgetting to be mad at her. Alisa told him about the dream she had. \" I had a dream as well, that's why I am so jumpy today.\" Carter said, almost whispering, as if deep in thought. He got up, and slowly started walking toward the school. Alisa followed him, listening carefully as he told his tale. He told her about the fright he felt, the deers body ripped open, about the wolf, and about the man in the helicopter shooting the wolf as it went for the kill. At last when he finished, Alisa told him about how she and Sabrina Skye had the same dream. \"At least your and Sabrina's dreams were like dreams, mine was more of a nightmare.\" Carter said in a voice Alisa didn't quite understand. She couldn't understand, not just the voice or the dream, but Carter himself, the situation Carter was in. She could not even begin to comprehend his life, his feelings. Then the ugly truth hit her, she barely new her brother. She spent so much time making fun of him, and pulling pranks on him, that she didn't even know whether he is sad of lonely, mad or exited. She never knew. \"Maybe he is not the loser I thought he was.\" Alisa thought. As they approached the school, carter felt a stab of real life. He still had school bullies and popular kids to worry about along with this mess. As they prepared to enter the school ground a military helicopter circled overhead began to slow down and soon hung in the air. The helicopter had an impressive arsenal of weapons attached to its hull. It had 3 mini-guns attached to the nose, and 2 chain-guns attached one one each side. The helicopter landed and the the door opened side ways revealing a man in his 30s. \"Oh dear god, Alisa that's the man from my nightmare.\" Carter said.[Chapter 4] Hello again, and here I give you the fourth chapter of the Unordinary Spy Kid. \"What are you doing here, Sabrina?!\" exclaimed Carter, making her feel a bit uncomfortable. She was, after all, being yelled at by a kid she had never seen before, and yet he was acting as if they were old friends. She sat there, in the chopper, quietly, afraid any noise would be her death sentence. Carter soon found out why. Alisa sat down next to Sabrina, following her example and being as quite as a mouse. \"Sit down and shut up, kid.\" a brutal voice ordered. Carter also heard a small hint of a Russian accent in the voice. Even though the man yelled at him, Carter just stood there. \"Who in hell are you? What gives you the right to take us, to yell at us. I better see some ID.\" Carter barked, trying to keep his voice as equally brutal as the man's. The man grinned, then smiled, then started giggling. Soon the giggle turned in to a heavy laugh, though not the friendly type. The type bullies laughed when they were making fun of you.\"He is mocking me!\" Carter realized. \"Listen up, kid. I have 2 Desert Eagles on my belt. I got a P90 on my back, and a Sly 2000 in my hands. That IS my ID. In case you haven't noticed you're in a military grade chopper, and the girls are sitting on cases of C4. Now shut up and sit down. The orders to bring you in come all the way from the top, and that's what I'm gonna do. Is that understood?!\" the man yelled. Then the pilot called out\"Hey Bruce Lee, stop bugging the kid.\" the Russian accent evident in his voice. \"Dimitry!\" the man said, warning in his eyes.\"He's trigger-happy!' Carter realized. The helicopter took on as the pilot and the man exchanged words. The flight took hours, he got 4 calls from his mother, and off course Alisa got 7. The man warned them not to answer. As they flew he took his opportunity to talk to Sabrina and Alisa, mostly Sabrina though. Even though she was way, way, way out of his league, he was still magnetized to her, she had that effect on guys. The man he came to know as Alexander just watched silently, amusement in his eyes. Finally, the flight was over and the pilot got up and stretched, muscles rippling. \"wow\"he must work out.\" Carter thought. Dimitry(the pilot) stepped outside and instructed them to do the same. The man, Alexander stopped him. \"Wait!\" he commanded. The voice had power, Carter stopped, dead in his tracks. \"What?\" he asked. \"I saw you hitting on the girl.\" \"Alisa is my sister!\" he said embarrassed understanding he didn't mean Alisa.\"I mean the other one, Sabrina I think. You know who I mean. I figured I could give you some advice. The place where your going, well, lets just say there is a lot of opportunities to impress her.\" Alexander said. \"Thanks! And I do know who you mean.\" Carter said. \"Relax kid, there is no shame in admitting your crush. Cause were I your age I'd be crushing too. Who is she by the way? asked Alexander. \"She's the most popular girl in school, and I, well you're looking at the biggest loser in Summerton. There is no possible way to get her to like me soooooo...\" Carter continued. Alexander was about to say something but Dimitry yells to get Carter to go over there. Alexander follows. Attention, kids, what your about to see, is classified beyond TOP SECRET.\" said Alexander. \"But we are in the middle of no wh...\" Alisa said, being cut off by the view as a magnificent city is reveled from a cloaking field. \"You are being offered a job as a Spy Kid of the most advanced level their is.\" Then, at that moment, two words rang out, loud and clear, it seemed like the planet it self has stopped spinning, everything frozen in place. \" I ACCEPT!\" ","Summary":" Please Note: Please remember that these are only if I'm bored to death so don't expect regular upda"},{"Movie":"Top Gun","Title":"Mavericks baby girl","Author":"IamTheBlaze","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7492532","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Iceman was convinced it was Maverick's fault. He just knew Maverick had left the stove on and gone for a leisurely walk, or tried to stop a fire by throwing vodka on it, but no, everyone said it had been an electrical fire and not his fault at all and had been fawning over him ever since. \"Oh, poor Mitchell, that's too bad, let's make him and that cute baby sister of his a casserole.\" Fuck, thought Iceman, if you got this much attention for burning your own house down, he wasn't sure why more people didn't try it. But then someone had volunteered Iceman to take him in. Viper told him it was because he was the most responsible student at the academy, and probably the most hospitable and besides Maverick was looking after fourteen year old Phoenix and she couldn't stay just anywhere on base, and Iceman had bit his lip the entire time to stop from screaming out \" BULLSHIT !\" at the top of his lungs. This was some crack-pot plan to get Iceman and Maverick to play nice, and everyone knew it. Iceman wouldn't even be surprised to find out that Viper had set the fire himself, stuck a fork in one of Maverick's electrical sockets or something. Hollywood had adopted all of it as his current pet conspiracy theory. Last month he had been obsessed with the JFK assassination, and now he had taken to popping out from behind corners questioning Maverick and Phoenix about the validity of the situation. Finally Maverick had cracked and punched Hollywood square in the nose. Iceman would never admit it to anyone, but he was kind of impressed. Conversely, he was absolutely horrified by living with Maverick. Over the last few weeks Maverick had said to him an entire host of nasty things, including \"you uptight OCD pussy bitch\" and \"it's no wonder you don't have a girlfriend, she would kill herself five seconds after you asked her to move in\" Jess however was nicer and always tried to follow Iceman's rules and compliment him on his house and hospitality. But how was Iceman supposed to react when Maverick used the hand towels from the front bathroom to wipe his shoes , and walked around the house wearing only dog tags and boxers, and used Iceman's toothbrush without telling him ? Really, what the hell ? It was the coup de grâce when Iceman returned home one evening to find Maverick having sex on his couch. The girl looked to be about twenty, with blonde hair that was tangled with sweat. She occasionally let out a noise as Maverick thrusted on her. Iceman stood in the doorway and watched, kissing his anger goodbye. It wasn't going to help him here. He needed a plan. Maverick finally noticed him, gave a yelp of alarm, and sat bolt upright. The girl sat up too, saw Iceman, and screamed at an ungodly pitch. \"Afternoon, Mitchell,\" Iceman drawled, looking straight at him. \"Uh, Katie,\" Maverick said, handing her his shirt while keeping his eyes on Iceman, \"maybe you should go...\" She grabbed it from him and dashed out of the room. Maverick pulled his boxers on. The little strip of hair along his lower stomach, leading toward his crotch, was still visible. \"So, Kazanski,\" Maverick said. \"Is this what you wanted?\" \"Actually, no,\" Iceman said. \"No, you wanted my balls,\" Maverick snapped, \"and now you have them. So, what? Are you kicking me and Jess out?\" \"Shut up, Mitchell, I'm trying to think.\" \" What ?\" And then it came to him. \"One-on-one hop,\" Iceman said shortly. \"Bring your RIO, I'll bring mine. Whoever gets gunned down first has to do whatever the other wants.\" \"What do you want?\" \"You'll find out.\" Maverick glared at him. \"Fine. And if I win, I get to do what the fuck I want without you getting your panties in a wad.\" Iceman rolled his eyes. \"Unlikely, Mitchell,\" he said, turning around and leaving the living room before Maverick could react. \"He thinks he's going to win,\" Iceman said dismissively, looking over at Maverick as he and Slider readied their jet. \"And we know we're going to win,\" Slider told him. \"Forget about it. This look okay to you?\" \"Its fine,\" Iceman told him, climbing into the cockpit. \"Yeah, we should be good,\" he said, tugging at a cable. \"How'd you get clearance for a solo hop, anyway?\" Slider said, sounding impressed. \"My superiors love me,\" Ice said, sliding his helmet on. \"Instruments and gauges fully functional,\" he said. He clicked on the comm. \"You up for this, Mitchell?\" \"Just do it, Kazanski,\" Maverick snapped, sounding fidgety and wired. Jess looked at them both down on the tarmac she had a bad feeling about this. As much as she pretended not to like Ice she knew that she loved and if either he or Mav went down today she would horrified as much as she hated to admit it Ice was like a responsible older brother whereas Mav was the fun reckless one. Regardless of her feelings they were up within a few minutes. \"You see him?\" Slider said. \"No,\" replied Iceman. \"Don't worry about it, he'll come.\" All of a sudden Maverick's plane went into a spectacular dive in front of them. Iceman turned in the air to get a better angle. \"What do you think he's trying to do?\" Slider said, sounding nervous. \"Shut up,\" Iceman said, and it wasn't mean, just sharp. He waited. \"He's got tone on us, Ice!\" Iceman pulled up and burst away from Maverick, supersonic. He turned again and fingered the controls. \"What are you doing ?\" \"He has to come to us,\" Iceman murmured. \"Getting worried, Kazanski?\" crackled Maverick's voice in his ear. \"Why, Mitchell, are you?\" \"Hell no,\" Maverick said, but his voice cracked. It was something most could barely hear, but Iceman heard everything. He grinned and crept forward. There was Maverick, a sitting duck in the middle of the canyon. \"Shit,\" Iceman heard Goose say. \"Ice,\" Slider said warningly. The way Iceman's plane moved forward, it was like a snake, a calculated moment of pure force. It was over before either of them knew what happened, Iceman had missile lock on him, had fired, and Maverick was swearing over the comm. Back on the ground, Maverick stormed off. Iceman watched him go, knowing where he was headed. In the tower Jess just watched them her mouth gaping \"Nice job,\" Iceman told Slider, and set forth to follow. Up in the tower Jess watched both boys enter the heading home through her binoculars sighed pulled of her headphones grabbed Mavericks motorbike keys and followed.[Chapter 2] Iceman closed the front door behind him and stepped into silence. \"Mitchell,\" he said, the two syllables lazy and impassive. Maverick appeared, approached Iceman in the foyer and leaned on the wall with his shoulder. \"You won,\" Maverick said. Iceman was quiet for a moment. He stepped a bit closer to Maverick. \"I've been thinking, Maverick,\" he said, \"About what I want you to do.\" He stepped even closer. Maverick's breathing quickened. Iceman put a hand on the wall beside Maverick, blocking his exit. \"I was going to tell you to straighten up your act and stop, for instance, bringing girls into my house and nailing them on my sofa, but that's not what you need.\" Neither man noticed Jessica sneaking silently into the house and edging down to the foyer. They were extremely close now. Maverick's nipples were clearly erect under his shirt. \"What you need,\" said Iceman quietly, \"is to be taken down a notch, Mitchell.\" Maverick's pupils were blown; he was looking up at Iceman doe-eyed with a mix of apprehension and hunger. \"You want it too,\" Iceman added softly. Transfixed Jess's mouth dropped open and no matter how much she wanted to move she was fixed to the spot. Iceman and Maverick carried on oblivious to her presence. Maverick straightened up defiantly. \"I don't want anything from you, Kazanski,\" he hissed. \"Not even this?\" Iceman said, sliding his hand against Maverick's ass, fingers dragging against soft flesh underneath denim. Maverick gasped involuntarily, falling against Iceman slightly; Iceman caught him and pushed him into the living room. \"You like feeling out of control, right, Mitchell?\" Iceman whispered in his ear. \"Even if it means you don't come out on top ...\" \"What are you going to do?\" Maverick whispered. \"What I want,\" Iceman said. He shoved Maverick against the sofa, already hard against him. \"Comfortable?\" \"Yes,\" Maverick breathed, pressing back against Iceman's crotch, leaving no atom of space between them, their twin scents of sweat lingering in the air. Iceman's fingers swept across Maverick's crotch, teasing his fly. Maverick was quivering with tension beneath him. Iceman felt a swell of quiet power rise inside him. He bit down on his lip, drawing blood, staying inside the moment. This had to be carefully, almost artfully done, if he wanted to fully make his point. He didn't bother undoing the top button, just grazed his finger inside the hole and it undid itself from the building pressure against the fly. Ice tugged at the zipper gently, with an excruciatingly slowness. He wondered if Maverick would beg if he kept this up, but Maverick said nothing, just pressed himself as deeply against Iceman as he could, back muscles rippling under his shirt. Iceman hooked his thumb in Maverick's belt loops and pulled his jeans down just a bit. He ran a finger against the exposed flesh. Maverick's breath hitched. The quivering had become a tremble; an explosive, kinetic energy underneath Iceman's fingers to do with as he wished. He slid the jeans down a little further. Maverick's legs spread slightly on his touch. \" Tom ,\" Maverick burst out, like he was swearing. \"Yeah,\" Iceman replied, as he slid into Maverick, his voice even and controlled. Maverick clenched the fabric of the couch in white-knuckled fists and rocked back against Iceman. Iceman moved forward and trapped Maverick between himself and the arm of the couch as he thrusted, pinning him. The heat was incredible, a tangible force as Iceman moved inside him, like the core of the earth expanding and exploding, coal bursting into diamonds. Maverick screamed, and fuck , he had a set of lungs on him, the sound itself making Iceman feel as if his carefully composed exterior were about to crack. \"Jesus,\" Iceman said aloud as he came, the s lingering in his throat, and then, \"Mitchell,\" softer, resting his hands on Maverick's hips. Maverick had come before him and was elbows-down on the arm of the couch now, no longer trembling, pressed up against Iceman needily. His pulse jack-hammered underneath Iceman's fingertips as he slid one finger over his neck, then leaned down and kissed him there, underneath the earlobe, beside the jawbone that shifted as Maverick ground his teeth together. \"Had enough, Mitchell?\" Iceman said quietly. \"Yes,\" Maverick replied. His voice cracked on the lone syllable. Iceman silently went into the bathroom, turned the faucet to hot and wet a towel. He cleaned himself off, returned to Maverick and handed it to him. Maverick wiped the come off his stomach and laid down on the couch cat-like, curled up. Iceman knelt in front of him. Their eyes locked, green on blue Months of unspoken longing, insecurities and resentment passed between them and drew Iceman's lips to Maverick's. Their kiss however was interrupted by a quiet gasp from the entrance to the lounge room. Both men broke up to see Jess standing their looking at them silent tears pouring down her face. For a millisecond he wondered how much his poor poor baby sister had seen but as their iridescent blue eyes met he knew that she had witnessed it all. Her lips made out the shape of his name as she turned and ran out of the house. As Jess ran the only thought running through her mind was that she had to get away, her mind barely registered both men calling after her as she remembered Mavericks keys in her pocket. Still sobbing she heaved herself onto the bike and sped away.[Chapter 3] Maverick breathed feeling his baby sister's pain as well as his own. It took all his might not to crawl onto the couch and cry. Instead her pulled up his jeans and thanked god for the fact that Ice himself had a super speed Kawasaki motorbike. Grabbing Ice keys from his room barley aware of Iceman shouting at him he opened the garage door and sped out. He knew that there was only one place that his sister would head when she was upset and he knew that it was the type of place where she knew that only he would think to look. Easing of the throttle he walked down to helicopter pad and flew down to the aircraft carrier that was floating in the middle of the pacific sea. Unsurprisingly he got a dirty look from almost all of the staff especially the female's and the lieutenants that where fathers. Ignoring them he walked down to Commanding Officer Stinger's office. He took a deep breath and knocked. A few moments later Stinger yelled \"Get in here Maverick,\" He entered the room to find Jess passed out in a chair fast asleep and Stinger at his desk doing his paperwork. Maverick stooped in front of the desk standing to attention breathing a sigh of relief that Jess was safe. \"Are you going to tell me what happened up there?\" Stinger asked without looking up from his paperwork. \"Has Jess told you?\" \"No she got in here crying and collapsed in that chair.\" \"Then Sir it is not my place to explain,\" \"I knew you'd say that I'm giving you both two days off from top gun Goose will be joining you on the second day the first day however is for Phoenix to rest and recover,\" \"Yes sir,\" Maverick said. \"Good now take her up to the infirmary and Maverick even the best of siblings have their days I'm sure Jess doesn't blame you for whatever happened.\" \"Thankyou sir,\" Maverick said picking up his sister in his arms and walking her through the ship to the infirmary where he placed in a bed and collapsed on the one beside her. It had been an excruciatingly long day. The next morning Jess awoke feeling snug and well rested she contemplated rolling over and going back to sleep. But as the events of the previous day came flooding back to her she knew she was done for. In the bed next to her Maverick groaned and began muttering in his sleep the way he did when he was upset. The only words she caught where Jess, love, bet, Ice and rape. Quietly fuming Jess picked up the phone that was placed on her bedside table and called Goose after a quick conversation they both said their goodbyes and hung up. Quietly Jess made another two calls. Feeling like there was nothing she could do but wait, Jess rolled over to catch another few hours' sleep. She felt herself being gently shaken awake and opened her eyes to see Goose in front of her with three bags of cinnamon rolls in his hand. \"Morning beautiful I got breakfast,\" \"Mother Goose you always think of everything,\" Jess said as she sat up and wrapped her arms around his shoulders terrified she would start crying again. Sensing her distress Goose rubbed her back in soothing circles holding her against him. \"You seem like you've been in shock, what's been happening? Especially between you and Mav,\" \"that's for Mav to tell you, but there was a breach of trust a major breach of trust by Ice and hell Mav didn't fight it or stick up for me or even think about what the consequences would be for me.\" Goose climbed up next to her in bed handed her a cinnamon roll and said \"baby just keep in mind what Mavericks like and what his job is. Pilots have to think of a hundred different things at the same time while their flying and I know for a fact that even when he's up there he's always thinking of you hell he has a picture of you and him cuddling tacked up on the dash of the plane. Mav thinks of you were ever he goes so what makes you think this time would be any different. And we both know that Mav is a self-centred prick who tends to put himself first all the time. But you know something I've been Mav's RIO a long, long time and I know that you are always at the root of Mav's actions I mean whether it's a flyby of a tower to impress you or a date which isn't about sex is about finding you some female guidance. Sighing Jess looked over at her sleeping brothers form and said \"I hate it when you're right Goose,\" \"Are you going to be okay on your own for a little while they'll kill me if they find me off Top Gun base without permission, so I'd best go and inform Stinger of my presence.\" Jess laughed and said \"Knowing Stinger you'll be back on base before afternoon drills.\" Now it was Goose's turn to laugh as he pulled her close kissed her forehead whispering \"You're a good kid Jessie,\" into her hair and left. A few moments later Maverick began to stir, and soon was sitting up. \"Morning Mav,\" Jess said walking over to his bed passing him a cinnamon roll and snuggling up next to him. \"Morning Phoen, how'd you get these if I'm not mistaken we are on an aircraft carrier in the middle of the sea.\" \"No you are not mistaken but mother Goose thought we might be hungry.\" \"Goose's here already?\" \"I called him,\" \"Oh alright then,\" Maverick tore into the cinnamon roll and Jess waited until he had finished eating until she began. \"Maverick about yesterday,\" \"Yeah?\" Maverick asked uncertainly \"I might have overreacted a little strongly by flying here.\" \"No you acted the way I knew you would. You went to a place where you felt safe, happy and barely any bad things happen, Phoen honey you acted the way any other fourteen year old kid was going to act when they came home and watched their brother being raped by a person she thought she could trust and their brother didn't try and stop the act either. You may be the world's youngest military personnel and best young naval aviator but Jess your still a fourteen year old girl and no-matter how mature you other sometimes your still going to act like one.\" \"Mav can I ask why you didn't try to stop Ice?\" \"Because I lost a bet and he could do whatever he wanted to me,\" \"Oh Maverick I know you don't want to answer this but did you enjoy kissing Iceman?\" \"The last kiss at the end well, I was in a deeply unbalanced emotional state baby, I don't think I knew what I was feeling.\" \"I don't mind if you and Ice get together Mav I really don't but just give me a heads up okay?\" \"Okay,\" \"Hey Mav you thinking what I'm thinking?' \"Yes I'm thinking what you're thinking, I feel the need,\" \"The need,\" \"For Speed,\" The crowed together Maverick grabbed his little sister and pulled her close kissing the top of her head. \"I will always love you Jess no-matter what,\" \"You're the best Mav,\" Jess replied the sat there for a moment in each other's arms before the ran straight for the locker rooms racing each other as they got changed into their jump suites and out to their planes. Jess laughed as they ran past a dumbfounded Goose and Viper she called out. \"Hurry up Goose the planes won't wait forever your suites in the locker rooms,\" Maverick called out the same message as they ran past Jess's old RIO Angel, who tore down to the change rooms like she was on fire. As they reached the deck Jess and Mav ran over to their planes up the ladders and sat in them looking like to kids in a candy store. Jess laughed as Angel an over her black hair streaming out behind her carrying her own and Jess's helmets. \"So long Maverick! Looks like Goose couldn't find your helmets I'll see you up their big brother.\" They all knew that a flight without authorization would be over if the ground crew found out. So as Angel climbed in and buckled up Jess closed the hatch and the ground crew made all the preps soon Jess floored it to the F14's maximum possible speed they were up, up and away. The hadn't been up there for long before Maverick and Goose joined them. \"Hey Mav,\" Jess called over the hand held radio, \"What?\" Maverick replied as they flew line in line \"I'm a yell at Ice when we get home!\" She heard Maverick and Goose laugh and she could have sworn she heard Maverick say \"Good,\" \"You two really are cowboys.\" Came a voice from over the com she heard Goose say \"Holy shit its Iceman,\" Laughing she replied \"Goose he's probably up here saying, Holy shit it's Maverick, Phoenix, Goose and Angel.\" \"What's your problem, Kazanski?\" Maverick asked \"Can't we go for a family flight without you bothering us?\" Jess swore as Iceman pulled up in the middle of them and smiled at her. \"You just wait Kazanski when we get down their I'm going to kick your but into next week.\" \"Sure thing sweetheart careful though your brother might get a little mad.\" Iceman taunted \"Hey Goose whose ass did you guys kiss to get away from Top Gun and up in the air?\" Slider asked, \"The list is long and distinguished,\" Goose replied \"Yeah and so is my Johnson,\" Slider Laughed \"Mav, Goose are you thinking what I'm thinking\" Jess asked, \"Yep photo time,\" Maverick responded as Goose crowed \"Great Balls of fire!\" Jess laughed as the Com buzzed with voices from the base and Ghost rider called \"This is Ghost rider sector 90903 requesting all pilots head back to base immediately,\" \"This is Phoenix requesting to talk to CO Stinger,\" Jess called back the smirk she was wearing so evident in her voice Maverick laughed. \"Phoenix, Maverick, Iceman get your buts back to base NOW!\" Stinger thundered \"Nope not sure I feel like going back to base do you Mav?\" \"Nope\" Maverick replied as Goose said \"Mav,\" \"Phoen,\" Angel cautioned \"Phoenix Mitchell, Maverick Mitchell you haven't got permission to be up there so help me,\" \"Hey neither does Ice and anyway we do have permission to be up here,\" \"Yeah from who?\" Stinger questioned taking the bait \"You and the Doc, You guys said Rest and Relaxation I've done rest and this is relaxation plus family bonding and anger management. See how good my multitasking's gotten?' Jess asked as Maverick laughed \"How's this Anger management?\" Maverick asked curiously \"Cause their loaded with blanks lets Photo op this Mav,\" \"Alrighty then I'll get visual ID and you hook him,\" Maverick joked as they swooped out to better see what Iceman was planning. \"And I'll clean him and fry him,\" Goose joked \"Alright Phoen you know the drill. Break hard right and engage. I'm on my way\" Maverick said \"If we can't shoot this guy then we can at least have a little fun with him\" I heard Maverick laugh. I watched as they soared into an inverted v just above our enemy. \"Is this your idea of fun Mav?\" I heard Goose ask knowing full well that he was getting sick from being upside down. I watched above us as Maverick smirked giving Iceman and Slider the middle finger. \"Greetings!\" Maverick laughed. \"Watch the birdie!\" goose instructed as he snapped a photo of the surprised looks of the enemy. \"Gee, I crack myself up!\" Maverick continued to laugh. \"This is a great shot Mav! I should be a photographer\" Goose crowed. Jess laughed and put gun lock on Iceman \"Jess what are you doing?\" Angel called \"we can't shoot him out of the sky he's on our side in one of our planes!\" \"He was on our side.\" Jess mumbled as Iceman stayed incredibly still knowing she wouldn't shoot. \"Jess put the guns away there not toys, fly home and let the big boys play,\" Iceman said calmly \"That does it Kazanski you're in for it now.\" \"Yeah right what are you going to do throw your Barbie's at us?\" \"No Kazanski ima shoot you out of the goddam sky,\" \"Phoenix this is Mustang,\" rang out the voice of stinger \"Stand down Phoenix I repeat stand down and come back to base.\" \"Like hell I am!\" Jess called as pressed the red button that released a spray of bullets or in Jess's case blanks that sounded like the real thing as Maverick and Goose sat above taking pictures. Knowing that Goose should be getting sick around now she stopped the spray. \"Get any good pictures Goose?\" Jess called over the com \"Yeah Iceman and Slider where shitting their pants they seriously thought you'd blow them out of the sky.\" They all continued Laughing as Jess called to Maverick as he slipped out of the inverted V \"Hey Mav sweetie lets go home.\" \"Rodger that Phoen, lets head home,\" Nobody stopped laughing and as they almost hit the aircraft carrier Mav called \"Ladies first,\" \"Then why aren't you going?\" Jess asked. \"Ha, ha,\" Maverick said \"now get going before I blow you out of the sky!\" Chuckling Jess called the ball and did a smooth landing Maverick and Iceman not far behind as she jumped down from the plane she rushed over to Maverick and he hugged her still laughing until a worker came down to see them all and said Stinger wanted them all except Angel in his office now,\" Jess grabbed Gooses hand as Maverick put his arm protectively around her shoulders. Still laughing they walked out to stingers oak door but the look on everybody's face that they past was enough to wipe the smiles of their faces. Using the hand that Jess wasn't holding Goose knocked on the door.[Chapter 4] \"Maverick, Phoenix, Goose get in here,\" Their CO sounded furious and Jess bet she knew why she tried to resist the temptation to cower into Maverick so she only hid in his chest a little as they walked in. With Jess holding Goose's hand and Mavericks arm around her shoulders they tried to stand to attention as best they could. Jess was surprised to find Iceman and Slider already in there and shot Ice a dirty look. \"What the hell happened out there?\" Stinger asked looking directly at Jess. \"Well Mav, Goose and I decided to go for a family fly when some dickhead decided to join us in the sky.\" She nodded over in ice direction \"He played dirty and that son of a bitch cut me off a few times before I remembered that these where the combat exercise planes so they would have blanks loaded in them ready for tomorrow. So we did our special photo maneuver and I shot the blanks at them. And now I'm not even half tempted to slap him let alone kill him. Stinger growled. And turned to Maverick and Goose \"Is that what you to say happened?\" \"Yes Sir.\" They responded in unison. \"What about you to.\" \"Take out her adjectives about us and that's pretty much what happened.\" Iceman said as Slider nodded \"Are you going to tell me why you were so upset yesterday and collapsed in my chair?\" Stinger asked turning to Jess \"Nope,\" \"What about you four?\" \"No Sir,\" \"Alright dismissed and don't let me hear about anything else like this happening ever again you hear me ever again.\" \"Yes sir,\" they chorused. And left the room. In the hallway Maverick began laughing \"You should have seen your face Kazanski, you sure your panties are still clean,\" \"I'll take you up there again for the same price as last time,\" \"I would but I don't think Phoenix would be able to stand the shock. \"Poor baby,\" Iceman cooed as Jess walked up and slapped him \"I thought I could trust you Kazanski you were like a brother to me a responsible guardian the Ying to my Mavericks Yan but no you had to go and do something like that and let me see it. That Iceman is just perverted.\" Jess stalked away arm in arm with Maverick and Goose. \"Have you got it all out of your system yet Jess?\" Maverick asked \"Almost, all he needs to do now is apologize and I'm willing to let this all go.\" \"I'll go tell him that then,' \"Don't you dare Maverick Mitchell, he needs to come to that conclusion by himself, you both got that,\" \"Yes Mam,\" They chorused happily \"Oh shut up you two, want to go get some ice cream?\" \"Great balls of fire I do!\" Goose exclaimed making Jess and Maverick chuckle. \"It's on me because this weekend my little pumpkin is all out you.\" Maverick said tapping her on the nose \"Pumpkin?\" she asked doing a double take you did not just seriously call me Pumpkin,\" \"How about sweetie pie?\" Maverick asked they carried on like this the whole way to the ice-cream parlor with Goose shaking his head behind them. As the three of them sat down to hot fudge Sunday's the guy behind the counter ever so casually started to chat her up. \"Back of mister the lady's mine,\" Maverick called flexing his muscles so the rolled beneath his tight white t-shirt and wrapping his arms around her kissing her cheek. Shaking slightly the boy went off to serve some other couples as Jess said \"Seriously? You did not just seriously scare of one of the cutest boy's I have ever seen.\" \"That there is precisely why I scared him off.' Maverick replied as Goose laughed and said \"Where to now my fair lady,\" \"How's about we go and mix it up at the officers bar my boy's\" \"Yeah Ha great balls of fire,\" the all crowed together scoring weird looks from everybody in the parlor. Laughing the all walked out of the base and down to where they had parked the bikes the night before. \"Give me five seconds Mav,\" Jess said flipping out her cellphone and pressing the call button. \"Sir it is my sorrow but possibly your delight to inform you that Goose Maverick and I will be moving back to Miramar We'll see you again when we have the top gun trophy love you Phoenix,\" there was a bit of shouting from the other end of the line and the it went dead. Jess hung up and turned to Maverick \"he said you'd better take bloody better care of me this time or were all moving back to sea where he can keep an eye on us, so Mav baby don't screw this up.\" \"Yes Mam,\" Mav crowed, \"let's do this people,\" Jess said as she swung up behind Maverick on the bike her arms tightly would around his stomach as Mav threw Goose the keys for Iceman's bike. Breaking almost a hundred law's and having at least three near death experiences they pulled up in front of Iceman's house where Maverick and Goose wheeled the bikes in as Jess ran upstairs and hopped in the shower swearing as she nicked her knee with her razor finishing her shower and toweling dry she called out \"MAVERICK!\" a few seconds later he was in the bathroom soaking wet himself and a towel loosely wrapped around his midriff \"What's wrong sweetie,\" he asked concerned \"I cut myself shaving,\" \"Is that it I interrupted my shower dashed to your room with shampoo still in my hair so you could tell me you cut yourself shaving?\" \"Yeah will you fix it for me?\" \"Yeah you did your hair yet?\" \"Nope,\" \"Come on,\" \"Ha we haven't had a shower together since I was little.\" \"I think these last weeks have earned it.\" Jess closed her eyes as Maverick gently washed her hair and conditioned it perfectly. Then Maverick knelt down and she washed the shampoo out of his hair and conditioned it for him. After they were both done they toweled of and Maverick gently put antiseptic cream and a band aid on her cut and kissed it better they change into their white Navy uniforms and headed downstairs where a freshly showered Goose waited for them. \"Let's go boys!\" Jess called jumping with Maverick on his bike whilst Goose took Iceman's. As they sat down at the bar Maverick said \"This is what I call a target-rich environment. \"You live your life between your legs, Mav.\" Replied Goose rolling his eyes \"Goose, even you could get laid in a place like this.\" \"Hell, I'd be happy to just find a girl that would talk dirty to me.\" After the boy's little eye fest a blonde lady that could only be described as a play boy bunny saddled up to her brother and began chatting him up as Maverick immediately responded Jess laughed and said to Goose \"he's lost that loving feeling. \" \"She's lo... No he hasn't. \" Goose replied \"Yes, he has.\" \"He's not lost that lo...\" \"Goose, he's lost it, man. \" \"Come on! Aw sh... I hate it when she does that.\" Jess plugged in a mike walked over to Mav and started singing you've lost that loving feeling soon the whole bar was singing it to Maverick as Jess laughed and when they finished the song Jess wrapped her arms around Maverick and said to the startled blonde \"He's mine.\" \"Seriously Phoenix? You did not just seriously scare of one of the hottest chicks I have ever seen.\" \"That there is precisely why I scared her off.' Jess replied as Goose laughed and turned away to chat to the brunette that was tending the bar. They then turned on Goose as Jess stood on the bar and Maverick draped his arms around Goose and fondled his cheek \"Hey Goose you big hunk!\" Jess called sensing what she was doing \"That's me, sugar.\" Goose replied \"Who would you rather take to bed me or Mav?\" \"I'll take Maverick,' Goose replied holding Mavericks hands against his face The brunette tending the bar walked away without another word looking freaked. Goose reached up and pulled her down from the bar tickling her so she squealed as she was held down by Maverick. \"You are a little terror.\" Goose told her in between tickles \"a real terror,\" \"Thank you,\" Jess managed to squeal. Everybody stopped as Iceman and Slider walked in and straight towards them. The boys let go and Jess sat up straightening her uniform. \"Still messing around like a baby I see Jessica,\" \"First of all the name's Phoenix Thomas and second life's all about shits and giggles not that you'd know.\" This bought a few whistles and some applause from the silent bar whilst Iceman blushed. \"Lost your cool Iceman? Perhaps we should call you blushman instead.\" \"When you're finished in the sandbox,\" \"Touchy aren't we.\" \"Shall we step outside and talk?\" Iceman asked as Slider said \"I got the number of that girl you were talking to before Maverick the one in the red dress.\" Whilst Jess pushed herself up onto the bar and sniffed the air and said \"Slider,\" another sniff \"you stink,\" As there was another round of cat calls and jeering Jess took a bow. \"Alright Ice we can talk just be careful though I'm so hot you could melt.\" They walked outside amidst the catcalls and jeering as soon as they had turned the corner she said \"What Ice,\" \"I just wanted to apologize for what I did to you and Ice's teeth came together with an audible snap Maverick it was wrong of me, Jess, Phoen you've been like a sister to me ever since I met you and I feel terrible about you witnessing what you did in general and let alone with your two brother being the ones to do it. You're a bright girl and no matter what qualms I have with Maverick you're my girl and I want to help him with raising you right. Help me help him. Please\" Tears were silently falling down Iceman's face. \"Never Ever do anything and I mean anything like that again Ice, I don't think I could cope.\" 'I'm sorry I really truly from the bottom of my heart sorry, please say you will forgive me.\" \"It's alright I forgive you Ice.\" She felt herself being pulled into his arms and held against his chest that was racked with sobs. \"Hey its okay Ice were okay Ice.\" I know it's just I love you Jess these past couple of day's I couldn't stand how mad you were at me.\" \"But I'm not mad any more, and I love you to Ice that's why I was so mad because I loved you so much and I though how could you do this to me.\" \"Come on lets go inside he said pulling her close one last time.\" Jess walked in to find Goose playing Great Balls of fire on the piano whilst Mav tried to chat up beautiful women. Jess watched paralyzed as Iceman walked over to Maverick and grabbed him by the shoulder and said \"you have a beautiful sister here or should I say we, you can stay in my house for as long as you like providing it is what Jess wants.\" \"Of course,\" Maverick said and turned to Jess \"you made up with him didn't you,\" she nodded \"and staying with him all four of us like a family is what you want.\" Jess nodded again \"alright then,\" Mav said offering his hand out to Ice \"it seems we have and accord.\" \"Now if you'll excuse me I believe I will go embarrass myself with Goose.\" Jess laughed as she watched her brother and Goose singing great balls of fire at the piano. She laughter harder as she watched Ice and Slider cracking jokes with the other pilots and knew that they were all her freaky large family. Jess stiffened feeling hand covering her eyes as a voice whispered, \"Guess who?\" \"Goose,\" Jess exclaimed drawing his name out into three syllables. As he laughed lifting his hands from her eyes. \"Hey how's about we go and fill the bikes up with gas and give them a polish to tell Ice and Mav where sorry for stealing them cause then they can't punish us?\" \"How's Ice going to punish you?\" \"Well technically riding on a stolen bike is a felony and by punishing you he's punishing me,\" \"That's sweet Goosey,\" \"Don't tell anyone, come on lets go,\" He said as he grabbed her hand and pulled her out the door. Together they rode the bikes around the streets of the base. Stopping only at the gas station where Jess paid whilst Goose filled them up. When they got home they cleaned the bikes down in record time and as Jess turned to go inside she felt a wet soppy sponge hit the back of her hair, \"Goose you are so dead!\" Jessica yelled throwing both sponges at him. He dodged the first but the second hit him smack bang in the middle of his face he looked so funny Jess started laughing. \"That's it Phoenix, you're going down.\" The started a sponge war that only ended when Goose threw the bucket of soapy water over her head. Smiling Jess refilled the bucket and threw it over goose. Laughing Goose pulled her down into a wet hug on the grass. \"Remember when you were only little and we used to have Mav and Jess days and Goose and Jess days?\" \"Yeah they were fun why?\" \"Well I was thinking maybe we should have one of them today seeing as we technically still have a whole day of holiday's left.\" Laughing Jess said \"You're on by the way go have a shower in Mav's room and I'll put out some of his clothes for you because we are going to dinner.\" \"Really?\" \"Really all expenses paid courtesy of Maverick,\" she said flashing his credit card \"Beverages are courtesy of Iceman and slider,\" She said flashing a cheque signed by slider and Iceman's credit card. Goose laughed as they headed upstairs and a few moments later she was doing up Goose tie and they were walking down to the limo that waited \"Once again, Maverick was all too happy to oblige,\" Jess laughed. \"I'll see you there I need to talk to Maverick so I'll talk to you later/\" she said closing the door after him and watching the limo slip away. \"Talk to me Maverick,\" she said flipping up her phone[Chapter 5] \"Carol had just left the building I repeat Carol had just left the building,\" \"Good job Mav you can be my wingman anytime,\" \"Bullshit you can be mine!\" \"Love you Mav,\" \"Love you to Phoen,\" she clicked off as he Phone began to ring again \"What!\" she exclaimed \"Excuse me Lieutenant?\" Viper asked \"Sorry sir,\" Jess hurriedly apologized. \"I need Maverick and Goose up in the sky now and they aren't answering their phones.\" \"You can't have them and by them I mean Goose,\" \"Excuse me,\" \"You can have Iceman and Slider if you haven't already got them and if you do I'll go up with Hollywood and if you really really want you can have Maverick and Sunrise.\" \"Fine Lieutenant hurry up to the base and suit up I'll call Hollywood and Sunrise you can call Maverick.\" \"On it sir and thank you,\" \"You're welcome lieutenant but if you ever disobey me again head will roll.\" \"Yes sir,\" She clicked off and pressed the speed dial button for Maverick. \"Mav, get your butt back to base we're going up into the air. \"But what about Goose and Carol's date?\" Maverick wanted to know \"It's still on your with Sunrise and I'm with Hollywood, where are you?\" \"Officers bar,\" \"I'll pick you up on the bike,\" she said picking up Mavericks key's locking the door and swinging up onto Mavericks bike, \"I'll be there in five.\" \"But your half an hour away assuming you're at the house.\" \"Trust me Maverick I'll be there in five and no more drinks unless it's water,\" \"Yes mum I can't believe you're going to speed for me,\" \"Shut up I'm on my way.\" \"Love you,' \"Love you more by the way if I get pulled over it's on you,\" \"Sweet see you later I'll be out the front.\" Jess shut her phone and kicked the roaring engine to life pushing the throttle to its limits. The houses around her blurred until she came to a halt with the engine running in front of the officers club. She slipped behind as Maverick slipped on his bike as she wrapped her arms around his waist and held on for dear life. They roared down the streets until they arrived at the base where Maverick killed the engine and they ran inside straight to the instructor's change rooms where they stripped of pulled on their jump suits and grabbed their helmets and masks. They slipped into the student change rooms next door. Where all the boys where in various states of dress after two months of getting change around each other nobody noticed that Jess was different she and Maverick only changed in the officers room's out of sheer habit. \"Phoenix!\" Hollywood called looking up and seeing her. \"Thanks for nominating me as your RIO it's been ages since I've been on a proper offensive flight.\" \"Hollywood when Angel's and Goose are away there's nobody I'd rather have as my wingman!\" \"Isn't that sweet!\" Iceman crowed \"the little baby's gone all mushy for Hollywood.\" \"Iceman I thought we were past al this bullshit or do I need to paste those photos around base?\" Jess said as Maverick laughed \"Gentlemen,\" Viper said as he and Jester walked in \"and ladies,\" he tacked on as an afterthought \"we are facing a crisis that is why I have called all of you, the best of the best here today some of you are not the pairs I would have chosen,\" Viper flicked Jess Mav Hollywood and Sunset a look \"but you'll do.\" He paused \"there one possible hostile bogeys heading towards it is possible the bogey could be a UAV. It is your job to scope them out and remember Gentlemen do not shoot until fired upon,\" \"I'd say you to Phoenix but it's not for your benefit that I'm issuing the warning.\" Viper said catching the dirty look Jess shot at him. \"Now let's do this people.\" They all grabbed their helmets jumped in their planes and hit the air. \"You see him Hollywood?\" I asked into the hand held radio as we sped above the cloud surface. I took that opportunity to watch the clouds just a few feet below us. The clouds had never ceased to amaze me. \"Not yet, but I'm sure he'll start to engage us soon\" Hollywood replied as he watched his radar opposite me. \"Talk to me Sunset\" I heard Maverick order playfully into the hand held radio. \"Roger I got him, 20 left 2900 miles, 920 knots closure\" Goose replied opposite Maverick just below us. \"Phoenix, you hear that?\" Mav asked knowing full well I could. He just liked to act macho and arrogant in the air. \"Roger Maverick\" I replied as I ordered Hollywood to set our destination closer to the bugger we needed to engage. \"I'll get a visual ID then Phoenix you hook him\" Maverick joked as they swooped out to better see who we were dealing with. \"Roger and I'll clean him and fry him\" Sunset crowed enthusiastically. \"Sunset sweetie? There's only one Goose.\" \"Burn ouch how does that feel Sunset?\" Iceman asked making Jess jump she'd forgotten that he and slider where in the air watching her and Mavericks back's something she was sure Maverick was not completely comfortable with. \"Phoenix this is Ghostrider sector 90903 I got an inbound bogey heading 2020 at 10 miles 900 knots closure\" Ghostrider's voice called loud and clear. \"Roger Ghostrider\" I replied as I ordered Hollywood to span out to get a view of the bogey. \"Sunset you see a trailer?\" I asked as I furrowed my brow in confusion. Bogeys don't usually travel alone and it was very unusual that the one we were tailing was. \"Negative Phoenix, looks like he's a single you worry to much\" Sunset replied with a laugh. \"Phoenix, I'm gonna go head to head with him\" Maverick called over the hand held radio. \"Take it easy Maverick I don't like this crap. We're gonna break high and right, see if he's alone\" Hollywood replied making me smile. Hollywood had a small fear of being left alone and often forgot I was with him sometimes. Though it never affected his flying ability. \"We got a thousand knots closure Maverick, he's coming right at us\" Sunset cautioned watching the radar. \"Okay buddy what's on your mind\" Maverick muttered to himself. Suddenly I heard a rush of wind beneath us that took my breath away. \"Oh shoot there's 3 of them!\" Maverick's panicked voice penetrated my thoughts. \"Mg28's none of them has been this close before\" Sunset agreed with the same concern in his voice as Maverick's. \"What the heck are they doing there?\" I cried as I scanned the sky for any trace of them. \"What's their position?\" I heard Viper's voice ask Ghostrider just as concerned as we were. \"250 miles out sir\" Ghostrider replied diligently answering his superior officer. \"250 miles, get them out of there!\" Viper's panicked voice rang out. \"You got mg1, I'm going after mg 2 Iceman mg 3\" Maverick said hoarsely. \"Roger\" I replied as I continued to scan the clouds. \"Crap! There he is, right above us\" Hollywood's panic stricken voice yelled causing my hands to shake. I wasn't used to hearing Hollywood freak. \"I lost him in the sun! Crap what's he's doing!\" Hollywood yelled this time the panic in his voice was even more provident. \"You got him Phoenix?\" Maverick asked concerned. \"He's coming around! He's coming around on our tail!\" Cougar cried really freaking out now. \"God damn it! This bogey's all over us!\" I cried as I was able to get a shaky visual. \"He's mp500. Go get him Maverick\" Goose ordered. \"Holy shit Goose what happened to your date.\" \"I heard you guys were in a little trouble we can talk about this later concentrate on the sky.\" \"I'm going for missile lock, see if we can scare this guy out of here\" maverick replied. \"I got him locked!\" Maverick cried but a second later. I sighed with relief knowing that we had one Bogey down. \"We got him Phoenix! He's bugging out and going home!\" Maverick crowed as they soared a miles away from us. \"Hollywood he's got missile lock on us! Get away from this guy!\" I cried as I heard an incessant beeping noise signalling a pilot's worst fear. \"I can't take this crap! He's engaging me! Mustang this is Hollywood, 1274! He's got missile lock on me do I have permission to fire?\" Hollywood yelled franticly into the hand held radio. \"Do not fire until fired upon!\" my Viper's voice rang out clearly upset by this whole ordeal. \"But then it may be too late sir\" I objected knowing we didn't have much hope if we were fired upon. \"The mg's in perfect firing position the mg's right on Phoenix's tail\" I heard Sunset exclaim above us. \"No way Sunset, he'd have fired by now he's just trying to piss us off\" Maverick's hoarse assurance wasn't enough to satisfy me. \"Maverick get down here and get him off us! Do some of that pilot shit \"I cried becoming desperate. This was not how I wanted to go out. \"Easy, Jessie. Break hard right and engage. I'm on my way\" Maverick said discarding my call name. \"If we can't shoot this guy then we can at least have a little fun with him\" I heard Maverick laugh. I watched as they soared into behind our bogey and threw missile lock on him. \"Greetings!\" Maverick laughed. \"Phoenix your tail is clear, big one's bugged out\" Maverick assured us. I furrowed my brow as I checked behind me at Hollywood. He was breathing heavily and sweating profusely. \"Were fine now Hollywood, promise.\" I told him and called to Ice \"you get yours?\" \"Yep mg 3 has left the building lets head home,\" \"Hey that's my line!\" I argued as Maverick laughed \"I've had enough fun for one day Mav lets head home.\" \"I'll follow you.\" \"Alright Sweetie Love you,\" \"Love you two,\" \"Love you more,\" Iceman butted in \"Shut up Iceman!\" Maverick and I called in unison. Almost as soon as I landed the plane Goose was up to the ladder and pulling me into his arms. \"Never ever go up in the air without me again do you hear me?\" \"Yes sir,\" I said snapping a lazy salute. Smiling Goose carried me down the ladder where I was assaulted by paramedics. \"Get real I'm fine!\" Jess yelled as Maverick practically kicked the top of his plane and jumped down without waiting for the ladder freaked out by the site of me in Goose's arms being surrounded by paramedics. \"Mav!\" Jess called \"Phoen you okay sweetheart?\" he asked practically yelling as Goose good naturedly surrendered her into Maverick arms \"Maverick I'm fine,\" IJesssaid as he cuddled me close sobs racking his chest he grabbed Jess's head and pulled it up to his eyes \"From now on if you go up we go up as a family,\" Maverick said looking at Goose. \"Knowing I might lose you when that mg had you on missile Jess it was unbearable I can't and I won't lose you okay,\" \"Alright but you guys don't go up without me up there or as part of the ground crew,\" \"Rodger that Ghostrider.\" \"Don't get cocky Maverick!\" Jess warned smiling as Maverick Smiled back Goose grabbed her hand and they all walked back to the officer's change rooms where Jess almost collapsed in the shower. She stepped out to find a freshly pressed formal white uniform with a note saying your presence is requested at the Officers club, As she got changed she flicked a raised eyebrow at Maverick and Goose who were both in the process of getting changed into their dress uniforms. They both shrugged clearly as much in the dark as Jess. When they were all presentable Jess noticed Mavericks tie was done wrong and stopped him before doing it up correctly and fixing Gooses jacket they then joined hands and walked down the few streets to the officers club. As they opened the door and walked inside they found the bar filled with lots of women scantily dressed \"This is what I call a target-rich environment.\" \"You live your life between your legs, Mav.\" \"Goose, even you could get laid in a place like this.\" \"Hell, I'd be happy to just find a girl that would talk dirty to me.\" \"When you two ladies are finished?\" Jess asked. The three of them jumped as lights switched of and the highlights of their flying career flashed on the wall as a bunch of crashes from their beginning days of practising bailing out flashed on screen Goose whispered to Mav and Jess \"This gives me a hard on,\" \"Don't tease me,\" Maverick whispered back as Jess shuddered as the reel finished everyone began clapping and calling out congratulations as Iceman and Slider steeped out behind them so the formed a V Iceman whispered in her ear. \"Vipers way of saying thank you don't cause a fuss.\" \"Thanks for the tip off genius,\" Jess hissed back plastering a fake smile on her face that made the boy's laugh. At about midnight the night started to get to her so Jess stood up on the bar knowing Maverick and Ice were having to good a time grabbed the Mike and \"Hey, Goose, you big stud! \" \"That's me, honey. \" Goose crowed back \"Take me to bed or lose me forever.\" Jess called \"Show me the way home, honey. \" As he walked over to Jess grabbed her hand helping her down from the bar and carrying her home and tucking her into bed. \"Hey Goose don't go,\" \"Sure thing darlin' what do you want me to do?\" \"Cuddles and then tell me about your date.\" Jess said threw a yawn \"How about Cuddles now and talking tomorrow,\" Goose suggested sliding down next to her and wrapping his arms around her in a tight embrace. \"Fine but I won't forget.\" Jess said nuzzling into him and seconds later falling fast asleep \"Sure you won't\" he said stroking her hair. \"I'm sure you won't.\" Soon enough Goose was fast asleep as well. The next morning Jess awoke to a gentle snoring sound in her ear. Gently untangling herself from his arms. Jess walked down stairs to make some coffee. As soon as the pot finished brewing Maverick walked in and flung himself down in one of the chairs. \"Want some coffee Mav?\" \"I'd love some,\" he said in a hoarse voice slowly Jess filled up a mug with two sugars and milk and turned around to pass it to him but the expression of pain on his face caused her to drop the mug. As boiling hot coffee spilt all over her feet she barely noticed. She just kept looking at the big puffy bruises and small deep cuts that were now etched into Mavericks face.[Chapter 6] \"Who did this to you?\" she asked purely shocked \"You have to ask?' Maverick said wincing \"I am going to kill him!\" \"No Jess don't it's what he wants.\" \"Either you report this or I go after him.\" \"Fine go but don't say I didn't warn you,\" \"Good,\" Jess said picking up the coffee pot and running up to Iceman's room and slamming the door open because Iceman still didn't wake Jess tipped half the boiling coffee over his crotch. This caused Ice to wake screaming with a vengeance he lept out of bed and started pulling his burning pyjama pants and boxers off trying to wipe the burning coffee of his crotch. Jess being Jess had after slamming the door locked it behind her and locked the bathroom door as well. So as Ice tried in vain to open the doors to place water on the burning skin around his crotch Jess just laughed Ice man settled instead for jumping up and down in circles screaming in pain. As if only just then seeing her for the first time Iceman covered himself and leapt under the covers yelping as the still boiling covers began to antagonise his crotch further. \"What the hell was that for?\" He yelled wincing as more hot liquid seeped through the covers and onto his burnt skin. \"Hurting Maverick,\" \"We got into a fight so what, that was no need to for this,\" he gestured at his crotch. \"Not my problem you should have thought about my revenge before you hurt Maverick.\" \"You know what it's just like Maverick to go crying to his baby sister instead of fighting his own battles.\" \"Don't make me tip the rest of this on you,\" \"Yes Mum,\" \"Iceman,\" she warned \"What he wouldn't go for another head to head with me after I insulted your honour the wimp so the boys and I taught him a lesson. \"If you'll fucking quit it I'll go head to head with you over my honour Bring your RIO and I'll borrow someone's for mine but be aware Mav can't know or he'll wanna be up there.\" \"When?\" Iceman asked \"Now,\" was Jess's reply Iceman got up and threw on some clothed on as Jess walked to her room and gently shook Goose awake. \"What, what is it?\" Goose asked barley Coherent. Sighing Jess picked him up and bundled him into the shower. \"FUCK!\" Goose yelled stepping out of the water. She passed him a towel a white shirt and pair of Mavericks Jeans and quickly got changed out of her crumpled white uniform into her white t and Jeans knowing she wouldn't be in them for long she threw her blonde hair back into a bun grabbed goose hand as they ran out the door and onto Mavericks bike and practically flew to the base. \"What's happening Jessie?\" Goose asked as they got changed into their jumpsuits. \"We are having a one on one with Ice,\" \"Where's Mav then?\" \"We as in just you and me Goose I had to leave Mav out of this after last time.\" \"Okay,\" Goose replied seemingly unfazed. They both walked out of the change rooms and out onto the tarmac where Ice and Slider were waiting. \"Morning Slider you look a little tired.\" Jess said giving him a hug \"I'm sorry Ice got you out of bed,\" \"Me too but it' okay\" He replied hugging her back \"How did you get permission for a solo ride at five in the bloody morning?\" Jess asked incredibly curious \"My superiors love me,\" Ice said \"Let's get ready there's not enough room on the tarmac for us and your ego.\" Jess said He thinks he's going to win,\" Jess said dismissively, looking over at Ice as she and Goose readied their jet. \"And we know we're going to win,\" Goose told him. \"Forget about it. This look okay to you?\" \"Its fine,\" Jess told him, climbing into the cockpit. \"Yeah, we should be good,\" he said, tugging at a cable. Sliding her helmet on. \"Instruments and gauges fully functional,\" she said. She clicked on the comm. \"You up for this, Kazanski?\" \"Just do it, Mitchell,\" Iceman snapped, sounding fidgety and wired. Making Jess laughed she knew he was upset because unlike Mav he had never seen her fly when she was in charge. Mav had always been delegating now she was flying for her. Little did they know that as Jess powered up and flew into the air Maverick was running into the officer's change rooms. Swearing when he saw Jess and Goose's flying gear missing and the cloths they had worn out of the house on the hooks. He then powered into the students change rooms to see Kazanski's and sliders stuff missing he then ran as fast as he could to the tarmac but Jess, Goose, Slider and Iceman were already way gone up in the sky. Maverick ran up to the tower and barged past the security guards shouting \"My baby sisters up there you gotta let me through!\" Luckily for Maverick Viper was up in the tower and waved him through. \"I had a feeling this was a little more personal than a training exercise when I heard about the stunt you lot pulled out on H.S Henry,\" He said as Maverick blushed \"Sir you got to get her down, Iceman will cream her, she's only flown on her own without me a couple of times and he last time she almost got shot down.\" Viper passed Maverick the radio \"Well then talk to her.\" \"Phoenix this is Maverick requesting you head back to base immediately.\" \"As if Mav you want me come up and get me.\" Jess replied as Viper gave him a look that said don't you dare. \"Phoen come on let me fight my own battles come home and me and Ice will talk it out.\" \"Baby Girl lets go home.\" \"No lets finish this.\" Jess said spotting Ice who was hovering unawares of her presence silently Jess scoped him out and tuned in missile lock before crying into the radio. \"Great Balls of fire Iceman has been shot down I repeat Iceman has been shot down,\" as Goose laughed and said \"Good Job baby girl Good Job.\" As a furious Iceman sped in front of them Jess yelled \"That son of a bitch cut me off.\" She then felt herself being caught in his jet wash and cried \"Maverick Help!\" Goose and Jess began spinning down towards the ocean Jess trying every means they ever taught pilots to overcome the obstacle. \"Holy Shit Jess Eject, Eject!\" Goose cried abandoning their call signs Jess reached up and grabbed the ejection handle and pulled just in time. The air whooshed past in her ear as her and Goose's life jackets inflated as the hit the water. \"Goose, Gosse.\" She called over and over searching for her brother partner in the Green haze of the Auto flares. I'm here Jessie don't worry I'm fine,\" he called A chopper roared overhead and a Navy rescue team abseiled down and pulled Goose from the wreckage as soon as they were clear another pilot abseiled down and Jess was surprised to find that it was Lee her beginning top Gun RIO who changed professions was the one who held her close as they were winched up into the plane. When they got up their Goose pulled her into his warm wet arms and held her close Lee handed Goose a towel which he wrapped around her shivering body. \"Were okay baby were okay.\" He whispered in her ears rubbing her back soothingly. Almost as soon as the plane landed Maverick ran in and ripped Jess of Goose. \"Don't you ever fly without me again okay I must be up in the air with you at all times?\" \"Yes Mav,\" Jess said with a yawn. \"You okay baby?\" \"I'm fine Maverick just a little tired.\" Maverick's eyes opened wide when he saw the blood imprinted on spots of her uniform and was about to take her to the paramedics who after Jess's last reaction to them were waiting on the sidelines when Iceman's plane pulled up on the runway. \"Goose take Jess to the paramedics and get her looked over and have a doctor report to me with the results I don't trust this one to tell me the truth.\" Maverick watched as Iceman and Slider slowly disembarked the plane. He walked up to Iceman grabbed him by the collar and shoved him against the wall. As goose saw Slider got to hit Maverick he quickly dumped Jess in the arms of a startled Lee. Running over Goose pulled Slider of Maverick so Maverick had a clear shot. \"You almost killed my baby sister and my wingman you stupid, stupid man.\" Maverick yelled punching Iceman in the face with every word. \"Maverick,\" It was Jess's cry from across the tarmac that made him stop hitting Ice he turned seeing her being shut in an ambulance the look in her eyes clearly terrified. He quickly turned back to Ice \"I'll deal with you scum later,\" he said as he and Goose shoved their captives and Maverick spat on Ice. He ran across the tarmac and into the ambulance that was carrying his sister. She was so scared she was sobbing carefully he pulled her against her rubbing her back and saying. \"It's okay everything is going to be okay.\" As Jess was unloaded onto a gurney Maverick followed her as far as he could. A few minutes later as he was pacing the waiting room he was joined by Goose who had been delayed by several paramedics wishing to check over him. \"Mav, do you know what happened,\" Goose whispered. Maverick shook his head. \"No, I don't. All she was doing was checking her over and then all of a sudden she calling to me as their shutting her in the ambulance. She was so scared she was crying Goose. She only cried when there was that breach of trust thing with Kazanski . She didn't cry in the plane or on the rescue chopper. She only cried in the ambulance.\" \"Mav I'm sure she's fine,\" 'I hope your right Goose,\" \"So do I Mav so do I,\" The doctor had come back with Jess's status. \"Sir,\" the doctor started, \"Jessica is...\" Jessica is...,\" the doctor said, draining all of my patience. I started yelling at the doctor; whose name I realized was Doctor Sade. \"Tell me how my sister is,\" I growled. Doctor Sade finally finished his sentence, \"Jessica is, well it's complicated, there's been a large amount of blood loss we've done some transfusions and sticked up the wounds, we just don't know yet. We're going to do some blood tests to find out if there are any infections or diseases from the cuts or any other substances she could have swallowed during the crash. Goose shot me a worried look as I ran into Jess's hospital room. \"Jess! Baby, are you ok? God please tell me she's alright,\" I yelled desperately. Jess's fingers moved towards me, and I knew she was alright. \"Maverick I'm fine,\" She assured me as she tried to prop herself up failing miserably. Goose and I rushed over to help her. \"I'm just a little dizzy and sleepy but when you've lost a couple of pints who wouldn't be.\" \"Jess what happened why where you crying?\" I asked \"Cause I thought you were going to kill Iceman,\" \"Oh baby I was so mad at him for endangering you over a fight with me I thought I might.\" \"Plus I didn't want to be here without you!\" \"That's sweet where can I hug you without hurting you.\" \"Basically just my shoulder's that's the one part of my body that survived without stiches apparently I'm going to be in Hospital for a while.\" \"You poor baby,\" Said Goose \"Your being really brave,\" That's me Lieutenant Phoenix \"Brave\" Mitchell. Both boys laughed weakly Jess could sense that they were both still really worried about her. This meant there was something they weren't telling her. \"What is it?\" \"What is what?\" Maverick asked nonchalantly \"Maverick, Goose,\" Jess warned glaring at them Goose was the first to break. \"They think you may have an infection from the cuts or the transfusions,\" He blurted \"Hospitals are so overprotective,\" Jess mused \"who would have thought,\" \"You're not scared anymore?\" Maverick asked \"Well no you're not going to kill Ice and Slider and you're here with me so obviously not.\" \"Obviously,\" Maverick mused. \"You do realise they're going to start an inquiry into this guys,\" Goose said \"Dig down into what started the rivalries in the first place.\" Jess and Mav looked at each other. \"Mav where's my phone?\" Jess asked \"In your bag at the base you can use mine,\" Jess quickly found Vipers number and clicked the phone button. \"Hello Sir, its Lieutenant Mitchell no Sir the Younger Lieutenant Mitchell,\" \"What is it and where are you Lieutenant,\" Viper asked \"Well sir I am at the hospital with Maverick and Goose.\" \"Why are you at the Hospital Lieutenant Goose was cleared by the medical team a few hours ago.\" \"Yes sir Goose was but I wasn't I have over 10 stiches and a transfusion of more than 2 pints of blood.\" \"Oh my apologises Phoenix I thought you lot where shirking in your duties again what's the verdict.\" \"I believe I'm fine but their keeping me in for testing.\" \"May I ask the reason you called Phoenix other than to inform me of your location?\" \"Well sir I would like to talk to you about the report of the incident sir, so my opinion is not left out seeing as I was piloting the plane that went down.\" \"Of course Lieutenant.\" \"Sir may I ask what Iceman said happened,\" \"He said there was always anatomisation between him and Maverick and when they moved in together it progressed even further. Until they got into a fight over you and you stuck for Maverick taking on Iceman's one on one challenge. You with me so far Lieutenant,\" \"Yes sir.\" \"He then say's you won the one on one and he was mad and headed home at around 400 knots and around 3 meters above you and you were caught in the inevitable jet wash. Is this what you believe happened?\" \"Yes sir that is exactly how I would have put it though I would have thrown in a couple of expletives on my and Goose's behalf.\" \"Uhuh,\" \"Sir, may I ask who this incriminates and what punishment they will be dealt.\" \"The only pilot that your and Gooses testimony incriminates is Iceman, and as for his punishment providing that both you, Goose and Maverick put in a good word he could get off free of all charges. Or it could be the end of his career.\" \"I'll keep that in mind.\" \"Phoenix, Jess Ice was pretty shaken up about the whole thing, he was crying because he almost got you killed. He doesn't care about his career he only cares about you. He wanted to come see you at the hospital but Slider thought Maverick might flip again and he said that is no less than I deserve.\" \"I'll keep that in mind when I ask Mav about it.\" \"You're a good kid Jess.\" \"Thanks sir I'll talk to you later.\" \"Bye!\" \"Bye!\" She hung up without another word. Sighing she rubbed her eyes and said. \"Boy's I want you to keep and objective view about this, Viper wants us to put in a good word for Iceman.\" \"No way,\" Maverick burst out \"that dick almost got both of you killed,\" \"Finished? and it wouldn't be the first time,\" Jess shot back as Maverick flinched She knew that just the same as she was he was having a flashback \"How many bogey's do we got Goose?\" Phoenix asked as they were flying up. \"1 pair of bogeys, closing in at 140 knots.\" Goose said to her as well as Ice Man and Cougar. \"That's it? Why the hell are there three of us then?\" Jess asked. \"I don't know, just go Phoenix.\" Goose muttered. \"Okay, Cougar, Ice, I've got the Northern bogey.\" \"Roger Phoen, I got the Southern guy.\" Cougar said. \"Shit Guys! There isn't one pair, but two pairs I repeat two pairs!\" Slider shouted. \"Ice, grab a bogey and let's party!\" Phoenix said with a laugh. \"Phoenix, watch out there's a bogey coming up to your left.\" Ice said. \"Roger that, crap, I'm too close, I'm switching to guns.\" Jess said switching to guns and getting a lock, she shot and grinned as a few bullets made contact. \"Shit, Phoenix get this bogey off my tail!\" Cougar shouted. \"I'm coming Coug, hang on.\" Phoenix said flying over to Cougar. \"Merlin, how fast are they closing in?'' Phoenix asked. \"155 knots.\" Merlin said. \"Alright, just give me a few seconds!\" she said while trying to get a lock, she grinned as the target turned red and beeped. She shot down his bogey without a problem. \"Ice, you alright?\" Phoenix asked as she engaged with her bogey. \"Yeah, Cougar, grab the Northern bogey of the second pair.\" Ice said trying to outrun a bogey. \"Ice break left on three…three, two, one, BREAK LEFT!\" Cougar shouted. Ice broke left on three just as a bogey was about to fire his guns at Ice's spot. \"Damn it, what's this? Kill Cougar day? Phoenix get him off me…\" Cougar said in an annoyed tone as a bogey got on his tail. \"You're a pilot Cougar…so like, yeah, they are obviously trying to kill you!\" Phoenix said in a voice as though talking to a four-year old. \"Shut up…\" She grinned as she heard him mutter \"pilot\" and \"girls shouldn't fly\" and \"to smart for her own good\" or \"kill her one day, I swear\" \"Phoenix, there's a bogey coming off on your tail.\" Ice said turning his plane to get a shot. \"Ice, I'm gonna try to get this guy off ya, okay?\" Phoenix said referring to the bogey on his tail. \"Roger Phoenix.\" Ice said as Slider turned around to try to get a better look at their bogey. \"I've got a lock!\" Cougar said suddenly as he got a lock on the bogey going on Phoenix's tail. He shot the missile but the bogey went out of the way, Phoenix, who's only concentration was on the bogey ahead of her didn't see as the missile came zooming to her tail. \"PHOENIX! GOOSE!\" came the 4 voices belonging to Merlin, Cougar, Slider, and Ice Man. Goose turned around just as the missile hit their wing. It occurred in slow motion, Phoenix was just about to get a lock on the bogey in front of her when she heard the guys scream her and goose's name, she turned at the same time is Goose did, just to see a missile, the same one aimed by Ice, hit their left wing. \"Shit! Our left wing is totally gone! What the hell is wrong with you Coug? Jess, we've got to eject!\" Goose said in an alarmingly angry yet worried tone. They were spinning out of control; her left wrist was searing in pain… that can't be good… Jess thought trying to reach the ejection handle. \"Goose, I can't reach the ejection handle, Goose, we're going to crash, grab the handle!\" Jess said in a fruitless attempt to reach the handle. She turned to Goose; he was trying in vain to reach the handle. Finally coming to her senses she loosened the fastens holding her to her seat and reached up, she could feel it in her fingers she clasped her fingertips around it and they ejected, luckily. She watched in horror as the plane lowered at an alarmingly fast rate to the ground…About 10 seconds later she heard a crash, and knew it was her plane, she turned to goose, they had a couple seconds until they reached the ground, when they finally did, Jess fell forward as she came running into the ground, Goose, on the other hand, landed as smooth as possible in a parachute. Goose grinned slightly; she never was that good at bailing out. \"Goose, are you okay?\" Jess asked jumping up. \"Fine Jess…a little shook up, but fine nonetheless.\" Goose said rubbing his left leg, Jess looked down and saw blood pouring out of it, she grimaced in horror, but looked up when he asked about her. \"Fine…\" She muttered, and Goose looked at her oddly as the helicopter ladder dropped, Phoenix went first, and then helped Goose in, and they flew off to the base. \"Mav,\" she said coming back to the present with a jolt, \"It aint the first time I've been shot down by family,\" Jess said referring to the fact that Cougar was indeed their brother. \"And I can guarantee you it won't be last I didn't hold it against Coug and I aint going to hold it against Ice either.\" \"I agree with Jess it wasn't Cougars intention for the Bogey to move and it sure as hell wasn't Ice intention for us to be caught in his jet wash.\" \"Fine but if it happens again we hold it against him.\" Jess rolled her eyes \"You're just looking for something to hold against Ice Mav,\" she shook her head and imitated Stinger \"And let's not bullshit Maverick. Your family name ain't the best in the Navy. You need to be doing it better, and cleaner than the other guy.\" \"Great balls of fire you sounded just like him then do another one.\" Goose crowed \"And if you screw up just this much, you'll be flying a cargo plane full of rubber dog shit out of Hong Kong! \" She cleared her windpipe and imitated a Maverick like pose and saluted lazily \"Yes, sir! \" \"I do not act like that,\" Maverick argued. \"Yes you do.\" Goose and Jess snorted. \"Do me, Do me,\" Goose requested. \"Jeez Goose you sound three years old.\" She imitated their instructor Charlie: So, lieutenant, where exactly where you? Back to Maverick: Well, we... and imitated Goose: Thank you. Maverick: Started up on a 6, when he pulled from the clouds, and then I moved in above him. Charlie: Well, if you were directly above him, how could you see him? Maverick: Because I was inverted. Iceman: [coughs whilst saying] Bullshit. Goose: No, he was man. It was a really great move. He was inverted. Charlie: You were in a 4g inverted dive with a MiG28? Maverick: Yes, ma'am. Charlie: At what range? Maverick: Um, about two meters. Goose: It was actually about one and a half I think. It was one and a half. I've got a great Polaroid of it, and he's right there, must be one and a half. Maverick: Was a nice picture. Goose: Thanks. Charlie: Eh, lieutenant, what were you doing there? Goose: Communicating. Maverick: Communicating. Keeping up foreign relations. You know, giving him the bird! Goose: [Charlie looks puzzled, so Goose clarifies] You know, the finger Charlie: Yes, I know the finger, Goose. Goose: I-I'm sorry, I hate it when it does that, I'm sorry. Excuse me. \"Switching back to her own voice her eyes took over a dreamy quality. \"That was my favourite class.\" As Maverick cacked himself laughing. \"You are way too good at this, have you been practising?\" Goose accused \"Maybe,\" Jess hedged sneakily making Maverick laugh even harder. \"Give it up Goose no one can win when she's made up her mind.\" \"Fine,\" Goose said drawing it to into two syllables. \"Hey Goose you never did say what happened with you and Carol?\" Jess asked \"Well guys the flowers, limo and fancy restaurant were great but when we got to dinner she told me she was leaving me for a truck driver fresh out of high school. \"Oh Goosy,\" Jess said pulling him close \"I'm so sorry.\" \"Don't be there's only on lady I need in my life and she's hugging me right now.\" \"Oh Goose.\" There was a knock on the door and Doctor Sade walked in holding a clipboard. \"We have the results of the testing,\" He announced \"Jessica is,\" \"Jessica is…\" \"I am what Doc,\" Jess shouted. \"You are fine, you may go home, and the stiches will dissolve into your skin when the cuts have healed.\" \"Fantastic let's go boys. We need to hit the base to put in a good word for Ice and my change of clothes are their anyway.\" Jess wrapped her arms around Maverick and Goose squeezed on and they hit the base. They barged their way into the conference room that served as the base's courtroom when there was an inquiry. Ice was on the stand but everyone turned to stare at Jess, Mav and Goose and she knew that they must look a right sight. Her blonde hair was tangled and slightly green from the flares she had big pools of blood on her jumpsuit and Goose was no better. Maverick standing there in his wrinkled civi's was the only one who looked remotely normal.[Chapter 7] \"Jess, Goose shouldn't you two be in hospital,\" \"No,\" They chorused and Jess said \"Get of the sand it's my go because I really, really want to get out of here and into a warm shower.\" \"Ladies and Gentlemen my name is Lieutenant Jessica Lee Mitchell call sign Phoenix sister of Lieutenant Pete Mitchell call sign Maverick, friend of Lieutenant Nate Midnight call sign Goose and I was the pilot of the plane that went down and I am here to testify that I hold nothing against Iceman and believe any sentence should be suspended and charges dropped.\" Goose took the stand as she dismounted \"I am Lieutenant Nate Midnight call sign Goose I was the acting RIO of the plane that went down and am here to testify that I hold nothing against Iceman and believe any sentence should be suspended and charges dropped.\" As Goose dismounted Maverick took the stand \"I am Lieutenant Pete Mitchell call sign Maverick and older brother of Lieutenant Jessica Mitchell call sign Jess. I was in the tower watching and co-ordinating with the pilots and I am here as a witness and a relation to both crashies to testify that I hold nothing against Iceman and believe any sentence should be suspended and charges dropped.\" The show of support for Iceman brought a tear to his eye. This made Tears fall from the young aviators face as she ran over to him and hugged him saying \"10 stiches over two pints of blood transfusions later and I still love you same as always.\" \"I love you to baby girl I'm so sorry.\" \"Don't be it was a valuable learning experience on how touchy doctors can be. \" \"What did you do?\" Iceman asked \"Nothing okay I might have called him chrome dome but he should have told me my verdict earlier rather than procrastinating.\" Everybody laughed as Jess said \"What?\" An elderly general took the stand and said \"Due to this touching show of support from all of the aviators involved we have decided that all sentences are too herby be suspended and all charges to be cleared. Everybody even Maverick cheered. Iceman walked over to Maverick and said \"Friends?\" \"Friends,\" Maverick decided So there you have it two enemies brought together by a friend a couple of near death experiences and a sparky blonde kid who won't take no for an answer. Love you Tim. ","Summary":" Iceman was convinced it was Maverick's fault. He just knew Maverick had left the stove on and gone "},{"Movie":"Spy Kids","Title":"TO LOVE A PROGRAM","Author":"kentzelesky","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11805283","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter One: Feeling Lost: Juni Cortez sighed as he sat down at his computer to check his email. Seeing no messages in the inbox he quickly logged out. As he stared out the big window overlooking his home, he allowed his mind to drift. It had been 3 months since he and his sister Carmen were successful in shutting down Game Over. He knew he should feel proud right about now, it was a big accomplishment, especially after also protecting Washington DC once the Toymaker had brought Game Over into the real world. As Juni continued to sit and ponder he also thought, about what it meant for his grandfather and that whole cascade of events. Juni had been unaware when he brought his grandfather into the game, that the Toymaker was the person responsible for putting Juni's grandfather in the wheel chair. Throughout the time within the game Juni repeatedly begged his grandfather to not take revenge. Of course what Juni did not understand, was his grandfather wanted to release the Toymaker so that he could forgive him. Juni smiled for a moment remembering when his grandfather and the toymaker emerged together comrades again. But just as quickly as the smile appeared it was gone. Juni sat there almost in trance and asked himself, \"why am I feeling this way\". Of course in his heart he knew exactly why, but this was not exactly the type of thing you tell people about. However, the downside to not telling anyone about how you feel meant that you had to hold all the burden and pain by yourself. Juni closed his eyes and gently allowed his mind to once again drift, but this time, he thought about a girl he left behind in the world of Game Over. He thought back to the girl in dark purple fighting attire and dark brown hair, the one whom he fought and beat in the robot arena, the one that helped him find his sister. His eyes snapped open. \"Demetra\", he whispered. It was so quiet it sounded more like a prayer than a longing which is how Juni truly felt. He thought about Demetra and how she was ultimately the reason level 5 was unwinnable. He remembered punching his glove through her, and just seeing a flash, of lights symbolizing her status as a computer program. He remembered her last words even as he pleaded for her to come with them \"I can't hold it open forever Juni.\" That was the last thing he heard and saw, because not a second later one of the robot money's hands was caught and stuck in the door lock. Juni looked up and saw some of the papers on his desk were wet, he had not even realized that he had started to cry. Composing himself he took a few deep breaths to steady himself, then resumed his current project on his computer. He had only basically just started working again when he felt another presence enter the room. He did not even have to turn around to figure out it was his older sister Carmen. \"Hey Juni\" she said, \"how have you been\"? \"Fine\", came Juni's almost instant reply. Of course Juni seemed to forget even, though, his sister drove him crazy a lot of the time, there was no one who knew him better than her. \"Stop lying Juni\" says Carmen, \"I know you are torn up about something, but I cannot figure it out, are you sure you do not want to talk about it.\" Carmen looked at her brother and realized tears were quickly gathering in his eyes. Juni took a deep breath looked his sister right back square in the face and said \"It is about Demetra\". Carmen's face changed as she processed the information. A whole mess of thoughts began flying through her brain. Demetra she thought, the girl who was the deceiver of Level 5 from the Game Over mission. \"Alright\", Carmen said after a minute, \"what is bothering you about Demetra?\" \"I miss her and want to see her again\", came Juni's reply. \"Juni she is a computer program, she is not real\", Carmen tried to say as gently as she could. \"I know this must hurt a lot, but my advice is try to forgot about her, it will save you from additional pain.\" Carmen knew Juni rarely took her advice, and with something as big as a possible feeling toward a relationship, there was almost no chance at all, but she still felt she should give her younger brother some advice. As she turned to leave the treehouse she said to Juni, \"I hope things get better for you soon little brother.\" After Carmen left Juni closed his computer, but still continued to sit in his chair, wondering if somewhere in the great realm of cyberspace a certain computer program was thinking about him too…[Chapter 2] Chapter Two: I Am More Than a Program: Walking, walking, just endless walking. Demetra also known as the deceiver of Game Over gazed out over the vastness of what remained of the once highly anticipated video game. She did not know what to feel. Part of her felt happy. Happy, because for the first time she was able to resist her programing and actually do something to help someone by her own decision. However, that was not the only emotion she was feeling. She also felt lost. Lost, because now she was the only one left, a computer program wandering aimlessly through cyberspace. No purpose, friends, or even a reason to keep going. Okay, technically the last statement was untrue. Demetra knew she did have something or rather someone to keep her going, but she had no idea if she would even ever see him again. After all she thought, the last time I saw him, he was heading back into the real world. She thought back to watching his face as he realized if she held the portal open, there was no way she could go with him. Demetra could feel her eyes getting wet, but because no one was around she had no problem letting the tears flow. After crying for a few minutes she continued walking. She had no way of knowing how much time had passed since the boy had left, but it felt like forever ago, or at least it did for her. She looked up and realized she had walked so far that she was standing in the green fields with the targets. Although today, there were no targets to be seen. Unphased by this observation she stood there for a moment just to take in the greenness of it all. Even, though, she preferred darker colors her hair and battle attire were indications of that, the green field always calmed her down. It made it easier for her to sort through the mess of thoughts which continually raged within her head. Recently however, she found her thoughts more and more consumed by the boy in the yellow battle attire. She only knew him as Juni, never asked if he had a last name. She laughed out loud, when she thought back to when Juni was the \"supposed guy\" the game character which could lead all players through the unwinnable level 5. She began to smile as she thought back to when she gave him the map to help find his sister. Granted this act was part of her programming, but it was still something which ended up helping Juni in the end, so she figured it was worth it. As she sat there in the green field, she slowly allowed her eyes to close. She sat there unmoving for a few minutes, just surrounded by the peaceful quietness. It was then she began to wonder about things. Talking aloud to herself she began by saying, \"I was created by the Toymaker so that level 5 would be unwinnable. I am just a computer program he designed and implemented. I am just a code, a code built of 1s and 0s, just like any other program.\" However, as Demetra begin to think more and more on it, she came to a startling conclusion. \"If I am a program, I am supposed to do what I was programmed to do, there is no room for me as a program to write my own code per say, and make my own actions\", and yet Demetra thought, that is precisely what I did when I saved Juni and all the other gamers from the robotic gorillas. \"I defied my programming\", Demetra yelled out to no one. Once Demetra had come to this conclusion another thought popped into her head, but this one seemed so impossible she doubted it was even possible at all. However, after giving it even more thought, to the point where her brain started to hurt, Demetra made one final conclusion. There in the green fields of the remainder of the game formally know as Game Over, Demetra whispered into the silence \"Maybe I am more than just a program.\" She did not know it at the time, but this path of thought was going to take her to a place she never thought would be possible. As she got up and continued walking one other thought crept into her head. She realized everyone is gone, except me, but I wonder why the Toymaker has not shown up again. What she could not predict, was she was going to see the Toymaker again soon, and he was not the only one she would see…[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: Is It Possible \"Juni\", \"Juni\", Demetra called out. \"Where are you? I need you now!\" Juni woke with a start. He sat up in bed and looked at his clock. It was only 4:00am. It took him a minute to remind himself he was still in his room. As reality began to kick back in, the dream began to fade. Juni sighed this was the fourth dream this week he had about Demetra. It was interesting he thought the dreams are growing in frequency, even though, by this point it had been almost 6 months since Juni had left the world of Game Over. Realizing that going back to sleep was going to be impossible, Juni decided to get out his computer and keep working on his \"project\". He began said project just a few days after leaving Game Over behind forever, or at least his body left the game. Although, with this new project he was working on, Game Over was still very much a part of his life. After typing in a few more lines of code, Juni took a break and looked at his calendar. His face drooped considerably when he realized he only had about nine months left to finish this project. Now, I know what you're thinking, nine months is a lot of time, and in reality it is. However, in Juni's case he was not even sure if nine months would be sufficient. After giving his eyes a suitable rest from the computer screen, Juni resumed his work. Line after line of code he typed. He began to lose track of time, before he knew it, his 8:00am alarm was going off. Juni realized he would have to put this project away for now because it was almost time for family breakfast. But as he put away this secret project, he had a smile on his face, because he remembered that he had a meeting he had been waiting to have for quite a long time. As Juni got dressed, he found it strange of just whom he was going to meet. Once an enemy to the OSS, this person now had become one of the agencies' top performers in their specific field. As Juni hurried down stairs to join his family at the table he said aloud \"this is going to be a good day.\" It did not take long for Juni's parents Gregorio Cortez and Ingrid Cortez to figure out their son had stayed up late once again, doing goodness knows what. He came downstairs, but had characteristics more like a zombie. His eyes were red, and there were clear signs of bags under his eyes. He walked sluggishly, like it took all his energy just to keep moving his feet one in front of the other. Gregorio Cortez was prepared to pounce on his son with questions, but an icy look from his wife Ingrid Cortez persuaded Gregorio to reconsider his tactics. \"Morning\", Juni said his mother. \"Hey Mom, Hey Dad\". Only about 2 minutes later Carmen came down the stairs and sat down to join the family. Ingrid set pancakes and bacon in front of everyone, and almost instantly every person began eating. After some time had passed, and people were able to swallow, Gregorio decided to try to talk to his son. \"Rough night Juni?\" \"Yeah Dad real rough\", came Juni's reply. After a moment Juni continued, \"Honestly I have no idea why I am sleeping this badly, even when I was young and afraid it was never this bad.\" Ingrid who had been keeping quiet the whole time had a theory about what her son was up to, but for now she decided to keep it to herself. \"Oh Mom that reminds me\", said Juni I will not be home for lunch today because I have a meeting at OSS. \"Really\", came Ingrid's reply, \"with whom\", \"The Toymaker.\" This made everyone stop for a moment and process. \"Are you serious Juni?\", Carmen said, \"Yes Carmen\", I am dead serious came Juni's almost instant reply. \"What is it exactly that you need his help with?\", asked Gregorio. \"My computer has been acting up a lot, and instead of trashing it, I thought maybe the Toymaker would be able to help me fix it\", Juni said. Not one of the Cortez's bought Juni's story, but because it was early, no one felt like creating unnecessary tension. However, Ingrid smiled more to herself than anything, because her theory seemed to be coming more and more of a reality. \"Have fun and be safe\", said Ingrid. Juni smiled with relief when it seemed his parents were not going to ask so many questions. He loved them to death, but sometimes they could be a little nosy. He drank the remainder of his juice, looked at his watch, which now could actually tell time, kissed his parents' good bye, and headed to the treehouse with the Heli-pad. He climbed into the one-person craft and in seconds was airborne. Next stop the Toymaker Juni thought…[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: Contact Sort of: Wow Demetra thought to herself, Game Over sure has changed a lot recently. She was beginning to notice more and more of the game disappearing. She did not have an honest reason why it was happening, but she predicted it was a sign that the game might be going into permanent shut down mode soon. She shivered a bit because she had no idea what that meant for her. In fact, since all the parts of the game were programs such as herself, she even was wondering to a degree why she had not disappeared yet. Not that she was complaining, but she did know whether she admitted it to herself or not when the game did finally disappear she would go with it, nothing more than data at that point. Demetra was sitting in one of the abandoned cars on the Mega Race racecourse. To be more specific, she was sitting in the car that she had been driving on the final stretch of the track where she tried to rip Juni's car apart. She marveled at even with her best efforts, Juni won the race on a hubcap. Thinking back on it now, Demetra wished she had not been quite so mean to Juni during the race, but being a fierce competitor as it was built into her programming, she was angry at him for beating her in the robot arena. It had cost her a lot of life, but it did not end mattering, because Juni ended up giving her his extra health pack, which actually restored her to full health. Demetra was so caught up in her thoughts, it took her a moment to realize the rumbling sound now getting louder. She looked up in shock and saw mega race disappearing before her eyes. First one car than another simply falling away into particles, she did not want that to happen to her so she hi tailed it back out of Mega Race. She just crossed back over to the safety of the robot arena, and she looked over her shoulder the entire Mega Race level vanished. In its place now was just a black empty space. Once she had caught her breath, Demetra began to speak out loud to herself. \"First unwinnable Level 5, then lava mountain, now Mega Race, at this rate it will not be long before all the levels are gone, and me with them.\" Fighting down that vision of Mega Race vanishing into oblivion, Demetra took some time to take in her surroundings. As she thought she was in the Robot arena. She scanned the remains of many battle bots. There was a blue one with its arm chopped off, a red one, missing a leg, a pink one with extensive damage in the upper chest region, and finally a black one still sitting in a heap of twisted metal and spare parts. Demetra looked at each of these in turn remembering her many victories in the arena. But finally her eyes settled on a yellow bot still standing tall and proud, \"Juni's battle bot\", Demetra said. She stared at it for a while remembering how even, though, he was a terrible fighter through the first two rounds, he came back to defeat her in the third. Demetra walked over to Juni's battle bot and climbed on. It immediately responded. She performed a few quick moves, before deciding she preferred her own battle bot. Jumping off Juni's bot, which instantly froze in place, she began to scan for her purple battle bot, the one that led her to countless victories. She really had to look hard, but finally tucked in behind some repair bots, she saw the familiar light purple color. She immediately began running toward her bot. Launching herself high into the air she landed smoothly atop the bot. \"Oh that is more like it\", Demetra stated as she began putting her old faithful bot through its motions. She was about halfway through her exercises when something made her pause. At first she could not figure out what had caused this pause, but she knew she was definitely not imagining it. \"I must be going crazy\", she exclaimed because I could swear that what I am hearing is Juni's voice. Demetra tried to use the sensible part of her programming to explain this event, but common sense and sensibility seemed to have abandoned her. Just as soon as it started, though, the voice faded. This would fit Demetra's conclusion that the voice was just a made up idea in her head, probably brought on by intensive thoughts about missing Juni. She hopped off her battle bot, deciding she needed a place to think clearly and with less noise than the robot arena provided. She began walking toward the green fields, and that was when she heard it again a voice, but this time it was clearer. It was saying \"Demetra, Demetra, are you out there somewhere\"? Demetra froze she knew beyond a shadow of a doubt it was Juni's voice, but how to get to him, and where is he. Demetra realized it did not matter she was going to find Juni. Hearing the voice once again pleading, she took off in a run, following the voice…[Chapter 5] Chapter Five: Getting Closer: Juni was flying fast, the world below him was going by in a blur as he pushed the one-person helicopter even faster. His destination was the OSS, and according to his readouts, he was still a good thirty minutes away. Deciding that he was going fast enough, Juni pressed a button and locked the auto pilot in that the desired speed. Now that Juni no longer had to pilot and steer the helicopter, he could put his thoughts in order as he prepared for his meeting with the Toymaker. Juni was still surprised that he was going to meet with the Toymaker. Six months ago the Toymaker was almost responsible with enslaving the entire youth of the world with mind control and bringing the world to its knees. Now he was working for the OSS, as a computer technician writing programs to protect the nations secrets. Only two months after the Toymaker began employment the President of the United States himself came to congratulate the Toymaker, calling his work a \"major step\" toward absolute safety. Juni was present at this gathering as was his sister because the President also wanted to thank the two siblings for once again defying the odds to save the world. There was one more person present and Juni found himself smiling with pride as he remembered his Grandpa also there to receive a congratulation from the President. Thinking back on it now, Juni mused his Grandpa was the whole reason the Toymaker was now working for the OSS not against. It was because of his Grandpa finding it in his heart to forgive the Toymaker for the mistake of paralyzing Grandpa that finally called the Toymaker back to the side of good. Juni was so caught up in his thoughts he did not realize how close he was to his destination. \"five minutes to destination\", the automated helicopter voice said. Juni took control once again as the OSS building came into view. Taking the joy stick he gently landed the helicopter on one of the many empty pads. Climbing out, he reflected on why he was back employed at the OSS. At the conclusion of the Island of Lost Dreams mission he walked away from the OSS. He would have stayed retired except for the whole Game Over situation and his sister disappearing within the game. After they were successful in defeating the game after it entered the real world, Juni decided that rejoining the family business might be best, as much as he liked working alone, he also felt bad for breaking up the Cortez family. So here he was. But most importantly by rejoining the OSS Juni would have access to computers that surpassed his own personal laptop considerably. And for what he had in mind, his laptop would not have the power necessary to turn his \"project\" into a reality. After making his way into the main area of the OSS, Juni flashed his badge and asked the receptionist \"I have a meeting with the Toymaker, where is he?\", \"Computer and Tech Center\", the receptionist replied. \"thank you\", Juni said. Juni found one of the carts employees of the OSS travel around on, and soon located Computer and Tech Center. He parked the cart and went to the door. \"identification please\" Juni swiped his OSS badge under the scanner \"Juni Cortez Level 2 spy, you are clear to enter.\" The door opened and Juni walked in. Inside he heard the Toymaker talking to himself. \"But what if an enemy tries a cyberattack from a cellphone? I need a program that can detect anomalies on cell phones.\" The Toymaker looked up and saw Juni standing there. \"Hello Juni\", how have you been? \"Good Sebastian, how about yourself?\" \"Cannot complain\", the Toymaker replied. \"So I hear you have been working on a secret project\", the Toymaker said after a moment. \"Yes\", Juni replied. \"I am trying to create another person who lives in cyberspace, then try to bring them into the real world.\" \"Let me guess the Toymaker said, \"If you are successful at bringing a person you created out of cyberspace into the real world, you will then try to bring Demetra into the real world.\" \"Right\", Juni answered \"is it that obvious?\" \"No, it was more something I observed when you were the game, you and her shared an instant connection said the Toymaker.\" The Toymaker got up from his computer and walked over to another one, \"I sort of figured this was what you were going to need help with, so I already started the process. The first thing we need to do is figure out if Demetra is even still in the game.\" Juni looked at the monitor. \"Look familiar, you are looking at the remains of Game Over\", said the Toymaker. It has certainly had gotten smaller Juni observed. As if reading his thoughts, the Toymaker continued by saying \"the game looks smaller because more and more of it is shutting down, until the final shutdown and deactivation in about nine months.\" \"But, now back to business, if Demetra is still in the game she should be able to make contact with us, sort of like a video chat on skype. Use this microphone and we will see if she responds.\" Juni took the microphone and called out \"Demetra, Demetra, are you out there somewhere\"? Juni waited a few minutes after hearing nothing, then again he called out \"Demetra\", now all Juni could do was pray and wait…[Chapter 6] Chapter Six: Contact for Real: Demetra was full on running, she had never run this fast before in her life, but then again until this point she always knew how much time she had in any mission she undertook in the game. But the game was long over, this was as close to real life as she had ever been, and more importantly the person she was running toward was someone who was truly living real life. She had left the robot arena far behind, and as she continued to sprint in the direction where she heard Juni's voice she realized she was approaching the end of the moon level. Now normally when she wanted to travel to the green fields with the targets she simply allowed herself to float, because she knew eventually she would reach the fields. However, in this case she wanted to get to the fields as quickly as possible. As the end of moon flashed into view, she gathered all her strength and leapt from the surface. However instead of floating, she felt herself rocketing toward the fields. As she began getting closer and closer, her suit was catching on fire. Luckily the suits were designed to be fire resistant, but she still felt the intense heat as she fell and entered the atmosphere of the green fields. She was going so fast she realized, she wondered what would happen when she landed in the field. She only had to wait a few seconds to find out. Demetra hit the field with such force, it made a gigantic hole in the field and a spray of dirt and grass flew into the air. She tumbled for a few moments before coming to a rest on her back. She looked up at the sky for a few moments, but then suddenly jumped up when she remembered why she wanted to get to this field so fast in the first place. She took off running again trying to also figure out in her mind how she was going to find Juni. At least she thought because the game was getting smaller it was easier to navigate. Just as she left the field behind and somehow found herself back at the beginning of the city she heard his voice again, this time it was short \"Demetra\", she could hear both the urgency and the longing in his voice. She thought, what the hell, maybe if I speak out he will hear me. \"Juni I hear you! where are you?\" After waiting a few moments then a minute, then two minutes she heard nothing. She was starting to lose hope and the feelings of going crazy and not actually hearing his voice. However just as she was about to turn back and head back to the robot arena. She heard Juni's voice once again. \"Sorry Demetra, the connection cut out for a bit, and we had to reset it.\" Without even acknowledging his response, the only thing she heard was \"we\". To say that Demetra had a mini panic attack inside her, was an understatement. She already felt her heart breaking. Ironic given the fact she was not supposed to be able to feel. She made a mental note this was another example of her defying her programing. After getting her heart under control she said to Juni \"who is we?\" \"Me and the Toymaker\", Juni replied. The name \"Toymaker\" made her blood boil. \"So the Toymaker is with you in the real world?\" \"Yes\", said Juni. \"He abandoned me to the black pit of this game\", Demetra screamed, \"Yes and no\", said Juni. \"It is complicated, but get to my location or as close as you can and I will explain everything, I promise!\" Demetra did not bother responding, but rather took off at an even faster pace. She was running so fast at this point; her feet were barely touching the ground. As she flew toward the very beginning of the game, she was trying to put her thoughts in order. Juni was calling out to her. The Toymaker somehow made it into the real world, and she intended to have words with him about leaving his creation- her behind in the wreckage of Game Over, but she really cared about picking the Toymaker's brain about one thing in particular, if he was able to transport himself out of cyberspace into the real world, why couldn't she? She was still running so fast, she failed to see a door right in front of her. She ran full force into the door, and was thrown back as the metal absorbed the energy from her body. She fell flat on her back. Now that she was stopped she approached the door again, but this time walked up to it. She saw a button on the door, and pressed it. The door opened. It was just a mess of programs and numbers running by. With faith, though, she called out into this new opening \"Juni I think I have gone as far as I can go\". Almost instantly she heard Juni's voice, but that was not what caught her attention. She heard his response, but more importantly saw his face. \"Demetra\" Juni said, \"you made it!\" Demetra saw the biggest grin appear on his face, which mirrored her own. \"So what do we do now Juni?\" \"Let me tell you what I have in mind\", he said… ","Summary":" Chapter One: Feeling Lost: Juni Cortez sighed as he sat down at his computer to check his email.

La cual tiene la misma edad de Cecil y Rebecca. Lo que paso... Gary: hola Carmen, para que me llamastes. Carmen: tenemos que hablar. Gary: de que. Carmen: de lo que paso aquella noche. Gary: te gusto. Carmen: si, pero bueno… Gary: que pasa, no me digas que estas embarazada. Carmen:- se puso a llorar- si, es por eso. Gary: que creí que usastes protección. Carmen: esa también fue tu responsabilidad. Gary: ahora es mi culpa. Carmen: fue de los dos, ahora debemos estar juntos en esto. Gary: querrás decir tu sola. Carmen: como me puedes dejar por esto. Gary: lo lamento, pero soy un espía y no puedo hacer esto. Carmen: como puedes hacerme esto. Gary: lo lamento. Luego de eso se fue dejando a Carmen sola llorando. En la actualidad... La hija de Carmen se llama Keisi tiene la misma edad de Cecil y Rebecca, la chica tiene un cabello largo color cafe, ojos color miel. Un día la llevo al día de campo que tenía la familia Cortes y Wilson para que la conocieran ya que solo sabían de ella Gregorio, Ingrid y Juni Carmen: hola chicos. Todos: hola Carmen. Cecil: Carmen quién es ella. Carmen: chicos quiero que conozcan a alguien ella es Keisi. Es mi… hija. Marissa: que jamás me contaste que tenias una hija. Carmen: si, nadie sabia, solo mamá, papá y Juni. Rebecca: hola soy Rebecca y el es mi hermano Cecil. Keisi: es un gusto- dijo susurrando. Cecil: deja la timidez, quieres ir a jugar con nosotros. Keisi: uh…bueno… esque. Carmen: ve, no te preocupes. Keisi: esta bien. Cecil: vamos- dijo agarrándola de la mano. Keisi: bien, que jugamos. Rebecca: que tal… juguemos a lanzar el disco volador. Sabes jugar?. Keisi: si, me encanta ese juego. Cecil: bien, entonces empecemos.- dijo lanzando el disco. Mientras con los demás... Marissa: de quien es hija a pesar de ti. Carmen: es de Gary. Juni: yo te advirti de el pero no, tu siempre de necia. Carmen: Juni entendieron el punto. Además no hace falta de que lo menciones. Marissa: te dejo sola. Carmen: si me dijo de que era un espía ese no era su deber. Marissa: ja, yo fui espía y tenía a mi hija y eso no afecto nada. Carmen: si, pero sabes como es. Otra vez con los chicos... Cecil: y dime tienes amigos. Keisi: la verdad no, solo ustedes. Rebecca: no eres muy sociable. Keisi: no. Cecil: eres mini espía también. Keisi: no, no se que pasaría si fuera mini espía, ustedes deben serlo. Cecil: si, desde cuando sabes que tu mamá fue mini espía. Keisi: ella me lo dijo, dice que es una larga descendencia de mini espías de que vengo, dice que mi padre también fue mini espía. Cecil: enserio. Keisi: si, pero no se nada sobre el. Rebecca: te gustaría serlo algún día. Keisi: tal vez, no se. Cecil: bueno si decides serlo nos tienes a nosotros para ayudarte. Keisi: gracias. Mientras en otro lado del parque... Gerti: ahí esta, no esta sola, esta con los dos mini espías Cecil y Rebecca. Gary: bien, es hora de que hagas lo que tienes que hacer. Gerti: auch que es esto- dijo ya que el disco le pegó en la cabeza. Rebecca: hey chicos esta por estos arbustos. Gerti: oigan, estos es de ustedes. Cecil: si, gracias. Gerti. de nada, soy Gerti. Rebecca: un gusto. Mientras con lo demás... Carmen: creo que seria mejor ir por ellos. Marissa: si. Juni: oh oh. Carmen: que pasa. Juni: acaso es Gerti. Carmen: oh oh, que querrá. Marissa: mejor vallamos. Gary: hola niños. Cecil. quien es usted?. Gary: yo soy Gary soy hermano de Gerti. Carmen:que haces aquí?. Gary: ah, hola Carmen hace muchos años de que no te veo. Carmen: que quieres. Gary: solo vengo por mi hija. Keisi: que, mamá de que esta hablando. Gary: ha no sabes quien soy. Carmen: el es tu papá Keisi. Cecil: aguarda el agente Gary es el padre de Keisi. Carmen: si, pero no se que quieres con ella ya que recuerdo de que me dejaste. Gary: si pero tengo derecho a verla. Así que ella viene conmigo. Carmen;: no te la llevara. Que quieres de ella. Gary: ahora es momento de que ella este conmigo. Carmen: jamás hazme lo que quieras hacer con ella. Gary: no, Gerti. Gerti: te tengo. Carmen: suéltala. Keisi pudo safarse de ella con una técnica de ataque. Cecil: desde cuando haces eso. Keisi: practico karate. Marissa: chicos corran. Rebecca: vamos- dijo corriendo. Los chicos corrieron pero se escondieron detrás de un árbol y vieron que los demás se los llevo Gary. Keisi: no. Cecil: debemos rescatarlos. Continuará...[Chapter 2] Keisi: como exactamente. Rebecca: somos mini espías podemos, y con tu ayuda… Keisi: espera, yo no soy mini espía como ustedes. Cecil: te enseñaremos- dijo agarrándola de la mano entrelazando sus manos. Keisi: gracias. Rebecca: entonces a la OSS. En la OSS... Keisi: guao. Cecil: tu mamá nunca te trajo aquí. Keisi: nunca. Cecil: ven debes cambiarte. Entraron en el cuarto de armas para escojerlas y se cambiaran para la misión. Cecil: Rebecca no crees que sea raro que Carmen no le enseñara nada del espionaje, ya que eso esta en su sangre. Rebecca: si, quien sabe, seguro algún pariente de Gary trabaje aquí. Cambiando de tema te gusta. Cecil: que?, no no me gusta. Rebecca: estas seguro, porque ahora la agarraste de la mano y entrelazastes tus dedos con los de ella. Cecil: ella no conoce esto. Keisi: oigan como me queda- dijo viendo como le quedaba (los chicos tienen 13). Cecil: guao, te ves hermosa- dijo sin quitarle los ojos de encima. Keisi: gracias. Rebecca: punto para mi- le dijo susurrando a Cecil. Argonauta: si, estoy deacuerdo. Keisi: acaso estoy loca o ese perro hablo. Cecil: tranquila yo estuve así cuando nos dimos cuenta. Argonauta: dame la mano. Keisi temblorosamente se la dio y se le solto el brazo al perro y dio un fuerte grito. Cecil: tranquila es normal. Keisi: como es normal le arranque la pata. Cecil: tranquila. Keisi: esta bien. Mientras en un lugar secreto... Carmen: donde estamos. Gary: sorpresa se acuerdan de esta isla. Juni: aquí vive Romero. Gary: exacto. Marissa: aguarda quien es Romero. Juni: un amigo de nosotros, inventor. Carmen: que quieres. Me dejastes durante 13 años sola con mi hija y vuelves por ella que quieres. Gary: solo que ella ya no este cerca tuyo, jamás le mostraste la OSS, porque ella no formaba parte del grupo de mini espías. Carmen: ella ha estado sola tiene un problema. Gary: vaya será fácil secuestrarla. Marissa: no lo creo con mis hijos con ella no te dejaran. Gary: que lo intenten. En la OSS... Rebecca: bien prueba esto- dijo dándole un par de manos para poder escalar. Keisi: bien,funcionan- dijo pegada en el techo. De pronto bajo de un salto. Cecil: si, el punto es de un adhesivo muy fuerte- dijo poniendo la mano en el aparato sin percatar quedar pegado- oh oh. Keisi: ahh, Rebecca ayuda. Rebecca: Cecil como se te ocurre poner la mano. Cecil: bueno vas a ayudarnos o a peliar. Rebecca se le acerca a Cecil y le susurra- pero tienes que darle un beso- dijo picara mente. Cecil: desde cuando estas loca. Rebecca: por lo menos en la mejilla. Cecil se acerco para darle un beso en la mejilla aunque no se percato que Keisi volteo la cabeza y le dio un beso en los labios. Cecil no hallaba que hacer aunque sus labios eran suaves y dulces. Keisi correspondió al beso. No querían que el momento acabará pero por falta de aire lo hicieron, ambos estaban muy rojos. Cecil: perdoname no quería hacerlo. Argonauta: enserio parecías que lo…- en ese momento Rebecca me tapó la boca. Keisi: solo no hagas eso otra vez. Cecil:esta bien- dijo con la cabeza abajo. Rebecca:listo- dijo ya que los había liberado- vamos debemos saber su dirreción. Cecil y Keisi caminaban sin decirse nada. Rebecca: me impresionastes no creí que la besarías en los labios. Cecil: fue un error, volteo la cabeza y sin querer puse mis labios junto los de ella. Rebecca:vi que lo disfrustaste, creo que ella también. Cecil: no se. Argonauta: chicos encontré en donde están. Rebecca:dinos. Argonauta: están en una isla lejana y secreta muy difícil de raestrar. Cecil: bien veremos a ver como llegaremos ahí. En la isla… Carmen: espero que estén bien. Marissa: tranquila. Gary: Juni tu vendrás conmigo. Juni: esta bien si quieres pelear. Gary: no es eso. Vas a venir.- dijo llevándoselo a una habitación y enserrandolo. Xx: Juni.- dijo una voz femenina conocida. Cuando volteo no creyó a quien estaba viendo. Juni: Demetra. Continuará…[Chapter 3] Juni no podía dejar de verla, estaba un poco más grande y tenía su cuerpo desarrollado haciéndola más atractiva. Juni: creí que no existías. Demetra: lo se, pero si soy real. Juni: cambiastes, te ves muy diferente. Demetra: si, lo se- dice acercándose.- tu también, te ves muy atractivo. Juni: creí que jamás te volvería a ver. Demetra: yo también, pero estamos juntos.- dijo abrazando su cuello para darle un beso. Juni la abrazo por la cintura acercándola a el para profundizar el beso. Demetra bajo sus manos hacía su camiseta para desabotonar los botones... Mientras con los chicos... Cecil: bien creo que podremos llegar.- dijo subiendo al submarino. Rebecca: seguro,no queremos llegar al lugar equivocado. Cecil: si. Keisi estas bien. Keisi no dijo nada. Rebecca: estas bien. Keisi: solo espero que estén bien. Rebecca: yo también. Cecil: entonces vamos. Las dos subieron y se fueron. Rebecca: oye Keisi, te pasa algo. Keisi: solo, esque… no puedo dejar de pensar en el beso que me dio Cecil. Rebecca: si, yo no creía. Te gusta mi hermano. Keisi: no, claro que no. Rebecca: entonces porque correspondistes. Keisi: bien, si me gusta, pero no se lo digas a nadie, mucho menos a el. Rebecca:esta bien. Keisi: gracias. Mientras en el escondite... Carmen: me preocupa que los chicos vengan a esta isla, ellos no saben lo que pasa en la isla. Marissa: que pasa. Carmen: aquí vive un cientifico, que tiene animales mezclados grandes sueltos. Marissa: debo preocuparme. Carmen: no creo que les hagan daño. Marissa: tal vez, son mini espías podrán con ellos. Gerty: hola Carmen Carmen: Gerty que le pasa a tu hermano. Gerty: el solo quiere ver a su hija ya que no la ve desde hace muchos años. Carmen: el me abandonó y se que quiere hacerle daño porque jamás volvió. Gary: tal vez si, tal vez no. Los chicos van a venir por ustedes.- dijo yendose con Gerty. Carmen:-con su reloj llamo a Romero- Romero me escuchas soy Carmen Cortez necesito que si ves a dos niñas y un niño en la isla son parte de la OSS, por favor no dejes que nada les pase, gracias. Romero: esta bien Carmen. Mientras en la habitación... Ambos estaban en la cama desnudos, Juni abría los ojos y vio a Demetra a la par de el abrazada a el. Juni: Demetra, despierta. Demetra: que, que pasa. Juni: sería mejor levantarnos alguien nos puede ver así. Demetra: y? Juni: por favor alguien viene y nos ve, las cosas no podrían estar bien. Demetra: bueno- dijo levantándose. Ambos se vistieron y se quedaron sentados. Mientras con los chicos… Cecil: aquí es. Rebecca: bien hecho. Keisi: oigan alguien vive aquí. Cecil: eso ya lo veremos.- dijo saliendo. Cuando salieron vieron a Romero. Romero: hola chicos. Cecil: quién es usted?. Romero: soy Romero vivo en esta isla, soy amigo de los agentes Carmen y Juni Cortez. Keisi: cononces a mi madre. Romero: eres hija de Carmen. Keisi: si. Cecil: y usted desde cuando los conoce. Romero: desde que son pequeños, Carmen me llamó y dijo que los cuidara por mientras, vengan s mi laboratorio. Continuará…[Chapter 4] En el laboratorio… Cecil: entonces, usted a vivido aquí durante toda su vida. Romero: si chico, he trabajo con inventos durante toda mi vida. Rebecca: y eso no es peligroso. Romero: no. Los chicos veían las cosas del laboratorio, se sorprendieron cuando vieron una pequeña casita. Keisi: que es esto?. Romero: eso es mi granja de animales mezclados- dijo sacando de la caja a los animales. Rebecca: que raros. Romero: si, soy un científico loco, que hasta algunos son gigantes. Keisi: que quiere decir? Romero: bueno hice un suero de crecimiento y se lo derrame a todos los animales mezclados y son gigantes que viven en esta isla. Cecil: sueltos. Romero: si, pero no hacen daño. Rebecca: tienes alguna idea en donde esta Carmen. Romero: me llamo nada más no se donde este, pero… puedo rastrear donde fue la llamada. Cecil: enserio puedes hacerlo. Romero: hey soy científico puedo hacerlo. Están en la cueva cerca del volcán. Keisi: dime que el volcán esta dormido. Romero: no ha estado algo activo. Rebecca: vamos. Romero: no, no pueden ir. Cecil: porque. Romero: es muy peligroso. Mientras en la cueva… Gary: quedate con tu hermana y tía. Carmen: Juni estas bien. Juni: si tranquilas, saben algo de los chicos. Carmen: si, que están en esta isla. Le avise a Romero que los cuidará, es muy peligroso por aquí. Juni: no lo creo. Carmen: Juni con costos nosotros sobrevivimos aquí, no sabemos si ellos podrán. Marissa: no se si preocuparme o que. De pronto sintieron un temblor. Marissa: que fue eso. Juni: temblo. Carmen: en que lugar de la isla estamos. Juni: en una cueva cercana al volcán. Carmen: ese volcán podría hacer erupción. Marissa: espero que no suceda. En el laboratorio… Keisi: que fue eso. Romero: tembló, el volcán debe estar activo. Cecil: debemos rescatarlos rápido, el volcán podría hacer explosión en cualquier momento. Rebecca: pero la cueva esta cerca del volcán. Keisi: mientras que no pase nada, podremos hacerlo. Romero: bien pero tengan cuidado con los animales. Rebecca:entendido. Vamos.- le dijo a los chicos saliendo del laboratorio.- tenemos que tener cuidado, podría haber ceniza. Cecil: tal vez o lava. Keisi: no ha echo erupción desde hace muchos años. Cecil: tal vez solo esta liberando material. Rebecca: debemos apurarnos. En la cueva… Gary: valla, no creí que en estos días el volcán estaba activo. Juni: quieres matarnos. Gary: no, pero el volcán lo sabrá. Por cierto los chicos ya están en la isla. Marissa: no les pasará nada. Espero. Carmen: yo también. Juni: scon mini espías, lo lograrán. Carmen: pero Keisi nunca fue entrenada. Juni: tranquila, Cecil y Rebecca no pasaron por lo mismo. Ten fe, ellos lo lograran. Carmen: cierto. Continuará… Felices pascuas de resurrección :). Espero que les haya gustado, saludos...[Chapter 5] Cecil: bien, según el GPS, están por aquí. Rebecca: espero que estés en lo cierto. Keisi: vamos. Los 3 iban entrando a la caverna, pero Keisi estaba algo temorosa. Cecil: estas bien. Keisi: solo estoy, algo nerviosa. Cecil: porque. Keisi: esque… jamás he hecho esto y si sale todo mal. Cecil: tranquila- dijo abrazándola- todo va a estar bien. Keisi: esta bien.- dijo dándole un beso en el cachete. Rebecca:hey tórtolos vamos. Ambos siguieron caminando por la caverna. Cecil: no entiendo deberían estar por aquí. Xx: esto es una trampa- dijo dejando salir una nube de gas dejándolos inconscientes. Cuando despertaron estaban encerrados. Rebecca: donde estamos. Gary: sorpresa chicos, como se sienten. Cecil: como caímos en esta trampa. Rebecca: aam, tal vez deberías decirle eso al GPS. Gary: eso no funciona aquí, verán Romero siempre bloquea las cosas que pueden servir de rastreo. Cecil: por que. Gary: el dijo de que en esta isla suceden cosas raras. Keisi: bueno eso es cierto. Gary: en fin, miren quien nos acompañan.- dijo metiendo a Carmen, Juni y Marissa.- Ahí están, para que se despidan de ellos. Keisi: mamá- dijo dando le un abrazo a Carmen. Carmen: estas bien. Keisi: si. Cecil y Rebecca: Marissa. Marissa: chicos están bien- dijo abrazandolos. Cecil y Rebecca: si. Keisi: tío- le dijo a Juni dándole un abrazo. Gary: tienen tiempo.- dijo llendose. Carmen: no podemos quedarnos aquí- dijo algo preocupada. Marissa: entonces, como vamos a salir de aquí. Carmen: no lo se. Juni: y apuesto a que Romero bloqueo la señal. Rebecca: tal vez, Cecil puedes ver como podemos salir o si hay una llave o algo. Cecil: lo lamento, he tratado pero no funciona- dijo tratando de encender la pulsera. Juni: entonces si bloqueo la señal. Carmen: genial, y ahora que vamos hacer?. Marissa: pensar?. Juni: tal vez. Nadie sabía que hacer hasta que alguien abrió una puerta por el piso. Xx: hey, por aquí. Juni: Demetra que haces. Demetra: quieren salir o quieren quedarse para que se lleven a los chicos. Juni: vamos- les dijo para que salieran y justo a tiempo. Gary:hey no escapen. Todos bajaron y salieron de ahí. Carmen: enserio existes. Demetra: si me vez en la vida real, pues ovbiamente. Cecil: como sabías que estabamos ahí?. Demetra: bueno esque estaba ayudando a Gary, pero después de ver sus planes decidí ayudarlos. Juni: me mentistes otra vez. Demetra: solo escuchame. Juni: te creí, te di otra oportunidad, hasta hicimos el amor y… Carmen: wow, que acabas de decir?. Demetra: escuchame Juni, estoy embarazada. Continuará…[Chapter 6] Juni: disculpa, que acabas de decir? Demetra: si, estoy embarazada. Carmen: sabes algo... así mas o menos fue la expresión de Gary cuando se lo dije. Demetra: tienes una hija? Carmen: si, es ella Keisi. Keisi: hola, creo que los adultos tienen que hablar. Cecil: si saben, vamos a buscar la manera de salir de aquí. Marissa: creo que los que necesitarían hablar son Juni y Demetra, si. Carmen: bien, no tarden mucho, Gary ya puede estar buscandonos. Juni: okey. Todos se fueron dejando a Juni y Demetra solos. Juni: ahora podemos hablar. Demetra: lo siento, yo temía mucho cuando me di cuenta de que Gary estaba planeando algo con los niños y cuando me di cuenta de mi embarazo tenía mucho miedo y si te decía me daba miedo de que me rechazaras como Gary rechazo a Carmen. Juni: yo no soy como Gary, te amo- le dio un beso corto en los labios- y no te voy a dejar, pero debemos irnos antes de que Gary nos encuentre. Demetra: tienes razón. Juni: vamos. En la costa de la isla… Cecil: bien, por aquí esta el submarino. Marissa: bien pero veo que tiene unos golpes. Rebecca: aah, somos niños, no genios en usar submarinos. En eso siento un fuerte temblor. Keisi: guao, miren el volcán parece que esta lanzando ceniza. Carmen: si debemos apurarnos, puede hacer erupción. En el bosque… Gerti: vaya, pudieron huir. Juni: Gerti, tu también apoyas a Gary con esto. Gerti: si, es mi hermano, porque no. Juni: bueno, el esta loco, el quiere hacerle algo a mi sobrina. Gerti: hey, para tu información ella también es mi sobrina. Gary: tranquila, ahora entregesen. Juni: no dejare que te lleves ami sobrina y a mis primos. Gary: bien, lo ahoran por las malas. Juni: Demetra vete y avisale a los demás y escapen de aquí. Demetra: Juni, no luchare contigo. Empezaron a peliar con fuerza. Al final pudieron derrotar a Gary y a Gerti. Otro temblor. Juni: vamos. Ambos corrieron a la playa de la isla. Demetra: debemos irnos. Marissa: bien esta listo. Carmen: vamos. Gary: no iran a ningun lado. Otro temblor pero salía más ceniza. Carmen: Gary esto es suficiente, no le estas haciendo daño a nadie, solo a ti. Gary: dame a la niña. Carmen: no, Keisi entra al submarino, ya voy. Keisi: mamá, no... Carmen: hazme caso. Carmen: lo resolveremos entre nosotros. Gary: bien. Ambos estaban luchando pero a Carmen le costaba mucho, de hecho casi termina perdiendo pero lo logro. En solo unos minutos el volcán hizo erupción. Marissa: Carmen vamos. Carmen subio lo más rápido posible y pudieron salir de ahí. Carmen: todos están bien. Todos: si. Keisi: mamá- corre y la abraza. Carmen: tranquila aquí estoy, eres mi mini espía. Cecil: creeme fue muy valiente. Juni: lo tienes en la sangre. Keisi: gracias tío- dijo dándole un abrazo. 3 meses después… Después de lo ocurrido, Juni y Demetra decidieron casarse para criar a su hijo. Sacerdote: queridos hermanos estsmos aquí reunidos por la unión de Juni y Demetra. Demetra, aceptas a Juni como tu esposo, compañero de vida, en la salud y en la enfermedad, en la riqueza y la pobreza y hasta que la muerte los separe. Demetra: si, acepto. Sacerdote: Juni tu aceptas a Demetra como tu esposa, tu compañera de vida, en la salud y en la enfermedad, en la riqueza y en la pobreza y hasta que la muerte los separe. Juni: acepto. Sacerdote: ahora los anillos. Después de ponerse los anillos el sacerdote dijo \"puede besar a la novia\" hubieron aplausos. Se hizo una pequeña fiesta familiar. Carmen: estoy orgullosa de ti, eres un gran hombre y serás un gran padre y un gran esposo, cuida bien de ella. Juni: claro que lo haré. En una parte de la fiesta pusieron una canción lenta para las parejas y para los esposos. Rebecca: invitala a bailar. Cecil: que? no se. Rebecca: ve. Cecil se armo de valor para decirle. Cecil: oye Keisi… me preguntaba si… quieres bailar conmigo.- dijo ofreciendo su mano. Keisi: si, claro- dijo agarrando su mano y se puso de pie para ir a bailar. Ambos se pusieron en posición, y empezaron a bailar. Cecil: bailas bien. Keisi: no bailas mal. Cecil: oye yo lo lamento por el beso de hace tres meses. Keisi: no, te preocupes, además fue hace tres meses. Nunca se me olvida como fue, tu por error pusiste la mano y… Cecil: se pego junto a la mía- dijo acercandose a ella. Y volvieron a besarse en un beso tierno y suave. Cecil: perdon…-fue interrumpido por Keisi que puso un dedo en su boca. Keisi: calmate… me gustas. Cecil: y a mi también me gustas.- dijo dándole otro beso. 6 meses después… Después de los seis meses Cecil y Keisi eran novios, también fue el nacimiento del hijo de Juni y Demetra, el cual es un niño y lo llamaron Adam. Keisi inicio a trabajar en la OSS junto a Cecil y Rebecca. Y siguieron así. Fin… Hola! Bueno este es el final de la historia gracias a quienes lo leyeron.

La cual tiene la misma edad"},{"Movie":"Spy Kids","Title":"Pixelated Princess","Author":"Exmoorpony","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6719411","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Welcome to the new story, Pixelated Princess. If you haven't already read it, I suggest you read the story Pixelated Pixie. This is the sequel and it relies on that previous story quite heavily at times. Demetra yawned and swung her legs out of bed. Today was the debriefing for the mission. As she brushed her hair, she thought about the title. The Memory Mission. What could it be about? She slipped on an apricot-coloured t-shirt and some green khakis before walking from the room. In the dining room, she was met by pure chaos, as usual. The people were calm, but everything else wasn't. Newspapers were strewn across the table and a box of Froot Loops was busily spilling its contents onto the oak hardwood. Demetra laughed. A regular day at the Cortez house. She righted the box and poured some Cheerios into a red ceramic bowl. After fetching a spoon from the drawer, she poured milk on her cereal and started eating as she wondered where everyone was. Then she heard Juni scream and she was worried until he came running down the stairs, chased by his shirtless father. Gregorio Cortez didn't look happy, that's for sure. Juni ran for the bathroom and she heard the lock click, followed by a wagging tongue. Juni's father headed back upstairs and Juni peeked out of the door cautiously. \"Is he gone?\" Demetra nodded and he gave a sigh of relief before sitting down at the table and pouring himself some Froot Loops. Dem couldn't help but scold him. \"You DO know those things have, like, a kazillion preservatives and they could last 'til man lands on Pluto, right?\" \"That's an interesting way of putting it. If they're so bad, why is half the box empty, smarty-pants?\" Dem pointed at the floor. \"They were spilling onto the floor when I came down. Your Jack Russell, Zip, refused to eat them, I'll have you know.\" Juni made a mock pouty face and looked at his floppy-eared pup. \"Whose side are YOU on anyway, Zip? Hers or mine?\" Zip cocked his head to the side before going to sit beside Demetra and they both laughed hard, Dem arching her eyebrows and smiling. \"I guess I know where his loyalties lie, huh? By the way Juni, what DID you do to make your dad so angry?\" \"I switched his cologne for apple juice and he realized that he was going to work smelling like a fruit stand!\" Dem tried desperately not to smile and to give her boyfriend a stern look, but she failed miserably. That WAS a pretty good trick. Shortly after they finished breakfast, Gregorio and Ingrid came down, both of them in snazzy black suits. Juni was dressed in a forest green hoodie and light blue jeans though, so Dem didn't look completely out of place. Two muffins were grabbed by the parents before we all walked out of the door to the gray sedan. They arrived at the OSS headquarters not too much later. Juni and Demetra walked to the junior agent building, parting ways with his parents. Soon, tehy reached the orange door marked DEBRIEFING. There was a huge TV screen and five chairs in the room. One of them was already occupied by the junior OSS coordinator, Gabriella Grantley. Her younger brother was vice-director of the OSS, but Gabriella had chosen to work with the kids. Juni and Dem sat down to wait. And wait. And wait. AND wait. Finally, as Gabriella tapped her watch with her manicured nails, I took out my phone and texted her. (DeeDee = Dem, JoGo = Josephine) DeeDee: where r u? JoGo: breaky DeeDee: debriefing NOW JoGo: **** 2day? start w/o me! DeeDee: k Dem put her phone back into her pocket. \"She'll be here as soon as she can, but she says to go on without her.\" Gabriella nodded before proceeding with the operation. \"So far, you've only heard the name of the mission. It's the Memory Mission, but it's so much more. This will be dangerous, but the OSS has faith in your abilities.\" Juni spoke up. \"Is this safe enough for level 1s?\" \"For you three it is. You'll go in altogether. We've sent three agents to the location so far. Each of them has been located later with their previous memories erased. They didn't remember anything and had other memories instead. Needless to say, they didn't have any information. By sending the trio in, we hope to gain the info that full agents couldn't obtain. Spy Kids are smaller and we hope that will give them an edge over the full-size agents. Should you accept the mission, you'd be dropped off in the Bahamas. From the beaches, you'd try to learn what you could. When you obtained that, you'd radio or email us with it. Then, depending on the info, you'll move in on them.\" The orange door suddenly opened and a flash of blue swept by. \"Sorry I'm late! I forgot debriefing was today, Ms. Grantley!\" Jo was in a blue track suit. She was breathless, but covered in smiles. Gabriella gave a wry smile. \"So glad you could join us finally, Josephine, even if your breath couldn't manage it.\" We all chuckled while Jo gave a mock pouty face. Gabriella outlined the mission again and asked the same question. \"I'll have to confer with my counterparts, Juni Cortez and Demetra Papillon, Ms. Gabriella Grantley.\" The voice was Jo's fake suave voice and Juni and I both laughed. We looked at each other and cried out in unison, \"We'll do it!\" Of course, Dem was the only one to yell 'jinx'. Juni and Jo puffed out their cheeks as she leisurely strolled through the alphabet. They weren't allowed to speak until someone said their name again. \"Let's see...Bo, Co, Do, Go, Jo!\" Jo laughed and thanked Dem as Gabriella gestured for them to leave. She handed each of the trio a sheet debriefing their mission. As they walked down the hall, Jo wondered aloud to her friends. \"Why do they need a debriefing room if they could just mail THESE? Bloody waste of resources, I tell you!\" She waved the paper in the air. Juni had his cheeks puffed out. Dem spoke, \"I'll make it easier for you. I'll deviate from the original rules. Just kiss me!\" Dem smiled as Juni leaned over and kissed her on the forehead while Jo made little coochy-coo noises. Dem glared at her and made a cylindrical shape with her hands, shaking them. \"I'll get you for that, Jo!\" \"Ha! I'd like to see you try, girl. You can't do a thing to me if you can't catch me, doofus!\" With that, the blond took off and Dem waved her hand in dismissal. \"I guess we're going to need to start packing. It says here to drop by the tech room first though. It's a good thing they provide wardrobes for us over the course of the mission. I don't think anything I have would fit in on a Bahamas beach.\" With that, Juni and Dem raced after Jo. She had obviously looked at her paper, as she was already in the tech room. Dem punched her in the arm gently. The junior OSS techie, Bo Chisel, stood in the middle of the room with a huge silver suitcase. By big, it meant that the suitcase was five feet square. Dem smiled at the geek. He was about twenty and had a whole pimple deal going on. If a pimple popped out for every chocolate a person had, Bo would be in rehab as a chocolate ADDICT. It was THAT bad. However, Dem wasn't about to ask about the pimples. She had done that once before and he had started talking about DNA, physics and the molecular structure of pimples. That had been kind of creepy! First, sorry about the slow start. Next, sorry if that apple juice prank doesn't work. I needed a prank for Juni to play though. Next, did anyone notice the tech's name is similar to Fo Sizzle? I changed it around because he's FAR from cool. I mean, YUCK! No offense to those with pimple troubles though. It just completed Bo's geek image is all.[Chapter 2] Bo clicked the latch of the giant suitcase and began talking in a surprisingly cool voice. If his looks had matched his voice, girls would flock to him. He'd be considered HOT. \"There are three layers of gadgest in this suitcase, but they're all the same. One is a computer hacking cable. It will download everything on a computer's hard drive after being in the USB port for 60 seconds. Very handy. These sneakers come in different colours for all of you. Demetra's are black and purple. Juni? Yours are red and white. Jo's are baby blue and dark blue. They're upgraded versions of the old ones the OSS used to hand out. Not only do they track one person, they can track anything that has stepped on the same ground within twenty-four hours. You select which one you want to track on what is the size tag on the normal sneaker. A small arrow appears on the farthest shoelace to show you the way to step. These are X-ray sunglasses here. They look regular, but they can see through a maximum of four trees until it finds an animal or person. Those are sequoias we're measuring. This sun-tan lotion not only serves normal purposes, but also makes you bullet resistant. Cool, huh? I left the best for last. It looks like a volleyball, but it can fly into the air and spy cam. It's remote-controlled and can be a boomerang and a net shooter. Of course, they're in high demand, as they're extremely hard to manufacture. Once the mission is done, return them. Go on! Here's a layer for each off you. File to the OSS airport sedan. They have your other stuff loaded. The manuals to operate each of the gadgets are tucked into the foam beside them. You need to start on your trip! Oh, and I know the agent types are pretty tense about it, but have fun. You're going to the Bahamas. Kick back and relax once in a while.\" They left and the sedan drove to the private plane. A few hours later, they arrived at a Bahamas resort of unknown location. The OSS had organized it so the trio wouldn't harbour grudges against the area if they encountered any resistance. Dem and Jo shared a room, but Juni had one to himself. Of course, Jo and Dem had a widescreen TV and first-class access to the gym to make up for sharing. They didn't mind either way, as they were best friends. \"Hey Dem! Let's head for the beach, girl!\" \"No thanks Go. I'm not sure what would happen to my life hair clip. I don't want to chance it.\" Jo shrugged and slipped into her red and white striped one piece bathing suit. \"How do I look, Demetra?\" \"Like a candy-cane.\" \"Does that mean you think it's sweet? Or that I'm curvy?\" \"Quit with the stupid puns. I meant you're twisted.\" \"Ha. Ha. You're HILARIOUS.\" Jo gave a huge fake smile before grabbing her red towel and heading for the beach. Dem took out her PC laptop and researched the Bermuda Triangle. Who knew if it would come in handy? A few minutes later, Jo burst through the door. \"Demetra! I have info!\" \"So soon? Okay. Why didn't you just text? Then I could e-mail the information quicker.\" \"My phone is still in my blue jogging pants. Look, do you want to hear the news or what? They've been erasing memories of people. Well, actually, it sounds like they store them for later use. Then, they usually place the empty memory's body into a different location with new memories.\" \"And you found this out HOW, Jo? Or should I even be asking this?\" Dem shook her head with a snort. Jo explained, \"You'd be surprised what you can find out by snooping in a suit guy's briefcase.\" Demetra groaned at Jo's cheerful voice. \"Jo, please tell me you didn't...\" \"Sorry. I'd be lying. The guy looked suspicious in his black suit and sunglasses. His head was bald with a tattoo on it. It was some kind of lizard saying 'Remember me: Your worst nightmare'. His muscles were huge!\" Suddenly, Juni walked in and interrupted. \"It was a gecko, Jo. You have everything right though. I saw him. He came out of the guy's bathroom in skull and crossbones swimming trunks. The skulls had Hawaiian leis around their necks.\" \"That's pronounced Ley-ee. That's so cool! Is he still out there?\" Juni smiled wryly and spoke to Jo. \"I take it your reason isn't just because the trunks are the latest style?\" Jo blushed. \"Hey, a girl's allowed to window shop. He WAS hot!\" Juni shrugged. \"How did you get out of that sticky situation by the way?\" Dem shot a horrified glance at her best friend and spoke in a weary tone. \"What did you do?\" \"I can't help it. He snuck up on me and saw me shuffling through the papers. Just remember my cover story. My mum works for Lipstick Associates, okay? I told him that I thought it was her briefcase and was looking through papers for a client. He TOTALLY bought it. It helps to play the dumb blond sometimes.\" Jo giggled and tossed her loose white blond hair over her shoulders. \"What are you waiting for, Dem? Antarctica to become a summer resort?\" \"With global warming, it might happen yet.\" \"JUNI!\" Jo and Dem cried in unison, then Dem began typing furiously into the computer. She sent an email right to headquarters. A minute later, Jo's phone rang. \"Hello. Jo speaking.\" \"Original answer, Josephine. It's your personal number.\" \"WhatEVER. Did you just phone to criticize my speech habits or do you have something else to say, Gabriella?\" A trilling laugh sounded from the speaker. \"Good job, Jo, Juni. Especially you though, Jo. You used the lesson of stereotypes well and obtained the proper info on the first day. You realize this doesn't leave you any time to lounge on the beaches, right? Back to work!\" Jo and Juni groaned, both of them in their bathing suits. Dem gave a 'yahoo' before moving to be beside Juni after she shut her computer off. He looked so cute in his red and black flame swim trunks. She kissed him on his chin before listening to the debriefing again. Jo always had her cell on loud volume so we could all hear the conversation. \"Good work, trio. Your next step will be to meet at the lifejacket house beside the beach. It has a blue door. Inside, there's a lever that, above, has a sign with STAFF ONLY on it. Pull the lever. Bye!\" With that, the phone went dead and they picked up their duffel bags before racing for the lifejacket house. When they were all inside, Dem pulled the lever and the floor flew out from under them. They slid through a dark tunnel downwards. Dem screamed. \"I was so NOT ready for this!\" \"Dem, you aren't the one going backwards!\" The voice was Jo's. Then, the blond gave a 'wahoo' before they hit the bottom. It was still dark. Juni and Dem decided to make the best of the time. When Jo flicked on the light, she laughed at the sight of Juni and Demetra frozen in a French kiss. They both had the 'deer-in-headlights' look. Dem pointed downwards for the light to shut off again, but Jo gestured for them to follow and they unlocked their lip lock quickly. The steel room was small. They walked for the door and out into the sunlight. After a second look though, Dem stated that it wasn't. \"That's manufactured light, not sunlight. We're in a building of some sort. This could be dangerous.\" Good? Don't forget to press that little button at the bottom. Review! I need to know what you think of it![Chapter 3] I am SOOOOO sorry for not updating for so long. I'm a bad author, aren't I? I lost interest in this story for a while. Didn't have enough inspiration to finish it, or time to finish it in. Now, I have nothing else to write other than Fanfiction, and this was my most interesting unfinished story. So, I present to you the continuation of this story: Chapter 3! -bows, then curtsies- The three agents looked up with shocked expressions on their faces. Demetra was the first to snap from the trance. \"Look down. I sense cameras!\" She hissed at her partners. They immediately looked down at their shoes and Dem nearly did a facepalm. Suuuurrrrreeee...like it wouldn't be obvious to anyone watching that they had detected the security cameras. Mentally, she cursed Jo and Juni out. How stupid were they? Why couldn't they recall their spy training right now? Dem spoke first. \"Move forward slowly and carefully, you two. Normally though. Who knows what could be out there?\" The words were whispered, but her fellow agents heard them nonetheless and proceeded. Finally, they reached the door at the other end of the room, which appeared to be some sort of greenhouse/biosphere. Dem and Jo breathed a sigh of relief before they heard a crackle and whipped their heads around to see Juni opening a freeze-dried snack-bar. Jo groaned. \"Duuuuuddddeee.\" \"What? You hungry too? I'm hungry. Want a bite? Blueberry, honey and almond.\" Jo just rolled her eyes and snatched the bar from his hand quickly. The movement was so quick that the foil-wrapped snack slipped from her hand and clattered on the floor. Sirens immediately sounded and dirty looks were passed between Juni and Jo. Demetra's eyes widened and she spoke through her teeth. \"You idiots. Let's get out of here quickly and THEN you can fight each other!\" She took off for the door and hid in a well-concealed alcove. After a minute of waiting, she realized that her partners hadn't followed. She heard a hiss, a poof and then two thuds. She thought the worst. It didn't help her optimistic thought processes when the conveyor belt-like floor went past her carrying the bodies of her friends. She bit her lip and tucked a strand of loose brunette hair behind her ear. She'd have to find out their destination and bide her time. ~~~1 hour later~~~ After she hacked into the system and found out room 103 in the west wing was expecting an 'experimental subject' delivery, Demetra had started biding her time. Waiting spy-like for an opportunity to strike became boring after the first fifteen minutes, so she had been mentally singing songs for about forty-five minutes. She was in the middle of a rousing version of 'Camptown Races' when her chance came. An employee was wheeling a cupboard tool cart by her. She threw a penny and it bounced off the wall at the far end of the hallway. The employee looked up and abandoned the cart to look for where the small clank had come from. While he was on the search, Dem opened the tool cart's cupboard door, squeezed herself inside and shut the door. She popped open her utility knife and unscrewed a cupboard doorknob. A minute later, she felt herself being wheeled away. Then she watched her surroundings pass by. A door saying 'Brain Studies' passed by. The room number was 103, and Dem was able to glimpse inside through a slightly open door. Two shining chairs held her friends. She chucked another penny as a distraction and the guy went looking for it. Low-tech, but a penny had 101 uses. First use: A cent in money. Second use: A handy distraction. The employee wasn't too bright, but it made her job all the easier as she slid from the cabinet, fixed the doorknob and crawled into the alcove near the door. The guy wheeled away his cart, leaving her alone on her mission. Time to rescue her friends.[Chapter 4] Dem peeked through the small window on the closed door. There was a man in a lab coat going from a computer to a drawer regularly. Even though Dem loved Juni, she still noticed other guys. Who wouldn't? It was only natural. She had to admit that this scientist wasn't of the pimply nerd variety. He had black, close cropped hair and a rather classy and very neat goatee. She glimpsed the contents of the drawer and was puzzled to see rows and rows of CDs. What were they for? After listening in on his speech (he talked to himself), she found out a few minutes later that he was going to go for a lunch break and Demetra watched him exit the room by a door across the room. She waited a couple of minutes before speeding through the door. Electronics dominated the wall-space and her eyes widened as she spoke in a hushed tone. \"Come on Juni, Jo! I'm here to save you. Don't worry. I'll get you out soon and we can solve this thing together.\" \"Solve what thing? Who are you? Who are Juni and Jo?\" The words were said by Juni, but Jo had the same clueless look as Dem's boyfriend. They didn't know? It threw Dem for a loop. Then she realized with a start. THE DRAWER! The girl rushed over and looked through the disks. The newest two had pictures of Jo and Juni. She brought the CDs to the machines attached to the chairs. There was a bowl-shaped contraption attached to cords. After looking over the machine Dem saw something saying INSTRUCTIONS. Oh brother. Just how clueless WAS this guy? Obviously this guy was an evil not-so-genius. Dem rolled her eyes and followed the instructions. First, she put the bowls on their heads. Then she flicked a lever, inserted the corresponding CDs and pressed a button. The machines began to whir quietly and Dem read about the machine, not quite believing that the guy would leave a manual around. Oh...the manual explained that too. He could just store their whole memories on a disk and alter, or switch memories. It also said that the manual was hard for scientists to understand because of technicalities in the speech used, and it was hard for normal people to understand because of the scientific nature of the project. The machines stopped their various noises and Dem undid the chains quickly, pulling her friends from the chairs to hide away just as the guy came through the door again. Dem jumped out and, with the help of Juni and Jo, overpowered him and strapped him in the chair for questioning. Jo and Juni bounced away to try to shut down the facility, leaving Demetra to interrogate. She shivered slightly with anticipation. She loved this part. \"Who are you?\" \"I am the Memory Master.\" The guy looked Spanish, but appearances could be deceiving, as he had a crisp British accent and Dem scratched her head. \"No. I meant your REAL name.\" \"I can't remember. Just kidding, sweetheart. My name is Kyle Williams.\" Demetra frowned at his calling her sweetheart, but didn't let her feelings towards that invade her professional attitude. \"We have agents who lost their memories, Mr. Williams and came back with different ones. This is no joking matter. Is that your work?\" \"Of course. Their true memories are either in someone else's mind or in my vast collection of memory CDs. Quite an ingenious invention if I do say so myself. You yourself was one of the subjects. I loaded your true memory onto a disk and uploaded a new one into your mind, one that was made according to my client's specifications.\" \"Client? And you wiped MY memory?\" This interrogation was almost too easy. This guy had obviously wanted someone to brag to for a long time. He answered her questions very willingly. \"Yes. You were one of my proudest moments. You were the first to receive a manufactured memory. Clients, or customers, pay me to give certain memories to people who meet their specifications in looks and abilities. Then they tell me what they want these people to...remember. I make those memories and upload them via a special computer program I developed. The customer receives an obedient employee or servant. If the customers likes some of the original memories, I merge the two memories and the subject of the experiment has both. So far, I haven't had cause to use that technology though. I've created a manual for it though.\" He was so proud of his achievements that this interrogation was too easy. \"Why make the manual so easy to follow?\" \"Just because it was easy for you to follow doesn't mean it's that way for everyone. I implanted an understanding in your memory so you could work it. I do it with all my subjects, but usually they don't find their way back to the lab.\" \"Where's my old memory, dude?\" \"Row 31, disk 500.\" Suddenly, the lights flickered and Dem heard a message over the speakers. Juni's voice. \"Over-ride complete. The OSS will be arriving shortly, Demetra.\" Dem chuckled. Juni worked the computers and nothing was exploding? Miracles of miracles. She spoke into her KOSS headset. \"Tell the OSS to keep the disks and the machine. They're vital to recovering the identities of thousands of people, including myself. Also, keep this guy around, and his manuals. We can restore the memories of those victims.\" Kyle Williams spoke up. \"I have a warning for you Demetra. You may not like who you were before. Are you sure you don't want to remain clueless? Ignorance is bliss after all.\" \"You have the right to remain silent. Interrogation is over. You are now under the custody of the OSS, and was arrested by KOSS agents. Anything you say from this point on can and will be used against you.\"[Chapter 5] Row 31, CD 500. Demetra wondered what awaited her there. The teen was at OSS headquarters, in the branch that held her new KOSS office. It occurred to her that Kyle Williams released the information too easily and that maybe it was a trap. Then again, he didn't really have a villainous name. Wasn't that supposed to be one of the main tell-tale signs of a bad guy? At the same time, his warning that she might not like what she found troubled and, oddly enough, reassured her too. He didn't seem like the hating type. It was an hour after coming back from the mission to capture the Memory Master and Dem still wondered about it. Puzzled, she stood from her spinning leather desk-chair and made her way down the hallway to the office of her tech-savvy partner, Jo. She knocked before opening the door, and was surprised to discover her boyfriend, Juni, inside with no sign of their other partner. To confuse Dem further, Juni was sobbing. Cautiously, Demetra approached and put a hand on her guy's shoulder. \"Juni? What's wrong? And why are you in Jo's office?\" Juni just cried harder. Finally, he calmed down enough to answer. \"I'm not Juni. I'm Jo. I don't know what happened. I was extra clumsy, and then I came back to my office, look in my mirror and I was like...THIS! Dem!\" The Memory Master's machines! Dem knew it must have switched their memories. Somewhere, Juni was stuck in Jo's body. That was beyond weird for Dem. Her boyfriend...she simply shuddered thinking of it. So much for a semi-normal relationship. Dem patted Jo on the back gently. She'd really have to get used to this. Then Jo sniffed and recovered, wiping the tears from her eyes. Then Jo spoke. \"So, what did you come to talk to me about, Dem?\" \"Kyle Williams mentioned that I had a previous set of memories. Now that you've been used by his machines, unfortunate circumstance though it is. You'll be able to make sense of the manual. I want to try to merge my memories.\" \"I can try, but wouldn't that be dangerous Dem?\" \"Oh probably. Listen Jo, I go on special agent missions every week. I came from a world where I battled pixelated monsters. I crossed dimensions. I was ready...well...you know how I felt when I came here to find Juni. I've told you.\" A dark look passed over Jo's face. Or rather, Juni's. This was confusing. \"Anyways, I don't know why you're worried about the merging of memories when the process's creator wrote an instructions manual. Besides, I want to know who I was before.\" \"I understand.\" \"No, you don't Jo! You know who you are and you have your whole life! I just found out I wasn't programmed and actually have a family! The only way you'd understand is if you suddenly found out you were adopted. Have you? No? Then don't pretend you understand. I appreciate the gesture Jo, but it's kind of false for me.\" \"I'm sorry, but if anything happens to you in those situations, it wouldn't be my fault. I couldn't live with myself if I messed...if I messed up...my best friend's brain. To take a risk like that...it isn't to be taken lightly.\" Dem sighed. She did know where Jo was coming from on that account. \"Jo, if something happens it won't be your fault. You're a genius, and I trust you.\" \"That just makes it worse! I don't want to betray your trust. I don't want to be a failure to you, Demetra.\" \"I promise you that as long as you do your best and you're still my friend, I won't think of you as a failure. Besides, I put you in my boyfriend's body. You mess up and we'd kind of be even, don't you think?\" Dem chuckled, illiciting a small smile from her friend. \"It is kind of a biggie. For you, Dem, this kind of big mistake doesn't generally happen.\" Dem laughed. \"The machines are in OSS Tech Lab #004. While we're there, I want to look and see if there's any information on how to change you back into the Jo I know and love.\" With that, they exited the office and walked to the lab. There was...uh...Juni looking through the books, mumbling. \"There has to be...has to be...this is a bloody nightmare.\" \"I'll say.\" The answer was Jo's, but the voice was Juni's. Dem chuckled. Her two friends turned and glared at her and she simply shrugged. Jo turned to Juni. \"This is sooooo weird. It's like looking in a mirror. Did you find anything? Think of anything?\" \"Other than the semi-amusing fact that our friend Chuckles over here has her boyfriend trapped in a girl's body so she'd technically be seen as a lesbian? Yeah, I got nothin'.\" Jo and Juni laughed and it was Demetra's turn to glare. \"Yeah, yeah. Laugh it up. Not so funny when you realize you need someone who knows how these things work to operate the machines to turn you back and I'm the only agent in KOSS and OSS who is available to do it.\" They both frowned and Dem grinned. \"I want my other memory back first though, so look around for a manual on merging memories.\" They scurried around, overturning books and CDs looking for it. Finally, Juni gave a triumphant shout. Or rather, Jo's voice. Demetra rushed over. \"What? You found it?\" \"No, I found the latest issue of Sports Illustrated. Well, duh Einstein. Would I have said a loud 'aha' if I had to keep looking? I mean, honestly. For someone in the running for KOSS agent of the month, you're not exactly used to using the old noggin, are you Dem?\" \"Aw shuddup.\" Then she thumbed through the manual, settling on the page with the information and instructions. She walked over to the set of drawers to retrieve the memory disk, setting it on a side-table with the manual. Then she sat on the chair. \"Don't let Juni touch it, Jo. I don't want my brains scrambled. I love him, but he's clueless with this stuff. You're way better at doing things right.\" Juni made a huffing noise. \"That's not what you said on our last date, Demetra.\" Jo made a face, waving her hands in front of her face in a fashion that clearly said 'hell no'. \"Ew. TMI, TMI, TMI.\" Dem and Juni laughed. \"He's joking with you Jo. With work and all, we've barely had time to grab take-out.\" Demetra put the machine's silver bowl on her head and gave her best friend a simple thumbs up. Jo threw a switch and a gentle whirring filled the room before she inserted the disc into its slot. A minute later, the machine spun to a stop and Dem sighed. Jo and Juni looked at her apprehensively. \"Did it work? What do you remember?\" \"I'm a bloody princess.\" I am so so sorry for not updating sooner, but I finally got the inspiration to try and finish this. In fact, it was written ages ago and I apologize for not posting it sooner. It's shameful. It really is. I am so sorry. Will cookies make up for it? COOKIES FOR EVERYONE! There's still plenty more to come. Juni: how dare you put me in Jo's body? Josephine: how dare YOU complain? I'm stuck in a guy's body and she's calling me Josephine in the extras! Juni: you're right. I do have it better than you. Josephine: Finally you agree wi-oh crap. That means I'm worse off than you. -hits author over head- Me: HEY HEY HEY YOU HURT ME AND YOU DON'T GET YOUR OWN BODIES BACK! -Josephine immediately halts pursuit- FINALLY.[Chapter 6] Jo's eyes widened (or would they technically be Juni's?). \"W-what?\" \"You heard me. I know you haven't gone deaf. I'm a stinkin' princess and I didn't know it because...\" Her sentence drifted off. How had she been separated from her parents? Then a barrage of memories rushed in to show her and she whimpered in the chair. Tears began streaming down her face. Juni and Jo were in shock, who had their jaws dropped only a moment before they rushed to Dem's side to comfort her. Demetra closed her eyes and rocked back and forth as her boyfriend, Juni, held her. Only he was in Jo's body. Comforting, but not nearly as comfortable as it would have normally been. \"Shh...Dem, it's okay...you're okay. You're still who you were before. You don't have to worry. You're safe...shh...you're safe.\" Demetra looked up at her friends, her eyes filled with sadness. \"I'm not the girl I was before. The only thing we share is our name and some recent memories.\" \"You have us.\" It was Jo. She winked and Dem smiled slightly. Weird to see when Jo was still in Juni's body...but she felt better and wiped away her tears as she stood up. \"Thanks.\" \"That's what friends are for.\" After a quick group hug, they all felt pretty cheesy. Demetra was the first to speak. \"We really need to put you guys in your own bodies now.\" They both nodded emphatically, and she skimmed the manual while they climbed into the chairs. It only took a few minutes, and they were in their own bodies again. \"Alright. Now as to what I've learned from my memories. I'm a princess from another dimension.\" \"YOU'RE A WHAT FROM A WHAT?\" Jo's voice rang out and Dem shot her a lopsided smile. Juni sputtered. \"Another DIMENSION? Well this sounds a bit familiar.\" \"Yeah, yeah Juni. Anyways, I have to talk to your dad. He's head of the OSS again.\" They all started making their way to the main office. \"Juni? Demetra? What can I do for you? By the way, congratulations on the KOSS spy of the month nomination, Demetra.\" \"Thanks Mr Cortez. We were wondering if we could have clearance for some spy mission gear.\" \"HELLO? HAS ANYONE SEEN ME HERE?\" Dem turned to glare at Jo. \"Yes, we're aware you're here. We just wish you wouldn't speak so loud. We were appreciating your quiet, so weren't about to say anything to change that.\" Jo put on a pouty face, crossing her arms. \"We have a bit of a mission, Mr. Cortez.\" \"Mind telling me what it's about?\" Dem heard Mr Cortez's question and answered before Jo could get a word in. \"I was one of the Memory Master's projects. I...snuck into one of the OSS labs to merge my new memories with the old. I want to investigate my roots, Mr Cortez.\" \"Well, I don't approve of you sneaking into the labs, and this mission wouldn't be official business. However, I know it will bother you and take your mind off the missions, putting other agents in danger. So you should probably do this. Just don't expect a pay raise coming if you win KOSS agent of the month. This will replace that. However, I can't just ignore the fact that you deliberately ignored OSS protocol to use the machines of a deranged maniac. No TV for a month in your office.\" Dem groaned lightly before sighing and nodding. Then Mr Cortez spoke again as they were leaving. \"Juni? Remember to clean your pod of the sub this time if you use that. Your mum was on the clean-up crew for the last one and nearly had a heart attack.\" Juni groaned and Gregorio chuckled before waving them off. They exited the head office, hopping across the floating letters carefully. When they were in the hallway, Demetra's dramatic side came out. \"Peoples! To the Interspace Interdimensional Transportation Mission Device!\" \"We really should come up with a shorter name for that thing. Yelling that long one out makes the whole battle cry thing lose some of its oomph.\" Jo mused. Then Dem spoke, cocking her head to the side slightly. \"It is kind of awkward isn't it. Kind of hard to put a dramatic flair on it. Did I manage?\" \"Not really. You just sort of looked like an idiot.\" Dem punched Jo lightly in the shoulder, glaring all the while before breaking down in laughter suddenly. Juni jumped. He had wandered into a different room to look at something, and when he came back Demetra and Jo were both laughing like crazy. \"Are you okay? You scared me. For all I know, you could be dying.\" \"Yeah sure. Laughter doesn't generally do that, Juni. It doesn't do that.\" \"Too bad. I don't have much luck, do I?\" \"Oh haha Juni. You're laughing now, but you aren't going to be laughing so hard the next time your dad offers you one of the boyfriend/girlfriend cover missions.\" I AM SO SORRY! I HAD A CHAPTER WRITTEN UP AND I COMPLETELY FORGOT TO POST IT! ZOMGosh I am so so sorry I left you and this story. I don't even have an excuse. I don't have muse now, but that can't be an excuse for this chapter. -hangs head- Demetra: are you freakin' kidding me? Jo: HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO US? Me: I know I know. You can only continue your lives if I write it, and I've been failing you miserably. Juni: Damn right. Me: -glares- ","Summary":" Welcome to the new story, Pixelated Princess. If you haven't already read it, I suggest you read th"},{"Movie":"Spy Kids","Title":"Game Of Reality","Author":"WhiteAsukalover","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10026290","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: Hey guys, White here with another story, my 4th story in as many days. This one is a major AU based off of Spy Kids 3-D Game Over. How you ask? Read and see! It had been 3 long years since Juni and his friends left the torture that was the game world behind them, but to Demetra, it felt like forever. She was programmed to be indestructible, but it drove her crazy. She just wanted to die. Angrily clawing at the wall she stood in front of, a few pieces of it, broke loose, electricity pulsing behind it... Piece after piece of the wall broke free until a wall of white binary code numbers appeared at what used to be a wall for the once infamous Level 5 of the Toymaker's game. \"No way...can it be? An exit out of this crazy nightmare?!\" Demetra squealed excitedly. The white wall of zeroes and ones wasn't the most formal exit in the world but after spending years of her life looking for a way out or hoping that Juni and his friends would come back she was desperate for anything. All Demetra had to do was reach out and touch it. \"Finally...I'll be able to live a real life!\" Demetra smiled brightly as she reached out and touched it. Demetra part of the game until now, just a special code of data and a role of a non-playable character who's job was to deceive the hero and be the main reason why Level 5 was ultimately unwinnable but with her proud creator the Toymaker long gone and the game being shut down she was bored and had no purpose A fatal strike to her heart would kill her but that was something that Demetra was too strong to try but her hope had worn thin but now she was free. She was sucked through the binary code wall and out of the game and was on her way to the ultimate level for her, the human world. Demetra found herself in a city...a human city. The sun was bright and shining and there were people, cars, and other things that Demetra had never seen before. There were no robots, no monsters, everything looked normal, natural, perhaps even...real. After taking in the city she was in and all it's various sights and sounds Demetra noticed that people were going her curious stares of just why she was dressed like she was. It wasn't until she saw her body in the reflection of a restaurant glass window that she noticed some things. The first one being that she grew up about three years to make her look like a teenager, and that she was still in her \"Game Over\" fighting attire. After taking some time to look at her teenage frame, as well as pinching herself to see if she was a human as well, she went looking for some new clothes. It took a bit of walking but she made it to a nice, urban, clothing store. However once she got her foot in the door she wondered one thing, how was she going to pay for this? It wasn't like in Game Over where power-ups and other gifts popped out of nowhere and she wasn't going to risk being a thief in her first day as a human girl. Until that's when she felt something appear in her right hand, it was a purple leather wallet and full of American money! Demetra had to smile. She wasn't sure how that happened, but she damn sure wasn't complaining. Then the former deciever decided to do a bit of shopping. She had a fondness for darker colors and it showed as she picked a purple short-sleeved shirt, skinny dark blue jeans and some black girls sports shoes. She put them all in the bag and went to the cashier to pay for them. The cashier smiled, ringing them up for her. Demetra paid in cash and the transaction was a success. She had officially bought her first outfit and she was on her way out the store. Once Demetra went itno the changing room to put on her new clothing she realized just how light and flashy human attire could be, at least compared to the suits of battle she wore in the video game. After putting on her new outfit she saw a brunette checking clothes out in one of the nearby racks who looked awfully familiar to her. Demetra cautiously approached her. She could swear she'd seen this girl before.. The brunette was roaming though the hat section of the store, not knowing that Demetra was walking towards her as he eyes were focused on the hat shelves. Demetra jogged over, interest in her dark blue eyes. The brunette looked at Demetra for a second. Either she was really interested in buying a hat or she wanted to talk to her. \"C...Carmen is...that you?\" Demetra asked softly. Carmen then turned to the stranger with a curious look on her face, \"Um...yes but who are you and how did you know my name?\" \"Don't you recognize me?\" Demetra asked softly. Carmen took a good look at the girl. She looked vaguely familiar, \"I don't think so. What's your name?\" She asked. \"Demetra.\" She replied calmly. \"Demetra...\" Carmen said the name to herself, trying to remember it and once she did her mouth was agape in shock, \"Demetra?! You're here? Out of the Toymaker's game?!\" \"Yeah...after 3 long years, I'm finally free..\" Demetra answered. To be continued...[Chapter 2] Last Time \"C...Carmen is...that you?\" Demetra asked softly.

You're here? Out of the Toymaker's game?!\" \"Yeah...after 3 long years, I'm finally free..\" Demetra answered. End Flashback Carmen didn't know what to say, she was so shocked that Demetra was here in the human world, the real world, \"We have to talk about some things, not here though. I know a cafe near here.\" The elder Cortez sibling replied. She'd been through so much in her life but never in her wildest dreams did she ever expect to see Demetra alive and well again especially as a part of the human world. \"Sure thing.\" Demetra replied happily, her dark blue eyes twinkling in joy. She was so happy to have bumped into an old friend so soon especially Carmen. She was after all the sister of the boy the former Deciever pined for so desperately. Carmen soon forgot all about what hat she was going to buy. She left the store with Demetra right behind her, she had so many questions to ask her and so many things to tell her. What a way for Carmen to be surprised on a summer day, being reunited with a girl she last saw 3 years ago in an abandoned video game who she presumed was probably finished when the game itself went down. It took a bit of walking but Carmen and Demetra made it to a quaint cafe where they talked over herbal tea. \"So.. what did you wanna talk about?\" Demetra asked smiling innocently, her eyes darting around in every direction with the innate curiousity of a child despite the fact that she had been originally designed as an 11-year-old girl by The Toymaker. \"Well like how did you out of the game? When did you get out of the game?\" Carmen asked the former Deciever. \"Today actually. I was clawing at the walls and broke some of them apart, and a way out appeared.\" Demetra explained, smiling happily. \"Am I the first person you've actually talked to since Game Over?'\" Carmen asked. She was curious to know what or who Demetra had encountered since her grand reappearance into the human world. \"Yep.\" Demetra replied sweetly. She was forever thankful that she had encountered Carmen today. She had always thought of the brown-eyed brunette as someone who was very wise and reassuring. \"You have any questions for me?\" Carmen queried, though there was a bit of mischief glinting in her eyes as though she knew exactly what was on Demetra's mind now. \"Well...about Juni...\" She blushed. She couldn't hide her feelings for the younger Cortez sibling any longer. Juni might have been a little nerdy but Demetra couldn't help but fall for him. \"I knew you two had a thing for each other.\" Carmen said with a little smile, remembering just how Demetra and Juni acted three years ago, \"what about him?\" She asked sweetly. \"Well...I escaped mainly because...I'm in love with him Carmen.\" Demetra explained, a little color coming to her face as she blushed. \"I could tell you loved him, even after all these years Demetra.\" Carmen answered with a smile. \"I've always loved him. I never wanted to decieve him Carmen.\" The former Deciever replied softly. \"I understand. But I think you should be telling Juni something like that, not me.\" Carmen replied, keeping her voice gentle for her young friend. \"How is he? Is he...seeing anyone?\" Demetra asked, feeling a bit nervous at the prospect of her only love being taken by some other girl. \"Well Juni has grown up a bit. He's 14 now, in high school and I just started college this year. He's doing occasional OSS work while doing his own cases.\" Carmen said, letting Demetra know what he's been up to first. \"Yes..and?\" Demetra prodded nervously. \"He's...dating someone.\" Carmen answered softly, knowing this would hurt her friend. Demetra's heart figuratively sank. \"No...\" She whispered in anguish. It seemed she'd made her comeback too late...

Demetra's heart figuratively sank. \"No...\" She whispered in anguish. It seemed she'd made her comeback too late... End Flashback \"Demetra...I'm so sorry. Juni tried whatever he could to get you out at the time, he waited months for you.\" Carmen said softly, trying to relax Demetra in her heartbroken state. \"Is he...around?\" Demetra asked softly. She had to see Juni again. \"He's a few blocks away, in the city park.\" Carmen answered softly. \"Can we..go see him?\" Demetra asked innocently. \"Um...sure, he's probably still there.\" Carmen answered innocently, smiling. \"Great, let's go!\" Demetra exclaimed. Carmen got up, drank her tea, and left the cafe. Demetra eagerly followed. Carmen and Demetra walked to the city park, looking for Juni...and his girlfriend. \"Do ya see him?\" Demetra asked excitedly. \"Not yet, keep an eye out for guys with curly hair.\" Carmen said, letting Demetra know that Juni has grown up in his appearance over the years. \"Right.\" Demetra nodded, looking carefully. \"Wait, I think I see him at the benches.\" Carmen pointed out after a couple minutes of searching \"Great.\" She smiled. \"Let's go.\" Carmen said with a little smile. Demetra nodded, rushing ahead. At this time Juni was sitting on a bench with a blonde girl clinging to his arm, not even noticing that his sister and Demetra were coming his way. Demetra's heart began to race as she approached him. \"Carmen...I...I don't know if I can handle this, my hearts beating like crazy.\" She whispered. \"Don't worry I'll be right beside you,\" Carmen was willing to show her support for Demetra. \"Thanks.\" Demetra answered as they arrived before Juni. Juni smiled as the blonde girl kissed his cheek while Carmen and Demetra walked closer to him. \"Juni..\" Demetra murmured softly. \"Hm?\" Juni asked, turning to look in Demetra's direction. Demetra blushed, smiling shyly. Wanting to break the ice Carmen spoke, \"Remember her Juni?\" she said with a little smile, \"that's Demetra,\" Carmen introduced while the blonde girl watched with curiosity. \"Yeah, its me Juni. From the game? I finally escaped.\" Demetra beamed happily. \"Demetra...\" Juni said, trying to remember the name...but he was drawing a blank, \"I'm sorry but I've never seen you before.\" Demetra smiled sadly. She was afraid this would happen. Carmen knew that Demetra had a forced smile through her sadness so she decided to try to jog her brother's memory, \"You know who she is Juni. Remember Game Over, the Toymaker? she's the Deciever.\" \"Well...I used to be.\" Demetra innocently corrected. Carmen mentioned all of these past names and aliases, surely Juni would remember Demetra now! I mean it's been only three years since their epic journey in Game Over and their fight against the Toymaker and Carmen remember with little difficulty when Demetra told her who she was. But alas Juni had a confused look on his face, letting them know that Demetra was at least vaguely familiar to him, \"I'm sorry sis, I really don't know who she is.\" Demetra smiled sadly. She figured Juni wouldn't remember. It was painfully clear he'd moved on and forgotten her. To be continued...[Chapter 4] Last Time \"Demetra...\" Juni said, trying to remember the name...but he was drawing a blank, \"I'm sorry but I've never seen you before.\" Demetra smiled sadly.

She figured Juni wouldn't remember. It was painfully clear he'd moved on and forgotten her. End Flashback Carmen could feel just how bad Demetra was feeling, how she had to force that sad smile. She then decided to speak once again. \"So um...I'm going to show Demetra around, she's new here.\" Demetra nodded softly, fighting back tears. Carmen led Demetra away from Juni and the blonde girl. Meanwhile the younger Cortez wondered just who this other girl was. \"No...it couldn't be...\" He thought. Was that the same Demetra he knew three years ago? Demetra was doing her best not to break down in front of Carmen and look weak, supressing her sadness with the occasional pained whimper, but it was obvious she was hurting very much. \"Demetra...I'm so sorry.\" Carmen said as she wrapped her arms around her in a friendly hug to try and console her new friend. Demetra whimpered, clearly needing to let out her tears. \"Let your tears out Demi...I didn't know that was going to happen.\" Carmen said softly. Demetra did just that, crying into Carmen's shoulder. Carmen patted Demetra's back. She still couldn't believe that Juni didn't know who Demetra was. \"It's...not fair..\" Demetra sobbed. \"Maybe...maybe he just needs time to remember. I mean he never thought you'd be here, outside of that abandoned video game.\" Carmen said, trying to calm Demetra down. \"You remembered me right away though.\" She protested. \"I know...just give him some time...he'll remember.\" Carmen said, trying to relax Demitra. \"I hope so...I love him Carmen..\" Demetra murmured softly. Carmen looked into Demetras dark blue eyes, she didn't know Demetra felt so deeply about Juni. \"You're serious about this, Demi.\" She murmured in realization. \"Very serious. I've been in love with him ever since we met in Game Over.\" Demetra answered. \"Wow...I...I don't know what to say. Especially after you held that same love for about three years.\" Carmen answered, a little astonished at just how strongly Demetra felt for her baby brother. \"Yeah...he's stolen my heart Carm.\" Demetra giggled, blushing. \"Awww.\" Carmen cooed with a little smile, understanding the love that Demetra had for him. \"Don't worry, I know my brother. He's probably trying to remember just who you are.\" She sweetly reassured. \"Yeah right, he's completely forgotten me!\" Demetra whimpered. \"Don't say that Demi, I'm sure he has you on his mind right now.\" Carmen said, trying to cheer Demetra up by making her feel that Juni was at least thinking about Demetra right now. \"How can you be so sure? He's already got a girlfriend..\" Demetra countered softly. \"That doesn't mean he won't remember you.\" Carmen said. \"And besides, once he remembers the adventures we had three years ago he might just break up with his girlfriend.\" She added, smiling. \"True but still..\" Demetra murmured softly. \"Listen, everything will be okay.\" Carmen said softly. Meanwhile Juni had left the blonde girl and walked through the park, looking for his sister and Demetra. \"I hope so.\" Demetra sighed. Juni walked through the park, looking for the two girls with thoughts of Demetra running through his mind. \"There's no way...no way that's the same Demetra.\" He murmured to himself. \"So..what about you? You seeing anyone Carm?\" Demetra asked, after a few moment's silence. \"Well yes, I'm seeing someone. He's a former Spy Kid like me.\" Carmen answered. \"Who?\" The purple-clad brunette asked. \"Gary Giggles.\" Carmen answered. \"Never heard of him.\" Demetra answered. \"Yeah he wasn't in Game Over with us.\" Carmen said. \"His parents did help design the game though.\" She added with a giggle. \"Hey Carm?\" Demetra asked. \"Yes Demi?\" Carmen asked in reply. \"When the Toymaker captured you..what did he do or say to you?\" Demetra asked in a soft innocent voice. Carmen reallly didn't want to remember that. \"Are you sure you want to know?\" She replied in a gentle tone. \"I need to know. Your my closest..girlfriend I've got.\" Demetra giggled sheepishly. \"Well. For starters he captured me and held me in these electrified shackles. All one of his guards needed to do was press a red button and I'd get zapped.\" Carmen explained, glaring at the memory. \"Oh my God..\" Demetra gasped, horrified. \"Yeah I had to just sit there and be a good little captive or else I would get shocked worse and worse every time. It wasn't until I knocked out the guard that had the key and I usd it to free myself.\" Carmen answered acidly. \"Did he try to brainwash you?\" Demetra asked softly. \"Yeah he tried. He had a mind control gun that he was going to use on me on my third day of capture, that was when he knew that Juni was in the game.\" Carmen said. \"His plan was to have me fight Juni.\" She added. \"What a creep..\" Demetra growled. \"I know, I only regret letting myself get captured by that lunatic and not being able to help my brother sooner.\" Carmen said icily. Meanwhile Juni was getting closer to the girls, right across from the tree square of the park. \"How'd it happen Carm?\" Demetra asked, referring to Carmen's capture. \"Well I had to find him. I wanted him to come into the game with me but my brother was a private eye detective at the time and I couldn't contact him so it took me even longer to find him because I didn't know where he was.\" Carmen explained to her friend. Demetra hugged her close. \"I love you Carm...your like the sister I've never had but always wanted..\" She said, giving a teary-eyed smile. \"I love you too, Demi.\" Carmen smiled back as she returned the hug. Meanwhile the sound of Juni's voice came closer to the two girls. \"Carmen!\" He called out. Demetra looked up, puzzled. \"Carmen...Demetra, I have to talk to you.\" Juni said once he walked up to them. \"You...you remember me?\" Demetra asked happily. \"Well yes...I mean, I have a feeling that I should but...you can't be the same Demetra from the game.\" Juni answered, smiling sheepishly. \"I am Juni.\" Demetra answered innocently. Juni then had more questions to ask. \"But how? You're fourteen years old just like me and your human...like a real human!\" He exclaimed. \"I escaped.\" She replied simply. \"But how did you escape? When did you escape?\" Juni said, still having trouble believing that this was the same exact Demetra from the video game. Demetra sighed loudly, partly out of exasperation. She may have loved Juni, but he had a real habit for missing the obvious. Carmen decided to help Demetra out as she smiled. \"She broke out of the game by going through a binary wall and this is her first time in our world Juni.\" She explained. Demetra gave her companion a look that clearly conveyed her thanks. Juni nodded. \"Alright I get it but you're older, shouldn't you be the same age you were when you were in the game?\" he asked Demetra. He wondered just why did Demetra look like she was his age. Demetra sighed, deciding to answer this herself. \"I may have been data in the game but that didn't mean that I couldn't age, Juni.\" Demetra answered.\"The Toymaker made it so I'd age as the game did and as long as Game Over's data existed I would age like a normal girl.\" The purple-clad former Deciever answered. Carmen nodded to confirm this. \"Wow...so that's why.\" Juni said. He was usually a good speaker but this was one of the few times he had trouble getting words out. \"Surprised?\" Demetra drawled. \"Um...yes!\" Juni said, honestly surprised that Demetra would age. \"But still I can't believe that you're here in the human world!\" Juni exclaimed. \"Well I am, Juni. I..came back for a reason.\" Demetra admitted, blushing. \"And that reason is...me...right?\" Juni asked shyly. \"Yes Juni...I'm in love with you.\" Demetra answered blushing. \"I...but I'm with someone though.\" Juni said shyly. Even though he acknowledged Demetra's existence he still had a girlfriend. Demetra sighed sadly. \"I know.\" \"But I still want us to be friends though.\" Juni answered sweetly. Demetra bit her lip. Juni smiled, hugging Demetra in a friendly embrace, showing his frienship. Demetra returned it with a smile. Juni's blonde girlfriend saw Demetra and Juni hug and her eyes twinkled with confusion...and then growing anger. The blonde was none-other than former spy Gerti Giggles and she did not look pleased. To be continued...[Chapter 5] Last Time \"But still I can't believe that you're here in the human world!\" Juni exclaimed. \"Well I am, Juni. I..came back for a reason.\" Demetra admitted, blushing. \"And that reason is...me...right?\" Juni asked shyly. \"Yes Juni...I'm in love with you.\" Demetra answered blushing. \"I...but I'm with someone though.\" Juni said shyly. Even though he acknowledged Demetra's existence he still had a girlfriend. Demetra sighed sadly. \"I know.\" \"But I still want us to be friends though.\" Juni answered sweetly. Demetra bit her lip. Juni smiled, hugging Demetra in a friendly embrace, showing his frienship. Demetra returned it with a smile. Juni's blonde girlfriend saw Demetra and Juni hug and her eyes twinkled with confusion...and then growing anger. The blonde was none-other than former spy Gerti Giggles and she did not look pleased. End Flashback Carmen faked a cough, just to get Juni's attention and it worked as Juni let go of Demetra only because he didn't want the hug to be more than friendly. Demetra looked at Juni, a little confused. \"Juni? What's wrong?\" \"Gerti.\" Juni mouthed, turning to his current girlfriend who was looking nothing short of unhappy. \"Oh shit..\" Demetra groaned softly. Juni immediately walked over to Gerti, ready to explain things to her while Carmen sighed sadly. She knew things weren't going to go well. Demetra bit her lip, turning to Carmen. \"I'm sorry..\" She whimpered. \"It's okay, Demi.\" Carmen smiled softly at her. \"Your intentions were good.\" She reassured. Meanwhile as Carmen tried to talk to Demetra, Juni was trying and apparently failing to calm down Gerti. \"Baby how many times do I have tell you that she's just an old friend.\" Juni pleaded but Gerti just glared at him. \"Could've fooled me with how you were hugging her, there's no way you two were just friends.\" She growled which made Juni's eyes widen in disbelief. \"She's Demetra from Game Over. I haven't seen her in three years baby.\" Juni pleaded but Gerti rolled her eyes at him and that comment. \"Should I say something?\" Demetra whispered to Carmen. \"Not yet.\" Carmen whispered back as Juni was trying to plead his case. \"You really think I'm going to believe that a computer program from game that had been shut down three years ago is not just out of the game but in our world?\" Gerti asked with her hands on her hips. \"I'm not lying to you baby that's really Demetra, the deciever from the game,\" Juni insisted, trying to calmly and cooly explain to Gertie what was going on but the blonde girl just shook her head in disbelief. \"Gertie, what he's saying is true.\" Demetra spoke up in defense of her friend and crush. \"What?\" Gertie asked Demetra in disbelief. Juni nodded in agreement. \"She's right baby, she's just older now.\" He agreed. \"I was programmed to age like a real girl as long as Game Over existed.\" Demetra answered. \"Yeah the game may have been shut down but it was never deleted. The data still existed including Demetra.\" Juni explained but Gerti blinked. \"But like you said she's data...a computer program. How did she leave Game Over?\" Gerti asked. \"I can still function like a human. I broke through the walls and that helped me escape.\" Demetra answered coolly. \"But you should be younger.\" Gerti pointed out but Juni smiled softly. \"C'mon baby. If the Toymaker can make a character in his game be able to think, speak, and behave like a normal girl of course he can make her age,\" Juni chuckled. \"Exactly.\" Demetra answered, starting to get annoyed. Gerti didn't know what to say. She was looking at a computer program come to life that hugged her boyfriend, she didn't know what to say at a time like this, \"I...I can hardly believe this.\" Demetra let out an irritated huff as she turned around, her back to Gertie. \"So I see a computer program comes to life and tries to take my boyfriend.\" Gerti said, glaring at Demetra while doing so. \"Excuse me? I was in love with him first you little priss!\" Demetra snapped, her blue eyes flashing. \"Listen deciever. Juni is older now and things changed, he's changed, and he needs a real girlfriend and not a video game character,\" Gerti sneered in defense. Carmen stepped in between the girls, not wanting things to become violent in public after all, \"Girls, lets calm down and talk about this okay. Both of you girls know Juni very well but fighting over him isn't the right thing to do unless you want to experience a real world jail,\" she said in warning to her two friends. Demetra rolled her eyes. \"Yeah yeah...stupid little bitch..\" She muttered under her breath. Gerti glared daggers at Demetra. \" The OSS just had to keep the game's data active ,\" she thought, angry over Demetra's overall existence. \"Now calm down and lets ask Juni what he thinks.\" Carmen said calmly looking at her younger brother who's eyes widened with a raised eyebrow, \"Excuse me sis?\" Demetra smiled sweetly at Juni, winking at him. Gerti flipped her hair, smiling sweetly back at him while Juni ran his fingers in his curly brown hair with his eyes moving back and forth between the two girls. \"I...I don't know okay.\" \"Come on Juni, don't you remember the adventure we had?\" Demetra purred innocently. \"Before or after she decieved you?\" Gerti sneered with a smirk. \"We're in love Juni and I'll never hurt you.\" Juni sighed, trying to figure which girl was better for him but he couldn't decide especially wthout breaking the other girl's heart and Carmen was honestly enjoying the look of frustration on her normally calm and mild-mannered brother's face in this dilemma. \"Juni you know I had no choice. It was in my programming.\" Demetra pleaded. \"We've been dating for three years, Juni and we've known each other for even longer than that,\" Gerti explained, stating just how long she's known Juni. \"I don't know!\" Juni said through a frustrated sigh, \"I mean. I love you both and we both had fun together but...I can't decide, give me some time to think.\" The former spy insisted that he couldn't chose which girl would he rather be with right now thanks to his dear sister putting him on the spot like this. Demetra pouted cutely, batting her eyelashes. \"What's to think about?\" Gerti asked sweetly. \"I'm a real girl, not a video game character.\" She smiled at Juni but he just sighed and said, \"I said I don't know. I need some to think about this, okay?\" \"Juni, I risked my life for you, she never has.\" Demetra cooed. \"Island of lost dreams, Juni. We fought our way off of that island together, I know you remember that.\" Gerti said with a warm and friendly tone. Meanwhile Carmen finally decided to step in and give her brother some mercy, \"Girls give my brother time to think for a bit.\" Demetra tilted her head in innocent confusion at Gerti's statement. \"Oh that's right.\" Gerti smirked. \"While you were still a thought in the Toymaker's head Juni and I were working together as spies, right Juni?\" she asked to which Carmen replied,\"Not now Gerti,\" She said as she walked closer to her flustered brother. Demetra growled softly, discreetly flipping her off. \"Listen sis, give me some time to think okay? I love Demetra and Gerti and I don't want to break either of their hearts,\" Juni insisted to which Carmen nodded in understanding, \"Okay, I'll tell them.\" Gerti took this time to discreetly mouth, \"Fuck you, deciever\" to Demetra as Carmen and Juni talked. \"Right back at ya bitch!\" Demetra sneered back. Juni turned back around slowly, ready to speak, \"Listen, give me to tormorrow girls and I promise that one of you will be with me because honestly...I don't want to break either one of your hearts.\" he said innocently but with honesty in his words. \"Sure Juni.\" Demetra smiled sweetly, winking and blowing him a kiss. Gerti sneered at Demetra and her sweet ways, \" She's lucky Carmen is here or else I'd be slapping her right now, \" she thought, \"We'll meet up here tomorrow, Gerti knows my number but I'll give it to you Demi. That way I can get us all to meet up here tomorrow,\" Carmen said, ready to coordinate this little meeting. \"Alright Carm.\" Demetra smiled. After keying her number into Demetra's phone she spoke again, \"Now leave Juni alone until tomorrow because he's a good kid who cares about both of you girls and he really needs to think about this,\" Carmen said, insisting that the girls just leave her brother alone for the time being. \"Is that what you want Juni?\" Gerti asked innocently to which Juni nodded, showing his answer. Demetra nodded in understanding. \"Good.\" Carmen said with a nod, \"We'll see you girls tomorrow.\" She smiled. Tomorrow was gonna be quite interesting... To be continued...[Chapter 6] Last Time On Game Of Reality Juni turned back around slowly, ready to speak, \"Listen, give me to tormorrow girls and I promise that one of you will be with me because honestly...I don't want to break either one of your hearts.\" he said innocently but with honesty in his words. \"Sure Juni.\" Demetra smiled sweetly, winking and blowing him a kiss.

Demetra nodded in understanding. \"Good.\" Carmen said with a nod, \"We'll see you girls tomorrow.\" She smiled. Tomorrow was gonna be quite interesting... End Flashback \"Actually Carm..c'mere a sec.\" Demetra spoke up. \"Okay.\" Carmen answered sweetly as she walked closer to Demetra. \"Well...since I was the Deciever..I have no real family to go to..and no place to live.\" Demetra answered sadly. \"I have an apartment a few blocks from here, you can rest there,\" Carmen answered with a little smile. \"Aww Carmen...you are so sweet...\" Demetra smiled. \"I know.\" Carmen giggled. \"Let's go.\" She added happily. \"Your a saint to me..\" Demetra murmured, blushing. \"That's what friends are for.\" Carmen said warmly. Demetra hugged her tight. \"I love you Carm.\" \"I love you too, Demi.\" Carmen hugged her in return. Demetra looked up at her with sisterly admiration in her eyes. \"C'mon. My apartment's not too far from here.\" Carmen smiled at her friend. She was happy to have Demetra live with her. \"Thank you Carmen. You don't have to do this for me. I wasn't even supposed to exist in the human world.\" The dark-haired blue-eyed girl clad in dark purple replied shyly, showing nothing but humility and thankfulness. \"I know but it feels right if I help you out. You're not the 'Deceiver\" anymore, you're Demetra. I want to help you out.\" Carmen said. She no longer saw Demetra as a video game character, a pawn of the Toymaker, now she saw Demetra as a friend and she had no problems helping out a friend Demetra hugged her tight, a few tears of joy escaping. She may have had feelings for Juni, but she owed her human existence in large part to Carmen, and for that, she loved her very much. Carmen returned the hug. Demetra was her friend and without her help there's no way she'd survive in the human world. She felt Demetra's joyful tears land on her shoulder as a sign of gratitude. That was as good as any thank you to her. \"But Carm, I'm still worried. What if Juni doesn't wanna be with me?\" She asked softly. \"Demi. I know Juni dated Gerti before you escaped the game but I'm sure he wants you now.\" Carmen said with faith in her voice. \"And now that you're a human you can make that happen.\" She added happily. \"How can you be so sure?\" Demetra asked. For as cool, pretty and charismatic Demi was, in certain situations, she lacked a good deal of confidence, and unfortunately, this was one of those situations. \"Because you're back and in our world.\" Carmen said, using her well-known confidence and logic to help her. \"Just give him some time to think and really remember just what you two have been through.\" She reassured. \"I trust you. I believe in you.\" Demetra smiled in conviction. \"That's exactly what I want to hear.\" Carmen smiled back as they finally arrived at her apartment building Demetra smiled in awe, getting a look at how the human world lived for the first time. In Game Over, there were no houses or homes to rest in. It was a complete madhouse. In Game Over there was always something around there trying to flatten you, burn you alive, blow you up, or make you fall so Demetra had every right to but surprised at Carmen's dwelling. She even noticed her friend's smile. \"Yeah that's right, you'll be living here.\" She giggled. \"So this is what it's like in the human world when it comes to living.\" Demetra mused. \"And just wait until you see my room.\" Carmen pointed out. They haven't even entered the building yet. \"Then let's see it!\" She squealed. \"Follow me then,\" Carmen smiled, walking ahead of Demetra into the apartment building and over to the elevator, pressing a button to make it move down to the main floor. Once it was there the doors opened so they can head inside. Demetra eagerly dashed ahead. \"Ready to ride your first elevator huh?\" Carmen smiled as she stepped on in. \"Sure am.\" Demetra beamed. \"Then hold on.\" Carmen said as she pressed the '#4' button. Then the doors closed and the elevator moved up. Demetra innocently clasped Carmen's hand. Carmen held Demetra's hand as the elevator moved up one floor, then the next, then the next. \"This is kinda fun.\" Demetra giggled. \"Just one more floor.\" Carmen said as the elevator passed the 3rd floor and stopped right at the fourth. Demetra smiled innocently at her. \"Ready?\" \"Yup. My room is right down the hall.\" Carmen nodded as the elevator doors opened. \"Sweet.\" She giggled. Carmen walked down the hallway of residences, leading Demi down the hall in the direction of her room. Demetra was taking it all in, gazing at the many rooms. \"And now, my room.\" Carmen said as she unlocked the door to her apartment room. Demetra calmly walked in, surveying her surroundings. Carmen's apartment was nicely furnished with some good furniture and some paintings on the wall as well as a couple of plants and a decent television too, \"Welcome to my place.\" \"Thanks Carmen.\" She smiled. \"Make yourself comfy, I know I will.\" Carmen smiled back. Demetra's stomach growled as she blushed. \"You sound pretty hungry,\" Carmen noted, warmly. \"I am, Game Over doesn't exactly offer food.\" She giggled. \"Let's change that then. Anything you want in particular?\" Carmen asked while she walked into the kitchen. \"Nah, make anything.\" She laughed. \"I thought you'd say that.\" Carmen laughed as well. \"I'll make something.\" She smiled. \"Thanks girlfriend.\" Demetra beamed. Carmen, a latina by heritage, decided to make some quesadillas. She saw it as a flavorful way to introduce Demetra to human food. However while the girls were soon enjoying a delicious, Mexican food, miles from where they were however Juni was in a state of stress and decision. The teenage boy was in his room, laying on his bed, in thought of just which girl should he let in his heart. His old flame from years ago Demetra, or his current girlfriend Gerti Giggles. He had about 24 hours to make a decision. The rest of the girls night was peaceful, but Juni was about to receive a fateful phone call...

Demetra's stomach growled as she blushed. \"You sound pretty hungry,\" Carmen noted, warmly. \"I am, Game Over doesn't exactly offer food.\" She giggled. \"Let's change that then.

Carmen, a latina by heritage, decided to make some quesadillas. She saw it as a flavorful way to introduce Demetra to human food. However while the girls were soon enjoying a delicious, Mexican food, miles from where they were however Juni was in a state of stress and decision. The teenage boy was in his room, laying on his bed, in thought of just which girl should he let in his heart. His old flame from years ago Demetra, or his current girlfriend Gerti Giggles. He had about 24 hours to make a decision. The rest of the girls night was peaceful, but Juni was about to receive a fateful phone call... End Flashback Juni's phone then rang as he picked up. \"Yo, Juni Cortez here.\" \"It's Gary, what's up?\" came the voice of one Gary Giggles. Gary and Juni haven't talked much since he allowed Juni to go out with his younger sister Gerti so this was a very interesting phone call in itself. \"Hey man. Things are stressful for me.\" Juni replied calmly. \"I bet they are, Gerti told about what you're going through. I bet you never thought you'd see Demetra again, huh?\" Gary asked, chuckling. \"Yeah, I thought she was lost in that game forever dude.\" Juni replied, clearly in awe of the situation he was in. \"I know. But I just came to call you to say one thing since I know you have a lot on your mind.\" Gary mused. \"Sup man?\" Juni asked. \"I want you to do the right thing and chose Gerti,\" Gary said, frank as could be. \"I don't know man. I've been remembering a lot of the good times I had with Demetra.\" Juni answered, unsure what to do. \"Those were years ago man and besides, Gerti's in love with you now and I know you've had good times with her too.\" Gary coaxed. \"Yeah I have, but Demetra has no one in the world but me and my sister.\" Juni replied. Being that Demetra was designed as a game character, Juni's statement was completely true. \"You and Gerti have been through a lot together. Remember OSS?\" Gary said, trying to get Juni to recall the days where they busted bad guys as spies. \"Of course I remember man.\" Juni said, smiling. \"You and Gerti have been though a lot together and I don't want you to let that go for some girl who just popped back into your life after a few years.\" Gary said. He was trying his best to convince Juni to continue dating Gerti. \"Gary, I really appreciate your help, I really do man, but this is something I have to decide my way.\" Juni replied calmly. Gary sighed a little. \"Fine. But remember, my sister loves you and she's been in love with you for years. She wants to be with you, remember that.\" He said calmly, though there was a slight edge in his voice. \"Thanks man. Talk to ya later dude.\" Juni grinned. \"Welcome man, talk to you later.\" Gary replied Juni hung up, a little smile on his face. The following day Juni was in the center of the park looking his best. His hair was neat, he wore a white and blue hoodie with blue jeans and blue and white low-top Nikes on while he patiently waited on Demetra and Gerti to arrive. Demetra and Carmen came up, followed by Gerti. Gerti was accompanied by her brother. He wasn't going to miss this day for all he was worth and that just put a little more pressure on young Juni. \"Hey bro.\" Carmen smirked a little. This was highly amusing to her. \"Hey sis.\" Juni said to his sister with a furrowed brow. He knew Carmen was going to enjoy this moment of decision, especially if he picked Demetra. Demetra smiled shyly at Juni, clearly lovestruck. Gerti had the same innocent smile on her face. She couldn't wait for Juni to choose her. Carmen gave Juni a nod. It was time for him to choose. Juni took a deep breath. This was going to be the hardest decision that he ever had to make. \"I never thought I'd have to make a decision this hard before.\" he said innocently, looking at both young ladies. \"It's okay Juni, whoever you choose, the other will understand.\" Demetra smiled sweetly. Juni nodded before speaking once again. \"Demetra. Four years ago I thought I'd never see you again after Game Over. You helped me find my sister and even though you decieved me I didn't care. I wanted to save you because you were just a pawn in some video game and now that you're in the real world I'm thinking about you and how we could make up for all of those years you were locked in that game.\" He smiled. Demetra smiled brightly as she nodded. \"But Gerti...Honestly I've had feelings for you since Island of Lost Dreams even though I was too young and dumb to show it. We kicked butt together as spies for the OSS and stayed good friends before we dated, We went out together, had a lot of fun together and you have been an awesome girlfriend and a part of me doesn't want that to change.\" Juni spoke, his tone sweet and caring. Gerti smiled in appreciation, nodding. \"And I had twenty-four hours to decide...and I know which girl I want to be with.\" Juni said Both girls smiled with interest. \"And the person I chose is...\" Juni started Carmen smirked, crossing her arms in anticipation. \"Demetra...\" Juni said through a little lump in his throat. He had to break a heart to save one in this case. To be continued... ","Summary":" A/N: Hey guys, White here with another story, my 4th story in as many days. This one is a major AU "},{"Movie":"Young Guns","Title":"Young Guns Fanfic","Author":"GRIFFINofEMERALD","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11104709","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Just a quick note that any characters from the actually young guns movies are not owned by me, and that although the Moody family were actual people, this story is not relevant to the time period of their existence or to their real life events and personalities. The Moody Mansion in Galveston (although not really built during the time that the story takes place) is a real place. Trust me. I've been there. Like, have literally been inside the Moody Mansion. Look it up. This story is mostly about Chavez and involves an OC pairing with him and Jean McCormick. The appearance of other characters from young guns is not promised but I will look into including them if I can. Like I said, this is about Chavez. Let me know what you think and enjoy. ... Ch.1 Silence Dear Mr. Phalen, I'm gonna' keep this part of the letter short and sweet. I'm dying. You already know that. But I'm afraid that I will not live to see the pardon that we have worked so hard to be granted. Some people say that a man knows when he is going to die. Well, that may be true for me at least, but not all others. Now I'll give you the main reason why I have written this letter. When I die, a history book worth of stories will die with me. Stories that were real. One of these stories is the story of my good friend Chavez. Now I did say that he had died before. Or at least I thought he had. But as it turned out, Chavez y Chavez's story hadn't ended there. No. Far from it my friend. Chavez rode his horse through the deserts of New Mexico with a scowl on his face. You see, that Mexican Indian hadn't really died back there. I had just thought he did. But it looked like his ancestors had a lot more in store for him. A lot more, that's for sure. He had been riding through nothing but waste land for days and was quite nearly out of water, and was defiantly out of food. Suddenly, Chavez heard the sound of trickling water up ahead. He encouraged his horse to pick up the pace, and found a small stream running through the desert. He quickly got off his horse and went to drink when he suddenly heard a rattling sound. He looked to his left and saw a diamond back rattle snake getting ready to strike. The snake rattled louder as Chavez cautiously reached for a knife. \"Shut up,\" he spat, and then flung the knife, decapitating the rattle snake. Chavez sighed with irritation as he pulled his knife from the dirt and wiped the blade with his sleeve. He then saw something out of the corner of his eye. Chavez looked up and saw a figure walking through the heat waves out in the distance. The figure got closer, but the image was still blurry. To Chavez, it appeared to be a person only more shadow like and featureless. Something about it made him want to keep staring, but his instincts told him that it was time to go. He turned to mount his horse and felt something crunch under his feet. Chavez was shocked to find snow under his feet. He looked around to find his horse, but didn't find it. He, instead saw many horses. With people. All lying in what appeared to be, endless snow. Snow that was splattered with red. Chavez felt the bile rising in his throat as his limbs went stiff. He felt a hand on his shoulder. He yelled with fear and anguish as he forced himself around to slice through whoever was behind him, but his blade only hit air. Chavez gasped with exhaustion as he found himself once again surrounded by desert. He looked the other direction and again saw nothing but dry desert. He called for his horse, and saw it trot out from behind a large rock that jutted out from the dirt next to the stream. Chavez grunted with effort as he forced himself to get up off the rocky ground. He approached his horse and stroked its face. \"You can't go wondering off, caballo.\" The horse whinnied in reply. Chavez patted the horse's neck and then mounted. He looked around, trying to decide which way to go. He didn't where he wanted to go, so for a while, he just sat frustrated and tired. Chavez had not an earthly idea who the form was in his vision. All he knew was that he had just been forced, for a moment, to relive that day on the reservation. The day his family had been taken from him. Eventually, Chavez just started riding. We rode on towards the mountains and arrived at the base just before sunset. He made a fire that evening, and sat staring into the flames with his stomach empty. Chavez couldn't get the vision out of his mind. \"What are the spirits trying to tell me,\" he thought. Suddenly, from the top of a tall cactus, he heard an owl. Chavez looked up and saw its large, glowing, yellow eyes. The owl didn't blink at him, or even twitch its head sideways. It just stared straight at him. Chavez was not frightened when the owl suddenly few towards him, and landed on the ground just five feet away. \"Is there something you wish to tell me, my friend,\" he asked. That's when the owl took off again and landed several yards away, next to a peyote plant. Chavez stared at the owl for another moment and said \"I see.\" The owl finally blinked at him, and flew away into the night. Chavez quickly prepared the peyote and painted his face. He let out a ragged breath, and let himself drift off into the spirit world. When he opened his eyes, his surroundings were shrouded in fog. He looked around and saw no one. The rocks that had surrounded his campsite jutted out through the fog like teeth. There was no noise. There were no crickets, and Chavez's horse was gone. The fire was also silent. Sparks from a cracking log flurried up into the air, but no crackling could be heard. The moon and stars were gone as well. The only light was that of the fire. Chavez edged closer to the base of the fire, crossed his legs, and set his hands in his lap as he once again stared into the fire, which had suddenly started to die. Not really knowing what to do, Chavez let the fire slowly flicker out. When the fire was gone he felt a coldness start to spend throughout his body. He pulled his knees to his chest and hugged his legs at it overwhelmed him. Chavez then felt the cold beginning to recede, and the fire returned. He was relieved and then horrified to see that the fire was dying again. This time he cupped his hands around the little flame and blew it back to life. Chavez was very pleasantly warm now, and he let himself enjoy the pleasure of the fire. He then, heard the faint sound of children's laughter. He also heard the laugh of a woman, that reminded him much of his mother's. But suddenly it was day again. The sun was high overhead. Chavez stood up and looked around to find that he was on a beach. The white sand shifted as he moved his feet and the waves crashed down on the shore, but like the fire, all was silent. There were no sea birds or hermit crabs either. Only sand one way and water the other. Wanting to see what would happen, Chavez took a step back from the water, and faster than he could blink, it all soaked into the ground, leaving nothing but dry, cracked dirt. He now had to shield his face from the burning sun. He tasted sand and his eyes were burning red. Chavez once again returned to normal when the water returned. This time, he took a step towards the water. The cool liquid swirled around his feet. Chavez breathed in the crisp ocean air. He heard children laughing again. And with it came a woman's laughter like before. Only this time, it was the laugh of a stranger. Chavez sensed a presence from behind and turned around. He saw the same figure from his earlier vision, walking towards him as the laughter became louder. He realized that it was the figure of a woman, and tried to approach it. Suddenly, he was able to hear the waves as they crashed down on him and swallowed him whole. Chavez could no longer hear laughter. Only the sound of rushing water. Everything suddenly went black.[Chapter 2] Chavez was slowly beginning to regain consciousness. He could hear waves again. Only this time, he could also hear the sound of calling sea birds, and his horse whinnying next to his face. He opened his eyes to find that he was lying on his stomach, on a beach. This beach was different from the beach in his vision. The sand ended about 50 yards from where he lay. That's where grass and flowers took over the warmth of the summer sun. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw his horse eyeing down a tiny hermit crab that was scuffling across the sand. Suddenly, his horse went wild, and he heard a click next to his head. He looked up and saw four men with cocked guns. One thing I can tell you about Chavez, is that the one thing he hated more than waking up face down in a pile of sand, was waking up with a gun pointed at his face. And boy, did it piss him off. \"State yur' business here ya' dirty Mexican,\" one of the men barked. And what pissed him off more, was that he had no idea where the hell he was. Chavez looked up at the man and said in a low tone \"Why don't you tell me?\" Another man demanded \"What's yur' name, boy?\" He responded \"Wouldn't you like to know. Uhh!\" One of the men had kicked him in the side. \"We won't ask you again.\" Chavez scrambled for one of his knives or his gun, but found that he had no weapons on him. Out of desperation, he lunged at one of the men. The others laughed as the stranger pulled out a small dagger and stabbed him in the thigh. Chavez yelled in surprise when the blade struck him. The man then kicked him in the stomach and then the head. The force of the blows sent him toppling over. The rest of the men joined in, kicking and punching him with all their might. Chavez was on the verge of blacking out again, when the men suddenly stopped hitting him and he heard a high pitched voice that had apparently caught the men's attention. The voice said something that he couldn't quite catch, and the voices of one of the men responded. He felt another kick to his head, and he blacked out. Chavez's head spun as he the image of a ceiling formed in his vision. He felt sharp bursts of pain in his thigh where the man had stabbed him. He managed to look towards that direction, and saw the blurry form of the woman in his visions, who appeared to be sewing up the wound. Chavez tried to speak, but couldn't quite get the words out. The woman then held a cup to his lips and forced him to drink a strange, bitter tasting liquid. Afterwards, everything went black again. Chavez woke up again to see the same ceiling. With the faces of five children. Three girls and two boys. The oldest looking child, a girl, who appeared to be 8 or 9, was dressed like a doll. She had pale skin and brown hair. She was holding the smallest of the children, another girl who appeared to be 2, was dressed much like her sister and had the same pale skin. Only her hair was blond. The two boys appeared to be 6 and 4. They both looked very much alike. The same pale skin as the two girls, and dirty blond hair. The last child was a girl who seemed to be the same age as the brown headed girl. She looked nothing like the other children. She had darker skin and dark brown hair with hazel eyes. All the other children had brown eyes. And all five children were just staring at him. Like he was something they'd never seen before. Chavez was getting tired of the silence. \"Can I help you?\" The children suddenly started screaming and spread throughout the room. Their screams made Chavez's head hurt and his ears ring. He sat up and held his ears with a painful look on his face. The children finally stopped screaming and the older boy said \"He's alive! He's really alive!\" The darker girl took a step forward. The other older girl grabbed her hand and said \"No! Mother Jay said not to talk to him!\" That's when Chavez noticed something else about the darker girl. She was dressed like a more common child, while the others were dressed like little dolls. This girl also had messy hair, while the others had neat, combed hair. Suddenly, the woman who had stitched his wound stepped into the room. She had the same darker skin and hair as the other little girl, and was dressed in a servants clothing. Chavez took another look around the room and saw the fancy furnishings. He then realized that he was in a wealthier household. And the woman and the girl must have been staff in the house, while the other children must have lived there. \"All right now that's enough,\" the woman said. She looked at the brown headed girl holding the toddler. \"Mary, take your sister downstairs and go tend to your chickens and rabbits. Your father has been waiting for you for twenty minutes you know. And William, you and your brother need to pick up your toys on the front steps.\" She then looked at the other girl. \"Carrie I've asked you three times already to finish your chores, now go on.\" The children did as they were told, each receiving and giving a kiss on the cheek before filing out of the room. After they were gone, the woman looked at Chavez and said \"I'm sorry. Those children are more curious than a teenage cat.\" She walked towards the bed and helped him get up. While doing so she tried to get his name from him. \"Chavez y Chavez, miss?\" \"Jean McCormick,\" she said. \"It's a pleasure Ms. McCormick,\" he said with a grunt as he set his feet on the floor and tried to stand. \"Careful now, you have a few broken ribs along with that stab wound on your leg.\" \"Ah yes. Thank you for stitching that up for me,\" he said between several painful steps. \"It was no trouble at all, Mr. Chavez.\" she said as she let him sling his arm over her shoulder. \"No trouble at all.\" Ms. McCormick helped him out of the room and into a hallway with large portraits. She stopped and asked \"Do you mind taking the elevator?\" Chavez answered \"No. So where are you taking me?\" \"To see the master of the house. Mr. W.L. Moody.\"[Chapter 3] When they arrived downstairs, an older man in a suit was waiting for them. He had a scowl on his face and looked like an angry bulldog. He reminded Chavez of the judge who has condemned him to hang, after he had been hunted down like a dog just after the Lincoln County War. He decided then that he didn't like this man. One thing I can tell you about Chavez, is that he could tell a good man from a bad one, just by the way he talked. But this man, hell, he didn't to utter a word for Chavez to figure out that he was dealing with one nasty son of a bitch. Chavez looked at the man flatly as he leaned on Ms. McCormick's small frame. \"I'm gonna guess that you're Mr. Moody?\" The old man's scowl deepened as he barked \"No! Hurry up and get him to Mr. Moody, girl! The man's waiting!\" The old man watched as Ms. McCormick did her best to get Chavez down the hall as quickly as possible. Chavez tried not to grunt as they moved along. His ribs were hurting now and he was deeply irritated at the way the old man had spoken to him and the woman who was helping him down the hall. Chavez's angry thoughts were interrupted by the creaking of a large wooden door, which, now that he was looking, apparently lead into a small but well-furnished and decorated library. The walls were covered in patterned red silk and the shelves and chairs were made of some dark wood. Also, in the corner of the room, sat a figure in a chair with its back turned and its head bending close to the surface of a carved mahogany desk. Above the figure hung the portrait of older man, with neatly combed hair and a hard look on his face. The figure turned around to face them as they entered the room. He turned out to look much like the man in the painting. Only much younger and with a less shrinking look in his eyes. The man flatly gave a forced smile and greeted them. \"Ah. I see you've meet Jean. And I'm sure you've been acquainted with Mr. Anthony,\" he said as Ms. McCormick helped Chavez into a chair. \"Anthony?\" \"The man we meet out in the hallway,\" she whispered. \"I'm afraid you'll have to forgive my butler. He's a bit bitter sometimes towards strangers and well... people in general.\" Chavez looked at the man with a cocked eyebrow. \"And you would be...\" The man's fake smile broadened. \"Why, I'm W.L. Moody of course. And I welcome you to my home my dear sir.\" \"It's Chavez, and in speaking of that, why am I here?\" With that, Mr. Moody stood up and started pacing around the room as he spoke. \"Ms. McCormick, who you've already meet, she's my children's nanny you see. She found you on the beach being beaten by a group of men. Those men just so happen to be... acquaintances of mine. Very dangerous they are. But useful. You could be useful yourself.\" Chavez let out a soft chuckle as the man continued to speak. \"You see I am a powerful man Mr. Chavez. And powerful men do have friends...\" He sat back down and looked him in the eye. \"... but they have enemies as well.\" Chavez straightened himself up in his seat. \"A few months ago, a neighboring cattleman appeared at my doorstep. This man's name is Howard Griffin. And he raises 15% of the cattle butchered here in the state of Texas every year.\" Texas. Chavez couldn't believe it. Somehow he had ended up on the Gulf of Mexico in Texas. The first thing that came to Chavez's mind was the spirit world. He must have accidentally traveled from New Mexico to Texas through the spirit world. \"Making him quite the adversary,\" Mr. Moody continued. \"When he arrived on my porch he accused me of stealing 87 new born calves from his ranch. At the time he had two ranch hands with him. Seeing that I raise champion horses, not cows, I'm sure you could have easily understood why I found it so funny that he would accuse me of stealing cows. But, the point is, Mr. Griffin didn't find the matter so tickling. Before I could even catch my breath from laughing so hard one of his ranch hands dismounted and shot my dog. He then proceeded to shoot at me. I of course ran for cover and heard Griffin threaten to come back and really hurt someone if I didn't return his cattle. But of course I have no cattle to return. The man simply won't listen to reason. Just last month his men shot and killed one of my own farm hands. The rest simply left. They were terrified that if they did stay that they would suffer the same fate.\" \"And...\" \"And I was impressed by you Mr. Chavez. Impressed that you were not killed by the first kick. Like I said those men are dangerous. Any normal Mexican wouldn't...\" \"Mexican-Indian,\" Chavez interrupted. Mr. Moody sighed. \"Any normal... Mexican-Indian... wouldn't have lasted as long as you did. Probably not at all. Nearly all of my men are gone now and I need someone of your durability to protect my horses and my family.\" Chavez lightly chuckled at the word 'durability.' \"I am willing to supply you with room, board, weapons, a horse, and a monthly salary of $42, in exchange for your services.\" Chavez looked at him sarcastically and asked \"And these services would include...?\" \"You would join my last few farm hands and assist them in herding the horses into the pastures to graze every morning. You would then accompany Ms. McCormick and my children on any activities and excursions as a body guard. Any sign of trouble from Griffin and his men and you will be expected to hold your ground. If needed you will of course receive medical attention.\" Chavez could hardly hold in his laugh. Partly because he saw Ms. McCormick roll her eyes as Moody spoke, and partly because this man had no idea who he really was and what he had done. Much less the fact that he had ridden with Billy the Kid. He was about to turn down the man's offer, when he felt an all too familiar pang in his gut. Chavez realized that he probably hadn't eaten in the past 72 hours. He also remembered that he had no money and no longer had any weapons. Not to mention that the men who attacked him had probably taken his horse. While Chavez sat, thinking about what to do, Mr. Moody sat back in his chair and waited patiently. He ended up accepting his offer, which made the man smile widely. This time for real. Mr. Moody ordered Ms. McCormick to help Chavez back up to his room and to make sure that he was feed well and given a hot bath. As Chavez and Ms. McCormick slowly exited the library, Mr. Moody called in Anthony and told him to prepare a room for Chavez on the ground floor of the house. With his back turned, Chavez heard the butler leave the library and could feel his angry gaze burning on his neck as the old man watched them slowly move down the hall. Chavez couldn't help but crack a crooked smile.[Chapter 4] Later that evening, Ms. McCormick left Chavez to a hot bath shortly after giving him dinner. He clenched his teeth and hissed as he felt the warm water stinging on his wounds. After easing himself into the water, he leaned his sore back against the back of the tub with a sigh. He was indeed in pain, but enjoyed the feeling of a full stomach. Chavez couldn't get the sour old man from earlier out of his mind. There was something about Anthony that made his skin crawl. One thing he did know was that he hated the way he had spoken to Ms. McCormick, and the way he had glared at them as they passed by. Suddenly, Chavez's head started to hurt. He then decided that he was probably dwelling on something that really meant nothing and tried to relax his mind a bit. His relaxation was interrupted by the opening of the bathroom door. He was surprised to see Ms. McCormick walking into the bathroom with a small pile of folded clothes, while humming plainly. \"Um...can I help you?\" \"Oh! Sorry I didn't mean to startle you. I had just forgotten to put out a set of clothes for you,\" she said in a rather casual tone. She set the clothes down on the edge of the counter top. \"Uh...thank you?\" Chavez couldn't help but ask himself why the nanny would merrily stroll into a bathroom with a naked man inside. Was she not a respectable woman? Jean McCormick suddenly went quiet. She fondled with the neatly folded clothes with a thoughtful expression on her face. Like she was picking out words for the question to follow. \"What was it like riding with Billy the Kid?\" Chavez's eyes went wide. He hadn't thought that anyone he'd meet in this house so far really knew who he was. Apparently she did. He sat in his bath, silent. \"I'm sorry was that rude of me in some way,\" Ms. McCormick asked looking embarrassed. \"N-no. But how did you...I thought...\" \"If you don't want people to know who you are, you should probably change your name. Luckily, Mr. Moody doesn't know the first thing about the wanted criminals in New Mexico. He only cares about the ones here in Texas. In speaking of that, why are you in Texas?\" Chavez just continued to stare at her. She quietly laughed and said \"Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell a soul.\" He let out a relieved sigh and rested his back again the wall of the tub. Ms. McCormick quietly giggled. \"Well anyhow, you still haven't answered my question. What ARE you doing here in Texas?\" \"Well... I uh... don't know. I guess I never really had much of a plan.\" He thought to himself. Much less a plan to end up in Texas at all. Why of all places would the spirits send them here? \"Oh I see. You're just drifting then.\" \"Sure, if that's what you wonna call it.\" She laughed again. Their conversation was interrupted by the sound of screaming children, coming from down the hall. Ms. McCormick stepped towards the doorway. \"Welp, I'd best go put them down for bed before they disturb their daddy. Goodnight Chavez.\" Chavez couldn't help but laugh \"Goodnight Ms. McCormick.\" As she was walking out the door, she turned and said \"And no more of that Ms. McCormick business. It's Jean. That's what all my friends call me. Just Jean.\" She smiled, and left to tend to the children. Chavez gave a sideways smile as she left. He thought to himself. All right then, Just Jean.[Chapter 5] Chavez spent the next week resting. Each day went the same. He'd be woken in the morning by the crowing of the roasters from the pin outside. Mr. Moody used chickens and rabbits to teach his children business and responsibility. He would sit himself up, and right as he would set his feet on the floor, Jean McCormick would peak her head in through the door. He would then give her permission to enter and she would come in with his breakfast and a fresh set of clothes. Chavez would chat with Jean before she left. During the week, he had learned from her that he was on Galveston Island in Texas. He had also inquired about her own self during the week. She told him that she had lived and worked at the mansion for as long as she could remember. The dark headed little girl who had been with Mr. Moody's children was actually her niece. Jean and her niece slept on the ground floor which was used as quarters for all the staff. One morning, she shook him awake. \"Chavez? Get up, it's time to go to work.\" She had woken Chavez from a nightmare. He had gotten little sleep that night. He blinked his eyes open and saw the blurry face of his new friend. \"Up, up, up,\" she urged. He failed to do so, and she yanked his pillow out from under his head and hit him in the stomach with it. She laughed at his loud grunt. \"Ok, ok.\" Jean watched he pull himself out of bed. \"Mr. Moody says it's time for you to get to work. You'll be moving into the servants quarters this evening.\" Chavez smirked as he pulled on his trousers. \"Pff! Guess the welcome party is over huh?\" She laughed. \"Ok. Well we don't have a swim suit for you so I just brought you some old clothes that you can get in the water with if you wish to do so. I already have breakfast, lunch, and the tent packed, so I'll just go down stairs and get the horses ready, and then we'll be ready.\" With that she left. Chavez watched the door shut behind her. He realized that except for the day that she had found him, he had never been to the sea. He wondered what it would feel like to swim in salt water. His thoughts were interrupted by the utterly annoying sound of Anthony's voice booming from down the hall. He thought nothing of it at first, but then he heard a thud and scream that frighteningly sounded like Jean. With his clothes finally on, he grabbed a pistle that Mr. Moody had given him and he ran out into the hall and to the stair case. Chavez's stomach boiled. The old butler was standing over Jean who was lying in an awkward position on the stairs. Neither of them noticed his presence. \"I'll show you to have an attitude with me you little wretch!\" He raised his hand to strike her and Chavez put the tip of the pistle to the back of the old man's head. He said flatly \"You touch her amigo, and I WILL shot you.\" Anthony raised his hands and slowly turned his face around as Jean scrambled to her feet. The old butler had a look of furry on his face. Chavez stared him straight in the face, but addressed Jean. \"Jean go get the horses ready, I'll be there in a minute.\" She did as she was told and left them alone. He pulled the gun from Anthony's head. \"Did anyone ever teach you to mind your own business, Mexican,\" the old man hissed as he lowered his hands. \"Mexican-Indian you son of a bitch, and I don't want to catch you laying a finger on her ever again.\" He opened the barrel of the gun to count how many bullets were in it. \"Who do you think you are, Mexican-INDIAN?\" Chavez looked back up at him and closed the barrel. \"I think I'm her bodyguard.\" He then walked past him and down the stairs. Anthony watched him go, with a look of hatred. Ha ha. Yeah ole' Chavez could be one hell of a wise crack when he needed to be. And one thing he never failed to do, was to piss off anyone who had done the same to him. And he really did consider pulling that trigger. Trust me, I know. He did. Chavez walked outside to find Jean waiting for him. Her cheek was red from where Anthony had hit her. \"Now look, I...\" \"Do you just let him hit you like that? All the time?\" She opened her mouth but then stopped herself. She looked at the ground. \"You're new here Chavez. But soon enough you'll find out that...well, you have superiors. And if you don't pay mind to them then they'll just have to pay mind to you. But not in a good way.\" Chavez just blinked at her as she continued to eye the ground. \"Pay mind indeed,\" she whispered. He let out a sigh and asked \"What did you say to him?\" Jean looked back up at him. \"What did I say to him?\" \"Yes,\" he nodded. She hesitated. \"I...\" She was interrupted by a shrill voice coming from the back door where they had exited the house. They both turned their heads to see the oldest of the children, Mary, with her sister in her arms, Carrie to her left and the two boys to her right, standing by the door. \"We're ready to go now, Momma Jay.\" Chavez looked back at her with a smile. \"Momma Jay?\" \"That's their nickname for me. Come on then children and come say hi to Chavez.\" The children came cautiously like they had never met a stranger in their lives. \"Hello,\" said Mary with a stern look on her face. Carrie said a quick hi and ducked behind her friend. The little one just cooed in her sister's arms. Completely oblivious the new comer's presence. This made Chavez smile. The older of the two boys, William, wrinkled up his nose and said \"He doesn't look all that tough to me. He just looks like a stupid ole' Mexican.\" Chavez chuckled and the boy wrinkled his nose even more. \"Well, I'm sure he's much tougher than you, young man. Now mind your manners and apologize,\" Jean scolded. William turned red and his eyes shifted to the side. \"Sorry,\" he said stubbornly as he shoved his fists into his pockets. Jean nodded in approval and said \"All right then. Let's get going.\" Chavez helped load the children into a small wagon, pulled by a pony. Jean rode her own horse with her reins in one hand and the rope with which she lead the pony in the other. Chavez also rode a horse of his own. A large black filly, with a white star on her forehead. When they got the beach the children screamed in delight. They jumped and chattered around as Jean clumsily put up a tent for them to change in. Once they were all in their swimming clothes, the children were allowed to play in the shallows, as long as little Libby stayed in Mary's arms at all times. Chavez and Jean slowly paced the beach as the children played nearby.[Chapter 6] \"My mother was a Negro-Indian, and my father was a wealthy Irishman,\" Jean said in a plain tone. \"They met when my father was visiting a friend who, well, \"owned\" my mother. His friend owned a saloon and she was house entertainment, and I guess when my father saw her...\" Chavez listened intently. \"...I don't know, I guess it was love at first sight.\" She laughed and continued. \"Well, I guess, if one believes in that sort of thing.\" \"And you don't,\" Chavez inquired. Jean half smiled and said \"I believe in destiny, but not love at first sight. Relationships take time.\" He smiled. \"So what happened with your parents?\" Her smile disappeared. \"Well, when my sister and I were two, when our father passed away, leaving us nothing but dept. My mother had go from place to place working as a maid or a nanny in order to feed us. Luckily she never got pulled back into slave labor.\" She stopped dead in her tracks and stared at the wet sand beneath her feet. \"Something wrong,\" Chavez asked, not knowing what she was doing. Jean slowly bent down, and then snapped her hand into the sand. She held a small hermit crab in her hand. She looked at Chavez and smiled. \"I stepped on it.\" Chavez then felt something scuttle beneath his own foot. He reached down into the sand. He picked up a larger hermit crab, and held it out for Jean to see. She laughed \"Well damn. I guess you beat me.\" Chavez couldn't help but be surprised by the woman's language. He thought to himself, that one would think a nanny with neatly pulled back hair and kind, glittering eyes wouldn't dare utter such words. Despite his surprise he found it rather amusing. In fact, he started laughing. Jean scoffed and said \"What are you laughing about, mister?\" Chavez pulled himself together with a smile and lied \"Nothing.\" Jean then committed another surprising act. She rolled her eyes with a smirk, and then gave Chavez a light punch in the shoulder. She then proceeded to run away towards the children with a childish laugh. Chavez stood there for a second and just watched her run, with a thoughtful half-smile on his face. When the sun began to set, Jean rounded up the children from the water. Once the children were dried and clothed, they all packed up and rode back up to the house. When they arrived home Mrs. Moody was waiting on the front porch for them. She had her arms tightly crossed over her chest with a look of motherly anger and worry on her white powdered face. She stepped toward the group as they approached. \"What on Earth took so long Jean?! You're an hour late, and you had me worried sick.\" \"Oh I'm terribly sorry, Miss. We were just having fun and lost track of the sun,\" Jean smiled as she chirped. Mrs. Moody continued to scold. \"Well, I guess that it's obvious that everyone is fine so I guess it doesn't matter. Bring the children over here for my good night kisses and get them straight to bed.\" The Moody children jumped to the ground and calmly approached their mother. In a single file line, each child received a peck on the forehead, while Carrie hung back with Jean and Chavez. After they had received their kisses, the children followed their nanny into the house as Mrs. Moody and Chavez watched. When they were out of sight the woman turned her head towards the Mexican-Indian and gave him a blank. Chavez tipped his hat towards her. \"Ma'am.\" Chavez heard her mutter something under her breath as she turned away with a frown. She then drifted back into the house without ever addressing him. The woman thought that she had not been heard, but Chavez easily picked up on her quiet insult. Greaser. Chavez woke up to light pouring through the window into his eyes. He slowly sat up. His head was fuzzy and rather heavy feeling. As he turned and put his feet on the floor, he heard the children laughing outside. With blurry eyes he looked down at the yard. It was a hot morning and the heat waves made it harder for him to see. He watched the wavy figures of the children chasing and hiding with high pitched laughter. Chavez shut his sleepy eyes and smiled at the happy sounds of the children. Suddenly, the laughter turned to screams. His eyes would have shot open if it weren't for the fact that his eye lids just wouldn't open. He was just so tired. He then heard the screams of a woman. The screams of the children intensified as something started to snarl. This vicious sound made the hairs on the back of Chavez's neck stand straight up, but he still couldn't open his eyes. He felt his heart fill with fear and dread as he realized that he couldn't even move anymore. The screaming and snarling outside continued as his body slumped to the floor. He tried desperately to get back up to the window, but his arms and legs were so heavy it hurt. In fact, his entire body was throbbing with this heavy pain. He tried to call out for help, but got no answer. Chavez finally recognized the screams of the woman as those of Jean McCormick. His eyes suddenly shot open and all power to move had returned to his body. He hurried to the window to look out, but saw no one. The glass was covered in blood. Chavez woke up from his nightmare with a scream. He launched himself from his bed and fell to the floor with a thud. He groaned as he felt a stabbing pain in his head. A knock at the door startled him, and he once again jumped in surprise. Only this time he jumped backwards, hitting his already throbbing head on the old wooden night stand in his new room in the servants' quarters. When he finally came fully to his senses, he remembered that his room was in the basement, and that it didn't even have a window. The knock at the door came again and he heard the sweet old voice of the maid, Ms. Hulbert. \"Chavez? Was that you screaming, dear?\" Chavez grunted as he lifted himself off the floor. \"Yes ma'am, I'm fine.\" \"Well good. Mr. Moody is out for the day, and the children and Jean will be stuck inside due to the heat. He wants you out helping James today. You had better get up and get going.\" \"Yes ma'am,\" he said as he clumsily tried to pull on his trousers and fell to the floor again. When Chavez had finally gotten himself dressed, Ms. Hulbert gave him some coffee and few biscuits for breakfast. She then led him out into the morning heat. It was only eight o'clock, yet the sun was already beating down on the sandy ground of the island, and the heat waves were already distorting the vision of all who dared to venture outside. The old maid lead Chavez to the barn, where a dusty clothed ranch hand was filling a trough full of water, by carrying buckets from the well and dumping them over in a hurry. Despite the intense heat, Ms. Hulbert chirped at the ranch hand \"Getting ready to take a bath, dear?\" The dusty man looked up at her and then at Chavez. He then smiled. \"No ma'am. I sure do wish though. Who's this feller?\" Ms. Hulbert introduced the two men. \"Chavez, this here is James Griffin. James, this is Jose Chavez y Chavez.\" Chavez winced at the casual mention of his full name. \"He's the young man Mr. Moody hired to keep an eye on Jean and the children,\" she continued. James smiled and said \"I guess the babysitter needed a babysitter herself, huh?\" Chavez lifted an eyebrow at the man. He wasn't wither it was an insult directed towards him or Jean. James just laughed. \"I'm just messing with you, Chavez. Laugh a bit, it's good for the soul,\" he said as he gave a friendly slap to the outlaw's arm. Chavez couldn't help but give a slight, crooked smile. He finally took a good look at him, and saw that he had a friendly smile, along with the familiar smell of dirt and sweat, and dirty stained light-brown hair. He decided that he liked James. Ms. Hulbert then said goodbye to the two and left them to work. They both watched her go and then looked at each other. James slapped Chavez on the back. \"Alright then my friend. Let's get to work.\"[Chapter 7] James lead Chavez over to a worn down old shed, with faded red paint. Chavez's stomach sank as James stopped and casually pointed towards a large bee hive, rested just above the door of the shed. \"You're going to make me help you get rid of that, aren't you,\" he said looking at James. The dusty man chuckled and once again slapped him on the back. \"Yep.\" \"Shit.\" \"So what we're gonna do first,\" James explained \"… is make sure that the water trough over there is all the way full.\" Chavez looked towards the trough that he had seen him filling with water before. \"Then what we're gonna do, is fill up that barrel there and place it right underneath the hive. We both need to make sure that are faces and hands are covered. The only thing that shouldn't be covered, are your eyes, because of course you need to see. Once we've taken care of that you're gonna fill a few buckets full of water. Then I'll take that stick there and knock the hive down into the barrel so that the bees will drown, and if needed you're gonna splash any remaining bees with the water in the buckets.\" Chavez raised an eyebrow and frankly said \"That sounds kind of stupid.\" James laughed and asks \"You have a better idea, friend?\" Chavez thought for a minute and couldn't come up with anything, so he shrugged and accepted defeat. James smiled at victory and said \"Well then let's get to it.\" Chavez did exactly as he said and covered his hands and as much as his face as he could. He then filled two buckets full of water as James placed the barrel underneath the hive. He felt his stomach doing flips as he got ready to grip the handles of the buckets, and James picked up his stick and got ready as well. Chavez thought to himself \"This can, and probably will, go badly.\" James lifted the stick towards the hive and asked \"Ready?\" Chavez braced himself. \"Yeah.\" At that, James quickly went at the hive with the stick and detached it from the shed, but both of their stomachs sank as the thing bounced off the rim of the barrel and landed in the dry dirt. \"CHAVEEEEEEZ!\" Bees shot strait out of the hive and started swarming around the ranch hand. Chavez bolted to his friend's rescue, but instead of hitting the source of the hive he splashed James trying to stop the bees' attack. Unfortunately, it didn't work, and the dirty ranch hand ran for his life and threw himself into the water trough. \"So that's what the trough was for,\" Chavez thought to himself. He was then stunned to feel a sharp sting in his shoulder as an angry bee stung him. Before he could swat the thing away, he felt another sting on his other shoulder. Then a few more on his back and one on his thigh. Chavez felt himself panic as he realized that he was being swarmed himself. He thought to himself \"How are these things stinging me through my clothes?!\" Chavez looked around for a source of water. James was already in the trough and there was no room for another. Then his eyes fell on the well. \"Oh shit,\" he thought as he realized that the well was his only escape. After just a second of hesitation, he ran full speed towards the well and launched himself over the side and into the water. He instantly felt relief from the stinging as the bees that were on him drowned and the others lost interest and flew away. When Chavez couldn't hold his breath anymore and finally broke the surface gasping for air, he heard James calling him. \"I'm down here!\" After a moment, he saw James' head looking down at him. \"What the hell are you doing, Chavez?!\" \"Well how else do you thing I was supposed to get away when you were already in the trough?\" James shrugged and said \"Man. That did not go well, my friend.\" Chavez groaned \"You think?\" It took twenty minutes and the help of the grounds keeper to get Chavez out of the well. When he was finally out and he had taken his shirt off to get rid of the dead bees, James and the grounds keeper were shocked to see how many stingers he had stuck in him. They ended up taking him to Jean. Chavez sat and pouted as Jean laughed at his story of what happened. \"Ha ha. So this was James' plan?\" \"Yes.\" \"And you listened to him?\" \"Yes.\" Jean howled with laughter as Chavez rolled his eyes. \"One thing you should know about James is that he ain't one for ideas. And when he does have one, it's probably not a good one.\" Chavez managed a weak smile and said \"I noticed.\" He then clenched his teeth as he felt a sudden sting on his back. Jean was applying some sort of cream that the red welts on him sting. He hissed in pain and she said \"Sorry. It takes a minute to kick in but it'll make you feel better.\" Jean was almost finished treating him when she got to the stings on his face. Chavez winced as she applied the ointment, making his face sting and itch. He was distracted when he noticed her eyes. They were blue, with yellow around the center. She noticed that he was staring at her. \"What are you staring at,\" she questioned. Chavez didn't answer. He was so transfixed on her eyes that he couldn't tear is own away. Jean let out a half-hearted chuckle. \"It's the eyes, isn't it?\" She continued to laugh as she turned and got a rag. She talked as she wiped some dirt off his face. \"People around here and in the town have always said that my eyes make me look odd. Some of the old ladies from the Catholic Church up the road even think the devil tried to put hell fire into my eyes because I have Indian blood in me, and that that is why I have yellow in my eyes.\" They both laughed at the concept. Jean continued \"While I am a Christian I do believe in genetics. And that is all that there is to the way my eyes look. It's just a plain old genetic mutation. Nothing more, and nothing less.\" \"So most people don't like it then,\" Chavez asked. Jean laughed and continued to clean his face. \"Nope. Like I said, I've got the devil in my eyes,\" she laughed once again at the accusation. Chavez half-heartedly chuckled. Jean gave a questioning look and asked \"What?\" \"Nothing, just people and their resentment towards other people.\" \"I know, but you get used to it. Not that it's something you should have to get used to,\" she said with a half-smile. Jean then continued to treat him, and they were both silent. Just as she turned to leave the room, Chavez grabbed her hand. She looked at him and saw a weak smile on his face. \"Thank you,\" he said softly. While she wasn't exactly sure what he meant, Jean couldn't help but smile as her face turned a wild shade of red. Chavez let go of her hand and to his surprise, she quickly kissed him on the forehead and left the room. After she had left, Chavez let himself fall backwards onto his bed, and for the first time in years he fell asleep smiling. ... Wow. That last part, was an epic fail. LOL! Oh, well. YOLO[Chapter 8] I really wanted to keep this in one part but it's taking forever due to school. So, here ya go, and sorry for the wait. ... Chavez woke up in the middle of the night to find that he was lying on the floor of his bedroom. It was like the bed had just vanished from right underneath him. That's when he realized that he was just in another dream. He got up on his feet and looked around the room. There was no night stand or trunk. Even the old wicker chair that had sat in the corner was gone. He was startled to find that the room now had a window. The same window from his previous dream. Chavez began to back away from the window and he bumped into someone. He turned back around and was relieved to see the face of James Griffin. Breathing with relief he said \"You shouldn't sneak up on me, amigo.\" He looked around again. \"And what happened to the bed and the nightstand and the…?\" Chavez laid his eyes back onto the face of his new friend and realized that it hadn't moved. That casual, friendly smile was frozen in place, and his round, cheerful eyes did not blink or shift. In fact, his whole body was still. Even his clothes and hair did not sway in the warm breeze that was now circling throughout the room. Chavez watched in complete shock as his friend's form turned to sand and sank to the floor in a heaping pile. The brick and wooden walls of his room then turned to sand and sank to the ground, which was now also sand. Chavez looked around and realized that he was at the beach, where he had first awoken and had been beaten by strangers. He heard their hostile voices, and the fading whiney of his horse. He also heard his own shouts of pain and then the pleading voice of Jean McCormick. \" What are you doing?! Leave that man alone!\" He heard that voice of one of the men. \" He's a damn Mexican, Ms. McCormick. You get along and mind yur' own business.\" The shifty, white sand beneath his feet turned to hard, brown dirt with rocks. Chavez then saw that he was back by the corral at the mansion. Like before, he heard voices but saw no one. He heard the same gruff voice from the beach. \" You'd better quit lying out a' yur' ass, Moody! I can and will raise hell!\" Chavez then heard his employer's calm voice in a hush, but couldn't quite make out exactly what he was saying. He was startled, when the form of James Griffin appeared in front of him again. Like before, he was completely still. \"James,\" Chavez managed to say. He was once again chocked to see that face of his friend begin to age right before his eyes. In doing so, that man's face resembled closely, one of the men that had found and beaten Chavez on the beach. Chavez then woke up with a start. Like the morning before, he accidently threw himself from his bed and hit his head on the down to the floor. This time the force of the blow made his brain rattle, and his vision blurred terribly. Chavez pushed himself up off the floor and grunted \"Maldita sea!\" He rubbed his aching head and got up on his feet. His head swirled as he dressed himself and walked out of his room. He got outside and noticed that it wasn't as hot as it had been for the past few weeks, and the air was crisp and cleaner. \"El otono,\" he muttered to himself. Chavez was slightly startled when he suddenly heard James' voice. \"What was that,\" the once again, already dirty man asked. \"Autumn. It's coming closer, my friend,\" he answered. \"How can you tell?\" \"How can you not? Just taste the air. You can sense it.\" James gave the Mexican- Indian a funny look. \"Taste the air?\" \"Never mind, amigo.\" Chavez waved his hand, dismissing the subject. James smiled and said \"Anyway, Mr. Moody and the Mrs. are taking the kids into town today along with Ms. McCormick, so I suggest you put on some better clothes and comb yur' hair. The locals don't take kindly to people walkin' around looking like vagrants and what not.\" Chavez rolled his eyes and muttered \"Sounds familiar.\" James chuckled at him and they heard someone bust through the back door. They both frowned when they saw the face of the butler, Anthony. He looked straight at James and barked \"Boy, you'd better get your ass moving and get the horses ready! Mr. Moody is ready to leave!\" James lifted his hat in acknowledgement as the old man continued to yell. He then turned to Chavez. \"Try not let it bother you, friend.\" He said over his shoulder as he headed towards the barn \"And wash yur' face. Don't go to town lookin' like me.\" Meanwhile, Anthony was still yelling. \"Boy, are you listening to me?!\" Chavez looked at the old man's scowling face, and couldn't help but laugh at the fact that he was screaming like a little brat. Anthony heard him and snapped \"Quiet, Navajo!\" Chavez stopped laughing and frowned as an ugly grin spread on the butler's face. \"And clean yourself up. You look like shit.\" As he then turned around to go back inside, Jean rushed out the door and ran into him, nearly knocking him into the dirt. Anthony's face filled with rage as he completely forgot about Chavez. He grabbed Jean by the arm and just about to strike her when Chavez yelled. \"No la toque!\" The old butler turned his head towards the Mexican- Indian and glared at him. Chavez responded by glaring back. Anthony slowly let go of Jean's arm and turned his glare to her. He then turned around and silently went back into the house. Then, as if nothing had happened, Jean trotted towards Chavez and grabbed his arm. \"Come on then. You need to put on some better clothes,\" she said as she tried to pull him towards the house. Chavez planted his heels in the dirt and yanked his arm from her. Jean looked at him with surprise and put her hands on her hips. \"Now just what is the matter with you?\" Chavez glared into her eyes and said \"You. Are you ever going to fight him back?\" Jean's face softened and she dropped her hands to her sides in awkward silence. \"Well?!\" \"Why do you care so much?!\" Chavez sighed as he saw a tear roll down her face. She turned from him and sobbed \"It isn't such a big deal anyway. So what if he hits me? It's not the worst thing he could do.\" Chavez managed to calm himself. \"Then why are you crying, amor?\" She turned and looked at him as she wiped her tears away. \"You still haven't answered my question.\" \"You haven't answered mine either.\" \"I don't care. I want an answer.\" Chavez sighed again and walked closer to Jean. He surprised her a little as he took her in his arms and hugged her tightly. Jean felt another tear roll down her cheek as well as his hand wiping it away. She felt the heat rise to her face as he planted a delicate kiss on her forehead. They then let go of each other, and Chavez walked back to the house to get dressed in silence, leaving Jean outside. Chavez rode next to the family carriage in silence. The cool air of the early morning had been replaced with the glaring sun. He felt sweat dripping down his forehead as he listened to Mrs. Moody complaining in the carriage. In order to salvage the last of his patience, he looked towards Jean who was riding her pony on the other side of the carriage, hoping to find a smiling face. He was disappointed by what he saw. Jean had her head down, and her eyes were covered from his view by the rim of her straw hat. She too was dripping with sweat. Chavez, however, felt his stomach sink when he realized that her face was also wet with tears. \"And here we are,\" Chavez heard Mr. Moody say. He looked up to see that had finally approached the town. It was much bigger and livelier than he had anticipated. Many of the shops were new and painted in bright colors. The booming voices of street-side venders echoed, while children ran through the streets dodging horses and carriages. As they passed through the center of town, Chavez noticed the sheriff's office as well as the county jail. He felt a fire spark in his belly as his eyes meet those of the man who had been haunting his dreams, and the same man who had nearly beat him to death on the beach. \"Howard Griffin,\" Mr. Moody said in a low voice. The man was leaned back in a chair on the porch of the sheriff's office, and had a badge in the shape of a star on his chest. Chavez glared at the man as a crooked smile spread across his face. Mr. Moody noticed and said \"It seems as though he's been made the new sheriff. Don't you worry about him, though. I'm sure the marshal is keeping a very close eye on him.\" Despite Mr. Moody's words, Chavez couldn't tear his eyes from the gaze of Howard Griffin. In fact, he was relieved when the carriage turned the corner and he was made to follow on his horse.[Chapter 9] I am soooooooooooooooooooooooooo sorry that this took so long. I literally just spend the past four hours writing in super sayan mode. I hope ya'll enjoy this and PLEEEEEEAAAAAASE leave comments and critiques! Thanks! ... The old family carriage creaked as Mr. Moody brought it to a stop in front of the bank. As the man lifted his children from the structure, his wife managed to spit one last malicious comment on the poor old thing before stepping down herself. \"It creaks and makes for a very uncomfortable ride,\" she hawked. Mr. Moody silenced his wife with a kiss on the head. \"Hush now, Dear. I have business in the bank to attend to. Take the children to have them fitted for new shoes. Take Jean with you.\" He then looked to Jean and Chavez who had just tied their horses in front of the bank. \"Mr. Chavez, you accompany them as well.\" Putting his hand it front of his face to hide his mouth from his wife he whispered \"And keep an eye out for trouble.\" He winked. Chavez nodded as he put a shadowy hat on his head. Mr. Moody then proceeded into the bank. Mrs. Moody let out an irritated sigh and herded her children around her. \"Alright then. You heard your father. Come along, Jean.\" She motioned toward the nanny, but did not acknowledge her guard. Chavez followed anyway, without a word. As they approached the front door of the shop, Chavez noticed men, women and children staring at him with concern. He saw an elderly woman glare at him through the shop window with disgust. Jean saw his and managed to say \"Perhaps it would be best if you stayed outdoors.\" \"As if coming inside were ever an option, Jean,\" Mrs. Moody barked. She gave him a hard look. \"Stay out here and stay out of everyone's way! Better yet, stay out of sight!\" Mrs. Moody then pushed her children into the doorway, and Ms. McCormick followed. Chavez quietly obeyed, and tucked himself behind the shadow of a water barrel. While the air near the ground was dusty and dry, he couldn't help but find relief from the sun, provided by the shade. He realized how his eyes burned with heat, sweat and dirt as he noticed a small lizard scuttle across his boot. Chavez leaned his head against the wooden structure of the shop and closed his stinging eyes. After a moment, he slowly began to doze off. His short moment of peace was interrupted by the distressed call of a voice he had grown extremely used to. Chavez shot up from the ground and whipped around to see Jean and Mr. Moody's family standing on the porch of the shop, staring in fear towards the bank. He drew his gun and fired a shot when he saw Mr. Moody pushed to the ground by a man that seemed familiar. The warning shot had gotten the man's attention. He stared at Chavez as the Mexican-Indian stalked closer. He got a closer look at his face, and Chavez realized that it was one of the men who had beat him at the beach. This man also had the star of a deputy on his vest, and Chavez couldn't help but chuckle. \"What's so funny, Greaser? You just took a shot at a man of the law. I could throw your rotten ass in prison.\" \"I just couldn't help but think how sick I am of dealing with you people.\" \"Careful, Greaser. You'd better respect the law.\" \"I've had my fare taste of the law. I've even been a part of it for a short time. No, I mean men like you, who seem to see justice in beating a man half to death on the beach. If I can even call you a man.\" The deputy growled as he drew his gun \"I'll show you justice, you Mexican bastard!\" A firm hand grabbed his wrist as a fist met his jaw. Chavez was almost surprised to see Howard Griffin standing with his deputy's gun in hand. He had a malicious grin on his face as he looked at the deputy, who was now clutching his face on the ground. \"My apologies, Mr. Moody,\" he said as he cocked the gun. \"This moron is my new deputy.\" Chavez turned back towards the shop. Mr. Moody, during the distraction, had managed to get back to his frightened family. Jean looked straight at Sheriff Griffin with a look of terror. Mr. Moody said flatly as his nose bleed \"You haven't been in office very long either Mr. Griffin.\" \"So you noticed,\" the Sheriff said, showing off the star. \"Well I'm quite honored to serve our city.\" \"As I am sure you are,\" Mr. Moody said. Howard Griffin let out a mean chuckle. \"Good day Mr. and Mrs. Moody,\" he began to turn around and stopped. He looked back, directly at Jean McCormick. \"You too, Ms. McCormick.\" He whistled as he walked away, with his pitiful deputy following. Despite the stubborn arguments of his wife and the nervous state of Jean, Mr. Moody made a point to make sure that all of the family's business in town was finished by the afternoon. The group traveled back to the mansion in silence, as the children had fallen asleep and Mrs. Moody finally shut her mouth, much to angry with her husband to speak. Chavez couldn't take his eyes from Jean, who had done nothing but jump at every sound and movement since the morning. When they finally arrived home, the young woman quickly put away her pony and took off towards the barn in wild tears. Mrs. Moody scoffed \"Useless girl.\" Chavez was finally relieved of her presence as she herded her sleepy children into the house. Mr. Moody, however, remain and watched his family disappear into his home. He turned to Chavez. \"Go on then Chavez. Go calm her down and talk some sense into her,\" he said with a sly smile. Chavez gave him a polite nod and walked towards the barn. He couldn't help but stop in front of the barn door for a moment. He could hear Jean's soft cries coming from inside. Despite not even knowing what to say, he carefully pushed the door open and stepped inside. She heard the door creak open and went silent. \"Jean?\" Chavez's stomach dropped when there was no answer He thought to himself \"She's angry with me.\" \"Jean, answer me. I know you're here, amor.\" \"Stop calling me that,\" she managed to say in a sob. Chavez let out a sigh and climbed up into the hay loft. Jean was curled up on a pile of hay with her hands covering her face. Chavez carefully inched closer to her. \"Jean,\" he said as he reached for her wrists. When she felt his fingers on her hands she lunged out and pushed him away. She curled up even tighter and buried her face into her knees. Chavez was sad that she pushed him away, but was not going to give up. He crawled over to her again and whispered \"Jean, please…\" As Jean's body finally relaxed, Chavez wrapped her up in his arms. She let in and rested her crying head against his chest as he stroked her messy hair. They sat like this until it got dark. Jean was so exhausted from the events of the day that she could hardly walk. When they finally managed to exit the barn, Chavez picked her up and carried her to her room. Chavez silently sat on the edge of Jean's bed with his back towards her as she brushed her hair. The silence was getting old to him. \"I understand now.\" She stopped her strokes as she heard him speak. \"Why are you so afraid, amor?\" She looked at him with sad eyes and sat down next to him. She brought her cold feet up onto the bed and tucked underneath her white nightgown. It took her a moment to finally speak. \"Because, fear has kept me alive.\" Chavez was horrified by her terrible logic. He stared at her and she turned her head away. He went to touch her cheek and she flinched. He took his hand away and thought for a moment. \"Why….are you so afraid of me?\" Jean heard this lunged to hug him with new tears streaming down her red cheeks. He was slightly taken aback, but Chavez hugged her back and let out a sad breath. \"People, especially those I've loved, have had a tendency to hurt me or leave me,\" she said through her sobs. \"Jean,\" he started but was interrupted. \"And, I'm afraid….that you will do the same.\" His heart fluttered for a second. \" She loves me,\" he thought to himself. \"Jean, look at me.\" She sniffled as he brought her face up to look at him. \"Now….do I look like a man who would abandon or damage something that he loves?\" Jean's tears stopped as he spoke. \"If you really fear me for something like that….well….that's just not worth the energy because it isn't true.\" She realized what he was trying to say and hugged him again. He returned her hug with an embrace he hadn't used before. After a few minutes of silence, Chavez took her chin and brought her face closer to his. She saw something in his eyes that usually would have worried her, but tonight she wasn't worried about any consequences. Jean's stomach did cartwheels as she was kissed for the very first time. Chavez slowly broke the kiss, and then brought his lips to hers again. Before long they were completely unaware of any consequences and were laying down on the bed, wrapping each other in their arms. Chavez reached for the oil lamp, and slowly made the room go dark.[Chapter 10] Chavez and Jean woke up early the next morning naked in each other's arms. Chavez was the first to wake. He felt Jean's head resting on his chest and his stomach felt warm and happy. He let out a tired but content sigh as he lightly patted her head to wake her up. Jean lifted her head and gave him a sleepy smile. She moved closer to where her head could rest on his shoulder as she said \"Good morning.\" Chavez smiled and kissed her forehead. \"We'd best be getting up and around before anyone else does.\" Jean sat up and stretched her arms as she asked \"What time do you think it is?\" \"The sun is just about to rise, so probably around six,\" he answered. Then, after Jean had stretched, Chavez sat up and wrapped his arms around her torso. He placed his lips on the crook of her neck and gave her tender little kisses. She let out a happy sigh and kissed his head. \"I'd rather just stay like this all day,\" he said, earning a giggle and another kiss from his lover. After a few minutes of playful kisses, the two finally dresses themselves and quietly went outside. They sat on top the coral and watched as the sun arose from the horizon. Chavez held Jean's hand as the orange light began to turn yellow. Before they went back to the house, where they would have to restrain themselves due to the importance of total secrecy, they shared one more kiss. Just as they parted lips, they heard James approaching as he sounded a good morning whistle. \"What are ya'll doin' up and out so early,\" he asked once he was close enough. Jean answered \"Just showing Chavez a Galveston Island sun rise.\" James chuckled \"That's right. He's never seen a sun rise from our island. Well it's a good thing you got that out of the way, Jean.\" He tipped his head back and let out a hearty laugh as Jean rolled her eyes and Chavez smiled. When the ranch hand was done laughing he said \"Any way, it's the boss's birthday today. He's having friends over for dancing and dinner, and get this, Chavez. He wants you and Jean to join them. Of course Jean will be helping in the kitchen, but ya'll get to sit at the big dining table and everything!\" Chavez gave him an inquisitive look and asked \"Why would Mr. Moody want us to come to dinner, and how did he convince his wife to let us?\" \"Well that's easy. He likes ya', and it's his birthday, not hers. \"I see. What do you think,\" he asked Jean. She smiled and said \"Well it's not like we can just say no.\" Chavez smiled and asked \"What about you, James? Are going to be there?\" \"Pshh! Naw'. The boss and the misses don't have any interest in an old slob like me. Sides', I really ain't one for parties anyway. Jean, I'd go and help in the kitchen if I were you, and you might wonna' pull out something for him to wear. He can't go to a party lookin' like a greaser.\" At that James strolled towards the barn as Jean gave Chavez an excited smile and ran towards the house. Later that evening, Chavez inspected himself thoroughly in a mirror. Jean had set him out a pair of black trousers with a clean white shirt and a grey vest. His hair was also neatly pulled back and his shoes were shined. He gave himself a smile of satisfaction as he suddenly heard the door open. Jean shyly peaked her head through the door and gave him a blushing smile. \"Well, don't just stand there. Let me see you,\" he insisted. She slowly opened the door and stepped into the room. Chavez couldn't help but grin at the sight of her. She had on a long blue skirt, and a white Spanish blouse that hung over her shoulders. Her hair was up as usual, but it was a bit more loose, and he had one wavy strand hanging in her face. \"I know it might seem a little unbecoming of a lady, but it was all I had,\" she muttered as she stared at the floor. Before she could even look up, Chavez had his arms wrapped around her waist. \"I think you're beautiful, anyway.\" Jean looked at him and her already red face turned a darker shade of crimson. Just as he was about to kiss her, there was the sound of a little voice near the doorway. The two looked towards the door and saw Carrie, standing there in a little yellow dress, with her arms crossed and a suspicious look on her face. \"You two are awfully close. Aren't you,\" she said with a huff. Chavez chuckled as Jean stooped down and picked up her niece. \"I'll be down stairs in a moment,\" he said as she winked and left the room. When Chavez came down stairs, Anthony was holding the door open for an older couple who were talking and smiling as they entered. With them they had a young boy, who looked around with curiosity. When Chavez caught the boy's eye, the couple noticed. Anthony seethed with jealousy as the man introduced himself and shook hands with Chavez. The man also introduced his wife and the boy, who turned out to be their youngest son. \"Our little Johnathan here, was a surprise,\" the woman chirped in a friendly voice. \"A blessing to both of us in our old age…\" she tried to continue, but was interrupted by the boy. \"Are you a Mexican?\" This earned laughs from his parents, as well as a chuckle from Chavez. \"Mexican-Indian, actually.\" \"Do you scalp people?!\" This made Chavez laugh, and he patted the boy on the head. He jokingly said \"Only on Wednesdays.\" The couple laughed and shook hands with him again, and then went to the dining room. Chavez watched them go with a smile. He didn't mind meeting folks who weren't hateful towards him for his race. He then heard someone clear their voice from behind him. Anthony stood strand as a post, looking into the Mexican-Indian's eyes with profound intensity. Chavez only turned and stared straight back. \"Don't be getting big headed, boy. Your nothing but a Greaser, and that's all you ever will be.\" \"You're a persistent old man aren't you?\" \"Hold your damn tongue before I rip it out,\" the old man scowled. All Chavez could think to do was roll his eyes and walk away, but as he entered the hallway, he felt the old man's foot catch his ankle, and he fell to the floor with a thud. He looked up at Anthony, who was now standing right over him with a malicious frown. Chavez simply let out a sigh as he got up. He brushed himself and quietly walked away, kind of embarrassed that the old man had been able to trip him. When Chavez entered the dining room, there were three visiting families at the table along with the Moody's, as well as Jean and Carrie. Jean flashed him a smile while Carrie only scowled at him. Chavez happily sat down next to Jean and gave her a smile in return. They spent the next two hours, laughing and listening to idle chatter over dinner. The older couple that Chavez had met before, told stories that made everyone, even Mrs. Moody laugh. Mr. Moody requested \"Jean, would you be so kind as to go and cut slices of cake for everyone?\" Jean smiled and said yes. Chavez watched her closely as she walked into the kitchen. As the chatter picked back up, Chavez continued to stare at the door. He hadn't seen anything of Anthony in a few hours, which made him wary. The older man from earlier saw his distant gaze and inquired \"You're awfully fond of that one, aren't you?\" Chavez now had a vulnerable look on his face. All eyes had been turned towards him. He looked around with nervous eyes and scanned everyone's faces. Mr. Moody had his eyes fixed on Chavez with a half surprised glint. His wife, however, narrowed her eyes while Carrie and the other two little girls giggled and rolled their eyes. The other adults in the room almost leaned forward in interest. Chavez thought to himself \"Shit! This could be bad for us!\" He continued to be silent. Finally, Mr. Moody broke the silence. \"Well if I didn't know any better, I'd say you fancy the girl, Chavez,\" he said as he couldn't hold back a smile anymore. Chavez was still silent, and the room erupted into laughter. He felt his stomach churn as he noticed Mrs. Moody glaring at him. It was then that she spoke \"Enough of that, William. That's so inappropriate!\" He laughed \"You can relax, Chavez. I was only yanking your chains.\" \"I didn't mean that,\" Mrs. Moody angrily muttered under her breath. Chavez felt his heart stop, as he heard a sudden crash coming from the kitchen. Before he, or anyone else, could even turn to look towards the door, Jean flew out of the kitchen, falling backwards as plates of cake crashed and shattered on the floor. She landed on her back on the glass covered floor, lodging several pieces in her back, and cutting one of her wrists. The room was dead silent, until Mrs. Moody stood strait up out of her chair and screeched \"Jean McCormick, what is the meaning of this?!\" Then there was voice from the kitchen. \"Damn!\" Chavez's vision turned red, and his body froze in pure fury, as Anthony slowly stepped out into the dining room. The old butler stared at Jean's unconscious body, and then at Mr. Moody. He stuttered \"Sir, I…I…\" \"Anthony? You did this,\" Mr. Moody asked in shock. Before he could answer, Chavez flew from his chair and landed a solid punch on the side of the man's head, sending him crumbling to the floor, unconscious. Chavez was quick to take her down to her room where he could look at her. With Carrie hot on his heels, he sat her down on the bed and franticly searched for a rag. The cut on her wrist was bleeding badly, and she had just woken and was crying in pain. Mr. Moody sent his children to find James, so that someone could keep an eye on Anthony. He then pursued Chavez down into the servants' quarters with his wife furiously protesting behind him. He entered Jean's room to see Carrie crying at the side of the bed, and Chavez desperately pressing onto Jean's wrist with a rag. Chavez looked at him with anger and fear in his eyes. \"Maybe I should fetch the doctor,\" Mr. Moody suggested, but was again intersected by his wife. \"Don't worry about getting a doctor, she'll be fine! I want to know what is going on here!\" He tried again \"What if I at least got some medicine and…?\" \"No! She's fine! Sew her up on the bed for all I care!\" \"SHUT UP,\" Chavez half shouted, half screamed. \"Just get Carrie out of here! I need a needle and thread, a bowl and knife, bandages and rags, and as much alcohol and pain killer you can find.\" Mr. Moody ended up having to drag Carrie out, kicking and screaming. He later brought five bottles of whiskey and some pain medicine for headaches. Once the bleeding was under control, Chavez took a bottle and put it to her lips to drink. He then made her take all the pain medicine. He then made her sit up so he could look at her back. \"Ch-chavez…\" she weakly sobbed. \"Don't try to talk! Save your energy!\" Chavez then took the knife and braced himself. \"Forgive me.\" With one swift motion he sliced off her blouse, and then her corset with another. He flipped her onto her stomach so that he could get the glass out of her back, but she struggled against him. He ended up having to hold her down while she sobbed violently. When the medicine and booze kicked in and she was quiet, Chavez carefully started taking glass out of her back. It took two hours and three bottles of whiskey to fix Jean up. When Chavez was done, the bed and floor was covered in blood. He looked at his crimson stained hands and wanted to sob like Jean had. He cleaned her up and brought her to his room, where she could rest on a clean bed. Mr. Moody came to check on them and saw that she was going to be alright. \"Should I get Carrie,\" he asked. \"No. Jean needs to rest and stay still, but do tell her that her aunt is going to be okay.\" Mr. Moody nodded his head and went to tell Carrie the good news. Chavez looked Jean over one last time. He had wrapped her entire midsection in bandages in order to limit her movement, but her chest, shoulders and arms were still bare, and she was beginning to shiver. Chavez removed his vest and shirt. The white fabric of the shirt was stained with blood, but he wanted to cover her up. He managed to set her up one more time and slip the large shirt onto her small, hurting body. Jean managed to give him a weak, drunken smile as he tucked her beneath the sheets. He heard a knocking at the door way. He turned his head to see that it was James. The ranch hand spoke quietly \"Sorry to turn your attention the other way, Chavez, but Mr. Moody says there's unfinished business to attend to.\" Chavez sighed and said \"Tell him I'll be out in a moment.\" James nodded and left as quietly as he had come. Jean slowly turned her head to look at Chavez. \"I think you've saved me again,\" she weakly chirped. Chavez looked at the bandages on her wrist and felt like he would break down. He tried to sound cheerful \"J-just returning a favor, amor,\" but his voice cracked, and a tear fell down his face. She then tried to move her injured wrist toward his face, but he gently caught her. \"Don't… don't try to move.\" Jean obeyed and brought her arm back into a resting position. Chavez wiped his face dry and kissed her head. \"I love you. I'll be back shortly. Try to get some sleep,\" he said. Closing her eyes, Jean whispered \"I love you too.\" ... Thank ya'll so much for being so patient with me. It's my senior year in high school and life is a little crazy. I do plan on finishing this story, and I might even start a new idea that I had for young guns afterwards. I'll try to have the next chapter within the next few weeks. (But no promises on that one) Please leave lots of reviews and comments. I love feedback more than anything in the world. Thanks guys![Chapter 11] Please leave comments and critiques because I feel like this one was written way to fast. I did it in like a few hours. Let me know if it seems rushed. I'll try to get the next part of the chapter out as soon as I can. Life and school have been crazy. Thanks. ... Chavez went up the stairs of the servants' quarters and exited through the back door of the house, wanting to have just a moment alone to clear his head. He almost busted the door off its hinges as he ran out into the night air, and found himself gasping for air as the rage boiled in his stomach and lungs. The angry young man then slammed his fist again the stone wall of the house and let out an agonizing wail. He had almost failed to protect what he loved most. He wasn't even sure that she would recover. As he realized this, tears began to fall down his face as he worked up the gut to go and face the man who had almost killed his love. Chavez walked around to the other side of the house and met James, Mr. and Mrs. Moody and Anthony. Anthony was sitting on the steps of the porch with a rag on his bleeding head. He looked up at Chavez with an expression that hadn't been seen before. The Mexican-Indian looked into the man's eyes, and saw fear. James and Mr. Moody attempted and failed to restrain Chavez as he approached the older man. Anthony was quickly greeted with another solid punch to the head. He tried not to look up as his attacker screamed \"Look at me!\" Anthony slowly brought his head up and stared into Chavez's eyes. He was silent, but Chavez could see that he was on the verge of begging for mercy. However, the young greaser was not deterred. \"Chavez, that will due. Anthony, you are fired. Take your belongings and your horse and be gone by tonight,\" Mr. Moody ordered. Everything was silent for a moment, until Chavez spoke to Mr. Moody. \"Tell me. Have the boy and his family gone?\" Moody nodded yes, with a look of concern for Anthony in his eyes. Every heart skipped a beat as Chavez slowly pulled out a knife from his boot. \"Good.\" He went to stab the butler, when he heard a click from behind his head. He slowly turned to see James pointing a rifle right at his skull. He could see the other young man shaking. \"Come on now, Chavez. I don't wonna' have to do this,\" his voice quivered. He heard Anthony breathe a sigh of relief as Mr. Moody tried to step forward and said \"James, lower your gun!\" The young man shouted \"Shut the hell up!\" Horses could suddenly be heard approaching the mansion. Chavez heard drunken laughter and gunshots as Howard Griffin and his deputies came closer. \"Everyone get inside and grab a damn gun,\" he shouted over his shoulder. The Moody's obeyed and hurried into the house. Chavez turned to see Anthony stand up with a crooked smile and a glint of anticipation in his eyes. James just stood there and continued pointing the gun at him, and he felt himself tense with realization. \"What is this, you son of a bitch?!\" \"I SAID SHUT UP!\" Chavez felt a gun hit the back of his head, and blacked out before he even hit the ground. Chavez felt his nostrils sting, and he woke up to the taste of ash and smoke in his throat. As he managed to open his eyes, he saw that the house had been burned to the ground. Jean was next to him, holding something large in a bundle. There was blood on her hands. A few members of the staff were standing around the wreckage, yelling and crying out things that Chavez couldn't quite understand as his head swam. Mrs. Moody held her children as they sobbed into her skirt. Her eyes were wide with fear. Mr. Moody, Howard Griffin, James and Anthony were all gone. As he finally came to his senses, he heard Jean wailing in what sounded like agony. He hurried to her side, but something stopped him when he got to her. The shirt that he had used to cover her was draped over the bundle in her arms. Chavez carefully lifted the cloth away and was horrified by what he saw. Lying in the woman's arms, was the black, burnt corpse of her niece. \"CARRIE!\" ","Summary":" Just a quick note that any characters from the actually young guns movies are not owned by me, and "},{"Movie":"Spy Kids","Title":"Reinstated","Author":"Ginger Redwood","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11161240","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter One A/N: Sorry if any information in this is wrong.

Please read and review! \"Carmen, are you nearly ready?\" Mrs Cortez called through the door. \"Nearly, mom,\" Carmen replied. That evening, the Cortez family were attending the annual OSS Ball and Carmen was just putting the finishing touches to her outfit. Her father Gregorio Cortez had been made Head of the OSS just a year earlier and he was now hosting the ball. Carmen sighed. She wasn't so sure if she really wanted to go to this ball. But she was a Level 1 Spy-Kid now after the success of the mission a year ago and it was her duty to go with her family. \"Ready, mom,\" said Carmen as she closed the door of her bedroom. \"Oh my, Carm, you look wonderful,\" Ingrid Cortez smiled, clapping her hands together. Carmen looked down at herself. The red velvet dress was just something she had found in the back of the wardrobe, matched with silver shoes. Her dark hair was swept up in an elaborate bun with a silver hairpiece with just a few curls hanging loose at the front. \"Um, thanks, mom. Are we going now?\" \"Come on,\" Ingrid smiled and led the way to the car. \"Nice dress,\" said Juni Cortez with a grin. He straightened his bow-tie with one eyebrow raised. \"Thanks,\" said Carmen. She lent over and ruffled his ginger hair. \"Hey!\" Juni protested. \"Stop it, kids,\" said Ingrid. \"Let's go.\" The venue glittered with light and long banners hung suspended from the ceiling. There were tables of drinks and light refreshments and a large dance floor. The Cortez family stepped inside, now acknowledged by all due to Gregorio's promotion to Head. Many heads turned their way and though Juni soaked up the attention, Carmen felt strangely subdued. She wasn't sure balls were her thing. \"Ah, Miss Cortez,\" said the voice from behind her. Carmen spun on her heel. She turned to see none other than the blond-haired Gary Giggles. He wore a smart tuxedo and polished black shoes. His hair was gelled back but his eyes were as blue as ever with that calm, collected expression that was just on the verge of a smirk. \"If it isn't Mr Giggles,\" Carmen replied. \"You're looking wonderful tonight,\" Gary complimented her. \"Thank you,\" said Carmen, feeling slightly confused at all this. She made certain not to show it on her face though. \"And well done to your father on his promotion,\" Gary continued. \"Would you like a drink? It's secretly peach soda.\" Carmen took the glass from him. \"So you're back in the game then, Gary? I thought you were suspended.\" \"I was,\" said Gary, taking a sip of his soda, \"but they let me back in. Needed all the spy-kids they could get, you know.\" \"I see you haven't changed,\" Carmen said. \"Oh, but that's what you don't see,\" said Gary, leaning in closer before adding in a whisper, \"I have.\" \"Carmen,\" Juni interrupted, coming over to them, \"can I talk to you for a second? In private?\" Carmen shot him a look. \"Yes, Juni, I'm coming.\" Juni led her off to one side. \"What do you think you're doing?\" he hissed, \"Talking to him ?\" \"He's not that bad, Juni,\" said Carmen with a sigh. \"He a whole load of trouble and I'm not having you getting hurt,\" Juni said firmly. \"Gary's not a bad guy!\" Carmen protested. \"It's not his fault his dad wanted to take over the world!\" \"You're only saying that because you still have a crush on him,\" said Juni tauntingly. \"I don't!\" objected Carmen, though she felt her cheeks starting to burn. \"I am so over that. It shouldn't be a problem if I just talk to him.\" \"Carmen,\" Juni sighed, \"I know you might be older than me-\" \"I am older than you,\" Carmen interrupted. \"You are older than me,\" Juni corrected himself, \"but I don't want to see you get hurt. He's not what you think he is.\" \"Gary is exactly what I think he is,\" said Carmen, \"and I can take care of myself. Go find a girl to talk to or something, Juni, and leave me alone.\" Juni gave her a long look before shaking his head and walking off. Carmen sighed and went back to the waiting Gary Giggles. \"What did he want?\" Gary asked, leaning against a pillar. \"Oh, nothing,\" Carmen replied, brushing it off. \"When were you reinstated?\" \"A few months ago,\" said Gary. \"I haven't been on any serious assignments yet though.\" \"I see,\" said Carmen. \"Are you back at Junior OSS then?\" \"Yeah, but I haven't been in much so far,\" Gary answered. \"I'll be there more now the new term has started.\" \"I see,\" said Carmen again. There was an awkward moment of silence before Gary put his drink down and said, \"Would you like to dance?\" Carmen gave a brief smile and put down her glass, letting Gary lead her out onto the dance floor. They began to waltz in time to the band, Carmen's silver shoes shimmering in the half-light. Gary was a good dancer, and a good partner, never once making a mistake. His dad must have drilled it into him, Carmen realised. She caught sight of Juni watching them with a dark expression on his face and she looked away from him. It wasn't her eleven-year-old brother's place to tell her what she could and couldn't do. \"Are you alright?\" Gary asked. Carmen took a breath and smiled. \"Yes,\" she replied. The two of them continued to waltz in and out between the other couples on the floor. \"Hello, Juni,\" said Gerti, standing beside him with one hand on her hip. \"Gerti Giggles,\" said Juni. \"I don't want to talk to you.\" Gerti ignored that. \"Watching over your sister, are you?\" she asked, following the direction he was looking. \"Maybe,\" said Juni shortly. \"It's none of your business.\" \"Oh, but it is,\" said Gerti. \"Don't worry. My brother will be perfectly respectable.\" \"Huh, yeah right,\" Juni muttered. \"Oh he will,\" Gerti assured him. \"He will be the perfect gentleman. Now, is there lemon drizzle cake over there?\" And with that, she walked off. Juni frowned. He had never liked Gary Giggles. Despite what Gerti had said, he couldn't trust him at all.[Chapter 2] Chapter Two A/N: Hope this chapter lives up to the last. Thanks for reading :) Disclaimer: I do not own any of the SPYKids material. \"Carmen, what do you think of the new R.A.L.P.H?\" Juni asked the next morning, holding out his newest model of the R.A.L.P.H. Carmen lay on her bed, staring up at the ceiling. She was daydreaming... again. She sighed. \"Mmm, yeah, Juni,\" she said. \"What are you thinking about?\" Juni asked, a frown forming between his eyebrows. \"That's nice,\" Carmen replied absently. Juni went over and waved his hand over her face. \"Carmen! Listen to me!\" Carmen sat up. \"What is it?\" she asked. Juni narrowed his eyes. \"You aren't still mad at me about last night are you?\" he asked. \"No, not really,\" said Carmen. She turned her head to stare out of the window. Juni snapped his fingers. \"Carmen! You've been like this ever since last night. What's up?\" Carmen looked at him innocently. \"Nothing,\" she said. \"Come on, Carmen, I'm a spy,\" said Juni. \"I know when you're lying. This isn't about Gary Giggles, is it?\" He scowled when he said the name. Carmen rolled her eyes. \"Juni, I've already told you. I don't like him, okay?\" \"Right...\" said Juni, clearly not believing her. \"If you keep going on about this,\" Carmen snapped, \"then I'll tell Gerti you have a crush on her.\" \"What?\" Juni burst out. \"I so do not like Gerti Giggles. She's annoying!\" \"Right...\" said Carmen the same way Juni did. \"Well if you don't stop bugging me, I'll tell her anyway.\" \"Fine,\" Juni huffed and stomped out of the room. Carmen brushed a stray lock of hair out of her eyes and picked up the photo from her dresser. It was a photograph of Gary Giggles, his hair all blond and messy and his eyes blue, just having taken some spy-glasses off. Carmen had printed it off the night before. Now, she picked it up, stared at it for a moment, and then put it in the shredder. The shredder whirred as it destroyed the photo and Carmen turned her back on it. She couldn't afford to be thinking about Gary. Not when an important assignment could come up at any time. Carmen and Juni Cortez walked into Junior OSS the following Monday morning. They stuffed their bags into their lockers and retrieved their files. Juni hadn't said another word on the Gary matter, fearing the rumour Carmen had threatened to spread. He was about to walk off when someone approached them from behind. \"Hello, Carmen.\" It was Gary Giggles again, dressed in his Junior OSS uniform, the gel gone from his hair. \"Gary,\" Carmen acknowledged him. \"And Juni Cortez, of course,\" Gary added. \"Giggles,\" said Juni curtly. \"Did you get back on the Best Spy Kid board?\" Gary asked politely. \"I did,\" said Juni. \"Ah, good for you,\" Gary replied, giving a brief smile, an expression which Juni thought looked unnatural on his face. \"Don't you have stuff in your office to sort, Juni?\" Carmen asked pointedly. Juni gave her a look which said 'I told you so' and turned and walked down the hall. \"Sorry about my brother,\" Carmen apologised. \"Don't be,\" said Gary. \"We've never been the best of friends. I thought he was going to quit the spy business after the Ukata assignment.\" \"He changed his mind,\" Carmen replied simply. \"Clearly,\" Gary smiled. \"Have you had any missions of late?\" \"A few,\" said Carmen. \"Of course, you're not allowed to say,\" said Gary. \"Were they successful?\" \"Yeah,\" said Carmen. She paused. \"I expect you've seen your sister since you've come back here.\" \"Yes, I have,\" Gary replied. The two of them started to walk down the corridor. \"There she is.\" He pointed to a blonde girl by the lockers. She had two pigtails high on her head tied with colourful bobbles. \"Gerti!\" Carmen called. \"Hey, Carmen,\" Gerti said. \"I see you found out my brother's back.\" \"Yeah, I have,\" Carmen replied. \"Uh, you know, you two, how about we meet up at the juice bar later?\" Gary offered. Carmen hesitated. It was one thing seeing Gary at school but she wasn't sure her parents, especially her dad, would consent to her meeting up outside school hours. \"Um... I'm not really...\" \"Juni can come along too, if he wants,\" said Gary. \"I'll... ask my dad,\" Carmen said finally. \"Alright,\" said Gary, flashing another smile. \"It's been nice seeing you, Carmen, but I have work,\" said Gerti. \"I might see you later then.\" She flicked her pigtails as she turned away and headed down the corridor. \"Bye,\" Carmen replied, waving her off. \"I'm afraid I'll have to go too,\" said Gary. \"I have piles of stuff to get through, now that I'm back here.\" \"See you then,\" said Carmen. \"See you later, Miss Cortez,\" Gary replied as he was halfway down the corridor, his voice drifting back to her. Despite everything, Carmen smiled. \"What did he say?\" said the voice behind her. \"Juni! Stop that!\" Carmen jumped. \"I'm a spy, Carmen, a spy . Of course I won't stop,\" said Juni. \"So what was he on about?\" \"We're meeting him and Gerti at the juice bar after school,\" Carmen informed him. \"What?!\" Juni burst out. \"Dad will never let you in a million years. He hates the Giggles!\" \"I'll convince him,\" said Carmen. \"You don't have to come, you know.\" \"Oh, I'm coming alright,\" said Juni, \"to make sure he isn't up to anything.\" Carmen rolled her eyes. \"Fine,\" she sighed. \"Look, I have to go. Got work to do, you know. Bye, Juni.\" She strode off down the corridor biting her lip. She knew Juni was onto her. She knew that he would find out everything eventually – he was a Level 1 spy after all. But her threat about Gertie was enough to keep him in place for now. Carmen sighed. She knew that she should stick to that rule in the 'How to Be a Good Spy' book: Never make any connections to family or friends. It would only make things difficult in the long run. She simply couldn't like Gary, not that she did. Carmen wrestled with the matter all day, fearing the only answer. It was what scared her most.[Chapter 3] Chapter Three A/N: Hope this chapter isn't too bad - please read and review. I would love to hear any feedback :) Disclaimer: I don't own any SPYKids material - same disclaimer as last time. \"No, Carmen. No way!\" said Gregorio Cortez, throwing his hands up in the air. \"You are not seeing that boy. His father is a criminal!\" \"Please, daddy,\" said Carmen with a pleading tone. Gregorio gave her a long look. \"I don't see why you want to meet up with him anyway,\" he said finally. \"Mom said I could,\" Carmen told him. Gregorio looked away and took a deep breath. \"Fine,\" he snapped at last, \"but any funny business and you tell me, okay?\" \"Don't worry, dad,\" said Carmen. \"Juni's coming with me.\" \"Juni, make sure there's no funny business, alright?\" said Gregorio to his eleven year old son. \"I will, dad,\" Juni reassured him. The juice bar was open-plan, spacious and brightly coloured. Carmen walked in, seemingly confident, but with her heart fluttering in her chest. She took off her denim jacket to reveal a sparkly white top which matched her white Converse. She spotted the Giggles over at a booth in the corner and went over to them. \"Hi,\" she said. \"So you made it,\" said Gerti, coming round the corner. \"Go on, sit down.\" Carmen slid into the booth and Gertie came in after her. Juni was forced to sit next to Gary. \"Yeah, I managed to convince my dad,\" Carmen replied. \"Nice top,\" said Gary. \"I'm feeling maybe I should have worn my tux again.\" He wore board shorts and a shirt with the sleeves rolled up over a t-shirt. \"Oh this? It's nothing really,\" said Carmen, giving a small smile. Gary smiled back good-naturedly. Juni coughed pointedly. \"Shall we order now?\" he asked. \"Sure,\" said Gerti. \"What do you guys like?\" Soon after, they had their juices in tall glasses in front of them, drinking them through colourful straws. The juice bar was cool and fairly quiet and even Juni wasn't complaining. \"Hey!\" Juni suddenly burst out. \"Something touched my foot!\" \"Sorry,\" said Gerti, the face of innocence, \"that was an accident.\" \"Oh,\" said Juni, \"um... that's alright.\" Carmen narrowed her eyes and then smiled. She began to suspect something from Gerti Giggles. \"Is everyone on top of things at Junior OSS?\" she asked to break the awkward silence. \"Yeah,\" said Juni, looking down at his drink. \"Things are... pretty cool,\" Gerti replied with a mysterious look in her eyes. \"School's better than ever since I came back,\" Gary added with a grin. Gerti suddenly got up. \"I'm going to the restroom,\" she stated. \"I think I'll go too,\" said Carmen, getting up out of her seat. The two of them went to the restroom. \"What do you want?\" asked Gerti when she was by the sinks. Carmen gave her a knowing look and lent against the door. \"I think I know what you're up to, Gerti Giggles.\" \"Oh?\" said Gerti, \"What is it then?\" \"You know what I'm talking about, Gerti,\" said Carmen. \"I know exactly what's going on.\" Gerti stared at her for a moment. \"I-I don't know what you're talking about.\" \"You do,\" Carmen replied. \"You like my brother, don't you?\" Gerti stared at the floor then, scuffing the toe of her shoe on the ground. \"Maybe,\" she muttered, the heat rising to her cheeks. \"What was that?\" Carmen asked mockingly. \"I didn't quite hear.\" \"I said maybe,\" said Gertie a little louder. Carmen opened her mouth to speak again but Gerti interrupted. \"Yes, okay? Yes!\" Carmen laughed. \"Seriously? You'd go for my little brother?\" \"Yeah,\" said Gerti with a shrug. \"You like my brother though, don't you?\" Carmen didn't know what to say. \"Well... um...\" \"Admit it,\" said Gerti, \"you do.\" \"You're not going to let this go, are you?\" said Carmen. \"You do,\" Gerti smiled. Carmen gave her a hard look. \"Fine, maybe you're right,\" she admitted. It was then Gerti's turn to laugh. \"Oh, just look at us both!\" she exclaimed. \"Spies aren't supposed to be like this though,\" she said on a serious note. \"I think the more important thing is how we've been in the restroom for way too long,\" said Carmen. \"I wonder what our brothers have got up to.\" \"Let's go back,\" said Gerti and the two of them went back to the table. \"Gerti,\" said Juni, \"we've been summoned to Junior OSS. I think they have an assignment for us.\" He didn't sound too happy about it. \"I thought you always do assignments with Carmen,\" said Gerti tentatively. \"I think they need really small agents for this one,\" said Juni. \"They want us there now.\" \"We'd better get going then,\" said Gerti, flicking her pigtail over her shoulder. \"But Carmen-\" \"Go, Juni,\" Carmen interrupted, \"and good luck on the mission. Hopefully I'll be there to see you off.\" Reluctantly, Juni led the way out of the juice bar with Gerti in tow. Gerti turned back one last time with a smile on her face and Carmen gave her a big thumbs-up. Then Gerti turned and hurried after Juni. \"Looks like it's just us then,\" said Gary. \"I wonder what kind of assignment would need extra small agents.\" \"So do I,\" Carmen agreed. \"I hope they'll be okay. Juni's never been on an assignment without me.\" \"I'm sure they'll both be fine,\" said Gary. \"When do you suppose they'll be leaving?\" \"Today maybe,\" said Carmen, \"if they accept. Will you go to see Gerti off?\" \"Yeah,\" Gary replied, \"You?\" \"Of course,\" said Carmen. Gary smiled and sipped his juice. Carmen began to regret burning that photograph, but remembered she could easily print off another one. She thought about how much time she and Gary would have without Gerti and Juni since they were gone. Maybe she would get to know him better, though she felt she did know him fairly well: they'd throw insults around, she'd saved his and his sister's lives when they were on the edge on a cliff, she had punched him in the face and been there when his father had been about to take over the world. But there was so much of Gary that she didn't know about. How could she possibly know him properly when they were both spies? Carmen felt good for Gerti though. She had got however long the assignment would take with just her and Juni. At least things had worked out well for her. Carmen almost wished she was the one with the assignment. It had been a few months since the last one and she missed the suspense, the tension and the excitement. But she wondered - would she want an assignment with her brother... or with Gary this time?[Chapter 4] Chapter Four A/N: Here's the next chapter - sorry if it's a bit shorter than the others. Please read and review! Disclaimer: I don't own any SpyKids material, only my story line and any OCs I decide to add in later :) \"Carmen, come in, Carmen.\" Carmen fished a walkie-talkie out of her bag and held it to her ear. \"Yes?\" \"Are you reading me, Carmen?\" \"Loud and clear, Juni,\" Carmen replied. \"How did the meeting go?\" Carmen was walking down the road with Gary after their meet up in the juice bar. Juni and Gerti had been at Junior OSS for a meeting with her father who was the head. Gary looked over at Carmen. \"You carry a walkie-talkie in your bag?\" he asked her. \"It pays to be prepared,\" Carmen hissed. \"Now, shut up!\" \"Good,\" crackled Juni's voice over the walkie-talkie. \"Gerti and I are leaving today.\" \"Today?\" Carmen asked. \"What time?\" \"In an hour,\" said Juni. \"We're packing some stuff and then we're going.\" \"So the assignment is really important then?\" Carmen asked, a sly tone creeping into her voice. \"Carmen, you of all people know I can't say anything,\" said Juni disapprovingly. \"Look, can you meet me and Gerti in the docking bay at Junior OSS in about an hour? To see us off?\" \"Sure,\" said Carmen. \"We'll be there.\" \"We? So Giggles' coming too?\" Juni asked. \"He is Gertie's brother,\" Carmen replied. \"See you then. Over and out.\" \"Over and out,\" Juni repeated and his voice broke off. Carmen put away the walkie-talkie. She and Juni carried them with them since they both knew mobile calls could be traced. She and Gary kept walking. \"Juni wants us to meet him and Gertie at the docking bay in an hour.\" \"Alright,\" Gary replied. There was a moment's silence. \"So, the walkie-talkie-\" \"Ugh!\" Carmen exclaimed and stalked quickly ahead. She looked down at the gum-littered ground as she walked and bumped into a man with a grey jacket with some sort of logo. \"Sorry,\" she apologised but the man walked swiftly on. Gary came to her side and spotted a small piece of card lying overturned on the pavement. He picked it up and turned it over. It read: Watch your step. \"Huh, weird,\" said Gary. He tucked the card into his pocket for safekeeping. \"Are you okay?\" he asked Carmen. \"Yeah,\" said Carmen gruffly. \"Come on, we'd better get to school.\" \"This is a private area. Do you have clearance?\" The security guard stood with his arms folded at the door to the docking bay, his eyes narrowed at the tall blond boy and the dark-haired girl. \"Yes, we do,\" said Gary impatiently, in the middle of an argument with the man. He pulled out his Level-2 access card and waved it at the guard. \"Those can be forged, you know,\" said the guard sceptically. \"Well it's not!\" Gary exclaimed. \"Are you going to let us through or am I going to have to-\" \"Gary,\" Carmen interrupted, stepping in front of him. \"Excuse me, sir,\" she said graciously, holding up her Level-1 access card for him to see, \"My name is Carmen Elizabeth Juanita Costa-Brava Cortez, daughter of Gregorio Cortez, Head of the OSS. I have the correct clearance – my Level-1 card. Could you please let us through?\" \"What about him?\" the guard asked. \"He's with me. Now, open the door,\" said Carmen crisply, walking through the door once the security guard had stepped aside. \"I overwhelmed him with names and titles,\" Carmen explained in undertones to Gary. \"I know,\" Gary replied, that slightly cocky smirk returning to his face. \"Why didn't you try it then?\" Carmen asked, rolling her eyes at his arrogance. \"My dad tried to take over the world,\" Gary said. \"It wouldn't have worked.\" The two of them reached the docking bay where a small submarine awaited the younger spies. Juni and Gerti wore black stretch jumpsuits with a belt full of devices and were talking with Gregorio Cortez in the harbour. Carmen and Gary went to join them. \"Hey, Juni,\" said Carmen, ruffling his ginger curls. Juni absently swatted her hand away but gave her a hug. \"We're just about to leave,\" he said. \"I'm glad you made it. I won't be contacting you until we come back.\" \"I know that,\" said Carmen. \"Be safe, okay. And you can probably trust Gerti.\" \"Well,\" said Juni, stepping away, \"I guess this is goodbye.\" He went to the edge of the dock and put on foot on the sub to steady it. \"Coming, Gerti?\" Gerti's farewell with her brother was much more severe. They shook hands and exchanged a few serious words before Gerti stepped out to join Juni. \"Ready,\" she said. Juni held the sub steady and offered Gerti his hand. She took it and hopped in and Juni jumped in after her. The two of them got into their seats and closed the windscreen. \"Stay safe!\" Gregorio yelled over the whirr of the engine as it started up. Juni flashed a grin in response before they were submerged in the water and drove off. A/N: Also, for when Juni and Gerti are away, is there a specific place you want Gary and Carmen to go? And should I skip to where Juni and Gerti are? Please say if you review. :)[Chapter 5] Chapter Five Carmen Cortez woke the following week longing for an assignment. It had been about a month or two since her last one, and she had that desperate feeling to be back in the game. But she wouldn't ask for one. She knew anything could go wrong with Juni's case, and if it did, she wanted to be the first agent they would ask to step in. Carmen didn't like to admit it, but she was worried. It was only when her phone lit up with a text that her mood brightened. It read: Going to the mall - want to come? G. Carmen frowned but she was smiling. How had Gary managed to get her number? If it was Gary at least. She replied. How did you get my number, Gary? Carmen shook her head and pulled on her robe, heading into the kitchen-diner. She grabbed a cookie from the tin and sat at the counter. It wasn't long before her phone buzzed again. In the juice bar, when you were in the restroom you left your phone on the table. It wasn't too hard. Carmen rolled her eyes. Trust Gary to be like that. He could have just asked for her number. She went to reach for a second cookie when her mom swiped the tin away. \"Eat something healthy for breakfast, honey,\" she said, but then took a cookie for herself. \"Mom!\" Carmen protested, but poured herself some muesli, grumbling all the way. She then got out her phone again and texted Gary back. Going to the mall? Sure, meet you at the pizza place. What time? Carmen spooned muesli into her mouth whilst watching her mom eat the cookies. \"Who are you texting, honey?\" Mrs Cortez asked. Carmen hesitated. \"Just a friend,\" she shrugged. Mrs Cortez gave her a look but decided not to ask. Instead, she said, \"Doing anything nice today?\" \"Maybe,\" Carmen replied. \"I might head out to the mall for a bit.\" \"I could come with you,\" Mrs Cortez offered. \"I'm meeting some friends,\" Carmen added quickly. \"Oh,\" said Mrs Cortez knowingly. \"You don't want your old mom showing you up. I understand.\" \"Uh... yeah, that's right,\" said Carmen. She looked down at her phone as she got another text. Pizza place at 10 ok? \"I'm gonna go get dressed,\" said Carmen, going back to her bedroom. She texted Gary back. Sure, meet you there. Then, Carmen had the difficult job of choosing what to wear. In the end, she decided on blue jeans, a red and white t-shirt, red Converse, and a white denim jacket. Then she ran out of the house to catch the bus. Sitting on the bus, Carmen checked her OSS outstanding work. She had mostly completed everything that needed doing, and she was happy about that. Now, she could enjoy her weekend. Carmen walked into the mall and headed over to the pizza place in the middle. \"I need that status report, Mr Cortez.\" Juni slid onto his chair and rolled over to the computer. He put on the headpiece and adjusted the speaker. \"We are on course for the assignment, Sir,\" he said. \"Both well, with plenty of supplies, and been underwater for eight days.\" Gerti joined him, and leant close to speak into the mouthpiece. \"Oxygen supplies are still high, Sir,\" she said. \"Do you have to do that?\" Juni hissed, forgetting to cover the speaker. Gerti pointed to it, raising her eyebrows. \"I'm sorry, Mr Cortez?\" \"Sorry, Sir,\" said Juni. \"Travelling at very high speeds, Sir, and estimated to arrive at our destination in approximately four days.\" \"Good, we will contact you for another status report before you arrive. Over and out.\" \"Over and out, Sir.\" Juni put the headpiece down and turned to face Gerti. Being stuck on the same submarine as her for eight days had taken its toll, but Juni didn't know what to think about Gerti Giggles anymore. Sure, she was annoying, but Juni had to admit that she was, well, kind of pretty. And she had proved she was a Level-2 spy. In fact, Juni might even consider her as almost a Level-1. \"What?\" said Gerti as she caught him staring at her. \"Nothing,\" Juni scowled. He stood up. \"I'm going to get something to eat.\" Gerti watched as he left the cabin. Back before the Ukata assignment, she had thought him to be an annoying little boy, who wasn't worth her time. Now, Gerti saw him differently. She was glad to be paired with him on this assignment. She sat on the swivel chair and slid over to the computer. The front windscreen of the submarine was blacked out, but they wouldn't be able to see anything anyway. The sub was moving at ridiculously high speeds in secret tunnels under the ocean. There had been a period of time that they had spent in tunnels underground, going under Africa. Now, they were out in the sea again, in the Indian Ocean, heading eastwards. Gerti took out her pigtails, and experimented with a high ponytail instead. She wondered what Carmen was doing – hanging out with her brother most probably. Gerti didn't understand how anyone could like her brother like that. It just made her cringe. But Carmen was her friend, and she could reason that Gerti was doing just the same. There she went – thinking about Juni again. His red hair was just so curly though... Gerti scolded herself. Ugh. She really needed to do something, anything, to stop her from thinking those stupid thoughts. \"Hey there, Miss Cortez,\" said the voice from behind her. Carmen spun around to see Gary, his hair all blond, and- \"Hi, Gary,\" said Carmen, before she could start thinking weird thoughts about him. \"Did you want to get pizza first?\" Gary asked. \"Um, we could get one later?\" Carmen suggested. The two walked along side by side, a silence hanging in the air until Carmen said, \"I wonder how Juni and Gerti are getting along on their assignment.\" \"They'll be fine,\" said Gary. \"They have been gone for over a week,\" Carmen pointed out. \"We were gone quite a long time on the Ukata assignment,\" Gary shrugged. \"I'm sure they're doing great.\" \"If you say so,\" Carmen sighed. \"Are you worried about him?\" Gary asked with a puzzled expression, \"Juni, I mean.\" \"A bit,\" Carmen admitted. \"I'm sure he'll be fine though.\" \"You need to relax, Carmen,\" said Gary. \"Maybe we'll get that pizza now instead.\" \"Sure,\" said Carmen. But inside, she wasn't so sure if Juni would be okay. A/N: Ah, I'm so sorry to anyone who is following this story. I have been really busy lately (especially with other fanfics) and I realised that I haven't updated Reinstated since April. Yikes, sorry guys. Anyway, here's the next chapter - pretty rushed since I wanted to get it up before August ends... Please review! Thanks, Ginger xx[Chapter 6] Chapter Six It was days later that the computer politely informed Juni that they were only an hour away from their destination. \"Morning,\" said Gerti, yawning as she walked into the control room. \"Morning,\" Juni echoed, though a little more shortly than Gerti. \"Fifty-nine minutes 'til landing,\" Gerti said, reading over Juni's shoulder. \"You can't land a sub, Gerti,\" said Juni. \"We're under the water.\" Gerti flushed slightly. \"I was only reading what it says,\" she replied hotly. \"Whatever,\" Juni said with a sigh as Gerti stomped off. Juni went into the hallway of the submarine and pressed a button on the wall. Part of the wall slid aside to reveal a set of clothes and belongings he would need. \"Josh James,\" he read off, trying out his new name for the mission. It wasn't too bad; he'd had worse. Juni got dressed in black skinny jeans, red Converse hi-tops, and a white t-shirt, ready to hit the road as Josh. He wasn't done yet though. As instructed before he left, Juni seized a pair of straighteners and attempted to straighten his wild ginger curls into a neat mop-head for his character. \"You don't do it like that,\" said Gerti in exasperation. She had been leaning against the wall with her arms folded for a few minutes as she watched Juni struggle with the straighteners. \"Well how do you do it, then?\" Juni snapped. Gerti walked over and held out her hand. Juni put the straighteners in her hand, and Gerti got to work. After a few minutes, Juni's ginger hair was straight, in a messy fringe. \"There you go,\" said Gerti with a satisfactory look on her face. \"Thanks,\" Juni muttered. \"Sorry, I didn't quite hear that,\" Gerti said pointedly. \"Thanks,\" Juni said louder. \"You'd better get changed; we're nearly there.\" Gerti opened her compartment and took the clothes to her cabin to get changed. When she emerged, she was wearing a black and white spotty cropped top, a black skater skirt, a short black jacket and black crotched pumps. She had a braid going around her head with the rest of her blonde hair left down, and though Juni was no makeup expert, he was sure she was wearing some. \"Well?\" said Gerti expectantly. \"How does Lily Derives look?\" Juni swallowed before responding. He was about to say um, great, but instead, what came out was, \"High-maintenance.\" Gerti scowled at him. \"Well, at least she looks like she spent some time picking out her clothes.\" \"Josh James looks pretty awesome, actually,\" Juni shot back. \"Ugh, I can't work like this!\" Gerti burst out. Seeing how stressed she looked, Juni sighed and held out his hand in a peace-making gesture. \"No more arguing?\" he suggested. Gerti nodded. \"No more arguing,\" she agreed. They shook hands and Gerti added, \"Well, not unless it's really important.\" Juni rolled his eyes and grabbed the sunglasses from his compartment. \"I'm just gonna check how long we've got left,\" he said, excusing himself to the control room. Gerti sighed. At least she and Juni had agreed to stop arguing. It had been like that for a while that they had been travelling: either shouting at each other or ignoring each other completely. Perhaps things would look up from there. A short while later, the sub went into a tunnel on the side of an underwater building. The building was basically a submarine underneath, but looked like it was just a normal building above water. The two kids picked up a few suitcases before stepping into the building, which apparently was an airport. \"Ready to go?\" said Juni. \"Yeah,\" Gerti replied, shifting her bag up her arm. \"So, here we are – Hainan.\" They had arrived on the small island in China – Hainan – which was a major beach tourist destination. They both knew the drill – and the story. Josh James and Lily Derives were step-siblings, on holiday in Hainan whilst their parents were on their honeymoon after getting married. They were 'staying' with Lily's Gran in her suite in a fancy hotel during their stay. \"Let's find a taxi somewhere,\" said Juni. \"Sure,\" said Gerti. \"I'll give the driver directions.\" They made it to the hotel and up into the suite. Luckily for them, Lily's Gran was non-existent, and they had the suite to themselves. \"Not bad,\" said Juni appreciatively, looking around the suite in admiration. \"We're not here to lounge around,\" said Gerti. \"You'd better report back now, right?\" \"Oh yeah,\" said Juni, getting out his computer and putting the earpiece. \"Can you hear me, Sir?\" \"Agent Cortez,\" said the voice on the other end, \"I trust you are in the suite?\" \"We are, Sir,\" Juni replied. \"We'll be ready to report for duty in the morning.\" \"Just follow what I told you before you left. Send another status report tomorrow night.\" \"Yes, Sir,\" said Juni, \"Over and out.\" \"Over and out.\" Juni closed the laptop and flopped onto the sofa. It was nice to be on dry land again. Gerti came over and handed him a packet of crisps. \"I'll be in my room,\" she said, starting to walk off. \"Wait, Gerti,\" said Juni, sitting up to face her. \"Yeah?\" \"Uh, nothing,\" said Juni. \"I mean thanks.\" \"No problem,\" said Gerti, walking to her room and closing the door. A/N: OK, before I start apologising, I just have to say thank you so much to everyone who has favourited/followed this story - it really means a lot. Now for the apologies: 1. Sorry that I haven't updated this story for a while but I've been really lost for inspiration on this one. (I previously wrote THREE MONTHS! but figured I had read the last update wrong :P) 2. Sorry that this chapter is way shorter than it should be - I only had 885 words when it should've been at least 1K. 3. And thirdly, sorry there's no Carmen or Gary in this chapter but I really don't know what to do with them for the time being. I know where my plot is headed, so they might be in the next chapter :) Thanks once again, to everyone out there who has reviewed/favourited/followed/read this, and I hope I'll update soon! 4. One last sorry: sorry this author's note is WAY too long :/ Thanks again, Ginger xx[Chapter 7] Chapter Seven A/N: Thanks again for the reviews and sorry I don't update this as much as I should - I'm really busy! Enjoy, Ginger xx Dear Gary, I can't actually send this letter, but why would I anyway? It would be much easier just to call. If you do ever get this, burn it. The truth is, Juni and I, our task is an assignment like your never believe. I can't say any details, in case this is found, but it's bigger than we'd ever imagined. Sometimes I wonder if even we're good enough. Juni needs me to straighten his hair now, as his disguise, but after that we're heading off to the biggest part of the assignment yet, and the most dangerous. Even we don't know what we're in for. I hope this gets to you, bro, if we... don't make it back. Gerti finished straightening Juni's red hair, since he was so determined he couldn't do it himself, and stood up. The hardest part of their assignment was just around the corner. The whole thing was top secret, but they had discovered an underground maze which contained a sacred and really expensive object. OSS had refused to tell even the two agents what that object was. All they knew was that it was held in a safe somewhere in the maze, in a black box. And they had to find it. The only problem was that they didn't know how far the maze went, but they did know that it was rigged with countless booby-traps. OSS, monitoring their progress from back in the US, had identified some, but there were likely to be numerous others, some of which might be deadly. \"You're done,\" said Gerti, stepping away and sitting down to pull on a pair of black heeled boots that matched her two-tone black and white dress. Even though they were going underground, they still had to get to the entrance of the maze, and OSS had told them it was right in the middle of a shopping centre. \"Thanks,\" Juni replied, running a hand through his straight fringe and also getting up. \"Are you ready?\" he asked, looking her in the eye. Gerti swallowed, looking away. She shrugged on a jacket, reluctant to meet his gaze. The truth was, Gerti had never done an assignment on this scale before. It made her nervous, that she might not even make it out alive. \"Yeah,\" she lied. \"We should get going.\" \"Gerti-\" Gerti looked at him, trying to give him a meaningful look, which should have said \"Don't talk about it\" but instead his chocolate-brown eyes melted all of her will to pretend. Gerti sighed. \"Juni, I've never done anything like this before,\" she admitted. Juni raised an eyebrow. \"That's what's getting you nervous?\" \"Yeah, aren't you?\" Gerti stared at her shoes. \"A bit,\" said Juni. \"I guess this is probably my biggest assignment so far, but it's got to be done, right?\" \"Right,\" said Gerti. \"Let's go.\" The entrance to the maze was in an unused lift. OSS still hadn't identified the owner of this maze, making Gerti and Juni a little suspicious of everyone in the shopping centre. They hacked the lift controls and went down into the maze. \"Looks like this is it,\" Juni whispered, taking a few steps out of the lift. \"Yeah,\" said Gerti, following him out. The lift doors slammed shut behind them. \"We'll find another way out,\" Juni stated. \"I know,\" said Gerti. The lift lights went out, plunging them into darkness. Gerti jumped at the sudden ping of the lights going out, immediately fumbling for a torch. She felt Juni's hand grasp hers, and for once instead of feelings those instant butterflies, she just felt glad, and comforted. Juni brought out a torch just as she did, and they both switched them on. In front of them was a narrow tunnel stretching out further than their torchlight let them see. Not letting go of her hand, Juni moved forward with a light tread. Gerti, shining her torch forward, had no choice but to follow him and complete the assignment. \"Gerti,\" said Juni softly, after a few minutes of following the tunnel. \"Yes?\" Gerti whispered. \"Was there a map?\" Juni asked, turning to look at her in the darkness. Gerti's breath caught in her throat, not only because she could just see the gleam of the torchlight in his eyes. \"A map?\" she repeated. \"Yeah, didn't they give us one?\" Juni asked. Gerti's eyes widened. \"No,\" she said, \"They never did.\" \"So your brother's still away on an assignment, right?\" Frankie Storm asked, walking along beside Carmen Cortez. \"Yeah, he's still away,\" Carmen replied. \"Done anything fun while he's been gone?\" Frankie asked with a grin. \"Not really...\" said Carmen. Frankie sighed, flicking her straight chestnut-brown hair over her shoulder. \"We should do something,\" she said, taking a moment to think about it. \"What about a sleepover? You can come over mine.\" \"Maybe,\" said Carmen, a bit unsure. She had known Frankie for a year or two now, and she'd love to go round hers, but there was also that important class project that needed finishing... \"Carmen-\" Frankie began, but cut herself off when a dark-haired boy came over. \"Hey, girls,\" he said. \"A friend of mine's having this house party on the weekend. Wanna come?\" \"And are you going, James?\" Frankie asked, tossing her sleek hair over her shoulder again. James grinned. \"Sure am, Frankie,\" he said. \"Well I want to come,\" said Frankie, throwing James a slightly flirtatious look. \"How about it, Carmen?\" \"I don't know,\" said Carmen. \"My parents-\" \"Totally won't mind,\" Frankie finished for her. \"You're coming round mine for \"a sleepover\" anyway, right?\" \"Sure,\" Carmen sighed. Frankie was the most stubborn person she knew. \"Cool,\" said James. \"Oh, and Frankie? It'd be great if you came with me.\" Frankie smiled. \"Of course,\" she said. \"I'll see you later.\" James walked off then, leaving the two girls by the lockers. \"Don't worry, Carmen, I'll find you a guy to go with before the weekend,\" said Frankie. \"I'm only fourteen, Frankie,\" said Carmen, laughing. Frankie just shrugged. \"Whatever,\" she said. \"I'll find you someone anyway.\" None of the guys Frankie had picked out were any good. Two of them weren't even going to the party, one of them already had a girl, and the other two were complete jerks. Carmen sighed. Before Frankie could go and find any more guys from Junior OSS, Carmen stopped her in her tracks. Fed up with this, she accidentally blurted out something she knew she'd regret. \"I already have a guy, Frankie!\" \"What?\" said Frankie. \"Well why didn't you say?\" \"I don't know if you'd like him,\" said Carmen quickly. \"What's he like? Tall and dangerous?\" Frankie asked, grinning. \"You could say that,\" said Carmen. \"Well invite him along,\" said Frankie. \"I'm dying to meet him. Who is he again?\" \"You'll see,\" said Carmen, and she actually managed a mysterious smile. \"Why would you do that, Carmen?!\" Carmen said to herself, flopping down on her bed later that day. \"You're such an idiot! Where am I going to find a guy like that in the next few days?\" Then it dawned on her. But she didn't like that idea at all. Ring, ring, ring. Carmen sighed as she listened to the dial tone. She was really regretting this idea. \"Hello?\" \"Hi, um, it's Carmen,\" said Carmen. \"Yeah, I know. I have you in my contacts, remember?\" \"Look, I've got myself into a bit of a mess,\" said Carmen. \"Um, well, I kind of told my friend that I have a boyfriend that I'm bringing to this party on the weekend.\" There was silence except from the other person breathing. \"Anyway,\" Carmen continued, \"I was wondering if you'd do me a favour?\" \"And pretend to be your boyfriend?\" \"Yeah,\" said Carmen. \"Could you do that?\" There was a pause. \"Sure, I don't mind. Anything for a good party.\" \"Thanks, that's a lifesaver, Gary.\" \"No problem.\" They kept walking until they reached a crossroads with three different pathways. \"What now?\" Gerti asked, but she knew Juni didn't know the answer. Juni remained silent, thinking it over. \"We don't want to get lost in here,\" he stated. \"What's the time?\" Gerti checked her watched. \"Eleven AM,\" she said. \"Actually, it's not. My watch has stopped.\" \"I thought it was later than that,\" Juni muttered. He let go of Gerti's hand to open his bag and retrieve a walkie-talkie. \"Command? Come in, command. We need your help. Command, can you hear me? We need your help. There's no map. We're lost in the maze. Command...\" \"Juni,\" said Gerti, taking the walkie-talkie from him, \"They're not there. For some reason we're on our own on this one. I say we keep walking, try the middle road.\" Juni nodded. \"We should,\" he agreed, \"But we don't want to get lost.\" Gerti produced a stick of white chalk from her bag. \"Always pays to be prepared,\" she said. \"I'll draw along the walls so we can find our way back.\" \"Like Hansel and Gretel,\" said Juni. \"Let's go then.\" This time, Gerti drew up the courage to grab Juni's hand. \"I don't want to get lost in the dark,\" she said, and to her surprise, Juni smiled at her.[Chapter 8] Chapter Eight: A Startling Revelation Juni and Gerti finally collapsed on the ground, exhausted. They had gone so far into the maze, endured so many traps, and now they leant against the wall, hungry, tired and very thirsty. Gerti leant her head on Juni's shoulder, focusing on her breathing. \"How long?\" she whispered. \"I don't know,\" Juni replied. \"It's been a good few hours... I think.\" Gerti listened to the sound of him uncapping his water bottle and sighed. She'd finished hers long ago. \"Do you think we'll ever find it?\" \"Gerti,\" said Juni, passing her the bottle, \"I don't think there is anything.\" \"But Juni-\" \"Drink,\" Juni said gently. \"Gerti, I think this was all a set up.\" \"How can you say that?\" Gerti asked, taking slow sips of water. \"Your father gave us the assignment.\" \"I know,\" said Juni, \"and I think that part was real. But I reckon someone has infiltrated OSS and hacked into the assignment. Nothing about this maze was real.\" Gerti was silent. \"We have to get out of here, Juni,\" she whispered. Juni grabbed her hand and gripped it tight. \"We will,\" he said. \"There's got to be another way out. We've just got to find it before we run out of rations.\" \"Juni,\" Gerti bit her lip, \"What if we don't make it out of here?\" Juni swallowed, but met her gaze. \"We will, okay? We will.\" \"You wanted to see us, dad?\" Carmen asked. \"Yes.\" Gregorio turned to face them. \"Convenient that the two of you were together, wasn't it?\" Carmen flushed pink, glancing at Gary who was beside her. \"Aren't you supposed to be at work, dad?\" \"That's part of the reason you're here,\" said Gregorio. \"Someone has taken over OSS.\" \"What?\" the other two burst out. \"Just let me explain,\" said Gregorio tiredly. Carmen and Gary fell silent. \"The whole organisation is in complete chaos,\" Gregorio continued. \"No-one can get into the building because all access cards have been deactivated. The building itself is impenetrable.\" \"Well that was smart thinking,\" Carmen said sarcastically. \"Carmen,\" Gregorio said warningly. \"Sorry, dad,\" Carmen apologised. \"So someone must've deactivated the access cards.\" \"They're probably in there right now,\" said Gary. \"But you've got plenty of spies, sir. Why not just find another way in.\" \"That's not all, Giggles,\" said Gregorio. \"The invader left a message.\" He pulled up an image on his computer. OSS and the Spy-Kids project are mine. \"Juni and Gerti,\" Carmen breathed. \"I know.\" Gregorio sat down in his chair. \"We're sending in reinforcements to track them down and bring them home. It would make sense for the OSS invader to have rigged their assignment.\" \"Who are you sending in?\" Carmen demanded. Gregorio looked at them both. \"You.\" A/N: Sorry that this is a very short filler chapter :/ I'm busy writing the next chapter which will hopefully be really long, probably will upload it sometime later this weekend :) Thanks for all your support, Ginger xx ","Summary":" Chapter One A/N: Sorry if any information in this is wrong.

I hear shouting in the front yard and I look out the window. It was Steve and Chavez again. They never stop going at each other's throats. I see Dick ride his horse right in between them and say to knock it off but they don't. They just keep going at it. I walk out there, with my hands on my hips, looking very disappointed. That usually works. I walk up to them and yell, \"Hey! What are you two doing? You guys have been acting like children. Next time I see ya'll doing this again and have to come out here, I am putting you boys into a time out. If you act like kids then I'm going to treat you like kids until you two get along.\" They both look down, looking ashamed. I look up and see John coming back. I hear Dick say to them, \"John's back. Go get in your supper clothes. Now! BOTH YA!\" They glare at him but they do as told. Dick turns to me and says, \"How do you do it, Jess? They always listen to you.\" He is the only one who calls me Jess. \"Well because they know I am the one who cooks their dinner.\" I respond, cheekily. John, Doc, and someone else passes us. Steve shoves Chavez but I glare at him. Steve mumbles a \"sorry\" and continues. Doc jumps off the carriage and walks over to us. Dick greets him, \"Glad your back, Doc. Stile hold the rope, inside.\" \"John bring another hard case in?\" Charlie asks. \"Hope it ain't another Mexican.\" Steve comments. I hit him. \"Mexican-Indian, you son of a bitch.\" Chavez shoots back. I hit him too. Charlie just starts laughing a bit. Now we all go back to work. I head back into the house to finish that chocolate cake. Just as I was entering the house I saw Chavez and Charlie giving the new guy, Billy a hard time. Time went by fast, because now we are all sitting at the table, eating dinner. I put the chocolate cake in the middle of the table and the boys dug right into it. Everybody telling me that dinner and the cake was great. I just smiled back at them and said thanks. \"Well now, look at those appetites. William? Have some more.\" John said. He took some more beans and Dick asked, \"You ever worked beef before, Billy?\" \"Yeah. Worked a little out towards Fort Sumter's way. At Pete Maxwell's place. And uh, got a way with cattle too.\" Billy. Steve started to laugh. John didn't like that so he said, \"Jolly funny, master Steven. That's no proper table manners.\" Charlie leans over to him and says, \"And a way with hogs.\" They start laughing uncontrollably. John had enough and said, \"Congratulations, Charles. You and Steven will be doing the dirty crockery alone, this evening.\" Charlie was still giggling but said, \"Sorry, John. Struck me funny.\" \"And to William. Both of you.\" John ordered. They both apologized and Dick asked Billy if he killed and man and what he killed him for. Billy just stared at Charlie and Steve and said, \"He was hacking me.\" Charlie looked scared and Steve made a gulping noise. I couldn't contain my laughter. I saw Chavez have a little smile on his face but it was unnoticed by the others. John stared at me and said, \"Jessie, you wouldn't mind fetching the chicken eggs for me, after supper, would you?\" I look out the window behind me, turn around, and immediately say, \"No John. Sorry, I couldn't help it.\" He knows how afraid I am of the dark. You never know what is hiding in it and never know what will be thrown at you. He gives me a nod and says, \"That's what I thought.\" After supper is finished we go into the living room and Steve is reading from the newspaper. \"There are plenty of men who will never secede...\" \"Succeed.\" John corrected. \"Succ… who will never succeed anywhere.\" He finished. \"We got a whole room full of them right here.\" Dick said. Everyone couldn't help but smile. \"Well done. William.\" John says. \"Yeah, sure.\" Billy laughs. \"Well, excuse me Billy. Very sorry to offend you. If conjugated to read and write, you'll need more skill with a firearm to succeed in a new world, Billy. So take up the journal, and start off where the other boy left off, or you can go straight back to your home in the streets.\" John snapped. Billy takes the newspaper and starts to read. \"Young men, who don't know how to do any kind business, have no energy or application, had better stay home near their relatives so they can be taken care of. They are not wanted here and will only come to grief. But men of other prize are practically sure of success.\" He is done and folds up the paper. \"Splendid. Splendid reading, William.\" John comments. \"Jessie. Will you please read for us now?\" I look up, wide eyed. Everyone is staring at me. John never lets me read since I already know how to and I don't need practice. He only lets me do it on very rare occasions. I smile none the less and start to read. \"Young men, who need work, a home, a farm, or family, could easily be found if they cooperate correctly. If they want a good job then they will need to make themselves worthy and known. If young men cannot do any of these requests, then they should stay where they are.\" I finish and I see all the boys smiling at me, knowing I loved reading. They know that just lit up my whole night. John smiles as he gets up and says, \"Brilliant. Truly brilliant, Jessie. Goodnight everyone.\" As he leaves, we all say goodnight back. I am still sitting on the stairs and nobody moves or gets up. I just continue to read the paper in my head. I don't realize someone's calling my name until somebody shakes my shoulder. I look up and see Chavez right in front of me. \"Can I help you, sir?\" I tease. \"You did well tonight. Never lose your touch, ok Jessie?\" he pleads. I nod and he gives me a smile. \"We're heading off to bed. We'll see you in the morning.\" As all the boys are heading out they all say goodnight to me and give me a hug. I climb up the stairs and into my room. I hop into bed and close my eyes. Before I fell into a dreamless sleep, I thought, \"My life is perfect. It can't get any better than this.\"[Chapter 2] I was in the kitchen cooking dinner when I heard a group of men coming. I looked out the window and saw Murphy and his boys with Sheriff Brady. I grabbed my gun and climbed up on the roof, where nobody could see me. The group of men stopped where John, Dick, Charlie, Steve, Chavez, and Doc stood. \"Good afternoon, gentlemen.\" John greeted. \"Afternoon, John.\" Brady greeted back. Brady was talking about Murphy complaining that John was on his property again. Just like he always does, just to get rid of John. Of course John was telling the truth when he said he didn't touch his property. That's when Murphy stepped in. \"Well, the beltin earl has spoken. Look behind you earl. All I see is hired thieves. Where is that girl of yours, John? Pleasing these boys is probably the only thing she's good at.\" All his men laughed at that. I just gasped. That was absolutely horrible. My boys didn't think it was funny because they all pulled out their weapons and Dick yelled, \"You will not speak ill of her!\" \"Richard! Lower your weapons boys.\" John ordered. They did so but hesitantly. Murphy pulled John back and started talking about his store and money. I looked at my group of boys and saw them all ready to pull their weapons out again. They were all breathing heavy also. I guess that insult really affected them too. Soon I heard Murphy yell to John, \"Your better off selling lady's undergarments in Amsterdam.\" As I predicted, the boys pulled out their weapons and scared the horses. I pulled out my gun and pointed it at Murphy's head, ready to fire. I saw the men start to leave but I kept my aim at Murphy. I stood on the roof on my knees to get a better shot. I was ready to fire when I heard someone call, \"Jessie.\" I ignored them and cocked the gun. \"Jessie!\" My finger was tightening on the trigger. Right when I was about to pull the trigger I heard, \"Jessie! Don't!\" I dropped my gun knowing I couldn't. I realized the first two times was John and the last one was Doc. I looked down at the boys and saw all of them staring at me. I just sighed and tossed my gun down to Chavez knowing he would catch it. And he did. I climbed down and stood in front of the group of boys I called my family. I still had tears in my eyes but I couldn't show them. I know everyone would think I'm weak. I just kept my head down. \"How did you even get up there, Jessie?\" Steve asked me. \"There's a ladder in the back.\" I answered in a small voice. I knew that if I talked louder my voice would break and I would just cry. Doc walked forward to me and wrapped his arms around me. I grabbed the front of his jacket and started choking back sobs. Even if I did feel safe and secure in his arms, it wouldn't make the pain go away. Doc started rubbing circles on my back to comfort me and said, \"It's alright now, Jessie. They're gone. We all know none of that is true. We love you for who you are.\" That did it. I broke down and started balling my eyes out. \"I have been called a lot of things in my life but nothing like that. I have never been so insulted in my entire life!\" I just stood there crying in Doc's arms while everyone was telling me good things. Once I calmed down and I just had hiccups, it was silent. John finally said, \"Jessie, don't worry. Just go lie down and relax or take a calm ride along the river, alright? I'll take care of dinner tonight.\" I nodded and responded, \"Thanks John. I'm going to go saddle up Rain.\" I walked into the stable and went into my horse's stall. I grabbed all my saddle gear and went into her stall again. \"Mind if I join you?\" I jumped and looked over to the entrance of the stables and sighed of relief when I saw Doc. I just nodded and he went over to his horse. Soon we were both all saddled up and ready to go. I want to ride and forget what happened. I yell, \"HEE YAW!\" and I hear a YAH right after. I hear the hooves pounding and the wind blowing. We just keep galloping and smiling at each other. If only he knew how I felt about him. We finally stop at the river and I get off. I go to the edge and put my feet in there. I see Doc do the same thing. We both breathe in the air and savor this moment. Best time to tell him is now ain't it? \"Hey, Doc? I gotta tell ya something.\" I say. \"Sure, Jessie. I'm all ears.\" He responds. I'm about to speak but then we hear another set of hooves. We both jump out of the water and go to our saddle to grab our guns. The only thing that we see is Dick coming over to us saying, \"Hey, you two. John's got supper ready. It's time to head back.\" \"Alright, we'll see ya at home, Dick.\" I say. I turn back to Doc but he says, \"How about you tell me later, when we're alone.\" I just nod. We head back and get into our supper clothes. We all begin eating and I can't help but see Billy staring at me. I finally had enough. \"What?!\" I yell at him. \"Nothin. Sorry, I was just seein how you were doin.\" He admits. \"It's alright, but you could ask instead of stare.\" I tell him. We continue eating without anybody talking. John decides to break the silence. \"Jessie. I'm going to have to take you and Billy into town with me tomorrow.\" \"What? Why?\" I question. \"Well, you do want to look like a nice and proper young lady for the New Year's party, now don't you?\" John responded with a smile. \"I guess but I don't want to overdo it. You know how much I hate dressing like a girl, John.\" I told him. The next day, John took us both to the shops and I find a dress that I actually like. It's like a deep blue color that comes with a white lace around the neck. I ask John if I could get it and he said of course since this is probably the only dress I will ever want to wear. I am still wearing the dress when we head back and my regular clothes are in a bag. I see the rest of the Regulators goofing off in the yard. They all stop when they see us coming and stand in a line in a respectable manor. Just as we were stopping, I see Chavez come up to me and help me off the carriage. He says, \"You look beautiful, Chiquita. A lot of boys will want to dance with you tonight.\" \"Well then a lot of boys will be very disappointed when I say no.\" I joke. Chavez was practicing his target knives on a bucket of water. He throws them on target and we are all very impressed. All of a sudden gunshots are heard and hit the bucket of water. \"Get down!\" Doc orders. We do as he says and Charlie practically threw me behind the fence and he jumps over, getting his legs twisted and can't get up. I can't either because of this stupid dress. Next we hear laughing and we look up. There is Billy sitting on the roof laughing at how he scared us. Everyone starts to get up but I can't. Charlie realizes this and helps me up. \"Sorry, I didn't mean to throw ya.\" \"It's alright. At least you protected me.\" I say as we both laugh. \"REGUALTORS!\" John screams, running out of the house and Billy's laughing dies down. We stare at him in confusion. The he smiles and says, \"Let's dance.\" We all start to saddle up but then John says, \"Jessie, what are you doing? A young lady should ride in a carriage, not on a horse. Especially when she is wearing a dress.\" \"Oh, come on John. Please. I'll use a side saddle.\" I suggest but he gives me a look and I get into the carriage. We arrive there and everyone is having fun. I wander off on my own and see some of the boys are dancing with some girls. I was looking at them while I was walking but I ran into someone. I look up and see a Murphy guy. He gives me a little smirk and says, \"Well, somebody should pay attention to where she's going. Here let me show ya around.\" He grabs my wrist, tightly, making me unable to move. \"No!\" I yell as I try to get away from him. His grip on my wrist gets tighter and I flinch. \"Ow! Stop that hurts.\" Next thing I know is that I'm on the ground and I see Charlie beating on the guy. Someone is trying to help me up and when I look up, I see Steve. He helps me up and he puts his arm around me to let me know I'm safe now as we watch Charlie finish the poor guy. He comes over to us and gently holds my shoulders and asks, \"Hey, Jessie? Are you ok? Did he hurt you?\" \"Yea I'm ok. He just grabbed my wrist really hard.\" I respond. \"Here let me see them.\" He orders. I do what he says and he gives me a sorry look. \"Don't worry it'll just bruise tomorrow.\" \"Ok. Thanks guys.\" I say. \"Hey, no problem. You want to hang with us for a while?\" Steve asks. \"Yea I would like that.\" I smile. So the three of us sit there laughing at how Billy dances. We see Dick come over to us and stand in front of me. \"Hey. Do you mind if I have this dance with you, miss?\" He holds out his hand for me to take. I smile and take it. He puts his hands on my waist and I put mine on his shoulders. We start jumping and dancing like crazy. It was like a brother sister dance. Just a few people next to us, I see Doc dancing with a China gal. It hurts like hell and it must have shown because I hear Dick ask \"Hey, you alright?\" He looks over at where I'm looking and he gives me a small smile. \"Don't worry. He likes you, he told me himself. He said he was going to ask you to dance if he could find you.\" I smile again and tried not to worry about it. Next we hear a bunch of gunshots and Dick pulls me under his arm and takes his gun out. We see their all yelling \"Happy New Year!\" Dick just laughs and starts shooting with them. He gives me the gun after a few shots and lets me shot some. I can't wipe the smile off my face at that moment. Morning comes and we're all heading back to the ranch. I'm back in the carriage and all the boys are singing a song and acting like they're drunk. Most likely Steve and Charlie are though. We come up to the hill and see a lot of turkeys. All the boys start running down, yelling. We hear a group behind us and see Murphy men coming toward us. I look at John with scared eyes, knowing what they'll do. He looks back at me and says, \"Jessie, get down and stay down. Protect the boys at any costs.\" I do what I'm told and hear a load of gunshots and see John fall down, dead. I want to scream but I don't because if they know I'm right there then they will kill me too. I lie in the carriage until dark, crying. John was the only father figure I have ever known and now he is gone. I hear more hooves coming around midnight and I stay quiet, pretending I'm dead. I hear three people get off their horses and run toward the carriage. I stopped breathing and moving hoping they will go away. I feel someone pick me up with strong arms. I am laid down on the ground and a familiar voice say, \"She still has a pulse. I don't see a bullet wound on her anywhere but she's not breathing.\" I realize that it's Doc. I peek open my eyes and see Doc, Dick, and Chavez. While Doc is talking to Dick, Chavez catches my eye and comes toward me. He pushes Doc out of the way and says,\"Hey. Are you alright, Chiquita?\" Tears just well up in my eyes and I shake my head. He gives me a sorry look and picks me up. He carries me to his horse and Doc helps me up. After we are all on our horses, we ride off. Probably somewhere where Murphy boys won't find us. As we are riding, I start to fall asleep. My last thought before I went to sleep was, \" This is just the beginning of a war.\"[Chapter 3] After the funeral of John we all stayed in town and waited for Alex McSween to get the judge to deputize us. We finally were able to but the boys thought it would be better if I stayed away from what they're doing. I kept telling them that I wouldn't leave them. \"Jess, you have to stay here. You could get hurt.\" Dick tried to reason. \"No! We're all in this together! Or did you guys forget that I was right there when they murdered John too?\" I yelled. \"You have to see our reasons, Jessie. If something happened then what would we do?\" Doc asked me. \"What would you do? What would I do!? I'm going to be stuck here. John asked me to take care of you boys if anything happened to him. Well, guess what. Something did happen to him! I'm sticking to my promise!\" I snapped. \"No you're not! You're staying here. We couldn't help John but we can sure as hell help you. You're staying with Alex. I already talked to him.\" Billy appeared. I glared at them but realized they're right. I might have to stay here. My face softened as I looked at them all. They all had determined and hopeful looks. They wanted to keep me safe and out of harm's way. I finally nodded my head, finally seeing reason. \"Ok.\" I said in a small voice. \"Ok. I'll go get my stuff from John's house then head out to the McSween house. I'll stay there only if you boys promise you'll stay careful and watch out for each other.\" They agreed to I went to go get my stuff. Alex and Susan welcomed me into their home and gave me a room to stay in. I felt empty for a few days, as I was alone in my room for the past 4 days. I thought we needed to get more food so I offered to go into town. They gave me money and I set off back into Lincoln County. I was walking down the street, looking for a small store where nobody would know it was me. I wanted little attention as possible. That didn't go to well because as I was walking past a brick wall, someone came from behind it. They covered my mouth and grabbed my waist. I tried screaming and kicking and punching. None of it worked. I shut my eyes and struggled even more when I thought they were gonna kill me because my boys were the new law. They dragged me behind the wall. I was still struggling and I never opened my eyes yet. They shoved me against the wall, hard. It knocked the wind out of me. I fell to the ground, holding my stomach, trying to catch my breath. My ears were met with a familiar voice screaming, \"What the hell did you do that for!? You don't shove a girl in a wall! Especially Jessie!\" I didn't look up but I opened my eyes and kept my gaze on the ground. I felt a pair of hands on my shoulders. I freeze and quickly look up. I'm met with a kind and almost scared look. I smile kindly at him and say, \"Hey Charlie.\" He still looks worried and helps me sit on the bench. I leaned against the wall and observe my surroundings. I see Dick, Billy, Chavez, and Doc fighting because Billy threw me into the wall. Steve came into front me and examined my head. \"Oh, shit. Charlie do you have a cloth? She's bleeding on the back of her head.\" Charlie grabbed his bag and searched for a cloth. He found one and gave it to Steve. He then put it to my head and told me to keep it there. I nodded and leaned back against the wall, once more. I kept hearing the boys fighting but I almost didn't care. It was good to hear their voices again. \"Hey! Knock it off!\" Dick yelled. I don't hear anything but hushed voices. I'm falling asleep but my body is shaken back awake. I open my eyes and see the whole gang in front of me. Dick was the one who shook me. \"Hey, Jess? You alright?\" I nodded yet again and answered, \"Yeah, I'm fine. My head just hurts. What about you? I haven't heard anything from you boys.\" I look over at Billy and we lock eyes. I point at him and casually say, \"Except you. You're an asshole.\" \"Sorry.\" Billy shrugged. \"We might have had a shootout and now we're wanted by the rest of the law.\" Doc exclaimed, glaring at Billy. A few days later and we find ourselves in the same spot, hiding behind a brick wall. Doc's reading the paper on how Billy is now known as a murderer and the leader of our gang. He is now known as 'Billy the Kid'. Doc continued to read until he stopped. \"Oh, shit.\" We all look at him weird. \"What?\" I ask. He looks straight at me and quickly shakes his head and says, \"Nothing. Don't worry about.\" I grab the paper as fast as I could. I got it, opened it up, and started reading on. \"We found out there is also a girl in the gang. Her name is Jessie Brooks but the name we now know her as is 'Juvenile Jessie'. She has long brown hair that she likes to keep braided and cowgirl hat on. She dresses like a young man and talks like one. We believe that she is in the gang because she willingly went along with them but witnesses say they saw the gang kidnap her.\" There was more but I had to stop reading there. I threw the paper down on the ground and walked down the little hill and leaned up against the fence. I took my hat off and took my braids out. After I did that, I put my hat back on and looked over the horizon. John used to always tell me that when I get older, I will get a farm of my own and live my dream. I don't think that's going to happen now. I hear the boys talking and I can't help but think if the boys only keep me here because they feel sorry for me. I don't realize I'm crying until I feel hot tears streaming down my face. I quickly wipe them away. I hear someone call me and I act like nothing happened. \"Jess. Are you ok?\" I hear Dick ask. I turn around and give them a blank face. I shrug and say, \"Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?\" They all just give me the ' I-ain't-that-stupid' look. \"Fine, I'm not really ok but I'll be fine. I just can't believe that people would say ya'll kidnapped me. They know how we all are. Other than that, I'm peachy keen.\" \"Come on, Jessie. Stop acting like that. You might be tough but you can't be all the time. Sometimes you have to talk about it and let it out.\" Doc said. \"There ain't nothing to talk about or to let out. What's done is done. Papers say I've been kidnapped so now everybody will be going after me. Nobody can change that.\" I respond. I ain't acting tough. I'm just trying to be stronger but they don't need to know that. I smirk and say, \"Well, now. Looks like I can't stay here anymore, now can I? Sorry boys, but it looks like ya'll are stuck with me now.\" \"Well then, if you're ok with everything, could you please put your hair back into braids? You look better like that. It shows who you are.\" Billy pushes, ignoring my comment, knowing I'm right. I glare at him but I do it, none the less. I tried but I couldn't because I couldn't see my hair, like I usually do in a mirror. I guess Chavez realized this so he came over and did it for me. I looked at him questionably, wondering how he knew how to braid hair. He knew what I was thinking and said, \"I grew up with baby sisters. I think I learned something from them.\" I just laughed. Everyone smiled when I laughed. I guess the papers and Murphy were all wrong. I do belong in this gang, and they need me here because I'm part of this little family.[Chapter 4] Steve was keeping an eye out for any intruders or bounty hunters. We sent him with food so he wouldn't starve. The rest of us were sitting in a building with a table full of food but Dick kept saying his prayers, so nobody could eat yet. Billy had enough and pleaded. \"Please, Dick. It's getting cold.\" They both draw out their guns as quick as a flash of lightning. Charlie was stuck right in between them and moved back a bit. Chavez didn't look the least bit surprised. Doc just sat there, calm as ever. I jumped out of my seat a bit and moved against the wall. \"I coulda killed ya, Dick. I coulda killed ya. But I don't wanna kill ya, I wanna eat.\" Billy said. \"When we finish this meal, you little rodent, we're gonna go out in the yard and see who has the right to run this group of Regulators.\" \"Richard, will you be ever so kind as to pass the gravy please.\" Doc asked nicely. It made me laugh at how clam Doc was. Steve runs in, looking scared. Said a man was coming up the hill way. Dick asked if there was only one. Charlie confirmed it was Buckshot Roberts. \"We got a warrant for him.\" Dick said. \"You think he came to surrender?\" Doc asked. All of us went outside to meet him. He was just getting off his little donkey. \"We got a warrant for you old man.\" Dick said. \"I ain't got no business with that warrant, no more.\" Buckshot Roberts answered back. \"Pecker-head son of a bitch. I'm on my own. Gonna get the $150 Sheriff Brady's got on for the kid. The rest of you little shits are only worth $110 but I'll take it.\" \"What a sweet disposition.\" Doc commented. \"And the girl, Juvenile Jessie is worth $200.\" \"You're not taking Jessie!\" Billy demanded. \"Let's dance.\" He started shooting at all of us. We all took cover but Chavez was shot in the leg. I went out and dragged him next to me and Doc. Doc went over to shoot him but he got shot right in the hand. I covered his hand and I started shooting with everyone else. Everything got deathly quiet. It seemed like Buckshot Roberts was dead but I wasn't so sure. As Dick and Billy were arguing about who will go out there, I stepped out and went to look. Dick saw me and yelled, \"JESS! GET BACK DOWN!\" Yeah cuz you know I'll listen. I silently laughed to myself. I got closer to the shack. It's like all the boys were holding their breaths. I heard Doc whisper, \"Jessie, please. Get back over here.\" \"Nope, sorry boys.\" I thought to myself. I was tiptoeing to the shack now and right when I saw the tip of the rifle, I was going to turn around but I was too late. I felt the bullet hit my chest and I collapsed. I heard so many voices all at once screaming, \"JESSIE!\" I felt two pairs of hand dragging me away from the battle field. I heard a laugh and a yell that sound like Billy's. \"Ha-ha. She's ok. The bullet hit her badge. She's alright.\" \"But it still hurts like a son of a gun.\" I then heard another two shots and knew something horrible had happened. I heard Steve yell, \"DICK!\" I didn't have to look to know what happened. He was gone. Buckshot Roberts killed Dick, who was like a big brother to me. Billy said we had to get out of here. Doc was helping Chavez get on his horse while I got on Rain. We started to head out but I saw Doc stop and look back at Dick. I knew then, that those two were like brothers also. We keep walking until we find a secure place to camp for the night. Doc said he had to get bandages for his hand and write to Dick's mother. Billy told him not to go near Lincoln. After he left Billy was talking about killing Brady. He and Chavez got in a fight about Chavez not caring John was killed. Chavez was about to leave but Billy got him to stay. Saying something about our own sacred hoop. How we are all we have left. How we are family. Soon it was dark out and we had a fire going. Charlie found one of Doc's books and started to read a page. \" The Bird by Josiah G. Scurlock. That's Doc. ' Once upon a midnight dreary, as I pondered weak and weary, they came and knocking at my…back porch.' He ain't very original, is he?\" Charlie read. \"Hey, here's a page titled 'Jessie'.\" He gave me the book and I read the page. It was about what he loves about me. Ugh, I really need to tell him, I love him. But there is never the right time with everything that been going on. \"He been gone an awful long time. I expect he'll be making a run for it.\" Charlie admitted. \"Who, Doc? Nah, Doc likes me.\" Billy said. After that I went to bed. I fell right asleep but really, who wouldn't after what had happened. I woke up to pounding of hooves coming toward us. I woke right up, went to my gun like Billy but I stayed down. We soon found out that it was Doc. I knew he would come back. I knew then, that nobody else in this little family we got, is gonna leave the rest of us behind. Now, that's a fact.[Chapter 5] Charlie went somewhere in town. It's just me, Doc, Steve, Billy, and Chavez in a little bar. Billy kept tormenting a bounty hunter until he just killed him. Suddenly Charlie came in and said John Kinney was here. Next thing I knew, we were all running in the desert for our lives. Just six of us being chased by 50 or 60 men. Yeah, there's nothing to worry, we got it all under control. We keep running down a hill into a bunch of prickers. Right before I enter the prickers, a bullet hit my side. I yell out in pain and Steve notices. Since he was in front of me, he leaned back and grabbed Rain's reigns and lead her through. I was starting to get dizzy and it was hard to keep my focus because of the pain. Steve looked back to see how I was doing and saw the state I was in. \"Hey, come on, Jessie. Stay with me. We're almost through this.\" I did my best but it was harder than you think. I was leaning forward in my saddle, starting to doze off. I felt a jolt and looked up. We jumped down into a little ditch and ran, where nobody could see us. We stopped and Steve ran toward me and helped me off. I was doing ok getting off but then I fell. Thank goodness he caught me before I hit the ground. Steve called Chavez and told him I was shot. They lied me down and Chavez started checking my wound. I was starting to have trouble breathing. He noticed and put pressure on it. It hurt like hell but it lessened the bleeding. Everyone soon found out what was wrong and was trying to help me. Chavez told them to take care of themselves while he fixes me up. Doc wouldn't leave my side; he just sat there holding my hand while I was in pain. Chavez quickly made a soup or something and told me to drink it. I did so and later found out that it was one of his Indian drugs to make you sleep. I woke up later in the day, when I heard a gunshot and could faintly hear Billy saying something about a sensation and heart pumping. I could hear everything clearly after a few minutes. Just then I heard Doc explode. \"I SHIT MY GOD-DAMN BRIDGES! OK?! We've taken enough Murphy scalps! We cannot win this war, not the six of us. Do you understand? Now…Billy you want to get the President's attention? Go ahead. You want to keep testing yourself, fine. Let me tell ya something. Tonight I'm taking Jessie and we're riding to the border, we're gonna get ourselves a nice, hot meal and a good night sleep. Come morning, we're Mexicans.\" \"Now why do you get to take Jessie with you? She can make her own decisions. You can't force her into going with you.\" Billy said. I pretend I just woke up and am still tired. \"Wait, what about, Jessie? Where am I going?\" I ask as I sit up and rub my eyes. \"Jessie, do you want to come with me tonight and ride to the border. We can get out of here; leave all of this shit behind. Start a new life. You can live your dream and own your farm.\" Doc asks. \"Yeah.\" \"See there's your answer, Billy. We're leaving tonight and starting a whole new life.\" \"Yea, yea Billy me too.\" Charlie pipes up. \"Mexico, huh? \" Billy asks. \"Mhm, yea.\" Doc confirms. \"I see. Ya'll are testing yourselves and you don't even know it. Trying to make it ole Mexico, that's a hoot. Ha-ha.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"They'll be covering every possible which way, all the way from Texas to Arizona. John Kinney knows everybody down along the border. There's a full day rising and the thorns we all love so much, which also makes good hiding places for scalp hunters and Indians. The chances to making it to ole Mexico? Well hell, that a test of all tests if you ask me. I'm in.\" he says as he walks away, patting Charlie on the shoulder. \"I'm really not liking him.\" Doc admitted. \"Me neither.\" I agree. \"Hey look, Jessie. Sorry we put that all on ya. I didn't mean for it to seem like I'm forcing you.\" \"It's alright. I woke up to hearing a gunshot and then you screaming and talking about taking me to the border.\" \"Oh, sorry about that too. Didn't mean to wake ya.\" He looks down, like he's ashamed. \"It's ok. Hey Chavez, am I going to be ok?\" I ask, wondering about my wound. He gives me a small smile and nods. \"Don't worry, Chiquita. Your fine now. Just don't run or anything that could tear or rip your bandages.\" I smile back, knowing he will fix anybody up, if they need help. \"Thanks.\"[Chapter 6] Charlie just got married to a little Mexican gal and now we are all dancing and having a blast. Right now I am dancing with Doc and we can't stop smiling. I thought that now was the best time to tell him that I love him. \"Doc? Can I tell you something? It's kind of personal.\" I ask him. \"Of course you can, Jessie. You know you can tell me anything.\" Doc replied. I took a deep breath and when I was just about to speak, we heard a gunshot. I was pissed because every time I get a chance it gets ruined. Everyone jumped and I sort of fell into Doc's arms. I looked up at him with fear because I left my guns in my saddle. He looked down at me with the same expression. We heard, \"REGULATORS! Let's saddle up.\" Now all the boys are sitting in their saddles and Charlie is comforting his crying wife. We heard about Alex's death plan coming up. Doc and Billy were trying to convince Charlie to stay but he wouldn't. I started to get in my saddle but then I heard a gun get pulled out. I stopped walking toward my horse and looked over. Billy had his gun pointed at me and said, \"Jessie, you stay here. We might not be able to keep Charlie here, but we can sure as hell keep you here.\" I thought he was joking around like he usually is. I started to walk forward again until I heard him cock his gun. I froze and realized he was serious. I looked over and Doc and Chavez for them to back me up, but they didn't. \"I'm sorry, Chiquita. You have to stay here for your own protection.\" Chavez told me. \"Jessie. You have to understand. This time is too dangerous for you.\" Doc said. I was hurt. They didn't think I could handle it? I didn't care. I kept walking but then I heard a gunshot and I jumped, realizing Billy just shot where I was about to step. I looked at him, shocked. \"ARE YOU CRAZY?!\" I screamed at him. \"Jessie, stop. You can't come with us this time. We're sorry.\" Doc said. \"No, I'm going and you can't do anything to stop me.\" I kept walking again, not caring if Billy shot me. Doc immediately got out of his saddle and ran over to me, grabbing my shoulders and kissing me. I have never thought I could have felt like that. Like it was only us. He pulled away and stared into my eyes. \"Jessie. Please stay. I can't lose you. I love you.\" \"I love you too, Doc.\" I said while almost in tears. As Doc got back in his saddle, I stared at him, hoping he will come back. As they were leaving, I saw Doc look back and give me a small smile. I did the same. I also saw Chavez mouth the words, \"I'm sorry\". I just nodded, to let him know its ok. About ten minutes passed and I went to Rain. I got right back in the saddle and took off. They didn't really think I was going to stay, did they? They had a good lead ahead of me but I saw them. They were like little specks but I saw them. I saw them enter Lincoln and I slowed Rain down just a bit. She was doing a small trot. I trotted over to Alex's house and saw a whole army set up ready to shoot. Looks like they already had a round of shootings too. \"HEE YAW!\" I galloped Rain right in front of the house. She reared and I started shooting and everyone else started shooting at me too. I was hoping Rain and I wouldn't get shot. I guess we both got lucky cause we didn't. I jumped down from Rain and I saw her run away from everything. I ran into the house, still shooting, protecting myself. I did hear my name being screamed by a few voices. I'm guessing the guys saw my performance. I opened the door and just when I was about to enter myself, someone yanked me inside. I was breathing heavy and looked around. Chavez was the one who pulled me inside, Billy was next to the window, Steve and Charlie were on the other side of the house, and last I saw Doc sitting by the window next to Billy. He stared at me looking almost angry yet relieved. Everyone looked at me with wide eyes. \"What? You guys actually thought I was going to listen to you? That I was actually going to stay?\" I had to laugh. \"Jessie, what the hell are you doing here?!\" Doc yelled at me. He got up and ran over toward me. I thought he was just going to lecture me but instead he pulled me into a bone crushing hug. \"I can't believe you did that. Why the hell are you so stupid? Are you trying to kill yourself? Don't you ever scare me like that again, ya hear me?\" I just nodded. We heard more shooting and Doc pulled me down and covered me. I screamed when broken glass started falling above us. When the shooting stopped, I looked up. Billy started giving orders. \"Charlie, take two rifles, go on up stairs. Doc you go on with him, load heavy. Jessie, you too\" I didn't hear the rest since the three of us were already going up stairs. Soon everybody was up there and loading their guns. It was getting dark so the people outside set up camp. Everybody was falling asleep, but not me. I needed to talk to someone. Doc was lying down with his arms around me. It didn't look like he was asleep, but I couldn't be sure. \"Doc?\" \"Hmm.\" He moaned. I sat up and looked him in the eyes. \"We ain't getting out of here alive this time, are we?\" We both stared at each other for a bit, looking into the other ones eyes. Me looking into his dark blue ones and him looking into my dark brown ones. He sighed and broke our eye contact, looking down. \"I don't know, Jessie. I really don't know anything, this time.\" I nodded my head to let him know I understood. I lied back down, my head on his chest, listening to his heartbeat. He wrapped both his arms around me and pulled me closer. He put his head on mine and whispered, \"Don't worry, Jessie. We'll be fine. We'll get out of this, just like we always do.\" He sounded like he was trying to convince both me and him. \"Doc, promise me you'll never leave me alone.\" \"I promise I'll never let you go, Jessie.\" And with that, we both fell asleep, peacefully. I was asleep but I woke up when I felt Doc trying to get up, slowly and quietly, trying not to wake me. Looks like that didn't work. I sat up and looked around. \"Sorry Jessie, I didn't mean to wake you.\" I look at Doc and smile. \"It's ok. I needed to get up anyway. Besides, we're in a war; I can't be sleeping through that.\" I looked over to the window where everyone else was. I wanted to see what was so interesting. I saw they sent in the troops. \"Billy, we're good but this is getting ridiculous.\" Doc admitted. We saw Murphy come. The general and he start talking. Finally Murphy suggests burning the house. They do what he says. We wait for them to light it. Soon I hear Steve say, \"They lit it, boys. They lit the house.\" \"ALEX! Get Susan out of here!\" Doc yells over the flames. I realize Chavez isn't there anymore. He must have a plan. I know he wouldn't just abandon us like that. Doc was trying to get me out of the house but I kept telling him that I wasn't going to leave him, like he promised not to leave me. He knew I wouldn't give in. I'm too stubborn for that. \"Where's Chavez?! Where the hell is Chavez?! \"Steve screams. \"I don't know!\" Doc screams back. Steve starts to throw a little fit and then he, Charlie, and Alex start to toss things out the window. Billy gets an idea, put him in a trunk and toss it out. We do so and Steve jumps out and shoots. Billy pops out and has a round of shooting. We all come out and then we hear Steve yell, \"CHAVEZ! YEAH!\" I look and see Chavez running on a horse with two more trailing behind him. He jumps over a few soldiers and sand sacks and I hear something I thought I wouldn't ever hear again. \"REGULATORS!\" John Kinney starts to shoot all of us. He got Billy twice in the arms, Doc in the shoulder, got Chavez when he was getting on a horse so he drops down. Steve jumps down and helps Chavez up. Charlie is battling John Kinney. Doc comes over to me and throws me on the back of his horse. We're riding out of there and I only see Billy, Chavez, and Doc. I look back and I see Charlie dead and I just saw Steve get shot multiple times before he falls into a puddle of mud, trying to save Chavez. I will never know any greater heroes than Charlie, Steve, Dick, and John. Chavez goes west and works at a fruit ranch. Billy stays in New Mexico, having the time of his life, being wanted and famous. Lastly, Doc and I, we both go to New York City and get married. He works as a teacher for young boys while I teach kids everything there is to know about what life can throw at ya. I mean really, our gang of Regulators should know a little something about life.[Chapter 7] Doc was at work, teaching boys how to read and write, while I was at my own work, teaching young teens what life might throw at ya. I walked around the class to see if anybody had any questions about how you have to always know who to trust, and who not to trust. One young girl raised her hand. I nodded my head as a sign to tell her to go ahead. \"What if it is someone you who have known almost your whole life?\" That was a good question. I answered, \"Well, you just have to watch their actions and be careful. Don't tell someone everything. You want to keep something's to yourself.\" After the day was over I went home. Usually Doc is always home before me. But he wasn't today. I kept looking for him, all over the house. He wasn't here. I started to get worried. I took the next two days off of work to find him. I never did. I had to go back to work for money. On my way to work, I was stopped by a few sheriffs. One of them said, \"Don't move and come quietly.\" I was shocked at first. We have been free for at least a year now, and they just find us? I didn't know what to do, so I went with them. I realized I was getting arrested when they tied my hands together, put my head in a knot of rounded rope, and tied it to a horse. They set off with me dragging behind them. Literally. My feet couldn't take it all and couldn't keep up so I mostly got dragged on the ground. It took two days, maybe three days to enter Lincoln. I wasn't keeping track and they never fed me. They gave me little water. The place looked so different from what I remember. This one guy, Bob, came up to me. He put his pistol near my head and shot the rope off. My hands and head were still tied together, though. \"Well, what do you know? It's Juvenile Jessie. Looks like we finally caught ya, kid.\" He led me to a huge pit and I saw it was filled with Murphy men, who were all chained. \"How would you like to join them? Join the same kind as you. Dirty, white trash.\" He laughed along with the group of men behind him. I glared at him as hard as I could. And I spit right in his face. He wiped it off, stared at me and slapped me making me fall into the pit, saying, \"Bitch,\" I fall down but I almost had a soft landing. Some of the men started gathering around me as one of them was choking me with his chains. Suddenly, he let go and I was trying to catch my breath. Somebody dragged me against the wall. \"Jessie Brooks.\" I hear a familiar voice say. I look up and see a face I thought I would never see again. I couldn't help but smile. \"Chavez. It's actually Jessie Scurlock now.\" He smiled back and responded, \"Well, congratulations then. How are you?\" \"Thanks. I'm doing well. Have you seen Doc yet?\" I asked worried. Chavez just nodded forward. I looked over and there was a commotion with the guy who was choking me and someone else. I took a real close look at the guy who helped me and it hit me. Big time. It was Doc. He was shaking the guy with every word. \"Now you listen, asshole. Don't you ever lay a finger on her again, ya hear me? I'll kill you, I swear I will.\" The guy looked like he was scared shitless. Doc let the guy go and turned to me. He rushed over and gave me a giant hug. I returned it and smiled, knowing I was safe with him and Chavez. He pulled away and gave me a kiss on the cheek. He looked at me with worried eyes and asked, \"Hey, are you alright? Did they hurt you? Did they give you any food at all?\" \"I'm ok, don't worry. They didn't feed me, just gave me a little water every day. What about you? Are you ok?\" I answered/questioned. \"Yeah, I'm ok.\" He went into his coat pocket and grabbed something. He pulled it out and I saw what it was. Bread. Maybe not fresh but, it's still food. \"Here, eat this. I've been saving it for a bit. I didn't know when they would give us real food so I kept this last piece.\" I took it and when I was about to take a bite I asked, \"When was the last time you two ate?\" They both looked down and didn't answer. I broke the bread into three pieces. I gave one to Chavez, one to Doc, and kept one for myself. They smiled gratefully and started taking small bites. I did the same. Next thing I know, it's dark and it seems like everyone is asleep. I couldn't, though. I knew something was going to happen. I was in the middle of Doc and Chavez, but I got up and went over to a little edge where I could sit. I sat down, stared at the full moon and got lost in my thoughts. What if this is the last time I get to see the moon? Will we ever get outta here? What's gonna happen to us? How are we going to escape? I got snapped outta my thoughts when I heard a soft voice. \"Jessie? What are you doing?\" I turned and looked to see Doc and Chavez staring at me. I just shrugged and turned back to the moon. I started talking. \"I'm just thinking. How are we going to get out of here? I feel like we're back in the burning house, not knowing what will happen and who we will lose. I wouldn't be able to take it if we lost someone else. Besides, we're getting hanged tomorrow.\" Chavez stepped in and said, \"When the neck is broken, there's only a sharp pain, fast. Then if the other place accepts you, the spirit horse comes. It takes you there to the other side. So don't worry too much. When you die, you're gonna see the spirit horse. She'll come for you, my friends.\" Doc apparently didn't like to hear all that so he said, \"Great. Let me tell you something, Chavez. I don't really want to catch a spirit horse. I don't even want to see the other side. I sure as hell don't wanna have our necks broke through a sharp, quick pain. The only thing I really want to do is get the hell outta here.\" Chavez looks over at him and says, \"Me too.\" I had to laugh at that because he's talking all about the Indian things and he doesn't even want to hear it himself. I went back to them and lied back down in between them. Doc put his arm around me and I put my head on his shoulder and held Chavez's hand. I knew something would come out of this but didn't know what. We just stayed like that until the three of us fell asleep, hoping we won't die, tomorrow.[Chapter 8] It was almost dinner time and we could hear the men laughing as they practiced/made sure that the gallows was working correctly. That asshole, Bob came over and said, \"Looks like it's getting near to supper time. You boy's hungry? I got two lots of news for ya. Good and bad. I'll give you the bad news first. All we got is horse shit!\" They all laughed their asses off. \"What the hell is the good news?\" asked one of the prisoners. \"There's tons of it.\" Doc answered while glaring at Bob. He glared right back and said, \"The world hates a smart mouth, Scurlock. You're gonna realize that tomorrow when you swing in the gallows. That's if the lynch mob don't come for ya first. Which I hear that that's what they intend to do. Let me know if you boys want some dessert.\" He just started laughing again, that bastard. Before I knew it, it was the next evening, dark with only the little fires making light around the town. Once in awhile some of the Murphy boys would look out of the cage to see it the lynch mob was here. We all were just sitting there, waiting to be hanged. Soon I hear hooves pounding on the ground and I knew that they had arrived. They stopped right in front of the pit while Bob went to greet them. \"Howdy. You're a bit late.\" Someone started yelling in the pit that they were here and to turn around so nobody knew who was who. Bob started talking again. \"The kid's escaped. Little weasel.\" One of the lynch mobbers got off his horse and said, \"Oh I'm sure he did, mister.\" He went inside the building to see and he came back out and yelled, \"It's true, he's gone.\" They opened the pit. I was getting more scared every second. Doc noticed and he put his arm around me, like he was hiding/covering me. Bob stepped up and said, \"We got some of his Regulators in there. The Indian, tenderfoot, and the girl. How'd they be?\" As he talked the prisoners grabbed Doc, Chavez, and myself and started pulling us to the entrance of the pit. One of the men up there said, \"Aw, shit. They'll have to do. Bring them up.\" As he pulled out a gun. They got us out and now we are getting on our horses, riding alongside the lynch mob. I'm scared to death and Chavez put a comforting hand on my shoulder and gives me a small smile. \"Pick you tree, breed.\" Ordered an unusually, strange, familiar voice. Doc spoke up and said, \"Gentlemen. I'm a school teacher in the city of New York. The young lady, she's my wife. And the breed, well he- he's our guide. And I believe you're about to make an enormous error. I swear, I'm a school teacher of the city of New York.\" \"I'm a school teacher from the city of New York.\" Said the familiar voice as he sets out a laugh. Chavez slows his horse as he stares at this guy. I do the same, knowing I've known him from somewhere. The guy pulls off the bag over his head and reveals who he is. William H. Bonney alias Billy the Kid. \"Hi ya, Doc. How're you drawers?\" He lets out that annoying, stupid laugh of his, once again. Doc stares at him with an amused look on his face. \"Nice to see you again, Billy.\" The Lincoln county boys realize that it's Billy. \"Come on let's skin out.\" Orders Billy. When we all look up to ride, we see a whole entire group coming toward us. \"Jesus. You sure got a lot of boys riding with you these days.\" Doc comments. \"Them ain't my boys. It's the real lynch mob. Let's get out here!\" Billy yells. I swear it's like a whole massacre. Everybody is shooting at everybody. I'm about to go in and enjoy the fun but Doc runs his horse in front of mine so I can't go anywhere. I yell over the noise. \"Come on, Doc! We haven't had a shootout in a year. Let me a have a little fun!\" \"No way! You stay here or somewhere behind a building; just don't go anywhere, where you can get shot.\" Doc yelled back, obviously worried but forgetting what we all have been through. I still do as he says, since I didn't even have a gun. I ran behind a building and stayed there until most of the shooting was done. But it never did. It was getting worse as we were leaving. Billy kept shouting at all of us so we know that we have to follow him. Here we are, the next day. Somewhere in the wild. Chavez had his chains broken and so did I but mine were rope so Chavez just cut them with his new knife. Doc was hunched over a brick waiting for Billy to shoot off his chains. Billy just kept joking around with him. \"Hold still, now. I've got this buckshot infection in my elbow that makes my right arm kinda, wooooa.\" Just as he was doing this, Doc looked up and saw his arm just shake and quickly hid back down, behind the brick, glaring at Billy. \"Hold still, now.\" Billy repeated, chuckling a bit. \"I am still. Just shoot the chain, ok?\" Doc asked. Billy unloads his gun and sighs. \"God damn, it's good to see you Doc. I knew you'd come back. But not with a wife. Ha-ha. I knew that would happen someday but not so soon. We made a pack remember. You, me, Chavez, and Jessie. Pals, forever.\" \"Billy the chain, come on.\" Doc nearly begged. \"Look, I don't care if you guys swat spittle and piss in each other's boot. I don't take to tenderfoots in my gang. And I definitely don't take to no Mexicans, either. ESCPECIALLY, no little, fragile girls.\" Said the new guy, Dave. \"It ain't your gang, Dave.\" Billy commented, annoyed. \"Who the hell are you calling a little, fragile girl!? I can kick you damn ass in two seconds! You better watch your mouth, you dumb, little city boy.\" I said as Chavez was pulling me away from him. Chavez had to throw in something too. \"Mexican-Indian, you son-of-a-bitch.\" That immediately took me back to when we first met Billy and I had to stop Chavez and Steve fighting. Back when everyone was alive and well. Dave raised his hands in mock surrender and decided to have a little fun. \"Oh, I'm sorry. Hey tell me something, Chavez. Was it the savages put into a Mexican whore or was it an Indian whore put into the whole god damn Mexico army?\" Just as he was finishing, Chavez went right after him, looked like he was going to choke him. As much as I wanted him to, I pulled him away the same way as he did me. Billy didn't like that either because he came over and growled, \"Remember something, Dave. This group is the Lincoln County Regulators.\" Dave just chuckled and responds, \"Yeah was.\" \"Were.\" Doc corrected. \"Come on, Billy the chains.\" Billy turned to him and said, \"You're right, Doc. Were. There ain't no more Regulators. No room for them.\" \"Billy, please.\" Doc started to beg, still crouched by the brick. \"Come on guys, let's just cool down and think of a plan to get back to the way it was just a couple day ago.\" I request as I bend down next to Doc to not leave him out. \"I'm taking the Mexican Blackbird.\" Billy suggests. \"What? What are ya taking?\" Dave asks. \"Broken trail, leads down to ole Mexico. Only me and a few other boys know it. Take the trail below. And Doc, once you're down there, these basket men. They'll come up and get your belongings, along with Jessie's whatever you need.\" Billy advised. \"Billy, come here.\" Doc leans towards Billy and whispers, \"Why don't you just shoot the chain, ok?\" Billy does a cool roll backwards and shoots the chain right off. All of us look pretty impressed. \"Pretty good.\" Doc comments. He tosses Billy his watch and lifts me up into the saddle on one of the horses. \"For the horse. That watch came all the way from New York.\" He gets on right behind me and takes the reins from behind. It's hard to imagine, I still feel safe and secure in his arms. \"Horse ain't for sale, Doc. But, uh, how about my boots. They're nice and broke.\" He got cut off by Doc punching him in the face saying, \"Son of a bitch!\" jumping off the horse, and landing right on top of Billy, tackling him. Dave started cheering. \"Wahoo, come on, Billy kill that tenderfoot son a bitch.\" Billy and Doc kept going at it. Chavez went over to get Doc off but couldn't so I went to help also. Doc yanked his elbow backwards, hitting me right in the nose. I let out a yelp and fall to the ground. I felt blood trickling down my face as I sat up. I looked up and saw Pat Garrett had Billy by the arms and Chavez had Doc by the arms. Doc was staring at me with a worry face, hoping he wasn't the one who hurt me. I just glared at him, got up, went over to the saddle, took out a cloth and tried to stop my nose from bleeding. Doc quickly turns back to Billy and starts yelling, \"I know you. I know you, you son of a bitch.\" Billy yells back. \"You knew me, huh? Well I know you, Scurlock! You kill half the men I get credit for. I saw you with blood all over your face. I saw you kill! Just because you went out east, got married, put on a sill cravat. That don't change what you did!\" \"Damn it, Chavez let me at him!\" Doc grumbles. Billy starts talking normally, but a little harsh. \"You remember the stories John use to tell us about the three china men playing Fan-tan? This guy runs up to them and says, \"Hey, the world's coming to an end!\" and the first one says, \"Well, I best go to the mission and pray,\" and the second one says, \"Well, hell, I'm gonna go and buy me a case of Mescal and six whores,\" and the third one says \"Well, I shall finish the game.\" I shall finish the game, Doc.\" Chavez lets go of Doc and they both seem to calm down. I'm still by the horse, my nose has stopped bleeding but it still hurts like a son of a gun. Doc looks over at me with sorry eyes. He walks over to me and asks, \"Hey, are you alright?\" I just stare him. \"I don't care what you do, Doc. Go back to New York, they'll get you. I'm going with Billy. I know you don't like it but I sort of want to live.\" Chavez steps in also. \"They'll catch you, Doc. They caught me. Everybody but him.\" He looks over at Billy as everyone starts heading out. \"The villagers say he's the Aledo, turning into a chayote. A spirit, disappears, never gets killed. Me? I just think he's the luckiest wide eye in New Mexico.\" \"Chavez, I can't ride with him anymore. For the past year, I've been trying to forget about him. I just can't. I read about him in the newspapers, in those damn 5 cent books, Jesus, the kids imitate him in the streets. He's in my sleep. Ya got to understand what I'm saying. It's over.\" Chavez sighs and says, \"When the spirit horse comes, then it's over.\" He rides off toward the group. Now it's just Doc and I. \"Jessie, come on. We got to get back home. This isn't our life.\" Doc tried to convince me. Tears well up in my eyes and I shake my head to stop them from pouring down my face. He sees this and pulls me into a hug, into his arms. I choke back a few sobs and finally respond. \"I'm sorry, Doc. But they'll kill us if we go back. They'll never find us down below. We can restart a new life again. Either way I'm going. I don't want to go without you, Doc but there's not much of a choice. I'm sorry.\" I get on my horse and ride after Chavez, who was sitting on his horse a few yards away, waiting for us or waiting for just me. He gives me the same small smile he gave me just hours before. I give a bigger smile and he does the same. I'm trying to be strong and not let the tears fall. I look back and see Doc start to go the other way but I saw him quickly turn around and come towards us. He gives me a bright smile and all my tears and worries wash away. This time I smile back. A real smile. The three of us head out over the horizon and follow Billy, Pat, and Dave. So we really are going to ole Mexico and start a new life again.[Chapter 9] Here we are, riding to John Simpson Chisum. We got two new guys, Tom and Hendry. Pat left the group to live a normal life, not a criminal one. We were all riding to John's ranch and he walked out, up to us. He was the first one to speak. \"Well, by God. You really turned out to be a snake, Billy. When they catch you, they're gonna drive out your stinking bones.\" \"I'm just trying to get my friends to ole Mexico. We need some pesos'. I've done some figuring and I believe you owe me $500. $250 for the fighting we did last year and $250 for me leaving your stock alone.\" Billy advised. \"Is that what you figured?\" Mr. Chisum challenged. \"Yes sir. That's what I figured.\" Billy teased. \"Well you can take those figures and shove them up your arrogant little ass and set fire to them. I don't owe you a god damn thing. Now get the hell outta here, before I bring my 50 men down and give you a real game.\" Mr. Chisum yelled. \"Yeah, we uh…we saw some of your men up there on the high range. Passed right by them, fine bunch.\" Dave commented. \"Mr. Chisum. You're right. Lincoln county war is over. We just want to get outta here. Get down below.\" Doc claimed. \"Oh, you'll get down below, alright, Doc. You'll get down below. You're Billy the Kid too, y'know. You all are. Dirty little Billy bastards. And I don't owe you anything, Doc. Or you Chavez. And definitely not you Jess.\" Mr. Chisum babbled. I pulled out my gun and pointed it right at his head. \"Never call me that.\" Only Dick will call me that, since he is dead, I guess nobody gets to call me that. \"You took my farm, Mr. Chisum.\" Hendry argued. \"You took a lot of farms, Mr. Chisum. As long as Billy the Kid is taking some back, I'm with him.\" As he was talking, two Mexicans came behind John and one of them asked, \"Everything alright here, Mr. Chisum?\" He says it's ok but then Billy intervenes. \"Yoo-hoo I'll make you famous. Mr. Chisum, which one of these boys is best with iron.\" The other guy said it was him. Mr. Chisum was trying to convince Billy not to do it. But Billy kept going. He got out of his saddle and came over to me. Billy helped me off my saddle, even though I hate it when they do it. He made me stand in front of the guy who I thought he was going to challenge. I was confused but I went along with it. \"What I'm going to do is have Jessie here, kill every one of your men for every five dollars you owe me, Mr. Chisum. Only she's going to do it fair.\" He undid my holster and threw it far from me. Personally I was getting scared. I looked at Doc and he looked like he wanted to kill Billy again, yet he looked at me in the eyes and I saw he was scared too. Billy started talking again. \"How's that for square. Now when Jessie goes for her gun, you start shooting. I promise you, you will not make it. Ready?\" The guy nodded his head. \"Yeah, I'm ready.\" I was starting to shake. I was about to make a move for my gun but Billy's voice stopped me. \"Dave.\" I looked over and saw Dave blast the guy before anyone of us got to make a move. Billy started laughing, still behind me, next to his horse with everyone else. Billy looked please and said, \"495.\" The other guy who was still alive went to grab his gun. My breathing started to quicken. I knew I couldn't make it to my gun, Billy threw it too far. I looked over at the boys and Billy, for once, looking worried. \"Hendry.\" He was having trouble get his gun and the Mexican guy just got his gun and aimed it at me. My eyes widen and I was about to run. \"Hendry?!\" Before I could blink, that Mexican guy got blown off his feet by a bullet. I turned around and saw Doc lowering his rifle, breathing just as heavy as me. We made eye contact and I silently thank him. Billy was the first to recover and said, \"490.\" \"You just killed yourself.\" Mr. Chisum announced. Doc just glared at him. He watched me got on my horse, making sure I wasn't hurt. Once I was up he turned his horse around and I did the same. We were leaving this place, and that's that. When we were all going, I overheard Mr. Chisum threaten, \"Bonney, you are a fool. You call yourself a scourge of New Mexico. Well by God, I. Am. New. Mexico. And you are dead.\" Doc and I were at the front of the group while everyone was catching up. Doc broke the silence after a few moments. \"Hey, Jessie. Are you sure you're alright?\" I just nodded. \"Yeah. Just a little nerve racking. Pretty scary when someone has a gun pointed at you when you know you can't defend yourself.\" He chuckles a bit and responds, \"Well, I wonder what you just did when Mr. Chisum called you Jess.\" \"That was different. Besides, he deserved it. And he calls us the dirty bastards.\" I chuckle.[Chapter 10] The seven of us have been riding for hours now. My butt's getting really sore now and it looks like everyone else is looking uncomfortable sitting. It didn't look like anyone was going to speak up to tell Billy what to do so I stepped up. \"Billy. We have to set up camp. It's getting dark and we'll need our energy tomorrow if we run into any unwanted visitors.\" Billy stared at me and nodded after a few moments. \"Alright. We'll keep going until we get to the mountains. I think we're getting close to them.\" We rode for about another hour until we finally found our destination. We got off and unsaddled. I started to talk again. \"Dave, Hendry you two find some campfire wood. Billy, Tommy you two find water to fill our containers. Chavez, Doc you guys try to start a dinner for everyone. I'll find us a place to sleep and set up camp.\" Everyone did what they were told. We all separated into different directions. I kept stomping on the ground until I found a soft patch of grass. Chavez and Doc were getting dinner ready and it was only the three of us, waiting for everyone else to get back. \"Hey Doc, Chavez. Toss me your sleeping bags. I found a spot.\" I informed. Chavez tossed me his and I put it down. Right when I looked up I see another one come flying right at me. It hits me right in the face and I tumble over a rock. I pop my head back up and glare at Doc and shout, \"Hey! Watch where you're throwing things!\" They both just chuckle and Doc responds, \"Sorry, sweetheart. Maybe you should have been paying attention.\" \"Screw you.\" I mumble. Everyone got back after a half hour and it got dark. We ate dinner and set up camp. We got our containers filled with water and we got a nice, big fire in the middle of our circle. Dave, Hendry, and Tom fell fast asleep. The only ones that were awake were us four remaining Regulators. Billy, Doc, Chavez, and myself. The four of us close in on the fire and were just staring at it. I suddenly remember the old times, when Dick, Charlie, Steve, Doc, Chavez, myself, and even Billy went out camping a few times together. It was wild with the seven of us. I silently laugh to myself. I guess that got the boys attention. \"What's so funny?\" Billy questions. I looked down at my feet and shook my head, still laughing. \"Remember the times when we all went camping, together. Charlie and Steve would bring beer. Dick would try to keep everybody where he could see them. We were all a little too noisy. The whole town could hear us and yelled at us to shut up. Those were fun times.\" They all got smiles on their faces as they remember too. \"I would always threaten Steve by putting a blade to his throat.\" Chavez laughs. That got my smile even bigger. Everyone started laughing out loud, but not too loud to wake the rest up. \"Yeah. Things were so simple back then. Things weren't so hard, complicated, difficult… and scary.\" I say, sadly. Billy put his hand on my shoulder comfortingly and said, \"Hey, it'll be alright. We've got the gang back together, we're unbeatable.\" He cracks a grin and jokes, \"Besides, your Juvenile Jessie. You should be having fun, being chased all over the country.\" \"It's not that fun, Billy! It is to you but not me! Or Doc! And it don't look like Chavez is having a blast, either!\" I took a deep breath and calmed down. \"We're not like you, Billy. We don't wanna be on the run for the rest of our lives, which from the looks of it, won't be long now. We all just want to have a regular life.\" I got up and walked over to the ledge and swung my feet over it. I sighed and looked up at the midnight sky. I heard footsteps coming towards me but I didn't move. The person sat next to me. I turned and was met with a Mexican-Indian face looking at me, worriedly. I shook my head, silently telling him I don't want to talk right now. I looked back at the sky and Chavez did the same. \"It's a beautiful night…\" Chavez trailed off. \"Yup. Maybe we'll get lucky and see another week's night.\" I tell him. Chavez turned to me with an expression I knew all too well. He was about to start speaking about his Indian culture. \"The spirit horse will come for you, Chiquita when the time is right. Now is not your time. When it is, she will be ready to come for you, Jessie.\" He pulls out a beautiful feather necklace and gently ties around my neck. \"This is for you. Now you will always have me with you, no matter what may happen. Brothers and sisters have to stick together. When one is lost then the other will be lonely until they are both rejoined together as family.\" I look down at it and I feel special that he thinks of me as his sister just as I think of him as my brother. I turn to him once more with tears in my eyes and whisper, \"Thank you. This means a lot.\" He gives me a smile and pulls me in for a hug. I hug him back and we stay like that for a minute. We both pull away and he tells me goodnight and to sleep well. I go to sleep soon after and know I will never be alone. Now I've got a ring and necklace to prove it.[Chapter 11] We are just entering this new town, White Oaks. We stopped at this 'whore house'. One of Billy's old friends owned it. We have to stay there for the night and figure out what to do with the new sheriff, Pat Garrett. We unsaddled our horses and went into the building. One girl, I'm guessing the person Billy was talking about came out and gave him a hug. Then it hit me. It was Jane Greyhouse. Jane started talking. \"Wicked boys. Wicked and wanted or just plain wicked. Oh and of course Jessie just had to come along too, now didn't she? Somebody has to keep you boys in line now don't they?\" When we first met we were sort of good friends. Dave got comfy and grabbed a few shot glasses, gave one to Tom. He tried it but by the look on his face, he didn't like it. \"$1,000 on me.\" Billy said proudly. \"Yeah? Last I heard it was 500.\" Jane shot right back at him. \"Well, you heard wrong.\" Billy denied. \"Well, I also heard you ain't long for the territory, Billy.\" Jane announced. \"We're not. We're going to ole Mexico, right Billy?\" Doc assured. Billy and Jane were having a conversation about the changes of everything, while I found a book to read. I grabbed it off the shelf, sat on the sofa and started to read it. All the girls in this whore house were annoying me, by giving all the boys looks. Doc took a shot saying Jane was the lady of the manor born. Whatever that is. He went to take a bath; Billy went to a bedroom with another girl, same with Dave. I don't know where Tom and Hendry are but Chavez is next to me. I was actually reading part of the book to him. Chavez knew how much I loved reading and helping him read a book is even better, because he never got to learn more words since John Tunstall died. He seemed sort of interested in the book. I saw something out of the corner of my eye. I looked up and saw pitch forks and torches from the window. I hear pounding footsteps coming from upstairs and now everyone is in the main room. Jane said she was going to take care of this and walked out the door. As she walked up to the deputy she was yelling, \"What is going on here!?\" They grabbed her arms and secured her. Deputy Carlyle yelled, \"Billy the Kid. We have Jane Greyhouse and if you try anything while I am in there with you, investigating, the people say they are going to burn her. Do you agree to these terms?\" \"Who is this guy?\" Billy laughed. He cleared his throat and said in an almost mocking voice, \"Yes sir, we agree to those terms.\" He put his gun away and turned to all of us. \"Ladies upstairs. Gentlemen, look respectable. Tom, disappear. Jessie, you stay here with us.\" Everyone followed his orders and soon the deputy walked in. Chavez was reading the book from earlier, Doc was playing with his nails, Billy was reading the newspaper, Dave was playing with cards, and Hendry was watching the fire. Me? I was badly trying to sew a button on my bag so it will stay shut. I've been meaning to do this for a while but yet, I'm just faking it so I'll look respectable. \"Gentlemen.\" Carlyle announced his presence. We acted like we didn't hear him and he cleared his throat. \"Uh, which one of you is the leader of your gang?\" Billy slowly lowered his newspaper and said, \"That would be me-\" \"Arkansas Dave.\" Dave interrupted. Billy turned to him and childishly said, \"You are not, Dave.\" \"I am so.\" Dave argued just as childish. \"You are not.\" \"I am so!\" \"Are not!\" \"I am so!\" They kept going until Carlyle cleared his throat again and said, \"Gentlemen, I am a deputized man. I do things law way.\" \"Which way?\" Billy questioned as he stood up. \"Uh, law way.\" Carlyle answered, hesitantly. \"Law way. I see. Ok, ok go ahead.\" Billy urged him on. \"Now the people out there, they do things their own way. They got their minds set on a hanging. It's gonna be hell if I don't give them what they want. So uh, I understand you have an Indian and a girl in your group.\" \"Yes sir. Jose Chavez y Chavez. He's a Mexican-Indian. Jessie Scurlock. She's a tough girl. As tough and hard as can be. How they'd be?\" Billy negotiated. My eyed widened. He's just going to give us up like that? \"Well that'd be just fine.\" Carlyle replied. \"If I can give this Indian and Girl to those people out there, the rest of you can just ride out.\" I saw Chavez go for his knife and put the book away. I stopped my sewing and looked up. I moved my hand under my seat, so my fingers were just grasping my gun. Billy started laughing and said, \"You here that, Chavez, Jessie? Sir, I agree to those terms. They're an angry mob indeed and we do happen to have an Indian and girl in our premises.\" He walked right up to us and whispers to Chavez, \"Give me your hat.\" Chavez does what he is told and Billy takes his blanket also. Dave takes Carlyle's coat and hat off and Billy puts the hat on him and the blanket over him. Billy spits out, \"The Indian and girl are going out to satisfy the crowd. But you obviously don't understand the meaning of the word Pals. You think I would hand my friends over to a bucket of mule dung like you? That's an insult! Turn around chief.\" By this time, everyone has their gun out, pointed right at the Deputy. \"ALRIGHT YOU WHITE CAPS! WE'RE COMING OUT, BUT WE'RE COMING OUT SHOOTING! GET READY FOR WAR! WOA WOA WOA WOA!\" Billy screams, pushes out the deputy while Dave keeps the door open. He shoots off somewhere into the crowd and ducks. The whole crowd outside starts shooting. Dave jumps behind the door, Doc jumps under the table, Hendry rushes over behind a table, and Billy gets down on the ground. Chavez jumps over the couch and pulls me along with him but not in time. A bullet hits me in the side. The same side where I got shot when we were being chased by John Kinney. The shooting stopped and everyone stands up but me. Billy grabs a shot and raises it. \"Pals.\" Chavez looks down at me with my arm wrapped around my side in tears. He crouches down to my level and starts whispering. \"Hey, Chiquita. Are you alright?\" I shake my head no. He looks down at my hand, removes it from my side and sees it's covered with blood. His eyes widen and he looks over at the rest of the group. He only yells to one specific person in the room. The one that can help. \"DOC!\" Doc looks over his shoulder and sees me. He rushes over and looks at my side. He starts mumbling under his breath. It's getting harder to breathe and keep my eyes open. Doc sees that I'm having trouble and says comforting words. \"Don't worry, Jessie. You'll be fine. We'll fix you up. Just stay awake, ok?\" The words made me feel better but they didn't help. After a few seconds, I passed out. I woke up on a soft bed. There was a little candle on the night stand. I hear someone else's breathing. I look over and there's Doc. His head is laying on one of his arms, on the side of the bed while his other arm is wrapped in my hand. It looks like he's asleep so I leave him there. I hear footsteps approaching my room and the door open. I look and there is Chavez coming in with a smile on his face. He walks over to me and gives me a hug. \"You are lucky to be alive, Chiquita.\" He informs me. He looks at Doc and back at me. \"Y'know he was going crazy when you passed out. We all did. Even Billy and Dave, believe it or not. We thought we had lost you. Especially after getting shot on the same side you got shot only a year ago.\" I was wondering about my side and if I was going to be alright. I moved my hand over my side and it stung a little bad not as bad as I thought it was going to. \"Don't worry, Jessie. You'll be fine. You are the strongest person I know. It is not your time for the spirit horse to come visit you.\" Chavez explained. \"I'll leave you two alone for you to talk.\" He gives me a smile before walking out. I look at Doc and shake his arm gently. \"Doc?\" I whisper, quietly. \"Doc, you gotta get up.\" He moans a bit and stirs before actually waking up. He lifted his head and saw me awake also. He jumped out of his chair and gave me the biggest hug ever. I thought my bones were being crushed. He buries his head in my hair and whispers, \"Thank goodness. I thought I lost you. You just have to keep scaring me, don't you?\" I smile and say, \"That's my job. Girls have to make guys worry.\" We pull away and Doc starts talking. \"Billy said once you wake up, we'll have to saddle up and ride out of here as fast as we can. Garrett is hot on our trail.\" I noticed I'm wearing his coat. I look at him questioningly and ask him, \"How long have I been out and why am I wearing your coat?\" \"Um, about 2 days now. We'll get you some food and water, make sure you have energy and then we'll skin out of here. When you were passed out last night, it looked like you were shivering so I covered you up with my jacket.\" I nodded my head. I got out of bed and when I started to walk, I dropped like a rock. Doc caught me just in the nick of time. I looked at him and said, \"My side. It doesn't hurt but when I put pressure on it, then it feels like a knife.\" It was his turn to nod his head. He helped me stand up and picked me up in his arms. He carried me down stairs. I saw that everyone was bumming around. Billy and Dave were having a staring contest. Hendry, Tom, and Chavez were playing a card game. They all looked up when they heard steps coming down the stairs. They smiled when they saw me. Doc set me down on a chair in front of a table. Hendry came over to me and placed a small plate of food in front of me along with a cup of water. I didn't want to eat but the look everyone gave me made me eat it all. Once I was done eating and everything, we saddled up our horses and headed out back on the trail. As usual I'm riding between Doc and Chavez with Billy and Dave riding in front of the group while Hendry and Tom were riding behind everybody. I was starting to realize something. This group is like a family. Doc is my husband, Chavez is my big brother, and Tom is my little brother. Billy and Dave were like twin brothers, and Hendry was a good friend to all of us.[Chapter 12] Here we are. Sitting in an old torn down building. After a loss of a group member, a young boy named Tom O'Falliard. Died only at 15 years old, protecting Billy so he wouldn't be the one to get shot. We are all sitting around, mourning over the death of a young boy, next to a little campfire, trying to stay warm. Nobody is talking. Nobody is moving. Nobody is eating. Nobody can think clearly. Billy was the first one to break the silence. \"I spent a lot of nights out here after the Lincoln county war. Tried to put another outfit together but uh it was never the same. When you boys came back, I felt like there wasn't nothing I wouldn't do to keep the gang together. Keep riding.\" \"What are you saying Chivato?\" Chavez asked. \"You know what a Mexican Blackbird is?\" \"It's a broken trail that leads to ole Mexico.\" Hendry answered, confused. Doc slowly looked up and stared at Billy. Chavez never moved but he stared at Billy like he never met him before. Hendry and Dave kept staring at the fire. I couldn't move. I just stared at the wall the whole time. Billy shook his head and said, \"It's a half black, half Mexican whore…\" Doc starts to rub his hands together, looking around, not keeping eye contact with anyone, while looking a little tense. \"So you, uh… you named the trail after her, right?\" Billy doesn't say anything, just looks away and puts his head down in shame. Doc continues. \"There is no broken tail to ole Mexico, is there, Billy? Is there?! You son of a bitch! You're starting to believe what they're writing about you in the papers, aren't you? Let me tell you what you are! You rode a 15 year old boy straight to his grave and the rest of us, straight to hell… straight to hell. William H. Bonney! You are not a God!\" as Doc was finishing up, he grabbed his gun and pointed it right at Billy. Billy slowly stood up and quietly responded, \"Why don't you pull the trigger and find out.\" I stood up and walked over to Doc. He never broke eye contact with Billy, both of them glaring at each other. I looked at Doc and whispered to him, \"Doc, it's gonna be ok. Just put the gun down and we'll figure something out. We're all gonna be just fine. Trust me.\" He blinked a few times after realizing what he was doing. He put the gun down and kept repeating, \"We gotta get home. We gotta get back home.\" He grabbed our stuff and headed for the door. Right when he walked out, I heard a gunshot. I quickly looked over and saw Doc falling. I couldn't help but scream. \"NOOOO!\" Chavez carried him over behind a wall. I followed and Billy did too. Billy kept shaking Doc and repeating, \"Come on, get up. Get up, Doc.\" Chavez had enough of that because he snapped at him and shoved Billy away. \"You leave him alone!\" I couldn't stop crying. Tears were streaming over my face, uncontrollably. I kept shaking my head and kept trying to stop the bleeding. \"Doc, please! You promised you'll never leave me alone! You promised!\" He looked deep in my eyes. He had blood coming out of his wound and mouth but he kept calm. He finally said, \"I promised I'd never let you go. I'll never let you go, as long as you keep living your life. You make your dream come true and you never lose yourself.\" I nodded my head and the tears just came faster. We both knew he wouldn't make this one. We all did. Doc got Chavez to help him up while Dave and Billy were fighting over whose gang it was. I overheard Hendry saying, \"Go to hell, they shot Tommy.\" Doc stepped up the plate and yelled, \"Billy! Let's finish the game.\" Billy knew it had to be done so he gave him the guns. Doc had a gun in each hand and he ran out, yelling, shooting at anyone he could to protect us. Billy was shouting at everyone to go. Dave went first, next Hendry, then Chavez, and lastly me. Right when I was about to turn the corner I looked back and saw Doc collapse. Dead. I knew there was no turning back now, especially now that I didn't have him by my side. We all kept running. Hendry and Dave both got a horse fairly quick but Chavez and I had a lot of trouble. Chavez quickly turned around and shot someone who was aiming at me. I gave him a thankful nod. He grabbed me and jumped behind a bush so we wouldn't get shot. We were both breathing really heavy and knew this might be the end. He leads us down a hill where someone was running away on his horse. Chavez jumped on the horse and was getting dragged. Someone else was running by so I did the same thing. I couldn't find Chavez but I fell down a hill after the horse jumped it. I remembered I still had a loaded gun. I went to grab it and pulled it out. Another guy came over to me and I shot him right off his horse. I got on but as I was getting on a man came over and shot me. This time it wasn't in the side, arm, leg, or shoulder. It was fatal. The man shot me in the stomach. It knocked the wind out of me but I grabbed the reins and saw Chavez and Hendry just climbing up the hill. They heard my horse's hooves pounding so they quickly turned around. They looked relieved when they saw it was me. They kept telling me to hurry before we got caught. I soon got to the top of the hill with them. We started riding, just the three of us. The sky was becoming a sunset and I had a chance to think about everything that just happened. Doc just got killed. Billy got captured. Dave abandoned us. Hendry came back for Chavez and I. Chavez was the last family I had left. He was a brother to me. But I guess not for long. I looked over at him and saw him having trouble breathing as well. I spoke up and asked him, \"Hey, Chavez? Are you ok? You don't look so good.\" He looked up after a few moments and answered, \"Yeah. Yeah, I'm alright. What about you, Chiquita? You're talking about not looking so good, look at yourself.\" Both the boys were now watching me and I turned my head so I was staring right toward the red, orange sunset. I nodded and kept my hand firmly on my wound. I looked at Chavez again and saw he was doing the same thing. I looked at him wide eyed and nearly yelled, \"You got shot!?\" His eyes never left mine as he calmly replied, \"Yeah, but it looks like you have too, Chiquita.\" We arrived at Beaver's place and finally got to rest. Hendry walked in first and sat down. I nearly fell from light headedness but Chavez got me. I gave him a grateful smile. He did the same as 'you're welcome' and then he sat down. We were both out of breath and I closed my eyes. I heard a click and my eyes snapped open. I looked over and saw a gun pointed at Chavez's head and I wanted to scream. But then Billy came out and he just laughed. \"You're not dead.\" Thank you Hendry, we have accomplished that by now. Billy just laughed again and said, \"Do I look dead? You should have seen the short work I did on Bob Ollinger. Spread him out like Tularosa.\" He just kept laughing but then grew serious. \"We're skinning out. We'll ride for Canada. Chavez, make sure the horses are watered. Jessie, make sure everything is packed, all food, water, clothing. Hendry—\" \"We'll be staying here.\" Chavez announced. \"You stay here, Garrett will take you two.\" Billy implied. \"He already took us.\" I claimed. \"When?\" Billy asked, worried. Chavez sighed and answered, \"When he took Doc.\" Billy looked at us a little confused and we both showed him our wounds. Billy looked shocked. Like he didn't know what to do or say. \"Those are bad shots, guys. You get shot like that it's, uh…\" \"It's over.\" Chavez finished. Billy looked at both of us like he wanted this to be a big joke or this was just a dream. He walked away and flipped over a table. It looked like he wanted to cry. \"Well, uh I guess I, I really got us into it this time, huh?\" He looked over at us with tears in his eyes. \"It ain't supposed to be you two sitting there like that. It's supposed to me.\" Chavez looked at me and handed me a blanket. We both stood up and looked over at Billy. Chavez was the only that had spoken a word. \"Chivato.\" He was telling him that it was our time. Chavez looked over at me and grabbed my hand. He led me outside until he turned around. There was Billy, almost in tears. Chavez gave him a small nod, for respect and thanks for everything he has done for us. Billy just gave us both a small nod to tell us that he understands. We started walking through the little cemetery. We stopped in a tiny building for the dead. Chavez collapsed and I followed him on the ground. I was growing weaker. I couldn't think straight. I could barely keep my eyes open. Chavez looked over at me and noticed. He put a hand on the side of my face and whispered, \"Sleep, Chiquita. Do not worry. We'll see each other in a better place in a minute with all the others.\" It was comforting yet at the same time, I didn't want to go. I kept my eyes open and whispered back, \"Chavez. Thank you, for being here for me. You will always be my brother. Blood or not.\" I saw him fall even lower and then stopped moving all together. He was gone. I couldn't hold on any longer. I had to let go. There was one thing I had to say out loud, even if nobody could hear me and I was alone. I grabbed my feather necklace, opened my mouth and out came the word \"Regulators.\" I closed my eyes and saw a glowing horse running towards me. A spirit horse. I felt my body lose all feeling and I didn't feel any more pain. I felt like I was floating in the air. I opened my eyes again, and couldn't believe what I saw. I knew it was real but I couldn't believe my eyes. There in front of me, all standing in a line, was my family. John Tunstall, Richard \"Dick\" Brewer, Charlie Bowdre, Dirty Steve, Jose Chavez y Chavez, and last but definitely not least, Josiah \"Doc\" Scurlock. I smiled and knew that I might have been on the other side but at least I was reunited with my boys. ","Summary":" Here I am, in the kitchen, making a chocolate cake for the boys. I hear shouting in the front yard "},{"Movie":"Young Guns","Title":"Chavez's Only Spirit","Author":"ArchAngelCayta","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6726628","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chavez's Only Spirit Chavez has known Catori since she was born he remembers from his childhood, he does everything to protect her but it was always just a brother-sister relationship, however when a new boy comes and the regulators start, something's have to change. The last memory had of my mother was the morning before her death she was teaching me how to make fry bread, it was my fourteenth birthday, we were laughing and smiling at each other she would tell me stories that would make me laugh, it was the first in a long time that we were happy… Then the men that works for Murphy came and whipped out my family, gunshots going off fire lighting up the sky my father hid me in the tall grass behind our teepee 'Lay here, stay hidden, and be as quiet as possible, when it is over run away to our friends and warn them, I love you my daughter.\" \"You wanna play games pendejo?\" The familiar voice echoed through my head and interrupted my memory, my hands were soaked with soap and water from the morning dishes, I looked up and looked out the window. Rolling my eyes at them 'Of course always fighting, boys are so annoying.' I said in my head \"Man you're a red ass Mexican and you do it with your horse...\" A strong sound of someone spitting caused me to cringe \"Mexican…Greaser.\" \"Come here you white chicken shit!\" I dried my hands on my apron and walked out of the kitchen on the front porch, I hated wearing a dress I would rather wear trousers and a shirt but it wasn't a allowed \"A lady is meant to dress like one.\" Of course that never stopped me from carrying a knife and a gun on my legs, I stood out on the front porch and looked at the two of them fighting, they always were; Steve Stevens he was always covered in dirt and chewing tobacco a nasty habit that he has started at a young age, he also had a problem with different breeds I was half Indian and half White. Jose Chavez Y. Chavez was the other part of the fight, half Indian and half Mexican he was my protector, my friend, and my teacher, he had excellence in knives, he knew guns but he was excellent at knives and he taught me how in the end. Finally when I was starting to wonder if Chavez was going to skin Steve, Richard rode up with the horse \"Hey hey, enough, you know better Chavez! Hey!\" I walked over and stood between them causing Richard to draw the horse back and step aside, both Steve and Chavez stepped back away from me \"Both of you that is enough, what did I say about being near each other during work and when John is gone, you're acting like children.\" All of us stopped at the sound of the carriage coming back to the house \"John's back.\" Richard said. Doc hopped down from the carriage and walked over to us, Doc was a handsome man with blonde hair and a beard, he was older than I was by quite I bit though, \"Hey Doc, who is the new boy?\" I asked Doc turned around and looked at the young boy \"His name is William Bonney, he got into a fight and John helped him out I guess.\" He turned around and looked at me again \"Gottcha something while we were out.\" \"You didn't have to get me anything.\" I stated \"I found it and I wanted to.\" He took from his coat a book and handed it to me \"Romeo and Juliet \" he knew how much I loved to read, I smiled and hugged him \"Thank you Doc, I love it.\" He hugged me back and said \"Your welcome Catori.\" \"Catori, can you set up a new spot at the table for tonight please, we will have a new guest.\" \"Of course John, I would be more than happy too.\" \"As long as it isn't another Mexican.\" Steve said Chavez shiot a glare at him \"Mexican Indian you son of a bitch.\" I had already started with supper and it wasn't a huge deal to double the recipe so that he can eat as well. I walked back into the house and started cooking again adding more to the dish for tonight \"Catori?\" \"Yes John.\" The older Englishman was like a father to me, he took me and Chavez in when we needed it the most, I was the only female that he took in and he didn't seem to mind having one female in the house that didn't mean that he took every female in, I cooked some, I cleaned, some days I even got out and was with the horses, while I was a lady some days I wanted to be free like I was meant to be. \"I hope you don't mind that we bring another young man into the group.\" \"No mind for me John, this is a simple recipe for me to add to and your doing a fine job with everyone even Steven is getting there.\" \"Indeed, if only I can clear that tobacco habit.\" I laughed at him \"I don't see that happening any time soon.\" I had set the book that Doc picked up for me and John happened to see it \"Doc was quite persistent in getting that book for you.\" I turned and looked at it \"He knows I love to read, I am glad that he bought it for me I haven't yet read Romeo and Juliet.\" \"It is a beautiful play I saw it back in England, however it is quite tragic.\" \"I do know how the book ends; it doesn't have to end tragically if you don't think of it as tragic.\" John smiled \"Someone who has had tragedy in her life and she still thinks of things in a romantic aspect.\" He stepped beside me at the stove \"Go out for a while get out of the house for a while and get some fresh air.\" I looked at him \"Really?\" \"Yes go…I shall finish here.\" I smiled \"Thank you.\" I dried my hands on a towel and took off my apron and stepped into the sun, It was a beautiful day, I panned around and saw the new boy William at the hog pin with his gun drawn on it, he was a handsome boy with blonde hair and blue eyes he had a tough disposition, he was young eighteen possibly, which made me older than he was. He caught a glimpse of me looking at him and that is when Chavez picked up three of his knife collection and threw them one by one by one, scaring the boy half to death, I leaned against the post and watched, Chavez had his moments, I walked over as Chavez was taking the knives out of the post and held out my hand \"Your names William right?\" I asked the boy He nodded \"My name is Catori, I am another one of Johns adoptions as it were.\" \"She is our only female regulator.\" I turned around and looked at Charlie, a shorter man with brown curly hair and a beard \"Hey Charlie I have been looking for you all day.\" I said Charlie looked at me \"Been with the horses and cattle all day.\" \"Oh okay.\" Chavez looked at me for a moment and I saw it, I stood next to him \"Well?\" \"Well what?\" He said looking down at me \"DO you think…\" \"No I don't think so.\" He didn't think he could make it, and I could tell that Chavez wasn't quite positive that we could trust him either, I could see it his eyes.\" \"Of course I am not a knife wielder like Chavez Chavez over there…I'm a pugilist, but I don't expect you to know the meaning of that word…HOG BOY.\" Charlie made it a point to scare the child half to death and the fact that he knew himself as a pugilist of course I had seen him box a couple of times. \"Shit you don't even know why I'm here.\" William said. \"Sure I do you're a wild and restless vagrant like the rest of us, what did you do? Steal some cattle? Rob a bank? Kill somebody?\" Right as Charlie said \"Kill somebody\" William turned his head with a smirk on his face and looked at Charlie, Charlie looked at him with some shock \"Kill somebody.\" He said William looked at him and nodded his head and smiled I looked at Chavez who was surprised as I was. This young boy had killed a man and he wasn't even twenty yet. Chavez stepped in front of me a little for protection. Hs back touched me he was hovering too close \"Catora go in the house.\" He said looking over his shoulder. \"But…\" \"No buts, go.\" His protective attitude had a tendency to drive me insane but I did what he told me and went inside the house and started to grab plates, glasses and silverware and started to set the table, I had already made a plate for myself in the kitchen, John made the rule that I ate before the men and I watched them while they ate. John let me sit down and eat and that night I watched Doc, Charlie, Steve, Richard Chavez, William and John eat there supper, \"Have you eaten?\" Richard asked me. I nodded \"Yes I ate before you guys, I am just here to clear the table.\" \"SO billy ya ever work the Hog before?\" Richard asked \"Yeah, worked for Kenny Maxwell.\" I heard Charlie murmur something I didn't hear \"congratulations Charles you and Steven will be doing the washing alone this evening, take the pressure away from Catori, she works her hardest.\" \"Sorry John just struck me funny.\" \"And to William both of you.\" Steven and Charlie looked at William Charlie gave a fake \"Sorry William we were just hacking on ya that's all.\" With a full mouth Steve said \"Yeah we were just hacking on ya.\" It went quiet for a moment before Richard said \"Rumor has it you killed a man Billy. You don't seem like the killing sort.\" \"Yeah Billy what ya kill him for.\" William with the straightest face in the world looked at him and said \"He was hacking on me.\" I turned around and covered my mouth to keep from laughing[Chapter 2] Chavez's Spirit Chapter 2 Okay Author Note: I write like five chapters before I submit them and it could take days to do it, so if you wonder why it takes so long that is why. I dont own Young guns I only Own Catori (There happy) Ohh Fun Fact: Catori is Hopi for Spirit (Hence the title) Right after dinner everyone was done with their supper and Charlie and Steve cleaned up the kitchen for me we moved everyone to the bunk house for the night John kept them at their reading, everyone was required to read a paragraph every night before bed, Doc and Richard sat at a small table, John sat in a rocking chair, and I sat in a char next to him with an Indian blanket with different colors wrapped around me, Chavez sat on the floor next to me. Charlie sat on the other side from Chavez, Steve was diagonally, William was in the corner in the back, I listened to Steve reading, correcting him \"Young men who will never secede.\" \"Succeed.\" I corrected \"Who will never succeed anywhere…\" \"Very good….William, why don't you read off.\" John said William snickered \"Yeah sure.\" \"I am sorry William I didn't mean to offend you, boys here have to learn to read and write so that they can make it in the world so pick up the journal or you can go back to your home on the street.\" I looked at John but I didn't say anything it was harsh but I wasn't going to say that. Billy ripped the paper out of Steve's hand and started to read \"Young man who don't know how to do any kind of business have no business being here, they are not wanted here and they are told to leave…\" I was surprised that a boy that young and a young renegade could read as well as he could he was a smart young man. At the end Billy folded up the paper and handed it to Steve, John smiled and stood up \"That was marvelous William, thank you.\" He walked over and ruffled Billy's hair. \"Catori don't be too long up only read a couple of pages tonight.\" I nodded from the rocking chair \"Alright, Good night John.\" Everyone looked at him and said good night to John \"Alright Catori what are you going to read tonight.\" Casey asked \"Doc just bought me Romeo and Juliet I thought I would read some of that tonight.\" I looked down to the book and started to read\" But to be frank and give it thee again. And yet I wish but for the thing I have. My bounty is as boundless as the sea, My love as deep. The more I give to thee, The more I have, for both are infinite. I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!\" \"That is strange English.\" \"It is old English Charlie.\" I explained reading some more again. I finished reading Act two and suddenly said goodnight \"I am getting tired tonight and I have a lot to do tomorrow, so gentlemen if you excuse me.\" I stood up and set the blanket on the chair Chavez stood up \"I will walk you back to the house.\" He picked the blanket up and wrapped it around my shoulders, \"It is cold out and you need to stay warm.\" Chavez walked me over to the main house with my blanket wrapped around me \"Are you okay?\" I asked looking at him, he seemed bothered by something. \"I just don't trust Billy, what he said bugged me.\" \"Chavez, I am sure he is alright, John would not have brought him here if he didn't trust him.\" \"But that is just it, John can be a little…more trusting than the rest of us.\" He had a point, I looked at the sky and tried to change the subject \"Do you remember when we were young? When the tribes met?' He looked at me with surprise and I continued My grandfather and your Grandfather smoked the piece pipe together even though they fought like wolves.\" Chavez couldn't help but crack a smile \"Yes I remember your brothers and my cousins would fight in the fields trying to knock each other off the horses.\" \"And you and I were stuck together.\" I said laughing \"Not that I have a problem with it turned out but it was like you and I were subject to getting teased, my grandmother saying that we were going…\" \"To Get married…I remember.\" He actually laughed finishing my sentence running a hand through his hair. I suddenly grew serious \"I am sorry that I couldn't get to your tribe faster to warn you.\" He looked down at me \"Chiquita there was nothing that you could have done. All that mattered to me was that you were safe.\" I smiled and ran a hand through my brown hair I had wished that my hair was darker like the Indians but the blond of my mother and the black hair of my father made me brunette. \"That still doesn't change anything, I couldn't help you.\" \"You helped me enough….Now it is time for you to go to bed.\" I agreed with him and took the blanket and handed it to him, he however didn't take it \"Keep it, I have my buffalo blanket, besides I know how much you love that blanket, think of it as a gift.\" He held my gaze with his dark eyes and smiled I returned it and thanked him. He turned around and walked back toward to the bunk house and I walked into the house into my room, smiling at the blanket as I set it on my bed. I got out of my dress and into bed wrapping myself up in my new blanket. The sound of the Rooster woke me up the next morning and with that the sound of hogs again, I got up and threw on one of my skirts a mans black button up shirt I found a barrette and put half of my hair up and my cowboys boots were on my feet, \"Good morning John.\" I said half asleep, John looked at me \"Good morning Catori, you look lovely today.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Can you get some eggs from the chickens?\" \"I would love to, I have to feed them anyway I will gather while they eat.\" It was a beautiful morning, so warm for a December, everyone was already up and doing whatever chores that they were meant to do. However something interrupted my morning, horses riding over the horizon. \"John!\" I called to the house, it was Murphy and the sheriff, and they were looking for trouble, Doc and Chavez stepped in front of me \"What do they want?\" I asked \"I don't know but it can't be good.\" Doc said. John stood at the head of the boys and waited for the sheriff to step down off of his horse \"Good morning sheriff.\" \"Mornin John, Mr. Murphy and Mr Dolan have been complaining that some of his horses has been captured and john they think your behind all of it.\" \"That is a fargin lie and you know it!\" Richard Barked \"Richard.\"John warned turning to the sheriff \"Sheriff Mr. Murphy is going to keep coming to you with complaints…I never touched his property\" Murphy stepped off of the horse \"WELL. The belted earl has spoken. All I see are hired thieve.\" John glared at him \"These boys are promising young men acquiring an education.\" Murphey snapped back like a bullet to a gun Well, I've had you pegged as the type that likes... educatin' young boys.\" The sudden sound of someone sneaking up behind me caught my attention but it was too late for me to stop him before I was grabbed at the wrist and twisted, I yelled out causing Chavez and Doc to turn around, I was dragged to the front in the middle of John and Murphy \" However the fact that Ya e manage to find yourself a little Indian whore Tunstall, who was she with last night? Your Indian boy, maybe the tobacco addict, I know you didn't.\" I fought to get away from Murphy and Chavez lost it \"Don't touch her!\" A loud crack echoed and my hand stung, however it was only a second before another crack rang out and I fell to the ground, my cheek swelled and my face stung, my ears started to ring. \"You're going to act like a whore than your going to be treated like one!\" \"It would be better than being Irish trash like you Murphy!\" I yelled out John took Murphy aside and said something that only I made out, the rest of the men stood behind me glaring at the other men across from them I have made a long, steamship journey from London, Mr. Murphy, so I shall be damned if I am persuaded by something as ugly as political corruption. So, I'd like for you to take your threats and your sheriff and get off my property.\" \"You'd be better selling ladies undergarments in Hamsted Tunstall, prepare for hell!\" Murphy got on his horse and his men rode off Chavez walked over and helped me off the ground \"Are you okay?\" I shook my head, tears were starting to sting my eyes my face hurt, he called me a whore I clung to his coat John looked at my face \"Get her inside then go back to work Chavez, thank you.\" John took a sudden look at the hog pin where a gun barrel was pointed Billy had been there all morning waiting for the right moment to strike at Murphy. Chavez helped me inside and set me down at the table moving my hair from my face, \"Hold still.\" I looked up at him and nodded, he took a wet cloth to my face, it was cold \"It will take down the swelling.\" \"I must look horrible.\" He looked me in the eyes \"I don't think so Chiquita.\" He whipped a tear from my cheek before I started crying again \"He called me a whore, an Indian Whore Chavez, how am I supposed to live with that.\" Chavez took hold of my shoulders and bent down to the ground so I looked at his eyes .\"Listen to me.\" He said sternly \"You are not an Indian whore, you have never done anything that a whore has ever done, what Murphy thinks he knows is wrong! Don't ever think something like that again.\" I looked at him and he kept his eyes locked on mine he was serious and I could see that \"Promise me that you will never say something like that again.\" I nodded \"I promise.\" \"Chavez.\" We were interrupted by John at the door way \"Thank you Chavez I can take it from here.\" Chavez stood up and looked at me whipping another tear from my cheek before leaving. That was what made me proud of being like a sister to him he always took care of me, and always said that to me.[Chapter 3] Chavez Spirit Chapter 3 It had been a couple of days since the incident with Murphy, and tonight was the night of New Years eve I was busy making my own dress which I had managed with a little extra pocket money that I had made working in Tunstal's store, John had been watching when there was a knocking at the door, I stopped sewing and John answered it \"Yes.\" \"Uh Mr Tunstal, I was wondering if you could get me a job, my name is Jay McClausky\" \"Your one of Murphy's boys arnt you?\" \"Used to be, he fired me, I called him a fat sow.\" The boys was laughing… I didn't get a look at him but I was pretty sure I didn't want to, John wasn't laughing at the joke \"The bunk house is that way, you can go stay there.\" John closed the door and I looked at him \"Are you sure you can trust him? \"No.\" was all he said \"I am going to take William into town, make sure that all them men are ready.\" \"Yes John.\" I set my needle down and looked at my dress, it was a lovely dress, I thought and I hoped that it looked lovely when I wore it, however my first chore before I focused on myself was to get the boys ready, John had put me in charge since he was out with Billy getting a new suit. I grabbed a basket that John had gathered some things up and put in there and walked over to the bunkhouse and up into the bedroom area walking in the door without knocking and all men started screaming at me running around trying to cover up and hide things causing me to laugh and blush, \"Well at least your all gentlemen enough to cover up in front of a lady.\" In the back Charlie bent down to pick up a blanket from his bed , Steve threw his hands down and his knees hit the floor, Doc raised his pants up, Chavez threw his buffalo hide blanket around his waist and Dick bolted behind a screen that I put up for decoration \"What the hell are you doing Catori?\" \"Oh relax Dick you haven't got anything I haven't seen you forget that I had three brothers.\" I looked at all of the boys \"Your not putting on your suits until you guys clean up, use soap!\" I warned throwing soap on the beds, I washed your suits already and I will lay them out while your bathing, don't make me watch you guys clean up either. John also put me in charge of making sure you got dressed right and that your well groomed so your all having a check.\" \"Are we in the army or something?\" Charlie asked making sure that he was extra covered up and I smirked \"No, your on my patrol though, everyone get to the bath house…please.\" I walked out and closed the door behind me, and that is when I let loose and was laughing my head off I covered my mouth to keep myself mildly quiet but it was just too funny that I couldn't help myself, I started walking back to the house, I had heard it was mean to laugh at a man when they were naked so I tried not to anymore. I had waited for the men to leave before I took up there suits and laid each of them on there beds, and I shined each of there shoes. \"They better appreciate this my Lord.\" I said to myself. \"Alright Gentlemen stand in line.\" I said All of them stood in front of me, they all looked good, I had to fix a couple of their collars, Steve I had to slick back his hair \"Now Steve if your going to spit tobacco do it away from the ladies and please lord not in the fire.\" I said the boys laughed and Steve nodded \"Thank you.\" I got to Chavez and he held out a leather strap I knew what he wanted I took out my comb and took a seat \"Sit in front of me.\" He did as I said and I combed his hair back \"You want it loose or tight.\" \"Tight.\" He replied. I held his hair and wrapped the leather around his raven black hair so it was tied back and neat, not a stray hair out of place \"You will make the girls in Lincoln swoon.\" I said. \"Who said I wanted them too.\" He said turning around and standing up. \"Alright since you guys are all groomed and done I am going to get ready, I will be right back…Don't play in the mud, don't get wet and for Goodness sake…\" \"Don't get into a fight.\" Doc called \"We Got it Catori, go.\" He pushed me into the house laughing. I ran up to my room and started to get ready I put my hair up halfway leaving some of the back hair down, then I threw my dress on fixing any creases in the dress, I took another look at my hair one more time, then went ahead and put on a pair of my best black boots. After I knew I was okay I took my walk downstairs to see John in his best suit \"Catori you look lovely, you did a wonderful job with that dress I smiled and thanked him \"You still can't get your coat clean can you? I teased taking a brush and running along the shoulders \"No I have been having a problem with dust.\" I ran the brush over it again when the sudden sound of gunfire erupted, \"Billy is fitting in nicely.\" I just replied John rolled his eyes and I set the brush down \"It will have to do, it is time to go.\" I said. John walked outside onto the porch \"Regulators!\" He held a deep tone as if he was made causing Billy to stop laughing and the rest of them to look at John. Messing with them John smiled and said \"Let's Dance.\" I stepped out behind John and everyone looked at me I didn't know whether to be proud or embarrassed until Charlie helped me into the carriage \"You look really pretty Catori.\" Charlie said \"Thank you.\" Doc nodded \"I agree with Charlie you look beautiful.\" \"Thank you Doc.\" Chavez got on his horse and rode up to the side of the carriage \"I agree with them you did a wonderful job.\" I beamed, I was truly proud of how nice I looked now that I had the confirmation of all of the men. There was a large bonfire that was started for New Years Eve. Billy had managed to get all of the girls attention and was able to dance with all of the girls he was interested in. Mcklausky, Steve and Charlie was watching \"He aint all there is he?\" Steve said \"You're not exactly there yourself Steven.\" I replied I still found entertainment that Billy knew how to dance, when he caught sight of me he walked over \"Catori will you dance with me?\" I smiled at him \"You already have about twelve women on one arm Billy what in the world are you going to do with me?\" \"I just want one dance.\" Billy said smiling at me causing me to laugh \"Alright but just one.\" I took my hand in his and we both danced together, in a circle around the bonfire it was a sight for everyone to see, Billy and I had been laughing until the song was over, Billy took a bow and I curtseyed \"Alright you danced with me now go and make the other young girls swoon.\" I teased Billy smiled and ran off in search for another girl and I was left laughing at the boy, \"Here.\" I whipped around and looked at Chavez he handed me a cup of coffee, I took it and thanked him, he took a seat next to me and we talked I noticed that Doc was dancing with a young woman, she was of different ethnicity, she was Chinese, a lovely looking young woman, Chavez noticed and looked at them \"I have never seen him so set on dancing with the girl.\" I replied \"that is quite romantic.\" John spotted the two of us and walked up \"Are you two enjoying yourselves?\" \"Yes, we are more enjoying Doc dance with a pretty young girl than anything.\" I replied. John smiled he was with another man a man with brown hair \"Yes I saw it too. Catori, Chavez, this is Pat Garret he is new in town and I just met him myself.\" He bent down and whispered something in Chavez' ear while I shook Mr. Garretts hand \"Nice to meet you Mr Garrett, I saw you with Billy a moment ago.\" \"Yes he is quite the...energetic one.\" \"You can say that again sir, he is very nice though.\" Mr. Garrett nodded \"Well excuse us, the lady and I are going to have a dance.\" \"Aright, nice to meet you again Mr. Garrett.\" \"Please call me Pat, and you as well.\" I looked at John \"How did you meet him?\" \"He is part of the trading, oh will you to excuse me for a moment.\" Was all he said and walked away \"what was that all about?\" I asked Chavez stood up \"Dance with me?\" The light flickered in my head \"Alright, I guess there is no harm done there.\" I stood up and took his hand and set my right hand on his shoulder, I was comfortable, until someone started another fight with John. Chavez and I both stopped and looked at the man who was trying to start a fight, he was drunk, he was also one of Murphy's men \"Come on old man you and me.\" Just when I thought John was going to have to get into something we could finish Charlie stepped forward \"No, no no no, It's you and I…Isn't that right john you and I?\" John looked at the drunken man \"Yes it is.\" Charlie puffed his chest out and poked him in the shoulder \"You and I.\" Chavez and I watched and we were soon joined by Doc and Dick, soon after Billy joined us. Charlie threw the first punch at the man who was larger than he was, the man threw a punch but Charlie dodged out of the way and punched him in the side soon after his drunken stupor the man was knocked out and hit the table where cards were being played, I looked at Billy. He returned my glance \"Pugilist.\" \"He's something aint he?\" Doc said. John handed Charlie's coat back to Charlie and a firecracker went off, \"Happy NEW YEAR!\" someone in the crowd yelled and fired a shot in the air, everyone jumped but soon joined the fun firing the guns in the air and yelling happy new year, laughing and joking. It was a good night…but it was soon going to turn bad.[Chapter 4] Chavez's Spirit 4 The new Year's party was over and everyone wanted to go home. Everyone wanted to sing Auld Lang Synn we were cutting up and having fun, In the distance there was a while bird that was flying away and the boys wanted to chase it, I hopped on the back of Chavez's horse and rode down the hill with him. Billy was going to stay near the carriage but John told him to act like a boy for a change. As we rode down the hill I saw more movement at the corner of my eye, I whipped around on the back of the horse and saw men surrounding the carriage where John was sitting, I covered my mouth and almost let out a shriek and gunfire erupted upsetting the horses and throwing John from the carriage \"Oh my God!\" Chavez turned around and looked and where I was looking, the men turned and looked at us causing Chavez, Charlie, Steve,, Mcklausky and Dick to make the horses run. Billy was enraged and went to fire on the men \"Don't! There is too many of them!\" Doc said stopping him. The only man that had protected us from everyone else, the man that was like a father to us was dead. The sheriff looked at us first as the people who killed him but Alex McSween, John's lawyer and best friend soon cleared us of our so called guilt \"They loved him like a father, why would they do that to him?\" It took Chavez, Doc and Dick three hours to get me calmed down again, I was screaming and crying. When I finally did I went on with cooking the supper, Billy sat at the table and told all of them what he wanted to do \"Murphy is going to Reap all he did, I am going to kill him.\" \"Wait until after the funeral.\" I stated doing all but throwing the plate on the table, I was cold, I didn't mean to be but I did. \"You don't want to get back at them for what they did to John?\" \"Not now, right now is a time to mourn. And I am going to do that much.\" \"And after that?\" \"I haven't decided yet.\" All of the boys turned and looked at me with shock in there eyes, I didn't want to answer them I was trying to be honest with myself, I wasn't sure that I wanted to even go with them. I turned around and left them at the table and walked up to my room. I sat down on my bed and cried. I heard a knock at the door, I quickly rubbed my eyes and opened the door. The door opened and Chavez walked in \"Catori?\" I looked up at Chavez and rubbed my eyes \"Hey…I am sorry about that.\" He pulled up the chair in front of me \"What did you say about not coming with us?\" \"Yeah, I don't know if I want to kill people, I already did it once I don't know if I could do it again. I was thinking about going to Colorado, just to stay until this war is over.\" Chavez looked at me \"I am sorry.\" He sighed \"It isn't your fault, and don't apologize to me, I know.\" He was surprised in what I did next but I felt that I really needed to do it, I leaned in and wrapped my arms around him, he was silent for a moment then he wrapped his arms around me in return. The morning of the funeral I was in my best black dress, my hair draped over my face, my eyes were covered by a veil, it was sad to know that we were burying a man that cared about us. I didn't make the decision if I was going to Colorado or not, I didn't want to leave the people that I cared about, but yet I didn't want to get involved with Billy and what he wanted to do. After sighing for one more time I walked out of my room and down the stairs to see the boys piled down stairs waiting for me, they were all quiet back in their suits from New Years Eve, except this wasn't a party, \"Catori your going to be riding your own horse this time.\" Doc said He had managed to get me a horse from Murphy's lot, it was a small revenge but it would do for now, it was a beautiful brown appaloosa with white on the rump and brown spots. I pet the muzzle \"Thank you Doc.\" I said hugging him, he returned it, then helped me up on the horse so that I could ride side saddle. Toward the funeral. \"Dear heavenly Father we pray that you watch over this man as we lay him to rest…\" That was the prayer at John's funeral, Dick was able to read it I kept my head bowed, as I listened to Dick read the prayer, in the back I heard Alex McSween talking to one of the men at the funeral \"Are you going to go after these men?\" \"Most of them that I cant touch were officers of the law and they were hired my Murphy.\" Alex was quiet \"Deputize the boys.\" \"What? No all of those boys are not over twenty one they are going to get themselves killed.\" \"They are the best gunmen…\" Everyone was now looking at McSween and the man the boys were even curious \"Fine, I will deputize them, but you fallow the law and you don't do anything stupid.\" The boys each nodded and was sworn in. I looked at Alex \"I don't know if I want to do that….\" Chavez already spoke for me \"I don't want you to come with us.\" I looked at him with some surprise \"You don't?\" \"No, want you to get out of here away from this town and go up to Colorado.\" I looked at him \"But…\" He looked at me \"No Catori, go to Colorado, I will come for you after its over, it is dangerous down here, you can make a life in Colorado then do it.\" \"What about you.\" \"I will be here.\" I looked at the boys \"I guess my mind was made up for me then, I am not going with you boys.\" Doc understood and even Dick understood \"This isn't the kind of job for a woman to do.\" \"You just remember something Dick I can do anything a boy can do.\" I said smiling hugging each one of them, when I got to Billy I whispered in his ear \"Reap them.\" He nodded, The last man that I saw was Chavez, I hugged him \"Goodbye my friend, my brother…\" \"Bye.\" He whispered, I reached up and kissed his cheek \"Be careful.\" It was the first time I had ever kissed his cheek and I left him in shock but I managed it, I got on the horse and started riding north. I had my money, and I had some water, I had a stolen horse that I am sure Murphy saw as I was leaving town, I would need some clothes. I reared the horse and made him stand up and waved to the boys one more time \"RECULATORS!\" and I made the horse take off at a dead run not looking back. I had traveled for a couple of days and nights with out stopping, I rested a couple of times when I could but I didn't sleep. Nightfall set on the third night of me traveling when I hit a town, no one in the town would let me in there were no hotels, the town was extremely small so no one built a hotel, even the church would allow me in, the only place I had managed to get into was a little whorehouse, the girls were happy to let me in and give me shelter, the woman who ran it was an older woman with her hair dyed red her name was Scarlett \"You look tired my dear, try this it will warm the spirits.\" She handed me a cup of coffee with a shot of whiskey and I gulped it down. \"Thank you.\" \"Where ya headen honey?\" \"Colorado.\" \"Really now that is a long way to go.\" \"I am sure it is, but it will get me away from what is going on in Lincoln.\" \"Your quite away from there too.\" I smiled \"No offence but I am not exactly material to have a job here.\" \"Oh no honey I didn't mean that…I mean that you can get away from it all here…what exactly is in Lincoln, old love.\" I almost choked on my coffee \"No…No, a friend of mine was killed and the rest of my friends are going after the men that killed him.\" \"Really…and I thought a stupid boy broke your heart.\" 'Well that kind of happened too.' I thought taking a sip \"I was torn between helping them and going and one of them told me to go.\" \"Do you think you made the right decision?\" That I couldn't answer for her, I looked down at my coffee, and Scarlett seemed to understand what I meant, she took my hand in hers \"Tell ya what sweetie, you stay here for a while, we have a room in the attic for hiding fugitives, you stay in that room and you think about it, then if you think you made the right choice go up to Colorado, if not, go back to Lincoln.\" \"I don't have a lot of money…\" \"Don't worry about it, you cook meals for the girls and you can stay.\" \"Alright it's a deal.\" Third POV Nothing was really the same without Catori, she was the light of their lives, Doc found her like a little sister, Dick was just fond of her period, Charlie and Steve were entertained by her card games, she could shuffle like a dealer, Billy liked riding contests with her, but the one that was most affected by her leaving, was Chavez, he was on his own a lot his eyes had the look of regret and everyone could see that, \"Why did you let her go Chavez?\" Doc said Chavez looked at his blonde friend \"I didn't want her to get hurt.\" \"But you're a wreck without her, look at you.\" Doc replied \"Like you think of the little China girl.\" Chavez murmured \"Yeah I know, I regret it but I cant help it now.\" \"You'll see her again, we all will.\"[Chapter 5] Chavez Spirit 5 I had woken up from a good nights sleep for a change and the girls of the house had managed to make me a proper breakfast \"this is quite the transition I am used to being around nothing but boys, now I am staying at a house of nothing but girls this is going to be kind of hard to get used to.\" Scarlett smiled \"Well just until you get your thoughts straight, and I am sure that you will get them straightened out soon.\" I took a seat at the table and was berated with questions \"What is your name?\" A black haired woman with blue eyes asked \"Catori New Eagle.\" \"Are you Indian?' She asked \"Half, my father was Indian and my mother was white.\" \"You don't look it.\" \"That is because I got my looks from my mom, her hair was blonde so the black of my fathers hair and my mothers hair gives mine a brown tint. I am though it says on my birth certificate.\" \"That is a really big knife…\" One of the younger girls said \"yeah I learned how to use it when I was younger.\" \"Now girls enough questions, she Is hungry let her eat.\" Scarlett interrupted them and let me eat, I mentally thanked her and took a bite \"This is very good thank you very much for the meal.\" The girls beamed at my compliment and went to eat themselves \"So what may I ask is in Colorado?\" Scarlett asked \"I have some family, my mothers side loved it there and they are miners looking for silver.\" \"From what I understand your friends didn't want you to go.\" \"I didn't want to leave them.\" I replied \"But whatever they say goes.\" \"You must tell us about them some time.\" I smiled \"I would love to, they are the lights of my life and I am proud of them.\" Scarlett smiled in return \"Well since your going to be staying a while I do have some requests, that you keep house and that you cook for the girls, it isn't much just make beds and dust.\" \"That Is less than my normal chores, I would be happy to work here for a while.\" It had been another couple of days of me staying at the whorehouse for me to think, I had to take on some transitions, I worked on my gun aim and my knife aim just in case. The girls were really sweet and a couple of them I became friends with, they would all ask me about life with the regulators and I said that it was hard to explain, it was kind of like being with brothers all the time. I always told them about Chavez who had been my best friend \"What is he like he sound amazing?\" One of the girls Kat asked \"He is a Mexican Indian, he is good with Knives, he is kind of quiet but he is handsome and he was always protective of me, we met when we were kids on the reservation our grandfathers would smoke the Pease pipe even thought they fought like Dogs, Our mothers would cook together.\" \"What does he look like?\" Another one by the name of Amanda asked me. \"He has long black hair and brown eyes, and he looks like what a Mexican Indian would look like.\" I replied Scarlett looked at me \"It seems you are quite taken by him.\" I coughed \"Chavez? Well I don't know about that, we have been friends forever and it is so much like a brother and sister relationship, I don't think that it would happen ya know.\" \"What about Billy what is he like.\" \"Now that I can answer, he is a hyper active kid younger than I am, he is good with a gun, and he is quite the ladies man a handsome kid, I wouldn't be able to handle a kid like that though.\" \"And Doc?\" \"Oh he is a ladies man, a handsome man who is a poet, a true romantic in itself, everyone picks on him but I love to hear the poems. Lets see. Charlie is a pugilist. You know like a boxer? He is really shy but really sweet and nice sometimes I believe he wouldn't hurt a fly. Dick is a quiet God type…and the leader, he always makes sure we keep the lord in our heart always.…Steve is a tobacco junkie and likes the mud.\" I was wrapped in my blanket that Chavez gave me, when they packed up the horse they all packed me with a blanket, water, food, some money, and that was all, they didn't pack another set of cloths, I rolled my eyes when I found out. \"Where did that blanket come from?\" I touched the outside \"Chavez gave it to me before John died.\" \"That is so lovely.\" One of the girls swooned causing me to laugh. Just then a sudden knock at the front door caused me to jump, Scarlett rushed me and the rest of the girls up the stairs everyone in the house hid me when the law wanted to know where I was when it came to the stolen Murphy horse. \"Oh my god it is a stolen horse get over it.\" I said quietly, however this time was a different question \"Catori New Eagle is wanted for questioning as regards to Billy the Kid and the Regulators they knew each other and she even said she was one.\" \"I keep telling you we don't have anyone of her description leave us alone.\" Scarlett slammed the door again and sighed \"Alright you can come down.\" Everyone returned to there seat I was however worried about the boys causing Scarlett to ask me If I knew what I was going to do, and I answered, just like everyday I would tell her I didn't know yet… It was three days when I finally had my answer. I was reading the newspaper about a young outlaw named \"Billy the Kid\" or \" Chivato\" and his friends, and they were all wanted for killing two Murphy- Dolan men, Morton and Baker, he also killed Mcklausky, a couple of days before, Billy killed Henry Hill, and a female was also wanted for horse thieving. The newest recruit to come and get them was Buckshot Roberts, he was known to kill more men than small pocks and now they were after the boys…My boys… I dropped the paper \"Scarlett!\" I called through the house. Scarlett came down the stairs in a little panic \"What? What is it dear?\" I looked at her \"I made my decision…\" Third POV \"Hey guys did you see the size of that chicken!\" Dirty Steve Stevens had managed to yell in a deep voice for his, after a night of peyote (Compliments to Chavez himself) they were all a little messed up \"You guys! You guys!\" Steve cried out again, Charlie threw up something that looked terrible, Chavez had drawn on his face with ash and a stick to look like he had black and white like a ghost, Billy was on the ground because of falling backward, Doc was reciting some of his own poetry in slow motion, and Dick…well Dick didn't take Peyote so he was fine…kinda, he was concerned about the effects the drug had. They all got on there horses and rode through what they called \"The spirit World\" when really they were going through an old village of Indians \"Hey Chavez how come they aint killing us?\" Charlie asked \"Cause we're in the spirit world asshole they cant see us.\" Steve replied Billy who had been riding the horse backwards had nodded to the Indian man and said \"Hey did you know we're in the spirit world?\" and let out a cackle, Dick just tipped his hat. The Indians understood what was going on but watched them walk through. A watering hole outside of the Indian village was a perfect place for them to cool off and get some water, it was in a dip behind a hill the horses were hidden behind another hill away from them, the drug was starting to wear off after a long nap and a bath, the boys were all sitting around a campfire that night \"We don't talk about this to anyone.\" Doc made everyone promise, not like the Indians would ever talk about it. Everyone agreed that they would never talk about taking Peyote again and everything went quiet again. Chavez went back off into his own world thinking about the vision that he had trying to put it all together. Billy was laughing about the moment, Cackling about the incident of Charlie falling off of his horse halfway out of the village \"I still cant believe they didn't kill us.\" \"We were in the spirit world they couldn't kill us even if they saw us.\" Steve replied. Dick rolled his eyes \"They saw you shitheads, I was the one sober.\" \"Then they only saw you.\" Steve replied \"Wait shhh…\" Doc said Billy cackled again \"What now Doc.\" \"Shut up…I heard something… it sounds like…horse shoes.\" All of them cocked there guns and hid behind the rift and hid for a moment and waited for the horse to stop. A person hopped off the horse, he was alone everyone could tell that. The person walked over to the edge where the boys were hiding and that is when they aimed their guns \"Who the hell are you?\" Billy asked. Doc aimed at the person in the long black coat, he wore blue pants, brown pointed boots under the coat and a white straw hat a bandana across the persons face the person put his hands up in the air in surrender. \"Take off the outfit and show yourself.\" Doc said The person did as told and took the coat off and threw it down, then the hat and the brown hair was let down, finally the bandanna was removed \"I can honestly say without a reasonable doubt that you guys have got some major hell on your asses.\"[Chapter 6] Chavez Spirit 6 It was a shocker seeing all of them, most of them looked tired, as if they hadn't slept in days. They looked even more surprised to see me, it wasn't like I had died I was just running to Colorado. I threw my duster on the horse and moved him back over to where the rest were, all of the boys were still in shock \"When…\" Doc asked putting his gun away. \"A couple of days ago, I didn't catch up until tonight but still, it was quite a ride to get to you.\" I stepped down into the hole near the campfire, all of them looked over my new change, I went from a dress to a pair of mans boot cut pants and a black button up shirt with a white shirt underneath I had my hair pulled back halfway now, I covered my head with a straw hat but that was off now, I wore a black bandanna around my face during dust storms, and last but not least I managed to steal a rifle, and gun belt for my gun. \"What? I don't get a hi, bye, nothing?\" I stood up from the fire and that is when they all at one time jumped for me, wrapping there arms around me and hugging me, my brothers, my friends I laughed at every one of them. \"What are you doing here anyway?\" Dick asked me looking me over to see if I was okay. \"I heard in the newspaper about a young Civato and his friends killing Murphy-Dolan men, the killing off Morton and Baker…Nice work.\" I said to Billy Doc took off up the hill for a moment in excitement I went on with questions that the boys gave. \"Where did you go?\" Steve asked me I laughed \"I..uh.. Ended up staying at a whore house, fifty miles from the state line to Colorado.\" I rubbed the back of my neck, and the boys eyes all went wide \"The woman that owned the place gave me a place to stay in the attic, I was fed and taken care of, hid from the law and such…\" Realizing that someone was missing I was going to ask. Hey..where is…\" \"Right here.\" Doc said as if reading my mind, he had been the only one I haven't seen yet, he was surprised to see me his eyes sparked as I stood up \"Hello Chavez.\" Chavez walked up and wrapped his arms around me hugging me \"He was worried about you he isn't going to admit it though.\" Steve said \"I can tell…Uh Chavez… I cant breathe.\" He loosened up \"Are you okay?\" \"I am fine, tired, but fine.\" I smelled something on his skin…it didn't smell right but I didn't ask. He pulled away from me and looked at me \"I know that I am not in the usual attire but..\" \"You look fine, you would be more comfortable in that anyway.\" Charlie said Billy was out of the loop \"What can she do?\" Everyone turned and looked at him, even I was a little shell shocked \"Can she do anything? I mean besides cook and clean.\" I smirked \"You wanna know if I can shoot a gun, throw a knife, punch someone?\" I walked over to him and showed him my knuckles, \"See that? I cracked them open on a man twice my size, he was trying to get a hold of me after I left the town I was staying in, knocked him out punching him as hard as I could, these cloths that I am wearing? Stole them from a store outside of Jicarilla, same with the gun and the bullets.\" \"But what about shooting them?\" \"Don't test her Chivato.\" Chavez stated \"She is a lot stronger than she looks.\" \"Than I want to see it.\" Chavez went to say something else but I stopped him. \"No Chavez the boy is right he wants to know then I will show him what I can do.\" I whipped around taking my gun from the holster and firing six shots at the arm of the cactus causing it to fall off, then took my knife and threw it where a man's heart would be, within five seconds I was done. I turned and looked at him \"I have killed before Billy, don't ever think I haven't, you don't have a clue about who I was then.\" \"Looks like The Spirit is back Chavez.\" Doc said Chavez sighed \"I was afraid of that.\" He looked at me one more time his eyes were darker than normal he knew that my past had come back to me and my skills had reappeared, that didn't mean that he was fond of it. \"So…What's new with you guys?\" I asked taking a seat \"Well We killed Henry Hill, Morton and Baker, and Mclausky.\" \"Yeah…why him?\" \"He was a spy for Murphy.\" \"Ah well I guess all the more the reason.\" Chavez sat next to me and took my hand that my knuckles were cracked open and started to clean them \"Ahh Easy!\" I said jumping at the feel of liquid on my knuckles \"When was the last time you cleaned this out?\" I looked at him \"I was…busy.\" \"Chiquita.\" That was the only time I had ever heard that word come in a scold \"Are you scolding me?\" I asked trying to get my hand away but he wouldn't let go, he had a strong grip on my hand he just glared up at me and said \"Yes I am, you know better.\" I rolled my eyes \"Anyway, so what is next, I heard that Buckshot Roberts is on his way, that was the reason I came down here.\" They seemed out of the loop \"Are you serious?\" Charlie said \"You guys didn't know?\" \"No we have been too busy trying to get ride of a Peyote hangover.\" I Turned slowly and glowered at Chavez \"You were scolding me…and yet your making Peyote...\" He didn't even look at me that time he just continued to wrap up my hand, \"I thought all of you would have better sense.\" I said \"Enough…what about Buckshot Roberts?\" \"He said that he was after \"The Kid\" So I reared my horse and took of toward Lincoln, I was shot at, but Alex had me sworn in at the last minute to help you guys, apparently he knew something that I didn't, I didn't even know that woman could be part o the law.\" I had my badge over the pocket of my shirt and everyone saw it. Chavez let my hand go \"Keep it wrapped.\" He said as if I was a child, and in my own little child like manner I said \"But, but…if I keep it wrapped then it wont get infected then I wont have anything to complain about.\" \"That couple of days away from us has really changed you.\" Doc said I smirked \"Maybe that is a good thing I never was fond of wearing dresses and riding side saddle.\" Everyone looked at me \"I am still the proper one just not the…girl I was.\" I stood up \"I better get that knife out of the cactus before I forget it, and get my bedroll, I haven't slept since I found out who was after you guys…and uh..\" I turned and looked at them \"No more Peyote.\" I looked at Chavez \"Especially you.\" I walked over to my horse and gathered my blanket and took the saddle off. I pet the nose and thanked the horse for his work \"You've done a good job.\" \"Talking to horses again?\" I turned around and looked at Chavez \"What can I say something's don't change.\" He took the saddle out of my hands \"I am happy that your back, it surprised me.\" \"Yeah I can see how me in a pair of pants can be a shocker. I just…I couldn't let you all do this by yourself, and well that other part of me that people wanted me to hide, came out and told me to go…or maybe that was the girls at the whore house.\" \"That is another thing…\" \"That is a long story that I don't want to get into right now Chavez trust me.\" I said laughing a little bit \"All I will say was that If you ever want answers… hide in the attic of a whore house.\" He set my saddle down next to his and I laid my blanket out and at one time every one started to fall asleep, it wasn't the hardest thing for me to do, it was a long day, the next day I was going to be hungry. \"So I want to hear about this little trip with the Peyote what happened.\" I said loading up the saddle, I asked Dick cause I knew that he didn't have any \"What were they like.\" \"It was like everything was in slow motion for them.\" \"Are you serious? That is funny…well not ha ha funny.\" \"Chavez said something about being lost and he needed to have a vision to see where he was going.\" \"Well to some native people that works.\" \"What about your people?\" \"The Souix? I don't think Peyote is the answer.\" \"Anyway we went through an Indian Village and they didn't hurt us, they were actually just staring at us.\" \"That is because they knew that all of you were drugged, except you.\" \"Steve saw a chicken.\" I burst out laughing at one point \"A chicken?\" \"Yeah he seemed scared by it too.\" \"I think we should have chicken to eat…. See what happens.\" A couple hours later we rode until we found a house to hide in making some food up Steve took out a chicken leg and some liquor and stepped outside Charlie had put him in charge of waiting for people. And we sat down to eat Bowing our head for prayer \"Dear heavenly father we thank you for the meal that we are about to accept at the table and lord forgive us for the sins that we have committed…\" I heard a fork pick up and drop when Dick started to talk again \"Jesus Dick its getting cold.\" Guns were drawn \"I could of killed ya Dick, I could of killed ya, but I don't wanna kill ya I wanna eat.\" \"Ater this meal we will go out and see who runs this gang you little insect.\" \"Billy, Dick put your guns away.\" I said although they didn't \"Dick can you pass the gravy please? Chavez, Charlie and I looked at Doc at the same time. All of a sudden the door flew open and Steve bolted inside \"It's Buckshot Roberts.\" I stood up \"Alright, enough we all want to see the alpha male of the group this is the time, he has killed more people than small pocks, he is extremely good, now stop.\"[Chapter 7] Chavez Spirit Chapter 7 I couldn't believe that shortly after I made it that Buckshot Roberts had made it to us, he was on a mule, all of us stood around and looked at the old man \"This guy has got to be older than dirt.\" I whispered causing Charlie to snicker. \"We have a warrant for you.\" Dick said \"I have got no business for that warrant anymore piece of shit anyway; I am here to get my reward for \"The Kid.\" The rest of you little shits is only worth a hundred but I'll take it, hell even you girl is worth enough…\" \"Didn't realize I was worth anything.\" I replied. \"Yeah your worth fifty hell I'll take it.\" He cocked the shot gun \"Well…Lets Dance.\" All of us bolted backwards and took shelter behind a couple wood piles, he took fire and I heard the sound of a bullet hitting skin it was a pounding sound that wouldn't get out of my head, Chavez hit the ground and yelled out in pain, he was hit in the arm. Another shot was fired and Doc, who had been standing right next to me hit the ground, his hand was bleeding, \"Agg SHIT!\" \"Doc!\" \"Get Chavez!\" He called to me, I did as he said and grabbed his hand when another shot was fired, I practically dragged Chavez behind the wood pile, he was quiet for a minute \"Chavez!\" Doc called practically in his ear \"What!\" I practically laughed with happiness that my friend wasn't dead \"Come on I have to get this arm wrapped up.\" \"You've been hit.\" A sudden stinging shot down my leg, looking down at my leg I saw a slight graze on my thigh it wasn't anything I couldn't handle but it stung. It's just a graze I am fine.\" He took my forearm \"Don't…\" I looked at him \"You think I am going to let you bleed to death I don't think so.\" He let go of me and I ripped the bandanna off my neck wrapping it tightly around his leg \"Lucky for you the bullet went through.\" I said checking under his arm. \"Billy he's going into the shitter.\" Billy got up and started to walk over to the bathroom I took my attention away from Chavez am and back up to the bathroom where Buckshot stood the door to the outhouse burst open and shots were fired, Billy hit the ground and crawled back behind the wood pile \"Screw that!\" I cocked the gun and took two shots and everyone fired with me \"I can get a better shot with a rifle. Steve!\" \"What?\" \"You got that Shot gun?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Give it to me.\" He did as I said and threw the shot gun towared me, I set the barrel on the wood pile taking aim, waiting for the door to open again \"Come on you sonuva…\" The door flew open and I took my shot causing Charlie to fire, I made a good hole in the door, however Charlie got a good shot of him into the gut, the door closed and all went quiet for a minute \"Hey Buckshot Ya dead?\" I asked There was no answer of course it was kind of a stupid answer for me to ask anyway, Dick stood up and started to walk over to the outhouse \"Dick, don't, something isn't right.\" I said standing I was right, the door slammed open and shots were fired again and in the sudden instant Dick was shot twice in the stomach hitting the ground he was dead. I grabbed a knife and threw it into the crease of the door pinning him inside, however I couldn't save Dick. \"Oh my God!\" Charlie started firing and running toward him but Doc stopped him \"Don't, its too late!\" Billy took over as leader and yelled \"Regulators saddle up!\" I helped Chavez off of the ground and supported him on his wounded side trying to get him to his horse as fast as possible; he yelled when I did get him on the horse and smacked the back end. I got on my horse and looked at Doc \"Come On Doc now is not the time to over think this!\" Doc was soon right behind me on his horse, as we took off. \"This place is going to be crawling with Murphy men get the hell out of here!\" We took off as fast as we cold away, however it was like we were lost, Dick was the foreman of the regulators, every so often during our walk we would turn the horses as if we were hopeful Dick would come back. We found a spot to make a camping circle and stay for the night, Doc stayed on his horse \"Where are ya going Doc?\" Billy asked \"I am going into a town write Dicks mother, get some wraps for this.\" He said holding up his hand to show his bloody hand. \"Whatever you do don't go near Lincoln.\" Billy stated. I got up out of the hole and walked over to the horse \"Your thinking about that little China girl aren't you?\" He looked down at me and nodded. I smiled at him \"Love cant be stopped, go to Lincoln and go and see her, don't listen to Billy, and if you can help it…Get out of here.\" I whispered. Doc looked at me and nodded. He took off until I couldn't see him. 'In love with the China girl. I am proud of the man.' I walked back into the hole and Charlie and a started to build a fire, Chavez went up the hill and stood behind the fire I looked up at him wrapped up in Buffalo skin he didn't look good, like he was sick, Billy was messing with a gun and Steve was sitting behind him stuffing his face with tobacco \"What are you doing Billy?\" \"Well… I am figuring out a plan to take the Murphy men.\" He drew his pistol and shot at the hill where Chavez was standing, it didn't faze him, he just turned and looked over his shoulder \"We cant go back to Lincoln.\" \"Why?\" Billy asked \"I don't know what your vision told you but my vision said go west.\" It was the Peyote, the only part of his heritage that I didn't care for, like mine was any better than his. \"West huh? Well west is that way.\" Billy pointed his gun toward the west \"And the bastards we gotta kill, are that way.\" Billy then flipped the gun to the other direction. \"The only bastards that are going to get killed are us Chivato let it go.\" \"Let it go, Murphy's taking ownership in Tunstall's store right now and your saying that means nothing to you?\" Billy said frustrated, I stood up \"I don't think you realize what you just said kid.\" I said watching Chavez turn to look down on the boy \"It means nothing to me? Murphy has taken more blood from me than what he ever will from you.\" \"Oh yeah how do ya figure?\" \"The Red Sand creek reservation.\" Chavez's eyes turned dark the smoke rose against his face giving him a darker look. Billy turned and looked at Steve and Charlie \"What the hell is he talking about?\" Charlie and Steve both shrugged and turned to look at me then, causing Billy to look at me \"What is he talking about.\" I didn't have to look at Chavez \"The Navajo, his mothers people, and My fathers people the souix.\" I said quietly sitting down running a hand through my hair \"Two years ago.\" Chavez took over knowing that I didn't want to explain it anymore \"Murphy's men were supported by the federal government to take care of us and keep us fed but all they gave was rotten meat, no corn, no flower only rancid meat crawling with worms, I ran out with a band of my people to see if we could trade with them, Oh yeah they let us in, then they opened fire killing all of them, I managed to get away, when I made it home I found at that Murphy's men already heard of the attack and my people were killed, My mother was cut from her privates to her neck, my sisters were just babies and they had there heads bashed in by boot heels so that the army could save bullets! I only managed to find one survivor and she was almost dead when I found her, my best friend had almost been raped and it means nothing to me?\" The memory shot through me like a bullet to my heart and my brain, tears started to sting me, but I didn't let anyone show it, Chavez found me in a field with my shirt almost ripped open I had a large stab wound in my stomach they didn't rape me they didn't want to take any chances, he saved my life that night. \"Yeah I went to take lives, but that is when John Tunstall took Catori and I in, so to say that it means nothing to me Chivato… You wouldn't understand.\" He walked over to the horse and started to saddle up \"Catori…are you coming with me?\" He asked He knew that I would go with him everywhere he went and I walked over to get on the horse \"How about you Charlie?\" \"I have to stay and watch Dirty Steve.\" \"That's right, ya see Steve knows the meaning of the word pals, see once you have a pack of us together you got yourself a tribe, when you break us up you break our sacred hoop.\" I turned to glare at the young kid and that is when I snapped, I walked over and a loud crack echoed, Charlie and Steve looked shocked, even Chavez was surprised in what I had done, I would have never done something like that, Billy had a handprint showing in the side of his face \"I have had enough Billy! You never use the words of the people against me or him! You know nothing about a tribe, what you have is not a tribe! It is a plague!\" Chavez walked over and grabbed me behind the waist pulling me away before I did something I would regret later, I fought but in the end he got the better of me. Billy was still looking at me when I was drug away. Chavez walked me down away from him and I glared \"He is going to be the end of us Chavez, he is going to get us killed, are you willing to loose your life because of a kid that is no older than eighteen?\" \"No Chiquita! But at the same time he is right, Charlie, Doc and Steve are the only ones that we have left.\"[Chapter 8] Chavez Spirit 8 \"Once upon a midnight dreary as I ponder weep and weary there came a knocking at my…back porch…not very original.\" A work from Edgar Allan Poe, except it was Doc's version, it was the only thing we did have to read, even though I never condoned going through anyone's things I did find this very entertaining. \"Give him credit for trying.\" I said Chavez had me cool down and I had my apologies with Billy (Even though that was the last thing I wanted to do, he was a brat but even then he was a friend) He did manage to forgive me \"Hey all girls gotta blow some steam I would rather you done that than shoot me.\" Now all of us lay on bedrolls near the fire trying to keep warm, it was freezing that night and Doc still hadn't come back \"You think he is going to make it back? Charlie asked \"I don't know if he will make it tonight.\" I said 'If he comes back at all.' I thought to myself. \"What if he took off?\" Charlie asked \"Naw, Doc likes me.\" Billy said Something in my head echoed that Doc was saying someplace \"I cant stand him.\" causing me to smirk. \"This is going to be a long night… I am going to try to get some sleep.\" I laid down on the cold ground and wrapped myself up in a blanket again, feeling some of the fire burning, it still wasn't much but it was better than nothing. The boys soon fallowed me in going to sleep, however I didn't go to sleep quickly, Chavez bringing up what happened a couple of years ago had made me think about it again, causing me to shiver, it had been a blood bath but I had managed to kill during the whole thing, my grandfather would have described it as \"An animal releasing its true spirit.\" That was most likely the reason why I was called Catori, Catori meant spirit. I had shot men, I had stabbed them, I knew my way like a warrior because I had brothers, so I was like one only female… I shivered again causing Chavez to move \"Are you alright?\" My teeth chattered \"Just freezing but I am okay.\" The normal brother like figure he was he moved from his spot and laid behind me, that caused me to fall asleep. I woke up the next morning to feel warm I was comfortable to be honest, the fire had long since gone out and it was morning I felt shifting in front of me causing me to wake up a little more \"Stop moving.\" I murmured. In reply I got \"We have to get up.\" I sighed and sat up slightly I knew what happened I was sleeping curled up behind Chavez, that was normal when I went camping, I heard a horse in the distance \"What was that?\" Charlie asked \"Doc's back…I told you guys he would come back.\" Billy said up the hill. I stepped up and looked to see Doc he waved as us, I was disappointed but I was happy to see him. Beside me Billy held a smile \"Regulators…lets mount up!\" \"Alright do you guys under stand the plan?\" Chavez and I sat together on our horses nodding we were both in pairs, Steve and Charlie were in in, Doc and Billy, then Chavez and I \"Funny they always put the Indians that are experts in weapons on the same team.\" I said Chavez smirked, we knew the plan and we were going to stick to it. \"Yeah Billy we got it go.\" I said Chavez backed the horse against the building I did the same thing that he did, but I was right next to him looking past the building. I watched as Billy skipped down the road right behind the sheriff, Doc climbed up and was sitting on the roof on one of the buildings. Steve and Charlie were sitting behind the wall where I couldn't see them, Chavez looked at me \"Ready?\" I nodded and backed over to where we were \"Remember what I taught you about knives, keep level and aim, I would require you to stop on a horse but its time you grow up.\" \"Grow up huh, is that a challenge?\" He smirked at me \"You want a challenge, you got it.\" I leaned over the horse again and I saw Billy take the gun from the sheriff and \"Top of the morning to ya girls ha ha.\" I heard the gun go off, Chavez looked at me \"Go…\" We both kicked to cause the horses to go, and at a dead run at the same time made the corner taking out our knives, Chavez flipped one leg over the side of the horse, and I did the same on the other side of my horse, I covered him as hi took aim and hit the sheriff and I hit the guy that was going to shoot, both fell at the same time as we rode off, turning to see Charlie and Steve take off running on there horses then was Doc and Billy, Doc had to jump off the roof onto his horse and we took off riding through town. \"No way did he have better posture than I did; I was the one protecting his butt! I didn't really have the option for posture.\" Outside of a photography place where Billy wanted his picture taken Chavez and I got into a friendly argument who had better form, I got the vote for good aim and excellent speed, but Chavez got better shot and better posture on the horse, because while I hit a deputy in the chest, Chavez hit the sheriff in the neck \"Chiquita, when you get more practice I am sure you will do much better.\" I gave him a friendly glare \"see if I save you again.\" Billy stepped out with a picture that he had taken I glanced at it \"You look left handed.\" I said \"They way you held that gun you look left handed.\" I was teasing He looked at me as I got on the horse, and he noticed the smile on my face and laughed out loud, I was actually in a good mood for a change after what happened in Lincoln I was okay, Chavez noticed my happy go lucky attitude and actually had a smile on his face, Billy informed us that we were going to go to Alex McKsween's to see him, I nudged Chavez's horse getting his attention, I needed to get some air, and the horse needed to run again, Chavez knew that, Doc even saw it and stepped in between us and we came to a stop, Billy, Steve and Charlie watched each putting a bet on one of us, and it was split equally \"When I say go, go to that tree go around it and come back.\" Chavez and I got ready, this was a normal thing, when Chavez and I were kids we would watch his cousins and my brothers on horse back on the reservation they would race, play tag, and try to wrestle themselves off the horses, since I was the only girl and the youngest of my family my brothers took the opportunity to teach me all of it, they taught me how to ride a horse and in the end they taught me how to fight, When Chavez and I got older I was allowed to join my brothers and Chavez his cousins, even now that I am twenty years old I enjoyed a run around, today was one of those days. I leaned forward on the horse and Chavez did the same that I did, Doc looked at the both of us and waited and with a quiet tone he smiled \"GO.\" Chavez and I both said \"Heeya.\" And the horses ran the rush of the wind combed my hair back my hat fell off but the string kept the had back behind my shoulders, I rounded the tree with Chavez right behind me however he wasn't going to let me win that easily he found a spot and hopped on the horse behind me letting his horse stop behind him, when I got back to Doc everyone laughed \"I think I better say that it was a tie.\" I turned and looked behind me at Chavez \"I don't know how I didn't know that you do it all the time.\" \"You'll learn.\" \"Oh thank you brother I don't know how I would do it without you.\" I helped him back to his horse where he hopped back on the saddle of his own horse \"alright I am done we can go.\" i said smiling. \"This is for you Alex.\" \"What the hell is the matter with you Billy? DO you realize what you guys have done, the governor has revoked your badges your now wanted the state of New Mexico, Murphy and his men have been taking up ownership in Tunstall store and they have hired people to hut you down, what the hell do you think your doing out there?\" This was the first time I had ever seen calm looking Alex went burserc over Billy, but Billy had a come back.\" \"Maybe I am trying to get some attention maybe get President Hayes to look this way, come and take a look himself.\" \"Well your doing an awefully good job, Billy, My wife and I have to hide out like a bunch of outlaws ourselves, you have to give up your badges…all of you.\" Billy took his badge off and had it land on the ground, he held out the photo but Alex didn't take it, not surprising, Billy handed it to Alex's wife and she took it \"Thank you Billy, she said quietly.\" He then turned away from Alex and got on his horse, Steve and Charlie took off their badges, as much as I didn't want to make the decision, I even removed mine and it hit the ground next to Billy's, Chavez was soon right behind me as if he wanted to know what I was going to do, I climbed on my horse and looked down at Chavez \"Are we making the right decision?\" I asked hoping that he would say something to the affect of 'No' or maybe 'we will figure something out' what he said was \"We are wanted now Chiquita, we have no choice.\" Doc was the last man to give his badge up, he was talking to Alex about something that I couldn't make out \"Where are we going to go from here?\" Chavez looked at me \"I don't know.\" I looked at my horse and stoked his mane, waiting for Doc to get on his horse, Chavez kept his eyes on me \"Your worried.\" It was more of a statement than a question and he could see it. I looked up at him \"You think?\" I said sarcastically.[Chapter 9] Chavez Spirit 9 \"Charlie listen to me…Noting is going to happen!\" He had lost it, and me calming him down wasn't helping, first I couldn't get him to calm down, it wasn't working, \"Charlie nothing will happen, Stop!\" He looked at me his eyes were full of fear, he was terrified, he read the papers and he had learned that we were wanted \"Dead or Alive.\" and of course if we were brought in alive it meant we were going to be hung, Charlie knowing that went into full panic.\" Doc looked at Billy who had just walked up to see me trying to consol Charlie, Charlie piped us \"You ever see someone hanged?\" Billy smiled \"Yeah I seen one guy get hung, saw his head come clean off.\" \"I don't think he wants to hear that right now Billy.\" Doc said \"You mess your pants they say, girls watching and everything.\" Charlie said \"Shit.\" I murmured \"Charlie listen we are not going to be hung, we are going to take off where they cant look for us…\" \"I never said that.\" Billy said causing me to turn and look at him \"Then you explain it to him, I am not going to.\" I said leaving my friends side to stand next to Chavez. \"I will be honest with you Charlie if we get caught we will be hung but if we don't, we are home free.\" I sighed \"I was just saying that Billy, we need to go to Mexico.\" We had a long way to go before we got there anyway Charlie looked at us \"There is something that I need to do first.\" We listened to him as he told us and before any of us knew it at all we were riding into a small Mexican town, \"This was the reason we rode all the way over here to get your carrot wet. We could have done that in Juarez.\" I slapped Steve really hard on the back of the head causing him to yell \"Not appropriate.\" I said All of us handed Charlie some money \"Let one of the boys know if you need anything.\" Billy said laughing. I rolled my eyes and walked inside, most of the time I wasn't allowed in a place like this. Today I sat at the table in the place, I was playing a game of cards with Steve, Billy and Doc, we had just made the game poker but that was only because I was kicking there but at black Jack. Chavez was sitting next to me near the corner, in the corner of my eyes I noticed a pretty young Mexican girl looking at Chavez 'Oh this is not happening.' I thought to myself, sure enough she stood up and walked over soon taking a seat right behind him, between him and I as he lit a cigarette, it was the moment that the little girl sat behind him, I was seething, I bent one of the cards in my hand, something caused me to see red and I got angry, and Doc noticed me as I glared at the girl, It was nothing against the girl, she was just doing her job but in my head I did not want her even near him. I slapped the cards down on the table \"Where are you goin?\" Steve asked I whipped around and this time I had caught Chavez's attention, I glared at him then looked at the rest of the boys \"Outhouse, It has been a long ride.\" I said darkly walking out of the business, when I walked outside I heard Chavez ask \"What's wrong with her?\" \"I don't know but that girl that is sitting next to you better go before she comes back.\" I walked to the outhouse and did my business then I continued to walk over to the water pump and get some water to wash my hands and my face, I don't know what got into me, whatever Chavez was interested in was nothing to me, He was just my friend, like a brother to me it wasn't like anything was going to happen to us. \"You want to tell me what that was all about all of a sudden?\" I looked at him \"I just had the sudden urge to go to the restroom it was a rough ride like I said.\" \"That wasn't what I was talking about and you know it, Chiquita.\" He was leaning against the wall watching as I was washing my hands \"I am not sure I do. Why don't you try and explain it to me.\" \"I have never seen you that angry before when it came to me with another woman.\" \"Were you enjoying the fact that I was jealous or something?\" \"You admit that you were Jealous?\" \"No, Listen, I don't want to talk to you about it, I don't have time for this.\" As we were walking In Chavez and I both saw that Billy standing with another guy at the bar, I looked at doc who had this mortified look on his face. \"I would sure like to touch the gun that is going to kill Billy the Kid.\" The man handed him the gun 'you are playing with a kind of fire mister.' \"Alright son hand the gun back, don't want you getting hurt.\" \"Oh lord really.\" Billy messed with the man by flipping the gun upside down, the man got irritated as Billy gave the gun back \"Now you best run along.\" \"Well I am leaven right now and I was just wondering what to look for if I see this guy.\" \"Well he's a shorter man, has a way with woman, left handed,and is fond of whistling.\" The man turned and looked at me \"Maybe if you have a pretty girl like that with ya, you will find him.\" Billy turned and smirked at me, next turned to look in the mirror \"Hey! I see him!\" He cried out laughing, \"He's right there.\" The man turned and looked into the mirror \"Yeah? Son you better run along before I take you across my knee.\" \"I am not sure you want to do that sir.\" I said Chavez touched my shoulder but I shook my head. Billy turned and leaned against the counter and began whistling a tune, the man turned and looked at him slowly and as the light flicked on in his head he looked at the boy \"Yeah sure you are a pesky little cuss.\" He cocked the gun and tried to shoot, however Billy had already taken the bullets out, Billy took out his gun at the same time and cocked it and at the end of the tun he was whistling the gun went off. \"How many is that Doc, twenty five?\" Doc held up five fingers \"Five.\" Billy looked at him disappointed \"Make it ten.\" Charlie soon came in behind me \"It's John Kinny.\" All of us burst out the door and hopped on the horses and took off, Kinny had a whole bunch of men with him and they were after us. Down the hill where we were running were weeds it wasn't until we made it down the hill that I saw that the weeds were something like thorns, cactus and had needles and once I hit the weeds I was smacked with the plants and I kept getting hit, my hair would get caught in the plants as well. It wasn't until I was about to get down where the weeds were I hit a hard branch that knocked me clear off my horse my breath was knocked out of me and my ears were ringing \"Ow God.\" , I was on the ground for a moment hearing the sound of horses right next to me hidden in the weeds, \"Catori Come on!\" I got up and back on the horse getting down into the ditch and running behind the boys, I whipped my forehead to find crimson on my head, the branch that hit me cut a little in my head. We left Kinny in the dust and got away as far as possible. I heard Charlie let out a yelp of pain one after the other, \"Ow!\" \"I know, I know it breaks my heart too.\" I let out a slight laugh as Chavez took out another needle, by the time we had found someplace to hide the blood on my forehead was dried even though the cut still stung, Charlie let out another yelp, Doc and Steve were in a hot spring, I would dab the bandana in the spring so that I could clean the wound on my head, \"Ya know Catori has blood on her head why don't you work on that?\" Charlie said \"Because you're the one with thorns in your butt.\" I said \"Besides I am fine.\" I hissed when I dabbed the bandanna against my forehead. \"Ow.. Dammit.\" Billy was looking at the newspaper, \"\"So I guess I better ask this before it gets awkward, what is next?' \"We go back to Lincoln and finish the job.\" Billy said \"What? Billy no, we are wanted by people they are trying to get to us they will kill us we cant do that.\" \"You asked what you wanted to do, we need to finish the job. I mean have you guys felt that rush that test, Woo like when John Kinny was riding on our ass, bullets were flying.\" He took out his gun and shot three bullets causing all of us to jump Charlie shot a slight glare at him as Chavez pulled out one last needle. Charlie pulled his pants up. Chavez stood off of the ground and stood in front of me, Doc looked at me \"No Billy I didn't get a rush from being chased.. While you get a rush I shit my Breeches Okay! We can not beet this war not the six of us, Billy if you want the presidents attention go ahead, but tonight I am going to go into a town get a hot meal, a bath and get a good nights sleep then by morning I am mexican.\" Charlie looked at him \"Me too.\" I brushed Chavez's hand away from my head \"I am going to have to agree, we need to get to Old Mexico.\" Chavez went back to trying to clean my head and I brushed him away again \"Stop.\" I said irritated he glared at me for a moment. \"Well Your testing yourselves Gentlemen and you don't even know It, trying to make it for Old Mexico that is a hoot.\" Billy said \"What?\" Doc asked confused. \"Murphy and the law will have his men spread from the border from New Mexico to Texas, your testing yourself, well hell…I will play this, alright we will go.\" I brushed Chavez's hand away again \"I told you to quit, I am fine dammit!\" I said \"Will you tell me what I did to anger you so much?\" \"I will tell you what has me angered…\" I stood up so I was almost eye level, even though he was so much taller than I was. \"You…You have me angered Chavez, and you don't see it because you are blind!\" I know that didn't make much sense now that I think about it. I t was quiet within our group, everyone was looking at him and I as we were arguing, I pushed past Chavez and walked away from him I wanted to be alone.[Chapter 10] Chavez Spirit 10 Third POV All of them were left confused, Catori left with anger and no one understood what was wrong with her \"This is why most groups don't let woman in.\" Billy said. \"But she is a pretty damn good shot.\" Doc looked at Chavez \"That is why I told you to get the little Mexican girl out of the way before she came back from the outhouse.\" Chavez looked at him \"She is still mad about that?\" \"Something tells me that yeah, she is.\" Chavez turned and looked at her with her back facing him, there was nothing more that he thought more cute then when she was angry. She had been angry about him with that little Mexican Gal from earlier, she was a pretty thing but she was there to work, Catori was with him all the time. \"Alright. .I will go talk to her.\" \"Your testing yourself again.\" Billy said \"Me I would rather play with a rattle snake than mess with her when she is angry.\" Chavez turned to Billy and gave him a bored look \"I know I am playing with fire Chivato, don't remind me.\" I was steaming, what I had just yelled at Chavez about didn't even make sense, and I had just left them with confused faces, I rolled my eyes \"God what is wrong with me, whatever happens to Chavez is not part of my control; I was acting like a child. I gripped my temple in frustration \"Crap.\" And this wasn't exactly what I would call the best time to try to get to know my feelings, John Kinny was after us and pretty soon the U.S marshals would be after us, here I was worried about what I thought about my best friend, the one that has known me since the day I was born and… I heard movement behind me and I whipped around taking a knife from my holster \"Wait a moment Chiquita! IT's just me!\" He called I sighed \"I thought I told you never to sneak up on me.\" I said frustrated spinning the knife and putting it away \"And I thought I told you I wanted to be alone.\" \"You never said that.\" I sighed \"Then take a hike.\" I said \"There now I said it.\" He shook his head to tell me he wasn't leaving, My shoulders dropped and I turned away from him \"Fine do your own thing.\" \"You're mad at me about that girl at the Cantina aren't you?\" I didn't look at him \"No.\" \"And I know when your lying Catori, so don't even try it.\" I sighed \"Yeah.\" \"I thought so, why are you angry over her?\" I turned and became more frustrated than what I had ever been \"Because, there are better women in this world that could satisfy your hunger than her, she may have been hired to do it but still there are better more expectable.\" Chavez at that moment started laughing at me, \"What is so funny?\" I crossed my arms over my chest getting a little angrier each time. He finally managed to reply \"You…You are funny to me Catori.\" \"Why in all hell am I that funny?\" \"Because you can't see it, see you are just as clueless as what I was a moment ago, except what I am about to do makes sense.\" He started walking toward me and I backed up \"What?\" \"All of the things that I have done, fixing your knuckles when you busted it, cleaning the graze in your leg, keeping you warm by the fire…giving you that blanket that you sleep with at night…All of that is showing you how much I do care about you, John told me to be subtle about it…apparently subtle isn't how to get your attention, and Jealousy doesn't work either…\" He walked over and took my face in his hands looking at me for a moment, He pulled my face to his and his lips grabbed mine, I was left in surprise, if he was trying to make a point he was making it quite clear. When he let go of me I blinked a couple of times before I kissed him again I ran a hand through his hair and he pulled me close to him, it was just to make sure that he was certain what he was doing, when he pulled away the second time he smiled at me \"I take it you get the point now.\" I nodded weakly \"Yeah I got it now.\" My knees buckled and he caught me \"Sorry, I have just never…\" He chuckled slightly. \"Uh, Chavez…how long exactly have…\" He touched my hair, smiling at me \"All your life Chiquita, I may not have known about it yet, but all of your life.\" I smirked \"I think we better not tell them yet.\" He looked past me and I could tell that he agreed, \"That may be the bet Idea I have ever heard.\" We walked back to the camp together, we were both watched as I sad down and Chavez cleaned my head \"He couldn't clean my forehead without everything.\" I said \"So you guys are okay?\" Charlie asked \"Yeah we are fine.\" I said \"So are we going on to Old Mexico.\" Doc who was getting dressed nodded \"Yeah.\" I nodded, when all of them looked away, I made eye contact with Chavez and smiled, he returned it \"Alright, I think that is clean enough, don't do anything else like run into branches.\" \"I didn't plan on it the first time; I fell off the horse when I did it.\" We rode into Juarez that night, we were so close to the border but everyone was tired that night, \"We will head there in a couple of days, we will talk about it in the morning.\" We dismounted the horse and everyone got a room, I had my room in the corner down the porch, it was a private room so no one would disturb me, and knowing Billy's crap with girls I was thankful, we were all tired, so all of us getting to bed was no problem, however I was not alone for long, I felt the presence of someone in front of my bed, when I opened my eyes I saw Chavez, \"What are you doing?\" \"Move over.\" \"What?\" \"Move over.\" I did as he said and moved over to the other side of the bed and he climbed in next to me, when he laid down next to me I sat up \"You don't have your own bed?\" \"Of course I do, I am sleeping in it, I want to protect you tonight.\" I smiled at him and lay back down on the mattress and made myself comfortable \"Thank you.\" He touched my hair and kissed the side of my head \"Go to sleep.\" I smiled and looked at his eyes \"I don't want to sleep.\" Chavez returned my gaze \"You…\" I nodded causing him to laugh at me before he rolled over on top of me and kissed me, I felt his heart beat, and it was honestly the best thing ever for me to feel. I loved him and I couldn't doubt it. I woke up the next day to feel a light warmth on my neck, I was wrapped in my favorite blanket, and by Chavez himself. I rolled over to look over my shoulder, he was peaceful, I set my head back down on his shoulder and closed my eyes again. A slight banging on my door caused Chavez to shift, I rolled over \"What!\" I said a little annoyed that I was being disturbed this early in the morning. \"Catori have you seen…\" The door opened and Doc stood at the door as I covered myself up, Chavez sat up at the same time I did and we both looked at Doc \"Chavez.\" He said finishing his sentence blinking, surprised, but at the same time entertained. His hand dropped from the knob on the door, he soon held the biggest smile on his face I have ever seen, Chavez and I looked at each other before I turned and said \"This…isn't…what it looks…like?\" Chavez turned and gave me a look before rolling his eyes, and I just shrugged my shoulders, Doc laughed at the both of us \"If this isn't what it looks like then what is it supposed to be?\" \"What does it look like?\" I asked \"It looks like love to me.\" We both looked at him, and then looked at each other \"Then I guess you would be right Doc.\" I said moving my hair from my face. Doc opened the door and yelled out the door \"You guys owe me three dollars each!\" I took my boot and threw it at him \"You guys bet on it then get out!\" Doc laughed and left the room. I sighed and layed back down on the bed, Chavez layed right next to me, \"I have to get up, I cant sleep here all day.\" I looked at him \"Sure you can.\" He looked at me and smiled but got out of the bed and got dressed, \"I will come back, get some sleep.\" He leaned back into the bed and kissed me one more time before leaving the room. Right when I was getting back to sleep I heard a knock at the door it was light but it was enough to stir me \"Yeah?\" The door opened and Charlie stepped through the door \"Hey Charlie, What's going on?\" He seemed nervous, but he looked at me and said \"Can…Can I talk to you?\"[Chapter 11] Chavez's Spirit 11 I got dressed in a skirt and a white shirt that morning, Charlie sat in the chair in my room when I came back from washing my hands, he was sitting there nervous, like he didn't know what to do, I sat down in the chair across from him and handed him a cup of coffee \"What is it Charlie? What do you need?\" He didn't look at me \"Charlie you came in here to talk to me remember? Tell me what is going on?\" \"I am…scared.\" I wasn't too awfully surprised \"what are you afraid of Charlie?\" \"I am worried about living, Billy is going to get us killed if we keep this up anymore, John Kinney will get us for sure, and I have a life that I want to live, It isn't like you and Chavez who have been in love with each other since the first…\" \"Wait, wait, wait…Charlie, Chavez and I haven't been...\" \"Yes you have, everyone sees it.\" \"Charlie…\" I had to sit back and think about what we were really talking about here \"In any case, you said…\" \"I want to fall in love will a cute little girl, I want a family, a life, not to run around all the time with a kid that gets enjoyment off of killing people.\" \"Listen to me Charlie, I understand what you're saying, you want a chance…I do to but we can't get that kind of life here, that is why we are going to Mexico, We can't have a chance to be free anymore, not here, we will be hunted down.\" Charlie looked at me \"But you still have Chavez.\" That hit me like a stake through my heart \"Charlie, you have someone, Chavez and I have known each other all of our lives, some say it was expected, though we didn't believe it, I will tell you what…I saw a pretty little Mexican girl when we rode into town, and she was looking at you.\" I happen to glance out the window, I was technically lying to Charlie because I never saw her before \"And it just so happens that the little Mexican gal is walking by the window, go over and talk to her.\" Charlie looked at me and stood up to look at her out the window \"Thanks Catori, you're a real pal.\" \"I thought so, now get out of here.\" Charlie got up and left leaving the door open, Chavez looked at him as he past \"What was that all about?\" I looked up at him smiling \"Lets just say I was helping him out.\" He smirked and handed me a cup of coffee kissing me on the lips and I kissed him back \"I have a question…\" \"What?\" he asked \"Did everyone think that you and I would be together?\" \"Well our grandmothers said so, and we didn't believe them, what do you think?\" I looked at him for a moment \"That isn't what I meant, I mean when I was talking to Charlie he was saying something about us being in love with each other since we came to John's, you think that was true?\" Chavez looked at my eyes for a moment \"Maybe they all saw something we didn't see, I know that our families saw it.\" \"Yeah but I don't think that counts, they are insane.\" He snickered at me \"I think we were just waiting for you, we are going to discuss what to do next.\" \"I thought Doc said he wanted to ride to Old Mexico.\" \"He does, Billy talked him out of it.\" I sighed \"That kid has some major problems; I can't do this shit anymore.\" He touched my hair \"I know, I can't either.\" We walked out of the room and over to the horses where Billy, Doc, and Steve were waiting, they turned and looked at me, Billy had a big smile on his face \"Well looks like the two lovers got out of bed today.\" I glared at him and Chavez stepped next to me \"Enough Chivato.\" I rolled my eyes at them both \"Anyway, that isn't the reason why we are gathered in front of the horses, what are we going to do?\" \"Well we are going to go to Old Mexico…after we spend a couple of days here.\" \"A couple days?\" \"Yeah, I want to spend a couple days writing the president a letter, the governor and some others, then as soon as those are sent then we can take off.\" I took a deep exhale \"Okay Billy, you want the presidents attention, go and get the presidents attention, I am going to relax.\" \"Hey I thought you would be happy being with Chavez for a while, it give you two time, alone.\" He had a smirk on his face when he said it. I looked up at Chavez who kept a glare on Billy, they were all hacking on us both but I wasn't going to play, instead I took Chavez's hand and drug him back toward my door \"Come on.\" He smiled at me and kissed me on the lips \"What are you doing?\" \"Not playing there game, or at most playing at my own rules.\" He took the side of my neck with the palms of his hands and looked into my eyes before kissing me again, this time it was a deep kiss, he pulled me close to him and I fallowed through, he backed me up until I hit the edge of the bed when he let go, his forehead touched mine and he looked into my eyes \"You know a love like this can be dangerous.\" He stated \"Yes, I know, but it doesn't matter, and I don't care, it is meant to be.\" An hour later I was walking the markets looking for some food for the night, Charlie was with the Mexican gal that I pointed to that morning, and to be honest it was sweet. They were sitting together on a brick wall as he draped his coat over her shoulders, causing me to smile even wider 'Just like that huh?' When I grabbed everything and started to walk back to my room I heard people in the wash house \"…You may come down to Juarez for I am unarmed…\" 'Oh thank God Billy said something.' I said sighing with relief. I looked at the sky \"Thank you, thank you.\" I whispered. \"Who are you thanking?\" I whipped around and held a finger to my lips \"Billy is writing a letter to President Hayes saying that he is giving himself up.\" Chavez stood next to me \"If short Mr. President…I surrender.\" Chavez grabbed me around the waist and spun me around kissing me on the face and on the lips, then right as we thought we were hope free Billy had to open his big mouth \"P.S. I changed my mind…Kiss my ass.\" That caused both of us to stop and Chavez put me down \"I should have known he wouldn't give up two easily.\" I said sighing. Behind me I heard running of cowboy boots and yelling \"Guys!\" I looked past Chavez and at Steve \"What? Steve what is going on?\" \"Charlie…he's\" He was trying to catch his breath, and I could see he was having a hard time 'I told you to quite chewing when ya had the chance you dumb butt!\" \"Steve, just slow down and breathe…what about Charlie?\" I asked taking his shoulders. Steve finally let out a breath and got his bearings back \"Charlie's…getting….married.\" I looked at Chavez who had a smile on his face \"Our Charlie?\" \"Yeah are Charlie! Who else?\" He bolted into the bath house and yelled at Doc and Billy the sudden good news that Charlie was in fact engaged; Chavez looked at me with a suspicious face \"Is that what you did?\" I gave him a shifty eyed glance \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" \"No of course not.\" He said smiling \"I am proud of you.\" The night had fallen and Charlie was with his new bride, she was beautiful in a white dress and veil. I watched as Billy was with a little boy that had found some admiration, Doc sat reading a book, Steve was dancing with a little old woman, stopping every so often so that he could spit out his tobacco, and finally Chavez was dancing with a little girl in his arms, it caused me to smile with joy watching them. He set the little girl down after the song and caught eye contact with me 'oh no.' \"Come on Catori, how many times do we get like this?\" I smirked \"Not too many.\" I stood up and walked over to him, wrapping one arm on his shoulder and the other in his hand, he wrapped his arm around my waist, he pulled me close t him and kissed the side of my forehead I smiled at him \"Your quite the charmer when you want to be.\" \"I am a lot better than the rest of these boys even Doc.\" \"Don't get to cocky the night isn't over yet.\" He looked at me with a smile I haven't seen him with in years, before our families died he had that smile, now it seemed he was healed. The sudden crack of a gun across the night sky caused us to stop and the dreaded words I didn't want to hear again \"Regulators…mount up.\" Chavez and I exchanged glances, I didn't release him instead I fallowed behind him to the front of the line \"What is going on?\" \"Alex and his wife are in trouble, Catori, just stay here and stay with Charlie's wife.\" Billy said. \"What? No I am not staying here!\" Chavez looked at me \"This time I want you to listen to what Billy says, and stay here.\" \"No Chavez…I am a regulator I belong with you guys…with you.\" \"The reason you belong with me is the reason I don't want you to go Chiquita.\" Tears were going to start streaming down my face, and for Charlie's new bride they were already pouring \"Charlie why don't you stay too, you're a family man now, plus your wife is crying and she is giving me a head ache.\" I watched Chavez as he jumped on his horse, I walked over and touched his knee \"Tehila it A.\" He bent down and kissed me his forehead touching mine \"I love you too.\" He sat up straight \"I will come back, I promise.\" Charlie jumped on his horse \"It aint easy having pals.\"[Chapter 12] Chavez Spirit Chapter 12 A few hours near dawn I was still with Charlie's wife while she cried, I felt useless I was used to just taking care of my own emotions I couldn't think of another woman's it was weird for me, I wasn't sad, at the moment I was more angry than what I was sad, I had let Chavez slip through again, and the more I thought about it the angrier I got, they were going back to Lincoln to help Alex, who had made it very clear that he was going to take care of himself… Of course with Murphy and Dolan taking over the town Alex was going to be next with his head on the hook. I sighed and sat forward \"I only wish there was something I could do to make you feel better about this Rosita, Charlie is going to be alright.\" She looked from her bed \"How do you know.\" To be honest I wasn't sure if he was going to be okay and I kept silent \"You are in love with the Indian man.\" Rosita asked me trying to steer away from the question, and I nodded \"Yes, I love him more than the summer sun and the spring paint brushes.\" \"Then why don't you go to him?\" \"Because he told me to stay here, I have to listen to what he says.\" Rosita stood up and moved her hair from her face, she took off her veil and removed her dress \"Sometimes…love is stronger than listening to the one you love.\" She looked at me \"And from what I could see of you two it is important that you go to him.\" I looked at her and saw the look in her eyes \"My husband is important to me but you and the Indian are the truest love.\" She said. Rosita nodded toward my horse then looked toward the north \"You don't have much time you have to go, and tell Charlie that I love him.\" I nodded grabbing my guns, my hat and my horse and took off as dawn broke over the New Mexico sky \"I Just hope that the gun fight doesn't start yet.\" Lincoln New Mexico was a little dead because of the problem at the McSween house, the stores were locked up and barricaded, the sheriffs office was empty as well, all of the problems were up the street where they had some wagons tipped over and the men were standing behind the wagons, I had to think of a way to get in. I dodged behind a wall and thought deeply about it, I could do it the old renegade way and start shooting…or I could have gone peacefully while everyone slept…or I could sneak around back…. 'Ah screw it!' I thought cocking the rifle and getting back on the horse \"Since when is this group quiet, or peaceful? I am riding in like hell is on my ass and I am taking names while I shoot.\" Finally I got an idea that was the best I had come up with… All of the boys in the McSween house were tired, except for Billy who was a ball full of energy \"Hey Peppen I see you got Johnny Crawford down there?\" \"Yeah Bonny we got a whole lot.\" Billy stood up and took the shot hitting his target. dead on arrival of the bullet. \"Hey Pippen Johnny Crawford aint with ya anymore.\" Billy cackled with excitement as Doc looked at him with a tired expression, suddenly something caught his eye and Doc looked out the window \"Aw Shit!\" Everyone looked at Doc then whipped toward the window to look, Chavez, who had been taking a seat at the window toward the west walked over, \"Who is that?\" \"I don't know and apparently Peppin doesn't know him either. In the middle of the road on a horse stood a man with a black sheet and a white and black painted horse \"Wait…that horse…\" Suddenly the horse reared up and kicked peppin backward and a gun raised in the air as the horse ran past the barricade, Chavez in some sort of shock and frustration shot backward then a shot a couple of the bullets killing the soldiers and the men behind the barricade. \"Dammit! Cover me!\" Doc did as told and Chavez took off down stairs, Doc looked at the black sheet was removed and a small catch of brunette hair caught his eye \"If we make it out of this Chavez better marry that girl.\" Bullets grazed past my head and my body as I ran past the barricade ripping off the sheet and throwing it down to the ground I shot a couple more bullets before the door to the McSween house opened and a rifle popped a couple shots at them, giving me enough time to get off the horse and get inside. I threw myself inside and hit the deck the man covering me right behind me landing on top of me to cover me from debris, as soon as he was able to kick the door closed he grabbed the back of my collar to get me off of the ground \"What the hell is wrong with you! I told you to stay in Juarez!\" I made eye contact with the Mexican Indian, his eyes sparked, this was the first time he had ever been truly angry at me, and I was in trouble, I knew that \"Your going to have to learn something about me before you get the wrong impression about me Chavez… Nothing is going to tie me down… You will be awfully surprised what I will do for love.\" \"What you did was stupid! But I am glad your alright.\" \"Gun fire erupted again and he caused me to duck and pushed me up the stairs. When I was greeted by the rest of the boys they looked at me tiredly \"Finally decided to show up huh Catori Spirit.\" I looked at Billy \"I am a regulator Billy that is what I am here for.\" I grabbed my gun and took out the shells \"I need some more shells, I am going to hell with shells.\" Alex and his wife looked at me \"I expected it from the boys, but not from you Catori.\" I looked at Alex who looked at me with a death glare, he was sick as well I could see it in his skin \"I guess I managed to surprise a whole shit load of people Alex that is what happens when you try to tame and Indian.\" Night fell that night and we were still locked up in the McSween house, some of us had managed to get to sleep, Steve, Charlie every so often, and Billy, Doc, Chavez and I were still awake, but I was starting to fade, I was resting on Chavez's shoulder \"Why did you come here?\" he whispered to me I looked up at him for a moment before setting my head down again \"A little birdie told me that I needed to come. I couldn't just sit around until I got the news that you lived or died.\" He touched my hand lightly and I continued \"Besides…You slept in my bed…your stuck with me now, and your not getting rid of me.\" He shifted to look down at my head \"Well in that case…\" I smiled and kissed his hand. I then yawned and rubbed my eyes \"I don't possibly know how I could be sleepy.\" \"Get some rest, I will wake you up.\" I nodded and laid my head down, he draped his coat over me and kissed me one more time. It wasn't Chavez that woke me up that morning it was the sound of marching and horseshoes, I shifted as there were frantic footsteps around the attic \"Shit! Charlie how is it at your end can we break?\" I sat up quickly \"What is it?\" I asked Doc \"The army is here, looks like the president got his letter.\" Doc said Charlie just made a surprised \"Uh.\" Sound \"Charlie?\" I asked \"It's…It's John Kinney!\" \"what should we do, we cant get out of the back, we clearly cant go out the front.\" \"It's John Kinney.\" Charlie repeated in a louder voice. Doc looked at me \"What do you think?\" \"I don't know I clearly am not skilled at getting us out of these positions.\" I said referring to my ride in yesterday. Doc nodded knowing what I was talking \"It's John Kinney.\" Charlie yelled again causing both Doc and I to give a frustrated \"Thank you very much Charlie!\" Billy looked at us \"Well hell…Lets fire up.\" \"No Billy that isn't…\" Bullets started flying causing an echo through the attic \"Dammit Billy!\" The streets lit up around and the soldiers started to fire, none of them hit us of course, I aimed my rifle and shot three rounds when a carriage pulled up outside and in sight was Mr. Murphy \"Ah look at what we have here.\" I said \"Doc, I think your little china girl is with him.\" Doc jumped up and rushed over, and saw what I was looking at…\"No way.\" All of a sudden she jumped out of the carriage and rand down toward the barricade with Murphy Yelling at her \"China!\" \"YEN!\" Doc yelled I aimed the gun and took a shot at two soldiers that were running toward us but they backed away before I could get a good shot \"Doc goes, I will cover you.\" Doc thanked me and ran down the stairs \"How many woman are going to come down here?\" Billy explained \"Hey Charlie, how about you, your wife gonna come down too?\" I looked at him \"Shut up Billy, this is the only time I ever dare say it but shut up!\" Murphy was yelling at the soldiers \"Burn it down!\" 'What about the girl?\" Murphy whipped around on a heal and jabbed a finger at him \"BURN IT!\" \"Oh no.\" I whispered, Doc and his China girl ran up the stairs the young girl making eye contact with me for a moment \"Billy I need to get Susan out of here!\" Alex called at him \"Then do it!\" Susan suddenly looked at her husband…\"No I am not Leaving! NO!\" Alex dragged the kicking and screaming woman down the stairs. When I saw her appear across the street I was relieved, suddenly she slapped the general of the army yelling one word \"MURDERER!\"[Chapter 13] Chavez's Spirit 13 If you ever have never been in a fire then I would suggest that you would have been in this one. The Soldiers had thrown torches at the McSkeen house, causing the house to become extremely hot and unable to deal with. Susan out of the house, Alex had then taken his position helping empty the flammable thing from the house. Chavez looked at me for a moment while the house was burning down \"I would have never wanted this from you, but I am glad that you are here with me.\" He gave me a kiss on the temple \"Listen to me, I want you to stay here, and I am going to be right back, Do you understand?\" I nodded and watched as he snuck down the stairs, I snuck over to Billy \"Billy, Chavez just went to get the horses, we have to get out of here right now.\" Billy looked at me, and even he knew when it was time to go \"Okay.\" \"Chavez! Where the hell is Chavez! That Damn Navajo greaser here we are burning to death and he is out doing it with his horse!\" Steve suddenly railed kicking at every random thing possible, I glared at him \"Steve keep your damn voice down and help me get Billy into this thing.\" \"Billy.\" I heard the quiet voice in the corner suddenly upset, we all turned and looked at Charlie who was nearing tears \"I gotta go, I gotta get away I have a wife she's a little Mexican Girl.\" \"Charlie if you don't buck up and start kicking some ass your never gonna see her again.\" I looked at him \"And with that you just signed his death certificate Billy, get in the damn Box!\" Suddenly a load of gunfire released into the air behind me \"You sonofabitch I am going to shoot you all!\" Charlie had lost it and Billy whooped \"There ya go Charlie!\" I slapped his head to get him into the trunk and shut the door \"Ready Billy?\" I heard a muffled \"Ready.\" And with that Doc and Steve threw Billy out the window, on the signal (When Billy started firing) We bolted out the door, Doc held on to Yen, Charlie pushed me out the door, and Steve was right behind Charlie. As soon I got out the door Chavez showed up and got me on the back of his horse, it wasn't surprising that the one I was riding ran away after the gun fire started, Suddenly a large and rapid cracking caused us to turn around, Steve had been shot in the knees and then in the chest, he landed in the mud in front of him, Charlie was right next to him shooting at John Kinney killing him before hitting the ground dead himself I screamed at both of them to get up my eyes were filled with tears \"It's too late Catori/\" \"We have to go back for them!\" 'We can't!\" Chavez yelled. My promise to Rosita was broken. Billy next had been shot in the stomach causing me to jump, Chavez rode one horse up to him and Billy soon got on it, I clutched to Chavez as the gunfire was soon turned on us, as Chavez had turned something hit him and he fell off the horse \"Chavez!\" A sudden stinging pain hit me in the shoulder causing my left arm to shudder with pain and me to cry out. Chavez quickly grabbed on to the reins of the horse and pulled himself up and I helped him the rest of the way onto the front of the horse so I could clutch on to him again, we Heard Alex yell as Billy got onto the horse \"Ride Billy!\" The multiple round gun, shot Alex until he hit the ground next to Charlie and Steve, Chavez kicked the sides of the horse and taking off down the road \"Reap it Murphy you son of a Bitch!\" Billy yelled his gun taking aime and firing hitting him in the head… It was all over. \"So what are we going to do?\" Billy asked us at the top of the hill for the morning sun. we were on top of the horses it was there that the regulators had made their end, with the death of Charlie Bowdry and Steve Stevens there was nothing more for us. Doc, who had Yen sun on the back of his horse smirked \"I don't know about you guys but I am getting tired of New Mexico, I think Yen and I are going to start a family.\" Billy turned and looked at me and Chavez My arm wrapped up and his leg tied \"And you guys?\" Chavez turned and looked at me \"We haven't really decided yet, but we are thinking west…just like my vision says.\" I tightened my grip on Chavez's hip \"I see a new life out there for us.\" Billy looked at us, \"Well good luck to you guys then.\" \"You two Billy.\" Advices from Lincoln report that Jose Chavez Y Chavez and Catori New Eagle moved to California where they changed there name and took work on a fruit ranch.

Chapter One: A Life of Excitement 17 year old Carmen Cortez was laying onnher bed reading another romance book when her TV turned on. \"Ms. Cortez?\" She lowered her book and saw a familiarnface on her screen. \"Yes, sir?\" \"You are needed at HQ. Its urgent.\" Carmen recognized the tone in hernfather's voice. \"Of course. Do you want me to getnJuni, too?\" \"He's already here. Please hurry.\" She nodded and set her book aside. I'llnhave to finish it later , she thought. She quickly got dressedninto something more appropriate than her sweats and tank top. Shentied her hair back and with one last glance in the mirror she leftnher room. \"Mom, I'll be back in a bit. I'mnneeded at HQ,\" she called as she passed the kitchen. \"OK. Be careful driving!\" \"I will!\" She grabbed the keys tonher BMW and left the house. As she drove, she thought about wherenher life was going. I loved being a spy, shenthought. I still do. Its just...I need something exciting in mynlife to happen. Carmen wasn't the tomboy she used tonbe. She loved getting dressed up and going out with her spy friends,nall of which were girls her own age. She had never had a boyfriend,neven though she would give anything to meet \"Mr. Right\". But shenhadn't met him yet. Her friend Liz had a boyfriend, but she wasn't anspy. I wonder if that's what turns guysnoff...the fact that I work for the OSS. She continued to muse until she reachednHQ. She parked next to her brother's Corvette, locked the doors andnquickly walked through the doors of the OSS Headquarters. \"Ah, Ms. Cortez. Welcome. You'renfather is in his office. Juni is already there,\" the agent at thensecretary desk said. \"I will notify them that you are on you'renway.\" \"Thank you.\" Carmen walked quickly. She knew how hernfather hated tardiness. She reached the office door and swept hernI.D. Card through the key. \"Voice identification, please.\" \"Carmena Elizabeth JuanitanEcosta-Brava Cortez.\" she said. \"Correct.\" And the door opened into anothernhallway. Ugh. Finally, she reached her father'snoffice and knocked. \"Come in, Carmen!\" She opened the door and saw her fathernsitting at his desk. \"Good. You're here. Now we're justnwaiting on the others.\" Carmen looked questioningly at hernbrother who just shrugged. They sat in silence, waiting for the twonothers to show up. Gregorio Cortez wondered how hisnchildren would handle seeing the Giggles again. It had been 4 ½ nyears since they last saw them. Gerti had been sent to another spynorganization whereas her brother, Gary, had been sent abroad. The OSSnwas already welcoming the two back with a homecoming assignment. Theynwere to be paired with Carmen and Juni in a rescue mission. A knock on the door startled him. \"Come in!\" The door opened and Gary and GertinGiggles entered the room. \"Mr. And Ms. Giggles. I trust you'renflights went well?\" \"They were, sir. Thank you fornasking,\" Gerti replied. \"Please, sit.\" They sat. It was then that they noticednCarmen and Juni, who were staring at them in shock. \"Carmen, Juni. I didn't know you werengoing to be here. How are you?\" Gerti asked kindly. Carmen nudged her brother whose mouthnwas hanging open. \"We're both fine. Thank you for asking. How arenyou doing?\" she replied. \"Tired, but good,\" Gary said. \"Time for pleasantries must comenlater. Right now, I must tell you about you're new mission.\" All eyes focused on Gregorio. \"The Crown Prince of Monaco has beennkidnapped by pirates. Since Monaco doesn't have the technology wenhave, they have asked us to rescue the prince. The ship was last seenn340 miles northeast of the Cape of Good Hope. They weren't goingnfast, so we presume that they are waiting for something, or someone.nDo you accept this mission?\" All nodded. \"Good. You're ship is being readiednas we speak. Dismissed.\" I wonder if the prince is cute ,nCarmen thought as she left her father's office. \"Carmen.\" She looked up. Gary Giggles was walkingnbeside her, looking at her. \"Oh. Hi, Gary.\" \"You look...well.\" he said. \"Thank you. So do you.\" Carmen could see that he had grownntaller and was more built. His hair was a little longer and his blueneyes were more...kind? Gary looked at the beautiful youngnwoman walking next to him. Her dark hair was a little shorter than henremembered and her skin was a light tan. Her clothes showed off herncurves and he could tell that she cared more about her appearancenthan she did before. \"What are you staring at?\" shenasked, breaking his train of thought. \"Um, n-nothing.\" he said. Idiot ,nhe thought. \"Uh huh.\" She smiled slightly. Gerti came up from behind them andnslipped her arm through her brother's. \"You've made him speechless, Carmen.nNo one has been able to do that in a long time.\" She winked at hernfriend. Carmen's smile grew wider. They walked in silence for a fewnminutes. \"Well, this isn't awkward at all...\"nJuni said. \"Its only awkward when you say itsnawkward, Juni,\" Gerti said. Juni blushed. \"Ah, you made him blush, Gerti.nLately, I've been the only one who can do that,\" Carmen said with ansmile. Juni's blush grew even more red.nEveryone laughed. \"It is good to be back,\" Gary said. \"Its good to have you back,\" Carmennreplied. Juni made a gagging noise at whichnCarmen shot a death glare at him. Gerti giggled. \"Well, I'm going to change. I'll meetnyou in the foyer in 10 minutes.\" \"I'll go with you, Carmen. I need tonget out of this clothes,\" Gerti said. \"Right. 10 minutes.\" At that, everyone parted ways. When Carmen says her full name, itnis the same as in the second movie. Just for clarification. I don'tnknow if the math is right or not, but then again its only a story. Anlittle wrong information is OK every once in a while. Well, I hoped you liked it! Pleasenreview! NEXT CHAPTER:nCaught In the Middle[Chapter 2] I don't own any of this...well, except Carlos and a bunch of other random characters. Here's the second chapter! Enjoy! Chapter Two: Caught in the Middle 10 minutes later, Juni and Gary were standing in the foyer waiting for their sisters to show up. \"Their late,\" Juni said. \"Their women,\" Gary replied. \"True.\" \"Since when has Juni Cortez become such a ladies man?\" Gary asked in surprise. \"A lot has changed since you left, Gary.\" \"I noticed.\" There were was a short pause. Should I ask him? Gary thought. \"So, does Carmen have a boyfriend?\" he asked casually. \"Ha! No. She wishes though.\" Juni paused. \"You're not going to ask her out are you? Because you had a chan-\" \"Relax. I was just asking.\" \"Uh huh.\" \"We're here! Sorry we're late. Carmen was showing me this really cool twist to use on my hair,\" Gerti said as she and Carmen arrived. \"Right. Let' get going.\" \"Women...\" Juni muttered. They walked quickly to the docks. \"I was beginning to get worried about you four. Come on, we're running late. You know how to use these controls, but I added something in. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT push this unless you are in REAL danger,\" Machete said. \"Yes, Uncle Felix,\" Carmen said sweetly. \"And don't call me uncle.\" Carmen grinned. \"Alright. Let's get started!\" * * * * * * * An hour later, the Cortezes and the Giggles were 100 miles below the sea line. Carmen was reading on her bunk, Gerti was watching the radar, Juni was steering and Gary was watching Carmen read. After several minutes of being watched, Carmen looked up. \"Is there something that you need from me?\" she asked Gary. \"No. I was just trying to figure out when you started reading romance novels.\" \"A few years ago. Why?\" \"No reason.\" Carmen returned to her book and Gary looked out the window, watching the fish swim by. \"I see something!\" Gerti called out after about 20 minutes of silence. Gary rushed to her side and she pointed. \"Its a ship. Can they see us?\" \"I doubt it. But we can't be too careful.\" Carmen got up and stood beside Gary. \"Look...its changing course,\" she said. \"Its coming straight at us. Juni, shut the lights off! Turn all power off except the emergency lights!\" Gerti cried. The whole submarine went dark as they waited for the ship to pass. All were watching the radar, waiting for the ship to change course. But it didn't. It simply vanished. \"Where did it go?\" Carmen whispered. \"I think its above us,\" Juni replied. \"Because that's the only way a ship can go off radar unless its out of range.\" All of a sudden, they felt a tug. Then they started moving: up. \"I think they found us,\" Gerti said. \"Come on. We need to get out of here. Move slowly though. Any sudden movement and who knows what they will do. And hurry!\" \"Light or heavy?\" Carmen asked. \"Heavy. Who knows when we'll be back.\" Carmen and Juni exhanged secret smiles but they disappeared as soon as they felt the whole submarine shake. \"I think its too late to escape,\" Gary said. She pressed the red button. \"Gerti!\" Just then, before anything more was said, the door opened. Smoke blew into the room, causing everyone to cough. \"Well, well, well. Isn't it the famous Spy Kids.\" a voice said. The smoke cleared and they could see a young man leaning against the door frame. \"Who are you?\" Gary asked immediately. \"That's none of your business. But you may tell me who you are.\" \"That's none of your business,\" Gerti replied sharply. He chuckled. \"Fine. Well, I am Prince Carlos Edwardo Juanes Garcia. Now, its your turn.\" The four of them were speechless. \"You are the prince we are supposed to rescue?\" Juni asked after a minute of silence. \"Oh! You are the ones who were sent to rescue me! Well, I am sorry to say that I do not need rescuing.\" He smirked. \"You see, I planned my own kidnapping.\" \"Well, since you have no need of us, you might as well let us go,\" Carmen spoke up. The prince looked at her. His eyes widened slightly. \"Bonita...\" he whispered. Gary looked from the prince to Carmen who was blushing. He knew what was going on in his mind. \"She's right. You have no need of us. We'll go now.\" Carlos recovered and he looked at Gary. \"I don't think so. I can't have you telling your HQ about this. Besides...I think we can all get along here. That is, if you cause no trouble.\" He looked at Carmen again. \"Come. I shall show you the ship.\" He paused. \"If you do not come peacefully, then there will be consequences.\" Gary looked at the others who all nodded. \"Fine. We'll come.\" Gerti left first, followed by Juni, then Carmen. Gary looked at the prince who was watching Carmen. He had this look in his eyes that Gary didn't like. I must keep him away from Carmen , he thought. * * * * * * * They walked in silence as they followed Carlos. \"Why did you plan you're own kidnapping?\" Gerti asked, breaking the silence. \"You all are probably dying to know that. Well, since we're going to be on this ship for quite some time, I will tell you. But not now. You'll have to wait until dinner,\" Carlos replied pleasantly. Gerti nodded. At least he's going to tell us. How are we going to get off this ship? Juni thought. They won't find an empty submarine at the bottom of the ocean. And the prince will probably take away all our spy gear. So what are we going to do? \"Carmen?\" Gary asked quietly. She looked at him. \"Be careful around Carlos. There's something about him that makes me nervous.\" Carmen smiled a little. \"Jealous are we?\" \"No...just looking out for you,\" he replied. Her smile disappeared. \"OK. Maybe I am a little jealous. But seriously. Please be careful. If not for me, for everyone else.\" She nodded. \"I will.\" Carlos was watching Carmen and Gary. He saw Carmen's little smile and her blush when Gary leaned in to whisper to her. He didn't know what was said, but he didn't like it. So, I have a little competition, he thought. I'll get the girl, for who can resist becoming a princess? \"Here we are,\" he said aloud. \"This is the sleeping quarters.\" He pointed at Juni. \"You shall sleep here.\" \"I have a name, you know.\" \"Names later. Rooms now. You,\" pointing at Gary, \"sleep here. The young girl shall sleep at the second door on the left.\" He looked at Carmen. \"And you, milady, shall sleep on the third door on the right, next to my room.\" Carmen just nodded, not showing any emotion. Gary didn't like the sleeping arrangements. Carmen next to this creep? He noticed that his room was the furthest from Carmen's. Figures. \"I need to tell Cook to set four other places at the table. I will be back in 15 minutes. In the meantime, there are clothes in each room. Change into them and freshen up a bit.\" Everyone nodded. Why are we being so obedient? Carmen thought as she went into her room. Wow. Its like he knew we were coming. She looked around. There was a vanity with a gilded mirror in the corner. The four poster bed had an embroidered canopy and silk covers. A closet was open, revealing clothes. A window looked out into the sea. There was an adjoining bathroom with a full length mirror and a sink. She quickly washed her face in the bathroom and undressed. Looking through the clothes, she saw that they were all her size. Something is not right... she thought. She chose a light blue skirt with a white peasant blouse. The skirt was knee length and spread out when she spun around. Pretty. She put applied dark blue eyeliner and some clear lip gloss that she found in the drawer. Looking at the clock, she saw it was 15 minutes. She quickly threw some sapphire studs in her ears and left the room. Everyone was already dressed and waiting for Carlos to show them the dining room. \"Somethings not right,\" Juni was saying. \"All our clothes are our sizes and the rooms fit our taste exactly.\" \"That's true. You should see my room,\" Carmen said as she walked up to the little group. \"Carmen...wow.\" Gary said. \"You look...great.\" She smiled. \"So do you.\" She noticed that he wore kakies with a dark red shirt. Juni rolled his eyes but Gerti giggled. \"We all look great,\" she said. She wore a pink halter dress and white sandals. Her hair was down, which was rare for her. Just then, Carlos arrived. \"I hope I haven't kept you waiting too long,\" he said with a smile. \"Not long at all,\" Juni said. Gary smirked, but Carlos just ignored him. \"You all chose appropriate clothing,\" he said instead. He looked from Juni to Gerti, completely ignoring Gary, who just glared at him. His gaze switched to Carmen and his lips curled into a seductive smile. \"Especially you, milady.\" Carmen blushed as his eyes ran down her body. \"So about that dinner,\" Gerti said. Carlos tore his eyes away from Carmen. \"Right. Of course. We'll have dinner on deck. Please, follow me.\" Carmen stayed close to her brother and Gerti as they followed the prince. After walking in silence for a couple minutes, Carlos said \"Its not fair that you know who I am, but I don't know who you are. Please tell me your names.\" \"I am Gerti and this is my brother Gary.\" Carlos nodded and said \"and you are?\" \"Carmen and my brother Juni,\" Carmen replied. \"Carmen...that's a beautiful name. I can tell that it fits you perfectly,\" he said softly. She just smiled and nodded. They reached a door which Carlos held open for everyone but Gary. Gary glared at his back, noting the obvious insult. Wow, Carmen thought. He really went all out. Right next to a pool was a round glass table set with fine china and wine glasses. The silverware was engraved with intricate designs and each chair had an embroidered cushion. Carlos pulled out a chair and gestured Carmen to sit in it. She smiled a little and sat down. Then he sat down next to her. As he did, he looked at Gary and smirked. Idiot. \"Well, tonight's dish is Cook's famous sautéed haddock with potatoes and fresh veggies.\" He pulled a champagne bottle from the ice cooler next to him and poured some in Carmen's glass and then his own. \"Oh, I don't drink,\" she said. Gary saw a flicker of expression on Carlos' face as he turned away from Carmen. It looked like...frustration? Anger? Both? He caught Gerti's eye, who nodded. She noticed too. So did Juni. But it was gone in a second. \"Well, its there if you want to try some,\" he said pleasantly. Then the doors opened and five waiters came out with salads and set them before the seated guests. Then they were gone as swiftly as they came in. \"Eat! Eat! I will not treat you like prisoners and give you disgusting food. Nor will I throw you in a dungeon or overboard. I am not a cruel person.\" Carefully, they picked up they're forks and began eating. As if it was timed, Carlos' cell went off. He answered it. \"Yes? Really? OK. I will be down in a moment.\" He snapped it shut.\"I am deeply sorry, but I must leave you for several moments. Cook needs help with one of the..servants. I will be back in time for the main course.\" \"That's fine,\" Gerti said. He got up and left the deck. He was whistling as he walked to the kitchen. \"So, you may put it in the dish,\" he said as he pushed the door open. \"Of course, your highness,\" Cook said. He reached inside a cupboard and grabbed a small glass vial. It wasn't labeled, and it was a clear liquid. Carlos watched as Cook poured a little sauce into a bowl. He then unscrewed the vial and poured three drops. Finally, he poured the sauce on the middle dish and watched it spread. \"Good man, good man,\" Carlos said. He turned to a servant. \"You will give it to her, Phillip. You're chance to redeem yourself.\" The man named Phillip nodded. \"Anything for your highness,\" he said. \"I must go. Remember, it is the older girl who gets that dish.\" Phillip nodded again. Carlos turned on his heel and left the kitchen. She will be mine. Once she's taken that, it will be easy as cake to make her come to me, he thought. \"The dishes are on there way,\" he said as he came on deck. Right on cue, the servants came out with five dishes. They cleared the table first then laid a plate down in front of everyone. \"Smells delicious,\" Juni said. He took the first bite. \"It is delicious.\" Carlos laughed. \"I am glad you think that. Cook is the finest chef in Monaco.\" After about 20 minutes or small talk, Carmen set her fork down. \"Are you OK?\" Gary asked her. \"I don't feel good,\" she replied softly. \"I think I will retire for the rest of the night.\" \"I will escort you to your room,\" Gary said quickly. He shot a glance at Carlos who looked upset. No matter. He's not going anywhere near her. Not while I'm around. \"If you need anything, Carmen, don't hesitate to ring the bell in your room,\" Carlos said. \"I will. Thank you. The meal was wonderful.\" Gary helped her up and together they walked back to their rooms. \"Would you mind staying with me tonight?\" Carmen asked. Gary looked at her in surprise. \"If you want, then yes.\" She looked so grateful then. \"I'm scared of him, Gary,\" she whispered. \"There's something that he's planning, and whatever it is doesn't feel right.\" Gary nodded. \"I agree. You need to stay away from him. We all should, really.\" They reached their quarters. \"Let me grab something suitable for bed.\" Carmen smiled. Just then someone whispered \"hey!\" They both turned and saw one of the waiters hiding in a corner. \"There's something you must know.\" \"What is it?\" \"The prince drugged you, Ms. Carmen. That's why you aren't feeling well.\" Gary almost swore aloud. Carmen went practically white. \"What?\" Gary whispered fiercely. \"Its a love potion. If you kiss him, you'll fall 'in love' with him. Its not true love, granted, but its enough. The only thing that can break it is if your own true love kisses you. You can trust me. I don't agree with anything the prince is doing. I am loyal to Their Majesties the King and Queen. However, I was dragged (against my will) to this ship. Now, I must go. I will come to you later with the real plans that the prince has devised.\" \"Thank you,\" Carmen said. She was shaking so Gary put his coat around her shoulders even though she wasn't cold. Gary quickly grabbed some clothes from his (small) room then they went to Carmen's room. Gary locked the door while Carmen changed in the bathroom. \"If you don't mind, would you sleep here for the rest of our stay?\" Carmen called to him. \"Of course.\" He heard the sink turn on. While he undressed, he looked around the room. Beautiful room , he thought. He outdid himself. I wonder what his intentions are with Carmen. Something not good. He must have known that we were coming. He wouldn't have this set up just for some random girl. \"This is all that was given to me. I hope it doesn't bother you,\" he heard Carmen say as she opened the door. She came out in a black, silk nightgown. It was embroidered with blue and green flowers. She had covered herself with a tan silk robe. She looked beautiful. \"Is it too princess-y?\" she asked. \"N-n-no,\" Gary stuttered. \"You look beautiful in it.\" Carmen smiled. He noticed that she wasn't shaking and her color wasn't as pale as before. She pulled back the cover of the king-size bed and slipped in. Looking him straight in the eye, she smirked. \"You're not going to sleep on the couch all night are you?\" she asked, a little seductively. \"Are you sure you want me in you're bed?\" he asked. \"I'd feel safer...\" she didn't even finish the sentence. Gary had jumped off the couch and was under her covers in 5 seconds. She giggled. \"Wow, Gary...\" \"Shh...\" he said. They looked in each other's eyes. Both could see the longing in the eyes staring back at them. Just like the movies, they leaned in at the same time. Carmen closed her eyes; then felt them: his lips pressed against hers. It started out gentle at first, but soon turned into a passionate kiss. Carmen felt his arms around her waist pulling her closer to him. She put her arms around his neck to get more comfortable. After about 10 minutes they broke apart. \"Wow...\" Carmen said. \"That was wonderful...\" \"Was that you're first kiss?\" Gary asked her. She blushed and nodded. \"Well, you felt like a pro. That's a compliment.\" She smiled shyly, then kissed him on the cheek. He put one hand gently on her face and she covered it with her hand. \"Carmen...I have wanted to do that ever since I first met you. But I was too afraid to make a move...\" \"You? Afraid to make a move? The bad boy of the OSS afraid of something? Haven't heard that in...well, never,\" she teased. \"Yeah, well. Carmen, I like you. A lot. Will you...\" he paused, gathering courage. \"Will you be my girlfriend?\" Without any hesitation, she said yes. He leaned in and kissed her again, even more passionately than before. Finally, after what seemed like forever, they pulled away. \"You're tired. Go to sleep. I'll be here to protect you.\" Carmen nodded. \"Good night, my prince,\" she whispered. She turned over and snuggled close to him. Gary wrapped his arms around her, and kissed her gently on the cheek. \"Good night, princess.\" So, how did you like it? It was longer than the first chapter. I could have ended it in several spots, but for some reason, it didn't seem right. So I chose to end it here. And I know that it was kind of sudden when Carmen and Gary started making out, but my reasoning is \"when you don't know what's going to happen to you, live the moment and deal with the consequences later.\" Or something along the line of that. I'm sure you all understand. Thanks for reading and don't forget to review! NEXT CHAPTER: What Lies Beneath the Truth[Chapter 3] Even though I wish I could be creative as the writers, I am not. So everything here, with the exception of a few characters, belongs to them and whoever else owns Spy Kids. Not me. Unfortunately. Chapter Three: What Lies Beneath the Truth Everyone had retired for the evening when Carlos went to the Captain's quarters. \"Your Highness,\" said Captain Javier, as he entered the room. \"Is everything set for tomorrow?\" \"Yes, Your Highness.\" \"Good.\" They stood watching the moon rise over the waters for several moments. \"Your Highness? May I be so bold to ask you a question?\" Carlos nodded. \"Why didn't you just do throw those kids overboard? If they escape, they could spoil everything that we have worked so hard to achieve.\" Carlos chuckled. \"Javier, my friend. Did you not see them?\" He shook his head. \"The older girl, Carmen. She is quite a beauty. And I can tell there's this fire within her that is just waiting to be awakened.\" Javier smirked. \"And Your Highness will be the way to awaken her spirit?\" \"Of course. I have to deal with Gary. He is no rival, but I have to make sure that he's out of the way before I make my final move.\" He paused. \"She should be asleep now. Turn on all the cameras in their rooms.\" \"Of course.\" Javier turned and flipped 4 switches, which activated 3 cameras in each bedroom. A bookcase slid from view, revealing 12 TVs. \"Good, they're all asleep,\" Carlos said as he watched each camera. But then he stopped. \"Your Highness?\" \"Gary's missing from his bedroom. Get me 6 guards up here at once!\" Javier picked up the microphone but was stopped by Carlos' sudden exclamation of anger. \"They are together in the same bed!\" Javier walked over, microphone still in hand and followed his prince's gaze. So much for no rivalry , he thought wryly. The top corner TV showed Carmen sleeping, with Gary's arm around her waist. \"Your Highness. Please, calm yourself. We will deal with this...boy tomorrow, if that is your wish.\" Carlos took a couple deep breaths. \"No, that's too soon. We must wait until after. If we do it before, Carmen will suspect something.\" \"But wouldn't they suspect if we got rid of him after?\" \"It won't matter. Because by that time, she'll be mine, and her brother and Gerti sent home with no memory of this whatsoever.\" \"You are always thinking ahead, Your Highness,\" Javier praised. \"Thank you, Captain. Now, I want a man watching these cameras 24/7. I want to know of any get together's or meetings. They can't do anything, but I still want them watched. Especially Gary and Carmen. If they are alone together, notify me immediately.\" Javier nodded. \"You can set the microphone down. No need to call them now. Anyway, I am going to retire for the night. If anything goes wrong, let me know.\" \"Yes, Your Highness. You can count on me.\" Carlos nodded and left the room. Javier is a good man , he thought as he walked. Perhaps, when I become king, I'll make him Prime Minister or some other high post. He deserves it. Damn, I forgot to ask how close to land we are. Oh well. I'll find out in the morning. We can't be too far. He reached the sleeping quarters and as he passed Carmen's door, jealousy began brewing. I will have her. No one can resist becoming royalty. She'll be a princess for a week or so, and then she shall be my queen. The only thing is getting rid of Gary. Killing him would be too obvious, it needs to be something more subtle. He unlocked his door and threw the keys on the table. Finally, exhaustion won the battle, and Carlos collapsed on the bed without changing. He was asleep in minutes. * * * * * * * Juni woke up the following morning with a major headache. Ugh , he thought. I wonder if they have anything that can treat throbbing heads. I feel like my head is going to explode. Just then, a knock sounded on the door. \"Who is it?\" he called. \"Gerti. Come on, get up. Carmen and Gary have already eaten breakfast and are in the lounge.\" \"Breakfast? Why didn't anyone wake me?\" \"We tried. You didn't answer.\" Juni sat up. \"Give me 10.\" \"Fine. I'll be in my room so just knock.\" I hope this guy lets us go soon. We haven't had contact with HQ since yesterday evening. They'll probably send someone after us. I wonder what this guy is planning. Probably the usual: world domination , he thought as he dressed. After making sure he looked presentable, he left his room and walked over to Gerti's room. \"Gerti?\" he called after knocking. The door opened. \"I was wondering when you would be ready. Its been 12 minutes instead of 10,\" Gerti said with a smile. \"Oh, come on. Two minutes late? Its not that bad!\" Juni laughed. \"Whatever. Come on, whats-his-name is waiting for us. * * * * * * * Gary and Carmen sat the Sun Parlor waiting for Gerti and Juni to join them. They sat in silence, inwardly admiring the beautiful room. Unlike the rest of the ship, this was filled with beautiful furniture, vases and paintings. There was a particular painting that interested Carmen. It was a portrait of a young woman dressed in a pale pink gown. Her hair was pulled back with two diamond clips and she wore a simple silver chain with a diamond pendent and matching tear drop earrings. \"That is my mother's wedding portrait,\" a voice said from behind. Both Gary and Carmen jumped; neither had heard the prince enter the room. \"She died when I was 12,\" Carlos said as he sat down next to Carmen. \"Her name was Clara and her father was a rich merchant. My father fell in love with her and she with him. They married, despite attempts to stop the couple. It turns out that she was fit to be queen, because the people loved her. She was deeply mourned when she passed.\" \"I am so sorry to hear that she died. And you so young...\" Carmen said politely. \"She was sick for a long time. After the birth of my younger sister, she became ill. The doctors did not know what was wrong with her. They tried everything. She lost the battle the day of my sister's second birthday. To this day, they cannot name her illness. Two years later, my father remarried. Unlike my mother, the Lady Alicia was suitable and was favored among my father's advisors.\" Just then, Gerti entered the parlor followed by Juni. \"Good morning, sunshine,\" Gary said with a smile. \"Have a nice sleep?\" \"Shut it, Giggles,\" Juni said. \"So I slept in...\" Carmen laughed. \"You too, sis.\" She just laughed harder. \"Ahem. If you will please seat yourselves.\" Carlos waited until the two newcomers sat. \"You are probably wondering why I staged my own kidnapping.\" Everyone nodded. \"Well, to be completely honest, my step-mother manipulates my father. She's done horrible things to the country, but its always hushed so the world does not interfere. She has raised the taxes on the people so high, that the people have little time to enjoy life. I know that sounds selfish, but Monaco is a very rich country. Its people have always valued their lifestyle, but they have always given help to those in need. It is this reason that we have prospered.\" He paused while two maids entered with several glasses of water were offered to the company. He resumed speaking when they left. \"In case you haven't noticed, we haven't offered assistance to any countries in need. The world has been so caught up in the affairs of the major powers, that they have forgotten the small country on the corner of Africa. The queen has made sure that we stay isolated unless something happens that she can use for her advantage. In any case, she has drained our country's resources. So, I have decided to stop her. She has always hated me, due to the fact that she is past child-bearing age and has no children if her own. She won't harm me, because despite her poisoning my father's mind, she cannot touch him when it comes to his only son and heir. I have decided to take matters into my own hands.\" He stopped to take a sip from his water. \"I will rally the people in a rebellion. They love me and my sister and would do anything to rid the cruelties of the queen. As a force, I am sure we will be able to defeat her, and save our country and my father, from ruin.\" Carlos looked at his captives. Carmen and Gerti looked confused whereas both Juni and Gary looked disbelieving. \"Then why hold us hostage? We won't tell, and besides these are Monaco's affairs. Why would we bring the US in? First off, the government wouldn't listen to several teenagers even if they are part of the Spy Kids organization. And secondly, they wouldn't interfere unless they saw reason,\" Gary said. \"I am sorry but I can't risk it. Besides, I think we could become good friends,\" Carlos replied, looking pointedly at Carmen. \"Well, I would prefer to go home,\" Juni said. Gerti nodded in agreement. \"I'm sorry, but like I said, I cannot risk it. Anyway, you all have the privilege to roam the ship. My servants know that you are to be treated with respect and whatever you need or want, do not hesitate to ask them.\" Gerit pouted. This guy certainly knows how to make a deal , she thought. They all nodded in response. No one was happy with this arrangement but they had no way to escape. They were in the middle of the ocean, with no way to contact they're parents or HQ so what else could they do? There was nothing they could do. But together, they would live through this. At least they knew that the prince had no intention of killing them. At least, they hoped he wouldn't kill him. How did you like it? I apologize for not updating sooner, I've been having writer's block with all of my fanfics. Its quite frustrating, to be honest. But anyway, I hope you enjoyed it! Hopefully, the next chapter will be up soon. Key word: hopefully. NEXT CHAPTER: Carmen's Choice[Chapter 4] I do not own the idea of Spy Kids nor the characters. Except for Carlos and any invented characters that I have written in for this particular fic. Chapter Four: Carmen's Choice After excusing himself, Prince Carlos left the room, saying there was some business he needed to attend to. After he was gone, the Corteses and the Giggles sat in silence, each absorbing what had just been told to them. \"That doesn't make any sense,\" Gary said. \"Why not? He seemed perfectly truthful to me,\" Juni said. \"I don't know. It just...seems like he's trying to get us to trust him. Last night, one of the waiters told me and Carmen something. He had said that he was loyal to the King and Queen and that he was dragged aboard without his consent. So something doesn't seem right.\" \"Well, either Carlos is lying, or the waiter is lying,\" Gerti said. \"I don't think the waiter was lying,\" Carmen said quietly. Everyone looked at her, confused. \"The waiter also said that Carlos drugged me, which makes sense, since I felt...strange this morning.\" \"WHAT?!\" Juni asked. \"Shh, Juni, don't yell,\" Gerti said \"Why would he drug just Carmen and not the rest of us?\" \"Because he wants me for himself,\" Carmen whispered. \"What did you say?\" Juni asked. He was livid, no one hurt his family without punishment. \"Its nothing. I'm going to go lay down. I feel...strange again.\" She stood up to leave but Juni stopped her. \"What's going on, Carmen? Please, tell me,\" he said, concern etched in his voice. She looked at her younger brother; confusion was written all over her face. \"I don't know.\" She then turned and ran from the room. \"Carmen!\" Gary yelled after her. \"Let her go, Gary. She'll be fine,\" Gerti said. \"No, she won't! What if that...that creep does something to her?\" \"What is going on , Giggles?\" Juni asked. His voice was filled with venom and he was glaring at Gary. Gary sighed. \"Well, Carlos did drug Carmen because she was up at 6 this morning throwing up everything she ate last night. That's why she looked a little paler than usual.\" Gerti nodded. \"Yeah, she didn't look like her usual self. She seemed to get more confused as Carlos was talking to her. You can stop glaring at my brother, Juni.\" Juni stopped. \"What did this waiter say about the drug?\" \"Potion, actually. He said that if Carlos kisses the Carmen, then she'll fall in love with him. It won't be true love, though, because he said that whoever is her true love, will be able to revive her.\" \"How?\" \"By kissing her.\" Gary blushed, which did not go unnoticed by Juni. But he just remained silent. \"Its like your typical fairytale,\" Gerti mused. \"It must be a Monaco trick...because I have heard of no such thing. Well, I have heard of it, but only in princess stories.\" \"Whatever it is, we still need to keep Carmen away from Carlos. He looks at her like she's something to eat,\" Juni said. He paused, thinking. \"Did you sleep in my sister's room, Gary?\" Gary didn't answer, he just avoided the younger man's eyes. \"You did! You little player!\" he cried \"Shush, Juni!\" Gerti said, but she was smiling. She knew how much her brother thought about Carmen and she was happy that his wish came true. \"Nothing happened!\" Gary said in defense. \"She asked me to stay with her.\" \"Uh huh. Whatever. Just don't hurt her, because if you do, you'll rue the day you ever laid eyes on her.\" Gerti chuckled. Men. \"I won't. I promise.\" \"I'm going to check on her,\" Gerti said. \"She may need some girl time.\" \"What are am I going to do?\" Juni complained. \"Oh, you're a big boy. You'll find something to do.\" Gary smirked. \"Shut it, Giggles.\" \"Well, I'm going to try to find that waiter guy. I think he wanted to tell us Carlos' real plans. If, that is, it turns out that Carlos is lying to us,\" Gary said. \"Let's meet up around 3:00 in Carmen's room. By then, the waiter will have told me what is really going on and we can figure out what to do about it.\" \"I agree. I'll talk to Carmen and let her know the plans.\" \"Fine by me. I think I'll explore the ship.\" \"Good idea. You're finally thinking, Cortez.\" Juni didn't respond. He was too busy looking at something. \"What's wrong, Juni?\" \"Nothing,\" he muttered. \"I'll tell you later.\" \"Suit yourself,\" Gary replied. * * * * * * * Carlos sat in the Captain's quarters, sipping a glass of wine and watching the cameras before him. He saw how Carmen ran from the room and her brother's concern. He observed how Gerti was the peacemaker and watched Gary's emotions flicker across his face. True, he couldn't hear what they were saying, but it seemed like they were discussing Carmen. \"Did they buy it, Your Highness?\" Javier asked from behind. \"I don't know, Captain. I guess we'll have to wait and see. But I do believe that the potion is working on Ms. Cortez. She seems to be getting weaker by the moment.\" Carlos turned away from the cameras to face Javier. \"Please remind me how this potion works, Your Highness?\" \"Its basic, really. She starts to show the symptoms of a very bad cold or flu. Then, after a few hours, the symptoms will miraculously disperse. It is then that I will make my move. You see, during the hours that she feels sick, she will lose her sense of trust with her friends. I guess you could say that the sickness brainwashes her. All I have to do is sympathize with her so she gains my trust. That's when I kiss her. And, if all goes right, she'll be mine by tomorrow morning.\" He smiled. \"It will go right. Already she was showing signs of confusion.\" \"Brilliant, Your Highness. Just brilliant.\" \"I know. And after she's mine, we can dispense of Gary Giggles. I think we'll get rid of Juni too. He's beginning to annoy me. Gerti can stay...she would be a good friend to the newly made princess.\" \"Of course, my prince. Whatever you say.\" * * * * * * * Things just don't seem right... Gerti thought as she walked back to the sleeping quarters. If what Gary said is true, about Carlos lying to us...but what could be his motive? Is it that he doesn't trust us? No, that's too obvious...there has to be some other reason. But what could it be? Gerti reached Carmen's door and knocked. \"Who is it?\" \"Gerti. Mind if I come in?\" \"Um...hang on.\" Gerti heard a drawer slam and then the door opened. \"Are you OK?\" she asked as she walked into the room. \"I don't know...I feel like I'm losing my mind...\" Carmen said as she laid on the bed. Gerti sat down beside her and felt her forehead. \"Carmen! You're burning up!\" \"I know,\" she replied wearily. \"You rest here, I'm going to find Gary and Juni. They need to-\" \"NO!\" Carmen cut her off. \"Please, don't tell them. I don't want...I couldn't stand Gary or Juni seeing me like this.\" \"They care about you, Carmen. They would want you to get better and I'm sure Gary would do anything to make sure that you'll be alright. Juni too,\" she added. \"No. Please. I'll tell them if it gets any worse. I promise.\" Gerti knew that she wouldn't tell them, but she didn't say that. \"OK. I won't. Do you need anything? Water or something else to drink?\" \"No, I'm fine. If you don't mind, I think I'm going to take a nap. I'll come find you if I feel better.\" \"OK. Well, I'm going to explore the ship. Maybe, when you're feeling better, we can tan on the deck or something,\" Gerti replied. Carmen smiled slightly. \"I would like that.\" Then she slowly closed her eyes, feigning sleep. Gerti looked at the older girl, and shook her head. I'm sorry Carmen, but Gary and Juni need to know. Carlos is definitely planning something. We just need to figure out what that is . * * * * * * * Juni was sitting on the deck watching an endless sky meet with an endless ocean. It seems to go on forever , he thought. Its so peaceful here. I bet Mom and Dad would love it out here. Mom...Dad...I hope they're OK. We haven't talked to them since yesterday morning. They probably know something isn't right. Maybe they'll send a search party. He turned away from the railing to see flushed Gerti come on deck. \"Juni...\" she said as she caught her breath. \"Gerti! What is it? Wait, sit down for a sec before you start talking.\" She shook her head, but sat anyway. Juni waited patiently for her to calm herself. \"Where's Gary?\" she finally asked. \"Probably-\" \"I'm here. What's wrong Gerti?\" They turned to see Gary come up a different staircase than Gerti. \"Not here...\" Both boys nodded. They followed her to the sleeping quarters, each wondering what had her so worried. When they finally entered her room, she started to say something, but stopped. \"I'm sorry to hear that, Ms. Cortez.\" \"Please, just Carmen.\" Juni's eyes widened as he recognized the male's voice. \"Carlos!\" Gerti mouthed. Gary nodded, hands balled up in fists. Juni out a hand on his shoulder, his eyes telling the older boy to calm himself. \"Of course, Carmen.\" \"Anyway, its OK. Maybe we weren't meant to be.\" \"Sometimes a girl needs to wait for Mr. Right to show up.\" They heard Carmen sigh. \"You're right.\" \"Well, I better go check on our status. I need to see how close to land we are. Umm...would you care to have dinner with me, Carmen?\" There was a pause. \"I would love to.\" \"Great! Put on something nice! I have something that I want to show you.\" \"OK.\" They heard her breathless giggle, then the door closed softly. After waiting several minutes, Gary exploded. \"That creep! He's turning her against us! That little...argh!!!!! What does he want with Carmen? She must fit into his plans somehow! But how?\" \"Gary!\" Gerti's voice broke her brother's rant. He stopped and looked at her. \"Calm yourself! If you continue yelling, you'll send every man on board to my room. Do you want someone to hear?\" Gary sighed. \"Well, she sounds better...\" Gerti said. \"What do you mean?\" \"She was burning with a fever an hour or so ago, and she looked really pale. But she sounds as if she's feeling better...\" \"He wants something with Carmen. And somehow she fits into his plan,\" Juni said quietly. He paused. \"He has to have known beforehand that we were coming,\" he said finally. \"All our clothes fit. The rooms are exactly to our tastes and even though he acts like he never heard of us, there's something about his reactions that just say that he knew we were going to be sent for him.\" Gerti nodded. \"Juni's right. There is no way he could have just guessed. That's not possible. But the thing is, how did he find that information? Someone must have infiltrated the OSS without anyone's knowledge. But how? Or could it have been somebody from inside? Because if that's so, then we have to warn HQ before it gets worse. We need to figure this out. Fast. Gary, have you found the waiter?\" \"No. And I don't want to ask in case someone reports him.\" \"Well, it looks like we're on our own,\" Juni said. They sat in silence for several minutes, each wondering what is going to happen to them. \"I'm going to check on Carmen,\" Gary said. \"Is that a good idea?\" Gerti asked. \"I don't care. I need to make sure she's OK. And I have to convince her not to go to dinner with Carlos.\" \"Well, be careful. She's very vulnerable right now. Which is probably why Carlos took advantage of her.\" He nodded. \"Oh!\" Juni said suddenly. \"Before we leave, we need to watch our every move.\" The Giggles looked at him questioningly. \"We're being watched. I saw a camera in the Sun Parlor.\" Gary swore aloud. \"That's final then. He knew we were coming...\" Gerti said quietly. She looked at her brother, concerned. \"Be careful, Gary,\" she warned. \"We can't afford to risk our stay here. Do the cameras have speakers, Juni?\" \"No, I don't think so.\" \"Good. Everyone needs to be on their guard. But be discreet. We can't have them suspecting anything.\" Gary stood up to leave. \"Gary?\" He turned to look back. \"Please be careful with her. We can't have her turning completely against us,\" Juni said quietly. He nodded. \"I will.\" * * * * * * * Carmen sat at the vanity brushing her hair when there was a knock on the door. \"Come in!\" Gary entered the room, smiling. \"How are you feeling, Carmen?\" he asked. \"Much better, thank you,\" she said politely. She didn't bother to turn around, but continued to brush her hair. I must be wary around him. I thought he cared for me...but now I'm not so sure, she thought. \"Good, I'm glad. I was wondering if you would like to go on deck with me and watch the sunset.\" \"I can't, I'm sorry. I have dinner plans with Carlos.\" She looked apologetic, but her tone told Gary that she wasn't sorry at all. \"Oh. I thought you were going to stay away from him.\" \"That was my original plan. But he's such a sweet guy! And he really cares about me,\" Carmen replied. \"He made me some soup while I was sick; there must have been something in it, because I don't feel feverish and I didn't throw up after I ate it.\" Gary was trying his hardest to not get angry with her. He knew it was the drug that was slipped into her food last night that was making her talk this way. But he couldn't help but feel jealous. \"What about the potion? Remember, the one that would make you fall in love with him once he kissed you?\" \"I asked him about it, actually. He said that the waiter was against him and his cause, and that he was trying to turn us against him. He sounded so sincere, that I believe him. Besides, you remember how I can tell when someone's lying. And his body language and tone didn't show signs of lying.\" \"But he wants you for himself! He wants you and he's going to say anything to have you, Carmen!\" Gary surprised himself with his anger, but he couldn't take it anymore. He hated how she smiled when she was talking about Carlos. He hated how she seemed lighter, as if she were on a cloud. But most of all, he hated Carlos for turning her against him. \"And what about us? Don't you remember last night? We finally expressed our feelings for each other! Are you just going to throw all that away? I know we only had one night, but to me, it felt like an eternity of bliss. I finally had you in my arms, after dreaming for nights on end of holding you. I think you've forgotten who you really are, Carmen Cortez.\" Carmen whipped around and glared at him. \"How can you say that?! I know who I am! But I don't know who you are! You claim that you've changed, but I don't think you really have. I think your as selfish as you were when we first met! I think you only care about yourself and your image. And to date a guy who only cares for himself is not my idea of a perfect relationship,\" she said. She was breathing hard, and her eyes were wide; she looked livid. Gary stared at her, shocked. He's really twisted her mind! \"At least Carlos shows me who he really is! He cares about me! Unlike you!\" Carmen stopped herself before she said something that she knew she would regret. Deep down, she still had feelings for Gary. She loved him, but the potion was warping her mind. She remembered how she felt when she was in his arms but only vaguely. Her outburst scared her. Had she really said those things? But it was too late to take them back: the damage was done. Its the potion! she thought. But he deserved it...he hasn't changed at all. Gary could see how she was struggling with her thoughts. \"So that's it, then? Are we breaking up?\" he asked quietly. \"We were never going out, Giggles,\" she replied. \"I think you should go. I need to change and Carlos will be here in a bit.\" She was quiet now, her anger spent. \"Carmen-\" \"Just go!\" Gary looked at her sadly then turned to go. Before he left, he glanced back to see her looking at herself in the mirror, tears streaming down her face. Silently, he closed the door behind him. He felt depressed and angry. He had just lost the girl he loved and unless she began to trust him again, there was no way for her to come back to him. I wish we had never accepted this mission. But its too late for regrets. Carlos is going to pay for what he's done to Carmen! Turning her against her friends and family is something that I cannot forgive! Oh, is he going to pay!! How did you all like it? I hope you enjoyed all the drama. It wasn't too much, was it? I know it was longer than any other chapter I've written so I hope that you weren't bored with it. But anyway, I'm leaving for Disney on June 17th, so I may not update before then. It depends on how much time I have. So if I don't, I'll try to update as soon as I can after I get back. Thanks for reading and don't forget to review!!! NEXT CHAPTER: To Kiss or Not to Kiss?[Chapter 5] I do not own Spy Kids. I repeat, I do not own Spy Kids. Although, I do own Carlos and any other characters that are not part of the Spy Kids franchise. Chapter Five: To Kiss or Not to Kiss? Gerti and Juni sat on the deck, watching the sunset over the blue water, but both were so preoccupied with their thoughts that they weren't appreciating the beauty of the sky. \"I wonder how Gary's talk with Carmen went,\" Juni said, breaking the long silence. \"I don't know, Juni. But its been a while since he knocked on her door,\" Gerti replied. \"Should we check?\" \"No. I think it would be best to let this play out. I think Gary will be able to get through to her...at least, I hope so.\" As if on cue, Gary walked up the stairs and sat down next to Juni. He looked hurt and angry. Gerti was wise enough to remain silent, and gestured to Juni that he should too. Then, after what seemed like an hour, he spoke. \"We lost her.\" Just that simple phrase was enough to make Juni red. \"What do you mean, we lost her?\" he asked, his voice deadly quiet. \"I don't know. Carlos has turned her against us. It must be that drug that he gave her to make her think that we don't care about her.\" Gary sighed. \"I tried to get through to her, but she seemed so angry. I didn't know what else to do, so I left. But I did try, I really did.\" \"Should one of us go talk to her?\" \"No. We should try after her dinner with Carlos. Anything we say before then might ruin it even more than it already is,\" Gerti said. \"But what if she kisses him at dinner? By that time, it would be too late!\" Juni exclaimed. \"Shh! Your right, but there's nothing else we can do. We'll have to cross our fingers and hope that she won't kiss him,\" she replied. \"Gerti's right. There's nothing else we can do,\" Gary said. \"But-\" \"Has your sister ever kissed on the first date, Juni?\" \"No.\" \"That's what I thought. If Carmen, our Carmen, is still inside, she won't.\" \"I just don't want to take that risk...\" \"I know. But there's nothing else we can do without making it worse.\" Juni sighed. \"I know. But I wish there was something we could do.\" \"We all do.\" * * * * * * * Carmen had just gotten out of the shower and was choosing something to wear when a knock on the door startled her. \"Who is it?\" she called. \"A messenger for Ms. Carmen Cortez,\" a voice replied. \"Come in then.\" The door opened and a girl, a little younger than herself, entered her room. \"His Highness, Prince Carlos, requests your presence at a party on land tonight. We will be landing at Ft. Hope later this evening. He said that after dinner, you will be allowed to freshen up and then he will escort you to the party.\" \"Tell His Highness that I am delighted to accept his offer.\" \"I will tell him, miss.\" The girl curtsied and left the room. Carmen giggled to herself. A party! I wonder who will be there? Oh! I hope I don't mess up and embarrass him! I would die if I did that! She thought. Returning to the closet of gowns, she started to choose her favorites. This one will flatter my skin color....I love this lilac! Oh, the black is pretty! But everyone at the party will be wearing black. I should have asked what to wear! Another knock disturbed her thoughts. \"Come in!\" \"Ms. Cortez?\" It was a young man this time. \"Hm?\" \"His Highness, Prince Carlos, has sent this gown to you. It was his mother's and he would be honored if you would wear it to tonight's dinner and party.\" He handed her a wrapped package and, bowing, left the room. Hands trembling, she opened the box. Oh, its beautiful!!! This is the one! She ran to her dressing room and quickly slipped on the chemise, and then the gown. She then went to her vanity and began putting on her make-up. After, she went to the box on the dresser that contained priceless jewelry. Carlos had sent her the box, telling her to take whatever would look well with her gown. Looking at herself in the mirror, she knew she was beautiful. The black silk gown was close-fitting, set to show her curves off. The bodice was embroidered with silver and lavender thread, and little pearls and diamonds were sewn into the intricate design. The light short sleeves fluttered out and the flowing skirt opened at the front, showing a silver petticoat. Her make-up was perfect; she had applied the perfect amount of blush and her lips had just a tint of red. As for her jewelry, she had chosen a simple chain with three hanging diamonds. She wore black silk gloves and a pearl and diamond bracelet which was woven with three delicate chains. She left her long, wavy hair down, knowing that anything else would seem too gaudy or would clash with a perfect outfit. If only Mom and Dad could see me. Mom would be proud...although I think Dad would be a little upset that his little girl is all grown up. She paused. Mom...Dad. I wonder if they know where I am. I do miss them. But...I do love being here, with Carlos. I wonder if there's a way I can contact them. I should ask...but not tonight. Tomorrow. I don't want to seem childish at dinner. A knock sounded on the door. That must be Carlos! She grabbed the purse that came with the dress and after looking at herself in the mirror one last time, she went to open the door. But instead of Carlos, it was Juni who was standing outside her door. \"Juni! What are you doing here?\" \"I thought we could talk...we haven't had a brother-sister talk in ages.\" He paused. \"And I miss that.\" Carmen sighed. \"I know, Juni. We're growing up, and we're being lead into different lives in the process. How about tomorrow we can sit on deck and talk? Carlos is taking me to dinner tonight and-\" She stopped herself. She didn't know if they knew about Ft. Hope. \"And...?\" \"And I miss it too...\" she said quietly. Good cover up! \"Promise that we'll talk tomorrow?\" \"I promise.\" Dammit, now I can't get out of it. Someone coughed from behind Juni. Carmen looked up and saw Carlos. \"If you'll excuse me, Juni. My date is here,\" she said with a smile. \"Oh. Right.\" Carmen closed the door and brushed past her brother, without giving him a second glance. \"Wow, Carmen, you look beautiful,\" Carlos said as he looked her up and down. \"I thank you for the gown. I am honored that you should lend me something of your mother's,\" she replied. \"Oh, its not a loan,\" he said as he took her arm and started leading her down the hall. \"Its not?\" Carlos chuckled. \"Its your's to keep. My mother would want someone as beautiful as you to have it.\" \"Oh! Thank you! I will treasure it always.\" \"Good. I'm glad you love it. I must say, you look stunning in it.\" Carmen blushed, but smiled. \"You look quite dashing yourself.\" She eyed his tuxedo. It was white, complimenting her black gown. His hair was slicked back and he held himself upright, but she could tell he was relaxed just by the way he walked. \"Thank you, but I can't compare to you.\" It was then that they reached a private salon. Holding the door open for her, she walked inside and gasped. The whole room was lit with hundreds of candles and vases full of red and white roses filled the tables. In the middle of the room was a table set with fine china and two candles. \"Its so romantic!\" \"That was my intention.\" She blushed again, but remained silent. \"Would you care to sit, milady?\" he asked as he pulled out a chair for her. \"Of course,\" she said with a smile. He pushed her in once she sat down. Then, taking the opposite chair from hers he sat down. \"Some wine?\" \"Well, why not.\" He poured her glass half way with wine and then his own. A door on the side wall opened and a man entered carrying a large platter with dishes filled with food. \"Talipia or chicken miss?\" \"Talipia please.\" He set a steaming plate with green beans, mashed potatoes and fish covered in a white sauce in front of her. \"I'll have the chicken, Fredrick,\" Carlos said without prompting. \"Of course, Your Highness.\" He set down a plate in front of Carlos that looked equally as delicious as Carmen's. \"Is there anything else I can get you before you start?\" \"No, that's all. Thank you, Fredrick.\" Fredrick bowed and left the room. Carmen unfolded her napkin and placed it on her lap. Then she took a bite of the talipia. \"Oh! Its delicious!\" \"I'm glad you like it. It is one of Chef's specialties.\" They continued to chat over dinner about unimportant things until Fredrick came and cleared their dishes. \"Are you hungry for desert, miss?\" \"No thank you. That talipia was very filling.\" Just then, a maid entered the room and curtsied. \"Your Highness, the Captain has asked me to inform you that we have landed at Ft. Hope.\" Carlos looked at his watch. \"Right on time, I see. Carmen, would you like to freshen up a bit before we leave for Lord William's party?\" \"Actually, if I can just use a bathroom to check my appearance, I think I'll be fine.\" \"That's fine. Down the hall and take the first left is where the ladies bathroom is located. I will wait for you here.\" Carmen nodded and left the parlor. Humming to herself as she walked, she found the ladies room exactly where he said it would be. She applied a little more lip gloss and smoothed her dress out. Satisfied she left the bathroom, only to bump into Gerti. \"Oh, Gerti. I'm sorry, I wasn't expecting to see you here,\" she said pleasantly. \"Not a problem. Oh wow, Carmen, you look absolutely stunning. Where are you going to be dressed up so?\" \"Just dinner with Carlos,\" she replied casually. \"Oh. Well, OK.\" \"I better get back, Gerti. He'll be wondering where I am.\" She doesn't seem completely lost...maybe its just Gary that she's mad at, Gerti thought as she watched Carmen walk away. * * * * * * * Carlos and Carmen were taken ashore by gondola. Taking her hand, Carlos helped Carmen steady herself as she walked on land. \"It takes a little getting used to after being at sea for so long,\" he said. \"I noticed,\" she replied with a smile. A black limo was parked at the end of the dock, with the door open and the driver standing at attention beside the car. \"Ah, it looks like Vinnie is here. Come, the party should be beginning soon. We don't want to be too early, nor too late.\" Carmen nodded. She stepped into the limo; Vinnie closed the door behind Carlos. As they rode in silence, she couldn't help but notice how handsome Carlos was. She blushed when he caught her looking at him. \"Carmen,\" he said softly. \"Hm?\" He had this look on his face, this soft, loving look. He gently took her hand and held it with both his hands. \"Carmen, I like you. A lot. And I want you to know that I will always be your friend. And perhaps, one day...\" \"What?\" \"Perhaps one day, soon, we could be more than friends.\" He looked right into her eyes, and she into his. \"Carlos,\" she whispered. As if they were in a movie, they both leaned in at the same time to kiss. \"I like you, too.\" Sorry it took me so long to update! I've been busy with work, and the fact that I was in Florida for a week and a half made it a little more difficult to finish this chapter. I hope you all liked it! And I'm sorry, I couldn't help but use a cliffhanger at the end of the chapter. Please don't hate me. I will update as soon as I can! Which, hopefully, will be sooner rather than later. Don't forget to review! NEXT CHAPTER: An Unfortunate Choice[Chapter 6] I do not own Spy Kids. Hey All, I am so sorry for not updating sooner! I know it's been several years since I last posted a chapter, but to be frank, I lost interest in this story. I really do feel bad, though! Life and other interests just got in the way. I feel like the only way for you to forgive me is if I post a really long chapter. And now, without further ado, I give you the newest addition to A Mission Worth Fighting For. Previously: \"Perhaps one day, soon, we could be more than friends.\" He looked right into her eyes, and she into his. \"Carlos,\" she whispered. As if they were in a movie, they both leaned in at the same time to kiss. \"I like you, too. Chapter Six: An Unfortunate Choice Suddenly, Carmen jerked back. \"I'm sorry, Carlos. But this is just a little too fast.\" Carlos nodded. \"I understand. Please forgive me.\" Carmen smiled, but the gleam in his eyes suggested otherwise. They talked of inconsequential things for the remainder of the ride. Finally, they pulled into a driveway that was blocked by a large gate. Carmen saw a security guard blocking the way, but upon recognizing the flag on the limo, he let them through. The gates swung open, and they drove on. Carmen looked at the grounds with interest. She was impressed at how simple the whole setup was; she was used to big mansions and beautiful landscaping, so she could appreciate the elegance of the grounds more so than other people could. The driveway was lined with tall shrubs cut perfectly, reminding Carmen of the ancient Greeks. The grass was green, and there were pathways that led to secret groves hidden by tall trees. In the distance, she could see a fountain surrounded by bushes lit up with lights. Up ahead, she could see a massive house lit up with what seemed like a thousand lights. A large balcony on the third floor was partially held up by great columns. The house itself was gaudy and expensive. Carmen hoped the inside wasn't as tasteless as the outside. Why do rich people feel the need to show off their wealth? She thought. \"Beautiful, isn't it?\" Carlos asked. She suppressed a snort. The grounds – beautiful; the house? Not so much. \"Breathtaking,\" she said instead. The limo pulled up to the front of the house. Vinnie stepped out and opened the door for them. Stepping out on to the red carpet, Carmen suppressed another snort. \"Shall we?\" Carlos asked. She took his arm, and together they walked up to the front door. A butler dressed in a black suit met them at the door. \"Welcome, Your Highness,\" he said. \"Lord Watling is expecting you.\" \"Thank you, George,\" Carlos said with a nod of his head. \"Shall I take your coat, miss - ?\" \"Cortez,\" Carmen replied. \"Ms. Cortez.\" Something flashed in George's face, something that only she saw. Was it recognition? She pondered briefly, but brushed it aside as she and Carlos followed George down the hall and up the Grand Staircase. They passed many rooms, most with closed doors. They finally reached a large double door guarded by two men, also in suits. \"His Highness, Prince Carlos is here. Please announce him,\" George said. The doors opened, and one of the men bellowed out Carlos' title. \"What is your name, miss?\" \"Uh, oh! Carmen Cortez, please.\" \"And his date, Ms. Carmen Cortez!\" Carmen looked around the room, trying to keep from showing her interest too much. The room was large, with marble floors and gilded columns. Plants lined the walls, along with couches and chairs for people to recline on. On the far side, a window the size of the entire wall gave a perfect view of the ocean. Two doors opened up to a balcony so people could take in the night air. Waiters moved in and out of the crowds, offering drinks and taking glasses. \"Ah! Prince Carlos! Welcome! Welcome to my humble home!\" \"Thank you, John,\" Carlos said to a man in a white tuxedo. \"May I present Ms. Carmen Cortez?\" Carmen held out her hand to shake, but John took it and brought it to his lips. \"Charmed,\" he murmured. \"The pleasure is all mine,\" Carmen said softly, her cheeks a light pink. He let her hand go and put on a dazzling smile. \"Please, mi casa, es su casa. Enjoy yourselves.\" What followed was a blur of bows, curtsies, and introductions that left Carmen in a daze. Due to her being Carlos' date, she was a sought after companion. Many people expressed surprise and pleasure at her ability to make small talk. Given her accent, everyone knew immediately that she was American. But despite her humble origins, she was a model in elegance and tact. The women were slightly jealous of her closeness to Carlos, since he was the most eligible bachelor in the country. The men were enchanted with her beauty and charm and many wished she was single. They spoke of this in hushed whispers, however, because it was a well-known fact that Carlos could be extremely jealous. \"Isabel, darling, quit staring. Just because she's a beauty and have men drooling at her every word doesn't make it right for you to be ogling at her,\" said an older woman. A small group of women had gathered together and were discussing Carmen. \"Mary, I can't help it. She is a commoner, yet she acts like she's royalty. I just don't understand it,\" Isabel replied. \"Yes, I do wonder where she got her manners. Americans are rude, conceited, and think they're entitled to everything,\" a young woman named Elizabeth said. \"Should we call her over then? I have to admit I'm rather curious to know her background. And to know what she's thinking of all this grandeur.\" The women nodded, so Isabel made her way over to invite Carmen to their group. \"Ladies, it pleases me that you invited me to your conversation,\" Carmen murmured upon arriving. \"It's our pleasure, Ms. Cortez. We have to admit, we are dying to know how you met the prince.\" \"To be honest, he saved me from a rather…emotionally abusive relationship. His Highness was very considerate when it came to my safety. He listened, when my ex-boyfriend didn't. He made it clear it was his pleasure to make me comfortable. It took a little bit to trust him, but when my ex-boyfriend and I got into a fight, I finally left him. It was then the prince proclaimed his feelings to me, that I knew I felt the same way about him,\" Carmen said. It was true that she exaggerated her relationship, but it was the truth. Gary had lied to her, and even though he never beat her, he made her think she was special and…wait. Was it really that bad? She asked herself. Gary made me feel beautiful, and he truly cared about me. But…Carlos…no! I can't think of this now. Gary lied to me. And that's final. And yet…I know we weren't together long… She turned her attention back to the women. \"Oh, it must have been awful! How dreadful!\" Isabel exclaimed. The women nodded in agreement. \"But His Highness was there to rescue you. Tell me, Ms. Cortez, where do you live in America?\" Mary asked. \"My family owns a large penthouse in Los Angeles but we have a mansion in Napa Valley. My parents own a large wine producing company. My brother and I grew up in a beautiful villa surrounded by orchids and flowers.\" The women were wise enough to suppress their surprise at her wealth. Brother? Juni! I wish he was here with me. He would love to make fun of all this pomp and splendor that these self-centered people demand. \"Well, it sounds like you're accustomed to wealth, my dear,\" Mary finally said. They continued to make small talk, but in the back of Carmen's head, doubts were beginning to grow. Did it really happen that way? She wondered. Later in the evening, Carmen excused herself, and asked a waiter where the ladies' restroom was located. Following his instructions, she made her way down a corridor and past many closed doors. Lord Watling sure is keen on keeping secrets. After checking her hair and makeup, Carmen began to make her way back to the crowd. It was then she realized a door that had been previously closed was opened a crack. Curiosity compelled her to listen into the conversation. \"Yes, the plans are all set. Mother and Father will have to submit if they want to survive.\" Carlos! \"And what about Ms. Cortez?\" \"Oh, she'll be mine by tomorrow morning. She is beautiful isn't she?\" A pause. \"If I don't kiss her soon, the potion may wear off. I think she'll make a wonderful queen. She won't have any say in policy, but she will be a wonderful adornment at Court.\" Another pause. \"And the Giggles?\" \"They'll be out of the way soon, as well. Her brother, too.\" She could hear Carlos chuckling. \"What's so funny, Highness?\" \"I'm imagining her in bed. I can sense her passion underneath all that…prettiness. She's not all that she makes out to be. I am really looking forward to our wedding night.\" The men laughed and clinked their glasses together. Carmen felt sick. She quietly left her hiding spot, and made her way back to the bathroom. It was all a lie! Carlos didn't care for her! He just wanted to possess her, to make her his. Well, she won't stand for it. Once they get back to the yacht, she'll feign sleepiness, and insist she needs to retire. Yes. Prince Carlos won't be getting a kiss from me! Little did she know that the potion was beginning to lose its hold. Gary! If only you were here! Oh, how I need you![Chapter 7] Disclaimer: I do not own Spy Kids. Hoy there! Three years later and I've finally updated! Has it really been that long? How time flies! My sincere apologies for keeping you all waiting. Life happened, which sounds lame but is true. I hope to update all my fics in the near future. But thank you for being so patient with me and my ridiculous update schedule! Till next time, alcatluvr13 Chapter Seven: The Kiss Awakens Carlos had returned from his meeting with the general and the Council. All was in agreement. The general would return to Monaco and gather the army while the Council would meet with the king and his queen at the next Parliament. At the right moment, the council would stand up and denounce the king and his wife, while the general's troops would overrun the capital. Any noble who was at home would be immediately taken prisoner and their families left in house arrest. The general himself would then lead a Special Forces group into the palace and take control, with the help of the Council. Then he, Carlos, would be escorted from the pier to the palace. He would address Parliament and the king; already he had his speech ready for that moment. He would take control of the government and appoint new ministers to help establish his rule and begin assisting him with reform. The king would be forced to abdicate, the queen placed in her own palace with a reduced staff. That troublesome woman would need to be watched, of course, but he was sure she would come to realize her power was gone and any attempt to thwart him would be dealt with the most severe punishment. The king would live in state in the old palace. It was still livable and with a fresh coat of paint and some more modern additions, the palace would look brand new. Besides, he wasn't getting any younger. Perhaps he would welcome a retirement. Yes, Carlos was quite pleased with how smoothly his plans were going. Especially once he kissed Carmen, he could get rid of those meddlesome Spy Kids. He couldn't wait to see her face when she learned she was going to be crowned queen. It wasn't often that a common American girl became queen of one of the wealthiest countries. Thank goodness his step mother was so hated. Carmen would make a wonderful queen and would follow his instructions quite well. Compared to the woman his father married, Carmen would be a nice reprieve from the greed and corruption the queen has supposedly let loose in the kingdom. He stopped musing once he entered the ballroom again. The music was still going and there were some people dancing, though they were clearly intoxicated due to their attempts at being graceful. Many of the groups had broken up and were replaced with couples flirting in the shadows. Carlos' gaze swept across the room, his interest in only one woman. \"She stepped outside for a moment, my prince,\" a servant said as she passed by. \"She said she needed some fresh air.\" Carlos thanked her and made his way through the room, acknowledging the bows and curtsies with a quick nod of his head. The patio doors were wide open and he could feel a soft breeze come in as he approached. The garden was dark, the pathways lit by torches spaced six feet between. \"Carmen?\" he called. \"Carmen, where are you?\" A bird called to its mate, who responded, but otherwise, there was no answer. \"Carmen, this isn't funny. Come out, please.\" He heard rustling from behind him and turned to see Carmen standing in the doorway. He couldn't quite see her face, due to the light from the ballroom behind her, but she looked incredibly beautiful. \"I heard you were looking for me,\" she said softly. \"I was. I had to meet with some of the men on my council who I had left behind. Where did you go?\" \"Ladies' room. The wine just went right through me, I swear.\" \"Are you ready to go back to the yacht? The evening is almost over and we should get back before it gets too late,\" Carlos said. \"Of course. I hope this doesn't sound lame, but I am getting quite tired. I just don't want this evening to end; it really has been a beautiful evening.\" Carmen could have choked on her words. She wanted to swallow them down and then spit in his face. Most of all, she wanted to slap that smirk off his face. Her memories were returning faster now and she was anxious to get home to apologize to Gary. She winced slightly as she remembered the look on his face before he left her room. She desperately needed Gerti's shoulder to cry on and Juni's wise counsel. They would help her get out of this insane predicament. She just needed to get back to them all. \"It really has been perfect, hasn't it?\" She nodded with a small smile, inwardly wishing him to just take her home. He stepped closer to her and Carmen had to check herself not to move away. \"Carmen, I can't thank you enough for coming with me. I know this sort of thing can be a bit overwhelming but you handled it all with grace.\" She nodded, not saying anything. Carlos knew he had to hurry. The affects will start to wear off very soon. He looked down at her, his hand on her chin tipping her head to look up at him. Oh no! He can't! I can't! If he kisses me I'll never remember Gary! I'll never get to apologize. I won't even see him again! She could feel tears prickling at the corner of her eye. \"Tears, my love?\" \"Only of happiness. This still seems so surreal to me. You. A wealthy prince. Me. An ordinary American girl. You could have chosen any woman you wanted. Why me?\" She was stalling until she could figure out how she could get away from his embrace. \"No woman has moved me like you have, Carmen. We grew up sheltered in the palace. True love seemed far and few between.\" He was so close! \"Carlos, I – \" \"Carmen. I love you.\" She blinked and then his lips were crashing down on hers and she was trapped. His arms had wrapped around her waist and she could feel herself responding. Without thinking her mouth opened and she felt his tongue twirling with hers. Her mind was completely numb but her body was alive. Her breathing began to quicken but then he broke away from her panting. \"I'm sorry, I know you said no. But it just seemed the perfect moment.\" She waited until her breathing had returned to normal and opened her mouth but nothing came out. Gary. Gary Giggles. His sister Gertie. Juni. Her brother. She remembered! \"You were caught in the moment, I understand,\" she said a little breathlessly. She forced herself to smile at him. \"Did you really mean what you said?\" He looked at her questioningly. Did it work? \"About being in love with me.\" \"I meant every word, Carmen, my love,\" he replied genuinely, although he was beginning to sweat just a little. Did it work? \"You barely know me. We only met just a couple days ago.\" She paused and looked him straight in the eye. \"But I think I feel the same way.\" His eyes shot to hers. She stepped closer. \"I think I love you, Prince Carlos.\" His heart leaped at her words and with it, his brain began to think of ways to get rid of Gary and Juni and how tomorrow would be the day he would set his plan in motion. But right now, he had to stay in the moment with this beautiful woman who was looking up at him with those big dark eyes and that sultry smile. \"Truly, Carmen? Do you mean it?\" Carmen lowered her eyes modestly. \"It doesn't make sense, does it? We've only known each other for a couple days but I feel like I've known you my entire life. Perhaps longer.\" Carlos smiled. \"I know what you mean. The moment I saw you my heart skipped a beat. I'm like a teenage boy again, I swear it. Carmen, you have no idea – I can't describe – oh, you have made me the happiest of men. You won't regret my loving you, I promise.\" But you will regret my loving you , Carmen thought vehemently. You will regret everything, I promise you that.[Chapter 8] A/N: So, I've been working on two of my fics, this one (obviously) and my Thor one. I'm trying to get one chapter done a week, alternating fics a week. Perhaps if I stick to my goal, I will finish this earlier than anticipated. Seriously though, I'm going to try. But don't hate me if I miss a week. Please? Disclaimer: I do not own Spy Kids. Although, I'm not going to lie, the older Alexa PenaVega gets, the hotter she is. And I'm straight! :P Chapter Eight: \"I Love You.\" While Carmen and Carlos were attending the ball on land, the three left behind spent most of the night by themselves. It was a stressful time for them all, and by silent agreement they went off to amuse themselves elsewhere. So much stress and anxiety would be detrimental to their nerves, which were already at its limits. Gerti had spent the time exploring the yacht. She discovered several hidden rooms, nothing of interest there except that they were hidden, and then ventured down to the kitchens where she made friends with the infamous cook before being shooed away. While her focus was exploration, her mind was never far from her friend and Carlos' plans. Should he be successful (God forbid, she had told herself) what would happen to them? Her father, despite all his ridiculous planning for world domination, had taught her never to give up. But there's not much that can be done when you're dead. A depressing thought, but true. After his encounter with his sister, whom looked beautiful despite the fact that he hated her date, Juni wandered up to the deck to watch the sunset. He barely moved from his spot against the rail, reliving those moments before she left with him. He should have stopped her. He could have stopped her. Why didn't he? Guilt was gnawing at his very being, knowing that if she kissed him tonight, he would lose his sister. Possibly forever. Carlos wouldn't want her younger brother following them around, and he especially wouldn't want Gary around. Juni knew that the prince considered the eldest Giggles competition, and that he would never be fully safe unless Gary was taken care of. He shuddered. His rivalry with the older boy had turned into a protective friendship, one that was shared both ways. Gary had spent the night in his room, pondering over the argument he had with Carmen. He knew it was the potion speaking but doubt was beginning to grow. And he hated it. Logic told him to think sensibly, but his heart was yearning towards the fact that she might have spoken the truth. He hated Carlos more, however. What sort of twisted, sick prince was he that he thought it was okay to drug someone, a girl he had just met? What type of brain must he possess if he thought taking away someone's free will was right? Gary couldn't understand it. While Carlos might play on \"oh-woe-is-me!\" he had a lot to learn when he it came to pity parties. No one will respect such a ploy and to be fair Gary didn't even know if what he told them was true. At least that was one thing that's okay to doubt, he had thought bitterly. Towards the end of the evening, when a guard had told them the couple were on their way back, all three gathered in Juni's room. Initially they were to discuss plans, but in truth they just sat in silence, staring off into space. Once in a while someone would make a vague comment but more often than not no one would reply. \"I swear, if he's kissed her, I will kill him!\" Gary announced after a particularly long silence. Thus far, they had succeeded in agreeing something should be done. But that was it. Gerti smiled sympathetically at her brother, but Juni's eyes widened at this shocking revelation. \"You really do care for her, don't you, Giggles?\" Gary looked him in the eye. \"I love her.\" Juni nodded slowly. \"I see.\" Gerti suppressed a giggle by coughing. \"Well, what did the waiter say? Something about if he kisses her, only her true love would be able to undo it. As far as I know, she hasn't been interested with anyone as much as she has with you. You might be our only choice.\" \"I think I'm your only choice. But I see your meaning.\" Gary sighed. \"I'm not usually the jealous type. I believe in giving people the benefit of the doubt before I start throwing accusations. But perhaps in this case, I should start throwing punches. Carlos thinks he can take what he wants, when he wants, and all because he's royalty. And let's be honest, he's not exactly good at lying. His charming personality helps with defecting suspicion, but only for those who are not looking for anything.\" \"I agree,\" Gerti replied. \"I wish I had my laptop. I could find out so much about him, and Monaco, if I had access to the OSS database. They may be a small country, but no one can truly escape the OSS.\" Juni looked at her thoughtfully. \"What?\" \"There may be a way to access the internet...\" The drive back to the yacht was painful, in more ways than one. First off, Carlos insisted in draping his arm across her shoulder. Secondly, he demanded a kiss every five minutes. And thirdly, in between kisses, he talked about his plans for the future of Monaco and his ideas for their relationship. After a particularly long kiss (that, despite herself, left Carmen panting) he launched into her coronation plans. That was it. \"Woah, wait a moment, Carlos. We're not getting married just yet. I mean, I'm not even 18.\" He smiled indulently. \"I know, darling, but I can't help it. You're so beautiful. You really have made me the happiest of men.\" She blushed. \"I know, I know. But this is so new to me. Can we just….can we just enjoy what we have before we start planning gown fittings and coronation invites?\" She looked up at him, her brown eyes so honest. \"Very well, my love. We shall hold off. I do hope you understand that I plan on spoiling you, at the very least.\" Carmen giggled. \"I wouldn't expect anything less.\" The car stopped and the driver opened the door. \"We've arrived back at the dock, sir.\" Carlos helped her out and together they walked, hand in hand, through the long corridors back to Carmen's room. \"I love you, Carmen. Thank you for attending with me,\" he said when they stopped outside her door. \"Oh, no, thank you! It was such a lovely evening and so….so perfect.\" He tipped her face up to his, and kissed her. \"Goodnight, my lady.\" Carmen opened the door and looked back. \"Goodnight, my prince,\" she said softly before closing the door. Carmen turned on the light and was startled to see her room was already occupied. Gerti was sitting at her vanity while Juni and Gary were stationed on her bed. All three were looking at her with open expressions of disdain and concern. \"Relax you guys, the potion didn't work.\" \"Carmen, I know you think Carlos loves – wait, what?\" Gerti was elected to speak for the three of them but she hadn't expected that. \"It wore off before he could kiss me. Plus, I overheard some interesting things. But first, just to be on the safe side, we're going to have to act like it worked.\" \"What? Why?\" Gary burst out. He had wanted to take her into his arms at the news but Carmen kept her distance and he wanted to know why. \"Because, technically he did kiss me. It just didn't work. And secondly, because I've made him think it's worked. And thirdly, there are cameras everywhere on this boat. Before we left for the ball, we stopped at the control room and I saw screens that looked the hallways around the yacht. So we have to be careful,\" she said it like she was wary. \"So basically, play along until we know what he's up to,\" Juni said. \"Exactly. Hopefully that won't be long because I'm not sure if I can up this charade indefinitely. I want to wipe my mouth every time he kisses me.\" She ran a hand through her hair and smiled vaguely. \"You think there's a camera in here, don't you?\" Gary said as he realized why she was switching between simpering girl school and annoyed bitch. She nodded, her smile sad. \"I need you to start looking like you're trying to convince me he's not right for me. And Gerti, would you mind getting up so I can sit down?\" The Giggles knew how to act like they're doing one thing and yet say the complete opposite. Gary launched into a tirade of hand movements, his expression frustrated. Gerti stood up and made to put her hand on his shoulder, her eyes concerned but her smile grim. Juni, taking his cue from the others, looked shocked and saddened, as if he knew that his sister was lost. Carmen tossed her hair and flounced over to the seat Gerti just vacated and started brushing her hair. This is what the cameras, and the captain and Carlos, witnessed. Both were grinning ear to ear, as if they enjoyed the destruction off a beautiful friendship. \"I can't tell you how glad I am that it didn't work. So what now?\" Carmen tossed the brush aside and twisted around, glaring at Gary. \"Well, I'm on the inside now. He's already made some pretty indiscreet comments about coronations and council meetings and parliament. I suppose we just wait until he reveals something more substantial.\" She picked up the brush again and resumed her grooming. Juni spoke up, tentatively. \"We've already discovered a way to access the Internet. So when the time comes, we will contact the OSS and let them in on everything.\" He lowered his eyes, then raised them, looking hopeful. Carmen looked at her brother through mirror, without turning. \"I guess that's the best we can do now,\" she said softly. She sighed. \"I suppose we should wrap this up. Gary?\" She risked a quick glance at his face. She was so proud of him. He hadn't once doubted this and he was keeping in character. \"I couldn't bear to watch you fall in love with him, potion or not. I can't tell you how happy I am that you're okay and not under his influence. We will get out of this, Carmen. Don't lose hope. You won't have to act for long.\" He stood up abruptly, glaring at her back. Carmen, for appearance's sake, had started to cry. She bowed her head, so no one could see how true her tears were. Her hand gripped the side of the vanity tightly, her shoulders heaving. \"I love you, Carmen. I just want you to know that.\" He turned and left the room, slamming the door behind him. She looked at the reflection of the door, her eyes full of tears and her expression open. Shock and despair were two emotions she rarely felt together but in this case, they suited her purpose. Juni came up behind her and put a hand on her shoulder. Gerti, at his nod, slipped silently away, mouthing to Carmen she would be back in the morning. She shook her head sadly, knowing that they probably had an audience. Carmen and Juni remained as they were for a long time, the tears flowing freely down Carmen's face. Gary loved her? Gary loved her. Gary loved her? He loved her. How? Why? She could barely process what he had said. It didn't help that to everyone looking on, he looked pissed. But his words and eyes were sincere as he said them. \"I love you, Carmen.\" She repeated it over and over in head until Juni bent down and kissed her on the cheek. \"I'm so happy I haven't lost my sister. I really have missed you. Gary is a good man, Carmen, and if there's anyone I would have to give my approval for, it's him. I know Dad would feel the same way. Get some rest. You're going to need it. I'll see you in the morning.\" She nodded in response. Juni left the room, closing the door softly behind her and she was finally alone. Carlos smile was full of satisfaction and self-importance as he watched Carmen change into her nightgown and crawl into bed. I won. Don't forget to review! :D[Chapter 9] A/N: So obviously I didn't keep to my \"every other week\" plan. I'm sorry, guys. Shit just got in the way. *sigh* BUT I am glad that people are still interested in this. This one is a bit shorter than the past few entries, but I hope you enjoy it! This fic is almost done, less than five chapters to go. I do want to say thank you for everyone who has stayed with me from the beginning. It's been a long and rough journey for all of us. But anyway, without further ado, here is the next chapter! Don't forget to review, please! Chapter Nine: Waiting, Waiting, Waiting The following days passed slowly for Carmen. She spent most of her time with Carlos or Juni, though she would greet Gerti pleasantly if they met in the hallway. Unfortunately, due to Carlos' attentions, she couldn't get away often to meet with her brother, and so there was little planning done. If it wasn't for Juni, she wouldn't have been able to keep up this charade. Every day Carlos grew a little bolder with her. Each morning he would greet her with a smile and would escort her to the small dining room where they would share breakfast. They would talk about the books they loved, their favorite movies and their goals for the future. Carlos would talk about growing up in a palace and shared stories of his little sister. Carmen would laugh and tell him Juni was an absolute terror compared to his sister. She would talk about her school, what American society was like and explain how Hollywood was the equivalent to the nobility in a monarchy, though with more scandals. Lunch and dinner was usually taken on deck. He'd have the table set perfectly and they'd watch the sun set together, holding hands. His kisses grew more frequent and she could see the desire grow in his eyes every time he looked at her. Somewhere between lunch and dinner he would have a meeting on the video camera with certain nobles. He never shared what was said in those conferences and Carmen never pushed him. Sometimes he would leave her to her own devices for an hour to correspond with the captain. It was exhausting. She could barely keep up with it. When she was younger she had considered acting but pretending to be in love every moment of every day told her she'd never make it in Hollywood. Only yesterday she had snapped at Juni on several occasions. She apologized but he knew they would have to do something soon before the truth came out. Unfortunately, Carlos' constant attentions left them little time to have a decent conversation because when she did have free time she spent it napping. Today was no different than the past four mornings. She had woken up to a knock on her door with a note from a maid that said she had an hour before Carlos would escort her to breakfast in the dining room. \"Every day is the same. Why doesn't he mix it up a bit? Even a princess must get bored from the same schedule,\" she grumbled to herself as she dried her hair. Suddenly, there was another knock on her door, this time much louder than normal. She turned off the dryer before checking to see who it was. \"He's early. He's never early.\" She paused before opening the door. Something didn't feel right. \"You're a bit early, aren't you?\" she said as she opened the door. But he didn't look too pleased. \"Carlos? Is something wrong?\" \"Carmen, I am early, you're right. May I come in?\" Not once had she allowed him to enter her bedroom but his expression was off so she stepped back. There would be no ravishment with that look. He closed the door behind him and surveyed the room before looking at her. \"Please be seated.\" \"Carlos?\" She sat at her vanity and looked at him, genuinely puzzled. \"I've had….interesting news,\" he said seriously. \"Oh?\" In all the time she's spent with him, he had never given her the slightest indication of an erratic temper. But something told her now that she should be wary and allow him to do the talking. He started pacing. \"Yes. The head technician just told me that someone has hacked into our database and accessed the internet.\" Carmen looked blankly at him. She had no idea what she was talking about. \"Okay….\" He stopped pacing for a moment to look at her. His face was grave. \"Carmen, my love, you must tell me. Has Juni said anything to you about contacting someone?\" \"What?\" she said. The question was so unlooked for that she could speak honestly for once. \"Jeremy, the head technician, has told me that someone has sent a message to an unknown address. I'm just wondering if Juni has mentioned anything to you.\" \"No, he hasn't. We haven't had much time this last several days to catch up. Our conversations are mostly about the weather and how he wished he had his chess set with him. We really haven't gone any deeper than that.\" Which is completely true since you don't even give me time to sit down and talk. \"I promise you, Carlos, I would have told you at once if he had said something,\" she said with a placating smile. He shook his head. \"So you're absolutely certain Juni hasn't said anything.\" Carmen's patience was beginning to wear down. \"Yes, love. I promise. He hasn't said a word.\" \"Could it have been Gerti, then? What about your ex-lover? Gary? Could he have sent a message of distress to someone? I wouldn't even put it pass him! I bet it was him. He's been too quiet as it is. I knew he was up to something!\" Carmen was shocked and angry. She had been playing along with his game perfectly and now he's accusing her of her previous associations when she's given him no reason to suspect. \"Carlos,\" she said, keeping her voice steady with obvious effort, \"I swear to you, I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. I've barely spoken to Gerti since she tried to warn me off you, and Gary won't even look at me even if I did want to talk to him. And besides, why does it matter? I doubt they could have snuck in somewhere, they're smart enough to realize they'd get caught taking such a risk. They may be immature and annoying, but they certainly aren't stupid.\" \"So you do still feel something for him!\" Carlos cried. Carmen could see a vein popping out on his neck and he was quite beyond control at this point. \"I bet you're covering for him and his twerp of a sister. I knew it!\" Carmen stood up now, her rage getting the better of her. \"Are you accusing me of being in love with him? Is that what this is about?!\" \"YES!\" \"I have no idea what you're talking about,\" she said coldly. \"I am not in love with Gary Giggles and any former feelings I had for him are long gone. He was a fling, nothing more. It's you I care for, Carlos. It's you I love. I have nothing to give to you but my heart. No family, no dowry, no connections. You've said you were happy to take me as I am and that you'd take care of me. And I believed you. You swore you trusted me and you loved me. And now you're accusing me of loving someone else, of cheating on you and aiding him in undermining you. But I have not. I've barely even thought of him! You are what I wake up to and you are what I think of before I close my eyes to sleep. I love you! How can you not see that?\" Carmen was so frustrated at the sudden accusations (which were, in fact, true, though she saw no reason to admit that just yet), combined with pure exhaustion and wanting to go home, that she had no problem crying. Her tears were quite genuine and she knew it. She turned her back on him and reached for a tissue on a nearby table. \"Oh Carmen, my love! I'm so – I did not – I swear to you, I truly didn't doubt you. I – just – Jeremy's revelation scared me and I panicked. I'm so sorry, darling, my own love. Gary's presence on the boat makes me nervous and after so much planning I can't afford for one mistake. Revenge is so bitter sweet and can be so fleeting, I have to seize this chance now before the General learns of my plans.\" Carlos had wrapped his arms around Carmen's shoulders and lightly rocked her side to side. His voice had now taken on a crooning sort of tone, much like a mother would say when she's comforting her young child. \"Revenge?\" Carmen said, quizzically, before she could stop herself. Carlos tensed for just a moment that she knew she wouldn't have felt it if she hadn't been paying attention. \"Only a manner of speaking. My stepmother must pay for her crimes. For the honor of the country and the memory of our family name, her injustices must be brought to light. Don't you worry, dearest. But can you ever forgive me? I promise, I would never willingly hurt you.\" Carmen sighed. She didn't want to make it too easy for him, but since this their first \"fight\" she knew she would have to give in soon. She wished she could question him some more. \"I forgive you, my love.\" He turned her around so he could look into her eyes. \"I promise you, Carmen, my only love, I will do my very best to ensure that you are safe and happy. I would never hurt you, not intentionally, unlike that blackguard, Gary Giggles.\" She smiled. \"I know you wouldn't.\" She ignored that last comment. \"I love you, too. And I'm sorry I got angry at you. I know you've been very busy and since I haven't slept well this past few nights, neither of us at our best. It is forgiven and forgotten.\" \"You haven't slept well? But why not? Are you ill, Carmen?\" Carlos immediately grew concerned and felt her forehead. \"It is nothing, nothing!\" she replied, laughing. \"I'm not sick, I promise. I go through bouts of insomnia occasionally, and this is one of those occasions.\" \"Well, we shall not tire you out any further. You must stay here today and rest. I will come fetch you for dinner tonight.\" \"Oh, really, Carlos, I – \" He held up a hand and she stopped. \"Not another word, darling. Don't feel bad. You must rest. And I shall take the opportunity to catch up on my work. I admit I've been neglecting my duties to spend time with you.\" She smiled and kissed him lightly on the lips. \"Very well then, now that you've put it that way.\" \"I'll leave you to your rest, my dear.\" He kissed her and gave her a hug before leaving her bedroom. He looked back and she simpered at him, smiling with her eyes. He closed the door softly and she collapsed on the bed. Of course the argument wasn't forgotten. Carmen closed her eyes. Later she would knock on the bathroom wall and see if Gerti would hear. There weren't many opportunities for them to use their secret code, but today seemed like the perfect time to do so. Later. After she had taken a nap. She was so exhausted… \"I heard yelling coming from Carmen's room,\" Gerti said that afternoon after lunch. \"What were they saying?\" Gary asked casually. \"Carlos accused her of aiding you and Juni sending a message. Said that she was still in love with you and that he would not stand for it.\" They were sitting in the small parlor room that they had designated theirs own. Lunch had been served and taken away and now they were twiddling away their time. Gerti was sitting on the couch, knitting. A servant had provided the supplies when they were at Cape Hope. Gary was lounging in the big chair by the window, feet dangling over the armrest. Juni had not yet arrived. \"Well, he's not far off,\" he replied. \"True, but it sounded like it could get violent. He hasn't shown signs of an erratic temper, but one never knows.\" Gerti paused. \"They made up pretty quickly. Carmen should have gone to acting school, she's pretty good.\" Gary grunted. He was none too happy about this arrangement, of course. But what could they do? Nothing was certain and they needed her on the inside. Not that they had many opportunities to talk, but it was the only option they had. And he worried. He worried about her and what would happen if Carlos found out it was a lie. He shuddered. He knew she was good, he could see it in front of him, but he didn't trust the man an inch if he was confronted with the truth before they were rescued. \"Gary? Are you okay?\" \"Yeah, I'm fine. Just worried.\" \"Well, that's nothing new. But you're playing the part of an abused and cast off lover pretty well.\" He looked at his younger sister. She smirked and he couldn't help but grin back. Gerti was right. The door opened. \"Juni, where have you been?\" \"Just checked in on Carmen. She was asleep. Don't blame her, she's been exhausted.\" \"Can you blame her? Acting like she's in love for so long must be quite tiresome,\" Gerti piped in. \"I don't know how she does it.\" She shook her head. \"Well, the message is sent. And now we wait,\" Juni said as he took a seat next to Gerti. \"I wish I knew how long it might take, though. Francis wasn't able to give me specifics.\" Luckily, Gary had discovered Francis in the kitchens, working as an assistant cook. Francis had been the waiter who had warned Gary and Carmen about the prince's intentions with Carmen. Although wasn't part of the Carlos' inner circle, he had been a huge help in planning an escape. Gerti nodded in response. \"Let's just hope Carlos doesn't find out what was in it. We have to be on our best behavior until we know what's going to happen.\" Sneaking into the private control room that they had discovered was difficult enough, even with Francis' help, but they all knew what would happen should Carlos discover what was in it. Francis had warned them that he would find out something had been sent, but he assured them all the message would be safe once it was sent and any trace of what it said would be gone. But one can never be too sure with security these days. \"Is there a chance that someone would be able to hack into the ship's systems from the outside? And if so, would Jeremy be able to tell the difference?\" Gary had asked him. \"Unfortunately, I doubt that. But it should be safe enough. Or rather, as safe as it can be, given the circumstances,\" the Frenchman replied. Gary shrugged in response. \"It was a long shot,\" he agreed. And now they waited. Who knows how long it could be. They had specifically said not to contact them for fear of any sort of reprisal, but that left the former spy kids in the dark. Not being able to communicate a rescue mission was difficult enough, but not knowing when said rescue would occur was even worse. There was silence in the room. Everyone was worried. No one knew how long Carmen could keep the act up. They were running out of time. And Carlos was closer to the truth than they realized.[Chapter 10] I do not own Spy Kids. WARNING: VIOLENCE WITH SEXUAL INTENT LATER IN THE CHAPTER. BE WARNED. Chapter Ten: Rescue! Carlos knew someone had sent a message for help. He believed Carmen had no part in it (for how could she when she's very clearly madly in love with him) but it didn't stop him from being angry. He was so close to the throne! The only thing keeping him from executing his plans directly was the fact that Parliament had yet to be called. His father was so dastardly slow! You would imagine that the government of a wealthy, beautiful nation would not cease working even though the king's eldest son was missing and presumed kidnapped. He couldn't wait much longer. Parliament had to be in session or else nothing would happen and his step mother would win. He couldn't bear it if that witch won! So, Carlos was angry. He knew Carmen could sense something was wrong though she had no idea what it was. He'd like to keep it that way, but it was becoming increasingly harder to keep it from her. So he withdrew a little bit and kept to himself more often, only seeing her at dinner where they spoke of the most trivial and mundane of subjects. Carlos was constantly at war with himself, which did not help his temper at all. He couldn't throw Gary and his sister into prison, for then Carmen would become suspicious and would begin to ask questions. To be honest, she was already inquiring if his health was okay and if he was feeling well. He fended her questions off but he saw the look in her eyes; that look of disbelief and concern. How good Carmen was to worry for him. A dutiful wife she would surely make, and a beautiful queen. But on the other hand, if he waited too long, the OSS could arrive and potentially ruin everything. They'd let the witch win, and Gary would kiss Carmen and they would sail off to their own little happy ending. He couldn't allow that! Carmen was his, and the throne of Monaco was his by rights as well! Nothing would get in the way of that, he would make sure of it. He just needed to give Parliament a little push that would ensure they started soon. But how to make such a subtle push without endangering his plans…. It had been less than a month since they encountered Carlos and learned of his deranged plan to take over the Kingdom of Monaco. But to Carmen, it felt like months. She had been playing the part of a young woman madly in love for the first time and it was getting more wearisome each day. Her nerves were fraying, and if anyone watched her closely enough, they could see how close she was to snapping. Her only solace was in what snatched conversations she had with Juni and Gerti. And neither could whisper more than a \"we know the message was received, don't worry, it won't be much longer!\" But Carmen did worry. She could only claim illness so much before Carlos suspected something, and she sensed that he knew something, though she wasn't sure what. His responses had become slightly cool and off kilter, and he no longer sent her little notes throughout the day. Something was wrong. But she didn't know what. And it worried her even more to be left in the dark. What would he do if he found out she was acting? Her brief glimpse of his temper showed how unstable and erratic his mental state really was. She had no wish to learn more. Carmen was frightened. And she feared she had just cause to feel so. Carlos was unstable and though she played the loving fiancé well enough, she could not keep it up much longer. She was lying on her bed reading when someone knocked on her door. With Carlos' keeping to himself, her days were filled with little else but books. Soon she would be out of books to read, for the small library on board featured less than twenty books. But the pastime occupied her mind and kept her from thinking of what could happen. \"Come in!\" she called as she straightened up and adjusted the pillows behind her. A familiar, but unexpected figure entered the room. \"Gary!\" the shock was unfeigned, as she was not expecting to interact with him until they were rescued. \"Carmen,\" he said softly. \"I just had to see how you were doing.\" There was deep anguish in his voice and Carmen could feel it vibrating in her chest. \"I am well,\" she said stiffly, aware that they had to keep up the pretense. \"And you?\" \"I am as well as can be expected. Bored out of my mind, but that's nothing new. There's not much to do on a runaway ship, is there? Except get in the way and avoid any suspicion.\" Carmen's mouth twitched. \"There's a small library that you are welcome to look at. It's not much, but it's been keeping me busy,\" she said as she gestured to the small pile of books at the foot of her bed. \"I think I'm good. I've had enough reading in school to last me a lifetime,\" he added wryly. \"Indeed. Well, I am glad to see you are okay. Now if you don't mind, I'll get back to my book, please.\" She couldn't bear to be in the same room with him. She was on the verge of letting everything out; all she wanted to do was sob in his arms. But that would ruin the cover and Carlos would know everything had been an act. She needed him gone before he ruined everything. \"Carmen, look, I'm worried for you. This guy, Carlos, whatever he's done to you….it's not healthy. You can't fall in love with someone that quickly. It's not possible!\" Gary burst out. He wanted to stay. And he knew Carmen had the right idea about keeping up appearances, but he had to be near her. Just standing this close to her was enough to make him break, but he wouldn't. He couldn't. She shot him a look of pure hatred, so intense that he wondered if there was some truth to it. \"Get. Out.\" Gary hesitated just for a moment before he fled. Things must be so bad for her that she could summon such energy and emotion in one look. He had to get her out. Even if that meant acting without the OSS. Carlos knocked on Carmen's door. He didn't see the interaction between Carmen and Gary while it was live, but security had rewound the footage so he could watch it. He had laughed gleefully, for he saw the look of absolute hatred in Carmen's face before Gary ran. It was priceless. He had them freeze that moment and print it for him. He reminded himself what his plan was for the evening. Tonight, he would ensure there would be no mistakes. And by tomorrow night, he would be in his home palace with Carmen and the Giggles would be gone. The door opened and he smiled. \"You look beautiful, my dear.\" \"Thank you,\" she said softly, her eyes looking straight into his. Such trust, he thought. Carmen made to move and close the door behind her but he stopped her. \"Wait a moment. May I come in?\" She hesitated, he saw. He hadn't been into her room since that day, when he had alternated between jealous boyfriend and adoring lover. She nodded, a little wary. She obviously remembered the last time he had entered her bedroom. \"Is something the matter?\" \"No, I just….Carmen. You love me, right?\" She looked confused, but answered willingly. \"Of course, Carlos. You know I do. Are you sure nothing's wrong?\" \"Nothing's wrong. I love you. Carmen – I…..I have something I want to ask you.\" \"Oh?\" What could he mean? Carmen remembered the scene from a couple days ago and she didn't want this to be a repeat. \"Carmen. I love you. So much. I would die for you. And, well, I know you feel the same way. We're almost to Monaco. We'll be there by dawn. Parliament has been summoned. My general has already set things in motion. We'll be in the palace by tomorrow.\" The words came out fast and hurried. He tried to calm himself, but it was true, he was nervous. \"Oh, how wonderful!\" No one could know that her hopes had just been crushed with the way she smiled and fluttered her eyelashes. She leaned forward and kissed him and he responded with his usual ardor before he pulled back and looked at her seriously. \"What is it?\" They were supposed to have more time, she thought desperately. Mom, dad, where are you? Her soul cried out to her parents, hoping that they would burst in and rescue her like they had done in the past. Carlos reached into his pocket and pulled a small velvet box from his pocket. And then he knelt and held it out towards her. Carmen stepped back, in part because he was so close and in part because she wasn't sure she believed what she was seeing. \"Carmen. My love. Will you marry me?\" He opened the box and inside was a simple diamond ring. Elegant in its setting, small but not enough to disappear on the hand that wore it, and beautifully polished. Her mouth opened and closed. She was unable to speak. She couldn't believe his was happening. \"I know it's soon, Carmen. But tomorrow, well. Tomorrow there might be some disagreements. I will have a guard about me and no one would dare harm me as Crown Prince, but bullets can stray and even the best laid plans can go awry. That being said, I wish to go into this battle, whether it be words or legitimate fighting, knowing that when I arrive at the palace, my beautiful wife will be waiting to welcome me.\" Carmen knew she should say something. Anything to stall, but her mind was still in shock. \"I….\" She tried to gather her thoughts. \"Carlos…I….I love you. You know I do. And I would give you my life, as you've already said. But….Carlos, I'm only seventeen. I haven't thought of marriage yet. I'm still working on figuring out where I want to go for college. This….I'm honored that you think I would make a worthy princess but – \" she suddenly found a way out. \"But I couldn't allow you to marry me when I'm not worthy.\" Her voice grew in strength as she looked into his eyes but faltered when she saw them harden just a fraction. \"Let me….let me explain. These past few weeks have been so wonderful. I've learned so much of the world and you gave me an opportunity to experience something I thought I never would. The sunset dinners and the beautiful things you've given me….I've felt like a princess. But….I'm still a young. And….not only that, but I want my parents to be with me when I marry. I want what every girl wants: a beautiful white dress and the arm of her father walking her down the aisle in a white church. And while I'm sure you mean the best but I….I need my daddy with me when I wed. And my mother and my grandparents.\" She paused to take a breath. \"Surely you can understand that?\" Carlos stared at her. Carmen had hoped this was a way out without damaging her or her family but now she wasn't sure. He closed the box and shut his eyes. His expression worried her. He stood up and turned away from her. \"Carlos?\" she asked tentatively. \"I see.\" His shoulders straightened back and he looked straight at the wall, talking a couple steps away from her. Then he abruptly turned around again. He was angry. And Carmen was truly frightened. \"I see it all now.\" His shoulders were tense and he advanced slowly towards her, his eyes narrowing in anger. \"You've led me on.\" Carmen shook her head as she backed away slowly. \"No, of-of course not, Carlos. I wouldn't say these things if I didn't love you. I….Carlos, truly, I haven't. I – \" He interrupted her. \"You led me on. You lied to me. You still love him , don't you? That's what this is about! Gary Giggles ! This has nothing to do with wanting your parents with you on your wedding day! This is all about him .\" Carmen kept backing away until she hit the wall behind her. She tried to duck under his arm and get past him but he was too quick and he threw her against the wall. She groaned in pain but he took no notice. \"I see everything. You slut! You were probably meeting with him in secret where I couldn't watch you! I bet you had found a closet somewhere and you two were probably getting it on while I worked towards providing you a future! A beautiful future full of wealth and love! How can you choose HIM over that?\" He was yelling now, his face only inches from hers. Carlos had always had a jealousy problem. It was the reason why most women stayed away from him. Carmen was his hope, his salvation from being shunned by the women of the court. That potion was the answer to everything! But that witch had lied to him about it. They all had probably lied to him! Carmen was frightened. His hands gripped her shoulders painfully and she was aware that his breathing was coming out faster. Whether it was from anger or lust, she didn't know but she didn't want to find out either. \"Carlos, you're hurting me. Please. Let go.\" She tried to wiggle out of his grasp but he was too strong. \"Please. Carlos, ow, you can't – \" \"I CAN'T WHAT?\" He was in a rage and nothing would have stopped him from what he wanted to do. He grabbed a fistful of her hair and jerked her head to look at him before smashing his mouth against hers. Carmen was in shock. She had heard of rape before and several OSS cases had involved a couple victims of such a violent act but she had never thought it would happen to her. She couldn't fight him. All her skills had fled and she was left weakened in her fright. He pulled back suddenly and with his hand still entangled in her hair dragged her to the bed and threw her towards it. Her arm hit the bedside table, the shock and her fear rendering it useless. Her other hand grappled for a book to throw at him but she had piled them on the desk across the room earlier. Carlos struggled with his pants but was finally able to free himself as stared down at her. Her hair was a mess, her dress wrinkled and there were bruises forming on her shoulders. He was vaguely aware that those were his fault but it was her eyes that spoke to him the most. They were wide and he saw pure terror in them. She saw him hesitate, unsure of what he was thinking. He still looked angry but suddenly he made up his mind and he launched himself on top of her. Carmen screamed. . . . No one wanted to disturb the prince but the matter was too urgent. A ship had been spotted on the radar and it was gaining on them. They were preparing to shoot back at them before they received a call from the ship itself. The captain agreed to stop and to allow a party to board, if only to stall for time but when he paged Carlos over the intercom, there was no response. By the time he thought to check the cameras, it was too late. . . . Gary saw the ship approach from the parlor window. He had been staring at the ceiling when he saw something grey out of the corner of his eye. He watched with wide eyes as he saw a large ship pull up beside the yacht. The name on the side said \"OSS – The Lady Rose.\" He gave a loud whoop before jumping up to go search for his sister and Juni. . . . Gerti was in the study, leafing through a book when Gary burst in. One look at his face told her everything. \"Juni!\" She called. They heard a flush and Juni came out of the restroom. He saw their grins and titled his head before understanding dawned on him. And he grinned too. . . . Gregorio and Ingrid had agonized over the disappearance of their children. They had contacted the Monacan government, but they had no new of their children or of the crown prince. Now things were getting more confusing, especially as they learned more of the prince's nature. Gregorio had puzzled over the possibility of foul play from the Giggles, but he doubted it. He was only sure when a visit to their father in his current quarters told them he had had no contact with them since he began his sentence. Ingrid, of course, was a vision of strength. But as the days turned into weeks and no word had been received, even her nerves began to fray. Her daughter was missing (and of course being an attractive young lady, Ingrid worried even more) and there was no news of her baby Juni either (he might be 14 but he was still her baby). Finally they received a coded message from a yacht floating somewhere in the Atlantic. It was distressingly vague but it was enough to tell them their children needed them. \"We. Help. Need. Help. You. Help. J.C.&G.G.; Help.\" . . . Juni may have been going on 15 years old, but he was not ashamed to let the tears fall. He had never been happier to see his mother and father step off the plank and run towards him. \"We have worried so! What happened?! We lost your ship and there was no distress signal sent out!\" His mother was crying and hugging him repeatedly. Even his father had tears in his eyes as he hugged them close. But Gregorio was looking around, noting the lack of security and the guilty-looking seamen. But, though that didn't register right, something else was wrong. \"Juni. Where's your sister?\" Juni stepped out of his mother's embrace and looked at his father seriously. \"She's in trouble.\" . . . They heard the screams before they had even reached the door. They all broke into a run and when they tried to open it, they found it was locked. Gary particularly struggled with the doorknob before Gregorio gently pushed him aside. He took out a handgun and let loose a couple rounds before the door burst open. . . . Carlos was in a fury. He heard the pounding on the door but it didn't register. He just knew he needed to show Carmen his love for her but she wouldn't listen. She kicked at him and screamed while tears rolled down her face. He had everything planned. The chapel was all ready, he even had a wedding gown set aside for her to wear. They would marry tonight and spend the night together and tomorrow he could show her to the his country as the woman he had chosen for their queen. So what went wrong? WHAT IN THE WORLD WENT WRONG? He struck her face once and was raising his arm to strike again when he heard other voices shouting and finally hands pulled him roughly away. Everything was hazy. He saw an older woman wrap her arms around Carmen and hold her close. He watched men in uniform enter the room while someone cuffed his hands behind his back. Then he saw Gary Giggles with a handgun pointed at his face head and a look of pure hatred in his eyes as he looked into Carlos' eyes. And somewhere, deep down, Carlos realized this was the end. A/N: Okay. This isn't the end, obviously. There will be an epilogue. I apologize for the long wait but I do want to thank everyone who has kept with me for so long and to those who still pester and poke at me and tell me to update. You know who you are. I won't make promises when the last chapter will be up, but hopefully soon. I'm sure I've lost readers, and while I'm sad that I did, all I can say is, when looking back at the first chapter and then re-reading this chapter, what experiences that kept me from updating regularly are the experiences that made me a better writer. Thank you all again, and until next time![Chapter 11] I do not own Spy Kids. Epilogue Gary was pacing frantically. It had been several days since he last saw Carmen and he was told that she was recovering from her ordeal and would be well enough for visits soon. Only her mother could see her, despite Gregorio's objections, who was firmly, but gently, put into his place. It was a miracle that Carlos hadn't succeeded in penetrating her, though the bruises he left behind were more than enough. Both Gary and Gregorio had to be restrained from pummeling him into the floor and Juni looked just as murderous. The prince had been swiftly hustled out of the room and shortly after Ingrid ushered everyone out except for Gerti and herself. She wanted only females around Carmen, she had said. Carlos was locked in a guest room (due to his rank and status as the Crown Prince he had to be treated accordingly, though anything that could be used as a weapon was removed before he was secured) and Gregorio issued orders to continue with their course. He also informed the Monacan government that they had found the prince and would be in port within the hour. Surprisingly, they were greeted with very little fanfare. Carlos was secured in a car with two guards to watch him and everyone else followed. Carmen stayed behind with her mother and Gerti while arrangements for a transport to the hospital were made. Ingrid insisted on it, though Gary wished to join them. It was Gerti who told him that it was not possible. \"She needs to be examined, Gary. Both physically and, well, mentally. Out of all of us she was the one who was in the most danger, and to be frank, I'm surprised she was able to hold herself together as long as she did. She needs peace and quiet now.\" Gary smiled wanly. \"Since when did you become so wise and mature, little sister?\" \"Since I got a chest and began puberty,\" she replied with a wink. Gary chuckled. \"Give her time. She'll be ready when she's ready.\" Gary nodded, reassured only a little bit. And now, almost a week later, they would be meeting the king and queen. They had requested a private audience with the Cortezes and Giggles, and they had graciously accepted. Both parties knew this would be a painful meeting for both sides, and one that would probably last several hours at least. Gary was anxious for several reasons. He knew Carlos would not be there and that he had been confined to his chambers with a guard always on duty. The king and queen seemed resigned that their son was mentally unbalanced, but Gary wasn't quite sure what his punishment would be. He just knew that the prince deserved more than what he would probably get. \"Sir, the meeting will begin shortly. Shall I accompany you?\" \"Please.\" Gary straightened his shirt, still not quite used to being addressed so formally. He nodded and followed the servant to the meeting room downstairs. King Juan was a tall, imposing man but with a mouth prone to smiling and twinkling eyes. Broad shoulders and a dark physique completed the look of a king descended from the major European royal houses. Upon inheriting a wealthy kingdom, he was beloved of the people and rarely a day in the pubs went by without at least one toast to his health. Contrary to what Carlos told them, Queen Clara was still alive. Despite having aged since the portrait in the parlor was made, she was no less elegant now. Slightly shorter than the king, she was a kind woman who often went out of her way to ensure the happiness and well-being of those around her. Carlos' sister, the princess Arabella, was a bright, vivacious girl of 16 with her father's dark looks and her mother's kind smile. She was neither oppressed nor did she possess a quiet, meek disposition as the prince had confided. Evidently, Carlos had lied about his family circumstances. Not only that, but he had also committed treason and those accomplices who helped him (namely dissatisfied nobles who wanted more wealth and titles) were also guilty. In the past treason was punishable by death. But having entered the 21st century, the king did not think it right to execute his only son when he was not even in his right mind. Gary thought about all this as he was escorted to the meeting room. The king and queen were standing by the fireplace, with Gregorio and Ingrid standing opposite them and his sister and Juni seated on the sofa. He bowed to the king and queen, as custom dictated. Ingrid reached out to embrace him and he let her, feeling a keen sense of loss that his own mother was not there with him today. Gregorio patted him on the back. \"Please be seated. We have much to discuss.\" The king took a seat in the chair by the fireplace and indicated for them to choose a spot while the queen rang a bell before sitting in the chair closest to her husband. A maid entered and bowed. \"Please bring some tea, coffee, and some refreshments in. We might be here a while,\" the queen said quietly. \"Yes ma'am.\" The queen exchanged a quick glance with her husband, who looked just as pained as she did. Then King Juan cleared his throat and began. \"I thank you for patience. I would have arranged to meet earlier, but this matter required extreme delicacy, for reasons that I will explain to you shortly. However, the queen and I would like to thank you on behalf of our kingdom for discovering the truth of the plot and for stopping…. our son from doing any more harm.\" Ingrid and Gregorio nodded graciously, while Gerti and the others murmured polite replies. \"We would also like to thank you as a mother and father,\" the queen continued, resting a hand on top of her husband's. \"We understand that Carlos has committed unforgiveable acts against you and yours. Despite running a kingdom, we are still parents who have made mistakes.\" She nodded towards the Cortezes. \"Running a large, secret organization might be different than running a country, but the concept is the same. Politics rule business just as much as government and both require a skill that only experience can give. I am sure you understand this.\" \"We do,\" Ingrid replied with a small smile. Gregorio nodded. \"Then perhaps you also understand that sometimes, no matter how hard you try, business gets mixed in with personal.\" \"Unfortunately,\" Gregorio said wryly. \"Carlos has always been difficult. As the oldest and only son, we wished to train him in not only the running of a government but in the ways of royalty. Our country may be small but we are a proud lot. Our family is descended from the Spanish, French, and Portuguese royal lines, and therefore is just as ancient. But to explain how our son has reached this point in his life, we must tell you how the king and I met.\" The queen took a sip of her tea while the king settled into a more relaxed position before continuing. \"Before I became king, I went through that phase that all men and women experience at some point in their lives: running wild and disobeying their parents. I was no worse than most, although extra attention was paid to me due to my royal status. My father, the old king, was an easy going man and understood that this was just a phase. My mother, however, was not. She was from a smaller branch of the old Italian royal family and therefore was always conscious of her dignity. She convinced my father that I should be given more responsibility and her wish came true. I grew into my role as future king and my father began to step back and allow me to take the lead. On one of our many state occasions, I became acquainted with a lady, a distant cousin on my grandfather's. The Lady Alyssa, Countess of Pouters, was a woman of good breeding and perfect for a future queen.\" \"We were actually educated together,\" the queen interrupted quietly. \"I didn't know her too well, but she struck me as proud, though she was quite intelligent and knew her mind. Our families ran in the same social circles, but we were never close. In fact, if I can remember correctly, my mother and her mother had quite a history.\" \"Indeed,\" the king replied. \"We courted for just over a year before I met Clara. My duties allowed me little time to dawdle and as my father continued to defer the running of the kingdom to me, I was soon being pressured upon to marry. My parents recognized the times we were living in, of course, and would not have arranged a marriage for me, but they insisted that I start to think about settling down. Around this time, I expect, Alyssa was beginning to sense that my attention was drifting, and started to speak of marriage more often. However, while I was truly fond of her, I did not love her. When I told her I could no longer see her because there was someone else, she was gracious and kind about the matter, and we remained friends.\" \"Alyssa even became a friend of mine, though I did not consider her a confidant,\" the queen said. \"Something about her seemed strange, as if she was trying too hard to be nice. But I was too concerned with learning my role as Crown Princess and future queen. When I grew pregnant with Carlos, Alyssa was recommended as a governess by the dean of our old school.\" \"I suppose I agreed to the appointment for the guilt I had in jilting her. Once Carlos was born, Alyssa moved into the palace to take charge of the nursery. We had contact with her every day during our visits and every week we had weekly meetings with his household to ensure that everything was run accordingly. And two years later, Arabella was born.\" \"We suspected nothing until later. It was unfortunate because if we had known earlier we could have reversed the damage,\" the queen continued. \"Alyssa had never forgotten that she had lost out of a chance to become queen. Her resentment of me grew and she sought to rule our son through that. As the years passed, Carlos started to lash out. Never at his father but always at me. He was rude and disrespectful. I had no idea what to do. No amount of discipline helped. At first I consulted with Alyssa, who told me to give him some space, that perhaps it was just a phase. But alas, it just gave her more room to manipulate him.\" \"A maid in his household finally came to us and spoke about what was going on. Apparently, Alyssa was not a kind mistress to those in her employee,\" the king continued, his voice wry. \"We sent for other servants who confirmed what the maid was saying, once they were assured that they would not lose their positions. I won't go into detail about what was said but after years of poisonous whispers and manipulations, combined with a sickening maternal love, Carlos viewed her as him mother and his true mother as a usurper. A terrible revenge on us both, but she wanted to be queen and when that was denied her, she thought to rule through our son.\" Queen Clara looked at her husband, the king, with compassion, and reached over to take his hand. \"It was a terrible time and it soon grew to a public scandal, though the details were unknown to those unassociated with Carlos' household and the king's council.\" \"Carlos was never the same after the loss of Alyssa,\" the king said quietly, his tone bereft of what could have been. \"He can never assume the throne now. I must talk to the Council and Parliament about his sister taking over the duties of heir.\" There was a long pause while everyone processed what had been said. Gary found he was sorry for the king and queen, but still angry over what Carlos had done to Carmen. Yet it was Gerti who broke the silence. \"What will happen now?\" \"He will be under constant supervision. I will engage a psychotherapist and a psychologist to evaluate him. Depending on what they say, he will be medicated. But he will never be allowed the freedoms that were once his and, unfortunately, we cannot make an immediate announcement to the public about his condition. His will have no visitations except those sanctioned by his mother and I, with no access to the Internet or his phone. Until there's any improvement of his mental faculties, I am sure this will be quite a long punishment. I wish I could do more, but until we know how much is Alyssa's influence and how much is his own, this is all I can give you. But I will personally guarantee the safety of Miss Cortez; provisions will be made for her security until we can ensure that Carlos will not try to reach out to her. With your permission, of course, Mr. and Mrs. Cortez,\" he added, nodding towards the older couple across from him. \"I don't think we will need such measures but I will ask Carmen to make sure,\" Ingrid replied, graciously. \"May I ask how your daughter is doing?\" the queen asked, her brow creased with genuine concern. \"She is recovering fast – indeed, I think forced idleness is never appreciated, even when done with the best intent.\" Ingrid smiled. \"She will be fine but I think she is ready to go home.\" \"Indeed, please allow us to personally see to your travel arrangements. I am sure everyone is eager to be on their way. I can't thank you enough for what you have done for my family and for my country. I do believe a disaster has been averted, though I regret that it was done in such extreme measures. You have the gratitude of myself and my country.\" The king stood, signaling an end to the meeting. Queen Clara reached out to grasp Ingrid's hand. \"I hope that you will keep in touch as to Miss Cortez's recovery and I beg you to reach out for anything, anything at all, if you have need of assistance.\" Ingrid swallowed, touched by the queen's compassion and glad that she is not closing a door, but opening another. \"I will do so.\" Gregorio shook the king's hand, bowed to the queen, and then steered Juni out the door. He understood a parents' plight, and while he didn't condone their actions, he did wish that Alyssa had not been allowed at Court when the king and queen were newlyweds. So much could have been averted by that one single action. But he was too old to regret and besides, everything in hindsight is almost always viewed with a glimmer of guilt. \"Mr. Giggles, if you have a moment to spare before going back to your rooms?\" the queen asked as Gary bowed over her hand. He raised an eyebrow but nodded and waited for the room to clear. Gerti shot him once last glance before leaving, the door closing softly behind her. \"Thank you, Mr. Giggles,\" the queen said. \"I am sure that, aside from Carmen, you were the second most to be affected by Carlos' actions against you.\" She looked at him knowingly. He nodded, wondering where this conversation is going. \"I can see you have feelings for her,\" she said with a small smile, as if she could read what he was thinking. \"I don't deny it,\" he said proudly, but blushing all the same. \"We've known each other a long time, Carmen and I, and it hurt me almost as much as her to see her put into such a position.\" The king looked on respectfully, interested, but it seemed like he would allow his wife to take the lead in this conversation. \"I am glad of it. I am sure your own mother could say this to you, and Mrs. Cortez as well, but because my son is incapacitated, and he is the one who initiated the damage in the first place, I wish to pass on a bit of advice my mother said to me and my husband. I speak to you now not as a queen, but woman, and a woman who has lived for quite some time. You will have many women in your life, just as Carmen will have many men in her life. But none should matter much as the one you truly love. If, and I believe this to be true, you love Carmen, you should protect her, honor her, and love her. Give her space when she needs it; allow her time with her friends; get to know those in her life as she should get to know those in your life; but above all, respect her choices. Give each other room to make mistakes. Be angry with each other. Be sad together. But never forget that no matter how many hurdles life throws your way, together you can accomplish anything. The definition of love is not in loving each other, but loving life together: as friends, as partners, and as lovers.\" The king took the queen's hand and smiled at Gary, nodding pleasantly. \"You two have been through much together but you've already jumped over one exceedingly difficult hurdle. Never forget this.\" Gary swallowed, tears threatening to spill over. His own father was a weakling, ambitious, but petty and mean in the end. His mother had been in out of the picture for years. To have strangers speak to him of love and life, giving him advice with a woman who knew he loved (though she may not know it) was astounding. \"Thank you, your majesties. I will remember what you have said.\" They nodded, smiling and watching him bow and leave the room. Somehow, Gary suspected, in some small way, they wished their own son had turned out like him. Carmen was glad to be leaving the palace. After the initial examination and several nights as an in-patient, she was discharged and given a guest room in the palace. It was as expensive as the room she had on Carlos' yacht, but nowhere near as sumptuous. She suspected that his mother had more of a simple, elegant taste than her son. She knew her family and the Giggles had gone to a meeting with the king and queen, but she had yet to see them herself. In fact, even though her mother and Gerti had told her all that was said, despite their firm objections, she was not sure she wanted to meet with them herself. Gerti told her they were kind, and that she would have liked the Princess Arabella. But in truth, she just wanted to put the whole escapade behind her. Yet fate would not let her. Just as she dressing herself from a long hot shower, someone knocked on the door. \"Come in!\" she called from the bathroom. She heard the door open (\"Be right there!\") she called. When she came out, her hair still wet from her shower, she was startled to see a woman with dark hair like her own, sitting on the bed, a small package sitting next to her. \"Oh!\" she said, rather stupidly. The woman smiled. \"Hello Miss Cortez. You may call me Ms. Clara if you wish.\" Carmen just stared at her, before comprehension dawned on her face. \"Oh! Your Majesty!\" She did a half bob-half curtsey. The queen laughed pleasantly. \"Please don't. I get enough of that when I leave my bedroom. Will you sit down?\" Carmen sat on an ottoman, stunned into silence with this charming woman who was royalty. \"I can't be that scary, can I?\" The queen asked, a twinkle in her eye. Mutely, she shook her head. But suddenly remembering that she had a mouth, she spoke up, her voice quiet. \"No, of course not, your – Ms. Clara.\" \"I know that you are leaving this afternoon, but I wanted to give you something. A gift from my husband, and from myself. And I also wanted to apologize personally to you for what my son has done to you and yours. I am sure you will hear what was discussed at the meeting, if you have not heard about it already.\" \"Ms. Clara, there is no need. It is part of my job.\" \"This may be true, but I doubt your job requires you to be as emotionally, and, uh, physically distressed as you have been during this assignment. Please. No woman should be subjected to what you have endured, and I am ashamed to admit even to myself that the perpetrator is my own son.\" Carmen sensed this woman would not let it go until she forgiven for not taking charge of her child as any normal mother would have. So, she nodded. \"I accept your apology, then, You Majesty,\" using the queen's title to indicate the genuine acknowledgement of their distress towards the situation. The queen swallowed and one tear escaped her eye before she quickly wiped it away. \"Thank you, my dear. And now, I have a gift for you. The king wished we could deliver it together, but his meeting with council is sadly taking longer than expected. But he does send his heartfelt good wishes to you and wants you to know that this belonged to his grandmother. It was intended for his sister, but unfortunately, she passed away at a young age and he could not bear to part from it. Until now.\" She handed the package to Carmen, who took it with wonderment. Her family connections had not denied her wealth, but this was the first gift she had received from royalty. \"Open it, my dear.\" She unwrapped the pretty paper, and gasped to see a small wooden box inlaid with precious stones and the edges gilded with silver. Upon opening it, she saw it was lined in velvet with a small silver key, attached to a green ribbon, placed on top of a plush pillow. \"This is beautiful!\" \"It belonged to a distant relative from his grandmother's side: a French princess. It's an antique, as I'm sure you've realized, dating back to the 17th century from an ancestor of his grandmother's: a French Princess of the Blood, I believe. He wanted to give it to his future daughter-in-law, but due to recent happenings, I think he decided to give it to someone much more worthy.\" \"Ms. Clara, I cannot accept this,\" Carmen said seriously. \"It's beautiful but if its worth as much as you say, I am not worthy you of it. Truly.\" The queen shook her head and took her hand. \"Carmen – may I call you that? – you have endured much. While normally we would not wish to give anything, even a small token, to someone who has been what you have been through, we both believe that you deserve this and so much more. You saved our country from ruin, you saved our family from destruction, and you have opened our eyes to what an unfortunate son we have. All at the peril of your own physical and mental health. Our gratitude knows no bounds and this is the only way we can thank you. Please take the box.\" Carmen started to cry, overwhelmed at such a kind gesture from a beautiful queen. She nodded, unable to speak. The queen dried her eyes with her own handkerchief and smiled at her. \"Such beautiful eyes you have, my dear. Use them to your advantage. I know of a certain young man who is very impatient to see you since your mother and sister have kept him away.\" She winked. \"Perhaps you can fill this box with keepsakes that I know he will give you in the future.\" Carmen watched, completely astonished, as the queen stood up and smoothed her dress down. She had all but revealed that she knew of Gary's feelings for her and had suspected hers were the same. \"I may be the same age as your mother, but never forget we women of older years have known the happiness of a first, and lasting, love.\" She smiled pleasantly and opened the door, before turning back. \"Good luck to you both, dear, sweet Carmen. And if you need honeymoon ideas, or anything else for that matter, you can always call on me.\" The queen's chuckle was heard echoing in Carmen's mind even after the door had closed and she had long closed her open mouth. Gary and Carmen hadn't spoken much on the flight home, as they were both exhausted from their ordeal. Gerti and Juni played card games and kept watch at the clouds passing by while Gregorio and Ingrid sat hands clasped, alternating between watching their children and watching a spy movie. By the time they arrived home in California, all six were ready for a long sleep. In truth, it was several days before Gary and Carmen could speak quietly. They had to report to the OSS on their mission (despite the Director being Carmen's father, rules were rules) and both needed to adjust to the time difference which was quite the opposite from where they were. So it wasn't until the Friday of after their return that they could meet. They chose a public spot, a small café outside of Napa. They could see the vineyards from their seat outside and they sat quietly, neither knowing where to begin but aware that there was tension in every bone of their bodies. \"Carmen, I – \" \"Gary, you should know – \" They started at the same time, stopped, and then burst out laughing at the absurdness of their behavior. \"You'd think we were still two pre-teens on their first date,\" Carmen said. \"Psh, did we ever really grow up?\" Gary replied, a sly smile on his lips. \"No. I did, but you did not.\" He mock-glared at her before sighing and turning serious. \"Do you want to talk about what's happened?\" Carmen looked at him thoughtfully for a long time. But then she slowly shook her head. \"No, not really. Perhaps one day, but not now. He could have done worse and even what he did accomplish will give me nightmares. For now, however, it's enough to know that he's locked up on the side of the world and I am here, in sunny California. As far away as I could hope for.\" Gary nodded, accepting her answer. He was relieved. The whole plane ride home he mulled over what the queen had said to him and she was right. And he found himself glad that she was right. \"Very well. So what happens now?\" He smiled and took her hand. \"I don't know, what would you like to happen?\" she replied, her eyes twinkling, as relieved as he about the change of conversation. \"Well, perhaps, and this is just a suggestion, but how about I take you to dinner at Traditions? That really fancy Italian place you like? And then maybe we can go for a boat ride after?\" Carmen looked at him, her eyes full of love. \"That sounds like a perfectly reasonable suggestion and I think you should arrange it.\" His look, mirroring hers in mutual love and understanding, told her everything. And when their lips touched, it was as if the world was finally coming to rights again. . . . From across the street, Gerti and Juni watched their siblings finally come together. \"Its about time,\" Juni said as they turned and made their way back to the car. \"I agree,\" Gerti replied. \"It won't be perfect, but if they can survive Monaco, than they can survive anything,.\" Juni nodded. He opened the door for Gerti then quickly slid in to the other side. \"So where now? I'm not too keen on spying on them for the rest of my life, however interesting it may be.\" Gerti smiled at him, her first crush and finally her best friend. \"Let's just take a drive, shall we?\" End.

She sighed slightly softly as she looked rather sad. \"I hope you're proud, Mum...\" she whispered before looking up into the sky with a lone tear rolling down her cheek. \"Wherever you are...\" She soon went inside to greet her siblings. Everyone was happy to see Bridget come home, especially Ferb and Perry. \"Oh, there you are, Bridget.\" Phineas smiled. \"Hey, Phineas.\" Bridget said. \"Oh, Bridget, you're just in time for dinner, I ordered pizza.\" Linda smiled. \"Thanks, Lin-Mum.\" Bridget smiled back. Soon, everyone came into the kitchen, but Bridget sighed as she looked down to the floor. \"What is it, dear?\" Lawrence looked concerned for his daughter. Bridget looked up to her father. \"It's...\" she then looked down and softly as she thought about her biological mother. \"Nothing...\" \"Are you sure?\" Lawrence asked. Bridget looked back with a sigh. \"It's been eight years...\" \"Oh...\" Lawrence now knew what she was going on about. \"Your mother... I know, dear, I miss her too.\" Later on, Linda had a letter for the kids. Bridget did her best to keep up appearances for her younger siblings and looked over. \"Oh, what's that, luv?\" Lawrence smiled to Linda once he saw the letter. \"It's a letter from a friend of mine.\" Linda smiled back. \"And what's her/his name?\" Lawrence asked. \"Gregorio Cortez.\" Linda replied. \"What's it say, Mom?\" Candace asked. \" 'Dear Linda, how are you?', \" Linda read the letter aloud to her family and even Perry was listening. \" 'I was wondering if you would like some family and friends to maybe come over and we can catch up together. We have so much to catch up with and I hear your son Phineas is quite the genius himself. Hope to see you soon, Gregorio Cortez' .\" \"Can we go, Mom?\" Phineas asked with a smile. \"Well... I suppose that would be all right.\" Linda smiled back. \"Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today.\" Phineas told his step-brother. Ferb nodded in agreement as he knew the same thing. Perry even chattered in agreement. \"Well, then we better finish dinner.\" Linda said. The family agreed and then began to eat. After they ate, Bridget stared out the window while Candace packed and told Stacey on her phone all about what was going on. And where Phineas and Ferb were both excited about this as they packed. Back home... \"Be sure to eat some spinach, guys!\" Michelle called out to Cherry and Atticus as they had dinner together. Cherry narrowed her eyes and looked around before using her powers and she opened her eyes with a gasp. \"I... I did it...\" she said. \"I... I changed the spinach...\" she then picked up a chicken nugget she made and ate it. \"And it tastes juicy!\" \"Thank you again for allowing me to spend the night over, Mrs. Butler.\" Atticus smiled. \"No problem, Atticus!\" Michelle called back. Atticus soon finished the food on his plate. Cherry smiled as she enjoyed her chicken nuggets a lot. \"You really got the hang of your powers, Cherry.\" Atticus smiled proudly. \"Thanks.\" Cherry smiled back. She then made a cake that was like the cake that Mr. and Mrs. Cake made known as the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. \"Cool.\" Atticus smiled. \"Well, now it's time for dessert.\" Cherry smirked as she wanted to taste such cake since she saw the episode which always worked up her appetite. \"It sure is.\" Atticus said. The phone soon rang which meant Michelle would be on the phone. Atticus then used his magic to close the door since Cherry's parents were often loud on the phone. \"Thanks.\" Cherry said. \"Sure thing.\" Atticus said before he took a piece of the cake to try it. \"I swear, the first time I saw this cake, I was trying to eat the screen.\" Cherry said as she took her own chunk of the cake to eat it. \"I know what you mean.\" Atticus smiled. The two then shared their cake together. Michelle soon knocked and came to the door. \"Cherry, your sister called, she was wondering if you'd like to visit her with a friend.\" she then told her daughter with a smile. \"Terry...?\" Cherry's eyes widened with glee. \"She'd love to visit.\" Atticus told Michelle. \"Does everybody just talk for me now?\" Cherry muffled with her mouth full. \"Oh, who am I kidding? This is my sister!\" \"I'll tell her that you both are coming then.\" Michelle smiled. \"Okay.\" Atticus and Cherry muffled as they ate more and more cake. \"Hey, slow down on that cake!\" Michelle told them. \"You'll be just like Little Audrey and get the tummy ache blues!\" \"Okay, we'll slow down.\" Atticus muffled. Michelle soon took some of the cake herself to try it out and moaned hungrily and happily. \"Mm! I see why they call it that.\" She then chuckled on her way out of the room. After finishing the cake, Atticus and Cherry both went to pack. \"How you holding up without Mo?\" Cherry asked Atticus since Mo had gone away for a week to visit James's brother-in-law and niece who moved to a new environment where a little pet shop would be. \"It's been a challenge.\" Atticus said. \"Eh, you'll live...\" Cherry shrugged. \"I know...\" Atticus pouted. \"I just hope Blythe is a nice girl.\" \"I'm sure she is.\" Cherry said. \"Have you met her?\" Atticus asked. \"If I did, I don't remember...\" Cherry replied. \"I think her mother's name was Lauren though.\" \"That's good.\" Atticus said. \"We'll leave bright and early tomorrow morning.\" Bud said as he read the newspaper. Cherry and Atticus nodded as that meant that Cherry would stay up as late as possible so she could sleep on the way without getting herself carsick, not knowing that they would see some people that they've met before. The sun was almost coming up the next morning and Cherry was very tired and miserable. \"I know, dear, I know, but you can sleep the whole ride over...\" Michelle soothed as she wrapped her daughter in a blanket. \"Great.\" Cherry yawned. Michelle put a pillow under her head. \"Now remember, you'll meet Teresa and she'll take you guys to where she wants to take you.\" she then told Atticus since Cherry was close to falling asleep and would likely not remember as well. \"I'll remember.\" Atticus said. Michelle nodded to this and shut the door so they could get going on the road. They soon drove off. Cherry yawned and curled up, falling asleep instantly. Atticus was happy that his best friend was getting sleep. Cherry snorted and snored slightly, but that just meant she had fallen asleep. Atticus yawned as he decided to get a bit of sleep himself as it was going to be a long ride until they would meet Teresa and she would take it from there and where it really did help. About six and a half hours later... \"Cherry, wake up...\" Atticus nudged her. Cherry moaned and turned over. \"Oh, fine, I'll just turn myself around and go home if you just wanna sleep.\" Teresa's voice teased. Cherry soon woke up instantly from her sister's voice. Teresa giggled and soon hugged Cherry. \"Hi, Terry!\" Cherry hugged her sister back. \"Hey, Cherry,\" Teresa smiled. \"How's Dad?\" \"He's great.\" Cherry said. Atticus soon walked over and gently shook Teresa's hand. \"Still working out I see.\" Teresa giggled to Atticus. \"I sure have.\" Atticus smiled. Teresa then helped Cherry and Atticus into her car. \"Hopefully I'm not too busy with work.\" \"Oh, you have a new job?\" Cherry asked. \"Well, I help out at this special school with certain special students,\" Teresa replied. \"I'm a teacher's aid. I'm close with these two students named Carmen and Juni Cortez who don't know their family secret just yet, I've been keeping it hidden from them ever since I was trusted with my new job, but something in my gut tells me that they'll find out about it soon.\" \"I agree.\" Atticus said. \"You can trust us, Terry...\" Cherry told her sister. \"Remember Mr. Chairman?\" \"I remember.\" Teresa said. \"So, what's their story?\" Atticus asked. Teresa sighed in defeat. \"Very well...\" She then said to her sister and her best friend. \"They're the children of secret agents who were once rivals until they fell in love and got married.\" \"Aw!\" A voice from Atticus's bag awed. Teresa looked to Cherry and Atticus to see which one of them said that, not knowing it was someone else. Atticus soon sighed as he unzipped his bag as he had a feeling he knew who it was. Patch poked his head out with a smile. \"Oh, Patch, hello,\" Teresa smiled to the young Dalmatian. \"Oh, Atticus, where did you get that rope collar for Patch?\" \"Kinda hard to explain, but it just came on his neck one day when his old collar snapped off,\" Atticus replied from memory. \"Anyways, Patch, how did you get in my bag without me knowing?\" \"I used a teleportation spell that Salem taught me.\" Patch smiled sheepishly. \"Oh...\" Atticus said. \"Salem still a cat?\" Teresa asked. \"Yeah, I think he said he had like 50 years to go...\" Cherry tried to remember. \"Wow.\" Teresa said. She continued to drive along until she would get to their stop and there seemed to be another car heading in the same way. Atticus looked out the window in surprise. \"That looks like Uncle Lawrence's car.\" \"It is his car.\" Patch said as he saw the car. The two cars soon stopped at a red light. Atticus rolled down his window as Phineas and Ferb did the same and they all smiled to each other. This seemed like fate did this for them. Patch soon made silly faces with Perry. Perry soon did the same thing once Lawrence and Linda weren't noticing. \"What is taking the light so long?!\" Candace complained. \"I'm running out of signal here which means I can't text Jeremy!\" \"Don't worry, Candace; the light will change soon.\" Lawrence assured his step-daughter. Soon enough, the light did change and they could go on. \"Hm... That woman kinda looked like that pop star I liked when I was younger,\" Teresa commented. \"I believe her name was... Lindana.\" \"I think that might have been her.\" Atticus said. The cars soon pulled up in the same driveway. Teresa then came to talk with Lawrence and Linda and it turns out that she was an old friend of Ingrid's and was also a teacher's aid for Carmen and Juni's school. Talk about coincidences. 'This is like fate.' Cherry thought to herself. \"Don't tell me we're going to school with the kids,\" Candace complained. \"They wear uniforms!\" \"Oh, come on, Candace; not all schools have uniforms.\" Atticus said. \"Yeah, but this one does!\" Candace complained. \"It's true, like I said, it's a very special school.\" Teresa confirmed. \"Oh, great.\" Cherry rolled her eyes. Teresa soon showed uniforms for Cherry and Atticus which were like the Crystal Prep uniforms only red, white, and black. \"Oh, great.\" Atticus complained. \"I promise, guys, this will be temporary.\" Teresa told her sister and friend. \"This better be worth it,\" Cherry rolled her eyes at the uniforms. \"They're like Crystal Prep's but worse!\" \"You said it.\" Atticus said. Teresa sighed to them, she knew that uniforms weren't the best, but it was part of the assignment. \"Atticus, I'm doing this for you,\" she told her sister's best friend. \"Your father has been so busy lately in the Netherworld as the Wiccan King, so only you can take this assignment in his absence. This is bigger than the Blue Monkey diamond.\" \"How big?\" Atticus asked. \"It's very urgent and the kids don't even know their parents are secret agents, it'll take their help too,\" Teresa replied. \"After this adventure, they'll become Spy Kids.\" \"Does this include Phineas and Ferb?\" Atticus asked. \"Hmm...\" Teresa replied. \"I hadn't thought about that actually.\" \"Well, Bridget is a spy and she is their sister...\" Atticus shrugged. \"True.\" Teresa nodded. \"So?\" Atticus asked. \"It might be for the best,\" Teresa replied. \"Phineas and Ferb are very extraordinary boys, I've been watching them during their summer vacation.\" \"Is that why you haven't come to visit us on Dad's birthday?\" Cherry deadpanned since Bud's birthday was in July. \"Well, the work of a spy keeps rather busy.\" Teresa said. \"Mm...\" Cherry hummed about this, but at least she now knew why her sister was always so busy these days. \"Anyway, where are we staying?\" Patch asked. \"I booked a hotel not too far away from the Cortez residence,\" Teresa replied. \"It looks like they're full enough with the Flynn-Fletchers visiting.\" \"Wow.\" Cherry said. \"Well, what did you expect?\" Teresa shrugged to her younger sister. \"Good point.\" Cherry said. They soon came to the hotel and were given their own room. Cherry and Teresa would stay in one bed while Atticus and Patch would stay in the other. Once they were settled in, Cherry soon called her parents to let them know they made it there okay and they were settling in now after her father left over 450 messages and missed calls. \"Yikes!\" Cherry said. Atticus chuckled as he found that kind of funny. \"Dad, don't have a heart attack, I just didn't have service during the six hour drive!\" Cherry narrowed her eyes in annoyance. \"WHAT?! No, I most certainly did not meet a boy you don't know!\" 'You sure?' Bud's voice asked. \"Yes, Dad...\" Cherry rolled her eyes. 'That's good.' Bud's voice said. \"We're fine, Dad,\" Cherry replied. \"We're in a hotel now.\" 'That's a relief.' Bud's voice said. Cherry made her hand move like a rambling mouth as her father asked her questions. Atticus could already tell Cherry wasn't liking to be asked many questions. Cherry then made a crazy gesture while her father kept talking and she put down the phone while he talked on and on until Michelle stepped in and talked with him and he ended up talking with his wife. Atticus chuckled as some of the argument didn't make sense. \"You are so lucky that your parents don't have to behave like that.\" Cherry said. \"Oh, I don't know, Mom tends to worry her head sometimes...\" Atticus chuckled. \"Sometimes when the dogs are home late, Mo acts like a paranoid mother. It just makes me wonder what she'd be like if we had kids.\" \"So, I guess every parent acts differently.\" Cherry said. \"I just know that if you mess with me or my brothers and sisters, my parents get scary.\" Patch commented. \"Yikes.\" Cherry repeated. \"I remember when they got vicious with Horace and Jasper.\" Patch memorized his first ever adventure. \"Well, that just shows to never kidnap anyone's kid.\" Atticus said. Patch nodded in firm agreement. Teresa soon came into the room to check on them. \"Here, talk to Dad.\" Cherry handed her phone to her sister. \"Let me guess, he was talking your ears off?\" Teresa giggled a bit. Cherry nodded. Teresa took the phone and pulled an odd look. \"Um, Dad is saying to your mom something about hot sauce?\" \"They always argue about nonsense.\" Cherry replied. \"True.\" Teresa said. Bud and Michelle soon hung up so they could get some sleep. \"Finally...\" Cherry lay down and yawned sleepily. \"Man, that travel was crazy.\" \"It sure was...\" Atticus agreed. \"Let's get some sleep.\" \"Yeah.\" Patch yawned. Soon enough, everyone went straight to bed and where nothing ruined their night.[Chapter 2] The next morning soon came and everyone groaned since Teresa set an alarm for before 7:00 since she had to get to work. Atticus soon slammed his fist down on the clock. Teresa winced at that as it destroyed under his hand. Atticus then smiled as he fell back asleep. \"Should have seen that coming.\" Teresa sighed. She then yanked off the blankets to wake everyone up. Cherry shivered and tried to reach for the blanket. \"Rise and shine, everybody, school day!\" Teresa told her guests. \"This better not be like this every day.\" Cherry groaned. Teresa sighed to them, she then went to get ready since she was the most awake. Atticus soon went to get ready next. Patch was literally dragging Cherry out of bed and wouldn't let her alone until she would move on her own. \"Alright, alright.\" Cherry groaned. Patch soon stopped with a smirk. Cherry groaned as she forced herself to get ready for the day. They took some breakfast in the car and Teresa drove them to the school. \"Try not to mess up your uniforms, guys.\" Teresa said on the way along. \"Try telling that to Atticus's muscles.\" Cherry said. \"These sleeves are tight, Teresa!\" Atticus pouted. \"I'm sorry, but it's the best I can do.\" Teresa replied. Atticus soon secretly used his magic and made his uniform much more comfier before it would burst. Patch smiled as he knew that would be much better for his human. \"Wait, so where am I going?\" he then asked. \"Yes... Where is Patch going...?\" Teresa smirked to Atticus. \"Hiding him in your backpack.\" \"You say that like you know.\" Atticus smiled nervously. \"I used to do the same thing with Oreo.\" Teresa chuckled. \"You named your pet after a cookie?\" Patch asked. Teresa stopped the car when they came to a red light and took out a childhood photograph of herself as a little girl hugging a black dog that had a white stripe in the middle of his body. \"Ohh.\" Patch smiled. Teresa then put her photograph back and smiled. \"He was my best friend back then, he always comforted me whenever Dad and my mom disagreed on anything that would turn into a fight.\" \"Aw, poor Terry~\" Cherry cooed to her sister. \"He must have been a great dog.\" Patch smiled. \"He really was...\" Teresa smiled back. \"So, you know about me putting Patch in my backpack?\" Atticus asked. \"Yeah, it's a classic, especially when you're new or isolated in a school.\" Teresa nodded before she looked back out to the road. \"Cool.\" Atticus smiled. The other car seemed to have trouble as they nearly ran over the crossing guard. \"I'm sorry! I'm sorry!\" The man told her. Soon enough, kids came out in the uniforms with Phineas, Ferb, and Candace. \"I so hate this.\" Candace groaned. \"Juni, Juni.\" The man called for his younger son. Juni turned to him and came toward his father. \"If anybody gives you a hard time in there, remember, you are a Cortez.\" Gregorio advised. \"What's so great about being a Cortez?\" Juni asked as he left for school. \"Lots of things!\" Gregorio told him as the bell rang. Another boy came to Juni and looked like he would pick on him. \"Hey, that looks like a bully.\" Phineas narrowed his eyes which was a rare sight since he was almost always happy. \"Shall I?\" Ferb asked as he held out his hand to give a nerve pinch to knock the bully out. \"If he tries anything; I'll teach him a lesson.\" Atticus assured Phineas and Ferb. \"Atticus!\" Phineas and Ferb smiled. Atticus smiled back and soon shared a hug with the step-brothers. \"How are you two doing? Still inventing?\" He smiled. \"Yeah, but not so much since school's back in session, but at least we have science class.\" Phineas smiled back. \"Yeah and knowing you two, you'll blow your teachers' minds.\" Atticus smiled back. \"Hey, it's the mummy,\" A boy mocked Juni. \"Nice looking bandages, Mummy.\" Atticus would have taught that boy a lesson, but to stay out of trouble, Ferb went to do his signature move on the boy which was hurting the boy, but just knocking him out with a pressure hold. The boy soon groaned and fell to the floor. Juni's eyes widened and he then turned to the green-haired boy nervously. \"Don't worry about Ferb, he won't hurt you.\" Phineas told Juni. Ferb nodded in agreement. \"Um... Hi, Ferb...\" Juni waved nervously. Ferb waved back, not saying a word. \"Cool dolls!\" Phineas saw the toys in Juni's hands. \"They're action figures.\" Juni said. \"Oh... Sorry,\" Phineas replied. \"Cool action figures.\" \"They're Fooglies.\" Juni smiled as someone had taken an interest in what he liked. \"Cool, me and Ferb watch that every morning.\" Phineas smiled. Ferb nodded in agreement. Juni smiled as he felt like he found some true friends. Teresa smiled to this herself. \"I made my own character on the ride over, I guess I could show you.\" Juni said to his new friends. \"We did too.\" Phineas smiled. Juni smiled as this was turning out to be a great day of school for him. \"Man, I don't know anybody here,\" Candace sighed. \"I wish Stacey where here.\" \"Did I hear my best friend say my name?\" A familiar voice asked. \"Oh, hey, Stacey,\" Candace replied before doing a double take. \"Stacey! What're you doing here?!\" \"Your sister told me I could come,\" Stacey said before smirking playfully. \"Along with a certain someone you might know.\" \"Y-Yeah...?\" Candace asked. \"Hey, Candace.\" A blonde boy smiled to the redheaded girl. \"Jeremy!\" Candace smiled. Jeremy gave Candace a hug which made her blush happily. \"I really missed you during that college tour,\" he said to her. \"I thought I'd make it up by coming with Stacey after Bridget invited us to transfer here temporarily.\" \"Awww!\" Candace smiled. The bell soon rang which made everybody come inside the school. Teresa soon left to get on the mission. \"There she goes again...\" Cherry sighed as her sister was gone again while scratching her skirt. Everyone soon got to their classes. \"I even have to share a room with him since he's so afraid to be alone,\" Carmen was complaining about her brother to her friend as they walked down the hallway together. \"'Watch out for Juni', 'Take care of Juni', 'Show Juni right from wrong'. I shouldn't be responsible for anybody, but me.\" 'Wow, she's being rather selfish.' Cherry thought to herself. \"You're so right, Carmen.\" The girl agreed with her friend. \"What's so special about being a Cortez?\" Juni sulked as he held out his favorite action figure. \"I wish I could go away to your world, Floop. You'd be my friend.\" 'Looks like both of these two need to be a lesson.' Atticus thought to himself. Phineas and Ferb did their best to comfort Juni. \"Thanks, guys.\" Juni sighed sadly as he set down his Floop action figure.[Chapter 3] Meanwhile with Teresa and Bridget... \"Ah, Teresa, glad you could make it.\" Bridget smiled to her partner. \"Wouldn't miss it.\" Teresa said. Bridget and Teresa then went to where their mission had called them upon and where they went down the same road as the Cortez parents. Teresa hugged Gregorio and Ingrid after meeting them out of their cars after they came together. \"It's great to finally meet you.\" Ingrid said. \"Likewise,\" Teresa smiled. \"Come on, let's go find some good seats.\" \"Agreed.\" Bridget nodded. They came in as the meeting was about to begin. \"I thank you all for attending today's demonstration,\" A man smiled to the crowd. \"Mr. Floop is one such visionary. However, his inventions are somewhat questionable and, therefore, need to be evaluated,\" he then looked to the purple-suited man. \"You promised us an army, Mr. Floop, but our first billion dollars bought us only this,\" he then gestured to strange creatures. \"Mutated secret agents.\" \"Ahem.\" A male voice cleared his throat. \"Oh, I'm so sorry, sir; I didn't know you would be here.\" The man said. Out from the shadows, Sombra is soon shown as a strong man. Teresa shook a chill down her spine, but kept quiet. \"You are forgiven, just don't let it happen again.\" Sombra warned. \"Y-Yes, sir.\" The man gulped. \"Now, Floop, show these people what you are working on.\" Sombra said. \"Right...\" Floop nodded as he spoke up to the crowd. \"I have found little use for them except as novelties on my, well, my children's show, currently rated number two?\" A man who stood by then held up two fingers to help him say that. \"Number two.\" Floop then nodded again. 'This is the guy?' Teresa thought to herself. Then suddenly, a few figures came over. \"And, Mr. Floop, would you tell Mr. Lisp, who these would be?\" Sombra replied. \"What the devil?\" The other man asked Floop. \"Are these finger men?\" \"Not exactly.\" Sombra said. \"They're called Thumb-Thumbs,\" Floop grinned proudly. \"Very capable robots.\" \"Unfortunately, they can't catch anything thrown at them.\" Sombra said. Mr. Lisp looked over and then tossed over a binder to test that theory. One tried to catch it only for it to hit the other. \"All thumbs,\" Mr. Lisp muttered to this. \"Useless.\" \"Show them your newest project, Floop.\" Sombra said. \"Mr. Lisp, I think you'll enjoy this,\" Floop put his arm around the other man as he walked him down the stairs. \"Through that door, an awesome power will emerge. You will have but a moment to disarm it. In exactly ten seconds.\" Sombra soon removed the tables with ease so then whatever came out of the doors, the tables would be out of the way. The others murmured to themselves about how strong Sombra was. Floop began to count down from ten. Sombra soon let the tables land on top of the men besides Floop and Lisp. Teresa and Bridget's eyes widened to this. The doors soon opened as Floop got down to 'one' and a young boy appeared to be rushing over into the room. \"Johnny?\" Mr. Lisp asked out of surprise only to be jumped over and where Johnny soon flipped Mr. Lisp. \"You hesitated.\" Floop smirked to this. \"I had to!\" Mr. Lisp replied. \"He's my son!\" \"Are you sure?\" Sombra smirked. Johnny's eyes showed that he wasn't human. \"Actually, I designed him,\" Floop smirked to Mr. Lisp as he looked in shock. \"I built him! His name is-...\" Sombra checked the name tag. \"'X-2945'.\" \"The Second.\" Floop then added. \"And not just your child, Lisp.\" Sombra smirked. \"This is your big idea?!\" Mr. Lisp gawked at Floop. \"Robot kids that look like my children?\" A young girl then came beside him in the same outfit as the Johnny robot. \"The President's Daughter?\" Mr. Lisp asked. \"Another robot.\" Sombra smirked. The female robot then grabbed Mr. Lisp with a smirk and flung him forward. \"An almost-exact replica.\" Floop also smirked. \"For you see, if you want to think big!\" Sombra shouted. \"You have to think small,\" Floop whispered before putting his hands on the robot heads and spoke normally again. \"Through physio-electrical imaging, I can make them look like anyone yet the cunning and intelligence of the world's greatest espionage agents all rolled into tiny packages I call 'Spy Kids'.\" \"But they're not quite finished yet.\" Sombra said. \"Tell me, Spy Kids,\" Mr. Lisp looked down to the two. \"With your vast stores of knowledge what are four of the five physiological indications that a human being is lying?\" The spy kids soon prove Sombra's point as the two spy kids only start mumbling. Floop then covered their mouths. \"They're not quite finished,\" he told Lisp. \"Missing one crucial element.\" \"What?\" Mr. Lisp asked. \"Their brains.\" Sombra replied. Mr. Lisp was about to shout at them only to be throat lifted by Sombra. \"I think your time with us is up.\" Sombra glared. \"Okay, okay, we'll give you time to send us your report.\" Mr. Lisp gagged before being thrown out of the room. \"That was brilliant, sirs.\" The other man told them. \"Thank you, Minion.\" Floop nodded to him. \"Has the Third Brain been found?\" Sombra asked. \"I shall look into it, sir.\" Minion nodded to him, giving him the same respect he gave for Floop. \"Good.\" Sombra said. Teresa and Bridget looked to each other before sneaking off. Sombra watched them and narrowed his eyes slightly. Meanwhile... \"I have to leave.\" Gregorio said as Linda and Ingrid were catching up. \"What is it?\" Lawrence asked. \"You're going where?\" Ingrid added. \"On assignment.\" Gregorio replied, but said nothing else since Linda and Lawrence were innocent witnesses. Ingrid knew exactly what that meant. \"Business trip, I take it.\" Lawrence replied. \"Uh, exactly.\" Gregorio nodded to him. \"Can I come with you?\" Ingrid asked her husband. \"Ingrid, you're always looking to go on another mission, but we have children now,\" Gregorio whispered to his wife. \"We can't both leave.\" Ingrid knew how to let her husband let her come along. \"I want to go on an adventure,\" she told him as an act of persuasion. \"I want to save the world.\" \"Again?\" Gregorio sighed. \"Honey, it's old... If it wasn't for Donnagon and the other agents, I-I would be turning this mission down myself, I mean clearly.\" \"You're turning me down?~\" Ingrid smirked. \"Me, Spy Boy?\" She soon got closer to him. Perry's eyes widened as he watched this. 'Oh, my...' the platypus thought to himself. Gregorio soon gave into his wife's seduction, but they still had their kids to think about. They decided to call someone over to watch the kids while they would be gone. Juni had a great day at school thanks to Phineas and Ferb being his new best friends. \"You guys sure are better than Carmen.\" \"Aw, don't say that, your sister loves you.\" Phineas comforted. \"She is rather lovely too.\" Ferb whispered. \"Did you say something, Ferb?\" Juni asked. Ferb only muttered while blushing. \"I'm sure Ferb just means that sisters are a good thing, we've got two of 'em.\" Phineas said to Juni. \"Your sisters must be fun then and don't call you two names.\" Juni said. Cherry and Atticus soon came after them since school was over. 'Back to the hotel.' Patch thought to himself.[Chapter 4] Teresa was still gone however. \"This is kinda cheating, but since we're not really students...\" Atticus said before magicking their homework done since it was a lot. \"Now why don't you do that for my Math homework instead of tutoring me?\" Cherry scoffed. \"Why do you think?\" Atticus asked. Cherry soon sighed out of defeat. \"It would be cheating.\" \"Exactly.\" Atticus said. \"Can't ya just do some of the fractions?\" Cherry smiled nervously. \"No.\" Atticus said. \"What kind of friend are you?\" Cherry pouted. \"The one that helps you by tutoring you.\" Atticus said. Cherry stuck her tongue out. Atticus did the same thing to her. Patch came to them and chuckled. Cherry and Atticus then turned to him. \"So, what now?\" Patch asked. \"Teresa still isn't back,\" Cherry commented. \"I'm getting worried... Do you think maybe someone found out about her?\" \"No way.\" Atticus said. \"Then where could she be?\" Cherry sulked. \"I bet she just got too busy for me... Again...\" Patch could tell that Cherry was sad now since he got to know her a little bit longer. \"Aw, Cherry, don't be sad.\" \"It's okay, I'm used to disappointments in my life...\" Cherry sighed. \"Sometimes I just wonder why I even bother.\" \"Cherry, I'm sure that her mission is hard and is taking her and Bridget longer than usual.\" Atticus said. Cherry sulked. Atticus hummed as he tried to cheer her up. \"Hmm...\" Cherry went over to her bed and laid down as she put the blanket over her, not going to sleep, but felt quite miserable. Atticus soon came up with an idea. \"Oh, Cherry?~\" \"Go away,\" Cherry mumbled. \"I wanna be alone.\" \"Oh, what a shame...\" Atticus sighed. \"I guess I'll have to eat all of this cheesecake by myself.\" That seemed to do the trick as Cherry came out. \"Where's the cheesecake?\" Cherry looked all around. \"Actually, that's for dessert, I ordered some Chinese food for our dinner with plenty of shrimp and crab meat.\" Atticus bribed. \"Don't tell me you just said shrimp and crab.\" Cherry looked at him. Atticus nodded to her. \"Oh, you are spoiling me...\" Cherry soon drooled. \"Maybe.\" Atticus smirked. They then sat down to eat their Chinese dinner and Cherry was the most happy since it was her favorite food. They saw something blinking red. \"Hm?\" Cherry wondered after swallowing. Patch came to check it out after he was given some of his own sweet and sour chicken. Cherry soon pushed it and a screen soon appeared. \"Uhh...\" she blinked out of confusion. \"This seems weirdly familiar..\" Patch pondered as it felt like he was in a spy movie. \"Cherry?\" Teresa asked from the screen. \"Terry?\" Cherry replied to her older sister as she came closer toward the screen. \"Are you video chatting with me?\" \"Is something wrong?\" Patch asked. \"This is more serious than we thought,\" Teresa told them. \"We need all the help we can get, even if it means Juni and Carmen's involvement.\" \"Is Bridget telling Phineas, Ferb, and Candace?\" Atticus asked. \"Yes, as a matter of fact, she is, this is about Fegan Floop.\" Teresa nodded. \"That weird guy with the TV Show?\" Cherry asked. \"Yep.\" Teresa nodded. \"Weird...\" Atticus commented. \"I know, it sounds strange, but the world needs your help.\" Teresa told the three of them, even Patch since he was no ordinary puppy dog. \"We won't let you down.\" Patch said. \"I trust that you won't, this is a matter of life and death.\" Teresa told them. \"Whoa, this must be really serious.\" Atticus said. \"Just from a weird guy with a TV Show?\" Cherry asked. \"Come on, Terry...\" \"Did I forget to mention that he's invented some robots that look just like children and he has someone who is just as strong as Atticus?\" Teresa asked. \"What?\" Cherry asked with wide eyes. \"He may be silly, but he has big plans for world domination,\" Teresa nodded sincerely. \"And this guy next to him had this look like his eyes were a blazing flame.\" The video soon seemed to static as there were people right behind Teresa. \"Oh, no, they've found me!\" Teresa panicked. \"Quick, run!\" Cherry told her. The screen seemed to static a lot as Teresa tried to tell information only to be cut out before it soon blacked out on the screen. \"Terry? TERRY!\" Cherry cried out. \"We better go to Phineas, Ferb, and Candace.\" Atticus said. \"Yes, this seems serious.\" Patch agreed. They rushed out of the hotel to get to where the Flynn-Fletchers were. A man came to the door with some bags to come see Carmen and Juni after being called which excited them. \"Uncle Felix!\" Felix was happy to see his nephews. \"Hey, churros, how are you?\" he smiled before teasing Juni. \"Last time I saw you, you were this big. You're shrinking. What's up? Here, take this bag.\" Juni and Carmen soon took his bag. Linda and Lawrence came to meet Felix and smiled to him as he seemed like a very nice guy and where he agreed to watch over the kids and teenagers and pets. \"Come on, I don't need a babysitter,\" Candace complained. \"I'm almost sixteen!\" \"Remember the last time we left you in charge, Candace?\" Linda asked. \"You've always put me in charge of Phineas and Ferb over the summer.\" Candace replied. \"I meant the one time when you had that party.\" Linda said. \"It wasn't my fault!\" Candace replied. \"Hola there, familia y amigos.\" Felix smiled to the company. \"Hi.\" Phineas greeted. \"Ah, hello there yourself, chico.\" Felix smiled. \"Oh, you speak Spanish,\" Phineas smiled back. \"My friend Isabella back home speaks Spanish.\" Ferb nodded in agreement. \"Well, it's nice to meet more and more little ninos.\" Felix smiled to Phineas and Ferb, liking them already. Atticus, Cherry, and Patch soon arrived next. \"Ah, what a nice little perro!\" Felix beamed as he then knelt down and pet Patch all around. 'Oh, I like this guy.' Patch thought to himself with chuckles. \"Thanks for coming on short notice, guy.\" Ingrid smiled to Felix. \"What is family for?\" Felix asked. \"Hey, where's Perry?\" Phineas looked around. Perry waddled outside as Gregorio appeared to be checking out his car which seemed like no ordinary car. 'Hmm... What is he up to?' the platypus thought to himself. Gregorio pushed a button on the car mirror and made sure he looked presentable. Perry looked around and soon stood up on his webbed feet and put on his fedora to keep a close eye on the Cortez couple. And where he soon saw he had company as Patch arrived next to him with his fedora hat on. \"Shh...\" Perry shushed. Patch nodded as they did some OWCA agent work and luckily now, their owners knew all about their work. Ingrid slid off her sunglasses with a joking smirk. \"Do I know you?\" Gregorio clicked the car keys which opened the door for him to let Ingrid step inside. 'Time to follow them.' Patch thought to himself. Gregorio and Ingrid got into the car together to go off on a secret spy mission unbeknownst to their children and not knowing they would be followed. Patch kept an ear out for any information. And he would inform Atticus about what he and Perry would find out. Patch and Perry nodded to each other as the agents were going for their secret mission. And they both soon teleported into the back of the vehicle. \"S-115 to Santa Cecilia,\" Ingrid pushed a button on the car as Gregorio drove. \"On assignment to Bond.\" 'Missing OSS operatives.' A computer voice replied before showing images of the missing agents while Patch and Perry took a close and quiet look. Patch soon took a few quick pictures. \"Agents Ingrid and Gregorio Cortez en route.\" Ingrid announced with a smile. A woman's image then appeared on the screen as she looked so thrilled. 'Well, it's good to hear those names again.' she told the two spies with glee. \"I have a bad feeling about her.\" Patch whispered. \"Good evening, Ms. Gradneko.\" Gregorio greeted the woman, though he kept his eyes on the road since he was driving. 'Hello, Greg~' The woman replied. \"Ahem!\" Ingrid cleared her throat. 'And Mrs. Cortez.' The woman quickly added. \"Was she trying to ignore Mrs. Cortez?\" Perry whispered in animal language. \"I think she's trying to seduce Mr. Cortez.\" Patch whispered back. \"Wow.\" Perry whispered. \"Updates?\" Ingrid requested. 'They're being loaded into your central now.' Gradneko replied. \"This is getting interesting.\" Patch thought to himself. Gregorio and Ingrid soon joined hands together as they drove into the sunset and drove into the ocean. Patch and Perry had wide eyes. 'Oh, my.' Patch thought to himself. Perry looked to where Gregorio was driving to and saw several lights flash on. Everyone flinched from the bright light as a way opened for the spy couple to drive inside. 'That's new.' Perry thought to himself. Meanwhile back at the Cortez house... Candace decided to gossip with Stacey while Phineas, Ferb, and Juni were drawing with colored pencils. Everything seemed to be peaceful at the house. Carmen decided to join the boys while the girls gossiped. Cherry and Atticus took a look over to the younger ones with Jeremy. \"And this is what Carmen would look like as a Foogly.\" Juni told Phineas and Ferb as he drew something. There appeared to be an alarm blaring on a clock which woke up Felix instantly from the couch. \" WILL YOU GUYS KEEP IT DOWN?! \"' Candace snapped. \" I AM TRYING TO TALK TO STACEY! \" \"What's going on?\" Phineas asked. \"Oh, my God...\" Felix muttered. \"Is this a fire drill?\" Juni asked out of confusion. \"I don't think so.\" Atticus said. \"Whatever it is, it's giving me a headache.\" Cherry groaned at the loud noise. Felix soon unlocked an emergency door and rushed to his niece and nephew with new clothes. \"Put these on, quickly,\" he told them urgently. \"We don't have any time to-\" The alarm seem to have turned itself off. \"Follow me!\" Felix then urged the others. \"What's going on?\" Jeremy felt confused. \"We better follow them.\" Atticus said. Cherry looked around. \"Patch? Perry?\" \"I'm sure they're okay.\" Atticus replied even if he was worried about his dog. \"Where could they be?\" Stacey asked. \"Come on, we gotta move, you guys too!\" Felix rushed them. \"We're coming.\" Atticus said. They then rushed to follow after Felix as he saw that it was time to share something very important with Juni and Carmen. \"There's a lot for you to know and very little time to explain.\" Felix said on the way as they passed the pool. \"Uncle Felix!\" Carmen called out. \"The first of which is, I'm not your uncle,\" Felix replied which had to be a big shock for the Cortez siblings after he ripped off his mustache to show it was a fake. \"Your parents are international spies. Good ones, but they've been mostly inactive for the last nine years.\" \"Because they had to look after Carmen and Juni, right?\" Atticus guessed. \"Yes, and I was assigned to protect the family,\" Felix replied as he came up to a shelf. \"But something's gone wrong. I have to take you to the safe house.\" \"My parents can't be spies!\" Carmen whined. \"They're not cool enough!\" Felix soon found what he was looking for. Once he did, turned the knob and the shelf opened up to show a secret entrance. \"That's cool.\" Juni commented. \"It sure is.\" Phineas smiled. Felix then walked them into the room as he checked out his device on the globe that showed a blinking red light to track down the kids' parents. \"According to the coordinates in my locating device, they're being taken to Asia or South America.\" \"That's sort of helpful.\" Cherry said. \"Go in there, I'll be right back.\" Felix told them before walking back out. \"And if you're not?!\" Carmen called out. \"Hit the blue button to seal the door and the green button to go.\" Felix replied. \"Okay.\" Candace said. \"You older kids are in charge!\" Felix said on his way out. \"Yes, sir!\" Atticus called back. Ferb opened one door to see a small closet that had jackets and boots inside. \"Is this a joke?\" Juni muttered. \"This is it?\" Stacey asked. Atticus cleaned the inside of his ear briefly before he heard glass breaking. \"Get in!\" Jeremy told them. Phineas, Ferb, and Juni checked out the closet. \"Cool.\" Phineas smiled. \"Carmen, look!\" Juni called out to his sister. \"You guys have got to see this.\" Phineas said. \"Phineas, Ferb, get out of there!\" Candace demanded. She soon saw the others going in. Cherry was even curious as she followed after the others. Carmen soon came in which made Candace have no choice even as Stacey and Jeremy went. \"Whoa, much more roomier.\" Atticus said. A screen came down to show what looked like Felix fighting against ninjas. \"Cool.\" Phineas smiled. \"You'll have to go to the safe house without me,\" Felix said in the screen after he socked a ninja in the face. \"Go now!\" \"Felix, look out!\" Atticus panicked as a ninja was coming right behind the man. Felix soon punched the ninja. \"Yeah! Yeah!\" Juni beamed. \"Find the OSS!\" Felix told the kids. \"Tell them the Third Brain lives! You must find-\" Another ninja then broke through the door as more came after him. \"What are those things?\" Carmen wondered as the ninjas didn't seem to be human. \"We better not ask and find out.\" Candace said before bringing in the bag. Stacey and Jeremy helped her. \"Okay, now to push the two buttons.\" Atticus said. \"Press the blue and green buttons.\" Carmen memorized before doing so and where they were soon sent out. \"We can't leave Felix behind!\" Juni pouted. \"Well, we are.\" Cherry said. \"Blue to close, green to go,\" Carmen quickly reminded her brother. \"Quick!\" Candace soon pushed the blue button and Atticus pushed the green button. The ninjas were soon coming after them after dealing with Felix. After the buttons were pushed, the door was sealed and they were soon zipping in the space into a new area for their own safety. \"Oh, yeah!\" Phineas cheered. \"I wonder where we're going?!\" Jeremy's eyes widened from the crazy ride so far. \"I hope it has WiFi!\" Stacey called out. \"Me too!\" Candace added in agreement with her best friend. They suddenly had life vests and they came out to see that they were on the lake, being chased by the ninjas on speedboats. \"Oh, sure, why not?!\" Cherry complained. \"What are those things?!\" Juni asked. \"I don't know, but they're catching up!\" Carmen yelped. \"We better dive down!\" Atticus told them. Juni tried to find the button. \"No, dont' touch anything!\" Carmen told him. Ferb soon pulled a lever down. They went flying over one fisherman's boat and splashed back into the water as the ninjas chased them. \"Juni? Juni?!\" Carmen yelped as she couldn't find her brother. Ferb tapped her on the shoulder and pointed down below to show her where her little brother was. \"How did he get there?!\" Carmen asked him. Ferb shrugged. \"Juni, what are you doing down there?!\" Carmen demanded. \"Help me!\" Juni cried out as he was stuck there. Atticus soon helped Juni get back up to them. Juni yelped and felt nervous on the way up. \"I gotcha, little buddy, I gotcha.\" Atticus comforted as he helped Juni back into place. As soon as he was back inside, they were then diving under the water. \"Good lever pulling, Ferb.\" Phineas said. Ferb gave a thumb's up to his step-brother in thanks. \"You're welcome.\" Phineas smiled. \"Wow!\" Carmen said as she looked at the ocean floor. \"We are definitely gonna be late for school.\" \"I'm not a big fan of that school.\" Cherry said. \"You think any school that has uniforms and strict rules is evil.\" Atticus replied. \"Do you not remember the Friendship Games?!\" Cherry reminded him. \"Fair point.\" Atticus said. Juni was slightly shaking as his sister looked around. \"Stop shaking.\" Carmen told him. \"We're safe now.\" Jeremy whispered. \"Stop shaking or you'll give yourself more warts.\" Carmen told Juni. 'More warts?' Ferb thought to himself. \"We're gonna be fine,\" Carmen told her little brother. \"Just be cool and do exactly as I say.\" Juni nodded, agreeing to do what Carmen said. The lights soon began to flicker on. 'Welcome to the N.I.X. Super Guppy.' A machine told them. \"Cool.\" Phineas smiled. \"Juni, don't touch anything,\" Carmen said as he was going to do just the opposite. \"JUNI!\" Juni soon stopped what he was doing. They were shown a window of the ocean floor on the outside and saw several fish swimming about. 'Destination: safe house,' The computer told them. 'Estimated time for arrival... Two hours, thirty minutes.' \"Alright then.\" Cherry said. \"Juni, close your eyes.\" Carmen said. \"Why?\" Juni asked. \"Just do it.\" Atticus said. Juni soon did what he was told to do for a change and the reason of why was because of a shark that was in front of them. Candace felt nervous about the sharks, but she tried her best to stay calm and quiet. The shark soon swam past them. Okay, you can open your eyes now.\" Atticus told Juni once the coast was clear. \"Thanks.\" Juni said. \"I just don't want you crying all over me.\" Carmen scoffed. \"Harsh.\" Candace said. \"Oh, like your little brothers don't annoy you.\" Carmen huffed. \"They might annoy me sometimes, but I'll always be there for them.\" Candace said. \"Little brother~...\" Stacey began to sing. Candace glanced at her best friend oddly for knowing that song, she thought that was just a dream, but she did remember when Phineas was born and when her mother met Lawrence when Ferb and Bridget were much younger. \"We're never gonna see them again, are we?\" Juni sighed about his parents. \"Of course you are.\" Atticus assured him. Carmen wasn't too sure about that herself, but she kept silent as she didn't want to worry her little brother any more. \"I just hope Suzy will be okay while I'm gone,\" Jeremy sighed about his own little sister. \"She's such a fragile little angel.\" Candace had mixed feelings about Suzy. \"Check it out, Ferb,\" Phineas smiled. \"This is cooler than anything we did over the summer!\" \"Yes, yes, it is.\" Ferb replied. \"Wow, that's the first thing he's ever said.\" Carmen said. \"Eh, he doesn't talk too much unless he's excited.\" Phineas replied. Ferb nodded to confirm that. The ride was taking a while and Carmen was beginning to fall asleep. Ferb decided to sit with Carmen for comfort and fell asleep against her. \"I'll take the first watch.\" Atticus said. \"You sure?\" Cherry asked. \"Get some sleep, Cherry,\" Atticus suggested. \"You look lightheaded.\" \"Okay, if you say so.\" Cherry said. Atticus patted her on the head and took watch as everyone looked sleepy and where he made sure that Juni didn't try anything. Juni was getting very bored as time seemed to go by slower and slower by the minute. \"Why not sleep?\" Atticus asked Juni. \"I'm not sleepy.\" Juni replied. \"But you are bored.\" Atticus said. \"But I'm not sleepy.\" Juni replied. \"I would sleep if I were bored,\" Atticus suggested. \"Being bored is not allowed. My little sister knew someone who once told her that.\" \"Who was it?\" Juni asked. \"Pretty sure it was her old nanny,\" Atticus smiled. \"Oh, the stories she would tell me about her old nanny and how much she missed her... They were so close with their little babysitting adventures.\" \"Nice.\" Juni said. \"Lovely woman...\" Atticus smiled. \"She did a great job raising Darla... Up until Hollywood.\" \"Your little sister lived in Hollywood?\" Juni asked in surprise. \"Yep.\" Atticus nodded. \"Did you guys live in Hollywood then?\" Juni asked. \"Oh, I should explain,\" Atticus remembered. \"Darla was adopted.\" \"Darla?\" Juni wrinkled his nose at the name. \"Not that girl who has all of those cute and fluffy movies with that stupidly adorable smile. She gives me a cavity just looking at her.\" \"She's much nicer.\" Atticus said. \"Ugh... That would drive me crazy...\" Juni grunted. \"Everything's so pink and cheerful!\" \"She's learning different things.\" Atticus said. \"Whatever, man...\" Juni rolled his eyes. \"I guess you didn't hear about the flooding of Stage 13.\" Atticus commented about Juni still thinking Darla was a 'pink princess movie star'. \"Huh?\" Juni asked. \"The flooding of Stage 13,\" Atticus told him. \"There was a press conference on Friday at 3:00 for LB Mammoth to debut the newest film: Li'l Ark Angel, but there was a flood that came from inside the stage.\" \"Whoa.\" Juni said. \"Darla flooded the stage.\" Atticus told him. \"No way!\" Juni replied. \"But... Her movies make her look like a perfect little goody two-shoes!\" \"Well, she wasn't.\" Atticus said. \"There's no way...\" Juni shook his head. \"Bottom line: She's my little sister now and I love her...\" Atticus replied. \"She's a great kid.\" The rest of the time was quiet. Juni soon got some popcorn and soon fell asleep after he ate. Atticus continued to stay up from his training as a guard from help from Shining Armor. He decided to do some work-outs that he learned from the unicorn stallion. He even did push-ups with one hand behind his back. Cherry soon woke up and she even saw that there was a small toilet that she could use and she could use it easily since no one was looking and she noticed that Atticus seemed stronger than he was before. 'How strong is this guy going to get?' She thought to herself. Atticus soon took a brief break as he looked out into the water, he just sighed and wanted to go out there and swim like he spent many summers in Atlantica with his favorite cousins, especially Ariel, but there wasn't anyway out without letting in water. He sighed as he was trapped inside. Cherry soon put the toilet away and crawled beside him. \"Tell me about Altantica.\" she asked him since he was thinking about it and he knew more about it due to his mother's connections. \"It's just amazing and musical.\" Atticus smiled. \"It seems magical,\" Cherry replied. \"What was your Aunt Athena like?\" \"She was nice, kind, caring, and had a lovely voice.\" Atticus said. \"It must be great to be a merperson.\" Cherry commented as they looked out into the water together. \"It sure is.\" Atticus said.[Chapter 5] Meanwhile with Ingrid, Gregorio, Perry, and Patch... Perry and Patch snuck after the Cortez couple and if anyone saw them, they pretended to be an ordinary platypus and dog. The two of them soon got picked up by one person who saw them. \"Clever doggy and clever... Beaver duck thing...\" The figure smirked at the OWCA agents. \"Sombra.\" Patch growled. The ninjas were taking Ingrid and Gregorio to a certain place as they passed the Floopies who were locked behind bars. Sombra brought both OWCA agents along. \"Characters from Floop's TV show,\" Ingrid noticed the captives with her husband. \"They're prisoners.\" \"As will you four be.\" Sombra smirked. \"A puppy dog and platypus?\" Gregorio looked at the captive animals, questionably. He soon saw their hats. \"Patch the Dalmatian and Perry the Platypus?!\" \"I believe these two belong with you folks.\" Sombra mocked the Cortez couple. Patch growled louder at him. \"Oh, you 'grr' all you want, no one can help you now.\" Sombra mocked. As they walked along, an eye seemed to be watching them. \"We need the Brain, Minion,\" Floop said. \"We're running out of time.\" \"Our ninjas searched the whole house.\" Minion said. \"Surely those agents have a weakness.\" Floop replied as he played with a plaster head. \"Luckily the agents have had children.\" Minion said. \"Hmm...\" Floop smirked at the mention of that. \"That means they each have two weaknesses.\" \"And those two pets I believe they have owners.\" Minion added. \"They have to have weaknesses as well, I'm sure Sombra can give us an advantage.\" Floop replied. Back with the others... The bathysphere soon stopped, allowing them to walk up stairs and go into the safe house that Felix told them about. \"Did you lock the bathysphere?\" Carmen asked Juni. \"Yep.\" Juni replied. \"Great.\" Atticus said. \"That's the safe house?\" Carmen scoffed at the sight. \"Looks more like an outhouse.\" Juni agreed. \"You said it.\" Atticus said. Ferb looked for a doorknob, only to see just a solid door with a window on top. 'Your name?' The door requested. \"Carmen Cortez?\" Carmen shrugged. 'Your full name, please.' The door replied. \"I don't use my full name,\" Carmen replied back. \"It's too long.\" 'Your full name, please.' The door repeated. \"Ferb, why don't you use your name?\" Phineas suggested. \"Ferb is just a nickname, it's short for-\" Ferb was about to say until Carmen then said her full name anyway to get it over with. \"Carmen Elizabeth Juanita Costa-Brava Cortez.\" Carmen told the door. \"Whoa, that is a long name.\" Cherry said. \"Told ya.\" Carmen replied as the door opened. They all then came into the room and once they were all inside, the door closed behind them. \"Wow.\" Atticus said. \"My name is a pass-code?\" Carmen muttered. When the door closed, lights opened up to show them inside of the safe house. \"Whoa.\" Phineas said. \"This place is amazing.\" Carmen looked astounded. \"Totally.\" Cherry nodded. Carmen opened the fridge, but then pouted. \"Empty,\" she then tried to open a cupboard, but it was also empty. \"How safe is a safe house if there's nothing to eat?\" \"There must be some food here.\" Candace said. Atticus looked around innocently and used some magic without anyone noticing. Carmen thought she heard something in the cupboard and opened it up again only to see it was full of food. \"Wow.\" Stacey said. Cherry checked the fridge was full as well and she soon shot a glance to Atticus as she felt sure that he had something to do with it. Atticus was simply seen doing sit-ups. Juni came over to what looked like a robot toy and read the label on it. \"'Machete's Buddy Pack'?\" he then pulled down the tarp next to the robot toy and saw others lined up. \"Nice.\" Jeremy said. \"Emergency Cash?\" Cherry asked before pushing a button to show a drawer filled with several dollars from all around the world for international missions. \"CHA-CHING!\" she beamed before collecting the money with a smirk. She soon saw the look Atticus was giving her while he was working out. \"What? I might need it!\" \"Alright.\" Atticus sighed as he was now doing push-ups in a hand stand. Cherry smirked as she collected the currency. \"What're these?\" Stacey checked out the colorful packets that were in the cupboards. \"I think they're food packets.\" Jeremy said. \"What do you do with them?\" Stacey asked. \"Here, let me see those.\" Jeremy replied as he took one and put it into what looked like a microwave, but it was a rehydrator and it turned the food packet into a cheeseburger. \"Ooh.\" Cherry said. \"There's even a large fry.\" Candace noticed that the burger was not just any other burger, it was a Big Mac from McDonald's. \"Where's the McNuggets packet?\" Cherry looked around hopefully. \"I don't see any.\" Stacey said. Juni was just worried about maybe never seeing his parents again. Carmen soon came over to Juni with food. \"Check it out~...\" she then waved the McDonald's in front of her brother to make him snap out of his reverie. \"'Thank you, Carmen'!\" Juni did not answer, he was staring at a framed picture which was of their parents on their wedding day. Carmen looked at where he was looking. \"We'll see them again,\" she tried to comfort her little brother. \"Just like they said.\" \"So this time, we're supposed to believe them?\" Juni sulked. Candace frowned, she almost felt the same way about when her father left the family when she and Phineas were younger before their mother met Lawrence. Carmen soon let the picture frame be faced on the table. \"You okay, Candace?\" Stacey asked her best friend. \"Yeah... I was just thinking... About my dad...\" Candace said quietly, referring to her biological father and not her step-father. \"Oh...\" Stacey said, understanding. Candace sighed. \"I still remember when Mom asked him to leave... He told me he was going away for a while... I was a little kid back then.\" \"I know you told me.\" Stacie said. Candace sighed as she thought about her biological father. \"Didn't he love me?\" \"Candace, it's not your fault, he did it himself, it's not your fault, it's not Phineas's or your mom's fault, it's no one's fault.\" Stacey comforted her best friend. She was very right about this. \"She's right, Candace, it'll be okay...\" Jeremy patted Candace on the back. \"Besides, I don't want my girlfriend sad.\" he then said, knowing that her being his girlfriend would brighten her day. Cherry was happy that Jeremy and Stacey were there for Candace. \"Cherry, I found the nuggets!\" Atticus called out. \"Cool, I want 50!\" Cherry beamed. \"Of course.\" Atticus smiled. Cherry licked her lips hungrily as she was almost always hungry for Chicken McNuggets. Atticus was happy that Cherry was happy. Meanwhile... \"Let's stop worrying about the children.\" Ingrid told her husband. Patch and Perry began to try to escape. \"Please tell me you have a plan.\" Patch begged the platypus quietly. \"Try to use your strength.\" Perry whispered. Patch nodded and soon grunted as he tried to use his strength to snap the ropes to free them since he and Perry were tied up and he was successful in doing that. \"Ah... That feels good...\" he then stretched all of his legs. Perry soon jumped down with Patch as they were free. Patch soon went to the Cortez couple. \"You two escaped!\" Gregorio gasped. \"You truly are Patch and Perry.\" Patch nodded. Perry and Patch soon began to try to free Ingrid and Gregorio from their ropes. And where Gregorio explained about the Third Brain. 'Third Brain?' Patch thought to himself curiously. \"What's the Third Brain?\" Perry asked in animal language. Patch shrugged as he didn;t know as he freed the spy couple. Gregorio soon explained what the third brain was. \"I think I heard Atticus's dad say something about that.\" Patch said to Perry. \"Ooh.\" Perry smiled. Patch then chomped at the ropes to free the spy couple. \"Thanks.\" Ingrid said. \"Muchos gracias.\" Gregorio added. Patch and Perry then saluted the spy couple. They soon started to make their way out. \"I almost had to use my ring.\" Gregorio said on the way out. \"Your wedding ring?\" Patch asked. Gregorio turned the ring slightly to show it had a laser feature. \"Wow...\" Patch looked amazed. \"I know.\" Ingrid said. They then began to walk along to find a way out. \"Remember when we could sense danger a mile away?\" Ingrid asked her husband on the way. The floor soon cracked and separated Ingrid and Perry from Gregorio and Patch as the crackles looked like falling puzzle pieces. \"Those were the days.\" Gregorio sighed to his wife. \"Whoa.\" Patch said. Perry chattered his teeth, but it was out of nervousness and fear. Gregorio decided to step back and run to his beloved, but when he jumped, more and more of the floor broke up and where he didn't fall. He seemed to fall flat against a glass surface. \"Huh?\" Patch asked before coming closer and tapping the surface only to hear a clanking noise. \"It was a fluke!\" \"Clever.\" Gregorio muffled. Patch decided to help Gregorio up to his feet. \"That was quite a trick.\" Patch said. Gregorio began to jump on the glass only to see it wasn't breaking. \"Okay, come on!\" Ingrid rushed him over, not wanting him to jinx himself or get seven years of bad luck. They soon began to continue down the hall. Perry and Patch came up to a hallway that had arrows pointing to a room. \"Virtual Room?\" They both wondered. \"I wonder what that is like.\" Patch said. \"Let's go.\" Gregorio suggested. \"Agreed.\" Patch said. It was a tunnel at first, but there was a doorknob and they opened it and came through to check out the Virtual Room. When they came in, they appeared to see a tropical paradise with a sunset in the distant horizon. \"This is new.\" Patch said. They decided to turn back, but when they turned around, the door melted away and they seemed to be in a thunder storm climate. \"Oh, great...\" Patch groaned. This all felt very confusing. \"I regret coming in here!\" Perry cried out. \"Which way now?\" Patch asked. They all shrugged and began to walk through the speeding dust clouds. \"I wonder how big this room is?\" Patch wondered. \"It's bigger than Candace's closet.\" Perry whispered back. They all soon fell down a trapdoor. \" I KNEW IT! \" Patch yelled out on the way down.[Chapter 6] They fell through the door and ended up going through a tube and were shot out onto a dining room table and Bridget and Teresa were wearing sultry outfits while chained beside Floop against their wills. \"About time.\" Sombra smirked as he stood by Floop. \"Sombra!\" Patch glared. \"Fifteen minutes to escape,\" Floop timed the spy couple with animal OWCA agents. \"With your reputations I was expecting something a little more impressive.\" \"Finally, we can eat.\" Sombra said. There appeared to be nothing to eat but junk food. \"Wow.\" Patch said. Perry seemed sick to his stomach just looking at the spread. \"So, you are Floop.\" Gregorio recognized the beloved TV Show host for kids. \"Ah, you watch my show.\" Floop said. \"No, my son does.\" Gregorio replied as Ingrid took a spoonful of gooey green stuff. \"But not your daughter, Carmen.\" Sombra smirked. Gregorio and Ingrid looked nervous. \"And Juni?\" Floop added with a smirk before he sipped his sweet syrup. \"And there are also Phineas and Ferb,\" Sombra smirked. \"Linda and Lawrence's boys.\" Bridget gasped at the mention of her younger brothers. \"Now, we don't know where they are, but we did get something from your house.\" Sombra smirked at the Cortez couple. Gregorio looked like he wanted to beat both of them as he stood up sharply from his seat. Sombra soon firmly set Gregorio back down on his seat. \"Careful!\" Floop smirked before snapping his fingers to summon a Thumb-Thumb. \"I snap my fingers and my fingers snap you.\" \"Now, stay seated.\" Sombra said. Gregorio soon forced himself to sit down. \"Where are the OSS agents you've taken and why are those girls chained up?\" Ingrid demanded. \"Wouldn't you like to know?\" Sombra smirked. \"Shall I?\" Floop smirked back to Sombra. \"Oh, yes.\" Sombra smirked. Floop nodded as he then talked to the couple with the dog and platypus. \"Twelve years ago, they were part of a research team for the OSS, attempting to create a synthetic intelligence, a compendium of spy knowledge, if you will. Research since destroyed.\" He then began as he circled his hostages. \"Or was it?\" Sombra smirked. \"If the OSS destroyed its research, it was for a reason.\" Ingrid spoke up gently. \"That's right,\" Sombra smirked. \"Unless someone didn't destroy it.\" \"We all have our reasons, hmm?\" Floop continued. \"There was someone else on that research team, hmm? Someone else who could rebuild it. Isn't that right, Mr. Corteth?\" Sombra smirked as he enjoyed this. Gregorio soon gulped which made his wife look nervous. \"Now, shall we show them?\" Sombra smirked at Floop. \"Let's do it.\" Floop agreed as he summoned a screen and where it showed Felix. He smirked as he showed a clay head he made like Felix's before smushing it in his hands before showing it again as a new character. \"Push the button.\" Sombra told Floop. Floop nodded and did just that which shocked Felix electrically and transformed him into the new character's shape. \"Ooh, nice.\" Sombra smirked. \"I think he's gonna be a best-seller,\" Floop smirked. \"And just in time for the holiday rush.\" \"Couldn't agree more.\" Sombra smirked. \"I will never, ever build anything for you.\" Gregorio glared at Floop. \"Too bad.\" Sombra smirked. \"Thank you for joining us.\" Floop said before pushing another button which was a trapdoor for him. \"NOOOO!\" Bridget and Teresa cried out. \"Bye-Bye.\" Sombra smirked. Bridget and Teresa gaped at the trapdoor before glaring. Sombra wasn't effected by that at all. \"Ah, ah, ah, remember our deal, ladies~\" Foop smirked. \"You do what me and Sombra ask of you and your precious cousin and sister will be spared.\" This was true. Bridget and Teresa soon settled themselves down. \"Now, Bridget, how's about you give me a massage?\" Floop smirked. Bridget sighed as she walked over behind his back and rubbed his shoulders. \"Teresa, my muscles need some massaging.\" Sombra smirked. Teresa sighed as she went to do the same to him against her will. \"This is the life.\" Sombra smirked. \"You said it, it's the best time I've had.\" Floop agreed with his new partner. 'His usefulness will end soon.' Sombra thought to himself. Back with the others... Carmen came to one of the bags that Felix gave her and the others and pulled out a black latex suit. \"Ooh.\" Phineas smiled. \"Kind of reminds me of an older woman I once knew...\" Ferb commented. \"Vanessa...\" \"Ooh.\" Carmen smiled. \"It looks fabulous on you though.\" Ferb said to Carmen. \"You should talk more often,\" Carmen suggested. \"I think you have a lovely voice.\" \"Uh, thanks.\" Ferb said. Carmen then tried on the suit and moved around in it to get comfortable and took out all the gadgets. \"Too bad Inspector Gadget's not here, who'd need to carry all that stuff?\" Cherry tried to joke. Stacey soon giggled. \"You guys know Inspector Gadget?\" Juni asked Cherry and Atticus. \"Yep.\" Atticus said. \"Whoa...\" Juni couldn't believe that. \"Not to mention Penny and Brain.\" Cherry remembered. \"Whoa.\" Juni said as his mind was blown. \"'How to be a Spy',\" Candace picked up a book. \"Author unknown.\" \"That's interesting.\" Atticus said. Carmen and Juni soon looked ready for spy fighting once they were suited up. \"Alright, let's get going.\" Atticus said. \"'A good spy uses'-\" Candace began from the book. \" TESTING! \" Juni's voice boomed as he tried out a communicator. Carmen soon winced from the feedback. \"Ow...\" Cherry groaned from that herself since she had sensitive ears. \"Ow, gosh, you're too close!\" Carmen glared at Juni. \"Way too close!\" Cherry added. \"'A good spy uses his head',\" Carmen glared at her brother. \"Got that? It's the first one in the book!\" \"Even Phineas and Ferb can do that.\" Cadance said. \"Ew, gross!\" Juni said after he put on sunglasses. \"What do you see?\" Carmen asked. \"You.\" Juni smirked. \"Not funny.\" Cherry said. Atticus took the glasses and adjusted them since they could see other things than normal vision. \"There we go.\" He said. \"Whoa! Maps and readouts!\" Juni beamed as he looked. \"Nice.\" Phineas smiled. \"Tell me something I don't know.\" Cherry murmured. 'What do we do now?' Stacey thought to herself. Carmen opened up an album and saw wedding pictures which reminded her of a story once told to her and Juni when they were younger. \"A wedding album?\" Candace guessed as she took a look. \"The wedding from the story,\" Carmen replied. \"It was theirs...\" \"Looks like everyone they knew was there.\" Jeremy said. Carmen took out one photograph and folded it up and put it in her pocket for later. \"They should've told us about this stuff.\" Juni pouted. \"How?\" Atticus asked. \"What about Diego and Ronaldo and all you're make believe friends?\" Carmen asked Juni. \"Should Mom and Dad know about that?\" \"She has a point.\" Cherry said. \"What about all the days you skip school?\" Juni retorted to Carmen. \"Want them to know about that?\" \"That's my business!\" Carmen huffed. Juni soon accidentally handcuffed himself. \"Really?\" Cherry asked him, unimpressed. \"I don't have a key.\" Carmen shrugged. \"Go knock it against something like Atticus's big fat head.\" Cherry suggested. \"Ha ha, very funny.\" Atticus groaned. \"'A good spy has no fear'.\" Jeremy read. \"That maybe a problem for some of us.\" Candace said. \"Except me,\" Cherry smirked. \"I'm not scared of anyone or anything.\" \"What about Drell?\" Atticus whispered. \"Pssh... He wishes I was scared of him...\" Cherry folded her arms. \"I could take him on with my eyes closed if I wanted to.\" \"Oh, hi, Drell.\" Atticus smirked as he looked behind Cherry. \"I'm not falling for that one again.\" Cherry looked through the book. \"Hi, Cherry.\" Drell's voice smirked. Cherry soon screamed and fell right through her chair. Drell cupped his mouth as he tried not to laugh. \"You were saying?\" Atticus smirked. Cherry groaned and yelled out as Drell gave her an idea. \"WHY DONT YOU USE YOUR STUPID MAGIC TO GET CARMEN AND JUNI'S PARENTS BACK?!\" \"Sorry, but I can't do that.\" Drell said. \"What do you mean you can't do that?\" Cherry glared in annoyance. Drell soon whispered to her why. \"Jerk.\" Cherry grumbled. \"Yeah, yeah,\" Drell smirked. \"So, uh, how's it going?\" he then asked Atticus. \"Pretty good, no ninjas have found us yet.\" Atticus said. \"Well, that's good, trust me, it wasn't easy for me to come here either,\" Drell replied. \"Magic has a strong sense to non-magical beings... Unless of course you're the Te Xuan Ze.\" \"You keep saying that phrase,\" Cherry replied. \"When do we get to meet whatever that is?\" \"I'm afraid you are to meet a descendant of the current one,\" Drell said. \"The powers usually skip down to the child after the current one, but I'm afraid that Jasmine Lee's ability has skipped her son Michael's, so one of his kids will have to be the next Te Xuan Ze.\" \"Okay.\" Atticus said. The others soon noticed Drell. \"Hi, I'm-\" Drell was about to say. \"My uncle,\" Atticus suddenly said, not revealing the truth since it was illegal in the magical realm. \"My uncle, Drell... Who's an undercover agent.\" \"That's right.\" Drell smiled. \"Oh...\" Carmen and Juni replied. \"Hey, hey, why are your hands so big?\" Juni asked. \"I work out...\" Drell glared. \"Why is your hair so long?\" Juni asked. \"Because I like it this way.\" Drell replied, getting annoyed. \"Why are you so freakishly huge?\" Juni asked. \"I dunno, why are you so freakishly annoying?\" Drell asked back in irritation. \"Wow.\" Cherry said as this seemed familiar. Atticus couldn't help but chuckle as it was kind of funny. \"'A good spy puts himself... Herself in the mind-set of the opponent',\" Candace continued to read. \"Uh, what does that mean?\" Cherry was about to say, but looked to Atticus as she actually didn't know. \"What does that mean?\" She asked. \"Basically, to get to know your enemy, you must become your enemy, think like them, wear their clothes, that sort of thing.\" Atticus then told her what it meant. \"Ohh.\" Cherry said. Atticus nodded to her as he checked out some more spy gear. \"I guess this is up to all of us,\" Carmen replied before looking to Juni. \"You with me?\" \"With you what?\" Juni asked. \"Find the OSS like Felix said.\" Carmen explained. \"Okay.\" Juni shrugged. \"Good, let's go.\" Carmen said. There was then a knocking at the door. \"Did you bring Hilda and Zelda with you?\" Atticus whispered to Drell sharply. \"Mm-mm.\" Drell shook his head. \"Then who's that knocking at the door?\" Atticus whispered Drell shrugged as he didn't know. \"I hope it's not my parents.\" Carmen came up to a sealed up hatch to look out the door to see a familiar-looking beautiful woman at the door. \"Hi, I'm Ms. Gradenko!\" The woman beamed. \"We work for your parents.\" \"You know my parents?\" Carmen asked. \"I can understand if you don't trust me,\" Gradneko replied as Juni looked out the window to see a strange man he didn't know. \"You were a baby when we first met.\" The door soon opened up to let the woman in as she was in with body agents. \"Remember me now?\" Gradneko smiled as she came out to see the Cortez siblings who just look confused. Carmen simply shook her head. \"Who are you and how did you get in?\" Cherry demanded. \"Yeah, how?\" Candace asked. \"Sorry, I have a key, you see?\" Gradneko replied as she came in. \"We're all on the same side, we're here to protect you.\" \"My mom has a bracelet like that.\" Carmen pointed out. \"OSS standard issue,\" Gradneko explained. \"We all have one.\" \"Wow.\" Atticus said. \"OSS?\" Carmen asked. \"You work with my parents?\" \"Yes...\" Gradneko replied. \"Now, please listen closely. Open your ears...\" Ferb randomly took out a notepad as this seemed important. \"Your father was able to send one last communique this morning before he disappeared,\" Gradneko continued. \"It consisted of five letters,\" she then showed them a paper with a strange name on it. \"F-L-O-O-P!\" This caused for Juni, Phineas, and Ferb to go wide-eyed. Juni took out his Fegan Floop action figure as he looked with Phineas and Ferb. \"Oh, thanks, dude.\" Drell reached for a turkey meal that one man used the rehydrator with. \"Hey!\" The man glared. \"Hey, yourself.\" Drell scoffed. \"But you're wrong,\" Phineas told Gradneko. \"Fabulous Floop would never do that.\" Ferb and Juni of course agreed. 'This must be hard for them.' Drell thought to himself. \"Oh, trust me, he's not that fabulous,\" Gradneko told the young boys. \"In fact... Recognize these?\" she then took out a remote and clicked it on to show characters from the TV Show that they liked. \"His Fooglies.\" Phineas said. \"I've got toy versions.\" Juni pouted. \"This is what they looked like before he mutated him.\" Gradneko told the boys as she showed images of the missing agents that Gregorio and Ingrid had to go looking for. \"He did that?\" Phineas frowned. \"I'm afraid so,\" Gradneko confirmed. \"We're dealing with a genius.\" \"Told you Floop was a freak.\" Carmen muttered to her heartbroken little brother. \"Now is not the time for that.\" Candace whispered to her. \"And that cute little tuneless song the characters sing?\" Gradneko continued. \"Play it backwards...\" The TV soon showed the theme song which revealed a secret message. 'We're trapped! Floop is a madman! Help us, save us, Floop is a madman! Help us, save us!' \"Whoa.\" Atticus said. \"Playing a song backwards always has a hidden message...\" Cherry commented. \"But now, I'm disturbed.\" \"A cry for help.\" Gradneko nodded to her. \"Will Floop do that to Mr. and Mrs. Cortez?\" Jeremy asked. \"Definitely,\" Gradneko replied as she turned off the TV. \"Unless... He gets something that Mr. Cortez helped develop,\" she then looked to the siblings. \"If there's anything you can possibly remember-\" \"I don't trust her.\" Drell whispered. \"Drell, I have a funny feeling in my stomach.\" Cherry turned back to him. \"Nervous?\" Drell asked. Cherry nodded as she felt the same way about Gradneko. \"We better check outside.\" Drell whispered to her. \"We, as in both of us alone?\" Cherry's eyes widened. \"Don't worry, I won't do anything to you.\" Drell whispered. Cherry gulped, but she then followed him out where they could talk in private.[Chapter 7] Carmen soon told Gradneko what Felix said. \"The Third Brain lives.\" \"What?\" Gradneko asked. \"Uh, Felix gave us a message to deliver to the OSS, and here you are.\" Carmen explained. \"Here we are.\" Gradneko smiled. \"What's the message?\" \"The Third Brain lives.\" Carmen informed. This made Gradneko smile even more. Cherry and Drell sat outside the safe house to talk. \"I'm sure that Gradneko is a fraud...\" Drell replied. \"Since we're alone, we might as well use some magic.\" \"Yeah, but with me?\" Cherry asked. \"Usually you do this with Atticus.\" \"I wanted to switch it up.\" Drell said before seeing what was happening to the bathysphere. Cherry shrugged and soon looked to the bathysphere in concern and saw that it was sinking. \"Drell, the bathysphere is sinking!\" she panicked. \"Make it stop!\" \"I can't, my magic isn't good with things like that,\" Drell said. \"And I think we just caught those guys's attention.\" The men looked over to Cherry and Drell and came toward them. \"Back inside!\" Cherry yelped. \"You go on ahead.\" Drell told her for her own safety. Cherry soon got up and rushed back inside the safe house as the men came toward them, looking like they could hurt them. Once inside, Cherry saw something coming up the table. \"Cherry, I just joined the female spies of the OSS!\" Carmen beamed once she saw the perky goth. \"Oh, um, that's good.\" Cherry said. \"Are you okay, Cherry?\" Phineas asked. \"You look worried about something.\" \"You might wanna look outside.\" Cherry gulped. \"Not now, Carmen, tell me where does the Third Brain live?\" Gradneko asked. \"Did Felix tell you that?\" \"I don't think he said.\" Carmen shrugged. \"No, he didn't.\" Atticus said. \"He didn't say?\" Gradneko replied. \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes.\" Atticus said. \"Search the place,\" Gradneko told the men who were in the house with her. \"It wasn't in the house, it must be here.\" \"You were at our house?\" Carmen asked. Gradneko smiled innocently to this. Juni and Phineas both soon looked outside of what was going on. They saw the ninjas from earlier and Drell looked like he was getting his butt kicked. \"Oh, my...\" Phineas gulped. The man and ninja soon turned to see that they were being spied on. \"Oh, no!\" Juni frowned. \"Oh, my God,\" Gradneko said before turning to see what she was looking for as she slid on a glove. \"It exists...\" \"That's what Floop wants?\" Candace asked, unimpressed. \"It's not very big.\" Stacie said as Atticus grabbed the device. \"Oh, it's so beautiful!\" Gradneko reached for the Third Brain. \"You're working for Floop!\" Cherry realized. Atticus soon grabbed the Third Brain from Gradneko with a smirk. \"Please, give that to me right now.\" Gradneko demanded. \"No way, Faker.\" Atticus smirked. \"Don't move or I'll use this... Thing!\" Cherry glared as she held out a weapon, but she didn't know what it was or what it could do. This just made Gradneko and her men laugh at her. \"You don't even know what that thing is.\" Gradneko taunted. Cherry soon felt how heavy it was. \"I know it's heavy.\" She then smirked. She then grunted slightly as she wasn't strong physically but soon threw it and it exploded. Carmen and the rest of the gang soon joined in the fun. \"Hey, that equipment costs millions of dollars!\" Gradneko told them. \"Too bad, so sad.\" Candace smirked. Some men tackled Atticus like a football player who had the ball and took the Third Brain from him. \"Get off of me !\" Atticus muffled until he threw them off of him and where they were all sent flying. \"Phew!\" Atticus wiped his forehead. \"Great move, Cherry...\" he then checked his pockets. \"Oh, no, wait!\" One of the men smirked as he now had the Third Brain. \"Stop, that's supposed to protect Mr. and Mrs. Cortez!\" Atticus glared as he charged toward the man. \"Ha! You'll have catch me first.\" The man smirked as he put one of the rocket packs on his back. Attius was going to go after them, but Carmen stood up over the table and jumped up while running and lunged out, passing the ceiling fan as the man who was going to stop her cut his hands on the blades and yelled out of pain. \"That had to hurt.\" Stacey smirked. Carmen rolled onto the floor and stood back up with a glare as the bad guys were getting away with their jet packs. \"We gotta go after them.\" Atticus said. \"Send in the thumbs.\" Gradneko told a communicator she had. The windows were soon being shattered open by the ninjas. \"The ninjas!\" Stacey panicked. Carmen soon put on a pack, but she flew backwards since she didn't know how to use it. \"Oh, bring it on, I'm not afraid of you guys!\" Atticus glared. Drell soon came to the door and fell forward as he looked like he had been badly battered. \"I never should have left my strength with Skippy for a day.\" The warlock groaned in defeat. \"What?!\" Cherry asked before laughing slightly. \"It was a bet.\" Drell groaned. Cherry then nervously helped him up. Drell tried to stand, but he looked very weak and pathetic for once. Gradneko soon walked up to him and pushed him back down just to make fun of him. \"Leave him alone!\" Cherry glared before looking surprised. \"Whoa, I never imagined saying that.\" \"What're you gonna do about it?\" Gradneko mocked Cherry. \"You're just a scrawny little girl with a big mouth.\" Hearing this caused Atticus to get angry. \"I could fight you if I wanted to.\" Cherry glared. \"Oh, yeah? Try.\" Gradneko taunted her. \" WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?! \" Cherry pointed afar. Gradneko turned the other way and Cherry was about to punch her until the older woman grabbed her fist and roughly turned her arm around her back in a painful way and grabbed her into a rough headlock. She soon smirked as she saw her best friend angry with Gradneko. \"You know, my father always told me to never hit a lady,\" Atticus glared at Gradneko. \"But for you, I'll make an exception.\" \"Okay then.\" Gradneko smirked as she then threw Cherry off onto the floor. \"Kick her butt, Atticus.\" Cherry said. Atticus nodded as he went to do that to avenge her. He soon tackled the evil woman, not caring if he hurt her. Gradneko yelled out. The ninjas soon came over to Atticus to try to beat him before they could escape back to Floop and Sombra. Unfortunately for them, he was like a steel wall. \"Go, Atticus, make me proud!\" Drell coached before wincing in agony. \"Ugh... My shoulder is killing me.\" Jeremy soon helped Drell up to his feet. \"Thanks, young man...\" Drell smiled down to the boy. \"Wow, how'd you get so tall?\" Jeremy asked as Drell seemed to be over six feet. \"I drink a lot of milk.\" Drell smirked innocently. \"Yuck.\" Cherry muttered as she hated milk. \"And lots of eggs.\" Drell said. \"Don't tell me, when you were a kid, you ate four dozen eggs each day.\" Cherry joked while Atticus took care of the ninjas while Gradneko used this as the chance to get away with the Third Brain. Unfortunately for Gradneko, she didn't count on Phineas taking the Third Brain from her. \"Bring her back!\" Gradneko demanded about Carmen. Ferb narrowed his eyes and began to fight against the woman as an attempt to protect Carmen. Phineas soon hid the Third Brain in his pocket. Juni soon tried to get the bag. \"Ah, ah, ah,\" Gradneko smirked. \"Don't you wanna see your parents, you little brat?!\" Ferb soon jumped onto her back and smacked her face against the table to knock her out. \"Ooh!\" Cherry and Atticus winced at that. \"Thanks, Ferb.\" Juni smiled. Ferb gave a thumb's up in response. There was one more Buddy Pack left and they all had to get going before Gradneko would realize she no longer had the Third Brain. \"What do we do?\" Cherry asked. \"Come on, you can fly with me.\" Atticus offered. \"Fly with you?!\" Cherry asked. \"Uh-uh, I am not-\" Gradneko was heard groaning as she was about to wake up. Atticus looked to Gradneko and soon punched her back to sleep. \"ATTICUS!\" Cherry's eyes widened. \"Would you rather stay here and wait for her to wake up?\" Atticus asked. Cherry groaned as she knew she wouldn't like this, but was soon on Atticus's back as he flew like Superman. Phineas and Ferb soon brought jet packs of their own. \"Did you guys invent those?\" Candace asked her brothers. \"Yep.\" Phineas said. \"Who knew that bacon grease would be such a good energy source for homemade jet packs?\" Ferb added. \"Nice.\" Atticus said. They all soon flew out of the safe house so they could save Perry, Patch, Gregorio and Ingrid. They then ended up in a city and there was a traveling tram that was now parked. \"Let's land.\" Phineas said. They all then landed. Cherry's hair was frizzed up and wild as she got off of Atticus's back. \"You look like Meg when she first rode on Pegasus.\" Atticus snickered. \"Gee, thanks.\" Cherry glared out of sarcasm. Drell spit into his hands and ruffled at Cherry's hair to flatten and straighten it out. \"Gross, I've got your germs!\" Cherry groaned. \"Oh, whatever.\" Drell rolled his eyes. \"Ew, ew, ew, ew...\" Cherry winced each time he touched her. \"It's so gross... Oh, my God, yuck... Oh, ew...\" Drell soon finished and wiped his hands against his pants. \"Now, onward!\" he exclaimed. \"Yes!\" Cherry gasped. They snuck onto the tram to blend in with the citizens as the men and thumb ninjas were looking all over for them. The ninjas from before began to try to look for them. Luckily, they were able to escape without being seen as the tram drove down the road. \"Easy.\" Drell said. \"So, you gave Skippy your strength?\" Atticus asked the warlock. \"Just for one day.\" Drell said. \"Oh, good, you'll have it back soon.\" Atticus smiled in relief. \"Yep.\" Drell said. Meanwhile... Floop was singing a twisted song about torturing little children as he held Bridget and Teresa hostage. \"You are disturbed.\" Bridget said. \"And I thought you were clever in espionage and sleuthing.\" Floop mocked her since she was in his grasp. \"You are a terrible man.\" Teresa glared. \"Thank you.\" Floop smirked to her. \"You are becoming heartless.\" Bridget said. \"Oh, why can't you be obedient like my Fooglies?\" Floop sneered at the girls. \"Maybe because unlike them; we have family members we care for and love.\" Teresa glared. \"Yeah? Well...\" Floop glared back before blowing a raspberry like an immature child. \"Wow...\" Teresa deadpanned in a way that could rival her little sister's snarkiness. \"That was immature.\" Bridget said. Floop soon began to preform his twisted song, but it didn't go well either. Teresa and Bridget just smirked as Floop was not getting exactly what he wanted. And where he shouted out cut to stop the show. The Fooglies were dangling then as Floop stormed off. \"Lock them up!\" Bridget and Teresa had stoic frowns as they were forced to sit where they were. Floop soon made his way to Sombra and Minion. \"What does it need, Minion?\" Floop asked. \"...I don't-\" Minion sounded nervous. \"MY SHOW!\" Floop told him. \"It needs something, that thing that will take to make it #1. I can feel it, but I can't think straight enough to figure it out!\" \"You have to focus on the project right now.\" Sombra said. \"Syndication?\" Floop replied. Sombra face-palmed. \"N-No, sir,\" Minion spoke up. \"He means the army of robot children, sir.\" \"Exactly.\" Sombra said. \"This hardware gets in the way of my creative abilities,\" Floop grumbled before he gave Minion a stern look as he slid off his glove. \"You lost the children...\" \"Not only that, but they got away with the Third Brain.\" Sombra said. \"It exists?\" Floop muttered out of shock. \"Yes.\" Sombra nodded. \"Completely,\" Minion added. \"Cortez lied to us.\" \"Send out our best Thumbs.\" Floop commanded him. \"They were beaten.\" Sombra said. \"Sir, if you want to catch a criminal, you send a criminal,\" Minion began to advise. \"If you want to snare a spy-\" \"Please speak English, Minion, I've been baking under those studio lights!\" Floop snapped out of impatience. \"If you want to find a child, you send a child.\" Minion soon concluded as he showed robot children. \"What do you think?\" Sombra smirked at Floop. \"That is brilliant, Minion.\" Floop replied. \"Thank you, sir.\" Minion smiled proudly.[Chapter 8] Meanwhile with Atticus and the others... \"Where are we now?\" Jeremy wondered. \"San Diablo.\" Drell replied. \"Nice.\" Stacey said. There were kids on a playground doing all sorts of activities such as Chess, sliding down a slide, and even zip-lining. \"Ooh.\" Phineas smiled. \"Some locating device,\" Carmen scoffed as she threw down one device she was using. \"I can't even figure out where the coordinates point to! Who makes this?\" she then looked at the back. \"'Machete Products'.\" \"That's a unique name.\" Atticus said. \"Says Atticus.\" Cherry teased. \"Touche.\" Atticus said. Carmen soon took out the photograph she borrowed from the album and looked on the back of it and it said 'Machete and Hombre'. Juni was playing with the Third Brain a little and was about to smash it onto the blacktop. Cherry soon stopped him and took the Third Brain from him, knowing what he was thinking. \"What are you doing?!\" she scolded the young boy. \"That's your bargaining chip on getting your parents back!\" \"This is what Floop wants,\" Juni said to her. \"I think my mom and dad would want this destroyed.\" \"Don't you think Floop would do something terrible to your parents if the Third Brain would be destroyed?!\" Cherry glared. \"What do you know?\" Juni huffed at her as he held the brain while Cherry latched onto his wrist to keep him from throwing it down. \"You're not destroying it.\" Cherry said. \"But Carmen gets to keep her bracelet,\" Juni pointed out. \"That could be a tracer and they could be tracking us.\" Cherry soon remembered the bracelet. \"Don't point fingers at me!\" Carmen glared at Juni. \"I didn't do anything stupid, Stupid!\" \"You better stop calling me names!\" Juni glared back. Atticus soon took the bracelet from Carmen. \"Hey, that's mine!\" Carmen pouted. Atticus took a look at the bracelet and saw a red light blinking on the back. \"Your brother's right, Carmen, they're tracking our moves!\" he then panicked. He soon crushed the bracelet with one squeeze. \"Atticus!\" Carmen pouted. \"Sorry, but I don't think keeping a bracelet that's a tracking device is a good idea.\" Atticus said. Carmen sighed, she then tried to use the water fountain, but it seemed to keep shooting water everywhere. Someone who looked like Juni soon appeared in front of them. \"Um, hey, Juni, nice pajamas...?\" Atticus looked confused at first. \"If that's Juni, then who's that next to him?\" Cherry asked. A girl then picked up Juni high in the air with unholy strength. \"Evil clones?\" Cherry asked Atticus nervously. \"I don't think so, they're probably cyborgs.\" Atticus guessed. \"Then you better handle them.\" Cherry said. Atticus looked ready as he cracked everything. \"Stay safe.\" \"Like anything's gonna happen to me with you here.\" Cherry replied innocently. \"She's right.\" Drell said. Atticus jumped over in front of the robot children who resembled Carmen and Juni. \"If you want them; you'll have to go through me.\" he then said. Carmen and Juni's robot clones glared. \"Any last words?\" Atticus glared back. Carmen and Juni's robots spoke in gibberish. \"I-I'm sorry, what was that?\" Atticus raised an eyebrow. \"I don't think they have any brains.\" Juni said. \"Juni, destroy the brain!\" Carmen cried out. \"Destroy it!\" The Carmen cyborg soon looked at Juni. She soon threw Juni against the merry-go-round and stormed toward him while her eyes glowed. Atticus was about to go stop her. Juni's cyborg soon latched onto Atticus's back to drag him down. To the cyborg's surprise, he wasn't slowing down. Carmen's clone soon grabbed onto the merry-go-round and spun it unbelievably fast. \"Wow.\" Cherry said. She soon looked quite sick to her stomach as she watched this too closely before she passed out into Drell's arms. \"Oh, sure, why not?\" Drell groaned. \"Is there three of you?\" Cherry muttered dizzily. \"No.\" Drell said. \"I hear colors...\" Cherry replied. \"Guys, don't try to beat your doubles, I don't want you guys to get hurt.\" Atticus told the Cortez siblings. \"Okay!\" The Cortez siblings told him. \"Let's see you guys take on the junior Man of Steel.\" Atticus scoffed at the robot clones. The robot clones soon charged at him. Atticus just stood there as he knew it wouldn't hurt him. And where he was right. \"Floop could have at least sent a cyborg that could stand a chance.\" Atticus scoffed. \"Give 'em Hell, Atticus!\" Drell cheered and laughed. Atticus was about to tie up both cyborgs. The cyborgs glared at Atticus as they wanted to fight him. Atticus clamped his hands on their foreheads as they tried to run at him again, only to get stuck. And where this cyborg looked just like him as it was just as strong as him. \"Aw, no, it's like Sonic vs Metal Sonic.\" Cherry panicked. \"Yeah, this is bad.\" Drell said. \"Do I wanna know?\" Cherry asked. \"Atticus might actually be in trouble.\" Drell told her. \"Come on, it's Atticus, what could go wrong?\" Cherry replied. \"This cyborg is as strong as him and where he might actually get hurt!\" Drell told her. \"But... He's Atticus...\" Cherry replied. \"He's like another son to Zeus... That's why he gave him Hercules's strength when we helped Mount Olympus that one time-\" Atticus was soon punched to the ground. \"HEY!\" he glared as he sat up and seemed to have a black eye. Cherry soon looked wide-eyed at what happened to Atticus. \"A-A-Are you okay?\" she asked nervously. \"I'm fine, I'm not letting him get me that easily!\" Atticus replied before going toward his robotic doppelganger. \"Wait, who's protecting the Cortez kids?\" Drell asked. \"Um, I was kinda hoping you would...\" Cherry tapped her knuckles together nervously. \"You left them alone?\" Drell asked sternly. \"Now, now, don't be mad!\" Cherry replied. \"I'm sure they're still alive!\" And she was right, but the Third Brain had been taken. Even though he wasn't strong as he used to be, Drell grabbed Cherry by her shirt and held her up against a solid wall, several inches above the ground. \"You left the kids alone?!\" \"Hey, we're fine as long as we have Atticus,\" Cherry replied. \"What could possibly go wrong?\" Atticus was soon seen flying into the wall after being punched by his robotic doppelganger. Drell soon stepped back with an arm fold which made Cherry fall onto the ground. All three robot clones soon flew off with rocket shoes as spoon as they had the Third Brain. Atticus groaned as he actually looked hurt for a change. He did however have something in his hand. \"Uh, Atticus, are you okay?\" Cherry smiled nervously. \"Yeah, just a little sore.\" Atticus said. \"Atticus hurt? This is serious,\" Drell took note. He soon noticed something in the strong teenage Wiccan's hand. \"What's that you got there?\" he then asked as he grabbed Atticus's hand. \"His tag.\" Atticus said. Drell took the tag and adjusted his glasses. \"Appears to be one of many robot clones made by Floop.\" \"Whoa.\" Cherry said. \"This is more serious than I thought...\" Drell said. \"Now, no need to panic, as long as we have the Third Brain, we should be fine.\" Cherry's eyes widened, she then tiptoed away nervously while sweating. \"Cherry, they don't have the Third Brain, right?\" Drell asked. \"If I say no, are you gonna do something to me?\" Cherry asked back nervously. \"Who had the Third Brain?\" Drell asked. \"I kept it for a little while...\" Cherry said nervously. \"Okay then, where is it?\" Drell asked. \"It might've fallen out of my pocket...\" Cherry looked away. \"WHAT?!\" Drell snapped. \"Oh, please don't turn me into a cat for 100 years!\" Cherry begged. \"This is bad, this is bad.\" Drell panicked. \"So glad you're not mad at me...\" Cherry smiled softly. Drell soon tackled her and gripped her by her throat. \" YOU IDIOT, HOW COULD YOU LOSE IT?! \" \"I'm sorry!\" Cherry told him. \"Ooh, I don't know what to do with you sometimes...\" Drell folded his arms as he sat on her stomach. \"Is everyone okay?\" Jeremy asked before noticing Drell sitting on Cherry. \"We're fine, but we better get moving,\" Drell replied as he then stood up off from Cherry. \"Who knows what Floop can be capable of with a robot clone stronger than Atticus?\" \"Actually, that robot clone was as strong as me.\" Atticus said. \"Still, he beat you...\" Drell said to him. \"I know...\" Atticus replied. \"Are you sitting on Cherry?\" \"Yes.\" Cherry said for the warlock. \"Get off her.\" Atticus said. \"I am off of her!\" Drell replied as he walked over beside Atticus. Cherry soon struggled to sit up. \"Oh, right.\" She said. Drell soon held out his hand for her. Cherry took it and the next thing she knew, she was flying in the air by accident. \"Oh, my God... SORRY!\" Drell winced. Atticus soon rescued Cherry. Cherry latched onto him while shivering nervously. \"I'm really sorry, Cherry, I guess that was some hostility.\" Drell said. \"You guess?\" Cherry glared. Drell shrugged sheepishly. Meanwhile... \"Hmm... What to do with you two?\" Floop circled Patch and Perry who were both in a cage. \"Oh, I'm sure you'll think of something.\" Patch said. \"What to do with a puppy dog, and a... Beaver duck...\" Floop said. \"Do you seriously not know what I am?\" Perry deadpanned. \"SHUT UP, BEAVER DUCK, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK!\" Floop glared. \"HE'S A PLATYPUS!\" Patch barked. \"Whatever...\" Floop scoffed. \"Maybe I could sell you two as talking animals to become a multi-gazillionaire.\" \"And as for our owners?\" Patch asked. \"Why should I care?\" Floop smirked. \"Wow, you truly are heartless.\" Patch said. Floop huffed. \"Welcome to the real world, not everything's all sunshine and rainbows.\" \"And where animals are smarter than humans think.\" Patch smirked. Floop narrowed his eyes while Perry also smirked before he soon stormed out. \"That was a good one.\" Perry smiled to Patch. \"Thanks.\" Patch smiled back. Patch began to think of a way to escape. Meanwhile with Sombra, Minion, and Floop... Gregorio and Ingrid had been chained up by the bad guys and left alone while the villains were going to scheme. \"They're all here.\" Sombra smirked. \"We could really win this.\" Floop smirked back. \"That's what I'm hoping for.\" Sombra nodded. \"So, what now?\" Floop grinned excitedly. \"Now, we just have to wait for the three spy kids and Metal Atticus to arrive back with the Third Brain.\" Sombra said. \"Excellent.\" Floop replied as this was working easier than he thought it would, but he had Sombra's recommendation to thank for that. The three robot clones soon came in with the Third Brain and gave it to Sombra and Minion. \"Ah, excellent, they got it!\" Floop grinned excitedly. \"Should I take it into the lab?\" Minion suggested. \"Yes, Minion and Floop, your usefulness has ended.\" Sombra smirked before snapping his fingers, causing Floop to pass out, telling Minion that the man was under his control all along. \"WHAT?!\" Floop and Minion yelled out before they blacked out. \"Not you, Minion; you already knew Floop was under my control.\" Sombra glared as he knew Minion was playing around. \"Sorry, I thought it'd be more believable...\" Minion replied nervously. \"Idiot...\" Sombra rolled her eyes. \"Anyway, take the Third Brain into the lab.\" \"As you wish.\" Minion said. \"And you can command all of the spy kids while I command Metal Atticus.\" Sombra said. \"Yes, of course, sir...\" Minion replied. \"He was your main idea after all.\" \"You are a smart one, unlike Mr. Floop here,\" Sombra chuckled. \"Now tell two of your spy kids to take Floop and imprison him in the virtual room.\" \"Yes, Mr. Sombra.\" Minion replied. \"Good Minion,\" Sombra smirked. \"This is going according as planned.\" \"Brilliant, Mr. Sombra.\" Minion agreed. \"I know I am.\" Sombra said. Minion soon came into the lab and gave the Third Brain to the others where Gregorio was against his will.[Chapter 9] \"What do you think he'll do with us?\" Perry frowned. \"It can't be that bad if he doesn't have a plan.\" Patch shrugged. \"True.\" Perry nodded. Meanwhile, back with Atticus and the others as they were now in a taxi. \"Thanks for taking us this far, but... This is all we got.\" Cherry told the driver as she handed him money. The man accepted the money before he drove off leaving them. \"What are we doing here?\" Juni asked. \"Your father's old codename must be 'Hombre',\" Cherry pointed out the photograph that Carmen had. \"So, this other guy must be Machete.\" \"That was my theory.\" Carmen said. \"We're getting help from Dad's best man?\" Juni scoffed. \"Aw, come on, Cherry actually has a good idea for once.\" Drell told him. \"That's actually a compliment from him.\" Atticus said as he held his black eye with an ice pack. \"Still bad?\" Drell asked. Atticus nodded. \"Don't worry, it'll get better.\" Drell comforted him. \"If Mo was here, she would be freaking out.\" Atticus said. \"Oh, I bet...\" Atticus weakly chuckled. When they came in, there appeared to be a man in uniform, minding his own business. Phineas, Ferb, and Juni looked curious to what he was doing and came up to him. \"What are you working on?\" Juni asked the man. \"World's smallest camera.\" The man replied before showing his index finger. \"We don't see it.\" Phineas said. \"Ah, but it sees you.\" The man replied as he took out a hand camera to show the boys looking right back at him from the teensy-weensy camera. \"Whoa.\" Ferb said. \"Wow, that's super cool!\" Phineas beamed. \"It sure is.\" Juni smiled. \"You sell counterintelligence stuff here?\" Carmen asked. \"Come back with your parents.\" The man replied as he went back to work. \"They can't.\" Drell replied as he, as usual, knew everything there was to know about this assignment since Cherry and Atticus were involved. \"It's true.\" Atticus said. \"They're right,\" Carmen agreed as she took out a portable tracker. \"We need something fast that can get us here.\" \"Who are you?\" The man asked. \"Carmen, do you thing.\" Cherry said. Carmen soon said her full name again which gained access to a door behind the man. \"Gregorio Cortez is our father.\" She then told the man as he looked shocked that that had happened. \"You were at his wedding.\" Juni added. \"He knows you guys.\" Drell told the Cortez siblings. The man suddenly looked firm and serious. \"You will turn around and you will leave my shop,\" he then said without asking them to leave, but demanding it. \"Because I never want to hear my brother's name again.\" \"Wow,\" Drell said. \"Look, Isador, I know you and your brother had your differences, but can't you let bygones be bygones?\" he then asked. \"I mean, you're an uncle now!\" \"You know I can't do that...\" The man looked him back in the eye. \"Yes, but the kids should know their real uncle,\" Drell insisted. \"I mean, they believed all their lives that Felix was their uncle.\" \"He's right.\" Cherry said. Carmen and Juni were surprised to find out this man was their uncle. \"Listen, we just need something fast.\" Drell said. \"Why should I let you in?\" The man asked. \"Izzy, please,\" Drell told him. \"Your brother and his wife are in danger, if you don't help your niece and nephew with what they want or need, they will never see their parents again... Cherry and Atticus will never see their sister or cousin again... I might not have a big heart or be the nicest man in the world, but I care about these kids like my own children, their happiness and safety means the world to me, whose side are you on, Secret Agent boy? If you don't help, the bad guys could win for once and I do not intend to let that happen while I run the show.\" 'Wow.' Cherry thought to herself. The man hummed and soon gave in. \"All right.\" \"Thank you... Um.. Isador, is it?\" Atticus asked. \"Call me Izzy.\" The man replied as he decided to show them his equipment. \"Um, thanks, Izzy.\" Atticus said. \"Don't mention it.\" Izzy replied. \"You're a secret agent, aren't you?\" Carmen asked her actual uncle. \"What makes you say that?\" Izzy chuckled as he let them into the room. \"The stories?\" Phineas guessed. \"I'd say with the database that says he always travels and no one knows what he does for a living.\" Carmen told him. \"I think we all have uncles like that.\" Izzy smiled innocently. \"Maybe.\" Candace said. \"'Another fine Machete product',\" Juni looked up to one device. \"You make the best spy inventions in the world.\" \"That's correct.\" Izzy replied. \"They look amazing.\" Cherry said \"But you sell them to both sides,\" Carmen said to her uncle. \"Good and bad.\" Juni found an old framed photograph of his uncle with Floop. \"That's why your father and your uncle don't talk anymore.\" Drell told Carmen. \"And I don't think selling gadgets to bad guys is a good thing.\" Cherry said. \"Sir, have you ever sold stuff to Floop?\" Phineas asked. Izzy took the picture that Phineas had found of Floop's castle and tucked it into his pocket. \"Why?\" \"Gregorio and Ingrid are their prisoners...\" Drell firmly told Izzy. \"I helped them get married and if you don't help your own brother, something really bad is gonna happen to them!\" \"So, are you going to help us or not?\" Cherry asked. Izzy soon sighed and declined. \"No... I'm sorry.\" \"What is your problem?!\" Atticus glared as he felt angered that Izzy wouldn't help his own brother. \"Easy, Atticus...\" Drell's eyes widened nervously as Atticus's anger was never a pretty sight. \"Why won't you help your own brother?!\" Atticus glared at Izzy. \"You think I want to babysit my brother for the rest of my life?\" Izzy scoffed. \"'Watch out for Gregorio', 'Take care of Gregorio', 'Make sure Gregorio knows from right and wrong'. Not anymore. Machete's not responsible for nobody but Machete.\" \"But family is supposed to always look out for each other, no matter what.\" Atticus said. \"We're just brothers,\" Izzy shrugged. \"Cain and Abel were brothers. Look how they ended up.\" \"Who and who?\" Phineas asked. \"Your family doesn't go to Church, do they?\" Atticus replied. \"Yes, we do.\" Phineas said. \"Then you should know who Cain and Abel are.\" Drell told the pointy-nosed boy. Ferb nodded at this. Drell groaned and decided to tell them anyway. \"Cain and Abel were the sons of Adam and Eve,\" he then explained. \"They were usually violent and even made sacrifices to God.\" Cherry hummed as she tuned out the religious speak due to being strongly agnostic. \"Do you have anything fast?\" Jeremy asked Izzy. \"Hmm...\" Izzy hummed in thought and went to see if he could find anything fast. The others soon followed him. Izzy took them outside and opened what looked like a small garage and pulled out what almost looked like a biplane. \"Now, the only thing that will get you to Floop's castle fast enough is this.\" he showed them. \"Wow.\" Atticus said. \"It's tiny.\" Cherry told the Hispanic man. \"It's built for one passenger, but it's fast.\" Izzy replied. \"Hmm... Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today.\" Phineas smiled. Ferb nodded to this. \"Will you come with us, sir?\" Phineas asked. \"No.\" Izzy replied. \"For your brother?\" Cherry asked. \"NO!\" Izzy still refused. \"Then what about for your niece and nephew?\" Candace tried. \"No.\" Izzy shook his head. \"Boy, you are more stubborn than I am!\" Drell was getting angry with Izzy. \"Then at least give us the blueprints of Floop's Castle as well as some of the gadgets.\" \"I found some.\" Juni replied. \"That'll work.\" Izzy decided as he still refused to see his brother. \"Good.\" Drell said. \"You sure you won't come, sir?\" Stacey asked. \"Yes, but no.\" Izzy replied as he still refused to come along, but would at least help. Well, it was better than nothing. After Phineas and Ferb, made some upgrades to the biplane; it was big enough to fit all of them while still fast. \"Thanks, Phineas and Ferb,\" Cherry told the boys. \"Without you, Drell would probably smush all of us.\" \"HEY!\" Drell glared before he shrugged. \"Forget it... I am close to seven feet.\" \"And it's done.\" Phineas smiled. \"I am impressed, who taught you how to build like that?\" Izzy asked the step-brothers. \"No one.\" Phineas said. \"Huh...\" Izzy was dumbfounded about how clever and genius in machine wise the two boys were. \"Aren't you a little young to be repairmen?\" \"Yes, yes, we are.\" Phineas smiled while Ferb nodded in silence. \"People ask them that question a lot.\" Candace said. \"I can imagine.\" Izzy replied as he was impressed with Phineas and Ferb. Everyone soon got on their spy outfits and took out their spy gadgets. Cherry glumly stared out the window. \"Cherry, your sister will be okay, I promise you.\" Atticus said. \"Whatever...\" Cherry sulked. \"Have I ever broken a promise?\" Atticus asked. \"No...\" Cherry replied. \"But she has...\" \"Cherry, is this about your tenth birthday?\" Atticus replied. \"I'm sure she had an important reason for that.\" \"More important than keeping a promise to your only sister?\" Cherry folded her arms. 'She has me there.' Atticus thought to himself. Cherry sighed and folded her arms. \"Cherry...\" Atticus sighed back as he felt bad for Cherry since she felt miserable when it came to being away from her sister. They soon got into the upgraded biplane. Cherry's stomach weakly growled and she smiled sheepishly. \"Turkey, ham, or chicken?\" Atticus asked. \"Hmm... That honey maple turkey.\" Cherry replied. Atticus then made about four turkey sandwiches with Swiss cheese and mayonnaise to satisfy her appetite for now. \"Yay!\" Cherry smiled. Atticus smiled back. Cherry soon ate the sandwiches with gusto. \"When was the last time you ate?\" Atticus asked. Cherry gulped with a small estranged look. \"Cherry, you need to eat.\" Atticus frowned. \"I'm fat.\" Cherry muffled. \"No, you're not.\" Atticus said. \"Mm-hmm...\" Cherry muffled. \"That's why I don't have a boyfriend.\" \"You haven't found the right guy yet.\" Atticus said. \"I give up...\" Cherry wiped her mouth. \"How do you think I feel?\" Stacey asked. \"I don't have a boyfriend either.\" Cherry sighed as she stared out the window again. \"I should've just stayed home.\" \"Suck it up.\" Drell said. Cherry glared while shaking her fists at him. \"Never send an adult to do a kid's job.\" Juni said as they were going off in the plane now to find his and Carmen's parents. They were now out of the city, flying. \"Okay, let me see here...\" Drell looked around. \"Which one of you guys has the manual?\" \"I have it.\" Atticus said. \"Okay then... You can drive...\" Drell wiggled his cheek. Atticus rubbed his cheek and then took out the manual and memorized it so he could drive. After reading the whole manual, Atticus soon drove. \"And yet you couldn't get into the Wonderbolts.\" Cherry teased. \"Actually, he did.\" Drell smirked. \"Drell!\" Atticus groaned. \"You said you wouldn't go in after they wouldn't let me in since I'm not used to having pegasus wings yet!\" Cherry whispered loudly to Atticus as her Equestrian form had been upgraded from a simple earth pony to a pegasus with her own wings. \"I was, but how could I refuse?\" Atticus whispered back. \"You joined anyway?!\" Cherry flipped out. \"It's the Wonderbolts; what did you expect?\" Drell asked. \"Atticus...!\" Cherry pouted. \"What can I say?\" Atticus smiled sheepishly. \"Spitfire knows how to give you an offer you can't refuse.\" \"Alright, I guess I understand.\" Cherry said. \"It's nothing personal...\" Atticus replied. \"Besides, I could give you flying lessons...\" Cherry rubbed her shoulder as she stared out the window, she was a little self-conscious since she was kind of afraid of heights and now she had her own wings. \"The trick is to not look down.\" Atticus said. \"If I don't look down, how do I know where I'm going?\" Cherry grew paranoid. \"If you look down, you'll get scared, and then you'll crash into a mountain.\" Drell smirked. \"Ooh, I didn't ask for wings, you know!\" Cherry moaned. \"I know.\" Drell said. \"You did this to me, didn't you?\" Cherry glared at him. \"You're never satisfied until I'm miserable, so you made Celestia give me wings because I'm afraid of heights!\" \"You have to get over this fear.\" Drell said. \"Well, maybe I don't wanna face my fears!\" Cherry sulked. \"You'll have to.\" Drell said. \"Why are you so mean to me?!\" Cherry whined. \"To make you grow a spine.\" Drell said. Cherry lowly growled as she felt she didn't need his help there. Atticus stuck his tongue out and soon made the plane do a loop in the air. \"Wahoo!\" Phineas cheered. Atticus chuckled as he felt glad he did that while driving the plane. \"Atticus Fudo, don't you dare do that again!\" Cherry glared. \"What?\" Atticus teased before doing it again anyway. \"This?\" \"YES! THAT!\" Cherry glared. \"Yes? Yes, do it, okay!\" Atticus smirked as he did the loop again. \"ATTICUS!\" Cherry yelled out. \"I'M GONNA KILL YOU!\" One of the wings soon got cut off. \"Atticus, what did you do?!\" Cherry asked. \"I didn't do anything!\" Atticus replied. \"Yeah!\" Drell added. \"I feeeeel siiiick!\" Cherry's face suddenly turned bright green. \"Oh, brother.\" Drell rolled his eyes. Cherry rolled beside Atticus. \"Why, you little-\" she then strangled him in a Homer vs Bart Simpson fashion. \"Yeah, I feel nothing.\" Atticus said. \"LOSER!\" Cherry snapped out. Atticus shoved her over so he could try to take control. Cherry looked even more sick. \"Drell... Make him pull over...\" she soon begged. \"We're still in the air.\" Drell said. BANG! They hit a rock as they were still in the air in a very dizzy spinning cycle. Atticus clicked on the landing gear button so they could land in the desert and stop this ride since Cherry was very sick to her stomach now. \"Finally.\" Cherry groaned. The wheels then broke off right on the sand. \"Aw, come on!\" Atticus frowned at that. \"Looks like I'll have to land this thing from outside.\" \"What does that mean?\" Cherry asked before freaking out. \"Drell, what does that mean!?\" \"Remember his superpowers?\" Drell whispered to her. \"Oooohhh!\" Cherry covered her eyes. \"I don't wanna die with you next to me!\" Atticu soon flew out and went to the front of the biplane. Cherry took out a bag and breathed in and out of it frantically. The others soon woke up to see what was going on as Atticus put Superman's mentoring and help into good use about using his superpowers. And where he was able to stop the biplane with ease. \"Will you relax?\" Drell rolled his eyes to Cherry. \"You're not gonna die.\" Cherry soon sighed once the biplane stopped. \"Thank you for choosing Atticus Fudo airlines for all your travel needs,\" Atticus smiled. \"Please do not move until the ride comes to a complete stop.\" He soon gently put the biplane on the ground.[Chapter 10] \"Well, there it is,\" Phineas said as they looked from afar. \"Floop's Castle.\" \"Alright, let's go there.\" Jeremy said. \"We'll have to swim...\" Atticus said once he looked at the water. \"Okay, I'll wait here until you get back.\" Cherry replied as she wasn't a strong swimmer. \"Do you not remember King Triton's gift to you?\" Drell whispered to her. Cherry looked away and folded her arms. \"Can I?\" Drell looked hopeful to Atticus about making Cherry go in the water since she could swim now. \"Yes.\" Atticus said. \"Can he what?\" Cherry asked. Drell soon picked up Cherry over his shoulder like Shrek did with Princess Fiona when they first met. \"Hey, put me down!\" Cherry demanded. \"Okay.\" Drell smirked as he put her in the ocean. \"HEY!\" Cherry yelped as she was thrown out into the water before she splashed into it and she had her mermaid tail fin. \"Now let's swim.\" Atticus said. The others soon followed after into the water so they could get to Floop's castle together. It took a while until they got inside the castle. The others who weren't merpeople looked surprised as they had on scuba gear while underwater. Once inside, they took off their scuba gear. Little did they know, they were being watched by the bad guys. \"You shall now be perfect.\" Sombra smirked as he inserted the copy of the Third Brain into Metal Atticus. Metal Atticus's eyes seemed to glow red once the Third Brain was in his system. \"Are you ready for Round 2?\" Sombra smirked. \"Yes, Master Uncle Sombra.\" Metal Atticus replied. \"Excellent.\" Sombra smirked. \"Yes.\" Metal Atticus nodded. \"It's all going according to plan.\" Sombra rubbed his human hands in victory, excitement, and anticipation. Metal Atticus soon flew straight through a wall, proving he was the strongest out of the robots. \"Make me proud.\" Sombra saluted. A thumb guy was keeping guard as the others came in through the water from the castle. Atticus was the first to come out of the water. Drell held out his hands. Atticus took them and grunted as he pulled him onto dry land. \"You're not a bad swimmer.\" he had to admit. \"I've picked up some things that time Sabrina turned into a goldfish during Cliché Week.\" Drell replied. \"Wow.\" Atticus said. \"Not to mention that time Sabrina wanted to be a mermaid during that long, dull winter.\" Drell replied. \"Right.\" Atticus said. Everyone soon hid before the Thumb guy could see them as he thought he heard voices somehow. He soon went to see if he was right. Atticus pinched Cherry's nose while Drell covered her mouth as they hid while preventing her from making noise. The thumb guy soon started to look for them. Cherry soon looked a little loopy from Drell covering her mouth and Atticus pinching her nose and seemed to have lack of oxygen. Carmen took out a green gumball and chewed it quickly before spitting it onto the thumb guy as he came toward her and the others and he soon short-circuited. \"What did you do to him?!\" Juni gasped. Carmen took out a pack to show him. \"'Machete's Electroshock Gumballs',\" she then read aloud the label. \"It says long-lasting, but I don't trust wrappers.\" \"Let's get going.\" Jeremy said. Atticus looked around and saw a possible way before going there. Drell then ran beside him. Cherry soon sneezed and sniffled from the ocean water. \"This should be easy.\" Candace said. \"I sure hope it is.\" Stacey replied to her best friend. The young boys placed Izzy's tiny cameras on the walls as they ran down the halls. \"Guys, come on!\" Carmen rushed the boys as they seemed to be going different ways than her. \"Okay, okay.\" Phineas said. \"What're you guys doing anyway?\" Candace asked. \"Those tiny cameras.\" Phineas showed with Juni and Ferb. \"Ohh.\" Candace said. \"We placed them all over the main hallways.\" Juni showed on the handheld camera. \"That's really brilliant.\" Jeremy approved. \"Yeah.\" Stacey agreed. \"Ooh, we got company,\" Cherry noticed. \"Floop's Fooglies and those thumb guys.\" \"They're coming up the south hall.\" Juni added. \"Oh, great.\" Drell groaned. \"Now what?\" Cherry froze in the spot. \"Look.\" Drell said. \"Any ideas?\" Candace asked Juni, Phineas, and Ferb. Juni looked up past the ceiling and suddenly had an idea. \"Yeah.\" \"Time to use another invention.\" Atticus said. \"A cord?\" Cherry asked as Juni took out one invention. \"Not really impressive.\" Candace added. Juni plopped the suction end of the cord up so they could slide up to hide against the ceiling. They all soon went up. Luckily, they all made it up in time as the Fooglies and the thumb men came around to check for anything suspicious. Cherry tried to keep still, but soon her eyes crossed nervously as a spider landed on the bridge of her nose and she was about to have a nervous breakdown. Drell soon got rid of the spider. Cherry whimpered and had tears in her eyes and Drell soon nudged her to let her know that he got rid of the spider for her. Juni slid on the special glasses and began to scan down the Fooglies and found out who they really were before they looked that way. After doing that, he had to ask one of them where Gregorio and Ingrid and Patch and Perry were. The Foogly spoke to him and Juni soon recorded what he was saying. \"Thanks!\" Juni replied before zipping back up to the others. \"Well?\" Phineas asked. \"I've got it.\" Juni replied. \"What'd he say?\" Cherry asked. \"I'll play it backwards.\" Juni said as he set his watch as he recorded the speech, but played it backwards so they could understand. 'Dungeon, they're in the dungeon, hurry.' The watch played the audio. \"Ask them where the dungeon is.\" Atticus replied to Juni. Juni soon went back down only to be surrounded by the thumb men. \"Uh-oh...\" he then quickly zipped back up. \"Thumb-Thumbs, everywhere!\" \"Oh, great.\" Candace groaned. \"Let's see if they like bubbles.\" Carmen said as she took out a tube of Machete Bubbles and blew against the wand which sent a rather large bubble filled with static electricity. \"Nice.\" Phineas smiled. The bubble soon popped, shocking all of the thumb guys and instantly making them fall onto the ground. Everyone soon came down and were faced with the Fooglies. Atticus soon broke the Fooglies free. The Fooglies smiled to them. \"Tnega wollef ,pleh ruoy rof sknaht.\" The Fooglies smiled to Atticus. Atticus soon used a translation of what they said. 'Thanks for your help, fellow agent.' The translation told Atticus. \"You're welcome.\" Atticus said. Drell snuck close to the wall as he looked nervous once he saw what was up ahead. \"The robot spy kids...\" he muttered. \"Oh, great.\" Cherry groaned. 'All robot copies please report to Docking Bays 4, 5, and 6, for immediate loading.' The voice on the intercom announced. \"Whose voice is that?\" Candace asked. \"That must be Minion,\" Drell guesstimated. \"Uh, Atticus, I have a bad feeling about who else is here besides Floop.\" \"I can take it.\" Atticus replied. \"It's... Uh...\" Drell covered Cherry's ears. \"Your Uncle Sombra.\" \"What?!\" Atticus gasped. Drell nodded as he then let go of Cherry who glared at him for that. \"I'm afraid so.\" \"Sombra's here, isn't he?\" Cherry complained. \"I'm not scared of him, he just wants to kill me for befriending Atticus and distracting him from what he wants him to do for the Crystal Empire!\" \"That's why I covered your ears.\" Drell said. \"I'm not afraid of Sombra...\" Cherry narrowed her eyes. \"Oh, please, you're basically the Anastasia to his Rasputin.\" Drell replied. \"Um, thanks?\" Cherry said. \"No, Cherry, that's bad...\" Drell replied. \"Aw, come on, that's just one of those dark fairy tales German parents tell their kids to make them behave.\" Cherry scoffed. \"No, that guy was real.\" Drell said. \"Uh-huh...\" Cherry replied as she made goofy faces as she thought Drell was being crazy. \"Don't make me get all Master Yo on you!\" Drell threatened. \"Blah, blah, blah...\" Cherry said. \"All right, Atticus, how do we do this?\" \"We'll have to split up.\" Atticus said. Cherry's eyes bugged out of her head. \"Can we go with you?\" Phineas asked, referring to himself and Ferb since Atticus was the big brother they had always wanted. \"Sure you can, boys.\" Atticus said. Phineas and Ferb smiled to that. \"I'd say boys and girls go together, but it might not be fair,\" Drell replied. \"Especially for Cherry.\" \"Hey!\" Cherry glared. \"So, how do you wanna do this?\" Drell asked Atticus about splitting up. \"We will have to split up into two groups without any complaints about certain people.\" Atticus glared at Drell about the last part. \"What did I do?\" Drell asked like he didn't do anything. \"Anyways, let's get going.\" Atticus said. Everyone then moved out to save Gregorio, Ingrid, Patch, and Perry. \"It should be smooth sailing from here on.\" Drell said. The robot kids soon turned around with sparkling eyes. \"Uh-oh,\" Drell muttered. \"I think they know we're not one of them.\" \"No, what gave you that idea?\" Cherry deadpanned. \"Intruders...\" THe robot kids soon said to each other. \"Run!\" Atticus yelled. They soon all ran only to come over to the floor trap that Gregorio, Ingrid, Patch, and Perry discovered earlier and were separated. \"Can you make it?\" Juni asked.' \"I think so.\" Carmen replied before she stepped back and ran to jump over the ledge only to fall as the ledge broke even more. \"Carmen!\" Juni called down. \"Find Mom and Dad!\" Carmen called back. \"Half of us will have to go with Carmen.\" Drell said. Cherry stepped back suddenly. Drell put his arm around her with a chuckle only for him to scream as Atticus pushed him in with a glare. \"I'll go with them.\" Stacey said before jumping down. \"Stacey!\" Candace cried out to her best friend. \"Well, at least nothing bad happened to me...\" Cherry stepped back from the ledge. Unfortunately for her, the floor under her feet gave way. \"WAH!\" she yelped as she fell down after the others. Atticus and the others soon saw the robot kids coming for them. The others began to run while Atticus cracked his neck and knuckles as he looked ready to fight against the robot kids. The robot kids soon ran past him as a familiar robot was walking towards him. \"Don't worry, guys, I got this!\" Atticus called out to them before looking to his robotic counterpart. \"Aw, great... It's you.\" \"Ready for Round 2?\" Metal Atticus smirked. \"Bring it on, Robot Boy.\" Atticus glared. \"Oh, this is going to be fun.\" Metal Atticus smirked. Atticus rolled his eyes. \"Ladies first.\" he then mocked. Metal Atticus's eyes soon glowed red and he charged against Atticus, sending him flying against the wall. The two of them were now in a brawl. Atticus glared while Metal Atticus smirked not-so innocently. Juni and the others were soon at the door to the virtual room. \"I hope this leads to the dungeon.\" he said as he opened the door while going with the others as he felt overwhelmed without Carmen. They all soon went inside the room. He soon saw what looked like a deserted wasteland. \"You there...\" Floop's face seemed to appear in the clouds. \"What's that on your hands?\" \"Floop?\" Phineas asked. The image soon warped all around, though Floop was still there. \"Warts, aren't they?\" Floop continued. \"Oh, great... From sweaty hands sprout warts.\" ' Wow.' Ferb thought to himself. \"Do you know why you have sweaty hands?\" Floop continued as he looked directly at Juni. \"From being scared all the time. You don't look very scared to me.\" \"That's because he's angry at you.\" Phineas said. \"You kidnapped my parents, made psycho robot children, and swallowed up my sister, not to mention you took away Atticus's cousin, Cherry's sister, and Phineas and Ferb's pet platypus and Atticus's pet puppy.\" Juni added. \"But I didn't want any of that.\" Floop sighed. \"None of us do.\" Jeremy said. \"I thought Floop was a genius.\" Juni frowned as he looked heartbroken. \"Same here.\" Phineas added. Ferb also nodded as he looked a little betrayed. \"You did?\" Floop asked the young boys. \"You all watch my show?\" Juni showed his Floop action figure with a sigh. \"We sure do.\" Phineas said. \"More than you know.\" Juni added. Ferb nodded in agreement.[Chapter 11] Meanwhile, Minion came to see Ingrid, Gregorio, Perry, and Patch as they were locked up together. Patch began to growl at Minion. \"Alexander Minion.\" Gregorio looked at the man as he entered the room. Perry growled at Minion, not liking him one bit. \"Agent Cortez,\" Minion greeted Gregorio. \"Wonderful to see you again.\" \" Again ?\" Patch asked. \"You know him?\" Ingrid added. \"Yeah,\" Gregorio told his wife and the animal OWCA agents. \"He was on the Third Brain Project until I noticed he was trying to inject his own ideas into the system. I turned him in. He was thrown out of the OSS.\" \"Whoa.\" Patch said. \"I'm afraid I'm not nearly the artist Floop is,\" Minion replied as he took out a paper. \"But not to worry. I have something else in mind.\" \"What do you mean?\" Patch asked. \"What do you think you're going to accomplish by doing this?\" Ingrid sneered as Minion soon latched on a helmet onto her husband's head. \"Well, you see, Mrs. Cortez, I've always been methodical, goal oriented,\" Minion continued. \"Psychotically so.\" \"But that doesn't explain why you're doing this.\" Perry said. \"I'm not afraid of you, Alex.\" Gregorio scowled at Minion as he was hooked up. \"Besides, what else are you going to do to him?\" Patch asked. \"Ah, you meddling animals, whose bright idea was it to have animal secret agents anyway as common household pets?\" Minion scoffed at him. \"So I think it's refreshing to every once in a while, have some fun. Oh, and don't worry about your little brats. They'll still be able to see you. Every weekday morning between 7:30 and 8:00.\" he then pushed a button. \"He's gonna turn them into Fooglies!\" Perry gasped to Patch. \"But how?\" Patch asked. \"Allow me to demonstrate, you mongrels.\" Minion smirked as he took out Juni's drawing and put it against a scanner to scan it into Gregorio's DNA to make him into a Foogly. This caused Patch and Perry to gasp. Minion smirked as this was going according to his and Sombra's plan. 'I hope Atticus and the others are okay.' Patch thought to himself. Cherry yelped as she soon fell with Carmen and the others and landed on something soft. \"Huh... Well, that wasn't so bad...\" Cherry said once she had a soft landing for once. \"Yeah, for once.\" Drell agreed. Cherry looked around only to see he landed next to her and breathed in relief as he didn't land on top of her. \"Phew!\" \"What should we do now?\" Candace asked. \"Shh...\" Drell said before turning to the other way as he heard a machine with some thumping. \"Do you hear that?\" \"Yeah.\" Carmen nodded. Drell came closer to the end and saw several Thumb-Thumbs in action like a factory assembly line as they were being created. \"I have an idea.\" Drell whispered. \"Uh-oh.\" Cherry replied. Meanwhile with Atticus and Metal Atticus... \"You don't know when to quit, do you?\" Atticus glared at his robotic clone. \"Because... I AM YOU ! \" Metal Atticus glared back with fiery red eyes. The two of them soon smirked as this seemed like fun to them. Atticus soon pinned down Metal Atticus. \"What's your story?\" he demanded. \"I was programmed to be your equal.\" Metal Atticus glared back. \"Equal, huh?\" Atticus asked. \"Is that all?\" \"Master Uncle Sombra gave me specific instruction.\" Metal Atticus replied. \"You don't have to do what he programmed you to do.\" Atticus said. \"Yes, I do,\" Metal Atticus replied. \"I must complete my assignment: Study... Defeat... REPLACE!\" \"Do you want to though?\" Atticus asked. \"I know you're a robot, but you can make your own decisions.\" \"I-I have no choice.\" Metal Atticus said. \"Sure you do.\" Atticus replied. Metal Atticus was now struggling not to kick Atticus in the...balls. \"Come on, you can trust me...\" Atticus told his robotic counterpart. \"You don't have to serve, uh... Master Uncle Sombra. I know I sure as heck don't.\" Metal Atticus soon stopped struggling and didn't fight anymore. Atticus soon got off from him. Metal Atticus stood up beside him and his eyes didn't look red anymore and they were now blue just like the real Atticus's. \"Thank you.\" Metal Atticus smiled. Atticus smiled back to his robotic clone. They soon shook hands to make amends and become friends. \"We better find the others.\" Atticus said. Metal Atticus nodded. \"I might know where they are.\" Atticus followed his robot clone to search for the others. Metal Atticus soon lead him into the virtual room. \"A Virtual Room?\" Atticus replied. \"Yep, this is where half of them are.\" Metal Atticus said. \"Man, I really miss Mo right now...\" Atticus sighed. \"Why did James have to take her to meet Blythe now?\" Metal Atticus simply shrugged. Floop was seen talking with the boys, but he didn't seem evil this time. Metal Atticus and Atticus both soon walked in. \"Floop...\" Atticus whispered with a glare. \"Don't worry, he's not bad,\" Metal Atticus told him. \"He's just been controlled by Master Uncle Sombra.\" \"That makes sense.\" Atticus said. \"I knew you'd understand.\" Metal Atticus replied. \"Is there a way to get you out?\" Phineas asked. \"It's impossible,\" Floop replied. \"It can only be turned off from the outside.\" \"What if it was electrocuted?\" Jeremy asked. \"Hm...\" Floop hummed. \"I don't know about that.\" \"It's worth a shot then.\" Jeremy insisted with a small shrug. \"Gadget Time.\" Phineas said. Ferb nodded. \"We're gonna need a blow torch and some peanut butter.\" Phineas told his step-brother. \"Peanut butter?\" Jeremy asked out of confusion. \"It's an inventor thing.\" Phineas replied. Ferb nodded back. Jeremy chuckled. \"I love it when you guys invent, it reminds me of Wallace and Gromit.\" The step-brothers soon started to invent. Juni came toward them. \"Uh, could I help?\" he then asked. \"You can if you want.\" Phineas allowed. \"Great.\" Juni smiled. Phineas and Ferb soon worked together with Juni. \"You two really are brilliant.\" Floop admired Phineas and Ferb's help. \"Thanks.\" Phineas said. \"Oh, if I could, I'd stop the robot army and hope that the world would forgive me.\" Floop said as he seemed stuck. \"Oh, trust us, they will.\" Jeremy said. \"We're gonna help you and you're gonna help us, Floop.\" Phineas added. \"Yeah.\" Juni said. \"Minion must be stopped.\" Ferb soon said. \"Whoa!\" Floop did a double take at him. \"I thought you were a mute kid!\" \"Ferb talks sometimes.\" Phineas said. Juni soon took out one of the gumballs and decided to chew it and spit it onto Floop like his sister did against a Thumb-Thumb. \"Nice.\" Phineas said. Floop was soon shocked and the virtual room shifted and everything was as it should be. \"Now let's stop Minion.\" Juni narrowed his eyes. \"Yeah.\" Atticus said. \"Along with Uncle Sombra.\" Metal Atticus added. They then looked to each other and smiled as they had the same idea. They all soon left the virtual room. \"Must be stopped! Must be stopped!\" Floop ranted on the way. They soon noticed some Thumb-Thumbs. \"This one's for my sister!\" Juni glared as he tackled down the Thumb-Thumb right in front of him. To his surprise, it wasn't a real Thumb-Thumb. \"Ugh, why did I agree to this?\" Drell groaned as he took off the head to reveal himself. \"Hola.\" Juni smiled innocently. \"Get off.\" Drell said. \"No, no, stay on.\" Cherry walked over with her hands in her pockets. \"You're enjoying this, aren't you?\" Drell groaned. Cherry took out a random plate, she then grinned, but each time she moved the plate, it would be a sour frown and she did this over and over again just to annoy him. \"Quit it.\" Drell glared. Cherry didn't stop. \"Cherry... Stop it...\" Drell demanded. \"Nope...\" Cherry replied. \"Okay, Cherry, that's enough.\" Atticus said. Cherry narrowed her eyes and walked up to him. \"How do I know you're the real Atticus?\" \"Because I'm Metal Atticus.\" The robot clone told her. \"Wait, what?\" Cherry's eyes widened before she looked ready to fight. Drell soon stood up with a growl. \"What have you done with our Atticus, you Robot Freak?!\" \"Calm down; Metal Atticus is good now.\" Atticus said. \"What?\" Cherry and Drell asked. \"We talked, trust me...\" Atticus told them. \"It's true.\" Metal Atticus said. \"Hmm...\" Cherry hummed suspiciously. \"Did you guys find the dungeon?\" Juni asked hopefully. \"I know where it is.\" Metal Atticus said. \"Take us there, please, the Fooglies told us that our parents were there.\" Juni told the robot. \"Follow me.\" Metal Atticus said, leading the way. The others then followed after him.[Chapter 12] Atticus soon helped Drell up and they were going to the dungeon to save Ingrid, Gregorio, Patch, and Perry. \"Carmen? Juni?\" Ingrid's voice asked. \"Mom!\" Juni and Carmen smiled. Something soon came out which startled Carmen. \"That's my Foogly!\" Juni recognized. \"The one I drew...\" \"And those are like ours, Ferb.\" Phineas pointed to the other two locked up with the main one. \"It's Dad...\" Juni soon took his Foogly's hand. \"But if that's your dad, then that must mean these two are...\" Atticus frowned. \"Lawrence and Linda?\" Cherry asked. \"No... Patch and Perry.\" Atticus frowned. \"Oh... I guess that's more logical then.\" Cherry replied. \"You're here!\" Ingrid beamed once she reunited with Carmen before glaring to Floop. \"What's he doing here?\" Floop soon took out the keys so he could help free her. \"He's okay, he's okay.\" Carmen reassured her mother. Metal Atticus soon pulled the bars of the cage out. \"Nice work!\" Atticus smiled to his robotic double. \"How did you get here?\" Ingrid asked her daughter. \"Mom, I've been skipping school, going places, taking ferry rides in the city-\" Carmen said as she stepped back while her mother walked out. \"What?\" Ingrid asked. \"Running off to Belize...\" Carmen continued before they could officially hug. \"Wow.\" Candace said. \"We'll talk about this when we get home.\" Ingrid decided. Carmen then nodded in agreement. Juni soon ran toward his mother and hugged her. Drell checked his pocket as he had a hidden envelope and patted it as it was safe. \"What's that?\" Atticus climbed over his shoulder. \"Mmm...\" Drell looked around innocently as he tried to ignore Atticus for right now as this was a surprise for later. \"Drell?\" Atticus prompted. \"This is supposed to be a surprise, but... Here...\" Drell shrugged and handed him the paper. Atticus took the paper and saw that it was an acceptance letter to Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. This caused for him to get excited. \"I wanted to surprise you, but I talked with Professor Xavier...\" Drell replied. \"He owed me one after our last meeting.\" \"Awesome!\" Atticus smiled. Drell smiled back at his excitement, knowing how much this would mean to the young wiccan. \"Way to go, Atticus.\" Cherry commented as she wasn't sure how to feel about this. \"This way, I'll be able to master my powers.\" Atticus smiled. He soon hugged Cherry. \"Oh, isn't this exciting, Cherry? I'll be one of the X-Men!\" \"Good for you, like that time you got into the Wonderbolts and I didn't.\" Cherry sighed softly. \"Hey, what's this behind your ear?\" Drell asked before bringing out an acceptance letter from behind Cherry's ear. \"It's an acceptance letter to Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters!\" \"What?\" Cherry asked as she took the letter. \"How did I get in?!\" \"I might have added in that you need help with your dream-bending powers and vampire powers.\" Drell said. \"Drell, I'm shocked...\" Cherry replied. \"And a little touched.\" \"I also sent one to Mo.\" Drell said. \"Yes!\" Atticus beamed as this was the best surprise ever. \"That is... If Minion and Sombra don't take over Earth first.\" Drell gulped. \"Oh, they won't.\" Metal Atticus said after freeing Gregorio, Perry, and Patch. \"Thanks, buddy.\" Atticus smiled to his robot counterpart. \"You turned my dad and their pets into Fooglies?\" Juni asked Floop. \"No, I didn't,\" Floop replied. \"But I might be able to change them back.\" \"You can.\" Metal Atticus smiled. Bridget and Teresa were soon forced into skin tight clothing as Sombra and Minion found them attractive and were going to keep them as slaves since it looked like they were going to win, but of course, they wouldn't. \"This is the life.\" Sombra smirked. \"You are so right.\" Minion agreed, though at first had trouble sitting in his new chair. Bridget and Teresa stood beside the doors after they let in men to meet the two. \"Gentlemen,\" Minion smirked to the incoming guests. \"Your army marches to meet us as we speak. Your faith and your patience have meant more than you know. I speak for Mr. Floop when I say that the value, we place on partnership is-\" Unfortunately for him, he was interrupted. 'Minion, this is Floop!' Floop's voice said. 'Please report to the robotics lab at once!' \"What is it, you stupid fool?\" Sombra grumbled. 'We have huge, major, big-time problems with the robots.' Floop replied. \"Oh, you can not be serious.\" Sombra groaned. \"I thought you said Floop wasn't here?\" Lisp glanced at Sombra and Minion. \"He wasn't.\" Sombra said. 'A problem, Mr. Minion, as in mucho grande problemo.' Floop continued. \"Fine, come on, Minion, let's go.\" Sombra glared. They came into the room as it was empty with hints of steam. 'Minion!\" Floop called out. \"Floop! Where are you?\" Minion glared. \"Behind you.\" Floop's voice replied. Minion looked behind him only to see that it was Juni. \"What do you think you're doing?\" Minion glared. \"You're supposed to be in line with the others!\" \"You're supposed to be with the others!\" Juni mimicked Minion. \"Stop that.\" Minion glared. \"Stop that!\" Juni smirked. \"Stop that this instant!\" Minion demanded. \"Stop that this instant!\" Juni repeated. \"Stop that right now!\" Sombra glared. \"Or what?\" Juni smirked as he continued to imitate Minion. Gregorio, Perry, and Patch soon appeared. They appeared to be back to normal and Gregorio slipped off his mustache. \"Clever boy you got there, Cortez,\" Minion muttered. \"Very clever indeed.\" \"He gets that from his mother.\" Gregorio nodded back as Ingrid slipped in right behind them. \"Oh, great, you're here too.\" Sombra said. \"Can I offer some sort of truce in exchange for your daughter and owner?\" Minion smirked to Patch and the Cortez couple. \"Spoken for.\" Carmen and Atticus replied as they suddenly appeared. \"Oh, great,\" Sombra groaned. \"Well, I'm outta here.\" \"Aw, what's wrong, Uncle Sombra?\" Atticus taunted. \"You scared to lose against the good guys again?\" Sombra had already teleported away, knowing who would win in the end. Atticus sighed. \"There he goes again...\" \"And all this trouble because of a broken heart caused by Princess Celestia.\" Drell commented. \"Wait, what?\" Atticus asked. \"Oh, you never knew about that?\" Drell asked. \"I'll explain later, but right now, Minion must be stopped.\" Minion was soon strapped down on a table. \"I am going to show you what happens when you cross the line and involve family.\" Gregorio sneered at Minion and Carmen and Juni were shocked to see their father in action like this. Ingrid soon strapped Minion's legs down on to the table. \"Now, let's get nice and comfortable.\" She added as she hooked up the skull cap onto him for revenge. Floop handed some clay to Gregorio as he seemed to be smushing some of the others before he accepted one. \"Yes!\" Soon enough, Gregorio showed his work on it. \"Promising.\" Floop smiled. \"Thank you.\" Gregorio replied until he slammed down the finished product which seemed to have four heads. \"Perfect.\" Metal Atticus said. \"You couldn't possibly!\" Minion called out. \"No, but you can!\" Gregorio replied as he put the button in Minion's hand against his will. \"Don't let go, Ingrid.\" \"Bye.\" Atticus smirked at Minion. \"You two, come on!\" Gregorio told his kids. Juni and Carmen went after him so they could all leave the castle. Floop led them on the way out. \"There's a 0% chance he won't let go of the button.\" Metal Atticus told them. \"You say that like it's a bad thing.\" Cherry replied. \"A bad thing for him.\" Metal Atticus smirked. \"Oh... Good...\" Cherry replied as she was worried this was going to have a twist ending. They soon came to a corner. \"Come on,\" Floop told the others quietly. \"We have to keep the army from leaving the castle. Our only chance is to get to the control room and hope that their missions have not been programmed.\" \"And if they have?\" Atticus asked. \"Then there's no one on Earth who can stop them.\" Floop replied. \"Ahem!\" Metal Atticus cleared his throat. \"Oh, except for you of course.\" Floop then said with a sheepish smile. \"Let's get to the control room.\" Atticus said. They began to move out and Carmen and Juni's robot doubles came behind Gregorio and Ingrid. Everyone ran down only to come to a fork in the hallway. \"Left, left, left, left!\" Floop slid down the floor and pointed to the right way. \"Where's Mom and Dad?\" \"I think I know who has them now.\" Metal Atticus said. Floop checked the screen. \"I knew it!\" Metal Atticus said as he saw Carmen and Juni's doppelgangers. \"Floop, can you shut them down from here?\" Juni asked. Floop tried only to push the button and a big screen with the words 'TOO LATE' popped up. \"Seriously?\" Drell asked, unimpressed. \"It's too late,\" Floop told the others. \"The Third Brain is linked not only to them, but to all the robot children, except for maybe Metal Atticus.\" \"Can't you remove it?\" Stacey asked. \"We can't just take 500 brains out!\" Floop cried out. \"Then just reprogram them.\" Metal Atticus said. \"That would take weeks!\" Floop replied. \"Just two words.\" Phineas said. \"A binary switch...\" Floop smiled. \"Of course. So, they would define right as wrong-\" \"And wrong as right.\" Cherry added. \"I'll handle the robot twins.\" Metal Atticus said. Cherry's hands soon twitched. \"I... I feel like I know what to do here...\" she then said. \"Move over.\" she then dashed over to the seat and sat down as she decided to help reprogram the robot kids. \"You sure you know what to do?\" Floop asked. \"It won't hurt to try...\" Cherry replied. \"I love computers.\" \"Okay.\" Floop said. \"Cherry, be careful.\" Atticus told his best friend. \"I will.\" Cherry replied. After typing a few keys, she was able to reprogram the robot kids. Back in the main room... \"Have a seat, Mr. Lisp...\" Bridget said.' \"You'll be comfortable here.\" Teresa added. Lisp soon sat in the seat. \"My army, Ms. Gradenko, is the only comfort I need.\" He told the girls. \"Of course it is.\" Teresa muttered. \"They're on their way now, sir.\" A squeaky voice said. \"Minion?\" Lisp looked up at him. \"What happened to your head?\" Minion was soon seen as he had three more heads as well as hands. \"Oh, don't worry,\" The now mutated man smirked innocently. \"I think it's reversible.\" \"I'm afraid not.\" Bridget smirked. Meanwhile... \"MOM! DAD!\" Carmen cried out as her parents were tied up and were being sent over the ceiling of that room. The robot doubles soon came before them. Metal Atticus soon came in front of Carmen and Juni to see if the reprogramming worked on the robot doubles . \"Careful,\" Juni warned. \"They're stronger and smarter now.\" \"Let me see, I am a robot after all.\" Metal Atticus replied. \"Okay.\" Carmen said. Metal Atticus came up to Juni and Carmen's doubles and stomped his foot forward. The robot doubles soon looked at each other before running. \"See?\" Metal Atticus smiled back to the others. \"Uh, dude?\" Atticus pointed ahead. The robot doubles ran up to the wall like ninjas before landing back on the floor which made the room shake slightly. \"Yeah, should have seen that coming.\" Metal Atticus said. Carmen and Juni soon faced each other's counterparts. \"No, you two stay back.\" Metal Atticus said. Carmen and Juni looked to him before they were then sent back while Metal Atticus stayed perfectly still. Metal Atticus soon handled the robot doubles. He narrowed his eyes which made them flash red as he meant serious business. \"Oh, shi-\" Cherry began nervously. \"Shh!\" Candace shushed her. Cherry continued to type on the computer to try to reverse the behavior in the robot kids. Metal Atticus soon slammed the robot doubles into the wall to keep them from leaving. Carmen and Juni's doubles glared. \"You're not hurting anyone anymore!\" Metal Atticus glared back at them. \"Traitor!\" Carmen-2 glared. \"Wannabe hasbeen.\" Metal Atticus glared back, his voice sounded deep and scary now all of the sudden. \"Calm down, just take a deep breath.\" Atticus said. \"What am I doing?\" Cherry cupped her eyes. \"I can't do anything right... I'm not my sister... No wonder she doesn't visit me often, she just joined the agency as an excuse and now we're all gonna die because of me!\" \"You can do this.\" Floop assured her. \"Ugh... Uh... Uh... Wah...\" Cherry struggled as she hit random keyboard buttons. She soon realized which keys to press. She took a deep breath and breathed out before soothing herself so she could work much more efficiently and confidentially. She soon pressed three keys. \"Oh, please work...\" she hoped. Carmen and Juni's robot doubles's eyes glowed and they soon looked calm and good-natured. Metal Atticus soon let them go. \"Are they good?\" Phineas asked. \"They're good,\" Metal Atticus confirmed. \"Cherry did it.\" \"I knew she could.\" Atticus smiled. \"Now we just have to find Mr. and Mrs. Cortez.\" Patch said as he stood with Perry. Perry nodded in agreement. Carmen-2 and Juni-2 decided to lead the way to where their real counterparts' parents were. \"Come on, we can trust them now.\" Metal Atticus told the others. \"Alright.\" Phineas said. They soon followed the robots and came to see that Gregorio and Ingrid looked like they were in trouble. \"Atticus!\" Bridget called out, she looked so happy to see her cousin again after so long. \"Bridget!\" Atticus smiled. \"Don't come any closer!\" Minion snapped. \"Bridget and Teresa belong to me now, they're going to be my slaves with their beauty.\" \"Never!\" Bridget and Teresa glared before joining the good side again. \"Ladies, we had a deal,\" Minion sneered. \"You'd stay on the bad side and your sister and cousin can live.\" \"Yeah, well, they're fine now!\" Teresa sneered right back at him. \"Which means, you have now willpower over us anymore!\" \"Oh, right...\" Minion frowned. Atticus broke the chains that the older girls were stuck in. Teresa soon ran toward Cherry and hugged her. \"Oh, Cherry, I was so worried...\" \"You were worried about me?\" Cherry asked her sister. \"Of course I was.\" Teresa said. \"You were using... My sister... As a slave?\" Cherry slowly approached minion with narrowing red eyes. \"Yeah, so what if I was?\" Minion scoffed. \"What're you gonna do, you're just a little girl.\" he then shoved her back like she was nothing. Cherry fell down and she thought back to those times Drell pushed her down in training. 'Come on, fight me!' Drell told her as he had knocked her down and Skippy restrained Atticus from getting back at him since this was a test of Cherry's independence of self defense. 'I-I can't!' Cherry frowned to the warlock. 'You claim you're tough, but you just let people walk over you and make Atticus sacrifice himself for you!' Drell mocked Cherry until she would stand up for herself. 'Stop mocking me.' Cherry said as she was about to get up. 'What're you gonna do about it?' Drell asked before he magicked up a cookie that Cherry liked. 'Hey, you want a cookie?' he held it out before holding it up out of her reach. 'DENIED!' he then did it again. 'No, seriously, you want it? DENIED!\" he then laughed loudly as he made fun of her and her low self-esteem. Cherry soon lunged out at him. Drell yelped and fell flat on the floor. \"GIVE ME THAT COOKIE OR I'LL BITE YOUR STUPID FACE OFF!\"' Cherry glared. 'Okay, okay, here, just take it!' Drell panicked as her fangs were coming out and her eyes were blood red. And where this memory helped Cherry remember to stand up for herself. Cherry narrowed her eyes. \"You're just gonna let people walk all over ya,\" Minion shoved Cherry. \"You always need someone else to-\" \"Don't... Touch... ME! \" Cherry roared and her eyes flashed while her fangs popped out and her hair grew wild. \"Cherry looks like Super Sayian.\" Atticus chuckled, though not in a teasing way as he was really proud of his best friend for growing some backbone. Minion began to look scared of Cherry. Cherry snarled and lunged out toward Minion and tackled him. \"Yikes!\" Minion gulped. Cherry snarled and looked rather vicious. \"I will NEVER forgive you for the things you have done to MY sister!\" Drell soon gulped. \"Get off of me!\" Minion begged nervously. Cherry soon grabbed Minion and flung him against the wall with unholy strength that many vampires acquired. \"Oh, my...\" Drell gulped. Minion groaned and his eyes widened. Cherry scowled as she charged toward him and began to roughly wrestle him with no mercy. \"Whoa.\" Patch said. \"Stop, stop, please, I'll surrender!\" Minion cried out as Cherry lifted him high over her head about to throw him into the water surrounding the castle as there were sharks who looked hungry. \"Promise?\" Cherry smirked. \"I promise! I promise! Now let me go!\" Minion begged. \"Hmm...\" Cherry soon held him by his ankle, dangling him and playfully retracted her fingers to let him slip and fall into the shark-infested waters. \"And I promise never to do anything evil ever again!\" Minion told her. \"Hmm...\" Cherry still smirked. Minion then yelped as he fell when she let go only for her to grab him again and he still screamed until he saw that she had him and she then tossed him over his shoulder. \"Thanks, Open Season.\" Cherry muttered as she had learned that trick from a certain kids' movie. \"Wow, that was smart.\" Drell said. Cherry soon settled down and melted herself back to normal. \"You do that to me, I'll knock you into next century.\" Drell warned her. \"You wanna try?\" Cherry got in his face. \"Never mind.\" Drell gulped. Cherry soon came toward Atticus. \"Cherry, that was awesome!\" Atticus beamed. \"You went all Super Sayian on that clown!\" \"Thanks.\" Cherry said. Gregorio and Ingrid were smiling and praising their children as they had saved their lives. Soon enough, Izzy came bursting in through a window. \"Isador.\" Gregorio looked shocked to see his brother after all these years. \"Hello, little brother.\" Izzy replied. All of the rest of the robot kids came in as they started to fling Minion, Lisp, and his men up and down having fun. Cherry smirked as she stood beside Atticus and the others. \"Way to go, Cherry.\" Atticus smiled since his best friend was able to make this happen with the robot kids doing opposite of what Minion had wanted now. \"No problem.\" Cherry said. \"Cherry, I'm actually impressed...\" Drell commented. \"Maybe I'm a little harsh on you.\" \"A little?\" Cherry asked. \"Okay, a lot...\" Drell admitted. \"Well, I guess I should thank you,\" Cherry replied. \"You're right, Atticus isn't going to be with me forever and I need to learn self-defense.\" \"So, what now?\" Phineas asked. \"I say we lock Minion in Merlin's dungeon for 500 years,\" Drell smirked before looking to the others. \"Oh, Merlin was a wizard in King Arthur's time-\" \"We know.\" Cherry and Atticus cut him off. \"Aha, but did ya know that he's Zelda's ex?\" Drell smirked. \"What?\" Atticus asked. \"I'll tell ya later...\" Drell replied before looking to Izzy. \"So, Isador, you have any ideas for Minion here for kidnapping and tormenting your brother and sister-in-law.\" \"I may have a few ideas.\" Izzy growled even though he promised firmly that he wouldn't help Gregorio. \"Ooh.\" Drell smirked.[Chapter 13] Soon enough, Carmen and Juni were new secret agents with their parents and would have more adventures after this one, but those were stories for another day. Everyone could now go back home and soon enough, everything was on the news, but most important information was kept a secret, such as Carmen an Juni being some of the spies. No, they were more than that, they were Spy Kids, and Phineas and Ferb were able to join them along with Candace, Jeremy, and Stacey. Izzy and Gregorio also soon made up and they became friends again and Floop was back on TV much to the delight of many young boys and girls. \"Whew!\" Drell collapsed into his chair. \"That took longer than I thought it would... Skippy, make me a sandwich.\" Skippy soon made him a sandwich. \"That's a good boy,\" Drell replied as he took the sandwich. \"Were you all right on your own?\" Skippy flexed his arm with a smirk. \"Ha, ha, very funny...\" Drell rolled his eyes with a smirk back. Skippy soon brought out Drell's weights. Drell ate his sandwich and when he finished, he stood over them. Skippy pouted and whimpered quietly like a poor puppy dog. \"What?\" Drell asked. Skippy wanted to keep his strength for a little bit longer and smirked. \"You're sick in the head if you think I'm gonna let you be stronger than me!\" Drell glared. Skippy began to go into a pleading position. Drell looked away, but every where he turned, Skippy kept giving him that look in his eyes. \" ALL RIGHT! \" he then yelled out of annoyance. \"God, you were normal a week ago!\" Skippy was happy to hear that he could keep his strength. \"But not for long...\" Drell soon smirked. Skippy snapped his fingers in defeat, but folded his arms, but at least he got to keep it for a little bit longer. Angela soon came to see Skippy for a change which made both men wave to her and she held out a bundle wrapped in a blanket. Skippy unwrapped the blanket and gasped as he saw that it was a gargoyle egg. \"An egg?\" Drell asked. \"Yes, an egg,\" Angela nodded. \"Skippy, you are going to be a father.\" Skippy held out the egg to Drell. Drell took the egg and it allowed Skippy to faint into Angela's arms. \"Yeah, of course that was going to happen.\" Drell said. \"What're you saying?\" Angela asked. \"Oh, nuthin',\" Drell replied innocently. \"It's just that since I sent Cherry and Atticus to meet you and the other Manhattan Clan, you guys have been having school kid crushes on each other.\" \"Maybe.\" Angela said. \"Don't you maybe me, I know you...\" Drell replied. \"I don't know what you see in him, he can't even talk!\" \"Yes, but I can read his thoughts due to my love for him.\" Angela smiled. \"Oh...\" Drell said. \"Silly warlock.\" Angela teased, poking his nose. A while later, it was time for everyone to go home. \"We saved the day again, Mum...\" Bridget sighed as she stared out the window and looked up at the night sky. \"Mum, wherever you are, I hope you're happy, because I'm happy to be here... With Perry, Phineas, Ferb, Dad, Candace, and even though Linda is not my biological mother, I love her too.\" They all soon arrived back at their homes. \"Well, we're on the news.\" Cherry said as she had her laptop while sitting beside Atticus. \"Was there ever any doubt?\" Atticus chuckled. \"No, I guess not...\" Cherry said, but then got an email from Mo and clicked into it before speed-reading it. \"Well, looks like Mo will be back home tomorrow.\" \"Wahoo!\" Atticus cheered. \"Yeah, I knew that'd make your day even better.\" Cherry smirked. \"And you were right.\" Atticus smiled. \"Well, that's enough excitement for one day...\" Cherry said. \"I guess we'll just relax for the rest of the day.\" \"Yeah,\" Atticus smiled before he saw his Equestrian medallion vibrating. \"Huh?\" Uh-oh, looks like Atticus is being called away to Equestria, we'll have to find out what the Cutie Mark Map wants him for and who else it called.

Author's Notes: Hey all! This chapter is short, but sweet! Special thanks to Amber, Jo, BillyCrazy, WhatTheF, Hannah, Moki…EVERYONE who has stuck with me! You all make me write better! I LOVE YOU ALL! Last, but not least…many thanks to Sue and Tom! Amber…this chapter is for you! 20 August, 1940 I awoke to the now familiar sounds of El Rancho Vida Nu. The sun was already up in the sky and assuredly, the ranch hands have been up for hours doing their chores. I arose from my bed and walked to the window. Opening the shutters, I smelled the scent of rain, noticing the black clouds on the horizon. This sort of weather was typical for this time of year. As certainly as the night held a chill, midday would be humid and hot. The mornings were indeed, my favorite part of the day. I went to my wardrobe and dressed accordingly for my day's planned events. Cole promised to take me to see Blazer's Mill, where Richard Brewer was killed. I marveled the fact that Cole offered to take me to these places, even though he worked on the ranch full time. He looked a lot like Aunt Jessica, obviously, being her grandson and yet he was tall, with dark hair and blue eyes. I adorned my new cowboy boots that Aunt Jessica bought for me, and followed the aroma of bacon cooking and the scent of fresh coffee into the kitchen. Seated around the Spanish style kitchen were Aunt Jessica, Chavez and Cole. We greeted each other, and I sat down, in between my Aunt and Chavez. \"So!\" Aunt Jessica smiled at me. \"What's on your agenda for today?\" \"Cole's taking me to see Blazer's Mill.\" I answered. Aunt Jessica stood up abruptly. \"Why would you want to see that ghastly place?\" She inquired. \"Research...remember, Aunt Jessica?\" I wondered why she was so upset. I noticed that Chavez just sipped at his coffee. Cole just sat there, staring at his plate of huevos rancheros. \"Oh, yes…your book.\" She gave a little laugh, putting down her coffee cup. \"Aunt Jessica…you must realize that you are quite the celebrity, and you life is anything but ordinary.\" She just laughed, shaking her head. \"Celebrity…Ha! I'm a humble cattle rancher. That's all I ever wanted to be…and that's all I am.\" \"Humble?\" Chavez questioned; a huge smile on his face. Aunt Jessica glared at Chavez. \"Drink your damn coffee!\" She hissed, over our laughter. I must have touched a nerve; I could feel the tension in the room. Aunt Jessica quickly dismissed the idea, as if she was reading my mind. \"Well… my plans are taking me into Roswell today. I have a few cattle purchases to oversee, and a few errands to run.\" She looked over at Cole. \"We're expecting some severe weather here later today. I suggest you be back before the monsoon.\" \"No need to worry, Grandma.\" He stated with a mouthful of eggs. \"I'll take care of her.\" Aunt Jessica closed her eyes, and took a step over to Cole. She suddenly smacked him in the back of the head. The eggs from his mouth were suddenly all over the table. \"What did I tell you about calling me Grandma?\" Chavez chuckled. \"At least he didn't call you the Sweetheart Shooter!\" Aunt Jessica swore loudly. \"Well…I better finish getting ready.\" She dismissed us with a sour expression, as the three of us were laughing. Our laughter died, and the mood of the room turned solemn. I turned to Chavez. \"What exactly happened at Blazer's Mill?\" Chavez was quiet for a moment, as if he was pondering my question. \"Well, Bonita…that was a very long time ago. You have to remember that Jessica was only sixteen…her Father was just recently murdered. We all lost a very good friend that day.\" \"Richard Brewer.\" I murmured. Chavez sipped his coffee. \"Well…you know what happened. We went to Blazer's Mill to eat and rest… but what most people don't know…is that Dick was betrothed to Jessica by her Father.\" \" WHAT! \" I gasped, almost choking on my eggs. \"Grandma never mentioned that!\" Cole exclaimed, staring at Chavez. Chavez continued to sip his coffee, and he looked Cole in the eye. \"Well, its true, Chivato. I believe Dick really loved Jessica…he would of made a great husband for her. But that bastard Buckshot Roberts set her on the path that changed her life forever.\" I didn't know what to say. I looked over at Cole, and he looked as surprised as I felt. Chavez continued, \"Not only did Buckshot Roberts kill Dick Brewer that day…but he killed a little bit of everyone…including Jessica. She was shot in the chest, and we all thought her dead.\" Chavez paused, as if he was reliving a difficult moment in his life. \"Up to that point, we all thought of this as a game. All of us quite children, playing at being heroes. That quickly changed. Dick was trying to convince Billy to dispose of Roberts once and for all. They argued back and forth. It was Jessica who ended the bickering by making a stand when no one else would.\" I could feel my heart swell with pride, as new felt admiration flooded my very being; upon hearing of Aunt Jessica's deeds. \"A bullet struck her in the chest, and should have ended her life. If it hadn't been for the badge that Billy had given her, to make her feel like one of the Regulators…she would be dead. At that moment, Dick knew it had to end, and it had to be him to stop the insanity. But alas…it was Dick's turn to ride the Spirit Horse.\" I noticed a tear well up in Chavez's eye, as he took a deep breath and continued. \"A good man never questions his fate…and neither does a good woman. For it was Jessica's destiny to rid the world of Buckshot Roberts. That is exactly what she did that day…something none of the other Regulators could do... for it was not written for us to do so….but for her.\" There was a pause in the conversation. It was something I have grown accustomed to when conversing with Chavez. He is, indeed, a man of very few words. When he decides to grace you with some of his pearls of wisdom, you had better give him one hundred percent of your attention. Aunt Jessica suddenly burst into the room. Her eyes were filled with tears as she looked at all of us, as she headed for the Philco radio perched at the edge of the kitchen counter. Chavez was out of his chair and over to her in two strides. \"What is it?\" He asked. \" Bloody fucking hell! \" She shouted, startling all of us, as she fiddled with the radio. \" Hitler and his damned Nazis have bombed London! \" What did she just say? The voice coming over the airwaves was very familiar to me. For the last year, I have been listening to Mr. Churchill, the Prime Minister, as he guided Brittan through the War against Germany. He was already involved in his speech, as we all listened in. \"… As they are being turned, to that arts of war, we may be able to show the enemy quite a lot of things that they have not thought of yet. Since the Germans drove the Jews out and lowered their technical standards, our science is definitely ahead of theirs. Our geographical position, the command of the sea, and the friendship of the United States enable us to draw resources from the whole world and to manufacture weapons of war of every kind, but especially of the superfine kinds, on a scale hitherto practiced only by Nazi Germany.\" As I listened to Mr. Churchill's words, a flurry of emotions blazed up inside me. I was worried for my family. Will they be all right? Are they in harm's way? I tried to quell my emotions as I listened on. \" Hitler is now sprawled over Europe. Out offensive springs are being slowly compressed and we must resolutely and methodically prepare ourselves for the campaigns of 1941 and 1942. Two or three years are not a long time, even in our short, precarious lives. They are nothing in the history of the nation, and when we are doing the finest thing in the world, and have the honor to be the sole champion of the liberties of all Europe, we must nor grudge these years of weary as we toil and struggle through them. It does not follow that our energies in future years will be exclusively confined to defending ourselves and our possessions.\" I looked over at Aunt Jessica. She looked older…even frail. Chavez supported my Aunt Jessica as she wept. I could feel my face turning red with anger. Those barbarians! As long as I shall live, I will never understand the methodology of war. \" Many opportunities may lie open to amphibious power, and we must be ready to take advantage of them. One of the ways to bring this war to a speedy end is to convince the enemy, not by words, but by deeds, that we have both the will and the means, not only to go on indefinitely, but to strike heavy and unexpected blows. The road to victory may not be so long as we expect. But we have no right to count upon this. Be it long or short, rough or smooth, we mean to reach our journey's end.\" At that, Aunt Jessica turned off the radio, and looked at me. Her tear stained face echoed the worry in her voice. \"Aubrey, you dare not go back home to that chaos. We'll make every effort to get word regarding your parents well being.\" I stood, as she walked over to embrace me. Her comforting embrace renewed my strength. \"This too, shall pass.\" She whispered into my ear, as my tears fell onto her shoulder. Well? What do you think?

She, Jessie, Chavez and Cole attend an auction in Roswell, when Jessie suffers a major heart attack! Author Notes: Hello again folks! I have uploaded a few chapters of 'Promises and Dreams' because I had the year wrong in some of Jessie's journals. The very first entry was supposed to begin December 31, 1877, not December 31, 1878! I never claimed to be perfect! My bad! Special thanks to Tom and Sue! What would I do without you both? (To let all of you know…when Sue beta-read this chapter…she wrote 'DIE')! 30 October, 1940[Chapter 5] Chapter Five- Feliz Navidad Hell Bent for Leather By EmiliosLoofah (tk421beth) Chapter Summary: In the last chapter, Jessie had given Aubrey all of her diaries from 1878 forward. With Jessica's blessings and help, 'Promises and Dreams', Jessie's story had been published, much to their delight. Cole had gone to England, to help with the Royal Air Force in the European War efforts…and to be closer to Kathryn Peppin, his fiancée. Aubrey has just begun working on the next book of Jessie's life…after the Lincoln County War ended. Authors Notes: Hey, guys! Sorry this took so long! Thanks so much for sticking with me! Special thanks to Tom and Sue! God! This was the most difficult chapter written so far! 7 December 1941 The day's events were slowly coming into focus. There was a festive feeling throughout the ranch, as the staff was preparing for the holidays, getting ready to deck the halls. Hanging wreaths, stringing holly, mistletoe, and the sound of holiday cheer filled the house. Aunt Jessica had told us the night before that she would get an early start and ride out to the foothills of the Capitan's, to scout a festive enough pine to adorn the living room. In her younger years, Aunt Jessica had made it a custom to take a hatchet and personally cut a tree down, and haul it back to the ranch herself. She had planned to the same this year, but Chavez and I convinced her otherwise. Chavez finished his coffee, as I walked into the kitchen. \"She has about a two hour lead on us.\" He told me, looking down at his watch. \"I think that's plenty enough time to find a damn tree.\" I chuckled and thought it was amusing how Chavez hid his concern in regards to my Aunt with mock anger. The plan was to take the Willy's out to where the road ended up in the Capitan's. We were to meet Aunt Jessica there, so she could show us which tree she had picked out. Carlos came into the kitchen and announced the jeep was ready to go. We headed out, with Carlos behind the wheel, wishing every passerby 'Feliz Navidad!' It was so like him to do this…he always has a smile on his face that seemed to be contagious. As we turned out onto the paved road, traffic seemed somewhat heavy eastbound towards Roswell. I looked at Chavez in question, but he only gave me a small shrug. Carlos laughed out loud. \"Don't these loco people realize that there are seventeen more shopping days until Christmas?\" We all laughed together as we drove towards Lincoln. The day was cold and there was the scent of snow in the air. Surely, in the higher elevation, there would be acumination. I buttoned my jacket, as we climbed higher into the Capitan Mountains. After what seemed like an eternity in the canvas roofed jeep, our temperatures were low, but our spirits high. I tried to spur my companions into singing another round of 'Here We Come a Wassailing' as the paved road ended. The snow began to fall, and that egged us on to sing a rousing bout of 'Jingle Bells'. Carlos and I were singing whole-heartily, when Chavez spied Jessica's horse galloping towards us in the snow. \"That's Pal!\" He shouted. Carlos slammed on the brakes so hard; the vehicle skidded to an abrupt stop. Chavez jumped out of the jeep as nimbly as an eighty year old man could. \"Eh…that stubborn Bonita!\" I could hear him mutter to himself. With his arms spread out, Chavez tried to corral Pal, and calm him with his gentle voice. \"Whoa…whoa, Pal.\" Aunt Jessica's horse came to a halt in front of Chavez, as he grabbed the reins. Without a word, he slipped his foot into the stirrup, and mounted him. Chavez turned the animal around, and spurred the creature up the path it had come from. Carlos stared, his mouth hanging open with shock and amazement at Chavez's galloped away. I slapped Carlos on the shoulder. \"Follow him!\" I shouted, as Carlos snapped his mouth closed, and stepped on the gas petal. Not too far away, we pulled up to an open clearing. Aunt Jessica was lying on the ground, and Chavez was hovering over her. I flew out of the jeep, and was quickly at Chavez's side. \"What happened?\" I gasped, as I surveyed her surroundings. She lay underneath the very tree that she was trying to chop down. I pulled the hatchet from her hand, feeling for her pulse. It was slight, much to my relief. \"Carlos! Grab a blanket!\" I shouted, taking off my coat, and placing it under her head. Aunt Jessica was unconscious, but alive. The snow was still falling and I was afraid that hyperthermia had already set in. We carried her back to the jeep, and all got in. It was a tight squeeze but we all managed to make Aunt Jessica as comfortable as possible. Chavez cradled her in his arms and silently wept at Carlos sped to the hospital in Roswell. Tears formed in my eyes, as a million things raced through my mind at once. \"We must keep her warm as possible.\" I keep on repeating. Twenty minutes into our mad dash to Roswell, Aunt Jessica regained conciseness. She slowly moved her hand to caress Chavez's face. \"You are the second regulator I have seen today.\" Chavez forced a smile, in spite of the tears that freely rolled down his cheeks. I watched as Aunt Jessica looked in to his eyes. \"Do not weep for me my friend. It is now my time and you have fulfilled all pledges that you have made with my father, or any other man. You have been more then a friend to me, you have been my protector…mi Corazon…a true pal.\" Chavez took a deep breath as if to speak. But Aunt Jessica placed a finger over his lips. \"It's Billy's turn to take care of me now...just like he always promised.\" She whispered. And with that, she turned to me and smiled. \"It's up to you to let the truth be known. I'm placing this burden on you, Aubrey.\" I grabbed her hand, and felt the cold chill in her grasp. \"I will Aunt Jessica. I will let the world know.\" She smiled bravely at me, but I could feel the strength leave her grasp. Aunt Jessica closed her eyes, and then she was gone. We drove back to the ranch, with Chavez still cradling Aunt Jessica's body as he chanted something in Navajo. My very being ached...I felt as if I where viewing the last hour of my life on a movie screen. I was merely a spectator of some awful piece of rubbish that was intended to squeeze your soul. My eyes where red and swollen, and the lump in my throat threatened to choke me outright. Carlos navigated the vehicle up the drive and stopped in front of the hacienda. I hadn't noticed on the way in, but now I realized that there was a lot of activity about. I turned my head to see Javier, Carlos's younger brother, running up to meet us. He seemed very disturbed. How could he know? Before anyone could say anything to Javier, he was in front of the jeep, speaking rapid Spanish and English all at once to his older brother. It was impossible to understand him. \"What the hell's wrong with you, Javier? Just spit it out!\" Carlos roared at him. \"Those goddamn Japs bombed Pearl Harbor… WE ARE AT WAR! \" Javier finally shouted. My mind decided that this was way too much information to process at one time. The only thing I can think at this point is how we can get Cole back in time for the funeral. Right then, my internal defense mechanisms took over and immediately shut down my thought process. I climbed out of the jeep and slowly felt myself grow heavy, and collapsed to the ground. Okay...please excuse the derogatory term listed above in regards to the Japanese. Now remember, back in the days of WWII, a lot of people in America were prejudiced against them, because of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Thank you for understanding. Liked it? Hated it? Please remember to review! I heart reviews! Thanks![Chapter 6] Chapter Six…Welcome Back OR Maxwell's House…Good to the Last Drop!

(It was July 22!) Chapter Summary: It is Christmas 1878…Billy, Charlie and Jessie have been staying with the Maxwell's for a little while… 25 December, 1878[Chapter 10] Chapter Ten The Arrival of Arkansas Dave Hell Bent for Leather By EmiliosLoofah (otherwise known as tk421beth) Author's Notes: There is a little part in here where I wrote that Jessie likes chewing gum. I have to tell ya…they DID have chewing gum back in the 1800's! Cool, huh? Now, if there were computers, television, Marie Claire magazine, Burger King and the internet, I could live back then no problemo! Also, did you know that Arkansas Dave was really called Dirty Dave Rudabaugh? Here's some history: Here's a little tidbit on him: On February 18 1886 Dave was involved in a gunfight with locals in the Mexican town of Parral. The fight began over a card game. Dave drew his pistol and killed two men and wounded another. He left the saloon unharmed but, unable to find his horse, re-entered a few moments later, which turned out to be a fatal mistake. He was shot several times from the shadows, and then was decapitated with a machete and his head was placed on a pole! Dave Rudabaugh is best known from the movie Young Guns II in which he was played by Christian Slater . In the movie the character is known as \"Arkansas Dave\" though the historical Rudabaugh never used this name. Chapter Summary: Billy had given Jessie a horse for Christmas! (Awww! LMAO!). New Year's and Jessie's seventeenth birthday have come and gone.[Chapter 11] ChapterrnEleven...Tunstall and Garrett Hell Bent forrnLeather By EmiliosLoofahrn(otherwise known as tk421beth) Author's Notes:rnDid you know that Tom O'Folliard was involved in the Lincoln CountyrnWar?

Jessie and Pat Garrett miss the chance to follow Billy and the others, and end up at the Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation, to hide out. Special thanks to Sue, my beta! Thanks for your help!!! January 26-27, 1879 I woke up several times throughout the night, it was so cold, and it made my bones ache. I lay there, shivering as I hear the night owls hooting softly. I glanced over at the fire, surprised to see that it was going out. I got up, and trying not to wake Garrett; I stroked the fire a little bit, trying to make it warmer in the teepee. It wasn't working that well. I looked over at Garrett, who was sleeping soundly under the buffalo hide. I folded my arms and snorted, wanting to kick him!!! How could he sleep so soundly while I was freezing? \"Tunstall?\" Garrett whispered, as he turned his head towards me. I gasped with surprise. I guess he's not a deep sleeper. \"Yes?\" \"Are you alright?\" He looked concerned, and sat up. \"What are you doing up?\" \"I was trying to get the fire going…I'm…cold.\" I told him, my arms still folded, trying to keep warm. \"Come here.\" I could see him smile from the light of the fire. \"Why?\" The tone in his voice made me nervous. \"I won't bite…unless you want me to.\" He teased, smiling up at me. Seeing that I was still standing there, he sighed. \"We can keep each other warm. That elk hide isn't enough to keep anyone warm this cold winter night.\" He uncovered himself with the buffalo hide, waiting for me to join him. I bit my lip as I looked down at him. What could it hurt? \"Bloody hell.\" I cursed, giving in as I got on my knees and crawled next to him. I lay down and turned away from him, as he covered us up. The buffalo hide was without doubt a lot warmer! Suddenly, Garrett's arm reached out, and he gently griped my waist, pulling me closer to him. \"Garrett!\" I shouted, as I felt his beard on the back of my neck. \"What are you doing ?\" \"We need to keep warm, Tunstall. Now hush and go to sleep!\" He whispered into my ear, as he snuggled close to me. I could feel his breath against my hair. I closed my eyes, not feeling cold anymore. Garrett's body heat along with the buffalo hide worked very well. The bullet struck Murphy in the center of his forehead. I lowered the rifle and watched Murphy drop to the ground. The single bullet that struck Murphy seemed to be like the same blow on the fragile wall that held back a sea of emotion; seeing this man that erected this wall crumble to the ground mirrored its demise.[Chapter 13] Chapter Thirteen…Hang 'Em High, Hang 'Em Low…Just Hang 'Em!! Hell Bent for Leather By EmiliosLoofah Author's Notes: Okay…it seems that I screwed up some dates here. I will start this chapter in March 1879. I know…the last chapter ended at the end of January 1879, but I don't care! I'm trying to keep everything in 'date' order as good as I can. Sorry for the mix-up! Also…a shotgun is also called a 'scatter'…I use both words in my fan fic. A shotgun is a weapon that you have to re-load every time you use it. Now, a rifle, not unlike Jessie's 30-30, can shoot multiple rounds. YEE-HAW!!! Chapter Summary: Jessie and Pat Garrett arrived in White Oaks, to find out that Chavez and Doc have been arrested and taken to Lincoln. Billy, they find out has also been arrested. Special thanks to Sue, my friend, my beta, the woman that totally helps me out with this story!! Thanks so much!! You make me a better writer, girl!! What in the hell would I do without you?!? Mid March, 1879[Chapter 14] Chapter Fourteen…The Mexican Blackbird Hell Bent for Leather By EmiliosLoofah Author's Notes: Okay folks…we need to get back to Aubrey, Chavez and Cole. Don't worry…the 1880's will quickly return!!! Chapter Summary: Chavez and Doc are saved from the Lincoln pit jail! You've missed them, haven't you?!?! As for the 1940's…America had just joined WWII, and Cole Special thanks to Tom…thanks for helping me once again. And of course Sue! My friend, my beta! This chapter took me a long time to complete…this is dedicated to Sue and my dear friend, Janice Gunther, who is no longer with us. Janice…you will be missed!!! December 20, 1941 The hospital lounge was a buzz with conversation; several different groups of bandaged and other wise broken military personal where engaged in a plethora of activities. Some where playing cards, others were reading, but the majority where occupied with hearing each others war stories. Although no one wore their uniform, most every man in the room sported a remnant to identify his branch of service. In the far corner, three Royal Marines sat wide eyed as a Captain William Benjamin of the Royal Air Force told his tail of heroism and bravery. \"I tell you blokes, I have never seen any one fly like that cowboy in my life. We got our orders; we were to baby-sit some B-17's. They were making their way to drop a load of firecrackers on Gerry's front porch. We connected with the bombers about 200 miles from their target. I thought it was going to be all tea and crumpets. We were flying at 10,000 ft with plenty of cloud cover for over an hour without a care.\" Captain Benjamin took a deep breath and continued. \"We were about 50 miles from the drop zone when the first wave of Faulkers dropped on us; they pretty much ignored us and concentrated fire on the B-17's, the Cowboy instructed us to break away into two man teams and…how did he say?...Oh yeah...pick them bastards off like tics on a hound's ass…and that's just what we did.\" \"We lost two of our brothers that day, but not after 12 of the bastards crashed and burned. At last count the Cowboy was responsible for 7 of them kills.\" One Marine with a head bandage waved his hand, as if shooing away some pesky insects. \"You fly boys always tend to stretch the truth.\" The other young Marine beside him chuckled. \" I heard the Cowboy is a direct descendant of Billy the Kid!\" \"Billy the who ?\" \"You know…Billy the bloody Kid…from New Mexico! The Prince of Pistoleers himself!\" The Marine with the head bandage snorted, and turned his attentions back to William. \"Willy, are you telling tall tales? You know them Faulkers where Mitchershimts.\" The group erupted with laughter, as William turned to see Lieutenant Cole…also known as the Cowboy sitting in a wheelchair, with his left leg in a cast and his right eye sporting a patch, and his head bandaged up. \"God damn Cowboy…you look like bloody hell!\" \"Well I have to admit…I have felt better…can't wait to get home!\" He smiled. Cole had just received his orders that he was going home, due to the extent of his injuries. The same Marine behind William spoke up again. \"So…the Gerry's shot your boys down then.\" Cole just looked the man in the eye, and said nothing for a long time. William broke the silence. \"You need to learn some manners, you horse's arse!\" Cole grabbed William's arm. \"No…it's alright…we diverted ground fire so the big boys could drop their load. Intelligence missed the target by 50 kilometers. The B-17's have a larger fuel cell.\" Will interrupted. \"Any other pilot would have left those birds to fend for themselves.\" Cole continued. \"We flew wing support for as far as we could. I knew we didn't have enough fuel to make base, so we might as well take a few more buzzards down before we had to ditch. The package was delivered, and we cleared the way home for the big boys. We ditched about 50 kilometers before home.\" \"That's a knee-slapper.\" Will said as he looked at the young Marine. \"As you can see we got a little banged up,\" Cole said. \"But you'll be slapping leather with those Gerry's soon enough!\" \"Mail!\" A large uniformed man shouted, as he came into the room, with a bundle of envelopes in his hand. \"Here's a telegram from America, Cowboy…it looks rather important!\" Cole accepted the envelope, opened it and read the contents in silence. He closed his eyes for a moment…then slowly opened them with a heavy sigh. \"Oh, God!\" The sounds of Beethoven's Symphony #7 in A filled my room. The Larghetto , second movement was playing. How fitting at this somber time. Cole would soon arrive home from England, just in time for Aunt Jessica's funeral. It was rumored that even the President of the United States would make an appearance.[Chapter 15] Chapter Fifteen… Chapter Fifteen…What Doesn't Kill Us Makes Us Stronger Hell Bent for Leather By EmiliosLoofah Author's Notes: To my faithful readers...I know I've been taking forever, but this chapter was very difficult to write! I'm glad you've stuck with my stories and my long periods of absence!! Thank you all! (hugs)!! A wee bit o' history: New Mexico wasn't made a state of the Union until 1912! I'm sorry for taking sooooooo long to do this! I really need to get this done, no?! It's all completed in my head…now if I can just get it on Microsoft Word! Let's give a BIG hand to my beta, Sue!! YEE-HAW!! She's been bugging me to finish this story!! Chapter Summary: The last time we left off (so L-O-N-G ago)…Jessie managed to punch Arkansas Dave in the face (Ah! The thrill of victory!)…and Cole gets the telegram about Jessica's death in England…sniffs… \"What in the hell do you think you're doing?\" I looked across the table and stared into Doc's intense blue eyes. \"I don't know what you're-\" \" Bullshit! \" Doc shouted, interrupting me as he slammed his fist on the table. His half-empty bottle of whisky shook, and then rolled off the table with a loud smash! I sighed with frustration as I closed my eyes and sat back in the hard wood chair. \"These are not the kind words I had hoped to hear from you…\" I slowly opened my eyes and glared at him. \"…after busting you out of the Lincoln pit jail, Doc.\" Why was he so angry? Wasn't he happy to see me? Sitting beside Doc, Chavez chuckled. It was just the three of us in a small side room of Beaver's. Doc had asked for this meeting. Billy and everyone else were out eating, sleeping, or hopefully…taking a bath . \"Jessica…\" Doc took my hand in his. \"I'm sorry. I really am. I realize now that I should have taken you to New York with me.\" I sighed again, and let him continue. \"Why are you still with him, Jessica?\" \"You ask me this now? Did I have a choice in the matter? I'm wanted by the law-just like you and Chavez! Billy has kept all his promises to me…he wouldn't do anything to hurt me, and he protects me…I trust him with my whole heart, Doc.\" I looked at him and then Chavez. I can't believe I have to explain myself to Doc, of all people. \"You both left…and I do understand the reasons why. I had nowhere to go, nowhere to hide, no kin in America. If it wasn't for Billy…I'd be dead.\" Doc lit a cigarette and for several moments the three of us were silent. \"You think he's faithful to you, Jessica? Billy should have married you by now, but, I know this…he doesn't even love you…he loves himself, and that's all he'll ever love…himself.\" Doc glanced at Chavez for a moment, then back to me. \"I just don't want to see you get hurt.\" My throat went dry for a moment. Doc hurt my feelings more than he knew. All the women, no matter what age or race, just loved Billy. He is very popular with the female folk. There was nothing I could do about that…even those times I've been so jealous and wanted to kill Billy. \"Do you have proof of his… unfaithfulness ?\" I spat out the last word, crossing my arms in front of me. \"Well, no-\" \"Then cease to discuss this matter with me no more, Doc.\" Doc sighed, as the smoke from his cigarette slowly drifted my way. \"How did he convince Charlie to join the both of you?\" I grumbled a curse, wondering how to respond. Charlie joining us so soon after he just got married wasn't right, and it was still a sore subject between Billy and me. Billy has a talent-he can easily influence people to do what he wants. It's as simple as that. The best (and worst !) characteristic he has is charisma He could easily convince anyone to do practically anything he so desired. \"You know how Billy is.\" I shrugged…there was no need to put in plain words. I knew that Doc and Chavez understood what I was talking about. \"I sure do know how he is…\" Doc told me, his blue eyes serious. \"The question is…do you ?\" I glared at Doc once again. He made me so… aggravated ! Who in the hell was he to tell me these…fictitious lies? I just wasn't going to take it any longer. \"Damn you, Doc! You can go straight to bloody hell!\" It was my turn to slam my fist on the table. I will not take any more of Doc's abuse today. \"I am a child no longer…I consider myself emancipated, Doc…and have been so, since my Father was murdered by that bastard Murphy. What I do with my life is none of your concern anymore. Whatever pact you had with my Father concerning my welfare ceases to exist. Is that clear?!\" Doc looked stunned at my eruption. His mouth was open in shock, causing his lit cigarette to drop on the table. I glanced over at Chavez, who had cleared his throat. He seemed surprised by my outburst as well, but was his usual stoic self. \"I will always be responsible for your well being, Bonita . I made that oath long ago.\" I opened my mouth to reply, but Chavez quickly stood up, his dark brown eyes locked with mine. \"No. Be silent. Listen to me…both of you. Let's just focus on going to Old Mexico. It's our only chance.\" \"Alright.\" I agreed with Chavez. After all, he is right. If anyone, Billy could get us out of New Mexico alive. Doc frowned. I knew he didn't think it was the best of ideas…but what other choice did we have? A few minutes later Doc, Chavez and I joined Billy and the rest of the gang in the main room at Beaver's place. I sat a little ways away from the rest of the group, observing them all loading up, checking their weapons and such. I sighed, fingering the cold metal of my two pistols, and felt the heavy load of my scatter, and spare shells strapped to my back. Two knives were strapped to my thighs. I was more than ready. The only one not participating was Garrett…he sat near a window, his rifle on his knee, keeping watch. As if he felt I was looking over at him, he glanced my way, giving me a small grin. I grinned back at him. \"Where are all the boys you said you have? This army you've talked about, Billy.\" Doc asked. \"They're comin'.\" Billy told Doc as Jesus Silva walked in…with a tall white man behind him. Billy gets up, and looks behind the stranger. \"Hey, Jesus…just one…that's all you could find?\" \"No one want to come…afraid…\" He explained to Billy in broken English. Billy sat back down in his chair, looking a little defeated. I've never seen him look that way before. I suddenly felt panicky. I watched as Billy looked over at the tall man with great disappointment. Dave studied the stranger with interest. \"You a farmer?\" Dave asked the stranger. \"Yes sir.\" The tall man replied. \"My name is Hendry William French.\" \"Have you ever shot anyone before?\" Dave asks with a wiry grin. \"Hendry William French?\" He looked at Dave, and shook his head no. Dave snorts. \"Why is it that you want to ride with my gang?\" He inquires, taking his scatter, and checking it out. \"I ain't a farmer no more,\" Hendry explains. \"Lost my wife to the pox…lost my land soon after that.\" I glance over at Doc. He looks worried as he continues to pour powder into paper cartridges right quick. \"Hey, Big Casino,\" Billy grinned over at Garrett. I smiled to myself in regards to that term of endearment. Garret called Billy 'Little Casino' for some time now. \"Think you can take a foot off this one, huh?\" He asks, tossing Hendry's shotgun at him. \"You want a Peacemaker for back up? God did not create all men equal. Mr. Colt did.\" Garrett catches the gun, as we all chuckle at Billy's joke. \"I don't think I'm going to make this one, Kid.\" Garrett states. What was this? Garrett isn't coming with us ? My mouth dropped open with surprise. This was the last thing I ever thought Garrett would say. Billy glared at Garrett, trying to stare him down, which is impossible, since Billy is only five feet six…and Garrett towers over him at what, six-four? \"What do you mean?\" He asks Garrett, his tone dangerously low. \"You gotta come with us…what are you gonna do? Scrub pots for Beaver?\" \"I may have Beaver scrubs the pots for me…I'm buyin' this place.\" He smiles at Billy, and then glances in my direction. \"I'm turning it into an eatin' house. There's money coming into this place…I have to stake my claim while I have a good enough name.\" Billy snorts with amusement. \"You've been riding with known men, Patsy…you've always wanted to be a known man in New Mexico!\" He playfully punches Garrett in the arm. \"I will be a known man…hell, when you come riding through here next time; they'll be a sign, that'll say 'Garrett's Place'…\" Garrett sighs and gives Billy a serious look. \"It's high time I've earned an income that isn't from stealing horses.\" I watch the conversation between the two of them. I identified with Garrett's feelings on wanting to get out, and lead a 'normal' life. He wasn't a wanted man…yet. Give or take a few more weeks…months…and everyone would know Pat Garrett rides with Billy the Kid and his gang. \"You remember this,\" Billy said slowly. \"I've never stole a horse from a person that I've never liked. If I didn't like him, I wouldn't even bother with him.\" \"Yeah, you'd just kill him!\" Dave laughs, and after a moment, looks around and wonders why no one else is laughing. This situation is serious. What were we going to do without Garrett? We need him…especially now. Garrett gave me a small smile of farewell, as he walked towards the door. \"Now hold on a second, Patsy! You're one of us!\" Billy sounded hurt…and irate as well. You've always been one of us!\" Garrett paused for a moment, and then turned to look at Billy. \"And I always will be, Billy.\" With that, Garrett exited the building. \"Well, go on then!\" Billy shouted. \"We don't need you, Pat!\" Billy looks down at his feet for a moment. I hear him mutter, \"We don't need him.\" I glanced around to see everyone in a state of confusion. I couldn't let Garrett depart without saying goodbye. My head, along with my heart unexpectedly hurt. For reasons I didn't understand, I rushed out of Beaver's, hoping to catch Garrett before he leaves. I understand why he's leaving us…and I wished I could as well, and settle down. Settle down with Billy and live a happy life in New Mexico. Garrett was preparing his horse, when I ran outside. \"Garrett- WAIT! \" I shouted. He turned to look over at me, and then grinned as I walked over to him. \"What is it?\" \"I realize why you are leaving, Garrett,\" I slowly told him. \"I'm glad you're getting out, really I am.\" He laughed. \"Anxious to get rid of me, Tunstall?\" \"You know what I mean.\" I sighed. \"And Billy still cares for you, Garrett.\" \"Is that the only reason why you came out here…to tell me that Billy still cares for me?\" I just stood there, looking up at him. I knew exactly what he was talking about. \"Uh…\" I was at a loss for words. Garrett gently took my hands in his. His thumbs tenderly slid over my knuckles, causing goose bumps to spread over my body. \"I will miss you, Tunstall…more than you know. I will expect to see you coming through here every so often; with or without Billy…do you hear me?\" I nodded. \"Yes. Take care, Garrett. I will miss you.\" He smiled, and leaned down to kiss me on the cheek. I could feel my face turn red, and quickly went back into Beaver's Place, so Garrett couldn't see my red face. Walking in, I noticed Billy was gone, but that orphan, Tom was sitting at the table in between Chavez and Doc. \"What happened?\" I asked. \"What did I miss?\" \"Jessie…meet the Prince of Pennsylvania.\" Dave chuckled. I smiled at Tom. I took a quick look around the room to see Billy had departed. \"Where has Billy gone?\" I dunno.\" Charlie answered, looking a little troubled. I narrowed my eyes, wondering what was wrong. I glanced over at Chavez. His dark brown eyes told me that something was amiss. I quickly left without another word, in search for Billy. I checked everywhere for Billy, but he could not be found. I even checked the barn. I was worried about him-where could he be? God, what if Doc was right? Oh, no, Doc couldn't be right. I knew Billy. He was all play, and I knew he loved me as much as I loved him. I wandered into the Maxwell home, only to find Pete was gone. Maybe Billy had gone to Roswell with him. Turning to leave I heard a female giggle, along with a well known male chuckle I had so gotten used to. I slowly walked over to Paulita's wing of the house, hoping not to make any noise, and stood outside of her door. Waiting…waiting…oh Lord… \"God, Paulita…you feel so good…\" What? What was this? My Billy…with another woman? Oh my God…Paulita…my friend, Billy's friend…oh shit! I heard a roar inside my head…something that has never happened before. I closed my eyes, wishing the pounding in my head would stop. I then clamped my right hand over my mouth, in fear of screaming in disappointment…in lament…over my broken heart right here in the hallway. I felt like I was going to throw up, my stomach was in knots. Trying to calm myself down, I closed my eyes and held my fury in check for a moment…but for only a mere moment. I wanted to kill Billy…I wanted to kill Paulita !! Without a moment's hesitation, I grabbed my shotgun from my back, and with a roar, I kicked the door in, to see the two of them in bed together. \" Jessie! \" Billy shrieked in surprise…and then fear. \" Jessica! \" Paulita shouted, pulling the sheet up over her nudity. \" You God damn son of a bitch! You cheating bastard \" My shotgun was loaded, and I aimed for the bed. I looked over at Paulita, who was trembling with fright. \"You damn puta !!\" I screamed at her, calling her a whore in her native tongue. Paulita started to cry…probably out of fear that I would kill her, not because she was with Billy, I suspected. As for Billy… my Billy …he jumped off the bed, covering his front with a pillow, no knowing what to do at this moment. \"I loved you, Billy… loved you But now I know…you only care for yourself, you rotten bastard!\" I screamed at him. Damn Doc for being so precise in regards to this ! God, why didn't I know this before? Why was I so stupid? \"Now, Jessie…put down that scatter…\" Billy actually sounded frightened, trying to calm me down. I re-holstered my scatter on the case on my back. \" I'm done with you, Billy! \" I screamed, taking hold of the necklace and heart charm he bought me, and ripped it off my neck. I threw it at him with disgust. \"I don't ever want to see you again, you cheating asshole \" I turned away, and fled the house, before he could say or do anything else. I quickly ran to the barn and got Pal ready. \"We're out of here, Pal.\" I told him. Thankfully, Pal was ready to ride, I had the saddlebag packed before Garrett had left Beaver's place. Without letting anyone know I was leaving, I quickly mounted Pal, and rode out of Fort Sumner like a bat out of hell. Only when I was out of Fort Sumner, I let myself cry. Just outside Roswell, I ate a light supper at a small saloon, and was deciding what to do next. I really had nowhere to go. I never wanted to see Billy again, that much I knew. I wondered which direction Garrett had gone. I wasn't sure where he was going; he had never said anything about his plans to anyone. I wished I had asked him, I hated to ride alone, since I am a wanted person by the law. Fortunately for Garrett, he isn't a wanted man, and could go anywhere he so liked. Sighing, my heart still breaking over Billy, I kept my head down, and mounted Pal, thinking that I should get out of town, and head for the Mescalero Reservation once again, where I could be safe…from bounty hunters and Billy alike. Oh, God! I wish I had gotten Chavez, Doc or Charlie to come with me! For the first time I was truly alone. Riding out, I glanced down to stare at my silver ring…the only cherished item I had left that my Father had given to me. 'Happy 16, JMT, 01/01/78'. It seemed liked decades since I was sixteen. I loud BOOM! had snapped me back to reality. I was being chased…oh; this was a great way to end this awful day…I tried to grab my scatter, which was near impossible while Pal was in full gallop. Another shot rang out, as I had grabbed one of my pistols. Too late, I realized …the last shot had happened to hit Pal straight in the neck. With a deafening cry of pain, Pal started to fall, with me still on top of him. I screamed in terror as well, falling with my horse. Tears sprang into my eyes, as I hoped Pal would live through this, even though I knew deep down in my heart he was dying. His blood was all over me, as I quickly made sure my right leg was out of the saddle, so I wouldn't be crushed by Pal's weight…and as we landed on the ground, I jumped, landed on the ground…and turned to shoot my pistol at the bastard…or bastards that shot Pal. \"Hola, querida… .\" A deep voice from behind greeted me. Before I could do anything, I was hit in the back of the head, and the blackness swept over me… WooHoo! Cliffhanger! Don't ya'll hate me now? Bwa ha ha ha ha!! Don't worry-I'll get to the next chapter soon!! This will all make you laugh! After Sue read this, she told me: \"I believe that (about getting to the next chapter soon), like Jess believes Billy is a faithful S.O.B! Ha ha![Chapter 16] Chapter Sixteen-We All Go South Now and Again Hell Bent for Leather By EmiliosLoofah Author's Notes: This chapter is well…pretty heavy. Please read with caution! Chapter Summary: Well…Jessica caught Billy cheating on her…and without thinking, she took off on Pal, without telling anyone she was leaving. Pal is shot, causing Jessica to fall from her horse, and she gets hit on the back of the head, causing her to lapse into unconscious. The story continues… Extra Author Notes: Special thanks to Tom for extra help in this difficult chapter…and to my beta, Sue! You know…when she reads my story, she uses a red pen to correct me. I believe she was a frustrated teacher in a former life! Har!! The town of Lincoln in New Mexico was/is sometimes called Lincoln Town. I wanted to state that, in cause you thought I went nuts! Also-this chapter is pretty L-O-N-G!! The pounding in my head woke me from being out cold. Slowly opening my eyes…everything gradually came into focus. I tried to move my arms, but I found that my wrists were tied together over my head, attached to… oh, God ! I gasped with fright, fully aware that I was lying on Pal, who was lying on his side, barely alive. The ties that bound my wrists together were tied to my saddle horn. I looked down to see my gun belt was off, along with my chaps and all my knives. I gulped, wanting to panic, to scream…but I did neither. What good would it do? No one would hear me…I gathered that I was in the middle of nowhere. The sun beat down, and I gathered it was mid morning. I closed my eyes again, remembering the very reason why I left Fort Sumner. Damn that bloody Billy. I hope I never have to lay eyes on that low down cheating snake again . My mouth was dry and I desperately was in the need of water. Besides my head hurting, every muscle ached from sleeping in an awkward position. I softly groaned in discomfort, wondering where the bastard (or bastards) was that shot and killed Pal. \"Ah! You're awake, querida.\" I gulped with fear as I looked in front of me. There stood Dirty Sanchez, dirty and smelly as ever, with a wide grin on his ugly face. His yellowed teeth held a cheroot, and with an evil grin he blew the smoke in my face. I didn't say anything…just stared him down as best as I could. He squatted in front of me, roughly taking hold of my chin, forcing me to look up at him. \"That's right, querida …I have you now. I'm bringing you in for the reward.\" Sanchez told me, his tequila-coated breath almost made me vomit. \"Six hundred dollars…what do you say to that?\" His cheroot dangled from his fleshy lips. I didn't respond, as much as I would have liked to. I just stared at him. \"Puta!\" He shouted, slapping me across the face with all his strength. I closed my eyes, but refused to cry out in pain. I felt some blood ooze from my mouth, as Sanchez knelt in front of me; pressing his body tightly against me. \"Feel that, querida ?\" He laughed. Without a doubt, I did feel his member against me. \"Feel what? I hardly feel anything.\" I lied. I might as well give him a complex before he raped me...or even killed me. Sanchez looked very irate indeed. \"A bitch to the very end, no? Maybe I'll just kill you.\" He stated with a hiss, tossing his smoke to the ground, and pulling out a large knife. He held the tip to my throat. \"The authorities state they want you dead or alive…which shall it be?\" He pressed the knife deeper against the side of my throat and I could feel my own blood slide down my neck from the small cut he made. I laughed right in his face, wondering if I was mad. I didn't even care if he killed me or if Sanchez collected his reward. I no longer cared about anything . Billy's dishonesty ruined me. \"Do what you want…I don't care.\" Sanchez looked puzzled for a moment. His face concentrated on my last statement, I could tell it bothered him. Sanchez was a man that took his women kicking and screaming. I hoped I would not do either, perhaps that would put him off. His moment of silence soon passed, as he snorted, playing with his knife, twirling it around his fingers, trying to scare me, I supposed. All of a sudden, he grabbed the front of my shirt and sliced it open with his knife. My shirt fell apart in two pieces, exposing the white camisole I wore underneath-the only garment I wore under my shirt. \"You bloody bastard!\" I yelled, kicking him in the shin. I grinned as I heard him howl in pain. My grin was short lived, due to Sanchez grabbing my long, black hair. My head jerked back as I was forced to look in his eyes. \"You…fucking… puta . You'll pay for that.\" He shouted. I kicked and bucked against him, but to no avail. My bonds were securely tied. I could hardly fight him in this position. Sanchez laughed, as he threw his knife away, and then he reached out and ripped open my camisole with his hands. I screamed as loud as I could as his dirty hands roughly grabbed and squeezed my breasts. Fear knotted my stomach as I spit in his face. \"Don't touch me you asshole! \" I yelled, trying to squirm away from his touch. \" Shut up! \" Sanchez punched me in my lower jaw. I tasted blood as I blacked out for a moment; my vision blurred. Oh God…he's going to rape and kill me… His stinking breath made me gag. In a few moments he had my boots and trousers off. I lay there, naked and defeated. There was nothing I could do…no one was going to save me…no one knew where I was. I could feel Pal's breathing slowing. He gave a soft whinny of pain, trying to move his head. With a grunt, Sanchez stood up, and quickly dropped his gun belt, and threw aside his trousers. \"No one can hear you,\" He told me, as if reading my thoughts. \"No one is going to save you. Not even your dear Bilito.\" I closed my eyes, not wanting to see what was going to happen to me. Tears swelled in my eyes, but I refused to beg for mercy. As much as I hated Billy, I wish he was here. I felt him kneel in front of me, and opened my eyes. \"I've wanted you for a long time, querida… \" He laughed loudly, his body hovering over me. \"I want to make sure you are wet and ready for me.\" Sanchez said, lubricating two of his fingers with his tongue. I yelled in fear, as he spread my legs, and kept them open with his knees. Oh, God!! My flesh crawled as he roughly stuck his fingers inside of me, making me scream, making me kick against him- anything to make him stop. I spit right in his face, which infuriated Sanchez, as he slapped me in the face with one hand…his other hand was busy with his fingers probing inside me. Sanchez's fingers slid in and out of me, as I struggled to break free. As I was being violated, I could feel the last few breaths of Pal…in a few seconds he was dead. I then knew, after Dirty Sanchez was done with me…he'd kill me as well. Sanchez laughed; as if he knew Pal was gone along with my pride…he then suddenly bent down and bit my left nipple… hard . I shouted with pain, still struggling to free myself. His lips were suddenly on mine, his tongue trying to slide into my mouth. I opened my eyes, and looked at him with repulsion. He stopped what he was doing to give me an evil smile. Laughing, he squeezed my breasts hard enough to make my cry out in pain. The bastard was deliberately hurting me. \"Damn you to bloody hell, Dirty Sanchez… I damn you to HELL! \" I screamed. Unexpectedly, he stopped. I looked at him, surprised to see blood trickling down from a bullet-shaped hole his forehead. Someone shot him… Sanchez gurgled for a moment, unable to speak, as smoke drifted slowly away from the hole in his head. He then fell over on his back, dead. I opened my eyes, expecting to see Billy riding up to me. Squinting my eyes, I was surprised to see who was approaching. \"G…Garrett?\" I whispered in disbelief. Garrett rode up, a worried look on his face. In his hand he held is Winchester .44 caliber rifle. \"Garrett.\" I whispered in relief, as he quickly dismounted and cut the rope away that was holding my arms above my head. \"Garrett…\" I looked up at him, rubbing my sore, bleeding wrists, my tears now falling down my face. \"I'm here, Tunstall…it's alright.\" He told me, sitting in front of me. \"It's over.\" I cried against his chest, as he gathered me into his lap. Garrett let me cry out my pain, my hurt, my anger and my relief. After a long while, I was all cried out. \"Thank you.\" I told him. \"How…how did you find me?\" Garrett sighed, as if pondering my question. \"I didn't leave Fort Sumner as quickly as you thought, Tunstall.\" He said, looking into me eyes. \"I saw you ride out of there, hell bent for leather… I…followed you,\" He sighed. \"But I lost sight of you for a bit. I heard a gunshot…it echoed, and I knew something bad had happened…I tracked you…heard you screams…and found you here. I'm sorry that I didn't find you sooner.\" He lowered his eyes. \"I'm sorry I wasn't here sooner.\" I could tell Garret felt really bad, but I was so relived he was there, so I reassured him. I was thankful that he arrived when he did to save me. I would always be grateful to Garrett. I didn't say anything, even though I wondered why he followed me. He apparently didn't know the reason why I left in the first place. \"Let's get some clothes on you.\" He told me, helping me stand up. Garrett walked over to his horse and started looking through his saddle bags. \"I think I have an extra shirt in here somewhere.\" I quickly located my trousers, and pulled them on. I then found my chaps, gun belt, knives and my hat, which had seen better days. I slowly dressed my lower half, telling myself never to go riding on my own… ever . I tossed my now ruined chemise and shirt on the ground, and turned to see Garrett staring at me, a clean shirt in his hands. I supposed I looked a sight, completely dressed, minus a shirt, of all things. \"Thanks, Garrett.\" I told him, grabbing the shirt and putting it on. Of course, it was huge on me, so I tucked it in real good. \"I found your saddle bag.\" He stated, as he placed it on his ride. \"Are you ready?\" \"Wait…\" I slowly walked over to Pal, and petted his neck. Pal was a good horse to me. I wanted to bury him, but there was no way we could have dug a hole deep enough, and Garrett didn't have a shovel on him. We decided to burn Pal…it was the least I could do for him. I helped Garrett, gathering all the pieces of wood I could find in the area. Garrett struck a match, and quickly set the fire. We were silent for a few minutes, watching the funeral pyre of Pal. \"Tunstall…I think we should bring Dirty Sanchez in to the local Sheriff. There is a 400 bounty on him. We could use the money.\" \"I concur, Garrett. That's fine with me.\" Garrett tied Dirty Sanchez to his own horse. What a fitting ending to his miserable existence…to be led into the nearest town, so we could collect the reward money. \"We're about a thirty minutes away from Roswell.\" Garrett told me as he mounted his horse. He leaned down to offer me his hand. I took it, and he hoisted me in front of him. \"Let's get the hell out of here.\" Garrett said. I nodded my agreement. We rode west; the sun was getting ready to set. Even though Garrett gave me his extra canteen of water, I was still thirsty and in need of a long, hot bath. I wanted to scrub away the scent of Dirty Sanchez off of me. I was silent most of the ride, concentrating on Garrett's strong arms that were around me, as he held firmly on the reins of his horse. I had the strangest feeling in my belly as I felt the pressure of his strong legs against mine as we rode. I felt at ease and protected in his arms. I sighed, leaning back against him. I heard Garrett heave a sigh and mumble something under his breath as I leaned against him. I wondered again what compelled Garrett to follow me in the first place. \"I figure you'd like to stop at a hotel and wash up.\" Garrett told me, his lips very close to my ear. \"Where are we going?\" \"Lincoln Town.\" \"What?!\" I turned my head, realizing I was only inches from his face. \"Why in the bloody hell are we going there for?\" \"I have been requested to attend an important meeting. I'd like for you to come.\" \"A meeting…with whom I may ask?\" \"Governor Lew Wallace, John Chisum, District Attorn-\" \" WHAT?! \" I interrupted loudly. \"You heard me.\" He chuckled with amusement at my reaction. \"But why would they ask you for a meeting?\" \"I have no idea-but I'm going to find out.\" He smiled. \"And you're coming with me as well.\" \"You are mad , Garrett. I'm a wanted person. As soon as they see me…\" I laughed loudly, thinking Garrett was mad. \"They won't do anything, Tunstall.\" \"I guess I'll have to trust you?\" \"Damn straight.\" He said with all seriousness. \"Don't worry…we have a few days to relax before the meeting.\" Outside Roswell, Garrett stopped at the local jail, and handed them over the dead body of Dirty Sanchez. As I waited outside, they paid Garrett, and we were off again, and found a decent hotel. Again I waited with his horse as he went inside. \"They only had one room left.\" He told me, taking the saddle bags off his horse. \"That's okay.\" I told him, following him inside the hotel. I didn't care if we had to share the same bed. Hell, I didn't want to be alone tonight. We entered a small room, and Garrett tossed the saddle bags to the floor. \"I ordered you a bath. It should be up here soon.\" \"Thanks, Garrett.\" I grinned up at him. \"I'll be back soon.\" He told me, softly touching my face. \"You going to be alright?\" His brown eyes were full of anxiety. \"Yes.\" I smiled at my savior. \"I will be fine.\" He accepted that and with a grin, he left the room. Looking in my saddle bag, I found my medical supplies. Sitting at the only table in the room, I looked into the mirror. My face was a mess. I had cuts, bruises and blood on my face and neck. My wrists and hands were bloody and raw and they hurt the most. Glad to see a bar of soap and fresh water in the basin, I carefully cleaned my hands and wrists and after they were clean I also cleaned my face and neck. I used some witch hazel after my face was clean, hoping to get the swelling in my face down. The slightest pat on my face made me wince in pain, but I know in the long run, it will work wonders. I walked back over to the bed and rustling further in my saddle bag, I found my diary-one of the many I had since 1878. I sighed, and waiting for the bath to arrive, wrote an entry for today, pouring out my emotions, fears, and hope for the future. What future did I even have ? I wondered after I was done writing. I was wanted by the law and away from the Regulators for the first time since I could remember. A slight knock on the door signaled the arrival of the bath. I sighed with content as I sat in the hot tub, washing myself with the lavender soap the maid provided. The nasty scent of Dirty Sanchez was no longer lingering. I immediately relaxed, and felt a whole lot better. I sat in the tub full of hot water with plenty of bubbles, pondering what the Regulators were thinking about me leaving abruptly. Chavez and Doc will be worried, no doubt. Charlie would also be worried, but I believe he missed Manuela too much to be concerned about me. Dave wouldn't care-I was sure of that, which made me giggle. And Billy…God, I wonder what he's thinking right now. I hope he feels awful about what he did. I hope never to see him again, that bloody cheating bastard! I had to force myself to stop thinking about Billy-the mere thought of what he did to me made me all upset again. I sighed, and lowered my head into the fragrant bubbly soapy water, switching my thoughts towards Garrett. I know he's fancied me for some time, which is flattering to say the least. I've always had feelings for Garrett, but after today, after he saved my life…something changed. I could feel it…and my guess was he felt the same way. I came up for air, my long black hair clean and smelling like lavender. I loud rap on the door indicated Garrett was back. I shouted that he could come in, as I started to wring out the excess water from my hair. He came in with a smile on his face, his arms full of packages, and then he stopped dead in his tracks, seeing me in the middle of the room, still in the tub. Dropping some of the brown wrapped items he purchased, Garrett started to stutter. \"I…I thought you would be finished by now.\" He said, his face turning red. \"I apologize. I will leave.\" He turned to go. \"No…you're okay, Garrett. Stay…please. I don't want to be alone.\" This was true. His brown eyes were fixed on me in the tub. I was now laying back, my head propped up on a small folded towel. My body was hidden by millions of bubbles. That long, lingering look he gave me with his brown eyes made my heart beat faster…I know he wants me. I could feel it down to my bones. And the truth was…I wanted him that much as well. What would he do? I watched as Garrett picked up the packages he dropped and put them all on the bed. He sat at the edge of the bed, and picked up one of my diaries. \"What's this?\" He asked. \"You keep a journal?\" The moment had passed. Garrett was a true gentleman. \"Yes, since 1878.\" \"That's a long time, Tunstall.\" He said, taking his hat off and flipping my diary open. \"Hey!\" I protested. \"That's private!\" \"Oh, sorry,\" He chuckled, tossing the book back into my saddle bag. His eyes were once again on me. \"You face looks better.\" He said in surprise. \"Thanks.\" I said, touching the side of my jaw where Dirty Sanchez punched me. It still stung a tiny bit. \"Witch hazel really helps.\" \"Tunstall…I need to know. What happened back in Fort Sumner?\" Garrett asked, walking over to the tub, and kneeled beside me. \"What made you leave in such a hurry?\" I sighed. \"It was Billy. I…I caught him with Paulita.\" I looked away…ashamed at what I was saying. Garrett didn't reply. I glanced over at him to see his eyes stare at my neck. \"Your necklace is gone. The one he gave you.\" \"I threw it in his face, after I caught them,\" I explained. \"I had my scatter ready, but I couldn't kill them.\" Garrett's eyes widened with shock. \"You burst in, while they were…together?\" \"That is correct. Doc was right about Billy's…infidelities,\" I sighed. Damn Doc for always being accurate. \"I had enough of Billy, Garrett. It's time for me to move on.\" I told him that, my voice soft…I could feel the tears swell up in my eyes. What was going to happen to me? Garrett was silent for a moment. \"What will you do now?\" \"I don't know.\" I looked down at the soapy water. \"I can't go home…\" \"I can take care of you, Tunstall…you know that.\" \"I do, yes,\" I said, sighing. That is what Billy told me, and look where I was now. \"I…I…\" I began to cry again, my soapy hands covering my face. \"WhatamIgoingtodo?\" I sobbed, blurting out my sentence in one word. \"Shhhh…Tunstall…\" Garrett consoled me, soothing my hair back. After crying for a few minutes, I was done. \"I'm sorry, Garrett…\" I told him. \"It's just that…Billy promised me that he would take care of me…and look what happened. Things couldn't have been worse, no?\" Garrett was silent, letting me talk. \"I have nowhere to go…Doc has Yen…Charlie has Manuela…Chavez…\" I smiled thinking of Chavez, one of my oldest friends. \"Chavez has a wandering soul. But I have decided what I want. I want to remain in New Mexico, Garrett. I'm tired of running. I'm tired of being an outlaw. I never wanted to be one in the first place.\" \"I know that.\" He responded with a small smile. \"All I want is to get my Father's land back-his store…I was supposed to take that over, did you know that?\" I didn't wait for his answer. \"Father was pleased that I wanted to run his business.\" \"You have a mind for business, I have to agree. Not many women would want that responsibility.\" \"Yes. It seems I am not the norm. They all want to get married and have kids.\" \"What's wrong with that?\" Garrett asked surprised. I smirked. \"I do not want to get married. There is so much I want to do. Well, if I wasn't a wanted outlaw, that is.\" Garrett stared into my eyes. \"What if you haven't met the right man…until now?\" My breath was caught in my throat. What was he trying to say? I looked directly into his brown eyes…noticed he had a big grin on his face. \"Garrett…\" I said slowly. \"Who would want… me ? I'm…I'm not a virgin…\" I stuttered. \"So? Neither am I.\" He chuckled. I smiled back at his joke. \"Garrett…you know as well as I…it's different for men, than women…and I wonder why that is. These damn men, making all the rules…if a man is not a virgin before he's married-he's considered 'sowing his wild oats'…and woman on the other hand…is labeled a soiled dove…a slut.\" I lowered my eyes, slightly embarrassed. I was tired of thinking. \"Tunstall…I would never consider you a soiled dove…\" Garrett told me, cupping my face with his hands. I gasped with surprise. \"You're a damn strong woman, you know that? You're intellectual…beautiful…compassionate…don't ever forget that, you hear me?\" \"Yes.\" I whispered as his lips met mine. Garrett's mouth was warm and demanding. I responded by pressing my lips seductively against his…his intense kiss touching my very soul. Garrett deepened the kiss, making me moan in pleasure. His beard and mustache tickled me…but in a very good way. Garrett broke off this kiss after a few minutes. \"Get out of that tub, and get dressed. I want to take you to supper.\" He said with a strangled whisper. I nodded my reply-I couldn't even speak after his passionate kiss! Garrett stood up and grabbed his hat. \"I bought us some new clothes for the trip to Lincoln Town. There's a dress in there as well…wear that tonight.\" \"Okay.\" I said, as he winked and left. I got out of the tub, and dried off as quickly as I could. I brushed my hair with a brush I found in my saddle bag, and braided my hair down my back with some ribbon I also had found. Going through the packages, I was pleased to see Garrett purchased me appropriate riding clothes. The dress he bought me is nice-a simple plaid dress with long sleeves. I was glad the sleeves were long, because I was planning to put medicine on my wrists, and wrap gauze around the wounds. Garrett had also purchased me a new camisole and petticoat for the dress. I put them on first, and sat down in front of the mirror again, to tend to my wrist wounds. Garrett knocked on the door probably thinking I was ready. I told him to come in. \"Damn it, Tunstall!\" He said, walking up to me. \"I thought you were decent.\" I almost wanted to laugh at his red face. \"Not too long ago you were kissing me, while I was in the tub. And now you're embarrassed to see me like this?\" I teased. Garrett chuckled. \"I suppose you're right…\" \"I need your help.\" \"With the dress? Do you like it?\" \"I do, thank you…I need you to wrap my wrists with the gauze here,\" I explained, pointing at the white material. \"I already have the medicine on. I can't do it myself.\" He smiled, and kneeling in front of me, with the gentlest touch, he wrapped my wrists as I requested. \"Thank you.\" \"Now-get dressed! I'm hungry!\" I laughed, noticing through the window, the sun setting. \"Just wait a bloody moment...I'm almost done.\" Garrett waited by the door, his back to me. I smiled as I slipped the dress on; amazed that it fit me so well. I buttoned the front, found my old boots, slid them on and was ready to go. \"I'm ready, Garrett.\" He turned, and gasped with surprise. \"You are so beautiful, Tunstall.\" He told me, smiling as I walked up to him. \"May I?\" He held out his arm. \"Certainly.\" I replied, holding onto his arm, as we left the hotel room. Okay…I know that was a really, long chapter! I hope you loved it! Please review-thanks![Chapter 17] Chapter Seventeen – The Meeting Hell Bent for Leather By EmiliosLoofah Hey, I know it's been a really, really long time. Will I ever finish this fan fic? Sure, I promise…it just takes some time for me. I have had a major case of writer's block, so, please bear with me! Also, our computer had failed and we lost the Word program…twice! It's good to be back! I indeed know it's been like two years…*mumbles* Chapter Summary: Pat Garrett had saved Jessica Tunstall from Dirty Sanchez…he arrived right on time. Garrett informs Jessica that he has a meeting in Santa Fe with the Governor…and she had agreed to accompany him. Another note…check this out: Beer, served at room temperature, was a popular drink during the Billy the Kid days, with Adolphus Busch introducing the artificial refrigeration and pasteurization of beer in 1880 with his Budweiser brand. Some saloons kept the beer in kegs stored on racks inside the saloon. Some saloons prided themselves on homemade beer and the beer was not always served at room temperature. Thanks Wikipedia! Special thanks to my hubby Tom! Special thanks to everyone that has been reading this and sticking with me for the past…THIS FAN FIC WILL BE FINISHED SOON! December 1941 It was late afternoon when the transport from London touched down on the tarmac at Wheeler Airfield in New York. The plane was ultimately designed for the transport of cargo, but could accommodate passengers if need be. Cole had elected to resign his assigned seat and found the driver's compartment of a Willies Jeep a slight bit more accommodating. The pain in his left leg and the stiffness in his back were dulled by the ever present feeling of sorrow he felt in his heart for the woman who raised him. A voice came over the intercom, snapping Cole from his repose. ' Major, there seems to be a reception party waiting for you! ' Cole managed his way to a window, and could see several black sedans with government markings parked on the far side of the landing strip. He could see the ground crew assembling outside as well. In a few minutes the plane was secured and the door was opened. Cole still on crunches, made his way to the exit. Standing at the top of the stairway, Cole watched as two men dressed in black overcoats made their way up to him. Instinctively Cole's hand went to his hip. \"Major Cole Garrett, I presume.\" asked the older dark clad figure. Cole nodded in acknowledgement. \"Sir, I'm Frank Wilson,\" he said as he produced and flipped open a leather wallet that housed a badge with the words United States Of America Secret Service . \"What I can do for you Mr. Wilson?\" asked Cole with a bit of marvel in his voice. Cole new damn well who Frank J. Wilson was, not only was he Secret Service, he was the head of the goddamn Secret Service ! This was the man who went toe to toe with Al Capone in 1937 and won . In a fluid motion Frank slid his identification back in his coat pocket and held out his hand to Cole. Frank smiled as Cole shook it. \"I couldn't help but see you go for your side arm as we approached.\" Now it was Cole turn to smile; old habits never die. \"What's this all about?\" Asked Cole, as he painfully moved to grab his duffel bag. With a quick nod from Frank, the other agent snatched up the bag, and headed down the gangway. Cole straightened himself on his crutches as Frank spoke. \"Major, I have been assigned to be in charge of your care while you are here in New York, so please…come with me.\" Frank held out his arm to motion Cole down the gangway. The two men made their way to the second of the two cars. Cole noticed there were four agents to each car. \"This is all for lil' old me, Mr. Wilson?\" 1880-Rosewell, New Mexico \"So…tell me more about this meeting…\" I asked Garrett, as I tasted my lamb with chick peas and mashed potatoes. \"There's not much to tell you, I have no idea why I was asked to come.\" Garrett said, sipping his beer. \"I was summoned for a meeting…requested to arrive in Santa Fe no later than the end of next week.\" I drank my wine, speculating what this…get together was really regarding. I looked at Garrett as I set my wine glass down. I felt that he was telling me the truth, not knowing what the agenda actually entailed. \"What is it?\" He asked me. \"Nothing,\" I responded, dipping my fork in my mashed potatoes. Throughout dinner, I drank my wine, but ate very little. My thoughts were on Garrett...I felt like I do know him pretty well…I feel at ease with him, but still…the heated kiss we had while I was in the bath thrilled me. No one has ever kissed me that way. Not even Billy… The thought of Billy made me frown for a moment. I pushed my thoughts and feelings in regards to Billy deep down, so I could concentrate on Patrick F. Garrett. \"You alright, Tunstall?\" Garrett asked me with concern. \"You hardly touched your dinner.\" \"I'm fine.\" I told him. Garrett reached out to touch my hand. \"You sure?\" I nodded yes, for I could not speak. Garrett gave me a slight smile, as he moved his hand off mine. I felt myself exhale and was surprised I was even holding my breath. Back in the hotel room Garrett lit a cigar, as I made sure the curtains were closed and the door locked. Satisfied, I sat at the dressing table, and pulled my sleeves up, to check my wrist wounds. Garrett was soon by my side, glancing down at my wrists. \"It looks a lot better, Tunstall. Maybe Doc is right…you'd make a damn good physician.\" \"That would be smashing, wouldn't it?\" I smiled up at him as I carefully tried to put the gauze back in place, but it was a struggle. Garrett helped me with a smile. His touch was gentle and kind. I thanked him for his help when he were done and rolled my dress sleeves back down. I peered into the mirror, and was pleased to see a vast improvement of my facial cuts and bruises. I'd be fine in no time, I guessed. I opened the bottle of witch hazel once again, and treated my face. As I worked on the wounds on my face, I could see what Garrett was doing in the reflection of the mirror. He looked comfortable as he smoked his cigar as he removed his gun belt, laying it on the back of the chair that was next to the bed. He removed his hat and then sat at the edge of the bed and took his boots off. I softly sighed, feeling safe for the first time in months. An idea suddenly presented itself to me that instant…could I use my feminine wilds on Garrett to achieve a means to an end? I instantly felt ashamed of myself; a flash of anger turned my face red. That goddamned Billy…even apart, I could still feel the influence that side-winding bastard had on me. Were we really all that different? Upset at myself, I grabbed my hairbrush and started to brush my long, black hair. I soon felt relaxed. Garrett clearing his throat brought me out of my repose. My gaze met his in the mirror. \"You know Tunstall… you really are quite breathtaking,\" He partly stuttered. \"Even with your bruised and battered face.\" \"Garrett!\" I spat, feeling my face flush. I put my brush down, and turned to face him. He was already standing in front of me, a serious look on his face. \"What is it?\" I asked with concern. Garrett didn't say a word as he held out his hand. I slipped my hand in his, and in an instant, I was standing right in front of him. \"What…what's wrong?\" I asked him. Okay, he was now starting to frighten me with his serious expression! Garrett cleared his throat, his hand now cupping the sides of my face. \"I love you…I want to marry you, Jessica Tunstall…\" I gasped with surprise. \"Wha…what?\" I stuttered, shocked. Garrett looked quite serious. \"You heard me.\" \"I…I…\" I closed my eyes for a second, wishing that I would stop stuttering like a child. Could this be pre ordained? I had to search my feelings. I really could love this man! I suddenly realized that Garrett needed me as much as I needed him. I felt a tear welling up in my eye. Not a tear of guilt for the things I was only moments ago contemplating but a tear of joy, for at this instant I knew that Garrett was my savior… My knight in shining armor, poised to carry me out of the blood and dust that Billy had cast me into. \"This is the only way out for you, and you know it.\" His brown eyes held my gaze. \"I meant what I said…I do love you…and who knows, maybe in time you could feel the same way about me.\" I closed my eyes and looked deep into my soul. Did I really feel the same way about Garrett? After a minute of reflection, I knew it was true. I needed him as much as he needed me. Although Billy would always hold a place in my heart…our relationship was reminiscent of a child's fondness for sweets; at first you can't get enough…then after a while the very thought of another gumdrop or sucker makes your stomach churn. The man standing in front of me was offering me the love I needed to escape my childhood. The memories that I choose to keep of Billy will always be filled with his charm and passion for life. Billy will always have a place in my heart; how can you thank someone who has taken you from a fragile tomboy to a determined, confident woman? In this moment of recollection, I knew that Billy could take me no further in my maturing. Garret was the one . I looked up and locked his gaze. \"Yes.\" I simply said. \"I will marry you.\" He produced a small blue velvet box from his jacket pocket. All movement stopped, and sound ceased in the small room as my attentions were locked on the box in Garrett's hand. \"This ring,\" Garrett said as his voice cracked, \"Was my Mothers, and her Mother's before her. It would bring their memory great honor for you to wear it as a token of my love for you.\" He opened the box to reveal a simple gold band with a single diamond. It was beautiful; He stood and removed the ring from its resting place and slid it on my finger. Garrett's serious expression suddenly changed to a look of pure joy. \"You've made me the happiest man alive.\" He pulled me close to him; his manly musk was an aphrodisiac to my womanly senses. I lost myself in his loving embrace, I felt all my insecurities melt away, and I gave myself to him freely. It went beyond a man and woman having carnal knowledge of each other…It was much more then the blazing passion between my legs and the rapid in and out I knew with Billy. It was an experience I have never felt before. Garrett brought me to exploding several times and loved me all through the night into the morning. For the first time in my life I made love. The next morning I stood next to Garret inside the tiny church located in the middle of Roswell. My thoughts and emotions felt as constricted and confined as my body did, in the store bought dress Garrett provided for me. He had proudly paid for the dress with some of the reward money that he received from bringing in the body of Dirty Sanchez. The sensible mature adult part of my psyche was in an outright battle with the younger and immature, free spirited will that has ruled my life up until this moment. I tried to take solace in words that my father would tell me as a child. But, no words would come. I realized at that moment that I was no longer a child…and could no longer think as one. The ceremony was really quite beautiful and I let myself get lost in the words and promises that where made that day. After the last 'I do' was said, I couldn't help but feel like I was a part of something bigger…something bigger than the both of us. My life suddenly had purpose, I was more than just a girl seeking revenge for my beloved father's death…there was life, a life stolen from me as a girl by a narrow sighted boy…a life returned to me by a man…a loving forgiving man who saw me as the woman I now was. Garrett's love would set me free. Over breakfast we talked about which direction we would take to Santa Fe. \"You must remember you are still a wanted criminal, Tunstall-…\" Garrett said between sips of coffee. He paused for a moment, and chuckled. \"I mean Jessica.\" He smiled as he reached his hand across the table to hold my hand. I returned his smile. \"That's okay…I don't think I could ever call you Pat, Garrett.\" I started to laugh. \"There is no way in bloody hell I can!\" Garrett chuckled as he squeezed my hand. His brown eyes seemed to sparkle with delight. We arrived at the Governor's mansion in Santa Fe right on time. I was dressed in my usual outfit of men's clothes, since we were traveling. A butler let us inside the building into a large courtyard. I noticed the high ceilings and archways, the beautiful fountains and vines crawling up the walls, with blooming flowers. As we quickly followed the Butler down the long hallways, I observed the expensive furniture, the nice paintings and the objects d'art. This was some luxurious residence. Governor Wallace sat at a large table with three men. I right away recognized John Chisum, and District Attorney Rynerson. I have no idea who the fourth man was. They all stood, noticing me enter into the room beside Garrett. \"Well, isn't this a surprise…it's the Sweetheart Shooter herself.\" John Chisum said with a smug grin. I frowned and opened my mouth to reply. Before I could react, Garrett spoke for me. \"It's Mrs. Garrett now. Jessica and I were married yesterday.\" The four men looked totally shocked at Garrett's announcement. Garrett cleared his throat. \"If I was called here to be implicated…I just want to say I'm now a married man…\" Garrett glanced over at me. \"I want to run a business…to start a family…\" He explained. The Butler came back with a crystal decanter marked \"whisky\" and six glasses on a silver tray. The Butler busied himself filling the glasses, and handed one to each of us. \"To your nuptials.\" Governor Wallace toasted us. I quickly downed the liquor, feeling uneasy. I didn't like this meeting at all. I wanted to leave. Before we entered, Garrett had convinced me not to bring in my pistols or shotgun. I did however, had my large Bowie knife attached to my leg. After the Dirty Sanchez ordeal, I would I ever be totally unarmed. After our toast, Garrett and I sat down, as the Governor started to speak. \"I'd like you to meet Mr. John Poe, representing the Cattleman's Association.\" I gave Mr. Poe a nod, as the Governor continued to speak \"Mr. Chisum has informed me of your ambitions, Mr. Garrett...as well as your involvement with William Bonney.\" Garrett didn't respond. \"And now that you are married to Miss Tunstall…well, that is an added bonus, you see.\" Garrett was still quiet. Rynerson leaned forward. \"You see Patrick, a change is needed immediately. We need a Sheriff who can…eliminate this… problem .\" \"What are you getting at?\" Garrett finally spoke. \"We're saying Sheriff of Lincoln County,\" Mr. Chisum chimed in. \"Sheriff Pat Garrett to be precise.\" I glanced over at Garrett, to see his eyes go wide with surprise. I am equally surprised as well, to say the least. This was the last thing I expected to happen. Garrett was not a political man at all, never a peacemaker. Garrett is a bounty hunter, a buffalo hunter, pals with Billy the Kid, and the Regulators…which included me, who had a bounty on her head. I was worth as much as Billy himself. Now these men were offering Garrett something I knew he couldn't refuse. They must desperate to capture Billy. Governor Wallace then produced a huge fold of U.S Government greenbacks and set them firmly on the table in front of us. \"We are offering you five hundred dollars up front… and five hundred later. And of course, all expenses will be paid. Is that acceptable?\" Garrett and I sat there in silence. I could feel a well of emotion building in me. Could it be possible for me to go so far right of Billy in what seemed to be an instant? It was as if we sat with demons, and the devil himself was offering me my salvation. After a few moments, Garrett took another drink and then looked at me. I could sense the turmoil behind his well trained poker face expression. I glanced around the room and felt all eyes on me. I met each gaze with my own…these men knew as well as I did, they would determine my very existence in the next few moments. It was a lot to digest in just an instant. But I had set my own feet on this very path when I accepted Garrett's proposal. I quickly made peace with the idea; the recognition of this life changing decision put me in the mindset of Judas, and how he must have felt holding thirty pieces of silver. Not that Billy was anybody's savior…but that made me feel the traitor none the less. Garrett poured me another shot. I down it quickly, my hand shaking as I drank…I drank the liquor as if I were parched with thirst. Slamming the glass down on the table, I looked over at my new husband and nodded my understanding. The price to cleanse my sins would be the extermination of Billy. \"This is acceptable, under one circumstance,\" Garrett said. \"A full pardon for my wife… otherwise there is no deal.\" \"Are you serious?!\" Mr. Chisum laughed. \"She has commented so many crimes; you need an abacus to calculate them!\" At this, I quickly stood and slapped my palms hard on the table. I could not bottle my contempt for this bloated sack of horse shit any longer. \"You sir,\" I exclaimed, pointing my finger inches away from his scowled mug; my voice cracking with anger, \"Are the preverbal pot calling the kettle black!\" The room went silent for a moment, but the tension was broken by the mocking laughter of Governor Wallace. \"The young lady has got your number, John.\" He sounded amused. I continued to glare at Mr. Chisum. \"Tunstall…\" Garrett softly whispered, trying to calm me down. I gave Mr. Chisum another glare as I settled myself down and returned to my chair. Under the table, Garrett gently reached for my hand. I noticed the anger slowly leave my body, as if Garrett's touch soothed me. I cleared my throat. \"Most of the crimes I am accused of are fabricated, Mr. Chisum.\" I surprised myself of how calm I sounded, as I spoke. \"Most of the killings I have done were done in self defense. I didn't want to kill anyone.\" I gave him a small smile. \"I just wanted to make things right by liberating your cattle.\" Mr. Chisum glared at me. Over the past year or two, the Regulators and I have stolen countless livestock from Mr. Chisum, as well from other prominent ranchers in New Mexico. I knew my last statement really riled him up, as well as Mr. Poe. Governor Wallace smiled at me as he chewed his cigar. \"I say it's a deal, gentlemen. I will sign her pardon as of today. After all, she is now married to Mr. Garrett. I believe her days with William Bonney are officially over.\" The deal was struck. Garrett reached for the Governor's hand and said, \"Those who practice evil in the pursuit of righteousness are promised a crown in hell.\" We turned to leave and I could hear Garrett mutter under his breath, \"May God save our souls.\" Over the next week, Garrett and I made provisions to bring our endeavors to fruition. Of course we knew every hideout and everyone who helps and supports Billy. We got new supplies, weapons, and other assorted items needed. We sat at the table and poured over maps, discussed different routes, what we should and should not do when encountered by Billy and the Regulators. We realized we must tread lightly. Billy was a lot of things…but a fool he was not. \"This is mad.\" I shook my head. \"I really cannot believe we are actually going to embark on this task.\" Garrett held my hand, and gave it a gentle squeeze. \"This must be very difficult for you.\" I looked into his eyes. \"Garrett…I realize if I was still with Billy...you would be hunting me down as well.\" Garrett sighed. \"I don't believe you were ever part of the deal, Tunstall.\" \"You don't know that for sure. I'm sure they would have got… rid of me as well.\" I couldn't bring myself to say killed . \"After all, I was Billy's girl. Chisum hates me and would have wanted you to-\" \"That's enough.\" Garrett told me, interrupting me. \"I would not have agreed to any of this, if you were a part of it.\" I sighed and thought aloud. \"It's strange how your priorities change with your perception. And my perception now…for me to be free, Billy must be caged.\" I was still in shock over reading the article the New Mexico Independent published a few days ago, announcing my full pardon, my marriage to Garrett, and that Garrett is officially now Sheriff Patrick Garrett of Lincoln County. I knew Doc, Charlie and Chavez would be pleased. I wondered what Billy would think of this news. I laughed for a moment, full well knowing he would be cross that the paper didn't mention him . I was in the hotel room, packing some things, when Garrett walked in. I looked at him with shock…his beard was totally gone! His hair was cut; his mustache trimmed neatly, his black clothes and black duster made him seem like a totally different man to me. \"What do you think?\" He smiled at me. \"Bloody hell!\" I laughed, walking up to him. I softly touched his face. \"You look so…God damned respectable!\" Garrett laughed, and grabbed me. He held me close to him. \"I suppose you like it?\" I laughed. \"Yes.\" Was all I managed to say, as his deep kiss stopped me from saying anything more. Garrett stopped our kiss after a little while. \"Are we ready to go?\" \"Yes.\" I whispered, quite breathless after our kiss. Garrett laughed at my response. \"There will be somebody else riding with us.\" Garrett stated. \"Who?\" I asked, packing my diaries into my saddle bag. \"Ashmun Upson. Do you remember him? He runs that newspaper down in Fort Sumner.\" I think for a moment, remembering a short, bespectacled man with a New England accent. I also remember Ash being a drunk. \"Why him?\" \"He will be documenting our endeavor.\" I laughed. \"Are you serious? I don't think he's ever been on a horse!\" This caused Garrett to laugh as well. I stood outside our hotel, ready to go. We were to ride to Fort Sumner first, so we could meet up with Ash. I was a little apprehensive to go, since the last time I was there, I caught Billy with Paulita….but this time it was different. I was a married woman, and also pardoned by Governor Wallace. It was a good feeling. For the first time in a very long time I felt secure, and I knew Garrett would do anything to keep me safe. As Garrett was inside the lobby paying the hotel bill, I made sure my saddlebags were sturdy and prepared to go. I had a strange feeling in my belly, wondering what was going to happen next. \"Hello, Jessie.\" I heard a familiar voice behind me. My hand instinctively reached for a weapon that was not there. I took a deep breath and turned. Like poison, I spit his name. \"Billy!\" The last thing I remember seeing was his boyish smile, as my world went black. WooHoo! After, what how many years, I finally updated this! Hells yeah! Please leave your review, I LOVE reviews, they make me happy! *doing a happy dance*[Chapter 18] Chapter Eighteen – Come to Jesus Meeting/Cat Hangin' Hell Bent for Leather By EmiliosLoofah Well, a lot has happened since the last chapter. Let's see…Jessie and Garrett are now married, Jessie has a full pardon per the Governor, and the newly wedded couple is on their way to Fort Sumner to hire Ash Upson to write the story of the hunt for Billy the Kid. Billy unexpectedly showed up in Santa Fe, surprising Jessie… 1880 - Las Vegas, New Mexico The pain in my head was reminiscent of the tide; I remembered sitting at the wharf as a young girl, I would concentrate on a large stone in the bay, and watch the waves come in and cover it entirely, then roll back out, leaving the stone visible and exposed. I slowly opened my eyes, to find myself lying on an unfamiliar bed. My only friend at this point was the darkness. I tried to recall the events that brought me to this place, as another wave of pain extinguished any rational thoughts. I struggled to place pieces of my jigsaw puzzle memory, but could only remember- \"BILLY! You sonofabitch !\" I shouted with frustration. I sat straight up, and my head spun. I could feel the contents in my stomach rising. I heard a chuckle. Oh, I know that laugh…I know it only too well… I then remembered…remembered that Garrett and I were supposed to be leaving Santa Fe, and then Billy showed up. Billy the bloody kid! Billy slowly walked over to me, Arkansas Dave by his side. Both were smiling down at me. \"YooHoo, Jess!\" Billy sang to me with a smile. \"Have you missed me?\" I narrowed my eyes at Billy, as I slowly stood up. \"You bloody bastard!\" I shouted. \"Why in the hell did you take me? Why-\" \"You know damn well why, Jessie. Or should I call you Mrs. Garrett now?\" Billy sneered, throwing the New Mexico Independent newspaper at me. \"How soon we quickly forget the ones we love.\" My fists balled up with anger, I so wanted to punch Billy in the face. I stood up, doing my best to mask the dizzy spell that overtook me. \"You selfish, childlike, philandering…walking bag of manure! I left you because I caught you with Paulita …in bed... together !\" I spat out a curse and continued my rant. \"Love, hah ! You don't know the first thing about love. Oh, wait, you do…you only love yourself !\" I grabbed the newspaper he tossed at me, and threw it in his face. \"You think Pat loves you, Jessie?\" Billy asked; grabbing the newspaper I threw at him, tossing it to the ground. \"He is using you! He needs you for his grand plan, and you fell for it, like a love sick little girl needing to be saved!\" I could feel my face getting hot, my ears were on fire. What in the bloody hell is Billy talking about? \"He's just playing you, Jess...all of us.\" Billy's voice started to crack. \"He is capitalizing on your suffering, and your Father's death to make himself a known man.\" \"You are crazy…\" I whispered as I stared at Billy with disbelief. \"Crazy am I?\"… Billy took two steps towards me. I thought for a moment that he might hit me, and then he spoke softly into my ear. \"Think about it Jess…now that you're pardoned, your Father's estate and holdings are now yours…or should I say…your husbands .\" My Father's estate never crossed my mind. Was it still intact? \"So, Now that Garrett has the capital to achieve his goal, what does he need with you?\" Billy looked at me and smiled, the anger now leaving his face. Billy looked unexpectedly calm. \"The way I see it Jess…\" Billy said, as he twirled some of my hair with his fingers, \"I just saved your life... again .\" My first reaction was to knock his head from his shoulders. But then I thought I would not let this man make me lose my composure ever again , because that would prove to him that I still had feelings for him. I took a deep breath and jerked my head back, freeing my hair from his fingers; I looked Billy directly in the eye. \"Know this, Mr. Bonney…if I had a weapon on me right now, you'd be dead on the floor.\" Billy only smirked at my statement. \"We are going to spend some time together…more than ever before, isn't that grand?\" He started to laugh. \"Garrett will come for me.\" I boldly stated. \"You think Pat Garrett has time to come looking for his 'lil sweetheart shooter?\" Billy questioned. \"I bet he made time to consummate your marriage!\" Dave said with a lewd laugh. Billy's expression suddenly turned solemn. I ignored Dave and glared at Billy. Oh, if looks could kill! My stomach still felt nauseous, and I wanted to throw up. I felt dizzy as well. Dave approached me from the side. \"I'm glad I was the one to knock you out, Jessie. I told Billy here to just let Patsy do you in…you deserve it. You are a total pain in the ass!\" I turned to give Dave a piece of my mind. Instead, I emptied my stomach on his person. My knees went weak, and I sat heavily on the bed. Dave stood there, his palms out and his hands to the side. His mouth was open with shock, his torso dripping with my vomit. \"Jesus Christ , Jessie, you are disgusting !\" I could hardly hear him complain over Billy's laughter. \"Go get yourself cleaned up, Dave,\" Billy told him, as I slowly lay back down on the bed. I could feel myself slowly slipping into darkness. I felt the weight of Billy sitting on the bed beside me. His hand brushed back the hair that was on my face. \"It's gonna be like old times, Jessie. Pals, remember?\" I felt his lips on my forehead. \"I know you still love me.\" He whispered. I felt woozy again. I just let go of my senses and let the wave cover the stone. \"That bastard could have killed her!\" I heard Doc mutter. \"She's fine now, Doc, don't worry. Jessie is tough.\" Charlie chuckled softly. \"She got Dave good, huh?\" As I slowly awoke, I felt my hand in some else's, and a cool compress on my forehead. I wiggled my toes to find my boots were now off my feet. \"Damn it!\" Doc swore. \"I knew I should have taken her to New York or old Mexico with me.\" I could hear him heavily sigh with guilt. \"But she had to stay with that bastard.\" \"It ain't your fault, Doc.\" Charlie told him. \"She's married to Pat Garrett now.\" \"And what good did that do? Billy kidnapped Jessica…right under Pat's nose! We all swore an oath to John…to protect Jessica no matter what .\" \"Yeah… but Pat didn't.\" Charlie exclaimed. \"What if it's true what Billy says about Pat, just wanting Jessie here for John's lands and money?\" What were they talking about? This cannot be true, what Billy said about Garrett. He said he loved me. I gave myself to him…mind, body and soul. I slowly stirred, glad that I didn't feel nauseous any longer. \" Bonita. \" Chavez whispered, as I felt his hand squeeze mine. \"Regulators…\" I mumbled as I opened my eyes. I slowly smiled at my three dear friends. \"Jesus, Jessie…\" Doc started to smile as he rushed over to hug me. \"You had us so worried!\" I blinked back my tears. I was so happy to see them. \"Doc…\" My voice cracked as I fought to keep the tears down. I surveyed my surroundings. \"Hey, where are we, anyway?\" I asked. \"White Oaks…Jane Greathouse's new place.\" Charlie replied. \"Oh, bloody hell! Are you serious?\" I almost laughed. Jane Greathouse is a good friend of Billy and I and the other Regulators. She is also a well known Madam with a successful brothel. Doc sighed. \"We need Billy with us. He has the support of the people. That is the only thing saving our necks right now.\" Doc reached for my free hand. \"I'm so sorry all this happened to you, Jessica.\" He looked down at the ring my father gave me on my 16th birthday, and then my wedding ring. \"I understood why you married Patsy. It was the only thing you could have done to clear your name, Jessica. But…\" Doc paused; his blue eyes looked troubled. \"Pat Garrett is a desperate man.\" \"Yeah!\" Charlie agreed. \"The Governor was ridin' hard for Pat as well.\" I looked at my closest friends. To believe that Garrett… my husband… could do such a thing would devastate my fragile existence. Was Billy just trying to plant seeds of doubt? I wouldn't put it past that son of a bitch. I took a deep breath, and gained my resolve . Garrett loves me and I love him…don't I? \"I didn't think Billy would go to these extremes . \" I said. \"We had no idea what he and Dave planned.\" Doc told me. \"But Billy was sure that Pat would have given you up to save his own hide; that is if you didn't agree to marry him.\" Doc squeezed my hand to bring my attention back to his gaze; he had a very concerned look on his face. \"Jessica, what do you remember about the day you left Maxwell's place?\" \" Yes…what happened, Bonita? \" Chavez asked. I told them what happened, that I found Billy with Paulita in bed back in Fort Sumner. \"I almost shot them both, but I couldn't do it-\" \"Wait a moment,\" Charlie interrupted me, holding is hand up. \"You are sayin' that you walked in on them, and you had your scatter loaded and ready?\" \"That is exactly what I'm saying.\" Charlie grinned. \"You never cease to amaze me, Jessie.\" \"Jesus, Charlie, this is serious !\" Doc sighed, as he shook his head. I continued talking, telling them the terrible account of Dirty Sanchez, and how Garrett saved me. I was so emotional at that point, I started to softly cry. They let me talk it out, not interrupting me. I told them how Garrett offered me his hand in marriage, the meeting in Santa Fe at the Governor's mansion, my pardon and when Billy surprised me outside the hotel. Still holding my hand, Doc looked me in the eye. \"Jessica, I know for a fact that Pat left with Sanchez that night.\" No! This could not be true! Charlie cleared his throat. \"Patsy was looking to partner up with Pete Maxwell for that cantina he was bragging about opening; 'cept ole Pete told Patsy he was a bad risk and wouldn't help him.\" Doc let go of my hand and suddenly jumped up. \"God damn it! That son-of a bitch Billy was right . Pat and Dirty Sanchez came gunning for you that night Jessie.\" Chavez began twirling his knife, to help release his nervous tension. \"Pat has lost his way, and now travels the false path.\" I could feel my mouth going dry, my throat started to close…I couldn't breathe. Doc was now pacing the room working out the details as he walked in circles. No…no…please, no! \"Pat and that filthy excuse for a human being must have split up to cover more ground.\" Doc glanced at me; I could tell his mind was racing. \"You must have been riding hard, Bonita.\" Chavez pointed out. \"Pat must have seen Ole Dirty coming up on you, Jessie.\" Charlie chimed in. \"Pat must have fabricated his grand scheme when he saw you being attacked…\" Doc spit out the words as if they were poison. \"The Governor was pressing him for Billy. The next best thing would have been to give them you …and Dirty Sanchez was just a nice little bonus.\" The room fell deafly silent. Everything seemed magnified to me. The dust bunnies on the floor seemed like tumbleweeds. I felt the silence pressing in my brain. Everything seemed to be moving in slow motion. I was in shock. My once beautiful hopes and dreams lay shattered on the ground, like the mosaics my Father had introduced to me as a child at St. Peters Cathedral in London. How could I be such a fool? I felt like I was drowning. I looked to see the doorknob turn. Billy burst in, holding a greasy sack. \"Anyone want any apple empanadas?\" December 1941 The air was crisp and newly fallen snow blanketed the ground as the motorcade pulled up to the main house at Hyde Park. The two hundred mile trip from Wheeler Airfield had taken its toll on Cole. The cold weather and the long car ride added no benefit to the constant pain he felt in his knee and his sour disposition. This seemingly unnecessary detour was not only keeping him from the warmer weather of New Mexico; it also delayed him from performing some important tasks involved with being the executor of his Grandmothers estate. Cole's thoughts of home and responsibility were interrupted when Frank Wilson cleared his throat. Frank had made the trip sitting alongside Cole. \"Remember Major Garrett, the President is very sensitive about his Handicap.\" Cole tilted his head and raised an eyebrow as he held Franks gaze for a few seconds. He looked down at his bandaged knee, as the car door opened from the outside. Cole grabbed his crutches and batted away the aid's hand offered as help. \"I reckon we'll have lots to talk about then.\" The house was grand. Cole was ushered into the main hall. Just two years ago England's King George VI visited this same house. Frank closed in just behind Cole as the door on the right was opened. A man in servant's attire gestured them in. Behind a large maple desk sat President Roosevelt. \"Archibald! Fetch my cousin a chair; can't you see he is injured?\" Roosevelt then smiled. \"Gentlemen, please forgive me if I don't get up…but this wretched weather does not agree with my condition.\" Cole smiled back as he sat and nodded his agreement. \"Frank,\" exclaimed the President, as he thumbed through some papers on his desk. \"Here is my travel itinerary.\" He extended a folder and shook it, motioning Frank to take it. \"I remember the first year I visited New Mexico, about seventeen years ago. I was in a little town by the name of Santa Rosa. I was awakened every night for two or three nights, about half-past one in the morning, by a very heavy railroad train going through town. As it went through town, the fireman laid his hand on the whistle, and woke up everybody. What he had intended to do was to salute the young lady in town that he was engaged to, but he woke everybody else up.\" Cole couldn't help but to laugh out loud at the President's story. For as a child, that same train woke him up many a night. \"Mr. President, I can't tell you how honored I am to have received your invitation, but I cannot help but to feel I have more pressing matters in New Mexico.\" The President looked at Cole as he lit a fresh cigarette in his cigarette holder. \"My dear boy, I summoned you here not to reminisce of old railroad stories in a bygone area, but to accompany you personally back home to attend services. And by the way, to you, I am simply 'Cousin'.\" Hopefully I will post another chapter for you guys really soon! I love you all!

Something weighed heavily on his mind, but he wasn't sure what it was. As for now, he thought he would leave the OSS and focus on other important aspects of his life, such as school, his detective agency, and his various hobbies. One day, while up in his only and favourite tree house that his uncle, Machete, had built for him and his sister, he noticed that the weird feeling, that had happened after he and his \"family\" had shut down Game Over, was back. Juni didn't think twice about this feeling so Juni sat down on his metal chair. As Juni was just getting settled, he saw a screen appear in front of the trees where a squirrel had made its home. Juni was surprised to see an old friend of his on the screen. \"I didn't realize you knew how to reach me in this tree house.\"Juni said. \"Your uncle Machete gave me this number, just in case I needed to reach you. Besides, I have a question for you.\"came the reply. What is this weird feeling that Juni is feeling? Who is on the other side of the Video Chat, and what is the question for Juni? Find out in Chapter 2![Chapter 2] I thought I would upload another chapter today. This chapter answers some of the questions posed in the previous chapter, such as who is on the other end of the Video chat, and the question that the person has for Juni. Enjoy! Coding Genius Chapter 2 \"What is it?\" Juni replied. \"I was wondering if you would like to learn the basics of computer programming if you have extra time on your hands. I know that you already have a decent idea about how technological devices work, but since you helped to change me from being evil to good, and that you taught the robot children how to be nice and have minds of their own, I thought I'd repay the favour.\"Floop said. \"But aren't you busy with Floop's Fooglies?\" Juni asked. \"Not in the slightest. Besides, being creative and eccentric comes naturally to me.\"Floop replied. \"Sure, I'll check if my sister can give me a ride in one of the OSS's helicopters. What time would you like to start teaching me?\" said Juni. \"Well anytime works, but I was thinking of perhaps this weekend. Perhaps a whole weekend if mom and dad say it's alright.\" Floop answered. \"Shouldn't be a problem. I'll ask them and get back to you tomorrow afternoon. I know that I have your phone number, but I'll add you as a contact on Video Chat.\" Juni replied. \"Fine by me\" answered Floop. \"I look forward to it\" said Juni. \"And I look forward to your call\" came Floop's reply. What will Juni's parents have to say to him spending a weekend with Floop? Also, will Carmen be able to give him a ride to Floop's Castle? Stay tuned for Chapter 3![Chapter 3] Sorry about this being a shorter chapter. I think some of the other chapters coming up may be a tad longer though, so that should even out the length of each chapter. This chapter doesn't really answer any questions, but gets a feel for the inside of the Cortez's house, and also that the weird feeling is still afflicting Juni. Coding Genius Chapter 3 Juni had just been asked if he could spend a weekend with his idol, Floop. Juni noticed that the weird sensation had also vanished while his mind was focused on conversing with Floop. Now that he was done talking, the weird sensation had entered Juni's mind once more. \"I better go ask if it's okay if I spend a weekend with Floop, and if Carmen can give me a ride to his castle.\" thought Juni. Juni exited the tree house and entered the house. Carmen, along with his father, Gregorio, were nowhere to be seen. His mom, Ingrid, was busy making supper. The Cortez's were having fajitas tonight and thus the smell of steak, onion, chicken, and bell peppers being cooked and prepared wafted around the house. It was a lot of work, but Juni's mom had help in the form of a Thumb Thumb robot. Juni thought he could either ask his mom about hanging out with Floop for a weekend now, or ask everyone their respective questions at supper. Juni decided to wait until supper and ask then. The smell of fajitas grew stronger. So I suppose that since this chapter didn't answer any questions from Chapter 2, some of those will be answered in Chapter 4. Thanks for reading![Chapter 4] Sorry for not posting a chapter yesterday. I will be posting two today, so you can look for those! Also this chapter doesn't really cover too much, but mostly delves into the family unit a bit. Coding Genius Chapter 4 Juni noticed that his mom was setting the table. Juni made sure to help his mom by getting and setting the plates for each family member. \"Supper time!\" yelled Juni's mom. Juni was the first to get his fajita and sat down at the table. Next, was Carmen who sat next to Juni, third Juni's dad, and last was Ingrid. Like any other family they told each other what had happened each day. They also gave advice to each other. Today was no different. Juni was excited, yet a bit nervous to ask for permission to hang out with Floop for a weekend and a ride from his sister. \"I just finished putting the last touches on the ninth brain.\"Gregorio finished. \"Just make sure that it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.\" Ingrid commented. \"I had a great day as well.\" Carmen said. \"I decided to sign up for the Caji Dart Mission. It's somewhere in the Pacific.\" Carmen said. \"Be careful\" commented both Ingrid and Gregorio in unison. \"After all, it's a rank one mission.\" Ingrid added. \"Juni, you've been awfully quiet\" said Juni's father. Finally, this was the opening that Juni had been waiting for. Without a second thought, Juni said \"I got a question from someone today.\" Well, the next chapter will cover how Juni's parents and Carmen respond to Juni's question. I hope you are enjoying this so far.[Chapter 5] Finally another vital chapter. This is the chapter where Juni gets responses to his questions. Coding Genius Chapter 5 Juni explained what Floop had told him, and finally he asked the questions he needed to. His family listened intently, while Juni asked \"Can I hang out with Floop this weekend? Also, since you are going on the Caji Dart mission, Carmen, I wondered if I could get a ride from you to Floop's Castle.\" Juni's parents gave each other looks and though about what Juni had just requested. Finally, Gregorio said \"Well I suppose you have been on missions that were more dangerous than this, so if your mom's fine with it and you have some way to get there, not including the escape pod, then yes you can go.\" \"Fine with me.\"Juni's mom said. \"As for me giving you a ride to Floop's Castle, my mission is scheduled to begin on Friday afternoon, so you will have to ask Floop if that works for him.\" Carmen stated. Juni's mind was now free of these questions. He had got the confirmation from his family members that it was okay. All he had to do was confirm that Floop was okay with him being there a day early. Juni thought about his Game Over mission again, and suddenly the weird feeling came back. Well, Juni finally got the confirmation to go ahead and spend the weekend with Floop. Juni still does not know what the weird feeling is. Also, what will the people at OSS say about Juni catching a ride with Carmen? What will Floop say about Juni coming early? Some of these questions will be answered next chapter.[Chapter 6] Sorry for not posting this weekend, but I had errands to do. Anyways it looks like I should be able to keep posting new chapters every weekday, so hopefully that works for all of you. Other than that, I don't have much to say before you read the chapter. Coding Genius Chapter 6 The next day, Juni helped people with their various troubles as part of his detective agency. He helped locate stray dogs, find kid's lost bikes, and other various activities that were helpful for the people in the city where he lived. He also got fairly good pay from the people requesting his services. After he had closed down his agency for the day, he went back into his tree house and decided to video chat with Floop to make sure he was okay with Juni coming a day early. \"Hi Floop. How are things?\" Juni asked. \"Things aren't going too badly here. Did you have a good day?\" Floop replied. \"I mostly had an average day looking into people's troubles and fixing or finding what they wanted\" Juni replied. \"So what did mom and dad say? Also is your sister okay with giving you a ride here?\" Floop asked. \"My parents don't have a problem with me coming over this weekend, but my sister is going on an assignment, and she wants to get started on Friday morning. I was wondering if I could come a day earlier.\" Juni stated. \"I'm still taping my show on Friday mornings, but other than that it should be fine.\" Floop replied. \"Excellent! See you Friday Floop\"Juni replied. \"See you then\" was Floop's response. Well, it seems like everything is okay with Juni coming early. What are your thoughts on the fanfic so far. Is it too slow, too fast, perhaps too boring. Let me know, and I'll try to make the necessary adjustments, so that everyone can enjoy it more. Thanks for reading.[Chapter 7] This chapter was a necessary chapter, mostly due to the fact that it emphasizes important facts that will be needed later. Coding Genius Chapter 7 The rest of the days for that week seemed to drag on for Juni. The weird feeling never left him either, but he kept disregarding it. He couldn't wait for Friday. The night before Juni would leave with his sister he packed his three day suitcase. In it, he packed the regular stuff: shirts, pants, underwear, socks, his toothbrush and tooth paste. He also packed some of the important things that he had collected from days gone by: Ralph, his spider monkey, and his pair of 3D glasses that he had gotten from his Game Over mission. At last, Juni had thought he had packed everything he would want or need over this action packed weekend with his idol. He slept very well that night, dreaming of all the things he could do with his extra knowledge. He dreamt of robots, video games, and other various technological gadgets. The next morning, Juni had a great big bowl of cereal. He thought back to a morning very similar to this in which he had played his Floop Fooglies action figures. Carmen jolted Juni back to the present. \"Are you almost ready to go?\" she yelled. It seems like both Carmen and Juni are ready for the trip to Floop's Castle. Why is that weird feeling still plaguing Juni, and will it ever go away? Will Juni use all of the stuff he packed? Will the ride to Floop's Castle be uneventful? Some of these questions will be answered next chapter, so stay tuned![Chapter 8] This chapter is a great last look at the city where Juni lives, for a while. Juni will return later, but WAY down the road. Coding Genius Chapter 8 \"Almost ready!\" Juni yelled back. Juni was packed and ready to go. Carmen was waiting inside the red OSS helicopter. Juni would have said goodbye to his parents, but since it was Friday, they had already left for work. Instead, Juni left a note. It read \"Bye mom and dad. I will miss you. I'll try to phone you, but don't worry if I don't call. I hope you have a great weekend. See you Sunday afternoon. Love, Juni.\" Juni locked the door behind him, and walked to the helicopter. Juni was surprised to see that Carmen had found a two person helicopter, since most of the OSS's helicopters were meant for one person only. Juni got into the helicopter and made sure that his seatbelt was securely fastened. \"I didn't know that the OSS had two seater helicopters. Weren't Donnagon or Felix curious as to why you wanted a two seater helicopter?\" Juni asked. \"I explained the situation to them. I may have expanded the truth a little\" Carmen replied. \"How so?\" Juni asked. \"I told them that you were on a top secret mission that even the OSS didn't have access to.\" Carmen responded. \"Well, let's be off.\" Carmen said at last. Juni took one last look to see his house, and then his tree house, and finally his city disappear. He was on his way to Floop's Castle. Juni is on his way to Floop's Castle finally. Now we are finally getting into the meat of the fanfic. Sorry for the HUGE intro, but it was kind of needed. Don't worry, it's all worth it since it's a huge fanfic that I'm writing. Anyways, that's all I can tell you for now about the next chapter. Thanks again for reading.[Chapter 9] Well, sorry for not updating on Thursday or Friday. As a special treat though, I will be uploading two chapters today. Enjoy! Coding Genius Chapter 9 Juni was feeling more and more excited as each minute passed by. \"At least I know how to fly this helicopter.\" Carmen stated. \"It's only because I didn't read all of the instructions last time\" Juni responded. They had both remembered the Spy Plane incident from their first flight to Floop's Castle. Juni had to go to the toilet. \"Don't look!\" Juni said. \"Wasn't planning on it.\" Carmen retorted. \"Now flushing your poop and pee\" said the electronic voice as Juni flushed his waste. \"It seems like we are about halfway there\" Carmen commented. \"Perfect! I can't wait.\"Juni replied. By now, it was about ten-thirty. Both teens were getting hungry, so Juni rehydrated some cereal for Carmen, and some bacon and eggs for himself. They were quite glad that the helicopter came equipped with the latest gear and other items that made the trip more enjoyable such as: the toilet, rehydrator, and of course and auto-pilot. \"We're here.\"Carmen said. Juni's smile grew larger and larger as the helicopter landed on one of the castle's helipads. What new adventures lie in wait inside the castle? Will there be any changes inside the castle? What will Juni eat while he is at Floop's Castle? Find out some of these questions and more in Chapter 10![Chapter 10] Well this is the second chapter that will be uploaded today. This chapter poses another question, which will be answered in a future chapter. Coding Genius Chapter 10 \"Well, do you need anything else before I leave you?\" Carmen asked. \"I think everything I need is in the suitcase, and I have that so I think I'm good. Thanks for giving me a lift, and good luck on your mission.\" Juni replied. \"No problem. Anytime.\" Carmen said. The siblings had a quick hug. Juni watched his sister fly away in the helicopter. \"Well, no point in in standing around. Better go inside.\"Juni thought. Juni heaved they heavy door open, and headed inside the castle. Juni didn't know where Floop was, so Juni wandered the castle's corridors. They didn't seem as big or as long as when he was here when he was younger. Juni noticed some pictures hanging on a wall to his left. He went to go check these out. It seemed to be pictures of Floop's television program, along with pictures of Floop with his friends. There were old pictures and relatively new pictures. Juni saw pictures of Floop with Machete; he also saw a picture with Floop and his family, which was taken after his first mission. However, one of these pictures piqued Juni's curiosity. The picture was of a young Floop with a young person that seemed to look like the Toymaker. Juni wondered if it was actually the Toymaker, and if so how did the two of them know each other. Juni continued exploring the castle. Juni felt hungry, so he headed for the castle's banquet hall. How does Floop know the Toymaker? Where's Floop? What will Juni have for lunch? Find out the answers to some of these questions in the next chapter.[Chapter 11] Hi. I hope everyone is enjoying their Monday so far. This chapter covers the introduction of Floop. I don't want to give too much away, so I guess you'll just have to read how he gets reintroduced. Coding Genius Chapter 11 Juni wasn't necessarily sure that the banquet hall had food, but he distinctly remembered that his parents had told him how they had been given food there, when they were captured by Floop. Juni finally made it to the castle's banquet hall. He walked in to find Floop already sitting at the head of the table. \"Thirty minutes… I was expecting something around that time… Finally though, we can eat!\" said Floop. \"Don't remind me.\"replied Juni. They exchanged hugs, and they both sat at the table. Two robot children, which looked like Carmen and Juni, brought them what looked like chicken sandwiches. The robot children sat the food down on the table in front on Juni and Floop, and left the room. \"How was today's show?\" Juni asked. \"I think it went well today, making your dreams come true is tough, yet worth it.\"replied Floop. \"It also looks like the food here has gotten significantly better since the last time I was here.\" Juni commented. \"There was nothing wrong with that green goop that I served your whole family, last time you were here. Since it's the robot children that are doing the cooking instead of the Thumb Thumb robots, and the robot children actually have brains, it increases their mental capacity, and also their neural activity, to taste and know the taste buds of every person I know.\" Floop explained. They ate the remainder of their meals. Afterwards, another question popped into Juni's mind. What is the question that just popped into Juni's mind? I hope Juni enjoyed the chicken sandwiches for this chapter. Hopefully he also enjoys the other meals that will be eaten while he is at the castle. What will Juni do for his afternoon at the castle? Find out the answers to some of these questions and more in the next chapter! Stay tuned![Chapter 12] Welcome back to Coding Genius! In the last chapter Juni had just remembered that he had a question for Floop. In this chapter, Juni will get an answer to his question. Coding Genius Chapter 12 \"How do you know the Toymaker?\" Juni asked. \"He used to be one of the people that I taught my computer science classes to. About thirty years ago, there was no Floop's Fooglies television program and instead I taught young children how to code. In the end, the Toymaker surpassed even my abilities. A couple years later the Toymaker learnt about the OSS and worked there as the head of the games and technological field. Unfortunately, he and the head of the OSS didn't see eye to eye on many issues. Along with that was the fact that many people including the Toymaker, thought he had put your grandfather in a wheelchair. The head of the OSS convinced everyone to banish him to the virtual reality void. At least that's what Minion told me, after I hired him to work on my television show.\" Floop explained. \"That makes sense to me.\"said Juni. \"I suppose I should take you to your bedroom, so that you can drop off your suitcase.\" Floop suggested. Juni had forgotten that he was still lugging his suitcase around with him, because of the great meal he had just eaten. \"I like the sound of that.\" Juni replied. Floop led Juni through several twisty corridors. \"Careful, you'll have to jump over this part.\"Floop said. Both Floop and Juni backed up for a running start and leapt over the floor, which broke into puzzle pieces once they had landed safely. \"Almost there.\"Floop said cheerily. So that's the Toymaker's back story. I hope that this explains a bit more of the Toymaker's back story for all of you. This also serves to reintroduce the Toymaker for this story, as he'll be in later chapters. Thanks for reading![Chapter 13] Sorry about not posting much this last week. University has been keeping me busy, and thus I haven't had a chance to update this story a lot. I'm going to tell you now, that even though I'm in Computer Science, it's hard writing a story about programming in easy to understand terms. Even so, I will keep writing. Please let me know if this story is becoming too technical, and I'll try to keep out the complexities of coding... Also I'll be uploading two chapters tonight as a reward for you being so patient with me. Coding Genius Chapter 13 They had finally made it to one of the castle's many guest rooms. Juni was happy to see that the room contained all the essentials. The room contained a desk in the shape of a capital F, a large bed, and a lamp in the shape of a thumb. Even in this room, it reminded Juni of how eccentric Floop was. \"You can leave your suitcase anywhere in here.\"Floop told Juni. Juni placed his heavy suitcase at the foot of the bed. He then placed his spider monkey and Ralph on the F shaped desk. \"Well, now that your suitcase has been taken care of, do you want to get started on learning how to code, or would you rather take a tour of the castle?\"Floop asked. \"Well, I'm feeling pretty exhausted after the ride here, so a tour of the castle would be nice.\"Juni replied. \"Then a tour of the castle it shall be.\"Floop said. Floop led Juni past some rooms which Juni remembered from his first mission, other rooms were entirely new. Floop and Juni stopped in front of the Virtual Room. \"Once you have made sure that a program you have designed is working, you'll test some of them here. Depending on what the program is, you might even see a virtual program of your code.\"Floop said. \"You'll also be testing out some programs on robots.\"Floop excitedly mentioned. \"Sounds great!\"Juni said enthusiastically. Floop ended the tour by taking Juni past the basement, where the dungeon had been located. It now contained several beds in which the robot children could sleep. Thanks for reading. See you at Chapter 14![Chapter 14] No starting author note this time. Coding Genius Chapter 14 By the time Floop had finished showing Juni around the castle, it was fairly close to supper time. Together, they walked back to the castle's banquet hall. They talked about the various things that had happened in their lives on their way to the banquet hall. Floop talked about how popular his show was, and keeping tabs on what Alexander Minion was up to. Juni talked about how he had decided to leave the OSS, and his detective agency. Finally, Juni talked about how he had started having weird feelings. \"It feels like there is something missing in my gut.\"Juni explained. \"How so?\"Floop replied. \"I don't know, but this started ever since my family and the OSS shut down Game Over.\"Juni stated. \"Let's continue talking about this over food\"Floop said, as the Carmen and Juni robots brought them bowls of spaghetti and meatballs. \"Game Over was the giant Toymaker robot mission, right?\" Floop asked. \"Yeah, that's the one.\"Juni replied. \"Well, I'm sure that whatever the feeling is, you'll find out what's causing it.\"Floop said. \"How so?\" asked Juni. \"Coding usually delves into your heart, and the program that you make will depend on what is in your heart, and what's on your mind.\"Floop answered. \"Thanks for listening to my problem.\" said a relieved and happy Juni. \"No problem. Anytime\"Floop responded. Well now Floop has learned of the feeling that Juni is experiencing. Will Juni ever be free of this feeling, and what is causing this feeling? Find out the answers in an upcoming chapter of Coding Genius! Thanks for reading.[Chapter 15] Hello everyone. Sorry about the delay. This is one of the better chapters, and hopefully I'll be posting more frequently now. I'm sorry about the HUGE delay, but that's life. Anyways I'll try to post every 2nd week, but no promises. I have more chapters in my brain, but I'm nowhere near done this story. I'm just trying to make sure that there are no plot holes and that it doesn't become too nitty gritty with all the technical details. Anyways, as always I hope you enjoy it! By the time Juni and Floop had finished eating supper, it was already eight-thirty. Juni felt really tired, so he bid Floop a goodnight and headed off for his bedroom. He got changed into his pyjamas. As soon as his head felt the softness that was his pillow, he fell fast asleep. Juni had a dream that night. In his dream, he felt the weird feeling was over him again. He also noticed that he was in a room filled with computer and code which appeared dark purple. These bits of code were floating all around him. He felt as though someone was watching him. Juni turned to see who was looking at him. He saw a person that looked like someone he knew. He couldn't tell who it was at first. Juni tried to make out the person's features, and slowly the person's features and clothes changed. \"Who are you?\" Juni asked. \"I'm D…\"came the person's voice. Juni didn't hear anything after that though, because he woke with a start. \"Well that was an odd dream. I wonder what caused that. It was probably the food from supper. Anyways, I wonder what it means? Who was that person in my dream.\" Juni thought. Juni looked at his spy watch, which was the only gadget, apart from Ralph that he had gotten to keep. His watch told time now, because Machete had upgraded it. It read nine-thirty am. Okay, so a pretty neat chapter. I'm kinda proud of this one myself, but my writing probably still could use a bit of improvement. Anyways, thanks again for asking me to continue this AMAZING story. Without all of the reviews and comments I've been getting lately, I would probably come back to this much much later, so a huge shout out to all the fans of this story. I should probably have another chapter up tonight time permitting.[Chapter 16] New chapter coming Sunday August 3rd! ","Summary":" Hello readers. Welcome to the first story of nintendofan10039. I don't consider myself to be a stro"},{"Movie":"Batman: Under the Red Hood","Title":"What If Kim and Jason","Author":"imaninja41","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7588924","Passage":"[Chapter 1] It had been about three weeks since I had told Dick and my parents. Since then, Alfred and Bruce had found out too. Alfred was concerned, but happy for me, Bruce, who could know? I didn't know what to do any more. I was getting mood swings and Mom helped me with my eating habit's a lot. She had me wanting to just… pig out on bacon burgers and milk shakes. The food I had to eat wasn't always that good, but it was for the baby and I could stomach it. Jason knew something was wrong, he wasn't stupid. I had managed to avoid his questions so far, sell him some cheap excuse like I wished I didn't have to lie to my parents. That bought him for awhile, but he saw through it eventually. Why wouldn't he? He's Jason Todd. I was sitting in my room, reading a book a loud while rubbing my stomach. I liked to think of it as a bed time story, since it was almost bed time for me. Mom said no crime fighting while pregnant. I didn't like it, but I didn't argue, She was the expert on these things. I finished the book and rubbed my stomach a little. It hadn't grown much in the month and a half I had it, but it was noticeable enough. I heard a noise down stairs, the door opening and some one walking in. \"Mom, is that you?\" I asked. No answer. I stood up, walking to my room door. \"Dad, you home?\" Mom had gone to teach her gymnastics class while Dad had gone to the bank to cash a check. Still no answer. I frowned, grabbing my butterfly knife and heading out to the living room. \"Some one here?\" I asked. No one answered. I took a deep breath, and walked to the stair way. \"I can hear you, no who's here?\" Silence. I sighed, gripping the butterfly knife tightly, and stepping down the stairs one step at a time. I reached the bottom. The door was wide open, the lights all off. I looked around, but the tinted windows didn't let much light in. I held the knife ready, nad grabbed a gun off the shelf, it wasn't loaded but most people in Gotham are idiots. They see a gun, they think it's loaded. Jason had told me that once. I walked over to the door, closing it slowly and looking around, I couldn't see any one, but my gut and common cense told me they were here. \"I'm going to count to ten, and then I'm going to start shooting.\" I said, holding the gun up like I had so many times before. I stepped forward a little, walking step by step to the front desk, that's where a thief would go. Suddenly, hands shot out at me from the dark, they grabbed the gun, yanking the knife away, and pulled me back into a body, I struggled, about to scream, when they slapped a hand over my mouth, yanking me to make me be still. I panted, trying to put my leg behind theirs, but a pair of lips on my ear stopped me. \"Struggling is useless Kimmy.\" Jason whispered, nuzzling his face into my neck. I relaxed, smiling under his hand. I lightly touched his hand, and he moved it away. \"Jason, you nearly gave me a heart attack!\" He chuckled. \"Yeah, you should be watching your blood pressure for awhile, shouldn't you?\" I raised an eyebrow, that was kind of a random thing to say. \"Jason? What are you talking about?\" He chuckled, wrapping his hands around my waist as he gently walked me over to the front counter, and then pointed to some thing on it. \"Look what I found Kim.\" I looked at it closely, and then froze. It was the pregnancy test I had taken. The little pink plus was still there. I didn't move, I didn't say anything. I just stared at it, wishing it would just disappear. Jason's hands tightened, pulling me closer to him. \"Did you think you could hide it for much longer?\" His hands went from my hips to my stomach, stroking it gently. I stared at the floor, was he happy about it? Did he want to keep the baby? I know I loved it, I couldn't wait to hold it and smile at it. But Jason wasn't me, Jason was unpredictable. He might want it, he might not. He might want to put it up for adoption, or maybe even abortion. There was no way I could do that. I started trembling as his hands moved slowly, circling around the bump on my stomach and then rubbing it directly. \"Did you think I wouldn't notice the way your body was changing? Or how you're eating differently? Or how you haven't been patrolling anymore? Or even better, how your mom bought diapers today?\" His hands tightened on my stomach, and then relaxed, rubbing it gently again. \"Jason…\" I said quietly, not sure what else to say. His lips went to my ear again, kissing it lightly and then he said, \"Yes Kimmy?\" \"I… I'm sorry.\" I mumbled. He turned me around, glaring right into my eyes. I swallowed, what was he going to do? Was he going to yell at me? He must be angry. He lifted me easily, putting me in the counter and putting his hands on either side of me. He leaned in closer, still glaring at me. \"When were you planning on telling me? If you were planning on telling me at all. Did you think I didn't care? Oh, hi Jason guess what? I'm pregnant and you're going to be a Daddy. Is that so hard to say?\" He snapped. I flinched, looking away from him. \"I'm sorry. I don't know what I was thinking. I didn't know how you would react, and I couldn't handle it if you got angry at me because of it.\" He gently grabbed my chin, tilting my head up to look at him. His gaze softened, and he sighed, \"I'm not angry.\" \"… You're not?\" I asked hesitantly. \"No, I'm not.\" He put his hand on my stomach again, stroking it with his thumb. \"I'm… I think I'm happy.\" \"Happy?\" I asked. He looked up at me, \"Yeah, I think so.\" He went back to rubbing my stomach, and for a long time, neither of us spoke. Finally, he bent down, kissing the small bump and then sighed, \"I don't think I can do it.\" \"Do what?' I asked, leaning forward. \"Be a father.\" He said, looking up at me, \"I'm not the most… fatherly guy around.\" he looked down at the bump again, just staring at it. This wasn't about my fears anymore. I wasn't scared, Jason was happy with the baby. I put a hand on his shoulder, \"Jason Todd, you're one of the bravest men I know. You've always been there for me, and I know that you'll be there for our baby, don't be scared.\" He looked up at me, smiling, then back down at the bump. \"So, what are we gonna call this little guy?\" I thought for a moment, \"Jason Junior?\" Jason shook his head, \"Nah, lets give the kid something original.\" He picked me up, carrying me up the stairs and into my room, \"How about Jack?\" \"No.\" I said, \"It sounds to plain… we could name him after Dick.\" \"There is no way I am naming my son Richard, because you know, one way or another, we'll end up calling him Dick.\" He said, setting me down on my bed. I shrugged, \"Worth a shot.\" \"How about Spencer?\" He asked. I thought for a moment, \"That's a possibility. There's also Jake.\" \"How about Carlos?\" he asked. \"Kevin.\" I shot back. \"James.\" He offered. I shook my head, \"This is hard.\" He chuckled, jumping onto the bed next to me and running a hand trough my hair. \"We've got plenty of time.\" I nodded, looking down at my stomach, and a completely evil idea crossed my mind. \"What if it's a girl?\" Jason froze, and I smirked, \"She'd probably have black hair, since red hair is a recessive gene. Blue eyes, since green eyes are a recessive gene too.\" Jason didn't laugh, didn't smile. \"My hair isn't black.\" I raised an eyebrow, \"You never told me that.\" He shrugged, leaning down and pulling part of it aside so I could see the roots. \"Well, I'm a red head too.\" \"OK then, our little girl would have red hair and blue eyes.\" I said, smiling. Jason frowned, and I continued, \"I wonder how old she'll be when she has her first crush.\" Jason stiffened, and I had to hold back laughter. \"Wonder what he'll look like? Blonde hair and dreamy brown eyes maybe?\" Jason put a hand around my waist, and cleared his throat, clearly wanting to change the subject. \"Oh, wonder who she'll marry.\" He snapped, grabbing the little bump desperately, and glaring at me, \"First of all, I know it's going to be a boy, second of all, even if it is a girl, she will never, ever, not in a million years like, let alone, crush, on a boy .\" He said, spitting the word out. I chuckled, kissing his cheek. \"Keep telling yourself that Jason, you just keep telling yourself that.\" Jason's grip on my stomach tightened, glaring at me, then, a dangerous smirk spread over his face. \"Oh, don't you worry Kim. I will personally take care of any male who so much as smiles at her.\" My smile fell. If I was going to have a girl, I probably just ruined her love life. For your own sake kid, you better be a boy.[Chapter 2] Three o clock in the hospital, screaming in pain, trying to push my child out of me. Doesn't that sound delightful? It's horrible! I'm tired, I'm hungry, and I'm pretty sure I'm breaking my husband's hand. Jason didn't cringe, but I knew he was in pain too. I didn't care, he put this in me, and he was going to suffer too. \"I'LL KILL YOU FOR THIS JASON!\" I screamed. \"You said you wanted a family.\" He whispered, trying to not make to much noise. \"YOU DID THIS TO ME!\" I yelled, screaming as the pain increased. \"Mrs. Todd, please, focus on pushing.\" The nurse instructed. \"I'LL PUSH YOUR RIBS INTO YOU'RE LUNGS IF YOU DON'T STOP TELLING ME TO PUSH!\" I shouted. The nurse busied herself, and then finally looked up, \"The baby is crowning, sir would you like to see?\" Jason raised an eyebrow, \"Uh, sure.\" He looked over in between my legs and his eyes bulged, \"Oh God.\" He ripped his hand away from me, and dashed to the edge of the bed, grabbing the waist basket, and dry heaving into it several times. He looked back up at the nurse, \"Get it out of her! Please, dear God, just get that thing out!\" The nurse looked taken back, but went back to work, as did I. I'll slap him later. After several minutes (Which felt like hours) I finally felt complete and utter relief, as a babies scream pierced through the air. \"Congratulations.\" The nurse said, wrapping the baby up and handing it to me. \"It's a girl.\" Jason stood up, getting a hold of himself, and slowly walking over to me, looking at the little bundle. I couldn't help but stare at her, she looked so much like Jason, I could see it already. Jason took in a deep breath, \"Oh my God, she's so beautiful.\" I smiled down at the little girl, holding her closer as her screamed ceased. She opened her eyes, looking around in wonder, trying to understand what was going on. Why was she here? What were all these strange sounds? Who were these people staring at her? Why had she been taken from the one place she had felt safe and brought into this cold loud place? Cars honked outside, and the baby started fretting, crying and screaming her head off. Jason carefully took the baby into his hands, rocking it back and forth slowly. \"Shh, it's OK baby, that's just Gotham. Might wanna get used to it.\" He cooed softly. I stared at him in wonder, wow, Jason was going to be a great Dad. The nurse spoke up, \"What are you going to name her?\" Jason shrugged, not looking away from our little girl, \"We planned on it being a boy, we were going to name him Justin.\" A thought suddenly occurred to me, \"What about Justine?\" He looked up at me, and then smiled. \"Fine with me.\"[Chapter 3] Jason had insisted on moving completely out of Gotham, away from all the crime that plagued Gotham City itself, and into a small subdivision in Star City. The neighborhood was very nice, the people were friendly and the streets were clean. As soon as Kim saw Jason packing his costume and weapons to take to the new house, she knew he would still patrol every night. Figured he wouldn't catch much more than pick pockets and muggers in their very small neighborhood, but whatever made him content. She knew the quiet life wasn't exactly Jason's style, and he was sacrificing a lot. He claimed it was to keep the baby safe. Kim could believe that, but she knew he wanted her away from the fight, safe at home where he could come back to her in the evenings, sure the worst injury she would have gotten would be a paper cut with the occasional cut from a steak knife. Jason had a job as a mechanic, and he had convinced her to become a homemaker, thinking the baby would do better with one parent who was always around. Kim didn't like the idea at first, thinking she could do better, have a cooler job, one that people looked at as important, until she realized how much work being a Mom was. Every day Jason went to work and Kim would be at home alone with baby Justine. It was hard, especially since she took care of the house as well as the baby. When Jason came home he was usually to tired to help with house work, not to mention he left the house at midnight for patrolling around their small neighborhood, sometimes even the neighborhoods around theirs. Kimberly Mathilda loved a challenge, and Justine gave her countless ones. Her dignity grew, she learned to hold her head high where ever she went, especially when she was covered in spit up at Wal-Mart. They had disappeared from Gotham about three months ago, dropping off the radar. She sent traceless calls to her parents, and letters with no return address. She sent baby pictures of course, and she knew from the camera she had hidden in her old house her parents had fallen in love with the granddaughter they had never met. Justine had been born last month, and that's when they had moved in here. They didn't know many people around them, but that's what they were trying to find out now. At a neighborhood BBQ. Jason was a fantastic actor, playing up the American Dad act like he was born to do it. He helped the other guys setting up tables and cooking the steaks, burgers, and fries, laughing at dad jokes. Kim was smiling at him, cradling Justine in her arms while Jason and her were introduced to a man who was thinking about moving into the house across from them. His name was Russell Andrews, little shorter than Jason with light brown crew cut hair and brown eyes. He was polite, and all he really wanted was to make friends and have a good time. \"Yeah,\" Jason said, smiling at him, \"Everyone in the neighborhood loves that house.\" David, a pure blood hillbilly man laughed, nudging Jason with his elbow, \"Yeah, cause everyone in the neighborhood has that house!\" Kim and Jason laughed, and Justine stirred from the light slumber she had fallen into. She opened her eye, blinking at her mother, and babbled out something, sounding aggravated to be woken up. She kicked her feet violently, demanding to not be ignored. Justine wasn't two full months old yet, and she already had her father's temper. She would be a handful as a teenager. Kim bounced Justine up and down softly, and the baby just fixed her mother with a look that said 'stop it right now!'. Kim stopped, chuckling at her baby, and Jason carefully took Justine, balancing her in his arms so her head rested on his shoulder, and made funny faces at her. Justine stared at him, and then grabbed a fist full of his hair, yanking him towards her. Jason grunted, trying to tug away but Justine was having none of that. She gripped harder, and squealed, protesting being woken up in such a way as laughter. \"Ow, Justy, cut it out. Pleeaaase?\" Her father begged. Justine contemplated this for a moment, gave one last tug, and let his hair slip away. Jason beamed at his little girl, \"That's my girl.\" He handed her back to Kim, and turned to his snickering new friends, all deeply humored by Jason acting like a whiney little girl. David smiled as a woman wearing a purple sundress walked up. She had a blonde bob and was wearing light make up, enhancing her features to make her look striking. \"Jason and Kim, this is Beth Andrews, she's Russell's wife. She's a commodities broker, she works down at Filer's Investments.\" Kim smiled at Beth, \"Oh, a commodities broker, that sounds intriguing.\" Beth chuckled, \"Well it can be quite a challenge. But I gotta be honest, I eat it for breakfast! Ah, what do you do Kim?\" Kim smiled, \"I'm a homemaker.\" Beth's eyes glazed over a bit, a reaction Kim was used to getting by now. \"Well, we only have one child,\" Kim looked down at Justine, who was eyeing Beth's shiny sapphire ear rings with a gleam in her eye. \"But she can be quite the hand full.\" Justine's face suddenly shifted, and she spit up on Kim's tank top. Beth got a slightly appalled look on her face, and looked around for something. Kim, desperate for a new friend, tried to rekindle the conversation, \"But honestly, motherhood is a lot more-\" \"Uh huh, that's nice.\" Beth said, turning and walking over to another woman and her boyfriend, who were dressed similarly to Beth. -difficult than I thought.\" Kim finished, turning back to Jason who had been talking to Russell and had missed the exchange. Kim left Jason to talk to his new friend, and found herself a few other mothers, some with teenagers, some with little seven year olds, and some with babies like Justine. She struck up a conversation with them, exchanging stories and jokes. After several moments, she heard laughter floating across the yard, and she looked over her shoulder to see Beth, laughing about something, \"Throw away my prime years chasing after a bunch of snotty kids? No thank you!\" Kim glared at the back of the woman's head, not liking her at all. The other mothers turned to see what she was looking at, and quickly picked up on the conversation. They held their children a little closer, offended at the woman's loud conversation. \"Hello, no thanks!\" Beth said, making obnoxious hand gestures and facial expressions. \"Hello I want to do something with my life!\" \"Wait a minute!\" Kim said, standing up and facing Beth defensively. Beth and the people she was talking to turned to look at her, eyes curious. Several other people turned to look, Jason being one of them, along with his new friends. Kim fixed her eyes on Beth's challenging her and her opinions openly. \"You consider raising a family, nothing?\" The mother's behind her also glared at Beth, obviously thinking the same thing. Beth wasn't fazed. She was used to being challenged, and so comfortable with it Kim could tell she had never lost a battle of wills. Kim was about to change that. Beth smirked at her. \"Well it's fine, if you're not suited for more… substantial things.\" Everyone's attention was on the pair now, some with Beth, others with Kim, and the rest wondering what the heck was going on, and when was the cat fight going to break out. Kim walked towards Beth slowly, \"Do you have any idea how much suffering would fail to take root if more people were just good parents?\" \"Well I- uh-\" \"What's more important than that?\" Kim questioned, walking more confidently. \"What kind of job?\" \"Um-\" Beth was a loss for what to say, and Kim wasn't going to let her recover. She had her on thin ice and she intended to hammer her hard now, not wait for her to gain stability. \"What about a job saving lives?\" \"Uh-\" \"Is that important?\" \"Yeah-\" \"What about a job risking my life?\" \"I-\" \"What about confronting evil on a daily basis for years; just so people like you could sleep in safety and security?\" Kim asked, now right in front of Beth. Eye to eye with her, she dared Beth with eyes and mouth to defy her, or even attempt to. \"Would you consider that kind of job substantial?\" \"Well, yes, I would.\" She said, fear in her eyes. She wasn't used to a stay at home mom biting back. Kim stood straight, glaring at her, chin nodded in superiority. \"Well that's the job I gave up for my new job: raising a family. And nobody is going to tell me that it is any less important. Especially a fresh out of college broker who has yet to experience one true problem in her life. Whether it's going through the fear of becoming a mother or the complete terror of losing the man you loved, and losing him to death of all things, twice!\" Beth's eyes widened, \"I am so, so sorry I meant no offence. What on Earth did you used to do ?\" If Kim hadn't been a trained vigilante she would have frozen, afraid she might have just given up her secret. Fortunately though, she was. \"I was a marine for two years. I enlisted as soon as I was able, wanting to put my life on the line for people I hadn't even met . I got flown out to Iraqi, and let me tell you, you don't know exactly what fear is, or what people are really capable of until you see them coming at your face with a gun or a knife, trying to kill you so you never see anyone you care about ever again! You know why I did all of that?\" \"I-\" \"Because I love this country and I wanted to make sure my family would be able to live here with no fear of having their rights taken away. That is why I did what I did every day. That's why I quit, to come back here and raise my daughter to not be afraid to stand up for what she believes in, or for people who can't!\" Justine's hand suddenly shot out, and she gripped into Beth's right ear ring for all she was worth, yanking it towards her, pulling it out of the clasp and clutching the shiny object with great glee, squealing. Berth cried, out, gripping her ear in pain. Kim gently wrestled the ear ring out of Justine's grasp, handing it back to Beth. \"You should thank her, I was going to rip out your cheap extensions.\" Kim calmly turned around, walking away with her head held high, back to the other mothers who were looking at her with pride, and at Beth with disdain. David whistled low, and slapped Jason on the shoulder, \"Jason, you are one lucky man.\" Jason smiled at his wife, she had done something far more dangerous then being a Marine. If he squinted his eyes, he could still see the spandex and leather that used to cover her as she had jumped roof tops. \"Thanks, I know.\" Russell shrugged at Jason, \"I'll talk to my wife later, her actions were a bit uncalled for. Hey, you play poker much?\" \"Not lately, but I used to play it a lot few years back.\" Jason said honestly. He used to live off of card game winnings in Crime Alley. \"Wanna come over this week end? We could get a group together.\" Russell offered. Jason nodded, \"Sounds good.\" He wasn't used to the whole 'Small neighborhood Dad' business, but poker was something he could do.[Chapter 4] Justine squealed in protest, fighting her father by kicking and struggling, she was not happy about having to get a bath. \"Come on Justy, please?\" Jason begged, trying to lower her into the sink filled with water. She squealed again, thrashing around and splashing just about everything but herself with water. She babbled out something no one could understand, and gripped onto her father's arm, refusing to go into the water. \"But Justy, you stink, you haven't let me wash you in two days!\" Jason protested. \"Besides, bath time can be fun.\" They had been having a fun day so far, playing in the back yard with the Tonka construction trucks Jason had gotten her last week. But now she was covered in dirt, and she loved it. However, her mother did not, and as punishment for getting her dirty, Jason had to bathe her. Justine tried to bite down on his arm, but she didn't have teeth. So she bit him with her gums. He chuckled at that, and grabbed the sprayer, and hosed her down as fast as he could while she thrashed and squealed. He grabbed the sponge, trying to remove as much dirt and sweat form the baby as he could. Five months old and he kid loved nothing more than dirt. \"Please Justy, just do this one thing for me?\" He begged, pouring the soap in her arm and scrubbing carefully as she screamed her protest. Finally, he rid her of dirt, and dried her off, sighing to himself. He set her on the counter, and turned around to drain the sink, when a coffee cup hit the back of his head. He turned around to see Justine, a smirk gracing her small lips. \"Did you just-… never mind.\" He mumbled putting the coffee cup back on the counter. Five months old and she already had his smirk and impossible attitude. Dear god, how long before she stole tires off Green Arrows car? Considering they lived in Star City, instead of Gotham, pretty soon. He quickly picked Justine up, carrying her to her small room that consisted of a rocking chair, a changing table, and a cradle. Unlike most baby rooms, all the furniture was black in here. Sure they had toyed with the idea of pink or white, maybe even lavender, but then they figured, why kind themselves? They all knew who she really was. He laid her down on the changing table, and looked for something to change her into, since the overalls she had been wearing were to dirty to put back on. H grabbed black onsie he found, and quickly put if on her, only then realizing it was black with a yellow bat symbol on the front, \"Kimberley…\" Justine reached for him, demanding to be picked up. He scooped her up, and she wrapped her arms around his neck, and buried her face in his shoulder, making a sound between a yawn and a baby babble, she was tired. He hummed a little, walking over to the rocking chair making sure he walked without bumping or jostling the five month old. He sat down, humming softly and rocking slowly. She sighed, content, and loosened her hold, just nuzzling her face into the crook of his neck, and slowly falling asleep. Jason smiled, holding her a little tighter. This was his baby girl, his little Justine. She was already a lot like him, and he could tell she was going to be a real hard case. Who knew what trouble she was going to stir up? Maybe put a piece of paper on Green Arrow's back that said 'I'm gay for Red Arrow', or maybe even take a permanent marker to the Arrow signal to make it look like the bat symbol when they turned it on. Well, at least since they were in Star City, she couldn't get into that much trouble, right? No Penguin for her to paint his nose to make it look like a carrot, no Two Face for her to replace is coin with a Canadian coin, and most importantly, no Batman or Joker for her to get caught up in the family business. \"Perfect.\" He mumbled to himself. The phone rang, and Jason carefully got up, setting the sleeping baby down on the changing table and quickly answering it. It was just Russell, calling about their poker game tonight. \"Yeah, it's still on… You got Bobby and David to come too right?… Great… yeah, see ya tonight.\" He hung up, going back into the babies room, just in time to see Justine crawling to the edge of her changing table, leaning over the side. In one completely paralyzing moment, he saw her fall. \"NO!\" He shouted quickly, throwing his arms under her and yanking her away from the ground and into the crook of his neck, holding her tightly and taking a deep breath, looking at the ground as if it was covered in poisoned snakes trained to kill red headed babies. He pulled Justine's face away from his neck, looking at her. Her face was filled with fear, she knew she had been in danger. For a baby, she was smart, she had known something was wrong the minute she started falling. \"It's OK.\" Jason cooed. \"You're safe now, Daddy's here. Daddy won't let you get hurt.\" He cradled her in his arms, stroking her hair and waiting until she fell asleep. He laid her in the cradle this time, watching her intently, guarding her from any more dangers. Kim came in a little later, seeing him nearly in pieces. \"What happened?\" \"She fell.\" He said, \"I caught her, sure, but it was my fault she fell. I just put her down on the table for a minute to answer the phone… I didn't think she would…\" Kim hugged him, \"Jason, it's Ok. You messed up, we all do. You'll learn, and so will I. We're new at this and it's granted we're going to make mistakes. The point is we learn from them. Next time, take her with you instead of putting her down, or put her in the cradle like you're supposed to.\" Jason smiled, hugging her back, and then scooped her up, taking her out of the baby's room and into theirs. He set her down on the bed, closed the door, and tackled her, pinning her to the bed. She gave a short cry of surprise, but his lips cut her off. She moaned, and he pulled away, nuzzling his face into her neck. \"I love you.\" He whispered, sending shivers up her spine as his breath tickled her neck. \"I love you too.\" She said.[Chapter 5] \"Come on Justy, you can do it!\" Jason encouraged, helping his daughter stand up, and then letting her go. Justine wobbled, tried to put one foot foreword, and then started to fall. Jason caught her of course, and then started over. He had been trying to teach her to walk for about half an hour now, but she didn't seem all that interested. However, she seemed to be able to tell this was of some importance, and did try to walk. In order help her walk easily he had dressed her in her favorite outfit, Nightwing pajamas, the top looked like the real Nightwing costume, but the pants had mini Nightwing symbols all over them. Jason sighed, and tried again to get her to stand up, but she had had enough! She smacked his hand, and squealed in protest. Jason covered his ears, \"OK! OK! I get it, you wanna take a break. Fine!\" He said, holding up his hands in surrender. She stared at him for a minute, before breaking into a one toothed grin and giggling. Jason smirked, shaking his head, \"Alright, what ya wanna do? Justine looked towards the small basket in the corner of her room, filled with small cardboard books. Jason nodded, grabbing her favorite one, a small book make of cloth. \"My cuddly cloth dinosaur book.\" He read. He pulled her onto his lap, opening the book. \"Pee Rex.\" he said, pointing to a picture of a T-Rex with green spots all over it. \"Tri carrot tops.\" He said, and Justine slapped the picture of a triceratops with carrots for horns. \"You like that one?\" He teased, he knew she hated carrots, she always spit out the mashed ones he tried to give her. He flipped the page, pointing to the next one, \"Spottyosauraus.\" She hummed a little, and he chuckled, pointing to the next one. \"Rainbowodon.\" She cocked her head to the side, staring at it. He flipped the page, pointing to the last one, \"Sunnydactill!\" Justin pushed the book away, and hit Jason's arm, \"boo!\" Jason picked her up, \"OK, lunch time it is.\" He carried her into the kitchen, put her in her high chair, and pulled out a Gerber can of… butternut squash and lima beans. \"No.\" Jason said firmly, pushing the jar back into the fridge. \"I'm a father, not a health nut.\" He walks over to the fridge, and pulls out the remains of his dinner last night, KFC mashed potatoes. He heated them up, mixed gravy in, and gave Justin a spoonful. She paused for a moment, before opening her mouth wide, wanting more. Jason chuckled, \"Just wait until you're allowed to eat the chicken.\" He gives her another spoonful, and she eats quickly, until soon, it's all gone. She babbles, wanting more, but there's none left, so Jason just fixes her a bottle. Pretty soon, she's done, and ready to keep playing. Jason picks her up, and puts her on the floor in the living room, sighing, \"I bet your mom five bucks I could get you walking by the end of the week… guess I'm gonna have to lose.\" Suddenly, the front door opened, and Kim walked in. She set her stuff down in the kitchen, \"Jason?\" She called. \"We're in here.\" He answered. She walked into the living room, and smiled, \"How's training her to walk coming along?\" He shrugged, \"Fine.\" Kim sat down on the floor, five feet form Justine, \"Mommy's home.\" Justine reached for her, but her mother refused to pick her up, she babbled something, and then got to her hands and knees, then, suddenly stood up straight, and toddled over to her mother. Kim grabbed her, holding her close as Justine babbled something, seeming very happy. Kim turned to Jason, who smirked. \"She's on my side.\" Kim sighed, handing Jason five dollars. \"You win.\" He smirked at her, mischievous, \"Do I get another prize?\" She stood up, holding Justine. \"No.\" She said, walking out of the room, \"You'll be lucky if you get a kiss from me in the next three weeks.\" Jason sat on the floor, stunned. Frustrated, he growled, \"Man, I can't ever win with this woman!\"[Chapter 6] As soon as Jason hears crying form the baby monitor, he gets up, and tells a groaning Kim, \"I've got this one, go to sleep.\" He walks out of the room, in sweat pants and a muscle t-shirt, yawning and stretching, know Justine will keep him up for awhile. As soon as he enters Justine's room, he knows something is wrong. The presence in the room, it's familiar. He walks over to the crib slowly, the blankets that Kim had carefully tucked around their baby girl had been ripped away. Justine hadn't done it, her little feet couldn't have been able to kick the blankets that far off of her. Someone had ripped them off of her, and had seen her. He looks over to the window, it's closed, but the lock had been broken from the outside. Someone was in his house. Normally, Jason would panic, but he knows the feeling of being watched by those cold eyes so well. He carefully pulls the blankets back over his daughter, and gathers her up in his arms, before turning around and coming face to face with the intruder. Batman. Jason glares at him, \"Get. Out.\" The glare he receives shows him that's not going to happen. Batman wants answers, and Batman will get them. \"Who's the mother?\" Has asks, but he know full well who it is. \"Don't ask me pointless questions.\" Jason snaps, and Justine cries more, kicking, wanting the yelling to stop. Jason strokes what little hair she has, trying to calm her so Kim won't come in. That's the last thing he needs. \"You and Kim left Gotham.\" Bruce says, \"Just disappeared.\" \"What do you think happened?\" He asked. \"You got her pregnant.\" Batman growls, \"And then you told her the best thing to do was to leave, leave her family, friends, and her job.\" \"To protect Justine.\" Jason says firmly, holding the girl closer, as if trying to protect her from Bruce. \"The farther she is from Gotham, the better I'll be able to sleep at night.\" \"So you brought her to Star City.\" \"Cleaner, quieter, and just enough action for me to not get bored when I don't have to be around Justine every day.\" Jason snaps, Not that I mind being around her so much. \"So you take her away from her family too.\" Bruce said, disgusted. Jason could care less. \"To protect her.\" He said firmly. \"And don't talk to me like I'm ruining her life.\" \"You're certainly doing a pretty good job of controlling it.\" Bruce says, growling. \"When she's old enough to make her own decisions, I'll let her!\" Jason screams, and Justine screams to. Jason turns his attention away form Bruce, to Justine. He holds her carefully, talking to her calmly, \"Shh, Justy, don't cry.\" He says, holding her carefully. \"Shh, please don't cry Justy.\" He rocks her back and forth softly, each word he speaks, it's coated with fatherly love and affection. Bruce watches silently, and eventually, the door opens, and Kim is standing there, looking at Bruce with accusation. \"You, shut up.\" She walks over to Jason, taking Justine. After being held by her mother, she calms down, crying less. Kim turns to glare at Bruce, \"You woke her up.\" \"You left.\" He counters. \"I did it for her.\" Kim defends, as Jason pulls her and Justine closer. \"You did it for him .\" Batman growls, and Jason looks at the ground, hurt. The man he looked at as his father, talking about him as if he was a piece of garbage. Kim walks over to Bruce defiantly, \"You get out of my house, right now! When your ready to talk to me without the mask, knock on the front door!\" Batman glares at her, about to say something, but she smacks him right across the face. \"Get out!\" She orders, and the baby screams again, just wanting the confusion to end! Batman leaves, and Jason takes Justine from Kim. \"You should go back to bed, I won't be able to sleep tonight anyway.\" \"Should I call work, tell them your sick?\" \"Yeah.\" Jason says halfheartedly, finally able to calm Justine down. He sat up with her for hours, watching the moon slowly move across the sky. He thought over what had happened, what he needed to do. Finally, when the sun finally peeked over the horizon, he looked down at the sleeping little girl in his arms. \"He'll never hurt you. No one will.\" He said, each word a commandment he was setting for his future life, no, his new mission. \"I will never let them.\"[Chapter 7] The sudden knocking was loud, obnoxious, and constant. Kim sighed, sitting Justine down on the floor, and walking out of the room. She headed to the front door, and opened it, revealing an overly excited Richard Grayson. \"Where is she?\" He squealed, sounding like a teenage girl. \"What?\" Kim asked. \"Where's Justine! I haven't ever seen her yet! Come on, where is she, I wanna see her!\" He begged. Some one behind Dick stepped foreword, Tim . \"Hey Kim, bet you're wondering how we found out.\" Dick ran inside, past Kim and into the living room. Kim turned to Tim, \"Kind of… yeah.\" \"Bruce told Alfred, Alfred told Dick, Dick told me, and he had his heart set on seeing his… well, niece I guess.\" Kim nodded slowly, and suddenly Dick's squeal of delight came from the living room, \"She's so cute!\" Kim and Tim walked into the living room, seeing Dick cuddling Justine with a huge smile on his face, and Justine wide eyed and mouth open, in shock. Kim laughed, \"Uh Dick, I think you're giving her childhood trauma\" Dick pulled away from Justine, smiling at her, and she stared at him, just trying to figure out who he was and why he was smiling all the time, and holding her even though she didn't know him. She turned to Kim, \"Mama!\" She said loudly. Kim picked her up, much to Dick's disappointment, and held her close, but angled her so she was looking at Tim. Tim gave her a small smile, \"Hi.\" She stared at him, and then grunted, reaching out to him. Kim handed her to Tim, who held her a little awkwardly. \"Uh, am I doing this right?\" Kim shook her head, \"Don't hold her under her arms, that hurts her. Cradle her.\" She positioned his arms a little better, and Justine settled into his arms comfortably. She stared up at Tim, and he stared down at her, smiling a little. She suddenly broke out into a grin that made him flinch. The cute little girl's face had suddenly turned into Jason's. She grabbed a fistful of his hair, and yanked hard. \"Ow!\" He complained, trying to pull away from her. Kim laughed, and Dick took her from Tim. \"That's one mean kid.\" Tim complained. \"Are you insane?\" Dick asked, cuddling Justine again. \"She's an angel! That's probably just her way of saying she likes you.\" Justine brought her hand across Dick's face, smacking him as hard as she could, and babbling excitedly, kicking and wiggling in his arms. He laughed, setting her down and she grabbed onto his knee, and then let go, stumbling across the floor. \"Come back here you little monkey!\" He said in baby talk, rushing after her. Tim turned to Kim, \"So, how's Jason?\" \"He's at work right now.\" She said. \"What work?\" Tim asked suspiciously. \"Well, he's a mechanic, he works weekdays at the Auto Shop down the street.\" She said. \"What does he do at night?\" He asked. \"Patrolling.\" She said, shrugging. Tim scoffed, \"You making sure he doesn't kill people? Or are you just crossing your fingers?\" She fixed him with a stern look, \"We have lived her for over a year, and the only things Jason has had to deal with are a few muggers and one rapist, which are all safely locked away in prison. Not in a morgue.\" Tim paused, \"I'm sorry.\" She shook her head, \"Forget it, it's your nature.\" \"And the fact he's nearly killed me?\" Tim asked. \"I've still got the scars.\" \"I'm not saying he's an angel.\" Kim said, trying to settle in the middle. \"And her?\" Time asked, \"She looks just like him.\" \"So? That's genetics.\" Kim debated. \"That's risky.\" Tim shot back. \"How so?\" She challenged. \"Kim.\" He began, knowing he was treading on dangerous soil. \"What if she turns out like him? Can you really deal with two trigger happy lunatics?\" Kim stiffened, and Tim knew she had taken it badly. \"Jason is not crazy,\" She said firmly, in a way that even Bruce wouldn't argue with. \"And Justine is a good kid. I can see a lot of myself in her already, and I am telling now, if you ever call either one of them crazy again, I will go trigger happy on you.\" \"Kim, you wouldn't-\" \"I've been raised to fire a gun without hesitation Timmy.\" She snapped, \"And you would do a very good job to remember that fact, and the fact I'm not exactly a Bat. I'll follow my own rules and morals thank you very much.\" Tim stared at her, and then nodded, \"OK.\" He sighed, looking around, and seeing two pistols hidden underneath a bookshelf on the far wall. He looked pointedly at them, \"What happens when she gets big enough to grab those?\" \"Then we'll move them.\" Kim said, shrugging. \"Jason likes to have some security that I'll be safe here while he's at work.\" Tim laughed, \"Stay at home Mom doesn't seem like your thing.\" \"When she can stay at home alone I'll find a job.\" Kim said, smiling at him. Tim hesitated for a moment, \"Well, if you ever need… a babysitter or something… I'll probably be able to… help you out.\" Kim smiled, \"Thanks Tim. You'll be her favorite uncle.\" Suddenly, they heard a scream come form the back yard. \"GET AWAY FROM MY BABY GRAYSON!\" Kim rushed outside, to see Jason pinning dick to the ground with one arm, Justine sitting off to the side, laughing uncontrollably. \"Jason!\" Kim shouted, \"Stop it, he was only playing with her!\" Jason shook his head, \"He was holding her upside down! That's not playing Kim, that's torture to a baby!\" Tim walked outside as well, and Jason glared at him, \"Great, do I have to beat up you too?\" Tim glared back, \"We were visiting our niece.\" \"Get out!\" Jason barked. \"Jason!\" Kim scolded, \"They came all the way here from Gotham City to see Justine. They haven't met her yet.\" Jason got off of Dick, scooping up Justine and walking over to Kim, \"NO, they came to keep tabs on us. Can we get no privacy anymore? First Bruce, now you two? What's it going to take for you to leave us alone.\" \"How about when you're either sane, or behind bars?\" Tim barked back. Jason raised a fist to hit Tim, but a sudden scream stopped him. \" Timmy !\" Justin shrieked, reaching out for him to hold her. Kim and Jason froze, while Tim just stared at Justine. Dick stood up, walking over, \"What's the big deal? I mean, that's not like, her first word, is it?\" \"Actually.\" Kim said slowly. \"First word.\" Jason said, staring dumbfounded at his daughter. \"Her first word was your name.\" he looked at Tim helplessly, then back at Justine, \"No, don't say Tim, say Daddy! Say Daddy!\" \"Timmy!\" She exclaimed again, reaching out for Tim, who gladly took her from Jason. \"Come on Justin.\" Tim said to the baby, \"Let's go watch cartoons while Mommy takes Daddy to therapy, huh?\" \"Timmy!\" She screamed again. Everyone stared at the two as they walked into the house. Kim was happy that Justine had finally spoken, Jason was ready to murder Tim, and all Dick had to say was, \"Did he just call her Justin?\" ,[Chapter 8] Getting Justine, or Justin as Tim called her, to talk had been a happy day for Kim, but the worst day of Jason's life. He sat on the couch, shaking his head, \"She said Tim… TIM!\" \"I know Jason.\" Kim said, sighing, \"He is her uncle, and you got her all riled up.\" \"Grayson got her all riled up!\" Jason snapped. \"He hung her upside down, by her feet!\" \"He was playing with her.\" Kim defended. \"That was torture!\" Jason said. \"A medieval torture strategy, she was screaming!\" \"Until then, that's the only way she ever knew how to communicate Jason.\" Kim explained. \"She was laughing, she liked it.\" \"No, she hates him! She has to hate him!\" Jason said desperately. \"They are not going to be friends, I forbid it!\" \"Trust me Jason, when she gets older, she'll hate him and Bruce.\" Kim promised. \"But you have to let her know them first, or else there's nothing to hate about them.\" Jason paused, \"Okay fine.\" \"Good, cause we're going on a date tonight, and Tim's babysitting.\" Kim said. \"No!\" Jason said, jumping up, \"No, no, no, no, no! For the love of God noooooooo!\" \"Jason, my entire life has started to revolve around Justine, and although I love her, it's not healthy for me or her. I am going on a date with you tonight, and that is that.\" \"She's to young for a babysitter!\" \"She's almost two!\" Kim snapped. \"My mother had the teenage girl next door babysitting me before I was one.\" \"Well that's your problem.\" Jason mumbled. Kim gave him a look, \"I will wear a dress, which will come above my knees, and will be low cut a the neck.\" Jason hesitated. \"Sleeveless.\" \"Deal.\" Kim said. \"And, it has to be blue.\" He said. Kim nodded, \"Fine. But no sparkles or feathers, or rhinestones.\" Jason nodded, \"Okay… get me a beer?\" Kim rolled her eyes, \"Uh huh.\" LATER THAT NIGHT: \"Emergency numbers are on the counter- oh who am I kidding, you know what to do if a guy tries to kill Justine right?\" Kim asked. \"Beat him to a pulp and call the cops after giving him a death threat that makes him pee his pants.\" Tim said. \"No you idiot!\" Jason said, rushing into the room, dressed in black slacks, a red button up shirt, and a black tie, \"You knock out the scum bag, leave him in the shed out back, and when I get home, you don't tell Bruce about the un-Godly screams or the gun shot you heard.\" Kim sighed, \"Tim, just don't let anything happen to her.\" She grabbed Jason, pulling him out of the house. Tim turned to Justine, who was sitting on the floor, wearing a black t-shirt and red overalls with a black bat symbol on the front pocket. He smiled down at her, \"What's up?\" She smiled, \"Timmy!\" Tim chuckled, scooping her up and carrying her to the living room. \"How about a movie? Barney or Barbie?\" He looked through the movies, but didn't find anything kid appropriate. He turned to Justine, \"Where are you movies Justin?\" Justin pointed to the bottom shelf, idly sucking on her dark blue pacifier. Tim looked down there, seeing several seasons of The Simpsons, South Park, and Family Guy. Tim's eyes widened, \"You watch this stuff?\" Justine grabbed a Simpsons case, holding it up. Tim shook his head, \"Uh… lets just play with your toys…\" Tim took out Justine's blocks, and showed her how to stack them. Justine grabbed one, and held it in her hand for a moment, before chucking it at Tim's head. Tim grabbed it in midair, narrowing his eyes into the Bat glare, but Justin just laughed, kicking her feet. Tim growled, \"You're his daughter all right. Pretty soon you're gonna be defying Batman, and running around with guns, and beating me with a crowbar-\" \"Which is exactly why I'm here.\" Came a deep voice Tim would know anywhere. Tim stood up, turning around, \"Bruce?\" Bruce stood there in a dark black sweater and kaki slacks. \"I'm not going to let her gro up with him Tim.\" Tim's eyes widened, \"You're… kidnapping Justine?\" Bruce paused, \"It's more complicated than that, but when you get right down to it… yes.\" \"But… this is her family.\" Tim said slowly. He had never really known Bruce to make a wrong decision, to cross a line that just shouldn't be crossed. \"Tim, do you really want her to be her father?\" Bruce asked. Tim hesitated, \"Well… no, but just because she lives with him-\" \"Think about it Tim, every girl idolizes her father, if she grows up with Jason as a father, what's going to happen when she adapts his morals by watching him live with his?\" Tim couldn't deny the numbers once he ran them, but he wished he could, \"She'll… well, she'll be him.\" \"I've let Jason do this to himself and to Kim, but I won't let her get caught up in this, she's a child, and I'm not going to let her be robbed of that.\" Justin staggered to her feet, wobbling a bit, before standing straight, and looking at Bruce's left leg. She toddled over to his leg, reaching it and grabbing onto it with a surprisingly strong grip. Her eyes traveled from his knee to his thigh, to his stomach, shoulders, then face. Her head tilted to the side, staring up at him with an unreadable expression. Tim bit his lower lip. No Bruce, this isn't right. She's a baby, and you're wrong. Justin suddenly bit down on Bruce's knee cap, not just a nibble, but she really chomped down, she was practically trying to dig his knee cap out with her four little teeth. Bruce didn't even wince, but Tim could see the pain in his eyes. He reached down, prying Justin's mouth off of his knee. He picked her up carefully, making her look him in the eye. She smiled a big toothy grin, revealing red streaks dancing across her teeth. Bruce's blood. \"Bruce!\" She exclaimed. Normally, a baby can't pronounce the 'r' for a long time, but Justine had nailed it the first try. Tim's eyes widened, now Kim was gonna have to deal with an even angrier Jason. He knew that Jason was going to hear her say Bruce's name, because Tim's decided not to let Bruce take her. Justin grabs Bruce's front bangs, yanking and giggling while she did it. Bruce just ran his thumb over the front of her overall pocket, tracing the bat symbol, lost in thought. Tim stepped forward, \"Bruce, just put her down.\" Bruce raised his eyebrow at Tim, who slowly wrapped his hands around Justine also, gently pulling her out of Bruce's hold. \"You're not taking her away Bruce, she's happy here.\" Bruce shook his head, \"She's to young to make that decision.\" \"She loves her father!\" Tim said, exasperated. \"Tell you what, if she grows up and starts acting against your code, then we'll consider taking her, but I don't think it's necessary to go that extreme yet.\" \"I can't risk that even beginning to happen.\" Bruce said, and stepped forward to take Justine from Tim, who was at such a loss at what to do. He didn't know if he should try to fight Bruce, of just let him take Justin and then go squeal to Jason immediately. Bruce grabbed Justine's shoulders, about to pull her from Tim's hold, suddenly, a shot rang out, and a bullet imbedded itself in the wall right next to Bruce's head. They both turned to see Jason, a glare on his face that was about ten times worse then the bat-glare. Tim had only seen that expression on Bruce's face twice before, once when Dick had been beaten to a bloody pulp by a group of thugs, and when Tim himself had nearly died at Jason's hands. Tim nearly peed his pants right there, because even his experience with the bat-glare could never prepare him for the daddy-bats-glare. \"You put my daughter down right now or this time I'll aim for the wall and hit you.\" Jason said, grinding out the threat with every intention of carrying it out. This time he was serious, father or not, he would kill Bruce. An uncomfortable silence settled over the three of them, Bruce was not going to be swayed with threats, Jason would die before he let his daughter be kidnapped, and Tim just wanted to go crawl under Justin's bed for a week or so. Suddenly, there was a squeal of pure childhood delight, Justine reached her tiny little hands out for Jason, kicking her feet and a beaming smile on her face. \"Daddy!\" Jason's eyes widened, his hand releasing his tight grip on the gun. Tim beamed right along with Justin, setting her down on the floor as she rushed over to her daddy, wrapping her arms around his knee. \"Daddy!\" She squealed again. Tim shook his head, realizing this to Justin, this was a very fun night. She had gotten to abuse his forehead, bite Batman, and expanded her vocabulary. Jason click on his gun's safety, scooping up Justine. She wrapped her arms around his neck, putting her face into his shoulder, babbling something unintelligible. Little by little, Tim saw Jason's stony glare melt, and vanish. Jason tucked Justin more securely under his arm, then looked Bruce square in the eye. \"I'll forgive you this once, but if you ever try to take my daughter away from me, I will kill you. I have no guilt about her growing up with only one grandfather.\" Jason turned around to walk out of the front door, but Tim stopped him. \"Where are you going?\" Jason whirled around, eyes trying to snap Tim's skull in two. \"TO DICK'S! GET JUSTY A BABYSITTER WHO CAN ACTUALLY DO HIS JOB! GROW A PAIR REPLACEMENT!\" Jason turned around, and Justin called over his shoulder, \"Grow a pair Timmy!\" Tim glared after them. \"I hate my life.\"[Chapter 9] \"Do we have to?\" Jason wined. \"Preschool is fine Jason.\" Kim debated. \"Look, we need some more income, and I'm ready to go to work. Now, unless you want me to get Tim to baby-sit again-\" \"No.\" Jason said firmly. Kim nodded slowly. The fact Bruce had tried to kidnap her baby girl was hard to accept, but she knew it was true. Bruce was against them, against them being happy together, but to him, it was more than that. Bruce thought he was doing the right thing, he was just wrong. \"Wasn't Tim's fault, Bruce is just-\" \"Not Tim.\" Jason said firmly. \"I'll leave the kid with Penguin if I have to, just not Tim.\" \"Preschool?\" Kim asked softly, sitting next to Jason on the couch. \"You have any idea how many shots Bruce is gonna have at grabbing her there?\" Jason asked. Kim was silent, \"Well, we can't keep her at home forever.\" She hated the thought as much as he did: Justine being beyond their reach, them not being able to keep her safe. \"Eventually she has to go to school.\" \"There's a big difference between her being six and her being one.\" Jason debated. \"Dick can keep her when we need him to. Golden boy's not gonna let Bruce kidnap her. No chance, no way.\" \"You think Tim would?\" Kim asked. \"No, I know he's to good for that. But, Tim hates me. On top of that, Tim doesn't have a chance against Bruce, Dick on the other hand, has a much better shot at getting Justine out of his way.\" Kim nodded, \"Guess that rules out my parents.\" \"Kim, don't get me wrong, I love your parents, they're pretty awesome, but against Batman… I just don't want my little girl to…\" Jason trailed off. Kim reached over, putting a hand on his shoulder comfortingly. \"It's okay Jason.\" He shook his head, \"I don't know what I'm going to do Kim. I know we need some more money around here, or we'll lose the house in a few months, and then there's the electricity bill, and so many other things, but my daughter….\" Kim suddenly lit up, \"Actually, I think I might have an answer to this.\" \"What?\" Jason asked, curious. \"A friend of mine is dropping in for a visit for a few weeks, and she might be able to help.\" Kim said, smiling. \"Only person I know who could kick the crap out of Bruce.\" Jason paused for a moment, \"Uh… Catwoman?\" \"Try again.\" \"Poison Ivy?\" \"You think I'd let that trollop touch my baby?\" \"Touché, alright then… I give up.\" \"Cassandra Cain.\" Kim said, \"She doesn't know about Justin, unless Bruce told her, which I doubt. Me and her were pretty good friends back in the day, I'm sure she'd help us out anyway she could.\" \"… You mean that Black Bat chick down in Hong Cong?\" Jason asked. \"… Yeah.\" Kim admitted. \"That crazy assassin?\" Jason tried to clarify. \"Yes.\" \"The freaking daughter of freaking Lady Shiva?\" Jason asked, \"Are you nuts!\" Justine rushed into the living room, giggling her head off, \"Daddy!\" Jason scooped her up, pulling her onto his lap, \"What?\" \"Pak!\" She demanded. Jason looked up at Kim, raising an eyebrow. Kim rolled her eyes, \"She wants you to take her to the park. And don't hate on Cassandra, she may be the freaking daughter of freaking Lady Shiva, but Justine is the freaking daughter of freaking Jason Todd.\" Jason paused, \"Fine. Just make sure she's not gonna hand Justy over to Bats.\" He tightened his grip on Justin, carrying her out the door, \"We're off to the park!\" \"Have fun!\" Kim encouraged, grabbing her cell phone, and quickly dialing an old yet familiar number. \"Hello?\" Asked a cautious yet strong voice. \"Cass? It's me, Kim.\" She said. \"Kimberly?\" She questioned. \"Haven't heard form you in awhile.\" \"Yeah, things have been… busy lately.\" Kim confessed. \"Dick called me a few days ago.\" She said, \"Told me some pretty wild stories about you and your boyfriend .\" \"Oh.\" Kim said slowly, felling a little embarrassed that Cass had to get information about Kim and Jason from Dick. \"You really do have a daughter, don't you Kimberly?\" Cass asked. \"A daughter with Jason Todd.\" \"Yes.\" Kim confessed. \"Did Bruce really try to… try to kidnap her?\" She asked, hesitant to believe that the man she idolized would commit such an act. \"I don't wanna believe it either.\" Kim confessed. \"But he did.\" \"I… feel sorry for you Kim.\" Cass admitted. \"Well then… maybe you can help me. We need a babysitter.\" Kim suggested. \"For your daughter?\" Cass asked \"How old is she?\" \"She'll be two in a month.\" Kim said, \"If you stay long enough, you can come to her birthday party.\" \"Sorry.\" Cass said, truly meaning it, \"I'm halfway across the world Kim. I can't just drop everything like that.\" \"Okay, that's fine, just tossing a coin is all.\" Kim said. \"What can you do for a babysitter then?\" Cass asked. \"I… I have other friends.\" Kim mumbled. \"Who Kim?\" Cass demanded. \"Dick, Tim, and… my parents.\" Kim mumbled. \"Are you sure you've got this covered Kim?\" \"Yep! Gotta go, bye. Great talking with you!\" Kim blurted out, hanging up quickly. \"I have nothing figured out.\" She deadpanned. AT THE PARK: \"Big slide!\" Justine demanded. \"Justy, it's not made for little kids.\" Jason begged. \"Big slide!\" She repeated. \"If you go on the big slide, you're gonna get hurt.\" Jason tried to explain, \"Just go on the little slide.\" \"No!\" She snapped. \"Big slide!\" \"If you go on the big slide, you'll fall off, hit your head, scrape your knees all up, and start crying!\" Jason said, exasperated. \"Nu uh!\" She screamed, \"I… I WANNA GO ON THE BIG SLIDE!\" \"Fine!\" Jason gave in, throwing his hands into the air, \"Go break your neck!\" \"Yay!\" Justin said, running up the stairs quickly to get to the slide. \"Wait, no!\" Jason protested, as Justin reached the top, sitting down on the entrance. \"Justy, don't-\" She slid forward, sliding down easily, and when reaching the bottom, rolls off the steep edge of the slide, into a summersault, before coming to rest on her bottom, gleaming up at Jason. She held her tiny arms out to him, \"Daddy!\" He scooped her up, \"Where did you learn that?\" \"Uncle Dick.\" She mumbled, wrapping her arms around his neck for a moment, before squirming, \"I wanna do it again!\" Jason shook his head, \"How about the teeter-totter instead?\" \"No.\" She said. \"Swings?\" \"No.\" \"Merry-go-round?\" Jason begs. \"Dat's gay.\" Justin said. Before Jason can respond to the word that he was sure she had over heard him say, a tiny gasp came from under the steps to the slide, and a little head of brown curls peaked out to look at them. Justin stared a the girl for a minute, before tilting her head to the side, \"What?\" \"You said bad word!\" She accused. \"So?\" Justy asked, squirming to get down, so Jason let her down slowly, and Justy turned towards the other toddler. \"What you goon do?\" The girl was silent, before shrugging, \"Nodin.\" Justy smirked, and Jason watched curiously as she crossed her arms at the girl, \"Wuss!\" \"Was dat mean?\" The girl asked, coming out form under the steps to stare at Justin, confused. \"It means your ascared!\" Justy proclaimed, \"Scardy-cat!\" \"Ascared isn't a word.\" The girl explained, \"Is either scared, or afwraid.\" Why is a toddler giving an English lesson? Jason wondered, before he heard a voice he vaguely remembered call out, \"Kyler!\" The girl turned to look towards a redheaded man trotting over towards her, relief washing over him. \"Kyler, I thought I told you to stay by me.\" \"Didn't want to.\" The girl explained. Jason laughed, and Justy looked a the girl carefully, as if trying to decide if she was still a scardy-cat. \"Was your name?\" Justin asked, curious. The man then paid attention to Justine, raising an eyebrow at her, before turning to Jason, \"Do I know you from somewhere?\" \"No.\" Came Jason's answer, a little to quickly. \"Kyler.\" The girl said, pronouncing it carefully. \"Kyler Harper. Who are you?\" \"Todd.\" Justin said, puffing out her chest and crossing her arms again, \"Justin Todd.\" The man's face lit up, \"Yeah! Your Jason Todd! Bruce's kid!\" Justin suddenly lit up, turning to look at the man Jason now remembered as Roy, \"Bruce? Gandpa is here?\" Jason shook his head, \"Nope.\" \"I didn't know you guys lived out here.\" Roy said, trying to strike a conversation. \"For two years.\" Jason mumbled. Kyler spoke up again, \"Wanna go play in the teeter-totter?\" \"Dat's gay as hell.\" Justin snapped. Kyler gasped again covering her mouth in shock, while Roy just stared in utter disbelief. Justin smirked, liking that response. She opened her mouth again, \"Grow a pair, wuss!\" Kyler frowned, \"Don't call me that.\" \"I'll call you whatever I want to.\" Justin snapped. She stepped forward, shoving Kyler, making her fall onto her back. \"Justine Todd!\" Jason scolded. \"She asked for it.\" Justin offered for an excuse. Roy knelt down next to Kyler, about to help her up, but the little girl with brown curls and a degree in English II jumped up herself, tackling Justin. Justin yelped, started that the nerd would put up a fight, but wasted no time in rolling over, pulling her hair out of Kyler grip, and punching her square in the nose. Jason grabbed Justin, yanking her off Kyler, and Roy scooped up Kyler, looking her over for wounds, to find the worst she would have was a bruise. He held his little girl tightly, glaring at Jason. \"Little young to be fitting her for a cape Jason!\" Roy spat, walking off with Kyler cradled in the crook of his arm. Jason cursed under his breath, and Justin looked up at him, \"What does that word mean?\" Jason glared at her, \"It means you're in big trouble.\" Justin's eyes widened, and Jason dragged his protesting toddler home.[Chapter 10] Kim and Jason sat on either side of their daughter, both frowning. Kim finally broke the silence, \"Justy, that word is a very bad word, you can't say it anymore.\" \"Which one?\" Justine asked. Kim raised an eyebrow at Jason, who shrugged back. Justin sensed the confusion. \"I said gay as hell. Which one is the bad word?\" Kim sighed, rubbing her temples. She didn't really want to tell her nearly two year old daughter about lesbians and gay men. \"Well, hell, depending on how you use it, is a bad word. Gay isn't really a bad word, it's just a… special word.\" \"Special?\" Justine echoed. \"Yes.\" Kim explained, \"If you use it the right way, to explain something, then is can be a normal word, but if you use it the wrong way, it can hurt… special peoples feelings.\" \"… Special?\" Justin asked again. Kim nodded, \"Special means that something is different from you, but that doesn't make it bad.\" \"What's gay mean?\" Justin asked. \"Well…\" For once in the conversation, Kim seemed at a loss. Jason finally stepped in, scooping Justin off the couch, \"I've got this one babe.\" He carried Justin out of the room, through the kitchen, and into the garage. He set her down on the cold floor, walking over to his work bench, and taking down an AK-47. He set it down on the floor, gesturing for her to come over. Justin pulled herself up, toddling across the floor to her father. He kneeled down next to her, gesturing to the large gun. He had picked the only one that wasn't loaded, but he clicked the safety on just to make sure. \"Justy, can you lift this?\" She grabbed the barrel of the gun tightly, trying with all her might to lift it, and when that didn't succeed, she tried to drag it, but the little girl couldn't budge the machine gun. She looked up at her father with big curious eyes. \"No.\" Jason nodded, picking the gun up himself, \"See, you're to little to lift it yourself, right?\" Justin nodded. \"So, if you want to move it from here and put it back on the bench, you have to let me do it for you. You can't make me do it, so you have to trust me, right?\" Again, she nodded. \"It's the same problem with knowing things, if you can't carry the burden, then I'll have to do it for you until you're ready, understand?\" Jason questioned. Justy nodded again, not sure where this was going. \"Then, you'll just have to trust me until you're ready to know what that word means, understand?\" Jason questioned, putting the gun back on his work bench. Justin's eyes brightened, understanding the lesson now. \"Otay Daddy.\" Jason smiled, picking Justy up, but she squirmed in his hold, \"No!\" He raised an eyebrow, putting her down. She smiled up at him, \"I can carry myself.\" She toddled out of the garage, back into the house. Jason's eyes widened, and he sat down on the chair by his bench, mouth falling open a little. She was almost two, of course she could walk by herself. He knew that. He should have known that by now, she wouldn't need him for help. He rubbed his forehead, not liking this epiphany at all. He sighed to himself, reaching for the mini-fridge by his work bench. \"I need a beer.\" He pulled one out, opening it and chugging down the first few gulps. She was talking very well for her age, which wasn't a surprise since her mother had talked very well at her age too. Jason smiled to himself, instead of being a ginger, like him, her orange hair was darkening slowly, it would be her mom's color by the time she was ten. Her eyes looked just like her mothers, prettiest blue he had ever seen. She was walking, playing on the playground equipment that was meant for the older kids, and asking questions she shouldn't be. He really had to start watching his mouth around her. Justin suddenly toddled back into the garage, \"Daddy, I heard you say a word.\" \"What word?\" Jason asked. Justy smiled pleasantly, a direct contrast from the dirty word that flew out of her mouth. Jason nearly dropped his beer can, \"When did you hear me say that?\" \"Playground.\" She explained. Stupid! I can't believe you… actually I can believe you. Only you would curse like that right in front of your two year old kid. \"Uh… it's the heavy burden thing again.\" Jason explained. \"Okay.\" Justin said, turned to go away, but then turned back to Jason, \"Does Mommy know what it means?\" Jason paused, raising his eyebrow, \"Are you trying to black mail me?\" Justin just shrugged. \"You tell your mom about that word, and I'll tell her that your to one who stuck chewing gum under the kitchen table.\" Jason threatened. Justin's eyes widened, and she quickly toddled out of the garage again. Jason smirked, who was he kidding? He was raising his kid right. LATER, BEDTIME Jason walked into Justin's room, smiling at the sight of her curled up with her plush Nightwing toy, mumbling in her sleep. That kid would just not shut up. She had on her Nightwing pajamas too, and at the foot of her bed rested her red and yellow robin sneakers. He shook his head, sighing, \"This is stereotyping.\" He walked back into the kitchen, to see Kim staring at the phone book, frowning. \"Kim?\" Jason asked. She looked up at him, smiling at him. \"Hey Jason.\" \"What ya doin?\" He asked, pulling out a chair to sit next to her. \"Trying to find where that girl Kyler lives.\" \"Why?\" Jason asked, raising an eyebrow. \"So I can go apologize to Roy and her mother.\" Kim said. \"If my kid beat someone up on the playground, then me and her are going over there first thing in the morning to say she's sorry.\" \"Roy's kid was the one being a smart ass!\" Jason protested. \"Jason, you never respond to verbal remarks in a physical manner.\" Kim snapped. \"Why nooooooooooot?\" Jason whined. \"Jason!\" Kim hissed. \"Fine!\" Jason snapped. \"But while we're on the subject, why does she have a Nightwing plushy doll!\" \"The store was out of Batman plushy dolls.\" Kim explained. \"Kim, maybe you don't understand this, but my daughter is sleeping with my legal brother .\" Jason ground out. \"And you were gonna have her sleep with my father ?\" \"Jason!\" Kim said, shocked, \"It's just a doll!\" \"Well then why couldn't you get her superman, or green arrow, or… or red hood or something! Why is it always Batman symbol shirts and robin sneakers, and, and Nightwing pajamas !\" Jason questioned, tossing his hands into the air. Kim smiled, shrugging, \"I think it's cute, and do you really want her idolizing Green Arrow? Do you wanna be the one listening to her go on and on about what the arrow family has been doing on the news?\" Jason paused, then sighed. \"Fine. But seriously, why doesn't she have Red Hood stuff too? Why is it only the others?\" Kim smirked, \"Tell you what, I'll try to find something Red Hood for her to wear, okay?\" Jason nodded, \"Fine.\" Kim finally found the Harper's address, scribbling it down on her left wrist. Jason had always been fascinated by her habit of writing notes on her wrist. It was one of the things that had intrigued him about her when they were younger. Most girls wouldn't want their 'pretty skin' to get smudged, but Kim didn't seem to care about her looks. Another thing that attracted him was her humbleness. She was pretty, but didn't care. She was strong, but didn't flaunt it. She was smart, but didn't acknowledge it. She was one of the nicest girls he had known, but she still didn't realize her own perfections. He didn't think she was perfect, quite the opposite. He knew her flaws now. She wasn't a detective, hardly ever thinking about the big scene, Blue Jay had always busted whatever criminal she came across. She didn't know how to hunt someone down, just how to take them out. She wasn't very fast, but tried to make up for it with strength and timing. She did. Jason shook his head, \"Why do you even care about apologizing to this kids Mom?\" Kim paused, closing the book slowly. \"I don't have any friends here Jason.\" Jason paused, taking this in. He played poker with his friends every Wednesday night, and he hadn't even asked Kim about her friends. Now he realized, she didn't have any. \"If this Kyler girl's dad is Red Arrow, than her mom… might understand what it's like. Maybe… maybe I could have a friend.\" Kim said hopefully. Jason nodded slowly, \"Why haven't you tried hanging out with some of the other women we met at the BBQ?\" \"I did.\" Kim snapped. \"All of them are stuck up, always talking about either their kids, clothes, make up, or The Real House Wives of New Jersey ! They're such… such girls!\" Jason wanted to laugh, but he didn't. Kim continued, \"I can't hang out with my old friends anymore, they're off being heroes while I'm stuck here, just being a mom!\" Jason bit his lip, \"Kim, I'm so sorry that marrying me ruined your life.\" Kim shook her head, \"No Jason, you're not the one who ruined my life, I'd marry you no matter what. It's Bruce! That little jerks has me paranoid to the point where I can't leave my daughter at home with a neighborhood babysitter or at a daycare!\" \"Hey, when she turns five, then you can leave her with a babysitter, I promise. I'll show her how to get away from Bruce, or any other kidnapped, and then I'll feel better about it.\" Jason promised. \"Dick can take off time from his job whenever he wants, so maybe this weekend, you can get out of the house, maybe ask this Mrs. Harper lady to go see a movie with you.\" Kim nodded, \"Okay.\" Jason smiled, leaning over to peck her on the cheek, \"Bed time?\" \"Shower first.\" Kim reminded him, pointing down at his grease covered shirt and pants. \"Big enough for two?\" Jason asked, hopeful. \"Not tonight.\" Kim shot down. \"Oh piss!\" Jason complained. \"Oh piss?\" Came a tiny little tired voice form the doorway. Jaosn turned around to see his daughter, dressed in her Nightwing pajamas, rubbing the sleep out of her eyes, \"Daddy, why you oh piss?\" Jason grunted, letting his face fall down into his hands, and Justin turned to Kim, \"Mommy, daddy is oh piss.\" Kim glared at Jason, who looked up at her, rubbing his eyes, \"I'm sorry.\" Kim nodded, \"You better be.\" The back glass door suddenly opened, and Russell walked in, holding a brown box, and smiling at the family, \"Hey Todd, guess what?\" Justin spoke up quickly, \"Not now Mr. Russell, Daddy oh piss.\" Russell nearly dropped the box he was holding, \"What did you say?\" \"Are you oh piss too?\" Justin asked. Russell looked over at Jason, \"Uh yeah… I'm just gonna leave this here.\" He quickly set the box down on the counter heading for the door, but Justin managed to squeeze in one last, \"Daddy's oh piss!\" Before the thoroughly shaken man managed to run out the back door and hop the fence into his yard. Jason frowned, \"How did he get into my house?\"[Chapter 11] \"I don't wanna go to sleep Daddy.\" Justin protested. Jason sighed, after Kim had chewed him out, he had finally been able to slip away to tuck in his daughter, \"Justy, it's bedtime.\" \"No!\" She snapped. \"I know you're tired.\" He argued. \"No!No!No!\" She said, speeding through the words, making it sound like one word. \"Yes, yes, yes.\" Jason said back, scooping his daughter up off her bedroom floor and setting the squirming toddler down in her bed. Jason mentally smacked himself, why does she have Red Robin bed sheets? \"Honey, when did you get these sheets?\" \"Mommy get them at Good Will!\" Justin said, a grin spreading over her face. \"Red Robin is cool.\" \"No he's not.\" Jason debated, \"I could kick his butt any day.\" \"Really?\" The girl asked, staring up at her father in childhood wonder. Could her father really be able to beat up Red Robin? \"Yes. Now go to sleep.\" He ordered, pulling back the Red Robin sheets and stuffing her under them. \"Don't wanna!\" She screamed, kicking her way out of them. \"Fine.\" He said, standing up and walking over to the far wall, taking a book Kim had left there off the shelf, skimming over the title page hastily. \"Than I guess we'll just sit here and read all night long.\" \"Read?\" Justin asked. Jason nodded, \"You'll learn to do it one day.\" He sat on the bed next to her, pushing the blankets back over her, glaring at her when she started to wiggle out form under them again. She sighed, settling down under the covers, curious as to the story. \"My last name was Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973.\" Jason red aloud, then paused, maybe this wasn't such a good book for him to read to his daughter. Justine grunted, telling him to keep going. \"In newspaper photos of missing girls from the 70's, most looked like me: white girls with mousy brown hair. This was before kids of all races and genders started appearing on milk cartons or in the daily mail. It was back when people believed things like that didn't happen.\" Jason figured she couldn't understand, so what was the harm? Justin was asleep before the girl in the story even met Mr. Harvey in the cornfield. Thank God. He was really going to have to talk to Kim about the literature content of this household. THE NEXT DAY: \"I don't wanna!\" Justin protested as her mother practically dragged her down the street. \"We're going to their house and you're going to say you're sorry to that little girl.\" Kim snapped. \"She started it!\" Justin protested. \"And I'm ending it.\" Kim said with finality. \"Not you can either apologize to her now, or you can go without desert for two weeks, and no bread rolls.\" Justin contemplated this. \"Can I whack her after I say sorry?\" \"No!\" \"Oh fine.\" Justin grumbled. Kim walked up the house sidewalk with Justin in tow, a small tin of cookies in her hand. She rang the doorbell with some difficulty, and a beautiful woman with brown hair and brown eyes opened the door. She smiled at Kim, \"Can I help you with something?\" Kim smiled back, \"Hi. I found out you were new to the neighborhood, and since my daughter met yours yesterday, under unfortunate circumstances, so I thought I should come over, if only to apologize.\" The woman looked a little taken back, looking down to her right, \"Kyler, do you know them?\" A little head of brown curls popped out from behind the woman's leg, and Justin's eyes narrowed. The little girl, Kyler, grunted, \"Yes! That's the girl that hurt me yesterday!\" Justin frowned, \"You're the one that wouldn't shut up.\" \"Justin.\" Kim said, warning her. Justin grunted, crossing her arms and glaring at her shoes. \"Justine Todd!\" Kim snapped. Justin looked up at Kyler, \"I'm sorry.\" She said quickly, rushing the two words out. As soon as the two words left her mouth, Justin saw Kyler's shirt. Dark yellow with a picture of a man in a green costume with a bow and arrow on the front. She pointed at Kyler's shirt, \"Who's that?\" Kyler looked down at her shirt, then back up at Justin, \"Green Arrow. He's the super hero of Star City.\" Justin's face lit up, and she grabbed the edge of her shirt, puling it out so Kyler could see it better, \"This is Nightwing! He's the super hero of Bludhaven!\" \"You like super hero's too?\" Kyler questioned, timid with this statement. Did she actually have something in common with this playground bully? Justin nodded, \"I've got a Nightwing doll at home! Wanna see it?\" Kyler smiled, \"Sure! Wanna see my Red Arrow doll?\" \"Who's he?\" Justin asked. Before Kyler's mom could intervene, Kyler blurted out of excitement, \"My dad! He works with Green Arrow!\" Wow!\" Justin exclaimed, while Kyler's mother looked at Kim with nervousness in her eyes, \"Your Dad's a super hero? That's awesome!\" \"I've got Speedy posters too-\" \"Where?\" Justin interrupted. \"In my room-\" \"Let's go see!\" Justin said, grabbing Kyler's hand and running into the house. Kim smiled a the woman, \"Hi, I'm Kimberly Todd, you can call me Kim.\" The woman looked even more nervous, \"My daughter didn't mean the whole Red Arrow thing.\" \"Don't worry, I know everything about it.\" Kim assured. The woman looked shocked, \"You do?\" Kim nodded, \"My husband and yours share a certain career.\" The woman smiled, \"I'm Anna Harper, come on in.\" Kim and Anna walked into Anna's living room, and were soon laughing, eating coffee and cookies, talking about their husbands. \"He had to practically crawl through the backdoor to get inside!\" Anna exclaimed, finishing her story of how Roy had gotten two broken legs from a simple teenager gang. Kim laughed, \"Haha, in my cape days, I barely cared about the teenager gangs, I was always focused on the drug trade.\" Anna looked surprised, \"You were a hero?\" Kim nodded, \"Blue Jay. Were you?\" \"Nope.\" Anna said, \"Just a civilian.\" Kim smiled, \"Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I hadn't become Blue Jay. I always think it would have been better if I had just left the work to Batman.\" Anna nodded, \"I mind my own business, try not to get hooked up in the hero life.\" Justin and Kyler suddenly rushed out of Kyler's room, \"Mom, can Kyler come over to our house for lunch?\" Kim smiled, turning to Anna, \"If you say it's okay, you could come over too.\" Anna smiled back, \"Sounds delightful.\" Justin practically dragged Kyler down the street by her wrist, and by this time Kyler had started to question her choice of friend. IN JUSTIN'S ROOM: \"And this is my Nightwing doll.\" She said, showing Kyler her doll happily. \"How does he fight?\" Kyler asked. \"Daddy says he uses stupid glorified chopsticks.\" Justin explained. \"I've never heard of that weapon.\" Kyler mused. \"You really like hero's, huh?\" Justin asked. Kyler nodded, \"I wanna be Speedy when I grow up!\" \"Who's Speedy?\" \"That's who my dad used to be before he was Red Arrow.\" Kyler explained. \"Do you wanna be one?\" Justin beamed, \"Yeah!\" \"Who do you wanna be?\" Kyler asked. \"Are you gonna make your own?\" Justin shrugged, \"I don't know.\" \"Girl's!\" Kim called, \"Pizza for lunch!\" Justin and Kyler rushed to the table, chorusing, \"Is it plain cheese?\" Both mothers answered, \"Or course.\" And so began both girl's first friendship.[Chapter 12] Justin smiled with glee as a slick dark blue Mclaren F1 pulled into the driveway. She squealed, rushing out into the front yard, \"Uncle Dick!\" Dick stepped out of his car, scooping up the little girl, \"Hey kiddo!\" He hugged her tightly, then smiled at her, \"So, how's it feel to be two years old?\" She beamed at him, \"Great!\" He chuckled, shaking his head, \"You sure you're only two?\" Justin was way to smart for her age, it truly amazed Dick how she could carry on a conversation with someone the way she did. She gave him a sarcastic look, \"No, I'm thirty-two.\" He sighed, \"Yep, you're Jason's kid.\" He put Justin down, as a red motorcycle pulled into the driveway, and Justin rushed over to great Tim. \"Uncle Tim!\" He smiled, pulling the little girl up onto the motorcycle with him, \"Hey Justin.\" He pulled a small package wrapped in pink paper and ribbons out from the side pouch, handing it to her, \"Happy birthday!\" She giggled, trying to peel off the ribbons. Kim suddenly appeared, taking the present, \"Justin, you know the rules, presents come after the cake.\" Just sighed, \"Okay Mom.\" Tim chuckled, shaking his head, then turned to Kim, \"You hear anything from Bruce?\" She shook her head, \"I want nothing to do with him, but I asked Alfred to come. Alfred said he would, Alfred always comes to birthdays.\" Tim rolled his eyes, \"Of course he will, he's Alfred, but does Jason know?\" \"Yes Tim.\" Kim said, rolling her eyes, \"Now how about you stop acting like you're my big brother? That's Dick's job.\" Justin suddenly piped up, \"Mommy, how come every time I say Uncle Dick's name, Mr. Russell Laughs?\" \"Who?\" Tim inquired. Kim blushed, \"Next door neighbor.\" She turned to Justine, \"I'll tell you when you're older.\" \"Or you'll just find out on your own when you get to elementary school.\" Tim pitched in, and Kim glared at him, \"What? The kids in elementary school know to much.\" Jason came out of the house, and Justine wiggled down from the motorcycle, rushing to her daddy. He scooped her up, smiling, \"What's up? Said the elevator.\" Justine giggled, \"Just staying cool. Said the swimming pool.\" Dick raised his eyebrow, and Jason shrugged, \"She was watching Blues Clues.\" Tim scoffed, walking over and chimed in, \"You know that Steve guy is a pedophile right?\" Justine looked at Jason, \"Daddy, what's a pedophile?\" Jason glared at Tim, \"Thanks a lot replacement.\" \"Daddy what's a replacement?\" Justine asked. Jason grinned, \"Uncle Timmy is a replacement sweetie, because he's a cheap copy that was brought in because I died.\" Justine was silent for a moment, before shrugging, \"Okay Daddy.\" Kim sighed, \"Come on guys, we've got the cake inside.\" Jason growled, \"Yeah, the worst cake ever.\" Tim and Dick shared a look, before following the couple inside and into the kitchen. Kim brought the cake out of the fridge, setting it down in front of Justine, and removing the lid of the cake box. Everyone was silent, until Tim busted out laughing, holding his sides. Dick snickered, \"You got her a Batman and Robin cake?\" Jason glared at the cake, showing Batman and Robin back to back, facing a dozen Gotham thugs with knives. Dick shook his head, \"How did you even get such a detailed picture?\" Kim smirked, \"Alfred.\" Jason growled, \"That old man betrayed me.\" Kim sighed, putting two candles on the cake and lighting them, \"Blow out the candles and make a wish baby.\" Justin thought for a minute, before blowing the candles out. Dick raised his eyebrow, \"What'd you wish for Justin?\" She beamed at him, \"I wanna meet Nightwing one day!\" Dick just had to laugh at the irony, and Jason held his head in shame, \"Why is it always Nightwing? Robin I could handle, but why Nightwing?\" Dick rolled his eyes, \"Jason, just-\" \"She sleeps with you!\" Jason shouted, \"She sleeps with you every night!\" An awkward silence settled over them, until Kim sighed, \"I got Justine a stuffed Nightwing doll for Christmas last year.\" Tim could barely contain his laughter, he might not like Jason, but Justine sure kept everything interesting. Half an hour later the cake was eaten, and Justine sat in front of a pile of about five presents, looking at them curiously. Dick smiled, point to the only blue present, \"Oh, open mine first!\" Justine picked up the present, and tore off the wrapping paper, pulling up a picture book, titled, Batman and Robin: The Dynamic Duo. She jumped up, running over to Jason, \"Daddy! Read to me! Read to me!\" \"Not now.\" Jason said, \"Open your other stuff.\" Justin practically deflated, walking over to the pink present Tim had brought. She tried to pull off the ribbons, but just got her fingers tangled until Tim had to cut them loose, then open the present for her. It was a Barbie doll, all dressed up in a pink ball gown, with blonde hair and green eyes, and it came with about two other outfits, which were both very pretty and sparkly. Justin looked up at her Dad, \"Daddy, what's this?\" Jason's face lit up, and Tim knew he was going to say something completely inappropriate. \"That Justy, is Tim's ex-girlfriend, and the only on he'll ever get.\" Tim groaned, \"Don't listen to him Justy, it's called a Barbie doll, you play with it, like you do your Nightwing doll.\" Justin shrugged, picking up an awkwardly wrapped present with red paper, and tearing it open. Inside was a bright red water gun, with the red hood's helmet airbrushed onto it, and Red Hood written beneath the helmet. Everyone turned to Jason, glaring at him. \"What?\" Jason asked innocently, \"Oh, so it's okay for her to sleep with a Nightwing doll, but she can't have a water gun?\" Tim wasn't fazed, \"You're teaching her that guns are okay to play with.\" \"They are!\" Jason defended. Kim whacked him upside the head, \"Jason!\" \"I meant water guns!\" \"Yeah, whatever.\" Justin picked up the next present, wrapped in white paper, and tore it open. It was a small, stuffed brown dog. \"Thank you Mommy!\" \"How do you know it's from her?\" Dick asked. \"Cause I asked her for a puppy, yesterday.\" Justin said, hugging the small stuffed toy. Tim smiled, turning to Kim, \"Are you sure she's only two?\" Kim rolled her eyes, \"I know, I know. She act's like she's three, doesn't she?\" \"Or older.\" Tim agreed. \"She'll be a smart kid.\" Suddenly, the doorbell rang, and Justin jumped up, \"I'll geddit!\" She took off for the front door, leaving the adults in the living room. Justin flung open the front door, staring up at a very tall man with black hair and blue eyes, holding a big box, wrapped in black and white wrapping paper. \"Hi!\" She said, smiling. He looked down at her, and gave an awkward smile, as if it hurt him to smile. He knelt down in front of her, \"Are you Justine?\" He whispered. She nodded, \"Sometimes, other times I'm Justy, and other times other than that, I'm Justin.\" He paused for a moment, before handing her the box, and put a finger to his lips, telling her to be quiet. \"Happy birthday.\" She smiled as he stood up, and walked away. She slammed the door shut, and waddled back into the living room, toting the huge box. Jason raised his eyebrow, \"What's that?\" \"My present from the big man.\" Justin said, sitting down in front of everyone and slapping the present down in front of her. \"Christmas isn't for four months Justin.\" Dick said, smiling. \"Not that man!\" Justin said, \"The man at the door, in the black sweater.\" Tim raised an eyebrow, \"A man at the door? What's his name?\" Justin just shrugged, \"I don't know.\" She ripped into the present, revealing a cardboard box, airbrushed to look like a metal case. She undid the latches on it, and it fell open, revealing latex gloves, a magnifying glass, finger print powder, stencils, several bags labeled CSI evidence bags, goggles, magnifying glass, five slides, evidence logs, test tubes, evidence markers, a book of charts, fingerprint cards, situation cards, a plaster frame, an evidence journal and two bags of plaster. Everyone was silent, until Justin looked up at her father, \"What's all this stuff?\" Jason grabbed the box, shoving everything back into it, and stalked off to the hall closet, putting it at the top, and shutting the door, \"Nothing Justy, just forget about it. Do you want your cake now?\" Justine nodded, and the box was forgotten, and Jason hoped it would stay that way. Who did Bruce think he was?[Chapter 13] Sometimes Kim worried about Justin. Justin was only two, but she talked much older. Sometimes Kim wondered if Justin knew what she was saying, knew what it meant. Sometimes Kim wondered if Justin understood everything they thought she did. Justin liked talking, Justin liked being by herself a lot too. She used to just stay inside the house, and play with her plushie dolls, but that changed after Kyler had moved to town. Now, Justin liked to go outside, in the back yard, and play with her Tonka trucks. Mr. Russell and his wife Mrs. Beth had four cats, the cutest cats Kim had ever seen. Since they lived right next door, they would often scale the fence and come into their back yard. The first time it happened, Justy had been sitting in a particular part of the yard, the far left corner, under their oak tree. It was her favorite spot, because their was a hole in the tree trunk that Justy could muscle her way into, and sit there, playing with whatever toys she had brought. Mrs. Beth's youngest cat, Sty, had scaled the fence, and wandered around the yard. Sty was the most adorable cat Beth had, she was a pretty orange color, with yellow paws. Justin was fascinated with it, watching it from her little cubby hole as it swatted at butterflies, and rolled around in the sun. Eventually, the cat saw her sitting there and wandered over. Justin had sat very still, waiting for it to get closer. Sty climbed onto the toddler's lap, sniffing her face, and Justy just sat incredibly still. Kim had been watching from the doorway, amazed her daughter wasn't moving or scaring the cat. Justy just waited until the cat was done sniffing her, and had carefully pet it's back. As soon as the cute moment started, it ended. Why did it end? Because the Todd in Justin came out. Justy grabbed the cat's tail, slinging it over her shoulder and started to tote the poor kitty toward the house like a sack. Sty freaked out, clawing up Justin's shoulders and her head, scratching her face all up. Justy let Sty go, and the cat made a bee line for Mrs. Beth's yard. Kim ran outside, \"Justin!\" Justin just stood there, mouth agape at the retreating cat. She didn't even say one word as Kim took her inside and put Neosporin and bandages on her arms and face. \"Justin, are you okay honey?\" Justin examined the various colored bandages up and down her arms, \"I didn't think…\" \"Didn't think what?\" Kim asked. \"It was so fluffy… how is something that fluffy that mean?\" Justin pondered. Kim smiled, shaking her head, \"That's one of life's greatest mysteries sweet pea.\" As soon as Jason got home, Justy rushed to the door, holding up her bandaged arms, \"Daddy!\" \"AH!\" Jason screamed, stumbling back, staring at his daughter, \"What happened to your arms?\" \"Kitty!\" She said, bouncing up and down excitedly. \"I'm now officially a dog person.\" Jason mumbled. \"Not even for your birthday Jason.\" Kim shot down, hearing the underlying tone. Jason sighed, \"Well, it was a good try at least.\" Kim rolled her eyes, \"Alright Jason, guess who gets to put her to bed?\" Jason sighed, \"I'm guessing me.\" \"I don't wanna go to bed!\" Justin said, plopping herself down on the floor in a huff. Justin never wanted to go to sleep. If Kim had to guess, she would say it was the bat in her. Jason didn't seem to like that idea. Jason picked Justin up, dragging her to bed, she was fighting him about it tooth and nail. Literally, kid was a biter, and that cat had taught her that claws were lethal. Finally, Jason had wrestled her into bed, and tired her out with a tickle fight, leaving her tired enough to fall asleep after he read her a poem from a Mother Goose story book Kim had picked up for her. He had opted against the one about the kittens with mittens tonight, settling for one about some rascal named Georgey who went around kissing girls on the playground, making them cry. He always ran away before the other boys came out to play, so they wouldn't beat him up for making all those girls cry. As soon as she was asleep, Jason went to bed with Kim. Only to be woken up three hours later by the sound of voices. \"Who are you?\" He heard Justin's voice ask. He had jumped out of bed, and dashed down the hall before he even heard whoever was in that room's response. He flung the door open, seeing a figure of a woman in the moonlight, her dark hair cascading over her shoulders. Justin was sitting up in bed, smiling at the woman. Jason knows this woman, he might owe her a lot, but that doesn't mean she can come her, it doesn't mean she's welcome here. \"Talia!\" Jason hissed. She looked over her shoulder at him, frowning, \"Just a moment, the child and I were speaking.\" She turned around to continue talking to Justine, but Jason grabbed her arm, dragging her out of the room, leaving a curious Justin on her bed. Once their in the hall, Jason's glaring at her, and she's glaring right back. \"What are you doing here?\" \"We had a deal.\" Talia explained, \"I taught you, trained you, gave you everything you needed, and you drop your end of the bargain the first sign of trouble.\" \"Yeah, well I had a kid.\" Jason snarled. \"What would you have done?\" \"Nothing.\" Talia said. \"I would have been there when my lover gave birth, and immediately returned to fighting crime if I was you. You didn't.\" \"I'm not going back to Gotham.\" Jason snaps. \"Yes you are.\" Talia said, crossing her arms. \"If you try to refuse, I'll kill your daughter.\" Jason growled, \"You can try .\" \"Don't be stupid Jason.\" Talia snapped. \"You can't guard her forever, whether it takes five weeks, or five years, eventually, I'll get her. And when I do, I'll see if I can spare you a little piece of your daughter to bury. A finger perhaps.\" Jason paused, he knew she was right, She had him, she had him by the neck. \"I can't go back to Gotham. Not now, probably not for years.\" She nods, \"I am willing to make a compromise. If you choose to never be the Red Hood again, I can accept that, however, you have to train someone else for your place.\" Jason rolled his eyes, \"Where am I gonna find someone to do that?\" Talia nods to Justin's bedroom door, and Jason hardens, \"If she wants to, I'll teach her. When she's old enough to know what she wants.\" \"And what age might that be?\" \"Twelve, thirteen, I don't know.\" Jason snapped. \"Not soon enough.\" She said, shaking her head. \"I will offer you something else, I'll send you someone to teach.\" \"Send me someone?\" \"A boy, I have a particular one in mind.\" Talia said, \"He is already trained, basically. You, you will teach him more. Teach him to be Red Hood.\" Jason paused, he could go back to Gotham, but then Justin is in harm's way. He could try to run, but Talia would catch him, he knew this. \"Fine.\" Talia nodded, \"Good. I will send him soon.\" She turns to leave, but then looks over her shoulder, \"I'd keep an eye on that child if I were you Jason, she's just got that odd look in her eye…\" \"What are you saying?\" Jason snapped. He's tired of this, he just wants her to leave. He wants to go back to being a normal American Dad with a wife and a little baby girl. \"I'm saying, don't put any slack on her leash, she'll run with it.\" Talia advised, \"Much like you.\" Then she was gone, and Jason was faced with telling Kim about this in the morning, and getting Justin to fall asleep again.[Chapter 14] When Jason answered the door, he wasn't really sure what to expect, but it sure wasn't the thirteen year old boy who stared up at him. \"Are you Jason Todd?\" Jason frowned, seeing several scars and burns littering the boys arms, and frowned, \"You must be the kid Talia sent, right?\" \"Yeah, and if you care, my name is Jay.\" He was going to have a long talk with Talia later. Kim walked up beside him, holding Justine, \"Oh, hi. Are you hungry?\" Jay's eyes scanned over her, then to the baby in her arms. \"That is the ugliest baby I have ever seen in my entire life.\" No one spoke, Jason was fuming, but Kim was a bit amused. Justine looked this new boy over, before a grin spread across her lips. \"Gimme! Gimme!\" She commanded, trying to reach for the boy. She wanted him to hold her. Jay looked at Kim, \"What is she doing?\" Kim smiled, \"She likes you, come on in.\" Jay walked in after Kim, still staring at Justine. While Kim talked to him, Justine got bored of trying to get her mother to hand her to Jay. She wiggled in her mothers arms, until Kim put her down. Justine made a mad grab for Jay's leg, but Jason's arms shot out and grabbed her, scooping her up with a smirk on his face, \"Say Justy, how's about me and you go spit at Mrs. Russell's cats?\" Justin gave this some thought, before shaking her head. \"No.\" She turned around in her father's arms, looking at Jay. She reached out towards him, \"Gimme!\" Kim rolled her eyes, \"Oh, just let the boy hold her Jason.\" Kim took Justine from Jason, holding her out to Jay. Jay paused for a moment before shaking his head. \"I don't know how.\" Kim just smiled, showing Jay how to position his arms, before placing Justine in them. Jay and Justin looked at each other for a moment, before Justin wrapped her arms around his neck, leaning her head on his shoulder. Jason gritted his looked up at Kim, \"What is she doing?\" Kim just laughed, \"She's hugging you.\" \"Why?\" Jay asked, completely out of his comfort zone. Kim shrugged, \"She likes you.\" Justin suddenly shot straight up in Jay's arms, throwing her hands into the air, \"JAY!\" \"She likes your name too.\" Kim added. Justin pulled back from Jay, smiling at him. Jay was at a complete loss. Is this just how kids act? He never really got a chance to do that… Justin wiggled in his arms, and Jay carefully set her down. Justin immediately grabbed a hold of his finger, trying to pull him to the back door, \"Come outside!\" Kim smiled as Jay slowly followed Justin, a bit amused and a bit concerned at how timid the boy was, \"Well he seems nice.\" Jason rolled his eyes, \"Kim, he's a trained killer, and for some reason I can't fathom, he's outside, alone, with my daughter.\" Kim frowned, \"I could have thought the same thing about you when you came back Jason.\" Jason frowned right back, \"You did.\" \"And I was wrong, and right now, you are too.\" Jason grunted, \"I'll believe that, probably never.\" OUTSIDE WITH JUSTIN AND JAY: Justin was happy to lead Jay all around the yard, and show him something she had never shown anybody before. In her special corner of the yard, behind her tree, wedged in-between the planks of wood was this weird hole in the ground, that had just showed up last week. She knew if she showed her mom or her dad then they would bury the hole, so she never told them. She pointed down at the hole, and Jay looked at her, \"You dug a hole?\" She shook her head, \"Not me. Somebody else.\" \"Who?\" \"I dunno.\" She said, shrugging. Jay frowned, and Justin picked up a rock, aiming at the hole, \"Watch this!\" She tossed the rock down into the hole, and there was a small rattle sound. Before Justin could ask what it was, Jay stuck his arm out in front of her, and a snake leapt out of the hole, locking it's jaws right onto Jay's arm. Jay grabbed it's neck, yanking it off. Blood trickled down his arm, dripping onto Justin's neck. Justin freaked out, screaming, running away towards the house, \"DADDY!\" Jason and Kim immediately dashed outside for Justin. Jason reached her first, scooping her up, and saw the blood. He immediately handed her to Kim, dashing for Jay. He grabbed the boy by his shirt collar, and saw the snake in his hand. He made a snake bite my daughter!? Jason drove his fist into the boy's stomach several times, \"YOU DON'T TOUCH HER!\" Jay didn't even move. Years of experience had taught him that if it's punishment, you don't hit back. You take it, and hope it's over soon. \"JASON!\" Kim screamed, \"IT WASN'T HER BLOOD, STOP IT!\" Jason paused, looking over his shoulder at Kim, seeing Justin's neck. Kim had wiped the blood away, there was no mark underneath. Jason's gaze drifted to the boy's arm, there was a snake bite that had been ripped open. Jay had gotten bit by the snake, and ripped it out. The blood had somehow gotten onto Justine. Jay trembled, holding his gut, Jason had hit him to hard. \"I'm sorry.\" Jason mumbled. Jay hadn't done anything wrong. After Kim had rushed to Jay's side and made sure nothing was broken, she smacked Jason right across his face, \"JASON PETER TODD, YOU DON'T EVER HIT HIM AGAIN!\" Jason just nodded, feeling the guilt sink in. Justin grabbed onto Jay's leg, sobbing into his knee cap, she didn't know what was going on, or why every was yelling, she just knew that Mommy and Daddy weren't happy, and Jay wasn't yelling like they were. Jay carefully picked her up, walking with her into the house while Kim really let Jason have it. He sat on the floor in her room with her until she calmed down, wondering how such a little person could scream so loud, or cling onto him so tight. Jay didn't know whether it was a weak moment, or the fact that this little girl being so distraught brought out this protective feeling in him, but either way, he decided to open his mouth and say, \"Don't worry, I'll make sure nothing bad happens to you.\" She looked up at him, and her tears stopped. She tried to smile at him, and he smiled right back. If his father were here… he'd be in deep trouble for that display of emotion.[Chapter 15] Jay woke up to the sound of a little girl crying. He sat bolt right up, forgetting where he was for a moment, until he remembered, Talia had sent him here, and Kim had set him up in their guest bedroom. The crying was probably Justin. He slid out of bed, tiptoeing down the hall to Justin's room, and peered in the doorway, to see Jason already standing there, picking up Justin and rocking her back and forth in his arms. He started to hum, and then he started singing the weirdest song Jay had ever heard. \"Gonna go down to Georgia, gonna eat a lot of peaches. Gonna go down to Georgia, gonna eat a lot of peaches.\" Jason's voice got a little faster, \"Peaches come from a can, they were put there by a man, in in factory down town.\" Jay cocked his head to the side, puzzled. Did Jason just make this song up, or is this just a common American song? His father had never sung anything like this before. Jay's father had never sung anything, as far as Jay knew. \"If I had my own say, I'd eat peaches every day, in the sun or in the ra-ain.\" Jason finished, and set Justin back down in her crib, she had fallen asleep. \"Jay, when I turn around, we're both going to pretend that this never happened, agreed?\" Jason said, without looking up at Jay. \"Agreed.\" Jay wasn't even sure he wanted to remember such a disturbing sight. Jason stood up straight, looking over at Jay in the doorway, \"Good, now get back to bed, we've got to go to Gotham tomorrow.\" Jay nodded, \"Can I ask why?\" \"Have to see some friends.\" Jason said, walking past Jay and heading to his and Kim's room. \"I think they'll like you.\" NEXT MORNING: When Kim had called him down for breakfast, Jay hadn't expected Justin would be sitting in such a weird chair. It was much higher off the ground than his, and it had a plate going across the middle, like a separate table. Kim walked past him, setting a handful of cheerios onto Justin's highchair. \"Eat up baby, daddy's taking you to see Uncle Dick today.\" Jay stared at Justin as she picked up cheerios in her tiny fists, shoving them into her mouth. \"Won't she choke?\" Kim smiled, settling a plate of waffles in front of Jay, \"No, she's good at eating, not picky at all.\" \"Picky?\" \"She'll eat anything you set in front of her, vegetables, fruit, meat, bread, cereal, she's not a pick eater.\" Kim explained, \"Most babies don't eat that good. They'll refuse to eat vegetables, and you'd have to give them only the things they want.\" Jay frowned, \"That's ridiculous, vegetables are necessary for bone density, and provide necessary minerals and other nutrients. Refusing to eat them is unhealthy.\" Jason walked in, \"Yeah, yeah Captain Kangaroo.\" Kim set a plate of waffles in front of Jason, \"Keep preaching about all that.\" Kim rolled her eyes, \"Alright Mr. Junk Food, I know you and dick aren't going to eat anything but pizza for lunch, so dinner is going to be meatloaf-\" \"Yes!\" Jason said, remembering how good Kim's meatloaf was. \"With broccoli, carrots, and rice.\" \"No!\" Jason whined, \"I don't wanna eat vegetables Kim, they taste gross!\" Kim sighed, \"Well, at least Justin didn't take after you in the eating department.\" Jason shrugged, \"She's a weird kid, she eats broccoli willingly.\" Kim frowned, sitting down herself with a plate of waffles. \"Jason, you're impossible.\" \"I try.\" Jay had never met people who acted to… weird. A cheerio his the side of his face, and he looked over at Justin, who was smirking at him, laughing. Kim frowned, \"No, Justin, we don't throw things at people.\" \"Unless it's a Batarang, and you're aiming at either the scum of the world, Tim, or Dick.\" Jason prompted. Kim glared at Jason, \"Yeah Jason, you have absolutely no plans for her to join the hero community, do you?\" Jason was silent for the rest of breakfast. Getting to Gotham City took awhile, they had all piled into Kim's car, with Jason behind the wheel, Kim in shotgun, and Jay in the back with Justin. Kim had brought snacks in a little bag, and a few toys and books for Justin. Jay watched her make her two finger puppets, a dog and a little boy, kill each other, before he stepped in and took them from her, putting them on his own fingers. Justin just stared at them, and Jay made them wiggling on his fingers, \"Don't kill us Justin, we love you!\" He tapped his fingers to her face, making the puppets kiss her cheeks, and she squealed in happiness, kicking her feet. Jay slipped another puppet onto his fingers, a lion. \"Roar!\" \"Oh no! It's the kind of the beasts! And he looks hungry !\" Jay made the boy puppet say. \"No!\" Justin said, \"Run away!\" Jay made the little boy and the cat run up Justin's arm to get to safety, and made the lion stand on her knee. \"Come down here so I can eat you up!\" \"No!\" Justin protested. \"But I'm hungry !\" The lion roared. Justin grabbed the goldfish she had been snacking on, handing them to the lion, \"There you go!\" The lion gobbled up the goldfish out of Justin's hand, \"Yummy! These taste a lot better than people and dogs!\" Justin giggled, \"Yay!\" This was so much more fun for her than making her finger puppets fight. She handed her goldfish to Jay, and he gobbled them up, snorting and wiggling his nose like a pig. \"Ew!\" Justin squealed, covering her eyes and shaking her head back and forth. \"Jay's a piggy!\" The whole car ride lasted like that, jay making her laugh by playing with her, or reading some of those books Kim had brought along. Once they finally got there, Jason had lead them all to a really nice looking apartment, and then up to the penthouse. A man was there, black hair, blue eyes, and he smiled. A lot. \"Justy!\" The man squealed, grabbing her from Kim, and twirling her around, \"Uncle Dick missed you so much!\" Justy looked petrified, she obviously did not like it when Uncle Dick got hyper. Another boy, a little older then Jay, walked into the room. \"Hey Kim, what's up?\" Kim shrugged, \"Well Tim, Justy really likes Jay.\" Tim turned to Jay, \"Nice to meet you, Kim told me everything over the phone.\" Jay nodded, \"Nice to meet you too.\" Dick smiled at him, \"How old are you?\" \"Thirteen.\" \"Wanna spar?\" Dick asked. Jay paused, \"Sure.\" They all piled into the training room, and Dick stood on the mat, smiling, \"Don't worry, I'll go easy on you.\" Jay looked over his shoulder at Kim, \"Can you take Justin out of the room?\" Kim nodded, puzzled, and walked away with Justin. Jay turned back to Dick, \"Why do you want her-\" Jay's fist collided with Dick's face, then his foot with Dick's crotch. Dick doubled over, and jay kneed him in the face. Dick fell with a thud. Everything was silent, until someone giggled. Jay and Tim looked at Jason, who was holding his stomach, trying not to laugh, and failing. \"Two seconds!\" Jason laughed, \"All it took, ha, ha, ha, was two seconds!\" Tim walked over to Dick's unconscious form, \"He's alright, just knocked out.\" Jason couldn't stop laughing. He was starting to like this kid. JAY IS NOT MINE! Jay was thought of, characterized, and created by my friend Red X17, and credit for Jay goes to him. He thought up Jay just for my stories, and he couldn't have do a better job. So you guys need to look him up, and send him a thank you PM, becaus ehe and I have LITERALLY sent over two hundred message to each other about Jay. He deserves a thank you. Oh, and that peaches song, it exists. My dad sings it whenever it comes on the radio, it's funny.[Chapter 16] Since Roy and Anna had moved into the neighborhood, there had to be another 'Welcome to the Neighborhood' BBQ block party. Kim was worried about how Jay would fit in, but he seemed to be incredibly calm with the entire thing. Jason was driving them to David's house, while Kim was in shot gun, looking over her shoulder at Jay and Justin in the back seat. Jay had been with them a week already, and if he wasn't training, eating, or sleeping, he was spending time with Justine. Playing with her, reading to her, watching TV with her, harassing Mrs. Beth's cats with her, and overall just being the ideal big brother figure in her life. Jason had spoke to Dick, who spoke to Barbara, about adoption papers for Jay. Nothing real, just enough paperwork so that the government wouldn't be suspicious, and that he could go to school next month. Kim wanted to give him plenty of time to adjust. Jason had also gotten enough paper work to convince anyone who asked that Kim had been a Marine, and Jason had been in the Navy. Army jobs like those would cover any questions if people wondered why Jason and Kim were in such great shape, or why Jason had so many guns, not that anyone ever saw them. Jason parked the car, getting out, \"Alright, remember, don't talk about guns, knives, fighting, or anything assassin related, okay?\" Jay nodded, having been drilled on this several times. \"Now, what's your name?\" \"My old name was Jay Francis Weaver, but since you adopted me, my name is Jay Todd. I don't have a middle name anymore, for personal reasons. My father died in a car crash, my mother died form breast cancer, and I don't like talking about it. My favorite sport is Basket ball, and I don't like tennis. I'm thirteen years old, and I'm in the eight grade. I'm not going to school right now because we've had trouble with paperwork, but I'll start next month.\" Jay recited. Jason nodded, \"Good, let's go.\" They walked through David's house, into his back yard, being greeted by David's wife Jenny, \"Hi Kim! How's Justine been doing? Oh, and who's this?\" Kim smiled, Jenny was a nice woman, but a bit boring all she really did was raise children. Once her kids got to old for pampering from their mother, she was going to be heart broken. \"Justine's fine, she's got another ear infection though. And this is Jay, we adopted him a few days ago.\" Jenny smiled at Jay, \"Well, welcome to the neighborhood!\" Jay smiled at her, \"Nice to meet you Ma'am.\" Jenny turned to look across the yard, \"Matthew!\" One of the teenage boys looked up, running over, \"Yes ma'am?\" Jenny introduced him quickly, \"Matthew, this is Jay, he's new here. Why don't uou introduce him to the other kids?\" \"Okay Mom.\" Matthew said, then turned to Jay, looking him up and down, and then deciding he was cool enough to hang out with, \"How old are you?\" \"Thirteen.\" \"I'm fourteen.\" Matthew said proudly, \"Come on, we were about to play basket ball.\" Jay lit up, \"That's my favorite sport.\" \"Well come on then!\" Matthew said, and he and Jay rushed over to the other boys. Anna walked over to Kim once Jenny had gone to check on her yeast rolls she was making, \"Hi Kim, how's Justine?\" Kim sighed, looking down at Justine in her arms, \"Fussy, she's got another ear infection. Her doctor says that if she doesn't stop getting them, they're gonna have to put tubes in her ears.\" Anna looked sympathetic, \"Sorry to hear about that, would she be able to take them out eventually?\" Kim nodded, \"Six, I think.\" \"Wow, I'm really sorry about that Kim.\" Kim shrugged, \"It'll be fine. She'll pull through.\" \"Can Justy play?\" Both women looked down to see Kyler, standing there, looking up at Justine in Kim's arms, fast asleep. Kim smiled, shaking Justin lightly, \"Justy?\" Justin cracked her eyes open, frowning, \"Mama?\" \"Kyler's here, do you wanna play with her?\" Justine's eyes lit up, and she wiggled out of her mother's arms, dropping down to the ground, and running off with Kyler. Kim paused, \"Should we be concerned?\" Anna shook her head, \"Kyler runs off all the time. She just likes being independent.\" Kim shrugged, \"Alright then, and she never get's hurt?\" \"Bruises and scraped up knees, but all kids her age do.\" Anna reassured. \"They won't leave the yard, Kyler knows to stay where she can see us, and not to talk to strangers or walk off with them. They'll be fine.\" Kim nodded, \"Alright.\" Justin followed Kyler through the yard, to the edge, and watched as Kyler scurried under a bush, \"Come on Justy.\" \"Why?\" Justine asked, \"I don't wanna go under a bush!\" \"It's fun.\" Kyler insisted. \"No one can see you, but you can see all of them. Try it.\" Justin paused, before crawling under the bush too, peeping out form between the roots. \"I still don't get it.\" Kyler shrugged, \"Just wait awhile.\" Justin sighed, waiting with Kyler for a few minutes, until she saw something funny. It was brown and wrinkly, and it had lots of little holes in it. It was hanging from a branch across from Justin's foot, and she reached further into the bush, noticing small little buzzing things covering it, \"Kylie, what's that?\" Kyler looked over, \"Oh no, Justy don't touch that-\" One of the little buzzy critters flew onto Justin's finger, and immediately, she felt a really big sting go through her hand. She screamed, jumping up out of the bush, \"MOMMY!\" Kim looked up at Justin, her eyes going wide at the side of her baby falling onto her face, screaming her head off. \"MOMMY IT HURTS!\" Kim jumped up and took off running, but someone had already beat her to it, Jay. Jay scooped Justy up, grabbing her hand an inspecting it, while Justy wrapped her free arm around Jay's neck, burrowing her face into his neck, still wailing. Jay looked up at Kim as she reached them both, \"Hornet stung her.\" Kim nodded, wondering why Jay would care this much about someone he just met. Kim carefully took Justy from Jay, taking her inside David's house to treat her finger. Jason walked up to Jay, and took him but his elbow, dragging him to the other side of the house where no one could see them, before he grabbed Jay by the collar, throwing him against the side of the house. \"What are you playing at!?\" Jason hissed. Jay looked taken back, \"What?\" \"No one does that, no one moves that fast to help someone! Not someone they just met!\" Jason growled, shoving Jay harder. \"When you run to help someone like you just did, it says that you care, a lot, so I'm going to ask you one time, why the hell do you care about her so much?!\" Jay paused, eyes wide. \"Are you… are you really beating me up, and yelling at me, because I tried to help your daughter?\" Jason paused, and Jay frowned, continuing. \"Because if you are, you have serious issues. You wanna know why I care so much about her Sensei Jason ?\" Jay had normally talked to Jason with a lot of respect, but now he was spitting out Jason's title. \"Because she deserves someone.\" Jay spat. \"She's got me!\" Jason protested. \"Yeah, you're such a great guy.\" Jay said sarcastically. \"Bullying people because they were trying to help your daughter.\" Jason stopped, letting Jay go. There was a long moment of silence, before Jason sighed, \"I'm sorry.\" \"Forget about it.\" Jay waved off, \"Believe it or not, you're actually the best Dad I've ever met.\" Jason sighed, \"Considering that your father was in the League, I don't have any trouble believing that.\" Jay shook his head, \"He wasn't in the League of Shadows, he's in the Court of Owls.\"[Chapter 17] Jay hadn't really made any friends in the neighborhood, but he did make a few acquaintances, and they played a good games of basketball whenever Jay had free time between chores around the house, and training with Jason. The other boys liked Jay, but they didn't understand why he brought his little sister everywhere with him. Whenever Jay wanted to ride the new bike that Uncle Dick had given him last week, he had Justin sitting on the handle bars. Whenever he was climbing the tree with the twisted limbs in the retention pond on the side of the neighborhood, he would carry Justin up with him in one arm. Whenever he went to play sports with the other boys, Justin would sit on the side, watching him play. Everyone could see that the two were inseparable. Jason didn't like it at first, but eventually he got over it. He admitted that he couldn't protect his daughter twenty-four seven, but with Jay, his daughter was completely safe. Kim and Jason had tried to put Jay into a high school, but Jay had tried it for a week, disappeared for two days, then turned up again, with his GED in his hand. After Jason was done yelling, and Kim was done hugging the life out of him, he just said, \"School sucks. Can I go play with Justin now?\" Matthew tried to snatch the ball away from Jay, but Jay jumped to the left, shooting the ball into the hoop. \"Horse!\" The boys on the other team groaned, while Justine jumped up and down, laughing, \"Go Jay! Go Jay! Go Jay!\" Jay scooped up Justin, \"Come one, dribble down the court!\" He rushed to the other end, scooping up the ball, handing it to Justine. She clutched at it, as he lifted her up as high as his arms could reach, \"Come on, shoot!\" Justine threw the ball, and it bounced off the hoop, nailing her in the face. \"Ah!\" Jay immediately pulled her down, making sure her nose wasn't broken. After he was positive that she wasn't really hurt, he just held her, telling her she'd be fine, and let her cry onto his shoulder. Matthew walked up to him as the other guys stared, \"Dude, what's wrong with you? You go everywhere with this baby.\" \"She's not a baby.\" Jay insisted, \"I take her everywhere because she's fun to play with.\" \"She's a little kid!\" Matthew said, slapping his forehead, \"And a girl for the love of God!\" Justine poked her head up, a grin spreading over her face, done with her drama. She pointed at Matthew, \"You're a girl!\" Jay cracked up, as did the other boys, while Matthew turned red. \"I'm not a girl, you're a girl!\" Matthew snapped, \"Girl's are stupid!\" Justin shook her head, \"I'm not stupid! I'm Batman!\" Everyone laughed at that. Jay put Justin down at the edge of the driveway as the boys lined up to play another game. Matthew paused after a few minutes, \"Hey, it's that freak .\" The boys stopped, looking across the street, seeing the only other kid in the neighborhood everyone hated. His name was Blake, and he looked like he was dead. He had pale skin, and ice blue eyes. He died his hair black, and wore black clothes with weird leather studded chokers and wrist bands. He painted his nails black, and wore black eyeliner. He listened to music that talked about depressing things. He creeped all the kids out, even though he hardly talked. He didn't just look creepy either, Matthew's friend Derek had seen Blake with a gun once, a real one. Blake had weird scars on his wrists that all the kids had seen him with. Concerned parents were constantly talking to Blake's parents about it, but nothing ever changed. Blake didn't even have his own room, he lived in his parent's basement, someone had heard him say he liked it because it was darker down there. The other boys would see him reading books about anatomy, and torture techniques. He had stolen Matthew's Robin action figure, and had tied him up with rubber bands, and had used the Chinese method of drowning him. When Matthew asked for his action figure back, Blake had poor gasoline on him, and set him on fire. No one ever talked to him after that, not much anyways. Jay didn't really care how Blake looked, but it was the weapons that raised a red flag. jay used weapons too, in training, but he doubted Blake was training as an assassin. So Jay chose to carefully avoid him, and keep Justin completely away from him. Jay shrugged, \"Let's just keep playing.\" As the boy's played, Justin got tired of watching. A big blue butterfly flew past her head, and she jumped up, rushed after it. She chased it around the Andrew's car, and across the street. It landed on the side of someone's mail box, and Justin jumped up to grab it, but before she could, someone grabbed her, yanking her out of the road. The minute she was out of the way, a red truck rushed down the road, the driver talking on the phone, rushing over the spot she had been standing in. Justine stared wide eyes, not fully comprehending what might have just happened to her. She looked up at her savior, pale skin, ice blue eyes, big black circles around his eyes. He looked like someone had used black crayon on his eyelids. The boy was a little taller than Jay, but a lot thinner. He raised an eyebrow, looking at her, then across the street where he knew her older brother was. A grin spread across his face, and he looked back at Justin, \"Do you know anything about ancient Roman torture? \"What does Roman mean?\" Blake grinned, \"This'll be fun.\" By the time Jay found out Justin was gone, Jay had already taken her down to the basement. Jay, Matthew, and the rest of the boys rushed around the neighborhood, looking for the girl, but they didn't find her, not even at the retention pond. Eventually, the other kids had to go home for dinner, and jay was not looking forward to telling Jason he had lost Justin. Jay walked home, going into the kitchen where Kim was trying to make dinner, and Jason was leaning against her, arms wrapped around her waist, trying to get her to pay attention to him. \"Um… Kim, Jason?\" They both looked up at Jay, and Jason frowned, \"Where's Justin?\" \"Um, that's the thing, you see-\" There was a sudden knocking on the front door, and Kim rushed to get it, desperate to get away from Jason's attempts at seducing her tonight. Jason groaned, \"Great, I'm not getting lucky tonight.\" Kim opened the front door, seeing a boy about Jay's age with a very heavy emo look about him, clutching the hand of her daughter, Justine. \"Excuse me ma'am, but does this belong to you?\" Kim's eyes widened, her daughters face was covered in white paste with huge black circles around her eyes, and caked on black lipstick. Her hair had been a brownish red this morning, tied up in pigtails with red power ranger bows. Now, her hair was jet black, with skull barrettes clipped on, and gelled heavily, slicked back. Her black batman t-shirt remained, but her jean overalls had been taken away, and replaced by a hot pink and black frilly tutu. \"Oh my God, what happened to her?\" Kim asked, covering her mouth with her hands. The boy smirked, \"We were playing in my room, and she got into my make up. Then she found one of my girlfriends tutu's.\" Justy beamed up at Kim, \"Look Mommy! I'm a goth!\" The boy frowned at her, \"Justy, remember what we talked about.\" \"Oh, yeah… I'm not a goth, I'm an honest picture of the human soul, dark and empty. Conformists have taken over our world, and I am one of the few people here who recognize life as what it is, dark, cold, painful, and meaningless.\" Justin droned. The boy smiled, \"We had fun, and she really likes my books. Especially the one about the specific tortures that Count Dracula forces upon his wife's that bore him sons instead of daughters.\" \"Spikes through their heads! Spikes through their heads!\" Justin said excitedly, jumping up and down, still clinging to the boy's hand. Kim paused for a minute, before looking over her shoulder into the kitchen, \"Jay! You better have a really good explanation for why my daughter is suddenly in a cult !\" The teenage boy scowled at her, then looked down to Justin, \"Wow, sorry kid. Looks like your mom is a conformist. She's worse than my mom.\" Justin gasped, \"Mommy!? You're a conformist!? No!\" Jason and Jay entered the room, and Jay paled, and Jason's eyebrow shot up, stepping around Kim, and scooping Justin up, \"Wow. I don't really like the tutu, but Kim, our daughter is seriously hardcore!\" \"Daddy, Mommy is a conformist!\" Kim groaned, \"It's to early for this.\" Jason and Kim turned to Jay, and Jason frowned, \"Jay, why was my daughter even with this kid?\" Jay paused, and then Blake interrupted, \"While Jay was playing sports, Justin was kind of bored, so Jay said I could take her over to my house. You know, to keep her from chasing butterflies into the street, and getting hit by cars.\" Jason groaned, \"Alright, whatever, but next time, have her home earlier.\" Kim glared at Jason, \"Jason, you're daughter looks like she just stumbled out of a KISS concert!\" Kim grabbed the tutu, carefully pulling the mess off of Justin's legs, leaving her in a diaper and t-shirt. She handed it back to Blake, \"Thanks for watching her. Did you want to stay for dinner?\" \"Nah, I better go lock myself in my room before my old man gets home. Maybe next time.\" Blake said, walking away from the house, and running across the street. Kim sighed, \"Jay, can you go give Justine a bath?\" Jay nodded, taking Justin in his arms, \"Come on, let's go get this grease off your face.\" \"Conformist!\" \"You don't even know what that word means.\" \"A conformist is someone who conforms! You're conforming with Mommy and Daddy!\" Justin protested. \"I don't wanna get a bath! I have rights! I have liberty!\" \"Blake.\" Jay growled, walking into the bathroom with a struggling Justine, \"You've ruined the next five weeks of my life.\" Kim turned to Jason as soon as Jay was out of ear range. \"Jason, you don't think that-\" \"I'll watch his house tonight Kim. But you have to understand, he's a kid, and he's in the rebelling stage. He's probably just upset his parents aren't agreeing with his clothes and music and stuff.\" Kim nodded, but she knew that look in Jason's eyes. If Blake's father laid a hand on that boy tonight, Jason was going to kill him.[Chapter 18] As soon as Jay knew Blake was home from school, he threw Justin on top of his shoulders, and headed over to Blake's house. Blake answered the door, smirking, and Justin immediately reached out for him, \"Play! Play! Play! Play!\" \"Uh, hi Blake.\" Jay mumbled. Blake nodded, \"Jay, was it?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Come on in.\" Blake said, and Jay followed him inside. Surprisingly, Blake's house wasn't dark at all. It was bright, with a tan on white color scheme that looked really nice. Photos with cool frames and modern art hung on the walls. When Blake passed the kitchen, he called out, \"Mom, I'm gonna be down in my room, with my friends, okay?\" Jay heard an exasperated woman sigh, and to his surprise, a beautiful woman with curly strawberry blonde hair walked out of the kitchen, and her eyes rested on Jay. She immediately blinked several times, \"Blake, he's your friend?\" Jay smiled at her, holding out his hand, \"Jay Todd.\" The woman shook his hand, \"Elliot Scotch.\" She turned back to Blake. \"Blake, I like this friend.\" Blake snorted, \"Yeah, because you're both conformist.\" Justine piped up, tired of being ignored, \"I wanna listen to Black Veil Brides!\" Elliot looked up at Justine, \"Oh, you're little sister? If you want, I'll put on some of my daughter's old Barbie movies for her, so you boys can play alone.\" \"No way Mom, that kid's hardcore.\" Blake said. \"No thank you Ma'am.\" Jay said politely. \"Die conformist!\" Justin spat angrily, jabbing her finger at Elliot. Elliot looked at Justine oddly, \"Um, okay then…\" Blake took Jay down into the basement, and Jay understood why Blake stayed down here. It was probably the biggest room in the house, and every wall was covered in posters of bands, weird symbols, and pictures of weapons and torture scenes Blake had probably drawn himself. Along with the stereotypical emo stuff, Blake also had several comic book figures on one wall. Rorschach, Night Owl, and the other Watchmen, some of the Minutemen too. Blake was one surprise after another. Justin scrambled down from Jay's shoulders, immediately scurried under Blake's bed, coming out with a big plastic box, filled with CD's. \"What are those?\" Blake shrugged, \"Most of them aren't appropriate unless I'm alone, and actually feeling lonely, others are music.\" He grabbed one off the top, handing it to Justine, \"Pop it in.\" Justine slapped the CD into the player, turning the volume up, and plopped down, happily listening to music screaming about death and sadness while she played with Blake's action figures. Jay sat down on the bed with Blake, \"Why'd you cover for me?\" Blake shoved his nose into a book about Edward Poe. \"Simple thank you would do.\" \"No, I mean, thank you, but why?\" \"Why not?\" Blake snapped, \"Don't be a girl Jay.\" Justine's head snapped up at Blake, \"Hey!\" \"You're not a girl Justin, you're Batman.\" Blake said halfheartedly. \"Okay.\" Justin said, shrugging it off. Jay sighed, \"Look Blake, you don't owe me anything. I've heard all the crap the other kids in the neighborhood say about you, and I've never contradicted them once. I never stand up for you!\" \"That doesn't matter.\" Blake said, putting his book down and looking up at Jay, \"The only thing that matters is that you've never said the things they have. You never call me a freak. You don't leave little notes in my locker telling me to go back to Hell so I can annoy my birth father a little more. You don't ask me how I got rid of the three sixes on my forehead. Honestly, Jay, I've considered suicide before, and the only reason I don't do it some days is because then that would just prove right every punk ass kid in this neighborhood that like to pretend that they don't go to dark places in their mind too. Now for the love of God, stop being such a girl and just put on some eyeliner.\" Jay paused, then sighed, realizing in a situation like this, with someone like Blake, you just needed to be comforting. \"Blake, if you ever do commit suicide, I will dig you up from your grave, and set you on fire.\" Blake paused, \"That would make a great song title. I'll make up the lyrics later.\" Jay raised an eyebrow at Blake, \"Dude, why are you depressed all the time? Dressing like this can't help much.\" \"You're such a conformist Jay.\" Blake snorted, \"I wasn't depressed until about two days after I started dressing like this. The minute I put on a black t-shirt, a wrist band, and drew circles under my eyes, every single friend I had deserted me, and started hanging out with dime in a dozen guys like Matthew. That's when this started up.\" Blake pulled back his shirt sleeve, showing deep scars down his wrist in a crisscross pattern. \"I stopped three months ago, haven't touched the razor since. My parents tried to get me counseling, I just told my shrink to shove it.\" Jay bit his lower lip, \"Hey, you ever play basketball?\" \"That's pointless.\" \"The point is fun.\" Jay said, and then gestured around the room, \"And if your being honest, all this must be some kind of fun for you, otherwise, you would have started wearing blue jeans and Gap shirts a long time ago.\" \"… you ever heard of Hollywood Undead?\" \"Never.\" Jay brushed off. \"They've got this great song, it's called Bullet.\" Blake said, swapping the CD's out of his player. \"What's it about?\" Jay asked. \"Suicide.\" \"Right, naturally.\" To his surprise, when the lyrics started, Justine started singing along with the band. She jumped up and down, singing the song with her tiny little voice while Blake shouted them out with his deep baritone. \"My legs are dangling off the edge, the bottom of the bottle is my only friend! I think I slit my wrists again, and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone. My legs are dangling off the edge, a stomach full of pills didn't work again! I'll put a bullet in my head, and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone.\" Blake jumped in, \"I went to far, now I'm gone again. It's gone on to long, tell you how it ends. I'm sitting on the edge with my two best friends, one's a bottle of pills, and one's a bottle of gin. I'm twenty stories up, yeah I'm up at the top. I polished off the bottle and it's sliding me off. Asphalt to me has never looked so soft. My mom got my letter and she's called the cops.\" \"I gotta take this opportunity before I miss it, cause now I hear the sirens, yeah they're off in the distance.\" Justin giggled. Does she even know what she's singing about? \"Believe me when I say that I've been persistent, but now my mind is scared, more scared than my wrist is. I've been trying to long with to dull a knife, but tonight I made sure that I sharpened it twice.\" They continued, \"I've never bought a suit before in my life, but when you go to meet God, you know you wanna look nice.\" Nope, she probably didn't. LATER THAT NIGHT WITH KIM AND JUSTIN: \"When is Daddy coming home?\" Justin asked, yawning, as Kim picked her up out of the bathtub, wrapping a towel around her, rocking her back and forth in her arms gently. \"He'll be here in the morning baby, I promise.\" Kim whispered. \"I love you Mommy.\" Justin yawned. \"I love you more.\" Kim assured her, walking into Justin's room, and placing her on the changing table, Justin was still going through that awkward potty training faze, so they kept it just in case. Kim pulled out a black pair of footie pajamas, with Nightwing stripes going from the chest to the sleeves, only thing different, they were red. Jason had gotten her them, and Justin liked them, not as much as her Robin pajamas, but she liked them. Justine looked up at her mother as Kim pulled the footie pajamas on her, \"Guess how much I love you.\" Kim paused, \"Well, I don't think I could guess that.\" Justin smiled tiredly, holding out her arms, \"I love you this much!\" Kim nodded, and then held out her own arms, \"Well, I love you this much.\" Justin paused, seeing how much longer her mother's arms were. She stood up on the table, stretching up as high as she could, \"I love you as high as I can reach!\" Kim stretched up to, \"Well, I love you as high as I can reach!\" Justin let her arms drop, frowning at how much taller her mother was. She scrambled down from the table, jumping into the air, \"I love you as high as I can hop!\" Kim nodded, laughing, \"Well, I love you as high as I can hop.\" Kim jumped up into the air, her fingers brushing against the ceiling. Justin stuck out her lower lip in a pout, thinking carefully, before sighed, rubbing her eyes tiredly, not knowing what else she could show her mother that she couldn't out distance. \"Okay then.\" Kim smiled, picking up Justine, and carrying her to her small bed, past her window. Justin looked over her mother's shoulder, seeing the moon dangling in the sky. Kim set Justin in the bed, pulling the covers around her. \"Mommy?\" Kim looked at Justin, \"Yes?\" \"I love you all the way to the moon.\" Justin yawned. Kim paused, \"Well, that is a long way away, isn't it?\" Justin nodded, smiling before falling asleep. Kim stood up, walking to the edge of the bedroom, turning the lights off. Justin didn't sleep with a nightlight, she would complain about it being to bright. Kim smiled at her sleeping daughter, \"Well, I love you all the way to the moon, and back.\" Kim shut the door, stepping into the hallway. The minute she did, hands circled around her waist. Someone's face nuzzled into her neck, and breath tickled the back of her neck. \"Jason.\" Kim whispered, sighing with content. Jason smirked against her neck, \"I love you.\" Kim smiled, \"I love you more.\" Jason chuckled, turning Kim around in his arms, and pressing her up against the wall. \"How much do you love me?\" Kim smiled, \"Oh, all the way to the moon.\" Jason laughed, scooping Kim up in his arms, rushing her into their bedroom, and tossing her onto the bed, before jumping on her gently. \"Well Kimmy, I love you all the way to the moon and back.\"[Chapter 19] Justine ran around in circles, trying to catch falling leaves in Justin's back yard, while Jay and Blake watched from the porch, drinking hot chocolate that Kim had given them. \"So, just you me and the kid today huh?\" Blake asked. Jay shook his head, \"Naw, Kyler's supposed to come over here with her Dad I think.\" \"Now why is that kid always around here?\" Blake asked, \"Doesn't she have her own home?\" Jay smirked at him, \"The same could be said about you. You're over here everyday after school, and you sleep over every weekend.\" \"Yeah, well sorry if I don't wanna go home.\" Blake shrugged. An uncomfortable silence settled over the two of them. Jay knew that Blake didn't like his parents, but wondered why. Was there some reason other than Blake's fashion choices? Jay could never work up the nerve to ask Blake. He was torn between wanted to help his friend, and the fact it was probably none of his business. Still, Blake seemed pretty open to hinting at it. Justin suddenly squealed in delight, rushing over to the porch, a big red leaf clutched in her hands, \"I caught it!\" Jay scooped Justin up, pulling her onto his lap, and then tickling her. Justin squealed, \"No! Stop Jay! Stop!\" Jay laughed, and stopped tickling her, offering her a sip of his hot chocolate. \"Careful, it's hot.\" Justin ignored his warning, taking a big mouthful of the hot chocolate so her cheeks looked like a chipmunks, and then spitting it all over Jay's face. Jay cried out, and Justin bolted off of his lap, scurrying under the table while Jay dabbed at his eyes, \"Ugh!\" Jay peeked through his squinted eyelids at Justin, \"Kid, as soon as my face stops burning like hell, you're gonna get it!\" Justin gasped, clinging to the chair legs, \"Blake!\" Blake just laughed, \"No way kid, I'm staying out of this one.\" The back gate swung open, and Kyler rushed into the back yard, \"Justy! Justy!\" Justine scrambled out from under the table, rushing over to Kyler, \"Kylie!\" Jay and Blake looked up as the gate swung open again, expecting to see Kyler's dad, but instead, a beautiful girl walked in. Blake and Jay immediately both dropped their jaws in sync, staring at her as she walked in. She had honey blonde hair, and piercing green eyes. In tune with the cold weather, she was wearing a pale purple sweater and long baby blue sweat pants. Her sweater hugged her frame, showing off her natural curves, and making her eyes stand out. Jay immediately looked down at his shirt, cursing as he saw chocolate stains all over it. Blake snickered at him, standing up from his chair, \"Your loss man.\" Blake crossed the yard, walking up to this new girl, \"Hey.\" She looked up at him, smiling shyly, \"Hi, are you Jay?\" Blake shook his head, \"Nah, I'm Blake, his friend. And you are?\" She smiled, \"I'm Caitlin, Kyler's cousin, I came in from Star City for Halloween.\" Blake's eyes lit up, \"You like Halloween?\" Caitlin nodded, \"Love it.\" If there was one holiday that stood out to Blake from the rest of them, it was Halloween. And a girl who liked Halloween? This girl just went up a few notches in his mental hot meter. \"Me too, favorite holiday.\" Caitlin nodded, \"So, what are you going as?\" Blake waved his finger back and forth, teasingly, \"Now, that is a surprise, but I'll tell you this, it's a classic.\" Caitlin laughed a little, \"Really? Mine too. I don't keep secrets though, so I'll just tell you. I'm going to be Snow White.\" And now she dropped to the middle of the hot meter. \"Oh? Well, I'm going as something scary.\" Caitlin giggled, \"Scary? Have fun with that, I like looking cute.\" Blake nodded, \"Alright, whatever.\" Blake made a beeline for the front porch, shaking his head at Jay, \"You can have her man, she's so not my type. To giggly. Way , to happy.\" Jay jumped up, brushing chocolate off his shirt, \"Sweet.\" Blake pulled his grey turtleneck over his head, revealing a black wife beater underneath. \"Here ya go man, good luck, I've gotta get home.\" Jay raised an eyebrow, taking the turtle neck, \"You're walking home in that? It's cold outside dude.\" Blake picked up his unfinished hot chocolate, \"No worries, I'll return the mug. Maybe.\" Jay shook his head as Blake left, rushing out into the yard and scooping up Justin, Throwing her over his shoulder and twirling her around, \"I got ya!\" Justin squealed, and Caitlin smiled at Jay, \"So, you're Jay?\" Jay nodded, smiling, \"Yeah, Caitlin, right?\" She nodded. \"That's right. You know, you're really good with her.\" Jay shrugged, setting Justin down. \"What can I say, she's my little sister, gotta love this brat.\" Caitlin smiled, \"That's sweet.\" Justin and Kyler rushed off to chase leaved, until they fell down dizzy. Justin looked up at Kyler, \"Hey Kyler, what are you gonna be for Halloween? Speedy?\" Kyler shook her head, smiling, \"No. Are you gonna be Nightwing?\" Justin grinned from ear to ear, \"No.\" Kyler suddenly gasped, pointing behind Justin, at Caitlin and Jay. Justine looked over her shoulder, and nearly screamed. Jay and Caitlin were doing something Justin had only seen her parents do to each other, and Blake do to a few girls before. They were kissing! Justin turned back to Kyler, asking her, \"Do you like it?\" Kyler shook her head, \"No, do you?\" Justin glared over at Caitlin, \" No .\" Kyler raised an eyebrow, \"Then what do we do?\" Justin furrowed her eyebrows, \"What I do whenever I want to play with Daddy, but he's hugging Mommy. We sabedoge it.\" \"Sabedoge? What's that?\" Kyler asked. \"It's when you stop something from happening.\" Justin said, \"Like Jay and Caitlin gettin' married.\" Justin explained. Kyler's eyes widened, \"Married!? They're gonna get married!?\" \"Well, they're already kissing! You know how the song goes, first comes love, then comes marriage, then comes-\" \"Babies!\" Kyler exclaimed. \"No! I don't want Caitlin to get prego Justin!\" \"What's prego?\" \"It's when you have a baby inside of you, I heard my mommy say it once. She said that if Daddy wasn't more careful, she was gonna get prego again.\" \"What happens when you're prego?\" Justin asked. Kyler shivered, \"I saw it in a movie once, you get really fat , and you're angry and sad all the time , and you yell at people even when they don't do anything to you, and then you get even fatter !\" Justin's eyes widened, \"What if Caitlin doesn't get prego, what if Jay get's prego?\" Kyler shrugged, \"Well, then it won't be my problem anymore.\" Justin went pale. \"I don't want Jay to get prego Kyler, if he turns into one of those fatties, then he can't play Batman and Robin anymore!\" Kyler nodded, \"And if Caitlin get's prego, then she can't play Green Arrow and Speedy anymore!\" Justin nodded, \"Alright then, we've gotta bust them up!\" Kyler nodded, \"Okay!\" They were both silent for a moment, until Kyler asked, \"How?\" Justin practically deflated, \"I don't know.\" \"Well, what do you do when you want your Daddy to play with you, and stop hugging your Mommy?\" Kyler asked. \"I tell Daddy I want him to play Batman and Robin with me.\" Justin said. Kyler nodded, \"Okay, whenever I want my Daddy to stop hugging my Mommy, I tell my Mommy that I wanna play princess.\" \"Okay, you get Caitlin, I'll get Jay.\" Justin ordered. Kyler grabbed Justin's hand, \"Wait, we need a name for the mission.\" \"A name?\" Justin asked. \"Yeah, that's what heroes do, it's what my Daddy does whenever he goes on a mission.\" Justin nodded, \"Okay, we'll call it mission prevent the prego.\" Kyler nodded, \"Okay, and after we do it, we have to write a report on it.\" \"Write?\" Justin asked. \"But I'm not even in kindergarten yet!\" Kyler frowned, \"Oh yeah, neither am I.\" They both paused, until Kyler brightened, \"I've got it! We'll write in our own code! We'll make it up, and it'll be our own way for writing.\" Justin nodded, \"Okay then.\" Kyler nodded, \"Alright, begin mission prevent the prego!\" Justin and Kyler launched themselves at Jay and Caitlin, Kyler shouting, \"I wanna go home and play princess!\" Justin latched onto Jay's leg giving him her best puppy dog eyes ever, \"Jay, please play Batman and Robin with me!\" Caitlin said goodbye to Jay, and took Kyler home immediately. Jay dug out the black cowl and cape for Batman, and the green domino mask and yellow short cape for Robin, and then Justin and Jay ran around their backyard, catching Poison Ivy, Penguin, Two Face, and even Joker all day long. And Yes, Justin nad Kyler weren't pronouncing sabotage right, they kept saying it sabedoge because they're kids, and they're only two. Kyler is actually a few months older than Justin, so she'll probably be getting her birthday soon.[Chapter 20] Justin jumped up and down excitedly, while her mother tried to secure her mask in place, \"And I'm gonna get a Hershey bar! And gum! And pixie stix! And candy apples! And M&M;'s! And Mars bars! And Tootsie rolls! And-\" \"And if you don't stay still so I can put your costume on, you aren't going.\" Kim warned. Justin stayed still, letting her mother tie the mask on, \"There, all done Justin.\" \"Okay. And I'm gonna get jawbreakers! And ring pops! And butterfingers! And milky ways! And baby ruths! And snickers! And nerds! And tootsie pops!\" Jay came in, smirking down at Justin, \"Nice costume.\" Justin was decked out in a black muscle shirt and black pants, with red stitching all across the legs, up the chest, and around the neck. Kim had strapped a red mask around her face that covered her cheek bones up to her forehead. \"Thank you!\" Justin giggled, \"You make a great Luke Skywalker!\" Jay looked down at his Luke Skywalker costume, taking out his light saber and turning it on, \"I will never join the dark side!\" \"I am your father!\" Justin said, trying to sound like Darth Vader. \"Hey!\" Jason said coming into the room, \"How's the costumes com-\" He froze, staring down at Justin… \"Kim… What the hell is your daughter wearing?\" Kim smirked, \"It's all on you, Jason. You let your daughter watch WWE wrestling, so now you're going to pay the price.\" \"NO!\" Jason protested. Justin gasped, \"Daddy, are you Daniel Bryan!?\" Jay stifled his laughter, pulling his hood over his head, snorting. Jason took a deep breath, getting down on one knee to look Justin in the eye, \"Justy, baby, are you sure you wanna dress up like this? Do you even know who you are?\" \"I'm KANE!\" Justin yelled excitedly. \"Well, yeah I get that but, you're a girl-\" \"I AM THE DEVILS FAVORITE DEMON!\" Justin screamed, and Jason nearly flinched. Yep, he could here a bat voice under that little girl voice. Damn it. \"Justy, why would you even want to dress up like Kane?\" Jason groaned. Seeing his little girl dressed up like the demon himself was not something Jason particularly liked . \"Because he's cool! You said that he was the best!\" Justin said, fingering her mask. \"Well,\" Jay interjected, \"Actually MC Punk is the best, he is the-\" \"Jay. Shut up. Kane could take him easily.\" Jason snapped. He turned back to Justine, \"But Justy, the point is, you don't exactly know what kind of person Kane is, and honey, he's-\" \"He is the devil's favorite demon.\" Justy said, going into the deepest voice she could manage. \"He grew up locked in a basement, suffering severe physiological and emotional scarring when his brother set his parents on fire.\" Jason raised an eyebrow, listening as his daughter raved on about Kane. \"From there he sifted among a variety of mental institution until he was grown, at which point, he buried his brother alive. Twice. Since then, he's set a couple of people on fire, and abducted various coworkers. He once electrocuted a man's testacies.\" Jason covered his face with his hands, groaning. \"He had a girlfriend named Katie, but let's just say that didn't turn out to well. His real father is a guy named Paul Bearer, who he recently trapped in a meat locker. He's been married and divorced, broke up his ex-wife's wedding, and tomb stoned the priest. And for reasons never quite explained, has an unhealthy obsession with torturing Pete Rose.\" Jason was silent for a minute, before sighing, \"Alright, Justin, you make one great Kane. Now go find yourself a Daniel Bryan.\" \"Yay!\" Justin said, and the doorbell rang. \"Kyler!\" Jay scooped Justin up, taking her to the door, and opened it to see Caitlin and Kyler standing there, in a black shirt and pants, but the shirt and red and grey streaks on the sleeves. She had aquiver and a bow strapped to her back, and a pillowcase in one hand. Justin frowned, looking at Kyler, \"Who are you?\" Kyler smiled excitedly, \"I'm Katniss! Who are you?\" \"Who the hell is Katniss?\" Justin asked, and Kim groaned, \"And for your information, I AM KANE!\" Kyler frowned, raising and eyebrow, \"Who's Kane?\" Two seconds ticked by before Justin sighed, and opened her mouth, \"Kane is the devils favorite demon. He grew up locked in a basement, suffering severe physiological and emotional scarring when his brother set his parents on fire and-\" Jay put his hand over her mouth, \"And, you Caitlin, look gorgeous.\" Caitlin blushed looking down at her costume, Snow White. \"Uh, really? Thanks. You look cute.\" Jay smiled a little, before Justin latched onto his leg desperately, \"Jay! Jay! Jay! Come on! Come on! Let's go trick or treat!\" \"Not now, we have to wait for Blake to get here, and-\" A suddenly voice took them off, deep and throaty, \"Well kiddies, you shouldn't wait out here… in the dark.\" They all spun around to see a tall man, with a red and green stripped sweater, and leather gloves with long metal nails. His face was badly burned, and he had a wicked grin. Caitlin screamed, grabbing Kyler up off the ground, and jumping behind Jay. Jay's eyes widened, staring at none other then Freddy Krueger. Justin's jaw went slack, pulling her Kane mask on a little tighter, hoping she looked scarier then Freddy. Freddy let out a cackle, \"Now why are you screaming? I haven't cut you yet!\" Jay grabbed Justin, shoving her into Caitlin's arms right next to Kyler. \"Run! I'll hold him off!\" Caitlin took off, darting down the street to try and get to her Uncle Roy's house. Jay turned to Freddy, falling into a fighting stance, \"Get ready to go back to Hell.\" Freddy jumped forward, and Jay did too. Caitlin heard jay scream from down the street, and seeing as she wasn't even halfway to her uncle's house, she turned, and ran off into the woods bordering one side of the neighborhood. When she felt she had run far enough, she dropped the girls, and Kyler started sobbing, \"C-Caitlin! W-what are we gonna do!?\" Caitlin panted, \"Just… just stay calm, we have to stay calm.\" Justin snorted, crossing her arms, \"You dummy! Why didn't you just take us back into my house? My Daddy coulda shot that guy!\" Caitlin paused, never having heard a toddler talk like that. \"Uh… because Freddy was right there , and he could have easily killed Jay and broken the door down? And about your dad, sorry, but I'm not trusting my life to a guy I just met.\" \"Yeah well… you're still a dummy!\" Justin proclaimed. \"Bad things happen in the woods! Don't you watch any movies!?\" Kyler stopped crying for a moment, panting heavily, \"W-what happens in the woods?\" Before Caitlin could stop her, Justin blurted out, \"A guy with a chainsaw! That's what happens in the woods!\" \"Why a chainsaw?' Kyler whimpered. \"So he can tear off your face and use it as a mask.\" Justin said, as if telling someone what the weather would be like tomorrow. Kyler's face froze, a few seconds ticked by, and she let out a small squeak. \"Caitlin!\" Caitlin, having gathered her wits again, asked, \"What?\" \"I need to change my costume.\" Kyler said, embarrassed. Caitlin sighed, and Justin raised an eyebrow, \"Why?\" Kyler grew red in the face, \"I started potty training last week, and I'm not that good at it…\" Justin's eyes grew wide, \"You started potty training!? But… I'm still in huggies!\" Caitlin groaned, \"Kyler, Justin, have you girls ever been in these woods before?\" Justin nodded, \"Yeah, lots of times with Jay and Blake, they know all the best hiding places for when Mommy and Daddy say it's bath time.\" \"Then can you find the way back?\" Caitlin asked. Justin paused, \"Uh… ai bath time, the sun is still up.\" Kyler nodded, \"Yeah, daddy takes me here at dark sometimes! I can get us home!\" Caitlin brightened, \"Really?\" She nodded, \"Yeah, come on Justin, help me up that tree!\" Justin and Kyler darted over to a tall tree with a narrow trunk, and Justin got on all fours, Kyler standing on her back, and hugging the tree trunk with her arms and legs, shimmying up the tree like Mario did on that old Super Mario, Nintendo sixty four game Uncle Roy had. Kyler climbed up quickly, almost all the way to the top, looking around the forest. \"I see the neighborhood! But we should run away from it.\" \"Why?\" Caitlin called up, not quite sure why she wasn't alarmed by the fact her two and a half year old cousin was that high up a tree. \"Cause that scary guy is coming!\" Kyler shouted, scrambling down from the tree into Caitlin's arms. As soon as Kyler was on the ground again, Freddy dashed into the clearing. Caitlin screamed again, backing up slowly, her back hitting the tree trunk. \"Gonna make you bleed girly.\" Freddy snickered. Kyler whimpered, \"Which girl is he talking about?\" \"Well Caitlin's the only one here in a dress!\" Justin hissed. Freddy walked closer, \"Do you know who I am?\" \"Darth Vader?\" Kyler asked. Freddy actually hesitated, \"Wait… what?\" \"You're face is all burned up, are you Darth Vader without the mask and helmet and all the black?\" Kyler asked. \"I AM NOT DARTH VADER!\" Freddy roared, \"I'M A DEMON STRAIGHT FROM HELL!\" Kyler brightened, \"Oh yeah, well Justin is the devil's favorite demon! Tell him Justin!\" Justin paused as Freddy's gaze turned to her, \"One demon to another… eat Kyler first.\" Kyler turned to look at Justin, her mouth open like a codfish, \"What!?\" Freddy just started laughing, it dimmed down form a cackle, to a voice Caitlin remembered immediately. Freddy let his gloves fall, his hands going up to the edge of his face, and peeling his flesh off. Kyler screamed, and Caitlin jumped forward, smacking him across the face. Justin gasped, \"Whoa, your cousin's got brass balls!\" Freddy hissed, \"Ouch! Jesus Caitlin, it was just a joke!\" Justin frowned, and Freddy turned to wink at her, but it wasn't Freddy. Justin brightened, \"Blake!\" Blake scooped Justin up, hugging her, \"You bet kid, and from one demon to another, you'd totally survive a Freddy Cougar movie.\" Justin smiled, \"Okay.\" \"Kid… who are you dressed as anyways?\" Blake asked. \"Kane!' Justin said happily. Silence. \"From WWE.\" \"Oh, that guy.\" Blake said. \"Wait a minute.\" Caitlin said, \"If you were Freddy, then where's Jay?\" Blake snorted, \"Come on out lover boy!\" Jay jogged into the clearing, stopping next to Caitlin, opening his arms for a hug, \"Hey look! I'm alive Caitlin!\" Caitlin glared at him, \"I should smack you.\" Jay put on his best puppy dog eyes, \"But… I wanted a hug.\" Caitlin smiled, \"Oh… you're so adorable.\" As Caitlin went in for a hug, Justin shouted, \"Jay! Jay! Jay! I wanna go trick or treat!\" Kyler grabbed onto Caitlin's leg, \"Me too! Me too!\" Jay took Justin from Blake, and Caitlin sighed, scooping up Kyler from the ground. Jay leaned into peck Caitlin on the cheek, \"Later, maybe?\" Caitlin nodded, \"Oh, you just wait until these kiddies are asleep.\" Blake sighed, \"And now I, alas, am the lonely, third wheel, bachelor.\" Caitlin rolled her eyes, \"Your dress up like that on Halloween, and you're number one flaw with yourself is you don't have a girlfriend?\" \"I think all of our primary concerns should be that Justin dressed up as the most demonic character of WWE.\" Blake snapped. Caitlin nodded, \"Actually, I'm gonna have to agree with emo boy on this one. What's wrong with that kid?\" Jay sighed, \"We don't know, we only pray there's a cure.\" Justin raised an eyebrow when everyone laughed, not understanding the joke. Jay shrugged, \"And hey, at least she didn't dress up as MC Punk right? Or even worse-\" \"Hilary Clinton?\" Blake guessed. \"I was gonna say Casey Anthony, but they're both probably on equal footing.\" Jay relented.[Chapter 21] Justin and Kyler were happily walking in front of the older teenagers, rooting through their bags of candy, planning on what the eat first. Caitlin and Jay were holding hands, but Justin and Kyler didn't even notice. The minute they got home, Blake took the two girls outside, and Jay and Caitlin quickly grabbed their candy bags. Once they came back in, Jay kneeled down in front of them both, \"Kyler, Justin, we have a confession to make.\" Justin and Kyler looked at each other, then back up at them. \"What?\" Kyler asked. Blake and Caitlin exchanged guilty looks, and then Jay took a deep breath, \"We ate all your Halloween candy.\" Kyler froze, her eyes widening, one eyebrow higher than the other. \"What? You ate all my suckers?\" Caitlin nodded, \"Yes, we did. I'm so sorry Kylie.\" Kyler slumped forward, bursting into tears, \"AAAAAAHHHH!\" Justin paused, staring up at Jay and Blake, before clenching her tiny fists, jumping at Jay's knees, hitting and biting, drawing blood. Jay pried her off, holding her out at arms distance as she tried to kick him, \"Justy, I'm sorry!\" She grunted, still trying to kick him, \"I don't want you to eat any more of my candy !\" \"But it's all gone!\" Blake explained. Justin reeled, \"You… you conformist!\" Blake nodded, sighing. \"Yes, I'm a conformist for taking your candy. I'm sorry Justy.\" \"We… worked… so hard for that candy!\" Kyler sobbed. Justin nodded, \"We walked door to door, begging for candy!\" Caitlin sighed, \"I know, and I'm really sorry that we ate your candy. Do you forgive us?\" Kyler nodded, \"I… forgive you… C-Caitlin.\" Jay looked down at Justin, \"Do you forgive me?\" \"No!\" Justin screamed, \"I want my candy!\" Caitlin leaned down, hugging Kyler. \"Thank you Kyler, I love you.\" Kyler nodded, wiping away her tears, \"I… l-love… y-you too.\" Blake and Jay both hugged Justin at the same time, both saying, \"I love you Justin.\" Justin smacked them both, \"I hate you!\" Jay sighed, turning to Caitlin, \"You win, here's the money.\" Jay handed Caitlin ten dollars, and then turned back to Justin, \"We were just kidding, we didn't eat your candy.\" Kyler looked up at Caitlin as she handed her the big pillow case of candy. Instead of talking, Kyler just grabbed the pillow case, hugging it tightly. Justin grabbed her pillow case, taking off for her bedroom, \"NO ONE TOUCHES MY CANDY ANYMORE!\" Blake groaned, \"Great, now we know who loves their older sibling more. I'm just mad we didn't win.\" Once Justin and Kyler went to sleep, Jay, Blake, and Caitlin stepped outside, running off and playing with the other teenagers. \"Hey Jay?\" Caitlin asked, turning around to see Blake and Jay staring at another girl, dressed like a vampire. A vampire who was pale, and showed off that quality by showing a lot of skin. Caitlin frowned, looking down at her own costume. It was modest, which was why she had chosen it instead of the bumble bee costume. \"Caitlin?\" Jay asked, finally noticing her, \"Are you okay?\" Caitlin looked up, \"Yeah! Yes, I am, just uh, tired. So, um, I'm gonna go ahead and go home. See ya, uh, around Christmas or… whatever.\" Caitlin turned, heading towards her uncles house, where her parents were waiting in the car. Jay turned to Blake, who had managed to get the vampire chick around his arm. \"Uh, you go ahead Jay, go after your girl. I'll have your back… from the back of my dad's truck.\" The vampire girl just giggled. Jay could only guess what Blake would be doing there. Jay followed Caitlin inside Roy's house, into the guest room. Caitlin turned around, finally noticing him. \"Oh, Jay. What are you-\" She was cut off by Jay's lips on hers. When he finally pulled away, he looked at her, \"You know, the only reason I was looking at the girl was because I was picturing you in that outfit right?\" Caitlin blushed, \"Jay, I-\" \"I know, you wanna go slow. I respect that. But whenever you're ready, Caitlin, I promise you I'll still be right here, waiting.\" Caitlin paused, before throwing herself at Jay, tackling him to the floor, \"Jesus, where did I find a guy like you!?\" Before Jay could even answer, Caitlin's lips were on his, her tongue sneaking it's way into his mouth. Jay immediately responded, flipping her over so he was on top of her, pushing her tongue away with his own, and then entering her mouth. He ran his tongue over her front teeth, and felt her shudder beneath him. He pulled away for air, \"Caitlin…\" She smiled up at him, \"Jay, are you just going to stare at me, or are you going to kiss me again?\" Jay's tongue practically leapt back into her mouth, darting around, rushing over teeth and tongue, exploring every crevice. \"Caitlin, are you- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TWO DOING!?\" Caitlin and Jay jerked away from each other, seeing her Uncle Roy standing there, fuming. \"GET OUT OF MY HOUSE TODD!\" Jay rushed out past Roy, avoiding the knife aimed at his head, over the fence, and down the street, not stopping until he was safely inside his own house. He took a deep breath, walking past Kim and Jason's room, before pausing, pressing his ear to their door. \"OH Mr. Todd~!\" Jay shuddered, trying not to imagine what was going on in that room, and Justin popped up out of no where, \"Jay, what are Mommy and Daddy doing?\" Jay scooped her up before she could open the door and find out, \"There's a ghost in their room. Let's go hide!\" \"Okay!\"[Chapter 22] Christmas was right around the corner, and every house on the block showed it. Roofs, fences, trees, and bushes were decorated with lights, and the more… eccentric neighbors were in a bit of a fork on the road. Roy Harper glared at Jason Todd, before thanksgiving had rolled around, Roy had lived three miles away from Jason. But after Roy had once again royally screwed himself, Roy and Anna had moved into a bigger house with the extra bedrooms needed now that the doctor said there would be two little bundles of joy popping out this time around. That house happened to be right across the street from Jason. Kyler and Justin had both turned three, and Justin had finally caught up to Kyler in potty training. The closer the two girls got, the more their parents argued. \"I'm telling you, my house is more festive.\" Roy growled out. Jason rolled his eyes, \"No, it's to over the top, multi-colored lights? Bah. I'll stick with the white ones, thank you very much.\" Kim and Anna rolled their eyes at the men, going back to taking the third batch of cookies out of the oven, swatting away Jay's hands as he tried to grab one for himself. \"Jay, you wait for them to cool off!\" Jay sighed, \"Yes ma'am.\" When Kim turned back to look at the cookie tray, eight of her chocolate shipped goods were gone, and two little girls running out the back door were the culprits. Kim glared at Jay, smart enough to recognize a plot when she saw one. \"You better be damn glad that we need a baby sitter that has two fully functioning legs young man. Other wise, you're be in the ER right about now, needing a cast.\" Jay's eyes grew wide, \"Well… uh, I'm really glad that I just have a wonderful mother like you who loves me very much, and is beautiful beyond comparison?\" Kim paused, before sighing, \"You're gonna make one hell of a husband one of these days boy. Until then, you're doing the dishes tonight.\" \"Love you too mom!\" OUTSIDE: Justin and Kyler sat on a log in the snow, Justin was stuffing her face with the cookies, Kyler was scribbling down their recent adventures in the book they had taken to writing their code in. Their personal way of writing was boxes, triangles, circles and rectangles with designs inside them, and various lines. \"And then Jay was never allowed to see or call my cousin Caitlin again.\" Kyler concluded, finally putting her pencil down, \"Wow, we finally got done writing down our Halloween adventure!\" Justin looked up, chocolate smeared across her lips, \"Do you think we'll have a Christmas adventure too?\" \"I sure hope it isn't a long one.\" Kyler said, \"My hands hurts.\" Justin pulled her mitten back on, \"Hey, ya wanna walk around the woods to try and find one?\" \"Find what?\" \"A Christmas adventure!\" Justin beamed. Kyler nodded, \"Alright, we can take my sled, and try and slide down the biggest hill we find!\" Justin sighed, \"Well, it'll do for now.\" They headed down to the woods next to the retention pond, but once they got there, Justin wasn't so sure about the sled anymore. The retention pond was always nearly full to the brim with run off water from the cigarette factory nearby, so it was more like a man made pond, and once winter had set in, it had frozen over. Justin beamed, \"Let's go ice skating!\" Kyler frowned, \"Don't be stupid, ginger, we don't have ice skates.\" Justin glared back at Kyler, \"Don't call me stupid, you fat Jew!\" The girls had heard both of their fathers yell such insults at each other and other people, and considering Kyler was Jewish, Justin had taken up calling her that, whenever their parents weren't around. \"We don't need ice skates anyways!\" Justin smirked, \"We have boots, they'll work, just like sliding across the kitchen floor in your socks.\" To prove her point, Justin stepped out onto the ice, slipping forward, and landing on her stomach, \"Ouch!\" Kyler laughed, and Justin glared at her, \"Don't laugh at me, Jew!\" Justin stood up shakily again, and started slipping closer and closer to the middle. Kyler stopped laughing, seeing the ice start cracking in hair thin crevices, \"Justy, Justy, stop!\" \"I can't Kylie!\" Justin shouted, fear crossing her face. Kyler watched helplessly as the ice cracked more beneath her friend, \"Justy! Someone, Help! Help! Help!\" Justin trembled, not sure what to do, until she looked up, seeing a teenager rush out of the woods, and onto the ice. \"No, you'll make it crack even more!\" Kyler shouted in warning, but the teenager didn't seem to hear her, he just waited until the ice started cracking beneath him, and then he froze, five feet from Justin. Justin looked up in fear, and the teenage boy looked back at her. He had blonde hair in a tight crew cut, black pants, and a dark grey hoodie. He glared down at her, \"Why the hell did you run out here!?\" She just shook with fear, \"I… I'm scared.\" The boy shook his head, \"I can't believe I have to do this.\" He finally seemed to acknowledge her, \"Alright, don't be scared, okay? Have you ever played hop scotch?\" She nodded, \"Yeah.\" He nodded, \"Alright, just do what I do.\" He stepped forward, the ice cracking and creaking. Justin stepped forward too, and the boy reached out, grabbing the front of her jacket, \"Alright, get ready to hop, okay?\" She nodded, \"Okay!\" The boy paused, \"Jump!\" Justin jumped into the air, and the boy used the front of her jacket, tossing her off the pond and onto the snow. The Ice underneath him cracked, and he fell into his waist, \"GOOD GOD THAT'S COLD!\" Justin and Kyler stared at him as he rushed out of the water, barely looking at them as he rushed past, \"Go home you stupid kids!\" Justin and Kyler didn't have to be told twice, but needless to say, they were in big trouble for not telling anyone where they went, and for even trying to go out onto the ice in the first place. LATER THAT NIGHT: Jay stepped outside of his room, sneaking down the hallways, out through the back door, and into the woods. He stopped, when he saw a tall teenager boy leaning against a tree, sniffing white powder from the palm of his hand. Jay stiffened, \"I knew it was you, the minute Jusitn told us what happened.\" The boy looked up at Jay, smirked, quickly snorted the rest of the powder up his nose, and said, \"Nice to see you too little brother. I hear you've got a name now. What, is Four not good enough anymore?\" Jay glared at him, \"Look One, I didn't come here to argue with you. What are you doing here?\" \"Just keeping an eye on our little plan b.\" One explained, \"If you don't turn out to be a good enough Jason Todd, then that little rug rat you're running around with is next on the block.\" Jay shook his head, \"Tell father that won't happen. I'm improving already, and I'll reach the level they want by the time I'm eighteen.\" One just laughed, his eyes starting to turn red and puffy from the crack. \"Try taking two years off of that number Jay. You've got to be able to beat Jason Todd in three years. And stop fooling around with that hot piece of ass from Halloween. Focus on your mission, then afterwards, have your fun.\" Jay grit his teeth, \"Don't call her that.\" One jerked his head to look at Jay, \"What did you just say to me, punk ass?\" Jay swallowed his pride, \"Forget it, alright? I'll focus on my training, tell father he doesn't need to worry.\" One nodded, \"Damn straight. If he was worrying, then you'd be dead little brother.\" THE NEXT DAY: Justin scribbling madly into the little notebook, \"And then the dumb blonde boy ran away, because we don't know his name, we're going to call him Jack Frost.\" Kyler looked up as Justin shut the book, \"Do you really think that guy was Jack Frost?\" \"He saved me from falling in a frozen pond, just like his little sister, in that new movie!\" Justin explained, \"And he had on a hoodie, just like Jack Frost.\" \"He had shoes on Justy.\" Kyler frowned, \"And he didn't have white hair, he was a blonde. And his hoodie wasn't blue. And he didn't have an ice staff.\" \"Shut up you stupid Jew, I don't see you coming up with any ideas!\" Justin snapped. Kyler crossed her arms, pouting, \"I have a feeling I'm gonna be second wing to you for the rest of my life.\" \"Damn straight!\" Justin said gleefully. Kim froze, having heard that part of the conversation ,walking past Justin's room down the hall. She sighed, shaking her head, \"Jason Peter Todd!\" Jason froze stiff, bending over his desk, fiddling with a gun, \"Uh oh.\"[Chapter 23] Justin curled up in front of her Christmas tree, her Nightwing footie pajamas on, and her Batman blanket tucked around her shoulders. Kim watched her daughter from the doorway, smiling, \"You gonna go to bed anytime soon?\" Justin shook her head, \"Uh uh, I'm waiting for Santa!\" Kim just shook her head, \"You can't stay up for long Justin, I know your tired. Even Jay is sleeping like a rock.\" Justin yawned, \"Well, I'm gonna try mommy.\" Kim nodded, \"Alright, good luck.\" The minute Kim left he living room, Justin pulled a walkie talkie out of her pile of blankets, \"Kyler?\" There was a short crackle on the other end of the line, and then Kyler's voice came out of the radio, \"Yeah, I'm here Justin.\" Justin nodded, \"Alright, do you have the secret weapon?\" There was a short pause, then Kyler answered, \"Yeah, I've got it… do I really have to do this? If my daddy catches me, he's gonna be mad Justin.\" Justin snorted, \"So? If my mommy find out, she's gonna break my legs!\" Kyler paused, then sighed, \"Alright you win, are you ready for it?\" Justin stood up, \"Are you across the street yet?\" \"Yeah, and it's cold out here Justin!\" Kyler snapped. Justin walked over to her front door, opening it quietly, and letting in Kyler. She was wearing a green and red plaid nightgown, with her father's slipper on her feet. She shivered, rushing into the house, rubbing her arms to keep them warm. Justin rolled her eyes, \"Where it is?\" Kyler sighed, handing Justin the black and blue soda can, \"Here ya go, my daddy drinks this to wake himself up in the mornings.\" Justin took it, \"Alright, now get outta my house, Jew.\" Kyler dashed back out into the cold, trying to get to her house before her toes froze off. Justin settled down in front of the tree again, drowning the monster drink quickly. Before she knew it, she was twitching, and quickly grabbed the walkie talkie, \"Kyler-I-feel-like-running-to-China!\" Kyler paused on the other end, \"How much of that monster drink did you have?\" \"All-of-it!\" \"I told you, only one sip every seven minutes!\" \"Oh-like-you-know-everything-about-caffeine!\" \"You know I'm a math prodigy!\" \"Shut-up-you-stupid-Jew!\" \"You shut up, Todd!\" Before Justin could respond, she heard something rumble in the chimney. She threw her walkie talkie away, and dove under one of her blankets. She bit down on her tongue, trying not to giggle with excitement. Someone fell down the chimney, landing on the floor in front of her, swearing in a language she didn't understand. She peeked out of the blankets, seeing the boy from the lake. His clothes and hair were covered in soot, and as he stood up, Justin could see ice all over his legs. He was shivering, holding his sides and shaking. Justin could see that he had lost the boots he had on yesterday, his toes an unhealthy color of blue. Justin popped up from her blankets, \"Are you okay?\" The boy stared at her, \"What… why aren't you asleep!? Isn't it Christmas or something?\" Justin grinned, \"I'm waiting for Santa!\" The boy groaned, \"Oh brilliant.\" \"Are you cold?\" Justin asked. She jumped up out of her blankets, grabbing his arm and tugging him down into her big nest. She pulled up her red fluffy one. \"Here ya go, this one's the warmest!\" He started to protest, but once that blanket hit his feet, he grabbed it, wrapping it all around himself. Justin stared at him a minute, \"What's that white stuff on your nose?\" The boy shrugged, brushing away the leftover crack, \"Medicine.\" \"Yuck.\" Justin growled, \"Medicine is nasty!\" Her walkie talkie sprang to life, Kyler's voice clear. \"Justin, do you see Santa yet?\" Justin picked up her walkie talkie, \"Nope, but Jack Frost is here!\" The boy raised an eyebrow at her, \"Jack who?\" Kyler gasped, \"I better pretend I'm sleeping then!\" Justin turned off her walkie talkie, before diving down into the other blankets, pretending to sleep herself. That lasted for about five seconds. She popped her head up again, \"Hey Jack, what does Santa look like? How many tattoos does he have? Where did he get his swords from? Can he give me and elf for Christmas since they don't make the toys anyways? No, scratch that! Can he give me one of his yeti's? Can he teach me how to sword fight? Can he teach me to speak Russian?\" The boy stared at her, \"Where the hell was this version of Santa when I was growing up? My dad would have encouraged that one! But no, I got an old fat man with a bowl full of jelly that my dad forbid from the house.\" Justin just stared at him, \"That didn't answer any of my questions. Hey, can you take me flying?\" He rolled his eyes, \"I'll throw you off of a roof and toss you a grappling line, that's about it.\" Justin shook her head, \"Never mind, it's to cold out to fly anyways.\" The boy shook his head as Justin finally settled down, \"You are one weird kid.\" Justin didn't even respond, she was out like a light. One reached over and picked up the empty monster can, \"Don't you know drinking this takes you from sixty to one eighty, then plummets you to zero?\" She let out a small gurgle in her sleep. \"Ya know, I could kill you, right now. You body guard isn't around, your parents are sleeping, and since you're passed out, you wouldn't make any noise at all.\" No response. The boy shrugged, \"Huh, funny. My sister isn't anything like you.\" Without even waiting for a reply, One stood up, tucking the red blanket under his arm, and walked over to the chimney, planning to craw up it again. He paused by the plate of milk and cookies left out for Santa, before chugging down the milk and tucking the cookies into his hoodie. He gave one last look at Justin, before shaking his head, \"Damn kid, you better grow up faster then that. You've the League of Assassins, and Batman after you.\" He disappeared up the chimney, not being able to help mumbling a quick, \"Who the hell is Jack Frost?\"[Chapter 24] Justin and Kyler were playing in Blake's front lawn, enjoying the few spring flowers that had managed to pop up around the yard. Jay and Blake were down in Blake's room, a.k.a. the basement, doing whatever it is guys do. Which means watching porn. Jay stared at Blake's TV screen, \"How is that… I mean, is that really possible? That's got to be photo shopped, right?\" Blake shrugged, drinking a soda. \"I don't know, but I definitely wanna try it out.\" Jay hesitated, \"Blake, let me get this straight, we're both thirteen, watching porn, and thinking about trying out the moves?\" \"If you don't like it, go play basket ball, but I here there's a three way coming on.\" \"… Maybe a little longer.\" \"Ha, that's what she said.\" Kyler was arguing with Justin over what to do, \"I don't wanna go down to the pond Justin! If my parents find out I went down there without Jay or Blake again, I'm gonna get grounded!\" \"Oh cry me a river you dumb Jew!\" Justin snapped, \"Why don't you put the Menorah down and just grow a pair!\" Kyler glared at Justin. \"Shut up you soulless ginger!\" \"I'm not a ginger!\" \"Hey kid.\" Justin and Kyler both looked up to see a white van parked on the curb. The man in the driver's seat was grinning at them. Justin spoke first. \"What is it mister?\" \"Do you want a bike?\" He asked. Justin's eyes lit up, \"Yeah!\" She rushed over to the window, peering in at the man, \"You've got a bike!? Where is it?\" \"It's in the back-\" Justin dropped down, throwing the side van door open, \"What the- where's the bike!?\" \"Uh… I forgot, I left it in my basement-\" \"Well why didn't you say so!?\" Justin asked, slamming the side door shut, opening the passenger door and jumping in, buckling up, \"Come on, drive! Let's go!\" She shut the door, \"Let's do this thing! Whoo hoo! I'm gonna get a bike !\" The guy stared at her, juggling his morals about doing this to what must surely be a retarded child, before shrugging. A kid was a kid. He drove off, with Justin in shot gun, and Kyler on the front lawn. Kyler stared after the van, mouth hanging open. She suddenly turned around, running up to Blake's door. \"JAY!\" One watched form a nearby tree, face palming. \"I don't think parents are to be blamed for their kids getting abducted…\" One had two options, he could either rush after the van, save Justin, be the hero of the day, and walk away knowing he's done a good dead. Or, he could just sit back, watch, and enjoy seeing his little brother try and fail to save Justin, then jump in to help and rub it all in Jay's face. Or maybe he could just watch, not interfere, and watch his little brother, the red haired brat, and the goth boy Blake all get killed. Maybe the brown haired brat too. One chuckled to himself, that choice was a no-brainer. Okay guys! Yeah, I know, it's ridiculously short, but I just felt it should end there. And another thing, do you wanna read Jay's origin story, based on his main version, revenge of the desperate? Then check it, on Red-X 17's profile! His link should be on the review pages of this story, he's got the poster for Assassin's Creed III as his profile picture. So if you're a fan of Jay, and want to know his life story, then go check it out![Chapter 25] Jay and Blake stared at Kyler as she finished her story. Jay's jaw dropped open, wondering why the hell Jason never taught Justin about stranger dangers. Well, actually Jay could probably guess there were three reasons for that. Number one, no crime had ever happened in their neighborhood. Number two, he was around Justin nearly 24/7, and any punk who tried to hurt Justin would get their ass handed to them by a thirteen year old ninja with ten years of training under his belt. Number three, if Jason ever found out someone hurt or kidnapped his daughter, hell if anyone ever bumped into her on the street, he would torture them for hours on end, and just let them bleed out right then and there. Probably do the same to whoever was to blame for Justin getting kidnapped… oh no. Jay looked up at Blake, \"Dude, I've got to get her back before Jason finds out, or he is going to kill me. Literally kill me!\" Blake nodded, \"No problem bro, I've got the goods!\" Blake walked over to his bed, lifting up the mattress, \"Take a look.\" Jay looked, seeing a variety of weapons hidden in the box spring. There were two hand pistols, and one cutting edge sniper rifle. There were three grenades, eight different knives (some were styles Jay hadn't even seen), nun-chucks, a Japanese katana, seven throwing stars, a retractable bo staff, several bundles of rope, a cross-bow and several arrows, three first aid kits, and even, two batarangs. \"Where did you get this stuff!?\" Jay asked, not being able to handle the fact his best friend slept on a damn arsenal . \"Well, I got the guns from my uncle, he's a sniper for the Army, and he got really drunk about three Christmases ago, and just gave them to me. I got most of the knives form this dealer five blocks from school, I kind of made the grenades myself, and the rest I got of the internet.\" \"… how did you even afford all this-\" \"I'll tell you later, now do you want to save your sister, or not?\" Blake asked, \"The police are absolutely useless, so where do we start looking?\" Kyler piped up, \"I remember the numbers on the van!\" Blake sat down at his desk, \"Tell them to me, I'll hack into the traffic cameras and see if I can tell where he's going.\" Jay couldn't get any more shocked, \"You can do that?\" \"A ten year old with a cell phone could do that.\" Blake waved off. Kyler told him the license plate number, and he quickly went to work, \"Hey Jay, this is gonna take awhile, take carrot top home, bribe her into keeping quiet, then come back ,I should have something for you then.\" Jay lead Kyler down the sidewalk, making her swear up and down not to tell anyone, ever. And topped it off with a Twix bar. Jay went back to Blake's, and he had punched an address into his GPS, \"I've got his house, let's get this son of a bitch.\" Blake took the sniper rifle, shoving it into his duffle bag, and Jay took the hand guns, shoving them into his back pack. Blake took the katana. Jay took the retractable bo staff. Blake took the batarangs. Jay took the ninja stars. \"You think we've got enough?\" Blake asked. Jay nodded, \"Yeah, anymore and we'll be suspicious, with these huge bulging bags.\" \"That's what-\" \"If you say that's what she said again, I'm gonna hit you.\" \"Rodger that.\" Both boys jumped on their bikes, riding on the sidewalks through town, past all the traffic, and into a more crime infested part of Star City. A kind of block where if someone screams \"Rape!\" Everyone just kind of walks away. Blake pulled up next to an abandoned garage, parking his bike out, \"Alright man, I'm pretty sure this is the place.\" \"Pretty sure?\" Jay asked. \"The traffic cameras stopped about eight miles back.\" Blake said, wiping sweat from his brow, \"But the van was registered to this address. So yeah, I'm pretty sure.\" WITH JUSTIN: The minute the man had taken me into his house, I could just tell, something was wrong. He smiled in a weird way. He touched me in a weird way. He talked to me in a weird way. His smile was to big, and his eyes were never looking at my face when he talked, he just kept staring at my pants. When he touched my shoulder to guide me into a different room, his thumb would stroke it, rubbing tiny circles into my muscles. \"Do you like the color pink?\" he asked, holding up a small little pink circle inside a see through plastic package. \"No.\" \"…Do you like the color red?\" He asked, smiling creepily again, holding up a red circle instead. I nodded, \"Yeah, I like red. My daddy really likes red too. He says that he really likes the color red because it's the color of blood.\" He stared at me for a minute, and then grinned. \"Can you play a game with me then?\" \"… What game?\" \"It's called the quiet game-\" \"No way!\" I snapped, \"My mommy tricked me with that game once, and I'm not doing it again! She said it was a game, but it wasn't! She just wanted me to stop singing in the car!\" I started to walk past him, \"Yer a stinker face mister! And I'm not falling for it!\" He suddenly grabbed my shoulder, yanking me up and sitting me down on his table, \"Kid, I've tried to be nice about this, but if you're not going to behave, you're going to be punished .\" \"… no.\" \"What?\" \"No, you can't punish me, because yer not my daddy!\" He grinned again, \"You can call me daddy, if you want to.\" \"Yer not my daddy! My daddy is taller than you, and he lifts a lot of weights! He's got guns in his closet, but I'm not allowed to touch them.\" For a moment, the man looked scared, but then he just brushed it off, \"No big deal, not like he'd ever find me.\" \"I did.\" We both looked up to see Jay in the doorway, holding a gun, but it didn't look like Daddy's gun. The man looked really scared, and he stepped away from me, \"Who, who are you?\" \"That's my little sister.\" Blake walked in the other door, pointing a bigger gun at the man, \"Yeah, and my protégé in the dark arts.\" I nodded, crossing my arms at the man as I stood up on the table, trying to look mad, \"Yeah, and you're a conformist!\" \"You, you boys have it all wrong, I just found her wandering around the city, and she said she was lost-\" \"You're holding a condom.\" Blake said. \"She found my stash under my couch cushion, I was just trying to tell her not to-\" \"Save it!\" Jay yelled, \"Blake, take Justin out of here.\" Blake frowned, \"But I wanna shove a knife up his ass.\" \"Blake!\" Jay snapped. Blake groaned, \"Fine, come on little fire cracker.\" I jumped down from the table, walking out of the building with Blake. I heard a scream from inside, and tuned to look, \"What's going on?\" Blake pulled me onto the sidewalk, taking out his MP3 player, \"Here, listen to some of my songs, okay?\" By the time Jay had come out, I had already listened to all of Blake's Nickleback songs. Jay put all of his stuff from his backpack into Blake's duffle bag, and then strapped his backpack to his handle bars. He put me inside the back pack, but left it unzipped so I could stick my head out, \"Are you comfortable Justin?\" \"No.\" \"Good, after riding all the way across Star City to find you, nighter are we.\" Blake laughed. It was a long ride back home, when we got back we had already missed dinner, but I wasn't that hungry because Blake gave me a candy bar. When we got back to our neighborhood, Blake left to go to his house, and Jay and me walked home. The minute Jay opened the door, Daddy ran into the living room, \"WHERE WERE YOU!?\" Jay flinched, \"Justin is fine-\" Daddy scooped me up, yanking me away from Jay, \"I can see that, wait for me in the garage!\" Jay ran out to the garage, and Daddy slammed the door closed, and then just stood there, holding me. He just held me for a long time, and then I felt his shoulders shaking. \"Daddy?\" I pulled myself away from his shoulder, and looked at his face, but he turned away, sniffing, and then put his sleeve up to his eyes, \"I'm just, I'm just really tired Justin, okay? Are you tired?\" I nodded, \"Yeah, Jay and Blake drove me all around town today, it was fun! Except for the weird man in the white van, but Jay made him leave me alone.\" Daddy was quiet for a minute, \"Justin, what did this man do to you before Jay made him stop?\" \"He showed me this weird thing, Blake called it a condom.\" Daddy's grip tightened on me, \"KIM!\" Mommy stepped into the room, \"What?\" \"Honey, can you put Justin to bed, I wanna talk to Jay.\" Mommy put me into bed, singing a lullaby to me. \"There's a place not far, where the wild things are. You might not believe me but it's true. There's a place, so near. Close your eyes and let it appear. There's a whole world, waiting for you. There's so much more wonderful than we can see. Close your eyes and believe. Close your eyes it's not hard, to go where the wild things are. To go where the wonderful wild things are.\" WITH JASON: I walked out into the garage, seeing Jay standing there. \"Jay.\" Jay looked up at me, fear evident in his eyes. \"Yes sensei?\" \"Justin told me what happened. Where's the sick bastard that tried to… tried to rape my daughter?\" Jay paused, \"You're not… mad at me?\" \"Where is he!?\" I snapped, grabbing the front of Jay's shirt and shaking him slightly. \"Dead.\" Jay answered, \"I killed him.\" I felt my entire body deflate, every ounce of anger falling out of me, just vanishing like smoke into the air. Before I could even register what I was doing, I wrapped my arms around Jay, hugging him tightly. \"Thank you. Thank you so much Jay.\"[Chapter 26] Ever since the pedo incident, Jason hadn't let Justin out of his sight. He was the one who woke Justin up in the mornings, and fixed her breakfast. He was the one who changed her from her Night-Wing footie pajamas into her batman overalls. He was the last one to say goodbye to her before him and Kim had to go off to work, and leave Jay to take care of her, and he was the first one to speed home and get a kiss from his baby girl, before dinner time. Jay had his GED, so instead of going to school, he would stay home with Justin all day, watching movies, playing outside, and playing Batman and Robin. Things had gotten a lot better between Jay and Jason. Jason had stopped looking at Jay like he was a ticking time bomb; he began bragging about how great a kid he was to the other dads in the neighborhood. \"Never have to remind him to do any of his chores.\" Kim had overheard him saying to Russell at their weekly card game. \"Everyday, I come home, he's already cleaned his room, Justin's room, the yard has been raked, the garden weeded, and the front and back porch swept.\" David had thrown down a pair of eights, \"Wish Matthew was like that. Every day seems either me or my wife have to negotiate with him to do his chores. Almost like he doesn't even want his allowance.\" Jason raised an eyebrow, \"You give him an allowance?\" David looked up at Jason with confusion. \"Yeah… you don't give Jay one?\" Jason cast a look around the table, noticing the silent disbelief and judgment of the other men. \"Well, I… uh… I never got an allowance for stuff like that. To my mom, putting a roof over my head and food on the table was payment enough.\" Kim had paused in the doorframe, concern creeping in as she realized the situation. Jay did a lot around the house… he never got any type of compensation for it. Sure, he got a roof over his head, food on his plate, and Kimberly was one of many mothers guilty of spoiling her children with baked goods and pizza nights, but Justin got all of those things too, and she didn't have any chores besides keeping her toys put up. Russell shrugged, putting his beer down along with three tens. \"When I was a kid, all I did was mow the lawn once a week and keep my room clean, I got five bucks a week.\" \"We're not trying to tell you how to raise your kid or anything, Jason.\" The man who spoke was named Arnold, a newcomer at poker night. He wasn't a resident of the neighborhood, but a friend of Russell's who was visiting for the week. \"And if he'll do all that work, just from appreciating the work you and Kim do, good for you. You raised a good kid.\" Arnold raised his beer to his lips, taking a small sip, before glancing sideways at Russell. \"It's just…\" Jason frowned, \"What?\" \"It's not a big deal or anything, but… I mean… why do you let him hang around Blake?\" Judging from the glances he was getting, Jason figured they all wanted to know. \"Why not?\" David cleared his throat, \"I told Matthew not to hang around that kid. One look at him, you can tell he's a bad influence.\" \"In what way?\" Jason asked. Russell snorted. \"Way he dresses, you can just tell he's looking for trouble. Probably sacrificing cats in that basement.\" Arnold shook his head, \"I've met his parents, they both seem normal enough. Can't see why they let him dress like that.\" Jason did not like where this was going. He didn't pry into Blake's life, but he knew enough about the kid to know that he was a good kid. He dressed differently, and his taste in music was too vulgar for his age. Jason had been guilty of similar things at his age. And worse things. Kim felt her hands slowly curling into fists. Blake had wormed his way into a special place in her heart. She didn't quite consider him her child, not like she considered Jay or Justin, but he was damn near close. He was Jay's only close friend, and was like a second brother to Justin. Hearing Jason's friends talk about him like that nearly made her blood boil. But screaming at people was frowned upon, so instead of walking into the garage, she went to her and Jason's room to prevent such action. When Jason came to bed, he found Kim sitting on the edge of the bed, wearing nothing other than one of his T-shirts. His eyes widened as Kim smirked, slowly drawing the T-shirt up her thighs. \"I love a man whos good with kids.\" Jason raised an eyebrow, \"This is about… Jay?\" Kim shrugged, \"Or just repressed sexual tension from not decking Arnold.\" \"Oh… so it's about Blake?\" \"Get. In. Bed.\" Jason was about to tackle his wife onto the mattress, but was interrupted by a little voice screaming from down the hall, \"MOMMY DADDY MOMMY DADDY!\" They both dashed down the hall to see Justin estanding up her tiny bed, a pillow cut and stuffed to look like a batarang clutched in her tiny hands. Her eyes widened when she saw her parents, and she pointed at her open closet door, \"Monster!\" Kim flicked on the lights while Jason scooped Justine, \"Sweetie, there's no monsters.\" Kim opened the closet doors wider, showing her daughter, \"See? Just your clothes and toys.\" Justine trembled, clutching onto Jason tightly. \"He's hiding.\" \"Hiding?\" Jason asked, \"From who?\" \"You. He's scared cause you're big.\" Justine explained. \"I'm little, so he comes out at night to try and eat me!\" Jay poked his head into the room, \"Eat you? There are cannibals in America?\" Kim shushed him, \"No, she thinks there's a monster in her closet. It's a phase most kids go through.\" \"But there is one!\" Justine protested. Jason sighed, \"Justy, monsters aren't real.\" \"But I saw one!\" Justine insisted. \"He lives in my closet!\" Jay squinted over at Justine's open closet door. \"Kinda small in there. Must not be a very big monster.\" \"Big enough to eat me.\" Justine snapped. THE NEXT AFTERNOON: \"Alright, emergency cell phone is on top of the fridge, the contact numbers are mine, Jason, Tim, Dick, poison control, and 911.\" Kim summed up. \"We'll be back by morning, maybe tonight if things don't go so well. Justin's bed time is eight, your bedtime is ten. You can have Blake over if you want, but if he spends the night you can only stay up until midnight. Kyler can come over to play this afternoon if she wants, but no spending the night for her. I don't think you can handle looking after two little girls by yourself.\" Jay nodded, \"Thank you for that mercy.\" Kim pointed towards the kitchen as Jason straightened his tie. \"There's fish sticks and cheesy potatoes in the fridge. Absolutely. No. Pizza.\" \"And don't touch my pork chops.\" Jason said firmly. Kim picked up her purse, fishing out a twenty dollar bill. \"Here's for watching her.\" Jay grinned, thinking about how many arcade games he could play with that. \"Thanks mom.\" She kissed him on the forehead, \"You've got this, big guy. Don't burn the house down.\" Justy waddled into the living room, tugging her red wagon behind her. \"Will you be back before bedtime?\" Kim shook her head, carefully kneeling down to avoiding twisting her ankle in her heels. She gave Justine a kiss on the forehead, \"No munchkin, it'll just be you and Jay.\" Justine crossed her arms, \"But if you're both gone whose gonna scare away the monster if it comes tonight?\" \"There is no monster, sweetie.\" Kim assured her, \"It's just your imagination.\" \"Where are you going!?\" Justine asked, grabbing onto the bottom of her dress as she stood up, \"Don't go to far! We might need you to come home quickly! Monsters don't wait!\" Kim sighed, tugging her dress out of Justin's hands. \"Then call Batman.\" Justine stomped her foot, \"Fine! I guess Batman is my mommy tonight!\" Jason snorted, \"Ya know, I almost wish Bruce had been here to hear that.\" Kim elbowed him harshly, \"Okay, everything is in order, any questions?\" Justine raised her hand. \"Yes munchkin?\" \"Brushing my teeth, is it optional when you're not here?\" \"Absolutely not. It's mandatory.\" She pouted. Jay groaned, \"Like, not even a little bit optional?\" Jason gave him a look, \"Do you want your girlfriend to be grossed out next time you kiss?\" \"No…\" \"Then it's not optional.\" Kim and Jason left, heading out to their date. They had been planning a simple movie/dinner date for two months. Not only were they going to the movies and dinner, but they had booked a hotel room for the night. It was really the only way two married people could get any decent action. Otherwise they would get interrupted. Jay turned to Justin as the door shut, grinning. \"Guess what we're doing tonight!\" \"Blanket fort castle?\" She asked. \"Blanket fort castle!\" Jay yelled. \"This is not a drill! Get ALL the blankets!\" Justine squealed in excitement, \"Even the ones from Mommy and Daddy's room!?\" \"Of course!\" Jay shouted back, \"They're the biggest ones!\" Justine giggled, running off to their room. Jay moved to follow, but heard a knocking sound at the door. He opened it, and there stood Blake. As opposed to the normal black eyeliner, flat hair, black sweater, black slacks, and black converse, Blake looked a lot more… dolled up. He had spiked his hair, a streak of pink going through his bangs. His normal black eyeliner had a wing tip, and there was definitely some red eyeshadow there. Black lipstick too. He had a red pole with a black leather (probably fake leather) vest and grey tie. Black slacks were normal. But he had on black combat boots instead of sneakers. Blake gestured to the duffle bag hanging from his shoulder, \"Where do I out my instruments of torture?\" \"Dinner is fish sticks and cheesy potatoes. If you can dig that, right over there, next to the couch, not on it.\" Blake grinned, \"Hell yeah! I haven't had fish sticks since I was five!\" Justine ran back into the room, dragging her parent's blue and white blankets and sheets with her. \"Blake, you look pretty!\" Blake smirked, setting his bag down and scooping Justine up, \"And you, my little spawn, are as adorable as ever.\" She crossed her arms, \"Tonight, I am king of the blanket fort!\" \"Ya mean princess? Queen?\" She glared at him. \"You be the princess.\" I'm back bitches. ","Summary":" It had been about three weeks since I had told Dick and my parents. Since then, Alfred and Bruce ha"},{"Movie":"Batman: Under the Red Hood","Title":"Red Dawn and Nightfall","Author":"TheWallflower14","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8956587","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I wasn't sure how much more if this 'sitting still' I could take. Eddie and two other boys I didn't know were huddled behind a dumpster, waiting. Only Eddie seemed as fidgety as I felt, the other two looked overly confident. I suppressed a sigh as I realized what he was doing. Eddie Santos was my best friend, and he was always trying to help kids to live life on the streets (which is what he was doing right now). But most kids just didn't have what it took to survive, and that's what usually got them put back in an orphanage. Either that, or they got killed. But that didn't stop Eddie. If anything, it motivated him even more. He kept helping whoever came to him for advice, despite my grumbles of complaints, and kept teaching them \"our ways\", more specifically my ways, since I've been at this stuff since I was nine. Eddie and I met three years ago, when I was eleven and he was thirteen. He'd been my first real friend, and my first crush, but there was no way I'd ever tell him that . Even though that crush was long gone, he'd never let me hear the end of it. Eddie caught me staring down at him from my spot on the fire escape and gave a little smirk. I rolled my eyes at him. He winked and gave a small tilt of his head, and I looked to the exit of the alleyway, where two thugs burst out from the double doors of Gotham's bank. That was my cue. I jumped off the railing and landed with a soft thud on the alley floor. I shoved my hands into the pocket of my hoodie and began a quick stride towards the two thieves, who were pretty much about to run right into the little trap. They glanced back at the cop who burst out from the bank and pursued them like a bird about to snatch its prey. I abruptly froze in my spot. Well hell . Pulling the red hoodie lower over my face, I bit my lip and prayed to the lucky stars I didn't have that he wouldn't recognize me, or Eddie. The thugs turned back around and sprinted faster, scowling in irritation when they saw me. \"Move out of the way, brat!\" Still petrified, I cast one quick glance at the cop; there was no way I could blow my cover. Forcing my stiff muscles to relax, I let them shove me onto the ground as they stumbled their way into the alley. I slowly got to my feet, brushing dirt off the knees of my jeans. I hardly breathed as I listened with an ear directed toward the alleyway, and heard a thud and a grunt, immediately followed by some shouting. I knew it wasn't Eddie; Eddie was smart enough to know when to bolt. I remember during our first few weeks as a duo, it had taken Eddie a good while to be able to ditch me. He never wanted me to take the full blame of something we'd both done, but I'd pretty much bullied him into ditching me no matter what the situation, so that in case it was anything serious, he'd be able to get help. Fortunately, this wasn't anything serious at all. What had me freaking out was the guilt I knew I would carry for the rest of the night, which I'll explain later. The cop jogged up to me with a concerned look on his face. \"Are you all right?\" I waved my hand dismissively and turned my head away, \"Mhm!\" I turned to walk away, but he put a hand on my shoulder and held me back. \"Wait here, I'll be right back.\" He turned and ran into the alleyway, and I silently cursed myself. If it were any other cop, I would've disobeyed the order and ran down the block. But since it was him , I stayed rooted in place. I had no idea what the hell happened in the time span of thirty seconds that the cop was in that alley, but he came out with the two sacks of stolen greens, the two unconscious thugs, and the two dumbstruck newbie street rats. I was right: Eddie had made a run for it, but it looked like the new guys hadn't listened to him. And I'd made the mistake of listening to the cop. But hey, I knew him, and Eddie knew him. And we both knew following his orders was always the best way to go. \"Wow, you got them!\" I disguised my voice and pointed at him, \"Good to have someone like you working in the GCPD, sir.\" I turned around and restrained myself from sprinting away; this was a cop I knew I could not outrun. I speak from experience. \"Hold on there, Alex. Don't you need a ride back to St. Anne's? Or did they already kick you out?\" Trying not to cringe, I slowly turned around to face Dick, who looked at me with a raised eyebrow and an amused grin on his face. He knew me too well. But I guess that happens when you're friends with someone for six years. And Richard Grayson was definitely that someone. Grumbling some very unladylike things under my breath, I threw my hoodie back and shoved my hands into my pockets, walking slowly back to him in defeat. \"These friends of yours?\" He shook Things 1 and 2 by the collars of their shirts. I raised a brow, \"Since when am I a social butterfly?\" I knew he only took my retort as a confirmation. Dick chuckled anyway, \"Can't argue with that logic.\" He glanced behind him before looking back to me curiously, \"Eddie isn't here?\" I couldn't hold back my grin, \"You just missed him.\" Dick and Eddie were best friends, too, and that was because they met through me. The three of us were close, even though Dick was an adult and a cop , possibly a street kid's worse enemy. But Dick was the greatest guy we knew, which was why Eddie and I respected him and always followed his orders. Well, almost always. \"That's too bad. I still owe him that lesson on how to charm a woman.\" One of the many reasons why I was even friends with Dick was because of his light humor. He was probably the only cop in all of Gotham City that hasn't lost his upbeat attitude. Others, well, they can't handle the things they see. But Dick can. And, more impressively, he knew how to deal with me . \"Hey, do you mind lending me a hand with these?\" He tossed the two bags full of money to me, and I easily caught them. \"I've kinda got my hands full here.\" I would never be able to get over the fact that Dick actually trusted me, had complete faith in me. It was another reason why I liked him, but it also bothered me. I knew it was a way of getting me to trust him, to make me a goody two shoes, or something like that. The thing is, it actually worked . I was a street rat with a conscience, which annoyed the hell out of me sometimes. It made it so much harder to steal, to do wrong. I wasn't a bad person - never was, thanks to Dick - but when you lived on the streets, you either steal or starve. That was the motto. But thanks to Dick's useful pointers, I learned to never take more than what I needed. Not only did this reduce my guilt by a fraction, it also made it easier to not get caught, to slip away unnoticed. Which was why I didn't make a run for it while Dick had his back to me. That, and because I knew he would catch me in less than half a second. The guy was probably at the peak of his game. He could be a famous athlete in the Olympics, or in the military, or something else other than a simple cop in Gotham City. Not that I would want him to leave, because I really didn't, but I couldn't help but wonder why a guy like Dick would ever stay on this hellhole of an Island. All Gotham ever had to offer was misery and more misery. Anyone could tell you that. I was pulled out of my thoughts as Dick slammed the door of the patrol car shut, locking the four goons in the backseat. He turned to smile at me, and I immediately handed him the bags, not trusting myself a moment longer. \"Thanks, Alex.\" \"No problem.\" Grimacing, I shoved my hands into my pockets and swallowed the regret of not having had snagged a couple bills. Stupid conscience takes the fun out of everything. Dick disappeared back inside the bank, and I imagined everyone there clapping and cheering and swooning over the fabulous Officer Grayson. They were probably even gonna throw him a party or something. I turned back to Things One and Two and watched them shift uneasily under my glare. As easily as I could get them out, I just stood there and continued to stare at them. They deserved getting caught, anyway. No street rat should ever be so confident on the risky task of stealing, especially not on the first try. Besides, it was every man for himself out here. Or girl. Whatever. Two drops splattered on my face and I looked up at the sky, which was darker and cloudier than usual. Great. Rain. That meant I was going to have to find someplace else to crash. But honestly, any place on the street was better than an Orphanage, even if they did provide warm meals and a bed. I hated being told what to do all the time everyday, every hour, by everyone. It was hell, trust me. In a matter of minutes my hair was plastered to the sides of my face. I saw the newbies snicker, and I narrowed my eyes into slits menacingly as I pulled my hood over my head. At that moment, Dick rushed out the double doors and jogged over to where I stood waiting to get inside the car. \"Where's the giant trophy?\" \"I didn't think you'd still be waiting here.\" \"Sorry to disappoint you.\" Dick smiled and unlocked the doors, \"Get in.\" I hopped into the passenger's seat and slammed the door, shivering from the cold. Dick got into the driver's seat and revved the engine. I pretended to look around the car, \"What, no handcuffs?\" I waved my hands in the air. \"You didn't do anything illegal. Not tonight.\" He added wryly, answering my question as he flipped on the headlights. \"Not tonight.\" I confirmed, unable to stop the huge grin from stretching across my face. The rest of the drive was peacefully silent, and I was grateful for that. I was already feeling guilty for what I did - or at least had tried to do - and I liked wallowing. Dick was the only authority figure in the entire city that had that effect on me; I really hated seeing that disappointed look in his eyes whenever I did something wrong. But that was just because, in a weird way, Dick kind of felt like my older brother, or my guardian. I remembered at some point in my childhood - when I was already on the streets - I'd accidentally called him \"Dad\" instead of \"Dick\". I'd been so embarrassed at the slip-up, but he pretended to not have noticed and bought me a chocolate ice cream cone before taking me back to St. Elizabeth's Orphanage, which was where I'd been put in at the time. And, although I'd never admit it to him, I sometimes, sometimes, wished Dick actually was my actual dad. I never knew my biological father, didn't even know his name, but I liked to imagine he would've been kind of like Dick. Except he'd totally ditched me and my mom...so fat chance. We pulled up in front of the police station, and I cast a quick glance at Dick. \"Would you prefer to wait in here?\" He asked, his tone mockingly polite. I mimicked his tone, \"Would you mind leaving the keys in?\" He laughed at my poor imitation of him, \"I won't take long.\" Dick pulled all four guys out from the back and led them toward the entrance. The locks on all four doors clicked, and my grin widened. I waited until the coast was clear, and then pulled the copy of Dick's key out of my pocket. Being friends with a cop definitely had its perks. Dick didn't know about the duplicate key, though. A few weeks ago, when I'd been taken into the police station for a good lecturing on morals, I'd fished it out of his coat pocket and taken the liberty to make a copy of it. I jammed the key into the little slot and twisted it, revving the engine. I slammed my fist on the little button, and the doors unlocked. Pulling the key out, I jumped out the car and slammed the door shut behind me. I took off into a full on sprint, feeling the fresh rain and wind hit my face. Ah, freedom! After running down three blocks, I decided it was safe enough to stop and take a breather. Pulling some loose change from my jean pockets, I walked toward an open Liquor store and actually bought something instead of just slipping it in my sleeve. I was feeling kind of guilty for disappointing Dick for the umpteenth time. I wanted to do a good deed, just to cross out the bad. It was something I've always done. This little habit even rubbed off on Eddie. It was usually because Dick - whether he was aware of it or not - had the strong effect of making us feel guilty for letting him down. We knew he saw us as \"good kids\", and that just fed our guilty consciences even more. But stealing was just so much easier. Especially when the corner mirrors were stained with bubblegum, soda spray, and spitballs from yours truly. Trying not to pout, I paid the nice cashier for the vegetable flavored drink– yes, I needed the nutrition, it's not like broccoli just falls out of the sky – and walked out. I was just about to take a sip of the weird looking stuff when it was suddenly snatched out of my hands. Feeling my whole body tense up for a fight, I whipped around in an attempt to jam my elbow against the crook's profile, but he ducked under it in the nick of time. \"Cool it! It's me!\" Eddie stepped beneath the flickering street light, a greatly amused look on his face. \"I paid for that, you know.\" I reached out to snatch the bottle from his hand, but he held it up and away from my reach. How the hell was he so tall? We hardly ate any real food! He looked at me in surprise, \"You paid for this?\" His expression immediately turned understanding, \"Ah, so that's who the cop was! It was too dark for me to recognize him.\" Eddie quickly grinned, \"So what did Dick say? I'm still waiting for my next lesson on how to charm a lady.\" I laughed, feeling my mood lighten. \"Yeah, he mentioned that.\" I raised a brow at him, \"Who is it you're trying to charm, anyway?\" I rarely saw Eddie talk to girls. Unless she worked the cash register, that was usually when Eddie put his naturally good looks and Spanish to use. \"Don't worry, Alex, you know you'll always have a special place in mi corazón .\" He put a hand over his heart and smirked while he gave me his famous smoldering dark eyes. Famous smoldering eyes that were totally useless on me by now. But boy did it work miracles on anyone else. Eddie had the superpower of making girls drool, literally drool! We first discovered it when he was chatting it up with the teenage girl who was watching over the Laundromat, which her aunt owned. Eddie had been totally oblivious to her expression, but I saw it and pulled him aside to let him see the obvious. The girl actually got jealous when she saw me talking to Eddie, but he smoothed it out with her in a nanosecond, and that was how we got the little clothes we owned washed for free. Up to this day, I'm pretty sure the girl hates me. But that just makes our trips to the Laundromat that much more fun. When Dick realized how we got so many discounts and free stuff, he couldn't stop laughing. Afterwards, he told Eddie he'd teach him how to \"put those dreamy brown eyes to good use\". I grinned triumphantly, \"Nice try, hermano , but your mojo doesn't work on me.\" Eddie sighed in mock disappointment, \"I guess it only works on the pretty girls.\" He dodged away from my fist and burst into laughter. The joyous sound echoed all around the empty parking lot, and I couldn't help but join in. I lightly punched his arm, \"Fine, don't tell me. But a piece of advice?\" I reached up and tugged on his soft shaggy hair, \"You need a haircut.\" He narrowed his eyes suspiciously, \"That's just an excuse for you to aim a pair of scissors at my head, isn't it?\" I smiled widely at him. Eddie tossed me back my drink, \"Here you go, chica.\" I laughed as I caught it, and we both started walking. \"Eddie?\" \"Hmm?\" \"Sorry I couldn't catch the thugs. That money could've totally gotten you a nice haircut.\" He smiled and gently nudged me, \"Hey, don't worry about it. We were only going to snatch one roll of bills and split it between the four of us, so it probably wouldn't have lasted us for too long. Besides, it set a good example for the two new kids. They got caught for not listening to me, and now they're probably back in St. Michael's orphanage.\" Eddie shrugged, \"At least I tried to help them live the life.\" Just to clear things up, Eddie and I didn't always steal from the good guys, we steal from stealers, too. Kind of like vigilante work, which was why we'd gone after the two thugs from the bank earlier tonight. But that's what Batman was for, right? \"Besides,\" Eddie added, pulling me out of my thoughts, \"I like the haircuts you give me.\" I barked out a laugh, \"Yeah right! Remember the first haircut I ever gave you? That was so bad it wasn't even funny.\" \"Oh man,\" Eddie pretended to groan, \"Don't even remind me! Dick had to take me to an actual barbershop to fix it. He even paid!\" We both bumped into each other as we were crippled by laughter. The memory of a smaller Eddie with hair sticking out from all sides was too much to handle, and we had to sit down on the sidewalk for a quick break. Eddie leaned his shoulder against mine, and I did the same. We both sat there for a while, enjoying the moment of blissful silence before getting back up and searching for a place to crash.[Chapter 2] The last two weeks had passed surprisingly uneventful. Eddie didn't steal, and I didn't steal. Not from the good folks, and not from the assholes. The results: an easy conscience…and a stomach that had shrunk down to the size of a walnut. Scratch that – a raisin is a way more accurate metaphor. Which explained why that night I was drooling a puddle beside my head. I was having a pretty great dream. It was all gooey, chocolate chip cookies and fluffy plain waffles and those Eggo waffles that have chocolate chips in it. I've always loved waffles. Waffles are awesome. But then a hand clamped firmly over my mouth, and I jolted awake, sucking in air and preparing to scream because I'd just lost the best dream ever and someone was going to have to pay for that. \"Quiet!\" Eddie hissed, struggling to stop me from thrashing around. Quiet? He totally crashed my dream! I slapped his hand away and prepared to voice my witty retort, when I saw why he'd woken me up so suddenly. There was the sound of wood planks being yanked off and tossed away. Flashlights waved around, spilling their blinding light through the cracks. I looked back at Eddie, his intense dark eyes glinting behind his shaggy night hair. That was a look that said: Your snoring woke up all of Gotham City. And I gave him a look that said: I told you we shouldn't have stayed in the first abandoned building we found. But did you listen to me? No. He rolled his eyes at me and silently helped me to my feet. We both crept along the shadows, but the sound of wood finally breaking froze us on the spot, and the searchlights shone right on us. Eddie swore under his breath. \"Hey!\" I could immediately tell by the strict tone that it was a cop. \"What are you two doing here?\" \"That's the Santos kid!\" Eddie wasted no time jumping into action. His fingers curled in a death grip around my wrist and he started dragging me further into the building. They were after Eddie. Again . Dread crept up on me as I remembered the last time he'd gotten the cops' attention like this. But now was not the time for sweet reminiscing. We had a wall to crash through. Releasing myself from Eddie's grip, I twisted my torso so that my right shoulder would break through the wasting wood and take most of the impact. We broke through easily – adrenaline does amazing things – and stumbled into an alleyway, where we jumped over hobos' legs and smelly sleeping bags and earned some curses and cheers. We took a few more turns before ultimately coming to a dead end. I fell back against the wall and tilted my head back, gulping for air; my blood pressure was way too low, and I was starting to feel dizzy. Eddie scanned the length of the alley and turned back to me, wiping the sweat off his brow. \"We lost them.\" I smiled widely, trying not to show how weak I felt. \"Was there ever any doubt?\" We'd outrun almost every cop that's ever tried to tail us, the only exception being Dick. Hmm, had he been a part of that squad? Before I could be swallowed by my own guilt, I suddenly remembered why the GCPD had sent us running like chickens in the first place. I straightened up and walked over to Eddie, glaring up at him. \"Why were they looking for you ?\" He ran a hand through his hair, looking tired. \"Nothing. It was just something stupid.\" \"The hell it was stupid! The last time the cops went after you like that was when – are you selling drugs again?\" Eddie blinked in slight surprise, \"What?\" He scowled. \"No!\" He pointed at me angrily, \"You know I don't do gangs anymore, Alejandra! Not after what those assholes did to you.\" He shoved his hands into his pockets and glanced to the side sullenly. \"I learned my lesson.\" My hand reflexively shot up to grip my left bicep. I would have lost the arm if the surgeons hadn't gotten the two bullets out in time. I forced my hand back down to my side and ground my teeth together, \"Then what. Have. You. Done.\" \"It was all a misunderstanding, okay? Just forget this ever happened.\" My blood boiled. Did he not get how worried this made me? I was so frustrated and hungry and tired and angry that the next thing I knew, I was shoving him back, using both of my hands this time. \"I mean it, Eddie! You better tell me the truth or so help me I will – \" He stumbled backwards, but instead of falling onto the ground, he leaned back on the hood of a car that had been parked in the very dark part of the gap between the two buildings. Eddie quickly straightened up, and he looked at the sleek black hood in awe. My anger vanished in an instant, and I was just as dumbstruck as he was. \"What kind of car…\" Eddie frowned thoughtfully as we both tried to make out its shape in the dark. Eddie dug into the pocket of his jeans and pulled out a lighter; it was the one I'd gotten him a few years ago, just as a friendship token. The only decoration on the front was an Ace. And yes, I'd bought it. Okay, well, I'd kinda stolen a guy's wallet. But still. I was surprised he'd kept it all these years instead of just selling it to some random pot smoker. Eddie flicked it on and held the lighter close to the car, but it did little to help us see the whole thing. But we recognized enough. \"No way.\" Eddie said, his eyes lighting up in excitement and shock. I gawked. \"The fudging Batmobile .\" \" Batman's Batmoblie.\" \" The Batman.\" We both grinned at each other like a pair of idiots. He lightly elbowed me. \"Those are some pretty sweet tires.\" I raised a brow at him, catching the implication. Turning back to the sweet ride, I made my tone as nonchalant as possible. \"Yeah. They are.\" Eddie chuckled, and he went over to kneel down, patting the firm rubber. He let out a low whistle. \"These are the good brand.\" He looked at me somewhat pleadingly, \"Alejandra, do you have any idea how much cash we can get from these?\" I put my hands on my hips, refusing to succumb to his nearly irresistible puppy dog eyes. \"Do you have a ny idea what can and will happen to us when Batman finds out we took his tires?\" A wicked grin stretched across his handsome face. \"Who says he's gonna find out?\" \"Intuition. C'mon, Eddie, he's Batman for crying out loud! The guy is the world's greatest detective!\" I threw an arm out to gesture to the Batmobile, \"The tires probably have tracking devices, or maybe the car has a camera running and is recording everything we're saying! He'll probably guess your name out of the top of his head just by seeing his tires have been stolen!\" I instinctively took a few steps back, growing more paranoid the longer I stared at the car. This was so not a good idea. \"You watch way too many spy movies, chica. And we don't even own a television.\" I rolled my eyes at him. \"It's called the newspaper, Eddie. He's always on the front page.\" Eddie stood up and began walking around in the dark, kicking junk around as he searched for something. He let out a victorious laugh when he reappeared with a lug wrench. What the hell? \"Who leaves that thing lying around?\" I demanded to no one in particular. Eddie looked at me, a smile tugging at the corner of his lips. \"So, should we do it?\" My stomach let out a very loud and very embarrassing growl. \"I'll take that as a yes.\" I internally cursed my belly. \"Eddie, he could be close by. What if you get caught red handed?\" He was already working away at undoing the nut bolt. \"Relax, Alex. It's not like we haven't done this before. Besides, you were the one who taught me how to do this, remember?\" He flashed me another dazzling smile. Even though he was older than me by two years, I was the one who had taught Eddie the street smarts, since I've been an orphan on the streets longer than he has. And my nerves were screaming at me that this was not a smart idea at all . Stealing a random car's tires was perfectly fine. But this was an entirely different situation. I've never personally met Batman, but based on the stories I've heard…I'd like to keep it that way. Eddie set the first tire down, and I rushed over to him, snatching the lug wrench from his hand. \"Dude, one tire is enough. All I need are waffles and a double cheeseburger with French fries.\" \"You'll need a drink, too.\" He smirked as he held his hand out to me, \"Hand it over, Alex.\" I pretended to do the math on my fingers. \"Actually, we'll have more than enough for another two double cheeseburgers and a whopper. And there'll be enough to get you something, too, so…\" I tossed the wrench aside, but it did not hit the ground. \"Sorry to disappoint you two, but the Batmobile needs all four tires.\" Well hell . Thoughts anyone? I welcome them! :][Chapter 3] I put this off for too long, but here's the third chapter! :D to my special reviewers, i want to thank you for your lovely comments, they keep me going! Batman stared, and I stared right back. I had to admit, it was pretty funny. The situation reminded me of when Dick first caught me stealing tires – specifically the Mayor's tires – and brought me in to Police HQ. Except I wasn't the one Dick had stared at. He'd given the Mayor a pretty menacing glare for calling me a \"filthy street rat\". The look had sent some serious chills down my spine, and it hadn't even been directed at me. The Mayor's ghosted face, however, had been priceless . And, being the nine year old I was at the time, I couldn't help but bust into hysterical laughter when he mumbled his apology to me. I've seen my good share of police glares, and trust me when I say none compared to Dick's. Except for Batman's. But right now, I found myself handling Batman's stare pretty well. Meaning I wasn't cringing and spluttering and apologizing like a wimp. No way. That was not my thing. Besides, why he was interrogating me ? Eddie was the one who was gonna go through with the totally failed plan! But I wasn't about to point fingers like that. No matter how much he frustrated me sometimes, I always had Eddie's back. I leaned back on the chair, raising a brow at Batman, \"Well, if you didn't want anyone to eye your tires, then maybe you shouldn't have parked your billion dollar car with its billion dollar wheels in a place like Crime Alley .\" I shrugged, \"That's just my opinion, though.\" \"I guess you're right.\" The way he said it let me know he didn't really mean it. I rolled my eyes and sat up, \"Hey, we didn't take your tires. And yes, that might've been because you interrupted, but you did drive us here in your Batmobile, so…no harm done!\" Despite the fact that Eddie and I knew we were in neck deep, the ride inside Batman's car had been beyond insanely cool. Batman looked at me without saying anything, and I raised my brows, \"So...what now?\" After another brief moment, he began to talk. \"You've stolen civilians' tires before. Forty-two times, to be exact.\" Okay, whoa. No police could know that, because I've gotten caught stealing tires only four times. \"Uhh – \" \"On top of all that, you've stolen from countless convenient stores within the radius of Crime Alley, Old Gotham, and Robbinsville 28. You have bought from them occasionally, but thieving outweighs those few occasions.\" Holy crap. \"You've also been placed in and gotten kicked out of nearly every orphanage in the city, so I doubt putting you back in one is a very efficient solution to tonight's event.\" \"Okay I get it!\" I slumped back in my seat and grumbled, \"You're the goddamn Batman and you know everything about everyone. Message received.\" \"Not everything.\" I could swear I saw his mouth twitch up in a smirk, \"I've only skimmed your recent activity.\" \"Well you've got a lot of reading ahead of you, old man.\" I mumbled. He looked startled for a moment. Did my nickname offend him? Pretty sensitive for a guy in a bat costume. He didn't even look a day over thirty. \"So, what are we going to do with me?\" I sardonically quoted the line I've had nearly every cop ask me since I was a kid. \"You don't have any relatives? No one distant?\" It wasn't really a question, it sounded more like a confirmation. \"Nope. Don't want a family, don't need one.\" \"You sound like you speak from experience.\" This guy was good. \"I got adopted once.\" I admitted, \"It was right after – right after my mom died. I was nine. This nice married couple made the mistake of choosing me knowing they didn't understand me. In the beginning, they told me it was okay to be angry, said it was okay to be sad. But after while, they got tired of it, of me. They said I got too angry too often.\" I rolled my eyes. \"I broke things, got into trouble every day at school. Then one day, they find out they're pregnant, and they send me straight back to where they got me from.\" I shook my head and looked down at my hands, \"I figured it out too late. You have to hide the anger, mask the pain, control it. But that's just something I've never been able to do.\" I threw my hands up and let them fall back, slapping onto my knees, \"So here I am.\" \"I'm sorry.\" He looked like he actually meant it. \"Thanks. Your pity just warms my heart.\" \"What happened to your mother?\" I shrugged, making myself nonchalant as possible. \"We were both in a car accident. I survived, she didn't.\" Honestly, I couldn't remember much about it. I was young, and all I could ever remember from that night was unbelievable pain and someone pulling me out from the burning car before I'd blacked out. That pain never seemed to go away. Batman's voice pulled me out of my thoughts, \"What about your father?\" \"I never knew him. He left before I was born.\" The bitterness in my tone was audible even to me, and I scowled to myself in frustration. Get your act together, Ramirez! It was time to blow this popsicle stand while at least some of my dignity was still intact. \"Okay, Batman, I'm really tired and really, really hungry, and those two combinations don't really go well with me. Can we please just move on already?\" The guy was already one step ahead of me. I had to admit, I liked his efficiency. \"I had Commissioner Gordon find you a spot in a home for troubled youths. It's not far from here, so he'll be able to keep tabs on your behavior. They'll look after you there, help you get on the right track.\" This guy just totally lost the respect I had for him. Or what little I had of it, anyway. EXHAUSTED + STARVED = WHINEY TEENAGE TANTRUM I jumped out of my chair like I'd been electrocuted, and my voice practically rose an octave. \" Wha t ? You're locking me away in a dude ranch?\" Is this what Batman was for ? Did he chase bad guys all over the city just to send them to their room and make them think about what they've done? How was this vigilante justice!? \"Troubled youths homes isn't just for – \" \"No way! Look, Batman . I sleep on the streets . I live in the alleyways of Gotham. This is who I am, and no troubled youths home is going to change that. So deal with it .\" I stood up and stormed out of the small office, throwing the door open and slamming it shut behind me. I totally just signed my death sentence. I tried not to let that bug me. \"Alex!\" I came to an abrupt stop and whirled around just as Eddie caught my wrist, \"Alex, wait up!\" Air rushed back into my lungs. He was okay! \"No, you hurry up because we're leaving.\" I thumbed back to the entrance doors. He blinked in surprise, \"They let you off the hook?\" I snorted, \"When have they ever done that?\" \"Troubled youths home?\" He asked knowingly. \"Already registered. You?\" \"Same.\" Eddie frowned and cast a glance back at the hallway, \"Except they're separating us, putting a good ten mile radius in between us.\" He laughed, \"Like that'll stop us. We can probably sneak out before morning and meet back in Crime Alley. We'll see where we go from there.\" So the cops were putting distance between me and Eddie. Clearly, we were earning some kind of title. That was pretty cool. Then it hit me. Pulling my arm back, I glared up at him, \"Hold it, Santos. I'm not making any plans with you until you tell me why the cops were after you.\" Eddie sighed and looked at me gently, \"Relax, I explained everything to Grayson. It's all fine.\" Eddie got interrogated by Dick? No fair! Dick probably gave him a lollipop as a reward for fessing up. All I got was, oh that's right – nothing! \"No, it's not all fine! You do realize that the reason why we're in this dumb situation in the first place is because of you?\" I scowled and poked him in the chest. \"Yeah, yeah, rookie mistake, blah blah, you told me so, blah blah.\" He laughed at my expression, \"Don't worry, I'll explain everything to you later. Because right now, the big bad-ass bat is coming after us.\" \"Crime Alley after five?\" I mumbled, turning around to face the approaching Batman and Dick. Funny how they both seemed to share that air of calm authority. \"Make it six thirty. I need my beauty rest.\" Rolling my eyes, I resisted the urge to nudge him in the ribs. Dick grinned at me, \"Good to see you again, Alex. Bonus points for making a copy of my keys when I wasn't looking.\" \"Just goes to show you're always there to help, Dick.\" I pulled the key out from the pocket of my hoodie and tossed it to him. He swiftly caught it with a chuckle, \"Thanks.\" I looked to Batman, \"Hey, is it okay if Dick takes me to the home of my troubled self?\" Dick shook his head in amusement, and Batman…well, he had his Batman face on. \"Change your mind about the dude ranch already?\" Eddie stifled a snort of laughter. I rolled my eyes, \"No way. But I'm half asleep right now and a bed sounds really nice.\" My judgment was seriously clouded by utter exhaustion. Soon I wouldn't even be able to blink without nodding off. \"I can drop both of them off.\" Dick said to Batman. \"Then I'm done here.\" We all walked out into the night, and I shuddered as the cold night crept up my skin. I pulled the red hood of my sweatshirt over my head and shoved my hands into my pockets. I was itching to get into the patrol car and turn the heater up. I caught Batman's frown, and squinted my eyes at him, \"What? Red isn't your color?\" Dick laughed quietly, and Batman turned to disappear into the darkness. His voice echoed faintly around us, \"Stay out of trouble.\" Not possible. Trouble followed me.[Chapter 4] Wayne Manor. 03:21 AM Bruce's POV Bruce sat at the kitchen counter, absentmindedly stirring his steaming coffee. The mansion was dead silent, the only sound being his spoon repeatedly clinking against the walls of his coffee mug. Moments later, Alfred appeared at the door of the kitchen, pausing to observe Bruce frowning deeply at the cream colored walls. He crossed over to the fridge and began pouring himself a glass of milk, \"Nothing else planned for tonight, Master Bruce?\" \"Not for the next two hours, at least.\" Bruce lifted the mug to his mouth, but didn't drink from it. \"Are Tim and Damian still in San Francisco?\" \"Indeed they are. While you were out, however, Master Tim informed me that they were shortening their stay with the Teen Titans.\" Alfred began heating up his milk, \"It was evident from the tone in his voice that Master Damian had much to do with that schedule change.\" Bruce's lips twitched in a small smirk before taking a drink of his coffee. \"Hmm.\" In all honesty, he was glad to know his sons were coming back sooner than intended. The absence of bickering and punches and glass breaking was very noticeable, and the silence – something Bruce had always embraced – was loud enough to drive him mad. Alfred took his glass of warm milk and turned to Bruce, a slightly concerned and curious look showing on his face. \"May I ask how your patrol over the Northern side of the city went?\" Bruce set his mug down on the polished counter and looked at Alfred, \"Do you remember Alejandra Ramirez? The young girl Dick once told us about?\" Alfred thought for a brief second before nodding, \"Ah, yes. Master Richard is very fond of her, isn't he?\" \"I met her tonight, along with her friend Eddie Santos. They'd stumbled across the Batmobile and couldn't help but notice its tires.\" Alfred didn't seem to make the connection like Bruce had. His butler smiled, \"Master Richard did say she was one to stir up trouble. It's fairly logical that she knows how to use a lug wrench. And this wouldn't be the first time someone tries to steal your tires, it's happened occasionally in the past few years.\" Bruce drummed his fingers on the tabletop, his brow creasing, \"I checked the security footage from the car. Santos was the one who wanted to sell the tires. He didn't contemplate the risks, the consequences. But Alejandra did.\" \"I assume that's the result of living on the streets for so long. As I recall, Master Richard first came across her at the age of nine. She's had plenty of time to learn street smarts since then.\" \"She's different from the others on the street, Alfred.\" Bruce insisted, \"Those few people who've seen the Batmobile made the same mistakes as Eddie, if not more. They got too close too quickly, were too careless. But she didn't even get in range of the car. The only thermals and air currents the Batmobile registered were those of Eddie. Not to mention the video recognition got a clear shot of him. Alejandra showed up in the video, of course, but it was as if she positively knew they were both being recorded.\" Bruce recalled her paranoia from watching the footage. \" C'mon, Eddie, he's BATMAN for crying out loud! The guy is the world's greatest detective! The tires probably have tracking devices, or maybe the car has a camera running and is recording everything we're saying! He'll probably guess your name out of the top of his head just by seeing his tires have been stolen!\" \"Well, as Batman, you tend to stir up some wild imaginations in everyone, Master Bruce.\" Alfred said as he finished the rest of his warm milk. \"Perhaps Miss Alejandra has heard many bone-chilling stories about you.\" Bruce couldn't help but give a small smile, \"She reads the newspaper, too.\" Even Alfred seemed amused, \"My, there aren't many teenagers who do that nowadays. Master Damian snatches them from the front steps bright and early and gives it to Alfred the cat for his litter box.\" Alfred washed his glass and placed it back in its spot. He glanced back at Bruce and raised a brow, \"You seem to be taking quite an interest in this girl, Master Bruce.\" \"She seems very familiar.\" Bruce admitted after a long pause. \"Is it perhaps because she reminds you of yourself?\" Alfred mused. \"Or of any of the boys who've lived in this household? Lost, and in need of a true home?\" Bruce, unable to suppress his own theory any longer, rubbed his face and let out a heavy sigh, \"She reminds me of Jason.\" Alfred was quiet for a moment. When he spoke, his tone was cautiously curious. \"How so? If I remember correctly, Master Jason was just as careless about snatching your tires as the other street children were.\" \"I know, but…\" Bruce shook his head, \"You have to meet Alejandra yourself, Alfred. There's just something about her that screams Jason.\" He remembered the way her eyes – green eyes – flashed, her impatience, her temper, the way she masked her pain. It was like Jason in another body. The only difference between them was that Alejandra showed a degree of restraint…she had morals . Alfred interrupted his careening train of thoughts. \"Mmm, perhaps you can ask Master Richard to bring her here for an afternoon visit? He'll introduce us as his family, which is nothing but the truth, and we'll create the illusion that we're all fairly normal.\" Alfred smiled, \"It's not much of a challenge for this specific family, really.\" Bruce smiled wryly, \"That's not a bad idea, Alfred. Though we'll probably have to send Damian off to Japan for the day. Something tells me those two will clash heads, and Damian isn't one to hold back on a fight.\" \"Then it's settled. We'll have Alejandra Ramirez as our guest, and we'll all see for ourselves if any of part of her is Jason.\" Alfred was about to walk out of the kitchen, but he paused to look at Bruce. \"Master Bruce?\" Bruce looked back to Alfred, spotting the cautious look in his eyes. \"You do understand that by granting this young girl access into your home, you're also granting her access into your heart?\" There it was. The question Bruce knew Alfred had been tossing around from the beginning of this conversation. He sighed, \"It's not necessarily – \" \"Because we all know where it goes on from there, Master Bruce.\" Alfred continued kindly, but with an air of firmness, \"You hand them a cape and cowl, you exercise their abilities, and then the time comes when you let them leave the nest. And it's from there, Master Bruce, when terrible things start to happen.\" There was a slight quiver in Alfred's voice, and the sorrow in his expression was clear as daylight. \"And…if this girl carries the same character as Master Jason…\" \"I know.\" Bruce's voice came out harder than intended, and he slowly forced the death grip he had on his mug to loosen. He sighed, feeling that all too familiar guilt gnaw at his consciousness. \"That won't happen, Alfred. I'll make sure of it.\" There was a long pause of silence before Alfred's expression softened, \"Of course, Master Jason has improved greatly in character in the past few years. He even keeps in touch with us. I suppose much of it is due to the friends he carries, despite them being 'outlaws.'\" Bruce felt some of the weight in his chest lighten at the thought of the present Jason. He still carried his burning anger, but that was just something that ran so deep in Jason's bones that it was impossible for him to abandon it – Bruce finally understood that. But despite that lingering trait, Jason was still a hero. An anti-hero, but a hero nonetheless. Bruce felt some of his smile return, \"Yeah.\" He stood up and walked out of the kitchen with Alfred. Before they went their separate ways to their rooms, Alfred looked to Bruce, \"I suppose I should prepare a giant meal for when Miss Alejandra visits?\" \"Definitely. I can guarantee you there won't be any leftovers.\"[Chapter 5] \"Alex, do you really think I'd let anyone, let alone Batman , throw you in some random youths' home without me investigating first?\" Dick's extremely convincing and assuring tone nearly got me out of the police car, but I held my ground. I glared at him as I scooted further away from his outstretched arm and deeper into the backseat, \"First rule when you're out on the streets: never trust a cop!\" Eddie's laughter reached me from outside the car, \"Oh, the irony of that!\" Dick grinned, but continued trying to lure me out of the backseat of the car. \"Alex, I know you trust me , and I promise you'll be fine.\" I snorted in disgust, \"I'm not worried about my safety . I just hate that I'm being put into another building for the billionth time in my life!\" \"C'mon, Alex.\" Eddie said, and he came into view beside Dick, \"I thought you said you wanted to sleep in a bed tonight! Or whatever's left of the night, anyway.\" \"That was crazy talk. Now that I've had my five minute nap, I changed my mind.\" Eddie looked to Dick, \"If we'd done lesson eight on how to charm a lady, she would've thrown herself out of the car and into my arms ten minutes ago.\" Dick raised a brow skeptically, \"I don't think it would've made a difference. She's pretty much immune to your charms.\" \"At least she cuddled with me in the backseat when she was sleeping. I totally deserve bonus points for that.\" I immediately flared up at that, \"I was not cuddling you!\" \"Though it probably would've been more romantic if she hadn't been snoring. Not even your sirens could drown that out. Plus, I think she drooled on me.\" Eddie showed the sleeve of his gray sweatshirt to Dick. \"I thought you were a blanket!\" I snapped defensively. It wasn't a lie. I'd gotten into the backseat of the police cruiser and sat as far away from Eddie as possible – I was still ticked off about the mystery over why the cops had gone after him – and next thing I knew, he was waking me up and telling me to stop clinging onto him because I was suffocating him. It had been utterly humiliating and horrifying on my part. Eddie, on the other hand, couldn't stop grinning. \"You wish I was your blanket.\" \"I wish I could strangle you.\" I growled back. But the truth was, he did make a good blanket. Warm and comfortable and safe. Now I was just being ridiculous. \"Go on.\" Eddie said, his dark eyes laughing, \"I dare you to try it.\" I had to use every ounce of my fiber to suddenly not smile. The dare game was slightly different for the two of us. When we dared each other to do something, we weren't \"daring\" the other to perform the task at all. In truth, the secret message was: I dare you to stay mad at me. Despite my efforts, I felt the small corner of my mouth twitch up. \"Nice try, but I'm not falling for that.\" \"Well, we're gonna get you out of the car anyway, so why don't you come out while Dick's still asking you politely?\" He was right, we all knew I was going to walk into that building any moment now, and it would be way easier if I just spared everyone the time and effort and got out now. But that just wasn't in my nature. \"Tell you what.\" I suggested politely, \"Why don't we all get back in the car, drop Eddie off at his troubled youths' home, kick him out onto the front porch, and then come back here and – \" Before I'd even finished my sentence, the door I was backed up against suddenly opened, and I fell right out with my hood flopping over my head. Lucky for my skull, Eddie caught me from my armpits before I could hit the asphalt. He smirked down at me. \"You are way too stubborn for your own good, chica.\" And, before I could voice my protest, he scooped me up and carried me bridal style up to the front door of the home, where Dick was already waiting with his arms crossed and a smug smile on his face. \"Put me down before they open the door!\" I squirmed around frantically, but Eddie didn't let go. \"Oh c'mon, don't pretend you don't prefer this way better.\" His expression made it clear that he was having way too much fun with this. Dick elbowed Eddie with a wry smile. \"See? Who said you needed lesson eight?\" At that moment, the door was opened by a guy around Eddie's age and height, which, believe me, was pretty tall . Anyway, he also had shaggy blond hair that had natural brown streaks in it, and his eyes were green like mine, except his were probably a shade or two lighter and definitely looked better on him. Okay, so maybe being put in a troubled youths home wasn't all that bad… Eddie looked at the teenager in surprise, \"Nate?\" The boy – Nate , apparently – looked puzzled for a brief moment, but then he grinned and opened the door wider, \"Eddie Santos!\" They both bust into laughter as they did a handshake that was clearly well practiced. (I don't know how Eddie managed to do that without dropping me, but that question was quickly replaced by a new one.) My jaw dropped to the floor. They knew each other?! Nate looked to Dick and gave a more formal handshake, \"Hey, Dick. Good to see you around here again.\" \"The same to you. How're things going?\" \"Much better, actually.\" Nate smiled and gestured for us to enter, \"Come on in, Madeline's been waiting for you guys to arrive.\" \"Sorry if we kept you guys waiting up all night.\" Eddie said as he proceeded to carry me in, \"But you know how girls are.\" \"Put me down !\" I snapped, pushing myself away from him. \"See?\" Eddie said to Nate as he let my feet touch the ground. Once upright, I shouldered into Eddie, throwing him off balance and sending him stumbling to the side. He accidentally knocked a vase off its pedestal, and it crashed onto the floor. We all looked down at the spilled flowers in surprise. Dick looked to Nate darkly, \"This is only the beginning.\" \"No worries, there's a lot of roughhousing around here.\" Nate's grin softened into a smile as he looked at me, \"It's nice to see you haven't changed much, Alex.\" There was a heartbeat of silence. Dick coughed into his fist and I could swear I saw him smirk at Eddie. I raised my brows at Nate, \"You know me?\" \"With snoring like yours, who doesn't know you?\" Eddie joked, and I lightly elbowed him in the ribs, frowning as I kept my eyes glued to Nate. \"It was two years ago. I met Eddie on the streets after I got away from St Joseph's Orphanage.\" Nate explained to me, \"We became buddies in minutes, and he helped me stay on my feet for a while. The two of you were already friends at the time.\" Nate chuckled as he scratched his head, \"You didn't talk to me much, though.\" \"Don't worry, it takes a lot of work for her to like anyone.\" Dick assured Nate, \"She's always been like that.\" I stared harder at Nate, willing my brain to remember his face. But Eddie's been helping so many street kids over the years that I started losing track of them a long time ago. \"Nate's the guy who has the same birthday as me, remember?\" Eddie said, trying to help me out. \"Plus, you were pretty rude to him even though he was nice to you all the time, which, to be honest, really impressed me.\" My eyes widened as I suddenly remembered where I'd seen him before, but before I could say anything else, a young but tired-looking woman walked in. She stopped and blinked when she saw the mess on the floor, and a look of relief immediately replaced her confused expression, \"Oh good, I hated that vase.\" This place just kept getting better and better. \"Madeline, these are the guys you've been waiting for.\" Nate smiled as he thumbed to us. \"Of course!\" Madeline beamed at me, \"You must be Alejandra Ramirez. It's great to meet you. You're even prettier than I imagined. That's a compliment, by the way.\" \"Yeah, she is.\" Eddie's voice was so low I wasn't sure if he was being sarcastic, but I ignored him anyway and awkwardly shook Madeline's outstretched hand, \"Uh, hi. I got your vase knocked down. On accident. But I guess you don't really care.\" Madeline laughed as she waved her hand in the air dismissively, \"Oh, not at all. I hate the color orange.\" \"Thank you for giving Alex a place here, Madeline.\" Dick said, looking sincerely grateful. \"No one appreciates it more than I do, believe me.\" \" I believe you.\" I retorted, crossing my arms. Madeline didn't even seem to hear me. She was too busy staring dreamily at Dick's dazzling expression. Seriously. Happens all the time. With any woman. Any age. Any name. Dick Grayson, in the immortal words of his best friend Wally West (who I've met countless times before), was a dog . I let out an extremely loud sigh, and seemed to break Madeline free of Dick's spell. \"Oh, it's really no problem.\" Madeline said, blushing a bright pink. \"That's what this place is for.\" She paused before admitting sheepishly, \"Well, she'll be the only girl here. But this place isn't too crowded, either.\" I made a huge show of turning around and smiling widely at Dick, \"Mind passing that message along to your Bat friend ?\" I made sure the last two words dripped with heavy sarcasm. Dick looked slightly surprised, but he quickly smoothed his expression with a wry smile, \"If I ever see him again, I'll let him know.\" \"You better.\" A loud yawn escaped my mouth as I shoved my hands into the pocket of my hoodie. My eyelids were starting to feel heavy with sleep again. \"Well, I guess we'd better get going.\" Dick said to Eddie, who'd been nodding off the past few minutes. Dick walked up to me, giving me a stern look, \"Alex, I want as minimum amount of trouble from you in the next twenty four hours . Please.\" I waved my hand dismissively as I yawned again, \"Yeah, okay. You worry too much, Grayson.\" His expression softened as he gave me a warm smile, \"I'll keep in touch, like always. Okay?\" I had to smile at that, \"I know.\" Dick gave me a hug, and I got that same depressed feeling I've always gotten whenever he's dropped me off at an orphanage. I was so tired, I almost called him dad. \"See you later, Dick.\" He let go and smiled before looking at Madeline and giving her one of his renowned heart melting grins, \"Thanks again, Madeline. Call me if anything happens with Alex or anything else around here, or if you just feel like talking.\" Madeline's blush and smile deepened as she shook his hand and tucked her hair behind her ear. \"Of course. Thanks again, Richard.\" Clearly, Eddie was learning from the Master. \"Some words of advice, Nate?\" Dick gestured toward me with a tilt of his head, \"Stay sharp.\" I couldn't help but roll my eyes in exasperation, \"You say it like I'm going to kill him!\" Nate laughed as he moved to stand beside me, \"Thanks, Dick. I'll try.\" Dick waved one last time before walking out of the door, \"Make it quick, Eddie.\" Eddie wasted no time in crossing the short space between us and pulling me into his arms in a hug. He felt just as warm as when I'd drooled on him in the car, and I rested my forehead on his chest, something I've always done whenever he's had the rare opportunity to get his arms around me. \"You're suffocating me.\" I said sarcastically, my voice muffled by his sweater. He laughed. \"It's called payback.\" His head bent down to mumble in my ear, \"Six thirty, okay?\" \"Noted.\" Eddie released me and he smiled, playfully yanking my hood over my face, \"Bye, Little Red.\" I was surprised he'd suddenly used my old nickname from when we were kids, but I grinned as I shoved at him, \"So long, Dum-dum.\" Yep. My nickname for him was so much better. Eddie grinned at Nate as they did their handshake (which I now realized was from when they were younger), and said with a very grave look on his face, \"Good luck, hermano .\" \"Oh c'mon, I don't think she's that bad.\" Nate said, gesturing to me with an outstretched arm. Eddie laughed as he walked out, closing the door behind him. Madeline's hand rested lightly on my shoulder, and I peeled my eyes away from the door. \"Alex, your room is on the third floor on the left side of the staircase. Nate can lead you there, since he sleeps on the same floor. If you need anything, my room is down that hallway. Knock anytime you like.\" She pointed the way before giving a rather exhausted smile, \"I'll see you both in the morning. Or afternoon.\" \"'Night Madeline.\" Nate said as she turned to leave. We both made brief eye contact, but he quickly looked away, \"Uh, let's go this way.\" It was pretty quiet the long trek up the three flights of stairs, and I could tell Nate felt awkward, maybe even nervous. I couldn't help but smirk. He hadn't changed a bit. We reached the final floor and Nate led me down the hall to the last door on the left. He opened the door and flicked the lights on as we walked in. It was an ordinary room with a bed, a dresser, and a nightstand. The white walls were fairly clean, and there was carpet instead of wood like everywhere else. \"It's pretty decent.\" Nate said, echoing my thoughts. \"There's a window, too, in case you need some dirty air in your lungs, or if you want the police sirens to blast your eardrums off.\" He shrugged. \"That's always comforting. For me, at least.\" \"Yeah.\" After another long pause, Nate cleared his throat, \"So…uh, goodnight.\" He turned around. I bit my lip, hesitating. C'mon, Alex, say it. Just spit it out. Say it! \"We went to Elementary school together.\" I blurted out. Nate stopped and turned to face me, his lips twitching up in a small smile. \"You remember that?\" I let out a heavy sigh, \"Yeah. Well, only a little.\" His eyes lit up curiously, \"Like what?\" I plopped down on the edge of the bed, rubbing my eyes with the heel of my palm. Man, I was too tired for this. \"Uhh, we were in the same class in third grade. But I didn't notice you until after my mom died.\" That last word created a heavy silence in the room, but I pushed past it and continued with a mumble. \"It was my first day back in school after the accident. I wasn't doing well, not emotionally.\" I sat on the wooden bench, staring blankly at the ground in front of me. Everyone else was having a great time playing and laughing all over the playground. \"I didn't even notice when you came and sat a few feet away from me until you scooted closer.\" Nate hesitated before moving to carefully sit beside me on the edge of the bed. Nate inched closer to me, and I turned to stare before deciding to ignore him. I could see him fidgeting nervously from the corner of my eye, but I kept my eyes on the ground, not caring if he left or not. When the bell rang and Recess was over, all of the kids scrambled to line up for class. After several moments of waiting for me, Nate got up and ran to line up in front of our classroom. \"And at Lunch, you sat next to me again.\" I didn't even look at Nate as he sat beside me. He looked a little more relaxed this time. At some point, I noticed him scratching on the bench with a paperclip. But I ignored it and continued to stare at the ground. Later, the bell rang, and Nate got up to line up for class. \"When you stood up, I saw what you'd scratched onto the bench.\" Hi. Nate smiled sheepishly. \"I was too scared to talk to you. I felt like if I made even the smallest sound, you would break.\" \"I probably would have.\" I said, grimacing. I hated admitting it to myself, but I'd been extremely damaged in the first few weeks after my mom died. I hadn't known how to react to anything, let alone what to react to. Being absolutely and completely numb was a weird experience, but it hadn't lasted long. After those first weeks of emptiness were over, all I ever really felt was anger. \"It helped, though.\" I mumbled grudgingly, continuing the conversation. \"That one word made me feel…not completely alone. Like there was someone who actually noticed something was wrong with me, and actually cared .\" \"I did care.\" I sighed heavily, \"I know. And I hated you for that.\" He blinked in surprise, and I explained, \"I didn't want anyone to care, to help me. Not my foster parents, not the orphanage, not anyone. I was alone, and I wanted it to stay that way.\" I shrugged, \"But it didn't really work out, because I met Eddie and Dick, and I can't imagine where I'd be without them.\" I paused, \"Well, I know I'd be dead , but you get my point, right?\" Nate laughed quietly, \"Glad you cleared that up for me.\" His light expression saddened, \"Both of my parents were mugged. It was on their way home from having a dinner with some of their old friends. I'd stayed at home doing some homework, and the cops showed up to let me know what had happened. I was thirteen.\" I didn't say anything. I hated receiving pity, and I hated giving it just as much. But that was just because I knew pity was pointless, it didn't fix anything. \"You're a decent guy.\" I said, breaking the depressing silence. \"How'd you end up in a 'troubled youths home'?\" \"I was put in an orphanage, but I hated it. I went on my own for a while, and that was when I met Eddie and you.\" His mouth twitched into the smallest smile, \"You ignored me during the short time I spent with you guys, but Eddie and I got along great. After a while, though, I started getting pretty tired of being a stray, and when I came across Madeline, I let her put me in here. It's better than an orphanage, in my opinion. You don't have to worry about getting adopted or not.\" \"I prefer the cold, hard streets of Gotham to places like this. It's nice and all, but it's just not my comfort zone.\" It was ironic to describe Crime Alley as being a 'comfort zone', since the streets were anything but comforting. \"You'll get used to it.\" He offered helpfully. \"I doubt it. But this bed is pretty soft.\" I bounced lightly on it. Hmm, maybe too soft. I wasn't used to this kind of luxury. I'd probably end up sleeping on the floor, which also looked too comfortable for my liking. Nate chuckled, \"It was nice doing this…just talking.\" \"Yeah, I guess it was.\" Nate stood up and walked over to turn the lights off. He turned to smile at me, \"See you in the morning.\" \"Sure.\" He closed the door and I sat listening as his footsteps faded away. I flopped down on the bed and curled up in a ball, closing my eyes tiredly. I almost fell asleep, but the bed was too comfortable, just as I'd predicted. I rolled onto my other side, but it didn't work, either. I sat up and punched my pillow a couple of times before falling back onto it. After about half an hour of doing this, I growled in frustration and yanked the blanket off the bed, dragging it behind me as I lied down on the floor and pulled it over me. I fell right asleep. What is this? A \"long\" chapter? And what's the new character about? Well, I can be a sucker for romance. And love triangles. Love triangles are crazy.[Chapter 6] So the reason this took so long was because I kept changing my ideas. This is the one I stuck with, so ta da! It's finally here! And just in case you guys need a refresher, I recommend skimming chapter two. Hope you guys like it! :D \"You look awful .\" I grinned at Eddie as he made his way over to me. \"Yeah, well, three hours of sleep isn't exactly what you'd call beauty sleep .\" He plopped onto the curb beside me and exaggeratedly leaned against me, practically flattening me onto the sidewalk. \"Ugh. Can you carry me please?\" I smiled and pushed him back up into a sitting position. \"I can drag you back to you place, if you want.\" \"I'm cool with that.\" He mumbled, resting his forehead on my shoulder. I ruffled his already messy hair, \"Hey! No more sleeping!\" When he ignored me, I shoved him a little roughly, \" Despierta !\" I scowled, \"Eddie, c'mon. You still have to tell me why the hell you almost got arrested the other night.\" \"I tried to take Batman's tires. You were there, too. Good times, no?\" I rolled my eyes at him, \"I meant right before that. You know, when I was dreaming about waffles and then you woke me up because we had to chase the cops off our tails and one of them was like 'Hey, that's the Santos kid!' and I was like 'What the hell did he do now ?' and then we had to break through wood and my shoulder is still kinda sore from that and then we ran into Crime Alley and you saw the Batmobile and that was when you got the brilliant idea of – \" Eddie clamped a hand over my mouth, \"Message received!\" He rubbed his eyes with the heel of his free hand, \"You ramble on way too much when you're tired.\" Yeah, I babbled endlessly about the weirdest things when I was dog-tired. I got really emotional, too. Like, if you tell me the entire world's waffle factories were suddenly abducted by aliens, I'd bawl my eyes out. I swatted his hand away from my mouth and sighed as I struggled to clear my head, \"Look, I know whatever you did can't be as bad as what I'm imagining. When Batman took us to the police station, you got let off both hooks. They didn't keep you there for stealing the tires, and they didn't keep you there for the other thing you did, right? So…\" I leaned menacingly over him, \"Tell me!\" He smirked at my impatience and sat up, \"All right, just don't get too pissed off at me, okay?\" \"That's just letting me know that I should get pissed off.\" \"I was with Carina.\" Okay, that was unexpected. Just to clarify, Carina was Eddie's ex-girlfriend. And the reason for the \" ex \" part was kinda because of me, but not for the reason you're thinking, people! It wasn't because I was all jealous and nagging and whatever, because – news flash! – I didn't see Eddie that way! I mean, sure I did when I was way younger, but Eddie and Carina had been together barely a year ago, and I'd been pretty much over my little crush by then. Besides – as much as I hated admitting it – Carina was pretty cool, and she's always been nice to me, so I couldn't just hate her like I wanted to. But I'd kept my distance from her and Eddie anyway. Not just because they'd been disgustingly gooey to watch, but also because I'd known they were hanging out with trouble. See, Carina had an older brother who was a little older than Eddie, and of course the idiot had seen him as some sort of role model. Back then, Eddie would pretty much ditch me to be with Carina and Raphael all the time, and of course that pissed me off, but I'd never complained about it, I would just give Eddie the cold shoulder and stuff. The reason I bristled at Raphael was because I knew he worked with the drug cartels. I'd warned Eddie about it, but he'd promised me that he wouldn't get tangled up in stuff like that. Carina had doubted her brother, too, and she'd also warned Eddie from the beginning to not get involved with anything Raphael offered him. So, basically, we'd both warned Eddie, and he'd promised both of us that he'd steer clear from risks like that. Next thing you know, I was at the docks trying to save Eddie's butt from getting shot by a dozen armed guys. Yeah, it hadn't ended well. And I said that because I was the one who'd ended up getting shot in the shoulder, twice . Remember I told you guys that? I sure as hell remembered it. Anyway, the whole reason Eddie had broken up with Carina was because he'd felt bad about how his stupid actions almost got me killed, and he'd needed a break. Carina had totally understood, and I'd almost thrown up at how cliché and romantic their break-up was. I'd been a witness to it because they'd both been in the hospital room with me when they thought I was \"unconscious.\" So yeah, now you knew who Carina was. I wiped invisible dust off my sweater nonchalantly, \"Huh. You were with her? Wait.\" A grin spread across my face as I turned to look at him, \"Is she the one you've been trying to charm?\" Eddie rolled his eyes, \"No, it had nothing to do with that.\" \"Well, why else would she call the cops on you?\" His eyes widened and his mouth fell slightly open. We both stared at each other before immediately bursting into laughter. \"Oh, man! That was a good one.\" Eddie lightly shoved me and laughed again before smirking curiously, \"Am I really that bad at it?\" I looked up at the sky and tapped my finger on my chin as I pretended to think hard, \"Hmm, I'm the only one 'immune' to it, so my bet is that Carina's sitting in her room forcing herself to not beg you to take her back – \" I was cut off as Eddie leaned in slowly, his cool breath tickling my ear. \"So you're saying it works?\" He murmured, fingers lightly tracing slow circles on the back of my hand. What the – ? I forced myself to swallow and kept my tone nonchalant, \"Sure. Need proof? We get free, clean laundry every week.\" Eddie laughed softly and leaned back, and I immediately relaxed. \"Hey, lover boy?\" I waved my hand in front of his thoughtful face, \"I didn't wake up this early to give you romantic advice. That's what Dick's for.\" \"Yeah,\" He agreed, suddenly back to his normal self, \"you're terrible when it comes to that kind of stuff.\" \"Eddie, seriously, what did you do?\" I was at full attention now, ready to get down to business and yell at him for whatever it was he'd done. Eddie sighed and rubbed the back of his head, \"About a week ago, Carina found me and said she needed help getting Raphael out of some trouble with the drug cartels.\" \"Are you kidding me?!\" I was already frothing at the mouth. \"Have you not learned anything from the last time you did that? What the hell were you thinking, Eddie? You knew you were gonna get caught and yet you went out and help the idiot! What– \" Eddie waved his hand in the air dismissively, \"Yeah, yeah I know. It was stupid. I make a lot of mistakes, blah, blah. But look, that's not why I wanted to meet you here.\" He turned serious, \"While I was blending in with the guys, they said some things that I found pretty interesting.\" \"Like what?\" I demanded, still irritated. \"They were complaining about how their boss had no idea what the hell he was doing, and that they'd been better off with the Red Hood.\" I blinked in surprise, my annoyance vanishing. The Red Hood was someone I'd always been curious about. Probably because I felt I could relate to him, you know, anger-wise. And, call me crazy, but he seemed weirdly…familiar. \"Yeah. They were just talking about how he disappears and reappears around town randomly, and how they think he's searching for something, or some one .\" \"Well, he works with the Bat Family.\" I pointed out, \"He's probably just helping out on one of their scope-outs or something.\" Eddie shrugged, \"I don't know, maybe. But the way those guys said it, it sounded like he was looking for someone important.\" \"Well, it's not like it has anything to do with us.\" I narrowed my eyes at him, \"So I don't care that you got to gossip about Red Hood, or that you managed to help Raphael out without ending up behind bars or in the hospital, or that you looked like a ' hero' in Carina's eyes. You scared the hell out of me when the cops were after you. So don't ever do anything stupid like that without telling me, got it?\" Eddie put a hand over his heart and smiled mockingly, \"It makes my insides all warm and fuzzy knowing you freak out over my safety, Alex.\" \"I'm not kidding.\" I growled, refusing to let that smile of his get to me. \"Because of the little 'misunderstanding' the cops had with your involvement in drugs, we got thrown into troubled youths homes!\" I sharply pointed an accusing finger at him, \"I was forced to sleep on carpet because of you!\" Eddie arched an eyebrow, \"What was wrong with the bed?\" \"What else? It was too soft.\" He laughed and shook his head, \"You're incredible.\" He suddenly remembered something, and sat up, \"Hey, so did you get to talk to Nate? Do you remember him a little more clearly now?\" \"Yeah, I remember him.\" I mumbled, toying with the string of my red hood. I'd decided the moment I climbed out my window that I wouldn't tell Eddie about my conversation with Nate because it felt so…personal. There wasn't much I remembered from before my mom's death, and I didn't know if it had to do with trauma or if it was because I just had a really bad memory. But this was one of the few things I actually remembered clearly, and I wasn't sure if I wanted to share it with anyone, even Eddie. It felt that special. Eddie gazed at me curiously, and I knew he knew I wasn't telling him everything. I sighed, \"And I apologized for being a jerk when he tagged along with us two years ago.\" His suspicious expression cleared, and I suppressed a sigh of relief. Eddie smiled, \"That's nice. You'll grow to like Nate, he's a cool guy.\" \"I bet. You two even have your own special handshake going on there.\" \"Bromance is a common thing.\" I snorted and rolled my eyes, \"Looks like Carina has some competition to worry about.\" Eddie laughed, \"You're so cute when you're jealous.\" \"I'm not jealous!\" I exploded. \"That's what any jealous person would say. But okay.\" \"Ugh.\" I buried my face in my hands, \"Can we just go already? You told me everything that happened, and that's all I needed to know. And I forgive you for being an idiot. With a huge heart.\" I shook my head, \"You really can't stop yourself, can you? You just have to help anyone who needs it.\" I looked up, and he was gazing at me with those eyes of his. \"Well yeah.\" He said softly, \"You were the first person that ever helped me when I was on the streets. Remember the sandwich? I knew you were starving as much as I was, but you practically forced me to take it. So now, whenever I see someone who's as desperate as I was, I can't help but help them.\" He smiled at his weak pun. \"Know why? Because every time I aid someone in their time of need, I feel like I'm honoring you .\" Whoa… \"Even if it gets you killed?\" Instead of coming out sarcastic, my voice sounded ridiculously small. Curses! What was up with me? \"Sure, why not?\" Something in my expression caught his attention, and his own teasing expression softened. \"But don't ever worry about that, okay? I'll never leave you . I promise.\" He paused and then gave a small smile, \"For real this time.\" There was a long pause as I struggled to compose myself. Remember how I said that I get real emotional when I'm dead tired? Yeah, well, I was about ready to embarrass myself and cry Niagara Falls out of my eyeballs. \"That sandwich meant a lot to you, didn't it?\" I joked, hoping my grin looked just right. Eddie smiled and rolled his eyes, \"Sure. The sandwich.\" \"Sandwiches are cool. But waffles are better.\" \"I bet they'll serve you some if you get back in time.\" \" That would be awesome.\" I grinned for real this time. We sat there for a few more moments, and I relaxed again when the mood returned back to normal. After a while, when the skyline started to lighten, I got up and held my hand out to Eddie, helping him to his feet. \"Do you think they actually give us the freedom to spend life outside?\" I suddenly asked, referring to the troubled youths' homes. Eddie thought for a moment, \"Orphanages didn't. But maybe these guys do.\" I perked up, \"So we don't have to wake up in the early hours and sneak out just to talk?\" Eddie laughed, \"I guess not.\" He smiled and raised a questioning brow at me, \"Does that mean we're sticking to living under a roof for a while? Because, I really don't mind.\" He shrugged, \"Surprisingly, it's not as bad as orphanages are.\" \"We can give it a shot.\" I agreed. \"Cool! But we should probably get back before they notice we escaped and, you know, kick us out.\" \"I almost forgot to tell you!\" I grinned widely up at him, \"My home is a dude ranch! I should have totally made a bet with Batman. Damn it! Why didn't I do that?\" I face-palmed myself. Eddie laughed and stepped closer, gently placing my hood over my head, \"See you later, Alex.\" He shoved his hands into the pockets of his sweatshirt and turned to jog away. I watched him disappear safely around the corner, and then turned to go my own opposite way. I realized I was still grinning, and I snorted at myself. \"You're a mess, Alejandra. Seriously. Stop acting like such a girl.\" After walking down a few blocks, I suddenly found myself thinking about what Eddie said about the Red Hood. \" They think he's searching for something, or some one .\" Strangely enough, that sentence was enough to make my chest tighten. But before I could think about it any further, I was knocked back into the alley wall by something that had the full force of a freaking wrecking ball. I fell forward onto the ground with the wind completely knocked out of me. The back of my head throbbed a little painfully, and colorful splotches briefly smudged my vision. I blinked them back and looked up, feeling my jaw drop lower. Some fat guy was the one who'd flattened me to the brick wall, and he was already out cold. But he wasn't the one I was looking at. I was gawking at the guy who'd thrown Fattie. \" Batman ?!\" Everything came to an abrupt stop, and all two dozen mercenaries turned to stare at me. Even Batman halted, looking momentarily stunned at seeing me there. Great. I'd landed right in the middle of something huge , and there was a very, very small chance I'd get out of it alive. \" Smoke her !\" Incredibly teeny, tiny, small chance. Thoughts? I welcome any! :] and P.S. Nate and the whole bench thing are kinda based on something similar that happened when I was in elementary, so \"Nate\" is a real person! Sort of![Chapter 7] Jason's POV. On a rooftop. Moments before… The Santos kid was sitting way too close to her, and that was something I was very, very annoyed at. Arsenal, on the other hand, was just about ready to blow our cover by breaking into gut-busting laughter. I knew I shouldn't have let him tag along, but the red-head just wouldn't back down from getting the chance to see his 'niece' again, even if from a safe distance. I couldn't blame him. \"You should really see your face, Jay.\" He snorted a laugh, \"If you were Superman, Eddie's ashes would already be floating their way off Earth and out to Krypton by now.\" I rolled my eyes at his lame joke, \"I have my helmet on, Roy. You can't see my face.\" \"Oh please, as if anything could hide your overprotective daddy face right now.\" I snorted as I glared down at Eddie, muttering under my breath. \"I've got to tell Dick to stop giving the kid those damn lessons on how to get a girl.\" As much as I hated admitting it, I knew for a fact that they worked . Roy smirked as he pulled his baseball cap off and ran a hand through his damp hair, \"That kid is learning from the Master Dog. I'm surprised Alex hasn't given in yet. Santos has looks, charms, and he's her best friend. It's like straight out of some trashy romance novel!\" He grinned as he fixed his cap back on, \"Speaking of Golden Boy, is Nightwing in town tonight, or is he playing vigilante in Blüdhaven?\" I fixed my attention back on Alex and Eddie below, narrowing my eyes into slits as he leaned in a micrometer closer to her with a warm smile on his face. \"Pretty sure he's back in his apartment in Blüdhaven by now. He said to meet up there later for the weekly update.\" It was the perfect chance to threaten Dick into forcing Santos back off from my daughter. I was still enormously pissed off that his idiocy had once nearly cost her an arm . It was thanks to Dick that I was able to donate blood without raising any suspicions from anyone, not even from Bruce. He was still in the dark about who Alex was, and I wasn't about to change that. The less people knew about Alex, the safer she would stay. Roy let out a bored groan as he dangled his legs over the edge of the building. Pulling an arrow from his quiver, he strung it onto his bow and casually aimed at Eddie. \"We've been stalking Alex for like what, five years now? That's more than a thousand weekly updates with Nightwing! When are you going to tell her the truth?\" He demanded and turned his head to raise his brows at me, \"Or are you planning to tell her at all anymore?\" \"Knowing would just put her at risk.\" Again. \"Besides, she doesn't need me, she's got Nightwing. And God knows he makes a better dad than I ever did.\" It was pretty obvious that Alex saw him as a father, too. It stung, and also brought all that wonderful pent-up anger and jealously towards Dick boiling back to the surface. My big brother would forever outshine me. But, honestly, it was because I'd known he'd be so damn good at it that I put Dick in charge of being there for Alex, since I couldn't. \"So you're never going to tell her? About any of it?\" \"Don't you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk, Harper? Because I do.\" \"So you won't because you think she'll hate your guts, never accept you, kick your sorry ass out of her life and move on without you? Well, I say bullshit.\" He threw an arm out to the clouded sky, \"You said the exact same thing about Claudia, and she did none of the above except chew you out for not telling her sooner that you'd come back down from St. Peter's pearly white gates.\" \"It's not the same .\" I ground my teeth in frustration, lowering the heat in my voice. \"And you sure as hell know why I can't do it.\" Roy was unfazed by my attitude, as usual. He suddenly turned serious. Well, as serious as Roy can get. \"Yeah, I was there when it happened. The whole time. But I also saw you live your life with Claudia, Jason.\" He paused, looking out across the rooftops a little sadly, before suddenly exploding. \"For God's sake the three of us shared one damn apartment! How could I miss anything ? Sure, you and Claudia were able to get it on, but whenever I wanted to bring a girl over I had to pay for a hotel!\" He snorted, \"And don't even get me started on laundry nights.\" There you go. Roy was incapable of being a serious guy. And I just had to smirk at that last statement. \"You two were crazy in love, Jason. And when I watched Bambi with Alex for the first time,\" He shook his head, \"let me tell you, Twitterpated is a real thing.\" I choked a snort at what was once Alex's and Claudia's favorite movie, \"Twitterpated.\" God, he missed her. \"And let me also tell you for the billionth time that I miss those days.\" Roy looked back down to Alex. \"I remember when we went through nine months of hell with a pregnant Claudia, and then when Alex barfed on me for the first time, and when you and I taught her everything we knew about kicking ass.\" Roy patted his archery bow affectionately, \"And then you just let all of that fade away. Don't look at me like that, Jay, I get why you did it. I would've done the same. But that doesn't mean I don't get nostalgic every now and then.\" Alex and Claudia had died . Black Mask. He'd figured it all out, had the Riddler piece the thousand piece puzzle together. He learned everything about Claudia, her connection with me, and hit the jackpot when he found out about Alejandra's existence. The car crash? It had been no … damn … accident . By the time I'd gotten to the site…Claudia was gone. Alex was barely alive. My nine-year-old had died in my arms. But that man in the ambulance – Eugene – he brought her back . \"There's no such thing as a lost cause,\" he'd said with a smile. I hadn't bothered to tell him the woman I loved was in the other ambulance, the silent one. It hadn't mattered that, legally, I was listed as John Doe, Claudia Ramirez as Paula Garcia, and Alejandra as Lizeth Ruiz. The enemy had found my weak points. And that left me with no alternative. I couldn't watch my daughter get hurt because of me. I'd had a member of the All-Caste, one of Ducra's gifted friends, erase me completely from the past nine years of Alejandra's life. I vanished from her memories. So did uncle Roy, and Dick, because he'd also known her from the day she was born. Up until now, Alex believed that, for the first nine years, the only one she had was her mother. She didn't remember dying, either. I'd had Ducra's friend do the same with Black Mask and Riddler's memories, and I'd personally taken care of every single one of their goons. The only thing that had stopped me from taking care of the bastard ringleaders myself was Nightwing. Killing them would have attracted Batman's attention, and that was the last thing I'd wanted at the time. That was also when I had Dick take up the mantle of being her guardian, because he was the only one I trusted to watch over Alex without tipping his hand. Even though he could be my least favorite person sometimes, Dick was also the greatest brother I could ever ask for. Timmy and Damian didn't quite make the list of 'Favorite Brother' yet, but Damian was ahead of Drake by a mile. Roy suddenly punched my arm as he leaned forward to get a closer look at the scene below, \"They're leaving!\" Alex watched Eddie disappear safely around the corner before heading down her own way, and I stood up. \"They were talking about you, you know. Or, well, Red Hood.\" Roy said, stretching and popping his joints. \"She seemed pretty interested, though she was yelling at Eddie most of the time. Best part of their conversation, in my opinion.\" I ignored his comment as I leaped off the rooftop, keeping a sharp eye on Alex. \"Hurry up or we'll lose her.\" Roy easily kept his pace behind me. \"Didn't you say we were gonna scope out the docks for the mercenaries Batman's after? Unless they changed their drop spot, we're missing out on the best fight we've had all day!\" I narrowed my eyes at what I saw below. \"I wouldn't worry about that, buddy.\" We both stopped at the edge of the roof we'd just landed on. Alex had tripped and fallen forward onto the asphalt, interrupting the fight between Batman and the mercenaries he'd been after. \" Smoker her !\" One of the armed men quickly lifted his new, shiny AK-47 and aimed it at Alex's head. \"Shit.\" Roy hissed, voicing my thought as he swiftly pulled an arrow from his quiver and aimed. But Alex was much, much faster. She rolled and jumped onto her feet, flipping over the stream of bullets and kicking the weapon out of the guy's hand. She landed behind him in a crouch and swung her foot out in an arch, gracefully sweeping his feet out from under him. Everything got real quiet. Even Alex looked shocked at what she'd just done, and she stood up, backing away warily. From my peripherals, I saw Bruce suddenly stare up at me and Arsenal. I resisted the urge to point at Alejandra and shout, \"Hey, Bruce! That's my girl!\" \"Maybe she remembers some of her training after all.\" Roy muttered after a stunned pause. The fighting immediately resumed, and Bruce was swiftly taking handfuls of men out while another chunk headed for Alex. She'd made herself a target. Perfect. \"Arsenal!\" I ordered, and leaped off the fire escape, landing just as Roy's arrow struck the center of the battlefield and released a thick cloud of cover smoke. I raised my voice above the coughing, \"So how do you want to handle this?\" I twirled my favorite Kris blade in my hand and moved around, slicing the straps that held their guns to their chests. \"All at once, or do you want me to kick your butts one at a time?\" Someone bumped into me from the back, and I glanced over my shoulder to see Alex backing away from one of the mercenaries. She looked back at me in surprise, \"Red Hood!\" \"Keep moving!\" I said sternly, watching as two more goons found us in the chaos and fixed their eyes on Alejandra. \"Make an opening!\" A new look of determination suddenly formed on her face, and I was momentarily brought back to the time when she was younger, when I was training her. I smirked at knowing the results had always been, and would always be, success. Simultaneously taking out a couple more circulating guys, I kept a close eye on Alex as she charged at the first goon, blocking his fist with her hand and sharply twisting his arm behind his back at an uncomfortable angle. She turned him around, using him as a human shield against the kick from the second goon, and he was quickly rendered unconscious. Alex dropped him and lunged at the second goon. She knocked his arms to the sides and landed a hard kick to his chest, sending him flying back against the brick wall. I finished wiping out the last of my share of criminals, and stood watching as Alex ran, somersaulting in the air and kicking the armed mercenary onto the ground. She landed feet-first on his chest, completely knocking the wind out of him and probably snapping a rib or two. Still looking pretty shocked and impressed with herself, Alex stepped back and leaned forward on her knees to catch her breath. She caught my eye, and a grin suddenly lit up her face. It was just like in the good old days. Alex jogged over to me, throwing her arms up in awe. \"That was incredible! I didn't even know I could do all of that! And when you instructed me – it was like some instinct kicked in! And your fighting is, it's amazing !\" Roy and Bruce approached us, and both Alejandra and I turned to them at the same time, \"Hey, Batman.\" Roy suddenly had the biggest grin on his face, and I thought I was going to have to knock him out to prevent him from enveloping Alex in a bear hug. Batman gazed at me steadily, \"No major injuries?\" I snorted, \"It takes more than two dozen lousy mercenaries to lay a scratch on me, but I'm gonna go ahead and assume what you're asking me is if I killed any of them.\" I nodded to the mess of unconscious bodies all around us. \"And the answer is no.\" \"He's a new man, Batman.\" Arsenal said with an easy grin, but Bruce's face didn't change. Bruce looked to Alex, \"You seemed to manage just fine.\" It sounded pensive, and faintly suspicious. I kept my posture relaxed. Alex shrugged, \"I guess. I'm still trying to figure out how I'm alive.\" \"Of course, you wouldn't have been in this situation in the first place if you'd stayed put in your new home.\" Bruce said calmly, but with an air of firmness in his tone. Wait, Bruce put Alex in a troubled youths' home? Dick had some explaining to do. And for his sake, he'd have better placed her in a good one, not like the piece of crap I'd unintentionally been thrown into. But I also remembered that when Bruce had gotten me out of the hellhole, he'd made a note to change the sorry circumstances in all of Gotham's youths' homes. Even now, there wasn't anything billionaire Bruce Wayne couldn't fix. Alejandra rolled her eyes at him, \"Yeah, well, first of all it is a dude ranch, hope Dick told you that, and second, the bed was too soft. Overall it's pretty nice, though. And as for it being filled with boys, I can't help it if there aren't enough rebellious street rats who're girls.\" Roy chuckled, \"Can't argue with that logic.\" Alex drew her attention to him, and the smile returned to her face, \"You're Arsenal, right? From Star City.\" Roy looked surprisingly calm and at ease as she gripped his outstretched hand, \"Glad to make your acquaintance.\" I looked to Batman, \"So, looks like we were able to help you out with this job after all. Count on us for anything else.\" \"I appreciate it.\" It sounded sincere, grateful, and for that brief moment, he was Bruce. I shoved my hands into my pockets and glued my eyes to Alex, \"Great job tonight.\" \"Thanks,\" Her grin softened into a smile, \"Red Hood.\" I turned to walk away, but Roy suddenly held his bow out to stop me. I raised a questioning brow at his firm expression. Roy suddenly smiled as he looked at Alex warmly, \"It was great seeing you again…Alejandra.\" All of us froze except for Roy, who remained completely calm. It wasn't a slip, he'd done it on purpose . \"I'm going to kill you.\" I muttered, clenching my jaw. Alex looked stunned, confused, and frustrated all at the same time. \"You know me.\" It wasn't a question. She and Batman stared at Arsenal, then switched their burning glares directly to me. I watched Alex's eyes, my eyes, glint menacingly in the moonlight. Her whole posture tensed, all traces of friendliness gone. \"Who are you?\" She demanded. I glared at Roy. His confidence faltered under my stare, but he remained resolute. \"No more weekly updates, Jason .\" \"Jason?\" Alex immediately echoed the name. Roy, unable to handle my silent glare any longer, quickly turned to face Alex. \"His name is Jason. Jason Todd. I'm Roy Harper. Jason is – \" \"I'm your dad.\" I ended flatly, it was almost harsh. I turned to look at Alex, whose eyes widened. I felt my stiff expression soften, and I lifted my hands to my head. There was a small hiss as air was released from my helmet, and I pulled it off, knowing she'd see her own eyes looking back at her. I repeated it more softly, with more meaning, letting it slip into the night, making it official. \"I'm your dad.\" Finally! This moment took too long to get here! :) I didn't really know how to portray Jason's person correctly, and I'm sure I didn't do him justice here, but I guess it helps to keep in mind that he's subject to change (for those of you who read Red Hood and the Outlaws, the most recent issue kinda has to do with that, in a way?). Yeah. And Arsenal is in here! He was easier to portray, but again, I'm not sure I did him justice. Anyway, thanks for reading! :D[Chapter 8] Special thanks to the awesome and funny imaninja41 for inspiration! :D Wayne Manor. Alejandra's POV \"You KNEW?!\" \"Alex – \" \"Alex nothing ! God dammit , Dick, you KNEW!\" I raised my hands to grab my head, just about ready to tear my hair out. \"You – BOTH of you! What the HELL?!\" Dick was looking pretty hurt about my reaction, and that only motivated me to pour more lemon juice onto the cuts. Roy was looking pretty guilty about it all, and he had every reason to be because he was also a part of the whole damn LIE, even if he had been the one to spill it. Bruce – yeah, that's right, BRUCE – had gotten past the initial shock and was looking stern and just about ready to stop my ranting, but there was no way in hell he was going to tell me to stop, even if he was the goddamn Batman . And Jason , my dad , he was standing there watching it all play out with a tense, grim expression. I didn't deny the fact that he was my dad because, surprisingly, I saw lots of me in him. That only seemed to aggravate me even more . But there was no way in hell I was gonna cry. No tears of anger or sadness or joy or whatever. No way. I was NOT going to cry . \"After all these years I thought I was an orphan, it turns out I never was! I had a family , a home, everything! And you – \" I looked directly at Jason, \"you just wiped my memories away and left me.\" My voice cracked near the end, and I grew only more infuriated with myself. \"You have no idea how frustrating it is to look at you and not be able to remember any of it. Yeah, you already explained everything, and I get why you did it. But… why ?\" The words were starting to spill out, and I panicked when I realized I couldn't stop them. \"I wanted a dad! I used to pretend Dick was that dad!\" I threw an arm out to Dick, whose expression softened. \"But it was never enough. I needed you , Jason. I wouldn't have cared that I would be in danger, a target or any of that crap you talked about. You said you trained me, right? I could've been your sidekick! Why didn't you just let me stay with you? Why the HELL didn't you?!\" I was practically shouting at the end, but he didn't even flinch. \"Claudia died because of me .\" Jason finally ground out, \"I wasn't going to make my own nine-year-old daughter bait by putting her in a cape and cowl and sending her off to her death again .\" Out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw Bruce's expression sadden the tiniest bit. \"Well maybe it's better than everything I've been through!\" I snapped. I started counting on my fingers, \"I died in the car crash, I came back, I was homeless on the streets of Gotham, I got shot in the arm twice , didn't die, and after being on Gotham's streets for five years, I'm not dead . So have a little faith that your kid's not some helpless little girl who can't take care of herself.\" \"I know you can.\" I spluttered in anger and disbelief, \"Then why – \" \"Because you're not my sidekick!\" His eyes flashed brightly for a moment, but it quickly diminished. His voice came out quietly when he spoke. \"You're my daughter.\" Not gonna cry not gonna cry not gonna cry. Goddammit don't cry. \"I can be both.\" I paused to compose myself a little before adding thickly, \"I want to.\" Jason opened his mouth to argue, but I beat him to it. \"It's the least you can do to make up for taking my memories. Which, apparently, you can't get back.\" I gave a hard, sour smirk, \"You owe me.\" \"No.\" \"I'll throw a tantrum.\" He scoffed, and I could swear I saw a teasing light in his eye. \"Do you know how many of your tantrums I've handled before?\" \"That's a rhetorical question, right?\" Roy got up to intervene, \"C'mon, Jason. Let her be one of us.\" He gestured to everyone who was in the room. I was pretty sure even Alfred counted as a hero. \"You and I both know for a fact that she can do this. We'll all keep training her and kick it up a notch, and we won't let her out onto the playing field until you see she's ready. And it's just like she said.\" Roy shoved Jason's shoulder, \"You owe her.\" I grinned. Okay, so \"uncle Roy\" was pretty cool. I was still holding a grudge against all of them, though. Sort of. \"She's not going to let it go, Jason.\" Dick said, smiling knowingly in my direction. \"Alex doesn't take 'no' for an answer. You've always known that.\" Jason looked from Roy to Dick, then to me, and finally to Bruce. A secret conversation seemed to go on between the two of them. And when Jason finally looked away in slight annoyance, I got the feeling that they were gonna have a talk later. Jason looked at me again, and I crossed my arms over my chest challengingly. There was a long silence, and I felt some of my confidence start to falter, but I refused to let him see my panic. \"Welcome back.\" He finally whispered, his eyes glowing warmly. He meant it. He really, actually, seriously, meant it. I was going to be an awesome, kick-ass sidekick with awesome bad-ass mentors. Could it get any more epic? And when Jason grabbed me in a tight hug, I found I couldn't let go. I was probably never going to let go. Just like I was probably never going to stop being a big, giant, crybaby. And just for the record, I fail epically at holding grudges. (Obviously)[Chapter 9] The bed from the troubled youths' home was a piece of cardboard compared to the one in my new room. And \"room\" was way too much of an understatement. The place was so huge, I could probably get lost in the closet - if it had clothes in it. \"Shopping?\" I scoffed, \"Not really my thing.\" \"I know it's kind of a new thing for you, but you can't wear the same clothes for the rest of your life.\" Jason stated matter-of-factly. \"There's a Laundromat down the street that can say otherwise.\" I tugged at my plain, baggy t-shirt. \"Look, I get you. But legally, you're signed up as Bruce Wayne's adopted daughter, because I'm legally dead. And that would look a little weird to the government.\" \"And John Doe can't afford to adopt a kid, right?\" I smirked at his fake citizen name. He smiled wryly, \"Right. And that means you're a Wayne, which means – \" \"That technically I'm your sister? That's crazy cool.\" I laughed. \"Well, yeah. But it also means that you have to make a good image.\" \"Because you're all a family of vigilantes and no one can know, I get it, I get it.\" I rolled my eyes, \"Jeez. I'm not totally ignorant, you know.\" \"Glad you cleared that up for me.\" I glared at him warningly, \"Just no dresses.\" Jason scrunched his face up in mock pity, \"Oooh, afraid I can't help you with that, kid. Bruce Wayne is renowned for his galas. And since he adopted you…\" He grinned evilly, and it really was like he was my older brother more than my dad. \"Whatever. I'm going in my pajamas.\" 0o0o0o0o0o0o0o Going to the mall was supposed to be Jason's and my first \"father-daughter experience\", but when we got back to the mansion with a whole bunch of t-shirts and jeans and converse and boxers as my pajamas, Dick called up someone named 'Barbara' and ushered me and Jason back into the Ferrari. Even uncle Roy agreed to tag along. \"Can't we get into the Lamborghini?\" I begged, gluing my eyes to the sleek, silver beauty. \"It's so much faster than the Ferrari.\" \"Thank God you haven't forgotten how to speak Car and Driver.\" Roy grinned. Jason gave Dick a look, \"Told you.\" \"If I let you drive it you're just going to go way over the speed limit.\" Dick said wearily, like he'd explained this to a child a million times before. He paused and then added, \"Again.\" Jason rolled his eyes, \"That's what it was made for, Golden Boy.\" \"You guys have a Lamborghini ,\" I began, leaning forward between the two front seats, \"And you rarely let it leave the garage ? Is this part of the whole 'image' and 'keeping the secret identity' thing? Because if that's the case, then there's no point in me wearing any of the dresses you're forcing me to get.\" Jason snickered, and Dick smoothly steered the car out and onto the road. \"You need to look like Bruce Wayne's newly adopted daughter. Not all the time,\" He added just as I opened my mouth to protest, \"But at least for the gala tonight.\" I slumped back into the backseat, strapping my seatbelt on. \"Why does Bruce throw so many parties?\" I muttered. \"They're not for entertainment.\" Jason explained, \"He uses them as a distraction so he can suit up as Batman. It's for serious situations only, though.\" I blinked in disbelief, \"So while Grandpa Bats is out kicking ass, I'm going to be stuck in a party with a dress on? How is that justice ?!\" \"She sounds just like Claudia.\" Roy mused beside me. Jason smiled in response. The rest of the car ride was great. I didn't know if it was because the past me already felt natural around these guys, or that they were just awesome people to be around. My guess was that it was both reasons. We arrived at the mall (again) and it was funny how every young woman stopped whatever it was they did to bat their eyelashes at dad, Dick, and Roy. A lady in heels walked by, giving Dick a flirtatious wink. Dick gave a dazzling smile, and I busted into laughter when she nearly tripped over herself. Dick turned his head and smiled as he raised a brow at me. \"I thought you were used to that by now.\" \"Yeah. But that doesn't mean it stops getting funny.\" I snorted, smirking again. \"It's not gonna be so funny when you're the one walking in heels.\" Roy mocked, bumping his shoulder against mine. \"Like hell I'm buying heels. I'm gonna wear the new shoes that Jason got me.\" \"Converse don't count as party shoes.\" Dick said, rolling his eyes at Jason. \"Calm down, diva. Damian wore a nice red pair for a gala once.\" Jason waved his hand dismissively. \"Hey, when can we get something good to eat?\" I asked, all of the steamy food smells making my mouth water. \"After we get this over with.\" We all stopped and blinked in surprise as a pretty redhead got up from her table and walked over to us. I could swear I saw Dick light up like a light bulb. Now that was something I wasn't used to seeing. \"Hey, Babs.\" \"I thought you were joking when you told me,\" Barbara – apparently – said. She scrutinized me for a few seconds before smiling wryly. \"You look like him.\" \"Unfortunately.\" I grinned back at Jason. \"Hey, Dick isn't the only one who can get a lady's attention.\" Roy tauntingly elbowed Jason with a smirk, \"And you always say Dick is the dog.\" \"Can't you ever keep your mouth shut, Harper?\" \"You really still call me that?\" \"Hey, West started it. And frankly, it fits you.\" I raised a brow at them before turning to Barbara, \"Uhhh…?\" She totally read my unsaid question and smiled, \"So Bruce is having a gala tonight, right?\" We both walked beside each other as the three continued to bicker behind us. \"Yeah. So…are you some kind of shopping expert?\" I asked, unable to keep the distaste from my tone. Barbara choked a snort, \"No way. I don't even know why Dick called me for this. I'm not at all helpful when it comes to clothes shopping.\" I shrugged and shoved my hands into my pockets. \"If it makes you feel any better, I've never even been shopping.\" She smiled ahead. \"Do you have an idea of what type of dress you want to wear?\" \"I don't want to. But nothing frilly, and God forbid anything pink .\" I gagged. Seriously. Who in their right mind would ever invent the color pink ? Barbara laughed, \"You just made my day a whole lot easier, Alex.\" 0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o \"Around the whole manor? You're joking, right?\" \"Consider it the first part of your training.\" Jason said as he sat at the kitchen island, polishing his Red Hood helmet. Roy was plopped comfortably on the sofa in the next room, watching Nascar on the High Definition flat screen TV and shoving popcorn in his face. I really wanted to join him. And waffles would make it so much better! \"How is learning to walk in heels going to help me fight crime?\" I demanded. \"You'd be surprised.\" \"Very helpful, Jason.\" Bruce walked into the kitchen, and stopped to raise a questioning eyebrow at me standing awkwardly in the silver heels. Jason snorted a laugh at his expression, and Bruce gave a small smile of amusement. After the private talk they'd had concerning me becoming a part of the family, Bruce and Jason had eased up around each other, and I'd known it was all going to be okay. Besides, Bruce really liked having me around. He even congratulated me on the whole Batmobile thing and on my \"vast knowledge of cars.\" Also, after Roy told me the history of Bruce and Jason's past issues, it was nice seeing my dad accepting his dad. It kind of influenced me to do the same. But I still had some difficulty calling Jason \"dad\", so I just called him Jason, and he was totally okay with that. \"Thanks so much for throwing a gala in my honor, Bruce.\" I said dryly, \"Best idea ever.\" \"I'm very glad to hear you say that, Alex.\" Bruce smiled, \"How's your 'training' going along?\" \"Working on it.\" I took a couple steady steps forward. Thankfully, these weren't super high stilettoes, so I wouldn't trip and fall and break my leg and end up in a cast for six weeks. But considering my poor skills, it could still happen. I made it to the very front entrance of the manor, stumbling a little here and there, but I was still intact. \"I made it to the front!\" I shouted victoriously back to Jason and Bruce. There was a loud bark from upstairs, followed immediately by the sound of nails scurrying frantically across the mansion floor. Crap. The Great Dane/German Shepherd darted like a bullet down the grand staircase and charged right at me, letting out another excited bark. \"Titus!\" I yelped, and I stumbled backward just as Titus got on his hind feet and rested his giant forepaws on my shoulders. He knocked me down onto my back, his entire weight knocking the wind out of my lungs. \"Holy crap why do you WEIGH so much?! I wheezed, pushing myself into a sitting position. Titus made a gruff noise and wagged his tail before scampering off and running circles around the wide room. \"Thanks, pal!\" I said, kicking the death-trap heels off. \"You're a real help.\" Titus and I got along right from the beginning, when he'd tackled me in the exact same way. Sure, I knew he was Damian Wayne's loyal dog, but it was great knowing I was already best friends with Boy Wonder's mascot without him knowing. And from what everyone's told me about Damian, I just knew he was going to be irritated with me. And I was totally looking forward to that. I got up just as the doorbell rang impatiently, and was about to go and open it when Alfred appeared almost out of nowhere. \"I'll get it, Miss Alex.\" He assured as he walked past me. \"Jeez, how do you always do that, Alfred?\" I bent down to pick my shoes up, \"How do all of you Bats do that? It's starting to creep me out.\" Alfred smiled back at me, \"I'm afraid that's a trick you've yet to learn, Miss Alex.\" The damn annoying doorbell finally stopped ringing, and the doors burst open before Alfred even laid a hand on the knob. Alfred took a slight step back in surprise, and then smiled warmly. \"Good afternoon, Master Damian. So glad to have you back home.\" Well whaddya know. Damian stormed in with a scowl on his face, \"What's this nonsense about Todd having a secret daughter ?\" A leaner, older boy walked in behind him. He narrowed his eyes at Damian in annoyance, \"Remember the phone call, Damian? Bruce said – \" \"I'm well aware of what my father ordered, Drake.\" Damian snorted, rolling his eyes. \"I don't need you to repeat it to me.\" Tim's eyebrow twitched, and I could tell right away that these two were not the best of brothers. I looked to Titus, who'd paused to stand beside me. \"Is it always like this?\" Titus made a gruff noise, and I took it as a confirmation. I grinned, \"Thought so.\" Damian whirled his head to look at me before looking back at Alfred, \"Is that her?\" I snorted. \"Yeah. Todd's secret daughter, in the flesh.\" \"We've heard a lot about you, Alex.\" Tim said with a friendly smile. He held his hand out to shake, and I took it. \"Welcome to the family.\" I grinned, \"Thanks, Drake.\" He raised a brow, \"Do you call everyone by their last name?\" \"Nope.\" His mouth twitched in a wry smile, \"Good to know where we stand.\" Bruce, Jason, and Roy joined the reunion. Bruce looked at his two sons and smiled, \"Looks like you three are off to a good start.\" \"Hold it!\" Damian interrupted, and I heard Jason mutter, \"Here we go,\" behind me. \"Looks like you spoke too soon, Bruce.\" Roy said, stifling a laugh. \"Hey there, little brother.\" I said mockingly, \" I've heard a lot about you .\" \"Do not call me that.\" He threatened. I shrugged, \"It's true. Didn't Bruce tell you that, legally, I'm his newly adopted daughter?\" \"I'm well aware of my father's ridiculous decision,\" Damian said, irritated, \"Just as you should be aware that I've been trained by the League of Assassins. And in case you don't know what that is – \" \"I know what it is!\" I snapped impatiently. Jeez, so much for being able to handle the little twerp. He smirked, satisfied at having had irritated me so quickly. \"At least you have some knowledge of our world. That means you won't be rendered entirely useless to us, Todd .\" I looked to Titus wearily and thumbed to Damian, \"Is he always like this?\" Titus wagged his tail, and I took it as a confirmation. Oh joy.[Chapter 10] First of all, I want to apologize to TheDarkSideOfPercyJackson for not updating sooner! I'm really sorry, especially since you motivate me so much with your comments. You're amazing! Also, imaninja41, thanks for the Nascar inspiration! I'll be putting more of that throughout the story, and Alex will love it :D And yes, Titus is the awesomest! (Unfortunately, I forgot to put him in here, but he'll definitely be in the rest of the story :D ) Huge potter fan, your little comment inspired the Tim, Damian, and Alex stuff I threw in here, so I hope you'll like it! And there's also more about the high heels, which I hope you will also agree with! Ahaha, okay, thanks for reading this guys! :) \"It's not my fault you turn into a crippled every time you walk in heels.\" \"You tripped me!\" \"That is a completely invalid accusation.\" \"Invalid my ass! I saw your foot move the very second before I 'tripped.'\" \"Like I said: an invalid accusation. You know what 'invalid' means, don't you?\" \"I'm bilingual. That means I can speak and understand both Spanish and English. Fluently. Quit being such an ass, Wayne.\" \"I'm multilingual. That means I can speak more languages than you can count on both hands. Fluently. Quit trying to surpass me, Todd.\" \"Why don't you just quit talking ?!\" I exclaimed, throwing my hands up in the air. Tim's voice was muffled by his arm as he held his head in exhausted aggravation, \"Please, please, please make it stop.\" He groaned to the ceiling. Damian snorted, and I turned to look at Tim moping over the kitchen island. \"I don't see why you're complaining, Tim. I'm the one who's in the dress and heels practically waiting for Damian over here to send me to a hospital.\" \"What are you talking about? You can do that perfectly fine on your own.\" Tim looked up at me with a wry smile on his face. \"Finally something we agree on, Drake.\" Damian said satisfactorily. \"Glad to be the subject of your brotherly bonding, guys.\" Dick walked into the kitchen and grinned at all of us, \"Hey! You're all alive!\" \"Are you sure? It feels like I'm in hell.\" Tim contradicted lightly. \"And I was just about to reach for the kitchen knives.\" I put on a disappointed face. \" I'm the one with the paraphernalia here, Todd. You have been warned.\" \"I'm taller than you. You've noticed that, right?\" \"Those heels will only bring you to your doom.\" I raised a brow, \"That's some pretty dark stuff.\" Tim rolled his eyes. He looked to Dick, \"What took you so long?\" \"Billionaire Bruce Wayne's oldest son has to looks his best. Anyway, the guests are all here, you are all suited up, Alex tripped but didn't break any vital limbs – \" \"No thanks to birdbrain over here.\" I added sourly. Damian smiled smugly. \" –Bruce is ready and waiting to deliver his speech, so Alex you're up first.\" Dick thumbed behind him to the door. \"Don't trip.\" \"Wait, where's Jason?\" I frowned. I hadn't seen him in the past couple of hours. Or Roy, for that matter. \"Jason left.\" There must have been something in my expression that made Dick quickly rephrase his answer. \"He left the Manor for a while. He didn't want to hang around the Manor because, you know, he's supposed to be nonexistent. Besides, Jason's always hated galas. With a passion.\" I snorted, but my spiking panic of yet again being abandoned by my d- Jason immediately diminished. \"So what he basically meant was 'no way in hell am I putting on a monkey suit.'\" \"Yeah, that's just about right.\" Dick chuckled. \"That's totally unfair. I thought you guys were all about justice!\" \"Jason's usually the exception.\" Tim commented. \"Well if that's the case, then I won't – \" \"Too late, Bruce is calling you!\" And with that said, Dick ushered me out of the kitchen and out onto the top of the staircase that led down into the front entrance of the manor, which was totally swarming with people. And cameras. Lots and lots of cameras. Gulp. \"And here she is.\" Bruce's voice rang out charmingly to the guests as he rested a hand on my shoulder. \"Everyone: Alejandra Mae Wayne.\" Everyone clapped and there were some accompanying whistles and I couldn't help but glare menacingly at the rapidly flashing cameras. Dick, Tim, and Damian joined us to pose at the top of the staircase, and Dick lightly nudged me as he flashed his winning smirk at the cameras, which started going crazy. \"C'mon, Alex. Give them one teeny tiny smile. You have to make a convincing image, remember?\" \"Isn't that what the dress was for?\" By the way, the one Barbara helped me pick out wasn't that all that bad. It was a soft red (yeah, what a surprise there, huh?), was strapless, and went just below my knees in flowing layers. And Alfred, with his impeccable taste, made me wear the gold heels that had thin straps instead of the silver ones I was totally getting the hang of walking in. My dark hair was slightly curled and hung past my shoulder blades, but I did not wear earrings. I let everyone get me into heels, a dress, my hair out of its usual messed-up ponytail, and even a teeny touch of makeup on my face, but getting holes punched into my ears was where I finally drew the damned line. Dick saw me pouting and he added nonchalantly, \"Would it help if I told you Eddie's here?\" The image of Eddie with his shaggy hair and a tux and a tie had me bursting into almost uncontrollable laughter, and if it weren't because we were in public, I would have rolled down the stairs to land in a heaping pile of wheezing laughter on the floor. \"Why are you laughing ?\" Damian demanded, staring at me like I'd just grown a third eyeball or something. \"Nothing.\" I chuckled. I kept the natural grin on my face as I scanned the mass of people in search of the familiar face that I hadn't seen in a while, but the flashing lights of the cameras pretty much blinded me. \"Her boyfriend's here.\" Tim said to Damian with a smirk. I threw them a quick glare. Damian smirked as well, and all three of those guys really did look like the legitimate sons of Bruce Wayne. Even Jason had a killer smirk. Hmm, I really had to practice that if I wanted to fit in. \"Todd? A boyfriend? It appears that I finally have blackmailing material.\" \"Nate's here, too.\" Dick informed Tim and Damian under his breath. \"And get this, he's best friends with Eddie.\" \"You don't say.\" Tim mused. \"Are you gossiping?\" Bruce finally intervened, turning his head and raising his brows at them. \"It's more of an investigation, father. Confidential.\" \"Oh, shut up.\" I scowled at Damian, \"Eddie is not my boyfriend.\" \"So Nate is the poor, unfortunate soul, then?\" \"Me punching your face would look fantastic on the front page of the Gotham Gazette, don't you think?\" \"You should have it enlarged.\" Tim suggested helpfully. Dick coughed a laugh and shook his head. \"Alejandra, would you like to make a speech for your guests?\" Bruce interrupted our little bickering. I froze as all eyes rested on me, and I swallowed audibly. \"Uhh…well, I want to thank Bruce Wayne for making me a part of his family. I always heard he had a habit of adopting orphans. Like, a lot of orphans,\" There were a few chuckles at that, \"but I never thought I'd be one of them. But I am, so,\" I shrugged and grinned widely at Bruce, \"now he has to deal with it. And so do my brothers here which, by the way, are the greatest guys ever.\" I reached out and heavily mussed Damian's hair with my hand, and everyone laughed heartily and clapped again. Even Bruce cracked a smile. \"Nice.\" Dick approved with his own smile as he clapped. \"It was hardly a speech .\" Damian grumbled, putting a hand on his ruined hair. I grinned at him. Bruce addressed the gala again, \"There you are, ladies and gentlemen. Alejandra Wayne.\" There were more claps and flashing cameras. \"Welcome to the family.\" Bruce said warmly. 'Thanks. Gramps.\" I smiled wryly. Everyone dispersed and began chatting and laughing and the music filled the whole manor, and I continued my search for Eddie and Nate. I spotted the back of Nate's dark blond head first, and I tried not to get past all the people who threw a few congrats and welcomes my way. I smiled and nodded my head at all of them and returned a comment or whatever, and I finally reached Nate, grabbing his arm with a grin. \"Nate!\" He turned around in surprise and grinned when he saw me, \"Alex! I haven't seen you since, you know, you escaped from the youth's home.\" He smiled wryly, \"Madeline says hi.\" I chuckled sheepishly, \"Let her know I returned the greeting.\" \"Dick invited me, I hope that's okay.\" Nate handed me a cup, \"You want some?\" I raised a brow as I peeked into the cup, \"Water?\" \"It's refreshing.\" He assured teasingly. I shrugged and accepted the water, \"Can't argue with that.\" \"Really? Heels? Wait, what's that on your face? Holy – is that makeup ?\" I spluttered and choked on my water, turning to gawk at Eddie standing beside Nate. My retort got caught in my throat as I broke into choking laughter at the sight of him, \"You got a - Ahahaha! You got a haircut !\" \"Hey, it's better than everything you've done to it.\" Eddie teased, running a hand through his short, tousled hair. \"Dick paid. And I kinda like it.\" \"It really brings out your eyes.\" Nate approved dryly. \"Aw shucks.\" I snorted, \"Do you guys need me to leave?\" \"Oh no you don't.\" Eddie pointed accusingly at me, \"You abandoned me for over two days. We need to make up for lost time, Miss Wayne .\" He suddenly smiled, his dark eyes laughing. Yeah, okay, I missed that face. Nate coughed into his fist and he started moving away, \"I'll leave you two alone.\" I was confused. \"Nate, where are you – ?\" Eddie took my hand and before I knew it, he'd pulled me out onto the middle of the room. For a dance. Oh crap oh crap oh crap. I tried to scramble away, but Eddie's free hand rested on my waist and he pulled me closer, smoothly moving us further into the crowd of swaying couples. \"What the hell! Dammit, Eddie! You know I can't dance !\" I looked around in paranoia, expecting people to start laughing and pointing at me at any moment. This was totally going to ruin my 'perfect' façade of a Wayne. How embarrassing. \"Yeah, well I can .\" Eddie smiled as he gently moved us into the rhythm of the music. \"So? I don't – \" I stopped and turned to look at him with a raised brow, \"Wait. Since when do you know how to dance?\" \"Well, after Dick told me Bruce Wayne adopted you, he said it was a good idea that I start learning how to dance. Now I know why.\" He looked around at the extravagantness of everything and nodded. \"Thankfully, Carina was free, so she was the one who – \" I jerked away from him, \" What ! You danced with Carina ?\" He sighed, \"Will you please calm down? You'll trip or something.\" I scowled, but let him continue. \"Like I was saying, it was just her way of thanking me for helping her out with her brother last time.\" I rolled my eyes at him, \"Oh yeah, giving you dance lessons is a real thank-you, isn't it?\" Eddie laughed, \"Jealous, are we?\" \"Don't flatter yourself, lover boy.\" \"Sorry. It's the new haircut talking. Plus, your new look is making me nervous.\" He paused and his expression gentled, \"In the good way, though.\" I ignored the sudden pounding of my heart and said sarcastically, \"Hey, wasn't my bright idea. And this is not my new look. My closet has jeans, t-shirts, sweats, sneakers, and the embarrassing number of dresses I was forced to get will forever remain a mystery, okay?\" He chuckled, but it rang with relief. Even his posture relaxed a little. I guess he'd thought I'd changed overnight or something. I was really glad I didn't, too. \"Not bad.\" I finally said, impressed. \"Carina's a good teacher.\" \"I missed you.\" He said softly, \"A lot.\" I choked on a step and somehow tripped over my own ankle, totally ruining the graceful atmosphere he'd created for us. Eddie laughed as he firmly steadied me, \"Really? You couldn't just wear flats?\" \"Like I said, it wasn't my genius idea.\" I mumbled, flustered. \"At least you gained an inch.\" He piped up. I grinned, \"But you're still freakishly taller than I am. Just like Dick and J- Tim. They're almost over six feet, like you.\" Phew. Close call. Speaking of Dick, I spotted him and Bruce talking, wearing equally serious expressions on their faces. Tim casually passed by them, and Bruce uttered something short to him before disappearing into one of the hallways. Dick nodded to Tim, and they walked off in opposite directions. Interesting. \"And what are you, short stuff? Like five foot five? Five foot six , counting the death traps you're wearing on your feet.\" \"Yeah, they're killing me!\" I blurted, and silently scolded myself for sounding so obviously weird. C'mon, Alex, act natural! Be a Bat! \"Uh, I think I'm gonna go change into a cozy pair of sneakers.\" I pulled away from Eddie's embrace and backed away, thumbing to the staircase, \"It'll only take a second, I'll be back!\" I turned and accidentally slammed into Nate. He steadied me as I tipped off balance, \"Whoa, are you okay?\" \"I'm great!\" I craned my neck to the staircase to see Damian smoothly striding up the steps, undoing his bowtie. Oh yeah, something was definitely going on tonight. And there was no way I was gonna be left out of it. Nate rubbed the back of his head a bit nervously, \"Okay, I was just going to ask if you would like to dance with me– \" \"Ah, I can't! I mean, I would like to, but I have to go change into something that won't send me to a hospital,\" I pointed down at my heels, \"I hope that's okay? I'll be back! You two, uh, keep each other company!\" I rushed past Nate and made my way to the staircase. That was when I discovered I could sprint in heels, but I couldn't even walk in them. Seriously, where was the logic in that? I did a quick perimeter check, but there was no sign of Bruce, Dick, Tim, or Damian. They'd just vanished. Unless… I strode into the den where the grandfather clock was and turned the hands on it to the correct time, grinning triumphantly when it slid aside to let me into the manor's inner sanctum. The Batcave. I kicked my heels off and threw them into a corner of the den before making my way down the stairs. Bruce had already given me a tour and showed me every nook and cranny of the Cave, and believe me when I say it was full of clichés. Revolving walls, secret levers, hidden buttons, you name it. It was insanely awesome. I reached the cool floor and saw the Batmobile was gone. Dammit, I'd just missed them. Sighing, I walked along the deserted Cave, and slowed to a stop in front of the glass case. I knew the whole story. Dick had told it to me, then Tim did, Damian had shared his own thoughts, and Bruce had narrated every detail from his point of view. But I hadn't had the chance to ask the most important person of all: Jason. Maybe, though, I didn't need to. Maybe he'd already told me, somehow, before the whole car incident and wiping my memory thing, which would explain why I hadn't been surprised when everyone told me. If anything, I felt pride, admiration, sadness, and anger all over again. I gazed at the Robin suit, imagining a younger Jason in it, and then I imagined him with a younger version of my mom. I couldn't help but grin at that. \"Pardon my interruption, Miss Alex.\" I nearly flew out of my skin. I whirled around and practically shouted out the top of my lungs, \"Holy – you scared the crap out of me, Alfred!\" Alfred's cool composure didn't change, \"I apologize again, Miss Alex, and please try not to awaken the bats.\" \"Right. Sorry.\" I glanced a peek up at the dozens of house pets and saw them settling down again after my short outburst. \"I noticed your absence from the two gentlemen Eddie and Nate, and assumed you had come down here.\" He smiled knowingly, \"I believe you wanted to join in the real action, am I correct, Miss Alex?\" \"You are correct, Sir Alfred.\" I grinned, then glanced back at Jason's small memorial. Alfred cleared his throat and said gently, \"You know, Miss Alex, I am known to be very handy when it comes to repairing or altering a suit. And I'm not just referring to tuxedos.\" There was a pause, then: \"Alfred, are you saying what I think you're saying?\" \"I believe so, Miss Alex. May I recommend having a touch of red on it? As a symbol of who you are, what you stand for.\" \"To tell you the truth, Alfred, I've been tossing a name around in my head from the very moment I stepped into this giant piece of Gothic architecture.\" His eyes twinkled, \"Might I hear it?\" \"This? This right here?\" I gestured to the Batcave with my arms spread out, \"This is my beginning. And the best symbol I could come up with to stand for that, was dawn.\" \"Very nice, Miss Alex.\" \"I'm not done yet, Alfred.\" \"Please, continue.\" I smiled at him before facing the glass case again. \"And as for who I am? A touch of red would be perfect.\" \" Red Dawn, then, Miss Alex?\" \"Red Dawn it is, Sir Alfred.\"[Chapter 11] Sooooooooooooooo sorry that I've neglected this for so long. Too long. I tend to get very lazy. Anyway, here's the next chapter! :D Gotham City Docks. 10:15 PM \"There've been a lot of shipments going on lately. More so than usual.\" Nightwing commented. He finished tying up his round of unconscious goons and tossed them to the side. \"Think it's some kind of distraction?\" Red Robin asked, leaning against a giant empty crate, \"To throw us off whatever the real plan is?\" \"Pretty much. All we have to do is figure out what that plan is exactly, and who the one hiding behind all this is.\" Nightwing threw a smile his way, \"Shouldn't be too much of a challenge for you, right?\" \"Piece of cake.\" Damian suddenly radioed in, \"Nightwing. Father and I just returned to the Manor. There is no sign of Todd's daughter anywhere.\" \"She's probably just with Eddie.\" Red Robin suggested, \"Or Nate. Or both.\" Nightwing smirked. \"Did you not hear a word of what I just said, Drake?\" Damian said irritably, \"I told you there's no sign of Todd junior anywhere. That clearly implies that I've interrogated both of her suitors, and found it's been approximately an hour since either of them last saw her. It would suit you well to pay attention, Drake .\" Tim had been closing his eyes and holding his folded hands patiently up to his mouth. When Damian finished, he let out a heavy sigh and gave Dick a grim 'please shoot me' look before putting his cowl on again. Nightwing smiled and addressed Damian, \"What else did Eddie and Nate tell you?\" \"That she left in a rush. I hadn't assumed Todd would have any plans of her own.\" Damian snorted. Nightwing pulled out his grappling hook, \"Tell Bruce we're finished cleaning up here. We'll be on the lookout for Alex.\" \"Fine.\" He radioed out, and Red Robin raised a questioning brow at Nightwing, \"Is it just me, or has he been more irritating than usual lately?\" \"Actually, I've noticed that, too.\" The two of them launched their grappling hooks and swung off the docks. They landed on top of an abandoned warehouse and continued walking. Nightwing looked thoughtful, \"I'm guessing he's just feeling a little…annoyed at the idea of having a new member in the family.\" \"That makes sense, considering you're the only one out of all of us he actually gets along with.\" Nightwing chuckled, \"I'm pretty sure that's common among all siblings, even the ordinary ones.\" \"Yeah well, we're anything but ordinary.\" Red Robin joked. \"You said it.\" They continued to walk in peaceful silence. Red Robin raised a brow at Nightwing, \"You know Jason's going to flip when he finds out we lost his kid.\" \"Relax. I've been tracking Alex all over Gotham for the past five years. Just follow the sound of chaos and she'll be there.\" Silence. \"I don't hear anything.\" Red Robin finally said. \"I know. Stop freaking me out.\" They swung off into the night. 0o0o0o0o Alejandra's POV Could anyone feel more badass than this ? I stood on the rooftop of some random, faded building. The view of the nighttime polluted city was breathtaking, and the warm breeze blew back my now-back-to-normal-and-loose-hair. For my own sake, I hoped I looked as awesome and dramatically cool as I felt. Otherwise, this would end up just as embarrassing as wearing the high heels. Alfred said the suit was a \"rough sketch\", and that he'd probably be making some appropriate alterations to it in the future, but I loved it. It was pretty much a replica of Jason's suit [red hood and the outlaws design] in terms of protection, but Alfred had given it a touch of my own taste. For starters, it was a darker gray for better camouflage and was streaked with a fine line of red down the sides of my arms, torso, legs, and my motorcycle boots had red laces. I wore the traditional Bat costume gauntlets, my cowl was red, and the Bat symbol on the front was a rich red that stood out really well. Alfred had made sure that I really wanted to wear the logo, that I was willing to be responsible enough to wear it, to carry the burden and all that serious stuff blah blah blah. I understood every bit of what he was telling me, and I accepted it all. I chose this costume because I knew that no matter how dangerously close to the line I would be pushed to, I wouldn't cross it. Sure, Jason was pretty much perfectly balanced between that fragile line of justice and injustice, but that wasn't something everyone could handle as easily and well as Jason, and Roy. I knew for a fact that I couldn't do that without causing some serious damage, so I'll be sticking to one side of the line, just to play it safe. I chose this costume because whenever I do something right, it'll be traced back to Batman and any and everyone who bears the meaning of this symbol…including Jason. Because this was basically his costume, too, and every time I do something right, it'll be traced back to him . I'll be secretly clearing his name, whether anyone realizes it or not. This costume was already tarnished, and it's my silent duty as his daughter to fix it, to give him a new beginning, too. Thus, Red Dawn was born. Grinning at my own cheesiness, I pulled out my grappling hook and headed out for the streets of Gotham. And yeah, I remembered our deal: I wasn't allowed out onto the \"playing field\", as Roy had put it, until Jason felt I was ready to handle everything Gotham would throw at me. But haven't I been doing that my whole life already? Besides, all of my old training came easily to me. I hadn't even known I knew how to use a grappling hook and swing through the air! I may not remember anything from my life with Jason because of the whole wiping my memory and stuff, but the training? For some reason, that stuck with me this whole time. I was so going to get grounded when I got back home. 0o0o0o0o Wayne Manor. 10:26 PM Eddie undid his tie as he and Nate walked out past the gates of the Manor, where the party was still going on. \"So, what did you think?\" Nate asked. \"I think,\" Eddie crumpled his tie and stuffed it in his pants pocket. He shrugged the jacket of the tux off and draped it over his shoulder, \"that I don't like wearing fancy suits.\" Nate grinned, \"All of the ladies back there seemed to like it.\" \"Well, we did look pretty sharp. And my haircut gave me bonus points. Even though Alex laughed at it.\" He chuckled. \"She looked pretty happy to see you.\" Nate had seen the ways Alex's eyes shone every time she was around Eddie, and he remembered how she'd turned him down for a dance. The truth was, he'd always had a \"small\" crush on Alex since Elementary. But there was no way he'd ever tell her, or do anything to try to get her to like him back. Not when he knew that Eddie liked Alex. A lot. The day Eddie had confessed it to him about a year ago, after the whole thing with Carina, Nate had given up all hopes of ever being something other than a friend to Alex. He didn't want to mess anything up for the guy who was practically his brother. He wanted Eddie to be happy with Alex, and Nate knew Alex would be happy with Eddie. He would just remain their friend, and Nate was perfectly okay with that. \"Yeah. I missed her.\" Eddie admitted a bit sheepishly, \"I'm not used to not having her around. It's weird. But peaceful at the same time.\" He grinned mockingly. \"I think I even regained some of my hearing in my right ear.\" \"That's good to hear.\" They both laughed. \"But I guess I won't be seeing her as often anymore.\" Eddie said thoughtfully, \"She has a family now. A pretty big one, at that.\" He shook his head, impressed, \"The Waynes, huh?\" \"Yeah.\" Nate agreed, \"Doesn't that mean she and Dick are family now?\" Eddie barked a laugh, \"It does! That must be entertaining. And nice. Alex always saw Dick as a dad, or something close to that. I did, too.\" \"Her little brother is kind of intimidating, though.\" Nate added wryly. Eddie grinned, \"I think he's adorable . What did he call us again? Alex's 'suitors', right?\" He laughed. \"The way he was interrogating us made me feel like I was an accomplice in a crime or something.\" Nate joked. \"Where do you think Alex disappeared to?\" Eddie finally asked after a pause. \"I have no idea.\" Nate answered honestly. \"Now that I think about it, didn't the whole family vanish from the party right before Alex ran off?\" Eddie frowned as he started to put the clues together. \"I don't remember seeing any of them for a while after that, until Bruce Wayne and Damian reappeared a while ago.\" \"The whole place was crowded with a lot of people. Maybe you just didn't see them walking around?\" Nate suggested. Eddie shook his head, \"I don't know. Maybe. But it's kind of strange, isn't it?\" They made it onto the Robert Kane Memorial Bridge and crossed it back onto the Island. \"And how Alex was in a rush? Just to change her shoes? It doesn't take someone over an hour to change into a pair of sneakers.\" Eddie snorted. \"Then she just vanished like the rest of them. Tell me that's not suspicious.\" \"You've always had an eye for these things, Eddie.\" Nate said, somewhat impressed. \"I didn't even notice any of that until you mentioned it.\" \"I picked it up from Alex.\" Eddie said, giving in to a small smirk. \"Now I get to use her own skills against her.\" They continued walking into the city, and just as they were about to make a turn around a corner, someone leaped out and snagged Nate, putting him in a chokehold and holding a gun to his head. \"Don't move!\" Eddie froze mid-step, and turned around to see a grim-looking Nate held in place by a masked thug. Eddie held his hands up calmly, \"Okay. Fine. But I gotta tell you, we're broke poor. I built my own mansion out of cardboard.\" The masked man snickered, \"Yeah right, punk. Your fancy suits say otherwise. Search him!\" Eddie sensed someone creeping up from behind him, and he spun around to smash his elbow into the side of the second guy's face, knocking him down. Eddie ducked just as a bullet from Nate's captor whizzed over his head, and he turned around in alarm. A small flash of red suddenly caught his eye, and another shot went off, but it missed him and hit the brick wall instead. Eddie watched with wide eyes as a dark figure landed in a silent crouch between him and the thug still keeping Nate in a chokehold. \"Who the hell are you?\" The thug demanded, his own eyes widening, but with fear. He pointed the gun at the figure – a girl , Eddie realized. Instead of replying, she swiftly straightened up from her crouch and flipped into the air, dodging the bullets he fired frantically up at her, and landed behind him. She jammed her elbow into the back of his neck, causing him to yelp and drop the gun. Nate stumbled free, and the girl roughly kicked the thug forward and bent his elbow at a painfully awkward position behind his back, causing him to shout. She pulled a pair of batcuffs out from her utility belt and swiftly cuffed him to the streetlight pole. And she'd it all in four seconds flat. Both Eddie and Nate gawked. Hearing a grunt and a click behind them, all three teens turned around to see the second thug had recovered and was ready to shoot at the mysterious vigilante. She quickly placed her forearm up in front of her face, and the bullet bounced right off her gauntlet. There was a beat of silence, and then she smirked at the thug. She lunged and rammed him back into the brick wall, knocking him unconscious and letting him sink to the ground. \"Wow.\" Nate finally said, blinking in stunned surprise. \"Uh, thanks.\" She gave him a small smile and proceeded to cuff the unconscious thug. Eddie studied the vigilante hard. She seemed very familiar… \"What did you say your name was?\" Eddie questioned. The girl straightened up and turned to face him and Nate. They both saw the bat symbol on her costume, and turned slightly surprised. \"Red Dawn.\" They blinked, and she was gone. \"Holy shit.\" Eddie finally said, staring after her.[Chapter 12] Thanks so much for the comments/reviews so far! =D Because of them, here's the next chapter! And just because I feel like I'm always taking too long to upload this story, I tried to make this chapter a sort of lengthy one : ) That was close. Way too close. For all I knew, Eddie could've already figured out who Red Dawn was! And if Eddie actually did figure that out, then I basically gave away my whole family's deepest, darkest, sure-to-get-us-all-locked-up-in-Arkham-Asylum secret. \"I'm going to get grounded for sure.\" I groaned into my hands, \"Probably for the rest of my lifetime .\" I paused, then added to the gloomy sky, \"If Bruce is feeling merciful enough.\" But then again, Eddie was my best friend. He wouldn't babble it to the whole world like an idiot. He would confront me about it first. Which was still bad, but at least I would be able to handle it. I watched from my spot in the fire escape as two police cars pulled over to check out my work. Eddie and Nate had left about a minute after I'd taken off, but I'd waited just to make sure they'd left safely. Okay fine. Truth was I didn't want to go back home. At least not while that stupid gala was still going on. No way was I getting back in those heels. Plus, I was pretty sure that my absence had been noticed quite some time ago. Alfred gave me his word that he wouldn't rat me out to Bruce or any of them, but it didn't ease my paranoia. The world's greatest detective was my grandpa for crying out loud. I was expecting him to pop out of nowhere and scare the pants off me like he did pretty much all the time. It was nerve-wracking. I pressed my fingers to my cowl and watched Batman's files pull up in my lenses. Straight from the Bat Computer. Let me tell you, connecting this to the program from the Bat Computer was not easy. Sure I've hacked into tech before, but the Bat Computer was something else entirely. Dick's lessons had never gotten to the point of hardcore technology. Yet. Lucky for me, Alfred had caught me red-handed and just gave me the password. He really was too awesome. I sifted through some of it before coming to the file I'd found before spotting Eddie and Nate in their little sticky situation. It was something about the Riddler doing his whole Riddler thing and making the cops figure out his next move. According to Batman, he was going to take the new Van Gogh paintings that had recently been placed in the museum. Hey, I knew about Van Gogh! He was one of my favorite artists. How does a street rat like me know about Van Gogh you ask? It was just one of those trivial things I picked up along the way. Goya was one of my favorites, too. Anyway, I could probably catch Riddler in no time. He didn't seem too dangerous for Red Dawn to handle. Grinning in determination, I flipped myself up the rusted railings and made a move for the museum. 0o0o0o0o \"What do you mean she disappeared ?\" Jason demanded, \"I thought you guys were gonna watch her!\" \"We were.\" Dick explained, \"But, we had to leave to intervene in a weapon shipment. Two were taking place at one time in distinct locations, which is obviously – \" \"I don't care.\" Jason interrupted with a roll of his eyes, \"If Alex isn't at the Manor, then shouldn't she be with the Santos kid and Nate?\" \"They left the gala about half an hour ago, according to Damian. She wasn't with them.\" \"Huh. I don't know if I should be glad or upset to hear that.\" Jason muttered under his breath as he rubbed the back of his neck. \"Spoken like a true parent.\" Roy piped up with a grin. \"Wouldn't want your teenage daughter hanging around at night with a pair of sixteen-year-old boys, eh?\" \"Shut up, Harper. This is serious.\" Tim gazed down at the ground thoughtfully before looking up with raised brows, \"I'm willing to bet Alfred knows something.\" All four of them shared a look. Jason looked to Tim and Dick with a frown, \"Did Damian say anything about whether Alfred saw her leave?\" \"I don't think he asked.\" Dick admitted. Jason snorted, \"Well that was dumb. Alfred always knows everything.\" Batman suddenly radioed in on them, \"She's going to stop Riddler at the Museum.\" \"And why am I not surprised?\" Jason gestured in exasperation. Dick raised his eyebrows, \"Alex donned a costume?\" \"An interesting one, and well equipped. With Alfred's help, I'm sure. Robin and I are already on our way there.\" \"Don't bother.\" Jason said, appearing slightly annoyed. \"Alex is my daughter, I'll handle it.\" Batman's tone was firm on the line. \"I need to make sure she's doing the job right . She's using the 'family logo.' We can't afford to have her – \" \"Acting like I did ?\" Jason grounded out, \"Past tense, Bruce. Past. Tense.\" There was an awkward silence after that, and Roy leaned over and whispered to Dick, \"You can just hear the Bat-glare.\" Roy then quirked a brow, \"I thought they worked it out?\" He muttered to Dick and Tim, referring to Jason and Bruce. \"It's never really permanent.\" Tim replied a bit solemnly. \"Uh, Bruce?\" Dick intervened in the commlink, \"We're all going. We'll meet you there.\" The link ended, and Jason frowned at the ground one last time before heading off the docks and snorting. \"He's totally going to ground her.\" 0o0o0o0o The museum was quiet, and by the time I got there, the Bat Signal was already splayed across the gloomy gray clouds in the sky. That meant the oh so famous Batman and Robin were going to show up any minute, meaning I had to work fast. I jumped off the gargoyle I was perched on and began falling forward towards the glass windows of the museum. There was no time for picking fancy locks, I was going in with style! Laughing at the sheer adrenaline of it all, I somersaulted mid-air and lightly landed on the edge of a rooftop before rolling off the balls of my feet and continuing spinning downward. I held my arms in and put my feet forward and easily crashed through the glass. I kicked a guy down, landed on his chest, immediately kicked off him and spun in a circle in the air, kicking two approaching Riddler goons away before leaping to the side safely and landing with a laugh. Man, this was a breeze. Some goon cried out, \"Batman?!\" Pffft. Where did Riddler find these guys anyway? I straightened up, \"Yeah, you know, I just shrank a couple of feet. Grew my hair out. Glad you noticed.\" I stepped to the side, dodging a shouting, charging goon. I reached out and grabbed him by the back of his shirt and flung him into the goon that for some strange reason had thought I was the goddamn Batman, knocking them both hard onto the ground. \"Who are you?\" Riddler asked, taking a wary step back. I smiled, \"I want to say: your worst nightmare , but I'm not. It's Batman. And, fortunately for you, I'm no Batman. But your genius co-worker over there knew that already, huh?\" His expression immediately turned annoyed, and he sharply pointed his question mark cane thing at me, \"Get her!\" A goon stepped in front of Riddler and began shooting arrows from his crossbow at me. I flipped over them as I made my way to him, and grabbed the last arrow he'd shot up at me. Grinning, I let the arrow fall and snatched the crossbow out of his hands and kicked my foot against his chest, felling him to the floor. \"Hey, that's Starry Night !\" I pointed at the painting that had been dropped to the floor, \"And is that the Night Café beneath it? Nice choice. Color is everything for Van Gogh. Speaking of colors, riddle me this:\" I grinned tauntingly at him, \"What's green and purple and covered in red and gray?\" Riddler scowled and turned to run towards the exit, and I sprinted right after him. One of the remaining goons ran at me and shot out his whip just as I leaped over him. It snared around my ankle, but I pulled out a batarang and sliced the cord before it could pull taught. I swiftly moved my legs forward and flattened Riddler face-first onto the floor. I snickered and ended my riddle, \"You! When I land on your sorry butt!\" Laughter erupted from somewhere within the dark museum, and I looked up in surprise to see Red Hood and Arsenal stepping out from the shadows beneath the staircase. Arsenal was grinning in pure delight, and Red Hood was – well, he was wearing his Red Hood. Just as I opened my mouth to give Jason a probably dumb and totally useless explanation in a futile attempt to save myself from an eternal grounding for breaking the 'no-crime-fighting-until-I-say-you're-ready' deal without a moment's hesitation, Batman appeared. Woo-hoo. I was already slouching sullenly by the time Robin, Nightwing, and Red Robin stepped out from their own hiding places. I raised a brow at them, \"Wow. So you guys were hiding in the shadows this whole time? I should've known.\" \"It's what we do,\" said Red Robin with a smile. \"What is this, some sort of family reunion?\" Riddler demanded, but he'd stopped struggling the moment Batman had shown up. \"I'll handle it from here,\" said Batman, and I stepped off Riddler as Batman cuffed his wrists together. \"You're welcome,\" I hinted. He ignored me and swiftly proceeded with the unconscious goons. I sighed. So much for getting praised. Robin walked up and eyed me distastefully, \"You certainly know how to handle the situation gracefully, Red Dawn .\" \"You figured it out, huh?\" I said, ignoring his sarcastic edge to his tone. He smiled smugly, \"Son. Of. Batman.\" I gawked at him, \"You mean the son of Satan is my brother ? That's it.\" I raised my hands in the air, \"Time out.\" Robin rolled his eyes at me, \"Your sense of humor is as good as your fighting, Red Dawn.\" \"I'll take that as a compliment, Robin.\" \"I'd prefer you take it as sarcasm.\" Before I could come up with a sharp retort or just punch him in the face, Nightwing stepped in, putting some space between us. He shook his head with some amusement and exasperation. \"It'll take a true miracle for you two to ever get along, won't it?\" Robin and I scoffed at the same time, \"Not even that.\" We stopped, then narrowed our eyes at each other. \"Alex?\" I tore away from Robin's and my glaring contest to look a bit nervously at Nightwing. He had that pensive look of his on his face, the one he'd usually give me whenever he was deciding if something I'd done was right or wrong. At the moment, even I wasn't so sure. Frankly, I was still waiting for either Jason or Bruce to ground me. But neither one seemed to be paying much attention to me at the moment. In fact, it sort of looked like they were having a pretty heated discussion… \"You did good.\" I blinked in surprise as Nightwing's words abruptly jerked me out of my thoughts. He cracked a grin at me, \"Just know that you have my approval with all this. Okay, Red Dawn?\" \"Are you serious?\" I gaped, feeling some small shred of hope. I grinned, \"Thanks, Nightwing. Really.\" \"Hey, doesn't my approval count, too?\" Arsenal walked over to us and wrapped an arm around my shoulders, \"Because, I have to admit, I'm proud that you still remember how to kick ass. This is just like the good old days! Except Claudia wouldn't let you do any serious crime fighting since, you know, you were pretty small.\" He ruffled my hair and his grin broadened, \"I'm proud of you, Red Dawn. Great name by the way. Really liking the connection.\" I laughed as I wrestled my way out of his hold and playfully punched his shoulder. \"I'm glad to hear that.\" \"I have a feeling my opinion doesn't really matter to you,\" Red Robin began, also joining our little group. I gave him a mocking glance, \"No, not really.\" He smiled before continuing, \"Right. But, from what I saw just a few moments ago…you did do good. Better than I expected, actually, since I expected…something else. So, nice job, Red Dawn.\" Wow. Three praises so far! I was definitely starting to feel better than I had two minutes ago. I smiled warmly, \"Gracias, hermano.\" \"Did you just thank me? And called me your brother ? All in one sentence? That's it.\" He raised his hands mockingly, \"Time out.\" \"Don't get used to it,\" I punched his arm, \" Drake .\" I smirked and he chuckled as he rubbed his shoulder. \"Don't you dare do it.\" Red Hood suddenly snapped, and we all turned around in surprise to look at him. Batman's face was expressionless as he stared back at Red Hood, whose gloved hands were clenched into tight fists down at his sides. Something twisted in my stomach uneasily. I knew they were talking about me. More specifically, Red Dawn. Gulp. I was really in for it now. Nightwing swiftly approached Batman and Red Hood and frowned at them, \"What's going on?\" \"Go ahead. Tell him.\" Red Hood challenged Batman, \"Nightwing always knows what's right and wrong, don't you, Golden Boy?\" Red Hood immediately looked to Nightwing, \"Be the judge here and tell him what he wants to do is sick and wrong .\" I couldn't help but cringe at the harshness of his tone. Something warned me that this was going to get really, really ugly. Batman ignored Red Hood and Nightwing and instead turned to look directly at me. I refused to let it unnerve me and instead glared right back, sending my own unspoken challenge at him. I could take it, whatever it was. Batman pulled Riddler out from the heap of still unconscious goons and silently led him over to me. Although I didn't let it show, I was definitely confused. Uhhhhh…What exactly was it that he was going to do - ? Batman's voice was so low I practically had to strain to hear the next words that he uttered. \"What would you do if I told you that this man is partly responsible for the crash that took your mother away from you?\" There was a dead silence. And then one of the millions of lost fragments of my memory slammed into me like I'd been flattened by a speeding truck. \" Mom, where are we going?\" \" To the hospital.\" She looked really worried. I never liked seeing her worried, or scared. It terrified me, because my mom was always strong. \" Why?\" My voice shook a little. I tried to be strong. Strong like my mom. \" Do you remember my friend? Seth Levitt?\" I nodded. \"He had an accident. He's alive but, he's my best friend and I need to make sure he's okay.\" I nodded again. \"He's going to be okay, mom.\" I reassured her, trying to make her worry less. Her soothing brown eyes looked at my own dark green ones in the rearview mirror. She smiled, that warm, tender smile that would always turn into a grin for me. I smiled back at her. \" What would I do without you, Alex?\" She would still be strong. Her smile suddenly dropped and she frowned at the mirror. \"We're being followed.\" Fear shot through me. I suddenly wanted dad with us, or uncle Roy or uncle Dick. \"Mom? What time is dad com-\" The memory abruptly broke off and the rest of it was randomly scattered images of the crash that played like a freaking movie in my eyes, with the IMAX experience and everything. Could the others even see it?! \"Alex,\" Jason's grip on my shoulders was firm, \"Alex look at me.\" I did, and the flashing images in my mind came to an immediate halt. I blinked again, and was dumbstruck when I realized I was crying . \"What the hell is wrong with you?\" Jason snarled, whirling around furiously at Bruce. \"You – \" \"What do you expect me to do?\" I interrupted, staring at Batman and swiping away the tears that had slipped past my cowl. It didn't even take me a second to realize what he was really doing. And it seriously pissed me off. I snatched one of Jason's guns from his belt and clicked it, aiming the barrel directly at the Riddler, who was still out cold. \"Alex!\" Nightwing's eyes widened in shock and alarm. Batman's eyes narrowed into slits. I sensed everyone else's silent surprise from behind me. \"This is what you were expecting from me, right?\" I demanded, marching right up to the guy who was clearly an entirely different side of human being Bruce Wayne. \"You thought I was going to snap and have a violent outburst or go on some killing rampage or something!\" I tossed the gun at him, and he caught it numbly in his hands. \"Well it looks like I passed your stupid test. I'm not a threat to your precious reputation, nor anyone else's. Basically, I'm not the kind of person Jason used to be. Because that's what you're afraid of, right?\" No one said anything, and I continued on a furious roll, \"I caught the Riddler and, in case you're still doubting me, he's not dead, he's just conked out! So go ahead and tell Commissioner Gordon that the Bat Family has a new, not revenge-filled member who's going to make the hellhole Gotham City more tolerable for others to live in, and her name is now and always will be Red Dawn.\" I roughly shoved past him and stomped towards the exit. Clenching my fists, I spun around again and let my tone drip heavy with sarcasm, \"And by the way, thanks for telling me about Riddler. You laid it on me real nice and easy. I can't wait for you to tell me who the real mastermind behind my mother's murder was, Batman .\" I turned back around and made the show of slamming the heavy door behind me with full force. 0o0o0o0o Troubled Youths' Home. 11:53 PM \"Good thing those guys didn't take my chocolate.\" Eddie said, taking the wrapper off. \"Being worthy enough to be served at Bruce Wayne's gala must mean it's amazing.\" He took a bite and grinned, \"Holy crap, it is!\" Nate was lying in his bed, arms behind his head as he gazed up at the ceiling. \"You're quieter than usual.\" Eddie observed, munching on his chocolate. \"What's on your mind, hermano?\" \"Who do you think that girl was?\" asked Nate after a curious pause. Eddie froze and started choking on his chocolate bar. Nate paid no attention to him, \"I mean, it's obvious that she's running with the Bat Family, but I've never seen her before now.\" Eddie coughed one last time before swallowing painfully. He put the chocolate aside and rubbed the back of his neck, \"Beats me. New member, I guess.\" Nate propped himself on his elbow and looked to Eddie sitting across the room in his own bed. \"You're not even a little curious? That's unusual for you.\" Eddie shrugged, \"She saved our butts. She's a heroine. That's good enough for me.\" \"Well, yeah, I guess you're right.\" Nate settled back down, \"It's just, now that I look back on it, there's something about her that seems kind of familiar.\" He stopped and glanced at Eddie, \"Do you sense that, too? Or is it just me being weird?\" \"You're crushing on her, aren't you, lover boy?\" Eddie taunted with a sly grin on his face. \"What?\" Nate looked surprised, then embarrassed. His eyes darted around nervously, \"I'm not crushing on anyone!\" The doorbell rang, and Nate and Eddie shared a surprised look. \"Isn't Madeline visiting little Dylan and Cole at the hospital?\" Eddie asked. Nate nodded. \"Should we go answer it? Maybe Madeline forgot the keys.\" Eddie hopped out of bed, and Nate got up to follow. Nate leaped down two steps at a time and Eddie just slid down the banister with an easy grin. He jumped off at the end and jogged to the door as the doorbell rang more frantically and the person started pounding on the door. \"All right all right, calm – \" Eddie swung the door open, and froze in surprise to see Alex standing on the porch in jeans and her trademark red hoodie drooping over her head. \"Alex?\" She blinked at him in equal shock, \"Eddie?\" \"What are you doing here?\" They both said simultaneously. \"Dick transferred me here the same day you got adopted.\" Eddie explained. He looked at her closely and his expression gentled, \"Hey. Are you okay?\" \"Alex?\" Nate turned equally concerned as Eddie at seeing her. \"What's wrong?\" Alex let out a heavy sigh and glanced back at the street behind her before looking to the guys again. She looked tired. Eddie immediately knew she'd been crying. \"Family problems. Will it be okay with Madeline if I spend the night here? Or forever? I'm cool with either one.\" She joked weakly. \"She's not here.\" Nate said, \"But I know she wouldn't mind letting you stay. Your old room is still empty, if you want to sleep there.\" \"I'll be fine on the den's floor. Much more comfortable.\" She smiled, but Eddie just knew she wasn't feeling fine at all. He sighed and pulled her inside and into his arms, \"Come here, you. You need a group hug.\" Eddie smiled and nodded for Nate to join them. Nate did, and the three of them stood there for a little while. \"Nate?\" Alex asked as she finally pulled away. Her eyes were still a bit red and puffy. \"I know this is a random question, but…does your last name happen to be Levitt?\" Nate looked slightly taken aback, but he nodded, \"Yeah. My parents were Seth and Clara Levitt.\" His brows pulled together questioningly, \"Why do you ask?\" \"I need to tell you guys something.\" DUM DUMM DUMMM! What's Alex gonna tell them? Is it really just SOMEthing? OR EVERYTHING?! I honestly don't know yet haha. Oh, and for me, Batman not trusting Alex as Red Dawn or a heroine seemed kinda harsh, but I'll probably go into depth to that reasoning in the next chapter. Thanks for reading! =D[Chapter 13] This chapter was totally motivated and inspired by an insanely awesome and epic large chocolate chip frappuccino that I had like at 10 o' clock last night. After that I had French fries :D So...I hope you guys like it! Wayne Manor. 6:50 AM The Batmobile soundlessly drove into the Cave, where Alfred stood waiting with a number of steaming mugs on a silver platter. The top lifted, and Robin was the first to hop out. \"Good morning, Master Damian.\" Alfred greeted, offering the tray to the young vigilante. Robin walked right by him, \"No thank you, Pennyworth.\" The sound of his trudging boots echoed loudly in the deafening silence as he disappeared up the staircase. Alfred raised a curious brow as he walked over to Bruce, who remained silent and still as a statue. \"Might I ask where the others are?\" \"You helped Alex.\" Alfred didn't look the least bit surprised at the statement. \"Yes well, I saw no reason why not to.\" When Bruce didn't say anything, Alfred gave an all-too-knowing sigh and set the tray aside. \"What is it that you've done this time, Master Bruce?\" \"I lost all respect Alejandra had for me. If she ever had any, to begin with.\" Bruce removed his cowl and rubbed a hand over his tired face as he sat in front of the Computer. \"I messed up, Alfred.\" \"I'm sure you had your reasons, sir. But, surely it couldn't have been that bad?\" Bruce stared up at the glowing screen as several files of Alex began to pop up. Jason's files were pulled up right besides hers. \"I told Alex that the Riddler was partly responsible for ruining her life.\" Alfred's eyes widened slightly. After a careful pause, he finally asked quietly, \"And…she knew it was a test?\" \"Figured it out right away.\" Bruce confirmed grimly. \"She shoved it right in my face. She nailed me, Alfred. Alex knew what I was doing, and why. And she's never going to forgive me for that.\" Alfred looked up at both Alex and Jason's juvenile records on the screen with a thoughtful expression. \"You know, Master Bruce, on that first night you encountered Miss Alex, you told me that something about her screams Jason.\" Bruce listened to him intently. \"And I certainly agree with you there. But you must see that, although she is his daughter, Miss Alex is not Master Jason.\" When Bruce said nothing, Alfred continued seriously. \"And if that were the case, then I would have done everything in my power to prevent Red Dawn from being brought into existence. But I helped her. I helped her for the same reason I help you and everyone else who has ever been a part of this family: you give people hope .\" Bruce lifted his head to look at Alfred with a slightly surprised expression. \"And absolute and utter terror, of course. But, that's only for the cowardly criminals.\" Alfred mused. Bruce looked down at his open palms guiltily, \"I didn't have that faith in her, Alfred. I didn't even give her a chance as Red Dawn.\" He closed his eyes and frowned, \"She accused me of being afraid that she would turn into what Jason once was.\" \"And she's quite correct.\" Alfred said in agreement, \"After all this time, you still haven't let go of your guilt for everything that's happened to Master Jason. You fear Miss Alex shares the same fate. Perhaps she does,\" Bruce grimaced. \"Or perhaps she doesn't. Either way, Master Bruce, you cannot determine her destiny. Not you, and not Master Jason. It's all up to her . And she chose this life. All of you must accept that. Otherwise…she'll be forced to bear through it alone.\" Alfred picked his tray back up and began to walk away. \"And not even Batman has ever been able to accomplish that .\" 0o0o0o0o Troubled Youths' Home. 7:10 AM I was sitting alone at the head of the large kitchen table. Everyone was still asleep, and the only reason I was already up was because my brain kept replaying the memory over and over and over in my sleep, and it was too damn frustrating. I knew there was more to it, but instead of continuing, the scene would just go right back to the beginning. Ugh, it was giving me a headache. \"Are you hungry?\" Nate appeared and sat down in the chair beside me, his face still a little sleepy. \"I can make breakfast, if you want.\" \"That sounds awesome , but…no thanks.\" Nate leaned forward with his elbows on the table. \"You're still upset about yesterday, huh?\" Okay calm down people, I didn't tell him or Eddie any ultra major secrets last night. All I said was Bruce had a detective friend figure out the car accident that killed my mother had been no simple accident, and that Bruce laid the news on me so suddenly that I got pissed off at him for it. It wasn't that far from the truth. What I did tell the guys was that the memory of the crash had come back to me and aggravated me even more, which was how I'd ended up here. Eddie and Nate already knew that I had trouble remembering certain things from my life before the crash (Eddie had told Nate a while ago), so they understood why I was pretty much freaking out about it all. But everything else – Jason being my real dad; Jason wiping my childhood memories clean of himself and Roy and Dick and everything having to do with the vigilante life to keep me safe (boy did that turn out well); me being the very Red Dawn who saved their butts yesterday (they'd told me about that, and I had the vaguest feeling Eddie knew me and Red Dawn were one and the same but that issue was for another day because I couldn't freaking handle any more crap) – was still unknown to them. For now, anyway. I shrugged, \"Yeah, I'm still angry. But believe it or not, I'm not a very good grudge-holder. I'll probably be over it by the end of the day or something.\" \"At least he found out the truth for you.\" Nate offered. \"That ought to count for something.\" Yeah. Just because he was testing me to see if I was some kind of killer . Okay, maybe my lame grudge-holding could make the exception with Bruce and I'll just stay pissed off at him forever. He sure made it easy enough. When Nate saw I wasn't going to open up to this conversation like I had last night, he changed the subject. \"Soo, who would have guessed that Claudia and Seth used to be such good friends?\" He let out a little laugh. Oh yeah. I'd also told Nate that my mom and his dad used to be best friends. Eddie just couldn't get over the irony. \"And you used to be so rude to him!\" He'd laughed. \"I definitely wouldn't have.\" I smiled, \"Small world, huh?\" \"Very.\" He agreed, \"But it's a nice surprise.\" Nate paused, rubbing the back of his neck before asking bit sheepishly, \"So…does that mean we can be friends?\" I grinned widely, \"Considering that you offered to make me breakfast,\" I held my hand out to him, \"Welcome aboard, hermano!\" Nate chuckled as he took my hand, \"That was easier than I thought it would be.\" I raised my brows at him, \"Are you kidding me? I thought you knew.\" \"Knew what?\" \"That in a way…you've always been my friend, Nate. And I'm not just saying that because of the breakfast offer.\" I joked. His amused expression turned slightly surprised as I continued. \" You were the first one there for me when I lost everything. I didn't even know you, yet you sat with me on that bench anyway. And even though you didn't actually say anything…it still meant a lot.\" I shrugged, \"I never saw it before, but I do now.\" I gave him a small smile, \"So thanks, Nate.\" It took a few seconds for me to realize he was still holding my hand, except his handshake grip had softened into simple hand-holding. And – get this – the weirdest part of it all was that it wasn't awkward or uncomfortable like it probably should have been. It was just…nice. Okay I was totally thinking crazy. Too tired. \"Hey, guys.\" Nate practically fell out of his seat as Eddie walked in and plopped into the chair beside him with a yawn. I grinned tauntingly at Eddie while Nate sheepishly composed himself. \"Morning, Sleeping Beauty!\" \"You noticed my lovely bed hair, didn't you?\" Eddie smirked as he leaned back comfortably and ran a hand through his soft-looking-but-still-totally-scruffy bed hair, \"You know, I'm really in the mood for some French fries. Can we go to McDonald's?\" \"I don't think they serve French fries this early,\" Nate said. He smiled and then suggested, \"But we can have breakfast there, if you guys want.\" \"Nah,\" Eddie and I said at the same time. We both bolted upright and pointed at each other, \"JINX! No! I jinxed you first! No! I did!\" Then we grinned at each other and erupted into laughter. \"Right,\" Nate said in amusement as our loud laughing gradually lowered down to chuckles. \"I think you guys might still be lacking sleep.\" A mischievous grin stretched across his face, \"How about if we go to Starbucks instead and, you know, get a little crazy with their Coffee Frappuccino?\" \"Wow, Nate, what's got you acting all fun-and-nonsense today?\" Eddie joked. I smiled at Nate's eager expression. \"It probably has to do with the fact that he's now officially part of the BFF club.\" \"Oh really? Well as a matter of fact, Alex,\" Eddie said in a mock-professional lawyer voice, \"Nate was announced a member of the BFF club since the day I met him. We just never told you about it because I knew our bromance would be outlawed by your jealousy.\" Eddie smirked and Nate laughed. I pursed my lips to hold back my own grin, \"I'll just ignore the bromance and jealousy part and continue with this very serious session. Ahem. Oh really ? Well as a matter of fact, Eddie, as of today I confirm Nate's membership into the BFF club official .\" I hit my fist on the tabletop. \"Court has now ended! Bring out the dancing lobsters!\" Eddie grinned at Nate and thumbed to me, \"You'll get a kick out of being best friends with her. She nags and nags at you and can be bossy and butt into your business and gets upset about having to rescue you every time you're in peril and complains about how you put yourself in said peril in the first place and – \" Eddie immediately stopped counting off his fingers at my glare, and laughed before ending sincerely, \"And that's how you know she really cares. Because, deep down, you know she's doing it to keep you alive.\" His dark brown eyes flickered back to me as he smiled, and I knew he seriously meant it. And okay what was up with all these moments ?! Yeesh. I ripped my eyes away from Eddie's, feeling my face heat up in embarrassment. \"Yeah, that's my job description. Keeping your ass alive. For free .\" Ha! The irony of that statement! I got up and pulled out the credit card from the back pocket of my jeans, \"So do you guys want the Coffee Frappuccino or not? Because I'm totally fine with having both of yours for you.\" Eddie let out a low whistle as he got up. \"Nice credit card. The perks of being a billionaire's ward, huh? Hey, you should make that a book! And just for future reference, I demand forty percent of your profits.\" I barked a laugh, \"For what?\" \"For giving you a title! I deserve the credit!\" He grinned. \"Uh, guys?\" Eddie and I had just stepped outside the front door and turned around to look at Nate in confusion. \"We're still in our pajamas, remember?\" He gestured to his whole self with wide arms. I was still wearing the same clothes I had on yesterday, but I really didn't care. It's kind of what I've been doing my whole life on the streets, so yeah. Eddie didn't seem to care either. He waved a hand dismissively, \"Oh come on, Nate. Our so-called pajamas are just gray sweats and a plain t-shirt! No one will know the difference!\" \"You're not wearing shoes.\" \"Now that is a good point.\" After Eddie and Nate each threw on a pair of sneakers, we walked to Starbucks. It was still kind of early, so not a lot of people had the fortune of seeing Eddie and Nate in their PJ's. But it was a Monday, so two teenage girls in uniform were on their way to school when they passed by us on the sidewalk. And let me tell you, even I've never drooled that much in my sleep . It was just like the Laundromat girl with Eddie, except double the fluttering eyelashes and annoying giggles and dripping sweetness of their voices. And the most torturous part of it all? Eddie and Nate totally went with it. Nate just gave them that naturally nice smile of his (which still made them giggle), but Eddie used that certain crooked grin Dick totally taught him and gave them a quick wink, \"Good morning, ladies.\" They laughed and blushed and waved at him and Nate, \"Hi!\" And as they walked away, they started whispering – if that's what you would even call it – about how \"ohmigosh the dark-haired one was so hot!\" and how \"the blond-haired guy had the most beautiful eyes any guy has ever looked at me with!\" and how \"ohemgee did you see how their t-shirts showed how finely toned they both are?!\" followed by intense giggling and squealing. \"Oh give me a break.\" I snorted, rolling my eyes. \"Aww, don't get jealous, Alex. You'll always be our BFF!\" Eddie mockingly reassured me as he grinned widely. Nate was clearly suppressing his own laughter and barely succeeding. I scowled, \"Yeah yeah whatever. You two just work your mojo and make the cashier at Starbucks give us a full discount or something.\" \"But, you're rich.\" Nate reminded me with a smile. Eddie began choking on his laughter. I mentally face-palmed myself. I can't believe I actually forgot that. \"Well…it takes some getting used to okay?\" I snapped and trudged into the mostly empty Starbucks. Nate sat down to save us a small table by the glass window, but Eddie accompanied me to the cash register. I ordered our stuff and began giving the lady our names, \"Nate, Eddie, and – \" \"And write Red Dawn on hers, please.\" Eddie interrupted with a glint of triumph in his smile. It was obviously normal for people to give random names for their orders, so the lady had absolutely no idea whatsoever that she was really scribbling my alter ego onto the cup. My suspicions about Eddie knowing I was Red Dawn were now very clearly confirmed. And he very clearly wanted me to punch him all the way into next Tuesday. Throwing Eddie a quick, silent, we'll-talk-about-this-later Bat-glare, I turned and left him to sit with Nate. \"You look stressed out again.\" Nate observed in some concern. \"Yeah, that seems to be my life lately.\" I sighed, rubbing my eyes. Nate's order was called out first, and he went over to get it before sitting back down with his large frappuccino and a huge smile on his face. \"By the way, thanks for paying, Alex.\" \"No problem. What are BFF's for?\" I replied teasingly. Then my and Eddie's orders were called up next. \" Red Dawn and Nightfall! \" Nate almost choked on his drink, and I froze in my seat. No. Way . Eddie walked over to us with the frappuccinos and sat down with a smile. \"Has a nice ring to it, don't you think?\" Ten seconds of dead silence passed between us. Eddie remained unfazed. \"I know, I give awesome titles.\"[Chapter 14] So…Starbucks sure cleared everything up. And I was probably the worst secret-keeper in the world. Okay not probably . I was definitely the worst secret-keeper in the world. In the universe . In all the universes! If there were even that many, but whatever, I made my point. Nate was pretty surprised. Eddie just couldn't stop grinning. And as for Eddie's little \"Nightfall\" title, well he said he was partly inspired by Nightwing , who he'd totally figured out was actually Dick. Then he'd said with that annoyingly good-looking charming flashy smile of his, \"Besides, what's dawn without night falls?\" I had a lot of trouble restraining myself from repeatedly banging my forehead on the table. \"You're kidding , right?\" He laughed. \"I'm serious, Santos.\" I practically growled, lifting a warning finger at him, \"You better be joking.\" \"Relax, Alex,\" Eddie reassured me with a chuckle, \"I'm just messing with you.\" He tapped a finger on his chin in mock thoughtfulness, \"But if I were to become a not-so-mysterious but still totally kick-ass vigilante overnight like you did, then I would call myself Nightfall. If. That's all I'm saying.\" He lifted his hands as if in surrender and smiled, \"Honest.\" I relaxed a little, but kept the scowl on my face. \"Good.\" \"Sure thing, Red Dawn.\" I whacked his shoulder as he laughed. \"And that's another thing! Both of you have to swear you won't tell another soul about any thing you now know.\" Nate set down his frappuccino and raised his right hand in the air with a smile, \"Promise. My lips are sealed.\" He made the motion of sealing his mouth, locking it, and tossed the key at me. I grinned at him as I faked catching it and shoved it into my pocket. \"Thanks, Nate.\" I turned to Eddie again and raised my brows, \"Your turn, Nightfall .\" He raised his own brows at me, \"Since when have I ever not kept a secret for you? I'm practically your diary!\" \"Swear.\" He grinned crookedly, \"You mean like the F word?\" Nate almost spit out his frap in laughter. \"Just promise!\" I said, trying and failing miserably at forcing back my own grin. Eddie chuckled, \"Alex, I promise your biggest secret yet is safe with me. And just to prove to you that I am dead serious about keeping it a secret,\" he held his pinkie up to me, \"I pinkie promise.\" Pinkie promises were the real deal. Smiling, I hooked my pinkie around his, \"Thank you.\" \"So you really don't want me to be the Nightfall to your Red Dawn?\" I face-palmed myself. Ugh. Okay fine, I admit it. It would be the greatest, most awesome and epic thing ever if Eddie got to fight crime with me as a vigilante. I mean come on, who wouldn't want to kick ass alongside your best friend? I sure as hell wanted to! But…that was also exactly why I didn't want him doing it. \"Eddie,\" I began calmly, \"I've spent the past five years of my life trying to keep your butt alive on the constantly life-threatening streets of Gotham City. No way am I letting you purposely throw yourself into an even more life-threatening lifestyle after all my hard efforts of, and I repeat, keeping your butt alive .\" \"….so that's a no, then?\" \"I think it would be cool,\" Nate offered. \"Nate! You're siding with him ?\" \"Bromance trumps Romance.\" Eddie grinned, and he and Nate draped their arms around each other's shoulders. \"What does romance have to do with any of this?\" I demanded. \"That doesn't even make sense!\" \"Yeah it does! Make love, not war, man,\" said Eddie. Nate nodded in mock seriousness. \"You're not going to be Nightfall.\" I said flatly. Eddie grinned slyly and shrugged, \"Okay.\" \"Pinkie promise.\" \"Sorry, Alex.\" Eddie's grin widened, \"You know I never break pinkie promises. So…I can't pinkie promise on this.\" I glared at both of their smiling faces before finally smirking and sinking back into my chair. \"Okay. Yeah. I'm cool with that.\" Eddie immediately eyed me suspiciously, \"What's with the smug grin?\" \"Nothing, nothing.\" \"Bull.\" Grinning, I put my elbow on the table and held my hand out to him in a challenge, \"If I win, you don't get to be Nightfall. If I lose, you can be whatever the heck you want. Deal?\" \"Really? Okay.\" He smirked and gripped my hand in his. Nate darted to sit in the middle, \"Okay you two, I want a good clean match. On my mark…go!\" I slammed Eddie's hand into the table and almost fell back laughing as he choked out a swear word and rubbed his sore hand. \"What the fudge, Alex! Are you on steroids or something?!\" \"Hey, you know the people I live with!\" I snickered. For the past few days, Jason and Roy have been arm wrestling me, usually for the TV remote. In case it wasn't obvious, I lost a lot. But with a few pointers from Jason and some heavy weight lifting, I was slowly getting better. They're going to be so proud! Which reminded me… \"I have to get back to the manor.\" I said, jumping to my feet, \"Eddie, you lose!\" I called behind me as I rushed to get out of Starbucks. As the door swung closed behind me, I heard Eddie's final shout. \"There's always Halloween, y'know!\" 0o0o0o0o I slowly opened the large double doors and peeked inside, making sure the coast was clear before tiptoeing inside and silently closing the doors behind me. I turned around again and screeched to a stop. \"Holy – how the hell do you guys always do that?\" I exclaimed, throwing my arms up. \"Red Dawn seems to do an okay job of it,\" Jason said, smirking slightly. He was blocking my way with his arms folded across his chest. \"Yeah well, Red Dawn doesn't seem to be appreciated by the big mean Bat-Jerk, does she?\" \"I guess it runs in the family.\" We both grinned at each other. Jason put a hand on my shoulder, \"And, concerning that matter, we're gonna have a talk.\" \"You don't mean all that family therapy crap, do you?\" I groaned as he began leading me through the manor. \"Believe me, nobody finds it more annoying than I do. But Alfred's orders are Alfred's orders.\" There was a sudden loud bark and, next thing you know, my all too favorite mutt rammed into me with full force, tackling me to the ground with his giant tail wagging. \"At least the dog likes me!\" I shouted as I just lied there, letting Titus race in excited circles around me. \"Traitor.\" Damian said as Titus darted back to him. Titus grunted at him, and if the dog could talk, I was pretty sure he'd be lecturing the little bird brat. I let Jason pull me to my feet and I fixed my sweater back into place. I looked up and raised a brow at seeing everyone seated comfortably in the chairs front of the empty fireplace. \"Barbara? They dragged you into this, too?\" I snorted. \"Tell me about it. But it's always great seeing you, Alex.\" She greeted with a wry smile. On that first day when we grudgingly went shopping for the gala, Babs and I really kicked off to a great friendship. We both loved chilidogs! Jason did, too. \"Take a seat, Alex.\" Bruce said, gesturing to one of the comfy sofas. \"I'd rather stand, thanks.\" No way was I going to sit on the psycho chair while they worked their therapist mojo on me. Jason folded his arms across his chest and stared at Bruce, \"Okay. You can start apologizing.\" An apology ? Well hell, this just got interesting. Bruce cast a slightly warning glance at Jason before focusing back on me. Bruce's eyes darkened, and I stared back. \"What I said the other night was wrong.\" He began, still giving me that unflinching stare of his. \"I stepped way out of line, and I regret it.\" \"Yeah. You're not exactly easy on the whole bearing bad news thing.\" I muttered under my breath, knowing he'd hear me anyway. \"It wasn't my place to tell you about your mother's death. That was Jason's responsibility, and I knew he was going to tell you given the right moment. But instead I abused that knowledge to use against you, to test you.\" \"Because you don't trust me.\" I said smoothly. \"And that was my mistake. I judged you wrong, Alex. I saw you as Red Dawn and…\" I thought I saw a flicker of sadness in his eyes, but it was only for a second. \"And all I could see was Jason.\" That…made sense. \"I'm not Jason.\" I stated obviously. \"Sure it'd be the greatest thing in the world if I could be like him,\" I cracked a grin at Jason and he smirked back, but it faltered for a moment. I looked back at Bruce and everyone else, \"But maybe it wouldn't seem so great to you guys.\" I shrugged, \"Point is, I'm not one hundred percent Jason. Just like fifty percent.\" \"And that's supposed to make us feel better?\" Damian scoffed. Tim sighed at him. \"Shut it, Wayne.\" I warned. \"Anyway, I'm not looking for an approval. Not from you,\" I looked at Bruce, \"Not from any one. I don't even need you to believe in me as Red Dawn.\" I snorted. \"I do what I want, because I know I'm doing it for the right reasons. I know you like to control things, Bruce, but you don't control me . And why am I even explaining any of this?\" I demanded to myself. I looked at everyone in the room. \"It's simple: Get on board. Or get out of my way.\" \"That's my girl,\" Jason muttered with a small, proud smirk. \"And that's why we're here, Alex.\" Roy said with a smile. \"We decided we're on board. All of us. Right, Batsy? And Bratsy?\" Damian scowled at him. \"I will kill you.\" Roy's grin only broadened. Okay. That dramatic speech suddenly seemed a bit too dramatic. I raised my brows, \"Are you serious?\" Bruce just looked at me seriously. \"Right.\" I said. I looked at everyone else, \"Uhh…thanks. I guess.\" \"One moment she's totally inspirational and the next she's as flat as a deflated balloon.\" Barbara observed in amusement. \"That comes from the fifty percent side of Jason.\" Dick said with a grin. I stuck my tongue out at him childishly. \"Since we're all done here, I'm going to the kitchen. I'm starving.\" \"Hold it. There's something else you need to know.\" I stopped in my tracks and let out a heavy sigh as I lazily swirled around to look at Bruce, \"What?\" Damian snickered and Tim smiled and Dick chuckled and Babs stifled a laugh and Roy seemed to brace himself for the apocalypse. Jason looked at me wryly. \"You're starting school tomorrow.\" The silence was suspenseful as everyone waited for my reaction. Even I didn't know what was coming next. Instead of exploding, I found myself frowning at them. \"As long as Alfred makes me his waffles for breakfast.\" They all blinked in surprise. \"Seriously?\" Dick asked, looking hopeful. \"Pffft. No.\" I turned around and left, laughing my head off all the way.[Chapter 15] I want to thank the two lovely guest reviews for the previous chapter. As always, they bring me motivation x] So here's the next chapter, and things are starting to look a little interesting again xD \"Why the hell doesn't he have to go to school?\" \"Because I read Clausewitz and Jomini at the age of six while you were still playing with Barbie dolls.\" \"I never played with Barbie dolls.\" I replied darkly. \"Actually, when you were six, Jason was teaching you how to load a pistol.\" Roy stated matter of factly, his mouth stuffed with chocolate chip pancakes. \"And I tried teaching you how to notch an arrow…but that didn't really turn out so well.\" He shoved another forkful of pancake into his mouth and poured more oozing syrup over his breakfast. I looked back to Damian smugly, \"Ha!\" I paused as I let that sink in, then glanced at Jason across the table. \"You let me handle a loaded gun?\" His mouth was also full with his own pancakes, \"What kind of a dad would I be if I did that ?\" I lifted an eyebrow. He swallowed and rolled his eyes, \"I let you load it one time. Other than that I just gave you demonstrations.\" Hmm, well that definitely explained how I knew how to load a pistol like it was a reflex. \"Mom didn't know, did she?\" I smirked. \"Would we still be alive to tell the tale if she did?\" Roy replied jokingly. \"Loading a pistol -tt- I'm so jealous.\" Damian said sarcastically. I reached out and stabbed my fork onto his stack of pancakes, stealing two. \"Give those back, Todd!\" He reached out with his fork to snatch his pancakes, but I lifted my plate out of his reach. \"Hey, I need it more than you do. All you're gonna do today is fight for justice and throw scumbags in jail. I'm starting high school .\" Still keeping the plate up and out of his reach, I lifted my leg out to the side to keep him at a safe distance and quickly started shoving the pancakes into my mouth. Dick then walked in and saw Damian straining to reach my lifted arm for the plate and me barely balancing on one leg of the tilted chair, which was about ready to fall over with me and my leaning tower of pancakes and waffles. \"Guys, come on.\" He pleaded in exasperation. He looked at Jason with disapproval, \"You're letting this happen?!\" \"What?\" Jason said with his mouth full. He pointed at me with his fork, \"She's handling it.\" Damian suddenly struck a rapid punch to my shoulder, and the plate fell from my hand to spill on the table. \"You call that handling it?\" \"Shut up, Grayson.\" \"Did you just lock my muscles?!\" \"You might just be the world's next greatest detective, Todd.\" With my hands now free, and my right arm feeling a lot like jelly, I shoved Damian's chair onto the floor. But he'd totally seen my move and hopped out of it before it even hit the floor. But, before the real battle could begin, Jason and Dick intervened. Dick picked Damian up by the back of his shirt and Jason grabbed my limp right arm, shaking it loosely and grinning. \"Maybe you don't have to go to school after all.\" \"Great. I can't wait to write the excuse note. Punched by ten-year-old annoying brat stepbrother because she stole his freaking pancakes.\" I waved my noodle arm with my other hand, \"Oh that's right, I can't write the excuse note.\" \"It'll wear off in a while.\" Dick sighed, casting a quick frown at Damian, who only looked smug. \"But you're still going to school.\" \"Sure. Send me off to my doom with a noodle for a right arm.\" I stared at them, \"You guys do remember that I haven't been to an actual school since the third grade, right?\" Clearly, I was lacking in five years of book knowledge. And Bruce had apparently enrolled me in Gotham Academy. Which is only the most prestigious school with the highest scores and highest education and probably the highest buildings, too. And I'm not even gonna mention the uniforms. Ugh. The uniforms. \"Yeah. You've told us about ninety two times now.\" Roy joked before chugging down his glass of chocolate milk. Jason mimicked his teasing, \"Ninety two? Huh. I thought it was already in the low hundreds.\" \"Eh, it probably will be by the time she walks out the door.\" \"Miss Alex, what on earth are you still doing in your pajamas!\" Alfred hurried towards us at the breakfast table, \"If you don't ready yourself now, you're sure to be late.\" Yeah. My pajamas were pretty much a pair of soccer shorts and a plain t-shirt. Way better than the uniform I was supposed to put on. I huffed, \"Time to go and make myself look like an idiot.\" \"At least that's never been a challenge for you.\" Damian snickered. After a long stare, I slowly lifted a finger to point an inch from his face. \"I know where you live.\" Tim swiftly slid down the banister and went to stand beside Alfred. He was already dressed in his sharp uniform and had his book bag strung over his shoulder. He looked at me a bit impatiently, \"Alex, I know you're probably imagining every which way to get vengeance for this or something, but we've really gotta go.\" He thumbed behind him towards the entrance. \"Yeah yeah, I'm going.\" I walked past Damian, lightly smacking the back of his head and instinctively ducking just as I felt his arm swing over my head. I turned around and walked backwards while giving him a wide grin, \"Ha! You missed.\" \"Enjoy Algebra 2, Todd.\" \"You're one mean little kid, you know that?\" \"That's just his charm.\" Jason smirked as he turned me around and directed me towards the stairs. \"Don't freak out, Alex!\" Roy shouted encouragingly from below, \"You're a survivor! And if you flunk, well who the heck needs math anyway!\" In exactly four minutes, I was already throwing my backpack into the backseat of the limo and hopping in beside Tim. 'That was fast.\" Tim observed in some surprise. \"Well what was I gonna do? Spend an hour in the mirror obsessing over my looks?\" I snorted, \"I don't think so.\" I really didn't give a crap that my ponytail was sloppy and that one of my sleeves was folded shorter than the other and that a piece of my white-collar shirt was sticking out from the bottom of my sweater vest. What I did give a crap about was the damn skirt . As Alfred started driving onto the road, I tried to tug the blue fabric as far down as it could go, which wasn't even an inch. \"Okay who was the perv that made this a school requirement?\" Tim chuckled. \"Do you have your schedule with you?\" \"Yeah, it's in here somewhere.\" I dug my hand around the bottom of my backpack, pulling out the crumpled piece of paper and tossing it to him. \"Here.\" He caught it and blinked at the crumpled ball and shook his head in amusement, \"I really hope you survive this, Alex.\" \"Gee thanks for the support. Everyone's always just so chock full of it.\" The words came out harsher than it meant to, and I sighed, slumping back onto the seat. \"Sorry,\" Tim apologized. His expression turned sheepish, \"I know it always seems like we're knocking you down – \" \"That's an understatement.\" \"And it's wrong of us, I know,\" Tim continued sympathetically, \"But I guess it's just, unintentionally, our first instinct. With you being Jason's kid – \" \"Yeah I get it, trust issues.\" I grumbled. I didn't like that everyone still had trouble putting a little faith in Jason. It annoyed the hell out of me, and not because it made everyone prejudge me, it annoyed me because Jason was my dad, and no way was I gonna let everyone crap on him all the time. \"And besides, didn't I just very recently establish the fact that I'm not Jason?\" I demanded. \"Does anyone even listen to anything I say around here?!\" \"Calm down and let me finish.\" Tim said. \"What I'm trying to say is…you're intimidating.\" \"Really? Good.\" I smirked. He rolled his eyes, \"Yeah. But what it really means is we know you're destined for something, Alex. And the reason we - especially Bruce - give you a rough time is because we don't know what that is yet. We're just trying to steer you in the right direction and keep you off the wrong track. And believe me, you don't make it easy.\" He said with a snort. \"But that's probably just the fifty percent of Jason side you were talking about.\" Hm, I guess I never really saw it that way. I mean, I was the scruffy street rat that no one ever tossed change at and picked other people's pockets. I couldn't exactly tell when someone was trying to do something right for me. I'd totally forgotten what it was like to have someone, or a lot of people in this case, look out for me. It was just kinda…strange. \"And, speaking for myself,\" Tim continued, pulling me out of my thoughts. \"When I first heard that Bruce took you in, I honestly freaked out a little.\" That made me grin, \"Whaaaat? Seriously?\" I snickered and elbowed his ribs, \"Red Robin, leader of the mighty Teen Titans freaked out by the not so average teenage street girl. Nice.\" He smiled, \"Well, it was mostly your background. Your ties to Jason, how you pretty much died and then came back to life from the crash, and the mere fact that you lived on the streets of Gotham and actually survived all these years. It's just…my childhood's so normal . I mean, Batman and Nightwing, and I guess even Red Hood, had some rough stuff to deal with growing up, but…but you – you went through all that, and you're still here. You even ended up turning yourself into one of us. That's…pretty intimidating.\" Wow. Talk about being left speechless. And all this was coming from one of the guys who'd least trusted Jason most of his life. That seemed pretty impressive to me. I smiled and lightly bumped Tim's shoulder with my fist, \"Well thanks, hermano .\" \"Anytime, hermana .\" \"Nice accent.\" I approved. \"Thanks. Multilingual.\" \"Everyone just loves bragging about their fluency in multiple languages, don't they?\" \"You'll get there soon enough.\" \"As if.\" The car parked to a stop and Alfred opened the door for us. Tim and I got out, and I tilted my head all the way back to look at the building that towered over us. \"Nice arches. The keystones are freaking perfectly aligned.\" Tim looked at me with raised eyebrows, \"You know architecture?\" \"I can sound like a dork, too, you know.\" I smirked and shrugged, \"When I was ten I walked into the public library and found this gigantic Art History textbook.\" I used my hands to demonstrate the approximate size. \"It weighed more than I did, and that's not an exaggeration. I was bored and curious and bored at the time so – \" Tim's eyes bugged out, \"You read an entire Art History book when you were ten ?!\" \"Are you out of your mind, Drake? That thing is like a thousand pages long. I only read what I thought looked cool. Like van Gogh's paintings.\" \"Oh. Well then you should consider taking AP Art History. They have that here and it's actually a great – \" \"And I repeat: are you out of your mind ? Yeesh. I appreciate the general support, Tim, but now you're just talking mental.\" I took my schedule out from his hand and waved back at Alfred as I walked towards the building, \"Bye, Alfred! Thanks for packing my lunch!\" He waved back in amusement, \"I wish you the best of luck, Miss Alex!\" So I walked right into the hallways of hell and miraculously found the way to my first class. And just as I was about to walk towards the open door, I heard a familiar voice call out my name from behind. \"Alejandra, is that you?\" Oh no. Oh crap. Oh holy crapness. Forcing myself to look as relaxed as I possibly could, I slowly turned around and saw none other than Carina Sanchez. Eddie's ex girlfriend. Where was the goddamn lightning bolt to strike down on you when you needed it? She said goodbye to two of her friends she was talking to before jogging over to me with a genuinely friendly smile. I already told you guys before Carina was a great person, nice and friendly and helpful and all that. She had morals and such. As far as I could tell, she wasn't a fake, either. She was just your normal teenager. Maybe that was why I didn't like her? Possibly. But no , it was definitely not because I was jealous ! Because that would be ridiculous , because it wouldn't even make sense , because I totally did not like Eddie that way, because he was just my friend , because I liked having him as my friend , and because why would anyone even think that Eddie and I - oh jeez never mind . Carina finally arrived to stand in front of me, and I forced a smile, \"Carina! Fancy meeting you here.\" \"I could say the same,\" she replied with a grin, \"I haven't seen you in while. How've you been?\" \"Oh you know, I'm Bruce Wayne's new ward…and yeah.\" I replied lamely. \"So I've heard.\" She said teasingly, \"That must be exciting, huh? You're lucky you get to go here. Gotham Academy is a great place. I'm sure you'll make some new friends around here.\" \"Yeah well, you know I'm not the social butterfly type.\" I half joked, looking around at the crowds of smart-looking teens. Even their clothes looked more sophisticated than mine. And I was wearing the exact same thing! Carina chuckled, \"You'll be fine, don't worry.\" She gestured to the door I'd been about to go into, \"Is that where your first period is?\" \"Biology, yeah.\" I grimaced, \"I don't know squat about that stuff. I mean honestly, what's the point? When's Biology going to help me in any thing?\" \"Everyone's asking that, believe me.\" Carina smiled and began leading me there, \"And since I'm a junior, I can help you out with anything you need. All you have to do is ask.\" \"I'll remember that, thanks.\" I replied halfheartedly, trying to make my grimace look more like a smile. I barely took another step down the hall when Carina stopped me, \"Um, Alex?\" Suppressing a heavy sigh, I turned to face her again, \"Yeah?\" She bit her lip before continuing carefully, \"About Eddie – \" Oh no, please not this conversation. \"It doesn't matter.\" I interrupted, trying to reassure her, \"You two were a couple, I get it. Eddie and I have always been just best friends. No big deal, it's not like this is some lame Spanish soap opera, right?\" I grinned. She laughed, \"Oh my gosh, those are terrible. Yet most of the time I can't stop myself from watching one.\" She seemed to relax a little, \"Sorry for asking about Eddie. I just wanted to make sure we could be friends.\" She smiled, \"He talks about you a lot, you know.\" I snorted and rolled my eyes at myself because why the heck did that comment suddenly make my day? \"Yeah, he tends to talk a lot.\" \"And it kind of made me realize that, even though I've known you for a while now, we've never really been friends.\" Jeez, why did she have to be so friendly ? It just made me feel worse about disliking her for no apparent reason. I sighed and offered her a smile, \"Well since we're stuck in the same school, might as well, right?\" \"Great.\" She smiled and stepped back with a wave, \"It was nice meeting you again, Alex.\" Then she turned around and went to rejoin her group of friends. \"So that's Eddie's ex girlfriend?\" I nearly jumped out of my skirt, and turned my head to see Tim standing casually beside me. I scowled at him, \"Do you have to do that?!\" He ignored my question. \"Didn't you say Eddie broke up with her about a year ago?\" \"Yeah, what's your point?\" I demanded. He smirked, \"Then why are you still jealous?\" \"What the – I am not jealous !\" I was practically frothing at the mouth. \"Alex, I'm an investigator with a mind like a razor and an eagle eye for detail. You're jealous.\" \"And you're basically a stalker!\" I retorted before marching off. I stopped, turned around again, and shouted at him from where I stood, \"And by the way, I slipped your favorite chocolate chip cookies out from your backpack when you weren't looking, so take that Mr. Eagle Eye for Detail!\" I pulled the Ziplock back out as proof and shoved a cookie into my mouth before storming away again.[Chapter 16] His knock was answered and Dick opened the door, a surprised look flickering across his face. \"Eddie?\" He questioned with a mouth full of bagel. Eddie grinned, \"Hey, Dick. I was just, y'know, bored , so I decided I'd show up here. If you're not busy or anything.\" He added. \"You already know mi casa es su casa.\" Dick replied, smiling with his mouth still full, and gestured for Eddie to enter the apartment. \"Thanks.\" Eddie walked in, tossing the backpack he'd been carrying onto the sofa before plopping down on it. He immediately began pulling papers out of it and dumping them onto the cluttered coffee table. \"So, since basically everybody I know is a superhero, I decided: why the heck shouldn't I be one?\" He picked up one of the wrinkled sheets of paper and held it up to show a bunch of sketches on it, \"I mostly got some ideas from your Nightwing suit, and I think – are you choking?\" Dick managed to swallow down the giant chunk of bagel that was clogging his windpipe and proceeded to gape at Eddie, \"You…you know about…about…you know ?\" \"…Alex didn't tell you.\" \"…Nope.\" \"…\" \"…\" Eddie shrugged and leaned back against the sofa, \"Well yeah. I know.\" Dick nodded, pressing his lips together as he thought hard. \"Okay.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Cool.\" Dick was silent a few seconds longer before the faintest hint of a smile tugged at his mouth. \"Did you fit the pieces of the puzzle by yourself?\" Eddie smirked, \"It really wasn't that hard. I know Alex way too well. One look at Red Dawn saving my ass and it just clicked.\" \"Alex is always saving your ass.\" Dick agreed. \"Good detective skills, nonetheless. You figured out everyone else's alter ego. That's very rare.\" \"Ridiculously rare.\" Eddie added as he picked up another drawing, \"I can't believe nobody even suspects a thing.\" \"You didn't either, until recently.\" Dick pointed out. \"No way. I always knew you were a hero, Chief Grayson.\" Eddie smiled, and Dick returned it. \"So, can I see those?\" Dick picked up a chair and set it beside the sofa, sitting on it so that his elbows rested on the back part. Eddie handed him one of the sketches and Dick studied it, his eyebrows raising in approval. \"These look great. Considering you stopped drawing like this years ago.\" \"It helps when you're not on the streets having to look back over your shoulder every two minutes wondering when someone's going to jump out and stab you. I have plenty of free time now. And access to paper.\" Dick continued to sift through the rest of the designs, \"You think of a name yet?\" \"When Alex, Nate, and I went to Starbucks, she spilled the beans about all of you guys. None of it was news to me except for the part about the Red Hood.\" Eddie paused and looked at Dick questioningly, \"Is he really her dad?\" Dick rubbed the back of his neck and nodded, \"Yep.\" \"And the memory wipe thing…?\" \"Also a yep.\" Eddie nodded, \"Got it. Anyway, since Alex got her name from Red Hood a.k.a her dad, I decided to base my name off of yours, a.k.a the one guy who's the closest thing I've ever had to a dad.\" Eddie scratched his head sheepishly, \"Mushy, I know, but it's true.\" A warm smile stretched across Dick's face, \"Let's hear it.\" \"Nightfall.\" \"Catchy.\" Dick approved, \"And it matches with the design. If none of this attracts any crazed fangirls, I don't know what will.\" They both laughed. \"So you're really okay with this?\" Eddie asked with raised eyebrows, thinking it was too good to be true. \"'Course I am. I've known you long enough to know you're meant for this.\" Dick's easy expression wavered slightly, \"But, I also want you to know what you're getting yourself into. You're not going to be fighting the average street criminal all the time. The gig can get way out of hand, and you're going to have to be prepared for everything this city throws at you. Do I make myself clear?\" \"Yes, sir.\" Eddie knew Dick got serious only when it really was serious. Alex had also told him that Jason had warned her about the exact same thing, and that was why he hadn't wanted her becoming part of the costumed life either. But she did anyway, because she was Alex, and everyone just had to learn to deal with it. \"Do I need Batman's approval, too?\" Eddie asked. \"I mean, this is his city after all.\" \"Not if I take you under my wing.\" Dick reassured him, \"He'll probably just tell me it'll be my responsibility to teach you everything and more, all of that doom and gloom stuff. But I know you'll make me proud, Santos. You always have.\" \"Thanks, Dick. And that was a lame pun, by the way, Night wing .\" Dick grinned, \"I know, it slipped out before I realized it.\" Eddie snickered, \"Sure.\" Dick playfully bumped the back of his head before standing up and walking towards the bedroom. \"Now let's see…I know I have some spare Bat Goodies lying around here some where.\" \"How about some needle and thread to go with that?\" Eddie called out as he looked at his sketches again. \"First thing Alfred taught me!\" Dick replied proudly. Eddie smirked as he added a darker shade to his design, the finishing touch. The whole suit was pitch black, to blend in with the night. No cape. Instead of just spreading across his arms and chest, the darker streaks of blue traced thin lines down his sides, similar to Alex's look. Instead of a utility belt, he was going to have a few hidden compartments sewed into the material. Cowl was black, but outlined in the same blue. Oh, and no Bat symbol. Eddie wasn't so sure he'd be completely welcomed by the family since Dick was so far the only one who knew he was now to be Nightfall. So, he wasn't going to risk it. And as for Alejandra's reaction? It was going to be priceless. Hehe I bet a lot of your forgot about this story like I did x] sorry about that, but I'll definitely keep making the effort to update whenever I can![Chapter 17] Wayne Manor. 8:22 PM. Alex's POV. It was really quiet as Tim and I sat at the dining table, which was littered with all of my textbooks and new binders and pens and all that school junk. I was staring hard at the set of math problems in front of me, willing the possibly undiscovered heat vision I might've actually had my whole life and just never knew I had it to fry the dumb book into ashes. About two seconds later, I tossed my pencil aside and slammed my hands on the table, \"Well! I guess I don't have heat vision after all. I quit.\" I started to push my chair back, but Tim stopped me. \"No quitting.\" He said sternly and put the pencil back in my hand. He pointed at the example, \"See, if you just cancel out – \" Tim stopped mid-sentence, and his expression soured as he watched me swiftly twirl the mechanical pencil with my fingers. \"I didn't even know I could do this!\" I grinned, and tossed it into the air and caught it with my other hand, twirling it around my fingers again. \"Neat, huh?\" Tim snatched the pencil from my hand, \"Alex, please focus.\" He said, exasperated, \"I'm trying to tutor you and you're not making it any easier.\" I snorted, \"Well I'm sorry that you're not making this any more boring .\" He sighed, rubbing his tired face with his hands. \"It's math. It's supposed to be boring.\" \"Good point. Remind me again why they put me into Pre-Calculus?\" I said as I randomly flipped through the book. \"Because they made you take a test and the results for your level in math came out high above average. A true miracle considering the last kind of math you ever did was third-grade long division. The staff was pretty shocked.\" \"Maybe I cheated.\" I suggested nonchalantly. \"They expel people for that kind of stuff, right?\" Just kidding, I didn't cheat. And FYI, Dick used to teach me all kinds of stuff during my time on the streets, math being one of them. Except he was a way better tutor than Drake here. He basically made learning a party! \"Alex, you were the only one taking the test. And the test proctor was monitoring you the whole time.\" Tim deadpanned, \"Sorry, but you're not getting kicked out of school anytime soon.\" \"Wow. Way to crush a girl's dream, Drake.\" \"Focus.\" He ordered, handing me my pencil back. I only got past one more problem, which I actually did correctly, and then Jason skidded in, suited up with his trademark helmet under his arm. \"Drop the pencil and suit up!\" He hollered, \"We're going on patrol!\" I sat up straight, suddenly feeling wide awake and pumped. \"Seriously?\" Bruce hadn't really given me the total liberty of going out as Red Dawn, because I was \"lacking in the proper training\" or something like that. But disobeying Bruce was a pretty fun hobby. \"What, we can't have a little father-daughter bonding time?\" Jason smirked. \"Are you kidding me? I've been waiting for it!\" Grinning, I pushed my chair back and got up, \"Give me two minutes!\" \"So much for being a responsible dad.\" Tim remarked, getting up and shaking his head at Jason. Jason snorted, \"Believe it or not, Drake, I can be responsible. And I'd like to see you try and raise that unstoppable force of nature all on your own.\" \"And kudos to you for that.\" I praised as I jogged past Jason. 0o0o0o0o0o Jason's POV \"How do you know where everything is in this thing?\" Alex said, exasperated and pulling out a handful of gas pellets from one of the pouches of the utility belt. \"It's filled with the randomest crap. I'm pretty sure you'll find gummy bears in there. And loose change.\" Jason added with a snicker. Honestly, no one ever knew what the hell they would pull out from the damn belt, just that it would somehow be exactly what they needed to save their own asses. The utility belt, like Batman, was always freakin' weirdly prepared. \"So if I'm smack in the middle of a life or death situation, chances are I'll come up with green gummy bears in my hand for my only defense?\" Jason smirked, \"Exactly.\" \"Awesome.\" Alex snorted, putting away the gas pellets. Jason gave one last quick scan of the street before straightening up, \"Nothing going on around here. Let's move on.\" As they leaped from rooftop to rooftop, Jason casually observed Alex from his peripherals. He was impressed by the way she moved, landing soundlessly on the balls of her feet and springing forward effortlessly, shooting her grappling hook at precisely the right angle and slicing a path through the air like a swift knife. It was exactly the way he'd taught her to get around, and that was over six years ago. And when it came to her fighting skills and training, she wasn't even that rusty. The kid just had natural talent, like she'd been born to live this life. Or at least those were Dick's words. Jason hated the idea. There was a time when he would've agreed that hell yes, his daughter was born to kick Gotham City ass. …But that was before the accident, before Claudia died. Alex died, too. But she came back, and Jason would sometimes find himself seriously wondering if she'd inherited that from him. He hated that idea even more. After the accident, Jason hadn't wanted Alex to live the vigilante life anymore. He wanted to get her out of it, and the only way to do it was by giving her a clean slate. Literally. But wiping her memory spotless and completely abandoning her hadn't made a damn difference, because she pushed and shoved and found her way back into the life he'd tried to get her out of. He was proud of her for that, of course, but at the same time he freaked out. Jason hadn't wanted Alex to be Red Dawn. He wanted Alex to be safe , but she sure as hell wasn't making that happen. And there was no talking her out of it, either. Why'd she have to be so stubborn? Oh right, genetics. So Jason decided to go along with it and let her be Red Dawn. Roy convinced him. Dick convinced him. And there was no stopping her anyway, so why the hell not? And watching her now, he felt pretty good about making that call. For now, anyway. Then, as if reading his mind, Alex landed to a stop and looked at him, \"Hey, Jason?\" \"Hm?\" \"Thanks for letting me do this.\" \"Well, it's not like I had a choice, right?\" he joked, smirking. She grinned back at him. \"Right. But thanks anyway. Sure, it's awesome that everyone else, even Bruce , supports me now, but yours is the one that really counts.\" Jason's smirk softened into a smile, \"Thanks, kiddo. And you know what? Claudia would be damn proud of you right now.\" Alex's eyebrows lifted above her cowl, \"You think so?\" Her voice was soft, but the longing and excitement in it was clear as daylight. \"She was always proud. I mean she freaked out about your safety all the time, yeah, but she was still proud .\" Jason chuckled. There were a couple of seconds of peaceful silence. \"So how did you two meet?\" Alex suddenly asked, a smile twitching on her mouth. \"I've always wondered.\" \"I never knew you were into romance.\" Jason taunted, \"Wait, actually I did. You and the Santos kid are pretty close, huh?\" \"I don't know what you're talking about!\" Alex immediately blurted, taking the bait. Jason had yet to be able to talk about Claudia without feeling like he'd been slammed in the gut by a freight train. He knew he wouldn't be able to dodge the topic forever, but he could prolong it. At least for a while. Jason turned his head away from Alex and waved a dismissive hand, \"Yeah whatever.\" He turned thoughtful for a second, suddenly deciding he'd at least give Alex a piece of Claudia. He half-turned to add, \"And, when I first met her…Claudia called me…an assbutt.\" Silence. \"A…what?\" \"That's all you're getting for now.\" Jason said. \"What the heck's an assbutt?\" Jason smirked, remembering the other reason why he'd taken Alex out on patrol tonight. \"You'll know it when you see it! But right now we have to go.\" \"Wait, where ?\" Alex called out as he was already ahead and on the move. \"Just a quick heads up: blame Nightwing!\" Jason cackled as he led the way to their meeting spot. 0o0o0o0o0o Eddie's POV \"Oh my god she's gonna kill me.\" Eddie said, staring up at the cloudy night with a comically blank expression. Maybe, just maybe he should've given the whole Nightfall identity a second thought. Nightwing chuckled, \"Did you really realize that just now ? Kinda late to back out, Santos.\" \"Yeah.\" Eddie rubbed the back of his neck, sighing. \"Well, at least I'll die handsome and leave behind a good-looking corpse.\" \"You mean if there's anything left of you afterwards.\" Dick corrected, and Eddie's expression soured. His so-called mentor was not making this any easier. \"Did you find something?\" He asked instead. He should focus on what they were working on now, which was an actual investigation that was actually interesting enough to investigate. Nightwing straightened up from his crouch on the ground. He rubbed his gloved fingers together, and they both watched the soot rain to the ground again. \"This is the same material that was left behind from the shipment Red Robin and I interrupted last time.\" Eddie knew that Red Robin, a.k.a Tim, a.k.a the guy he barely caught a glimpse of during Bruce Wayne's gala a few weeks ago, was a pretty damn good detective. \"He hasn't figured anything out about it yet?\" Eddie asked, slightly surprised. \"He hasn't really been able to,\" Nightwing explained, looking amused, \"Aside from everything else he's juggling in life, he now has to tutor Red Dawn. I can't even imagine how that's going along.\" \"So then, it's up to us to get to the bottom of it.\" \"Only if you're up for it, Nightfall. Just know that things like this always turn out as…not what you expect.\" \"What else is there to expect from Gotham?\" Eddie joked, but he took Nightwing's words seriously. He understood that none of this – the costumed life with all the awesome training and gadgets – was not a game. Every bit of it was real, and he'd just have to handle it as best as he could. \"What. The. Hell .\" Oh shit. Eddie very slowly and very carefully turned around until he was fully facing Red Dawn. Her whole posture was stiff, and her left eyebrow twitched once. If it weren't for the whites of her cowl shielding her green eyes, he would've been torched by her glare on the spot. Resisting the urge to get away as fast as he could from there, Eddie smiled a little and raised a hand, \"Hey,\" he said lamely. \"Are you insane ?\" \"Well – \" \"It's just…are you serious ?\" \"Yeah, I – \" \"This is not another one of your stupid jokes?\" \"I like to think my jokes aren't stupid, some of them can actually be pretty funny – \" \"So this is what you've decided?\" \"Jeez, what's with all the questions ? You're seriously starting to freak me out.\" \"Just want to confirm something before I do anything irrational. Like punch your face in.\" He snorted at the last part. \"I am Nightfall, okay? I wasn't exactly kidding when I told you that.\" Eddie half smiled, \"I'm doing this because I want to, and because I think it's right .\" He paused, \"And also because I don't look half bad in spandex.\" Next thing you know, he felt a hard fist slam into his jaw, making him stumble back a little. \" Ow .\" He emphasized, rubbing his jaw, \"What the hell !\" Alex stared at him in furious exasperation. She shoved him a little, \" You …are a freaking assbutt .\" It got quiet. \"Qué?\" Eddie said, more confused than ever. \"What –what does that even mean ?!\" \"Pardon the interruption but, uh, did you just call him an assbutt ?\" Nightwing asked politely. Red Hood, who'd been standing beside him the whole time, snickered. \"I told her Claudia used to say it.\" \"I remember,\" Nightwing grinned. \"Fun word.\" \"Okay, call me an assbutt or whatever, but, I'm still doing this,\" Eddie said, trying to be the reasonable one – like always. \"Half a little faith, Alex. That's all I'm asking.\" She stared at him, and it was more than just a little unnerving. Like the bat-glare. He idly wondered if he'd ever be able to do that. Another couple of moments passed before Alex huffed a sigh, and he watched as she forced herself to relax. \"Fine.\" She grumbled, folding her arms across her chest. \"Do what you want, Nightfall . Once I get over your ridiculous spandex comment, you'll have my support.\" Eddie grinned, \"Good to know.\" He really was relieved. That actually hadn't gone as bad as he'd been expecting. With absolutely no warning, Alex suddenly rammed into him, knocking him flat on his back with a rapid strike of her fist into his gut. Eddie landed hard on his back with a wheeze, wide eyes blinking up at the night sky. \"Holy shit I think you broke something.\" She marched right up to him, \"That was me going easy . If you want to be Nightfall, man up .\" Then she stomped off again, swearing a stream of made-up words that hardly qualified as swears, and leaving him behind with a softly chuckling Nightwing and a very smug Red Hood. Eddie sighed heavily and rested an arm over his head, closed his eyes, and just lied there. \"This is just the beginning, isn't it?\" he said to no one in particular. \"Better get used to it,\" Red Hood said. Nightfall sat up and looked at him, \"You're her dad, right?\" \"In the flesh.\" \"Er, good to meet you.\" \"You know I came back from the dead, right?\" \"Uh, yeah.\" Jason clapped his hand on Eddie's shoulder, \"Good. Just remember that.\" Then he shoved his hands in his pockets and walked off, whistling light-heartedly as he went. Eddie, confused and maybe a little freaked out, turned back to Nightwing. There was a brief silence. \"What just happened?\"[Chapter 18] A/N: Oh my gosh what is this?! Tons of sorry's on my part for putting this off for so incredibly long. So let's pretend that these two months that I didn't update were like that break every T.V show was just to annoy the crap out of people. So like, that last chapter was the 'Mid-Season Finale' or whatever. And now we're starting off fresh :D So this chapter takes place also two months from the last one, just to keep things rolling. I wrote this as quickly and best as I could for the requests I've gotten about updating! THANK YOU SO SO SO MUCH THOSE ARE ALWAYS THE BEST AND ARE WHAT MAKE ME GIVE BIRTH TO THESE CHAPTERS THAT SOMETIMES TEND TO BE NONSENSE. So this is dedicated to: SkyeBlue55 (OMG I LOVE YOUR PROFILE PIC FROZEN WAS DA BEST), Guest, and ZabuzasGirl : ) Bear with me please and I hope you guys like this chapter! P.S. Sorry for the super long note! I babble a lot when I'm tired x) Wayne Manor Saturday Morning \"Arg!\" I yelped, stumbling back a little as the sleek edge of one of Damian's blades grazed my left bicep. A thin line the length of a ruler sliced neatly through my shirt and skin, but I knew right away it was pretty harmless; lucky for the little brat, it was just a flesh wound. I threw him a look, \"Uh, ow . I know everyone says I have to learn to stitch myself up…but this is just getting ridiculous,\" I ended flatly. I barely even got bruised or scratched up during patrols. Training was an entirely different situation. Damian wrinkled his nose in obvious boredom as he rolled his eyes to the ceiling, \"Father,\" he sighed, \"why must I waste my time doing this?\" \"Hey, you challenged me , remember?\" I snorted, using the bow I was currently practicing with (it had been Roy's Christmas present for me) to poke him in the chest. \"I incorrectly assumed you would be a worthy opponent by now,\" Damian said breezily, batting my bow away irritably. \"I misjudged you.\" Pressing my lips into a thin, patient line, I inhaled deeply through my nose and held my breath in a feeble attempt to reign in my growing annoyance. Damian raised his brows at me, snickering quietly. He was baiting me…which I just now realized was the whole point of this specific training exercise. Huh. Bruce's detective/psychology/basically figuring out motives behind stuff lessons were really paying off after all. (Hence why he gave me the entire collection of Nancy Drew novels for Christmas! It was totally an inside joke between the two of us that had to do with Bruce putting my detective skills to practice and a witty comment he once made involving a certain fictional blond detective that I had no idea about until Bruce practically, how should I put it, fangirled about her to me. Ever since then, playing detective with Bruce had never been better.) I let out a swift breath, and in a single fluid motion I reached back, strung three arrows, and let them fly across the wide exercise room to my adorable little brother's face. Well, they weren't literally aimed at his face, but you got the jist of it. He sliced the first one in half with his left sword and swiveled around the second one and leaped over the third one, but the fourth one I'd let loose had a sharp tip, and, to my immense satisfaction, it snagged the collar of his red shirt, securely pinning him up to the wall behind. \"Ta da!\" I bowed smugly to my invisible audience. \"Target: Neutralized!\" Damian scowled and folded his arms in front of his chest defiantly, \"It took you long enough, Todd.\" He yanked the arrow out, freeing himself. Bruce walked in, obviously having been watching from the cameras he kept lying around, and smiled wryly with a nod, \"Good work, Alex. Despite Damian's own progress report on you, you've come a long way in your skills.\" \"Duh, I know that.\" I smirked. Two months had passed and already I felt like I was almost close to being on everyone else's level of awesomeness. Of course it helped that I had all of them to help me out one way or another, even the pouting ten-year-old glaring daggers at me. \"Sooooo…\" I began casually, crossing my fingers behind my back, \"Could this possibly mean I'm not grounded anymore?\" Bruce was thoughtful for a silent pause, then he said slowly, \"No, you're not grounded anymore-\" I fist pumped and let out a small, \"Woohoo!\" \" But ,\" he emphasized cautiously, and I felt my face visibly drop its ecstatic expression, \"you're still only limited to four hours of standard evening patrol. As a precaution,\" he added reasonably when I opened my mouth to protest. \"Bruce,\" I sighed, folding the collapsible bow in my hands. Might as well get straight to the point. \"I know I, y'know, got kinda angry when we ran into the Riddler again a couple weeks ago. And attacked him so hard I shattered his collarbone and unintentionally gave him a concussion too. I'm not gonna lie and say I feel bad about doing that because I actually felt pretty great doing it-\" I saw his and Damian's expressions and quickly switched trajectory, \"Um, what I'm trying to say is I won't let anything like that happen again,\" I hastily mumbled the last part, already getting the feeling that my brilliant speech wasn't gonna get me anywhere I wanted. Bruce cast a silent, communicative look to Damian, who received the message and rolled his eyes a little as he turned to leave the room. As Bruce opened his mouth to speak, I blurted out another feeble attempt to explain myself, \"I get what I did was wrong, really wrong. I didn't mean for it to happen. But I just, I-I got this instinct; it was like an impulse and, and I was suddenly furious and I couldn't contain it and, and it was…dumb.\" I ended lamely, \"I'm sorry. It was dumb.\" But he deserved it , I added silently to myself; it was basically what I'd said that same night Bruce had scolded me for what I'd done, except this time I didn't sound cold and menacing, which was a relief. Bruce's eyes watched me pensively before exhaling a small breath. \"You need to be careful, Alex,\" he finally said calmly, genuinely concerned. \"You are doing great. But you can't afford to be reckless in this job. Nor let emotion cloud your judgment. Don't let it happen again.\" With a last reassuring grip of my shoulder, he turned and walked out of the room. \"I'll try,\" I muttered to no one as I picked up the scattered arrows all over the room and put them back in my quiver. 0o0o0o I strolled into the kitchen, scanning the place for anything that could satisfy my growling stomach. And maybe boost my soured mood. \"Aw c'mon Jaybird, I totally deserve the last brownie!\" There was a scoff from Jason, \"Back off, Harper. I put the blood sweat and tears into helping Alfred make these.\" \"Uh. I hope not literally. Because that's just gross.\" \"You already ate like fifteen.\" \"Okay okay look. We'll settle this. Like men .\" Roy held a fist up, and Jason mirrored him. As they initiated their first round of Rock Paper Scissors, bounded towards the kitchen island and snatched the last giant piece of brownie, holding it up triumphantly, \"And Alejandra wins! The crowd goes wild!\" Grinning, I plopped down into the empty chair beside Jason and took a big bite into the delicious chocolatey goodness. \"That's a foul, young lady!\" Roy pointed accusatorily, and Jason gave a lopsided smirk. \"No it's not,\" I argued playfully, sounding muffled from the brownie, \"I used your distraction to my advantage and gained the upper hand. Basic battle strategy!\" \"My basic battle strategy is that my fist can totally punch through Jaybird's flimsy paper here.\" \"Oh c'mon Roy she just had practice with batboy.\" He pointed at the gauze wrapped around my left bicep, which Alfred had so generously offered to patch up for me. \"She deserves it.\" Roy immediately deflated, \"Okay yeah.\" Then he grinned and leaned forward eagerly with elbows on the counter, \"How're you handling the Christmas present I gave you?\" \"Honestly? I feel like a pro,\" I said wryly through a mouth full of brownie. His eyes brightened as he barked a laugh, \"Ha! Atta girl! If only Claudia could see you now.\" \"Yeah,\" I agreed with a half smile. My stomach suddenly felt a little uneasy. Maybe my mom wouldn't be so happy about what I'd done when I came across the Riddler… So much for the brownie making me feel better. \"Hey Alex,\" Jason said, pulling me out of my own compiling dark thoughts, \"I have something to show you.\" Sharing a slightly confused look with Roy, I got up and followed Jason back upstairs and to his room. (Which, by the way, had a giant pile of books cluttered on the floor between his bed and his desk. I tried sorting through them with Tim one time to look for some decent reading material, and boy, did Jason really love to read. A lot.) He plopped down on the red beanbag chair Dick had gotten him for Christmas and I plopped down on the bed. He fixed his eyes on me, and I raised my eyebrows. \"Y'know, I get why you did it.\" I knew immediately what he was talking about and suppressed a heavy sigh. \"Okay.\" \"I used to feel exactly the same way you did. A lot of times I still do, to be honest. But here's some words of advice I've been given before-\" \"Haven't you been given lots of words of advice before?\" I interrupted dryly. Jason smirked a little, but other than that he didn't address my question; he turned serious again, \"Rage can be a dangerous thing. It's destructive. Like fire that's burning on the inside and roaring through you. Letting off some steam once in a while is good. But Alex, if you keep all that heat locked up inside, and let all that rage fuel you? Well, you'll lose control over it. And it'll consume you.\" I stared at him for a couple seconds before lowering my eyes to my socks and muttering, \"That's good advice.\" \"And I don't want that to happen to you, Alex,\" he sighed, running his fingers through his hair and pushing his hair back. \"I mean you can get as pissed off and angry and infuriated as you want, but don't ever let it become the force that drives you. Either way, you'll have to let it go at some point.\" \"It was just this one time,\" I said, lifting my eyes up to the ceiling in exasperation. \"You know I rarely ever get that angry!\" \"I know that, we all do. This is just a forewarning. In case, you know, it happens again.\" \"It won't ,\" I bit back. But even I heard the flicker of doubt in my own words. What guarantee did I have that emotion wouldn't get the better of me the next time I faced the Riddler? Or if I ever found my mother's actual killer? \"Breathe, Alex,\" Jason suddenly said, and his tone triggered the release of the air I didn't realize I'd been holding in. \"I just miss her,\" I muttered, hating the crack in my voice. \"Believe me, I do too.\" We were both mournfully quiet for a while. But Jason soon dissipated it by standing up and walking to his desk, digging through one of the middle drawers. He stood in front of me, holding up a small pin that was a fiery red phoenix with eagle-spread, golden-tipped wings. \"What's that?\" I asked, curiosity peaked as I took it in my own hands. \"It was Claudia's 'good luck' charm,\" he air quoted, \"She gave it to me before I, uh, died. I've always kept it with me and…it helps.\" Jason shrugged and snorted, \"I mean it's not actually lucky. But it helps.\" I didn't have to ask what he meant by that. \"And…you're giving it to me…?\" I said hesitantly. \"I always kept it pinned onto the wrist of my suit. You could do the same if you want.\" \"I will,\" I smiled gently, wrapping my fingers securely around the only physical reminder of my mom. \"Thanks, dad.\" \"I should've probably given it to you as your Christmas present, huh?\" Jason chuckled. \"I don't know,\" I grinned hugely, \"I thought the paintballing gear was pretty freaking awesome.\" \"Yeah well, it's possibly the only gun Bruce would ever let you handle.\" We both erupted into laughter. \"I was originally going to get you the Titanic on DVD, but Tim beat it to me. And the box of Red Robin brand Kleenex? A genius touch!\" Jason cackled at my sour face. \"It's a classic , okay?! And it was my first time watching it! How the hell was I supposed to emotionally prepare myself for it?\" Even though I was trying to defend myself, I had to fight back the laughter I was holding in. \"Tim is a cruel human being.\" \"His goody two shoes attitude is all just a big act,\" Jason agreed jokingly. \"He's secretly conspiring against the government,\" I threw in. \"And he's going to accomplish it only with his fancy ties and expensive hair gel.\" \"You know I can hear you!\" Tim's voice came from behind his closed door across the hall. \"He totally doesn't suspect we're onto him.\" \"Poor guy doesn't have a clue.\" \"I am a detective, guys!\" 0o0o0o Later that Evening \"Can we stop for doughnuts?\" I piped up eagerly. \"You're really supposed to be sticking to that superhero diet,\" Dick chuckled as he slowed the police car to a stop at the red light. \"Once upon a time I was a street kid starving on the streets. Diets be damned,\" I scoffed. \"Hey I fed you and Eddie!\" Dick reminded me. \"Yeah. Weren't quesadillas the only food you couldn't burn back then?\" \"At least I know how to make a quesadilla, Alex.\" \"I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that, Dick.\" We drove a little further, doing our usual joking and bantering, until we finally got to the front of the Youths' Home. I looked up at the familiar faded building, remembering the first time Dick drove me here because Eddie and I had gotten caught stealing Batman's tires. Damn, that was a while back! Good times, good times. I reached over and honked the car horn twice, sticking my head out the passenger window and hollering, \"But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Eddie Santos is the, uh, night! Fall!\" Eddie almost immediately walked out the door in dark jeans and a white button-up shirt and tie and a pair of black converse. I was wearing something basically similar, but I wasn't going to make girls gawk at me or anything. I mean jeez, leave it to the guy to make a police intern uniform look even remotely appealing. Oh god I did not just think that. I mentally face-palmed myself. Get it together, Alex! \"Did you really just recite the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet to me?\" Eddie asked with a laugh as he hopped into the backseat of the cruiser. \"And subtly called me Nightfall in front of the whole world? How romantic .\" He batted his eyelashes up at me and I shoved him back into his seat, only making him laugh again. \"We just finished working on Shakespeare in my English class. It's kinda stuck in my head.\" I explained a little too defensively, ignoring Dick's all-too-knowing chuckle next to me. \"Where's Nate?\" Dick asked as he drove back onto the street, \"Did he go to see Barbara yet?\" \"They're both at the library,\" Eddie said, clicking his seatbelt on. \"He left like an hour ago so she could show him the new, advanced level tech stuff.\" A little while after Eddie and I officially established ourselves as Red Dawn and Nightfall, Nate decided he wanted to help us out, too, but in his own way. Barbara, from her time spent as Oracle, offered to educate him in the field of all that amazing stuff she did, and that's what they've been working on within the past two months. It was great, because Eddie, Nate, and I were like our own little team. Soon to be, as Eddie had once put it in Barney Stinson's immortal words, \"Legen-, wait for it, -dary!\" (P.S. Eddie and I got obsessed with completing every episode of every season of that show and Dick had actually been able to get me and Eddie each the entire box collection of DVDs, minus the current season, and he'd even gotten the published Bro Code to go with it. It had been yet another awesome Christmas present.) Dick pulled over into the front parking lot of the police station, and we walked up the stairs and into the warmth of the station. It smelled like printer ink and coffee and… \" Doughnuts !\" I exclaimed, pointing at the big pink box with fresh doughnuts in it. Eddie and I shared a glance before we both darted for the table. Eddie beat me to the chocolate sprinkled doughnut by snatching it with that freaking long arm of his. \"Ha!\" He smirked tauntingly at me, and I snickered, elbowing him aside playfully and getting a second chocolate sprinkled doughnut. \"Hey, Grayson's kids are here!\" Someone announced with a chuckle. \"Oh thank goodness I could use some help with the paperwork.\" \"Eddie or Alex can you help me with the printer again?\" \"I challenge both of you to a rematch with some good old rounds of darts!\" \"Easy guys,\" Dick said in amusement, putting his hands on Eddie's and my shoulders, \"they're working on a case with me tonight. Maybe next time.\" We were pretty well known in the police department. In the good way, shockingly! And that was because Dick had recently decided to let Eddie work as an intern (since he was seventeen and was able to get a job; plus, any recommendation letter from Richard Grayson was worth gold). And I was able to tag along because it apparently looked really good for college and stuff as community service because, according to everyone, I absolutely had to go to college . No pressure or anything, right? I also got to work at Wayne Enterprises sometimes, and anything having to do with freaking Bruce Wayne was obviously worth way more than gold. As far as I knew, I could totally get bribed into any college. But of course Bruce wouldn't do that , so I had to get there on my own. Soon enough we were in the cozy office of Officer Grayson. Eddie was focused on a cream file Dick had given him, and I was kind of just sitting in the spinning chair beside him, ignoring my own paper stuff and fidgeting with the pin Jason had given me instead. \"Is that what I think it is?\" Dick asked suddenly, mouth tilting into a small smile as he looked up from his work and at the pin in recognition. \"Yeah,\" I smiled back. Seeing Eddie's curious expression, I held up the phoenix and added quickly, \"It was my mom's. Jason gave it to me earlier today, as a reminder.\" \"Claudia would have liked you, Eddie,\" Dick said, grinning as he stretched in his chair, \"You two share stuff in common, like the fact that she was obsessed with churros .\" Eddie's expression lit up in surprise, then enjoyment, \"Are you serious?\" he barked a laugh, \"Finally! Someone who appreciates its existence as much as I do.\" \"Do you know how many girls would die to be a churro if they heard you say that?\" I snickered at him, \"It's probably the only way you'd ever drool over them, maybe even the closest thing they'll get to making out with you.\" I regretted saying anything the moment the stupid words were out past my mouth, too late to snatch them back. Eddie's expression immediately twisted into an immensely smug, amused, and in my total opinion irritating smirk as he leaned forward with elbows on his knees, \"Are you telling me you'd like to be a churro, Alex?\" he taunted. \"HAH!\" I practically squawked, rolling my chair back by pushing my feet off the table, \"You are way too conceited for your own good,\" I said, pointing an accusatory finger at him. \"It's called self-confidence. Dick gets it.\" \"That I do,\" Dick contributed with a light smile, keeping his eyes focused on his work. \"As if anyone would want to kiss you!\" I scoffed. Eddie's eyebrows shot up and his lips curled wryly, \"Right. As if.\" I felt my face heat up and I scowled because why was my face red ?! \"You are so freaking – \" \"Irresistible?\" \"OHMYGOSH,\" I slammed my palms on the steel tabletop and stood up sharply, ignoring Dick and Eddie's shared laughter as I stomped out past the door. Muttering some very un-lady like words under my breath, I just marched through the bustling office, easily swerving around the occasional rushed person, to get to the coffee room or something. \"Hey Alex, wait up!\" I stopped in my tracks and turned to see Suzanne Carter, one of the operators and another one of Officer Grayson's fans, waving her hand at me while she held a phone to her ear with the other. She looked exhausted and extremely occupied and clearly in need of some help. Suppressing a sigh, I walked back to her post, \"Hey Suzanne,\" I greeted wearily, \"what's up?\" \"I'm sorry, Alex,\" she said sympathetically, obviously having had noticed my irritated mood, and quickly adding a 'please hold', to the person on the other line before turning back to me, lowering her voice, \"This is an urgent emergency call and I need you to find that new file Richard started a couple weeks back and give it to him right away.\" \"New file?\" I echoed, confused. Dick usually told me about all the cases he picked up. Because it was to practice my skills as a detective and also because he trusted me with each an every one of them. So why hadn't he told me about this 'new' file? \"It's supposed to be classified but I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you fetched it for him, right? Commissioner Gordon had it placed in one of the file cabinets in the back room – please remain calm sir, yes, help has already been sent on the way,\" she said to the phone again, hanging up and wiping her brow. Suzanne looked to me again in worry, \"Please get it to him and tell him this recent crime appears to be connected to the case that classified file holds. All I know is it's very important to him.\" I nodded slowly, \"Yeah, okay.\" Giving Suzanne a last reassuring smile, I began a quick stride towards the back room, weaving past the handful of armed officers, most likely the ones Suzanne had just sent to help. Quickening my pace, I burst into the dimly lit room with a push of the door. I began digging through the first few cabinets before finally finding one that had been dated about two weeks ago with 'classified' stamped on the front. I was about to rush back to Dick's office, but paused, looking down at the thin beige folder in my hands. What was it about this case that made Dick want to hide it from me? Feeling my brow crease, I tentatively slipping a finger under the front fold, ready to flip it open. Tensing, I closed my eyes, exhaled, and tucked the folder under my arm as I hurried back to Dick's. Maybe he would tell me about it, maybe he wouldn't. Either way… I was going to find out. Eventually. I pushed Dick's office door open and walked in, tossing the folder onto his desk. \"Before you ask, no I didn't peek at it. Suzanne told me to give it to you because it seems to be connected with something that just happened.\" Dick nodded and took the file, putting it away in one of his drawers, \"Thanks, she paged me that you'd be bringing it.\" I arched an eyebrow skeptically, \"What, not gonna question me whether I'm lying about peeking or not?\" Dick stood up, shrugging his GCPD jacket on and looking at me with bemused blue eyes, \"Of course not. Do you want me to?\" \"No,\" I pursed my lips, \"Just checking.\" Okay, so maybe I still had trust issues about people having trust issues with me. Confusing, yeah, but in my defense, it was because I still wasn't used to being trusted. It was also probably because I couldn't even trust myself sometimes. \"You should go back to the manor then,\" Dick advised as he grabbed his keys, \"Eddie's waiting out by the doors to walk with you.\" I sniffed dismissively and grabbed my red hoodie from the back of the chair, \"Fine, whatever.\" I followed a smiling Dick out of his office and he locked it behind him. \"Why didn't you tell me?\" I blurted quietly when we were almost at the exit. He knew instantly what I was referring to. His mouth pressed into a grim line as his gaze stayed ahead, \"There are some things I'm… recommended not to tell you about, Alex. On Gordon's orders, and because I agree with him.\" I tried not to let too much of my annoyance show through. \"I get that, but – \" \"Just leave it, okay Alex?\" he sighed, \"I can't tell you, at least not now.\" We stepped out past the glass doors into the light drizzle. Eddie was leaning against the light post and he turned his head in our direction as we approached him. Dick put his hand on our shoulders, \"Get home safe. Eddie, you can stay at the manor if you want. I have to go scope out what's going on. Unfortunately, you two can't tag along on this one. Sorry.\" Dick clapped Eddie's back and ruffled my head and turned to jog to the cruiser, where one of his partners was waiting. \"See you two later!\" Eddie and I waited until we saw the cruiser disappear down the block and around the corner. We shared a wary glance before I remembered I was still supposed to be annoyed at him. \"Let's go,\" I huffed, turning around to walk down the opposite side of the street. He easily kept pace with me, \"What, we're not going to follow?\" I was quiet, contemplating for a minute. That had been my first instinct. But I was, I don't know, rattled, I guess? Rattled because my night had gone from pretty normal to pretty weird pretty quickly. The file. What was the big deal about the file? Obviously I could get a clue or two by going to the crime scene and maybe piecing the puzzle myself. But, shocking enough even to me, there was a teeny, tiny part of me that was telling me not to do what I would normally do within a heartbeat. Like if it was a bad idea or something. Or if I was…nervous. Nervous to find out what it all was. Weird, right? Realizing that Eddie was still waiting for an answer, I shrugged and shook my head, cramming my hands into the pockets of my hoodie, \"No, not tonight. Besides, I'm pretty sure Dick's expecting it and he'll be ready to pop out as Nightwing and drag our butts home. And I'm pooped out and I still have to do AP Chem homework and write an essay about Frankenstein the book and I have to go to school tomorrow and ugh .\" I leaned my head back to the thick gloomy sky, feeling the soft swirl of rain faintly fall on my face. \"First world problems,\" Eddie mused, and I could tell he'd chosen to drop the subject for my benefit. Yup. This was why I always failed to stay pissed off at Eddie for even a sufficient amount of time. Not even when he'd first dressed up as Nightfall and nearly put me into freaking cardiac arrest. \"First world problems are easy to deal with.\" I replied, \"Like how when I get to the manor Damian's probably going to argue that it was supposed to be my turn to clean Alfred the cat's litter box. I mean it totally was my turn, but I never go down without a fight. Or a lawyer.\" \"Y'know,\" Eddie began in amused thoughtfulness, \"As much as that kid acts like he loathes your guts, I think he really appreciates having you as his sister.\" I snorted a laugh, \"Did I show you the new battle scar he gave me earlier today? That's a funny way of being appreciative.\" \"Like I said, it's an act. Didn't he give you your own complete sketch kit for Christmas? Based on what you told me, I think that was an appreciative gesture.\" Damian had gotten me into sketching a while back during one of the many times I've been grounded. He did it because he'd wanted to 'shut up my incessant wining', as he'd kindly put it, and, well, I'd liked it. He'd complained about how I was a horrible sketcher and about how I used up all his utensils and he'd ended up giving me my own sketching set. So, it had meaning behind it; it was for the rare times we didn't spend bickering. Completely bickering. \"I guess you have a point,\" I allowed, \"But the little brat would rather punch my nose in than admit that.\" \"You have a nice family, Alex,\" Eddie said in amusement. \"I mean sure I felt like my life was being threatened when I met all of them,\" he chuckled softly at the memory and the sound made me feel warm in the cold night, \"but that's a great thing. That's when you know you're home.\" Anyone else would have missed the barely distinguishable longing at the end of his tone, but not me. Unable to stop myself, I closed the small gap between us and hooked my arm around the crook of his elbow, \"You're my home, too,\" I reminded him firmly, but gently. He removed his hand from mine, but it was only to wrap his arm securely around my shoulders, pulling me into his warmth. I swallowed. \"No matter how much you can irritate the crap out of me,\" I added jokingly, and it worked, because he laughed, and the sound was enough to melt away the jagged ends of the shadows that always seemed to be reaching out for us. 0o0o0o December 25, 2013 Wayne Manor There it was, the damned plant hanging innocently above from the chandelier. And of course the idiots would have planted one there and I was a total idiot for having been suspicious every spot in the manor except for That. Single. One. Eddie had that usual dumb smirk on his face, and I was hastily looking at everywhere but him. At least I knew I had one teeny lucky star, because no one was around to witness the horrifyingly mortifying scene that was about to take place. I couldn't deny that the stupid little plant wasn't there because for some reason I'd looked up and seen it first. Shoot me please. Before I could try to squirm my way out of the situation or blatantly threaten Eddie's face for even thinking about going with the even stupider Christmas tradition, he'd taken a single step toward me and made my thoughts crash atop one another like the unstoppable force of a train wreck. His hand had reached up and his fingers had barely brushed my cheek, fleet and eyes flickering, and I'd just stared blankly, barely breathing. He'd smiled a little, a soft contrast to the smirk he'd worn seconds ago, and moved in slowly until his head was bowed and I could feel his eyelashes feathering across my cheekbones. I was frozen. And we'd stayed like that for what felt like hours. Then he'd kissed my cheek. \" Merry Christmas,\" he'd said in a hushed voice, dark eyes peering into mine with amusement and honest curiosity and something similar to realization. And it wasn't until later that night, when I'd been lying in bed staring up at the ceiling that I realized two things. One: That was one of the craziest, unexpected, unbelievable Christmas presents I'd ever gotten. Two: I was screwed.[Chapter 19] Gotham City. 9:51:37 Well this wasn't going very well. \"Move!\" I ran forward, shoving Nightfall aside and pulling out a Taser. Clayface roared and loomed even higher over us, arms lifting. Tightening my grip on the device, I pulled the release trigger and three cords shot out, sticking to the muck and sending electric shocks forward. Clayface paused, then boomed with laughter. The shocks were ineffective. Well crap. He grabbed the cords and yanked back with a jerk of his arm. I gasped as I suddenly flew forward and when I was in range he knocked me to the side. My back hit the grimy brick wall of the sewer hard and I splashed clumsily into the filthy water. Spluttering, I sat up, drenched, and saw Eddie was back to flipping and dodging away from the massive clump of mud that we couldn't freaking beat. \"Red!\" he called as he jumped away from another of Clayface's swinging mucky fists. \"I'm fine!\" I dizzily got to my feet, \"Keep him distracted!\" Eddie, now a safe distance away, brandished a handful of crescent-shaped disks between his gloved knuckles and flung them at Clayface. They embedded themselves into his arm, but sank in before they could zap him. \"Don't stop!\" I shouted to Eddie, and he continued to throw his moon disks, backing away as Clayface got closer. \"Get ready!\" He announced, and I sloshed through the murky water towards Clayface's unguarded back. Nightfall leaped up to swing himself from the pipes over Clayface, landing in the sewage water behind me just as I pulled the pill from my utility belt. \"Hey, Claybutt !\" Just as Clayface turned with a growl, I smirked and held up the white substance between two fingers, and flicked the pill into his gaping mouth. Clayface's surprise barely registered before the drug took its effect, solidifying goopy Clay into a sculpture of rage. Feeling my muscles immediately uncoil, I sighed and pressed two fingers to my earpiece, \"Hey guys, uh, Clayface has been subdued. Mission freaking accomplished.\" \"Acknowledged. Return to base,\" came Batman's gruff voice from the other line. \"You're welcome .\" I snorted, \"Red Dawn out.\" \"You know, this wasn't how I expected my first mission to go when you asked me to tag along,\" Nightfall wiped the clay off the front of his uniform the best he could, but it really didn't do any good. He grimaced, holding his arms out to his sides as he dripped mud and water, \"Something tells me I'm never going to get this smell off.\" \"Eddie, we used to reek all the time. Now you're telling me you're not used to it anymore?\" I tsked at him in mock disappointment. \"Well I have no idea about you,\" he replied, mimicking my mocking tone, \"but I've always liked soap, Alex.\" I made him lose his balance and he toppled head first into the sewage water completely. I pushed the wet hair out of my face and smirked at his wide eyes, \"You're right. You reek.\" I cackled, pointing, but Eddie suddenly re-emerged with a wolfish grin and clamped a hand around my wrist, pulling me under before I could even shout out. 0o0o0o0 Wayne Manor. 10:15:22 \"Please take care not to drip too much all over my nice clean floor you two,\" Alfred said as he led Eddie and I in the direction of the Batcave from the hidden sewage entrance. \"Sorry, Alfred,\" Eddie apologized, throwing me a wry, pointed look, \"Sewer monsters, y'know?\" I stretched my arms over my head, flexing. \"Hey Alfred, my suit's been feeling a little uncomfortable lately.\" \"That's a smooth way of implying that you're buff,\" Eddie snickered. \"I am buff.\" I grinned, patting my bicep. Well not like Batman-buff or Superman-buff or even Wonder Woman-buff, but like, physically fit like Batgirl and Supergirl and Wondergirl, etc. You got the picture. \"You seem to have wondrous timing, Miss Alex. Master Richard and Jason have spent their past week busying themselves with adding extra necessities to the both of your costumes,\" he said easily. \"Master Bruce has also brought in new equipment that I'm sure the two of you would require out on the field.\" Eddie and I silently fist-bumped as the LED lights from the Batcave finally spilled over us as we stepped into the entrance. \"Hey guys,\" I greeted. Bruce closed a window on the large computer screen and Jason turned his head to look at me. He grinned, \"Hey kiddo. What took you so long?\" \"You know, I'm starting to feel like you all expect me to know how to take down giant mutants on the first try.\" \"Seven minutes is the maximum amount of time to take down Clayface. It took both of you working together twelve.\" Bruce responded gruffly in that Batman tone of his. \"What's the minimum amount of time?\" I challenged. \"Ninety one seconds. Average.\" \"Duly noted,\" I said sourly. Eddie had peeled off his sopping uniform and stood in a damp pair of boxers and an undershirt which, incidentally, clung to his torso in, uh, nice ways. He ruffled his hair and accepted the ice pack Alfred offered him for his bruising shoulder with a smile. \"Hey, no gawking,\" Jason interrupted me in a sternly mocking tone. My jaw dropped and I whipped my head to him, feeling my eyes bug out, \"Wh-I-I wasn't – what ?!\" I spluttered frantically, \"I wasn't gawking !\" I loudly whisper-hissed. \"Yeah you were,\" he whispered back smugly. \"Was not .\" \"Yuh-huh.\" \"Nuh-uh.\" \"Yuh-uh.\" \"Nuh-uh.\" \"Yuh-uh.\" \"Nuh-uh.\" \"Yuh – \" \"Oh my god I just want some pie, somebody !\" My loudness echoed off the hollow cave walls, disrupting a couple of the bats somewhere. Eddie and Alfred blinked at me blankly, Bruce was uninterruptedly typing away at his computer, and Jason looked like he'd just won a round of Call of Duty against Damian. \"Please,\" I grumbled the last part. \"Perhaps you should shower first,\" Alfred suggested, wrinkling his nose slightly as he held Eddie's suit pinched between two fingers, a slight distance away from himself, \"The both of you.\" Giving Jason one last glare (which only made him look all the more entertained), I ascended the stairs that led out of the Batcave and to the grandfather clock. 0o0o0o I felt exhausted the moment I was out of the hot shower and into a pair of sweats and a cotton t-shirt. Alfred had given me some of yesterday's apple pie (bless him), and I sat on the couch in the den, devouring it. Just then Damian strolled in and I stopped mid-fork to give him the 'if-you-so-much-as-peep-I'll-throw-whatever-is-in-my-hands' silent stare. But the little brat knew I was currently too starved to give up my pie just like that. \"If it took you that long to take down Clayface, I'd like to think about how you'd do against a real monster,\" he jibed. \"Sorry I was raised like an almost normal kid instead of like an assassin at the ripe old age of baby ,\" I scoffed back, shoving another forkful of pie into my mouth. \"-Tt-\" he clicked irritably, and settled down into the other couch, where Alfred the cat magically appeared to curl up on his shoulders. I saw him relax slightly as he began to run his fingers through the cat's sleek fur and, surprisingly enough, he stayed quiet. Deciding not to ruin this sudden miraculous stroke of luck (which actually have been happening occasionally), I lowered my arched eyebrows and sank back into the couch, cleaning off my plate with the fork. But the silence, although admittedly peaceful, was suddenly unbearable. Silence made me think about stuff. And thinking about stuff led to questions. Questions that needed answers. Answers that I needed. Preferably right now. \"So where's Dick?\" I practically demanded. \"Why would you assume that I know anything?\" he replied smoothly. \"You've been following me around like a lost puppy these last few days – \" Damian bristled and hollered defensively, \"I do no such thing!\" Alfred the cat opened an eye, stretched and hopped off Damian's shoulder to find someplace quiet again. I smiled but otherwise ignored his interruption, \"so I know Dick isn't back from his little police investigation trip yet. And I have the feeling you know exactly what it is that he's been up to.\" \"Since when are you so interested in Grayson's line of work?\" \"Since it started getting interesting.\" The file Dick had kept from me was something I'd rather not bring up with anybody. Yet. So far it was just a hunch, and something I wanted to explore on my own. If it turned out to be something, I didn't know what, then I would at least get Eddie to help me out. Damian squinted at me and answered reluctantly, \"Unfortunately for the both of us, Todd, Grayson has concealed this particular case from me as well. He made it clear it was important, and I respect his wishes to maintain it private.\" \"Tch,\" I snorted blatantly, \"No you don't.\" Damian scowled, \"Neither do you! But at least I sometimes make the effort .\" He stood up, \"Who knows. It may one day spare your life, Todd.\" \"That better not be a threat, pipsqueak,\" I called out as he disappeared around the hall. But at this point in time, I knew this family almost as well as they knew me. Damian was covering for Dick, because Damian wasn't stupid, he definitely knew something . Maybe everyone did. In case it wasn't obvious enough, paranoia has always been my forte. \"Miss Alex?\" I looked up at Alfred standing at the doorframe, sleeves pushed up to his elbows. He smiled, \"Would you like to perform the readjustments to your washed suit now?\" \"You're the greatest, Alf,\" I grinned, joining him to stroll down the hall. \"Let's see how much more badass I can get.\" As we descended down the stairs back into the Cave, Eddie (now also clean and in sweats and a shirt) was already standing beside the wide steel table that had dozens of gadgets and high tech equipment spread out, just begging to be used. I jumped over the last four steps, landing forward slightly on the balls of my feet and jogging towards him eagerly, \"Dibs on the electric shock emitting gauntlets!\" I slid to a stop beside Eddie, lightly shoving him aside. I picked up the gauntlet and snapped it onto my wrist, testing it out. White-blue sparks crackled from the pointed ends like miniature lightning. \"Careful with that,\" Alfred cautioned, \"It emits at least 15,000 volts.\" Eddie had picked up a separate gauntlet and studied it appreciatively on his own forearm, \"How many volts does this one - ?\" \"That contains a 100,000-volt stun gun and I highly recommend you set it down before you send someone to the emergency room,\" Alfred advised, starting to take on a worried demeanor. Giving him a mischievous look, I held my arm out towards Eddie, \"Wanna have a Western-style standoff?\" The gauntlet crackled again, and Eddie smirked back teasingly, outstretching his arm at me, his gauntlet charging up, \"It's on .\" Alfred quickly intervened in exasperation, \"For heaven's sake you two, quit fooling around before you get us all arrested for arson.\" \"Arson would be the least of our problems,\" I joked, but set the gauntlet aside anyway. Alfred shook his head in amusement and pulled out a couple of rolled up blueprints from one of the shelves underneath the table. He lightly spread them over the new equipment, and Eddie and I both leaned in for a closer study. \"What's all this?\" Eddie asked Alfred, intrigued. \"Designs made by Master Bruce, Richard, Jason, Timothy, and myself on the improvements of your costumes.\" Alfred handed me a regular-sized sheet of paper with detailed sketching on my Red Dawn suit. So here was the basic list of all equipment and their functions that both Eddie and I now owned, written in no particular order (by Alfred, of course): Utility belt: still has built-in self-destruct feature such as ones in Batman's utility belt Communication device: ear-bug to communicate with allies Grappling hook: a gun that fires a line to swing from one area to another Bolas: an explosive ball that when thrown at an opponent's feet, explode and ties them up in a nylon cord (can emit electric shock with button on gauntlets) Gauntlet: contains eight compartments in which one can store items; each gauntlet's sections contains a lot of equipment, such as sonic or smoke pellets, modified sun disks/crescent moons, knockout gas capsules throwable tracers; right gauntlet contains a 100,000-volt stun gun, and an air driven launcher that shoots darts Tracer: used to attach on opponents to track their location Cuffs: bat-shaped handcuff made of lightweight diamond-impregnated nylon Gas Mask: provides protection against various toxic gases Micro camera: mounted on utility belt buckle, shoots photographs Smoke pellets: used to conceal one during entrances and exits Re-breather: allows one to breathe underwater or in a vacuum Thermite grenades: can burn through most materials Sun disk-shuriken(for Red Dawn) & Crescent moon-shuriken(for Nightfall): same purpose as batarangs; each designed like a boomerang and all with a boomerang effect, vary in sizes and effects Goo gun: gun that fires adhesive substance to incapacitate and opponent Laser torch: a laser that cuts through almost any material Oxy-acetylene torch: a newer version of the laser torch First aid kit Miniature mines: small explosives that detonate on touch Line gun: stronger version of grappling gun in which the top clamps onto a big surface Lock picks: stored in gauntlets Miniature smoke grenades: allow one to conceal themselves from enemies Radar: kept on buckle, emirs radar wave Taser: can incapacitate and opponent by means of non-lethal electrocution Stun grenades: a grenade that emits bright light, loud sounds, and stuns opponents Remote control: controls motor bike and other vehicles, and WayneTech satellites Mini computer: computer connected to WayneTech communications satellite Money: whatever currency is needed Note: Your suits have excellent protection against damage, made of Nomex fireproof, triple-weaved material lined with Kevlar and insulated against electricity. Have been readjusted for a fighting style of \"move more get hit less\" and has less armor to facilitate this (though armor can be added when facing fast and strong foes). Suits are also light-sensitive, darkening when there is more light in the area. Your masks include built-in-radio transmitter/receiver and Starlite night-vision lenses; it has a computer link and analysis. The lens can zoom and magnify vision. It also has electromagnetic vision, which includes thermal, sonar, and x-ray vision (Eddie Santos do not get any silly ideas please). Your boots contain eight compartments in which you can store items (same function as gauntlets). Boot compartments carry the important equipment such as antitoxin assortment, brass knuckles, signal flares, wireless listening devices, small halogen flashlight, pair of small knives, the mini-computer equipped with fax, modem, GPS and a mini-disk rewritable drive. Another note: Your motorbikes are built with many parts like those on the Batmobile, such as bulletproof armor and wireless network connections. Drive safely. \"WE'RE GETTING MOTORBIKES!\" I practically shrieked as I shook Eddie in vigorous excitement. \"Too bad you don't have a license,\" Eddie reminded me wickedly. \"Shut up, Santos. I'm a vigilante and vigilantes don't need to follow the law.\" \"But decent fourteen-year-old young girls do,\" Alfred pointed out with a twinkle in his eyes. \"I'm almost fifteen,\" I retorted. Really, the birthdate was coming up in about a month. \"Whoa what a huge difference that'll make.\" \"Your sass is uncalled for.\" \"It's my charm.\" \"You may as well get a permit,\" Alfred suggested, wiping his hands with a cloth and taking care to roll his sleeves back down. \"It won't harm anyone.\" \"Only the entire population of Gotham City, of course.\" Eddie smirked. \" Sass .\" 0o0o0o After hanging out for a while longer, Eddie got a ride to the youths' home from Alfred to the orphanage, which pretty much left the entire manor to myself. Bruce and Damian had gone out to do the dynamic duo thing for tonight, Tim was catching up on some Z's on top of his pile of homework up in his room, and Roy and Jason had kinda just disappeared. I sat at the kitchen island, clinking my spoon as I stirred my chocolate milk in my glass. Glancing at the time on the steel microwave, I saw it was almost eleven and decided to get some reading done, since everyone in this family has thrown books at me to read because it was their personal favorites (Bruce: The Great Gatsby; Jason: Les Miserables; Dick: The Unbearable Lightness of Being; Damian: Catcher in the Rye; Tim: Anna Karenina – which he was currently reading). Did they take into account that this and a majority of the other dozens of books they suggested were intended for AP Literature students and that I was not in AP Literature? \"Irrelevant,\" Bruce had said that morning while reading the paper and sipping from his coffee mug. I took my chocolate milk upstairs, smiling when Titus emerged from snoozing in the hallway to trot beside me. I passed Tim's half-opened door and poked my head inside. Sure enough, he was sprawled atop his bed with his left arm draped over his face, the weathered paperback of Anna Karenina dangling from his limp right hand. Snickering quietly at his slacked jaw and the small line of drool trailing down his chin, I soundlessly stepped inside the ridiculously tidy bedroom and clicked the bedside lamp off. I slipped the chapter book from his hand and left it on his equally organized desk. Then I tiptoed back out into the hall where Titus was waiting for me. Shutting his door silently behind me, I raced Titus down the remainder of the carpeted hallway to my own room. Kicking the door closed behind me, I plunked my glass of chocolate milk on my bedside table, which was cluttered with books and loose papers and some jewelry a lady friend of Bruce's had suggested him to get for me. I think Jason had said her name was Selina? Something like that. I'd never even met her, but she definitely seemed pretty important to Bruce, from what little was hinted to me, wink wink . I catapulted myself onto my bed, landing with a bounce, and grabbed The Great Gatsby from underneath my pillow, flipping it open to the folded page where I'd left off; I actually really liked it. Gatsby was a character to grow fond of. I read until it gradually started to get harder to focus on the small print without blinking for too long. Yawning, I tossed the book onto the floor and rolled onto my back, rubbing my eyes with the heel of my palm. Pulling the plush pillow under my head, I buried my face into it and closed my eyes. I was close to falling asleep when a very low, barely audible, muted thump reached my ears. I bolted upright, my skin practically prickling with acute awareness. It sounded like it had come from downstairs. …Maybe Alfred was back? I lithely rolled off my bed, unusually wary, and stepped around a drowsing Titus. \"Some guard dog,\" I mumbled as I creaked the door open. The hallway wasn't any different; the dim lights emitted a low warmth and the doors were still closed, including Tim's. My skin was still doing that prickling thing. I darted back inside my room, snatching the Kris blade from one of the drawers in my desk, and glided down the length of the hallway to the edge of the staircase. Keeping the knife down at my side, I pressed by back against the wall and peeked around the corner to do a quick scan of the entrance room. The double doors were shut and locked, just like Alfred had left them, and everything else remained undisturbed. In this area, anyway. I slid easily down the banister and leaped off at the end in a crouch, rolling and getting to my feet closer to the corridor. I tried sticking to what shadows the low lights of the lamps gave me, which was doable enough. After scouting out nearly everything in the first floor, and seeing nothing out of the ordinary, I finally deduced that I really was turning paranoid. I straightened up and turned around to head back upstairs, when I suddenly heard a faint clink on the large window behind me. Whipping around and holding my knife ready, I threw the curtains aside. And there was nothing. \"What are you – \" With an angry shout, I whirled around to smash my elbow into his jaw, upper cutting him and then twisting his arm to pin it behind his back, keeping my knee on his spine as I knocked him to the floor and my knife at the base of his neck. \"Alex!\" Tim let out in a strangled voice, \"What are you doing ?!\" Blinking rapidly at the back of Tim's head, I scowled and let him go, \"You nearly scared the crap out of me!\" He rolled onto his back with a groan and flipped to his feet. He rubbed his jaw and his eyes flickered to the blade in my hand. His eyes widened and he raised an eyebrow, \"What are you doing?\" he demanded for the third time. \"I – uhh,\" I deflated and mumbled, \"I thought I heard something.\" \"Something…?\" Tim prodded skeptically. \"Just something.\" I repeated, narrowing my eyes at the floor. \"But it was nothing, apparently.\" Tim watched me curiously before saying, \"Well there's always some form of crazy ruckus going on around here. You and Damian fighting, Roy and Jason acting like three-year-olds, you and Jason acting like three-year-olds, you and Jason and Roy acting like three-year-olds siding against a fighting Damian, Jason yelling at Dick to stop singing whatever Disney musical he can't get out of his head – \" \"I get it,\" I interrupted flatly, lightly batting the hand he was counting off of away. \"I'm just saying, you're not always used to quiet like this,\" he joked. He had a good point. I've always lived in a noisy environment. Which was why learning Batman's silent ninja ways had been a bit unnerving to me at the beginning of my training. \"Besides,\" Tim added reassuringly, \"Nothing and no one can get past Batman's security measures unnoticed. He's much more paranoid than you are.\" I nodded with a smirk, relaxing a bit at his words. \"Truer words have never been spoken.\" \"Well,\" he said as we walked out of the den, \"I came down here to make myself some chocolate milk. You want some?\" \"Nah. I had some already.\" I waved dismissively at him as he was about to head into the kitchen, \"G'night, Tim.\" \"Alex?\" I turned around, walking backwards, \"Yeah?\" He smiled, \"Thanks for tucking me in. I'd never imagined having a little sister to do that.\" \"I know. I'm great.\" I snickered, and faced forward again to bound up the stairs, but stopped, remembering, and called out to him, \"Hey Tim?\" His head popped back out, \"Hm?\" \"Do you happen to know where Jason and Roy are? They left without telling me anything.\" Tim's expression softened slightly, \"They went to visit your mother's grave.\" \"Oh,\" I said lamely after a pause. Well, that explained it. Jason preferred to visit Claudia's grave on his own. Roy would tag along anyway, because Claudia had been a part of his life, too, and because he was Roy. Me? I didn't visit much. I wasn't…comfortable with it. Not even after all these years. \"Thanks,\" I said to Tim, and continued up the stairs. I lied on my bed staring up at the bedpost for what felt like an immeasurable amount of time. I'd heard Alfred's car pull up into the garage a while ago and the front doors of the manor open and close clearly as he came back from dropping Eddie off. I'd also heard Tim's bedroom door close a little while after that. Then I'd heard Jason and Roy enter the manor as well and their voices before Roy went into his own room. So I was able to confirm that my hearing was still perfect. I wasn't crazy, right? There was a gentle knock at my door, and I sat up as Jason cracked it open a little. He saw me awake and opened it all the way. \"Hey,\" he whispered, \"Can't sleep?\" I shook my head. He stepped inside, closing the door behind him, and knelt to rub Titus's ears before sitting at the edge of my bed. \"Did Alfred explain all the new weapons to you guys?\" he asked with a smile. \"He gave us a list. 'Two copies for each of us in the likely case that we lose one',\" I quoted in a flawless British accent. He chuckled, \"Good.\" I noted that his jacket smelled like earth and a type of flower I couldn't quite place. \"Her anniversary is coming up, isn't it?\" I said tentatively. There was a short silence. \"I got her Spanish bluebells. Most people settle for roses.\" His mouth quirked up a little at some memory to himself. My mom died two weeks before my tenth birthday. I spent it at the hospital in a short-term coma, recovering from that so-called car 'accident.' Sometimes it was complicated knowing how to feel during that entire one month. \"You okay?\" Jason asked gently, seeing my expression. \"I'm just a little tired,\" I mumbled, so he wouldn't hear the slight quiver in my voice. He pulled me into a tight, soothing hug, \"'Night, Alex.\" \"'Night, dad.\" As I lied under the covers, alone again, I had one final thought before being pulled under by sleep. Before my fifteenth birthday arrived, I was going to find my mother's killer. And only when I had him face to face would I decide what to do to him. I was going to do this. No matter what it cost me.[Chapter 20] Gotham Academy. It was not unusually hot, so today was the one day I didn't totally mind the skirt. The heat was sweltering and the small hairs at the nape of my neck stuck to my skin with sweat. The tie around my collar was loose and my ponytail was a mess and my shirt was wrinkly and I was otherwise in haphazard conditions. It was lunch, and I was sitting with Tim at one of the tables on the quad. The stupid umbrella was doing anything but its job, failing to provide any bit of cool shade. Tim's face was slightly flustered and he tugged continuously at the front of his shirt, fanning himself. \"Okay,\" his glasses drooped a little on his nose as he read my pre-planned schedule for the next year, \"You're taking English, World History, Chemistry, and AP Calculus AB – that's great! Oh, and physical ed.\" \"For the last year, thank god ,\" I groaned, \"It's a waste of my time.\" \"Kindergarten stuff,\" he agreed. \"I recommend you take Black and White Photography to get your tech credits out of the way.\" \"I heard that's a boring class,\" I deadpanned. \"It keeps you busy. You get a free period for taking pictures, then you develop your film – \" I snapped to attention, \"Film?! We are living in an age where advanced technology thrives! Just look at the freaking Bat Computer. You're telling me I have to develop film ?\" \"It's a tedious process but – \" \"Whatever. Can't I take digital imaging? Then I can Photoshop your face onto a camel's body.\" \"…I…have no idea how to respond to that.\" \"This heat is killing me, can we please go sit in the shade on the grass?\" \"I'm meeting my friends outside anyway,\" he said, handing me my schedule form back and taking his glasses off. \"We're going out to get ice cream.\" \"Mind being a good older brother and bringing me back some?\" I asked, shielding my eyes from the sun. Then, for good measure, \" Por favor ?\" He stood up, slung his book bag over his shoulder and smiled, \"Double chocolate chip? You got it.\" \"Thanks. I'll have to find another senior next year to do stuff for me.\" \"Good luck with that.\" He ruffled my head and left, \"See you after school.\" \"Actually!\" I called out, and he turned around, \"I'm hanging out with Nate after school today. We made plans.\" He cocked an eyebrow and then shrugged, \"All right. Just don't get home too late or Jason will have my head. For some reason everyone thinks I'm your babysitter.\" I grinned. \"Aren't you?\" He snorted and waved a hand as he left. 0o0o0o0o Troubled Youths' Home \"New cellphone, new laptop. Babs is really spoiling you, isn't she?\" Nate smiled as he typed away at his computer – the top-notch expensive kind. \"We've grown really close,\" he said, \"And those are just my heard-earned rewards for being her protégé.\" \"Have you already hacked into the – \" \"Yes.\" I cocked an eyebrow as I spun in his chair, \"You didn't even know what I was – \" \"Yes.\" I snorted, fanning myself by tugging at the collar of my shirt, \"Are you almost done yet? I'm going to suffocate in here.\" \"The air conditioner's broken,\" Nate said apologetically. His eyes didn't leave the screen. \"You know, we could have easily done this at your place. Better yet,\" he pushed a last key before turning in his own chair to face me, \"Why didn't you just do this yourself? I know you know how.\" \"Are you kidding me? The manor is pretty heavily monitored. 'Pretty' being a majorly low understatement.\" I grimaced a little, \"I don't want anyone figuring out what I'm doing.\" Nate seemed to contemplate this for a few seconds. \"But…\" he said slowly, as though gauging my reaction, \"you told me.\" \"And don't make me regret it,\" I warned, jabbing a finger into his chest. \"Can I at least know why?\" he asked, peering at me curiously. His face was a little flushed from the heat and it made some of his blond freckles disappear. I retracted my hand and leaned back against the chair, \"I don't know, I just feel like you wouldn't rat me out?\" It was kind of true. Even Eddie would probably immediately say something to Jason or anyone else from my family if I was getting myself into a sketchy situation. Which I was. I knew it was because he worried about me, I knew it was because everyone worried, but I didn't need them to intervene. But, I also needed at least one person to know what I was working on. In case anything, y'know, happened to me. And Nate just felt like the right person. There was a small beep from his computer, and we both sharpened to attention at the same time. I leaned in to glare at the screen and Nate clapped his hands together triumphantly, \"YES!\" he hollered, \"We are officially in Gotham City's private Hall of Criminal Records.\" \"Took you long enough,\" I gibed mockingly. He smiled at me, \"You're very welcome.\" His hands hovered over the keyboard again, \"Okay, give me a date.\" \"June 8, 2009,\" I replied automatically. Nate typed it in, and the entire screen scrolled down an infinite list of newspaper clippings and photographs tagged under the same date. \"Looks like June 8 was a busy day for Gotham,\" Nate murmured. I tensed, \"Seems that way.\" \"We'd better get reading.\" He began to scroll to the top again, but I suddenly grabbed his hand, stopping him. He jumped a little in surprise at the contact. \"What's that?\" I pointed at the photograph of a car wreck. He clicked on it and the article filled the screen. After scanning every word and double-checking the names, I frowned, \"It's not this one.\" We looked at a few other vehicle/motorcycle/bus incidents on the freeways, on the streets, on the bridges, and didn't find anything relevant until – \"Stop,\" I said a little too sharply. I held my breath as Nate clicked on the image of a demolished red Honda car. The headline read in capital bold letters: YOUNG WOMAN AND NINE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER IN TERRIBLE CAR CRASH I felt Nate's eyes flicker to my face. I clenched my jaw as I scooted my chair closer to his and began to read. Little is known about the tragedy that has occurred on this night on the infamous street Crime Alley, other than that a young woman in her mid twenties died in this horrible car wreck [see photograph above]. Police at the crime scene came to the deduction that a larger vehicle crashed into the car, panicked, and drove off to avoid legal confrontations. This is Gotham, after all, and the possibility is hardly far-fetched. However, hope blossomed from this nightmare as well. The young woman's nine-year-old daughter, having had attained severe injuries and fractures upon impact, had been proclaimed to have ceased, when she surprised everyone by defying death. She is currently residing in one of Gotham's finest hospitals, alive and initiating the long-term battle of fully recovering. Police have dug into her data, and confirmed that she is now an orphan. Jim Gordon informed us that he hopes to get to the bottom of this tragic incident, and to incarcerate the criminal guilty of everything the child has lost in the blink of an eye. \"Gordon.\" I pushed out of my chair and snatched my backpack from off the floor. I threw the door open, but Nate caught my elbow firmly. \"Alex –\" \"I'm such an idiot!\" I exclaimed, \"Why didn't I ever bother to ask the only freaking Commissioner of Gotham there is?!\" \"Maybe he's just as in the dark as everyone else,\" Nate explained, trying to soothe me. \"How is it that everyone is in the dark?\" I shouted, pulling away from him, \"How is it that no one knows what really happened?\" Nate was silent. Slinging my backpack over my shoulder again, I looked up at him, \"Are you coming or not?\" He sighed, went to close his laptop, and closed the door behind us. 0o0o0o0o Gotham City Police Department \"Well, I haven't seen you in a while,\" Jim said, looking up at me from behind his glasses. \"I tied up those two idiots for you yesterday,\" I replied crisply. Gordon didn't know about my secret I.D., but lately I've been catching people out in the open in the middle of committing like a robbery or a street fight or something. Basically all of Gotham knew I was able to handle myself due to my background, so it didn't blow my cover at all. It just made me look like a badass princess, as the tabloids would occasionally put it. I didn't mind the \"princess\" part too much so long as the \"badass\" part was kept as the adjective. Gordon nodded in some amusement, \"And left them dangling from the street light. You're certainly building up a new reputation quickly.\" He fixed some papers on his desk, \"So what brings you here today of all days?\" I pulled out a chair and plopped into it, kicking my feet up to rest on the corner of Jim's desk. He eyed my boots with a grimace. \"Are you familiar with a particular car wreck that occurred on the night of June 8, 2009? On the street otherwise known as Crime Alley.\" I saw his eyes flicker in recognition. \"What about it?\" \"Was it really an accident?\" My voice sounded dangerously calm, even to me. He measured my expression carefully. Then he got up. \"Follow me.\" We headed for the back of the station, and I immediately recognized the way to the room where I'd found the file. It was starting to get a little hard to breathe. \"Grayson personally asked me to not tell you about this – \" \"What?\" I interrupted incredulously, \"But, he told me he was under your orders to not tell me.\" \"He has his reasons, but I'm also sure you have your own. How well do you think you can keep a secret? And, how well do you think you'd be in the field of detective work?\" \"Better than you think.\" Gordon felt around his coat pocket for his keys and pulled them out, jamming one in the doorknob and twisting it open. He went over to a cabinet file – the cabinet file, and pulled out, surprise surprise, the file. I licked my lips nervously and pushed some loose strands of hair out of my face. I joined him as he flipped a lamp on and plopped the manila folder open on a rusted table pushed up against the wall. \"This is all our unit was able to find. It was declared a cold case. That is, until Grayson picked up a lead a couple weeks ago.\" I flipped through the photographs and papers quickly. It was the same information Nate had dug up on his computer. I feigned interest anyway; Gordon didn't need to know he'd hacked into their system. \"And he's off pursuing that lead,\" I said quietly. It wasn't a question. Gordon pushed his thick glasses further up his nose. \"Yes.\" \"Why didn't he tell me any of this?\" I hissed, my palm slamming on the table top, \"I deserve to know! I'm – \" I pointed to a photograph of the car wreck, at the ruined and bloodied backseat, \" I was in this accident! \" \"He wanted to protect you. Like any parent would.\" Gordon said sympathetically. \"He's not my parent,\" I immediately snapped, and I regretted it instantaneously. I huffed, rubbing my eyes with the heel of my hand hard, \"I mean, he is . He really is . But…\" I groaned and then frowned at the file, \"What would he possibly be protecting me from? The truth?\" I scoffed, \"Taking into account all the circumstances of my life, at this point I can truthfully say: I can handle the truth .\" \"Then maybe he wants to protect you from something else.\" I raised an inquiring eyebrow at him, \"So why did you decide to tell me?\" \"Like I said, I believe you have your own reasons of knowing.\" Gordon smiled kindly, \"You're a good kid, Alex. From what I've heard, you've really proved yourself an ally around here in the unit. I think that earns you the privilege of knowing that your mother's death is not a closed case. It's being stirred awake again, thanks to Grayson.\" He put a and on my shoulder, \"So try not to be too rough on the guy.\" \"I won't,\" I said, tightening my expression. \"But I will on the monster who turns out to be my mother's murderer, and who tried to do the same to me.\" Gordon's expression was a little sad mixed with some worry, \"Revenge – \" \"I know the speech, Commissioner,\" I interrupted curtly, shrugging his hand off my shoulder. \"What I end up doing or not ultimately rests on me. There'll always be consequences, and I'm perfectly okay with that.\" With that being said, I gave a last \"Thanks\" before walking out the dim room and into the brightly lit hallway. Nate was waiting outside on the front steps. I walked out the front glass doors and saw a pretty blonde girl (she'd probably been waiting at the bus stop on the street) talking to him. Nate said something I couldn't quite catch, but whatever it was, it made the girl laughed a little. Feeling the corners of my mouth quirk up in my own amusement, I decided to give Nate this rare and golden opportunity of flirting with a girl and wait it out inside, but apparently he'd seen me already. \"Alex!\" He called out just as I pulled the glass door open again. I turned and saw him stand. Behind him, the girl's smile lowered a little in some disappointment. Ah man, Nate. \"You ready to go?\" he asked, keeping my backpack slung over his shoulder. The corner of his mouth lifted in an expectant half smile. \"Uh, yeah,\" I said slowly, racking my brain for ideas. I went down the couple steps left between us. He was about to turn, but I hooked my hand in the crook of his elbow to pause him, \"You know what? I can go home by myself. You should stay here and keep her some more company,\" Nate's expression grew confused. I made a point of smiling at the girl, \"Hi! I see you've met Nate here. Great guy. I'll just take this,\" I reached for my backpack, but Nate leaned away. \"Whoa, I'm not letting you walk home alone, Alex.\" He frowned. \"Well you can't let her wait at the bus stop alone ,\" I kind of gave him a forceful look and twitched my head towards the girl. He finally seemed to get it. I reached for the strap of my backpack again, but he leaned away. Again. \"Actually,\" the blonde intervened with a clear of her throat. Nate and I both whipped our heads to look at her. She smiled a bit sheepishly, \"You two are nice, but,\" she thumbed to the public bus slowing to a stop on the street, \"my ride's already here.\" She gave Nate one last sincere but hesitant smile, \"It was nice talking to you.\" She turned and hurried to step into the slightly crowded vehicle. \"Nice going, Nate,\" I chided him once the bus drove away. \"Are you crazy?\" he finally blurted with highly raised eyebrows. \"For what? Trying to set you up with a pretty girl? Yeah, that definitely earns me a one-nighter in Arkham doesn't it?\" He shook his head at me disbelievingly and hopped down the last two steps. \"I appreciate the help, but if I wanted to get myself a girlfriend I could totally do it on my own, you know.\" I followed with a laugh, \"Really? Could you really ?\" He looked back at me, flushed a little, and continued walking with another shake of his head. I snickered and caught up at his side. \"And just for the record,\" he said once we crossed the street, \"I usually prefer brunettes.\" I cocked an eyebrow at the graying sky and pretended to stroke my imaginary beard, \"Duly noted. For next time.\" Nate laughed and shouldered me gently, \"Sure thing.\" \"On a darker note,\" I said, pulling the cotton gray sweatshirt (the red one was still in the dirty laundry pile; Alfred had succeeded in prying it away from me) tighter around me as the cold evening wind started, \"It turns out Grayson is in search of answers for what happened that night.\" \"That's why he's been gone,\" Nate said in understanding. \"And no one else in the family seems to know. Well, maybe with the exception of Damian. But, if Dick never said anything to me, then he probably didn't tell Jason, either. Otherwise…\" I trailed off at the thought of Jason reacting to what Dick was doing in secret. Maybe that's why Dick didn't say anything to him; he didn't want to risk it. \"So, what are you going to do?\" Nate asked, blue eyes attentive and concerned. \"I'm going to go after this case on my own. Without Dick or anybody else from my ridiculously overprotective family knowing.\" \"Are you sure that's safe?\" Nate looked a little more anxious now. \"It's not safe at all. Hell if I care. I've been waiting my whole life for this, Nate.\" I stopped and narrowed my eyes at him, \"You better not ruin it for me.\" \"You're getting awfully good at the whole glaring thing.\" I pushed him, though not too roughly, against the grimy brick wall, his back smushing my backpack. \"Nate,\" I said firmly as I pinned him in place with my forearm pressing on his chest. I had to stand on my toes to look him in the eye. \"I came to you for help today because I trust you not to rat me out. And by that I mean that if I end up abducted or something dramatic like that, you're not going to spill about anything I'm doing. I'm trusting you to trust me to get myself out of any situation I get myself in.\" Nate stared at me, the uncertainty was in his eyes and clearly written all over his face. \"You're not even going to tell Eddie?\" I folded my lips in and let my eyes wander to the streets. \"I don't know,\" I replied honestly. We stayed like that for a little longer. His heart was beating a little quicker than was normal, and his eyes flickered consistently from my face to the sky. \"Fine,\" he said softly, reluctantly, \"I'll trust you. To not die.\" \"I did once, remember?\" I said cockily. He rolled his eyes as though already regretting his decision. It wasn't like I'd given him much of a choice, anyway. I let him go and stepped back. He straightened, massaging the front of his chest. \"You scare me sometimes,\" he said simply. I smiled and we started walking again. \"Where are you going to start?\" he asked curiously. \"Where it all began, of course.\" I said, turning in a full circle while still walking forward. \"Here. In Gotham.\" 0o0o0o0o Wayne Manor. I was back home by six, and while I had expected Jason to be there waiting, I was instead encountered in the doorway by Roy. Tim was at his side, evidently bored and having been forced to stand there to wait for me as well. He raised his eyebrows skeptically at me when I walked in. \"Where have you been?\" Roy asked right away, arms folded in front of his chest. \"Hanging out with Nate,\" I said, closing the half double door behind me. \"Didn't my babysitter over there give you the memo?\" \"Timmy has demolished any faith I had in him as a sitter.\" \"Why should I even have to ask her the specs on what her whereabouts are going to be?\" Tim demanded incredulously. \"Because you're a detective?!\" Roy hollered as though it were the most obvious thing in the world. Which, granted, it kinda was. \"I'm not even her actual babysitter! Sure she sometimes does a wreckless job of it, but she's clearly old enough to look after herself.\" Roy sighed loudly and exaggeratedly as he pinched the bridge of his nose, \"Where's Dick when I need him?\" \"Can I go now?\" I asked plainly. \"I have homework.\" \"So now your main concern is homework,\" Roy replied with his eyebrows shooting upward. \"You could've probably gotten most of it done if you hadn't killed three hours with Newt.\" \"It's Nate . And what's up with all the sudden parental hovering thing?\" I waved my hands around in meaningless gestures. \"I thought that was supposed to be Jason's job? And more importantly, it's weirding me out.\" \"Hey, I'm asking the questions here, young lady.\" \"Where is he, anyway?\" I asked Tim, ignoring Roy's nagging posture. Tim shrugged, \"Bruce said he disappeared just a little after we left for school.\" \"And where's Bruce?\" \"Wayne Industries. Damian's with him. Oh and Alfred went grocery shopping. I was going to keep him company, but Roy made me wait until you showed up just to make a scene,\" Tim said with an irritated roll of his eyes. \"Okay. Scene's over. I'll just get to doing my stuff.\" Which actually wasn't homework. That could be put on hold for the moment. I slid past them and started up the staircase. \"I'll be in the cave,\" I heard Tim grumble to Roy. \"I'll stand here and dwell in my loneliness,\" Roy said to no one as Tim and I vanished. I tossed my backpack onto the floor of my room and took out the articles Nate had printed for me. Tucking them under one arm, I opened the doors of the walk-in closet and pushed some of the clothes on the hangers aside with my other arm, clearing a space. I set the papers down and went back to my room, digging out rolls of tape and colorful string and a small plastic box of thumb-tacks from my desk drawers. I tossed all of that onto the floor of the closet by the paperwork and began rearranging all of my clothes to the front, creating even more room. Exhaling steadily, I put my hands on my hips to gauge the wide wall space I had. I picked up the first sheet – a police photograph of the crime scene – and pinned it to the very center – at the starting point. Then I got to work.[Chapter 21] I guess I'd kinda given up on this, but two people added it to their favorites and two lovely guests reviewed and well that was all it took to get me typing again * cracks knuckles*. HOWEVER, another reason for my super ridiculously long hiatus was that I've been mapping out like a prequel/backstory for this fic. If I do end up going on with it, it'll be about Claudia and Jason in their teens and the five year gap in which Jason is establishing himself as Red Hood and I guess it'll basically fill in the unknowns and whatnot of this plotline. Also, I just wanted to see how well (aka terribly) I could write Jason falling in love. 'Cause honestly, if anyone deserves someone to love, it's Jason. But yeah, more updates on that later? Or for whoever's still bothering to read Red Dawn and Nightfall (seriously, bless you) then you can leave reviews or inbox me or however this works idk. Anyway, * throws arms out * here's the climax of this book! (P.S. Last scene was definitely inspired by Captain America: the Winter Soldier. I just couldn't resist. I love that movie. I LOVE THAT MOVIE SO HARD U DON'T UNDERSTAND.) 00000 I was woken up by a sharp jostle. Groaning, I forced my heavy eyelids open. Blinking the blurriness from my vision, I stared up at the ceiling, waiting for everything to come into focus. And when it did… I wasn't in my room. My body bolted upright in alarm. What … My eyes flickered around, and – how the hell did I end up in a car? My head snapped to the silhouette of the driver. Feeling my lip curl into a snarl, I reached out to grab their shoulder, keeping my other hand cocked back in a wary fist. \"Who – \" The shadow's head turned around, and a streetlight slanted in through the passenger window to illuminate my mother's face. I sucked in a breath and jerked my hand back. I froze. Claudia smiled, but it quickly turned into an alarmed frown as she looked past me. \"We're being followed.\" The déjà vu made something twist sickeningly inside me. I whipped around to look out the back window, squinting to make out a pair of headlights. They belonged to a pitch black SUV. I whipped back around to stare at my mother. A tense expression tightened her face as she pressed on the gas. Daring to stray slightly from the original script, I swallowed and asked shakily, \"Why are we being followed?\" \"Someone wants to abduct us.\" She quickly swerved onto another street. For the first time I noticed the streets were completely empty. Except for the SUV. \"Why? Who?\" I asked quickly. My heart was beating faster. Claudia exhaled and I saw her deep brown eyes look at me solemnly from the rearview mirror. \"She wants to use me– \" Bright lights suddenly blinded us and another vehicle slammed into us from the side and I plunged into darkness. 00000 Gasping loudly, I thrashed around in the tangled sheets and pushed myself into a sitting position with my eyes wide open. I could hear the blood roaring through my ears and feel my heart continue to pound frantically in my chest. Still breathing hard, I put a hand to my forehead and noticed my hair was damp with sweat. \"Shoot,\" I mumbled. Kicking the hot sheets off, I began peeling off my sticky shirt as I headed for my bathroom. Locking the door behind me, I threw off the rest of my clothes and stepped underneath the showerhead, turning on only the cold water. I stood there with my eyes squeezed shut, committing the dream to memory before it could wisp away into the depths of my mind. It was the third night in two weeks that I'd had the same dream, except each time a bit more was added to it; and each time it happened I was always stunned to see my mother. The first night I had the dream, I'd only gotten to the part where I saw my mother's face before something crashed into us and woken me up. The second time, I hadn't thought to ask why we were being followed before we got demolished again. This third time, I finally got something. Even if it was only a tiny bit useful. My whole frame was shivering, so I shut the water off and threw on a bathrobe. Then I walked into my closet, pushing the clothes on the rack aside and rubbing my sore eyes. A decent chunk of the wall was taped and thumb-tacked with my research, all connected with red string. Red because I didn't understand any of it. Oh, and another thing: the dreams started two weeks ago, which was right about when I started this. My subconscious had pretty good timing, in my opinion. I also realized how desperate I was to actually believe what my subconscious was telling me, but I wasn't about to risk losing any details, no matter how minor. I grabbed a blank notepad and pen and sat on the floor, uncapping it with my teeth, and began jotting down: Date of incident: June 8, 2009. Time: 9:22 EST Claudia had said we were on our way to the hospital to visit her friend Seth Levitt. Seth Levitt is Nate Levitt's dad. Jason wasn't with us. Where had Jason been? (Can't remember.) What had happened to Seth? Why was he in the hospital? Who had put him there? Accident or on purpose? We were being followed. By who? \"Someone wants to capture us.\" – C. Why did 'someone' want to capture us? \"She wants to use me for…\" – C. Who is 'She'? Claudia knew who 'She' was. Someone wanted to capture Claudia. Someone wanted to use her for something. Did they want to use me, too? If yes, what did they want to use me for? There were two cars. One in the back. Another appeared from the left. Henchmen? Or was 'She' behind one of the wheels? Didn't 'She' want Claudia abducted , not dead ? Why was it basically a hit and run? Why did they leave us for dead? How did they know when to make their move? Did they know Jason wouldn't be with us? Did they know Seth was in the hospital? Did they put Seth in the hospital? WHO THE HELL IS THEY ?! My handwriting had gotten sloppier and sloppier and I finally tossed the pen and notepad aside in frustration, pulling my fingers through my wet hair instead. I got up, put on running shorts, a plain white t-shirt, and tied on a pair of Nikes. I tied up my hair as I walked out of the closet and checked the clock on my wall – 5:43 AM. I had plenty of time for a seven-mile run before getting back in time to get ready for school. I silently closed my bedroom door behind me and walked briskly down the gloomily dark hallway and downstairs. The whole manor was blissfully silent. I walked out one of the side doors of the manor, and the cold morning air was enough to freeze my skin. I did a couple warm-up stretches, and then I was off at a steady pace away from the manor. 00000 I'll have you know, I didn't get very far. Gotham was already trickling with life, some cars here and there, though most of the shops were still closed and the sidewalks were pretty much cleared except for trash. It was also still rather dark. I rounded the corner at breakneck speed when someone suddenly jumped out at me, grabbing me and pinning me against the wall with my arms down at my sides. My opened to screech indignantly, but a hand clamped over my mouth, and I glared irritably at Eddie. \"Don't yell at me,\" he said simply, a smirk broadening his face. I narrowed my eyes. He let me go. \"Why do you always find the need to do that?\" I demanded, albeit not too harshly. I stepped away from the wall and rubbed my bare arms. I hadn't seen Eddie in the last four consecutive days. (Okay, that was mostly on me due to dealing with my insanity and all. But he hadn't made any move to contact me, either.) Only four days and suddenly he seemed older. The angles in his face were sharper, more defined. His eyes appeared more observant, though also tired. Were those shadows under his eyes, or was it the lack of proper lighting? I felt myself loosen in begrudging concern, \"Uh, are you okay?\" His smirk faded infinitesimally and he rubbed a hand over his face, \"I'm actually a little worried.\" He glanced around the street wearily and focused his attention back on me, \"It's about Dick.\" Of course , I shifted to lean back casually against the brick wall, arms folded in front of my chest. \"What about him?\" \"He told me – well, you know he went out of town to work on a case, right?\" Eddie suddenly looked tense – I could see the way his jaw clenched. \"Yes, I know that,\" I replied coolly. \"I didn't know you knew that.\" Eddie snorted, and I caught a glimpse of his usual self. \"I live with the guy. Of course I was bound to notice he was gone. He told me he'd be out for – \" \"Wait.\" I pushed myself off the wall with my eyebrows raised, \"You live with Dick?!\" \"Alex, you knew that already.\" Eddie sighed patiently. I opened my mouth to protest, but suddenly remembered that yeah, Dick had told me. Right after I'd found out he'd helped Eddie become Nightfall. I pressed my lips together and rubbed my eyes, \"Right. I forgot. I'm sorry. I'm tired.\" \"Well it is barely six in the morning.\" His eyebrows raised, momentarily straying off topic, \"You've been up earlier than usual these past couple of weeks.\" I waved my hand dismissively, not ready to tell him about the dreaming. \"Yeah uh – \" I stopped, \"Have you been stalking me?\" \"Wow. You couldn't have said 'watching out for you,' or something less accusatory and creepy?\" I quirked an eyebrow and said tersely, \"Have you?\" If he'd been following me around at all within the past two weeks, then he probably definitely knew I was up to something. I tried to keep my expression cool. Eddie rolled his eyes to the heavens, then away from me, then directly at me. \"You've sure been spending a lot of time with Nate,\" he finally said plaintively. Uh, okay, I hadn't expected him to say that . \"Well, yeah. What's the big deal about that?\" \"Nothing. It's just – \" he appeared to struggle with what he wanted to say before exhaling loudly, \"You know what? This is kinda getting off track.\" He was serious again, \"Look, about two and a half weeks ago Dick told me he had to work a personal case. He said he'd be out of town for at least a week, and that he'd keep me posted if he ended up needing an extra day or two. So I gave it a week. He didn't contact me the next day. Or the day afterwards. Nothing. It's been two whole weeks and I haven't heard a peep from him.\" He looked at me almost pleadingly, \"I wanted to know if maybe you or anyone else from your family has heard anything from him.\" \"I know they know about him leaving for a case, but I don't think he's contacted them, either. He didn't even tell me about his case,\" I said bitterly, \"I had to find out from Gordon.\" Eddie's eyes widened slightly, \"So…you know, then. You know he's tracking your murderer.\" His voice softened. \"You knew?!\" I immediately shouted. I clenched my hands angrily, \"You knew and you didn't tell me? \" \"Alex – \" \"You're my best friend, you idiot, how could you not tell me?!\" I shoved at his shoulder, making him back up a step. He held his hands up in surrender, \"Because Dick told me not to! Alex, he was trying to protect you – \" \" I don't need to be protected from anything by anyone !\" I snarled. \"Why doesn't anyone get that?\" I pointed at myself, \"This is about me and my mother! I have every right to know everything about this case and every damn right to figure out who ruined my life!\" \"Alex you'd be risking your life all over again. Why don't you ever get that?\" Eddie threw his arms out in exasperation. \"Well guess what,\" I said flatly, \"I've been working this case myself. And am I dead yet? No, I'm standing right here having this stupid conversation with you. And you wanna know why I've been spending a so much time with Nate?\" I noticed his eyes narrow the slightest bit. \"Because he understands me. He was the first one I went to about this and he agreed to help, no questions asked. And no one was supposed to know about this, but I just told you, but apparently it doesn't matter because you knew anyway!\" \"I would have helped you,\" Eddie said heatedly. \"But you said – \" \"Jesus, I care about you, Alex!\" he exclaimed, and I shut up from surprise. \"Of course I'm going to freak out about you dealing with something as insane as this! I always have.\" He pinched the bridge of his nose and squeezed his eyes shut, exhaling. \"But if you'd come to me first, I would have helped you.\" He opened his eyes and stepped closer until I felt the cool brick wall at my back and he placed his left palm against it, leaning forward, \"I'm going to.\" He said sincerely. His face softened, \"Okay?\" I stared at him before relenting reluctantly. \"Fine.\" Eddie didn't budge. Neither did I. Seconds ticked by when finally a small smile eased itself onto his tired face, \"I've missed you.\" \"Yeah. I know,\" I answered with mock nonchalance. He snickered, ducking his head, and my brain couldn't quite register what was happening as he began to lean in carefully, his eyelids lowering sleepily… My watch suddenly beeped and he pulled back abruptly, letting his hand fall back at his side. I felt my hands clench silently at my sides as an unexpected sinking feeling settled in the pit of my stomach. \"I have to get back,\" I said, but my voice came out sounding hoarse. I cleared my throat and tried to shake off whatever it was I was feeling. \"I'll see you after you're done with school?\" he offered. I didn't miss the hopeful-puppy-dog-eyes expression. \"Sure,\" I felt myself smile, then mentally slapped myself. Jeez! Was my immunity to his so-called 'charms' withering away? What was happening to me?! \"Great,\" he straightened, shoving his palms into his jean pockets and grinning almost goofily. \"I'll see you then.\" \"Whatever,\" I grumbled, albeit playfully. And then, wondering what the hell was up with my brain this morning, I turned and ran back towards the manor. 00000 I came in through the side door again, entering the kitchen and aiming straight for the fridge. A small shadow suddenly lunged in front of me, and I reacted immediately – snapping my arm out and gripping their shoulder to slam them back against the fridge. They latched their hand onto my wrist pinning them in place and twisted it behind my back, shoving me face front onto the fridge door. \"Try that again and I'll crush your radius next time,\" Damian said, sounding somehow both irritated and wounded. I felt myself loosen in surprise and a pinch of guilt – he actually sounded like a little kid. He easily let me go (um, also not like him) and I turned around to see him in pajama sweats and a blue shirt. His hair was all feathered up and he looked…small, somehow. And, it made me feel… older . \"Sorry,\" I said softly, because I was and mostly because it looked like he needed to hear it. \"Tt,\" he ticked, and rubbed at his nose with the sleeve of his shirt. \"Why'd you sneak up on me?\" I grumbled, gently moving him to the side so I could open the fridge. \"Why are you so paranoid?\" he retaliated, although not harshly. \"Are you kidding me? Like 99.1 percent of my training consisted of you dweebs jumping out at me to test my reflexes.\" I pulled out the carton of milk and shut the fridge with my foot, setting the carton on the island and rummaging through the cabinets for a bowl. \"Besides, if I hadn't reacted you would probably definitely be chastising me right now.\" I snorted, grabbing the box of Cocoa Rice Crispies and dumping it into the cereal bowl. \"No I wouldn't,\" Damian said glumly. I paused in pouring my milk and looked up at him, puzzled. \"Uhhh,\" I looked around the kitchen, hoping someone else would pop in and handle this weird situation. Nope. It was just me. I sighed, pushed my breakfast aside, and sat on the stool, folding my hands together and leaning forward slightly, \"Are you okay?\" His reserved posture gave away his hesitance, but he pulled out the stool across from me and hopped to sit on it. His eyes lowered to the marble countertop and I was really thrown off – I'd never seen him like this. \"Is something wrong?\" I asked, this time with more concern. There was a long, long pause, me waiting patiently, and I was finally rewarded with him lifting his blue, blue eyes to look at me – and I immediately felt dread freeze through my veins as I recognized the expression in his gaze; it was one I personally was all too familiar with, but not from him. Damian was scared. \"I don't know where Grayson is.\" Silence. I didn't say a word. I was suddenly exhausted. \"What?\" I said hoarsely, rubbing a hand over my eyes. Eddie flashed through my mind and I felt deep sympathy towards him. Damian bowed his head, \"He was letting me keep tabs on him, because he didn't want me to worry.\" I stiffened, feeling a sudden stab of jealousy. \"But I lost him. He vanished. I tried to get a hold of his coordinates, but I couldn't triangulate his location. I've been trying for almost a week.\" \"And you're barely fessing up now?\" I said flatly. Seeing his withered expression, I unclenched my fists and exhaled slowly. \"I notified Todd.\" Damian muttered. My head snapped up and he narrowed his eyes at me patronizingly. \"Why do you think he left three days ago?\" \"Roy said they were going to Star City,\" I retorted, almost daring him to tell me otherwise. \"To pay Oliver and Dinah and visit.\" Damian stared at me for a ridiculously , unnecessary amount of time, and I stared back. \"What?\" I finally demanded acidly. \"Really, Todd, you've fooled yourself into believing that you've mastered the art of keeping secrets, just like any naïve child.\" \"And what are you?\" I snapped back, feeling my temper boil. \"I'm the one who knows them all,\" he scoffed back. \"Yeah, right,\" I scoffed bitterly. \"Fine,\" he allowed, \"I'm the son of the one who knows them all.\" Feeling my anger build and build like a steaming kettle of boiling water, I fisted my hands again, feeling my fingernails bite into my palm. Damian's eyes didn't waver from mine as he said plaintively, \"We know what you've been doing, Alex. You shouldn't take this family as some sort of petty joke.\" Jerking my chair back, I grabbed my full bowl off the island and slammed it hard into the sink. I turned on the cold water at full blast. \"My father caught on to what you were doing about two and a half days after you started,\" Damian continued, \"I figured it out by hacking into the Cave's database, which was where he was keeping tabs on your research activities – using Nate as a shield was admittedly clever, but you couldn't hide behind that long enough. Anyway, Drake caught me red-handed, so that was how he found out. None of us told Todd, though, because we had the common sense to predict how that bomb would go off. So we let you assume you had the lead. My father fed you, or Nate, the information you sought. Small props to you on connecting the clues in your closet, by the way.\" I shut the water off and whipped around, trying very hard to suppress the urge to scream. \"Anything. Else ?\" I bit out through clenched teeth. \"Grayson was defrosting the cold case about your accident,\" he said, with less of a hard mocking edge to his voice, \"I'd known only that, and of his whereabouts since I was tracking him on father's satellite.\" I mentally face-palmed myself because I really didn't care about the technicalities at this point, \"But he's off the grid now. Are you even remotely aware of how challenging it is to get off the grid?\" \"Obviously not very since Dick did,\" I replied sarcastically. Damian ignored my snide comment, \"He must have lost the microchip in his arm. Which means he's in trouble because you can't just lose something embedded that close to your nerves.\" \"Microchip?\" I echoed, exasperated. \"Do you remember when father first took you in and we took you to the doctor for an update on your shots?\" \"Yes,\" I answered bitterly. \"Well one of those injections had the tracker and well that's how father found out – \" \"I get it!\" I shrieked. \"Jeez, I get it!\" I slammed my palm on the countertop and leaned forward threateningly again, \"I need to know where my dad is.\" Damian's face turned serious again, \"Roy is in Star City. He's digging up his own information about Claudia Ramirez. Jason is in New York, where I last sighted Grayson. He's digging deeper.\" \"Why was Dick there?\" I demanded. Damian rolled his eyes, and I ground my teeth in irritation. \"Because that's where your mother lived before she moved here.\" More silence. I sat back down, feeling emotion wash over me in tidal waves. \"Of all the places on the entire planet,\" I mumbled, \"she moved here .\" \"She had her reasons,\" Damian said quietly, watching me. I opened my mouth to ask more, but a strangled sound came out instead, and I buried my head in my folded arms. I squeezed my eyes shut as my brain processed the undeniable fact that pretty much my entire family had kept the truth from me. Boy, I was an idiot. But it was still my mission. \"I'm finishing it,\" I breathed, opening my eyes again. \"What do you mean?\" Damian's brows furrowed. I ignored him, standing up and walking briskly out the kitchen. Just as I swerved the corner, I collided into Tim in his pj's, though my velocity caused him to stagger back two steps. \"Whoa,\" he said, holding his palms up in mock surrender, \"where's the fire?\" Feeling my fingers twitch in irritation, I pushed both hands up and shoved him back further so that he almost stumbled backward into the lampshade. Swiftly balancing himself, he blinked up at me in stunned surprise. \"Stay out of my way,\" I said icily. I felt Damian's wide eyes on my back, but I ignored both of them and marched up the stairs. Slamming the door open, I began pulling and clawing out of my sweaty sportswear and throwing on a pair of jeans and a dark blue v-neck. I stepped into a pair of sneakers, hooked utility belts in an X across my chest and back, and another hung loosely around my waist. I stormed into my closet, lugging out a duffel bag. I snatched random pieces of clothing out of my drawers and threw them in, along with other necessities, and zipped it shut. Looking around my shadowed room for what suddenly felt like the last time, I grabbed my red hoodie from my chair, shrugged it on, and shut the door behind me. I was downstairs again in a minute, snatching a random pair of keys from the bowl near the front entrance and started making my way to the garage door. \"Hey, hey, hey,\" Tim appeared out of nowhere and grabbed my bicep in alarm, \"Alex what do you think you're doing ?\" \"What, haven't you figured it out? I thought you were good at that.\" I replied acidly. He frowned, \"You're not going anywhere. You have school, you can't –\" \"Are you serious ?!\" I jerked my arm free, \"This is my mother we're talking about, Tim! Someone wanted both of us abducted and Dick went missing trying to find out who and Jason and Roy are probably gonna be next and I don't see Bruce anywhere and you're telling me I have to go to school?\" \"Why are you always trying to get yourself killed?\" Tim demanded abruptly, raising his voice. \" What ?\" I said incredulously. \"You do it so recklessly that you're not even consciously aware that you're doing it!\" he pointed accusatorily at me. \"Oh please,\" I snorted, \"This entire family is putting their lives on the line on a daily basis. How am I any different?\" \"You're not doing it for the same reasons we are. We're doing it to protect others, to protect this city.\" \"And I'm not?\" I said icily. \"You're doing it for yourself.\" \"Excuse me?\" \"You're Tim's scowl softened, \"You've died before.\" \"Haven't all of you?\" I muttered with a roll of my eyes. \"In the beginning when Bruce had you see a therapist – \" \"That was only for like two days,\" I interrupted irritably. Tim continued patiently, \"you were given a behavioral test. The test results had been sent back – \" \"No one told me that. Then again, no one ever tells me anything.\" \"You're suicidal, Alex. It's serious.\" I raised an eyebrow, \"So?\" \"It's not normal,\" Tim said, his tone strained. \"Look around! Do we look normal to you?!\" \"That's not the point! You're severely prone to committing suicide and that's why we never told you anything! We knew you'd react like this! Jason knew you'd react like this!\" I felt my jaw drop. \"You never think twice about your own safety – have you ever noticed that? You throw yourself into the fire without flinching because deep down you know you don't care if you never come back! You don't want to come back!\" I felt frozen. And then I felt sick. Because from some shriveled-up corner in the darkest depths of my mind…I knew he'd nailed me. \"No,\" I heard myself whisper. I didn't know if I was denying him. Or agreeing with him. \"I'm sorry,\" Tim said softly, \"But we're not letting our sister leave.\" Something inside me ached. I was tired again. \"I'm sorry, too\" I mumbled. Then I struck out and snatched his elbow, bent it at an awkward angle, kicked his knees out from under him, and used my other hand to strike at the chakra point on his neck. I felt his body slacken as he immediately lost consciousness, and I whipped out a pair of handcuffs from my back pocket, cuffing him to the staircase. I turned around, tensing for Damian, but he stayed in place. \"I'll go with you,\" he said firmly. \"Not a chance little brother,\" I replied swiftly, picking up my duffel bag again and clutching the keys in my hand. \"Then you'll have to waste more time trying to stop me from stopping you.\" He challenged tauntingly. \"Didn't you hear Tim?\" I turned halfway and gazed at him wearily – I really was tired . \"I don't care if I die.\" I could've sworn I saw his expression crumple. \"That's why I'm going .\" He jutted his chin out in resoluteness. I glared at him, then flickered my attention back to a still unconscious Tim. He wasn't going to stay like that for very long. And don't even get me started on his jiggling-out-of-handcuffs record time because it was ridiculous. \"Fine,\" I said, looking back to Damian in his pajamas before turning to stride away, \"You get one minute to change.\" 00000 I'd taken the Lamborghini. Obviously. And no, I did not let Damian drive because I didn't have time to get pulled over by the police and get seriously questioned on why I, a not-legal-adult, was letting an even-less-of-a-legal-adult, drive a super expensive speedy car that was stolen from Bruce Wayne's garage. Though as human beings with the last name 'Wayne' on our records, arrested didn't even dare to exist in our vocabulary. But I didn't need anyone to alert the guy that I was acting like a lunatic or that I had his illegitimate child in the passenger seat with me. Alfred was going to wake up and find out eventually anyway. And by eventually I meant like maybe an hour. \"You better be giving me the right directions,\" I threatened as I drove us completely out of Gotham and onto the empty road – no one sane enough would come into Gotham City. So why had my mom? \"I am ,\" Damian replied hotly, holding my iPhone up and showing me the route on Google maps. \"See? It says it'll take us three hours in current traffic to get there. Tt ,\" he clicked, \"have some faith in me, Todd.\" \"You didn't seem to have any faith in me driving,\" I muttered under my breath. \"What DMV conductor in Gotham wouldn't give any ward of Bruce Wayne's a driving permit?\" Damian retorted. \"Even I could get one.\" \"Are you currently behind the wheel? Yeah. I didn't think so.\" I'd gotten my permit about two months ago. Wasn't that big of a deal. I'd known how to hijack cars when I was on the streets, mostly thanks to Eddie; it was basically the same thing, in my opinion. I pressed my lips together – he'd be waiting outside of Gotham Academy later today, not knowing where the hell I'd gone off to until Alfred or Tim let him know. Nate wouldn't know, either. My fingers tapped on the wheel and I sped up just an inch. \"Don't try my patience, Todd,\" Damian's voice came back into focus, \"We have three hours in this confined space and I'm not about to get in trouble by – \" he cut himself off and looked out the window. \"Murdering me with your pinkie?\" I offered with a snicker. He stiffened. \"Jeez, who would've thought me being severely suicidal would have its perks.\" I joked. His eyes flared as he stared at me, and I raised an eyebrow at him, keeping my eyes on the road. \"Lighten up, will you?\" I jibed, gently elbowing him in the ribs. \"I was kidding.\" He turned away almost angrily. I opened my mouth to ask, but his posture warned me to drop it. It was quiet again. Small raindrops sprinkled onto the windshield from the lightly overcast sky. \"Do you ever think about all the people that actually care about you?\" he demanded abruptly. Okay, I guess he hadn't wanted to drop it. \"What are you talking about?\" I sighed. Then his voice came out sounding so small and confused that I couldn't believe the boy next to me was Damian. \"What did you do to make everyone love you so much?\" \"What are you talking about?\" I repeated, because I was too dumfounded to say anything else. His harsh demeanor returned, and I was starting to get whiplash trying to keep up. \"This family accepted you almost immediately,\" He interrupted me as I began to protest, \"And don't even deny it! Grayson went missing trying to find who killed you and your mother. Harper enjoys playing football with you. Drake always watches out for you at school to make sure you're okay even though no one tells him to do that anymore. Alfred makes chocolate lava cakes because he knows they're your favorite. Todd brags about you all the time like any proud father, and he tells Grayson about how he always regrets leaving you for all those years. And my father? Well, he had no trouble deciding he loved you, too. Why else do you think he let you be Red Dawn? Everyone just loves you.\" He said the last part wounded. I was speechless. \"And…that bothers you.\" It wasn't really a question. \"No,\" he sniffed. \"What bothers me is that despite having all of us, it turns out you're suicidal, of all things.\" I nodded slowly. \"Oh.\" \"It's pitiful.\" I bristled and hit the brakes – which was okay because the road ahead was still empty – making us jostle forward. I put the handle brake on and glared fiercely at a startled Damian, \"Don't you ever, ever call me that. There are over a billion adjectives in the world to describe my life, but don't you ever refer to my life as being that .\" I threatened furiously. I shifted my eyes back to the road and released the handle brake, pressing on the gas. The silence stretched on for another hour, then two hours. Damian had fallen asleep. It was raining. Cars gradually filled the road as we got closer and closer to New York. We made it. \"Todd.\" \"What?\" I said without looking at him. From my peripheral, I saw him sit upright and crane his neck to look out the back window. \"What?\" I repeated urgently. My eyes flickered to the rearview mirror, and I felt like a brick of lead had dropped down to my stomach. \"We're being fol - \" A black SUV abruptly screeched into our lane behind us and slammed us forward. My head snapped forward, and when I lifted my head I saw another vehicle swerve into the lane directly in front of us and backed up, smashing into us. \" Shit ,\" I hissed. The blood roaring in my ears, I put the car in reverse and slammed on the gas, burning rubber, and barely managed to give us an inch of a gap between the two SUV's. I threw the car into drive and hit the gas pedal again, spinning the wheel and screeching away. \"Damian!\" I shouted. He lifted his head dazedly, his green hood flopped over his head. \"Damian I need you to stay down – \" A third black SUV screeched in from our left, bumping its tires against ours and nudging us into the fourth SUV on our right. We were completely surrounded. My mother suddenly flashed through my mind in searing light: \"Someone wants to abduct us.\" Rapidly blinking the memory away and gulping down my terror, I focused on the road again. It was happening again. \"Roll the windows down!\" Damian shouted, reaching into his sweater for something. I did. I held my breath and tightened my fingers on the wheel. Damian pulled out two handfuls of EMP disks and pulled himself halfway out the window. I watched as he flung all four disks in a 360 degree swing, and watched as each disk stuck like a magnet to each SUV. Damian clicked something in his jacket, and ripples of electricity coursed over the vehicles. Just as the SUV in front of us started veering out of control, I pulled out my handgun, stuck my arm out the window, and fired at its back tires so that it steered onto the left, crashing into the other SUV, and they both derailed off the road, crashing into other vehicles. The SUV behind us stopped functioning completely, and so did the one at our right. Cars behind them swerved and honked their horns. I never took my foot off the gas, getting as much ground between us as possible. Damian climbed back in, looking at me in some horror and shock, \"Where did you get that?!\" I didn't have time to answer – I squinted out the severely cracked window to distinguish a small figure shrouded in smoke and rain about a hundred yards away. It was standing right in our way and we were quickly approaching it. The figure was a person, dressed in black padding and black army boots; a mask covered the lower half of their face and black goggles shielded their eyes. They appeared to be holding some kind of giant sized weapon. It pointed straight at us. They fired. Not this time , I thought to myself. Not again . In a split second, I unclipped my seatbelt, lunged for Damian, shot the passenger window, and hurtled us out of the car just as the explosive struck the Lamborghini. The force of the debris pushed us forward, but I tightened my arms around Damian and clenched my teeth as I took the full blunt of slamming onto the gravelly road. We skidded forward a couple more feet before finally rolling to a stop. \"Shit,\" I wheezed out, releasing Damian so I could let the pain ripple through my body. He sat up, looking stunned and with a thin scratch racing across his cheekbone to the corner of his mouth (probably from a shard of glass), but otherwise unharmed. \"Are you okay?\" Nothing felt broken, but my entire frame still ached from the hard impact. The skin of my hands and arms stung sharply from scraping the jagged ground, but my hoodie had kept most of me protected from any minor damage. \"Terrific,\" I bit out, hissing through gritted teeth. \"Just give me a minute.\" His bright blue eyes flickered to farther up the road. He squinted, \"I don't think we have a minute.\" Groaning, I pushed myself into a half sitting position and followed his gaze. Chunks of car parts and fire littered the entire road. Cars halted a hundred yards away or swerved to avoid collision. Smoke steamed from several feet away, and from there emerged a shadow. Fear suddenly spiked its way through my system, and I dug my fingernails into the ground as my breaths grew shorter. Something felt terribly, terribly wrong. The shadow was a woman with long braided dark hair. She strode toward us with purpose. \" Someone wants to abduct us.\" Damian got to his feet and readied himself into a stance. I felt rooted into the ground. \" Who?\" Damian shrugged off his pine green sweatshirt, revealing a black t-shirt and two utility belts crossed in an X across his front and back, with another hanging at his waist. \" She wants to use me as a weapon.\" She dropped the explosive devise and suddenly broke into a sprint, closing the gap between us in seconds. Damian charged forward, reaching into one of the belts to pull out something – but I would never know what it was because she struck out like a viper, snatching Damian's wrist and flinging him away. He soared through the air, but somersaulted and landed in a crouch. He charged again at her back, but she ducked his roundhouse kick and struck his leg out from under him, making him crash to the ground. She lifted him by the collar of his shirt. Damian tried to knee at her stomach, but she smashed her forehead into his and threw him back onto the ground like a rag doll. Then she turned to me. Trying not to visibly quake, I flipped onto my feet. She pulled out a knife from a pouch in her forearm and twirled it in her right hand. I put the shotgun back in its holster and I pulled out the Kris blade from the strap at my thigh. I mimicked her exact motions, switching the blade from hand to hand. I jutted my chin out, steeling myself. You're not my mother. I charged first. 0000 P.P.S. This was all word vomit and I didn't know where to split this gigantic chapter and the next one (which I'm still writing) so I stopped it here. Yes. I love cliffhangers. No. I'm never sorry.[Chapter 22] \" The loneliest moment in someone's life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.\" 00000 New York City A hand creaked the iron gate open. He stepped into the building. Onto the elevator. Got off on the upper middle floor. He found the apartment number. He rested his hand on the holster at his hip, curling his fingers around the familiar cool handle steadily. Taking a stance, he let out a breath, and moved forward to ram into the door. It swung open, and Jason made a strangled noise as he tumbled forward into empty air, crashing onto the floor. His gun clattered away from him. \"You were seriously going to try and crash my door down?\" Jason grimaced and sat up, eyes shifting upward to glare at the dark-haired man looming over him. \"I know he's here,\" he said, getting straight to the point. He flipped to his feet, swiping the handgun off the floor simultaneously and pointing it at him. \"That's because I told you,\" The man said with a roll of his eyes. \"Who do you think activated his tracker?\" \"What the hell – just hand him over!\" Jason snapped, annoyed. The man held his gloved hands up in mock surrender, \"Hey, he can hand himself over. I think he's recovered enough.\" \"Relax, Jason.\" Jason, never lowering his gun, whipped his head around to see Dick – alive and looking an awful lot like crap – leaning against the doorframe of the hallway. \"He's the one who saved my ass,\" Dick said, smiling weakly. \"I thought that's what I was doing,\" Jason said skeptically. (His hold on the gun loosened a fraction.) Dick arched an amused eyebrow, \"You really don't remember him?\" He thumbed to the man. \"C'mon, Jay.\" Feeling his annoyance grow infinitesimally, Jason flicked his eyes to stare flatly at the man, who smirked, albeit rather solemnly. At first he didn't see it. The guy was probably five years older than him. He was Hispanic. He had green eyes. \"No fucking way,\" he muttered under his breath, feeling himself slacken. Then, barely louder, \"I thought you were dead .\" \"I thought the same about you . At least I attended your funeral. You didn't even show up at mine.\" \"You didn't have one.\" There was no body to bury , he added silently in his head. At least now he knew why . \"There was a ceremony, wasn't there? I showed up.\" Hector shrugged, feigning indifference. It was then that the reality actually hit Jason. Hector Ramirez was alive. \"You saw what you did to your sister, then?\" Jason said, his tone sharpening instantly, cutting like knives. \"Don't even start with that,\" Hector said coolly, his eyes flashing as a silent bolt of lightening darted outside, slitting through the parted curtains, \"You caused much more damage than I did, Todd. You weren't there to see it.\" Silence. \"Uh,\" Dick coughed, straightening a little, \"Hector isn't dead, obviously. He never died. He'd disappeared – \" \"I'd gotten abducted,\" Hector corrected. \"It was pretty gruesome.\" \"By who?\" Jason demanded. \"By the same woman who tried to take Claudia,\" Hector grimaced darkly, \"And my niece.\" \"You know about that?\" Jason asked warily. \"…about Alex?\" Hector's expression twitched into a smile. He pointed to his irises, \"She has my mom's eyes. Looks kinda like her, too, from what I've been able to see.\" Jason felt himself nod a little, though he didn't know why. He frowned. \"Wait. What do you mean tried to take Claudia? I thought you – She…she died in the car crash. I'm sorry.\" Hector's face turned somber again. \"No. I'm sorry, Jason.\" Jason frowned, confused. \"She's alive.\" He stiffened, eyes widening. \"…What?\" Dick breathed, stunned. \"I've been meaning to tell you since I brought you here,\" Hector said to him, \"but I didn't know when to bring it up. So I reactivated your tracker and let Jason find you. Claudia did die in the crash. But the woman who took me, who tried to take her, brought her back from the other side.\" \"Talia?\" Jason snarled suddenly, feeling his blood flare. \"Was it her? Did she use the Lazarus Pit? Did she – \" \"No,\" Hector interrupted firmly, \"It wasn't either of the Al Ghuls. And there was no Lazarus Pit involved. I take it you're both familiar with the Court of Owls?\" He glanced at Dick, whose stunned appearance hardened. \"I know you are, Dick.\" \"My lineage traces back to them, particularly to my great grandfather\" Dick confirmed in a stiff mumble. \"What about them?\" Jason demanded impatiently. \"Well, Gotham has the Court of Owls,\" Hector said, \"We have the Order of the Phoenix. Claudia and I are direct descendants from a long bloodline – more specifically from my mother's side of the family.\" \"Does this Order have their own stupid lullaby, too?\" Jason said acidly. He was shaking. \"The Order of the Phoenix is, as you can probably guess, about rebirth. Its ideal is essentially to destroy the old, and from its own destruction to arise renewed.\" Hector smiled humorlessly, \"And they do have an old saying – \" \"Lemme guess: in order to rise from its own ashes, a Phoenix must first burn.\" Jason said snidely. \"For a star to be born, there is one thing that must happen: a gaseous nebula must collapse. So collapse. Crumble. This is not your destruction. This is your birth.\" Hector recited indifferently. \"That's a mouthful.\" Dick said after a dark pause. \"What did your crazy family want with Claudia?\" Jason asked in a low voice. \"It wasn't just her that they were after. They tried to get to me first. So I faked my death in a desperate attempt to shake them off. Wasn't that complicated.\" He snorted, \"Not when you're living in Gotham, anyway.\" \"So you got yourself out of the way so that they could go after your sister,\" Jason flared, \"Gee, what big brother award does that earn you?\" \"That wasn't my intention,\" Hector snapped back, \"They hadn't made a move towards her. Not even after I 'died.' I spent years in hiding, creating shadow identities, but I never once stopped watching out for her. If there was so much as a ripple of a threat I made sure to cover her, you and Alejandra and throw them off your trail.\" Jason flung his arms out, \"And how has that changed anything?\" \"I bought you guys time,\" Hector retorted loudly, \"Years! Alejandra is practically sixteen years old – \" \"And she died when she was nine!\" Jason shouted. He stomped forward and shoved Hector back aggressively, \"Your family killed my wife and my daughter!\" Hector wrestled Jason away from him, \"And are they still dead? Did you ever stop and think why? Did you, or anyone , ever come to an actual conclusion as to why Alejandra lived ?\" \"Because she's my daughter ,\" Jason gritted out. Hector cracked a smirk, \"Ha. Maybe that had something to do with it, too.\" He turned serious again, \"What did I just say about the Order of the Phoenix, Jason? Rebirth .\" Jason paused, blinked, and scowled, \"Can you fucking elaborate on that please?\" \"The Order of the Phoenix recruits its bloodline by killing them. It's not permanent, unless you have barely a trace of that lineage in you. Survival of the fittest. But like I said, it's gruesome.\" Hector took a breath, looking suddenly incredibly tired. Jason was startled for a second at how much Alex seemed to resemble him – with the eyes, anyway. \"Alejandra appears to be a prominent member. She survived the crash, along with my sister.\" \"I buried her,\" Jason said in a quivering voice. \"I know. They got her out.\" Hector said quietly. \"You didn't bury her alive, though. She…she was gone when that happened. See, Alejandra was able to return more quickly because she was small. It naturally takes longer with adults. Overall, if anyone is a strong member of our lineage, we can't stay dead. Or maybe we can. You just have to try really hard.\" \"Who was the woman you talked about? The one that…y'know.\" Jason ended hoarsely. \"My aunt.\" Hector answered simply. Jason and Dick shared a look, both their faces slowly morphing into horror. \"The one you and Claudia lived with ? Carmen ?\" Dick emphasized, baffled. \"No. No, not her.\" Hector's expression saddened, \"She was recruited a couple years back…but she didn't – she didn't make it. This woman, this monster was my mother's and Carmen's sister. But she'd isolated herself from them for years. Claudia and I never even knew about her until our parents died and candidates from our family members were searched up. Only she and Carmen had showed up, and we never knew why since we knew both our parents came from decently big families. They'd erased themselves from history, of course, but they're all still out there. Living as believers in the Order of the Phoenix.\" Hector's expression twisted achingly, \"They planned my parents' murder. Made it look like a random casualty. When they first got hold of me, they tried to convince me it was for the right reasons. Then they,\" Hector blinked rapidly, flickered his eyes angrily around the apartment, \"They showed me my parents. But they weren't the same. They'd been wiped clean. Rebooted. I tried to get away, but I was pinned down and, well…\" Hector removed his gloves and rolled up the long sleeve of his pine green shirt. He smirked humorlessly, \"It got ugly.\" Dick and Jason stared, incomprehensive at first, then they both grimaced solemnly. A sleek, metallic right arm glinted in the muted gray light that filtered in through the curtained window. \"It was a clean cut; honestly for the first two seconds I didn't even feel it.\" He shrugged, \"They old me if I joined, I would be brought back completely intact. I refused. They tried to take off the other one, but adrenaline does amazing things, and I got away.\" \"Why didn't they just kill you?\" Jason asked flatly. \"Wouldn't that have worked anyway?\" Hector's lip tightened and his jaw clenched and unclenched, \"Yeah. Maybe they didn't kill me straight away because somewhere deep down inside the two brainwashed monsters who did this to me, my real parents were still in there.\" Dick ran a hand over his face, looking haunted at everything he'd just absorbed. Jason looked, to put it best, unresponsive. \"Anyway,\" Hector continued rigidly, \"While I can come back from the dead, I can't regenerate without dying first. Obviously I wasn't having that happen, so I made connections.\" He patted his metal shoulder with his good hand, \"Had someone help me build this. Never had any malfunctions.\" Dick nodded in faint agreement, \"Works just great in a fight, from what I've seen.\" He looked to Jason and added briefly, \"I was captured by some members of the Order of the Phoenix. They were brutal, but Hector showed up out of nowhere and busted me out, brought me here, kept me hidden. Apparently I'd been asleep, practically comatose, for a week. Just woke up yesterday.\" Jason watched his brother wearily before turning back to Hector. \"Where…do you know where she is?\" he asked hoarsely, running a hand over his face and through his hair. He felt his shoulders sag, crushing him inwardly. Hector, face stony, walked over to the dining table and picked up a faded manila folder. He handed it to Jason. He accepted it numbly. Swallowing, he thumbed it open. Claudia stared coldly back at him. Lifting the photograph, he stared at it. She was older, haunted, and heartless. Her posture was stiff and rigid and her facial features were sharp and beautifully refined. Her eyes…they were enough to cut into him and make him ache because they weren't the eyes he remembered. They held no warmth. \"She's been accredited with over a dozen assassinations worldwide in the past six years.\" Hector said quietly, \"To the Order…she's their trophy.\" Jason felt himself start to infinitesimally shake. \"Claudia's here, Jason. She's in New York.\" 00000 Gotham City Wayne Manor Eddie pounded his fist mercilessly against the large oak doors, shivering and gritting his teeth from the cold wind biting at his face and the shards of rain that soaked him to his bones. He felt sick and something, no, everything felt incredibly wrong . Alfred finally cracked one of the doors open warily. Upon seeing a haphazard Eddie, he opened the door wider, mouth turning down in concern, \"Mister Santos.\" \"Where's Alex?\" he demanded, \"Is she here? Where is she?\" Alfred looked like he was about to brush Eddie off, but Eddie cut him off – jittery and frustrated – \"Look, she was supposed to meet with me hours ago. She's not answering my texts or returning my calls and I've spent the entire fucking day looking for her everywhere and I need to know where she is .\" He gasped out in shallow breaths, feeling pain at his side from where a gangster had managed to nail him during his ragged interrogation. (There was also a bruise forming on his cheekbone and his fingernails were cracked from when a different gang had shoved him onto the ground and his ribs still ached from the impact of his body on the gravelly and mud-streaked sidewalk.) Alfred quietly gestured for him to enter, \"Let's get you out of this weather first.\" Feeling his body loosen a fraction in relief, Eddie stepped inside, peeled off his shoes and socks when Alfred told him to, and followed the butler through the seemingly empty manor and to the Bat Cave. Bruce, still in civilian clothing, sat typing away furiously at the computer. Various windows were pulled up, one of them a video chat with Barbara, who was worrying away at her lower lip as she frantically typed something into her own keyboard as well. Tim was at Bruce's side, reading up on the screens and occasionally tapping on something, broadening the image with a sweep of his fingers before discarding it and opening a new window. A familiar blond stood beside Tim, aiding him in plucking out certain tabs. \"What the hell is going on?\" he demanded, his voice echoing throughout the depths of the cave. Everyone (except for Bruce) turned around. Nate looked surprised and concerned to see him, \"Hey,\" he finally seemed to register Eddie's haggard appearance and turned slightly alarmed, \"Whoa, what happened to you?\" \"Nothing I haven't gone through before,\" he replied smoothly. \"Where's Alex?\" Alfred wordlessly sat Eddie down firmly into a chair and began applying the first aid kit. \"We're still trying to figure that out,\" Tim answered. \"She's been gone since this morning.\" \"But, I saw her this morning,\" Eddie said. \"We agreed to meet after she got out of school, but she never showed up.\" \"Yeah well,\" Tim grimaced, eyes shifting back to the glowing screen, \"She never got to school. She knocked me out and took the Lamborghini. I'm assuming Damian pestered her into bringing him along, which was a good thing because he'd been secretly sending coordinates to the Cave every hour. We stopped receiving them almost exactly an hour ago. Last we know, they were in New York.\" \"Does Jason know about this?\" Eddie asked, sweeping a quick searching glance around the cave. \"Jason was out in New York to do a search and rescue for Dick. He'd gone missing, and we've also lost track of Jason. We haven't heard back from either of them,\" Barbara answered from her spot on the screen. Her calm expression faltered with worry. \"Alex didn't know any of that,\" Eddie realized, \"She went out looking for him.\" \"She went out looking for the truth,\" Bruce answered, running a hand over his face, \"She found out we were keeping things from her.\" Eddie felt his expression flatten. \"Wow. And no one thought that would be a bad idea? Ow,\" he added in a mutter as Alfred dabbed iodine at the cut on his face. \"We didn't want to burden her,\" Bruce replied in a low voice. \"With what? How bad could it possibly – \" \"Her mother is alive,\" Bruce interrupted patiently, \"Claudia Ramirez is a member of the elite organization known as the Order of the Phoenix. She's a tool, a weapon of chaos for order. She's been held accountable for over one a dozen assassinations in the past six years that we thought her dead. She remembers nothing from her past. Not Alex. Not Jason. Not Dick. And she was recently assigned a new target by the Order of the Phoenix.\" Eddie swallowed dryly, feeling cold dread creep up the backs of his shoulders. \"She's going after Alex.\" \"Bruce,\" Barbara said sharply, almost choking. She pulled up a window onto the computer, and everyone shifted closer to watch. It was live news feed from New York. \" Chaos has erupted here in New York, where we are reporting to you live. An extreme car accident has blocked off a good chunk of road near Times Square, and while there have been no confirmed casualties, there are a relatively small number of people who were injured and have been immediately pulled out to safety.\" The aerial view of the camera switched over to the ground view, and a familiar figure in a familiar red hoodie was fighting aggressive hand-to-hand combat with a masked woman who moved like a viper. \"No,\" Eddie heard himself say. \" Two females appear to be waging war against one another on the blockaded street. Pedestrians are trying to get a clear view, but police are attempting to hold them at bay. Oh my – \" There were several gasps from the watching pedestrians as the masked woman managed to sweep Alex's arm out of the way and slam her fist into her gut, actually sending her back several feet to sprawl onto the road. Her hoodie fell back only slightly to reveal a peek of her dirt-covered face and the trickle of blood that flowed thickly out from the corner of her mouth. She spat flecks of red onto the ground and leaned heavily on her forearm, hastily chucking her hood back over her head. Eddie's fists clenched and he blurted out unthinkingly, \"We have to go ! She's gonna die out there!\" \"Technically, she can't.\" Tim added in a mutter. Before Eddie could ask what the fucking hell he meant by that, his attention was brought back to the screen as one of the police officers stepped out onto the barren road and stepped defensively in front of Alex, holding his gun out and shooting at the masked woman. Everyone watched, silently stunned, as Claudia strode towards the firing officer, ducking and dodging and easing her way around the bullets until she was only a foot away from him. Her arm shot out to twist his arm – a crunching snap was heard and the officer screamed. Claudia took the gun from his limp fingers and shot him in the head. Pedestrians screamed, moving farther back away from the scene, and no other officer made any move to intervene in the battle. She had made it clear it was to remain only between her and Alex. Eddie watched as Alex, clutching at her midsection in pain for another brief second, rolled onto her feet and sprinted at the woman again with an angry scream. She pulled out explosive pellets from her utility belts and slammed them all over the surrounding ground around Claudia. Plumes of black smoke billowed around them, and the camera watched as Alex dove into the smoke for another round. Bruce stood up from his chair sharply, turning to look at each of them in turn. \"We're taking the jet.\" 00000 New York City \"Can't you drive any faster?\" Jason snapped from the passenger seat. \"Not if you want to end up in a car wreck,\" Hector answered calmly. \"I really hope you weren't trying to be funny .\" \"Call it poetic irony.\" Jason appeared just about to boil over when Dick popped his head in between their shoulders from the backseat, \"So, mind running over the plan again?\" he said to Hector. \"Save Alex,\" Jason answered plaintively. \"And stopping my sister,\" Hector added with a brief glance towards Jason. \"And by stopping you mean…\" Dick trailed off, observing as Jason turned to glare out the window. \"Incapacitating her so that we can take her with us.\" \"Right. Where did you say we were taking her?\" \"I didn't,\" Hector grimaced, \"We might not even get past phase one.\" \"How comforting.\" \"Hold it!\" Jason shouted suddenly, and Hector braked hard just as he reached the wreck of cars blocking the road. NYPD cars were lined up to keep pedestrians away. A helicopter hovered high above, and crowds of people were craning their necks to get a view of what was happening. Jason was out of the Honda in a heartbeat just as Hector secured the cap on his head and Dick put on his cowl, lightly chucking his navy hoodie over his tousled head. They ran out after him, sneakers crunching on the gravelly road. \"Alex!\" Jason shouted, easily shoving aside a policeman that called out at him. He sprinted to the center of what had become an arena. Alex either hadn't heard him or had chosen to ignore him. She caught Claudia's fist in her hand and swiped her knife at her face. Claudia barely leaned back as it whisked over her. Alex, using the same hand holding the knife, used the heel of her palm to harshly jut Claudia's chin and make her stumble back two steps. Alex continued to force herself forward, using her sharp elbows and knees and fists to strike rapidly and repeatedly and mercilessly at Claudia, who blocked each blow quickly and perfectly. \"Stop!\" Jason surged forward, latching onto Alex's arm in mid-strike. Alex blinked and whipped her head to stare at Jason as if seeing him for the first time. Her surprise was quickly replaced with disbelief and anger. \"What are you doing?!\" she snapped, jerking her arm away. \"I almost had her!\" Jason, instead of answering right away, turned to look at the woman standing stilly a few feet away, her mouth and eyes masked from his view. He swallowed, feeling his pulse accelerate. He opened his mouth to speak, but no sound came out. \"Claudia –\" he began in a breath. Claudia suddenly dove forward, knife back in her hand. She knocked into Alex and the two tumbled backwards. Alex landed hard on the concrete, and Jason heard the air wheeze out of her lungs. Claudia's fist swung at Alex's head, but she craned out of the way just in time, slamming her forehead against Claudia's and quickly upper-cutting her in the chin. Alex kicked her knee into Claudia's stomach and flung her over her head. Claudia flipped mid-air and landed solidly on her feet in a swift crouch. She turned and twirled her knife in her hand before throwing it at Alex. Alex dodged it and retrieved her blade, panting heavily. She adjusted her footing weakly as Claudia charged at her again. Jason rammed into Claudia from the side, tackling her and struggling to pin her to the ground. \"Claudia…\" he forced through gritted teeth, clasping his hands over her wrists, \" Claudia !\" He managed to rip off her bulletproof goggles and mouth mask while keeping her down. She stared up at him with hard eyes and a tight grimace. Jason almost couldn't believe his eyes. He unconsciously slackened his grip. \"Who the hell is Claudia?\" she said indifferently, and Jason felt his stomach drop as he fully realized it was her . He blinked and suddenly he was being slammed onto his back against the asphalt. The breath disappeared from his lungs and he felt firm fingers squeezing at his windpipe. He felt like he'd been paralyzed – he couldn't even bring himself to throw her off him. All Jason did was stare up into brown eyes that reflected nothing back at him. No. This wasn't happening. Oh god, no . Her weight was suddenly lifted off him, and Jason choked out broken breaths, rolling onto his side. He watched dazedly as Dick held Claudia with his arms looped under her shoulders, pain (not the physical kind) tightening his face into a grimace. Claudia tried to smack the back of her head against his skull, but Dick saw it coming and leaned further back, arms tightening around her. She kicked his knees back with the heel of her foot, and Dick faltered only for a second before scrambling to bear hug her again. Hector approached Claudia steadily, but Jason could see the hesitation and turmoil glimmering in his green eyes as he reached into his jacket and pulled out a syringe. Claudia breathed heavily, brown eyes stormy as she burned her vicious glare into Hector. Using his metal arm, he grabbed her shoulder to steady her and, with the other hand, injected something from a syringe into her vein. Claudia let out a scream of rage, but her attempts to escape weakened quickly. She finally went slack as she slipped into unconsciousness. It was quiet except for the purring blades of the helicopter above them. Cheers suddenly erupted from the watching crowd, and the police loosened in relief and gave curt, solemn nods. Jason swept his eyes over to Alex, who remained standing silently in her spot, covered in dirt and bruises and smears of blood. Her green gaze continued to rest numbly on a limp Claudia. Jason got up, feeling sick and lightheaded. He walked slowly over to his daughter, wondering how to explain. He reached for her shoulder, \"Alex – \" She shoved his arm away, eyes snapping to glare at him. \"No,\" she hissed through gritted teeth, \"She's not her . Okay? She's not .\" She turned to walk towards an unconscious Damian, whom Jason hadn't noticed up until that moment. He heard her say one last thing – loudly and clearly and unforgivingly. \"My mother died a long time ago.\" Finished this at 2 in the morning. No regrets. P.S. thanks for the reviews ![Chapter 23] A/N: Whoo update! Thanks for the reviews and follows, guys. They always take me by surprise, which is super nice. So this chapter has flashbacks! (Which are in italics; Non-italics is just them in a hospital in NYC.) I'd actually written some of these in the story I'm working on about Claudia and Jason, and I decided to stick them on here because they're some pieces I'm actually pleased with. From here I'm probably going to stray away from Alex for a bit and focus on Jason and Claudia a little more, for plot reasons. By the way I just finished finals week, so pardon if this feels not so satisfying. Thanks for reading this super-long note! Gotham City. (Set After the Ending of Batman: Under the Red Hood) \" You,\" she breathed, stunned. She gaped at him in shock, and just as Jason had shaped a snarky comment to seal the reality of his return, her face transformed into angry disbelief. \"You're the Red Hood,\" she said, realization dawning in her stormy eyes. Her voice rose from a whisper to a much harsher volume. \"You've…you've killed people.\" Jason felt his smirk disappear, and his gut twisted. \"I did what I had to,\" he heard himself respond without thinking. \" No,\" Claudia replied angrily, \"You didn't have to do anything.\" \" Claudia,\" he began, feeling himself grow aggravated. He was losing control of the situation. \"I'm alive. I'm back – don't you see?\" He threw his arms out to the sides, helmet still clutched in one gloved hand. Claudia watched him with steely eyes, and he watched her gaze flicker from him, to the helmet, and back to him. He tried to find a glimmer of something, something, in her achingly familiar brown eyes, but she showed him nothing. She was cold and rigid and unsympathetic – nothing like the Claudia he knew. He let his arms drop to his sides. The cold beads of rain rolled down from his hair to the sides of his face. \"You're…different,\" he said it like he was bringing up a change in weather. Casual. Conversational. Indifferent. Her eyes flickered darkly; he didn't miss the way she almost flinched. \"I guess now we both know what happens to us when you die,\" she ground out stiffly. It was Jason's turn to jerk in response. His fingers curled tightly around his helmet and his jaw clenched as her words slashed into his skin, searing like hot iron. \"You make it sound like it was my fault.\" \" No,\" Claudia said immediately, regret tracing the lines of her face. \"No.\" Her stiff shoulders sagged slightly. A car drove by, splashing dirty rainwater onto the grimy sidewalk. Its yellowed headlights swept across them, illuminating her face, and for that quick moment, Jason was able to clearly see the ghosts of the shadows in her hollow face and the past nightmares that had winked out the glimmer in her eyes. \" I'm…\" she swallowed thickly, and he could see her frame infinitesimally start to quiver. \"It's…uh,\" Jason felt his anger begin to crumble as her own fierce façade did. \"Welcome back,\" she finally got out, her cracked voice dwindling into a whisper. She grimaced, and her wet eyes darted to his face one last time before she roughly crammed her hands in her pockets and hurried away in the opposite direction. Not for the first time, she left him standing alone. . . . \"Jason.\" He lifted his head wearily, rubbing his eyes, and let his blurred vision adjust to see Dick handing him a cup of coffee. Jason sat up straight, accepting the drink, and carefully blew at the hot surface. Dick pulled out the chair across from him and sat in it, placing his elbows on the white table and leaning forward slightly. \"How're you holding up?\" he asked quietly, blue eyes empathetic. \"What do you think,\" Jason replied monotonically, keeping his eyes lowered. The muffled hospital sounds of ringing phones and chattering nurses and doctors were easily tuned out by the inner screaming in his skull. \"Damian's stable,\" Dick informed, a little relief erasing the crease between his brows. He leaned back in his chair. \"Bruce is in his room waiting for him to wake up.\" \"I don't see why he was so worried. That kid isn't going anywhere anytime soon.\" Jason took a sip of his coffee, ignoring that it scalded the tip of his tongue. \"Neither is Alex, clearly.\" Dick said. \"She took a brutal beating, but the doc said no serious damage was done.\" \"Physically,\" Jason muttered under his breath. Dick eyed him carefully. \"She'll be all right. We just need to give her some space, some time to process –\" \"Don't say that,\" Jason scoffed disgustedly, glaring at him. \"You didn't see her face. You know what she said? She told me her mother died a long time ago. Up until a few hours ago, I'd believed the exact same thing.\" He neglected his coffee and leaned away, his whole body sagging with the invisible, unbearable weight on his shoulders. \"But all this time…\" He drifted off and rubbed his tired face with his hands. \"God,\" Jason sighed, dropping his hand back into his lap and blinking angrily, his low voice quivering dangerously, \"This is so fucking messed up. I'm – I'm cursed or something. I mean, just look at everything that's ever happened to me. My dad ditched when I was a kid. My mom…\" Jason gestured emptily with his hand (because Dick knew the story behind that already, and it never got easier, talking about her.) \"And sure, Bruce adopted me. I had you, Alfred, Babs, and…and Claudia,\" his voice cracked to hoarse a whisper, and he cleared his throat. \"And it wasn't always perfect, but it was the most I'd ever had. But then I died, and then I didn't. After that, it was me, Alex, and Claudia. Then the 'accident' happened, and I gave Alex to an orphanage , which I'll never forgive myself for even thinking of doing,\" Jason shook his head, eyes burning and jaw clenching. \"All I've ever wanted was to be part of a family. That's it. I just keep screwing up.\" Dick gazed at his younger brother patiently, and saw the full image of the lost boy he used to so often catch only glimpses of. \"Nah,\" he said lightly, \"You haven't screwed up that bad.\" Jason snorted. \"You still have family, Jay,\" he used the old nickname with ease and affection, \"It's bigger than ever. Maybe a little lost, and a little broken, but we're all still here.\" Jason didn't look up. He kept his head bowed, because not for the life of him would he let Dick see him cry. . . . He found her in the children's waiting room. Eddie stood beneath the threshold, eyes scanning over the colorfully decorated room. Some kids in patient scrubs were playing contentedly with some of the toys, tubes taped over their ears and to their nostrils. One had an arm cast. Another had a leg cast. He saw another in a wheelchair. A few of the younger patients were in a small cluster around her. She was reading to them: Pete the Cat. A small boy had wriggled his way into her lap, head leaning into the crook of her neck like it belonged there. Two girls and one other boy were also pressed up against her on the sides, craning to see the pages. Eddie watched the scene with mild wonder – it was so foreign and familiar. It took him little more than a beat to realize it looked familiar because he'd used to find her like this before, back when they were in the same orphanage. It was foreign because, well, it felt like it had been a billion light years ago. He'd forgotten how Alex was with kids. He lingered a little longer, not wanting to interrupt. She looked…at ease. Her cheek was pressed against the top of the little boy's head as she read with a tranquil look to her eyes. She didn't seem to mind the small limbs that were entangled in her own arms. One of the little girls had her head nestled against her shoulder, and Alex's free arm wrapped around the small blonde, rubbing her back in soothing circles. When she finished reading, the boy that wasn't in her lap got up and ran to join some of his other playmates. The two girls asked her questions, not just about the book, but about things like her hair (which had been put in a braid, for once), and the bruise on her face, and the stained gauze on her bare arms, and her hair again. Eddie decided it was okay to approach her. He made his way around the scattered toys and small children carefully. Some of them cast him curious glances, but otherwise remained attentive to each other and the toys. Alex didn't look at him until he was standing in front of her. The two wide-eyed girls looked up at him as well. \"Hey,\" he said softly. \"Hi,\" she answered, eyes flickering back down to the closed book in her hands. \"Is he your boyfriend ?\" The blonde little girl whispered all too loudly, sincerely trying to be discreet. The other brown-haired girl giggled. Eddie's mouth twitched as he tried not to smile. Alex avoided looking at him entirely. Alex looked at the smiling blonde with playfully narrowed eyes as she handed her the book, \"Why don't you go put this back where it goes, Katherine.\" Katherine giggled one last time and got up, but Alex leaned forward with a genuine smile and said kindly, \"Thank you for letting me read to you. You too, Aubri.\" The two girls took off, joining some other girls at the toy kitchen. Eddie sat down, cross-legged, in front of Alex, who looked down gently at the boy in her lap, \"You gonna stay there, Michael, buddy?\" She rubbed his soft brown hair with bandaged fingers. He laughed a little and shook his head, extracting himself from her lap. He grabbed a nearby stuffed elephant, gave it to her, and wandered off in his fire truck pajamas, which Eddie complimented him on. \"When did you get here?\" Alex asked, green eyes washing over his slightly damp appearance. \"Fifteen minutes ago, give or take,\" he shrugged, \"Bruce's jet had to land on another more stable rooftop. We walked over here from down the street.\" \"You, Bruce, and…?\" Alex raised an eyebrow. \"Tim and Nate,\" he finished. \"They're wiping the footage from the street cameras. As a precaution.\" \"Ah,\" she said. Eddie didn't miss the faint guilt written across her face. \"You didn't show,\" he finally said quietly. \"Yeah,\" she croaked, \"sorry about that.\" \"You could have told me,\" Eddie said, keeping his eyes on her, \"You remember I said I was going to help you, right? Just this morning I told you I was going to be with you every step of the way, and I find out hours later that you had taken off to New York. You – \" \"I know,\" she interrupted, subconsciously pulling at the injured fingers on her right hand. She winced and gingerly touched her raw, scraped knuckles, \"I know.\" \"Then why did you disappear without saying anything?\" Eddie whispered, brows furrowed pleadingly and confusedly. \"I don't know – I wasn't thinking . I just, I acted on impulse, okay? I…\" she huffed sharply, looking exhausted and frustrated and achingly empty. Eddie gazed at her sore, wounded form. She'd been bandaged and gauzed and stitched back together, and possibly for the very first time…she looked…vulnerable. \"My – the woman who used to be my mother tried to kill me today,\" she said softly, so that none of the kids around them could hear. \"Alex,\" he began, ready to tell her to stop, that she didn't have to talk about it if she didn't want to. \"I saw her face. And when I saw it, it was like most of my memories became a little clearer, you know? I recognized her. But…she didn't even remember me. She looked right at me, and her first and only response was to kill me.\" Alex's voice wavered slightly, and Eddie restrained himself from pulling her into his arms. He knew she didn't want comfort yet; she wanted to talk. \"I find out my –\" she gritted her teeth and corrected herself again, \" she's alive, and it's nothing at all like I'd ever fantasized it would be,\" Alex whispered. \"I know,\" he murmured, at a complete loss to say anything else, \"I'm so sorry, Alex.\" Silence settled between the two of them. He pretended not to notice when she would quickly wipe at her eyes. She sniffed a few times and held the plush elephant to her stomach. \"So,\" she said after some minutes passed, \"what happened to you?\" She nodded at the shiner on his cheekbone and his taped knuckles. He snorted lightly, \"I went out looking for you. Turned over some big rocks. Tried to find leads. All that stuff.\" \"Like a true dork detective,\" she mocked gently. Then, more sincerely, \"I am sorry I didn't tell you, or anyone. I took Damian only because he was being a turd about it.\" She grimaced, \"I should've tried harder to force him to stay behind. I could've knocked him out like I did Tim. I was stupid.\" \"Yeah, you kind of were,\" he joked gingerly, only because he knew it was okay. She laughed, but the sound was wet and she clutched the elephant closer to her. Eddie felt himself soften, and he decided to scoot to her side, \"Hey, come here,\" he wrapped an arm around her shoulders carefully. She leaned into him, tucked her nose into the negative space between his neck and shoulder, and neither of them said anything else. . . . Gotham City. (Two Weeks After Jason Reveals to Claudia He's Not Dead) \" In Mexico, they say when someone you love dies, a part of you dies with them.\" Jason flickered his eyes up to look at her. She was watching him steadily, (all the consternation and fear and tempest from two weeks ago were absent from her clear brown eyes) and he felt his heart beat quickly. \" But they forget to mention that a part of them is born in you, although not immediately.\" She sighed to steady herself again, and Jason felt more than saw the cool winter breath that misted across his cheek; there was the lingering fragrance of coffee creamer, and he briefly wondered if he would taste it on her lips if he kissed her. The thought quickly went out like a small flame. \" I've had enough people I love die to learn that it's an opportunity to be reborn.\" There was a quiet pause. \" You've moved on,\" Jason concluded, eyes resting at her chin. A large part of him was relieved, reassured, that she had. It was one of the billion thoughts he'd had in those last ragged breaths he'd taken in the rusty warehouse – he'd wanted her to move on from his tragedy. And here he was to ruin everything she'd built for herself. \" I'm sorry,\" he said quietly, hoarsely. He began to stand up. \" Jason,\" there was surprise flecked in her tone. He turned just as she reached out to hook her hand on the crook of his elbow. There was sudden panic and confusion in her eyes and her grip was tethering him to her. Jason watched her, stupefied. \" You didn't let me finish,\" she released him quickly, arm dropping at her side. Jason turned fully around to face her. \" I did move on,\" she allowed, \"I'm in my second year of college. I have friends. Can you believe that?\" she joked, and Jason felt like air rushed into his lungs and he felt a smile tug at his mouth. \"Part of the time I tutor kindergarteners with reading. Most of my time I work with the NYPD. I've worked with Star Labs.\" Her expression had grown excitedly, and her features softened again. \"You know where I stayed while I was there?\" Jason shrugged, but he knew the answer anyway. \" Ollie and Dinah,\" she said. \"They'd invited me. One time I was also sent to work at Central City with their crime scene investigation unit. Guess who welcomed me with open arms there?\" \" The Allens,\" Jason nodded. \" The point I'm trying to make,\" she sighed, \"is, I knew you for only a year in ninth grade, and within that time you completely changed my life. You blew me off whatever course I was running on and knocked me into a much, much better one. I may have moved on from your accident. But, even when you were gone, you were still omnipresent in my life. In everyone and everything.\" She pressed her lips together and locked eyes with him. Jason felt like he was rooted to the ground. \"No matter how much I would try, I could never move on from you .\" There was another long pause. \" Do you believe in fate?\" Claudia asked, \"I do. Except, with everything that's ever happened...my parents…my brother…my aunt…I always felt I had something…awful in store for me.\" She gave a sad, tentative smile, \"You made me think otherwise.\" \" You did the exact same for me,\" Jason finally got out in a hoarse voice. Then her arms were wrapped warmly around him, and Jason froze because he wasn't used to contact that wasn't a fistfight. But she pressed her fingers into his sides and nestled her forehead into the slope of his shoulder and he could feel her trembling lips on his collarbone – so he hugged her back fiercely, inhaling the clean scent of her hair and letting his eyes slip closed because, for the first time in five years, he felt safe enough to do it. . . . Jason stood stiffly with his arms hanging loosely at his sides. He looked past his reflection on the glass window to the still figure lying on the hospital bed. Hector approached him from the left. \"She won't be waking up for another two hours. The sedative was pretty heavy.\" \"For how long did you have that ready?\" Jason asked, keeping his eyes on her. He could see the barely perceptive rise and fall of her chest. Hector took a steady breath. \"When she first tried to kill me.\" Jason looked at him, quietly stunned. \"The Order of the Phoenix sent her after me. Not too long after they made my parents try to kill me.\" He laughed, but it cracked and pain glittered in his eyes as he watched his resting sister. \"It was an epic fight. Claudia would have bragged about it nonstop.\" Jason inwardly flinched at the way Hector talked about Claudia – like it wasn't the same woman behind the glass window. It was the same way Alex had talked about her. \"You don't think she remembers anything?\" Jason muttered. Hector opened his mouth to answer, but he hesitated. He looked pensive for a few minutes before answering carefully, \"Before, I would have said no. But…\" Jason stared at Hector attentively. \"I believe the Order left selective bits of her memory untouched. When I was fighting her, she would suddenly use a move or two that I'd taught her when we were teenagers. Other than that…\" Hector looked down solemnly and shook his head, \"I think they did an efficient job of taking everything else.\" Jason felt his stomach twist at what they'd done to her to accomplish that. . . . Hector had gone to eat with Dick, and Jason found himself sitting in the chair beside her bed. It was different seeing her up close. And without her trying to kill him. \"Then again, you've probably always wanted to do that, huh?\" he said jocularly. He gazed at her still expression. Her lips were pale and so was her tan skin. The longer he looked, the more details he began to notice. The dark shadows under her closed eyes. The faded scar that traced from her clavicle to beneath her hospital scrubs. The ghost of bruises and battle scars on the skin of her shoulders. Swallowing thickly, Jason lightly rested his hand over hers, and then tentatively curled his fingers around hers. \"I thought you were dead,\" he whispered, \"Payback sucks, Claud.\" He stroked her wrist with his thumb, rubbing soothing circles. He lifted her hand and quietly kissed the back of her knuckles before putting them to his forehead as though in silent prayer. \"I really, really hope you're still in there, Claud,\" he held her hand in both of his and closed his eyes, \"Some of you. Any of you. I need you .\" Jason's voice wavered as he echoed old words he'd told her plenty of times before, \"I'll always need you.\" He didn't care that she couldn't hear him. . . . When he woke up, it felt late. The hospital lights had dimmed to accommodate the patients. The arm his head had fallen asleep on prickled uncomfortably. Claudia's hand was still in his. Vaguely, he remembered his short and blurred dream – fingers brushing his hair back, feathering across his cheekbone. It had probably been a memory of the two of them. It made his insides ache. Jason leaned back in his chair with a sigh and rubbed his face with his hands, covering his sore eyes. He coughed dryly. He let his hands fall back into his lap. Claudia was staring at him. Jason felt every nerve in him freeze. He stared back like a deer frozen in headlights. She blinked, brown eyes reflecting confusion as she continued to look at him with furrowed brows. \"I know you,\" she said. Her voice hit him hard; he felt like wheezing. It sounded like Claudia . \"Yeah,\" he nodded slowly, wrestling with not getting his hopes up, \"you know me. You know me better than anybody.\" Surprise flickered across her features, and she seemed to be struggling. \"No,\" she said dazedly, her tone shifting, \"you're my mission.\" They launched at each other the same time. Jason kept her pinned to the hospital bed, and she fought against him fiercely, a dangerous look in her eyes. Bruce, Hector, Dick, and a doctor burst into the room. Hector and the doctor helped him keep her still as the doctor injected her with a clear syringe. Jason tried hard to look away. Her grip began to slacken, and her fist on his jacket sleeve loosened. Her brown eyes grew confused again as she began to drift away. The doctor readjusted her IV and heart monitor, and Jason staggered a step back, heaving suffocated breaths. \"Jason,\" Bruce put a hand on his shoulder. Jason turned away, leaning his forearm on the nearest wall and resting his forehead against it. A raw sob shook from his chest and he didn't care when he found he couldn't stop. He just didn't care. . . . Gotham Academy. (Ninth Grade) \" What is it?\" He quirked the corner of his mouth upward in a mild smirk, \"You have very nice eyes.\" Claudia instinctively looked away, trying to suppress a smile. \"Shut up,\" she said, though not harshly. \" You know blue eyes are actually a mutation?\" he said, shifting so that his elbow rested on one bent knee and he loomed closer to her. She could feel his cool breath on her cheek. She still didn't look up at him. \" I think I've read that somewhere before,\" she responded, flipping indifferently though the worn out cover of Pride and Prejudice. \" I think it's pretty cool.\" Claudia could tell by his tone that he meant it, \"Like I'm a mutant.\" \" Mutant's a strong term,\" she finally lifted her eyes to flicker between his crystal blues observantly. His smirk deepened, but his gaze never wavered from hers. \" I think it's better to think of it as a metamorphosis,\" she finally said with a small smile. \" Like a butterfly?\" Jason snorted lightly, shifting back into a normal sitting position and instantly dissipating…whatever moment it was they were possibly having. \"Yeah. Pretty. I guess.\" His eyes wandered back to hers, and his quirk of a smile returned. She returned it wryly and looked back down at her book. \"But I knew him,\" Claudia whispered to no one hours later as the moonlight bleached the solitary hospital room devoid of color. She curled her knees into her chest and wrapped her arms tightly around herself, feeling as though a crack was forming in her skull. \"I knew him,\" she said with a little more volume. She suddenly wanted them to hear her. She wanted to know. \"Jason,\" she said the name under her breath. \"You're Jason.\" (A/N: The last flashback was Claudia's before she woke up)[Chapter 24] A/N: So how about we all just assume I'm always on an irregular hiatus. New York City 12: 55 AM A sleek black BMW pulled up at the front of the hospital, and three people in suits – two men and one woman – stepped out, each with their own matching black umbrella. Once they were out, the tinted car continued to glide smoothly into the rain-slicked street traffic. They made their way inside, earning wary and somewhat nervous looks. One of the nurses at the front of the desk noticed them approaching. \"We're here to see a patient,\" the woman said before the nurse could ask about the nature of their visit. \"Claudia Ramirez. She was recently placed in solitary confinement.\" The nurse's eyes swept over them uneasily. \"What is the relationship between you three and the patient?\" The woman smiled, a barely perceptible lift of her mouth. \"Family.\" . . . \"Hey, twerp,\" Jason watched as Alex affectionately greeted a conscious and somewhat recuperated Damian. He was standing and dressed in casual civilian clothing, with only a few bandages, scratches and bruises showing here and there. \"Todd. I'm vaguely surprised you made it out alive,\" he said with his usual pompous snark, but it was softened somehow. Alex smiled tightly and pulled him in for a careful hug, her bandaged hand cradling the back of his head like a small child. A relieved look flooded her face. After a few moments, she pulled away, ruffling his hair. He swatted her hand away with a roll of the eyes. \"Ow, watch it,\" she joked, rubbing her hand, \"Just 'cause I'm alive doesn't mean I didn't take a beating.\" \"You look like a giant bruise,\" Damian agreed. Then he frowned in faint worry, but didn't say anything else. Alex clicked her tongue and pointed at him good naturedly, \"Right back at ya.\" Bruce walked in then, looking a bit tired but less tense since Damian was already well enough to go home – with permission from the doctor. \"I got us a couple of hotel rooms booked,\" he said, tucking away his cellphone into the pocket of his jeans. \"Four. We're splitting up in pairs. Roy and Hector; Dick and Tim; Eddie and Nate; Jason and Alex; and Damian and I.\" \"What, you couldn't get us our own rooms?\" Alex riposted with slight bitterness. Her words stung Jason, but he didn't show it. She was giving everyone the cold shoulder. Except Damian. She was even brushing off Roy – who'd only arrived an hour ago. Hector had tried approaching her, but she'd cut him off with surprising coldness. Then again, given the circumstances, it wasn't so surprising. \"No one else has any problems with it,\" Bruce replied steadily, \"You're welcome to spend the night here, if you'd like.\" Alex stiffened her jaw but lowered her stare to the ground. \"We'll spend one night there,\" Bruce said, looking from Alex, to Damian, to Jason. \"Then Tim, Damian, and I will be heading back to Gotham in the afternoon.\" \"Not needed here, huh?\" Jason said nonchalantly, but his own bitterness underlined his words. Bruce's eyes darkened sympathetically and he gripped Jason's shoulder tightly, gently jostling him, \"I'll always answer when you need me,\" he lowered his voice to a softer, fatherly tone, \"But this is your family, Jason. One I wasn't originally a part of. That was your decision to make. I understand and respect that.\" Jason lowered his gaze. \"I knew Claudia, too, and I'm willing to help with whatever I can. But…\" Bruce's expression saddened, \"I just don't see anything I can help with right now.\" Jason understood what he meant – she was a lost cause. He didn't want to believe that. But it was hard. \"Come on, Damian,\" Bruce extended his arm to his youngest son, who glanced at Alex and Jason before joining his father. Jason turned around to face Alex, who flickered her eyes to him for one second before walking past him with a brusque, \"I'm out of here, too.\" \"Alex.\" Jason said, and his tone stopped her short. Her hands clenched and she turned around hastily. \"What?\" she asked flatly. \"You can't behave like this,\" he said, not caring that he was sounding a lot like an actual dad. \"It's unfair – \" She choked out a strangled sound of disbelief, \" Unfair ? Did your little visit with her erase your memory, too? Did you forget who did this to me? She tried to kill me .\" \"She doesn't remember you. The Order did something to her and she can't remember anything about us.\" \"I know that. But that doesn't justify what she's done.\" Her voice wavered near the end of her sentence. \"She's the bad guy and she needs to be stopped. What's so hard to get about that? Yet here you are, trying to save her when there's nothing left in there to save. That's not the woman you loved, dad. That's not the one you started a family with. Claudia died, okay? That monster in there is someone else, and the only thing she knows about you and me is that she was sent to kill us. That's what's unfair,\" Alex's voice dropped to a dry whisper, \"So I'm sorry I'm acting this way. I'm just trying to deal with this crap the way I've always dealt with it. On my own.\" \"Alex,\" Jason said quietly, and he heard himself speak the words Dick once said to him, \"we don't turn our back on family. Even when they do.\" \"Well you were the first one to turn your back on me.\" Jason visibly flinched, mouth agape as the sting of her words sliced open old wounds. She turned and strode out, sneakers squeaking against the cold white tiles. . . . Alex slowed once she got to the elevator. She leaned heavily against the wall, arm wrapping gingerly around her aching ribs. She closed her eyes and vigorously wiped the warm tears that trickled down her face. She sniffed and punched the button with shaky breaths to calm herself. Then again, crying wasn't unusual or undignified in a hospital, so she shouldn't even care that much. Alex draped her hoodie over her head anyway. The elevator dinged open, and she brushed past the people inside, shuffling to the very back without lifting her head. The elevator continued to go up, and a couple of people would get out on each level. Eventually, Alex looked up to see only three people remained with their backs facing her. Her instinct – one honed by years on the streets – began to jab at her, and she eyed the suited men and woman with growing uneasiness. They got off wordlessly at the final level – where solitary confinement was. She stiffened. Alex waited with her eyes lowered as they stepped off wordlessly and the elevator doors closed again. She exhaled slowly, \"Easy, Alejandra,\" she breathed to herself, \"They're probably checking on someone else. Someone really crazy.\" Alex paused as that last sentence settled in. \"Ah hell,\" she pushed the elevator button and the doors hummed open again. She moved soundlessly into the brightly lit hallway, settling into her old street persona of 'invisible, innocent, and incognito individual' – shoulders slouched, head ducked, hands in pockets. As she continued further down the hall, she caught up with the uniformed trio again. Slowing her pace, Alex lounged at certain points with feigned nonchalance. When she glanced up, she saw them enter room 114. That was Claudia's room. Alex instinctively broke into a sprint, but she choked on the first step, nearly tripping herself. A few nurses looked at her in some concern, but she steadied herself, facing away from the room. She has visitors – so what?, Alex thought with a scowl, Why should I care? Why should I care at all about the woman that had the solid intent of killing me? Why should I care whether she's in any danger? Maybe she isn't even in danger at all. Maybe the people in suits were just going to talk about important matters like, like overdue rent or some crap like that. But what does that matter to me? It doesn't . It doesn't matter because she doesn't matter . She's the bad guy. You said so yourself, Alex, she's the bad guy and she needs to be stopped. You can't save someone when there's nothing left to save. And hey, these guys will probably do the favor for you. So why are you feeling so guilty? She's not your responsibility. She's not your mother. Alex sucked in a sharp breath, squeezed her eyes shut and swore under her breath as her instincts screamed at her to run into the room. She obeyed them. Her hand was already on the door handle just as she remembered she didn't have her utility belt. . . . Moments before… The door opened, and a sliver of the bright light in the hall flooded the room. Three shadows stretched across the floor to the edge of her bed. Claudia stared at them with hollow eyes. The woman at the center smiled gently as one of the men securely shut the door behind them. All the light in the room went away with it. \"Hello there, Claudia,\" the woman greeted brusquely, \"I apologize you had to wait this long for us to get you out. Due to your unfortunate mission failure, we had to take some precautions.\" Claudia pressed her lips into a thin line, daring to ignore the instinct that told her to remain silent. \"The man…\" she began, her voice like dry leaves. \"What?\" The woman interrupted, her entire demeanor suddenly gone cold. Vivid blue eyes and a bright yellow cape flashed through her mind. \"I knew him.\" Claudia said quietly. Silence. The woman tilted her head to calmly address the man on her left, \"Notify the others to prep the Room. They'll have to wipe her immediately once we return.\" The man nodded and reached into his pocket as the other moved towards Claudia. Her blood roared in her ears and her heart rate spiked in terror at the woman's orders. Claudia shot off the bed, striking like a viper to jam her wrist up the man's jaw with a satisfying crunch. He staggered backwards, completely stunned. The woman frowned, and the second man put away his communicator to grab her next when the door was slammed open, roughly shoving the man into the wall behind it. Claudia blinked at the girl who stood illuminated by the fluorescent lighting. Her green eyes swept the room, from the surprised woman to the dazed men, and finally to Claudia. Claudia frowned when she recognized her. The woman made a bitter sound as she registered the girl's presence, \"You've failed your missions with Hector Ramirez, Jason Todd, and now this one.\" She turned away from Alex to stare stonily at Claudia, \"Coincidence? Perhaps the Order let you go on without visiting the Room for too long.\" The woman took a menacing step towards Claudia, \"I wonder. How much do you really remember?\" She pulled out a gun. Claudia gritted her teeth and shifted forward. Alex abruptly rammed into the woman just as the shot fired, puncturing the wall just behind Claudia. Alex shoved her roughly into the left wall. She dug her elbow into the woman's lower spine and slammed her into the wall again, just for good measure. Alex kept a tight grip on the back of the woman's head and neck so that she wouldn't lean back and jam Alex's nose in. \"Why does your stupid Order want me dead?\" Alex demanded through clenched teeth. \"I don't answer to you ,\" the woman said humorlessly. Alex shoved the woman's forehead into the wall, and a crack nearly formed on the white paint. \" Tell . Me .\" \"Claudia,\" the woman exhaled with eerie calmness. \"Finish her.\" Claudia felt her frame go rigid as her program threatened to take over. Her hands fisted and she visibly struggled to fight it. Alex glanced back warily. \"Claudia,\" the woman repeated, more tersely. \" Finish her .\" Claudia's hands twitched, her expression devoid of any emotion. Then her eyes darkened angrily, and she broke into a quick stride towards her. Alex's eyes widened in a moment of panic, \"Wait – \" Instead, Claudia grabbed the woman fiercely by her bent elbow and jerked her out of Alex's grip, briefly surprising Alex. Claudia forced the woman down on her knees, twisting her arm until it was at an unnatural angle. The woman gasped in pain and looked up at Claudia in sudden terror. Alex watched as Claudia stared down at the woman, leaning in for emphasis. \" I don't answer to you ,\" Claudia said slowly and menacingly. Then she punched her lights out. One of the men got up suddenly, and in the blink of an eye had Alex in his grip with the barrel of a gun pointed at her temple. \"Make one move,\" the man began, his eyes focused intensely on Claudia, \"and your daugh –\" Alex nimbly twisted out of his chokehold and flipped him onto his back, knocking the wind out of him. She scowled and kicked him in the face, rendering him unconscious. Breathing heavily, Alex brushed the loose strands of her braid back and slipped back her hood. Still in a defensive crouch, she looked over at Claudia with distrust and hesitance. Claudia merely stood still, making no indication of attacking. She gazed at Alex with mild curiosity etched in the sharp features of her once gentle face. \"Why did you help me?\" she finally asked. \"I tried to kill you.\" \"Yeah. Heartwarming.\" \"I was following orders. My program is hardwired to do so.\" Claudia explained, \"Lately, though, it's become… possible to disobey.\" Her voice lowered to a mumble as she pondered to herself, \"That's probably why they want to put me back in the Room.\" \"Program?\" Alex repeated, \"What did they do to you? Are you part cyborg now or something?\" \"No.\" Alex waited impatiently for Claudia to continue, but she didn't. \"Well what are you then? What did they do to you in 'the Room' ?\" she air quoted with a bit of sarcasm. \"I'm not sure.\" Claudia's voice was soft. \"Something terrible.\" Alex stared at Claudia for a good few minutes. Then: \"C'mon.\" \"We're just going to leave them here?\" It wasn't so much a question as they stepped over the unconscious bodies. \"They're already in a hospital, aren't they?\" Alex cracked the door open to scan the hall. \"Once the Order comes looking for them, they'll come after me next, no matter where you take me,\" Claudia warned. Alex, once confirming the coast was clear, turned around and gave Claudia a hard smile, \"Don't worry, you're good at disappearing, aren't you?\" Claudia looked slightly perplexed by the comment, but Alex said no more. She pulled her hoodie off and tossed it to Claudia. \"Here. Put this on for the meantime. We'll have to get you some civilian clothes. Hospital gowns aren't exactly incognito.\" Alex paused, \"Even though we are in a hospital. Ugh. Whatever. We're getting out of here.\" Claudia pulled the sweater over her head and stuck her hands in the sleeves. Claudia blinked dazedly as she suddenly saw the same raven-haired young boy wearing the same red hoodie. She blinked again, dizzied. \"Jason,\" the name slipped like a reflex. Alex whipped her head around, \"What?\" She registered Claudia's bewildered expression, frowned, and led them out into the hall. \"Come on.\" As they walked at an unsuspicious pace towards the elevator, Claudia immediately noticed the red stain that had spread on the side of Alex's gray thermal. \"You're bleeding,\" Claudia whispered to her, and it was almost scolding. Almost . \"Whose fault is that?\" Alex muttered back. She lightly covered her side with her palm as they stepped into the elevator. Thankfully, as they travelled down to the lower level of the parking lot, little to no people boarded the elevator or looked at them twice. They got off in the darkened lot, and Alex scanned the perimeter. \"I don't see any of their cars,\" Alex said, \"they must have left for the hotel.\" Her eyes focused on the nearest dark gray hybrid and she strode towards it. \"Ah crap,\" Alex sighed, feeling around her waist emptily, \"They left with my utility belt.\" Claudia gently moved her aside and improvised with the bobby pin in her hair. (Which wasn't just any ordinary bobby pin, of course.) The car door opened, and Claudia proceeded to hotwire the car. Alex begrudgingly got into the passenger seat. \"Which hotel?\" Claudia asked once they were buckled in. \"I'm so gonna get it,\" Alex muttered under her breath. She sighed and gave Claudia directions.[Chapter 25] They had to make a detour, just in case someone had somehow managed to follow. Also, because there was no need to alert the media about the same woman taken into custody barely a day ago making a break out from the mental facilities ward. Not for another hour, at least. Alex had left Claudia in the car as she walked into a clothing store en route to the hotel. Unfortunately, New York was pricey. Fortunately, Bruce Wayne had introduced her to the curious little miracle worker known as a platinum card. Brushing off the pain of her bleeding wound like it wasn't even there, Alex walked into the store and began to browse casually. \"Are you finding everything all right this evening, miss?\" Haha, no. Alex folded her arms across her ribs to hide the stain that had inched its way to her sweater. She practiced a smile at the young woman who probably had a totally normal life where she didn't have to buy clothes for her mother who had tried to kill her and also hot-wired a Hybrid to escape the people who were apparently now trying to reboot her. \"Yeah, uh, where do you have your women's clothes?\" \"Oh, you'll find those farther down the store to your left.\" \"Perfect. Thank you.\" Alex hustled before she could pass out from blood loss, snagging a plain fresh t-shirt for herself as she sped along. \"I have absolutely no idea but I'm pretty sure you don't mind jeans,\" she muttered to herself. She picked one that looked like it would fit, and then she grabbed a white V-neck Then she grabbed one of those ratty caps intended to look worn out but be stylish, and a cotton sweater. It probably wasn't coordinated but there was no time for that. Alex waited impatiently at the register until she was next, and then she limped the hell out of there. (Her knee was starting to hurt. Probably from one of the many times she was embarrassingly hurtled onto concrete like a rag doll.) She practically collapsed into the backseat and shut the door. Claudia glanced back at her, \"Are you all right?\" \"Why is everyone asking that question today of all days,\" Alex muttered. She hastily unzipped her sweater and peeled off her shirt that only Alfred could probably get miraculously cleaned at this point. \"Ow, ow, ow, ow!\" She whimpered in pain, looked down at the now pink-stained bandages on her ribs, and cautiously put on the other one. \"UGH. Okay, here,\" Alex dug into the paper bag for the clothes and tore off the tags. \"Don't know if it's your style but,\" she tossed them to the front. \"Thank you.\" Claudia said gratefully. She began to change, and Alex lied down across the seat in the back, holding back the rising bile in her throat. \"Ready?\" Claudia asked shortly afterwards. There was mild concern in her tone. \"Just drive please.\" [[Jason's POV]] He stands under the shower head for the longest time. The hot water runs over his sore muscles and fresh scars. His hair falls in his eyes and the steam clears his lungs. When he finishes, he changes into a clean set of clothes that had appeared on his bed. With a quiet snort, he changes into the new pair of jeans (at least Bruce knew better than to give him fancy dress pants) and a white V-neck. There's a blazer to go with it, but he leaves that aside. Already out of mindless tasks to do, he decided to collapse backwards onto the bed. It cushioned his fall, and he draped an arm over his eyes. He aches in a way that has nothing to do with the bruises that blossomed on his skin. He can feel the darkness that had always haunted him creeping out from the oceanic depths of his mind. He's almost too tired to fight it. Too tired to care about drowning in it. He sighs heavily and sits up. He decides to nose around the lobby. Maybe steal some mints from Dick's suite. (He wishes he had War and Peace lying around to read or something.) He locks the room behind him and tucks away the key card. He walks towards the elevator and pushes the button to take him to the main floor. Jason waits with his hands tucked into his pockets. The doors chime open, and he steps in with a bunch of soft-hair long-legged models. Jason realizes it was probably Fashion Week, and with Bruce Wayne abruptly in town, he'd probably already been invited (pleadingly) to attend. Surprisingly, models were not at all what he needs right now. Or ever, probably. But boy was Roy missing out. They were already giggling charmingly, and even more so when they make room for him. \"Hi there,\" one of them says with a near perfect smile. \"Ladies,\" he replies kindly, tipping an imaginary hat. More smiles. He keeps his back to them, facing forward, and that's the end of the harmless flirting. They carry on their own busied conversations, and get out a couple floors before he did. \"You should consider joining the business,\" one of them calls back as they step onto their floor. \"It would be a loss if you didn't,\" another encourages. Jason merely smiles and waves at them just before the doors closed again with a soft chime. He ends up in the lobby, looks around with clear disinterest, and picks an armchair to sit in. It gives him the view outside the clear glass windows. The lull of passing cars and people and umbrellas numb him in a peaceful way. Nothing interesting really catches his attention until two people walk into the hotel. Two women. Neither of them carry luggage. The taller one has her arm wrapped around the younger. It's made to look affectionate, but Jason can recognize the latter figure from any rooftop in Gotham. Especially when injured. Jason pushes himself out of the chair. \"We're with Bruce Wayne,\" he hears Alex say softly to the man at the desk. \"I'll need to see some identification - \" \"It's okay,\" Jason interrupts, practically tripping over himself. Alex looks at him in instant and pure relief, and it warms his heart. He shows the man his ID and tells him what room Alex is staying in. The man gives her a key card and tells them, rather dismissively, to have a nice day. \"You look like hell, kid,\" Jason whispers, immediately taking her under his arm for a hug. She leans into him and returns the tight hug. \"My stitches came apart,\" she sounds drained. \"What happened?\" \" She saved me from the Order.\" Jason had entirely dismissed the woman that had brought Alex in. That, and he hadn't recognized her. Turning slowly to face her, Jason lets his eyes travel from the floor to meet her eyes. \"Only because she saved mine first,\" Claudia says softly. Jason can't stop staring. Claudia flickers her gaze away after a few seconds. \"Thank you,\" he croaks. His tone is thick with sincerity, and it only almost cracks with emotion. She shifts in place and shrugs jerkily. Then she starts to turn away. \"Don't leave,\" the words blurt out of him as a rush of dread simultaneously floods his lungs. Claudia slows and glances tentatively over her shoulder. Jason exhales shakily, racing his fingers through his hair, \"Stay. For a little longer.\" \"I'm not sure that's the best thing to do.\" But she doesn't keep walking. Instead, she turns all the way back around to look at him. Jason forces himself to snort in good humor, but it's half-hearted. \"Since when have we ever done what's best?\" Claudia allows herself a twitch of a smile, and it pulls at Jason, drawing him impulsively towards her. Just like when they were clumsy, dangly-limbed teenagers who couldn't keep their hands off each other. \"I'm gonna puke. For several reasons,\" Alex mutters, but he can feel her sympathetic pat on his back. Jason smiles and looked up at Claudia, tilting his head to motion for her to follow. At first he doesn't think he hears her footsteps, but when they get on the elevator, she's already taken the space beside him. Alex falls asleep in Dick and Tim's room. Theirs happens to have an extra bed, and that's where Dick stitches her up again. Jason would have preferred to do it himself, but there is a palpable trust in the way Alex lies still, her eyes closed, as Dick works carefully at her side. He speaks to her softly, and Jason wonders, as per usual, just how many times Dick had been around to do this instead of him. Jason watches her, curled up on Dick's bed in a clean gray hoodie and a pair of sweats Tim had apparently thought to bring. Her expression is finally at ease. \"I'll be staying here,\" Tim says to him. He's on his own bed, with a fresh copy of The Unbearable Lightness of Being in his lap. \"You can go have dinner downstairs, if you want.\" He's about to say he's not hungry, but then thinks that maybe Claudia is. \"Thanks.\" (He realizes he's been saying that word a lot lately). \"By the way, where did you get that book?\" \"Earlier I went to a bookstore two blocks away. It's nice. Quiet. And it's open until 1 AM.\" \"I'll be back later, then,\" Jason looks at the digital clock. It's almost ten. \"Have fun,\" his adoptive brother says. There is an undercurrent of mild amusement and taunting implication in his tone, and Jason does not resist smacking a pillow over his head. He finds Claudia in his room, sitting on the sofa by the window. She has her knees tucked into her chest, and her reflection shows him the distant dimness in her lowered gaze. He clears his throat quietly and she turns around attentively. \"You hungry?\" he thumbs over his shoulder to the hallway. She shakes her head and offers a smile, but it looks more like a grimace. \"How's Alex?\" Jason lingers at the doorway, unsure. He then lets the door fall slowly shut. He goes over to her, but doesn't it. \"She fell asleep.\" He crams his hands into the pockets of his jeans, \"She'll be okay.\" \"It's easy to see you two care a lot about each other,\" She looks a little forlorn, \"All of you do.\" \"Well, it's not like this all the time. You just caught us on a good day. Ironically.\" She hums, and the sound abruptly brings back the ache in his chest. He's aware that she's unaware that Alex is his - their daughter. If anything, she probably thinks Alex is his sister, what with the eyes. But shouldn't she be able to see herself in Alex's nose, in the halo of her hair? He clears his throat again - this time it's to clear the rawness he's starting to feel. \"Well, if you do get hungry,\" he grabs his sweater off the arm of the sofa, \"you're welcome to join Dick and Bruce and everyone else downstairs.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"A bookstore. Tim says it's two blocks away. I'm hoping I'll find it.\" She stands in a heartbeat, \"I'll walk with you.\" Jason feels his own heart stutter. \"…Really?\" \"Yeah. If you get mugged who's going to save your ass?\" An old smile touches his lips, and she reciprocates.[Chapter 26] A/N: I started this in 2013? And it's 2016? What the hell? Will this ever end? Yes. …Just not with this chapter lol. Damn, I almost completely gave up on this. But somehow you guys keep finding it and liking it and following it and commenting and I just – I appreciate it all. Wow. Thank you. If you need a refresher, go back to the previous stuff (to keep you occupied until the next chapter! laughs nervously ) Favorite song for this chapter: Hold On for Your Life – Sam Tinnesz It's about two in the morning when Eddie is groggily awoken to the relentless knocking on his door. \"What is that?\" he grumbles into his pillow. \"Oh you hear it too,\" Nate's retort is tossed at him through the darkness of the hotel room. Eddie waits, and Nate waits, and the knocking continues unforgivingly, and then: \"Well I guess I'm answering it, then,\" Eddie rolls clumsily off his bed, accidentally knocking his ankle into the nightstand. \"Ow,\" he whispers, snapping on the lamp. The warm glow drapes over the room and he can hear the rain pattering on the other side of the curtains. Nate makes no audible complaints, but yanks the comforter over his head. \"That's right, if I'm not sleeping neither are you,\" Eddie grumbles as he pads barefoot across the stiff carpeting to the door. He flings it open rather brashly, but immediately loosens in surprise when he sees Alex. \"Hey,\" his tone comes out soft and confused. She looks at him, and there's a sadness to her that catches him by surprise, even though at this point it really shouldn't. \"Hey,\" she echoes breathily. She's in sweats and a t-shirt with her hair braided back, and it's all such a stark contrast to her belligerent knocking that he's left dazedly wondering if she's somebody he hasn't met yet. Before he can think of something else to say, she huffs a laugh. It's anything but amused. \"Uhm,\" she looks suddenly uncomfortable, as if she abruptly realized she was there, at his door, at 2:03 in the darkened morning. \"Sorry,\" she blurts out, shaking her head, looking around the corridor for nothing. \"Sorry. I don't know what I was – \" Eddie pulls the door closed behind him and, with a weary smile, gently eases her into him in a careful embrace, until she pulls herself the rest of the way in with her fingers gripping the cotton of his shirt. She settles like a home against him, and they stay that way, her breathing into his shoulder, and his hand warm and solid on her back. \"I grew up with bituminous in my mouth and sulfur smelling like rotten eggs and I first started to cough because my lungs were like cardboard; and what we called snow was gray with black flecks that were like glue when it came to snowballs and made then hard and crusty, though we still ate the snow anyhow, and as for filth, well, start with smoke, I carried it with me I know everywhere and someone sitting beside me in New York or Paris would know where I came from, we would go in for dinner – red meat loaf or brown choucroute – and he would guess my hill, and we would talk about soot and what a dirty neck was like and how the white collar made a fine line; and I told him how we pulled heavy wagons and loaded boxcars every day from five to one A.M. and how good it was walking empty-handed to the no. 69 streetcar and how I dreamed of my bath and how the water was black and how a candle instructed me.\" Jason lets his eyes linger on the words of Gerald Stern. He lowers the book to his lap, smile tilted nostalgically across his mouth. They are sitting comfortably on the otherwise uncomfortable wooden floor, shoulder to shoulder. At least, almost. Jason has noticed that she keeps putting an inch of space between them every now and then whenever she gets too close. As though she is hesitant about him. He feels similarly about her, he thinks. She leans in (again, seemingly subconsciously) to skim her eyes down the page. \"I like that one,\" she murmurs. Her quiet tone is almost loud in the dark, bouncing off the faded wallpaper and resonating like a finger on the lip of a glass cup. The bookstore had closed an hour ago. (Jason easily broke in, expertly disarming the alarm with some protesting from Claudia which boy, had been amusingly reminiscent.) So the place is swallowed in the dark, with the exception of the streetlights filtering in through the rain-flecked windows. It's just the two of them in the golden spill of a single lamp, in company of the tired spines of old books. Jason realizes he's been kind of obviously staring at her like an idiot. What a charmer, eh? He hastily lets the book flip closed. \"Yeah,\" he says, clearing his throat. \"It's been a favorite of mine since high school.\" Claudia pulls her knees into herself, and the action is such a sharp tug on his memory – of a teenage her sitting in his room – that he puts another safe inch between them. \"Was that…did we know each other, back then?\" Claudia asks quietly, and Jason is completely startled, like he'd been punched in the face by a brick. Had she…did she remember something? Although the question was gritted out through clenched teeth, there was genuine longing in it, too; he realized she was grabbing at broken pieces, trying to, but she was afraid. Adamant. Jason nods slowly, dares to meet her eyes because he naively thinks he can wrestle the hope trying to flood through him. \"Sophomore year. You were a transfer student. An infamous recipient of the Bruce Wayne Foundation,\" he snickers, not at her, but at the younger, more disgruntled Claudia Ramirez in preppy uniform. Claudia seems to consider something before turning her head away, her damp hair moving like a curtain. \"Wayne? As in whose son I nearly killed?\" Jason feels a rock drop in his stomach, immediately sinking any possibility of lightheartedness in conversation. No, they weren't teenagers anymore. They weren't the same lanky kids they were back then, with nothing but problems that seemed all but miniscule now. Time and circumstances had been cruel, to both of them. \"Claudia, that wasn't – \" \"Don't,\" she huffs a faint laugh, but it's lost, and there's self-loathing. Jason is all too familiar with it. \"I did. I did all those things that I'm sure Hector,\" there's an abrupt pause, as though she choked on air, but it then lapses into a more pensive silence. Jason stuffs his hands under his arms, resisting the cautious attempt to touch her shoulder. \"I'm sure Hector has told you. He's tailed me for a long time, but he still doesn't know everything. I've done so much damage. So much kept under the radar.\" Claudia still doesn't look at him. \"I didn't always want to do those things,\" she adds in a whisper, like it's a secret she's terrified of admitting aloud because somebody might hear, and he gets the sense it's the first time she's said it out loud, and Jason feels like his heart is being hammered into glass chips because her voice is so small that he could hold it in his hands, and it hurt, looking at her hurt. \"I know what that's like,\" he says before he can bite his tongue from stopping himself. \"Or, maybe not,\" he back petals, \"I…I've done a lot of really, really bad things in the past. But, I wasn't being controlled or, or stripped entirely of who I was. I just, I had a set of ideals that clashed with, with what was considered good . To put it simply, I was lost. Maybe I'd misled myself. After all, my life wasn't something that made me…good.\" He leans his head back on the wall and closes his eyes, because he doesn't think he can bear her reaction to the next words tumbling clumsily past his lips, \"But I had you.\" The space she's taking up next to him is still, and Jason continues, so very gently and genuinely, \"I had you. And you called me out on my bullshit, but at the same time you understood . And it wasn't just that. It was…it was you and god, Claud,\" the nickname slips but he doesn't care because she's here . She's right next to him. And maybe she doesn't know him, maybe he doesn't know her anymore either. But none of that matters, because what she was to him will always be the same. \"I would've done anything for you.\" The rain on the glass in his ears, and his heart is beating so damn fast he may as well be telling her he loves her for the very first time. (He almost laughs acridly because technically, that's exactly what this is.) He looks down at his palms, scarred from the past as much as she and he were, \"Yes, Claudia, you've done those things…it doesn't mean you've gotta face them alone. And I promise no one's ever going to make you do those things again.\" There is a steady pause. She doesn't say anything. He doesn't continue, either. The open-ended implication lingers in the space between them. I'm here. You have me. He doesn't think she'll take it. But she does. Claudia puts her hand atop his. It's a light, feathering motion, so much so that Jason is suddenly convinced that she's a ghost. Or an elaborately construed figment of his imagination. (Because honestly, his mind would be twisted enough to do something that perversely cruel to him.) She couldn't possibly be real. Except that she is. Claudia clasps his hand tightly, and she becomes tangible. Jason feels himself breathe. They stay that way. Her fingers grow warm, and, after some moments, Claudia Ramirez permits her tired eyes to briefly close just as Jason makes a soft snore in his sleep. They're at McDonald's, and Alex flicks a French fry at Nate's head. Nate, still with his disheveled bed head and rumpled pajamas, doesn't even react to the golden potato-ness hit his face. His sleep-ridden eyes merely flicker to Alex. She smiles at him. \"Should you even be eating? You got stabbed.\" \"That's a good excuse as any to eat,\" she dips the French fry in ketchup and pops it in her mouth. Nate laughs breathily through his nose, \"Touché.\" Eddie rejoins them at their booth, sidling easily next to Alex. \"How was the bathroom?\" Nate inquires with an arched eyebrow. \"Somewhat better than Gotham's. Surprisingly .\" Eddie snickers back, \"Considering it's New York.\" \"Well any place is significantly more pristine than home sweet home,\" Nate muffles his yawn with the sleeve of his hoodie. \"You sure you don't want like a coffee or something?\" Alex asks him, still smiling but also still amusingly concerned. Nate shakes his head and leans his head against the wall with a dull thud, \"I'm great, really.\" \"A sundae?\" Eddie offers, spooning his own into his mouth. \"Nah. I'm still trying to figure out whether I'm lactose intolerant or not.\" Alex nudges his foot under the table. Nate opens his eyes drearily and smiles and it's soft around the edges. \"I'm going to get you a cookie,\" she declares. \"Chocolate chip.\" She gets up and so does Eddie, letting her pass. \"Two, please,\" Nate calls out, eyes still closed, mouth still crooked. McDonald's still has a trickle of customers at two thirty in the morning. New York is a busy place at all hours, not unlike Gotham. Alex is surprised to think she prefers the isolated loudness of home . The past couple of days have felt like weeks. And she feels so…different. She looks back at herself, and doesn't recognize any of what she once was. She feels tired. A deep-in-her-bones exhaustion. \"Hi may I take your order?\" She's drawn out of her daze (something that happens frequently, now) and steps up to the counter. \"Hi. I'll have two chocolate chip cookies please.\" The cashier puts in the numbers. \"Sure. Will that be all?\" \"Yes.\" Alex fumbles with the change in her pocket and a couple of coins fall out. She hands the cashier the faded dollar bills (Eddie's money that she'd literally pickpocketed seconds ago) and kneels to pick up the fallen nickels. The man standing in line behind her begins to help. \"Thank you,\" Alex looks at him, and all the blood in her body seems to stop cold. It's one of the men from the hospital. He looks at her, left eye bruised, and gives a composed knowing smile. He says nothing else as he lets the coins fall into her opened hand. He gets up and leaves. Alex remains crouched, her face pale in the bright lighting. The next customer scoffs impatiently and steps around her. Alex stands up, swaying from the head rush, and glances around in thinly veiled panic. \"Miss? Your cookies?\" Alex whips back around and the cashier is holding out the paper bag, a bewildered look on her face. \"Keep it,\" she croaks. She practically stumbles back to their table. Nate is nodding off and Eddie is scraping at the last of his sundae. \"We gotta go,\" she grabs Eddie, fisting his sweater and pulling him out of his comfortable position. \"Nate wake up ,\" she hisses and shakes him by the shoulder. \"Ow,\" Eddie frowns as he regains his balance, \"Alex what the – \" \"The guys from the hospital, the ones that tried to get Claudia. They're here and we have to leave now .\" The words are flying out of her mouth and she's trying really damn hard to keep her voice from shaking because she shouldn't be this afraid . Nate, heavy and confused, lets her take him by the arm and rush him and Eddie along. \"Alex,\" Eddie mumbles, immediately alert and hovering almost protectively over her, \"if they're here – \" \"They are ,\" she barks hoarsely as they're outside and the freezing darkness blows over them. \"Then we can't go back to the hotel,\" Eddie's eyes are dark and the raindrops harden the lines of his face. \"They probably already know we're there. They've probably known all along and were just waiting.\" \"Waiting for what?\" Nate asks, shielding himself from the rain. \"For the right time.\" Alex grimaces, \"'Till we were all separated.\" Just then, all three of them stop. Ahead of them, in the sickly yellow glow of an old streetlight, stands a lone figure shrouded in a long coat. \"What the hell,\" Nate mutters, tensing. The figure looms out from beneath the flickering light in steady, purposeful steps. \"Hey!\" Alex shouts, clenching her hands and fighting the screaming urge to turn and flee. \" Who are you? \" The figure continues to approach them wordlessly. Alex starts forward – and honestly she has no idea what the hell she's doing – but someone, Eddie, quickly tugs her back and begins pulling her, \"Alex, run !\" The rumble of thunder punctuates him and clears her head and then they're all running, sneakers splashing wetly across the pavement as they try to vanish in the darkness.[Chapter 27] I will finish this, no matter how many more years (however ridiculous, I apologize) it may take! Much thanks and deep gratitude for those who continue to favorite, follow, comment and miraculously recall everything that has built up to this point in Alex's life. I construed her at a younger age than I am now, and for that I hold her very close to my heart…and I am so sorry for what's to come. The end starts here. (Song that is pretty much the essence of this chapter and ones that follow: In The End, by Tommee Profit, Jung Youth, Fleurie) Chapter 27 The asphalt was a soft, blackish river on which cars traveled, windows shut and speckled with grayed rain. New York was a crowded muck of a jungle, its inhabitants indifferent to the threat that trickled through like black oil in a rushing current. The three of them held absolutely still in the rotten confines of an old telephone booth, soaked in sweat and sewer gunk. They'd slipped into a manhole, and would have taken a number of blind turns were it not for Nate's wristwatch—a token from Dick himself—which projected a layout of the city that he'd downloaded prior to arriving. Alex could not stop shivering. \"Think it's okay to step out now?\" The words misted out in front of her, barely trembling in the heavy silence. It was nearly impossible to see outside through the layers of grime etched into the glass. She was not one prone to claustrophobia—or so had been her preconceived notion—but right now she was wrestling with the increasing impulse to just start screaming. She preferred to get out before she could lose that battle. So far, the night was really tallying up against her. \"It's now or never,\" Eddie responded with a tight grimace. Alex was pressed into his chest, from lack of elbow room in the booth. ( Or so she kept telling herself .) Despite his even breathing, she could feel the hard rhythm of his heart through the firm bones of his ribcage. He shifted to reach for the door handle, the wet sleeve of his t-shirt brushing against her cheek, and jimmied with it until the door popped open. They practically fell forward into the relentless assault of rain. Brushing herself off, Alex did a brisk recon up and down the alleyway, affirmed they were seemingly safe, and then peered up along the walls to the rooftops. From this angle, there was visibly nothing. \"We're clear,\" she murmured, mostly to herself. \"What do we do now?\" Aside from the occasional \"left here, right up ahead,\" Nate had been mostly pale and silent. The shadows thrown out from the yellow flickering streetlight aged him. His gaze shifted to Alex, and she caught the glimmer of fear that had drifted in and out from his level composure. Had she blinked, she would have entirely missed it. But she didn't. And right then and there Alex knew, accepted , that she was the sole one culpable for being here, with her, smack in the middle of the train wreck that was her life. Both him and Eddie. She tried to swallow down the guilt that gathered thickly and suddenly at her throat. It didn't work. \"I don't know,\" she shook her head and pushed her sopping hair back, tightening her fingernails into her scalp, closing her eyes, \"I don't know.\" \"Alex…\" She opened her eyes again, saw Eddie's hands twitch, hesitant to reach out to her. She felt her eyes well up, the tears hot in contrast to the rain sweeping down her temple and cheeks, past her lips and chin. This was it, she was going to splinter and break. She winced suddenly, and frowned. Holding her breath, she carefully peeled her hoodie up to inspect the damage. Somehow, through the adrenaline, she'd almost completely forgotten. The blood, dangerously dark, blossomed through the bandages, through her shirt, like a scarlet pupil. \" Fuck .\" She heard Eddie's soft intake of breath. Then she heard herself laugh. Hollowly. Humorlessly. She gestured emptily, her hands falling limply at her sides again. \"How am I still even here ?\" She shook her head in disbelief, some of it actual awe. She couldn't stop the grin that twisted her mouth. \"I mean, I'm falling apart at the seams. Literally.\" She chuckled again, \"God, I should have stayed dead, huh?\" Agitation, pain, speared Eddie's expression, and he flinched, \"Alex.\" The grin dropped from her expression. \"We have to figure out what's happening. Find who, or what, is behind all of this.\" \"Okay,\" she said curtly, \"Let's see. That man back there was one of the guys who tried to kill Claudia in the hospital. Now, they didn't send him after her, he was sent after me . Him and who knows how many others. I inadvertently, stupidly made us all targets. I don't even know if my family —\" Eddie surged forward then, sneakers sloshing in the groundwater, until he was right there. He pulled her in close, where there was warmth and safety and life in the drum of his beating heart. Alex, startled, let her cheek press into his chest as she tried to recover some of her composure. She clutched him back fiercely, still feeling small, but not so desolate. He spoke softly, and she felt the words hum from his chest, \"We're going to keep out of their reach for as long as possible. We just need to get into contact with Bruce. Or your dad —\" \"Isn't accounted for,\" she interrupted lowly, gently extracting herself from his arms. \"Maybe they're in trouble, too,\" Nate's voice drew her back in. It was what she hadn't had the courage to address, to voice into the atmosphere, all this time. Alex flickered her gaze to Eddie once again, let him map the dread in her eyes. Should she get consumed by it, maybe he would be the one to pull her out. She didn't trust herself to do it alone. Breathing shakily, Alex dipped her hand into her pants pocket and pulled out her \"emergencies-only\" burner phone with delicately trembling hands. The sore panic in her chest fractured further when the ringing went on for more than once. At some point Tim had dozed off, slouched in the armchair by the floor lamp. His fingers curled loosely just above the thick rug. The paperback novel lay next to an empty mug of tea beside his bare ankles. Slowly, silently, one of the curtains started flickering. It swayed infinitesimally with the cool draft that crept into the room, flipping open a dog-eared page. The rest of the room remained in unmoving darkness, purposefully stilled as though in sentient anticipation. Tim's eyes snapped open just as the knife came plummeting downward, his hand shot upward to grip the wrist that yielded it. Tim struggled as the masked figured increased the pressure, inching the wavering blade closer and closer to his eye. Tim clenched his teeth and let out a strangled noise as he gathered enough strength to plant his footing and surge forward, shoving the figure backwards so that they shattered onto the glass coffee table. The figure immediately rolled, their back barely skimmed the ground for hardly a second, before they bounded gracefully out the window once more, scaling up the hotel building to the floor above. Tim swore under his breath, grabbed the backpack stashed under his mattress, and sprinted barefoot out the door with a hard slam. Damian sat alone on the soft rug above the paneled wood, patiently wrapping a fresh bandage around his tender forearm. He'd flipped off all the ceiling lights, partial to the more tangible warmth of the lamplight set on the dresser. Bruce had left moments ago to make a call to Alfred, to check if there had been any influx of underground or suspicious activity in Gotham City since the incident with Claudia. He thought back to Alex, to what he'd said to her only hours ago, but what already felt like a lifetime. \"…despite having all of us, it's not enough for you.\" Now, after everything that had happened immediately after that — the black SUV ramming into them, Claudia attempting to kill Alex, and Alex almost… He recalled that scene vividly, how he had pushed himself so weakly off the pavement, how he'd watched the absolute neutrality in the woman who was supposed to be Alex's mother as she relentlessly struck down on her own daughter like a cobra. Damian's thoughts directed him, briefly, to Talia. He shook his head with an unintentional wince. Then, barely discernible, a sound. Reacting as sharply as only he could, Damian ducked just as the whisper of the blade sliced the air where his head had been. Rolling forward, he pulled out the shuriken from his discarded satchel and leaped to his feet, whisking around and hurling two fistfuls of them at his attacker. The blades successfully whistled through the air and wedged themselves into the vague outline of the figure, clad in all black. There was a grunt as they were forcefully pinned back to the wall. The door behind him burst open, and Damian unsheathed another set of blades from his wrist cuffs, hurling them with a shout. There was the airy, clinking sound of metal puncturing metal, and Damian straightened up in surprise to see Tim silhouetted in the doorframe—unscathed, thankfully— his staff peppered with Damian's ninja stars. Damian said nothing, but he felt the fist in his chest unclench in relief. \"You missed, I'm fine, no worries, thanks for asking.\" Tim offered dryly. He jammed the base of his staff to the floor once, effectively discarding the blades. \"Did one of these guys come after you, too?\" Damian jerked his head in the direction of his pinned attacker. \"I followed him up here. I will never lack appreciation for Bruce's training simulations of being attacked in my sleep in my more formative years.\" \"Where is Bruce? And Dick?\" \"That's what I'm trying to find out.\" Tim's glare hovered over to the silhouette. His eyes narrowed. Damian kept close by Tim as they both warily approached the seemingly unconscious attacker. Tim reached out to remove the mask, but the figure abruptly clamped his hand around Tim's wrist, then twisted it. There was an awful crunching sound, and Tim muffled his cry through clenched teeth, but reflexively swung up his other fist. In a seemingly effortless shrug, the figure instantly freed himself from Damian's shuriken blades, all of which clattered to the floor. He caught Tim's fist in a solid grip. Tim used his momentum, and his now dislocated wrist, to twist upwards and kick his foot into the figure's face. Breaking free, he cartwheeled out of the way. His footing faltered a bit, however, and he stumbled backwards into the dresser with a grimace. The lamp toppled over, spilling vivid bright light and their limber shadows across the room. The figure, straightening up soundlessly, drew out dual broadswords from behind his back, and flourished them with a deadly whispering sound. Damian shouted as he pulled out a spare sword from underneath the thick floor rug, lunging forward. It met with the opponent's crossed blades with a vibrating clang. Damian dodged the figure's fluid sideways and diagonal swipes at him, but he was slowly being forced backward. Whoever this person was, they were an affluent fighter; they did not allow any time for Damian to root his footing, and they allowed no vulnerable gaps for Damian to strike a potent jab. Baring his teeth, Damian flipped backwards on his own accord, grabbed a nearby armchair by its legs, and hurled it. It was a less graceful approach, but they were past trying to maintain any grace. This was about survival. The figure sliced the chair in half with the broadswords and leaped forward at Damian, feet first in what would have been a splintering kick to the ribs. Tim slammed into the figure mid-air, sending the both of them landing hard and sliding across the floor, dragging the rug and the furniture atop it with them. Damian bounded over to them, but the figure twisted to their feet and brought Tim up with them, crossing the dual swords dangerously close at the skin of his neck. \"Drake,\" Damian whispered. He hadn't noticed how rapidly his heart rate had accelerated without his permission. Where was Bruce? Dick? Jason? Hector? Alex ? Something was way, way off. They hadn't come prepared for this . Drake, eyes grim, kept his mouth pressed closed, knuckles white as he gripped on to the wrists of the still unidentifiable attacker. \"Who are you?\" Damian demanded, wielding his sword defensively. \"What have you done to our family?!\" No reply. \"Tell me. NOW! \" Moving with a deftness adrenaline could only amplify, Tim rammed his elbow into the figure's gut, slipped out from between his loosened grip, and whirled around to snatch the mask off their face. Tim stumbled over to Damian's side, breathing heavily, and both watched intensely as the figure remained doubled over, but otherwise unruffled. Reclaiming their breathing to a quiet steadiness, the figure finally lifted their head, allowed light to splay the truth across their face. Damian's sword clattered to the floor. Tim exhaled sharply. The trio splashed wetly through the alleyways of New York to navigate their way back to the hotel, sprinting and oftentimes almost slipping over broken ground or piles of abandoned construction materials. Alex led the way, maintaining her placeholder as the fastest, even in spite of the agony in her bones and the reopened wound in her side. She was probably leaving a trail of blood swirling in with the murky rain, impermanently staining her legacy onto streets that weren't her own. She skidded into the turn that brought them back onto the more populous sidewalks, the hotel brightly lit and the exterior seemingly intact on the street across them. \"Nothing,\" Nate noted in breathless surprise. \"Don't always believe what you see,\" Alex clenched her fists at her sides. She booked it to the other side, effortlessly skimming over the hoods of cars as they screeched to clumsy halts and blared their horns at her. \"Alex, wait !\" Eddie called out, but he was drowned out by a flash of lightning and the tumultuous crashing wave of thunder. Alex burst through the double doors of the hotel, which was such a stark contrast to her own reality, with people in wealthy coats and elegant clothes and expensive glasses of chardonnay and the rich tune of a piano reverberating through the lobby. She knew she caught the attention of several people when gasps sprouted in patches through the crowd. She was certainly a sight; dripping rain and dripping blood, and a limp to her stagger. \"Ma'am!\" The doorman ushered to her, \"Pardon me but you cannot be here —\" \"Shut it and listen up,\" Alex snapped, grabbing a fistful of his white collar and yanking him close, \"I need you to clear the entire hotel, every damn floor. Do whatever it takes. Otherwise, people die. And that'll be on you . Got it?\" The doorman, ivory and wide-eyed, nodded mutely. She released him roughly and picked up her sprint to the elevator. Everyone cleared out of her way, like a river yielding to something deadly and impenetrable. Alex hobbled in, not sparing so much as a second to the two floors her family had inhabited themselves in. She knew they wouldn't be there. She punched the topmost button, for the rooftop. An alarm began to sound, loud enough to puncture eardrums, and the emergency floodlights turned on. The elevator doors smoothly glided shut, sealing her into jarring silence, and presenting her with her own reflection. Bruised face, scarred arms, clothes torn, drowned in flashing lights of black and red. Whatever fear that had rattled her to her core earlier was completely gone, wiped clean so that all she possessed was a steel-edged ferocity and a clarity that drove her to do whatever she had to. Whatever it takes , she swore to the Alex in the mirror, jaw clenched and eyes fervent. She pulled the hoodie over her head and discarded it, shredded off the bottom half of her blood-soaked shirt and tied it around her waist, gritting her teeth as she knotted the pressure over her wound. She fastened her utility belt around and over her torso, like a sash. Then, she did something she hadn't done since she was a child, freshly orphaned, freshly bruised from her first nights alone on the street, before being taken into an orphanage by… \"Alejandra, there's someone here to see you.\" Alex didn't turn around. She remained curled up on the bed, back facing the door. She clutched numbly to a stray stuffed bear they had given her. She didn't have a name for him yet. There was concerned whispering between the Sister and the visitor, then the door closed quietly. She sensed the visitor hadn't left, though. (She barely knew him, but she was immediately drawn to the soundlessness and fluidity in which he moved, especially over such squeaky floorboards. How could anyone move like that?) This notion was reaffirmed when she felt the twin bed dip from the new weight beside her. \"Hey, Alex.\" The tone was so gentle, laced with a nurturing affection that the Sisters just couldn't replicate, no matter how much they tried with her. A lump immediately swelled in her throat, traveled quickly to the corners of her eyes. She sat up and turned to face him, the kind man with brilliant blue eyes—she was from the Narrows; such a color was not the most common. He smiled. He was young, still, but there was something deeply sad about him. He'd mentioned to her—in his coaxing her out from in between two dumpsters some nights ago—that he'd just dropped out of college, but that maybe someday he would go back into it, \"become a lawyer, or something. Or maybe I'll join the circus.\" \"It's just past dinnertime. Have you eaten, yet?\" She shook her head. \"Not hungry? It's the food here, huh. Nothing too enticing, probably.\" She didn't reply, picked at a small moth hole in the knee of her jeans. \"Hey.\" Alex brought her eyes slowly to meet his again. That leaden sadness that she understood far too well for a child her age glimmered in his eyes, and reflected in her own. \"Listen,\" he sighed, rubbed a hand over his face and pushed it through his hair, nearly as sleek and black as hers. \"I know you don't know me too well. We did just meet on Tuesday.\" His light attempt at humor crumbled quickly, and he paused, seeming to gather himself, \"You're a great kid. Tough as all hell. I knew that the moment I saw you.\" He peeked a glance at her, smiled slightly. It was sincere. \"And I know you know that, too.\" Alex continued to nestle in her own silence, but that didn't mean she wasn't listening, absorbing everything he was saying and stashing it away for safekeeping, for warmth on an unforgiving rainy day. She didn't want to get attached to him. Her newfound view of the world they lived in quickly became calloused enough for her to know that she shouldn't get attached, ever. But, she suspected she was too late, that she already was. He had come by every evening since Tuesday. And, each time he went, Alex was left feeling terribly alone all over again, left only with a sore ache, and the suppressed wish that he would have just taken her home with him. \"But, I would like to help you. For as long as you'll let me.\" Her eyes snapped to him, wide, fierce, daring to hope. \"I can't adopt you,\" he looked as devastated as she felt, \"I wish. You have no idea how much I wish I could. But, there are a lot of reasons as to why I can't. For starters, college drop-outs aren't necessarily top candidates for parenting.\" He cracked a meek smile. Alex didn't care. She didn't care that he was too young to take care of her, to provide for her the way he would be expected to. She wasn't looking for a luxurious family to give her a lavish lifestyle. She just wanted her mother. But her mother was gone. And she didn't have anyone else. But…there was something significant about this sad, blue-eyed boy—who made her the first hot meal after six days of garbage scraps and thieving, who bought her new shirts, a pair of Snoopy pajamas, a crisp navy blue jacket who told her silly jokes and read her smart books that her mother also used to read to her—that made her want to cling to him and never let him be taken away from her. Like anyone else she'd ever had. \"I'll visit you as often as I can. I'm still trying to get a handle on how I'm going to navigate my own life, but I will do my best to come see you every day, okay? I promise you'll have my company. And if I ever can't, I'll call.\" Mustering all of his effort into a wide grin, he offered a small, black phone in one hand, and with the other he raised his right pinkie. \"I promise.\" Alex eyed him, gauging. She didn't want to rely on anybody. Not anymore. She wrapped her finger around his. With permission, and shock, from the Sisters, he took her out for burgers and shakes. Took her to the lake to toss sunflower seeds to the ducks that hadn't left yet, waiting until the last sweeping ray of sun burnt out. She was tired upon getting back to the orphanage. He tucked her in, paused to think. \"I'm not strictly speaking a… religious person. But, there's something my mother would do, every night before I went to sleep. Said it would keep me safe.\" Slowly, delicately, he hovered the shape of a cross over her—forehead, heart, shoulders, mouth— uttered the words in a different language; not in Spanish, like her mother would. Alex didn't recognize this one. \"Bendición.\" Alex whispered. He smiled, also whispering,\"Yeah.\" Unable to help herself, Alex shifted to secure her small arms tightly around his broad shoulders. It was not one of seeking comfort, she was delivering it. He reciprocated gently, and with a wavering whisper, \"'Night, Alex.\" \"'Night, Dick.\" Hands no longer quivering, Alex signed the cross over herself, pressing her fingers to her lips. \"Please,\" she whispered, fiercely, to anyone who might have been listening. Or maybe simply to an empty, echoing void. The elevator slowed to a stop. Chimed once, hollowly. The doors slid open.[Chapter 28] A/N: I feel like this really just needed to be its own little chapter, potent and brief. Maybe a bit M rated? Not really though, it's vanilla. This makes me really, really want to write Jason and Claudia's love story. Though we'd all know that would take me for-fucking-ever. Anyway, more to come :) Some hours earlier… . . . \" What hurts more?\" \"…Jason?\" \" A?\" SLAM. \" Or B?\" SLAM. \"Jason!\" \" Forehand?\" SLAM. \" Or backhand?\" SLAM. SLAM. SLAM— \"JAY!\" Gasping, he doubled forward. His arms ached. They were twisted behind him by a pair of silver cuffs, locking him into a cramped position. He strained against them as his head throbbed. Blood flowed over his tongue, between clenched teeth. He spat it out. Wait. Was…was that him screaming? One of the voices, the one that had pulled him out by his name, sounded faraway. The other—twisted, jarring laughter—rang more lucidly in his ears. \"A little louder, lamb chop!\" His mind scrambled to distinguish them. Which one was real? Which one? \" What hurts more?\" Jason wrenched his eyes shut, his chest heaving through obstructed breathing. He rolled to his side, felt a broken rib. No. Nonononono— \"Claudia?\" he croaked out softly, heard the silent plea in his voice. Please be real. Please. \"Yes! I'm here. I'm over here. Look at me, focus on me.\" Swallowing down the acrid tang of copper, Jason slowly opened his eyes. He winced at the bleak light that spilled directly above him from a single, swaying bulb. Clumsily propping himself up as much as the cuffs allowed him, Jason scanned the room until he found her a good twelve feet away from him, ragged and sore and anchored to the warehouse wall. Her stark hair framed her worried face, which was painted by a streak of blood across her cheek, and another deep cut over her temple, a fresh bruise near the corner of her mouth. \"I'm sorry.\" The bike chain that kept her in place rattled as she tried to move forward, \"This is all on me. I didn't mean to—I, she made me forget…\" she threw her head back against the wall, eyes shut in remorse, \"I'm so stupid .\" It came back to him then—the shattering of glass in the bookstore, the shadows that came to life, that grabbed him and beat him down, a woman's cool voice… Realization dawned, sinking into his skin like toxin. \"Esmeralda?\" The rekindled memories of Claudia's aunt—the Order, her connections to the Gotham underworld, everything she was responsible for—speared terror deep into his chest. \"She's here ?\" \"She's going after Alex. This whole thing has been set-up. She used me to lure you all out of Gotham. I wasn't in control—\" \"That insane fucking b—\" \"Jason you have to get out of here. Once Esmeralda gets to Alex, she'll—she's going to do to her what she did to me.\" Claudia's voice was thick with emotion, and Jason felt his heart clench in dread. \"She'll make Alex her puppet, too.\" \"How do I know you're not shitting me right now,\" his tone was level, quiet, but even he felt the venom in the accusation. He almost took it back. Almost. \"How do I know it's really you talking to me, and not Esmeralda's brainwashed marionette steering me into an ambush.\" Claudia looked the smallest he'd ever seen her. And this was the farthest he'd ever felt from her, including in death. He steeled himself, kept his resolve. He couldn't afford another mistake. He had to know she was still Claudia. Still someone he could trust. Someone he once knew. (Used to love.) She nodded, understanding, but she couldn't bring herself to look at him. Her hands fell into her lap, palms facing upward. On her right hand, he recognized an old scar that sliced right down the middle. How cruel was life that it allowed such things—employing death to part two people, only to bring them crashing back into one another as nothing more than strangers. \"We were…\" she almost said it, her voice wavered with it— We were in love— but she caught herself. Swallowed it down. Seemed to change direction. Jason tried not to mourn it. \"You used to have nightmares,\" she kept her gaze cast downward, \"A lot. Like the one you had just now.\" Jason said nothing. Claudia continued. \"You wouldn't tell me what happened to you, for a really long time. I didn't mind. I just remember…relief. Utter relief that, by some wildly impossible miracle, you were back. Real and not the ghost of a lost boy.\" She pressed her lips together, seemed to gather herself. \"I remember details. How you put milk in your coffee only when you missed your mother.\" Jason exhaled sharply, felt it viscerally, like he'd been punched in the gut. Claudia didn't notice. \"I remember you used to read. So much. We didn't have air conditioning in the apartment,\" (Jason wondered if she realized just how much she actually knew; she didn't even stumble over the mention that they used to live together.) \"During the summer, those rare afternoons when Gotham was uneventful, we would go to the library and, and just lounge there for hours. I remember, once you finally patched things up with Bruce, you showed me your old room. Everything had been kept exactly as you'd left it.\" Claudia pressed her lips together, fighting a smile, \"A mess . Books everywhere.\" Jason laughed, it was barely a breath, and it was one of pure disbelief. He couldn't believe she actually… \"You were an asshole. You were also actually nice, when you wanted to be. Smart, too. Columbia University material, like yours truly. You were a smartass. An assbutt.\" Claudia's smile dropped, her eyes suddenly snapped to him, wide and bewildered; the word had slipped out, as though surfaced from muscle memory. Assbutt. Jason burst out laughing, startled and sincere and simultaneously masking his sudden swell of emotion, \"Did you just call me an assbutt ?\" \"Yeah, yeah I did.\" Claudia brightened, sat up straighter, wringing her hands together. It was short-lived. Her expression immediately waned, saddened. \"It wasn't always like that. Not in the beginning, at least. When you first found me after…after you came back,\" she phrased it carefully, \"I think you said you waited almost a year until you tried to reach out to me. I remember you couldn't look me in the eye when I found out you were the one killing criminals. The Red Hood. I got upset with you, didn't I?\" This time she did look at him, her eyes level and serene. And just as he did then, he looked away. \"You were always angry. I knew it was because you were hurting. I didn't know how to help you. And one day, it finally came up when…um, well the night that we—\" she bit her lip and a laugh slipped, a laugh , soft and sheepish with the echoes of who they used to be. Jason cracked a smile, but she wasn't looking at him. Her eyes were distant, elsewhere in another time. \"You had scars… everywhere .\" It dropped to a whisper. \"I remember crying, because…because I couldn't even begin to fathom what…\" she drifted off, used the back of her hand to discreetly wipe at her eyes, \"how anyone could go through everything that you did, and then be forced to live and bear the weight of it.\" And despite all the years lost between them, Jason was still fluent enough to understand what she really meant: And now I do, too. . . . Claudia's hands, soft with benevolence and the smell of soap, cradled his face. Her fingers were everywhere, feathering over his closed eyelids, his cheekbones, the bridge of his nose, his parted lips. \" Oh, Jason,\" she touched her forehead to his, and he opened his eyes to find hers closed, lashes damp. Never in his lifetime, both before death and after it, had he felt so vulnerable. He'd put himself in this position: finding his way back to her like a man lost at sea, keeping her safe, sharing a place with her, learning from her, becoming someone new with her. What if she couldn't bear it? The scars. The permanent reminder they were. His grayed morality, Red Hood. His violent end. His violent beginning. Before Bruce and Dick and Alfred, no one had ever loved him. Surely not his dad. His mom? His mom was always unconscious. On her bed, or on the floor, or in the bathtub. Jason never got to know if she even loved him. Maybe that was why she did drugs, so that she wouldn't have to. Maybe he wasn't built to be loved. Jason continued to gaze at Claudia, committing as much of her to memory as he could. He would give her a way out, a clean slate; it was the least he owed her. He grabbed her wrists, gently, pulled away. Her eyes opened. Warm, warm brown. \" What's wrong?\" His fingers grazed from her wrists to her palms, his thumb rubbed the scarred tissue in the smooth base of her right palm. Her brow creased into a frown, her eyes flickering, \"Jay?\" He let her hands go. Then, feigning lightness with an unconvincing smirk, \"What are you gonna do when I leave?\" Claudia stared at him, not comprehending, and then it clicked. Jason read her expressions as she blew through each of them: confusion, realization, disbelief, anger, more anger. Jason braced himself for her rebuttal, prepared to reach for his clothes at the base of the bed and leave without a trace, let her continue her life the way she should: maybe marry someone who wasn't blemished by so much fucking tragedy. Claudia answered, swift and fervent and aggravated, and not what Jason had expected. \" Come after you.\" He felt his brow crease, eyes fluttering in confusion. \"Claud, no, that's not—\" She grabbed his face again, fingers smoothing down to his neck, down to clasp his bare shoulders where the map of scars began. Her eyes glimmered bright, a draft breezed in through the open window, and in the lamplight, she looked like everyone's first love. \" For someone with a ridiculously high IQ, you're an unbelievable idiot , Jason Todd,\" she whispered fiercely, exasperated. His heart raced. He dared to hope. But he didn't give in yet. He laughed breathlessly, hoped it didn't betray how broken he felt, and raised his eyebrows, \"I'm the idiot? Claud, you don't get it. I'm…me. You can be with anyone you want. Marry some pompous idiot and move into a boring house in the boring suburbs where nothing happens and a picket fence and a driveway that'll take you to any open road to any future you want.\" \" First of all, what is this, the fucking 1920's? Are you seriously trying to piss me off just so I'll leave you? Also, that notion is so incredibly sexist and, again, I know you're saying it just to piss me off. And it's working.\" She glowered at him. \" Good,\" he grinned. \" No, Jason.\" Claudia rolled her eyes, terribly exasperated. \" You don't get it. I'll say it once, and I'll say it until and long after you get it through that annoyingly thick skull of yours,\" Keeping her eyes glued to his, she closed what little space was left between them, shifted her bare legs to wrap around his waist, easing herself gently into his lap. Unable to help it, Jason felt a surge of warmth stir low in his stomach; it knocked a soft breath out of him. \" I want you .\" Her eyes just wouldn't let go of him, and he in turn couldn't bear to look away, even as she skimmed her palm delicately down his chest, his stomach, brushing over the terrain of scarred tissue where the crowbar took to him, where the mortician cut him open. His final, significantly weakened attempt: \"Maybe in another life.\" She shook her head, her long hair falling beautifully past her shoulders, her mouth twitched in mild amusement, \"This is your other life, Jason. And this one is all I have. The only one I get. And I'm sorry if it sucks but you're in it. Okay? You.\" A little short in breath, she shifted her hips again, slow. Jason shuddered, finally closed his eyes, finally let his hands roam reverently to her warm thighs, up her smooth back. His nose nudged hers, and she sighed. \" Can I kiss you?\" He asked softly. \" And when you ask me to stay, I would. I would.\" She murmured, and Jason smiled, cradled his hand to the nape of her neck, wound his calloused fingers through her hair, and drew her down for a kiss. A siren sounded in the far distance, reflecting its sound further and further until it suddenly stopped, quietly extinguished by the shimmering night. . . . Claudia was watching him with all the loss and weariness of an abandoned soul. Who had they been trying to fool? They were doomed from the start. There was no picket fence waiting for them anywhere. No boring evenings or iced lemonade waiting on the front porch. That fantasy didn't belong to them. They weren't born with the privilege to even imagine it. No, they were born into Gotham, a gritty reality that made them the reigning heirs of inherent tragedy. Jason already knew this; he knew it the first time he found his mother lying on the bathroom floor. This was just another on the long list of cruel reminders. It should have been enough to drag him under the crashing wave of isolated loneliness. Except he was less alone than when he began this convoluted journey, which was only just beginning. Her affirmation all at once sank his heart and allowed him to surface. \"It's me,\" she smiled sadly. Jason rolled himself over so that his blistered palms were no longer cramped behind him, but now pressed on cool concrete. Grimacing, he stumbled haggardly to his feet, the rush of blood prickling feeling back into his numbed legs. There was a slight limp to his step as he diminished the valley between them, until he was on his sore knees once again. With faintly trembling hands, Jason cradled Claudia's face. He brushed his thumbs along her cheekbones, face serious as his eyes took in her face for the first time, for real this time. She let out a breath, dirt and blood stained tears smearing her cheeks. She put her hands on his, gripping lightly. \"I'll come back for you. I swear ,\" he promised intensely, locking his eyes with hers. Claudia nodded, smiling wanly, \"I know. Save her, Jay.\" (What Claudia was quoting:) \" In another life I could have loved you. You'd call me yours and I wouldn't flinch. And when you ask me to stay, I would. I would.\" —Tina Tran, \"In Another Life\" ","Summary":" I wasn't sure how much more if this 'sitting still' I could take.

A/N: greetings, HUMANITY! :D I'm here with yes another story (i hope this one sticks with me... the others i've tried to write didn't work out so well in mah head). Then... Drew kicked the ball as hard as she could, still in the air, and her cleats made contact with the muddy ground as the ball flew past the goalie's frantic grasp. Her team cheered and she was high fived several times by her own team and those who were for the other team. She went over to the goalie she'd managed to get past and shook his hand. \"Good game?\" she asked. \"Good game,\" he told her, smiling, turning away towards the crowd on the bleachers. Dew also turned and grinned to see a very exhausted yet very smug Jason coming towards her, hands shoved into the pockets of his black jacket, a smirk on his face. Even though she was exhausted from running and kicking the ball so much, she ran the rest of the way to him and hugged him tightly. \"You didn't have to come, you know,\" she said, smiling. \"Of course I did,\" he said, even though they both knew he ought to be sleeping. \"You were awesome.\" \"Sure, I'm only as awesome as the boy who saves the world every single day, one person at a time,\" she grinned. \"You'll be almost as awesome as me when you're not covered in mud,\" he said to the fifteen year old. Drew scowled and looked down at herself. Her green soccer jersey, shorts, socks, and cleats were covered in mud. She wouldn't have been surprised if her face had some steaks or if her hair was matted: sometimes you just had to make a dive or six when you were goalie for half a game, playing soccer on a late Saturday afternoon. Jason was the second adoptive son of Bruce Wayne. Bruce had a lot late night company meetings and often had Jason come with him; that was why he was so tired all the time. Or, that was what he had Drew believe. Jason's cell phone rang and he answered. \"Yeah? Oh, hi Bruce. Yeah...I'm on my way.\" With a sigh, he snapped his phone shut and put it back in his black jacket pocket. He smiled at Drew apologetically. \"I got to go,\" he said, hugging her swiftly. \"Meeting?\" she asked him. \"Meeting,\" he confirmed. He leaned forward, his dark hair hanging in his mischievous, brilliant green eyes. \"I'll be back.\" \"Promise?\" she asked. \"Promise.\" He hugged her again, ruffled her hair, and walked away. Drew never thought that would be the last time she would ever see Jason Todd. Now... Drew was sitting on the same bleachers in front of the same school that she had attended for the last four years of public education. It had been five years. Five. She was remembering the soccer game, his face, his eyes, his promise. She remembered his brother calling her one night and telling her he'd died in a bombing. She'd hung up as soon as those words had come over the line and had refused to speak to anyone about anything for a week. Now here she was, five years later. Drew stood up, shoving her hands into the pockets of her navy blue jacket, hunched her shoulders against the cool wind, and walked away from the school. It only felt as if she'd received the news yesterday. As she walked along, she passed a warehouse just as a woman dressed up nice and richly rushed out, knocking her over. \"Who're you?\" the rich woman asked. She had dark hair and her eyes were narrowed. Drew got to her feet, shaking her black hair out of her eyes. \"Just walking home,\" she said. \"Sure,\" the woman said. \"I'm sure you were just spying, too.\" \"You could only be thinking that if there was a need for someone to spy on you,\" Drew said, the smart-ass part of her attitude coming back to her after spending a few hours of just sitting, freezing her butt off, while filling her mind with thoughts from the past. \"Good observation,\" the woman said, \"now, since I have no way of knowing what you're implying is true, you have to come with me.\" \"I have to?\" Drew out her hands on hips. \"Gosh, I didn't realize you had the right to tell me what to do. Oh, that's right: you don't.\" Drew began walking away, but heard a thuggish voice from behind say, \"if you want to leave, come with us.\" Drew sighed. She was more annoyed than scared, which wasn't what any ordinary person would be feeling. She turned around to see a man pointing a gun at her. A shiver of fear trickled down her spine and she began feeling nervous. Now she was scared. She nodded and followed them inside the warehouse, and people sitting at a table all turned in their chairs to look at her. \"She snooping?\" one of the nicely-dressed crooks asked. \"Nope,\" Drew said, \"wrong place, wrong time.\" She noticed a bag on the table and bullet holes. What had happened here? She craned her neck and nearly vomited at the gory sight within the bag. But she had a strong stomach when it came to violence and blood and guts. \"Smart-ass,\" one of them muttered. \"I'm pretty sure my ass isn't smart,\" Drew told him, and earned herself a few glares. \"What are we gonna do with this girl?\" the woman asked, crossing her arms over her chest. \"Turn her into the new boss?\" one of the more causually-dressed men suggested. \"I'm not some homework assignment,\" Drew said, frowning. \"I want to go home. I don't care what you think: I only know what I know, and that's that.\" \"And what do you know?\" the woman asked. \"Someone shot at you.\" The woman nodded slowly. \"We're not letting you go, though,\" she told her. Drew sighed again. \"I know, I know, you're going to kill me. If you are, just get it over with, okay?\" \"We don't need a murder pinned on us,\" the woman said. \"We're not killing you for only that reason.\" \"Good for me,\" Drew said, rolling her eyes. She wouldn't let them see how scared she was. It just didn't seem like an option. \"Now who's this?\" The whole room grew silent and Drew turned around to see someone looking down at her. She jumped back, startled. She hadn't even heard him come up behind her. \"We believe she was snooping,\" the woman said, the only one looking as if she wasn't scared. Drew remembered hearing about this guy: he looked just how the people on the streets described him. This was the Red Hood. \"Were you?\" He asked her. \"Why don't you ask your buddies?\" She said, her nervousness increasing by the second, but her fear was still buried deep. \"You got a name?\" He asked her. \"Yes, but I really don't feel like giving it to you.\" \"Cooperate,\" the dark haired woman said, glaring. \"And you'll leave this place alive and unharmed.\" Drew swallowed, hard. The Red Hood remained silent, waiting for her to speak. The twenty year old ran a hand through her black hair, seeing no way out of this. \"You going to kill me when I tell you?\" \"Depends on who you are,\" the Red Hood said. The girl took a tiny step back, showing the first signs of her fear that she had somehow managed to mask. \"Drew,\" she said, \"Drew Isley.\" The Red Hood tilted his head and remained silent for only a moment before saying, \"let her go.\" \"Sir—\" \"Let her go.\" The woman nodded and glared at Drew. She took this chance to sprint out of the building and down the street, not looking back. She didn't know why the Red Hood had decided to let her go or if she should even care. What Drew did know was that this probably wasn't the last time she was going to see him again. She was right about that. A/N: More of an intro than a chapter... oh well. Thank ye for giving this a try :)[Chapter 2] A/N: hope you like it so far! the \"then...\" and \"now...\" indicate that there will be flash backs. Right, thanks! I saw Hotel Transylvania today. OMG IT WAS SOOO CUTE! \"Check it out ima Fraken-Homie!\" XD Laughing my butt off... anyways! Now... Drew sat down as soon as the bus pulled away from the bench she'd sitting on for over half an hour. It had been almost an entire week since she'd first met the Red Hood. A lot had happened since then: the Joker had been broken out of Arkham, the Red Hood hadn't been seen since that night, and Black Mask was back in buisness after authorities had failed to link him to the Joker's escape. Drew was exhausted. She worked in a customer service department for an insurance company and had spent the entire day answering calls, trying not be a complete smart-ass, but a few had ended with angry insults. Drew leaned her head back so she was looking at the ceiling. She wanted to fall asleep right then and there, but if she fell asleep on the bus she would wake up in some part of Gotham and spend hours searching for something familiar. But she found herself dozing off anyways, and just decided to go with it. She didn't want to return to her apartment. When the bus jolted to a stop sometime later, she knew she was lost as she got off the bus and started walking again. She had no idea how long she'd had her eyes closed and didn't care. The buildings here looked expensive and Drew suddenly had a vague idea at what part in Gotham she was in: the rich part. Never had she set foot in this part of the city and never had she wanted to nor needed to. Being an orphan from one of the poorest sections, she didn't get to see a lot of fancy. Not that she minded: she was content with the experiences, the dangers, and the opportunities the less fortunate of Gotham's residents called their lives. A cold breeze managed to drag itself through her jacket, plaid button-up shirt, and tank top and settle into her skin, chilling her to the point where she cursed under her breath. It was too cold for her liking, but this was better than just sitting on the bleachers, revisiting a past she sometimes thanked herself for accepting, even if it was a painful one. Drew stopped, having the feeling that someone was watching her. She'd had it all week long, since the Red Hood had let her go. Maybe she was just worried he'd send someone after her and kill her, or maybe he'd do it himself. Drew realized that she had stopped in front of a home under construction and gazed up at it, hugging herself for warmth. Seeing that no one was working on it, she made a face at the huge structure and continued on. \"In a hurry?\" she halted, the hairs on the back of her neck standing up on end as the familiar voice she'd been hoping she'd never hear again sent chills down her spine. Slowly, Drew turned around, her heart thudding in her ears as she let her eyes rest on the Red Hood. \"To get home?\" She began feeling nervous again, and let it show this time. Being more equipped to mask other emotions, she let her mask slip just this once. \"What else would I mean?\" He seemed to be a patient man now, considering what he'd done a week ago in just one night. Drew sighed. \"Not really,\" she admitted, running a hand through her curls, wishing that she wasn't here, that she wasn't anywhere. \"Look, if this is about you thinking I'm a spy—\" \"That's not why I'm here,\" he said, stepping closer to her. She involuntarily took a step back in the opposite direction she'd been headed. She wasn't even sure if she was going anywhere at all. Glancing over her shoulder, she could see the gate that led to the unfinished mansion she'd stopped in front of earlier. \"Then why are you?\" she asked, keeping her eyes on him. He was tall, muscular, and deadly. That screamed \"don't mess with me\" and she wasn't in the mood to. \"To talk.\" \"About?\" \"This.\" He pulled a piece of square paper out of his coat pocket and handed it to her. She took it, glanced at it once, and gasped, clutching the thing to her chest. It was a photo that had gone missing ever since she'd gone back to her old high school. She'd figured she'd dropped it on her way back due to all the bouncing around she'd done to get home as fast as she could. But it wasn't just any old photo. It wasn't a photo of her mother or father or her aunt or her cousin or her grandmother or anyone like that. No, they paled in comparison in the importance department when it came to this picture. Drew glared at the Red Hood as she steadied herself, trying to make her fingers stop shaking. She got them to, but he had seen the impact of the photo. It was a picture of her and Jason when they had first become friends. She had been nine, and he had been eleven. They were standing in front of Wayne Manor. Jason's arm was around her waist, and he was ruffling her hair, smirking while she laughed, her eyes squeezed shut as she tried to get away from him. Alfred, the Wayne's butler, her taken the photo without their knowing while they had been been rough-housing outside. She remembered that he had been the once to teach her how to kick a soccer ball properly and how to dive as a goalie. Her soccer uniform, the bruises from her \"first\" life, as Jason preferred to address it as, still visible on her skin, the shadows under ger eyes, and the bony body she possessed were slowly molding into someone different. And there was Jason. You could only describe Jason as Jason, because there was no other way to. \"How did you...?\" she wondered, peaking at the photo, and her heart felt a pang as her eyes found Jason. She carried this everywhere with her; she never left home without it. It was like a piece of Jason: one of the only pieces of him that belonged to her and no one else. \"Well, I went back to that school to make sure you weren't up to anything, and found that on the ground.\" \"Thank you,\" Drew said, smiling sincerely at him for a brief moment, remembering the time when this happy photo had been taken. Then... Jason and Drew stood out back near the cemetary near the mansion. Bruce Wayne had no meetings today, so he was watching them do whatever Jason had planned for the girl. Dick, his other son, was sitting beside him, grinning from ear to ear, while Alfred had a camera ready, unbeknownst to the rest of them. It was late summer and the evening was growing cool, but they didn't seem to mind much. \"Do you know how to play soccer?\" Jason asked the bruised girl. She shrugged. \"Not really.\" \"But you like it anyways?\" This was answered by a nod. Jason grinned and took a slow step forward so he was right in front of her. Anything sudden startled her. He had a soccer ball in front of her. \"Watch me,\" he told her, and she did as he kicked it, hard. She smiled as it went sailing through the air and Dick shot out of his lawn chair and caught it. He threw it back to Jason and he caught it easily. He turned to Drew and set it down at her feet. \"You try,\" he said, and then whispered, \"hit it as hard as you can.\" Drew nodded, still smiling. She took a tiny step back and without warning her foot made contact with rubber thing, and sent it sailing over Bruce's head and it thumped against the huge oak back doors. Jason cheered. He grabbed her and ruffled her hair while she squirmed, laughed, giggled, and shouted in protest as she tried to get away from him, but his arm kept her in place. They ended up wrestling each other and trying to tackle one another while the adults had simply just sat and watched with amusement. Even Bruce had smiled. Bruce didn't smile much. At the end of the night, the two had fallen asleep on the couch in the huge living room, with Drew's head resting against his shoulder and Jason grinning in his sleep. Now... Drew's smile faded as she pressed the photo above her heart. \"How old is that photo?\" he asked her, leaning against a wall, arms folded. \"Eleven years.\" \"Why do you keep that?\" \"Because it's special.\" The Red Hood scoffed. \"It's just a piece of paper.\" Drew frowned. \"To everyone but me,\" she snapped. \"Who is that kid, anyways?\" \"Just a friend of mine.\" She wasn't about to tell him who Jason was: that would involve telling him about her life, and didn't need some... murderer to know what she'd gone through, or what she'd seen and heard, or what she'd felt during her childhood. It was a childhood no one would want to remember, but if she hadn't had the one she had, then Jason would have never found her, and she wouldn't have met Robin, either. Yes, she had met Robin. Only a few times. And he had been sweet, but not as sweet as Jason. He was dead, too, though. So she didn't want to think about him either, He was suddenly asking her questions about \"just a piece of paper\", huh? It made no sense. Drew wanted to run and hide, and not talk to this criminal, but something told her that would only piss him off. How she knew that she did not know. A lot of people who'd seen the photo hadn't really cared for its value to its owner. But that was okay. She needed more than one thing of her best friend's, and this would be the constant reminder she would carry with her of all the things he'd ever said and done to help her and make fun of her. It was also a reminder of the promise he'd broken. Drew scowled and turned on her heel to walk in the direction from whence she came, but the Red Hood grabbed her arm. Not in a mean way, but in a way that made her freeze completely. \"Is there something you want?\" she snapped, yanking her arm away from him. \"Not now,\" he told her, watching her carefully. \"But I'll be back. And that's a promise.\" Drew whipped her head around to look at him. \"Promises are only made to be broken,\" she spat. \"And why would you say that?\" \"Seriously: if you're just here to kill me, kill me! I want to get out of here!\" The Red Hood chuckled darkly. \"If I wanted you dead, you would've been dead a week ago.\" \"Then why do you keep bothering me about things that you don't even know about?\" she shouted, stamping her feet. Drew Isley didn't do sobbing and sniffling when it came to things like this, but sometimes if something was too overwhelming she would, but she usually got angry. Or really, really pissed. \"I know a lot more than you think I do,\" he said. She could feel him just looking at her calmly under that helmet of his. He stood still, just watching her. \"Oh, and what do you know?\" \"More than you think.\" Drew glared at him and turned on her heel, but didn't get in more than a few steps before she was yanked backwards and was staring up into the helmet-ed face of the Red Hood. \"Tell me one more thing, before I leave you here,\" he said, keeping his hold on her arm so she couldn't get away. \"What is it with you and promises?\" \"The one that meant the most to me was broken,\" Drew said, \"now let go of me!\" He did just that. But before he left her there, he leaned forward and said, \"I've never broken a promise, no matter what you might think.\" Perplexed, pissed off, and cold, Drew watched him leave her alone. She couldn't help wondering about the promise he'd made to whoever he'd made it to and decided not to dwell on it as she walked on, trying to find something familiar without going anywhere shady. Drew did think of one thing, though: Jason had never kept his promise. He had never come back. A/N: please review, if you like! :)[Chapter 3] A/N: thanks for everything, you all rock :) this is probably a little rushed, but alas, that happens sometimes. Drew was sitting on her bed, her legs tucked underneath her, a few things spread out on her bed. They were all connected to Jason. It was almost one in the morning, and she had just gotten home. She'd needed to think about things, sort them out. As confused as she was, she was also sad and scared. Scared because the Red Hood knew where to find her and he seemed to know more than anyone else would about her life. Sad because she'd dared to remember Jason and a happy memory: happy memories didn't make her happy, they only saddened her further because it reminded her that she would most likely never be that happy again. It was nothing to cry over: it only overwhelmed her with confusion. First, there was the photo that the Red Hood had returned to her. His actions still mystified her and she now wanted to find out what was happening. She obviously meant something to him, if he hadn't killed her yet and since he had returned the photo that had meant something to him, too. Who says its just a piece of paper after you return it to its owner after a week in his possession? It didn't make much sense; then again, life didn't make much sense, and not much else did, either. The second item was Jason's old soccer ball. All her life, even during the worst part of it, she had wanted to learn about and play soccer. Until she had been rescued and had been promised that someone nice would share their home with her, she had been allowed to do few things. She remembered spending dozens of scattered hours, when Jason, Bruce, and Dick weren't at meetings, of Dick and Jason teaching her all about soccer and other things as well. The brothers had been homeschooled, but Drew had wanted to go to a public school. They seemed to know more about the things she had learned about than her teachers did, and it was shocking to believe that Alfred tutored both of them. The third item was a batterang. Jason had told her that Robin had given it to him once and he had decided to give to her. It wasn't hard to believe that, because she had met Robin a few times herself. Quickly erasing any of those thoughts that would bring up those old memories of her speaking to the second Boy Wonder and Nightwing, she focused on the fourth and final item that was connected to Jason. This final item was simple. It was merely a necklace weaved out of red and black yarn. The ends had silver clasps. Drew didn't really know what the meaning of this was to her now, but Jason had first made it for her on the first day she had come to stay with them in the mansion. She picked it up and smiled softly at it. He had claimed to Bruce and Dick that he had bought it. But he had, in fact, made it. Alfred had told her so, and when Jason had finally admitted that he had been the maker of it when they had been alone outside, she remembered joy flowing through her and she had flung her arms around him with him laughing at her show of sudden happiness. Drew had decided with uncertainty that she would not tell the police of the Red Hood's second encounter. Telling the police about the first had seemed like a good idea at the time, but now, since she knew she interested him, it might present to him an opportunity to kill her. When she had come into the station to see the Commissioner himself about the matter, everyone who didn't know what had happened knew there was something wrong. Drew had often come into the same station before she had been sent to live with Jason, because of her horrific family. As soon as she had said, \"the Red Hood\" Gordon had wanted her apartment watched at all times, but when she explained to to him what had transpired that night, he had told her that he might ask the Batman himself about it. Not wanting any publicity from this, she had declined this offer, but he had assured her that there would be no press or any way for the Red Hood to find out that she had talked to the authorities. Drew sighed and swung her legs off her bed, letting her bare feet touch the floor. She had changed into black sweatpants and a navy blue plaid shirt that was unbuttoned, showing her thin grey tank top underneath. The shirt sleeves were rolled up to her elbows. Her hair was down and messy, the curls falling over her eyes, tumbling over her shoulders and down her back. She got up and went to the window, pressing her nose against the glass. As tired as she was, she knew she wasn't going to find any sleep. The Red Hood was still lurking about in her head, and thoughts of Jason were haunting her. She had managed to shove back the twisted memories from her early childhood, when she had still lived with her biological family. Before Robin had found her. Leaning her head against the glass and shutting her eyes, she used all her willpower, and at this hour there was little of it, to block out memories of her mother, her father, her, aunt, cousin and grandmother. Images of her mother screaming, her father with his fist raised, her grandmother glaring, and her cousin crying filled her head and she slammed her head against the glass, and the sudden pain forced the memories away, into that tight little corner in her mind where they would wait for just the right moment to spring up and run rabid through her head. Not wanting to think about it, she went over to her closet and shoved on her favorite black boots, not bothering to put on socks, and didn't even grab a coat as she ran out the door, locking it behind it quickly before she took to the stairs of her mediocre apartment building. It was sort of shabby, but it was a home she could tolerate. She went down six more floors before finding herself running breathlessly down the street, passing few people, mostly thuggish-looking men and women who could have been hookers for all she knew. She ignored the concerned stares and the aggravated glares as she whizzed by, her mind emptying itself of all thoughts, with only one destination in mind: Wayne Manor. She didn't know why, but she wanted to go see Jason's grave. She never believed in paying her respects by standing over his dead body and sobbing about nothing. She'd down that at his funeral and hadn't felt better at all. In fact, being anywhere near the mansion killed her inside with each step as she drew closer and closer to the place where her friend was laid to rest. Crying never solved anything, and that wasn't why she was climbing stealthily over the iron fence and stealing into the graveyard to find his stone, standing a few feet away from it. She was only here to think about everything. Shivering as snow began to fall, rubbing her arms and letting her teeth chatter, Drew stared down at the patch of dirt surrounding his grave. How odd. By now it would be choked with weeds and bushes and such, but no: the ground here looked as if it had been dug up, and recently, too. Wondering what could have happened in order for someone to disturb the grave, and if someone so happened to disturb the grave, the twenty year old sank to her knees slowly and began picking away large chunks of dampened - but - not - quite - muddy dirt. She began clawing away at it, desperate for something to fill her head, yet desperate for nothing as well. She felt as if she was being watched, and looked around, her eyes narrowed. The snow clung to her body and soaked her clothes as she paused, her hair now plastered to her skin. She was being watched. But by who? Drew shook her head, not caring, and resumed digging with only her hands to aid her. By the time she was scraping away at the wooden coffin, her hands were bloody from the labor their owner had just put them through. She pried the coffin lid open and gasped. It was empty. Jason wasn't here. Her mouth hung open for a moment as her mind struggled to come up with an explanation for this. But there was none. Anger began boiling inside her chest, and she climbed out of the hole she'd made, storming towards the huge oak doors. She began pounding on them, shouting, but when no answer came, she located a rock by the door and hurled it through the nearest window. She climbed in, not completely aware of what she was doing, and she didn't care at all. She made her way through the house, knowing she was tracking mud and water everywhere as she heard voices from somewhere below her. She pressed herself up against a wall next to a grandfather clock as the voices drew closer. She was hidden by a book shelf and prayed no one would find her. \"...so why do you think he's been talking to her?\" it was Dick talking. \"I think he's going to tell her that it's him,\" came Bruce's reply. What on earth were they talking about? \"Do you think he's going to kill her?\" to her astonishment, the grandfather clock swung towards her, and two men exited, letting the thing swing back into place. Well, that was weird. Her eyes nearly popped out of her skull when she saw what they were wearing. Batman? Bruce is... Batman? Nightwing. Dick... is... Drew really just wanted to scream \"HOLY HELL\" and demand answers, but she kept silent as they walked away from here. \"What's this mess?\" she heard Dick ask. \"Probably just some kids. Hey... what's in the graveyard?\" she heard the front doors being unlocked and opened, and they shut again. She took this chance to try to pry her way into the clock, but got nowhere. Her bloody hands would be a dead giveaway as to who had snuck onto Bruce's property, but she needed to find out what was going on. Sh finally opened the case and pulled the swinging thing and it opened. She shut it behind her and found herself going down a dark stairway. She stumbled into a large room that was pretty much a cave. Full of Batman stuff. Drew nearly fell over when she saw the Batmobile and the computers and everything else, but what caught her attention was the Robin suit encased in glass in the corner. She ran over to it, her bloody hands leaving smears on the glass as she began piecing everything together. Dick was Nightwing, who had been the first Robin. Bruce was Batman... that explained the meetings. Those meetings he'd never explained to her. And Jason? Drew began pounding her fists against the glass. \"No, no, no, no, no!\" she shouted, slamming her fist one last time into the glass so hard it cracked, piercing her already bleeding hand. She stepped away, refusing to cry as she wiped the blood on her hands onto her sweatpants. She was soaking wet, she was bloody, and she was filthy. She looked horrible, even worse than she had looked when she had been whisked away from her home with her horrid family. She went over to the computer and stared up at the screen. There was the Red Hood. She tilted her head to the side, examining it. She looked back at the bloodied glass and let her shoulders droop. Jason Todd had been Robin. She remembered hearing about his death on the television soon after Jason had been supposedly buried. Apparently, the second Robin had been kidnapped by the Joker had been beaten to death and then blown up as an afterthought by the madman. This was almost too much for her. Almost. Drew could hear Dick and Bruce... Nightwing and Batman... yelling, and she took this as her cue to get out of this cave. She ran in a random direction and found herself going down a long hall and up a flight of stairs. She found a door and shoved it open, surprised to find herself out in the graveyard. She took off, vaulted the fence with ease, hoping that they hadn't seen her leave. When she was finally in the middle of Gotham, she stopped on the corner of a street, falling to her knees. No one else was around to hear the angry cries that she let loose as she looked at her bloody hands. Jason had been beaten to death by the Joker. He had suffered... a lot... Bruce was Batman... Nightwing was Dick... she crawled over to an alleyway and curled up into a ball, her hands stinging, her body shivering violently as more snow fell. It was just so cold... her boots were filled with mud and rocks, her pants were stained with mud, and her tank and shirt were bloody. Her pale skin was streaked with all these things, and her hair was also matted with blood. She stood up after a few moments, stumbling home, needing a hot shower. She ignored the occasionally shout and look as she neared her home. Drew needed time to think about all of this, and then she would go looking for the answers to her questions. The most important question she had that needed answering concerned Jason. Where was his body? A/N: thanks again for reviewing, reading, following, and all that jazz :D plze leave a thought or two! :)[Chapter 4] A/N: thank ye for reading! Bruce and Dick stared in shock at the blood, water, and dirt that were in puddles on the floor of the Batcave. The hand prints on the glass were smeared, it was apparent that whoever had dug up the grave had done so with bare hands and had discovered the Cave. \"This isn't good,\" Dick said after a few long seconds of silence. \"Want me to check the security tapes?\" \"We already know who it is,\" Bruce muttered, stepping forward to examine the bloody smears further. \"Do you think she knows that her best friend as been around for the past few years?\" He wondered. \"I mean, she must have dug up the body with her bare hands... And I'm guessing that if we tested this blood, it would be Drew's.\" \"I don't think so,\" the Caped Crusader replied. \"If she found out that Jason is alive she most likely had a different reaction.\" \"She would still be here, hacking your computer,\" Dick sighed and ran a hand through his dark hair. \"Jason was right: as soon as she came to live with us we should have just told her the truth.\" Bruce said nothing. Of course Jason had been right all those years ago. Well, back then they thought he hadn't been, but now it seemed like it could have spared Drew the pain she would experience once she found out that Jason was alive and living as the Red Hood. She could very well kill someone when she found out: angry was how she dealt with things. \"We need to go talk to him,\" Dick said suddenly. \"Why would he bother?\" Bruce shook his head. \"Gordon told me about her, last week. Told me that he let her go.\" \"So... He still likes her, then? Well, at least he hasn't killed her, right?\" \"We won't know anything for sure until she knows about Jason.\" \"She's going to try to kill us, you know,\" Dick said, glancing up at the picture of his brother on the screen. \"Or she'll jus kill Jason.\" \"She couldn't kill Jason,\" Bruce said, glaring at the mess in the floor the girl had made. \"Even before she had the slightest chance he'd drop a hint and she wouldn't be able to defend herself if it really is his wish to kill her. Which it isn't.\" \"Do you think he saw her again recently? What do you think motivated her to come to his grave? Even he knows that she'd never go there unless... Someone brought him up.\" Turning to Bruce, he said, \"he must be trying to get her to guess who he is. Since she saw that there was never a real body, she's going to get suspicious of his actions.\" He went over to the computer and brought up the feed from the security cameras. After a few more seconds of typing, he let the video play. Drew was digging, but when she looked up, he paused the video. The look on her fact told the two men that something was very, very wrong. Dick switched to a setting which allowed him to see in infrared. His expression turned grim when he saw the heat signature hidden in the bushes, and turned it back to its normal setting as he brightened the image and zoomed in on it. Dick sighed. \"Is it just me, or does Jason looked pissed in this snapshot?\" Bruce narrowed his eyes and frowned. The Red Hood had his fists clenched, his body was tense, and he really looked as if he wanted to kill someone. Or beat them half to death. \"How about we ask him what's bothering him?\" Dick suggested. \"We already have an idea.\" \"We do?\" The man who had once been Robin thought a moment. \"It's what Drew doesn't know about him,\" Bruce sighed, sitting down in his chair. \"He does and doesn't want her to know he's alive. He does because he knows that she still and will probably always see him as her best friend, and he doesn't because of what he is now. Despite everything, her opinion of him seems to be the only one that matters.\" \"Knowing him, she's bound to find out soon,\" Dick mused. \"I mean, if she were my best friend, and if I were in Jason's shoes, and thank god I'm not, I would eventually get mad at the fact that my best friend didn't even know I was alive. And since we all knew, except Drew, that he liked her. A lot. Probably still does, so, if Drew just so happens to go on a rampage in the next week or so, we'll know why.\" Bruce shook his head. That could only be expected of Drew. \"So...we just wait and see what happens?\" he shook his head. \"as long as Jason understands that she just might shoot him, I'm fine with her knowing. She already knows who we are and who Jason was.\" The two men fell into silence. They could only imagine what would happen when Drew found out. A/N: let me know what you think! Filler chapter I thinks, but meh.[Chapter 5] A/N: hiya! hope you guys didnt mind the last chapter. I'm still working on \"creation or destruction\" ive been thinking about things plot wise, and i havent been coming up with any good ideas. Not to worry! should be updated soon(ish?). Drew had taken the hottest shower in the history of showering once she had returned home, bloody, furious, and muddy. She had thrown all of her articles of clothing into a corner in her bathroom and had sat down in the shower, running her hands through her hair repeatedly before shutting it off before it could grow cold. She stepped out of the shower, shivering already. Her hands needed tending to, but she couldn't think about them. All she had done was prevent herself from clobbering someone. She padded to her room, grabbed some clothes, and went back to the bathroom to change. She had on short-shorts that she usually reserved for the warmer months, but tonight her head was spinning with memories, so she couldn't focus on much. She put on a grey tank top and a plaid button-up shirt, rolled up the sleeves, and left it open. She went back over to her bed and frowned to see her window open. Funny. She hadn't closed it. With her mind somewhere else, she closed it and was about to crawl into bed when someone cleared his throat right behind her. Drew opened her mouth to scream, but a gloved hand clamped over her mouth and she heard a chuckle. Her mood darkened. This was the last person she needed. Especially after finding out that the Joker had killed Jason, and Jason had been Robin all along. The Red Hood released her, and she spun around, glaring. \"Get out!\" she yelled angrily. \" Now !\" \"I will when I feel like it,\" he told her, leaning against the wall next to her bed. She frowned, pushing her fingers through her wet hair. She winced, remembering what she'd done to them, and felt her blood boil again. Suddenly, the Red hood was in front of her, inspecting her hands. She struggled to get away from him, but he refused to let go. He just tightened his grip on her wrists, and she eventually stayed still, much to her aggravation. \"What the hell did you do to your hands?\" this was hardly a question. \"None of your buisness,\" she said numble, refusing to look at him. Instead, her eyes focused on the ground. \"Oh, really? Stay still.\" He went into the kitchen and came back only moments later with bandages in hand. He began wrapping them around her damaged fingers, slowly, methodically, as if he'd done this many, many times. \"You're an idiot.\" She blinked. \"Excuse me?\" \"I said , you're an idiot .\" \"I'm sorry, but I don't believe you were the one who just dug up a grave with their bare hands!\" she snapped as he began working on her left hand. He visibly tensed. \" What ?\" his voice was low, deadly. Drew refused to show him how nervous she was right now. It just wasn't in her to let him know that she was cowering as he worked to heal her hands. And why would he even care? He didn't seem to care about anyone else. She sighed, glaring. \"I... I dug up a grave with my bare hands.\" Her voice shook. Realizing just now what she had done, she had to hold back waves of emotions as the Red Hood finished with her hands. She examined them, thinking distantly that they resembled a mummy's, except she could move her fingers. Jason used to bandage her arms like this. He had told her that it was a game: she would be Cleopatra and come back from the dead and try to tag him, the evil tomb robber. She had never really won a fair game, except once, when Jason had tripped down the stairs and she had tackled him, claiming victory. That had been during her second week with the Wayne family. Shoving those memories away, she took a deep breath, she tried to clear the rest of her head as she said, \"you made me think of him. So I went to his grave. I never do that. Never.\" \"Why don't you?\" he asked, sounding...odd. What was that in his voice? She couldn't place it. \"Because the last time I did I cried a god damned river,\" she snapped. \"And he hated it when I cried! Know why? Because once I start crying, you can't get me to stop!\" she stormed over to the window, pushed it back open, and jabbed her finger in its direction. \"Now get out! I've already told you enough as it is!\" The Red Hood just crossed his arms over his chest, leaning forward, as if inspecting her. \"You... wait...\" he tilted his head, straightening up. \"What did you find?\" he asked suddenly. \"Nothing,\" she admitted. \"Nothing!\" she stomped away from him, replacing her pain with a white-hot fury. \"I really think you should tell me...\" \"Fine!\" she threw up her hands, thinking, what the hell? What was the use of burying a secret like that? Jason was dead . \"You know what? To hell with all of it! All of it!\" Facing him, fists shaking, eyes ablaze, she said through gritted teeth, \"I just dug up my best friend! And do you know what I found?\" \"Tell me.\" \"NOTHING!\" she shouted, slamming her fist into the wall so hard it left a dent. Her knuckles were now bleeding through the bandages, and she heard the Red Hood sigh heavily. Really? He just sighed? \"There was no body,\" she shouted, refusing to let any tears fall any time soon. He stiffened at this. \"There was nothing! And do you know what I found out? I found out that my best friend was Robin. ROBIN! \" She slammed her fist into the wall again, and a faint crack reached her ears. Her hand throbbed as she dropped onto her bed, glaring straight ahead, not looking at the Red Hood. \"Can you belive that?\" she asked softly as he moved slowly to sit next to her. She tensed, but slowly relaxed. She knew he wasn't about to kill her, or hurt her. But something was making him uneasy, and it couldn't because of what she had just revealed... could it? \"I can, actually,\" he muttered. \"He wasn't blown up... like I was told,\" she said, still guarding his identity. Jason still deserved that. \"He was beaten to death by the goddamn Joker! No... he suffered. Beaten, broken...\" she hiccupped and leaped up, worried she might throw up just talking about it, but the Red Hood yanked her back down in her place, holding her by her shoulders so she stayed planted tot he bed. \"Would you just hold still?\" he asked, sounding exhausted. \"Look, I... he hurt me, too. A long time ago. But... just...\" he sighed, now in frustration. \"Don't do anything stupid, Drew. Got it? That means no going to beat him to death like he did... Robin... okay? And you're going to stay here and let those hands of yours heal. Are we clear?\" \"Who died and made you my mother?\" she spat. He chuckled grimly. \"Well, I may not be that, but give me your word that you won't leave this room for the rest of the night.\" \"I. Don't. Make. Promises.\" \"Dammit, Drew, just don't go anywhere, okay?\" He stood up and walked towards the window. \"You should get this locked,\" he said, \"someone might come in when you least expect it.\" She glared. Before he left her alone, though, he said, \"you know, I didn't notice it before, but you grew up nicely.\" As soon as she was alone, she buried her burning face into her pillows, beating her fists against her mattress. Had he seriously just said that to her? Drew stood up, pulling on sweat pants and rain boots. She wasn't going to stay here, in her room. She was going to see the man responsible for her best friend's death, and she was willing to walk there. Without a second though, she headed out the door, pulling on a thick coat as she went. Time for the madman to get a visitor. A/N: thanks for reading, please leave a thought or two![Chapter 6] A/N: HOLA PEOPLE! :D I am on a MISSION to update everything as much as i can this weekend! if i dont update something i am terrible sorry but yeah! So. I am gonna update Marta Had A Secret, Something More Deadly, Unwillingly An Angel, When Life Is Wrong, The Missing Piece, Learn to Expect the Unexpected, Ash, and of course, this! did i forget to mention any others? hmm i dont think so. oh well. Too much... It's like homework. WHICH I FINISHED! Civics, Tech, Muzic, ALL OF IT! So. if i dont update any of these this weekend i apologize in advance because of course my brain is probably more wacky than anyone else's within a five mile radius of me! hahahahahahahahahahahaha well im not TOO sure about that, but on with the story! Drew sat across from the Joker, who had been staring at her for the past ten minutes, saying nothing. The man's hair was greasy and his makeup was smudged, but otherwise he looked to be alright, despite the injuries he had been given last week. Numbly, she stared right back. So this had been the very man who had killed Jason. And he had apparently hurt the Red Hood. Knowing he wouldn't have lied about something like that, she had realized that all she had wanted to do was to see his face and know for certain that he had been the cause of her best friend's, and Robin's, death. \"So, I don't think I've met you before,\" the Joker drawled, frowning at her. The malicious glint in his eyes made her want to strangle him, beat him, and break him in every way he had broken Jason. But all she did was stay numbed to the bone, all her feeling frozen within her. Later, they would thaw, and she would be out for blood. Either that, or she would burn something down. \"You haven't,\" she mumbled, refusing to look away from him. \"So, why ya here? Did I kill someone you love? Or maybe a family member?\" he hooted with laughter. \"Oh, yes, it's probably a sister or a brother! Tell me, how did they die?\" Drew tightened her hands into able fists, but she knew better than to try anything when the clown across from her was still alive, even if he was in a straight jacket. He could still snap her neck without thinking twice about it. In fact, she was certain that he didn't have to think at all when he killed someone, unless he was thinking of ways to make them suffer. \"You took someone away from me,\" she said, gritting her teeth. \"Family or love?\" he cackled, for no apparent reason. Madman, indeed. Drew knew she shouldn't be here. Someone would come as soon as they found her apartment. It didn't matter who it was: the Red Hood, Bruce, or Dick. Whoever would find her gone would know exactly where to look for her. But she had to be, as stupid and helpless as she felt. She had to be. \"He was my best friend.\" \"Not admitting to either?\" He scratched his head, and a smirk formed on his painted fast. Her stomach twisted at the sight of him. How badly she wanted to beat him to hell, drag him back, burn him alive, and toss him back she couldn't express to anyone in words. \"Who was he, hmmm?\" \"Robin.\" The Joker sat up, his eyes widening and narrowing in interest. He should be dead. He should have died a long, long time ago. But here he was, right in front of her. \"Oh? Are you sure you're not a fan?\" he tilted his head, leaning forward to get a better look at her. \"No,\" she said coldly, glaring. \"He's dead because of you.\" A look of... something passed over the Joker's face before he burst into malicious, maniacal laughter. \"What's so funny?\" Drew asked, unable to contain herself. The Joker calmed down eventually, smirking at her. \"Of all the people who don't know, you don't!\" he cackled again. \"So Bird Boy kept you in the dark?\" \"What the hell are you even talking about?\" Drew spat, standing up to leave. \"Jason, of course!\" she froze. \"That is his name, isn't it ?\" \" How do you—\" \"Lady, I know a lot more than you do right now!\" he chuckled, and then turned half-serious for once in his insane life. \"Have you been visited lately by any masked men?\" \"No,\" the lie popped out of her mouth easily. \"LIAR!\" he shouted, shaking his head in amusement. \"Hoodie's found you, hasn't he ?\" When he got no reply, he met her eyes, and his sent a chill down her spine. \"Hoodie, or is it Red?—paid you a visit or two, hmmm?\" he shook his head again. \"Tsk, tsk, tsk. And you would have thought he'd had told you by now! But no!\" he laughed again. Drew made another move to leave, but the Joker's stare stopped her midstep. \"No wonder he never mentioned you! I can kill you now!\" \"What do I care?\" she spat. \"My best friend is gone, my family is basically a living hell, and I really don't give a damn about what madness is coming out of your mouth right now! If you'll excuse me, I'm going to go and piss someone off.\" She walked over to the door, but as her hand rested on the handle, the Joker said, \"you know who Hoodie , is riiiiight ?\" Slowly, Drew turned around and looked at him, her eyes narrowed in suspicion and hatred. \"Why would anyone know?\" \"Oh, I know, Batsy knows, Bird Boy the First knows... everyone except you! Oh, how wonderful! I'm the one who gets to spoil the surprise!\" he cackled again. Drew felt queasy, but shoved that feeling aside. What was he getting at? He turned his seat around by hopping several times so he was looking up at the twenty-year-old. \"What happened to your hands?\" he asked with interest, noticing her mummified hands. \"I dug up a grave,\" she said, her voice rising slightly, a rage burning deep inside her. She was definitely going to burn something down tonight. \"OH?\" he laughed again. \"Was it your dear old Jason's? And did you find the fake body, or did they get rid of it by now?\" Drew blinked in surprise. Fake body? What ? \"Oh! So you didn't find it!\" he shook his head, frowning in mock disappointment. \" Pity .\" He cackled again. \"Tell me what's going on or I'm leaving,\" Drew hissed. \"Okay, okay ,\" he rolled his eyes. \"Impatient, are we?\" \"Just tell me!\" He sighed dramatically. \"Your Bird Brain isn't dead .\" Drew glared at him, raised her fist, and slammed it into his face. He spit blood out of his mouth; she had split his lip. Her hand throbbed from the impact, but it felt good to get her anger out, to take it out on the monster that was the reason Jason Todd was dead. \"That's not funny ,\" she shouted. It was a load of crap. Jason was dead. Robin was dead. \"Why would I joke about that?\" he giggled when a look of pain crossed her face. \"As much fun as it'd be to tell you that and lie, I'm not.\" He hiccupped, and giggled again. \"Because you're sick,\" she spat out venomously. \"You took him away! The dead don't come back! Or maybe you're too crazy to know that? The dead stay dead, and the dead stay gone .\" \"See, lady, that's where you're wro-ong, \" the Joker drawled, clucking his tongue, smirking up at her. \"You're murdering, loving Hoodie is your Bird Brian!\" he cackled. \"LIES!\" she punched him again, and the satisfying crunch of cartilage soothed her anger as blood ran in a river from the madman's nose. He only laughed. Did he enjoy pain, or did he enjoy causing it more? \"Oh, I wish I was, I wish,\" he cackled, \"you know, you're a bit like him. You'd rather hit me than talk!\" \"He's gone,\" Drew said, refusing to believe this crap. It wasn't real. If she had even thought it could be, it would have been wishful thinking. It was something so unlikely that it was just impossible. \"Listen here,\" he said, sitting up, spitting blood onto the floor, \"Hoodie...Jason...Bird Brain... whatever you wanna kill him? He's not dead. Why would he stay dead?\" he hooted with maniacal, sickening laughter. \"So did ya see the empty grave? Did ya see a body? If he's dead, where's the body, then, hmmm?\" Drew opened her mouth and raised her fist to strike him again, but his words stopped her. He actually had a point... No. It had to be the clown's doing. \"I know what you're thinking,\" the Joker said quickly, \"I do! And you think it's impossible! You know what he told me, before I blew him up five years ago?\" Drew shook her head, her arms falling to her sides, feeling weak. She couldn't bring herself to believe him. What he was saying couldn't be true, it just couldn't. It was unacceptable. Stupid. Naïve. \"He told me there was this friend he knew, a girl. Pretty, too! He liked her a lot, told me that she was the best. Described her, too. Told me that if there was one thing he could do, he would come back from the dead and see her again! And you know what I did? I laughed and started beating him with a crowbar!\" Drew couldn't take it. Too many emotions were confusing her. She left, her mouth open as she stumbled out of Arkham and barely even noticed when she found herself in Gotham. Jason. Alive? The Red Hood? Was this true? Drew couldn't think: she had to find something to do, something to vent. She located a baseball just laying on the ground in the alley, retrieved it, and walked down the street, her mind set on hurting someone or something. She didn't feel as if she were in control of herself. Jason couldn't be alive. He couldn't be the Red Hood. He couldn't have been resurrected. It was impossible to believe... but there was a part of her that knew. Knew he was alive. Knew he was who the Joker said he was. But she wasn't ready to face him or anything else: all she needed to do was hit something with her baseball bat, and she intended to before the night was over. A/N: please review! :)[Chapter 7] A/N: HIIII! I would love to thank everyone who has found this story and FOLLOWED and stuff. and reviewed! You all have made me want to update again (i've been busy with life... well, mostly homework, but life too.) So. I hope you like this chapter. Drew stomped down the street, rage nearly blinding her as she located someone familiar, someone she remembered from a week ago, and locked onto that person. As she crossed the street carelessly, though, she saw a can of gasoline just sitting in an abandoned pickup truck in an alley and wicked thoughts began their dance inside her head. Dropping the bat in the middle of the mostly empty street and forgetting the woman who had threatened her, and luckily had not seen her, she went over to the truck and picked it up, and when she found a matchbook, her rage skyrocketed. Heading off with these two things as snow fell around her, she felt like she was cut off from reality, like she was somehow outside it and that she had lost connection with it. It was due to the shock of finding out her best friend was alive, she knew, and therefore, she needed someway to... well, whatever she could do to get the rage out of her system instead of curling up on her bed and crying about it all night. Seeing an old, abandoned building that didn't look very appealing, and upon seeing the CONDEMNED sign she figured no one would miss it. She began dumping the gasoline all over the front of it that showed in the dark alley way, until the can was empty. Flinging into one of the windows, hearing glass shattering, she struck up a match before she could second guess what she was doing or worry about the consequences and flicked it towards the building. Immediately, the building caught on fire. It spread so fast she knew she had to get out of there, fast. She took off in the direction opposite in which she came from, and disappeared from the area long before she could hear sirens in the distance. By time time her head cleared, she was lost once again, cold, and lonely. And she desperately wanted to cry, more than she really cared to admit. Slowly, she began to recognize where she was as she trudged on. And she'd managed to land herself in the rich part of Gotham. Again. Having an idea, she began running again, despite her body's protests and found the gates to the unfinished mansion she'd seen time first time she'd seen the Red Hood that night. Jumping the fence easily, she ran across the snow-covered lawn and leapt over a pile of sheets of plastic, dodging tarps flapping about in the freezing wind. The house was huge, piles of supplies were scattered about as she turned corners, went up stairs and down hallways. When Drew finally found herself again, she was in a large room with glassless windows and snow filtered in through the cracks in the unfinished house. She went over to a far corner, out of the way of the snow and wind and most of the cold. Leaning into the corner and sliding down onto the hardwood floor, pulling her knees to her chest. Drew idly wondered if what she had done was the wisest choice, but then she felt something wet on her cheek. Shocked, she put a ban to her cheek and gasped when she found that she had been crying long before she had found this huge, empty room. The sounds of the city seemed distant on this huge house, it reminded her of the time when she had lived with the Wayne's. With Jason. And with this final thought, she broke down and cried. No more rage filled her system: only sorrow and shock and disbelief choked her as she sobbed loudly in the empty house. Her cries, though, could be heard, even though she had been certain no one had seen her since she had gone to Arkham. The thoughts of Jason being alive tormented her as she rocked herself back and forth, pressing her face into her legs, trying to muffle her sobs. After the longest of times, she stood shakily, sniffing, wiping her eyes hurriedly to erase any signs of crying. No one needed to know that she had spent a good amount of time crying over something that she could do nothing about. Who needed to know, anyways? Drew slowly went to the open space that would eventually be a huge window and peered around the flapping tarp and was greeted by a sharp blast of cold air. \"I don't understand!\" She wailed, waving her bandaged hands around in frustration. Slamming her hands into the wall. She leaned out the window, her black hair rustled by the wind. Out of nowhere someone grabbed the necklace she'd forgotten she had put on and yanked her backwards, back into the house and against another body. An arm wrapped itself around her waist quickly as a gloved hand clamped over her mouth as a scream of pure, sorrow-filled scream escaped her lips. As soon as she was done screaming and thrashing about, she calmed down, but her heart was out of the control, as if it was trying to tear itself out of her chest in a wild emotional frenzy. She knew who was keeping her from running out of the house and doing something that would get her into trouble. She'd already set something on fire: what else could she possibly do that was worse than that? \"Jason!\" She said into the gloved hand. \"Let me go!\" \"You know,\" he murmured, his hand slowly leaving her mouth and examining the necklace he'd given her. \"I can't believe you bothered keeping the damn thing.\" \"It really is you!\" She shouted, spinning around and facing the Red Hood. Jason. \"Take that off,\" she hissed, pointing at his helmet. \"Or what?\" He leaned forward, poking her hard with his finger, and she stumbled back in response. \"You gonna set something else on fire?\" \"God dammit, Jason Peter Todd, you will take that mask off or there will be hell to pay before this night is over!\" He sighed. \"You know you've been here for two hours, right?\" \"I... How long have you been here?\" she asked him, glaring. She was losing her calm appearance, if one could even call it that. She wanted to cry again, this was too much for her to take in. \"How long have you known? And why aren't you having a breakdown?\" He crossed his arms over his chest, giving her no sign that he would take off his helmet, which kept her from believing this whole thing completely. But she needed to see his face, she needed to confirm the Joker's words. When all he received was silence, he glared at her. She felt it, and a blank look crossed her face before she looked down at her feet, realizing something. Jason's promise. A promise never broken . She looked and was about to let out a shriek as an unfamiliar yet familiar man covered her mouth. Black hair. Brilliant green eyes. A trademark, exhausted smirk. Drew, in shock, felt her legs give out and of course this man was familiar to her. This was the boy that had died long ago, that had left her alone in the world. But here was. The thunk of his helmet was distant in her mind as she stared, gaping, into his eyes. \"He was right ,\" she whispered, steadying herself as he let go of her. \"Jason...\" The smirk vanished as shock overwhelmed her again. \" Who told you?\" a dark look crossed his features. \"You never broke it,\" she said, her eyes shimmering. \"You've kept it all this time.\" Jason sighed, shaking his head. He wasn't going to get anywhere with her while she was in this state. \"Let's get you back to your place,\" he said, putting on his helmet, taking her arm gently. After burning down a condemned building, digging up a grave, disappearing for an hour, and learning that her best friend had been Robin, and was alive, she was a mess. But the possibility of her getting angry or running off once she regained her normal state of mind was huge. Jason tugged her towards the stairs, shaking his head. \"You know, you haven't cried in a long time,\" he told her. \"You've changed,\" she said absently as he led her down the stairs slowly. \"It's been five years,\" he chuckled. \"You're older,\" she stumbled forward, and he grabbed her arm to steady her. He only rolled his eyes as they exited the mansion. Little did he know that Drew was trying to decide whether or not that this whole situation was a good thing or a bad thing, and if having Jason Todd— the Red Hood —alive was really something to be happy about. Thanks for reading! please leave opinions/thoughts, are always welcomed! thanks again for reading and reviewing![Chapter 8] Hey there! Been a while, right? Yeah... so here I am! Sorry about that... Drew sat on her bed, her knees tucked into her chest, in a new set of clothes. The helmet was tucked between her legs and stomach, her arms wrapped around it. It was cold and a strange thing to keep close to her, but it was real - it was the only thing that made sense. The young man in front of her, however - who was leaning back comfortably, only two chair legs on the floor - wasn't so believable. Even though he was in front of her. \"I told you to stay here.\" She grimaced. She knew that already. \"Should've made you keep your word,\" he griped. Drew didn't know what to say to this. She barely knew what to say to him. What could anyone say to a dead man walking? His expression was somewhat sour now. \"Burning down buildings shouldn't be a way to deal - and last I checked the girl dressed up as Cleopatra wasn't a pyromaniac. In fact, I'd like to know why you decided to do what you did. And who told you about me?\" She shrugged. A slurred response came out of her mouth, incoherent. His eyes narrowed. \"The Joker.\" The chair fell to the floor with a clatter, and before she could blink, he was gripping the collar of her shirt, lifting her off the bed. He was beyond furious now. Was it because his best friend had gone and talked to the monster that had been the death of him? Or was it because she'd went against him and gone off - to Arkham, no less? To one of the few places that on a regular day - had there ever been such a thing for her? - that he knew she'd never willingly step foot in? \"You...did... what ?\" \"I went and saw him,\" she hissed, \"You know how he put it? 'Your Hoodie is your Bird Brain'!\" He was practically seething with rage. So, maybe that hadn't been the best idea, but how else would she have found out? \"Drew.\" His voice caught her attention - took her out of her thoughts - and she felt very, very small as his eyes locked onto hers. \"Are you insane?\" his voice was low, quiet. \"You - he could have killed you and no one would have found the body till morning.\" \"I -\" His voice was growing in volume. \"You've ruined your hands by digging up my grave , you know who I am - you know I'm Robin - but... you had to go and see him .\" He was shouting now. Rarely had she ever heard him shout - at her, no less - and he wasn't often angry. But he was raging. And it was terrifying her. He gave her a good shake, as if to get it through her skull. Which it did. \"Why did you do that, Drew?\" he shook her again. She winced. His voice could probably be heard by her neighbors. And they'd called the cops before when she'd gotten into yelling matches with total strangers at the doors. Nice neighbors, but still. \" Why? \" His voice dropped somewhat, and his expression softened just a bit. Drew didn't have an answer. She felt on the verge of tears. Yelling served as a reminder of the childhood this man had gotten her out of. Which was the reason why she tried to avoid getting into situations that caused people to yell. He dropped her ungracefully back onto the bed. It squeaked in return as she bounced. He turned away and ran a gloved hand through his hair, then slowly turned again to face her. He looked exhausted. Drew had latched onto the helmet again, watching him with wide eyes, her mouth clamped shut as to not say anything stupid that would anger him further. He opened his mouth to speak but he didn't get the chance to. The telephone began to ring, making Drew's head whip towards the front door. \"You going to get that?\" Jason asked her, arms crossed over his chest as he raised an eyebrow. Drew scrambled to her feet and dashed over to the phone - Jason's eyes followed the helmet she kept tucked into her chest - and picked it up. \"H-h-hello?\" \"Drew Isely\"? \"Yes?\" she cleared her throat, tucking the Red Hood's trademark piece of attire under her arm. \" This is Bruce Wayne.\" Drew's eyes widened as the phone fell from her grasp and with a clatter fell to the floor. Oh no. Without realizing it, she also dropped the helmet. Her mind spun as she stumbled over to her closet. She hadn't thought of this. She hadn't thought of what would happen after - after - She shuddered. She'd left blood and mud everywhere in the Batcave. What could she possibly say to him after her... her... \"Drew,\" there was a warning in his voice as she felt his finger wrap around her wrist and yank her away from the boots she'd been getting closer to. \"Who's on the line?\" \"No one!\" the lie slipped out quickly as she struggled to get away. What if Bruce - or worse, Dick? - came looking for her, asking what had gotten into her? What would she do? What could she say? She was dressed in loose pants and a t-shirt, but God, she needed to go away before she was confronted with any more of her decisions. \"Drew,\" he tried again, but she yanked her hand away and put on another coat. How many had she gone through tonight? Two? She shook her head, sticking her feet into the boots, making a dash for the front door. Jason caught her arm again and swung her around to face him. \"You can't go out there, you need sleep - dawn's almost here.\" Her head was beginning to hurt, and she yanked her arm away from him again, shaking her head. Turning from him again, she went to the door, yanked it open, and dashed out. Out and down the stairs, around the corners, past the people - until she was out in front again. Looking up, she saw Jason climbing out of her window. His helmet was back on, and his head turned downwards to look at her. Drew started running in the opposite direction, hoping he wouldn't follow. But this time, he did. Thanks for reading! Please review if you have the time :D[Chapter 9] I've reread this fic and decided to update it now rather than later (I'm having a lot of trouble updating lately). Please review :) You all have been so wonderful with reviews and follows and favorites! Thankyouthankyouthankyouthan kyouTHANKYOU! Drew knew she wasn't going to lose him any time soon. It was really quite troublesome, ducking through alleys and turning corners, with him leaping about above her, as if this were a game to him. But she knew it wasn't. She had run off, twice now, but she'd had enough - this was getting to be too much. Or maybe it already was, for her. \"Drew!\" She whirled around and nearly lost her footing at the sight of Jason - the Red Hood! - racing after her, now on the ground, a good few two dozen feet away from her. He was gaining, slowly, on her, and she gave another burst of speed, her throat aching, her lungs burning, but her legs hadn't given up yet on her. \"Drew, come back!\" Drew had no idea where she was, but there was no way she was stopping. She shouldn't be running from Jason - but she didn't want him, or Dick, or Bruce to find her and pester her and she could tell that she needed to start crying again. The urge to sob was hard to keep down for the moment, and being yelled at by her best friend or interrogated by the original Robin and Batman was something she needed to avoid. Drew turned another corner, and ducked into a narrow alley, pausing to catch her breath for a mere few seconds before pushing herself on. Running in soccer, luckily had helped her endurance issues, but running away from her best friend (she'd rather have a hug but she had to take a guess and say that he wasn't in the mood for that kind of thing) seemed wrong. But maybe coming back from the dead - or whatever - had changed him, somehow. He didn't act like his usual, old self. Then again, he wasn't a teenager anymore, he wasn't fighting for the good guys per se, he wasn't Robin, and he was a murderer. Apparently a lot had changed for him over the past five years. And apparently, he had more of a temper, since she'd been hearing about him for a while (and hadn't known until tonight) and his antics and oddly good deeds. She looked up and let out a cry of frustration to see Batman and Nightwing - Bruce and Dick , she had to remind herself - bouncing off of rooftops and heading straight for her . Attempting to lose all three of them (this really wasn't her nigh) and hoping the adrenaline keeping her awake and going faster than she'd even ran before wouldn't run out before morning was actually upon her. Nightwing and Batman had finally located Drew, and weren't surprised to see that the Red Hood was perusing her - but for what exactly they didn't know. As soon as she had dropped the phone they had been on their way to see her. It was surprising what one could find out in a span of hours. It looked like she didn't have any energy left, like she'd been running around all night (they had no doubt she had been) and they needed to talk to her about what she'd seen, and some explaining on their end needed to take place. They already knew about the building she'd set fire to (it seemed only likely that that would happen after leaving the Cave) and they were worried that if she didn't get rest or reasonable answers soon something bad would happen. The sight of her bandaged and bloodied hands made Dick worry for her. Bruce, however, just wanted the situation under control. There were enough people with instability running around to deal with - Drew didn't needed to be added to that list. Seeing her ducking through alleys, cutting corners, and hiding for short amounts of time before continuing on as the sun began to rise was like a mouse attempting to scurry away from the cat. Although they knew, that to Jason, this was no simply game of cat and mouse. Meanwhile, seeing Bruce and Dick again made Jason's blood boil as he once again lost sight of Drew as she dashed around a corner. Once he rounded it, pausing to catch his breath, knowing she was doing the exact same thing, he caught her running across another street, heading towards another side street. He was getting sick of her running all over Gotham - and now that Bats and Nightwing were involved in this - he was nearing the end of his patience. He looked up to see that they were taking the high route and vowed that if it weren't for the black-haired woman struggling to get away from the three of them. By himself, he would have lasted longer, but now he was just done. \"Drew!\" he called, still running towards her, just as she was about to go down the side street. She paused for a millisecond to glance back at him, and he groaned at the expression on her face. Even from a distance, he knew that on her face were several emotions: stress, confusion, fear, exasperation, and desperation. He could see her chest heaving up and down and her legs tremble for just a second. \"Stop running!\" He could see her look up, and he did too (and regretted it), seeing Dick and Bruce getting closer to her, but not as close as he was. To his frustration, seeing them seemed to jump-start her adrenaline, spurring her on out of sight. He was officially done . Drew couldn't stop, but she couldn't keep going. Her body was ready to give out, and she sincerely wanted an excuse to pass out or fall asleep right where she was (or at least where her ever-moving feet took her), but where could she possibly stop and get some sleep, especially with Batman and Nightwing after her? She heard Jason call her name again, but she couldn't stop, no, she couldn't, he was angry with her, and - Before she could take another step, she felt something slam against her body, sending her flying into a nearby, dead-end alley. Her body was thrown onto the rough pavement and she was pinned down by someone very, very heavy. She opened her mouth to scream but felt that she was too exhausted to even struggle as Jason got off of her, crouching and slapping a gloved hand over her mouth to keep her ragged breathing quiet, his own echoing off the brick walls as Batman and Nightwing passed overhead, their footfalls nearly soundless. He waited a few more minutes before he took his hand away. She still was on her back, a hand above her pounding heart, trying to calm herself, ragged breathing slowly returning to normal. She slowly sat up, her legs feeling like rubber, and sat herself up against the wall, squeezing her eyes shut. Her heart was too loud. She was sure that he could hear it - she was dead certain. He remained crouching, his helmet-ed eyes directed at her. She could feel his stare - or was it a glare? - and shifted as best she could, her eyelids growing far too heavy to fight against. \"You shouldn't have run off,\" he finally said, his voice low and quiet as it continued to snow, the sun lighting the sky with each passing minute. \"That was stupid.\" Drew had no reply for Jason, and continued to keep looking at him, her breathing still a bit labored as she fought to regain enough strength to walk - but her body was spent. \"Stupid and careless,\" he muttered. \"Why...\" it came out as a breath, and decided to save it for later. At least he wasn't yelling at her. \"They were after you because of that ,\" he said, pointing to her arms that sat on her stomach, her entire body now resembling a rag doll. \"Because now you know, and you dropped the phone at your apartment...\" he shook his head, and slowly lifted his hands to his helmet, and carefully took it off his head. Drew's breath hitched at the sight of his black hair in his eyes as he regarded her sternly, like she was really an idiot. Which she wasn't, but the last week hadn't been exactly normal. Which caused her not to act like herself. \"Drew.\" He slumped down onto the pavement, his legs touching the wall opposite him. He was also tired, but at least he could stand on his own. He was glad that his tackle had gotten them both away from Dick and Bruce. He didn't need them in this mess. They would only screw up what was already screwed up even more screwed up \"Hmmm?\" she fought to keep herself awake. The adrenaline had left her - drained her - and she was in no condition to be yelled at. It was the last thing she wanted, but she hadn't listened to him, had done what he hadn't wanted her to do. But she was just so tired, and she found herself caring less and less and more about what he wanted to say right now .\" Jason said nothing and instead stood carefully, appearing as if he'd received the perfect amount of rest to get going before he had to retire for the day. No one saw the Red Hood in the day time, now, did they Slowly, he bent over, his hands going to her shoulders, and heaved her to her feet. He reached out and held her up as soon as her legs gave out. He peeked out of the alley for a brief movement, trying to pinpoint where they were. Satisfied with their location, Jason lifted Drew off the ground, hearing a small sound of protest and a wheeze before her head lolled back and she finally passed out from exhaustion. Shaking his head, he slung her over his shoulder and put his helmet back on. He really needed to get her home.[Chapter 10] It's been a long time since this was updated. Since February, right? Well, I'd thought it would be nice if I updated this first (Ash doesn't count as being updated: I finished that... I'm so sad about it!) and then I'll do \"The Missing Piece\" (for sure!) and then the rest of the stuff :) sound good? hey, thanks for waiting btw :) I am back in business, so I will be updating more often (when I'm not off camping/trailering about in Idaho, of course) soooo... yeah! read on! review? When Drew opened here eyes, she immediately shut them. Her room was dark, and she could have sworn she'd had the most bizarre dream of dreams... Sitting bolt upright, eyes flying open, Drew looked around, memories flying inside her mind as she looked about, searching her room for any signs of the night before. She looked down at her hands. They were indeed how they were the night before. Looking down at herself, she nearly blanched. The gray t-shirt and shorts she had on had not been there the last time she had checked. Which meant... \"I think I'm going to kill him,\" she muttered, \"right after I hug him.\" Sighing, she rubbed her eyes, wiggling her toes under the sheets, thinking of all that had happened. Resting her chin in her hand, propping her elbow onto her thigh, she blew out a huff of air between her lips like she had when she had been a small child, feeling even more exhausted than she had before... ... before she had passed out. In Jason's arms. \"How embarrassing,\" she muttered, squeezing her eyes shut as she flopped back down onto her bed, strands of dark, tangled hair leaving her line of sight as she stared up at the ceiling, breathing in and out, slowly, over and over, listening to the silence of her apartment and the beating of her heart in her own ears. \"So, let's see,\" she muttered to herself, rolling over onto her stomach and peering down at the space of floor below her. Seeing a dusty, old, digital watch, she picked it up and squinted it order to check the time. It read six-thirty. Looking up at the window, feeling a bit confused, she saw that it had been covered with a curtain that hadn't been there before. Eyes narrowing, rolled back onto her back and sighed. Her body's inner clock was telling her to get up, and her body, at the same time, was telling her to go back to sleep. But she had the nagging suspicion that she had been sleeping all day long, and - \"Oh, shit !\" she screeched, sitting up as fast as she could, flinging the covers off of her body, and darting over to the phone. Picking it up (hadn't she dropped it? She couldn't remember; her brain was still asleep) and punching in the numbers to her workplace rapidly - almost too fast; she hardly even know which buttons were making the beeping sounds at her - she held the bulky device up to her ear and waited as the rings came from the other end of the line. \"Oh, crap...\" she moaned quietly, tapping her foot impatiently as the third ring began. \"Hello, Customer Services of Appliances, how may I help you?\" a familiar voice chirruped. It sounded way too happy for her liking as a dark expression dawned on Drew's face. \"Hey, it's Drew,\" she said, opening her mouth to apologize for not showing up to work, but she was interrupted. The man on the other end of the line - someone she worked with, a man who she could not remember the name of (all she knew was that he was always happy and from time to time she wondered if he was on something because no one could possibly be as happy as he always seemed to be) - gasped, and then spoke loudly, cutting her off. She snapped her mouth shut as he spoke. No need to piss him off. Not when he was the office tattle-tale. Not if he'd already reported her as \"playing hookie\" (she'd only done that once ). \"Oh, Drew! You sound terrible! Why are you calling?\" What? Sounded terrible, huh? Had she missed something in the last twenty-four hours? \"Oh, I never showed up to work today...\" she scratched the back of her head. This guy made it a huge deal when someone - anyone - missed even a day at the office without calling in fist. And she was pretty sure she hadn't called in. \"Oh, don't worry about it! Your boyfriend excused you!\" Well, she had an excuse, so that explained why he was so happy, and - Wait a second... Boyfriend? What the hell? \"Yeah, I guess he called when you were getting some sleep,\" the guy chirped happily. She could hear him typing away on his keyboard in the background, and beyond that, the familiar murmur of the office. \"He said you got sick, and that you wouldn't be in for a few days.\" \"I can come in tomorrow,\" she blurted, hating herself for missing the perfect chance to sleep for days on end and not give a damn about anyone and anything, especially since the last twenty-four hours had been somewhat chaotic. She already knew who'd called in sick for her. And that was why she couldn't stay home any longer than necessary. Honestly, she didn't need anyone at work thinking she had a boyfriend. Remaining invisible was now not an option. Dammit. \"No, you really don't have to,\" the guy said. Drew glared at the wall in front of her, her free hand on her hip. \"Oh, I think I do,\" she said. \"I'll see you tomorrow.\" Slamming the phone down, she sighed and turned away, facing her bed. \"Jason...\" Shaking her head, feeling a bit overwhelmed, she headed towards the bathroom. She wrinkled her nose, thinking of how badly she must smell after a night of running around Gotham. Her bandages had already been changed, and her hands stung. Her body was sore, and she wanted to sleep, but if she was going to deal with any of the events that had recently occurred, she was going to need a long, lukewarm shower. Besides, she knew she was going to have to deal with Jason - and not to mention Dick and Bruce - later on. They were going to talk to her - they all were - and right now, she just wanted time to think over what had happened, what she had found, what the Joker had said, what she had done, and what she had discovered. It wasn't every night that you found out your best friend was alive. It wasn't every night you found out the people who'd taken care of you were Batman and Nightwing, and had once been Robin - and was now a criminal parading around Gotham freely with a reputation that seemed more deadly than the man under the red motorcycle helmet he always wore. It wasn't every right you found out who the freaking Batman was. It wasn't every night you went and visited a madman for answers. It wasn't every night you dug up a grave with your bare hands. No, none of these things were normal, or ordinary - they were all entirely exhausting, and not to mention unsettling. If Drew was going to deal with any of this, she was going to take a shower, and then maybe order some pizza before she took any of her problems on. Yeah, that sounded like a plan alright.[Chapter 11] Did no one really like the last chapter? I thought it was decent for an update since February, but... well, I'll try and do better this chapter, okay? leave a review on your way out? feedback is much appreciated for this teenage author :) lol enjoy! Drew wasn't, by nature, particularly stubborn. But she was not, however, a liar. When she had said she was coming into work, she had meant it - though she was regretting it now, sitting at her desk, high, high off the ground, away from Gotham's city streets for the time being. In fact, she sort of wished she had taken advantage of Jason's lie - she was thinking she might have to kill (or hurt) him for making everyone at the office think she actually had a personal life - and used the lie to sleep today away as well, but it was already noon, and her lunch break was in half an hour, and it would seem odd if she just asked to go home now. The insurance company she worked for, however, was thrilled to have her back. Her coworkers - especially that tattle tale, who she desperately wanted to spill their piping hot decaf on - kept asking her and asking her about her \"boyfriend\". She had ultimately given up trying to tell them she didn't have one, and had decided to ignore them. Customer Services of Appliances - for some reason, the insurance company covered appliances , which was ridiculous, because if that were the case, than this had to be one big scam, and it wasn't - was a pain in the ass today, more so than usual. Yeah, her coworkers must have missed her so much . \" But miss! I understand since this is covered - \" \"Can't you just get a new one?\" Drew cut in, for the umpteenth time. Her feet were up on her desk, her shoes were next to her chair, and she was staring up at the ceiling, trying to focus more of her attention on the florescent lighting above than the squawking man she was currently on the phone with. \"I don't think you understand! I love my toaster oven - \" Whoever this guy was, he had to realize that she was just there to give advice and direct him to other apartments. If he didn't realize that she wasn't about to solve all his problems for him, then he needed to talk to someone else. Or never call here again. People here hated people like that. Drew sighed, exasperated. She didn't roll her eyes, though. She'd done too much of that before nine o'clock, and she was paying for it now. Whenever she did it, her eyelids felt heavy, and she felt sort of dizzy. It was almost as annoying as all the little smirks she'd been getting since she'd arrived at eight o'clock sharp. She knew they'd forget about this eventually, though - they always did. It might take the rest of today, or even tomorrow, but eventually, someone would do something stupid or horrendously hilarious that might piss the always-cheery-tattle-tale off and get them all working late. Honestly, Drew didn't think that this insurance company - or at least, this department - was actually covering kitchen appliances. But everything seemed legit - and they had hired her without a degree in business, and nothing looked out of the ordinary to her, and she was only a customer service (a lowly one, according to those in other departments) worker, so what did she know? - and since she was getting rent money, she wasn't about to complain (too much). \"Miss, I demand you direct me to another department.\" How about maintenance, then? They loved messing with customers. Drew shrugged, leaned forward towards the buttons on her telephone machine, and punched in the code for the department - who always got a laugh out of tormenting people she sent their way (she wasn't the only person who did this, but mostly, it was her) - and hung up the phone without another word. Sighing, Drew swung her legs off her desk, slipped on her tennis shoes, and stood up, stretching lazily, not unlike a cat, and scratched the back of her head with her bandaged finger tips, looking around the dingy, ill-lit floor. The familiar sound of people speaking to customers over the phone, phones ringing, people laughing, and printers and fax machines running was one that might put you to sleep if you weren't careful. Several times, Drew had dosed off due to the somehow-soothing background noise that one grew accustomed to in a matter of days. Looking around and seeing that no one was paying attention to her, Drew decided to head off to her lunch break early - surely, she wouldn't get into too much trouble - and meandered away, the laces of her worn out, dampened shoes - from the snow this morning, that she had had to slosh through in order to get to the bus stop alive - trailing behind her as she made her way past coworkers with names she couldn't bother to remember and faces that seemed familiar and yet, they seemed like strangers. Exiting the ninth floor's main room, she shuffled out into the hallway and turned left, the noise of her work-space - she wished they had cubicles, because everyone else in the building had cubicles, but they didn't, which sort of sucked, because then everyone could actually see that you weren't doing your work, and in truth, most of the employees on her floor (and maintenance, because maintenance was awesome like that) didn't really take their jobs that seriously (the only person who took their job seriously all the friggin' time was the office tattle-tale, of course) - and started heading towards the break room. Her footsteps were loud on the tiled floor, accompanied by an annoying, quiet squish when her feet met the ground, but she was too tired to honestly give a damn, and maybe it would annoy someone else - that thought should have cheered her right up, and if it had, she would have marched down the hall way, or maybe skipped, or danced, but she was too tired to care. And a bit overwhelmed. You know, because it wasn't every day you found out that: A) your best friend is alive, B) your best friend is the Red Hood, C) your best friend is the Red Hood, who is also Jason Todd, D) Bruce is Batman, E) Dick is Nightwing, and, of course, F) talking to a madman and digging up a grave with your bare hands is a great way to get your best friend/the Red Hood's attention. Drew sighed heavily, turning abruptly into the break room - which, thankfully was empty. Shuffling over sleepily to the fridge (because after the conversation with the office tattle-tale the night before she had eaten and had gone straight back to bed, not even bothering with the situation at hand because she was just too damn tied - and had woken up at six this morning with the urge to shut off her alarm and sleep for the next couple centuries), Drew opened the door and peered inside. Anything was up for grabs in the break room. Which was why it was so much fun to work here, because you got to piss off your bosses and your coworkers by eating their food. It made working here worth it. Drew looked around until she spied something that looked positively delicious - a giant piece of chocolate cake, hidden all the way in the back, behind the milk and apple juice cartons. They couldn't hide anything from her. Finding food in this fridge was too easy for Drew. Getting it out and shutting the door, she went over to the drawer by the microwave, opened it, and fished around until she found what she was looking for - a plastic fork. Getting it out and slamming the drawer shut, she began to eat it, slowly, but not too slowly - because she was sure that this was the tattle tale's cake, and damn, he got mad when someone ate his food - everyone liked to, because, not only was it fun to piss him off, but he brought pretty good things to the office, and since he never shared, everyone just liked to take his food - and when he was in a bad mood, you actually had to do work, or else he'd march you right up to your boss' office and try his hardest to get you fired. Turning around and facing the sink, which was below the microwave - which, to Drew's disgust, hadn't been cleaned since the lasagna from last week had exploded because an unnamed and unknown idiot from her floor hadn't bothered to cover their lunch - she set down her plate, leaned down so her elbows could rest on the counter, and continued to eat in silence, savoring the majorly chocolate-y flavor. Yeah, she was gonna get yelled at for this, but who cared? She knew she should be sitting at the table, because the janitors were so touchy about where people ate - because, you know, that was why there was a table in the break room in the first place - but she was too tired, as said before, to care, so she continued to eat, stuck in her own, tired mind - unfortunately, though, she should have been paying more attention to the footsteps that had been coming down the hallway, and had halted outside the room with carpeted tiled floor. But she finished her cake slowly, and she straightened up and tossed the paper plate and fork in the trash can. Wiping her mouth on her sleeve, Drew turned around to leave, and get back to work, when her eyes landed on the figure who had been watching her for some time now. And she froze. Oh - oh hell no. This couldn't make her day any better. In fact, the man who was smirking at her was probably going to make her day worse.[Chapter 12] I am watching Mulan while writing this (Disney/Dreamworks/Pixar movie marathon on a Sunday... yay!) (and don't judge me I LOVE MULAN because that was like the first movie I ever saw on Disney that had a badass girl in it... well... besides Kim Possible. Yeah yeah laugh it up - a teen watching a kids movie? yeah. unheard of. *cough cough*. But COME ON it's a phenomenal movie and it's better than a lot of the Disney movies that came after it... IMO, btw.) and I was thinking 'why not write a one-shot' and so if you see a random Mulan one-shot appear out of nowhere that might or might not be hooked into a crossover don't be alarmed XD I found a bug leg in my blue lollipop... And by the way: I never have high hopes for a lot of Disney movies but DANG Mulan has some promising-looking fics that I REALLY WANT TO READ but I have chapters to give to you awesome readers... ... ignore me... M'kay. I'll shut up now :3 Thanks for reading! \"It's a little early for cake, don't you think?\" Drew, for a moment, lost her will to speak, and in that moment, the young man, who was now leaning against the door frame, chose to continue smirking as her mind tried to wrap around the fact that the one person she hadn't planned on seeing at work - ever - was standing not five feet away from her, looking very, very... er, smug. Yeah. Smug seemed to be the right word. \"I - uh...\" \"Lost for words already? Your break hasn't even started yet.\" Drew shook her head, trying to get her brain to work right, to summon up some sort of emotion that would motivate her to promptly yell at this man to get out of her building - mainly because she didn't want to talk to him... regarding last night. Or was it the night before? Drew could hardly remember. \" Dick! What are you doing here?\" Bruce's first adoptive son only grinned at her. He looked a bit too happy to have caught her off guard. Which was strange. She still hadn't gotten yelled at by Bruce, or Jason, or him yet for the other night's (was it the other night? it was all so fuzzy, and she was too tired to remember correctly) events. And she was still waiting to be yelled at. Oh, shit . He was here. That meant that whatever he had to say, would probably include yelling. This couldn't be good. \"Uh... what do you want?\" \"Oh, I just dropped in to say hi,\" he said, his seemingly smug and cheery mood disappearing in a flash as his expression sobered into something a bit more serious. \"See how you were doing. And it looks like you're doing okay.\" \"Chocolate cake is not an antidote for the other night,\" Drew pointed out, putting her hands on her hips while looking at him suspiciously. She could guess that he was either here to give her some sort of lecture on secrecy or that he was really checking on her well-being. She suspected that both might occur. \"Yeah, about that...\" he rubbed the back of his neck, looking over his shoulder - probably checking for any eavesdroppers. He returned his attention back to the young woman who was now leaning against the counter, arms crossed over her chest. She studied him. He was actually dressed like a normal, every day citizen of Gotham - jeans, t-shirt, and a leather jacket. Not one of those suits Bruce was always wearing - and he wore them a lot, too, which was ridiculous, because if Drew had to guess, it was a Wayne thing , to wear those suits all the damn time. At least he made attempt to blend in and look normal. No need to get any more suspicious looks at work. \"I need to talk to you. About that. About everything.\" Drew raised an eyebrow. \"Wow. No lecture?\" \"That's Bruce's job.\" \"Well, if you haven't noticed, I'm working... so. Rain check on that talk.\" \"Jason hasn't come by to see you, has he?\" Drew's demeanor changed - only slightly - at the mention of Jason. Erasing him from her mind so she could actually do some work (since she had so kindly and stubbornly told the tattle-tale that she would be coming in, even though now she was regretting the fact that she had turned down Jason's lie, because if she had just gone along with it, she could have still been sleeping right now, and her body ached all over) hadn't worked at all. Drew's expression grew slightly somber. \"I can't believe I didn't know about... all that ... after living with you guys for so long.\" Dick flashed her a smile. \"Yeah, well, keeping secrets is one of our many talents.\" \"'We' being who again?\" His smile vanished. \"You're not mad about it, are you?\" he asked. \"No... I'm just... overwhelmed.\" That word summed it up completely; being overwhelmed thoroughly exhausted her. \"Well, I'm... under whelmed by your reaction to... finding out about everything.\" \"You were never going to tell me, were you?\" It wasn't even stated as a question. Dick shook his head. \"We would rather have just kept you in the dark for as long as possible. Less complicated that way.\" \"What's complicated about it?\" Drew was frowning now. Strange that he mentioned it - she wasn't angry at all. A lot of people would have been, in her situation, but for what? For what , could they be angry about? It's not like it was something bad they were hiding. It was just... concerning . \"It's just... the less who know, the better.\" Drew nodded slowly, deciding that this was not the best place to be asking questions about who Dick, Jason, and Bruce moonlighted as. But she would ask sometime - probably the same time when Bruce wanted to give her that lecture about secrecy and such. \"Oh, and, one more thing, before I go,\" Dick said, pushing himself off the door frame, standing up straight. \"I wasn't even made aware that you were going to go,\" Drew said. Her voice was a bit too snide for either of their liking, but then again, she wasn't too thrilled to see him - all she wanted to do was sleep . \"I figured you wouldn't want me hanging around for too long,\" Dick said, shrugging, giving her a half-hearted grin. \"But we are going to have to talk about this - me, you, and Bruce. And Jason... well, I want you to stay away from him. For as long as possible.\" \"Why?\" Her blurting was really out of character. Drew couldn't remember if she'd been hit on the head with something awful hard - that would explain her oddness at the moment. Dick seemed to notice this too - and he was probably thinking the very same thing. That thought was very unappealing. \"Because... he... just... just do it, okay? No need to go getting into trouble.\" Dick sighed and turned away from her, presumably to go down the hall towards the elevators. Before he walked away, though, he gave her a knowing look over his shoulder before saying, \"Look, Drew: I know you want to see him. I know you want to talk to him.\" Well, maybe - maybe after she hit him on the head with something. \"But you've got to listen to me: whatever you do, don't let him corner you . We just don't want to go there right now. It'll cause everyone problems - you, me, Bruce, him - especially Jason. We don't need you getting dragged into this.\" \"I already am,\" Drew said. \"I know, and that's what worries me.\" he muttered, and finally moved out of her line of sight, leaving her alone in the break room once again. There needs to be a \"Man of Steel\" category for this site. I don't like looking through \"Superman\" when there should just be a \"Man of steel\" category. Wonder if it will pop up, because I'm too shy (shocker. I know.) to request it. THERE NEEDS TO BE A \"MAN OF STEEL CATEGORY\". There really does![Chapter 13] The end of the world has begun. Wanna know why? Cuz I've already got the first chapter of my disastrous MOS fic completed ;) I figured that even though I can't post it in its official category yet (for a while, apparently. dang it!) I should start writing it. Crazy, right? I was writing it last night and there was a spider in my bed... I hate spiders! But I managed to finish it (over 2,400 words! And only 300 something belonged to the A/N regarding warnings about the rating! HA! but it's gonna be sooooo long...) and I'm already started on chapter 2 :) but the damn title (pardon my french but seriously) won't appear out of nowhere. Also, a Zutara fic is being planned, and a Zutara (MAYBE Kataang instead, but I'm thinking not so much on that one) one-shot will be posted sometime in the future. Not like you care, though. this and that have nothing to do with APNB, so, I'm gonna shut up about that (but I'm soooo excited for these things! don't judge me. be quiet!). so... I'm gonna shut up and let you read the next chapter of this story now... Drew hated being the only one left in the office when it got towards the end of the day. It was one of the many things she disliked about her job - especially now because the office tattle tale (she'd never known that his name was Ernie) had actually had the nerve to rat her out to someone (she didn't really care to remember which superior he'd contacted after immediately deciding that it was her who'd eaten his cake) and now she was the only one left on the floor. Everyone else on the upper and lower floors would be going home soon. It was only ten till five. For some reason, her department got stuck with the earlier work hours, but that meant they left before everyone. The last person (Ernie) had cleared out of there only about thirty minutes before. Drew had to restrain herself from banging her head against her desk. She hadn't even bothered with filling out any forms or paperwork that she had neglected to deal with in past weeks. In all honesty, Drew hated paperwork. The most that she got paid for was answering emails and phone calls as sarcastically and unhelpfully as she possibly could. And sending phone calls to maintenance. The shit they pulled with customers was just friggin' hilarious . Drew heaved out a sigh and sat back in her chair, scowling down at the slowly diminishing pile of files and forms and other things that she had to deal with. She could think Ernie for all of this work tomorrow. He'd given her over half of this. Glancing out the window nearest her, which faced the buildings across the streets and showed the streets and sidewalks below. Though she hated being here alone, in the evening, she had to admit the silence wasn't all that bad. It was better, actually, then being at home. Because at home, she could be bothered. Pestered. Annoyed. Over and underwhelmed by certain people who - Aw, crap . She hadn't meant to think of it - of them - of him - of any of it. Paperwork might have been boring, but it was a distraction , and now there wasn't even a point in trying to get back to work now that she'd thought about it. About them. About him . ... god dammit . Drew sighed again, and decided that her legs were in need of a stretch. Her rear felt odd from sitting for nearly five hours without a needed break. But her head was clear. She felt lazy, tired almost, but it was a nice feeling. Almost as if she was relaxed. Almost, if it weren't for the past few days' events that were now swarming around inside her head. It made her feel sort of nauseous. Sort of. It was a barely-there feeling, but it was still there. Sort of. It was almost as if she hadn't come across everything that she wasn't supposed to know. But Jason had played a part in her knowing, too. So her impulses weren't all her fault. Standing up, she stretched, her arms going far above her head as she threw back her head as she let out a yawn. A nap was in order here, but then again, falling asleep at work probably wouldn't be the best idea. Her boss might see her, and he might get mad at her. Maybe fire her, too. Ernie would probably have cheered at the idea, if he had been present and if she had said it a-loud. Yeah, he would have been ecstatic . Probably. Moving towards the windows, she couldn't help but glance around. She'd only been on this floor without anyone else once before. It had been a creepy-as-hell experience. She'd kept hearing noises upstairs. But she hadn't checked them out - Ernie had made her stay late. Therefore, she had been only doing the work he had made her finish. Her job description did not include checking out creepy-as-hell noises upstairs, downstairs, or anywhere. Halting when she wasn't even an inch away from the glass, she allowed her eyes to roam about the outside world. The sounds of Gotham were muffled, due to the fact that she was inside, away from the streets and people. People who were going home . Drew frowned as she pressed her hands and nose against the glass, remembering that the janitors hated fingerprints (though the maintenance crew that worked downstairs did it all the time) but couldn't bring herself to care while she watched the city pass by, unaware of her prying and careful eyes. This is what she liked to do, as a child, when she was on a bus, or in a car, or window shopping. She still liked to do it sometimes. But she wasn't a child. She was a grown woman, who had several issues that had yet to be sorted out inside her head - and she had a lecture to look forward to in the future from the Dark Knight himself, which didn't sound very promising. Sighing, Drew slouched a bit more against the glass, her cheek resting against the cool material. November was nearly over. Soon it would be Thanksgiving. And then it would be Christmas. Drew didn't mind the holiday season that much, but she didn't enjoy it. Not when she'd been spending it alone since she'd gone off to live by herself, away from the Wayne's estate. The silence seemed to settle over her, for who knows how long, but eventually, it was broken. And not by a coworker, or by the sound of the long-gone inhabitants of the building she was in. No, not at all. Someone cleared his throat, and Drew stiffened. Her heart sank. She could already feel the headache coming on, and it wasn't even completely dark out yet. \"Enjoying the view?\" Well, so much for Dick's plea, Drew thought idly, wondering if she could somehow make a run for it, somehow get away without having to talk to him, to confront him about everything - because she didn't think she was really ready. So much for avoiding Jason. Totally forgot which month I've placed this story in. If you remember, stick it in a review to let me know in case I got it wrong in this chapter.[Chapter 14] Dear technology: you are the downfall of my MOS story. I hope you're happy with ruining my fic D: Well then. I decided to write another chapter of this since my MOS fic is... no longer being written. It's back to being a plan. (gives computer a pointed look for screwing it all up and making me so mad I deleted the rest of my work ). My muse is somewhat, but thanks to WWZ, my muse is focused on that. And a new Supey-MOS-verse fic. It's sad. It makes me sad. But I'm writing it anyways. Hooray. Drew couldn't believe it. First Dick, now Jason. It was like a really gone-sour reunion. Drew had her arms crossed over her chest. Her eyes were narrowed, and she figured that it might be a bad idea to try and make a run for it. Well, she thought, she could try and make a run for it, if he got any closer. And he had her backed up against the window. Yeah, she probably wasn't going to make a run for it. \"I'm pretty sure I'd called in sick for you.\" Jason had his arms at his sides, but she could tell he was glaring down at her. He was so close that she could actually tell that he was pissed at her. He obviously had no idea that he was standing too goddamn close. There was still at least a foot between them, maybe a bit less, but still - she hadn't thought any of this through, and her head wasn't even on straight. She needed time . Obviously, he wasn't going to give it to her. Something was up with him, though. Drew could tell. And when she could tell, simply from reading his body language - because, reminding herself that it was Jason , she could look for the signs - like the occasional but compulsive clenching of the fists, the stiff posture, the lowered voice - it all screamed at her that he was pissed, for some reason. She cared, she really did. But in all honesty, she just wanted to go home, eat something rather unhealthy (takeout sounded good about now), take a hot shower, and then sleep for a week. But no . She could hardly even remember how'd she gotten caught up in all of this. Hadn't she been walking home? From her old school? Drew nearly sighed in frustration. She was too damned tired to remember. And Jason wasn't letting her go anywhere . \"And I'm pretty sure you are not my doctor. Or my boss. Or my boyfriend , thank you very much!\" He relaxed. A tiny bit; his shoulders slumped. Drew wondered what he had on his mind. And then she came to the conclusion that she could not and would not bring herself to care. At all. Until she got some sleep. And he left her alone. For, at least, maybe, another few hours. \"I was covering for you.\" He snorted. He actually snorted at her. \"You should be thanking me, Drew.\" \"I should be running away, or calling the police, or, hell - maybe even Nightwing or Batman - \" There was a gloved hand over her mouth and a body shoving hers into the window before she could blink. It didn't hurt, but damn , her heart was beating fast . He was making it difficult to breathe, but she couldn't help the squeak that had followed this sudden action (she really should have just have thanked him for getting her some sleep and made a hasty escape, but she'd obviously pissed him off - and, again - she could not care while she was near sleeping on her feet ) and then a muffled string of curses as she struggled against him, but to no avail. He was tall . And strong. And big! She tried to scream at him to let her go, to allow her to leave the building, but he was tense again, and she had a feeling that mentioning Bruce and Dick had not in the slightest been a really good idea. Aw, shit . \"You were actually considering that?\" His tone was now bitter. It stung, for a moment, until she remembered who the hell this was and what the hell he was doing to her. She made an \"uhm- hmmm \" sound with narrowed eyes, and she could tell that his glare had just about intensified tenfold. Aw, shit. This really wasn't her day, at all in fact. Apparently, it was too much to ask to go home. Ugh. Jason mouth his hand away from her mouth, and she took her chance to speak: \"Y'know, you obviously forgot that you're a criminal and still technically dead . Oh, and would you get off me? I'd like to be able to breathe .\" He didn't move. When he spoke, she could hear the sneer in his voice. \"Dick talked to you.\" It wasn't even a question. \"Yeah, he did.\" There was no need to lie. Rather, there was no need to piss Jason off any more than he already was pissed off. That would not help her situation. \"And what did Dicky say?\" Drew decided, at that moment, to make a stupid decision, and snort , before answering. \"I'll tell you if you get off me, Jay.\" This time, he listened. Drew realized she was being... well, a bitch. This was her best friend , and she was treating him like shit. But, if he'd been alive for a while, and if she were still his best friend (while he was still hers), then wouldn't he have let her know that he had been alive? Wouldn't someone have dropped a hint sometime soon? She understood Dick and Bruce's not telling her. That was too understandable to be mad about. Because, come on - it was Dick and Bruce. But, she realized, she had, at least, expected Jason Peter Todd , of all people, to break the rules and tell her. But, no . He'd somehow become un-dead without being a repulsive zombie (thank god; she didn't know if she would be friends with a zombie if he had been, but she probably would have, seeing as how it would have still been Jason, even in zombie form), and he had started killing people . So, Drew ultimately decided that she would do her best, in her exhausted, stressed-out state, that she would give him hell. And hell was exactly what she gave him, because she was pretty sure that he was sick and tired of running after her. And this time, after he actually did step away, Drew managed to duck under his arm and get past him, her eyes trained on the doorway that led out of the office. Her destination was not the elevator. It was the stairs. But, hearing the enraged shout of \"Drewwwwww!\" as he started to go after her once she'd rounded the corner and started sprinting down the hall and toward the heavy, stairwell door, she knew she was screwed if she didn't get out of there fast . Yeah. Drew was definitely screwed. Dead. Doomed. All of the above. And, damn, why did people make the stupidest, dumbass decisions when they were tired? She wished she knew. Sorry for the cliffee... I just couldn't resist! HAPPY FOURTH OF JULY! :)[Chapter 15] 60 REVIEWS! OHMYGAWD THAAAAANK YOU! You guys are awesome for sticking with this story. Feedback is appreciated, yadda yadda, (but no really it is, and you guys are awesome for that, and thank you thank you thank you for reading and following and favoriting and reviewing and being epic people) LET'S JUST GET ON WITH THE CHAPPIE, shaaaall we? Drew shoved upon the stairwell door upon reaching the end of the hallway, knowing that Jason had just come out of her work space area and was now running - quite fast - down the hall towards her. She'd promised Dick she'd stay away from him, and that's exactly what she was trying to do - although, she figured, that probably wasn't about to happen, even though she could already feel the adrenaline pumping through her system (which would hopefully give her the burst of speed she'd need to get away from him) - because when Jason was pissed, it was like he had a knack for getting to what he was angry at no matter what. With her hand on the cold, metal railing, she raced down the steps, jumping two or three at a time. Every time she'd get on one of the small, square platforms that would lead to the next few stairs, she'd stumble a bit, and then she'd glance up to see that Jason was still at least a few platforms away from her (thank god she'd played some soccer as a child). With the ground-floor exit in sight, she pushed herself to run even faster, and she jumped the entire next set of stairs, landing on her feet (stumbled, and nearly fell flat on her face), and she shoved open the door, and found herself sprinting across the street. Never-mind the traffic she'd just stopped or the drivers she'd just earned honks from (because as soon as her feet reached the sidewalk again she heard the exit-door open with a lot more force than she had opened it with) - she had to somehow get away from him, preferably before he caught up to her. Honestly, as his ( former ? she didn't know) best friend, she had no idea what he'd do when he caught her (because, when Jason chased something, he always caught up to it - there had been proof of that throughout his childhood, she supposed, if she could manage to think about that while trying to run from him at the same time), and she didn't want to find out. She dashed around a corner, and nearly slammed into a fancy-business-suited man with a cell phone cradled between his shoulder and ear, and suddenly, she was struck with the urge to commit a crime. She was probably going to go to jail for this, but at the second, it really seemed necessary. She slowed her pace just long enough so she could snatch it away from him, and then she was off again, punching in numbers as she kept her eyes ahead of her, ignoring the man's shouting behind her. Chancing a glance over her shoulder as she started to round another corner, she saw Jason shove the man aside (she didn't miss the way his eyes slid to the man for the second that she'd looked at him) as he ran after her, and this time, she didn't run into anyone - which was a relief. She put the phone up to her ear, hoping ( really hoping) that her fingers had remembered the number she'd memorized years ago, and that who she was calling would pick up the damn phone. Dashing across a street, and nearly getting hit by a white sedan, Drew knew she wasn't going to last all night long. There wasn't a chance that she would, because Jason had been training for stunts like this. He apprehended people, good and bad - he always caught whatever he wanted, no matter how far or how much his prey ran. On the third rang, he answered. \"Who is this?\" Drew breathed out a choppy sigh of relief as she glanced over her shoulder and saw that Jason was getting closer. He was at least twenty feet behind her, but that only made her go faster - because she didn't want to get caught, not without telling someone what might become of her because she'd been - well, a bitch towards her maybe-best friend. \"Dick! It's me, it's Drew!\" She heard a sharp intake of breath on the other end of the line, and she knew that he knew that she was running. Crossing another street, and throwing a glance at a group of pedestrians who were gawking at the chase, she tried to breathe easier, tried to ignore the beginnings of the aches in her legs and hips, which would soon - soon , but not now - be her downfall. \"Drew, what the hell are you doing?\" He sounded sort of worried. (Wait, so he didn't know she was probably running for her life? Well, wasn't that just dandy .) Sort of. More irritated, though. \"Running from Jason,\" she panted into the phone, cutting into an alley, and seeing a sidewalk on the other end coming quickly closer. It was a tight squeeze - well, sort of, but she was small enough that she could slip through nearly unscathed, but hopefully, it would take Jason a few seconds longer to get through - but she was out in less than five seconds. She leaped out into the open, and nearly collided with a woman that smelled faintly of garlic (vampire repellent, Drew thought idly as she cut a short left. It was amazing that the adrenaline was keeping her creeping exhaustion and inevitable collapse at bay. And to think, not ten minutes earlier, she'd wanted sleep . She crossed the street at the end of the sidewalk. Her heart was pounding in her ears as she heard Dick swear on the other end of the line. \"I thought I told you - \" \"I know you what you said, Grayson, and trust me , I'm trying!\" \"Do you need help?\" \"Some assistance would be nice ,\" she nearly tripped over a curb she hadn't realized she'd been running for while trying to speak coherent English to Dick, who sounded like he was now on the move as well (but not out of breath), and realigned her footing as her feet continued to pound into the sidewalk, with her heart beating loudly. The adrenaline rush was being kind to her tonight, or so it seemed. But her luck was going to run out soon if someone didn't do something, and being chased all around Gotham by you maybe-best friend wasn't the best thing in the world to be doing, but since she didn't really have a choice, she just made sure she was going faster, and not letting Jason - The Red Hood - get any closer. Her little idea - about the alleyway - seemed to have worked, because he was a bit more behind her than he originally had been (thank god), but she didn't use this advantage to slow down. She had to keep moving, long enough for someone or something to come and save her sorry ass, because she wasn't exactly hero/vigilante material, and she wasn't really that brave or great of a person, so - yeah. Just keep swimming, just keep swimming (running), right? \"Give me the next street sign you pass and I'll be there as fast as I can.\" Drew was positive that Gotham wasn't a place where Dick hung out usually - you know, when he was Nightwing, because, oh, she didn't know: wasn't there Bludhaven to take care of, too? - but if he could get to her before Jason could... well, she'd owe him one. Maybe two. Because, like hell she was going to let Jason catch her - even if he was her best friend. Well, sort of best friend - Drew's eyes flashed to the sign of the corner she was coming up on and blurted out what she read as she raced past it and crossed another street. The farther she went, she realized, the emptier the streets were getting. This wasn't good. \"Smith & Jenkinhiemer,\" she said, and, seeing that Jason was now gaining on her (just a bit, but enough to make her eyes widen and a new, small rush of adrenaline to come pumping through her body). And she could only guess what had made him go a little bet faster. Well, shit . He probably wasn't too thrilled about the whole oh-yeah, by-the-way-I'm-calling-Dick -because-I-really-don't-wanna-see-you -and-you're-not-going-away- so-yeah-deal- with-it ordeal. Well, neither was she, because of the whole Batman-is-Bruce and Nightwing-is-Dick ( and the The-Red-Hood -is-Robin-who-is-Jason-freaking -Peter-Todd), but she wasn't chasing after him because of it. \"Keep going straight for three more signs and then turn one corner. I'll be there as soon as I can.\" With that, he hung up. With a cry of frustration, Drew hurled the phone over her shoulder at Jason, because, really , he derseved to have something thrown at him. He really did. He dodged it, easily, but he seemed none too pleased about this action, and the fact that, in the one glance she sent over her shoulder before she returned her attention to the street signs, she'd seen his eyes narrow told her that she needed to go a lot more faster than at the rate she was going . The adrenaline was draining, slowly - she could feel it, but she just pushed herself to go faster, and faster, she did go - but Jason wasn't going anywhere. Drew's eyes swept over the first sign... and then the second... and finally, the third, and then, just as she turned the sharp corner, a gloved hand reached out and yanked her into a cramped side alley. Her eyes went wide as she saw Dick glare at her before jumping out onto the sidewalk. He mouth go at her (she was sure he didn't mean go home) as the sound of boot-clad feet skidding to a stop reached her ears. \"Well, well, so she did call you after all.\" Jason sounded a bit winded, which boosted her ego a little (who could say that they ran from the Red Hood with help and actually didn't get caught?) as she turned and started running again, doubting that Jason would stop long to talk to Dick, but, seeing as how she had no idea what Nightwing was going to do to the Red Hood (it felt so weird knowing their identities, being one of the only people who probably did was even weirder, though), she pushed herself to go even faster. Because, for the second, Jason wasn't chasing after her (she didn't even recognize the area anymore, but picked a random direction as she busted out of the alleyway and hurtled down the empty sidewalk), but that didn't mean she was safe. She had to keep running, and, as she whipped around another corner, feeling her pace lagging a bit, she swore profusely under her breath as she cursed her luck and continued on. She really hoped Dick stalled him long enough for her to find somewhere safe to hide. Or maybe he'd knock him out. Or maybe - - she didn't even know what Dick had up his sleeve! Drew snorted. It didn't really matter what Dick did, she thought, as she crossed a street, her eyes glancing around at her surroundings - which seemed strangely desolate, for some reason - because she was still screwed. Because Jason always got what he chased after, no matter what. Goddammit.[Chapter 16] You people... how can you all be so awesome?! :D I have no idea, but let's get on with the chapter! (I know this might seem to be dragging but that is how this story is at the mo because my muse is nearly gone and it only comes back fully once in a while... sorry!) (70 REVIEWS AND OVER 60 FOLLOWS AND OMG I LOVE YOU ALL FOR STICKING WITH ME AND MY HORRIBLE ATTEMPTS AT UPDATING BECAUSE YOU ALL DESERVE MORE CHAPPIES THAN I DISH OUT) (By the way, I'm glad you guys liked the chase scene!) Cheers! Dick stared (more like glared) at Jason with his arms crossed over his chest, while Jason just stared (glared) right back. The elder of the two sighed, and shook his head, and he saw his adoptive brother stiffen (because he knew what was coming) as he spoke. \"What in the hell do you think you're doing?\" he asked, giving the Red Hood a disbelieving look \" Why were you chasing after Drew - again ?\" When he got no answer, he sighed. \"You've got to leave her alone.\" \"You told her to stay away from me.\" His town was accusing, and bitter. Of course it was, though - he couldn't expect anything different from Jason Todd, after all. \"I did,\" Dick agreed, shrugging nonchalantly, and he sees Jason's hands tighten into angry fists at his sides. \"Because I know she'll listen, but you have to leave her alone .\" A snort was his reply to this. \"Why should I?\" \"Because, like it or not, you're still her best friend, and I'd prefer it if I didn't find her dead in a gutter somewhere because one of your enemies spotted your repeated attempts to chase her through the city without a care for anything else in the world.\" \"Best friend, huh?\" Jason's tone has taken on a mocking tone, one that Dick doesn't like, but he kept silent. \"Well, I hate to burst her bubble, but we're grown ups now. Grown ups don't have best friends. Didn't you tell her that?\" His voice was sharp - sharp, brutal, and hurtful - and Dick, again, was glad that he had decided to come to Drew's rescue, because if she'd heard what he'd just said, she would probably wouldn't take it so well. Because, you know, she'd burnt a building down, dug up a grave, and ran all over the city the other day because she'd found out the the one person she counted on most throughout her childhood (till his death, of course, which had affected her more than Jason probably knew) Jason sounded upset - sort of. Dick didn't quite now why his brother was saying things he was, but he had to guess that his interrupting his pursuit of Drew probably hadn't been taken well. In fact, it had probably pissed Jason off, but since Drew had actually listened to Dick he was willing to put up with the Red Hood if it meant he'd let Drew deal with the fact that Jason Peter Todd was alive but he doubted Jason would leave her alone for long - it just wasn't like him to be patient, even if he'd made up his mind to be. \"Jason.\" He turned his head towards him, and Dick rolled his eyes. \"If you say that around her - \" \"Look, I don't - \" \" Jason , dammit, you're going to make her hate you. Do you really want that?\" Jason's silence gave him his blatant answer. \"I suggest you leave her alone, before Bruce decides to intervene. You hate it when he involves himself in your business, remember?\" \" Yeah , I remember, Dick .\" \"Then don't go after her again.\" He heard a sneer in his voice the next time he spoke. \"I don't want her to hate me, but she's not going to listen to me unless I make her. Besides, why the hell is she running from me if I'm her best friend ?\" Dick sighed. \"Anyone with a lick of common sense - and someone who didn't know you as a kid - would see you and run in the opposite direction. Apparently, she's got common sense - or some left - because she's staying away from her and it's good for her , staying away - \" \"That doesn't make any sense.\" \"If you're not her best friend, then why do you even care if she listens to you or not?\" Again, his silence gave him his answer, and he shook his head again. \"You're going to do something stupid - reckless.\" \"You sound just like Bruce.\" \"You think that's because he's right about you?\" Dick countered. \"Look, I didn't come here to fight you, I came here to get you away from Drew, and hopefully she's safe somewhere - \" \"You don't know if she's safe ,\" Jason suddenly snapped. \"You don't know anything about her right now - if she's safe, where she's at...\" Dick groaned. \"She'd better not have gotten herself into trouble because of you chasing her, Jason.\" The Red Hood snarled at him from under his helmet. \"You're the one who told her to keep going - \" \"I'm serious here.\" Jason's silence, once again, reached his ears. \"She can take care of herself.\" He snorted. \"Hardly.\" Dick raised an eyebrow. \"You think she's not.\" It wasn't a question - it was a statement, a stated fact. \"No, I don't, because did you see how she reacted when she found out I'm alive - \" \"That's different . Running from trouble is different from finding out that the person who you treasured dearly isn't actually dead after a long time - and she also knows that you were Robin , before this - \" he gestured to the Red Hood costume he was wearing - \" - and she knows who we are. How do you expect her to take that lightly?\" The sneer came back to his voice. \"I don't.\" Dick shook his head, and turned away to leave (he knew he needed to start looking for Drew, because, odd's were that Jason was right, that she'd gotten herself into trouble, though he really hoped she was home by now). \"God, Jason - you'd better stay away from her if you keep talking like this. If you talk this way to me, and then talk this way to her - do you think she'll ever want to see you again? Pretend like you don't, but you do care. Now, before you go off and after her again, I'm going to go and check up on her and you can go right back to being the big bad crime lord that you are.\" \"You can't - \" \" Jason .\" Dick gives him a disappointed look, one that he knew would make Jason's blood burn with anger. \" Just stop .\" And with that, he left the Red Hood alone on the sidewalk, staring at where his adoptive brother had been standing. Stop ... stop... stop, is what he'd just said. Why would he ever stop ?[Chapter 17] MY LOVELY READERS IT IS 3 OR SOMETHN AM AND OGHMYGOODDDD I NEEDED TO BE NICE AT THIS HOUR SO HERE YOU GO AND I HOPE YOU ALL HAVE NICE LIVES AND IF NOT I HOPE THIS MAKES YOUR DAY BECAUSE HIGH SCHOOL STARTS ON THE TWENTY-FIRST FOR ME AND I REALLY DON'T WANT TO GO THERE AND THIS IS THE MENTAL FREAK OUT I HAVE BEEN WAITING ALL SUMMER FOR AND I AM ALSO WATCHING BUFFY PLEASE IGNORE ME AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR LOVELY REVIEWS I DON'T DESERVE THEM AT ALL BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY ARE LIKE HELPING ME WRITE BUT SO IS THE 7K VIEWS THAT THIS STORY HAS GOTTAN AND WAAAAAAHHHH AND I WILL SHUDDAP BECAUSE - REASONS (gibberish follows this outburst...)

Dick had only gotten two blocks away from where he had confronted Jason when he realized that the Red Hood was following him . Instead of going on, ignoring his (rather troublesome) presence, acting like it didn't exist as he now headed towards her apartment building, he halted in his tracks atop a parking garage's roof, spinning around and crossing his arms over his chest (yet again) to see Jason following close behind. When he landed on his feet on the same roof Dick was on, he stopped when his head lifted, to see that Dick had caught him. \"Jason. Stay away from her -\" \"You think something you say, Dicky,\" he straightened up, and rolled his shoulders, \"is going to stop me from doing anything? Have you forgotten who I am?\" His tone was mocking, and snide. Dick snorted. \"I remember that you used to be a semi-good person, till you took your trip to hell, came back and decided to spread it all around for the rest of Gotham.\" \"I'm the Red Hood . And you - you're Nightwing .\" Wait, so this was a bad thing now? Really? Did it not occur to him that this was the way ten year old boys acted when they didn't want to share their inner-most feelings ? Dick shrugged, turning away from his brother. He did not have time for this - to deal with a bitter, snide, angry Jason (maybe on another night, when Drew probably wasn't missing). He needed to drop by her apartment (he doubted she'd pick up if he called - there was a possibly she'd smashed it against the wall in a burst of emotion, but then again, he didn't know, and he decided that he would personally check with his own eyes to make sure nothing had happened to her because if something had, well - he only hoped he got there before Jason did, because it didn't matter if Jason acted mature or not and admitted that he didn't hate Drew - if something happened , the Red Hood would happen , and people would probably die - no, people would die, for certain, and then they would keep dying till Drew was found and they found out whatever had happened - so he really hoped that when he got there, she would be fine - pissed, he could deal with, but all he wanted was for her to be fine ). Because Jason wouldn't have tagged along if he thought it wasn't worth any of his time. (And he knew Drew was definitely worth Jason's time if he'd chased her more than once through Gotham without so much as a hesitation or a second thought.) So it's easy to brush of Jason's harsh words, snide tone, and overall idiocy (Dick's not stupid .) \"I shouldn't be telling you this - but how about you go blow something up? Kill someone? Do something that the Red Hood would do - \" \"This is something I would do!\" Dick merely shook his head, and started running again, but one glance over his shoulder told him that Jason wasn't going to not follow him there. So he simply ignored him (tried his best to, for a while, anyway) and ran faster. He really needed to find Drew. (Preferably before Jason did.) The two men eventually end up running beside each other, jumping roof tops, vaulting chain link fences that would separate less agile people from their deaths if they leaned too far over the edges, and running across short stretches of brick, cement, concrete, and metal (they crossed several construction sites) by the time Drew's apartment came into sight, a few blocks away, and that only made them run faster. Dick noted silently that they (just the two of them) hadn't had any real interaction since he'd caused injury to his leg. After Bruce had told him about - well, everything , he hadn't really had to fight him or had to talk to him (not really) in a long, long time. Now, though, he couldn't help but be suspicious of him. Jason avoided the Bat family like the plague (especially more so now, because Drew knew ) and he detested any sort of interaction with them (since his resurrection) because Bruce had made sure to tell everyone who needed to know (a few Justice League members here, Bat-clan members there - the usual lot) that Jason was, in fact, alive - but unwell, so to speak, because, well, - the Red Hood persona had happened . Dick's thoughts were cut short as they arrived on her apartment's roof, and leaned over the edge, where they could see her closed windows. From what they could tell, there weren't any lights coming from it, so it was a possibility that she'd made it home and had decided to sleep (but the doubt gnawing at his insides - the same doubt that was probably eating away at Jason, who was already maneuvering himself over the ledge and onto the fire escape a few windows away from her own, one floor below. The first ex-Boy Wonder watched as the more recent (ex) Robin opened the window with ease after using the neighboring windowsills to hang onto hers, which only told Dick that she hadn't locked it - and, it made him remember she did that out of habit (because Bruce and the boys had drilled it into her head to use whatever common sense she had to be safe in her own home, though, now, Jason was doubting she could take care of herself - which Dick disagreed with, of course , considering that she'd managed to slip away from Jason - with his help, but he was still giving her credit for the act, though he suspected that she might have provoked him because Jason was still in a foul mood). He watched as the younger of the two of them peered into the window and, after a moment, managed to get inside. (He closed his eyes for a moment before rolling them heavenward, because at any second now he was sure he would be hearing sputtered curses and a clash or two from within the apartment because it was evident that she was actually listening to him about not having any contact with Jason (though Jason couldn't grasp that order, because Jason Todd didn't take orders well - ever ). But when a few seconds of silence passed, his eyes immediately went downward, to hear muffled curses (from Jason), and soon after he saw that he was climbing out the window and shutting it with one hell of an angry smack against the wood. In seconds Jason was back up next to Dick, and he kept saying, \"dammit, dammit, dammit,\" while Dick thought, his eyes narrowed. He sighed, and his shoulders slumped. God damn it. Jason had been right. She should have been back now. There was nowhere else she would have, or could have gone - Dick was sure of that. \"She's gone,\" Jason snapped, making Dick turn around. Not because Jason had spoke (ignoring him seemed best right now because all Jason was doing was getting himself riled up when he actually needed to be rational for Drew's sake so they could find her, give her a good shake because maybe she really couldn't take care of herself , so they could think clearly), but because of the vehemence in his tone. \"Dick, you know someone made it so she's gone. And when I find whoever did this, I'm going to give him a nice, slow death so he can remember - \" Dick's lips thinned out into a line of irritation, hearing the promise in his brother's voice that made him wish that he could actually hatch up a plan without wanting to kill somebody these days . They couldn't know for sure that a some one had made her so that she hadn't shown up at her apartment - it could have been anything. They were in Gotham. Dick tuned back in to the end of Jason's rant and all he heard was before an tense silence settled between them, \" - and when this is all over, someone is going to get blown up. Do you hear me, Dick?\" Well, if that didn't indicate that shit was going to go down soon, Dick didn't know what was. The tense silence began to stretch between them, and Dick - as his brother, as the ex-Boy Wonder, and as Nightwing - knew that if he didn't offer up any suggestions soon, Jason would make good on his threat. He'd probably make a hell of a lot more people suffer than the actual number of people that needed to be dealt with (probably not by Jason, because Jason showed no mercy when he was this pissed ). So Dick broke the silence with a heavy sigh and said, \"You can't kill anyone without knowing who to kill.\" \"Yeah? Would you know about it?\" Dick snorted. \"Quite a bit. You know, just because I fight for the good guys doesn't mean I don't know how to deal with bad guys when they need to be dealt with. We have no idea if someone actually did something to her. We have no idea if she just decided not to come home - \" \"That's bullshit, Dicky,\" Jason's voice was low - it held a solid warning in it. \"She's smart enough to go straight home. She would not be that stupid.\" Jason was clearly not messing around in this mess (yes, Dick could already tell this would be a fantastic mess - and he was probably going to be the one cleaning it up, if it turned into an even bigger mess than he was expecting it to become - because he knew things from here on out weren't going to simple. Oh, no - they were not .). (If the situation hadn't been so concerning, the older of the two would have made a quip about Jason's true feelings - that he actually did still care for Drew, even if it was only because the two had been friends for the majority of the older end of her childhood - because people who did not care about people in charge did not threaten to decorate an entire mall plaza with body parts if whoever had done anything to anybody that he gave a damn about had a hair on their head touched in any undesired fashion. But he kept quiet, even though he knew he was right. Jason might not even see her as a friend - just something from his past, that he'd held dear, once upon a time - at the moment, but the fact still remained that she still called him her best friend, and since Jason hadn't had many friends, that had meant a great deal - a great deal that wouldn't stop him from getting revenge on whomever or whatever had made the girl, who he was denying caring for while his actions said differently, disappear when she knew to come straight home after something like the chase Jason had put her through.) \"Then what do you think happened?\" Dick snapped. \"Do you think she got lost?\" \"She's lived here her entire life. She knows her way around the city...\" Jason trailed off, and Dick suddenly groaned. He finished his sentence for him. \"... when she's looking at the street signs.\" \"God dammit ,\" Jason swore again, his fists clenching, and then unclenching. He repeated this act as his chest moved up and down, sharply, as if he was trying to calm himself down. Well, that was a first. (Dick almost snarked about that. Almost . But, right now, he wanted to live, and saying that might get him killed. And, yes - he had no doubt in his mind that Jason would try to kill him if he even uttered something like that at the moment.) \"She could be anywhere ,\" Jason muttered, turning away from Dick, and his brother knew that his eyes were sweeping the endless sea of rooftops in vain (maybe hoping to catch a glimpse of her up there, near the skyline, but he knew that Jason knew finding her wouldn't be that easy.) before turning back to face Dick. \"Since you keep telling me what I can't and can do, tell me what we're going to do first.\" Dick shrugged. \"That's easy. We're going to ask Barbara to help us.\" Jason guffawed, his head turning sharply to face Dick fully. \" Her ? Drew doesn't have anything that she can track her with on her. And why would she want to help me ?\" Dick frowned, sighed, and shook his head. \"Because I'm going to ask her - and I think she's staying with the commissioner right now, for the time being - for a visit, I think. And besides, she would help you if you were actually pleasant be around but since that's impossible for you to do, I'm going to ask you nicely that you stay away from the building and let me visit and ask for a favor.\" Jason snorted. \"You think I'm not gonna let her know how urgent this is? I didn't think she even liked Drew in the first place - \" \" - I don't even think they've met , you idiot - \" \" - and I am coming with you, Dick. Like it or not.\" This time, Dick couldn't resist making a comment: \"See - see , this is proof that you still view Drew as something .\" \"I don't . She's acting like a bitch, happy to see me, now she's not - she's running from me now - \" \"Dammit, Jason, do you want her to hate you? Because if she hears you saying this kind of crap around her, she's not going to be grateful about anything - if she needs finding, and if she needs saving! And it would be easier if - \" \"I'm going to Barbara with you.\" They both glared at each other. The tension was thick between them, and it wasn't quite broken when Dick turned away, his eyes scanning the horizon as he struggled, for a moment, to remember where Commissioner Gordon lived. After a moment, he chose a direction, and in seconds Jason was at his side (and then the tension was back to being so thick, Jason would've had trouble cutting it with his Batman-cutting-lines-and-wires knives). \"Do me one thing, since we're technically brothers,\" Dick hissed as they vaulted over the side of another parking garage and onto the wooden ceiling of an older (probably abandoned) building. \"Yeah?\" Jason asked, his tone a little less bitter, but still agitated. \" Do not piss her off .\" \"I'm making you no promises on that one, Dicky.\"[Chapter 18] I know I updated this story this morning... but... I HAD TO OKAY. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE LAST PART OF THIS CHAPTER AND YOU WILL SEE THAT THE ENDING IS NOT AS LAME AS IT SOUNDS. \"Remind me again: why the hell did Barbara agree to meet us at the house when we could have just dropped on by below at Gordon's place? Didn't you tell her that this is important? Urgent? Dammit .\" Dick sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose with his fingers in frustration. The two of them were standing on the roof of the apartment complex that was currently housing Gordon and, temporarily, his daughter. Dick had just put away his communicator after a few minutes of exchanging muttered words (because Jason wasn't nice enough not to eavesdrop on the two of them) and was now facing Jason, who had his arms crossed over his chest, and, there was no doubt in the older man's mind that he was positively scowling under that red hood of his. \"She said that she would get there as fast as she can,\" he said, giving Jason a look that told him that he should be grateful that Babs had even considered helping the two of them (Dick had been right) track down someone she'd never even met before. A snort was a reply to this, and Dick glared at him. \"Don't mock her. You know she's the best, closest person we can find that will actually help us find Drew. And since this is you who's also involved in this, I would say that being at the house at dawn is reasonable.\" \"But it's almost light out - \" \" - that's what meeting at dawn at the manor means, Jason - \" \"Drew could be dead!\" ( Really . Like he didn't know that already.) Dick groaned. \"You really don't think she didn't consider that as soon as I said we need help finding someone ?\" Jason said nothing. \"I'm sure she's not dead, okay? Barbara's going to help us - she'll be there in half an hour, and that means we should get on over to meet her in the Bat Cave, where Bruce's computer is - \" \"Look, can we just get going?\" Jason snapped. \"What do you think Bruce will say when he sees you in the Cave, Jason?\" Dick asked with eyes narrowed and jaw clenched. Something bad had definitely happened if Barbara had agreed to help them. Barbara was good at guessing things - accurately - and if she figured they needed her help, then something bad had to have happened - because she probably knew that if it wasn't urgent, they probably could have scoured the city themselves (Jason, though, on the way here, had voice his opinion concerning involving Gotham's police department when Dick had suggested that he , not the Red Hood, ask for help - Jason didn't trust them, and it seemed that he wasn't about to put the fate of his once-upon-a-time best friend in the hands of a (somewhat, but not totally) corrupt justice system. \"Well, let's just hope he doesn't see me,\" he sneered in reply. He turned away from Dick, and started towards their old home ( Bruce's home), with Dick right behind him as they began doing the same thing they'd done before they'd arrived (before calling Babs). On their way to Barbara's, they had also made sure to scour the alleys and streets around them as they'd ran as fast as they could (which really wasn't all that hard, especially since there was two of them), but they had found nothing to indicate the well being or non-well being of Drew - and that had put Jason, remarkably, even more on edge Dick knew that Jason doubted that Barbara would even lift a finger to help him - but what he knew that Jason obviously didn't was that he was still like family to her. After all, she'd known him for nearly as long as Dick had - and only Bruce had known Jason longer than Dick. Barbara, though, had been cautious. He'd woken her up, after she'd fallen asleep once she'd finished hacking into some criminal mastermind's bank accounts to see if he really was taking charity money from the public somewhere in Florida. And for someone who hated being woken up, after only an hour of sleep, when they hadn't gotten one wink of sleep in over twenty-four hours - well, he had to admit that she'd been very cooperative, especially when he had mentioned that the person they needed help tracking down was (a) someone who seemed subconsciously keen on getting into trouble, or, who had at least seemed to do so once she'd found at that her childhood friend was back from the dead, and (b) someone that Jason actually gave a damn about , who wasn't immediate family (because, whether he liked it or not, Bruce had still raised him, and Dick was still his brother - and Barbara was still family, no matter what Jason thought). Barbara had mentioned, before hanging up, that she would like to meet this never-aforementioned Drew Isely. It wouldn't surprise him if that had been one of the only real reasons she'd agreed to help find Drew in the first place - because Barbara was busy nowadays, and maybe the two would get along if Drew was, in fact, in need of getting tracked down by one of the world's best hackers (who had also been Batgirl, so that was an automatic win right there). But she probably would be grumpy (because everyone - even superheroes - got cranky when they were denied sleep for too long a time) when they met up with her at the Bat Cave, and that really wouldn't surprise Dick at all - so all he had to do was make sure Jason didn't start an argument with her over anything , because she was also doing this to help Jason - not just because Dick had asked. Not just because it was about some innocent (well, if you didn't count the whole setting-a-building-on-fire thing) woman who happened to have been taken care of by the wrong people (probably, but he thought that she could have done a lot worse, when it came to staying with certain families for the remainder of her childhood). Dick suppressed a sigh as they got closer and closer. This whole thing probably wasn't even going to end well. Since when did these kinds of fantastic messes ever end well ? Barbara sat with her arms folded across her chest, her eyes glued to the huge screen, with Dick standing a ways behind her (he'd had to move the chair before Barbara found something with a remote control to blow it up - when she got grumpy, due to being waken up before she'd managed to catch about three hours' worth of sleep - because she'd gotten a whole lot less as Batgirl - she didn't really like moving things around) while Jason stood next to her on her right. His helmet was tucked under his arm, and his domino mask had been tucked away in a pocket (he had grown up here, after all). Upon arrival, Barbara had reminded him that she knew exactly who he was and had practically forced the helmet off his head while Dick had smirked, simply holding his own mask in his hand as his eyes landed on the screen in front of them. Bruce hadn't returned from patrol yet, but Alfred had alerted him (despite Jason's protests) to the visitors in the Cave, and since they were still there, he figured Bruce hadn't kicked them out (yet, because Jason probably would say something that would have him back outside, cursing, and on his way towards one of his many safe-houses (apartments), where he'd either sleep the day away or half of it pacing and making a mental list of every bad thing that could have happened to Drew. \"Look,\" Barbara said, after a yawn and a cat-like stretch, her arms out of the air and back down as she typed furiously, her eyes no longer letting Dick and Jason know that they existed. \"See, isn't that the street you found her on? And this is where the two of you stopped?\" There was a map in the center of the scream with lines and boxes and rectangles that indicated a section of Gotham that Dick really didn't want to visit again any time soon. \"Yeah,\" Jason said slowly. \"Well,\" she said, clacking away noisily, \"here's some footage from nearby security footage - of traffic lights and some street corners for some crazy shopkeepers.\" The map was minimized in the corner of the screen, and a window popped up. Despite the dark, the street lamps helped with seeing Drew squeeze herself out of the alley (looking exhausted and vexed and more than bit mentally worn out) and tore down the sidewalk. Dick was amazed that the woman's adrenaline was still pumping madly through her body, as if she had all the energy in the world, though it was evident that Barbara could see (the expression on her face was grim) that she wouldn't last much longer. \"I can follow her movements - according to the traffic cams,\" she said, and she was suddenly pulling up another window. But this time, there was a close-up of Drew, and there was her personal information. It was her public (and sort of non-public) file. Here eyes scanned the notes in the document (Dick didn't really know why she needed to look in there, but he said nothing about it) quickly before minimizing that one to, and she pulled up another window of another traffic cam as Drew rounded a corner. It didn't take a genius to know that Drew was running without a destination in mind. All she seemed to care about was running away , but then, suddenly, without warning, she cut through a side alley - disappearing from site. \" Shit ,\" Barbara swore under her breath, her fingers clacking on the keys again as she pulled up another few windows - of camera footage, from only about an hour or two before now - and they managed to catch her going down another street (a dead end one), and they watched intently as she cut into yet another side alley. \"Are you sure she doesn't have a cell phone?\" Barbara asked, more windows of camera feeds from traffic cams popping up all over the screen - but none of them showed Drew. She had been lagging a bit - her adrenaline had obviously been running low, and now there was no telling where she was, no matter how much Barbara's eyes scanned the streets and sidewalks and shadows and no matter how much Jason's eyes scoured the crowds on the more populated (safe) streets that was near where they had last caught a glimpse of the young woman. \"Anything I can track her with?\" when neither of the men answered, she huffed out a breath of irritation (because usually this sort of thing was so damn easy ) I'm not much help without something on her person that's trackable - \" \" There !\" Jason leaned forward and pointed at a camera that pointed at a train-station entrance, underground. The crowds of people going in and out of the tunnels, up and down the concrete stairs, were even thick (maybe even thick er ) during the night - but, somehow, Jason had caught side of her figure (or her hair, or her clothes, or whatever the hell he'd seen that had indicated that he had actually seen her). Barbara's eyes locked onto the figure he'd pointed out, and, sure enough, the young woman had looked over her shoulder before heading down the stairs (she'd slowed her pace to a stumble that made her look like she was a bit drunk - but no one paid her any mind at all), looking strung out (paranoid, was the word Barbara would have used, but she said nothing, and only hacked into the few, mostly unhelpful cameras down in the systems (mostly grainy, black and white footage was what anyone ever got out of those security tapes, because no one really cared to use them, because this was Gotham and in Gotham you needed reliable things - not ancient ones) and the screen was filled with grainy footage. Barbara's heart sank, though her expression (for the most part) was stoic as she watched Drew stumble onto the train, after a small group of women, and after her was a few men in business suits. She heard Jason swore, and a sigh from Dick somewhere beside her now, probably next to Jason. Barbara sighed, leaning back in her seat. She couldn't stop the train (Bruce had told her not to do anything like that unless lots of people were going to die, and since it was evident that Drew was alive, she couldn't very well do that - even though she was willing to if that meant Dick could make an appearance as Nightwing, get her off the train, and somewhere safe. But the doors to the underground train closed, and Jason swore again as it began to move on the tracks. Barbara turned towards the two men, and she looked rather apologetic for someone who didn't even personally know Drew Isely. \"None of her info tells me anything useful - she really doesn't have anything trackable on her and her info doesn't tell me where she might or might not go - only her apartment, which this train is not taking her towards.\" Dick sighed again, a bit more heavily this time, but Barbara cut him off as soon as he opened his mouth. \"But, if you want, I can stay here, track the train - I can see where it's stops are at, and watch the footage at the other stations from here, at the Cave, and let you know when I see her.\" Jason raised an eyebrow. \"I gotta go. It's light out. How are you - \" \" Jason , I'm surprised to remember that you're still even a part of our family,\" she joked (halfheartedly) and turned to Dick. \"Since you can walk , and I'm going to be sitting here for the next several hours, probably, you need to get us three communicators and put us on the same, private channel. You can keep them on her persons at all time, but you can go home now - get some sleep. I'm gonna get some, too. But,\" she said, holding up a hand, halting Jason's protests when he opened his mouth to object to her getting rested in order to find the very person he claimed not to care about in the slightest, \"I will adjust the computer's settings so it notifies me if it the train stops at any time , scheduled or not.\" Dick gave her a grin that didn't reach his eyes. \"I owe you one - big.\" Barbara merely gave him a flirtatious grin in return, but it disappeared as a coy smile took over her lips instead, and she turned to Jason. \"No, he'll owe me one because this is his girlfriend we have to deal with.\" Jason responded to that remark immediately, scowling down at her, crossing his arms over his chest as Dick left his side to grab and set up the communicators like Barbara had asked him to. \"She's not my girlfriend.\" Barbara's coy smile only turned into a smirk as she raised an eyebrow. \"Then what is she, exactly?\" Jason's lips formed into a thin line. \"If I remember correctly, you two were best buddies before you - \" the smile vanished for a moment, as she cleared her throat, and Jason had to finish her sentence for her in order to for her to be able to tease him more. \"Before I died. Yeah. Got it. And yeah. We were .\" \"And what is she now?\" \"Just somebody.\" \"A somebody who still sees him as her best friend,\" Dick chimed in (sounding disturbingly cheerful, which made Barbara's smile come back),coming back over to the two of them and handing them their communicators (tiny little things that fit snugly in their ears). Barbara put hers, watching as Dick and Jason did the same. \"She's an idiot for seeing me like that.\" Not a second after the insult had been uttered from his lips Dick had delivered a solid punch to his shoulder, and it made Jason flinch and stumble a bit into the computer bay. \"Ow, god dammit Dick, what was that for?!\" \"If you keep saying shit like that, she's not going to be so happy that you're trying to save her,\" Barbara said, and then her smile turned cheeky. \"Well done, Dick. Now both of you - get some rest. I need to set the alarms on this computer, so I can get some sleep, too.\" Dick turned with a wave, and then, silently, he left Jason and Barbara alone. Jason turned to leave as well, his hand going to the pocket where he'd stuffed the domino mask in, but Barbara's hand shot out and grabbed his wrist. \"Jason,\" she warned, and he looked over his shoulder to scoff at her. \"Don't, Barb - \" \"Jay, I'm warning you! If she - \" \"Don't .\" Jason was now frowning as he slipped on the mask, and then the helmet. Without another word, he left Barbara by herself, to glare after him. After a few seconds of staring at the exit to the Cave, she sighed, and turned back to the screen, her eyelids suddenly growing heavy as her hands flew over the keys, setting up the notification system so she could get some sleep. She hoped nightmares plagued Jason's resting period - and maybe then he wouldn't be such an asshole. But maybe that didn't need to happen - maybe she could just get Dick to punch him again, to set his head straight. Yeah, that might work. Maybe. Probably not. Okay, definitely not. Meanwhile... Drew was slumped over in her seat, her forehead resting on her knees as she breathed in, and out, in and out, her arms wrapped around her thighs while her body continued shaking slightly from the hell she'd just put it through. The train rattled on towards its next destination, and the buzz of activity around her faded as she focused on getting her breathing back to normal, so she didn't start hyperventilating or anything. The last thing she needed was for her to end up in the hospital. What she needed was to get home (she had no idea where she was going, and frankly, she couldn't find it in her to honestly give a damn, as long as no one was chasing her or anything, because she was getting pretty sick and tired of running and running and running from people, she would be find. First off, though, she needed to change clothes, and she probably needed sleep - lots and lots and lots of sleep - and - \"Are you alright?\" Drew didn't look up at whoever had spoken to her. She ignored them, in favor of thinking breathe in, breathe out - slow, steady breaths but then the person next (were they?) to her tapped her on the shoulder, and repeated their question. Their tap was more like a sharp jab or poke, and she grunted. (Going around poking people was for children - didn't anyone ever know that anymore?) Drew groaned, and muttered a \"get the hell away from me\", not lifting her head (which felt a thousand times heavier than normal), and she felt the presence (next to her?) move away, and she breathed out through her nose a sigh of relief. Blinking slowly, Drew turned her head a fraction to see who else shared her train car. To her shock, few others were in it - and none of them were by her. She looked around, trying to suddenly remember if it had been a man or a woman speaking - but her eyelids were getting heavy, and she couldn't really remember. Her eyelids sank downwards, but she had the feeling that she shouldn't be sleeping on the train. Something bad might happen and - Drew was unable to form any coherent thoughts as her eyes shut, and she stifled a yawn by turning her face into her lap. With some effort (and with little strength she had left), she used her arms to lift her legs (which felt like noodles but felt like they had lead weights attached) onto the seat next to her. Sliding down so she was now lying across four or give seats, the world and its noises seemed muffled as she lost the ability to keep her eyes open - - and she passed out, without so much as a second thought as to why she suddenly just couldn't stay conscious.[Chapter 19] The last chapter was kind of meh to write :3 did you guys think so (well, not writing - reading it, I guess)? I felt so evil doing what I did. I felt like the \"meanwhile\" part was meh but WAIT WHAT AM I SAYING you'll find out later. Thank you so much for reading :) When Drew opened her eyes, the first thing that hit her was the aching in her neck. She was staring at the padding of a seat - but where was she - Jerking upright, she looked around wildly, feeling disconcerted and out of sorts. She was on the train, and she was alone in the car, and she had no clue what she had been doing in the first place to land her here - Oh . Last night's events came tumbling back to her, her mind suddenly full with memory of what she'd done, what Jason had done - and Dick saving her sorry ass, of course - that too, and suddenly a headache seemed to pop up behind her eyes and settle inside her skull. She was such and idiot. Groaning to herself, she looked out the window, to see that the train was slowing down. How long had she been on the train? And why the hell had she fallen asleep in the first place? Her body was sore, and aching (she'd only fallen asleep on the train once before, and she hadn't been able to twist her neck right or left properly for a week) - and she knew that she'd been exhausted from the chase last night. In fact, she knew she'd pushed herself (well, her body, more like - her mind was just telling her to keep moving till she was home) in her efforts to get away from Jason. And she also knew she was going to be paying for it today. Probably for a few days, because her legs were already shaky, even though she hadn't even set them on the ground yet. Craning her neck to see if anyone else was in the car ahead of hers, her eyes narrowed when she saw that that car, too, was empty. Just what time was it? Had something happened? Why hadn't she - Her thoughts were cut short as she felt the train come to a stop. A bit too quickly, she slung her legs off of the seats she'd slept on (though she knew she was never this groggy when she woke up, which made her think that she could have passed out) and with a thud they fell to onto the floor. She stood, slowly, carefully, and nearly fell over when a spike of dizziness struck her like the headache had. Swearing profusely under her breath, she made her way towards the doors, and stepped out onto the concrete while a crowd of people barreled past her, into the car she had just vacated (there was, strangely, very few other people getting off the train), one of them slamming into her shoulder (probably in a rush) and sending her to the ground - though it didn't take much; her walking was more like drunkenly stumbling about. Her body ached as she gingerly sat up. A few people glanced down their noses at her as they walked by while she slowly - and unsteadily - got to her feet, looking around. Her head hurt like hell and the room spun a little, but her head was clearing. Slowly. Slower than usual. There was definitely something wrong with her. She knew that much. She didn't remember her head getting hit, or hitting her head, or any sort of trauma, unless running for one's life suddenly caused headaches, grogginess, and dizziness. And she was sure as hell that didn't happen after one had been running . Shaking her head slowly, she started towards the exit to the train tunnels, the stairs a welcoming sight - but the rain coming down them, dampening the concrete of the ground, was not . Groaning again, Drew grabbed the railing as soon as she was near (people were probably looking at her like she was a drunk; well, she couldn't blame them - she was acting - and she felt - like she had one hell of a hangover, but she wasn't nauseated, and she wasn't stuck in a bathroom stall somewhere - so that meant no hangover. Not a hangover. Not head trauma. Not exhaustion (though everything hurt like hell). No - no nothing . Nothing to explain it. And was it , anyways? Drew sighed and immediately backed down a few steps once the sheets of icy rain met her (now once-upon-a-time-dry) body. Shivering, she swore under her breath, peering up into the rain. She didn't recognize the upper halves of the buildings she could see from where she was hunched over the railing (still getting looks from passers-by). Swallowing, she forced herself to trudge forward, and immediately regretted it. Stepping onto the (thankfully flat) sidewalk, she looked around. Yeah, she definitely hadn't been around this part of Gotham - ever . The buildings were much like the ones that were around her workplace - except, these were - well, these were much... taller... and shinier... and, well, grander . She remembered why she'd never bothered even going anywhere near this place. Now she knew why everyone had been giving her certain, hoity-toity looks. Compared to the well-dressed men and woman in professional business attire, she probably looked like a half-drowned... or half-dead... a half-something something . Drew raised a hand to her head and scowled to feel that her head had been reduced to a place-holder for sea-weed-looking hair (she didn't really like it all wet and stringy and annoying and in her face). Looking down at herself, she frowned. The clothes she was wearing were rumpled, wrinkled, and none too clean for her liking. In fact, a shower and a new change of clothes sounded like the best thing in the world. First, she just had to find her way home. After about an hour of wandering around this fancy-schmancy-everyone-seems-like-they-have-a-sti ck-up-their-ass part of town, Drew had to admit that she was lost. Again . Dammit. And the more she wandered, the more and more she felt like she wasn't going to find anything familiar. Drew was hungry. And tired. And achy. She hated being achy. Also, not having any money on her was also giving her a bad mood. So she was now grumpy, too. Really grouchy. She'd even thought about burning down a few buildings around here - the people were so snotty and uncaring for one another. Her eyes, though, did not lie to her mind - about how much she liked the towers of glass being berated and beaten by the heavy sheets of rain - which had her thoroughly soaked and chilled (though she might have expected snow, because it was getting closer and closer to December) to the bone. Eventually, her eyes fell on a building that towered over her like everything else did. The W on the front of it made her eyes narrow, and she didn't have to even guess for what that stood for. And she didn't even have to try to dissuade herself from walking right past Bruce Wayne's building. She would deal with no Waynes, no Graysons, and certainly no Todds today. As long as she had a say in - well, whatever the hell was happening around Gotham. Around her. Sort of. Maybe. Drew shook her head. It had been a while, since she'd woken up on the train, and she was surprised to find that the headache was still present. She never woke up with headaches. Never. She halted, about to cross a street with a busy crowd, and she turned her head to look at the front entrance of Bruce's building. She watched carefully as men and women trickled in and out of the building, and was about to step forward onto the crosswalk when she saw a familiar face exiting the building, and quickly turned her back on the building and jogged to catch up the last of the crowd stepping onto the sidewalk across from the one she'd just been on. She did not want to see Bruce, or talk to Bruce - or have anything to do with the man. And surely, if he saw her, he'd ask questions - or something. Because he was Batman (she hated why everything about the damn man made sense now). Looking around, she realized that maybe stealing another cell phone (or at least borrowing one) might be necessary in order to get someone to get her home... But then she stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, nearly bumping into someone. And nearly started slapping herself for being so stupid . Drew had no one to call. Dick was out of the question. So was Bruce. And so was - well, that was all she had. Well, maybe a map - \"Are you lost?\" Drew snapped out of her thoughts and whirled around to see a man smiling at her. She'd never even seen the man in her life before - Oh - Now wait a damn second . It took her a moment to recognize the man, and when she did, her eyes went wide. \"... what in the hell are you doing here?\"[Chapter 20] A/N: *shows up 3 years late with starbucks* so what did I miss ****PLEASE READ THIS, CONCERNS PERSONAL INFO & FIC UPDATES**** Hello, everyone! I am just as awful and embarrassing I was when I left here. Also, I can't seem to keep my promises. Namely, I couldn't stay away, and I'd like to take a moment to say some things, and I hope you read through this instead of closing your browser window or skipping to the chapter part. I'm really sorry guys, for leaving, for abandoning fics, but I got stuff to say. Pleas bear with me. I know it's long, but it's important. I wasn't going to come back. I really thought I wasn't. But I used the yahoo email I keep for this account for another site, and I looked at the inbox, and I choked up. I was shocked to see that you guys were still here, still checking my work, still waiting. After so long. And then I saw a review written by a guest. It is a very long, emotional review which nearly brought me to tears. The anonymous user basically said a lot of stuff about how, like Drew, I'm not someone who gives up. News flash: I am a self-certified quitter. But you, guest, have motivated me. You have inspired me. You made me think, 'yeah, maybe I can do that.' I think I owe you guys this, another chapter, maybe a suitable end to a fic somewhere down the line which (surprise) I never outlined or planned for to begin with. (Never have I ever planned or outlined anything fictional in my entire life. That would be called planning. I am not a planner. I am impulsive to the max.) I want to finish at least one story for you. Just one. I am now seventeen years old and am going into my senior year of high school next month. (Scared to death of it, to be quite honest with you.) I started writing here when I was thirteen in the eighth grade after seeing Jeremy Renner in the Bourne films. My writing style, mindset, and attitude have changed drastically since I was thirteen and fourteen. But you guys deserve, at the very least, this much. I've gone through a lot in the last two years (junior year sucked! i thought sophomore year would be the worst but no! it mcfreaking sucked! junior year was awful and I hate it and I want to punch chemistry in the face!) but it's summertime now, and it's possible I can manage something for you before graduating. I don't necessarily have any official plans for after high school since getting through my senior year is my main concern right now. And I don't have a life. That still hasn't changed. So it won't be all that difficult for me to keep up with this if you guys want me to go this route. Although I don't write here anymore, I'm elsewhere, still writing fics, still crying over fictional characters. I've even found internet friends to cry with. It's fun. I still can't forge this fic, though, no matter how hard I try. It's impossible. I hate that that's the way it is, but that's partly the reason I'm here. I get it if you're angry, if you're upset with me for abandoning this fic. I get it if you don't care anymore or don't want to read. You're within your right to do so. Please, feel free to PM me. Say hi. Re-introduce yourself. Yell. Throw stuff at me if you want through the screen into my inbox, but please think of being kind. It's been a rough year for me. Do what you want, I can't very well stop you. But I'm going to be blunt with you: if you guys want more chapters, then I'll need feedback. If there isn't any, then this won't be updated. (What's the point of it if no one is going to read it? That's why fic writers post online , for strangers to read.) It might sound awful of me, or egotistical, or selfish, but that's not my angle, and I'm not asking for much. I'm not asking for an essay (long comments are either spam or they make me weep with joy. the former is more common, sadly). I just wan to know your thoughts, your feelings. A smiley face, a 'where were you?!,' or a 'FINALLY' will do just fine. But this is ultimately for you . You, the readers, who have done so much for me even if you don't know it or you don't think I know it. I wouldn't be the writer or person I am today without you all. You guys were my first real positive (and negative) experience on the internet. I learned how to write here. I love you guys. I do. Even if I've been absent, or I grew bitter and resentful for feeling like I was pressured to write during the end of my original run on this profile (which I did) (which I don't anymore) I mean that, and I want to do this for you. All I'm asking for is a little bit of your time. Just a couple reviews, three or four would make me dance with joy. It would mean to world to me, and, as much as it pains me to admit it, nearly all the fanfiction writers I know and have spoken to agree that your response, your reviews, and your passion is what motivates us. It's what makes us write on. It makes us want to write. And I'm not saying I'm new and or improved here. My writing, while changed, hasn't become magical, or even, uh, good. Maybe better, though. I might ignore some grammar rules. I might miss typos here and there. But I'll try to give you the best that I can with this old material and try to work with it. Please bare with me as I write this. Reading this after a long time of not being here...it makes my writing look super archaic/childish. (Rereading this was painful.) I don't want to change the tone too much, but I want to give you something worthy of your time. I'll be back before next week is up, hopefully, and we will see where this goes if it goes anywhere at all. If you want to yell at me, say hi, ask questions, or, you know, yell, please feel free to PM me. I'm serious. Just go right on and barge into my inbox. I dare you. And thank you, everyone. You guys are why I write. BTW: I tried to make this chapter long. Kind of a filler, but it's better than what I would have come up for you guys last year or two years ago, believe me. And I'm trying to...fix some stuff I found in earlier chapters, and this is also for you to get used to the newer style. If you're still here, that is. You guys deserved something more than 1k. (And this is 3k+) It would have been a cheap shot to upload and give you a chapter that was shorter than the damn author's note. Well, I think that's all for now. With love, - J It was possible that there was something wrong with Drew Isley in that moment. Because it was not a man who had spoken her name, or was standing before her, but a woman, a woman she immediately recognized. Her heart gave a thump and distant memories from a painful childhood stirred deep within her, making her chest constrict, making it hard to breathe for just a moment. The reason why she'd thought it was a man was because of a peculiar smell, one that reminded her of neighbors she'd known before a life with Robin in it, neighbors which smelled of chemicals and came home at odd hours and often set off the fire alarms in their homes due to their experiments. Young, ambitious men they'd been, and she had to squint and force herself to focus to really see who was standing in front of her. Anything she was about to say dried up and withered to dust in her mouth. Some part of her mind was buzzing, a white noise machine, and another, more doubtful, wishful part of her was making note of the fact that she didn't belong in a place this shiny with all these new buildings and glimmering glass towers. What she'd felt on the train was beginning to feel familiar. Dimly, it occurred to her that she had been acting erratically and irrationally for what felt like the last several months. But the only thing she could ask herself was how come it's taken me until now to realize what's been going on ? It felt like coming out of a dream, some sort of haze. A grief-stricken, emotionally suffocating haze where there was no crying allowed, but a haze all the same. Screw that , she thought sluggishly. Who even cares anyway ? But she could feel her strength draining already. Was this real? She didn't know. She didn't much care, either. And who would care? She was looking at someone whom she'd completely forgotten since her adolescent years. In that moment, she remembered herself saying, crying doesn't solve anything , but right now she thought it might make her feel better. Or maybe she'd fall apart. Who could know? Not her. She decided she didn't care. With a start, she realized she did that too much: not caring. Being brave. Being impulsive. Burying her fear and her nervousness in false bravado that did not come from a brave place within her. It was too much, she thought, it reminded her of her first life, the one before the Wayne family. Before Robin. Before Jason. Before she'd known what it was to laugh and be free to laugh. It took her a few blinks and seconds to realize that the person was trying to talk to her. She suddenly felt tired. How long had it been since she'd slept? Had she slept too much? Not at all? Maybe the loneliness was getting to her. Maybe she was going crazy. Maybe this all too much to deal with. She didn't know. \"Pamela,\" she breathed, finally, and it felt like exhaling after holding her breath for years and years and years. The redheaded woman saw the flicker of recognition in the younger woman's face and smiled, radiant like a golden day on a hillside not known to Gotham or its people. Before she could formulate a proper greeting, or apology, Pamela was pulling her into her arms, and Drew suddenly felt angry at the pang she felt in her chest. Angry was how she dealt with things, wasn't it? But then Pamela wasn't what she was angry at, and, in all honesty, she had missed Pamela. More than she had cared to remember, evidently. Pamela reached for her, green nails glinting, ride hair shining, and linked their arms. \"Drew,\" she said, \"I think it's been far too long since you and I last talked.\" \"Yeah,\" Drew said. Before she lost the nerve, she blurted, \"I missed you.\" \"I noticed.\" Drew's brow furrowed. \"You took my last name, didn't you?\" and she laughed. I did , she thought, I did because you were one of the only people in my life who made me truly happy. You were my favorite person when I was a little girl . But she said none of this, and did not return Pamela's hug. The older woman didn't seem bothered; she only pulled away. Then she glanced at her watch. Drew noted that she was in a dark business suit, accented in browns and green. Pamela Isely was a vision, she thought. Pamela also always reminded her of a garden. And she always felt like she'd seen the doctor somewhere, maybe on television, but what did she know? She felt like she'd spent years underwater, drowning. \"I have to go,\" Pamela said mournfully, \"but I'll find you again, won't I?\" Drew nodded. Pamela had visited her old school once, the one before the Wayne family had taken her in. Pamela had been trying to teach the first graders about photosynthesis, and while Drew hadn't cared much for the learning, the worksheets, or the apathy of her classmates and teachers because they had their own problems at home and at work, Pamela had taken her under her wing, shown her flowers and the creep ivy. She'd given her her card and her phone number and promised that, when Drew was grown up, they would be friends someday. But then Drew had been taken in, and she'd been moved, and she'd forgotten and buried those memories, all of them, even the few good ones that were lost in the tears and the pains and the heartache. How could she be so willfully ignorant of herself all these years? She wasn't sure. \"Bye, lovely,\" Pamela leaned over and kissed her cheek, softly, kindly, like a best friend, and before Drew could open her mouth and ask her to stay because she smelled of daffodils and chemicals, she was walking off down the sidewalk. With a start, she'd realized that Pamela had been speaking long before she'd started listening. What had she said? Something about her visiting? Not looking well? The fact that her best friend had his very own headstone? Who knew? Not her. She felt like she was the only one who didn't know anything at all. Guilt flashed through her, hot like a flash. What did she say ? She asked herself, attitude plummeting. What did she say to me before I started paying attention? Soon after, though, she gave up trying to remember. It was no use. The last few days—weeks, maybe—had been a blurry mess. Who knew what was even going on anymore? Not her, that was for damn sure. Drew didn't move for a very long time. She wasn't sure she remembered how, because the memories of what she'd done, of what had happened in the last few weeks, were beginning to tug at her. Before she fell over, she managed to wander off and find a bench under a tree. Her hands weren't shaking, but her whole body ached. She needed to sit down. She needed to rest, to think, to stop moving. Everything and nothing was rushing back to her, and she figured that falling down wouldn't get her anywhere. Well, maybe it would. Maybe she'd trip some yuppie from this side of town. Maybe she'd trip up some pickpocket running away with a lady's purse. Or maybe someone would call the street cleaners to pick her up off the sidewalk. Or, maybe, if she was lucky, they would just leave here there, face-down on the ground, so that she could pretend that none of what was happening had actually occurred in the first place. But she didn't fall. Instead, she clenched and unclenched her first, emotions mixing, churning, making her feel sick to her stomach, making her feel heavy and light all the same. She hated the feeling. She hated it so much that her blood boiled, froze over, and then melted all over again. Hot and cold sensations, she thought dimly, irritated her beyond belief. Why did it have to be like this? Why couldn't she just think straight? Drew realized there was so much anger in her, so many unresolved issues which had built up over the years and imploded because of her inability to deal with it head on. All the time, she wanted to fight someone. She wanted to do something with her hand because sometimes she got so unbearably angry that she reminded herself of her father. That thought alone was enough to calm her, drain her of her anger, and leave her feeling nothing but fear and the acuteness of being alone. These moments of clarity, Drew understood, came and went every few years. Her actions and their consequences, at the time, would seem medicinal. Insignificant. Not worth worrying or caring about. But she had her moments when the calm would break into pieces and from the ruins anxiety would rise up and claw at the inside of her chest, asking her why are you like this? Why do you do the things you do? You might turn out just like your father. And then she would be frozen, posture rigid, and then sometime later, the cycle would repeat itself. Anger would follow soon after. Days, weeks, months might pass before the anxious period was over, and then all she was able to know was that anger, that lack of concern, her recklessness which put her life in jeopardy. And for what? For who? Herself? Jason? Dick? Bruce? She didn't know. I acted like my father , she realized, horrified, her head in her hands. I was so angry. I was irrational. I didn't think things through . She sighed. What am I ? she asked herself. What am I doing? What am I going to do? She was so tired, she found, full of that lonely ache her old life and her dead friend had left in her. Her own faults, her recklessness, and her fears hovered under her sternum, making it difficult to breathe. She remembered Jason, chasing him down the stairs and tackling him, winning as Cleopatra when they were young. Had she been angry then? Had she been living underwater then? She wasn't certain anymore. Possibly yes, but that was doubtful. Those years were not so murky as the last few weeks, not nearly as angry. Nothing stung her like the most recent events. I don't want to be my father , she wanted to say out loud. How could she even speak to Jason, to anyone right now, when she was only just remembering what she'd done? How she'd acted? Her flaws, she realized, would end in self-destruction and catastrophe for only herself, if she was lucky, and if she was unlucky, others would be hurt too. And she didn't want to. She wasn't her father, who didn't have a lick of common sense in him. She wasn't her mother, crying and full of fear, unable to run away with her children for she was just as scared as they were. She wasn't her aunt, her cousin, or her grandmother. She was Drew, and she had her flaws, but she thought that, maybe, she could be better. If she reminded herself to calm down. If she wasn't so irrational and headstrong. But where would that get her? That automatic response of I don't care was a mechanism that was the default. There was no changing that overnight. Slowly, Drew leaned back and dragged her hand across her face, wondering about Pamela. It had been years since she'd seen her, and, if she remembered correctly, she didn't live around in this part of town. Had she moved? Gotten a job? Become a supervillain, stolen money, and started her own revolutionary self-reliant greenhouse? She laughed at that. Pamela Isley wasn't a villain, or a criminal. What she was at this point, she realized, was a stranger. A stranger. Drew found she didn't remember much. And why would she? It was all so much. When she felt a breeze dance over her face, cold and sharp, she looked around. She was utterly alone. No Batmans, no Robins, no Red Hoods, no Jokers. No best friends, no old friends, no family, no angry father. It was just her. She thought about Jason, briefly. Cursing herself, she wondered, and what do I know about him anyway? It's been five years. He used to be dead. Or something. I—I probably don't know about anything anymore . And did she? No, she though. She didn't. She knew very little and what she had decided what was true had been made in a split second and with only her own thoughts, feelings, and knowledge to go on. Why am I like this ? She asked herself. Why am I always running away, always angry, unable to do anything except what might be the right thing ? She shook herself. Out loud, she said to herself, \"why'd you have to go and burn down a building, huh? Don't you have something better to do? There are toaster ovens that need your attention. You know, a job. A living. Your source of income.\" But she could feel her poor attempts to cheer herself up or distract herself failing miserably, and so she, taking a look around, wondered, are they still looking for me ? In that bleak moment, she was acutely aware of how alone she was. Everyone else was inside or elsewhere. She looked at her hands, willing her eyelids not to droop closed, but she was so tired. So drained. So spent. Being angry, she remembered, took a lot out of her. Didn't someone call them episodes ? She leaned back, her head tilting so she could see into the branches of the tree above her, shielding her from the sky and the skyscrapers above her. Hadn't a doctor said something to her so long ago? To her parents? Had they even cared or bothered to check or get her help? She didn't know; she shook herself again, and asked herself, I hope no one minds if I just close my eyes for a bit here . Looking around, she felt something bristle at the thought. I don't care . The thought felt so angry, harsh, and sharp, like a crude knife, after this brief moment of clarity. I don't care . And because she felt angry and stubborn, and she was hurting, and tired, and she knew in that moment that things had gone horribly, horribly awry since the Red Hood's appearance in Gotham, she allowed herself to lie down, her back to the seat of the bench, curling into herself. Her hands fit under head to make a pillow, and even though she ached all over, she realized that it felt good. Before she knew it, she was dozing, and within minutes, despite the cold and the snow on the ground, she was fast asleep. When she woke up, it was nearly dark, and there was no one around in the absent of life and light but her. She yawned, stood, and stretched. How long had it been? She didn't know. Hours? Days? People slept on benches all the time. She'd done it a handful of times herself in the past. Scrubbing a hand through her hair, she winced when she found tangles. \"I need a bath,\" she said, scowling, \"and a haircut.\" When her hair got too long, it started to curl, and she could feel the weight of it all on her scalp, pulling her back down to where she'd previously been seated on the bench. I want to stay here. The thought echoed through her, but she simply lifted her chin, stuck out her tongue, because she was angry, and stubborn, and confused, and she began to walk in what she hoped was the direction out of this place and into more familiar territory. Far above her, the sky was clear and cloudless beyond the smog of the city, and even though she couldn't see it, the brightest stars winked down at her. Work . She winced at the thought. Was I supposed to go in today? She didn't know. I'll have to call in when I reach the phone and make sure I haven't lost my paycheck. Then her cheeks flushed when she recalled the office tattle tale. My 'boyfriend' excused me . Mortified, she grimaced. I'm going to have to deal with that. I really don't want to. Maybe I'm lucky and they've forgotten already? But she shook her head. Nah. Not that lucky. No one's ever that lucky. Who do I know who's lucky? She squinted, finding it hard to recall things clearly. How had her day been at the office after Jason had called her in sick? And why did she care? She didn't. She wasn't asking herself because she cared. Right ? So she shook herself out of her inquisitive stupor, knowing she'd be groggy for days, knowing that this clarity—the shame she felt for which she'd done—was a mark on he which would fade. Soon, she would stop caring, and revert back to her old self. Her normal self. What's normal about that though? She sighed. Why did things have to be this way? She didn't know. She wondered if there was anyone out there who did. Her stomach grumbled. Wincing again, she wondered, when did I eat last ? And she was about to shake herself out of that stupor, again, and tell herself it didn't matter, again, when it did. Eating is important , she remembered with a wry look on her face. You know. Kind of need it to survive and all . The urge to face-plant on the ground was beginning to grow more and more appealing as time went on. Maybe she'd do it just so people would have to go around her and waste their time. Maybe someone would step on her. Or maybe nothing would happen at all. Apple juice , that stubborn voice inside her said suddenly. We want apple juice, and we want it now . When she swallowed, she realized that her mouth and throat were dry like a sidewalk in the worst part of summertime. The man who took you in is Batman. His first son is Nightwing, former Boy Wonder. His second son is the Red Hood, formerly deceased Boy Wonder the second. God only knows what's up with Batigirl and Red Robin—and do we want? Apple juice. It was time to go home. With a grimace, she thought, time to go and face the music . And so there was nothing else she could do but walk, but she had the profound, disturbing feeling that, from somewhere in the dark alleys she passed, someone was watching her, and it wasn't someone she'd known in this life or any other. The dark came over the city swiftly, and the cold came with it, and she hurried her steps, wondering who was hiding in the shadows this time. Bring it on , she thought irritably, I'm tired of all this scurrying around . But instead of stopping and holding her ground, she just kept on walking. After all, there was nowhere to go but forward.[Chapter 21] A/N: just so you know i stared writing this chapter two (2) hours after i wrote chapter 20. i am half asleep. it is 3:07 in the morning, yikes. but i mcfeaking lost it when i got responses so quickly after...2-3 years...of not updating. i got heart eyes for you, guys. you're the best. also , what impulse control? what? who? i don't know her. i feel like i should have opened with my first update in forever with \"i bet you thought you'd seen the last of me\" and left it at that. but i didn't think of it til afterward. what a gotdang shame. - J There was definitely someone following her. Drew squinted up into the dark at the fire escape creaking in the cold air, making a face at the sight of such a rickety contraption. It was, sadly, her only escape route. Whoever it was might have thought they were too good for her tired eyes, what with them ducking in and out of sight by skirting around the spots of visibility the yellow glow that the streetlamps buzzing high above her head provided her with, but she had lived two lives, and in each one both sets of guardians had spent common moments looking over their shoulder. Her mother, she remembered, out of necessity; Bruce, she remembered, out of habit. Her temples were beginning to throb. Drew peered down the way she'd ducked into and trained her eyes on the mouth of the alley which ran perpendicular to the street. Sirens belonging to fire engines and squad cars blared from far away. Somewhere nearby, a dog howled mournfully into the night, making a shiver crawl up her sign. Despite what she'd sworn she'd seen, she felt utterly and totally alone in this place: the entire block seemed to be deserted. But why? She tried to think back, past Pamela, past Jason's reoccurrence in her life. Hadn't there been something in the news about this part of town? The new part , she thought with a curled lip, not just any old part of town . She tried to think back to a night in the office, when her coworkers had wasted over an hour of precious time with cranking up the volume that ancient, crackling box they called a television to watch the processions. She, at the time, had taken the opportunity to slip out. If they didn't do work, then neither did she, and why would she have stuck around? It wasn't like she'd been friends with any of them. It wasn't like there was anything unusual happening on that night. Maybe a month ago , she thought. Maybe less . Except there had been—something unusual. She just couldn't remember it, not with how rubbery her legs felt or how her eyelids were aching to close or how her entire body was sore or how her damaged hands stung before they could numbed by the chill the night brought on. Apple juice , she thought angrily, feeling a twitch of irritation at the fact that the silence had begun to ring in her ears. I want apple juice . And sleep. And a hot meal. Maybe both. And because she was certain that she wasn't crazy, and that there was, in fact, someone out there, she cupped her hands around her mouth, and shouted \"I know you're there!\" Her heart ached for a fight, for something to be ruined under her gaze by her hands. Horror at what she'd done had become a bleak, bog-like haze that was only lifting higher above her head. Soon it would only be a lingering regret and that burning anger, that automatic dismissal of rational decisions, that automatic giving-in to impulse that she had failed to unlearn long ago. Where is Jason? She thought to herself suddenly, feeling her heart stutter for a moment. Is he still looking for me? Does anyone know where I am? Do I even know how to get back home ? It was possible that she'd reacted badly to seeing Jason alive, that her mind was still reeling, that she was so, so afraid of the implications of his 'death' had. But, like always, she buried that fear. Answers would come later, and they would come, even if she had to swallow her pride. Even if it meant taking an approach that Dick would have praised her for—which was what she was doing right now. Which wasn't going on the offensive or turning on her heel to flee the scene. Be proud , she thought viciously, be proud of yourself. Her eyes stung for only a moment. Crying has never solved anything for anyone, now, has it? It felt like being made of molten rock and being told to remain still and not seethe, not exist at such high temperatures, not carve out a space in the ground for her own two feet to plant themselves and become steady. I'm going to break something. It had to be past midnight by now. How much time had passed, anyway? Don't tire yourself out yet , she told herself, even though her breathing was ragged already, her fingers and toes were numb, and the pile of curls on her head was weighing too heavily upon her cranium and on the back of her neck. I need a haircut , was the only thing that really stuck out at her as she blinked rapidly, willing the blurred edges of her vision to come back into focus. Save your energy . For what, though? She glanced to the left, into the puddle next to her foot, and saw a watery version of herself—bleary eyes, tangled hair, dirt smudged on her cheeks, rumpled clothes, wounded hands—glaring back at her. What was she capable of in this state? Anger was bubbling under the surface; the urge to crack her first into the brick wall next to her until her hand turned to dust was beginning to look real good about now. She found she didn't much care for the way her chest ached, for the nagging feeling at the back of her mind that told her she'd forgotten something important. Who was on the news around here? She tried to wonder, but it was to no avail. Drew shook herself, stamping her foot, and yelled, \"come out already!\" but her voice was hoarse and her throat scratched terribly. Was she getting sick? Was it from the crying? Was it because she'd done so much in so little time? Drew waited, trying to quiet her breathing, and kept her eyes on the mouth of the alley. But no one was there. No one came. So she, clenching her teeth until her jaw ached, jumped off the ground and heaved herself up the damp latter and onto the noisy platform of the fire escape with a clang. She began going up, trying to hurry up, but then she felt it move beneath her. When she looked down, she saw the shadow of a huge man coming to a halt underneath the fire escape. Shit . She made it onto the roof while her muscles strained and her body protested. It was slow going past the chimney stakes and the wisps of smoke. A few times, black spots started to dot her vision, and she had to stop and take a moment to clear her head. I'm going to hit someone , she thought. I'm so hungry. So tired. I just want time to myself. Through the haze, she tried to focus on her anger, on that slow burn inside of her which she thought threatened to configure itself into a bomb and detonate before the sun could rise again. But even the urge to hit someone, to expel the awful energy from her body, wasn't enough. Her head swam. Her body hurt. Her legs were weak and watery beneath her. She'd gone too long without sleep, and now things were taking a turn for the worse for her rash actions. Before she could act, something collided with her back, and she fell, easily losing her balance, and crashed to the ground, hands scraping the cement painfully. When she tried to pull herself up, a heavy, booted foot dug its way into her back and applied pressure until she could sense the strain on her ribs, the ugly bruise that was already forming where she was being crushed. Crushed , she thought idly, making a face. Stepped on . How many years had it been, she found herself wondering, since she'd been stepped on? A lot of years , she thought darkly, thinking of those terrifying hours in the twilight of early morning when she would fall down the stairs trying to get out of her father's way, and he would not make any sort of attempt to go around her or over her spot on the ground. Something seared the inside of her, and she felt her hands curling into tight, painful fists. I just might kill you , she thought, but she didn't have a clue as to who she might be threatening. \"All right,\" the man said, his voice gruff, applying more pressure until she thought something creak and crack inside her. Maybe it was her ribs. Maybe it was her common sense. \"You're in biiiig trouble, girlie.\" Girlie? Girlie ? She forgot her anger in favor of momentarily giving into some kind of disbelieving astonishment. But then it came back, white-hot, boiling her blood, making her eyes burn darkly in the cold, cold night. \"What the hell did you just call me? You piece of—\" but she cut off her sentence when the air was pushed from her lungs. \"You just so happen to be the very person we're looking for,\" the man went on, as if she'd never spoken, and she saw red. \"Burning down habits is a bad habit. Burning down buildings that don't belong to you, that's another thing.\" He increased the pressure still, until she was sure she was about to pass out from the lack of oxygen. But then the foot lifted and a gloved hand grabbed her roughly by her sleeve and hauled her up, up, up, until she was hanging an inch off the ground by his arm alone. Gasping for breath, she clutched at the hand that was dangerously close to her throat, listening to the fabric beginning to tear. \"And,\" the man added, giving her a good, hard shake which rattled all her bones and organs, making her feel like he'd displaced them, \"burning down buildings belonging to Black Mask was just about the dumbest thing you could have done. He would have at least thanked you had it been someone else by leaving you the hell alone.\" Her eyes widened, and the color drained from her face. Oh, shit. Shit shit shit shit shit shit— The man dropped. \"I'll let you walk, missy,\" he said, giving her the stink eye. \"But put your hands up so you know not to try anything funny.\" Drew obeyed and raised her hands above her shoulders. Her pride still smarted from the first condescension. Now it was bruised from the second. Missy? Girly? I think you could use a good punch in the face . But she knew that, if she tried anything, he'd go right back to crushing her like she was a bug at the bottom of a heel that had no time or patience for bugs. Looking around, she saw that there was no other way off this roof aside from the fire escape. On the opposite side of the building, only the unknown awaited her down in the small space between the neighboring buildings, the space in between them too far for her to jump in her current condition. Black Mask , she thought dismally, feeling her heart sink. He owns so much of this part of Gotham. Was it him on the television that night? Am I just using tonight to fill in a blank? And why do I care? It's not like he was even using that building when I— \"Get moving,\" the man said, giving her a hard shove. She caught herself before she could hit the ground again and obliged, head spinning, heart beating fast in her ears. Walking as slow as she dared, she glanced left and right. It was either the fire escape to the left, or possibly a way out on the right. Possibly death since she was high up off the ground. She didn't know. For a blind moment, the panic rose up in her and took hold of her. Its death was too tight around her heart, pulling, yanking at her heartstrings. But then she shook herself off again. Apple juice , her mind begged. Maybe some shut eye . She could hear the crackle of a radio on the man behind him. Her fists were clenched so tight her knuckles were white. I'm not dying tonight , she thought fiercely. Her decision had been made. And so Drew feinted left, towards the fire escape, hearing him lurch toward her with the sound of boots scuffing against pavement, and then darted right, barreling over the rooftop, wishing she'd had something to hit him with. Well , she thought, here goes nothing , and without hesitation, she hurled herself off the ledge into the dark.[Chapter 22] A/N: I'll admit...that cliff hanger after all that time was a little rude of me. But I couldn't resist. I actually deliberated on whether or not if it was worth going through with in case I had another case of major writer's block. Old habits die hard, I guess? At the very least, I think it should be noted that last chapter's cliffhanger was resolved much faster than chapter 19's. Ha ha. I thought about pacing myself, setting up a schedule. I think the closest thing I'm going to get to something that organized is making myself to wait to post new material on the weekend after this chapter, so. I'm already working on the next chapter. I know that if I do what I did last time, which was 'impulsively write and post as I go,' I'll get into another slump before I can figure out how this will end. And writer's block has kicked my ass enough as it is. So I'm going to try and make this work, though I won't promise you anything beyond 'I'll try.' Expect the end result to be something along the lines of 'it was a good effort.' Or something. Reviews are love. Thanks again the views & your patience. I really do appreciate it. - J \"Remember that she needs time to deal with the fact that her best friend is alive,\" Dick said. They'd been over this already. The first former Boy Wonder hadn't shut up about. \"Remember to shut your pie-hole.\" The two of them, having long since left Barbara alone, waited on the roof of Drew's apartment building. The sun would be up soon, and that would make it two nights she'd failed to come home on. The previous nights' events stuck out in Jason's memory like a sore thumb, and Dick knew it was eating at him. \" You're the one who chased her. Not me. She's the one who found out her dead best friend was Robin, came back to life, and is the Red Hood in the span of, what, two days? Three days? And what did you do? You—\" \"Drop it.\" \"She'll turn up, Jason.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Yeah,\" Dick nodded, even though didn't sound like he believed it. \"I mean, where else would she go?\" When Drew's body made contact, she heard something in her crack before she felt it. Bone . A rib, she guessed, two or three on her left side. Maybe four. Her side was going to have the ugliest, biggest bruise anyone had ever seen. Her shoulder hurt like hell. It was possible she'd narrowly avoided slicing her head open when she missed the dumpster pushed up against the wall directly below the ledge from which she'd jumped. On the way down, she'd hit the top of a white van and rolled off onto the ground. The sound of the car alarming blared loudly, announcing her presence to anyone else who might've been in the area. Something like a scream made its way passed her lips, scratching at her raw throat, tearing it to bits as she tried to clench her teeth. Someone above her—a woman, grey haired and screeching, presumably the owner of the white van—stuck her head out of a window on the second floor and shook her first. The force of her fall had probably caused a dent, judging by the way the woman's face was getting all red and puffy. All I want is time to myself. She picked herself up, seething. What kind of thug gave someone only one safe way out a situation? At most, she thought she remembered Dick saying, there should be two plausible escape routes if one was in trouble. Theoretically, anyway, and not speaking as Nightwing, but as a friend. That had been years ago, during hide and seek. She shook her head in disgust, wondering if there would come a time when something in her didn't ache, and began making her way down the alley to the other side. Behind her, on the other side of the building, she could hear the man yelling and the sound of a car engine rumbling. She quickened her steps, rounded the corner, and crept down the street, keeping to the shadows, ducking around the glow of the streetlamps. I'm going to break something just as soon as my hands heal , she thought, grimacing. She'd done a number on them by digging up a grave, by using them to break her fall, by discarding any common sense that might have saved them from the self-inflicted abuse. The bandages were filthy and in tatters; the new scrapes on the heels of her palms stung like someone had slashed them and filled the cuts with salt. The cold helped numb them, but she knew she wouldn't last long without help. But where do I go from here ? She wondered, stumbling. Who do I call? I don't even have a disposable cell phone anymore . Helpless. That wasn't an old feeling, but it wasn't welcome either. She couldn't very well shout her attacker to death, or beat him until her fingers withered down to the bare bone. Her strength was waning; the effort it took to remain inconspicuous was costing her. Where are you when I need you ? She wondered, thinking of Jason. I know I asked you a thousand times after you were gone to come back, but this is different— A crack in the sidewalk snagged the toe of her shoe, and with a cry of surprise, she went down, hard. Elbows sticking out, she winced as the impact reverberated through her sleeves and up her arms, but she was scrambling to her feet within seconds. Recovering, however, was going to be the end of her. In the end, it didn't really matter which direction she went in. If they knew her face, then who was to say they might know where she lived? Where she worked? Her family? But then her expression darkened, an ugly expression marred with a hate so deep she knew it to be the root of all dark things within her, at the thought of her family. They can choke , she thought. Bitterness seeped into her like her one too many injuries had cracked open someplace vital and now there was a leak, a pipe split open at the thinnest part. Somewhere behind her, she could hear that engine grumbling along, driving slow, looking for signs of her. Her mind raced. What would happen to her if she was caught? Death? Permanent disfiguration? A slap on the wrist? Maybe a birthday card , she thought, clamping a hand over her chapped lips to escape a bubble of hysterical laughter built on the desperation and disbelief crowding her bravado against a wall within her. Maybe he'll hire me. Maybe he'll just forget about it. Unlikely, she knew, but she could dream. Well— The sound of tires skidding drew her back to the present and she pressed her back to the wall, coming to a halt, sliding slow so she crouched behind a pile of trash on the corner as sleek, black car skirted around the corner out of nowhere and blasted down the road. The only thing she could think about in that moment was that it must have been the quietest car she'd ever heard. Wait. Drew did a double take, peering down the road as the car pulled to a stop about halfway down the block. The man who had attacked her came panting down the sidewalk and stopped in front of the car. Under the light of the streetlamp, he was red-faced and sweating, badly, but he didn't look so beat-up as she did. Out of breath, yes, but he wasn't swaying on his feet. She was painfully aware of just how dry her throat was. That isn't just any car— It was a limousine. Shit. Shit. Shit— She watched the door open. I— \"The boss isn't going to be happy with us,\" said a gruff voice, though she detected some weighted resignation within it. \"We were supposed to find her.\" Wait— \"She couldn't have run far.\" This isn't the same car I heard earlier— \"How do you know that?\" And if it isn't— \"She jumped the hell off the damn roof, is how I know.\" The man who had attacked her sounded insulted that he'd been doubted. Her pride reared its ugly head and she allowed herself to feel smug. Damn right , she thought. That's what you get for calling me 'girlie.' \"So keep looking. Remember—we can't go back without someone to pay for the damage that crazy lady did.\" If it isn't the car I heard earlier, then what did I hear earlier? Who was driving? \"It's your turn,\" the man said. She heard the faceless man in the car heave out a sight. \"She's around here somewhere, and I'll be needing a drink if I'm expected to keep looking around for that rat.\" Rat. Drew, swallowing down the urge to leap from cover and fly at them with everything she had, turned around, and snuck off. She walked for what felt like hours until she couldn't hear the sound of the men's voices, or the rumbling of an engine, or even her own thoughts. Her teeth where chattering so hard it hurt. Her fingers were numb and aching, nearly so frozen that she could barely move them to rub her arms up and down to keep warm. Where was she? She looked around, blinking, but it wouldn't be too long now before she fell over and passed out somewhere. Exhaustion was a spider creeping in that couldn't be killed. Hunger had eaten a hole through her stomach, and it felt like something was on fire somewhere between her pelvic bone and her sternum. I'm gonna be pissed if I'm dying or something . It wasn't something she would be expecting, but she certainly wouldn't rule it out, not with how her week was going. \"Hello?\" she called out, reaching blindly for something to help hold her up. What time is it? \"Hello!\" she shouted, ignoring the sting that came with hearing how ragged her voice sounded to her own ears. \"Is anyone out there? Please,\" she pushed the words out, gasping, feeling what reserves of energy she'd had left begin to slip away. \"Help me!\" No one came. The street was deserted. Any passersby she glimpsed or any cars that saw her went the other way, what with her disheveled, bloody state. And how could she blame them? She knew that if she'd taken one look at herself, she wouldn't help her, either. Drew inwardly and privately despaired at the realization that she didn't even have the energy to break her knuckles against the concrete when she let out a cry of frustration as her body sagged against the wall. Her good shoulder dug into the concrete, her bad exposed to the air, and when she pressed her cheek against the flat surface, some younger part of her wished that the world would tilt on its axis so she could lie there like that, but if she sat down now, she wouldn't be getting back up again until she'd had her rest. All this for Jason Peter Todd, she thought, chiding herself as she pushed herself forward, step by agonizing step. And then she turned and was wandering through a parking lot. From somewhere nearby, she thought she heard the rumble of a truck. I don't care . She continued onward. When a sudden flash of headlights filled her vision, the only thing she could think to do was throw up her hands and block out the searing light, squeezing her eyes shut. Oh, boy . She heard the skid of tires and heard the honk of the horn, but no impact came. Nothing came to crush her. No doors flew open so heavy-footed men could pour out. \"Help me!\" she said hoarsely, her voice strained, and she threw her fist onto the hood of the car. She still couldn't see much; the impression the light had left on her had yet to fade. \"Help me, or I swear to god I'll beat this car with my bare hands until you get a whole new paint job.\" For good measure, she hit the car again. \"I mean it!\" She heard the engine turn off. The lights went off, and she had to wait for her eyes to readjust to the darkness. Someone got out of the car. Squinting, Drew caught sight of a few flashes of detail as dark spots corrupted her line of sight—red hair, a blade tipped in blue that hummed, green armor, a disinterested glare—before her body gave into the exhaustion crowding in on her from all sides. Her legs gave out and she hit the hood of the car before she hit the ground. \"I'm—I'm not—\" It was too much. It was all too much. I'm going to faint. I'm actually going to faint. I haven't done that in years. She couldn't believe it. If she'd had the strength or the will to hit something, she would have. The stranger leaned down to get a better look at her. Rough hands gripped her under her arms. A tired female voice said, \"help me get her into the backseat.\" \"But—\" \" Now , Bulk. You too, Baton.\" \"Fine,\" a man's voice said, \"but as soon as I do, I'm done.\" \"Yeah,\" chorused another man's voice. \"We've already established that the Fearsome Hand of Four is over with,\" the woman said coolly, \"so help me get her in the car, and get out.\" Then there was nothing, nothing at all.[Chapter 23] A/N: I watched Suicide Squad last night! I won't say anything about the actual content of the film, but I will say this: please, please, please put away your phones while in the theater! It's rude and distracting and everyone knows you're on it no matter how much you have the brightness turned down. Back to the fic: the Fearsome Hand of Four's leader is literally 'fearsome hand leader' on the DC wikia. We don't even have a name. So I took some liberties. Such as giving her a name. Thanks for the opportunity, DC. - J Drew knew she was dreaming. Someone was telling hers something, outside of herself, but she couldn't make herself wake up. Then… Drew couldn't remember the last time her jaw had ached this much from being pushed down the stairwell. It had happened before, but she'd been sleepy, and she'd been too sluggish to react and try to gain her balance before her father had stumbled down past her towards the ground floor, grumbling under his breath, smelling like he was going to drown himself at the bottom of the bottle he held in his hands. I hope he does . It hadn't been so bad this time. Her mother had locked the door to her bedroom and Drew had made sure to make herself as small and as inconvenient as possible, though she burned with rage at the thought of him shoving her aside like she was something bothersome, like junk. She crept back up the stairs and into the apartment since he was gone. But when she came in, she saw that the window in the kitchen was open. It was a wide one what opened if you knew how to push it up just right, and the latch never worked anyway because no one had ever thought to fix it since they lived on the third floor. Her mother was lying down in her room, she knew. Migraines made her head split open, her mother said, and sometimes she was too tired to get up out of bed. Drew didn't mind. Her cousin and her grandmother were gone and wouldn't be back until, and with any luck her father wouldn't show up until the morning. It was night now, in the hot summer. The sun had yet to set and the sky was orange with the polluted haze of the city and the tired sun trying to rest so that the moon could take its place in the sky for when it got dark. But Drew didn't remember opening the window. With all the fans going and making stray papers and flimsy book covers flutter about the room, it was too hot still. When she went to close it, she peered outside, and would have screamed when she leaned her head out the window if not for the gloved hand that slapped over her mouth. \"Shhhh,\" she heard a boy say, and when she looked to her right, her eyes widened. She nearly fell over. \" Robin ?\" she tried to say, but his hand was still over his mouth. \"The one and only,\" he said a bit proudly, and her heart lifted at the sight of the green, the red, the smile on his face. What a happy kid , she thought in bewilderment. Maybe crime fighting is really more than they make it out to be. \"I was in the neighborhood,\" he said offhandedly. Like it was nothing. Like he'd met her before. \"Where's Batman?\" she asked, shaking her head hard so that his hand fell away. There was sweat on the back of her neck, making her curls stick to the nape. It was uncomfortable, and leaning over the sink was even more so, but it wasn't every day a crime fighter stopped by on the window washer's long-abandoned station. Drew could feel a blush trying to creep onto her face. But she was almost out of grade school, and older kids didn't blush. Right? Isn't that what one of the girls in her class said? She couldn't remember. \"Uh, busy,\" Robin said. \"It's not even dark out.\" Her expression lit up. \"That's why, right? It's because he's a bat so he can only come out at night?\" \"Uh,\" he looked sheepish, rubbing the back of his neck, \"yeah. That's it.\" Then he held out his hand. \"I'm Robin.\" Like I don't already know . \"Drew,\" she said, smiling, and she shook his hand, wondering what she'd done to deserve something like this. Her mother said karma only worked half the time, and her father always said no one could do anything right, so why was September being kind to her? \"My name is Drew Foster. But I'm going to change my name someday. When I'm older.\" Her hatred for the family name was something that went deeper than she could go with a shovel in dirt. \"You could just do it now,\" he said. \"Who says you have to wait?\" \"My mom says you have to be a grown up to do that kind of stuff. Official stuff.\" \"I do official stuff and I'm not grown up,\" Robin said, puffing out his chest. Drew nodded seriously. He had a point. \"Tell you what,\" he said, \"tell me what you want to be called, and I'll make sure I won't call you anything else unless you ask me to.\" That was just about the nicest thing she'd ever heard from someone near her age. Was Robin near her age? Was that the kind of question you asked a crime fighter, or would that be too personal? Drew didn't even think about it. The word was kept close to her heart, and when she blurted it out, it felt like telling the truth when all her life she'd been living a life. \"Isley,\" she said, \"my name is going to be Drew Isley.\" \"Well,\" Robin said, \"I don't know about you, but I think you've been Drew Isley for as long as you decided that's who you were going to be.\" And Drew smiled. When Drew smiled, it felt like something like a speckled pink egg cracked open inside of her, and it hatched something new, something hopeful, not born of the rooms behind her, not of her mother nor her father nor anyone she was linked to by blood. He stuck out his hand again. \"Nice to meet you, Drew Isley,\" he said, grinning. And she shook it, somewhat in a daze. But before she could open her mouth, she heard her mother ask, \"honey? Honey, who are you talking to out there?\" \"No one, Mom!\" Drew called over her shoulder, glancing at the door, but when she looked back out the window, he was swinging away, waving goodbye. Now… \"Can you even hear me in there? Wake up .\" Drew felt the slide of water over her face before her body could register the freezing temperature. Sputtering indignantly into wakefulness, her eyes flew open, lips parted, sore throat dying to lodge some much-needed choice words from deep in her chest, but when she saw a redheaded woman standing above her, she stopped short. \"Who the hell are you ?\" Drew asked, not daring to believe what she was beginning to suspect had happened. Was I rescued? How the hell did that even happen? \" I ,\" the woman said, voice even icier than the water she'd thrown at her from the empty pitcher that was now sitting by her feet, looming ominously over her with a steely gaze in her green eyes, \"am the one who saved you. And you need to clean yourself up.\" Without warning, she threw down a towel onto Drew's lap. \"You smell like you've been wearing the same clothes for days.\" Drew opened her mouth, but the woman only shook her head and pointed to a door on the other end of the room. When she looked around, she realized she was in a small living room, stretched out on the couch. Immediately the aches and pains in her body came flooding back to her in a rush; she winced at how grimy she felt with all those scratches and bruises to boot. \"We'll talk after,\" the woman said, giving her a pointed look. \"Now get going.\" Seeing no other choice, Drew obliged. Or maybe it was because she was still surprised she hadn't been left for dead. Good Samaritans had their place in Gotham, but people had to look out for themselves. People had their own shit to deal with. She understood that much. Well, she tried to, anyway. When she braced her hands on the couch cushions to push herself up into a standing position, she nearly fell over. The woman didn't look particularly pleased to have her there, but there was only a split second of deliberation before her hand shot out to keep her from falling back down onto the couch. \"Thanks,\" Drew breathed. Everything ached. Why had jumping off a roof onto a car been a good idea? She couldn't remember. \"Get. Going.\" But there was an amount of ice in the woman's voice which had thawed sometime in the last few seconds. Drew watched as she withdrew her hand, turned, and went into a hallway and disappeared from view. She stood there for a moment, looking around in bewilderment while her head swam and her heart thudded loudly in her chest. With slow, careful steps, she made her way to the indicated door and pushed it open. The bathroom, like the living room, gave her that same cramped feeling, but it wasn't dingy or rundown. While it certainly wasn't new, it was not as old as her building. It didn't have that shabby feeling, like it was going to fall apart. It wasn't the type of place someone came home to and said I'm only living her because I can't go anywhere else . Peeling off her wet, dirty clothes felt like shedding her skin. The process itself was relatively simply, but if there wasn't a part of her body that didn't outright it hurt, it ached, and if something didn't ache, it was sore, and it wasn't sore it was, well—lucky. She didn't know how long she'd spent on the stranger's couch, but it must have been long, because her bruises were now fully purpled and blued. Her shoulder was covered in them from where she'd hit the roof the van. But when she stripped off her shirt, she noticed that her hands had been newly bandaged, and, with some alarm, that her ribs had been wrapped. Which meant that the woman must have seen the four long, jagged scars on her back, she realized with a cold sense of dread. No one had ever seen those scars. Not Pamela Isley, not her mother, not her cousin, not her grandmother, not Bruce, Dick, Alfred, or Jason. It had been a private, secret thing—a hidden shame—which had now been seen by a stranger and therefore the unseeing part of the world. At least, that was what her mother would have said. It was difficult to admit the skin under the new bandages felt a thousand times cleaner than the rest of her. She didn't exactly know if she should undo the bandages around her ribs and hands since she was going into the shower. She figured that it would be better if she grabbed one of the washcloths in the drawer she saw slightly open next to the sink and used that, and if the shower nozzle was adjustable, then she'd use that to thoroughly wash her hair. She knew her hands weren't as bad off as the rest of her, so, with care, she undid them and then stepped into the shower. Drew was in there long past the time when the hot water ran out. Half of the time in there was spent scrubbing every part of her that she could see until the skin was pink and raw and she'd reached out, dripping water, to grab another washcloth. Then her hair had taken up the other half. It was a tangled, knotted mess which she eventually abandoned the comb for picking through it slowly with her fingers. Soap suds gathered around her feet as she bent an uncomfortable angle for well over half an hour. Soon, she shut off the water and simply sat on the edge of the tub, hair over the drain. Many strands littered the floor of the shower, and when she was done and could run her fingers through her hair without them getting snagged, she felt the air rush out of her and began cleaning up the tub. She found a pair of scissors in the drawer while trying to locate and debated on whether or not she should cut right now. But she thought of her hostess, who had already done more than enough, and closed the drawer before she gathered her hair into a first at the nape of her neck and tied it back. The feeling of having a pony tail after so long of having it hang heavily on her shoulders was different, she thought, thinking of how dark the brown curls seemed when they were fresh out of the water. It feels good to be clean . She hadn't heard the door open while she'd been in the shower, but she noticed that a new set of clothes had been presented to her. Her old ones were nowhere to be seen. The clothes consisted of a dark navy shirt with sleeves that went to her wrists and hung loosely around her waist, hiding the hem of the clean but faded grey sweatpants. The socks were thin but soft. Carefully, she opened the bathroom door and padded out into the living space where the woman was leaning up against the wall, arms crossed over her chest, waiting. \"You took your time,\" she remarked as Drew lowered herself back onto the couch cushions. \"I had a bad day.\" Two days. Three days. A week. Half my life. \"Are these your clothes?\" \"I used to have a roommate,\" the woman shrugged. \"He won't be needing them anymore.\" When Drew looked, she saw that they were not feminine clothes. That's why the fit is a bit off . \"Who are you?\" Drew asked. \"Why did you help me?\" She wanted to be suspicious of this woman, but she was tired, so tired, and hungry. She could smell something, something that smelled like it could be food, but she didn't want to be rude. Pissing off the person who had shown her a little bit of decency when she'd been anything but decent the last few days was definitely not a wise decision. While she was not known for being wise, she knew it was not the time to act out. Not yet. She was only twenty, after all. \"And where are the men who were in the car?\" The woman pushed off the wall. \"My name is Ana.\" She headed off towards the hall, but she turned, and Drew saw the kitchen. Her stomach let out an embarrassing gurgle. \"Those were my former partners in crime.\" She heard the sink running, the sound of a beep, and the clatter of utensils. Then the woman, Ana, appeared with a bowl of something steaming. It smelled good . \"And I helped you because you threatened to bleed all over my car.\" She crossed the room, handed Drew the bowl, and resumed standing against the wall. \"Eat,\" she said with a nod. \"Your stomach's been grumbling since you got here.\" Drew inspected the food. Oatmeal . Topped with brown sugar. When was the last time I had this? Pamela had made her this once. In fact, it smelled like the same, dusty top-shelf generic brand Pamela Isley had given her after they'd first met. \"Don't eat it too fast. If you throw up, I'm taking you back outside. And I'll leave you there.\" A glance out the window behind the couch told Drew it had begun to snow. It wouldn't stick, but there would be ice in the morning, she thought, unless Gotham got lucky. \"Why don't you?\" Drew said, shoveling a spoonful of oatmeal into her mouth. \"I have some questions for you,\" Ana replied. \"What were you wearing when you…\" Drew tried to think back. Had it been a suit? Armor? \"Who are you, really?\" \"A former member of the Fearsome Hand of Four.\" Drew blinked slowly. \"Never heard of it.\" The redhead pursed her lips, looking like she was trying hard not to roll her eyes. \"It was a group of some of the best assassins money could buy.\" Drew choked on her oatmeal. \"But we are disbanded now,\" she continued. \"One of teammates was killed by someone who has displayed quite a bit of interest in you .\" \"Who—\" Oh. Oh . The Red Hood. \"I asked around. Rumor has it that there was a girl snooping around the Red Hood's territories. People were worried it might have been a reporter or something. Then the Red Hood told those involved in his operation to stay away from you. I wonder why that might be?\" But she wasn't done. \"You've been sighted around Gotham running from both the Red Hood and Nightwing by a source of mine. You made a personal attack on Black Mask when you burned down one of his establishments.\" \"It was an abandoned building.\" Inwardly, she winced. That was a mistake . \"It was his . That's what matters. And now his men are looking for you.\" She peered at Drew, who had resumed eating in slow, careful, small mouthfuls. \"Tell me, who do you think you are? A vigilante? A criminal? Good Samaritan? Someone who was caught at the wrong place at the wrong time?\" \"I…uh…\" \"You're not safe out there.\" \"I know.\" \"You misunderstand,\" Ana said. \"It isn't safe out there for you, so you're not going out there.\" Drew opened her mouth to protest, but she was cut off. \"So I'm not letting you go until you answer my questions.\" \"You're keeping me here because it's safe…and also because you want answers.\" Ana frowned. \"I didn't have to give you extra clothes,\" she said, \"I didn't have to save you. I'm not doing this to be a good person. I saved you out there because you might be able to help me, pay me back for not letting you die out there.\" Drew balked. She sputtered for a moment, indignant, a little stung, but finally, when she'd scraped the bowl clean, she set it down, and wiped her hands on her thighs. \"What do you want?\" \"Revenge,\" Ana said. \"It's quite simple. My teammate, Shot, is dead because of the Red Hood.\" Dread snaked past her wounds into her heart, settling into her stomach, hard and cold. Jason killed someone , she thought numbly. He might have been an assassin, but— \"The Red Hood has taken an interest in you—inconspicuous, yes, but obvious enough to those who pay attention.\" He's killed more than just the assassin. He's killed more people than some of the people he helped Gotham's police put away . It felt like someone had dumped a cold bucket of ice water down her back. He killed someone this woman cared about . She had ached for her friend back for so long, but the Jason she'd known had not been a murderer. Reckless, yes. A bit dangerous and out of bounds, yes , but had that Jason ever killed someone? There was so much she didn't know and didn't understand about all this. And she still had questions of her own. Did he really die? Or was his death faked, like they planted the fake body in the cemetery? She was beginning to doubt if the accounts of his death held any truth in them, but she remembered the funeral. Real sadness on the faces of Bruce and Tim. She'd left before Barbara had arrived, but they'd all known him well. Everything that day had been genuine, even if she hadn't known she was mourning Robin's death, too. So what was the truth? Would she ever get it at this point? \"I'm willing to help you if you help me.\" \"You've already helped me,\" Drew pointed out. \"Yes, but I can do more.\" How ? Drew wondered, feeling a pang in her chest. Why would you? You already said you've done enough . \"As far as I can tell, he's caused you enough trouble for one lifetime.\" That's not exactly false , Drew thought. \"And he killed my teammate.\" She didn't look particularly elated with this idea, but Drew could see something deep and raw burning in the woman's eyes, something that reminded her of the anger and grief she'd felt from not so long ago. \"I'd be doing us both a favor.\" \"What…did you have in mind?\" Drew asked hesitantly, doubt gnawing at her insides. She already knew she wasn't going to like this. This can't be good. But how bad can this be, really? \"I want you to help me set a trap,\" Ana replied, \"because I want another chance to kill him.\" Oh, Drew thought, feeling like she'd been punched in the gut, this is much worse than I thought .[Chapter 24] A/N: T here are either gonna be a lot more chapters that are shorter or fewer chapters that are longer. Or both. Not sure how to end this but it's going to end soon. Or maybe not? Someone should tell me what's going on around here sometime soon. It's still Friday where I am so I think it still counts that I got this done one time? Maybe? Who knows? Not me. Thank you so much for reviewing! I really do appreciate the feedback! - J \"I don't think I can help you.\" Ana blinked. \"What?\" she frowned. \"Why?\" \"I…I'm not the trap-setting type?\" But Drew's mind was whirring. How was she going to get out of this? \"Why wouldn't you want to help me?\" Ana asked, peering at her. She stalked across the room to stand in front of Drew. She recognized it for what it was: an intimidation tactic. But it worked all the same: her heart picked up and she felt her shoulders tense, even though she didn't have any other place to go. She didn't even know which part of Gotham she was in. \"Has he not pursued you?\" \"I—\" \"And is he not somehow responsible for at least some of your injuries?\" Drew thought of her hands, her ribs, the trouble that started up because of her hardheadedness and his reappearance in her life. She didn't blame him, not really, at least, not in the way that Ana was suggesting. What did she blame him for, though? The lie? The time she'd spent grieving? Bruce and Dick would share that blame, she thought, but she wasn't sure that she could fully accuse them of doing wrong. What could they have said to her then, without revealing heavily guarded secrets pertaining to their personal safety and the safety of those in their lives? But then how time had passed since the Red Hood's unmasking, for lack of a better word, and she still didn't know what had transpired over half a decade ago? \"You have a problem, and I have a solution.\" \"I believe you,\" Drew said when she caught wind of the glare edging onto the woman's features, waving a hand at her. Ana's nostrils flared, but she stepped away, giving the younger of the two space. Drew felt something seep out of her as her shoulders heaved and relaxed, and she realized that she'd been holding her breath. \"I just…don't want to be an accessory to murder.\" \"If you do this, I'll help you with your problem with Black Mask.\" \"You don't mean that.\" Ana gave her a long, hard look. \"You're right,\" she said, \"I don't, but if I survive my plan, and so do you, I might be inclined to help.\" Drew felt her stomach clench and fold up onto itself in the same instant. \"Is he after you because you're a rat?\" It felt like she was in a daze. \"A what?\" \"Did you talk to someone?\" She blinked. \"Uh, no.\" Not that she could properly remember, anyway. \"The police?\" \"No.\" Well, that was sort of a lie, but it didn't matter anyway, because in the end she'd done nothing for them by giving them a dead end with her name on it. \"Batman?\" Drew nearly choked on air. \" No ,\" she said, thinking of his silence over the years, of his grief, how she hadn't had a real conversation with him or Dick that was real and not about Jason in so long she couldn't remember what having a real family that she felt safe with was really like. Not in this place. \"Then why?\" \"Would you believe me if I said it was bad luck,\" Drew said, but she didn't phrase it like a question. Here eyelids were growing heavy, and she wanted to sleep, but a small, nondescript tendril made up some linked chain of fear and doubt slithered up behind her ribs inside her, making her side hurt for a brief moment. \"The Red Hood is ruthless. Ambitious. If he wants you dead, then there's little to nothing anyone can do. Word on the street is that he escaped the Batman once, but that's subject to consideration, because no one knows exactly where that rumor came from.\" Ana leaned back against the couch. \"Don't you want to walk home safely, Miss…?\" \"Call me Drew.\" \"Yes, Drew…\" Ana tapped Drew on the shoulder, causing her to glance over at her. \"How would you help me with Black Mask?\" she asked after a moment, and then quickly added, \"if I were to help.\" \"I would say that Shot put you up to it.\" \" What ?\" She thought that her dead best friend being Robin would be one of the most ridiculous and unexpected things she'd ever hear in her lifetime, but she was horrified at how wrong she'd been. \"Sometimes, in the predicted events of our deaths, assassins engineer or invest in a failsafe.\" \"For what?\" \"Revenge.\" \"That doesn't sound right.\" \"What would you know about it? Have you ever had a backup plan in your life, Drew?\" No, she realized, she decidedly did not do anything that wasn't ever based on impulsiveness and bad timing. She didn't even plan for birthdays. But Bruce would probably have plans like that, backups for backups. Dick, too, she thought. And so why wouldn't Jason? But it wasn't for her. \"It doesn't matter what it is—\" \"Oh, yes it does,\" Drew stuck a finger in the woman's face. Not her best idea yet, she knew, since this woman was a trained killer and didn't do what she did out of the goodness in her heart, but she was beginning to feel the barest traces of irritation in her system. Also: had she been fired yet from her work? Maybe Bruce had saved her by calling in. Maybe everyone had stopped caring. Maybe she'd return home and find herself out of employment and, to boot, evicted. When was rent due, anyway? She couldn't remember if the day was coming up or if it had already passed. \"And Black Mask isn't stupid. He'll probably see right through whatever it is you've got going on.\" Ana batted her hand away. \"Shot would come back from the dead to avenge his own death,\" she said in a low, serious tone that send chilly spikes of knowing through Drew, because it made her think of Jason, \"and because it was one of Black Mask's contracts that got him killed, he'd raise hell for him in order to get his revenge. Do you see?\" Drew felt her heart sink. \"Yes.\" \"Good.\" Ana leaned towards her, hand snaking out so that she could put it on Drew's shoulder. The touch was comforting, like a friend, a sister, perhaps, and it sent a pang of longing through Drew. How long had it been since someone held her? Since she felt content? Since someone who she didn't know well looked at her like she wasn't some kid from down the street who had a big mouth and more problems than she knew what to do with? How long? How long had it been since she found herself wishing for a friend, knowing that, in Jason's absence, she'd neglected any chance she'd had a social life, and had been paying for it out of a loss of how to exactly go about dealing with such a profound lost? She wouldn't go as far to admit she was lonely, but she could feel herself slipping. It was getting hard to stay on topic. She was unbelievably tired, even after some time of being passed out on the couch. \"So will you do it?\" He's my best friend. \"I'll even pay you, if the prospect of having Black Mask off your back isn't good enough. Could probably do something about Nightwing, too—\" \"No,\" Drew said quickly. Something cold shot through her; the thought of Dick's hypothetical death was enough to make her stomach turn. Losing Jason had been, to say the least, hard, and she thought it might just destroy Bruce to lose another son, even if the one who had already died had somehow come back. Rushing to explain, she said, \"I don't want anyone else to die.\" \"You're talking to a professional killer, Drew.\" \"Well, I'm not a killer. Or a vigilante. Or…much of anything.\" Ana arched a brow. \"What is it that you do for work?\" \"Uh…I think I work in a warranty office. Checking the insurance on toasters gone bad is kind of my talent.\" Ana looked at her, deadpan expression in place for one bleak, long moment before she ruefully smiled. \"That's a new one.\" \"You've never met a toaster lady before?\" That's what customer service workers were called on her floor—toaster ladies. It made her grit her teeth and knuckles whiten to the point where she was sure she was going to lose it and punch someone in the face, possibly the office tattle tale who insisted on making everything his business, but it was accurate enough now. How on earth could she defend her job? It didn't even pay well. \"Can't say that I have.\" Then Ana grew serious again. \"The Red Hood will kill you if you've done anything to jeopardize his operations, Drew.\" Jason wouldn't kill me. Wryly, she thought, he hasn't yet, anyway . It was a bad joke on her part, but it made the corner of her mouth tug upwards into something like a smile. \"I've been almost-killed before.\" Nothing new . She thought of her family, the day she'd been driven away from that stuffy, crumbling apartment building, and pushed all of that down. Being shoved down the stairs and nearly having her head cracked open on the way down didn't have a damn thing on being on the run and having her bare bones worn down to almost nothing so that she was dead on her feet. And that memory was fuzzy, anyway, and distant, too: her dashing through Gotham was still fresh in her mind, if a little muddled her having passed out some time ago. \"That's quite unfortunate, but if either him or Black Mask gets their way, there won't be an almost next time.\" Drew wanted to put her head in her hands and weep, but she simply leaned back against the couch and wrapped her arms around herself, eyes falling listlessly on the off-white ceiling. There was a crack, she noticed, above the light fixture. It didn't look all that old, or that wear-and-tear had caused it. She felt numbed to the idea that the woman next to her was an assassin when her best friend—former? Current? Forever? —was the Red Hood, of all people, and she knew that if she were the type of person to bury her head in the sand and pretend that he was dead and that he hadn't broken one of the only rules Batman had had. But wouldn't this count as a betrayal? Best friend or not, orchestrating the potential death of someone whom she had, despite any misgivings, loved in her adolescence, seemed so preposterous that a giggle born out of hysteria and disbelief bubbled out of her. She clapped a hand over her mouth, eyes stinging once again, but she quickly blinked those unshed tears away and tried to squash that rising, achy feeling in her chest. \"You'd be the bait,\" Ana said when Drew didn't say anything. \"You wouldn't get hurt.\" Drew outright laughed at that, but the sound that fell from her lips was hollow and humorless. \"I see what you're doing.\" When Ana gave her a look, she explained, \"if I bail on you, then you've got someone to blame, too. And since you've already told me your plan…there'd be no sense in letting me go.\" Ana nodded. \"You catch on quick.\" Drew looked away. \"Not really.\" Ana was silent for a moment, then she nodded. \"You know the stakes.\" \"You're not giving me much of a choice.\" \"You owe me anyway for pulling you into my car when I could have left you to die.\" \"That's true.\" \"So you'll help me?\" She didn't say anything. Her heart was beating faster now, fearful in its frantic pace, but Ana simply nodded. \"I'll let you get some sleep, first,\" she said, having taken Drew's silence for a 'yes.' Then she got up off the couch and said, \"I'm sorry you had to get caught up in all this. But tomorrow we'll start. And, if I'm lucky, this arrangement will be over and done with before you know it.\" Drew didn't say anything. She watched the woman meander out of sight down the same hall she'd gone down when she'd told her to go take a shower. When she heard the door shut, Drew stood up immediately, looking around till she spotted what she needed hanging on the wall: a landline. She crept over to it as carefully as she could and picked up the phone, putting the hearing piece to her ear, but found that it was dead. Putting it back as quietly as she could, she turned around and surveyed the small, cozy room. \"Jason,\" she said a-loud, wishing he could hear her then like she'd wished all those times before, \"how am I going to get out of this?\" But then looked to the left and saw the window. It was unlatched, she discovered upon closer inspection, but when she poked her head out into the freezing cold air, there was nothing down below her which would save her from shattering her ankles, or any other part of her body for that matter. It was just an empty, open drop down to the dark asphalt below. Turning around again, she froze when she saw Ana had soundlessly come out to the living room to observe her. \"Looking for a way out, are we?\" The woman didn't look particularly pleased, but she wasn't trying to kill her, either, so maybe certain death didn't await her here. Maybe. There was no real way to tell, or trust what she was saying. Wouldn't she be a loose end once this was all over? \"Searching for an escape route, perhaps.\" Drew rubbed a hand across her face, sighing in defeat. \"I've been getting used to doing that lately.\" Ana only shook her head. \"Get some sleep,\" she said, and then she turned out the lights, leaving Drew alone in the dark. I'm going to get out of here , she thought. One way or another . Drew's eyelids were drooping, but she still felt warm and rested from the oatmeal and the time she'd already spent on the couch, so she crept to the coat closet after long, quiet moments of stillness, making sure that the assassin's door was shut. Inside, she found a pair of dry sneakers and an overly large coat, but anything was better than being cold, so she put them on as quietly as she could. It's now or never . Taking a deep breath to steady herself, Drew wrapped her hand around the knob and opened the door. Peering out into the hall to see that it was empty, she closed it softly behind her and started making her way down towards what she hoped would be the stairwell. But the hall was dark, and empty, and silent, and for all she knew she was heading in the direction of a closet, but anywhere was better than the place where her being potentially involved of the second death—second murder —of Jason Todd haunted her. By the time she got to next floor, she realized that this building was abandoned, and that the only apartment occupied was Ana's. Oh, no , she thought, feeling dread. And then she heard it: The creak of floorboards above her head. Her heart began to hammer as she ducked into the nearest doorway and pressed up against the wall, willing herself to be still. Above her, she could hear something or someone pacing back and forth. It was possible she heard a voice. Was it a feminine one calling out her name? She couldn't tell. She didn't want to know. Eventually, she slid down the wall so that she was sitting in the dark, in the dust, eyelids drooping. She couldn't hear anything anymore. Maybe it had been a giant rat. Maybe it had been Ana. Maybe Ana would think she had gone. Maybe it wasn't Ana at all. And then, because common sense had apparently left her, Drew was curling into herself and nodding off to sleep in that small, cold place before she could get herself up on her feet again. Perhaps the morning would be kinder. Or maybe it would throw her out the window and leave her broken on the street corner. Either way, she was too tired to care. And when she dreamed, she dreamed about Jason. In her dream, he had donned the Red Hood's mask, and Dick was beside him in his Nightwing attire. The two of them stood over her and reached out, but, for the life of her, she couldn't muster up the energy to reach back out to them and take their hands. But then she'd found herself falling backwards, away from Jason, from Dick, from Bruce, from Pamela and her family and everyone who had ever known her, and when her back made contact with the ground, it was like she was no place and nothing at all. It was as if the whole world was muffled and she was in between two panes of glass. She woke up in the dark in a cold sweat, breathing hard, before dropping back off to sleep. When the sunlight streaming in from the broken window across from her shined on her face some hours. Well , she thought, dragging a hand over her eyes. \"Time to get up,\" she muttered, staggering to her feet. In the hall, she found Ana waiting for her leaning up against the wall as if nothing at all was wrong with the world or the people in it, or that she wasn't an assassin and that they were just two friends meeting up, dressed in civilian attire, but the scarf she had pulled up over the lower half of her face reminded her of the armor she thought she'd seen her in on the night she'd rescued her. The woman's sharp green eyes were what kept her feeling cautious and jittery as she came out into the hall, straightening her clothes. \"I hope you slept well,\" Ana said, \"because we've got work to do.\" Drew glanced out the window towards the pale beams of light, and, for the life of her, couldn't remember whether or not the Red Hood had ever been sighted during the day time.[Chapter 25] A/N: Your feed back is very much appreciated :) It's fanfiction writer appreciation day! *nudge nudge wink wink* No, but seriously: I apologize that this was posted a bit later than intended and it was shorter than I meant it to be. Dealing with school a week and a half before it even starts is...more stressful than I thought it would be. Our system has been royally screwed up and I'm in the process of fixing my schedule. Thank you for your patience. - J Ana leaned on the telephone booth of the payphone, drumming her fingers against her arm. Glancing over her shoulder, she said, \"hurry up. We don't have all day.\" Drew might have been doing everything within her power to keep her nerves from making her hands shake. Deep, deep breaths, in and out. That was what she had to focus on. If she thought about the prospect of having a knife in her back if she didn't comply, even reluctantly, then she just might make a scene. If she remembered correctly, she was quite the expert when it came to being dramatic. Or maybe that had been Jason, once, or maybe it had been no one she'd known recently. The years were crowding in on her behind her eyes, and, standing in the grey light of the dingy day, she felt like there wouldn't be enough sleep in the world to cure her of this bone-deep exhaustion which seemed to haunt her every waking hour now that she'd been faced with this impossible task. \"You know,\" Drew said, her voice sounding hollow to her own ears, \"if you called and made it sound like—\" \"We've discussed this—\" \"—it might sound more convincing.\" Ana didn't look impressed. \"I don't need you to convince them,\" Ana said. \"Call whoever you need to call, but just make them suspect something isn't right. That's all you have to do.\" Drew gave her a pointed look. \"Can I have some—space?\" She waved her hand vaguely around the phone booth. If she didn't get some soon, she might do something she'd regret. Code for stupid , she thought she could imagine Jason saying when they were younger and Alfred was frowning at them. Or perhaps it was a memory from the early days. Who could say? It was a warm, but distant, thing from years past. The thought threatened to make her throat close; it, for a moment, because impossible to swallow due to the lump lodged in her throat. Shrugging a shoulder, Ana pushed off the side and wandered off a-ways, but not too far so she couldn't keep an eye on her. Drew looked at the phone hanging in its cradle and sucked in her bottom lip, eyes going distant as she thought. It took a long time for her to pick up the phone and put it to her ear and hear the dead tone ringing out. She put in her coins and dialed the only number that she could think of. But her main concern was warning Jason away from the trap they were setting. And she didn't want him to think that she wanted him dead. Sure, she was hurting—inside and outside—but he still had a place in her heart, somewhere, even if she didn't quite know where he stood since his resurrection. I don't know what I'm doing anymore. Scratch that—I don't know how to stop. I don't know how this got out of my control. I'm afraid I don't know much about anything anymore . Swallowing down her self-pity, she tried to school her features into something impassive and flat, but it crumpled when she thought of what it might look like, to have Jason die because of her. She couldn't have that. She couldn't, she wouldn't. So there was really only one real way to handle this. Taking a deep breath, she punched in the only number that came to mind. It rang and went to the answering machine. \"… Please leave your message at the tone .\" Drew felt like she was going to combust, but as the machine waited, she could only breathe into the receiver, heart racing, hands gripping the phone too tight. Glancing over her shoulder, she saw that Ana was still out of earshot. Keeping her eyes of the assassin, she finally cleared her throat, hoping that the pause wouldn't be too long so that the person receiving the message wouldn't delete it before they could hear the end of it. \"Uh, hi, Dick,\" Drew said, her eyes never straying from Ana. \"It's me. I'm calling you on your home phone because…well…\" She scratched the back of her head, thinking. She didn't know any type of code that could say a professional assassin is making me implicit in the premeditation of the murder of Jason Todd. Call back soon so I don't have to watch him die. \"I won't lie to you. I'm in some trouble and…it's bad. But I'm okay. I mean, I have clean clothes. Um.\" How much can I say without getting myself killed in the process? \"Tell Jason not to come find me.\" Yeah, that'll work. \"Just…keep on keeping on.\" Drew winced. Where had she heard that line for? Hadn't Alfred said it once? She didn't know. But this would get what Ana wanted—it would get Jason close enough, because they'd find out which payphone she'd used, and when they did he'd probably start sneaking around and figure out where she was, and then Ana would be waiting for him. \"I don't want anyone to die,\" she said—more like pleaded—softly into the receiver. \"But I've got to—\" Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Ana is coming back over . \"I gotta go,\" she said, \"later, Grayson.\" Then she hung up. The urge to rip out her hair was nearly overwhelming in that moment. I've done it now, haven't I? Ana was over at her side in moments. \"So is he coming or what?\" Drew swallowed, wiping her clammy hands on the front of her shirt. \"Oh, he is,\" she said, words ringing empty in her own ears, hoping to god that Jason wouldn't come alone. \"Good,\" Ana smiled brightly and clapped her hard on the back. A warning more than anything else, it reminded her of the bruise she'd earned when she had unsuccessfully made the second escape attempt that morning on what skin there was on her torso that hadn't already been bruised, scratched, or broken. Keeping her hand on her shoulder, Ana guided Drew away from the booth, but both women missed it when they saw a flash of red hair disappear around the corner before they crossed the street, the smell of something earthy and green following in its wake. I'd love some help right now , Drew thought dismally, but, little did she know, help was just a-ways away. It was, in fact, coming up behind her, and coming up fast.[Chapter 26] A/N: You have kittykat6625 to thank for their kind, inspiring PM that made me want to give this another go. Sorry to have kept you guys waiting for so long; but I'm back now, and have every intention of finishing this, even if it kills me. Thank you, everyone - seriously. If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be back here. Love, J When they rounded the corner, they went to car, and got in on their respective side. On the way to where Ana had parked, Ana had kept her hand securely on Drew's shoulder, fingers digging in none too gently in a successful effort to remind her not to try anything. Drew felt like puking the whole ride back to the abandoned apartment building Ana had taken up residence in. She had just as well signed Jason's death warrant. And she couldn't come up with a way to make this turn out in her favor, or anywhere close. The thought made her sick. She was probably going to be sick. How had it come to this? She didn't know. She was beginning to have trouble breathing. It felt like someone was sitting on her chest, like that thug working for Black Mask was still putting all his wait on his foot, crushing her lungs to dust. Drew kept her arms crossed over her chest tightly, staring at her reflection in the window, intent on not looking at Ana. I have to find a way out of this , was the only thing going through her mind, I have to do something. I can't let him die. Ana stopped the car, but didn't immediately get out. Silence descended upon them, until Drew looked over, realizing that the woman belonging to the Fearsome Hand of Four had been waiting for her to make eye contact. \"You are not my target,\" Ana said. As if that made any difference. As if that changed anything. Drew wanted to scream. Bitterly, she continued echoing her words from earlier, \"you're just the bait.\" Drew opened her mouth, shut it, and opened it again, like a fish out of water. Please find another way , she thought uselessly, but she could see by the look on the woman's face - in her eyes - that she could not, and would not, be dissuaded from her present course. Or else, it would take something of close to the gravity of a death to steer here off track. Finally, she settled on saying, \"you don't have to do this.\" He's going to kill you , she thought, not knowing how she felt about that. She'd done a lot of things in her life, yes, but she'd never been responsible for the death of another, indirectly or directly, and she wasn't eager to see that change any time soon. She was beyond not not caring. She felt hopelessly mixed up, so out of sorts. Had she ever really been put together, or had she always been like this - a combination of pieces of two different lives, stuck together with cracking glue, threatening to fall apart should she hit the ground wrong? She didn't know. She was tired of all these questions, and the not knowing. It was endlessly frustrating. Frustration, she remembered dimly, used to make her cry as a child. Ana held her gaze for a moment, and said, \"worry about yourself.\" \"You just said - \" \"When I cleaned your wounds,\" Ana interrupted as if Drew had never spoken, \"I saw the scars on your back.\" Ruefully, she smiled, and Drew wanted to vanish into the leather covering the car seat; she wanted Gotham to swallow her up and keep her inside its deep, dark insides. She'd never talked about this. She was sure a doctor had inspected her before she'd gone to live with Bruce and his boys, and thus told him about the scars on her back, but she'd avoided speaking on it for all these years. It was possible that she didn't even have words for what had happened: she had, after all, sworn to herself that she would never speak of it in hopes that it would go away on its own. But things never worked out like that. Drew doubted anything would work in her favor ever again. Stiffly, she said, \"that's none of your business, and doesn't have anything to do with - \" Ana said softly, \"my mother was a drunk, too. Let me guess: it was your father.\" Drew felt her stomach sink to her ankles. Why? Why did it have to be brought up now? Why couldn't this have waited until she died? Please don't ask me. Please stop talking about it . Though Drew was sitting completely still, on the inside she was plummeting, falling into a dark chasm. Shame prickled at her hotly, and she winced, outwardly, so that she wouldn't cringe so badly at the feeling. Ana placed a hand beneath her left breast, and Drew's eyes darted to the spot. \"Scars like that,\" the assassin said almost conversationally, as if they were speaking on the weather or, in her case, murder, \"are made from the jagged ends of broken bottles, no?\" Drew's heart nearly stopped in her chest. \"Those edges,\" Ana explained, her hard eyes softening for just a moment, \"cut by glass. I know them. Too many of them to be an accident, though, like mine were.\" Drew looked away, desperate to change the subject, to think of anything else. How she'd broken one of her father's liquor bottles, how he'd flown into a rage, how he'd flung it at her retreating back - how it had hit her, and how he had tried to break it over her head in a drunken fury, and only was saved from further lacerations by her mother's intervention. That was the last time her mother had ever intervened; her father had nearly killed them both for it. Tears stung Drew's eyes. She didn't want to cry. Not here. Not now. And she didn't want to be thinking of this, here and now, when she was helping lead Jason into a trap. \"Why are you saying this?\" Drew whispered, for fear of her voice cracking. \"Because I understand,\" Ana told her, reaching forward to put a hand on Drew's shoulder. Drew's first instinct should have been to flinch away, but the knowledge of Ana - with that look in her eyes Drew had seen in her own in the mirror for so, so long - having gone through something similar was rooting her to the spot, begging to her find kinship with this woman. Someone like me , her lonely heart bleated into the dark of the interior of the car, someone who was blamed for the drink, the glass breaking, for everything. Oh, how she wanted to curl up and cry. \"You and I,\" Ana said, gesturing between us, \"we are not alike. But I understand.\" Drew swallowed down a sob. \"You don't even know me.\" She couldn't think of a way to stop this. She wasn't Nightwing, or Batman, or Robin. She wasn't a hero; nothing in her would provide her a solution to all this. And it was killing her, realizing that she was getting closer and closer to the moment when Ana would try to kill Jason. It would kill her, Drew thought, feeling helplessness and desperation flash through her, if she played a part in the death of Jason. Of her best friend . \"I don't have to,\" Ana said. \"We can always tell each other apart from the others.\" \"We?\" Children of the damned, drunk, and abusive? \"Kindred spirits,\" Ana said, and then her demeanor changed: her expression hardened, her posture became cold, and she narrowed her eyes at Drew. All signs of empathy were gone: only the professional assassin remained. Drew felt her heart sink. She wondered, idly, if we had met under different circumstances, could we have been friends? Her heart said yes as her mind spun uselessly, coming up empty. There was no way out of this. \"Now get out of the car.\" Drew looked at Ana for a good, long moment, trying to reconcile the warmth and understanding she'd just become witness to with the now cold, unfeeling exterior. Maybe that meant there was some good in this woman, she thought, and then it hit her: Jason had killed people, and a part of her - maybe even most of her - still loved him. If this woman was a killer - and Drew had no doubt she was - then maybe there was some good left in her, too. Not much, she amended mentally, remembering how Batman would never, ever take a life, but if they were truly kindred spirits - if Ana could know her for a matter of hours and immediately read her, know her past, and understand , then Jason was not beyond loving. It was too late to save him from the man he'd become, but she could love him. She did love him. What she meant was, I want to keep loving him. I want him to be in my life, for him to be in mine. I want to be his friend again.. More than anything. These were the desperate thoughts of a woman - no, a girl, who was Drew kidding? - that was about to lose her best friend all over again. She didn't know what to do with the feelings inside of her; she didn't know what to do with her thumping, aching heart; but all she did know was that she suddenly, desperately wanted to see Jason again, alive and well, without that helmet and domino mask. She wanted to hold him, if he would let her. She wanted, so much that it hurt, to resume their friendship. To resume what they'd had, and had been heading towards, before the legacy of the second Robin was ended abruptly with a beating dealt by a crowbar and an explosion that maybe could have been seen by the stars. Drew blinked; she hadn't realized Ana had moved. How long had she been lost in her mind? How long had Ana been waiting? There was no way to guess at the passage of time - the only thing she could judge it by was the look on the redhead's face. The assassin was now standing outside her car door, glaring, waiting. \"We must begin to prepare,\" Ana said, and the hard edge emerging in her voice made Drew flinch away from the hand that came out and yanked open the door. \"Come on.\" In the end, Ana had to pull Drew from the car. \"The sooner we get this done, the sooner you can go home,\" Ana told her as they entered the building. But Drew could only ask herself bleakly as she was led up the stairs, home? What do I have to go back to should this go according to her plan? I don't have a home . The thought struck her, cold and sharp like ice down her back, and Drew swallowed down the urge to cry once again, then attempted to steel herself. She would figure a way out of this. She would do anything and everything she could to make sure the former leader of the Fearsome Hand of Four would not succeed in murdering Jason, the former Robin, the Red Hood. She just hoped she could come up with some sort of plan soon.[Chapter 27] A/N: Yours truly just might know how to end this story. It might not come for a few chapters yet, but I've got the vaguest of inclinations. I mean this from the bottom of my heart: thank you to everyone for your favorites, follows, reviews, and, most importantly of all, your patience. It's been a long time coming. It took six years to get to this point. But I think I can do this. And I want do it for you guys. Love, J Ana was talking, but Drew wasn't listening. Some part of her had shut off as soon as they'd stepped back into Ana's apartment, and now the rest of her was running with her ears turned off. Her mind was racing. They would track the call to the payphone. Drew assured Ana of this; there was no way they wouldn't discover the location. And they would know the general layout, and they would know that Drew was in trouble. And then what? Drew knew Jason would come running, possibly with Dick on his heels. It was more likely, though, that Jason would somehow make it to her on his own - and then it would be over for him. \"Drew, are you listening to me?\" Drew blinked back into reality. Her brow furrowing, she said honestly, feeling dumb and blank and so stretched out she thought someone could tear her with a twitch of their wrist, \"no.\" Ana sighed, and then resumed pacing back and forth. Drew idly noted that she was wearing a path into the rug; a glance around the apartment indicated to her that Ana was, in fact, a pacer, and was probably a menace to carpets and rugs everywhere. \"I've made up my mind,\" Ana said sharply, causing Drew to look up at her; the effort it took to do so was mind-numbing. The bone deep exhaustion within her wanted to drag her down into a dark, deep sleep, but her heart was threatening to shatter, her life teetering on a precipice. After all she'd been through, this was to be her life. This was what she would amount to - she would either be complicit in Jason's death, or she would die trying. Dick, forgive me for the stupid things I might do to set this right . Dick would forgive her; Jason, on the other hand, she wasn't so sure. He probably wouldn't forgive her if she died. But she wouldn't forgive herself if he died all over again. And that was where her head was at. \"I'm going to kill him,\" Ana continued, \"and then I'm going to help you with your little problem with Black Mask.\" \"Then what?\" The words came out, clumsy and without thought. Ana regarded her with no hidden level of exasperation. \"Once that's done, we'll part ways. You'll never see me again.\" Drew knew that, if she'd been heartless, that would have been the best possible plan the assassin could have come up with. But the fact of the matter was, and remained, that Drew was Drew - that she was a being tethered to Gotham by her love, and her hate, and her intent on not failing Jason. Even if it got her hurt. Don't think about dying yet , Drew warned herself, and swallowed down the bile rising in the back of her throat. \"Hey.\" The blunt edge of Ana's voice made her cringe, but Ana didn't look sorry for it. \"You're not delivering the final blow yourself. Your hands will be clean of this.\" Drew looked at Ana bleakly. How could she understand? What could she say to make this right? Nothing , her mind supplied, you have nothing left to say that's worth listening to . God. She just wanted to sleep until the world fell away. Selfishly, her aching body thought, is that too much to ask for? But the time for selfishness was over. It was time she acted. It was time she did the saving this time around. \"But it will be my fault,\" Drew said, realizing that Ana was waiting on her to speak. \"I - \" \"You do this, or you wind up dead. You're choice.\" She meant that Black Mask would surely find her and kill her if Ana did not lend her her assistance, and the thought made her sick. This isn't fair. \"Since you haven't been listening to me, it's clear that explaining the plan to you is useless.\" Ana turned away, her eyes going to the window. \"Your sense of good and bad is out of place here. You need to think about what's important.\" Drew opened her mouth, but then there was a creak of wood outside the apartment door. Ana whirled around, hand immediately going for the hilt of her glowing blue sword. \"Stay here,\" she said, but there was no need. It sounded like whatever it was was getting closer, and Drew felt fear cut through her, and wondered, bleakly, if Black Mask had finally found them. Or if Jason had. Or if it was something else entirely. Then something began to creep under the door: in the dim light, Drew couldn't make out for certain what it was, but her eyes widened to owlish proportions when it hit her: Vines? Did that mean - The door creaked, vines - or roots - curling between the cracks, and began to pull it from its hinges, until it was thrown across the room so quick Drew didn't dare blink should she miss it or any other sudden moves, hitting Ana head on. The assassin shrieked at the impact, immediately heaving off the ruined door and scrambling to her feet \"More friends of yours?\" Ana directed the question over her shoulder, but Drew was numb, suspended in disbelief. How can this be? Someone stepped into the doorway: a woman . And she wasn't alone. A figure joined her, and when Drew was finally able to make out their features, she found her legs carrying her to the farthest corner of the room, her hands trembling, teeth chattering. Confusion warred with fear for control over her head. \"Ya know,\" a familiar, infamous voice called out, \"kidnapping don't look so good for you, Sword Girl.\" That accent , Drew thought, pressing herself into the corner. The woman turned to her companion. \"Whaddya say, Ivy? She should find another line of work.\" The first figure from before stepped out into the light. \"Why, yes, Harley,\" Poison Ivy said, her smile wicked sharp. Green was curling all over her, her skin seeming to glow; snarling roots and gnarled vines were slithering around her feet, as if waiting for her command. \"Alright,\" Harley said, with a grin brighter than the sun on her face, \"let's get goin'!\" And with that, she raised her hammer over her head, and charged at Ana.[Chapter 28] A/N: I hope 2018 is treating you all well. If it isn't, well, I hope this helps in some way. Please feel free to PM me any time; I've missed you guys. Love, J The fight that followed the abrupt introductions was, to say the least, something Drew never thought she'd live long enough to see. And, even if she did, it was something a person caught the tail end of in news footage submitted by a camera phone, the quality blurred and grainy compared to the immaculate clearness of the television screen. Ana was quick on her feet - faster than Drew had expected - but, in the end, she hadn't been prepared for the team of opponents. She'd been expecting one, and the Red Hood, at that. Nothing could have warned her of the arrival of Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy. The fight was quick and dirty. It ended with Ana's head cracking against the wall after a fierce blow from Harley, and her body, unconscious, was restrained by Poison Ivy's green tendrils. The vines were snaking dangerously close to her throat. Drew didn't know what to do. She was, for all that it was worth, dumbfounded, and flinched when Harley turned her megawatt smile on her. \"Hey, darlin',\" Harley greeted, swinging her hammer around so it was resting over her shoulders. \"Red said you could use the help.\" Drew tried to think of something to say. But no words came out of her; they'd dried up in her throat long ago, and all she could do was stare in utter shock and bewilderment. Was this what her life would amount to? A bizarre combination of connections, coincidences, and events that spelled out a lifetime's worth of trouble? Drew's eyes fell on Poison Ivy, who held up her hands as she began to approach Drew. \"We're not going to hurt you,\" she said, and the way she said it made something snag on Drew, like it was catching the tail end of a memory. But what about it was familiar. \"You know me,\" Poison Ivy said, and crouched down so she was eyelevel with Drew, with Harley still in the background. When had she sunk to the floor in a boneless heap? She didn't know. She never seemed to know, she realize, anything about anyone. \"Uh,\" Drew tried, fumbling for a response that she hoped would come out coherently since her brain felt as it had been turned to mush over the last several - weeks? Years? Maybe it had always been like this. Maybe this was all she would ever be. \"I don't think so? I would remember the, uh,\" she glanced over at Ana, \"plants.\" Poison Ivy smiled at her, not unkindly, but it was Harley who spoke up. \"Oh, come on, kid. Look closer - don'tcha know it, you do know her!\" Drew squinted. She tried to see it, but it wasn't working. What was going on? What was she supposed to recognize? \"It's me,\" Poison Ivy said, and then turned to Harley. \"My face, please,\" Poison Ivy said with a smirk, and Harley grinned, obliging. She put down her hammer, and Drew watched in awe and confusion. From seemingly out of nowhere, Harley pulled out some sort of bag. The gravity of the situation hadn't sunk in yet. Reality , as a matter of fact, hadn't sunk in yet. Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy had just burst into her life, subsequently taking out her captor, but were now - what? What were they doing? Drew felt so sluggish and heavy in her present state. She began to press her back harder against the wall, wondering if she could use it to propel her body upward, to maybe get close to standing, but then she realized that Harley was wiping at Ivy's face with quick, decisive strokes. \"Ta-da!\" Harley said, and Drew felt her body collapse, still boneless. Attempting an escape was futile at this point. What was the point of it if her body couldn't do the work? Drew watched, blinking as Poison Ivy turned around - And a strangled cry wrenched its way out of Drew's chest into the open air. Tears were gathering in her eyes; her vision blurred. It was too late to swallow or beat them down into the dark parts of her; it was too late for her, period. \"Pamela,\" Drew said, and the tears started coming, and wouldn't stop. \"Pamela,\" she said, and she felt herself being pulled into warm, comforting arms, and the familiar, safe scent of Daffodils engulfed her, holding her like another set of arms. Drew tried to say she was sorry, but all she could do was cry. She tried to say something - anything - but Pamela just shushed her and stroked her hair, holding her close, like a mother would. For the time being, the rest of the world fell away, and there was nothing but the three women in the room. I don't believe this. I don't. I can't. How? How? How can this be? \"Aw, geez,\" Harley said, a little sheepish, but mostly full with understanding, \"You didn't tell me she was gonna cry so hard, Red.\" The makeup had worked. The girl had finally recognized Red, and Harley initially had been thrilled at the notion, but all her heart could do was hurt for this little girl. She was grown, Red had told her once, maybe twenty, but in that moment, all Harley could see was a scared little girl who was all alone in the world, bogged down by pain and - well, she couldn't guess what else, but she wasn't some dummy. She knew just by looking at the girl that she'd been put through the wringer. And any friend of Red's, Harley thought, was a friend of hers as well. \"I didn't know,\" Poison Ivy admitted, shushing Drew until the girl was softly crying, but heaving sobs no longer filled the room. \"Drew,\" she said, trying to reach the girl, but Harley could see the girl was gone. The girl was gone, drowning in her tears, and it must have been a long time coming, too, she reasoned, because it was painful to listen to. Red had told her about the kid; it was no wonder that everything that had been bottled up was spilling out now. And there were questions, too, that needed answering, but Harley knew this couldn't be rushed. Harley, earlier that night, had had half a mind to find the people who were blood to the kid and smash them - mainly the father - to pieces, but Red had convinced her that there were other ways to help the kid. Better, more effective ways. Harley had simply grinned and said, \"lead the way, Red,\" and the smile she'd gotten in return had her doing somersaults inside. Helping Red felt so natural, like breathing; Harley was glad she'd called. The woman being restrained by Poison Ivy's vines groaned, indicating that she would be conscious soon, if she wasn't already, and Harley moved to block her view of the kid. The woman blinked awake, her eyes unfocused for only a moment. She saw Harley, and snarled, \"you'll regret this, Quinn.\" Harley hummed, smacking the gum in her mouth. \"Y'see,\" Harley told her, kicking the woman's sword across the room so it skittered under the couch, far from the assassin's outstretched hand, \"Red don't take kindly to people hurting her friends.\" \"I didn't hurt her.\" Harley nodded, once, smiling to herself. \"Sure ya didn't. Just like ya didn't kidnap her or anything, right?\" The woman opened her mouth, but Harley cut her off. \"Hon, you might as well give up now. Red told me I couldn't kill you,\" then she lowered her voice, \"not in front of the girl, but you see, this kid means an awful lot to Red, okay? I think it's a pseudo-mother bonding thing. But if you lay a hand on either of 'em, all bets are off!\" Harley visibly brightened, and twirled back ground to see that the kid had seemingly fallen asleep in Red's arms. A baby, Harley thought, the kid was a damn baby . And she didn't mean that unkindly: she simply meant that all there was in Red's arms was a little girl who hadn't been safe for so long she'd probably forgotten what safe sounded like, if Red's accounts of her childhood were anything to go by. And they were. Red claimed they didn't know much, but Harley didn't need much else to fill in the gaps: the rest was textbook, or else deductive reasoning filled in the blanks. A girl from a broken home, suffering in silence, all on her own - who could be blind to that? Certainly not Harley, and certainly not Red.[Chapter 29] A/N: For the record, I will not be picking up any of my abandoned stories. It's possible I may resume posting to this profile, but this is the only story I intend on finishing. I wish I was sorry for it, but too much time has passed for me to do anything but let those stories be. I hope you can understand. Love, J Pamela cradled the girl in her arms, as carefully as one would a newborn. She could feel Harley watching her, but it was of no consequence; what mattered was that Drew, who had looked so sick, disheveled, and out of shorts the last time they'd encountered one another - which had been the first time in years they'd seen each other again - was safe now. She wondered at the wounds on her hands, the state of her body and mind, how the clothes she was in didn't look like they fit right. Pamela could recall meeting Drew for the first time; she'd been there at her school, taking the place of a representative who had access to certain chemicals that she'd needed for her - ahem - research, and part of that meant going along and guest lecturing at an elementary school. Pamela hadn't particularly cared about it until her eyes had found Drew Foster, and then it was over. Maternal instinct, for better or for worse, kicked in. She'd seen the bruises, the wide, scared eyes, the way the girl jumped at loud noises. She had been able to do nothing but offer what little comfort she could to Drew, even when she'd gone to the principal with her concerns. She had always regretted not being able to do more, but she'd discovered, very recently, that Drew had been taken in by the Wayne family, no less, after being removed from her father's home. She only hoped that it had been in time, before Drew was truly lost to the horrors of her childhood. And it seemed that Drew had survived. Drew, with the dark circles under her eyes and sickly pallor. It was as if nothing had changed. Maybe things hadn't. Pamela felt her mouth tighten into a thin, flat line; had the Waynes succeeded in protecting her? Had Drew done this to herself, through the cycle of unfortunate events that had driven her family history into the dirt where her father belonged? She pushed away her guilt; what mattered now was that she had no intention of failing Drew ever again. And she was thankful that Harley had gone along with her with only some questions and absolutely no resistance. If there was someone she could count on, it was Dr. Harleen Quinzel. \"Red,\" Harley whispered loudly, crouching down next to her, \"what're we gonna do now?\" \"I'm not sure,\" Pamela answered. Then her eyes turned to the woman on the floor, who was glaring daggers at the both of them. \"Find out what she was up to.\" \"Gladly!\" Harley straightened up and practically skipped over to the other redhead, smiling so broadly down at her that it was a wonder the woman wasn't blinded by the sheer force of it. \"So!\" she started conversationally, as if they were speaking about knitting and not something so grave, \"what was the plan here, hon? I hope it wasn't ransom, 'cause the only payment you'll be receiving is a mouthful of this.\" She weighed the end of her hammer for emphasis, and Pamela shook her head slightly, a small smile gracing her lips as the woman eyed the end of her hammer nervously. Not fearfully, though - not yet . Harley could get mean when she wanted to. Or did was this strange so unfortunate as to overestimate her own abilities and fortune in the face of two of the most infamous villains Gotham had ever known? The thought alone was amusing, to say the least - moreso to Harley than Pamela, to be sure, but still. \"C'mon, babe,\" Harley said cheerfully, and with one, swift movement had her foot planted directly on the woman's chest. She ground her heel in, making the stranger wincer. \"Out with it! The sooner you tell us, the sooner we'll get out of your hair.\" \"You don't understand,\" the woman began, but Harley simply brought her hammer down, inches from her head, and laughed at the stunned look on her face. \"So if you didn't hurt her, what were ya gonna do with her? Hurt her later? Give her up? Target practice? C'mon, you don't want to make Red ask, do you?\" Lowering her voice to a mockingly conspiratory stage whisper, she said, \"make it quick n' painless for yourself.\" \"It is none of your concern.\" \"Wrong!\" Harley sing-songed, stamping her foot down hard . Pamela found that no part of her could muster up a scrap of sympathy. Harley was going easy on her, as far as she was concerned. Drew's breathing had evened out now. Inspecting her closely, Pamela found that the girl had passed out. She felt a stab of resentment: had the Wayne family let it come to this? Had they let this girl run herself ragged, down to the bone? Had they not taken care of her? Did they even care? Pamela decided she would, even if no one else volunteered. \"Either way,\" Harley said, \"we'll be takin' her off your hands now.\" \"No!\" the woman bit out. \"You can't!\" \"You tellin' me what I can't do? Wrong move, hon.\" \"She was never going to get hurt. I never laid a finger on her. I was going to help her - \" \"Yeah, yeah, yeah,\" Harley said, waving her hand dismissively, \"we've heard this spiel before. We kinda invented it, didn't we, Red?\" she directed the last part over her shoulder, but Pamela didn't smile. \"I mean that,\" the woman sneered. \"She would have gone unharmed. But you've ruined it.\" She glanced over to the window, and Harley followed her gaze, an eyebrow cocked. \"Now it's probably too late to set things in motion.\" \"Too late?\" Harley scoffed. \"For what? You havin' a party or somethin'?\" \"You bitch,\" the woman seethed. \"He's - \" \"Sorry! Can't come to phone right now. Leave a message,\" with a laugh, Harley lifted her foot, and brought it down hard on the woman's face. Pamela didn't even blink as the crunch of cartilage breaking reached her ears; blood began to gush from the woman's nose, and she let out an enraged shriek. \"See ya 'round!\" Harley said, and moved towards Pamela. \"Help me with her,\" Pamela said, but she needn't have said anything; Harley was already hoisting Drew's arm over her shoulder. Together, they went out the door carrying Drew between them. \"That was easy,\" Harley chirped. \"Yes,\" Pamela agreed, wiping the makeup on her face off with her arm. \"It was.\" Whether that would be a good thing or not remained to be seen.[Chapter 30] A/N: 5 chapters in one morning? It just might be safe to say I'm on a role. Love, J Jason hadn't bothered to wait for Dick when he'd relayed the message and location of the source of it to him. He'd simply taken off, with no intention of stopping until he found her. Dick couldn't say he was surprised by this, though it might have been nice for Jason to wait up for him. Nevertheless, he followed as closely behind as he could; Jason was propelled by adrenaline and the need to see Drew alive and well. It was eating at the younger man, Dick could see, even with that helmet in the way; he was more worried than he cared to say and it was going to chip away at him until he was raw with worry. When they made it to the part of town the trace had indicated, they location the payphone and began combing the block from there, going in separate directions as Barbara directed from her place inside the Cave. No place went unchecked. They looked high and low, disappearing through rickety, abandoned corridors until Dick location a building that looked like it had seen signs of life more recent than others. In this part of town, it was hard to say why residents were scarce; he could recall something being said about funding for the re-establishment of assisted housing falling through, thus rendering these buildings inhabitable due to their unstable, unsafe nature. But that didn't mean nobody was around. He crept through the halls, careful to listen for any creaking floorboards or other indicators that he was not alone. Then he heard it: the sound of something being moved below him. He didn't waste any time. \"I might have something,\" he said into his com, wondering if it was too soon to call attention to a thing that could be as trivial as a mouse. \"On my way over,\" Jason grunted over the minor crackling static of slight interference, \"where are you?\" \"A block south of the payphone. Sixth floor, east side; the building with the front entrance caved in.\" \"Got it.\" Dick wasted no time; he darted down the corridor and down the stairwell, making sure to keep his full weight off the creaking, rotting wood as much as he was able. He was better at it than Jason, though, who he heard crash through a window or wall below, causing the rickety building to vibrate with the force of it. He ran and only slowed when he saw a door open at the very end of the hall, dim but sure light coming through from how it was cracked open. He made his way towards it and, when he got closer, he discovered it wasn't a door at all, but something like a curtain of ivy hanging where the door should have been securely on its hinges. A glance around the room told him that the door had been flung from its hinges, it laying bent and broken by the far window by the moth-eaten couch. Then he saw it: movement, out of the corner of his eye. Dick moved just in time to narrowly avoid the swipe of the blue blade that hummed in the space between them. The red hair, the armor, it was familiar to Dick, but he wasn't here to fight; he was here for answers, for Drew - Then Jason came in through the window. \"You again,\" he said to the woman, who froze immediately upon finding herself in his sights, and when she moved towards the doorway to make a hasty escape, Dick intercepted before Jason could make a move. He knew that low note in that voice by now: it could mean nothing good. It could mean death for her if he wasn't watching Jason closely. \"Get away from me,\" the woman snarled, and tried to twist away from Dick - but then Jason moved, so fast he wasn't sure if he'd seen it, and then the woman was on the ground, being crushed under the Red Hood's weight. \"I'll give you five seconds to tell me what you're doing here,\" Jason said, bending low to grip the woman's chin and jerk it sideways to force her eyes to meet his. \"Start talking.\" Behind her mask, there was blood smeared on her face, and she looked enraged. Dick stepped forward to intervene. \"Five,\" Jason said, his voice chillingly even. \"I haven't done anything - \" \"Four.\" \"You monster ,\" she snarled, and for that he lifted her up by her hair and delivered a punch to the gut. The wind went out of her like a balloon losing air. Dick tried not to wince. \"Three.\" Dick opened his mouth to protest, ready to pull her away from him, but Jason angled his body so that she was against the wall, held by her throat in his unforgiving grasp, and Dick could not get to her without directly landing a hit on Jason. He gritted his teeth. \" Two .\" \"If this is about that brat ,\" the woman spat, causing both men to look at her with a renewed sense of intense scrutiny, \"she's gone.\" Jason was silent for a moment. Then: \"you made her call me, didn't you?\" From behind the mask shielding her lower face, Dick could tell that the woman was sneering. He recognized her, then: the leader of the Fearsome Hand of Four. Hadn't they cleared out of town after Jason had killed one of their own? Unless - \"You were going to use her. As bait.\" Jason said it matter-of-factly. \"Yes,\" she seethed. \"In order lure me here - \" \" - so I could kill you.\" Jason was quiet for a moment, then drew her back so he could shove her so hard against the wall that it sounded like the back of her head cracked against it. Dick saw the woman's eyes squeeze shut in a flash of pain. Professional assassin or not, there was no braving the storm that was gathering under Jason's helmet. This man was vicious, propelled by emotion. And Dick wasn't so sure that this woman was going to survive that storm. \"So where is she?\" It wasn't quite phrased as a question, though. And the deadly intent in his voice could be heard by anyone with a brain. \"You going to kill her, too, Red Hood?\" There was a malice in her eyes Dick had only seen a handful of times; it made his stomach twist. \"You'll be dead before she is if you don't tell me - \" \"It's too late,\" she hissed. \"She's already been moved.\" Jason went very, very still. \"Where.\" \"She and I had a deal, see,\" she said, despite his grip tightening around her throat. \"She was going to help me with you, and I was going to help her with Black Mask. Simple.\" \"Black Mask,\" he echoed, sounding unimpressed, but Dick could only imagine how his brother's head was spinning. \"I assume you're after her for the same reason he is - or else, she's pissed you off too.\" \"Tell. Me.\" Dick thought bleakly, he's really going to choke her , and stepped forward to intervene, but Jason's hand shot out, halting Dick in his progress. \"The Joker's whore took her,\" the woman said, her eyes shimmering in the dim light. \"And Poison Ivy, too. Looks like you'll have to go through more than just me to get to her.\" Dick was prepared to say, okay, let her live, let's go, but before he could act, Jason turned and threw her, straight towards the window. \"No!\" Dick exclaimed, horror gripping him tight as she crashed through the glass and went sailing down below. When he got to the ledge, he looked down - and tried to swallow his disgust. She was alive, yes, but bleeding, cracked open like an egg, dragging herself on the sidewalk away from the building. Dick whirled around and ran towards Jason, running him into the wall by gripping his arm with no intention of stopping. \"What do you think you're doing ,\" Dick hissed, \"you're not going to get to Drew by dropping bodies everywhere you go.\" \"You should let me handle her,\" Jason said, \"she's nothing more than a killer.\" \"What does that make you?\" \"I'm going to save Drew,\" Jason said, grunting as he pushed Dick away from him. Both men were breathing hard. \"I'm going to save her any way I can.\" \"You don't have to do it this way.\" Jason said, \"I knew you never had it in you to do what needed to be done, Dick,\" and turned towards the door. \"Murder won't - \" \"Get off your high horse, Dick, and either go home, or help me find her.\" With cold fury, the Red Hood said, \"I'll do this with or without you.\"[Chapter 31] A/N: This is regrettably short, but I wanted to get one last thing posted before I have to go to work. I promise I'll be back later today with another chapter. Love, J Finding Drew's apartment wouldn't have been difficult, but, seeing as how she was thoroughly passed out from sheer exhaustion and what Harley had to guess was shock, they were left with few other options; they ended up calling in, banking on a favor, and received the address. \"Do you think she'll be alright?\" Ivy asked Harley as they shifted Drew between the two of them. \"Oh yeah,\" Harley assured her, shouldering the girl's weight. It was her turn, after all, and they still had a long way to go. It was clean across town, the kid's apartment, but she would do anything for Ivy, and rescuing this girl and getting her home was no bother at all. \"She just needs some rest. Maybe some hot takeout to perk her up when she wakes up.\" \"Chinese?\" \"No, Thai.\" Ivy smiled and led the way. She hoped Drew would really, truly be alright when she became conscious again.[Chapter 32] A/N: I just want you guys to know the title of the document I'm writing in is \"we really doing this huh.\" Love, J When they got to Drew's apartment, she was finally coming around. She'd inadvertently eavesdropped on the tail end of their conversation, but only caught enough to tell her that they weren't going to hurt her. And it was something she already knew, judging by the mere fact that Pamela - Poison Ivy - and Harley Quinn had saved her. And they'd carried her home between them, shouldering her weight unevenly so that one was not left with the burden completely. Pamela had held her while Harley shoved open the window, and the two of them eased a half-conscious Drew into bed after peeling off her clothes and laying clean sheets over her. \"I'm gonna find us some food,\" Harley said, giving them a two-fingered salute before disappearing out of the room. Drew tried to lift her head to watch her go, but the effort was futile; it was as if her body had suddenly gained the moon's weight, or else gravity had become that much stronger since her collapse. It was difficult to keep her eyes open, let alone move, but she felt safe - really, truly safe - for the first time in a long time. Pamela murmured to her softly as she redressed Drew's bandages and smoothed her hair back from her face - when had it come out of its hold? It was easy to reconcile the woman in front of her with the scientist she'd met so long ago, now that she was half-hazy with exhaustion and possibly starvation. Her stomach felt as if it meant to eat its lining if it didn't get anything soon, but she was also too tired to do much more than groan softly at the pain in her belly. Pamela said some things which Drew could hear, others that she couldn't. Mostly they were a variant of the same question: \"what happened to you, Drew?\" to which Drew had no concrete answer in her present state. At one point, she heard Harley come back, and was aware of something hot and spicy but filling being helped down her throat. She blinked blearily at one point to find that Harley was grinning while she said, \"gotch'er nose!\" and tipped back her head. It was strange, finally being lost in the bone-deep exhaustion she felt she'd spent her whole life fighting, when really it had only been the last few days. The broth, lemon-scented with something that was, Drew decided, ginger in nature mixed in, sat warm and low in her belly, filling her, warming her down to her cold toes. At one point, she felt Pamela's cool hand on her forehead, and leaned into the touch. It was something her mother used to do when she was sick as a child, back before things had gotten so bad. Or maybe the had always been that bad, and she simply did not remember or did not want to remember how it was. But, her mother would let her hand cool under a cold faucet and then press it to her daughter's cheeks and forehead; the memory was painful, drawing tears from deep within Drew, and then, of course, though some part of her protested at portraying such weakness in front of witnesses, she began to cry. \"She has a fever,\" she heard Harley say, and tried to cover her face with her blanket. \"Is it her wounds?\" \"I'm not sure.\" At one point, pain drew her out of her fever haze, causing her to wake in the harsh half-light of the room. Harley was swabbing her hands and arms with disinfectant, she realized, but she cried nonetheless. She cried because of the pain; she cried because, while she missed her mother, she hated her too; she cried because she was not alone; she cried because she had to save Jason; and she cried because she still had a deep, cutting sadness that had spent years pooling at the bottom of her being, and it was time to let it out. She cried because it was all she could do. But then the wounds were redressed once again. She felt the soft, damp slide of a washcloth over her skin - first on her face, then the back of her neck, then behind her ears, and then under her shirt. It was cool, at first, but it felt good; she'd been mostly clean since Ana's shower, but she was being taken care of. When was the last time someone had taken care of her? No , her foggy brain amended, when was the last time she'd let someone care for her? Time became irrelevant as exhaustion set in and she was finally allowed to fall asleep without being disturbed. From time to time she would wake up and sip something hot - tea, maybe - or have a new washcloth placed over her forehead, but for the most part she remained floating in darkness. She did not dream. Her memories ached for her to dream, for them to be remembered, but whether it was the fever, sheer exhaustion, or shock from the last few days, she saw nothing but darkness. Part of her was aware when she felt a hand stroke her hair, tucking it away from her face. A very small part of her could sense when the added weight of more blankets settled over her body. But she got lost when she fell into a deep sleep, and didn't come up for air for what she felt was a very long time. Eventually, though, she opened her eyes, and while she felt like hell, and everything in her body protested when she moved, she did not immediately fall back into unconsciousness. Taking this as a sign, she cautiously tested her body's limits by trying to sit up. Though she only made it partway, she could make out shapes in the dark of her room: an empty desk, the shuttered window, a barren bookcase. When she turned her head, she could see that her bedroom door was cracked open; light streamed in from under it, and she immediately felt the urge to pull the covers back over her head and hide her dark-adjusted eyes. She swore it wasn't her imagination when her brain caught on a murmur: women's voices, pitched soft and low, were carrying towards her, but she could not hear what they were saying. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed since she'd been brought back to her apartment, but it all came back to her eventually: she watched the shadow of the sun move until the room grew completely dark, signaling that I was night. She had been with Ana. Ana had wanted to use her for bait to kill Jason. She had been rescued. And now she had to save Jason. Her body creaked in protest as she turned over on her side. She immediately regretted the action, remembering how she'd thrown herself off a goddamn roof in order to get away from Black Mask's henchmen, and winced. How many injuries had she culminated in the last few days alone? When she managed to pull her hands from the sheets, she saw they had been bandaged neat and new; when she peaked under her shirt - a shirt she was positive she hadn't worn out of the apartment - she saw that her ribs were taped; when she pulled her sleeve aside, she saw a huge, nasty bruise that seemed to crawl over her shoulder, it was so big she couldn't see where it ended on her back no matter how much she craned her neck. And her head hurt, though it was a vague, distant pain, and her throat was dry. Not to mention she couldn't imagine getting to her feet and putting weight on her calves after so many hours of running around Gotham. If there wasn't a part of her that hurt, it ached, and if there wasn't a part of her that ached, well, she expected that it would soon. The smell of Thai food reached her nose, and she sat up abruptly, pain shoved to the back of her mind in favor of her stomach making a tremendous grumbling sound. It hurt to realize just how hungry she was. It was impossible to say when she'd eaten something solid, last - a day? Two? More? And she was considering lurching out of bed to get to the smell of the food, consequences be damned, but when she moved, her ribs seemed to cry out, and she was forced to lie back down to minimize the discomfort. And then she realized she had to pee. Great , she said, just great , and although it took a great deal of effort to do it, she managed to peel herself out of bad. Standing was worse than she thought it be; the stress on her legs already felt like too much, but her bladder felt like it was going to explode, so she hobbled over to the closet-sized bathroom, squeezed inside, and shut the curtain-like door behind her. When she was done, she practically fell back into bed, not having the wherewithal to successfully climb back into bed like a normal, functioning person. Pamela and Harley were still talking, it sounded like, and either hadn't heard her unsteady steps make the apartment creak or they'd decided to give her space. Either way, she curled into a ball as she pulled the blankets back over her body. She was still so, so tired, but it felt like she'd actually gotten some real sleep for the first time in, well ever . But when she decided that enough was enough, Drew opened her mouth to call out to them; all that came from her mouth was a croak. Panic shot through her, irrational thoughts taking hold for a brief moment: where was her voice? Why couldn't she speak? What happened? Had something happened - \"Hey, darlin',\" a voice said, and then Harley was in front of her, smiling kindly, smoothing Drew's dark hair away from her face, \"you're okay.\" Pamela was standing behind her, leaning against the doorframe. They'd turned the light directly outside her door off, but she knew that another light must have been turned on, because, while her eyes weren't hurting, she was still adjusting to the light exposure. Harley brought a glass of water to Drew's lips, and the girl drank greedily until there was none left. \"What happened?\" she managed to rasp. \"How long was I...\" she coughed, nearly choked on her own spit, and accepted another glass of water. \"How long was I out?\" \"Oh, not long,\" Harley said, as casual as she could be, \"maybe seven hours max.\" \"Seven hours...\" Slowly, slowly, it was dawning on Drew. And then: \"oh no.\" It came out as a whisper, but she was suddenly trembling like leaf. Jason. What about Jason? So much time had passed that there was no way to tell what had transpired. He could be dead , she thought, and felt worry flare up in her. \"Uh, uh, hon,\" Harley said, wagging her finger in Drew's face, pulling her from her panic. \"I know that look on your face, and you're not going nowhere until you get your strength back.\" Drew tried to protest, but she did feel weak, and tired, like her bones had been dug up after being crushed for so long under the earth, but she also felt restlessness begin to pull at her, too. \"I know you want to get moving,\" Pamela said, causing Drew to look to her, \"but first,\" she said, smiling a sad, familiar smile, \"I think we need to talk.\" Drew blinked. \"Let's start with the Red Hood,\" Pamela said. \"How'd you get mixed up with him?\" Her voice was gentle, devoid of judgement; it was a tone Drew instinctively knew she could trust. \"That's easy,\" she said, her voice still hoarse from disuse, \"he's my best friend.\" \"Come again?\" Harley peered at her closely. \"He came back from the dead, and I've got to save him.\" Harley and Pamela exchanged glances before Harley said slowly, as if to make sure Drew understood her perfectly, \"he don't need savin', sugar. How 'bout we worry about you right now?\" Drew opened her mouth to protest, but Harley shook her head firmly. Pamela and Harley, Drew could see, were beginning to be filled up with questions. But there was only one thing on her mind now that she was conscious, and that was Jason. Where was he? And how could she get to him in time?[Chapter 33] A/N: So like... when are y'all gonna start leaving reviews. (\"Please update\" doesn't count. I need to know you guys are actually out there.) \"You can't go rushin' out like that,\" Harley said when Drew tried to explain why she had to leave without revealing too much detail. Her panic, however, could not be contained: Jason could be dead. And this time she had a chance to stop it - or, at the very least , do something. \"Have you seen yourself, puddin'? You can hardly walk.\" Drew shook her head. \"That doesn't matter,\" she bit out, \"I don't give a damn if this kills me. You have to understand: I don't know what I'd do if I lost him again.\" Pamela's expression was tender in the half-light of the room, but it was shadowed by a pensiveness Drew could not recall every witnessing from her childhood. \"You're recovering from your injuries,\" she began carefully. \"You've probably still gotta rocover from shock,\" Harley interjected. \"Just what exactly have you gotten yourself into?\" Pamela said. Drew looked at her - really looked at her - and saw that the pensiveness she'd thought she'd seen on the woman's face was actually something else. It wasn't something she could exactly put a name to, but it was a look she'd seen on quite a few adults in her life - especially in adolescence. Pamela looked like she was full of questions, questions that would hurt Drew to think about, let alone come up with an answer for; they were questions that were sharp, and they twisted deep once they were in the air between Drew and the one asking. With that look on her face, Drew had to guess what Pamela wanted to ask her. Out of the corner of her eye, when she saw Harley, she knew that Harley had even more questions - but was kind enough not to dish them all out in one go. \"Drew...\" Pamela took a deep breath. Drew steeled herself, bracing for impact. \"...I'm sorry I wasn't there for you.\" That made Drew wince. \"I wish - I should have done something more for you.\" Drew tried to smile, but it was a cracked, broken thing that shaped her lips. \"I made it out okay.\" Pamela pressed her lips into a thin line for a moment before speaking. \"Were you...taken care of?\" Drew blinked. What? And was that guilt she saw in Pamela's face? \"Wayne,\" the woman known as Poison Ivy clarified, \"did he... was he good to you? His sons?\" \"You think - ?\" Drew blinked dumbly; her mouth had fallen open before she could stop it. \"You look awful,\" the doctor went on, \"and I don't mean to sound cruel when I say that. What I mean is that... it doesn't look like anyone took care of you.\" Her eyes went to Drew's hands, and Drew flushed, embarrassment creeping through her, remembering her rashness. Softly, Pamela said, \"it doesn't look like you took care of yourself.\" \"Wayne isn't to blame,\" Drew said after taking a deep breath in order to steady herself. She felt strangely empty, now that she was awake; it took her a moment to remember that she'd cried her heart out when Pamela had rescued her from Ana, and that sent a jolt through her, a series of emotions twisting in her like a knife. So quiet she was sure they wouldn't hear, she murmured, \"I think I did it to myself.\" \"Hon,\" this time Harley spoke, and it caused both Pamela and Drew to look at her, \"you're just a kid. You weren't supposed to take care o' yourself.\" Drew ordinarily would have bristled at that. Part of her did, though the rest knew that Harley was speaking the truth. \"You're a baby,\" Harley went on, reaching out to rest her hand on Drew's shoulder, which Drew could not help but lean into, \"you deserve to be safe.\" I'm not going to cry again. I'm not going to. I swear . \"This wasn't their fault,\" Drew said, lifting her hands. Even though she still resented them somewhat for keeping such secrets from her, she knew it was her fault if she should blame them. \"I went and did this before I could think it through.\" Harley gave her a lopsided grin. \"You sound like you don't think anything through. My kinda girl,\" and she winked, too, and Drew smiled - a real, soft, albeit small smile - because she felt, finally, for the first time in what might have been ever, safe in her own apartment, with these two women in the same room as her. \"Then whose was it?\" Pamela asked. \"That woman,\" she said, meaning Ana, \"what did she want with you?\" \"I was...\" Drew faltered, lost for words. What could she say? How could she say it? Hi Pamela! My best friend turned out to be the second Robin, and he may or may not have died but he's back now and he's a murderer, and Ana was going to use me as bait in order to kill him since she thinks he's after me! Also: Black Mask wants my head, or something. How's your night going? Drew heaved out a sigh. \"Please,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper, \"don't try to keep me here. I have to save him.\" \"We won't force you to do anything,\" Pamela assured her, \"but...I just want the best for you, is all.\" Drew blinked. \"I want you to be safe,\" Pamela explained. \"I want you to be happy.\" Happy . When Drew thought of happy, she thought of Jason. Her heart skipped a beat at that. \"If you really want to go,\" Pamela said, \"we won't stop you.\" She smiled, but it looked like it hurt her to do so. \"We'll even help you - that is if you want us to.\" \"Just say the word an' we're with ya, puddin',\" Harley said. Drew nodded. \"Okay.\" More forcefully, she said, \"okay. Let's get to work.\" \"Where do we start?\" Harley asked. Drew wavered, then said, looking down at her hands, \"I have to make a phone call.\" ","Summary":" Disclaimer! A/N: greetings, HUMANITY! :D I'm here with yes another story (i hope this one sticks wi"},{"Movie":"Young Guns","Title":"Billy the Kid","Author":"Goonie-Gal","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7610011","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I pulled up a chair to the table. My family was sitting around, my dad with a deck of cards. My older brother has a pair of sunglasses, and my younger sister, has a blank look. I lean back in the chair as my dad deals the cards, no expression on my face that could be read. I looked at Mom. Her mouth was ever so slightly cracked up in a smile as she lifted her hand. My older brother, Seth, lifted his cards slightly off the table. I couldn't see his eyes, but somehow, the way he set his cards down, the way he forced himself to breathe… I knew he didn't have a good hand. My little sister, Ellen, set her cards down. For only being 12, she knew how to play poker. My dad was the best out of the family. Then came me, my bro, my mom, and then finally little Ellen. We tossed our chips in the middle of the table. My eyes flickered to each player, catching every movement, every hidden sigh of relief or frustration. My dad called me Hawkeye. My eyes caught everything. I could even read some people's feelings from a look in there eye. That's why my brother wore sunglasses. My mom and Ellen didn't believe it, and my dad was to good. I sat there dragging my finger across my cards in a slow, steady motion. My dad looked at his cards… and a flicker of disappointment crossed his eye, but he soon had control. He put two red chips in without a word. A bluff. My eyes snapped over to Seth, who looked at the red chips, then his cards. He tossed to more down. Now, being Hawkeye, I could also control what my eyes gave away, or hid. But now, they were completely calm, unreadable, and starring straight at my dad. The others isn't what I had to worry about… it was my dad. Without a look at my cards, I slid two red chips in the deck… and raised it twenty. The others followed, and my mom folded. Again, we went around putting chips in the pile. Ellen folded, when the stakes got to high, something my dad told her to do when you're a beginner. Seth raised it another twenty. I desperately wanted him to throw the sunglasses off, so I could see his eyes, tell a bluff from the truth. My dad laid down his cards. He had a full house, he looked up, wondering if anyone had beaten him. As no one moved, a sly smile crept across Seth's face. He slammed his cards down. \"YES! BEAT THAT! I BEAT DAD!\" Seth yelled, standing up, \"IN YOUR FACE!\" Four of a kind, shown under his hand. \"Shut your trap and sit down.\" Dad said calmly. Seth did so a wide grin on his face. They all looked at me, my face blank. Seth's smile got wider. I blinked once, twice, starring at Seth's cards. I sighed, and laid my cards down, face down. Seth's smiled as he looked at them, then I turned the cards over… one by one. Jack…Ten… Seth's smile faded a little. And my dad frowned…. Nine… eight… the last card, and everyone held there breath. I turned it, and lifted my hand away… seven… all spades. Seth's smile turned completely, and his shoulders slumped. \"Straight flush.\" I said quietly. Seth crossed his arms, and leaned back, without a word. I raked my winnings into a bag, for safe keeping until the next game tomorrow night. I stuck my tounge out at Seth who scowled back. I tossed the bag into a drawer in my room, and flopped down on my bed. Dinner would be ready soon, and Ellen was leaving for a friends house. I hoped I didn't have to drive her. Seth would be leaving for the movies with a few friends later tonight, and coming back late. Dad would be leaving for work, and mom would go to bed early for early work in the morning. I would be left in my room like always, left to my own business. I grabbed my sketchbook and pencil, next to a tan paper hung on my wall. It was a certificate labeled directly to Elisha Young… me. SASS. Single Action Shooting Society. Certificate of completion. Organ Trail Rough Riders presents this to Elisha Young for participation in the OTTR Cowboy action shooting 101 clinic. It was a group of people who dressed up like the Old West and went shooting. I was the youngest kid there. I went with my dad on Saturdays for fun. I loved it. All there guns were never automatic… all 1800's or less. I liked the pistols and rifle. Shotgun wasn't my favorite… but I could feel the power in it when I picked it up. At the Action shoot, we had the forth fastest person in the world, and the 88th fastest person in the world there. The forth saw I was a kid, and decided to show me a few tricks, and teach me a few things… work with me. But now he's starting to regret it playfully. I had already passed half the men in time and accuracy. I was the youngest there, but certinatly not the slowest or weakest. In my spare time, the 88th fastest taught me how to twirl a pistol. I learned how to identify guns… even the sound of the shot. I was just learning to identify the hammer click… but that was hard. Anyway… I turned the pages until I came to a blank page in my sketch book. I gripped the pencil, and started to sketch. There where three people in my mind to draw. One… the sheriff. He was holding a pistol, and eyes wide. The pistol was aimed at another person… an outlaw. His hands were shackled together, his hat down, covering his eyes… but his smile clearly visible. Why you may ask, is the sheriff's eyes wide, and the outlaw smiling? Easy… because the third person, was behind the sheriff, a long Winchester rifle in hand, and against the sheriffs back. I smiled as I drew. My mom's rang down the hall and into my room. \"DINNER!\" I sighed, and shut my book. I set it down on the bed, and headed out to the kitchen. My dad was at the head of the table, while Seth was sitting next to him, arms crossed, sunglasses off. He was pouting because he had almost won… but I slipped under and grabbed the trophy. I did that a lot lately. I was getting better. I sat down as mom set the table. 'ELLEN!\" My mom called again, \"TURN OFF THE TV! IT\"S DINNER TIME!\" I heard the T.V buzz off, and the stomping of Ellen racing up the stairs to the kitchen. She plopped down in her seat next to me, and Mom set a plate full of food in front of her. My stomach growled. Mash potatoes, juicy steak, corn, and green rice. My mom sat down, wipping her hands off on a towel, and we all grabbed hands. My dad prayed out loud, and we all said amen. Seth passed the gravy down, and Ellen passed the salt and pepper. I noticed my mom forgot the steak knives, and I got up and took out five from the drawer. I sat back down again, and began to eat. \"So this Saturday, I don't have work. So, Elisha, we can to the shoot out.\" My dad said, slicing his steak. \"Can I go this time?\" Ellen asked. My dad chuckled and shook his head. \"Sorry Ellen.\" Dad said, \"Not this time. Your still to small.\" \"But Elisha started shooting younger then me!\" Ellen protested. \"Yeah… with a bb.\" Seth added. \"Come on dad, you won't even let ME go with you guys.\" \"Because you guys have never handled a gun!\" My mother added, \"Elisha had. Seth, you go to the motor cross to race every Saturday. And Ellen, you have ballet. You all have different talents and intrests.\" \"Cept horseback riding.\" Ellen said, smiling. My dad chuckled. \"Which reminds me, you riding lessons tomorrow have changed times. We'll be leaving at seven instead of nine thrity.\" \"Aw mom!\" Seth complained, \"I gotta get up THAT early? Come on, the sun isn't even up by then!\" \"The sun is up long before you twitch an eye, Seth.\" I said. \"hey,\" Seth argued, \"don't be talking. You always wake up early, it's easy for you. But I got to sleep. I'll get grumpy if I don't.\" \"so you obviously didn't get enough sleep last night.\" I said. Seth frowned. Ellen smiled and stuck a tongue out at him. \"Mom!\" Seth cried. \"Ellen.\" My mom warned, seeing the tongue. \"Not at the dinner table. And Seth, stop shouting.\" \"And Elisha, stop being a snob.\" Seth added. \"Seth.\" My dad said, his voice deep. Seth growled and continued to eat. \"I saw Jack today.\" Ellen said, \"He was at the store. But he didn't see me.\" \"that's because you were hiding.\" I said. \"Ellen and Jack, sitting in a tree…\" Seth started… and I joined in. \"K,I,S,S,I,N,G.\" we said together. Ellen kicked me under the chair, and I kicked Seth. Me and Seth smiled. \"What?\" Ellen asked, \"I do NOT Like him!\" \"Oh please, you always talk about him!\" Seth said. \"And when he talks to you, you blush and flutter your eyes.\" I set my fork down, and turned to Seth. \"Oh, Jack, you're so adorable!\" I said, fluttering my eyes. \"Oh Ellen, I love you too!\" Seth said, curling his shoulders up. \"Oh stop it!\" Ellen hissed. \"I do not like him.\" Me and Seth rolled her eyes. \"So how was your day mom and dad.\" I asked, picking up my fork again. \"Well, nothing special here. Today was the most boring day I've had all week.\" Mom my said. \"Well my day was different.\" Dad explained. \"You know that kid I was telling you about? He got mad cause a radio staion got banned?\" we all nodded, \"Well, he talked to me today, and he's trying to get me to listen to it.\" \"Did you?\" Seth asked. \"Yeah.\" My dad said, \"Didn't understand a word. It was all screaming.\" \"I don't like that music. I can't believe those bands even have a voice after all that.\" \"They don't.\" my dad said. \"Hey mom.\" Seth started in, \"I have a ride to the track Saturday. I was wondering if I could sleep over Joe's house. He could give me a ride home the next day to.\" \"Sure. What time will you be back?\" Mom said. \"12… midnight.\" He said. Dad shook his head. \"You be back here around 12 noon.\" Dad said. Seth frowned but said nothing. \"can I have a sleep over to?\" ellen asked. Mom brushed her hand through her hair and nodded. We continued dinner, talking over our week, and planning anything knew this week. After dinner, Seth was sent to clean the kitchen, while I went down stairs to watch Young Guns… one of my favorite movies. The intro to the movie always got me excited. Seth finished the kitchen and came down to watch it with me. Ellen was in her room playing with her dolls. She wasn't allowed to watch this movie. When it was over, it was time for bed. It was weird. I had never felt like this after the movie. I wanted to watch it over and over again, yes that was normal, but I wanted more… I wanted to see more. I couldn't stop thinking about it. I tossed and turned in bed, thinking of the movie and Billy the Kid. When I finally actually went to sleep… I still felt restless. I woke up again.. very uncomfortable. My back ached, and my neck hurt. Maybe I just dozed. I forced myself to keep my eyes shut, and tried to relax. I still tossed and turned. I fell asleep, but woke up twice. I still forced my eyes shut and tried to go to sleep. Finally, I gave up. I wondered what time it was, but I was to lazy to turn over and look at the clock. I sighed. Suddenly, I heard noise from outside my room. Was Seth up already? Had I actually gotten more sleep then I thought? I finally turned to look at my clock, only… it wasn't there. Neither was my lamp, my cell phone or car keys. They should all be sitting on my nightstand… but there was no nightstand. I opened my eyes wider, and my blood ran cold. My room. It wasn't brown and tan… with the furniture. It was blank… all old oak wood. I looked at the bed, and threw the covers off and jumped out. The bed was more of a cot. The blankets were itchy thrashed and tangled from my tossing. No wonder I couldn't sleep. Altogether… I wasn't in my room. Not in my house. The noise came aigain from outside my door. I spun around, half expecting someone to come through. My heart pounded and my eyes were wide with horror. I had been kidnapped.[Chapter 2] I stood there, my feet cold on the wood floor, starring at the door. I was still dressed in my clothes. I had never changed into my pjs. I was in Jeans and a t-shirt. I thought of mom, of dad. They would call the police as soon as they found me missing. The police would find me. Where was I anyway? I scuttled in the corner, fear gripping my body. Think, Elisha… I had to think. Think hard, calm down and concentrate. What was I going to do? I took a deep breathe and tried to clear my mind. Why did they kidnap me? What did they want? Who where they? They were going to kill me. No! Don't think that. Think how to get away. I looked around. A window. Well that was dumb. These guys didn't know how to kidnap, I guessed. So they were dumb. Keep that in mind. I crawled over to the window, careful to keep my ears focused on the door. I pushed the window. Locked. Ok, so they weren't that dumb. If I broke it, they would hear, and come rushing in. Plus I would get all bloody trying to get out through the broken glass. So the door was the only way out. Great. I looked at it, before crawling over. My mind was blank, and my blood tingled. My stomach was tight as I tried the doorknob. Unlocked. I slowly craked the door, and peeked out. Two men were sitting out in the main room. It was an odd looking room, like a cabin. There was no rugs or high powered lights. Everything was bade out of wood. And the men themselves were odd. One wore a white shirt with a tan vest. Snake skin boots pocked out from the brown pants. The other wore dark blue pants, with a striped blue and white flimsy shirt… and a dark brown vest. He too wore cowboy boots. They were both wearing cowboy hats, and looked dirty. Must be on some type of ranch. Great… a ranch… far from any help. I shut the door, and slid down the wall. I huddled my knees, and buried my face. Tears spilled down my face in silent crying. I soaked my white shirt, and kept crying. I started cursing myself for not feeling them kidnap me. I swore, and started to get angry. My tears stopped, and now my eyes were ablaze with rage. I wasn't going to give up. No. I could get out of this… just be smart. I was on a ranch, probably miles from anywhere. I could get out and find a car… nope… keys were on the lest for that one. I wouldn't get keys anytime soon. I took a deep breathe again, and calmed down. I tried again. I'm on a ranch… I didn't see a phone… and even if I did I wouldn't be able to call. Not enough time to dial and talk. They would probably catch me… and kill me. NO! STOP IT! I ordered myself. Think! This time I took a few more breathes. And took a few minuets to clear my mind. Try again. I'm on a ranch… a ranch…a ranch. Nothing came to me. I started to cry again. I grinded my teeth, and brushed the tears away. THINK! THINK, THINK, THINK! I'm on a RANCH. A ranch.. wait a second… a ranch! Ranches had horses! My heart lifted. I knew how to ride a horse. But ride him bareback? I wasn't to sure if I could do that. But I was going to take a chance for that. Ok, back to the window. I looked around outside, as the sun peeked up over the horizon. It was a ranch alright. There was the main house… which I was in. Then there were four more wooden buildings. A small wooden pen held a pig by what looked like the barn. Then another larger one held cattle. It was actually kind of funny. The horses were tied up on the cattle fence. They were saddled and ready to ride. But something caught my eye… there was three horses… and I only saw two men. I took a deep breathe, then stopped. Wait, how was I going to get out to the horses. I clenched my fists. My perfect plan was ruined! No, no it wasn't. It's to perfect to be ruined. Just open the door, run straight out. You saw the door, maybe about four yards in the other direction where the men stood and talked. Just run out and jump on the horse. Easy. I tiptoed to the door. And peeked out again. I took a deep breathe, letting if fill my lungs, and let it out. Ok… on three. One… two… THREE! I swung the door wide open and bolted out the door. As I burst out the front door one man's voice came to my ears. \"What the…\" he said. But I was gone. I ran straight for the horses. Amazingly they didn't panic at the fast movment, which I had expected. I snapped the ropes off the posts and scattered all but one. I jumped on the horses back. I had picked the one that looked the fastest. A black mare. I jerked it around, and kicked it into action. It took off at an amazing speed. The saddle was surprisingly comfortable and the horse was actually well trained. It bolted out of the ranch land, and a smile bust across my face. I had done it. I had escaped. I looked back in front of me. A vast waste land lay ahead of me, and a dusty dirt road. Well, the road had to lead to somewhere, and that's where I was going. A few hills passed by as the horse ran. I few looks back, and I knew no one was following me. Good. I pulled the horse to a slower trot, and continued down the road. The sun was high over head when I heard my stomach grumbled. I frowned. Great. I looked up. No sigh of anything up ahead. I stopped and dismounted. I looked through the saddle bags, hoping to find something. I was surprised to find bacon and hard biscuits wrapped in wax paper. The bacon needed to be cooked, and the biscuits only had a hard crust. I looked at the sun. The heat beat down on me, threatening to take my energy. Thirsty. I was thirsty. There was a canteen hung on the bags. It was half empty… or half full. I was a bit hesitant to drink from someone else's canteen, but the sun's heat forced it to my lips. The water was cool against my throat. And I took my fill. It was actually amazing I found all the stuff I needed on the horse. It made me think there was a reason they had packed this much. Like the trip to civilization was long. I decided to save the food until tonight. I pushed my hunger aside, and started off again. I had plenty of time to think… about everything. About Seth, Ellen, mom and dad. It made me appreciate them more… love them more… MISS them more. I felt like crying again, but I held back. I had to save any water I had. I didn't know how long this was going to take. I didn't know if I was over reacting or what, but to me, it was better safe than sorry. For the first time, I realized I could die out here. I looked around. Me… an average girl who got kidnapped, and escaped, but ended up dying in the middle of nowhere. What a wonderful life. I shivered and hung my head. I had a wonderful life before this… and now I had a chance of dying out here. I suddenly straightened my shoulders, and lifted my head. No. I WILL get through this. I had to. I kicked the horse into a fast trot. How long the horse would hold out? I didn't know. It would probably start to slow down by the end of the day. The sun fell, and the horse kept the pace easily. It breathed hard, yes, but it didn't seem exhausted like I expected. This horse was good. I looked up ahead, wondering if I should go on through the night. Could I stay on the saddle sleeping? Probably not. But I couldn't just stop anywhere. They goons might came after me, if they ever did. So I slowed the horse down, but did not stop. It was after the sun disappeared did I realize how tired I was. With the restless night before, and a hard day, I was as tired as ever. I was beginning to doze off when something caught my attention. I jerked up, and listened hard. A river? A creak? Water. I picked up the pace and headed toward water. The horse's ears flickered toward the sound. There was tall brush coming into view, and when I was in the middle of it, a clear fresh water creak ran in front of me. I jumped off the horse and grabbed my canteen. I raced over to the water and filled it up. And then crouched over and drank straight from the creak. The water was cold and felt good in my dry mouth. I leaned back, satisfied. I would stay here the night. Hidden by the brush and night, with the river to cover any other sound the horse or I made. I pulled the blanket off the back off the saddle and unrolled it. I would have to deal with laying on the ground for tonight. I think I fell asleep before I hit the ground, completely forgetting about hunger.[Chapter 3] When I woke up, two things came to my attention. One… my stomach now felt like caving, and I had forgotten to tie the horse up. I sat up, and looked over the brush. The sun was just barley finished rising, giving me a beautiful sunrise with fresh morning air. Well, at least that was something to be happy about. But I didn't smile. I was still lost… no idea where I was… or how'd I get home. I missed my family. I Stood up, wondering how I would get the horse back, when I heard one behind me. I snapped around, thinking they had found me. But it was the one I had taken. Still standing my the creak. I slumped down in utter amazement. The horse had stayed there the whole night, without being tied up. It didn't take off, it didn't doze nothing. I rolled the blanket up after a good shake, and tied it as best I could back on the saddle. I fount matches and broke a few pieces of brush off and tossed them in a pile. I soon had a fire going in the chilly morning, and tried best I could to cook the bacon. I had six pieces of bacon and four biscuits before I was well enough to keep riding. I found a knife in the saddle bags, and cut a nice round hole in the ground next to the brush. Knowing the dirt would be soft, but the roots would keep the dirt all together, I pulled the piece out. I set it on top of the died out fire. This held two reasons. One.. it would keep any surviving flame from spreading… and two.. the ground was cold and in putting it over the spot where I had the fire, would keep any good trackers from telling how long ago the fire was put out. Something I had learned in the Action shoot. I wasn't taking any chances, and took precaution as I left. I almost felt proud, that I was smart enough to cover my tracks this well. And amazed that such knowledge actually came in handy. Who knew. As I rode, I kept looking over my shoulder, wondering if they would follow. My eyes scanned the hills nearby, and anything in my surrounding. Nothing. I was doing pretty good for such a young kid . As the day wore on, I began to think of what I would do when I got home. I would take on a caton full of ice cream. Oh yeah. Then I would get on the computer and tell on my friends about what happened, and how I had escaped and traveled! Except Taylor. I wouldn't tell her over IM. No way. I could never understand her instant messenger talk. I would have to call her. Her number was saved on my cell phone at home. Speed dial number 14. Then I would take a bath. I looked down. My white shirt was no longer a pure white. I had sweated, and slept in the dirt… so it was anything but clean. I wanted a bath pretty badly. I soon got boared of thinking over and over again what I would do when I got rescued. I let the reigns loose to find out exactly how good this horse was. A normal horse would wander off the road… but not this one. I sighed, getting bored again. I wondered if this wonder saddle held anything else. Like cards. I rummaged through the bags. I found the knife, bacon and biscuits. The matches, a few tin cups and lots more on one side. When I turned to the other side, my arm hit something solid. I pulled back, looked. I didn't see anything. I reached down and felt again, and again, the hard thing hit my hand. Whatever it was it was almost completely hidden behind the saddle and saddle bags, and slid into a long leather pouch. I reached inside and pulled it out. I froze, even the horse stopped, feeling my tension. I now held the rifle in the air, my eyes wide. They carried GUNS on there horses? Ok, these men were no normal ranchers or kidnappers. This was bad. They were murderers! I checked to see if it was loaded, and for a second, I was temped to try my aim on horseback. But I would probably spook the horse. I tapped the horse back into movement, I slid it back in the leather case. A little jittered. Maybe they kept a gun to protect themselves out here. Maybe it was just a safety precausion. I bit my lip . A safety precasuion for WHAT? A little shaken up, continued looking in the bags. Still nothing interesting. I looked over my shoulder again, and this time… my eye caught movement up on the rocky hill. My eyes sharpened and I starred hard. I could barely make out the shape of a hat against all the rock. My mind wondered to the rifle again. If I needed to protect myself… I would. Those kidnappers would deal with who they kidnapped. Just the thought of those men this close to me scared me. I wanted to run for it, but I knew they would follow. They would have to know who they were dealing with. Again, I pulled out the rifle, acting like I was itching my leg. If it would spook the horse, oh well. I looked at the hat again. It was easier then the Flat Shots on the shoot out, so I should hit my target. Just blow his hat off. I calmed my heart, feeling it against my chest like it would just jump out any second. Would this work? I never shot at a person before. What if my aim was just a little off? Then, suddenly, quicker then the eye could blink, I swung the rifle around, cocking it at the same time, aimed and fired. The shot rang out, and the horse just jumped, his ears jerking back to me. This horse was good. Probably used to all the gun shots. Great. So these guys used a gun a lot. I began to feel like I was no match for them. The hat flew off, and the head ducked down. I cocked the gun instantly and fired again. Then, with some difficulty, I turned back around, and kicked the horse into full gallop. I had a hard time putting the rifle back in full speed, but I had to concentrate on going fast. And that was hard enough without the rifle in hand. Finally, I slammed it back in and kicked the horse even faster. If that was possible. And it was. I pushed it at that pace for about a half hour. Half because I was scared, and just wanted to keep going no matter what. But mostly because I wanted to get to a town. I wanted to feel safe again. I didn't was to be exposed out in the open to those killers! But then, I felt a touch of something else. Something I hand't expected to feel, and it scared me. It was excitement. The feeling of the wind brushing my hair out of my face, riding as fast as you could away from danger. It reminded me of the old western movies I watched. But a thought of getting killed if I slowed down kept me from smiling. But I did. Not because of the feeling, but because of what I saw. Up ahead, just barely visible… looked like some type of town… a city. I kept the horse heading straight for it. As I got closer, I began to get puzzled. It was a town, yes. But not a big one… and it was all wood. No cement, no glass, just wood. They were all lined up along the road with wood walkways… it looked just like an old western town. People walked about doing there buiness as I rode in. They all dressed like it to. The girls and women all wore dresses and shalls. The men even wore holsters with guns. Probably loaded. It wasn't to strange to me, because it reminded me of the action shoot I went to with my dad. But these guys REALLY took it seriously. Dang, if this place was close enough, me and my dad would have to come our here. I felt in place when I dismounted the horse and tied him off next to the other horses. Ok, first of all, I would have to find a phone. Call my dad. I walked down the walkway, avoiding making eye contact. I didn't know anyone, and I didn't know if anyone here would recognize me as the kidnapped. As I walked, the people suddenly disappeared. They run in stores and shut the door, and closed the curtains. I was left in the suddenly deserted town, still looked for a phone. Then I saw a man out in the road. He was a decent looking man, and even better, I saw a sheriff star on his shirt. Wow, these guys were actually organized. Wonder why they called there company? And why hadn't I heard of them before? I was about to call out to him, when he suddenly jerked his hand toward his gun. A shot rang out, and I stopped dead. The sheriff sputtered, and fell down, a red spot growing on his shirt. Blood. I looked down the street, and a young boy, about my age, stood there, pistol pointed and smoking. Wow! That was the best action play I ever saw! I waited for the applause but instead I gasped. No. This has to be a play. A stage. Practiced. But I heard the sheriff take his last breath, I saw his eyes glaze over. I felt that feeling of death in the air… and for feeling if for the first time… I didn't like it. People rushed out, racing toward the boy and the sheriff both. Ok, these people took the western theme TOO seriously. My breath seemed to come short, and I had to look away. I stumbled backwards. There was a gallow next to the building I was at. A body hung from the noose, a brown woven bag over his head. I started to sweat, and I turned away. There was a poster in the window. It was a picture of a piece of candy. Underneath it, it said 'best tasting candy of 1876' in big black letters. No way. I wanted to buckle. I wanted to fall. But I locked my knees, and clenched my fists. No. I was going to get a hold of dad, and get out of here. This place was crazy. I turned around, facing the street again. The boy that shot, was being shackled, and the sheriff was being carried away. A man walked up to me, and a quick glance at the silver star, said he was deputy. \"Did you see what happened miss?\" he asked me. I felt faint, the memory fresh. I nodded. \"Do you mind taking your sights to court then?\" he asked. Court? You mean they were going to decide to hang that boy or to let him go? And I would decide that with my word? My knees buckled, and the man caught me. \"Whoa… hey! We need a doctor! You ok miss?\" He turned back to me. My eyes shut, and I blacked out.[Chapter 4] When I woke up, I was in an office of some sort. And knowing my western movies, I made out it was the sheriff's office. I was laying on a bench with a blanket and pillow. The deputy saw me wake up, and walked over. He hand me a cup of water, and I drank it down. 'Where'd you come from?\" the deputy asked. \"I haven't see you around, and you looked like you've been out there a long time.\" I looked at him. Maybe he was one decent guy in the wacko place. \"Longer then I wanted to be.\" I said. \"I haven't had food for two days. And I want to contact my parents.\" The deputy nodded. \"I'll get a telegram out here and some food. You just stay put and rest.\" He said. He stood up and walked out. I finished off the glass, and set it back down. I leaned back and thought. Why hasn't the police found out about this place? These people should all me put behind bars! \"I have to get out of here.\" I said. \"That makes two of us.\" Said a voice. I looked up. But saw no one. I peeked around the back doorway, and saw bars. The jail. I stood up and peeked around. The boy I had seen was leaning back on the cot, his hands behind his head, and hat over half his face. His feet were crossed and he looked just as dirt as I was. I froze. It was the boy who shot the sheriff. I knew I should be afraid… but for some odd reason… I wasn't. He didn't seem like the kind of guy who would murder someone. In fact he seemed to know that, and looked quite comfortable where he sat. \"Why'd you shoot the sheriff?\" I asked before I could stop myself. The boy scoffed, and turned his half hidden face my way. Still not showing his face he answer with a smile. \"Cause he was gonna shoot me.\" He said. \"You guys are crazy.\" I mumbled sitted back down on the bench. Just then a man walked in. He was short, old and skinny. He had round glasses and a half bald head. He sat down with a paper and a pencil in hand. \"Alright, what did you want to tell your parents?\" the man asked, his voice shaky. \"Um…\" I thought about it. This was a telegram… these people took the western theme to the limit obviously… and telegrams cost money per word so to make it short… \"I'm safe… but scared. Come get me, ASAP.\" I said. The man jotted it down with amazing speed. \"Address please?\" the man asked. \"5609, Feather street,\" I said. The man looked up at me, but then jotted it down on his paper, \"Lincoln city.\" The man stopped. \"What is this? Some kind of joke? This IS Lincoln city!\" the old man scoffed and stood up. \"Go tell yer parents yer self!\" He wobbled out the door, just as the sheriff came in, a tray full of food. He looked at me. \"You ok miss?' he asked, seeing my horrified face. I gulped and slowly nodded. \"That… that man. H… he said this was Lincoln city.\" I said. The deputy laughed and set down the tray. \"Cause it is. You must have been out there a long time. Where ya from?\" he asked. \"Lincoln.\" I said. The sheriff looked at me. \"I haven't seen you before.\" He said, \"You sure? Maybe it's the heat getting to your head. You better eat.\" I looked at the food as the deputy filed a few papers. I slowly ate the food. there wasn't two Lincoln city's. And if there way, it'd be on a map as a double. If it was on a map, the police would know about this place. \"What year is it?\" I asked. \"1876.\" The deputy said. I dropped the cheese. \"Miss? You sure your ok?\" I frowned. No I was not ok. I had been kidnapped to another time! HOW IS THAT OK! \"Miss?\" \"NO I'm NOT OK!\" I screamed. \"HAPPY! NOW YOU KNOW! I'm NOT alright! I just got kidnapped! I'm in a different TIME! I'm suppose to be in 2002! With computers and dishwashers and cell phones and Ipods and microwaves, and toothpaste for heavens sake!\" the deputy looked at me strangely. \"I think I'm gonna go get the doctor again.\" \"Oh NOOO you don't.\" I said. \"no WAY are you going to poison me with your cystic brain washing! I'm NEVER going to let your so called doctor even with in three feet of me!\" \"Better listen to her…\" the boy said from the cell, \"A mad women is a dangerous one.\" \"Keep your trap shut.\" The deputy said. he turned me me. \"Look, ma'am. I don't know where you came from, but we're going to contact your parents and get you home. But you need a doctor. I think the heat got to your head.\" He stood up and headed for the door. He opened it. I slammed it shut. \"IDOIT!\" I hissed, \"I just told you I'm NOT going to go through with that! You crazy people are going to get me killed! You are NOT going to brainwash me like the rest!\" \"Miss, please don't force me to use the law on you.\" The deputy said. \"It ain't gonna work.\" The boy said from the cell. I looked the deputy straight in the eye, seeing that spark of fear. \"Go ahead and TRY.\" I said coldly.[Chapter 5] About ten minutes later, I was locked up in the cell. The deputy gave me his apologies and went out the door for the doctor. \"What a piece of fatal desease.\" I muttered. \"I was rooting for ya.\" The boy said. I looked at him. He sat up, pulling his hat off. My eyes glittered for a moment, taken aback by his eyes. He had ruffled dirty blonde hair, than almost covered his sharp, piercing blue eyes. I could have sworn the they were glowing. They were the most brilliant blue that starred intensely. But I caught myself and frowned. \"I'm sure you were.\" I spat. \"So where exactly ARE you from?\" the boy asked. \"I mean, I've never seen a girl wear pants before.\" I looked at him, surprised. I thought he lied, but I saw no spark of lie in his eye. \"Not from here.\" I said. \"I live far from here.\" Was it possible, that I had somehow traveled through time? When I told myself, no. Somehow I didn't believe it. But it wasn't possible. If it wasn't possible, then why did I believe it? It was really odd, believing in something you knew wasn't possible. I slumped down in the cot. Ok… so I was in 1876, and in jail. The doctor was coming this way. I had to get out of here. How? No clue. Just then the deputy came in. I snapped upright. No one followed him. No doctor. He walked over to my cell. \"Sorry.\" He said, \"The doctor is busy until tomorrow morning.\" He shut the door separating his office from the prison cells. I slumped down again. I had to get out of here. \"So…\" the boy stated. \"Look, just shut your trap, alright? I've been through enough today, and I don't need anything else.\" The boy looked at me startled. \"Oh.\" He said. \"Alright.\" I looked at him. He had leaned back on the cot again, eyes closed. He seemed like a nice boy… but he had killed someone. \"But I just gotta say, that was a nice act in front of the deputy. Never seen a woman slip a tongue on front of the law.\" The way he said it… made me smile. It was the first smile that made me happy I was here. I laughed to myself, and continued to think. So if this really was the west, then I was out of place. My clothes especially. I had to get out of here, find another town, get some work, then money. After that I would figure out my next move. But for night now, I needed to be on secure ground. And no money and in jail was not secure. \"Where's the closest town from here?\" I asked. \"That'd be… wait.. you talking major town… or minor?\" \"Um… major.\" I said. \"Well, that'd be Albuquerque. About three days ride from here.\" The boy said. I nodded. Of coarse. That would me I was in New Mexico. Holy… I traveled time and states all in one night. I looked at the boy. He coulnd't have been to older then me. Yet he killed someone. \"How old are you?\" I asked. The boy turned his head, his blue eyes gazing at my green ones. \"Why?\" he asked. I shrugged. \"Seventeen.\" He said, turning back to relaxing. \"And don't say nothing bout it.\" I rolled my eyes, and thought. Three days ride. Was that fast riding? Or slow riding? I tried to remember the map I had pulled up on my computer when I was looking up towns for a school report. New Mexico. Albuquerque was… about one and a half day's hard ride. Ok. So I had that figure out. I also knew that town was Northwest from here, and I knew where the sun set and rose. So I could easily find my way… especially if there was a road. But the horse. Would the horse be able to take it? Coarse. It was the west. Horses were used to that. Good thing the deputy had left the rest of the food in my cell. I stood up, and stuffed it all in the center of the handkerchief underneath, and tied it. \"Plan on going somewhere?' the boy asked, without looking up. \"Out.\" I said. The boy jerked, and looked at me with a wide smile, \"You're kidding. You're just gonna up and leave?\" I tied the knapsack to my belt loop, and nodded. \"Oh… oh ok. Well…\" He pointed at the bars, 'You let me know how that goes.\" \"Easy.\" I said. This was a typical lock. I pulled from my shoe. I always had wires in my shoes. And bobby pins. Mostly because my brother would lock my room and his so I couldn't get in. So I had practice. I stuck the bobby pin in the lock, while the boy watched, his eyes catching every move, I moved the pin around. The inside of the lock was unfamiliar to me, but I soon figured where to stick the pin. I turned hard, and it snapped out. I grinded my teeth and tried again. On the side of my eye, I could tell the boy was watching with growing curiosity. I hoped he wouldn't ask me to let him out too. He killed someone… I didn't. I finally found the hole again, and turned the pin, a bit more delicately this time. The lock clicked, and I smiled. I opened the gate, and went out. I shut the gate behind me, and stuck the bobby pin back in my shoe. Without a glance at the boy, I peeked through the door separated us from the office. The deputy was sitting there. Eyes closed. Was he asleep? I watched his breathing… it was fast but steady. He wasn't completely asleep yet. I looked around, there was a window, but even that was barred. I thought. Ok, with my knowledge of the twenty first century, and I couldn't even get out of an unlocked room without crossing the deputy. Come on THINK! Ok… my report. My A plus school essay. Yeah. I had a whole page on jails. What did I write? I mentally read through my essay, looking for anything helpful. How they were built might be. Let's see. They were built out of wood, and nails, sometimes concrete. I looked around. The floor and walls were all wood except the back walls of the cells… they were cement. Ok. Think more. The walls were made up of planks of wood, nailed together by thick nails. If one tried to pull a nail out, it would squeak and give me away. But the corner piece. The corner piece was special. That's what they would first build, is the bottom corners… to set the foundation. The corners were set carefully and with the utmost care. If the corner was even the slightest messed up, the rest of the building wouldn't fit go together correctly. I looked at the corners. They both looked pretty well done. But one had a small plank of wood, just the slightest bit tipped, or angled. My eyes caught it imedietly. I walked over, one more glance at the deputy. He now had lit a cigar, and huffed away. I crouched down, my fingers running over the crooked plank. Here, the nails would be smaller, for more precise locations. It looked like the corner plank had been messed up slightly, and the builders tried to work around it. So… if I could pull out the odd corner plank, then I could find the week spot, and build a hole from there, with no noise. Now the question was… was this jail built like that? I mean, I didn't know when they started to build them like that, or stop. So if they had bigger nails, or smaller ones… I couldn't figure it out by starring. Only one way to find out. I gripped the corner plank, and tugged. It only budged loose, some dust trickling to the floor. I pulled again, this time harder, and I felt the plank give way. No noise. The dirt around the plank fell, and I squinted to keep it from getting in my eyes. Now I had a small hole about the size of a envelope, in front of me. I peeked out. Good. The hole was face another side of a building. It was empty with the exception of a few crates and brown woven bags, packed into a wagon. I stood up, and stood back. Ok… now to find the weak spot. If the corner plank was weak here, that means they had to adjust the planks above and below it. They would also have to adjust the planks in the top corner of it, and bottom corner of it. I looked at the planks in the weak spots I guessed. They would be big enough that if pulled out, I could fit through. I did so quickly, and without a sound. More dirt fell to the floor. As I pulled the last plank out, I remember the boy was watching. He wasn't talking, or saying anything to me. Why? I don't know. But I wasn't going to turn around and ask. I slipped through the hole, and straightened. Free. They would chase after me. After all, all they needed was my word from the shooting… and I'm sure plenty of people saw it. Plus I was required to leave. I went down the ally, and peeked out into the once again busy street. My horse, was tied up in front of the deputy's office, still saddled and packed. I pressed my back to the wall, and looked up. The sun was coming off the building in front of me, so I had to go the opposite way. Perfect. I had to cross the window of the deputy. I took a deep breathe and walked out like I owned the town. My shoulders back, chin up, and my stride powerful and strong. I unwrapped the tie to my horse, like I was just going on a Sunday ride. I mounted up, and turned the horse, without looking at the window. I rode out of town quietly, with no one noticing. Ok. The town I wanted was one and a half day's hard ride from here. I looked at the horse. These creatures may be strong in this time, but we had just finished a long ride, and I wasn't about to push it hard. I put it into a soft trot. I figured if the river I had seen eailer ran straight, we would cross it, and settle down there. as I bounced lightly, I thought some more. It was hard to believe I was in a completely different town… a different state and a whole different time. But no matter how hard I tried to deny it, I knew it was true. But HOW? How did I travel time in one night? And why now? Why the old west? Why, why, why? I wanted to scream. But I kept myself under control. Mom and Dad weren't here. No one was going to protect me, feed me, take care of me. I was going to have to do it by myself. I was sixteen, and I knew I had to try to live. I had to get money, blend in, and try to find a way back home. I took slow steady breaths, trying to grip what had happened. No one here would believe I had traveled from the future, computicated instantly to friends across the state on a computer, put dishes in a machine and they got washed, or even put food in a microwave and it got heated up! Well, no one back home would believe I witnessed a real shoot out, a real murder, or rode the dusty trails, or escaped the town jail, or ate food with a deputy, or even shot at a real man. I was stunned at my last thought. Shot at a real man. I really did shoot a man, didn't I? Why did I do that! WAS I MAD! I could have killed him! How could I be so sure of myself! Yes, I wasn't that far away, but to actually SHOOT at a man? What was I thinking? I started to panic. What if changing times, changed me? What if every time I needed to, I shot at people… and killed them? What if the time warp made me some kind of killer? What had exactly changed in me? What if something else had changed me me other then I'm suddenly shooting at people! I gripped the reigns, and grinded my teeth. Oh… slow down… clam down… take a deep breath. Just don't think. Every time you think, you get more depressed, so don't. Don't think? But THINKING got me out of that house of the kidnappers, THINKING got me out of jai, THINKING, allowed me to know my next step. My next step. Yeah, think about that. Always know your next step. Ok, I would get into town, and lie low for a while. Just skimming around, looking for places that needed workers, and if anyone would ever come after me from my escape. I couldn't lie low long though. I needed food and a roof over my head. I needed money. Money could get me food and a room to stay in. Ok. So a job came first. I get a job. I was smart… good at a lot of stuff. Then what? What would I do after that? I could feel my heart starting to pump faster with more panic. I took a deep breath, and told my self to slow down. It was to overwhelming. Ok, just get a job, get a hotel room, and blend in. Then plan your next move. Like I said… I needed stable ground. A solid backstage. Ok. A plan. It wasn't much… but it was something. I looked through the saddle back again, to see if there was anything that would help. Nothing. But as I jumbled through, something caught my sharp eye, that hadn't before. I very welll hidden pocket on the side. I stuck my hand through it and pulled out it's papery contents. My eyes widened as I recognized what it was. Money. Around fifteen dollars. No where near enough for a hotel room, but maybe a cowboy hat. Clothes was another thing I needed to blend in. I knew how these people dressed, and I wasn't one of them at the moment. So I needed clothes too.. stop. Stop thinking. You have a plan now stop adding to it. It'll just get more chaotic. I closed my eyes and cleared my mind. I focused on the horses steps, and the movment of my body as it bounced. It was a lot better when I had first started riding.[Chapter 6] The second day, I got tired of focusing on the horses beat, and my movement, so I focused on the sounds around me. It was quiet other then a soft wind, and the creek nearby. I was surprised when I focuses on it, I could even hear the creak. I heard a few birds… hawks, and some crickets. The creak of the saddle, the occasionally snort of the horse. When the sun was over my head, I began to pick out sounds that didn't belong. The sudden thumping of a rabbit speeding away. A sage brush making a little more noise then it was suppose to, and when I looked up, a chipmunk bolted away. I opened my knapsack and finished off the left over food I could find. I closed my eyes again, and kept focusing and what sounds didn't belong. It became a game to keep me occupied. I was determined to hear everything, but I knew I couldn't. A few times I looked up, and I saw small land creatures I heard nothing of. But I still tried, just to see what I could hear, and what I could find. As the sun began to sink, I focused on the air around me. The wind would pick up slow down, turn, spin, flap my hair around… but all in a smooth, easy movement. There were no sudden jerks or instant turns in the air. And when I brushed my hands a foot away from my face, I could my hand's bend in the wind on my face. Maybe that's something else the time warp had changed. My senses were sharper. Or maybe they were already that sharp, and I just never had a need to use them like this. When the sun was gone… I decided to ride the night. I found rope, and tied it around myself, then to the saddle, (something I learned from watching HILDALGO) so I wouldn't' fall off in case I dozed. But I never did. I wanted to see how far my new talent stretched. I listened to the night. There was a little more wind, and plenty of crickets. More nocturnal creatures were out, and there were plenty of sounds for me to hear. I listened, trying to figure out any sound that was out of place. I found quite a few things. More foxes were out. Even heard something that I thought was a fox, but the paw steps were much bigger. I opened my eyes, and scanned the dark land. I made out a sleek figure streaming across the land… a coyote. As the night wore on, a smell came to my nose… a skunk. I had a hand over my nose for two hours, waiting for the smell to pass. When it finally did, I began to wonder if I could SMELL as good as I could hear and see, and feel the wind. Didn't have much luck on that. But I was satisfied. I could pick out the sounds that didn't belong. Reminded me of the movie 'the quick and the dead' when the main man without a name, told the woman to pick out the sounds that don't belong in the night. I passed a few trees, and sage brush by the creak, and thought of how perfect they would be to rest. But I was going to ride the whole night. I could rest at the hotel… after I got one. I trusted the horse enough to let loose the reigns and he would follow the road to town. I hung my head, and came close to sleep as the sun rose. I never actually went to sleep… just wondered in and out of nodding off. I figured if I was on the trial for two days and one night… I would get there by morning. The ride was long, yes, but filled with sights to see. I saw wild animals… better then any zoo could give me. I saw hills… rocky terrain, WILD ground. You couldn't find a place like that and RIDE through it back then… or 2002 at least. The horse stayed on the road, and I let my arms flop. I could tell the horse was getting tired. His trot slowed, but he could still run. I didn't want him to do a slow walk, so I kept having to nudge him. He eventually got to the idea and kept a steady pace. The sun rose, and I kept lifting my head to see if I could spot the twon. A few lifts, and a few hours later, I spotted it. I nudged the horse into a faster trot, and was soon in town. I found a stable at the far end of the town, and dismounted there. I walked the horse in, looking around. There were a few other horses there, stalled with fresh hay. I knew my horse could use that right now. \"Hello?\" I called. \"Be right out!\" called a elderly, deep voice. I waited, and soon a dirty black man around his thirties walked into view. \"I'd like to leave my horse here. I will be staying a while, and he need's to be feed water… even a wash would do him good.\" I said, wondering if I had enough money. The man nodded. \"Well, for two weeks full hold, it'll be four dollars. You got that kind of money young miss?\" the man asked. I looked at him. FOUR dollars? I almost laughed as I pulled out the money and dumped it in his hand. The man took the horse and led him in the stall. I left, I new perspective on the money in my pocket. Ok, first things first. Blend in. Clothes. I went into a few clothing shops, about as big as my kitchen, and took the cheapest one. I came out with a clean pair of jeans, a long white sleeve shirt, and a tan hide vest. I thought about getting skirt, and even the shop owner suggested it, after hearing I wanted jeans. But I couldn't ride in a skirt. I bought a nice blue hanky, and tied it around my neck. I didn't have much money left for a hat or boots, but I wanted to save the last little bit of money for food. I walked out of the store, tieing my long blonde hair up in a pony, and tennis shoes. A funny look yes, but it would work for now. My real clothes were folded nicely and put in a bag that man offered to me. Now I fit in. I didn't stand out to much, other then a girl wearing pants. But then again, I was no normal kid from no where.[Chapter 7] I bought an apple from a store, just something to chew on while I searched for work. I asked a few people around where there might be a need of help. I was pointed at the hotel a few times, so I heaed over in that direction. I found the Hotel, a big sign that said De Luna Hotel across it in big bold red letters. I walked in. It was empty, other then a few men in the corner. They were playing cards and a cloud of smoke that had gathered around them from there cigars. They gave me an odd glance, before turning back to their game. I went up to the bar, and waited. Soon, a young woman came up to me. \"Well Howdy.\" She said, a slight accent, \"What can I do for ya?\" \"I'd like some work.\" I said, trying my best to sneak my own accent in. \"I can do any work ya need round here. I cook and clean too.\" The woman looked at me, a bit stunned I had blurted out a big desition so quickly. \"Well, how old are ya?\" she asked. \"Sixteen.\" I said. \"You ever worked behind a bar before?\" \"No ma'am.\" I said. \"But I'm a fast learner.\" I looked her straight in the eye and gave her a gleam of determination. \"You handy with a gun?\" she asked. I stopped, surprised by the question. \"When the time comes to it, I guess I'm about average.\" I said, not knowing exactly sure how good I was after the time warp. \"How bout cards? You good at gambl'in?\" She asked. Well if I was anything like back home, I had a good hand. I nodded. \"Alright. Well, we have plenty of jobs round here that could use a good fill in. we don't get a lot of business, but if ya can cook, the kitchen's in the back. Any free time ya got will be spent watching the card games. You can play to, if ya think you can hold your own. But if you ever get caught cheat'in, you're fired. You there to watch for other cheaters. Don't do nothing. Just come tell me.\" She said. I nodded. \"What's the pay?\" I asked. \"Well, consider'in you'd be doing two jobs, and in a very down hill place, I'll give ya two dollars an hour. Ain't gonna find a better deal.\" She said. I thought about it. \"Can I have my own room here to?' I asked. She nodded. \"Your own room and the kitchen is yours when Aunt May ain't there. Foods free.\" She said. \"Deal.\" I said. I really didn't think I would find a better deal. \"When do I start?\" \"Well, I don't see why not now?\" she said, 'I didn't catch your name.\" I thought about it. Telling her my real name woulnd't hurt. \"Elisha. Elisha Young.\" I said. \"De Luna, call me Lou.\" She said, \"I own this here heap of rotten wood. Come on back I'll show ya around.\" I followed her around back to the kitchen. \"Don't get much business here do ya?' I said. Lou shook her head. \"Not much we can do about it. We need somth'in new around here to attract attention. Fact is, there really is noth'I n new to take up. This here's the kitchen.\" She flipped on the lights. It looked like a regular kitchen, but with way more cabinets and no refrigerator. \"Cold Cell is below the floor. You'll find the door out back. The store house is next to that. You can get hot water from the sink, something new that just got put in, and the water pump for fresh water is out back. Just follow the dirt path up a ways.\" I nodded. Lou showed me the rest of the kitchen and the behind bar stages for drinks. She showed me a few tricks to impress the costumers with, or just for the heck of it. And all this stuff was open to me at any time. \"I'm usually in the main room playing cards with the big shots… that's the only room you're not allowed in.\" I nodded. \"Other then that, you're free to do what you please.\" She gave me a kind smiled. I smiled back. She was incredibly nice. She Gave me a room, food, and work and good pay all in one deal. I wanted to repay her. How? Bring some business into this place. \"Hey Lou?\" I said, stopping her before she left for forbidden room. \"Could I try a few of my gran's old recipes? Try to spice things up around here?\" Lou chuckled. \"Honey, you get any spice around here, and you're pay will be the one flaming up.\" She said, and shut the door. Another shot for more money. Ok. I walked back into the kitchen. First off, I would make…a cake. A chocolate cake my mom made me. With coconut sprinkled on top. I set to work, tying an apron around my waist. It wasn't hard to find all the things I needed, and I soon was mixing the batter in a bowl. I would bake all day today, and serve the food tomorrow. As the cake baked, I started in on an cinnamon apple pie. When I finished that, the cake was done, and I smeared the homemade frosting on top. I finished if off with the spread of coconut. I set it aside, and put the pie in the oven. The oven wasn't to hard to work with, but I managed. I thought about stopping a few times, but I knew if I stopped I wouldn't start up again. Lou was kind to me, and I intended to repay her. As the pie baked, I set to work on chocolate chunk brownies from scratch. It was a good thing I cooked with my mom. All these things would prove impossible if I hadn't. I slid the brownies in with the pie, and wondered what I could make next. I wanted something that would attract attention… something everyone would like. Seven layer cookies. Oh yeah. I went around gathering the ingredients, just as the buzzer went off for the pie. I set the pie by the window to cool, but then decided against it. I needed to keep it warm for tomorrow. I put it in a box, after layering it with a thick blanket from my room. I set the brownies in there along with it. As I began to set to work on the cookies, Lou came in. She was in a dark green robe, her curly brown hair around her shoulders. \"Dear me, have you been in here all day?\" she asked. I looked up, flour and chocolate on my face. \"What time is it?\" I asked. \"My bed time.\" She said. \"Oh!\" I set down what I had in my hands. 'I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to wake you up!\" \"No. You didn't wake me up. The smell did. What on earth are you cooking?' she asked. \"Oh… some stuff for tomorrow, that's all.\" I said. \"Well it smells wonderful. If I didn't' know any better, I could have sworn the smell itself made me sleep walk down here.\" She smiled, \"Just make sure you clean up.\" I nodded as she walked off. As the cookies baked, I cleaned up. I washed my face and I do have to say, that cold water felt good on my face. When everything was clean, the cookies weren't quite done yet. I went to the box, and checked to see how the heat was holding in. Very well so far. I reorganized to make room for the cookies, and took the apron off and put it away. A quite seep across the floor and a good kitchen scrub down, and the cookies still weren't done. I waited around for about three minutes before I went back to cleaning the kitchen. It went from wiping the counter, to wiping the sinks, to wiping the entire floor and walls. I polished the sinks, and shined the cabinets. I got in every corner and nook, cleaned everything I could reach. A few minutes after the kitchen began to sparkle, the droning buzzer went off. I pulled the cookies out. Perfect. Just the smell made my mouth water. I set the cookies in the box, and turend out the light. Sleepily I went up the stairs, and found myself in a quite comfortable bed. I fell sleep, without changing clothes.[Chapter 8] The next morning, I got up with the sun. I lazed about for a few mintues, then dragged my feet out of bed. I splashed cold water from a provided base on my face, and dried it. I looked up in the mirror. It took me a second to recognize the image. I mean, I looked at me, but didn't at the same time. I still had my long blonde hair, by gold speckled green hawk eyes, lined eyebrows, long eyelashes, curved lips and a cute nose. But I looked… meaner. Tougher. Like my personality was one thing you didn't want to mess with. I had a dark tan from being out in the sun, and I decided I would get a hat right away. I also looked… rough. Like I hadn't lived in a right home for years. My messy hair added to that theory. I brushed it out, and pulled it back into a pony again. I straightened my shirt and fixed my vest, before heading downstairs. I meat Lou at the bottom. \"We have a customer already.\" She said, \"Said he smelt something coming the heavens, and tracked it here.\" she was looking at me oddly. \"Did I do something wrong?\" I asked, worried. \"Oh, no.\" she said. \"Nothing at all.\" She picked up her red satin skirts and walked off. I watched her go. What had I done? Nothing bad I hope. I didn't want to get fired. I came down, and found a young looking man resting at the bar table. I walked behind the counter, and up to the man. He was maybe in his early twenties. \"What can I do for ya?\" I asked. The man looked up at me, his dark brown eyes starring right through me. He hesitated. \"Well, I'd like some whisky.\" He said kindly. I nodded, and pulled a glass from the shelf under the table. I made sure it was wiped clean and filled it with whisky. I set the glass in front of me, and set the bottle by the mirror. The two men from yesterday playing cards walked in, and picked there table. \"Whisky.\" They called to me. I nodded and brought them all over cups and there own bottle. They flipped me the change, and I counted it. \"Five more cents please.\" I said, counting five cents less then it was. The man looked up at me, his eyes hard. \"Excuse me?\" the man said, his voice cold. Now, I had seen movies with men in them like this. They thought they could take an advantage of the new kid, and scare him off. They thought they were better. But I was no normal kid. I gave him a glare that told him I wasn't going to mess around. I could go easy and say, you were five cents off, but he would just get madder. So I would take it to the top first. \"What ya can't count?\" I said, my own voice icy. \"Your five cents short, old coot.\" The man stood up, maybe about an inch taller then me. I looked at him straight and hard, not backing down. \"You saying I'm cheating?' the man asked. My eyes flared, and my heart fluttered when I saw a speck of regret in his eye. \"I hope you ain't cheat'in.\" I said, my voice low and cold, \"I don't like cheaters.\" The man hesitated, then sat back down. He dealt the cards, without a word. I stood there watching for a while, waiting for the last five cents. I opened my mouth to tell him again, but the other man suddenly flipped his hand up. At first I expected a gun, but his hand was empty. Instead he through the last five cents. I caught it out of reflex without flinched before it hit my face. \"Thank you gentlemen. Enjoy your drinks.\" I said. I walked back behind the counter. The young dark haired man at the bar was starring at me. I said nothing as cleaned up the counter, and wiped down a few more glasses for upcoming customers. \"Who's the cook around here?\" the man asked. Without looking up from the glass, I answered. \"Aunt May. She's outta town for the week, so I took up the job.\" I said, \"Need anything?\" I looked up at him, his brown eyes shimmering. \"The freshest thing you've got.\" He said, his voice hiding something. I thought about it. Alright, he seemed like a nice man, but I wasn't going to judge. I went around to the kitchen in the back, and pulled out the box. Which would I give him? The cake? Brownies? Or the seven layer cookies? He said freshest thing I had… that would be the cookies. I pulled the tray out, still warm from last night's baking, and cut the cookies into half dollar quarter sizes. I pulled out four, and set them on a paper napkin. I walked back into the front, and set the napkin in front of him with only two. The other two were set aside. \"That'll be twenty cents.\" I said. The man looked at me, a bit hesitant. If he tried to fool me like those beggars over there, he'd be sorry. My eyes flared once, warning him. He considered it, and dropped the money on the bar. I gathered it up and put it in the register along with the rest. I couldn't help but watch from the side of my eye as he bit into the cookies. He slowly chewed, his eyes closing slightly, concentrating on the taste. He took another bite, and slowly chewed. He sat there at the bar eating slowly, while I watched behind my eyelashes while cleaning glasses. There was a clumping outside, and instinct told me to look. An elderly man, maybe in his fifties, was walking down the board walk. He passed the hotel without so much of a glance. But then the clunking suddenly stopped, and backtracked a little faster. I turned my head in the direction of the door. The elderly man was holding the swinging doors open, his feet spread, and his mouth agape. His wide eyes were staring intently at the man, eating the cookies. \"two more please.\" The man said, slapping another twenty cents on the bar. I gave him the other two, this time noticing even the men playing cards looked up, gazing in amazement at the man. The old man at the door, closed his mouth, and opened it again, swinging as if on a hinge, trying to figure out what to say. Finally, he left the hotel, puzzled. The men continued playing there game, every so often glancing up, with an unsure look on their face. The man quietly finished his second two, licked his fingers and looked up. His glance caught my eye, soft and unique. He reached in his pocket, and pulled out ten whole dollars. He set in on the table, and stood up. As he began to walk away, I spoke. \"Sir, you forgot your money.\" I said. He stopped and slowly turned around to me. \"That's your tip.\" He said. I looked at the money. Ten dollars was a LOT in this time. \"Sir? Ten dollars? I can't take that much from you.\" I said. \"Oh yes you can.\" Came Lou's voice. \"Thank's Jeff. See ya tonight, eh?\" Jeff, the man with the overdrive tip, nodded. He starred at me a bit puzzled. Lou, seeing the odd gaze filled in. \"She's new. Just came into town yesterday. Tired thing she was. Spent almost all night cooking those.\" Jim nodded and walked out of the hotel silently. I looked at Lou confused. \"What did you give him?\" Lou asked instantly. \"What did he pay for?' She walked over getting in my face. \"Just some whisky…\" I said. \"Anything else?\" she interrupted. \"Y… yeah. He ate my cookies I made last night.\" I said. Lou's eyes widened. \"Show me.\" She ordered. I set down the glass, and started to walk to the kitchen. \"I'm sorry if I did…\" I started. \"No, no. Just show me the cookies.\" She said. I did. I pulled one out and gave it to her in a hurry, so she wouldn't bet mad from waiting. She held the cookie up examining the different style. She smelled it, her eyes flashing. Then slowing and carefully she took a bite. She stopped in mid chew, and looked up at me. \"YOU made these?\" she said. \"Yes. I tired not to burn them, but I might have made a mistake.\" I said, feeling my gut turn. She shook her head. \"There's nothing wrong with these. Absolutely nothing.\" Lou said, \"Jeff Watson, the man that gave you the bizarre tip, is picky on what he eats.\" I looked at her, confused. \"He'll eat almost everything yes, but never something he didn't like twice. We're having trouble keeping him fed. We have a annual fair contest where everyone makes the best goods they can. Jeff tests them out, and picks the one he likes. The winner get the money he's saved up for that special food. We haven't had a winner for nine years.\" Lou explained. I looked at her, almost horrified. \"How many did he have.\" \"Um… four.\" I said. Lou looked at me. \"Incredible.\" She said. \"I thought I smelt something incredible from the kitchen. I just never dreamed it would coax Jeff Watson in to FOUR servings!\" \"Actually, it was only two servings, it was just…\" I started. But I was interrupted by a ring. Lou looked up startled. We both headed out to the bar. There were four men, included the elderly man that stopped at the door, standing at the bar. \"What did Jeff have?\" the men asked. \"How much is it? When was it made? What's it called?\" Lou hushed the questions. \"Gentlemen, I'm not the person to ask. I hired on a new hand… Elisha. She's the one who took Jeff's order. She's the cook.\" Lou stepped aside allowing the men to see me starring back at them blankly. \"We want some.\" They said. I nodded, and headed back. When I came back with the cookies, two more men came in, followed by three women. They all wanted the cookies. \"What do you call them?\" one lady asked. \"Seven layer cookies.\" I said. \"S…L…C… Slc's. Elsy's… Eli's!\" cried out a kid who had rushed in, with his mother. \"I want an Eli's mommy!\" Soon everyone was ignoring the name 'seven layer cookies,' and called them Eli's. Gimme Eli's! Eli's down here! A few Eli's Please! An order of Eli's down here!\" Lou was forced out of the back room and come help serve. We were soon packed with people, and running out of Eli's. I moved to the cake and brownies, and they were just as good of a success. Lou moved around with a wide smile and try full of whisky, while I tried to keep up with everyone's order of the sweets. When we were out, we started to have people order for later, even pay ahead of time to get the first piece. The cash register was full within the day. I was sent back to the kitchen to bake some more, while Lou tended out front. I made the good quickly, and brought them out when there were done. Every time I brought the cookies out, there was a yell across the crowded room, and soon the bar was rushed in full of people with their money ready. Again and again I was sent to the back to make more. When the day began to slink away into night, the people began to separate out. We had seven card games going, but all the other nineteen tables were full of men, and a few women. The kids all left, and the bar was full. I made the last two batches of cookies and brought them out. Both tray's were gone within the minute. Lou raked in the money, and cashed it in. As she shut the cash tray, she looked at me, her eyes sparkling, her face in a wide grin. I bit my lip. \"You're a blessing to the De Luna name!\" she said. She walked up to me and gathered me in a hung. I went stiff, and waited until it was over. Lou was nice, but I didn't know her that well. She pulled back, a grin still on her face. \"You poor thing. You look exausted! Tell you what. You play a round of cards with me, and I'll give you a day off tomorrow.\" \"Tomorrow? But I only started work today.\" I said. She chuckled. \"You brought life in this hotel again! And a smile back on my face! And money in the boot! All on your fisrt day. You do it again tomorrow and I'll break down. Take a day off. For the good of both of us. What do you say?\" I thought about it. Well, a game of cards couldn't hurt. \"I say let's deal out.\" I said. Lou smiled brightened, and she lead me out and around to a table. There were three other men there, and they dealt out the cards. I watched the man's hands carefully, making sure no one cheated. My eyes flickered over to the other players, then to my own pile. I picked my cards up, and spread them. As I calculated the plays… I smiled.[Chapter 9] The rest of the week went on just the same. I played cards with a few rough men, but Lou kept them out of my hair. She had a strong will and they all respected her. Anytime I caught someone cheating, I would tell Lou, and she would take it from there. At first, Lou would question me, and question the accused, not sure to believe it. But after seven correct calls of cheating in a row, she began to just call them off for cheating right then and there. The rest of the games went smoothly thought. I was good, and soon had a name in the town of a woman gambler. I won a lot of money, not to mention all my pay and tips. I saved all the money up in my room, not quite sure what to use it for. I guessed I would find something for it right? I finally got my hat and boots. Even a few more pairs of clothes. My cowboy hat reminded me of my dads. A worn leather bendable hat. It wasn't cheap, and finely made. It fit nicely on my head, and gave me a good look. It also shaded my eyes on my frequent walks around town, and kept my head cool. I got to meet lots of people around town, and even talked to Jeff a few times. Turns out my cookies somehow reminded him of his grandmother. I told him the recipe was my own grandmothers, and that I took no credit. He admired me for my honesty and the next day came in to order two trays full. Where he got the money? I had no clue. I asked Lou about him, and she said, he had owned the whole town once, but he sold out half of it to Murphy, and now only owned half. But the Sheriff parted both sides. He was a nice, decent man. He had talked to me about his friend, another sheriff in Lincoln, who was a good friend of his. When he heard the news, that he was shot and killed, he became silent, and didn't talk much. I cheered him up by bringing a few Eli's to his door at no cost. Aunt May came back early to the Hotel, and was surprised to see business so good. Auny May was another kind elderly lady, with kind eyes and a warm smile. Most of the time she would clean up after my mess in the kitchen. I would feel bad and try harder to keep the kitchen clean. When I told her about how I felt, she just smiled and said 'you make the business and cookies, I'll make sure nothin's in the way.\" At first, I wasn't so sure she really meant it. But she did. She even chewed out a few men for me. No one would mess with an angry old lady. I made the cookies every other day, and got two day's off in the week. The days I made the cookies we got more business then when I didn't. But the other days kept us busy with the cakes and brownies. I was soon well known around town for my gambling hand, my hawk eyes, and my cookies. Aunt may would help out when she could, but she refused to touch the cookies. She said it was my own secret, and she would leave it mine. I would sigh and go back to work. On slow days… which weren't a lot of days… me and Aunt May would sing songs together in the kitchen baking. She would teach me the songs to sing when on the trail, and I would teach her songs of my home. We would laugh and learn from each other all day, just behind the kitchen. I soon became to know Aunt May as a mom away from home. Even Lou acted as my older sister. We would joke around, play around, sometimes even throw a few punches at each other. Lou, for being such a dressy girl, knew how to punch. One time a few boys my age came around and challenged me to a shooting contest. With nothing better to do, and wondering how good I was myself, I accepted. I beat them all, except on the last round. I saw the boys were getting curious and puzzled at how I had gotten so good. Not wanting to answer the questions, I purposely missed the wax candle. But I hit my target… a twig about four meters back. The boys never suspected a thing. As the week's wore on, I became friends with a lot of the local boys. The girls weren't exactly thrilled about takeing all the boys attention, so they kept away from me. But as I hung out with them, I learned to ride better, even to use a knife. Like I said, I was a fast learner, and the boys were always anxious to teach me new things. I learned a few trick riding moves in two days. The boys would laugh when I would do it wrong. I would fall off, and roll to a stop as the horse would slow. The boys would stop laughing wondering if I would start crying or not. And honestly, there were a few times I wish I would've cried it hurt so much. But I never did. I would walk away with a limp, or a sore arm and bruises. But so would the other boys. I could never beat them in arm wrestling though. The boys were two strong from working in the fields and farms against working in the kitchen. But I could still come close. The boys were amazed at how I was able to pick out sounds from the land, and figure out which ones didn't belong. I tried to teach a few, but most of them would give up. There were a few though, who came back to me the next day, a wide smile on there face. They would gladly pronounce they had done it correctly. After that, other boys began to try. I was surprised to find out it took most days to even DO what I had mastered in hours. The only answer that came to mind was the time warp. A few men came in from Lincoln, and recognized me as the one who escaped the jail house. This came to a surprise to the town, as there wonderful Elisha was in jail. But it was soon settled out that I was exhausted from the heat, over reacted and contained. Ther girls took the advantage and spread rumors and teased me when they could. But the boys would come to my side and the girls would hush. I knew which boy every girl liked… and I knew I was friends with all of them. At the end of each day, I would go back to the hotel and help finish off the night. I would then go upstairs, a handful of pay, and re count my money savings. I had quite a good amount saved up by the end of the second week. It would put a smile on my face, but that smile would disappear, when I realized I still had no idea how to get back home. I had steady ground to walk on now… better then when I had planned. But now I had no plan. Nothing to figure out. By the third week, I was beginning to feel depressed. I went out with the boys less often. I made the cookies in silence, and I walked around with a smile less often. A few days into the third week, Lou met me at the kitchen doorway. She handed me a basket. \"We need eggs and flour, from the market.\" Lou said. I nodded and took the basket. I walked out of the hotel without a word and headed down the street. I walked slowly, taking my time down the road. I wasn't watching where I was going, and knocked into someone, almost dropping my basket. I looked up, about to say sorry, with I saw who it was and clamped my mouth shut. \"Little errand girl off to get all her little goodies?\" Mary, the older and leader of the group of girls I despised the most. She was a year older then me, but didn't act like it. I said nothing. I just looked at her with cold eyes. \"Aw, poor little trying to keep her self out of trouble?\" \"You don't see much of anything.\" Another girl said. I glared at her. \"you've been looking in the mirror to much.\" I snapped. I tried to walk around them, but Mary grabbed my arm, and shoved me down an ally. What were they going to do? Beat me up? Yeah right. Five girls in hot, thick dressed beating a girl who knew how to fight and in pants. What I didn't except was the load full of water coming from behind me. It splashed across my back, and soaked me to the bone. I spun around to find three other girls holding a half empty bucket of water. I glared at them. I couldn't beat them up… my rep was to high in this town. I threw the basket aside, and I grabbed the bucket of water from there hands. I spun around. The water flew through the air and splashed across all the girls, including Mary. I jump of screams filled the empty ally as the water seeped through their heavy skirts and made they even more heavy, and itchy. I glared at Mary, my blonde hair soaking and draping in front of my face. \"Don't you EVER try a stunt like that again, you wallabees.\" I hissed. I wasn't in a mood take take blows from these guys. And to shut them up, I would swing if I had to. \"You! You little!\" Mary started. \"Aw shut up.\" I snapped, \"Just cause you're older then the rest of the girls and got a few looks from the cutest boy in town don't mean your something.\" I said. She glared at me, and I glared back. I figured hey, the worst she would do was slap me. \"Keith probably doesn't even know you exist! You just DREAMED he glanced at you!\" Her eyes flared. \"I wouldn't be talking!\" She hissed back, \"At least I have parents!\" My heart went cold. \"At least I have a family and not some people thrown together and called relatives!\" \"Shut up!\" I yelled, my fists clenching. \"They probably don't even like you!\" Mary yelled back, \"They only want you there cause you're bringing them good business! Lou didn't have ANYTHING before you came. But one look at you and she thinks 'I'll give it a try' and that's the only reason she kept you. You're nothing special! You intruded Aunt May's own JOB! She's getting paid less, and more labor cleaning up after you're little mess!\" My heart pumped hard, and I felt tears choke up behind my eyes. \"I said shut up!\" I yelled. \"You don't have a family.\" Mary finally said, \"You're an orphan.\" And do you know what? I began to think it was true. I had no family. My dad wasn't even BORN yet. They didn't exist yet. \"You really are nothing.\" I was quiet. And Mary knew she had won. \"Hey. Everything ok down here?\" came a voice. My eyes were watering, as I saw Keith, and a few other boys come down the ally. My eyes never left Mary's. Keith looked at Mary. \"What happened to you?\" he asked, noticing all the girls were wet. Mary looked at him and smiled. \"I'm all wet.\" She said, in a kind sweet voice, \"I was fine but now that you mention it…. I am a bit cold.\" I grinded my teeth. She was hitting on him. My friend, right in front of me. Keith looked at her. \"I see that…\" He caught a glance at me, \"Holy! Elisha you ok?\" He ran over to my side. My knees were shaking, and my face was red and eyes teary. He tore off his coat and draped it around my shoulders. The other boys came in wondering what all the commotion was about. They saw my eyes filling with tears. They told me to keep my chin up, don't let the other girls get to me, and wondering if I was ok. I looked past them all, and say Mary's eyes blazing, face red from anger. \"Oh my gosh!\" She hissed, \"That girl.\" She pointed at me. \"Went MAD from the heat! She was locked up behind bars she went so crazy! And yet you worry about her over ME?\" \"She probably lasted longer out in the heat without food or water, longer then you could last without your parents babying you.\" Snapped the boy on my left… Jacob. Mary frowned. \"Keith. At least you are smart enough to stay away from a mad girl.\" Mary said. Keith looked up, and starred her straight in the eyes. \"I am.\" He said, \"Staying away from you.\" Mary's mouth dropped open. \"Oh come on! It was a joke!\" called another girl. \"Elisha didn't take it that way.\" Said other boy. \"Well she needs to tough it out!\" cried another girl. The boys all rolled there eyes. Even a few girls. ME, tough it out? Ha. Been there done that. \"Keith…\" Mary said quietly, \"Come on. I thought we were together? Can't we just forget about this? You can walk away with me, forgetting this EVER happened.\" Keith looked at her again, his bright hazel eyes blazing. \"Beat it.\" he said quietly. 'What?\" Mary looked at him. Even a few boys looked surprised. \"I said beat it!\" Keith yelled, \"Or I'll deal with ya myself! And I'll 'forget' you're girls and take a beating to ya!\" Mary's starred at him horrified and surprised. Even I was a little surprised. That was no where NEAR proper. The other girls tired to push her along, and finally just shoved her out. Keith turned to me. \"What happened?\" Jacob asked. \"You look like you've went through a tornado, and seized a wild horse by yourself.\" I didn't say anything. I pulled the coat up around my shoulders, and looked down, shivering. For once… I wanted to be a girl and break down and cry. I wanted to be a weak little cry-baby. But the tears wouldn't come no matter how hard I thought I wanted them to. \"Elisha?\" Keith raised my chin softly. I looked at him, wondering what I should tell him. \"It's nothing.\" I said, \"She just got on my nerves.\" \"Your nerves huh?\" said a boy to my left… James. \"Then why are your eyes hot enough to boil water? Your shaking, and I'll bet you a buck it ain't from the water.\" \"I'm fine.\" I said. \"Thanks for the help guys.\" I picked up my basket, and started out of the ally. I turned back around, and the group of guys were starring at me, worried. I had to smile. These guys were either old coots, or dead in the real time… MY time. I couldn't imagine Keith a old coot, wobbling to a chair to sit down. He had so much energy. I gave them a warm smile. \"Thanks guys.\" I said, a bit happier then I felt. I turned around and headed back to the store. Without looking back, I could hear two boys following me. By the sound of the strides, and a few whiffs of them downwind, I figured it was Keith and Matt. I went into the store, and shut the door softly behind me. Inside was quiet and calm… just the place I liked to be right now. I picked out a few eggs, expecting the boys to come in after me… but the didn't. Maybe they left. I scanned my eyes over the fruit goods in the store… and picked the best ones from the shelf. I set the basket on the counter, and rang the bell. The elderly man whom I had seen in the hotel, gaping at Jeff, came to the counter. \"good morning Elisha.\" He said, \"Why are you all wet?\" \"Long story.\" I huffed, \"Can I please have two pounds of flour, Mr. Hofman?\" the man nodded, and pulled out a scoop from underneath the counter. He filled a glass jar, and set it on the weight. Two and a half pounds. \"How bout a half for free?\" he said, \"And I get three free Eli's cookies?\" I chuckled and nodded. He set the jar in front of me, tightening a lid over it, and added it all up. \"That'll be three fifty.\" He said. I reached in my pocket, and gave him the money, and waited for the change. As he searched out the change, my eyes wondered behind him to the candy wall. \"Can I have three of those chocolate bars?\" I asked. Mr. Hofman looked at me, then the bars, then back at me. \"Those are expensive, Elisha.\" He said. I shrugged. \"I'm sure I'll make up for it in cards.\" I said. Mr. Hofman smiled, and pulled two candy bars down. \"It's said that these bars are the best in the west. Came all the way from Cuba, specially made.\" Mr. Hofman said. \"What do you think?\" I asked him. He shrugged. \"never had one.\" Mr. Hoffman said, handing over the bars. I paid him the money, and opened one. I split it in half, and held one piece out for the man. \"Oh, no miss. I couldn't.\" 'Yes you can. If ya don't you'd be insulting me.\" I said, with a warm smile. I had found that threatening them with the 'you'd be insulting me' was a good way to manipulate people around here. Mr. Hofman looked at me, his eyes twinkeling with gratitude. \"Bless ya.\" He said, eating the other half. \"There will be two boys coming in here after me. Keith and Matt, I'm guessing. These two bars are for them. Tell them thanks for helping me out.\" I said, and picked up the basket.[Chapter 10] I walked out the door slowly, my smile fading. I didn't exactly want to go back to the hotel yet. But then again… I had to. Tomarrow was my day off. Not today. I slowly walked down the street, and kept my thoughts at bay… not wanting to think at all. I arrived at the hotel, and set the basket on the counter. Aunt May came in, and gasped. \"Dear what happened to ya?\" She asked racing over. \"Just got a little wet Aunt May.\" I said. \"Where'd you get that old thing on your shoulders?\" Lou asked, coming down the stairs. It was then I realized I still had Keith's coat on. \"Keith let me borrow it.\" I said simply. \"Here's the goods, with a few extra fruit for you guys.\" Lou looked through the basket, then back at me. \"Why don't you take a holiday today?\" Lou said, \"You look like you could use it. You've been acting so strange and I dare say its effecting the cookies.\" I looked at her. \"I can't. There's to much to do.\" I said. Lou rolled her eyes. \"I'll take care of it.\" Aunt May chimed in. \"After all, I did run the counter and kitchen most of the time before ya came here. I can handle myself. Go have fun.\" \"The boys came by a few times to ask if you could come out. Said you haven't been showing up lately. Everything all right Elisha?\" Lou asked. I looked down, not quite sure what to say. \"I don't know.\" I said softly. \"I honestly don't know.\" And it was true. It would be ok if I knew how to get back home. But I didn't know how to do that. \"Well, off with ya. And try to have some fun will ya?\" Aunt may said, scooping up the basket, she disappeared into he kitchen. Lou looked at me. \"Take your time. We won't need ya till tomorrow afternoon.\" Lou said. I nodded, and slowly went up the stiars to change. I got into some clean clothes, and squeezed my hair out best I could. I pulled my hair back into a French braid, and headed out the hotel door. Where would I go? I didn't know that either. So… I just followed my feet. I walked around town, with nothing to do, and almost boarded enough to go back to the hotel. But I didn't. I caught sent of Mary's perfume a few times, but didn't bother to look up. In fact, I was so content on following my feet, I knocked into someone. I looked up, and all I saw was a fist. It connected hard to my chin. I fell backwards, landing hard on the ground. I shook my head clear and looked up, rubbing my jaw. Wilson, Mary's older brother, was standing over me, with his own gang of four behind him. His eyes were blazing. I could see Mary watching from a distance, her face tear stained from crying on command. I felt blood trickle down my chin. I wiped it away, and stood up. Now in my time, you got in a fight, you were both punished. But here, whoever started the fight, got in trouble. Didn't matter if you finished it or not… you just didn't want to start it. And I was boiled up enough to finish it. \"What's up with you nut head?\" I hissed. \"You. You're my problem.\" Wilson said, his fists clenched. He swung again. Now in movies… you'd probably think the main characters would miss the swing… or dodge it or block it or finish them off before the next one came. But lemme introduce you to something. It's called movie magic. It's been practiced, rehearsed and tried. You can't just dodge or block a swing when you felt like it. SO when Wilson's fist came again… I got hit, right in the lip. I stumbled backwards, barely catching my balance. As soon as I did, I already knew my next move. Quicker then the eye could blink, I rammed my shoulder hard into Wilson's stomach. Then it started. The other four boys behind Wilson jumped. I was able to throw Wilson around, and knock them all off balance. But again, they were up, and swinging. I got knocked around maybe three times, before I swung. I nailed three in one swing, and turned to face Wilson. He charged. I quickly stepped out of the way, letting Wilson pass me, and I kneed him in the stomach again. For good measure, I jammed my elbow in his back. My head suddenly was jerked back and my head snapped around in pain. One of the boys had grabbed my hair with one hand, and the other closed around my neck. I struggled, but they all suddenly stopped. I opened my eyes. Keith and the rest of the boys were standing in front of us, arms crossed. \"That… was a cheep move. Uncalled for.\" Keith said, his eyes flames. \"So is this.\" I hissed, and I jerked my elbow and hit him hard where no boy should be hit. The boy instantly released me. I turned around, and nailed him in the face. He stumbled backward. Keith jumped into the fight. Along with Jacob, Matt, James, Caleb, , and a few others. They seemed to be handling their own, so I sank out of the fight. Soar, tired, and bloody. I stepped into the shadows, and disappeared from all unhanding eyes… something the time warp had allowed me to do with great talent. I disappeared, leaving my boys… my friends… finishing off the fight. I had to get away… get out of here… just leave for a while. I ran into the stables, wrote a quick note to Sam that I was taking a ride and didn't know when I'd be back, and mounted up bareback. I charged out of the stable, the horse ready for action. I raced out of town from the back side, catching no attention to myself. I could feel the horse's energy building up, ready to burst full of energy that had saved up over three weeks. I gave him a kick at at a gallop, the horse jumping in to full blast, leaving a trial of dust behind us, and nothing but open land in front. This would be the part I would miss when I got back home… IF I got back home. I loved that feeling of racing to nowhere, and not caring. The wind in my hair and face, the rhythmic beat of the hooves and the bounce of streaming across bare land. And I kept going. I wasn't on a road, and I let the horse steer himself. Full gallop I ran to no where, out into the nothingness. And I didn't know when I'd be back.[Chapter 11] I got back later that night. The sun was gone, and the town was swarmed in darkness with a few porch lights showing here and there. The De Luna hotel held noise of late nighters that reached my ears as I slowly walked in. They didn't need me yet. Lou said tomorrow afternoon. I turned the horse around, and walked slowly back to the stables. I dismounted, and led the horse into it's stall. I pulled bridle off, and set it next to the saddle I hadn't touched. I pulled Keith's coat up around my neck, and buttoned it up. It wasn't to cold that night, but there was a chilly wind. I could feel my lip layered in dry blood, and I felt under my chin was swollen. Not black or busied, and not to swollen, but it hurt badly. I saw Sam and taken my note, and written something back: 'have fun, take your time, and know that I'm here if ya need me.' It was singed with a SAM WILLEY. I set the note down, and dropped a few coins on top of it. Sam would be asleep now, so I wouldn't wake him up. Even if he wasn't up, I couldn't talk to him. What was I suppose to tell him? I fell asleep in 2002, and woke up in 1876, and I can't get back home. Yep… that made total sense. I'd probably be announced crazy and either locked up or hung. I rubbed my neck and stuck my hands in the coat pocket, and slumped out of the barn, quietly closing the door. I was tired, and the wind had picked up a bit. I walked slowly down the road, sticking to the shadows, when I felt the wind shift, and blow faster. I spun around, and found that Keith and the boys were coming down the road from the hotel. Why were they in there? Probably looking for me. Had they seen me? I ever so quietly sank back into the ally between the Livery and Land state buildings. They passed by me, whispering to each other. I blocked the words out, not wanting to care what they said. As the disappeared down the dark street, I came out and went the other way. At the end of the street, was the old church. The paint had worn off and boards were coming loose here and there. It would have been a good place to stay the night, but I passed it, knowing what was behind it. a little further up the hill, detached from the town, was an old barn. The town still used it, but only for stocking up hay and seeds and stuff. My shadow loomed through the doorway, with me behind it. I looked around, realizing I had never been here before. It was a simple barn with and thrust loft stacked with hey, a few stalls and a working bench. Tools lay everywhere, including old wheels, buckets, rakes, shovels, axels, wood, and metal hinges. I found an old ladder behind the last stall and climbed up, feeling sleep trying to seize my body. I found a nice place on the hey, and laid down, covering myself up with Keith's Jacket. I'd have to give it back tomorrow. I would probably find him… in…. I fell asleep. The next morning I woke up from a light shake. I could feel my shoulder being gripped and shaken. My first thought was Wilson. Without a second thought, I spun around, and kicked my leg out. I felt my foot connect with someone else's, and that person lost threre feet from under them and fell. Instantly I saw who it was. \"Oh! Keith I'm so sorry!\" I said, quickly coming to his side, \"Are you ok?\" He nodded, a bit out of breath. \"Hey guys, I found her.\" He called. I looked over the loft edge. There were the rest of the boys searching the barn. They all stopped and looked up. \"Hey Elisha.\" James said, \"Where you been?' \"Yeah we've been looking all over for ya.\" Matt said. \"Where's Keith?\" I bit my lip. \"He's fine.\" I said. I turned around and helped Keith to his feet. \"Sorry about that. Thought you were Wilson.\" I said. Keith straightened, and smiled back at me. \"He won't be coming out of his room for a while.\" Keith said. \"Wow… you ok?\" I gave him a puzzled look, then remembered my face was bloody and scarred. I nodded. \"It's dry blood.\" I said, curling my arms around me. 'What are you guys doing here?\" \"We found Sam, said you'd been out all day riding. We went out to look for you but never found you. We got back maybe a hour ago and found your horse in the stable. So we started looking for you around town.\" Said Fred. \"We got worried.\" \"Thanks.\" I said, \"But I can take care of myself you know.\" \"We figured.\" Keith said. He gave me a look I didn't recognize… something hidden behind his eye that almost scarred me. But it was gone and he headed down the ladder. I followed him. I jumped down off the last three steps, and landed gracefully on the dusty ground. \"So… Lou told us you got a day off yesterday. And you're free till this afternoon. Wanna hang around with us?\" Matt asked. I thought about it. \"Um, I don't know. I mean, I guess I can but… I mean…\" I didn't know how to say it, but I didn't want to hang around anyone right now. I wanted to get home. I wanted to leave. How was I suppose to tell that to these guys? I looked up at each of there puzzled and worried eyes. Some had split lips, a crooked nose, and even Jacob got a right shiner. I met Keith's gaze, and I shivered. \"Naw.\" He said, \"We got to feed the cattle this morning. We're gonna be out in the rattle snake valley for some cattle ranging. She woulnd't be back for Luna in time.\" Keith said, saving me the trouble. A few boys looked at him, puzzled, but kept quiet. We were starring at each other, his eyes endless pools and mine clouded. \"We'll se ya later. It's good to see you're ok.\" He said. the boys looked at me, then at Keith. \"Ok, see you later Elisha.\" Fred said. \"yeah. See ya.\" Caleb said, with a curious look at Keith. They all waved goodbye, except Keith, and left the barn, leaving me alone with the boy. \"You sure you're ok?\" Keith asked. I looked at him, knowing I couldn't lie to my best friend. \"No.\" I said. \"Want to talk about it?\" Keith asked. I curled my shoulders and shook my head. \"Aw come on. I can take it.\" he said with a smile. I looked up at him, my eyes sad, and the smile faded. \"It's serious isn't it? Is it what Mary said? look, don't worry bout that. You got a family here…\" I shook my head. \"I DO have a family.\" I said, looking away. Keith was silent. \"I have parents a sister and a brother.\" \"Well that's great!\" Keith said, \"So what's all this about? Where are they?\" I suddenly felt tears well up in my eyes. I had never cried since I came here. Ever. Not once. And now, I tried even harder to choke the tears back. But a thought of Seth, and Ellen, a thought of a family poker game, and a single tear dropped down my cheek. Keith didn't say anything. He had never seen me cry. We had been through a lot together in just three weeks, and some painful events, but I didn't cry. But now, standing there, arms hugging myself, bloody lip, sore body, and covered in hay, I cried. \"Elisha…\" Keith started. I looked at him. \"What happened? Is your family… dead?\" They way he said it… made me cry even more. They were dead, weren't they? I mean, come on… I didn't know if I could ever go back home, see them again… and the time I was living in now… they didn't exist. Great. More tears. \"Are they?\" he asked again. I nodded slowly. I felt an arm around my shoulder. \"Listen… a lot of people don't have a family. But in a town like this… they can start over. They build a new family. Sometimes better then the first.\" I wanted to punch him. He didn't understand. \"Many people come here because of a lost loved one. And then they refuse to start over. They linger in the past until they die. Eilsha, don't do that. Please? You're a nice girl. You don't deserve to have a rotten life. Whether you linger on their death is up to you. But the question is… do you want your family back? If you do, ya have to live life. Ya gotta try.\" I looked up at him. He had no idea. He turned and left. I sat down, my knees suddenly giving in. Was he right? No, yes. I didn't know, I didn't care. I just wanted to go home. But HOW? Think! I was good at that. Thinking. Ok, think. How did I come INTO this time? I fell asleep. But I had down that a lot here. Did it matter where and when I fell asleep? The bed in that room… the one I woke up in. Maybe there was something there. Something? LIKE WHAT! I began to get frustrated. I looked up to see Keith and the boys taking off on horses across the valley away from town. I had to do SOMETHING! And all I had was the room somewhere past Lincoln. How would I get there? How much money did I have… a lot. Ok… I set a goal. I would go for one more week earning money, cause I didn't know when my next opportunity would be to get a job. One more week, then I would ride out and find that house. How would I deal with those goons there? I'd figure that out later. But for now, I looked up again, to see Keith and the rest just disappearing over the hill. I smiled and jumped up. I raced out of the barn and down the street. I ran into the Luna Hotel, surprising the number of customers there, including Lou.[Chapter 12] \"Lou, can I talk to you?\" I asked. \"Well, can it wait?\" she asked. I thought, and shook my head. She sighed and pardoned herself from the customers, who nodded at her. Lou walked over, wiping her hands on a towel. \"What's this all about? Storming in here like that? You got a smile on your face, which is more then you've had in a long time.\" \"Look, the boys are going to herd up some cattle down by rattle snake. I was wondering if I could to with. I'd be gone all day.\" I said. Lou starred at me surprised, and for a second, I thought she'd say no. \"Why of coarse dear!\" she said, \"You've been so helpful these past weeks, without asking a single thing. And when ya do, I can't see myself to say no. Go for it. Just don't disappear like ya did last night, ya hear?\" I smiled and gave her a hug. \"Thank you!\" I said, and raced out of the hotel leaving Lou baffled. I ran down the street, and into the stable. I found my horse… all ready saddled. I looked around. \"keith said, you might come by.\" Sam said. I tuned around to see a tall black guy stide toward me with a giddy smile. \"Said to saddle it up, just in case you came. Did ya have fun last night?\" I smiled. \"yes. Thank you, Sam, you're a big help.\" I said. Sam's smile got bigger. \"Just bring along a few Eli's next time?\" he asked. I laughed and nodded as I mounted up. Same opened the gate for me and I flew out, waving goodbye to same. It took me about five mintues at full gallop to catch up to the boys. They were heading towards the River Torch Creek. Keith spotted me galloping toward them and stopped the small posse. I pulled my horse to a stop next to them. Keith leaned on his saddle starring at me. \"Need something?\" he asked. I smiled, and threw his coat his way. \"You forgot your coat.\" I said, \"And I'm boarded.\" Keith looked at me, then at the boys. \"Wadda ya say guys? Think we could use another hand?\" Keith asked. The boys nodded, with a few woops and cheers. We started on our way in no time. The cattle run was easier then I thought it was, and for some reason I knew what I was doing. We were about four miles out east of the town, and slowly moving the heard west. The boys were trying to keep the cattle from separating, while I was at the back, keeping them moving. I was laughing almost the whole time. The boys spent almost a whole hour trying to heard a bull back with the rest, while trying to stay clear of the horns. Even the horses got jibberish, and wouldn't move correctly. I wondered if my horse would do it, and could stand up with the bull. Finally the bull was back in, defeated, and the boys continued rounding them together and keeping them that way. We stopped for a little while at the creek, to let the heard drink. We watched from the hills, as they drank. They seemed calmer now… more easier to handle compared to now. They paced back and forth, and we had to keep chasing them back. Something about this place spooked them. \"Alright, boys… Elisha… watch out for bolting bulls. This place is never good at keeping cattle calm. They'll bolt like…\" just then seven bolted up the hill. Keith rolled his eyes and took off followed by three other boys. As they passed, four more took off in the other direction. The last two boys took off after them, leaving me watching the rest of the heard. When they were gone, and out of sight, still chasing the cattle down, the bull, and two others took off. I looked around, wondering if I had to do it. And I did. No one else was around. It couldn't be THAT hard could it? I took off after them, and stopped them before they finished a quarter of a mile. The bull's nostrils flared and it snorted. It was going to charge, spook the horse and take off. But my horse stood firmly underneath me. I looked the bull straight in the eyes, and glared, daring it to try. The bull hesitated, and the other two behind him groaned. I gently nodded the horse forward. Four steps… five steps… and the bull didn't move. Six steps… seven… finally the bull stepped back. Its ears twitched, and it turned around. I got them into a trot, all three of them, and we were back to the heard in no time. The boys still weren't back, and the cattle was still restless. I rode down the hill to the cattle, and circled them, bunching them up. Then, I pulled the horse to a slow walk, and began to whistle one of the tunes Aunt May taught me. It was slow, easy, and comforting. I went around the cattle, in circles, whistling the soft tune. Around and around I went, playing the tune over and over again. The cattle began to shift less, blow steam less often. Some began to hang their heads, and the flickering of there ears went down to following me around, listening to my tune. A few tails flipped in a calm easy gesture. Even the bull looked like he was falling asleep. I continued to whistle me tune, but stayed in one spot now. Even the air felt easier to breathe. There was a bored snort from the bull, and then the boys came over the ridge, the cattle in front of them. They joined th heard, and I thought I would have go around and calm them down again, but they stayed settled and easy. The ones that joined them soon were rocking their heads gently. My whistling got softer and softer, until the only sound was the light wind, and the trickling creak. I went back up the hill and joined the boys. \"Don't EVER leave me alone like that again. The bull took off with two others! I didn't know what to do!\" I snapped. Keith looked at me, then the cattle, then at me again, baffled. \"Looks like you got everthing under control here.\" Jacob said. \"I saw you take the bull back. You probably could of just had him FOLLOW you here he was so obidiant. What did you do? All I saw was that you stopped him.\" \"We thought he was going to charge, and you guys just stood there for like a death defying minute!\" Matt said. I rolled my eyes and shrugged. \"Just let him know who I was.\" I said, 'and I'm not someone to be pushed around.\" \"How'd you calm the cattle like that?\" Keith asked, his voice clipped. I looked at him. \"Just an old trick my dad taught me.\" I said, my own voice firm. Keith let it drop. \"Well, one' things for certain… you got a way with the cattle. Mind getting us moving miss Cattle woman?\" Fred said. I rolled my eyes, and headed back down. I got to the back of the heard, while the boys took the sides. I started at a low whistle… the suddenly went high pitch. The cattle woke up, jerking there heads. I pushed my horse forward, forcing the cattle to move. With the help of the whistles and yelling and my sudden talent, we had the cattle in town and in pens in no time. My work with the cattle soon spread through town, and when I got back to the hotel, Lou greeted me with Cattle Woman. I rolled my eyes and headed up stairs. I kicked off my shoes and got ready for bed. I fell asleep with the thought of just one more week, and then I was going to try to get home.[Chapter 13] The next morning, the hotel was empty, other then those few men playing cards at the table. I brought out some Eil's for them at no cost, and set to work cleaning the counter. When I was finished with the galsses, I went back in the kitchen, to pull the freashly backed Eli's from the oven. I set some aside for Mr. Hofman, like I promiced. As I cut the cookies, I heard the door swing open out front, and about four men walk into the hotel. \"I'll be out in a minute!\" I called. And scooped the cookies from the tray into a jar. I wiped my hands off from the cocolate and walked outside. There were three men I didn't recognize, sitting a table in a shadowed corner. The forth man was at the bar, his head down. \"What can I get for ya?\" I asked, setting the towel down. \"heard there's some good grub here.\" He said. His voice was young… easy but firm and hard. \"Sure.\" I said, \"We got the best cookies here in all of New Mexico.\" I said. \"Baked em myself.\" \"Did ya now.\" He said. from his voice… from the way he spoke… a feeling started in my stomach. I didn't know what it was. \"They're twenty cents.\" I said, \"Anything else?\" 'Whisky.\" He said, \"Four.\" I hesitated, and pulled out four cups and filled them to the top. The young man took the cups and brought them over to the table. He came back, and I guessed he wanted the cookies. I went in the back, and fetched eight cookies. I gave them to the boy, and he paid up without looking up. They sat in the corner for a long time, whispering, drinking. They like the cookies that's for sure. They kept buying them. But they only ate a few. Saving them up I guessed. The forth came up again to the bar. \"More Eli's?\" I asked, 'Or refills?\" I said it almost snoddy. And I guessed the kid sensed the anger in my voice and looked up. I gasped. I was starring into light blue piercing eyes. The boy. The boy I had seen in the jail house. The boy that had killed the sheriff, was starring back at me. I knew he recognized me, cause there was a flicker in his eyes. \"Both.\" He said. I slowly gave him the cookies, and gave him a bottle to refill their glasses. The boy nodded and took em back to the table. I hesitated, and slowly washed the glasses, my eyes glancing over at them. On the side of my eye, I saw them look at me… and my heart skipped a beat. What were they going to do now? I was in deep trouble. Where they here to kill the sheriff? No. I wouldn't let them. The sheriff was a close friend. I wouldn't let them close. My eyes wondered to the men's holsters. They had a pistol each, but the boy had two. Cross draw. What was I going to do? Lou was in the back, playing pocker, and Aunt May was at home, taking the day off. I was here alone. The two men playing cards glanced at me, then at the men. They noticed I was nervous and knew something was up. I caught their gaze, erdging them to come over. They set down their cards, and came to the bar with their cups. One leaned over, as I filled their cups. \"What's up?\" he asked in a low voice. \"Those men… they're murders.\" I whispered back. He pulled back, and took his drink. He finished it off, set his glass down, and walked solemnly out the door, his friend close behind. They were going to get the sheriff. I took a deep breath to try to calm myself. But I felt a fear grip my heart, as they all stood up, looking at me. I tried not to panic… and suddenly… I wasn't. Like the fear had just dropped. I knew what I had to do. Keep them here till the sheriff arrived. I went back to the kitchen, and I heard them follow me. I shut the kitchen door, knowing it wouldn't do much. But then I reached up over the cabinets, and pulled my old rifle down. I loaded it quickly, my fingers suddenly as slick as butter over silk. I wasn't shaking, or scared. I was calm and ready. The door opened, and I cocked the rifle. \"Don't move a finger you slimy pieces of hog turds.\" I said coldly. The man stopped, surprised a girl my age had them at the other end of a rifle. I looked them over… only three… and the boy was missing. I cursed under my breath as I remembered the back door. There was suddenly a small sound, and the wind around me shifted. There was a click of a gun, and I felt something hard agansit my back. \"That's not very nice.\" The boy said behind me. \"Drop the gun hot shot.\" I did so, very slowly. One of the men came up and took it from the ground. It was a dark skinned, dark haired indain. As I said it, something in my mind told me Mexican Indian. \"Where'd those men go?\" \"What men?\" I said. The boy laughed. \"You got a slick tongue for being on the wrong side of a gun.\" He said. I frowned, and spun around, smacking the gun from his hand. I grabbed his arm and twisted it, coming behind me. With my other hand, I grabbed his gun and cocked it, pointing the barrel at his head. Everyone froze as I held the boy by the throat from behind, a pistol to his head. Even I was surprised I had done that… yet I felt no fear in me. Something that I should have felt. \"Now who's on the wrong side of the gun?\" I snapped in his ear. The boy hesitated. \"You are.\" He said. Three more gun cocked, and the men at the door, had their barrels aimed at me. I grinded my teeth. Great. I relocked the gun, and let go of the boy. He took the gun from my hand with a smile. \"Thanks.\" He said. I glared at me. And he just smiled back, quicker then the eye could blink, his gun was twirled around, cocked and aimed at me. I frowned and put my hands up, surrendering. I hated that… but I had nothing on me. No guns… nothing. There was a cold knock at the back door, and the sheriff called quietly. The boy jerked his head at the men. They quickly grabbed my and dragged me out into the hotel… and up the stairs. We were heading down the hall, when I saw my room. There was only one man holding me on my right side… as was my door. Without thinking twice, I gripped the mans arm, jumped up and kicked the wall on my left, sending us both flying through my door and into my room. I rolled over, reaching for his gun, but there was a gunshot… and I jerked back. The boy grabbed my shirt and pulled me to my feet. \"Pull another stunt like that again and I'll strangle you.\" He said, his voice cold. My eyes flared and I spat in his face. He threw me against the wall. The other men piled into my room, and the kid shut the door behind them, his pistol in his hand. \"Out here.\" One man said. He was looking out the window. My window lead to the back of town… and not two far was the stables… and my guess their horses. One opened the window, and leaned out. When no one was looking, my hand snaked under the mattress and my fingers curled around my pistol. In a flash, I snapped it out, aimed and fired. The window shattered, and all the men ducked. I fired again, this time knocking the man's gun away from his hand. I fired again, splitting another man's holster off, and another shot took care of the third. They all froze. It was the boy who spoke first. \"You only got one shot left. And there's four of us.\" He said. I rolled my eyes. And before anyone could blink, I aimed up, and fired my last shot. The light in the ceiling shattered, and it went black. I grabbed the bag of my money and At the same time, I moved with sped people whished to have. I flew out the door and into the hallway. I tried to go down the hall, by I was suddenly smashed into the wall. The boy picked me up and shoved me back into the room. This time they held me at gunpoint. They headed out the window, with me in the middle. In no time, we were in the stables. I quickly saddled my horse, and they tied it to their own. I got on, still at gunpoint, and we all raced out without another word.[Chapter 14] We were about a full days hard ride from town, when we slowed. I didn't know which way we were going, cause I was blindfolded, gagged and bound. Good for them I was both. If I had seen where we were going, I could steer the horse with my knees, and if I could talk, I would be screaming and yakking the whole way. And I think they knew that. As night fell, I began to fall asleep on the horse. I could feel my money bag bouncing under my shirt. I drifted off, and was shaken roughly. I leaned forward in the saddle, and kicked out with my foot. Whoever I hit, I nailed hard in the stomach, and I heard the 'bluuuu' of the person. I heard the boy laugh. \"She's a handful ain't she?\" he said. \"Why did we take her anyway?\" said another man. He was older, seemed wiser. Even blindfolded I matched the voice to the blonde hair brown eyed man. He wore a rugged hat and brown pants. A white flimsy shirt with a dark brown coat. \"Because, Doc,\" the boy said, \"We couldn't just tell her to drop the gun and walk away. Sides she saw us and knew who I was.\" \"Right.\" I cursed under my breath through the gag, and suddenly, we stopped moving. I heard the others get off their horses, and one came over to my left side. \"Would you like some help down?\" the voice was Doc's. Kind and considerate. But I knew better. I kicked out again, this time nailing him in the chest. The boy laughed again. \"Wooohoo Doc! Got jammed by the lady!\" came another voice. This one I took to be the rugged, dirty one. There could have been a whole world of fleas leaving in his clothes. I was suddenly grabbed around the waist and dragged off the horse. I was pushed down roughly, and told to stay. Stay? Like some pup? HA! I felt behind me, looking for something to cut the ropes off my hands. Nothing to sharp, but I did find a rough rock. Before the men could even BEGIN to set up came, I was working away at the ropes. About an hour later, I was still at it. I heard a fire crackle, and the men settle down around it. One of them walked over to me… I guessed the boy because his footsteps were lighter. The gag was ripped off along with the blindfold. \"Howdy!\" the boy said, \"Nice to see those lovely green eyes again.\" I frowned, and he smiled. \"you to I guess. What something to eat?\" I just glared at him. And surprisingly, his smiled turned, and he frowned. \"Who are you guys?\" I asked. The boy sat down, still frowning. \"Well, not much by the gang name yet… but I'm Doc.\" Said the blonde, \"The dirty one is Steve, and that over there…\" he pointed to a dark figure standing out of the fire's light… the Indian… \"Is Shavez.\" The figure tipped his hat. \"And that son of a gun, with no sence over there is…\" \"Doc shut it will ya?\" Steve said, \"Man's gotta eat in silence.\" Steve started poking away at his tin plate full of food. \"So does a girl.\" Doc said. He picked up a plate and walked over to me. \"Look, we're not gonna hurt you.\" I flickered my eyes over to the boy. Just one look at his eyes told me he was the unpredictable kind. \"I won't let him.\" I looked at Doc, startled. \"Not that he would.\" He held up the plate. \"Hungry?\" I looked at him, wondering. A thief like him with such nice manners. Why was he with that murdering boy over there. My eyes sweeped back to the boy, and Doc chuckled. \"Don't try anything. He may be just a kid but he can whoop some butt. Don't matter if it's a ladies this time around either. Now… some food?\" I grinded my teeth and nodded. I WAS hungry. I never ate before I left town. So yeah, I was hungry. Suprisingly, Doc untied me. He set the plate down in front of me. \"Thanks.\" I said. \"Just remember. Nothing funny.\" Doc said kindly, \"For some reason, that kid's a bit itchy around you.\" I looked up, startled, but he stood up and left. Around me? That kid? Why? I had no clue… but I didn't want to find out. My hands were free, and my horse wasn't but five yards away. But the food came first. I didn't exactly take my time eating it. I had to get ahead of the others. As I did, I memorized where each man had his guns. Steve had a sawed off rifle leaning against his saddle maybe three feet away. Doc had his pistols under a blanket, and a rifle on top of that. But both those were behind him. The Indian didn't have a gun. But he played with a knife around his finger. I guessed he had more of those. But he put his knife away, in a buck skin sheath behind his back on his belt. I'd have at least a three second run before he realized I was running, and pulled out his knife. But the kid… the boy had his pistols right there. He was leaning on his saddle, knees up and eating. But one hand was always free. The plate was on the ground, and he held the fork, but one hand was always free. And that had was closest to his pistols. As I watched, the boy kept shifting his eyes over at me. I just glared back, and he would look away and finish chewing talking or whatever. The boy… dang it. He had his guns within a half a second reach. How was I suppose to do anything with that? Ok… think. I had at least one second surprise… not including the kid. He was expecting something with his shifty blue eyes. But other then that… I had one second surprise… and the longest it would take for them to get weapons and propose them to me…. If they were good… was about two seconds. That did leave me much. But that kid. Arrh! He was ruining my plan… and he knew it to. I wanted to throw my plate at him… but a thought suddenly came to me. My plate… and empty tin plate. And the fire. A distraction. I would throw the plate like a Frisbee, straight at the fire. They had set up the wood in a tee pee style. So if I could hit it just right… it would knock over. Giving me about a three seconds of surprise. Not much to work with there, huh? Ok… so I couldn't get to my horse… but did I need to? I looked at the circle around the fire. Steve's rifle was close to me. Maybe less then two yards. I had to be fast. And accurate. I gripped my plate, starring at it as the fire light shinned dully against it. This was going to be dangerous. Oh yeah… reall dangerous… just the way I like it. Without any more hesitation, I threw the plate, and jumped to my feet. I half chased the plate as it hit the fire… just a bit off target… but it still fell. It fell with a crackle and the flames burst, and then went down. They snapped around, their hands going for their weapons… bit I already had mine. It was loaded, cocked, and pointing straight at Steve. They all stopped. My eyes had suddenly took the wild look of the fire just seconds before it went out. \"I swear, you remind me of my mother.\" Steve said. I almost had to smile, but I didn't. \"Shut up.\" I snapped. \"What do you think you're doing?\" the kid asked, his eyes dancing. \"Getting out of here, numbnuts.\" I said. Steve laughed, his eyes shifting to the boy. \"She called you numbnuts.\" Steve said… \"She just…\" \"Shut up Steve.\" The boy said, his eyes flaming. Steve did. \"Now, you can't be getting out of here.\" \"And why not?\" I asked. Billy shrugged. I was suddenly aware that I only saw three men… or two men and a boy. The Indain was gone. I heard the ever so slightest crackle, and the wind change. I spun around, slamming the butt of the rifle into the Indian's stomach. I then jerked my elbow up and nailed him under the chin. At the same time, I heard clicks behind me. I didn't have to turn around to know how many guns were pointed at me. I spun around and before I could cock my gun, I felt cold metal agansit my neck. \"Alemina, Chika.\" The Indian said in my ear his voice hot and angry. I slowly lifted my hands, the rifle in one. The boy stood up, and jerked the rifle from my hand. He leaned into my face. \"Your quick.\" He said, his piercing blue eyes starring hard into my mind. But there was a spark there to, something I knew was suppose to scare me. My eyes flared and gave him a glare so hard it could bruise. That spark in his eyes disappeared, and was replaced with something I didn't recognize. \"Pull a stunt like that again, and you'll be dropping more then a pistol.\" He grabbed my shoulder. Forgetting about the knife, I kneed him in the stomach and tried to swing at him, but he ducked. \"You ever touch me again, you're going to be HOLDING parts to keep yourself from looking like some freak from mars… you mutated pig.\" Billy frowned. From the look in his eye, I know he wanted to say something back, but he turned around and sat down. Shavez, set his hands lightly on my shoulders. Why he did that after I just slammed the kid for doing the same thing… I don't know. But my eyes were on the kid. Shavez pushed me forward gently, and placed me in the circle around the fire. Steve came behind me and tied my hands back up… but left the gag off. I starred at the fire as it licked the sky and crackled in the night. The heat warmed me up, and hugged my face. I didn't need a mirror to know my eyes flamed just as madly as the fire. But I could feel eyes pinning me down. Light, but hard blue eyes watching me. There was no use in escaping tonight. I was tied back up, and had already put them on skittish. I had made a move and they would put a watch up tonight. Well that was fine. I could get some sleep now. I laid down, and fell asleep… or so they thought. After a while of 'sleeping' my breathe became slow and steady. I let my mouth hang open slightly, and let my body relax. Maybe about an hour of 'I wish I really WAS asleep' and they changed their conversation to something interesting.[Chapter 15] \"Billy, what's with you?\" Doc said, suddenly changing the subject from sheriffs. \"What?\" the boy named Billy said, \"Ain't nothing wrong with me.\" \"If that was true, you would have slapped that girl silly. Chewed her out, and decided she'd be missing breakfast the way she snapped at you.\" Steve said. \"You don't look at her the way you do the rest.\" Shavez said. \"You've seen her before?\" Doc asked. Billy was silent. \"Yeah.\" He said, \"before I broke from Lincoln. She was put in the cell next to me for smart mouthing the law.\" \"She wasn't there when I went in.\" Doc said. \"She's the one that made that whole. She broke the lock by sticking a pin in the hole. Whatever she did the lock snapped open like butter. They she looked around, and just starred at the wall. At first, I thought she really was crazy.\" \"I heard about that in town.\" Shavez said, \"She's crazy alright… crazy like you, Billy.\" I heard Billy laugh, in his light mood again. \"Anyway, she was just starring at the wall, when she suddenly decided to pull out a plank. I was about to stop her, but she made no sound. The rest of the wall didn't give way. She had the whole thing planned out, and somehow, she was smart enough to pull the right board to make the rest of the wall weak, and do it without a sound.\" Billy said. \"Billy… that's IT? That's why you didn't knock her upside the head?\" Steve said, chuckeling. Billy hesitated. \"All I'm gonna say is we're keeping a good eye on her.\" Billy said, and took a sip of his coffee. \"Come on Billy, there's more to it.\" Doc said. \"Yeah, so what? I ain't figured it out yet.\" He said, his voice ringing with a amusement, \"But when I do, boy… I know I'll be surprised to find answer… and I'll be surprised by the answer itself.\" The others were quiet. \"What should we do with her tomorrow then?\" Steve asked. \"Kill her.\" Billy said. My blood froze. \"Hey, Billy, a Chika? Why would we kill a girl?\" Shavez said. \"Alright… we won't. We'll take her with us.\" Billy decided. \"Great.\" Doc's voice came, \"I'll tell her in the morning.\" \"Don't have to.\" Billy said, his voice smooth, \"She heard.\" I frowned, but kept my eyes closed. They couldn't see me, my back was to them. Billy was the first one up for night watch. It was dark, and the fire was out, so I could never see where he was. then Steve took watch. He came over once to check on me and ended up scaring me to death. I just about beat him to a pulp. Then Doc. He told me where he was, and asked why I wasn't asleep. I said I couldn't. to much going on. Plus I didn't trust him enough to fall asleep. I heard Doc chuckle. \"How bout I kill two birds in one stone. I'll hum… a soft tune, to ease the sleep. But loud enough for you to know where I am.\" He said. I was silent. Then quietly agreed, surprised by his kindness. My thoughts of Doc, drifted to Billy. He had killed the sheriff, kidnapped me, and just got on my bad side… but for some odd reason… I didn't hate him. I couldn't place why, but like he said, there's more to me then meets the eye… same goes for him. My last thoughts before I fell asleep were of Billy… and I suddenly knew what more was behind those piercing blue eyes… I wouldn't remember it in the morning. I found myself being dragged to my feet, and pushed on my horse. \"Hey Billy!\" Steve's voice said, loudly. \"Come look see this!\" I opened my eyes and saw I was on top of my horse, with Steve at the side. He had a split lip and was looking at the horse. \"What now Steve?\" Doc said. \"You know that there story me and Charlie told ya? Bout the one where some girl suddenly ran from the spare bedroom and out the house?\" I froze. \"You mean the girl that suddenly appeared out of nowhere?\" Billy said sarcastically. Steve nodded. \"THis is er.\" Steve announced, \"Look, this is the horse was stole over in Arizona. Same horse the girl took.\" They all looked at me, and I could feel my cheeks turning red. 'Dang good shot to!\" Steve said, \"You know that was me fav hat? Put a hole right through it, and something tells me you weren't aiming at my HEAD.\" Billy pulled his horse up to mine. \"Were you that girl?\" he asked. I glared at him, and nodded. \"How'd you get into the house without anyone knowing?\" I looked away, keeping my mouth shut, giving him the sign I wasn't going tell nothing. Billy frowned, but turned his horse, and kicked it into a run. \"Regulators! Let's skin out!\" I jerked, and it wasn't because of the movemtn of the horse. That sounded oddly familiar… from a movie… Young guns…. Doc… Shavez… Steve… and Billy. My blood ran cold with my new discovery. My face went pale and any fire in my eye went out. No way. Doc saw me first… and stopped the posse. \"Wow, hey you ok?\" He asked. I looked at him. I knew who he was… his life, his past his future… everything. \"Doc Sherlock.\" I said. He looked at me oddly. \"How do you know my n…\" he started. \"You almost lost your tigger finger about two years ago. Want to be a teacher… and fell in love with a Chinese women traded for a ruined shirt to Murphy.\" Doc was speechless, his face hot red. I turned to Steve. This was crazy, but I felt I had to keep going. \"Steve… Dirty Steve. Haven't take a bath in four years… apparently a new record. Chew's at LEAST two tobacco bags a day. Shavez… Mexican Indain.\" Shavez's eyes flickered with surprise and pride. I heard Steve murmur something. \"Good with knifes… found family was killed by soldiers after coming back from a ambush and being the only survivor. They promised you meat… all you got was rotten food.\" the flicker in his eyes died. \"You also have others with you… Charlie… young and skitterish. Fell in love with a Mexican woman…. Richard… also know as Dick… he's dead. Killed by a bounty hunter who had killed more people then smallpox.\" All their eyes went wide… except Billy's. His narrowed and focused completely on me. \"Then there's you.\" I said, meeting his gaze bravely, \"William H. Bonney. Alias Billy the Kid. All the papers say you're a left hander… but you're good with both hands. Young and vigorous. Laughs even when on the other side of the gun.\" \"How do you know all that?\" Doc asked, lightly, \"Nobody knows Billy's real name.\" \"You all worked for a man named John Tunstall, right?\" All their eyes went dark. \"Killed by Murphy's men… and Sheriff Brady, for land and a cattle run. Took renigades in, had a soft spot for em. Billy was the last one to be recruited before John died. You were all suppose to be law, take down Murphy's men… but it turned.\" I said, my own voice sending shivers down my back. \"How do you know so much about us?\" billy asked, his voice calm. Suddenly I realized what I had done. I could have stopped myself… but I couldn't. And now it was to late. So play it off. I gave him, the slyest… most mysterious smile I could. \"Oh… I know MUCH more about you Billy.\" I said. Billy's own eyes lost their flare. Tell you the truth… just knowing who these guys were made me feel hollow inside. \"That means, the Sheriff you killed in Lincoln… was Sheriff Brady.\" I said. \"Still don't like it?\" he said, giving me his own smile. \"Good for you. If you didn't… I would have.\" I said, not so sure if I would. Billy's lips turned up in the slightest smile that no normal eye could have seen it… but my did. \"Did you know John Tunstal?\" Doc asked. I shook my head. And looked up. \"Look, we obviously got off on the wrong hand. I'm Elisha.\" I said, \"I don't want to get on your guys bad side…\" Billy smiled, glad I had a little fear from them, \"But then again… you don't want to get on mine.\" Billy shook his head and chuckled. \"No pretty intro will let those ropes loose.\" Billy said, kicking his horse into a run, the rest followed, me in the middle. I didn't know where we were going… but I could have guessed. A small Mexican village, where Billy was held in high regard. And I was right. We rode into the village, people coming out yelling out of joy, and waving to Billy. He had on a big smile and waved back yelling things to the ladies, and tipping his hat to the men. He pulled to a halt in front of a small casino, and we all walked inside, my hands still bound. Billy pushed me down at a table, and ordered a few beers. He sat down with a sigh, and tilted his head. \"So… Lish, you ever heard of… Pat?\" Billy asked. I grinded my teeth, and nodded. \"What do you think of him?\" \"Pat Garett?\" I said, \"Lying, thieving, back stabbing traitor. No better then the worn buckles on his boots.\" I said. Billy frowned. \"Really?\" he said, \"Cause you see, Pat is a good friend of mine.\" I stopped. It occurred to me that Pat had ridden with Billy once. And maybe they hadn't found out, Pat was going to be a sheriff and track them down. Would Billy dislike me for hating one of his so called good friends? But I still knew, Pat is the one who shot Billy, and most of his friends. I looked up at Billy in the eyes. \"I hate that guys guts. Next time I see him, they'll be spilling.\" I hissed. Doc chuckled. \"Billy, stop testing her.\" Doc said. I looked at him confused. \"Billy just playing with ya. We all know Pat. An old friend.\" \"Now he's after out hides.\" Steve said. \"Killed four already.\" Shavez said, his eyes dark with memory. The beer was set down at the table, and they all drank but me. I didn't drink. My eyes were clouded, but sharp and focused on Billy. The legend I had learned to love, was now sitting in front of me drinking beer after a chase. How cool was that! The thought made me smile and chuckle to myself. Billy looked at something. \"What's so funny?\" he asked. \"You. I can't believe your whole outlaw life, just started by stealing laundry. Now your out shooting sheriffs.\" I said. Billy slammed down his drink, but I didn't flinch. \"How the hell do you know so much?\" he said coldly, leaning forward. I leaned forward, getting right in his face, my eyes sparkling. \"You, will, never, know.\" I said slowly, each word clear and precise, and a smile spreading across my face. His eyes flickered, and he sat back. I leaned back in my chair. \"Is it true what you said last night?\" I asked, \"Something about me that's got you curious?\" Billy looked at me, and my smile… disappeared. That look in his eye… I'd never seen it before. Ever. It was so different, seeming like it filled his whole body, and sparkled and shined. \"I've figured it out.\" He said, \"You, Elisha,\" his eyes gleamed even more then I thought possible, \"you out of all the people, even though you know the most about me, how I kill, steal, snap a tongue once or twice, look at me with absolute certainty. No fear. Which is more then I've ever seen in even a man.\" Doc looked at him, Shavez stopped drinking, and Steve spit his tobacco out. \"I've seen men act like they know what they're doing. Act like they can take us, just to reassure themselves. But in the end, I always see that spark of fear. But you,\" he laughed, \"Nothing. At first, I just thought you didn't think I would pull the trigger. But after those stunts you pulled, I found myself standing corrected. You aren't scared of me. Am I right?\" I paused, thinking. I really wasn't. \"Not a bit.\" I said truthfully. I guess I had spent all my years looking him up, researching him, turning him into my number one fan forever… that it was just about impossible to fear him. But now, I just found him competition… I stopped, realizing what I had just thought. Billy the Kid, competition? No. No way. Nope. \"So you gonna let me out of these ropes?\" Billy let out a loud laugh I learned to be his famous one. \"Now why would I go and do a thing like that? I just told you, you don't fear me, even with a gun. All the more reason not to trust you untied.\" He went on with his drink. It was then I realized, that if I wanted to continue to search for a way home, I had to get these guys to trust me. Now that little interruption, I didn't mind. Didn't mind one bit. I mean how many people get to hang with their number one fan and get them to trust you? I'd say around 1% of the entire Earth's population! I rolled my eyes. \"I'd be a lot more help if I was untied.\" I said. \"A lot more help? Or a lot more trouble?\" Doc asked. I smiled at him. \"Both.\" I said finally, \"But I can help you out for Murphy and his men. Not like they have me on their side. Fact is, hate them, almost as much as Pat.\" Billy straintened, streaching his back like he was getting ready to say something, and he was trying to relax to say it calmly. He set down his beer and leaned both arms on the table. \"Now, answer this question, cause it may be life and death here.\" Billy said, keeping his eyes on the beer in front of him, \"How do you know about the war between us and Murphy and his men?\" it was a straightforward question… but I already knew my answer. Murphy and his men had killed someone who I had learned to love through the papers and history books. \"They killed a good friend of mine. A VERY good friend of mine. People like that, get between me and a friend… it dangerous. But when they separate me and my friend forever… it'd down right blood spilling on their side.\" I said, my eyes dark. I didn't look at any of them. John Tunstal was a true, honest, loyal man. He took care of renegades and thieves. Had a soft spot for them. He ran an honest cattle ranch, and the boys he had taken in, would help out and learn schooling and learn to start over. But that man was killed. Murdered unfairly. \"What was your friends name?\" Steve asked. I said nothing. Steve looked at Shavez, \"She deaf?\" \"No.\" Shavez said, \"Who was your friend, Elisha?\" I still said nothing. I didn't want to. The more I thought about it, the more the tears choked back. I was crying for a guy I hadn't even met. But yet, it seemed like I knew him. Something the time had played with again. The time had put me to know John… have real feelings for him. But soon, the sadness turned. Turned to anger. An anger deep inside that had only started as a small flicker. Just a tiny flame hidden from everyone. But now it was a blazing fire. That's one way to explain it. A blazing fire, ready to burn anyone who tried to put it out. \"Hey!\" Billy tried to snap me out of my trance. \"Who's your friend?\" somebody put a hand on me. Reflexes said to just shove it off. But not in this mood. I grabbed it hard yanked, twisted and jerked it upwards. With one final shove I sent Steve across the room. Shavez stood up, and before the eye could blink, my hands slid around his waist, yanked a knife out from his belt, and cut my ropes… all in one smooth move. I tossed the ropes aside, and sat back down. I slammed the knife down, point first on the table. Shavez slowly sat down, his eyes on me, like everybody else's… including the bar tender. Steve stood up, shook the dust from his hair and sat down. 'You could have killed me! Twisting my arm like that!\" Steve said. \"If she wanted to kill you, she would have already done it.\" Billy said, fingering his beer. His voice was quiet and smooth, but his eyes were laughing. Suddenly Billy looked up and the quick thumping of footsteps into the saloon. Instantly Billy's hand went to his pistol. A short man wearing a sombrero and poncho apperared at the doorway. he was panting and eyes wide. His tongue slurred as he made a mess of Spanish language, aimed at Billy. Billy stood up, his eyes wild and he smiled. \"Alright boys, we got company…\" he said.[Chapter 16] Instantly all of them stood up, as the Spanish man left. Billy diapered in the back room, Doc ducked behind the bar, while Steve and Shavez left out the back door. Leaving me standing there. Now I figured company meant more then one person coming. And with the hiding and the faint click of gun hammer's, I took it as unfriendly company. I looked at the table. There were four beers… all of them half empty or practically full. I grabbed them all and tossed them to the bartender, hoping he knew that he had to get rid of them. He did. They were all gone a few seconds, and then he picked up a towel and tossed it to me, and motioned for me to come around. With a quick glance out the door, I quickly walked behind the bar. The bartender gave me a few dirty glasses, and motioned for me to clean them. I nodded my thanks. I would pretend to work here. My eyes flickered to under the bar, where I could have swore Doc went under. But he wasn't there. A trap door maybe? Maybe it went further back then it appeared? Either way, he was well hidden. My mind wandered to the back room where Billy was. Hope he was well hidden to. All of them. Heavy steps made their way down the path and into the saloon. They were dressed in Calvary uniforms, each holding a long rifle. My eyes went dark. After looking them each in the eye, I knew they would shoot to kill. I was suppose to be afraid. I KNEW I should be scared. But I wasn't. I was incredibly calm. I cast my eyes downward and cleaned the glasses with the dirty rag I had in my hand. I wasn't shaking, I wasn't nervous, or sweating. My heart was calm, and I moved with ease. There wasn't a drop of fear in me. \"Hey, have you seen a boy about yay high, maybe seventeen, and in the company of three older men?\" the captain asked. I looked up calmly from my glass. They were talking to the bartender. His eyes were narrow, but fear shined through them, betraying him. I could see his knees were ever so slightly shaken. He spoke, but in a mumble of Spanish. \"I said, have you seen them!\" the man raised his voice, grabbing the bar tenderer's shirt. Again the man spoke, quicker, more of a blur and plea… but in Spanish. This time the captain raised his pistol, and held it to the man's head. \"I'll ask one more time.\" The tender was shaking now. Badly. His eyes were wide, and he was giving no effort to hide his fear. I stepped in. \"If you want an answer from him, shooting him won't be of any help.\" I said, with a spanish accent. The man looked at me. \"Who are you?\" he spat. \"I'm the bar hand. You boys want a drink?\" I asked. The man lowered his gun, and pointed it at me. I knew he would shoot, but still, not even a spark of fear. \"You, same question this man ain't answering.\" He said. \"Yes.\" I said honestly. \"But I forgot how long ago.\" The man stepped closer. \"Now I know that's a lie.\" He said, \"We trailed them in here bout ten minutes ago.\" A evil smile slimed across his face. I shrugged. \"All I know is they came in, they went out.\" I said. \"sorry couldn't be more help to you.\" The man frowned, his eyes beady. There was a thud from the back room, and the man jerked. \"Ma'am, please tell the bartender to step outside, and follow him.\" Said the captain. Without even opening my mouth, I was pushed out with the bartender. As soon as he stepped outside, and took off across the road and took cover. I scoffed. There was suddenly shooting from inside. I jumped and lost my balance. Ok, THAT scared me. Scared me out of my wits. I could have sworn I peed my pants! The shooting continued, and yelling. I ran across the street and took cover in an ally. The shooting went on for about three more seconds, then stopped. Then there was shooting further down the street. But that lasted maybe three seconds. In a few minutes, the men came out of the saloon. Billy was behind them, in shackles and a hood over his head. My eyes went wide. Steve was next, followed close behind by Doc and Shavez. All shackled, with hoods and at gun point. They were all loaded on horses, and in a few minutes they were gone. Leaving the streets empty. I didn't even bother going back into the saloon. I just kind of stood there, jaw dangeling a little, astonished at the sudden events. What was I going to do? I looked out towards the horizon where the outlaws had vanished. Should I follow them? They would hang in a few days, no doubt. But Billy was smart, he would get them out. ALL of them? The best he had ever done, was gotten himself out of jail. Could he get his friends out to? I blinked. Could I get them out? Would I be crazy enough to follow them and do it? I thought. If I did, and if I was, there would be no doubt about it, they would trust me after that. But doing that, and I would make myself an outlaw. Followed by the law, tracked down, hunted. My heart flew at the thought. Did I find that exciting? It was dangerous. But that's not what my heart was telling me. The only phrase that came to mind now was… time for some fun. My eyes sparkled. Probably something the time warp had changed. Instead of finding riding as an outlaw dangerous, bad and threatening, it made me find it as thrilling, exciting and fun. My eyes, flared, a plan already forming in my head. I walked down the street, each stride meaningful and strong. There was a solemn look in my face, and a dangerous gleam in my eye. I found the gun shop. The bartender was inside with a two other men. I looked around. I found all the guns here were familiar to me from the shooting range. I found two .44 pistols with ivory handles and a sharp looking metal, Winchester lever action rifle which I would saw about a half a foot off, and a shot gun. All of them just my size, and just my type. My favorite to use. I set them all on the counter, and kept looking around. I grabbed about two boxes of bullets for each gun. As I set to work on finding the leather working, a voice rose up. \"You looking for gifts for a friend young lady?\" a man asked. I looked up from the glass box. \"I'm looking for my own, thank you.\" I said. The man looked at me side long. \"Ah, ma'am. I'm sure your pa don't want you buying guns. Specially at this age. Just carrying a gun causes trouble.\" He said. \"Well then, are YOU going to go get Billy and the others?\" I snapped, standing straight. The man looked startled. \"Look, miss, that's no job for a lady. Not in a million years will women ever use guns! It just ain't natural.\" \"Where are you're holsters?\" I asked, ignoring him. \"I need cross action holsters for the left hand. Preferably with tags for the bullets.\" I said. The man was surprised I said those things. Ladies shouldn't know anything about any of that kind of stuff. \"Ma'am, your gonna get yourself killed.\" Said the other man. \"We can't let you do that!\" \"Are you gonna let Billy get killed?\" I asked, my eyes meeting his for the first time. He flinched and looked away. My eyes were blazing down. Both with anger and excitement. I found the holster I wanted, and looked for a shoulder belt with more bullet tags. I found one that would hold both shotgun and regular bullets. I set in next to the guns with the holster. I found a few nice looking knifes. Oh boy did I know how to use those. I set them on the counter to, mentally counting up the money I had to pay. I looked around for any other items. I ended up grabbing a saddle rifle-holster like the one on the first horse. It wasn't as nice, but it would do. It wasn't exactly money I wanted to spend, but trust me, I wasn't even leaving a DENT in the amount I had raised. \"This is it.\" I said. \"Young lady,\" the first man said. That's it. I pulled out my wad of money, and slammed the amount on the table. I gather the things up and stepped outside, with the bartender and the second man behind me. They ran off, no doubt to tell the rest of the town what I was up to. I loaded all my things onto my horse, making sure the straps were tight and useable. I emptied out the saddle bags, and put only the things I needed in. I went off again, and bought some food for the trip. I thought of everything. I bought rubber bands for my hair, a few pins for lock picks, some horse treats, a hankercheif, some leather gloves, an extra saddle bag, a roll up blanket, a saddle mat, a few tools for the horse to clean them out so he wouldn't limp, wire clippers, matches, rope, and last but not least a bag of tobacco for bribing the dumb ones. When I went back outside, the whole town was back on the streets, starring at me, whispering, talking, and pointing. I ignored them all, and loaded my supplies onto my saddle. Before mounting up, I loaded all my guns, including the shot gun. I buckled the holsters on, and slid the pistols into the fits. There was a comforting weight on each of my hips now, and I actually felt safer, though I knew it wasn't true. I slid one knife into my boot, and the other in the back groove of my pants. This had a reason. If my hands were tied behind my back, it would be easy to reach the knife without anyone seeing it. I filled the tags with bullets, slipping the shoulder belt around my right shoulder. I felt prepared. I mounted up, and took a deep breath. When I turned my horse around, there were a few men standing in front of me. My eyes flared, but I said nothing. By the look in there eye, and the way they stood, they weren't there to stop me. There were small, skinny Spanish men, their eyes blank. \"We are letting you go for one reason.\" The man in the middle said, \"Otherwise we wouldn't have even let you buy the guns.\" I almost rolled my eyes. And exactly HOW were they intending to stop me before? Even with fist they were no match for me with this anger. \"Mind telling me that reason, so I can be on my way?\" I asked, my eyes dark. \"We're letting you go, because we see something in your eyes we recognize. Almost horrifying.\" I waited for them to continue, \"You have the same wild look in your eye, that Amigo Billy has.\" They said. I blinked. I WHAT? \"We are warning you, that that look can cause more trouble then you think. But we think you just may be as daft as Billy… daft enough to get them out.\" Without another word, they disappeared into the crowd. I hesitated, my eyes scanning the crowd. I grinded my teeth, realizing how much time I had already wasted. I kicked the horse into a full run. The crowd parted and I busted out of town. I rode hard, thinking of Billy and the gang. I pictured Billy galloping through the dead valley, his hair ruffeling in the wind, making tracks hard and fast, and a famous smile across his face. I brought my mind back to myself. The wind in my hair, kicking up dust behind, loaded with deadly, yet somehow comforting weapons, and an thrill ahead. My heart fluttered, and a wide grin spread across my face. Maybe I WAS like Billy the Kid.[Chapter 17] IT took me one day to reach Lincoln at a hard ride. When the town came into view, I slowed down to a trot. I steadied my self , and let go of the hands with ease. I had perfect balance as I pulled my hair back, and hid it under my hat. I rubbed my hand over the saddle wiping the stray dust off. I gave my face a good scrub, giving it a dirty look from the dust. A girl wearing pants and this many guns, would attract unwanted eyes. But Now I would get no more then a glance as pass buyers. I rode into town, and pulled my horse up to a rail in front of the saloon. It was very common for visitors to go to the saloon first. And, as I expected, the Sheriff came in soon afterward and walked straight up to me as I bought a bottle of whisky. \"Howdy.\" He said. 'Howdy.\" I said back, keeping my voice low and deep. \"What bring you to Lincoln?\" the sheriff asked. I looked at him, my eyes clouded. They wandered to the silver star on his vest, then back to my drink. \"Sorry to offend you, but see, I'm the law round these parts, and I keep the peace. I like to keep my eye on things… specially new comers.\" \"Just passing through. Maybe a day or two stay.\" I said, \"Whiskey?\" \"Don't mind if I do.\" He said. I bought another whisky and handed it to him. It was always good to get on the sheriff's good side. \"Thank you.\" I nodded, \"Names Daley.\" I stopped. My name… wouldn't be good for this man. Elisha? HA! No, think quick. \"Will.\" I said, the first name coming to my head. \"Well, Will, anything I can do for ya, just come holler.\" He said. He started to walk away. \"Sheriff?\" I called. He stopped and turned around, \"Since I am staying for a few days, and I hate boring cities, mind telling me if anything worth getting out of bed is going on round here?\" The sheriff chucked and nodded. \"Well, we got a hanging tomarr'a morning. Some famous outlaws. Round nine.\" He said, \"Then there's a party as Miss Cane's house. Anybody's invited.\" I nodded, and he left. Tomorrow morning? That didn't give me much time to plan. I had to think of something fast. It didn't take long, before an idea popped into my head. I grabbed the bottle of whiskey and walked out of the saloon. I walked my horse down to the jail house, where I saw the deputy was inside. Billy was without a doubt inside. But I had to talk to him. I knew they wouldn't let people talk to outlaws the day before a hanging. So how was I going to do this? Easy. I walked inside, and tipped my hat to the deputy. I gave him the bottle of whisky. \"For the young prisoner. Help settle his nerves if he has any.\" I said. The deputy hesitated then, nodded. He disappeared in the back, and I heard the faint voice of a young man. Billy. I left. Quietly and quickly. I tied my horse around the back of the buildings and found the jail outhouse. I found a spot hidden behind the buildings… and waited. I hate waiting you know that? It took three dang hours for Billy to finish off the whisky and figure he had to go to the bathroom. He came around, his hands in shackles, and held at gun point by the deputy who was close behind. The deputy shut the door behind Billy, and turned to guard. I pulled my hat down low, and took off my vest and over shirt, and pulled my handkerchief up around my nose. Now you couldn't recognize me. In a few minutes, I had gotten behind the outhouse, and knocked the guard out. I pulled the knife from my boot, and waited AGAIN. Finally Billy came out. In a flash, I had my knife on Billy's neck, and him in a tight grip. Billy froze and tenced. \"Where are your horses?\" I asked. \"Idiot!\" Billy hissed, \"If all ya wanted was our horses, you could have asked the sheriff! They're free for anyone who claims the first!\" \"Oh, but the sheriff doesn't trust me that much. I have a different purpose for them.\" I said, keeping my voice low, \"Just tell me where they are. Besides, what are they do you anyway?\" I said, tightening my grip as he tried to pull away. I was amazed at his strength in such a short build. And I was amazed at how I was able to hold him. \"In the barn behind the old shack.\" Billy said, \"They ain't no good for breeding, so forget it.\" \"Oh, I don't want them for breeding, Billy.\" I said. He stopped. \"How do you know my…\" he started. \"Just tell your gang to stay on their toes… and to hold their breath when the noose pulls tight.\" I let go. Billy swung, but hit only air. I was quick, and I was gone. I quickly found the sheriff and gave him the hint to go look by the outhouse. Billy was back behind bars, a odd expression on his face, and the sheriff thanked me. I had his trust now. I bit into my jerky, and trudged down the street toward the barn. I found their horses easy, but didn't take them. Instead, I put out a bad word for them, so no one would by them. I said they were old, used up creatures that wouldn't be worth the free price. That kept everyone well away from them. I didn't check into a hotel when it became darker. Instead I paid the barn keeper to watch over my horse, and I found a dark ally, and slept. The next day was going to be fun[Chapter 18] The morning I woke up, I first realized my toes were cold. I sighed and sat up. Rubbing my head, I tucked my toes underneath me to keep the warm, and pulled my leather jacket up close around my chin. I would have to be quick for today. I would have to be acruate and perfect. Never missing a beat or a moment. Easier said then done. But right now… my stomach grumbled. I yanwed and pulled myself to my feet. I fixed my hair and hat, straightened my clothes and dusted myself off a little. When I got out to the street, I found folks had already started their day. I had slept in. That would make sence if I had ridden hard a whole day, and hand't slept that night. Wait…. I slept in? Then what time was it? My heart raced. And I felt like I was going to panic. \"Hey, what time is it?\" I asked a younger boy who was passing my quickly. \"Quarter to nine, last time I checked.\" The boy said. \"That was ten minutes ago!\" a girl snapped at him. \"Come on, we'll miss it! Scuse' us sir, we gotta run.\" The boy and girl ran off down the street. And now that I was paying closer attention, the entire crowd of people had somehow all moved to the gallows at the street. I swore under my breath. No time to set up my plan now. I had to act. Easy. I ran down to the barn. The barn keeper wasn't there. I took my friends horses, and my own and rode behind town until I got just behind the bank… which was three houses down from the gallows. I pulled my pistols out, checked them all to make sure they had bullets. Then I loaded my rifle. I slung it over my back, and stood on the horses back. Climbing to the top of the bank, I found I was just behind crowd starring at four people standing with a noose around their neck. They were waiting until nine. About five minutes to go. Quickly I climbed down, and searched the rest of the town, making sure the town had been emptied back there. I made a quick stop at the sheriffs office and picked a few locks to get to the gang's weapons. Then I ran back, mounted my horse and had the rest follow me all the way around to the other side, so I had a clearer shot. I fit all the weapons on to the saddles, and I pulled my rifle out, my blood pumping with excitement. This all started with the man pulled the lever. Finally it was nine. Men came up, tightened the nooses, and began to list all of the crimes the outlaws had committed. I laughed at a few when I heard 'Smearing glue on the sheriffs chair, shaving a layers head, and giving a nasty hair cut to the deputy's dog. I bit my tongue. I had to keep quiet. The man stopped talking, and I pulled my handkerchief up around my nose to cover my face. Finally, a man gripped the lever, and I tensed. Even my blood seemed to freeze, waiting for the moment to start the fury. My stomach lifted, and I bit my lip. Without a breath or a blink, I lifted the rifle to my shoulder and aimed. I was going to have to be fast. Four bullets, more accurate the ever. The man pulled…hard. Four trap doors let loose, and four men began to hang. I pulled the trigger… four times to be exact. Then I flung it into its sling on my back, and kicked my horse in to a dead run. I held Billy's horse and the other's horses behind me. The crowd parted in a frenzy as I bolted through stearting with one hand and perfect balance. I swung the horses around the gallow stage and the boys leapt on. Shots rang off instantly. I grabbed a pistol and soon the others had their own lead flying after me. I swear I could have felt the wind pass by my ear on some of them. The horses where restless and where jerking this way and that. My heart beat fast pumping my blood through my body faster then I could count. Not that I was trying to. I was concentrated where the firing was coming from. Men where shouting, horses were flipping out, the crowds was yelling, and the sound of guns flooded the town. We spun our horses around and bolted out of town just as the last of the crowd had disappeared. I didn't think it would be that easy. But when I looked back. It wasn't. A posse was behind our tails. Instead of being disappointed, or frightened, my eyes flared and I smiled under my handkerchief. \"The canyon up ahead!\" Doc yelled over the rushing wind and pounding hooves. I looked ahead. There was a canyon and ridges up ahead. We all split, barely dodging bullets that slit the air. I took my horse straight to the ridge. When the posse saw we had split, that had to think fast. When the reached the ridge and canyon, the split. I had two coming my way. The rest was after the others… with four going for Billy. I rolled my eyes. Two for me? INSULT I thought. But, would take care of them just anyways. They where far behind me but I was still in range. Bullets zipped past, and one nicked me on the shoulder. I rocked, almost loosing my balance, but I pulled myself back on. I pulled my horse around bends and twists in the ridge. I hit a dead end before I began to go upward, and found a place to hide. I pulled my rifle out, and settle myself down in some rocks. I watched my horse. Within a few minutes his ears pearked up, and I leveled my rifle. The two men came around the bend. Two shots went off. Their horses bolted down one way. I didn't want them to go that way. I sent of another two shots to scare the horses into the dead end. The men on the other hand, I had shot of their saddles. Nothing deadly. Wasn't quite sure I was ready for that yet. But they hit hard either way. Quickly and quietly, I remounted and found their horses. Salvaged anything of value to me from their saddles and horses and then cut the buckles on the saddles. Bare back for them today. I took off before the men could find out which direction their horses had taken. I had to find the others again. My mind told me mentally that I had two bullets left in my rifle… and four altogether in my pistols. But I couldn't reload now. Not yet. Or could I? Now would be smart. But I couldn't' bring myself to do it yet. I don't know why. I was just focused on finding the boys as soon as possible. I trotted down to the canyon and found the river. Knowing Billy, he would have followed this river to cover up tracks. SO I followed it. I got maybe four seconds into the river when I was knocked from my saddle by something big and hard. A person. Shoot, I thought. Somebody else followed me and was going to pick me off! I had been stupid and fell for it! I hit the ground hard and rolled. Rolled right over a sharp rock that punctured deep into the skin right above the waist on my right side. I yelped, feeling the hot blood ooze out under my shirt. But I kept my roll backwards, and then to my feet. I looked at my opponent. It was Billy. That twit! My anger rose in me. An anger that seemed to burn my eyes. \"Who are you!\" Billy demanded. I realized my face was still covered. But I was to angry to just give him an answer now. \"The person who just saved you life!\" I spat, my fingers itching toward my gun. \"You didn't answer my question!\" Billy snapped. My eyes caught his fingers brushing against his own pistol he had gotten from his horse… that I had put there. I blew. I pulled my pistol out, faster then I could blink. Billy did the same, just as fast as me. . \"I'm gonna count to five.\" \"Yeah well I'm gonna count to three.\" I snapped. \"I don't just trust anyone who burst in like that!\" Billy said, \"Tell me who you are or eat it!\" \"Idiot Billy!\" I snapped, \"I'm just as blown as you are! You're such a creep for pulling a gun on someone who risked their life to save you! AND you're pals! Something I might say that YOU couldn't do!\" \"Who are you, and how do you know my name!\" I grinded my teeth. \"Dang it Billy!\" I said, reaching for my handkerchief, \"It's a wonder how you're still alive!\" I pulled it from my face, and pulled my hat off letting my hair fall out. Billy lowered his gun, as did I. He just kinda stood there, jaw sorta dangling. I scoffed. \"I ah… huah… had to use some dirt to help blend in.\" I said. I heard more galloping… horses. More of them. But I knew who they were. Doc, Shavez, and Steve. \"Well I'll be…\" Doc said seeing me and Billy, \"So this is the freak who blasted in and saved my neck?\" \"Son of a gun.\" Shavez said, \"Never would have thought a Chikia would have my life on her hands.\" \"That's down right unnatural.\" Steve said. \"I got a women to thank for saving my neck?\" \"Your welcome you wort hog.\" I snapped at him. \"Billy, put the gun away.\" Doc said. \"She pulled first!\" Billy argued. \"We pulled at the same time dweeb!\" I snapped back. \"What did you just call me?\" \"Great, don't tell me yer deaf to?\" I said, I threw my arms up. \"I just rescued a twit!\" \"Say that again and you'll swallow lead!\" Billy threatened. \"I dare you!\" I snapped, my eyes alive. Billy stopped and we glared at each other for a few seconds. Finally, Billy's shoulder dropped and he ran a hand through his light blonde hair, smiling. \"You are a loadfull of…\" \"Billy!\" Shavez snapped, \"We gotta get outta here. There might be some of that posse around!\" Billy mounted his horse again, holstering his pistol. \"What about her?\" Steve asked. Billy looked at me. \"I'm be fine on my own thank you.\" I snapped, \"I'll cover you're guys trial up and finish anybody trailing you.\" I mounted up. In doing so, I pulled at the two wounds, both sending pain through my entire upper body and the blood now flowed freely. I gasped and fell over my saddle. \"Uh-uhh.\" Doc said, \"You're coming with us. You go anywhere you're going to leave a trail of blood if you don't get that patched up.\" \"Like I won't if I follow you. I'll be showing them right to you.\" I said through clenched teeth. \"I'll be fine. I can make it to Albuquerque, I can fix up there.\" I turned my horse, not really knowing if I really wanted to go that way, or go with these guys. One arm around my waist, where I was shot, I started off. I hoped they wouldn't stop me. And they didn't. I just rode away slowly, my back towards them as the pain grew. I didn't think I would make it to Alburquerque. But I couldn't go back to Lincoln. What would I say? I got caught in the cross fire? Ha. That was old. But I couldn't' go with Billy. Why? Well… me coming along gave a greater chance of them being tracked. So I couldn't. Besides, I wasn't in there gang. I was their prisoner, then things changed a bit when they got arrested. I just helped them out a bit. Doesn't mean I'm bound with them for life. They could have died otherwise. Died? But Billy didn't die by getting hung! Pat Garret shot him! Or would. So how come it come so close. If I wasn't here, which I wasn't suppose to be, he would have hung. History would have been changed. Had I somehow moved the coarse of history to another track? Shoot. What happened if I died? I looked at my wounds. Would I die? I didn't know. But really what would happen? Would I wake up back in my home? Home. It was beginning to feel like a story, just like the old west had when I WAS at home. I gridned my teeth. I had money. I could go find a place to rest. No doubt Keith and the others would be looking for me after my sudden disappearance. Could I go back to them? After what I had been through, with Billy and all? I couldn't see it happening? So what would I do? I got angry with myself aigan, but the pain kept me from doing anything irrational. Keeping well away from Lincoln, I moved my way down the creek. I was leaning heavily over my saddle, my face towards the water when I saw it. It looked like cumbs from sombodys food. Bread crumbs or something. I pulled my horse out of the river and slowly worked my way around the brush, quietly reloading my pistols. I clenched my jaw shut tight when a wave a pain threatened to let loose in a loud wail, but I kept quiet. I heard noise up ahead. The murmur of voices. I cocked my pistol and moved slowly forward on the opposite side of the river. I stopped my horse and dismounted. I crept further downstream on the bank, when a small camp caught my eye. One horse, one bed and a small campfire. But I didn't see anybody. It was then I heard the click of a gun hammer. I froze. The cold barrel of a gun was set to my neck, and I held my breath.[Chapter 19] I woke up to a loud noise. An alarm. BEEP BEEP BEEP. I groaned and threw my hand across my bed stand and shut my alarm off. I sighed and rubbed my face. Laying there in bed I realized how much sleep my body needed. I buried my face in my pillow, then froze. The pillow smelt of my flower body spray and frut shampoo. Now that I thought about it… alarms didn't exist in the west. My bed was heavy with its comforters. I looked up. I was in my ROOM. MY room. In MY house! I leapt out of bed, throwing the covers off my bed. \"SETH?\" I yelled, racing down the hall to his room. His door flung open and the light behind me flooded in and stung Seth in the face. \"AWW!\" He groaned and pulled the pillow over his head, \"It's Saturday!\" came his annoyed voice under the pillow. I jumped, propelling myself through the air and on top of his bed. \"OH SETH!\" I yelled, yanking the pillow off his head, and giving him a sloppy kiss. \"I'm back! Don't worry I'm back!\" The commotion I was making had attracted the attention of Jeb, the dog. \"JEB!\" I called out running out of the room and my bare feet pounding down the hallway. \"Come ere boy!\" Jeb was sitting calmly at the foot of the stairs. I flung myself off the top step and flew down the entire flight. I landed and flung my arms around the big old German Sheppard. I heard the dog give am umpf from his throat and it's old heart beating hard wondering why I had suddenly flung myself down the stairs and wrapped around him. My alarm would go off at eight in the morning on Saturday's so Mom and Dad would still be working. No matter! I ran into the kitchen and pulled out peppered turkey, sharp cheddar cheese, a grab-n-go yogurt, and threw a burrito in the microwave. I poured some cranberry juice into a glass and made my sandwich. I turned the barrito over and set it in again. Seth came down finding me licking the knife and cleaning up. \"Good morning Seth! You're burrito is in the microwave. Orange Juice or Cranberry?\" I looked up when he didn't answer. He was in his boxers his red night shirt half tucked in and hanging off one shoulder. His hair was a mess on top of his head and his eyes squinted against light from the kitchen. No shoes either. I smiled. He looked like that every morning. \"Love ya! I'm gonna go take a shower, and I'm going shopping after so if ya need anything start a list!\" I grabbed my sandwich and went out the kitchen with another kiss to Seth on the check. \"Lysh?\" Seth said, I stopped at the stairs and turned, the sandwich in my mouth. \"You… feel'in ok?\" \"I feel better then ever! Thanks for asking!\" I said cheerfully. I pranced up the stairs and finished off my sandwich. I took a long hot shower and scrubbed hard trying to get the dirt from my dream off. Or was it a dream? No matter. I was home. After my shower, I got dressed and came back downstairs tying my hair into a tight bun and throwing my purse over my shoulder. Seth was sitting at the table. Just sitting there. Starring at me. \"Hey!\" I said, \"Got a list?\" Seth set his fingers on a strip of paper on the table and pushed it forward, his eyes never moving from me. I picked it up and read down it. It was ridiculous stuff. And most of it selfishly for himself and things that he should have bought for himself. I smiled and stuffed the list in my purse. \"I don't know when I'll be back. But I'll have my cell phone on me if you need me. What are you doing today?\" \"Nothing. Can't go anywhere. Grounded form the car remember?\" Seth said slowly, eyeing me. \"Oh, well I can take you where you need to go.\" I said. I looked at him, ready for him to answer. His eyes turned to slits, mentally questioning me. \"The movies.\" He said, \"With some pals of mine. Can you pick them up to?\" \"Sure!\" \"And money. I need money to go. I'm fresh out.\" He said. I reached in my purse and pulled out some money. \"Some extra for pop and popcorn.\" I said handing it over. \"I leave in five minutes. Need any longer just holler.\" I turned on my heel leaving Seth puzzled and confused. I laughed to myself. I was soon parked outside one of Seth's friends house, waiting for him to come out. Seth by the door with two other friends. \"What's up with your sister man?\" one asked. \"I dunno. She slopped all over me this morning. Thought I'd be grossed out for life. She made me breakfast, and let me have the last of her cereal. She gave me money and driving us anywhere I want cause I'm grounded. I've been testing her all moring to find out what would make her blow! She's taking my entire Christmas list shopping!\" \"she on something?\" the second one asked. \"I don't know. Whatever it is, I should put some more if it in her drink or something.\" Seth chuckled. They all loaded in the car and dropped them off at the movies. I waved goodbye to Seth and took off. The entire day was spent pampering myself, and treating myself to anything and everthing I could think of. I bought the things on Seth's list I knew Mom and Dad wouldn't get mad over. I went to a fancy restaurant and ordered the most complicated thing on the menu. I hooked up some friends and we went to a dollar movie and hung out of one of their houses. We played some old board games and talked about school with popcorn and snacks. My cell rang. It was Seth. He had to be picked up. I said goodbye to my fiends and left. I picked Seth up and we drove home. The parents would be home in about two hours, which I spent the time cleaning up the house. I was in my room folding laundry when I heard the door open. \"Kids?\" Dad called. I smiled and raced downstairs. I hugged them both and gave them a kiss. \"Glad you're home! How was your day? Did you drive safely?\" I said. \"Mom!\" Seth yelled from upstairs, \"Elisha's on something!\" I scoffed. \"What?\" My mom yelled back. \"Elisha's is high on something!\" \"Kids down here now!\" Dad called. Seth came at a slow trudge. \"Seth, we heard you were at the moves today. I thought you were grounded from the car?\" Mom said. 'I was! I never drove! Elisha drove me!\" Seth said. My parents looked at me surprised. \"Well that was nice.\" Dad said. \"Yes. That was.\" mom added. \"Are you going to do something about it?\" Seth asked crossing his arms. \"Do what?\" \"test her for drugs! She gone loopy! This morning she made me breakfast. She gave me money for the movies, She picked up all my friends, and took my Christmas list shopping. She even dropped out of a friends party to pick me up! And when we came home, she cleaned the kitchen and living room and folding MY laundry!\" Seth's voice was croaking, and he threw his hands up on his last statement. \"Honey?\" Dad turned to me. I looked at him. I hesitated. \"Oh, don't worry, you're laundry is on your bed. Mom's too.\" I said. \"See!\" Seth said as if to prove a point, \"She's cracked or something!\" \"You gave her your Christmas list?\" Dad said, then turned to me, \"Did you buy anything off it?\" \"Yes.\" I said, \"but not all of it.\" \"SETH!\" mom said firmly, \"You're CHRSITMAS list for normal shopping?\" Seth frowned. \"No, no, mom.\" I interrupted, \"I asked for him for a list. And he gave one to me. Not his fault at all.\" Seth slumped to the stairs. \"This is getting creepy. Now my younger sister is taking the blame! VOLUNTARILY!\" I rolled my eyes. \"I just felt like I had a lot to make up for is all. I already started dinner mom. And I cleaned up the garage for you dad. Any homework I had was finished and threw away any IOU's you guys owed me, so don't worry about those.\" \"Anything else you want to tell us?\" Mom asked, crossing her arms. \"Um… yeah. I washed the dog, ordered that mechanic for dad to fix the other car. He should be in by Monday. I took care of the bill. I called in for work and asked for a day off for family time. I mowed the lawn for Seth, cause he was still moping about the house. I dusted the furniture, and made sure the mail was brought in. I have tea and coffee in the kitchen, so you guys can relax for the rest of the day. I stopped by the store and bought the groceries and bought today's paper for you dad. It's on the kitchen counter. Anything else you'd like?\" \"Ah…I… I don't think so…\" Dad sputtered. \"Thank you sweets.\" Mom said, \"Are you tired after all that? Want to take a nap?\" \"Naw. Feel like I could go on like this for days.\" \"Well don't.\" Seth said darkly, \"It's creepy.\" \"You should be happy.\" I said. \"I wish I was. And at first I was too. But now that you've done all my chores, cept take out the trash, I got boared. So stop it.\" Seth said. \"Oh… forgot that. I'll do that in a minute. I baked some cookies for the neighbors.\" \"Ok… I'm officially considering anything she says as a lie. I can't take any more of it.\" Seth said crossing her arms. Suddenly… my head spun. I lost my balance and shut my eyes tight. Seth caught before hitting the floor, but went down with me. \"Elisha!\" My mom cried out. My head spun… hurt. My body began to feel pain… I hadn't worked THAT hard…. had I? Of coarse not. So why did I suddenly fall over like that! \"Seth take her to her room.\" Dad said, \"I'll call the doctor.\" I was scared. What the heck happened? Seth grunted and slipped out from under me. He picked me up and took my upstairs… more like carried me. I could hardly stand. I soon found the blankets of my bad pulled up around my shoulders as my vision went black. My mom came in with some Advil and a heating pad. As I blacked out… I heard Seth say \"told you something was wrong with her.\" Then that was it. I blacked out. I lost the feeling in my whole body… and then lost consciousness.[Chapter 20] I woke up to a loud noise. An alarm. BEEP BEEP BEEP. I groaned and threw my hand across my bed stand and shut my alarm off. I sighed and rubbed my face. Laying there in bed I realized how much sleep my body needed.

But when I woke… I wanted to go back to sleep and never wake up again. Pain shot through my entire body sending my nerves to freak out. I yelped and felt the tears coming on. But the fear I had felt in my stomach was gone. I just felt pain. Sharp, almost unbearable antagonizeing pain. I felt still, and my muscles ached from hard ground. A familiar feeling to me all of a sudden. I felt a warmth on my back, but my arms were cold. I felt itchy and dirty. I took a deep breath and opened my eyes. All I saw was the night sky. Dark colors of blue and black with specs of light as the stars. I sat up, and gasped at the pain that shot through me again. I was laying on the ground with thick tall brush surrounding me at the bottom of a small hill that had a creek running through. A fire was next to me keeping me some what warm and I had an old blanket over me. I sighed… knowing exactly what had happened. I starred at the fire again. I wanted to cry… but no tears came. Why had I gone back… and then time traveled again? Why? I was SO CLOSE! I looked down. Bandages covered my waist and shoulder. The pain in them was sharp… but not as much as I remembered it being. I took a deep breath. Then my mind flashed. Like literally thoughts flashed through my mind like memories… but they didn't happen… or they didn't happen yet. I saw Keith… and the other boys and Lou from the hotel. Men I recognized… good friends of mine were moutning horses… and loading guns. One gave a shout and they all took off kicking up dirt. As they left behind them was something that wasn't there when I was there: A gallow. A noose. Three of em. Lit with a ghostly red light of the torches set around it. I snapped back into my own mind. Without speaking… I knew what the nooses where for. I knew who the men were and what they were looking for. Me. They went out looking for me… and would hang the men who took me. My eyes flared with their own fire now. I didn't know how I knew that… but I knew it. And in this time… I learned not to ignore those feelings. I looked around. No one was in sight. I heard the horses close by. I had to get out of her. If that posse found me here… Billy would hang for sure. I tried to stand… but I couldn't even get to my knees before gasping in pain and falling back over. I breathed for a second, the fire crackled and an idea popped into my head. Time traveled. The time warp. Things changed in the time warp. Lots of things. Things I may not have discovered yet. Like how well trained my horse was. It might not work… but it was a try. I took a deep breath. Pursed my lips and whistled. Nothing happened other then a few horse ears flickering. Dang. I bit my lip, and did it again… this time directing it at my horse. It flickered it's ears again, and shook it's head. Then it walked over. A smile crept across my fire lit face. There was some advantages to this time warp. And a trained horse, was one of em. I used the horse to pull me to my feet and onto the saddle. I could feel the skin pulling on wounds, making my blood pump hard. I grabbed the reigns and steered it hard away. I started off, but pain shot up through my body, and I leaned heavily over the saddle, pulling the horse to a stop. I stayed hunched over for a few seconds, breathing hard. Then I straitened a little. I pushed the horse into a walk again. There was a noise to my left. Without thinking, my hand swept up my side gripping the pistol, cocked and aimed all in one move. But it also sent pain down my spine again. I shuttered for a second, my eyes locked in the direction the movement had come from. Nothing. Nothing stirred. I turned the horse closer to the spot where the noise had come from. It was a creek, filled with water, but nothing else. I put my gun away, uncocked it and tuned my horse again. I kicked it up a little faster once we got out in the open. I cursed when I realized they might follow me. Track me down, wondering if I was ok. But they couldn't… if they were around me, I was putting them in danger. The tracks I was leaving wasn't hard to follow. I pulled my horse into the creek… and decided to backtrack. To the opposite direction from which I was heading. I would pass the camp again, but it was a risk I would have to take. I started down, making a soft sloshing noice was I trotted through the shallow water. I came to an unexpected fork in the creek where it split. I took the one going north, relaxing a little at my luck. I was fully loaded, my horse packed. I could last a week maybe out here in the open on my own. That is if my luck held. The cold night air made me glad I had nice coat warm coat and thick leather gloves. But every once in a while a breeze would find it's way down my neck or up my pant leg and I would shiver. The nights were getting colder. Was winter coming? The air was getting thin, and the sky suddenly seemed bigger, wider and deeper. I could see my horse's and my own breath as it fogged in front of us. Finally I realized the cold breeze was coming off the river, and I pulled out. The air was warm again, and I realized I had been mistaken. Winter wasn't coming. The river was just cold. I pulled to a stop, suddenly thinking the horses feet might freeze from trotting in the ice cold water for so long. Slowly, I dismounted and pulled the horse's feet up. they were cold and he was wet from the stomach down from splashing as it walked. Now, I figured horses could handle it, but I felt bad for driving it so hard in such a painful state. I rubbed the legs down drying it off with the blanket as best I could. The horse didn't mind at all. As I mounted back up I spotted the tracks in the dim light behind the horse and I. I wasn't to happy about leaving tracks, even though I had a good change of loosing them in the river. I sighed, as nothing came to my head to cover up my tracks. I slowly mounted up again, the pain coming in expected waves, and started out on a trot again. I must of dosed because when I opened my eyes, the sun had barely just finished rising. The warmth of it felt good on my face and put my lips into a small smile. Even the horse seemed a bit more lively and picked up the pace by itself. I must have traveled a few more miles then I had expected. Where was I going? No clue. To find me a small town to patch myself up and rest. I let my horse choose his own path, hoping it would take me to town. I had put trust into the time warp. Trusting that it would somehow put a connection with me and this horse. Now that I thought about it… we were pretty close. My first adventure against the law, my first real shoot out, and escape were all on this creature, and I hadn't given it a name. What should I call it? I thought of western moive I had watched. I couldn't recall any of them having a name for their horses. But I felt like I owed it to the animal. \"Jaime?\" I said. The horse snorted. \"Naw, to human.\" I thought, \"How about Scalp? No no. To… weird. Dusty? No. How about… Ghost?\" The horse's ears flickered back. Alright. Ghost is was. I had named my gray pet, Ghost. Kind of an awkward name, but I had already began to feel closer. But the horses ears kept flickering back. My smile turned, and I stopped moving so much, trying to listen. Nothing. But horse hearing was better then mine. I took a deep breath, \"Alright, GHOST, let's pick it up shall we?\" I kicked Ghost into a faster trot. My mind wandered back to ways of covering up my tracks. I looked up, careful not to look behind me, or let anybody who would be watching me know that I knew they were there. I didn't see any cliffs or rocky terrain I could use. But I did see something that would work just as good. A herd of deer. I smiled. They would cover my tracks better then any rocky terrain. I kicked Ghost into a full run at the deer. When they saw the threat racing toward them, they took off the way I forced them to. The direction I wanted to go. A few miles of chasing them, and they began to split off. Perfect. I split off going my own way now. Try to track me NOW, I thought. My victory was soon eaten by the pain that had found itself to my neck. I cursed, and focused on my direction. I would be heading to a town now. A town with people who didn't know who I was, would think I was just a pass by like most folks. Wait… how did I know there was a town ahead? Yet another advantaged the time warp had weighed on me. Like before, I had to find a goal… find a place to rest. And then I would ponder if my day at home was a dream or the real thing. And what about the posse coming out for me? Would they find Billy? What would happen when they met? Surely neither of them would give in lightly. There was bound to be lead flying. But think about that later. Now I had to heal, rest, and eat. Oh eat. That sounded good right now. A nice big plate full of stake and potatoes with corn and tall glass of water… ice cold water. My mouth watered. Stop thinking! I shook my head, regretting it after ward. The pain came again, but I ignoried it. I took deep breaths trying to stay focused on that and not my thoughts. A few more minutes passed of a fast trot and I was soon arriving at the town as the sun rose. I pulled up to a hotel and asked for a room. They had one left. Just my kind of luck. It was at the bottom floor at the back. Good. I brought my horse around to the window of my room, and tied it off their. I don't think I would be staying long. Just enough to eat, rest and clean up. I pulled the saddle off and threw it through the window. I gave the Ghost a nice brush down, and brought it a pale of water and a slice of hey. That made him happy. But it made my own stomach growl. I sighed and went back around to the front.[Chapter 22] \"Where's the best place in town to eat?\" I asked the front desk person. \"That'd be Jinky's saloon. It may be a place for whiskey, but the food there is cheap and good.\" He said, I nodded thanking him. Just then two men came in. They were wearing clean, fitted suits complete with bowtie and cuffs. But my eyes flickered to under their perfect coats. A nice, shinny metal that had a tendency to go BANG when the owner wanted it to. They saw me, and eyed my own 44. pistols on my hips. See, they each had one… both left hand draw. Me? I had two, cross draw. Meaning I was better. I could see it in their eyes they didn't like a girl being better then them… or they just didn't believe. One tipped their hat to me, and I ignored him. Just a gut feeling told me to tell these guys I didn't like em. They went up to the front desk and asked for a room. \"I'm sorry, but I just gave the last one out to that young lady right there.\" the office man said. They turned, only to see the last of the heel of my boot disappearing around the corner. \"Now how is it, a lady like her, is carrying a cross draw, when she's probably never even touched a wooden pistol?\" one man said. I didn't hear the reply, because I was heading down the street. I got many odd looks from me, to the guns on my hips, or my pants. Most women here were wearing skirts… in fact all of them save me. I didn't give a hoot. I found the saloon and walked in. Inside was pretty busy, with the music playing and the drinks passing around. I went up to the bar, and ordered something to eat. I could feel the eyes on my back. But soon that eerie feeling left, when I heard the bar doors swing open. By the way the sound dropped, and the clunking of boots came my way… I figured it was the sheriff. I paid for my food, picked up my plate, and walked to an empty table, where the clunk of boots followed me. The sound gradually picked up again. I sat down and began to eat, just as someone took a chair next to me. \"Howdy. Had a feeling you're in some need of company.\" The man said. I didn't look up. \"You're not good at reading people.\" I hissed. \"You're not very friendly are you?\" he said. I scoffed. \"You're getting better.\" I said, taking a bite of my steak. It wasn't like mom's at home… but then again… mom's cooking was always best in the west. \"So where you from?\" \"Around.\" \"That's a lot of territory… anywhere specific?\" \"Nope.\" \"Look, I'm a friend… you can tell me. How long you stay'in?\" \"I don't stay long enough to make friends.\" I said, \"And the sooner I can eat in peace, the sooner I will sleep and be on my way.\" The man nodded. \"May I ask you a question?\" he asked. I stopped and looked at him. \"Didn't give me a choise there, now did ya?\" I said. he thought about, then continued. \"Why is a lady such as yourself, wearing iron?\" \"Same reason why most men wear them.\" I said. \"But they know how to use them.\" He said. I set my fork down, annoyed. My eyes met his with an intent glare. He knew right then I was trouble. But he had never dealt with a female and guns kinda trouble… so he didn't know how to go about it. He stood up to leave, tipped his hat and left with the final words. \"Alright, well, if there's any trouble, just come holler. I'll clear it up.\" I scoffed. \"You'll be to late by the time I finish cleaning up.\" I muttered. I finished my food and set the plate on the counter. Again, I felt a solid set of eyes on my back. I turned around slowly , meeting my disturber. A nasty, grungy looking man, with a heavy pistol dangling on his side. His black eyes on me. I glared at him, and turned away. \"Hey, lady. You know how to use those things?\" he asked, \"That part with the hole in it, is where you don't wanna be. That's the dangerous part.\" I stopped in my tracks. You gotta be kidding me. I couldn't get through ONE saloon without trouble? Typical west. \"Come here, I'll show ya how to work one.\" I grinded my teeth, and turned around slowly. \"I think I got the jift of it.\" I said, Pulling one out, clumsily, \"This part…. You gotta pull back first… right?\" I said, pointing to the trigger. The man laughed, sweeping his eyes across his pals who were also chuckling. \"No, sweatheart, the hammer, the thing in the back. Pull that back first.\" He said, standing up. \"Oh…\" I said and tried to pull it back. I struggled a little, then used both hands to pull it back. \"You know, you really shouldn't be playing with guns, when you don't know how to use them.\" \"No, I think I got it now.\" I said, and let a loose bullet fly through the wall. Everyone froze. \"I'm not so sure you do. Why don't you hand them over to me…\" he said. I tucked the gun back into my hip. \"Naw…\" I said, \"Those guns cost me a big penny. Worth a lot of money too. A LOT.\" \"Is that right?\" he said, stepping closer, \"Well why don't I take them, just for safe keeping?\" \"That's ok. I think I can take the weight.\" I said. \"Now listen hear lady…\" he started. But I crossed my arms across my hips, pulled both guns and cocked both, and fired both in less then a second. Each bullet hit in front of his feet. \"No really, I think I got it now.\" I said, \"Any other tips?\" I asked. The man shook his head. I nodded. \"DIdn't think so.\" I twirled the gun around, and slid them into my hostlers. I went outside, without another word. My anger was crawling up my chest… and the deep breaths I took only kept it from bursting. I went back to my room, the two men I had seen earlier, still there. I didn't even look at them, and went up straight to the stairs. I found my room and opened the door. I turned around to shut it… and locked it tight. \"You already got trouble on yer tail?\" said a high, amused voice. I twirled around faster then I remember, pulling my gun, and cocking it. I aimed it straight at the voice, my eyes flaming, and finger tight on the trigger. I grinded my teeth and my anger almost rose when I saw who it was.[Chapter 23] I followed the characters, with only one thing in mind. Bank robbery. I know, I was probably over reacting. But I just had a feeling like I should watch these fellows. And out here, I learned not to ignore that feeling. My suspicions rose when I caught them eyeing the bank building. They had their hats low, and made little eye contact. One of them looked at me straight in the eye. Usually, ladies were the first one to look away. But I had already made up my mind not to like them, so I glared back. He pulled away, a bit confused. What a loser, I thought. They split up. One in front of the livery, one in front of the land sell. Two stopped at the bank. I watched closely. My fingers itched and my heart lurched when I saw them pull up their bandannas around their faces right before going in. Now the town didn't notice. They all went on with their business, like nothing was happening. Which to them, nothing was. But I knew. Before I knew it, I was marching across the street, my eyes set on the bank door. The man at the livery, came in my way, and stopped me, his hands up. \"Scuse me, miss, the bank is closed.\" He said. My eyes flared, and I looked up slowly with a smile. \"It ain't no holiday today… it ain't closed.\" I said, my voice icy. He hesitated, surprised for a second. I saw his fingers twitch around his gun. But I had a plan already. \"Miss you can't go in there.\" he said. My eyes sparked again, giving a warning to step back. But being the first time to meet a fiery girl like me, he didn't know it was a warning, and didn't know how to take it. He just kind of thought over the words to say next. But I had no time to let him. \"Hey, aren't you the brother of that guy?\" I said, pointing behind him to his left. He turned… proving I was right about him being a loser. Who fell for the oldest trick! He turned left, I took off to his right. Before he could do anything, I had walked into the bank. Inside, was quiet, the men had their hands up, the women frightened, two men with guns out, and all eyes on me. I pulled out a few bucks, and walked up to the counter where the cashier had his hands up. I looked at him. \"Can I please make an account under the name… Elizabeth Jones?\" Nobody moved, or said anything… just wonder what the heck I was doing. \"Hey…\" a man tapped me on the shoulder. I guessed one of them with a gun. I turned, looking annoyed. \"You can wait you're turn… I was here first.\" I snapped, and turned back to the cashier, but the man tapped me again. I heard the bell of the door opening. The man who had tried to stop me. \"Ben what's up with this women! You're not doing you're job!\" the man said. \"I tired! She just shot past me!\" the man named Ben said. \"Excuse me, sir… can I please get an account?\" I said again. \"Hey! Hands up!\" the man shouted pulling his gun up to my head. I stopped. Boy this guy had guts. He was brave. He was smart… he was dead. I starred at the gun… then at the man holding it. \"A pathetic 38. navy colt. Old, worn, and hasn't been washed in weeks judging by the look of the barrel. I said, shutting one eyes and looking straight down the barrel of the pistol. \"You should take better care of em.\" \"Look, I don't know who you are, or how you know that, but I said it again… hands up!\" \"Hands up... got it…\" I said, \"Just one more question…\" My hands just itching to snap out my pistols. I was going to have to be fast. I was angry. Then he blinked… I fired. His gun flew from my hands, and the other two were pinned, with empty hands… pistols clanking on the floor, \"Should I put my hands up with or without my guns?\" \"How the…\" one started… \"Oh… sorry… didn't really give you a chance to answer now did I?\" I said, a sly smile. I looked at a man by the door. He looked decent enough… almost charming. \"Sir… could you be so kind to get the sheriff?\" he was the only person smiling other then me in the room. His eyes were a soft brown, his smile cocky and mysterious. His brown hair under a tan hat. He nodded, and went out, chuckling to himself. A few minutes, and the Sheriff had them in cuffs. They were led off, as the Sheriff walked up to me. \"Look, Sheriff, I don't want to hear it right now. These bums just got me in a bad mood. I don't want to hear anything about it.\" I said. \"Alright… just know you have our thanks.\" He said. I nodded and he left. I went out to the street, and slowly walked down the board walk. \"That was some… interesting shooting you did in there.\" I turned to see the man I had asked to get the sheriff was next to me, matching my pace. \"Not much to some people.\" I said. \"You were fast.\" \"There's always somebody faster.\" \"Where'd you learn to shoot?\" I looked at him. \"Why so interested?\" I asked, a little meaner then I meant. \"I didn't mean to pry. Names Jesse.\" He said. My frowned turned… and my heart lifted. \"I take it yours is Elizebeth James?\" I rolled my eyes in a smile. \"It's Elisha Young..\" I said, looking at the floor, my smile still big, \"See, we outlaws gotta keep different names about… helps hide where we are.\" \"Excuse me?\" Jesse said, a bit stunned. I chuckled. \"So, Jesse, where's your brother Frank? I mean, as close as you guys are, I wouldn't think you'd be to far apart.\" Before I could blink, Jesse had grabbed my arm, and pushed me into an ally, his soft gentleman personality taking a turn. His gun was in my face before my smile could get any bigger. \"Who are you?\" he demanded. I put my hands up, still smiling. When I looked at Jesse, he wasn't exactly frowning. But not smiling. Not worried, but not happy. \"Look, I know who YOU are, JESSE JAMES, and you're brother Frank, and the rest of your gang… Cole, Ben.. the usual. If I was a threat, I would have turned you in already. As you saw, I don't exactly hesitate to do what needs to be done… just cause a gun is pointing the wrong way at me.\" \"How do you know who I am?\" he asked. \"Well, to tell you the truth, it's easier to talk to a friend, when the guns are put a way.\" I said, looking down. Jesse followed my gaze. I had my gun pointing to his belly. He chuckled, and pulled his gun off. I did the same. \"Relax. I like you guys. I believe in the cause of your fight. What I don't get is why you're in New Mexico. Isn't you're fight in Missouri?\" Jesse looked at me, not answering. I sighed. He still didn't trust me, \"You ever heard of Billy the Kid?\" \"Yeah, heard of him… had dinner with him.\" \"I got accounts with them. And they're alive because of me. See… I'm not all mean.\" \"That don't explain how you know about me, and my gang.\" He said. I shrugged. \"Happens a lot.\" I said, looking away, around the corner for eavesdroppers. \"I have a habbit of making sure I know who's around…\" I turned around. Jesse was gone. Disappeared like a shadow, \"And so do you.\" I said, smiling. I walked out of the ally, and almost ran into a girl running full speed. We bumped, she excused herself, and kept running. But that had done it. That bump had reminded me what I came here for. The pain came back hard, fast and sharp. My side still ached. What the crap. So the pain disappeared for me to save a bank and then WhAM it's suddenly back? The time warp sure had funny timing. I had to get patched up. I had the stuff in my room. Quickly and as smoothly as possible, I went to the hotel, and found my room. I patched myself up, drenching it in whiskey to numb it, and laid down in bed. Rest sounded good right now. In fact, as soon as I said it… my eyes lids dropped. I was emerged in the silence of my room, the relaxing feeling of being alone, the warmth of the covers, and the softness of the bed compared to the hard ground. What a day, I thought. I had made the famous smile of Billy the Kid, turn. I had stopped a bank robbery, scaring off three men, and met Jesse James, another famous outlaw in this time. And I had blow it all over like it was nothing… like it would happen everyday. It wasn't exactly every kid got to do that. But right now… nothing mattered. I pushed the thoughts from my head… and drifted off, falling into a world of dreams. One last thought pulsed through my brain, that threatened to surprise me fully away. Would I dream of home again? one way to find out.[Chapter 24] I didn't dream of home. And I didn't dream of my day's in the west. But my dream still had a western taste to it. I was in a barn of some sort. Out the window was cliffs, not by fifty yards away. There was hey everywhere on the ground, in my hair. From what? Something small exploded next to my head in the window. I ducked down. Gee, well this made sence. I was being fired at. Someone outside. They had surrounded the barn, and were firing almost nonstop. To my left was and open doorway… and instinct told me to get away from that. I moved further back, and found an outlet of the barn, made of dirt clay and rocks. Inside was another person, but through the smoke I could hardly make out their face. Smoke? Fire. They had set the barn on fire. Great. Only one way out. I pulled my guns, and aimed out the window next to the figure. Quickly and accurately I emptied both barrels out the window. I was aiming at black hats peaking up over the crevasses. I pulled a rifle leaning agansit the wall, and aimed. The figure said something. I couldn't make out what he said. He said it again, louder. \"Duck the pigs!\" he yelled. I starred at him, puzzled. A shot rang out, louder then usual, and not from either of our guns. We both turned to the doorway, where a man in black stood, his gun smoking. The person next to me was shot. Two seconds later, the man was sent staggering backwards and out the door, before dropping dead, numerous bullet holes visible. I slammed my back against the wall, just below the window, to reload my pistols. The person next to me was bleeding badly… but still fighting. Something about the danger around me… the lead flying, and the fire roaring, made me smile. I shoved the bullets in one by one. As I did, the figure next to my shoved my aside, hard, knocking me over onto my side. I soon saw why. A torch flaming with hot fumes burst through the window, and hit the other side of the wall. Quickly I grabbed it and through it back out, before it could start anything. It was a dirt floor in here yes… but you never know. I turned back toward the figure… but he was gone. I looked at the doorway to the small room… it was open. I woke up. My mind played what I could remember about my dream. It didn't make sence at all. Was it a warning? Or just a dream? Like before, something just told me it was something to be taken serious. I sighed, and pulled the blankets off. The sun had just barely began to peek up over the horizon. I started packing. I through everything into the saddle bag, making a list in my head what to buy for the trip. As I slung the bag over my shoulder, and pulled on my boots, I stopped. What trip? Why was I leaving? I sat there on my bed puzzled. I had just involuntarily packed my things, and started to think about the trip ahead of me. But what trip was that? I set the bag down, and leaned against the wall, thinking. Why did I just do that? Should I really be leaving? But were would I go? I sighed, and went outside, my packed bag still on my bed. I went outside, the streets still empty, and headed for the saloon. Well, really I just followed my feet. When I saw it led me to the saloon. I took a seat and ordered a drink… water. I couldn't stand anything to strong this early. Whatever man could, would be dry in his older days. There was no way it was good for you're health. A man in the corner didn't think so. He was slouched in the corner chair, eyes droopy, and his arms limp on his side. The counter man came up to me, remembered me as the girl who shot up before, and asked me if there was anything else. I shook my head. I was going to figure out why I wanted to move. Why I had. There had to be a reason. Everything out here had a reason… for ME at least. Not much was by accident thanks to the time warp. I sat and thought. What was it? Where was I going? I tried to think back, trying to remember if I had a goal in mind. I didn't. I just got ready. Maybe if I let my horse lead… make it's own path. Maybe I could get somewhere. I set down my drink, gave the man a tip, and left. It wasn't much of a plan, but I had a feeling I wouldn't come up with anything better if I kept at it. I went to my room, gathering my already gathered things, and packed my horse. I saw the rifle in the saddle, and then remembered the guns on my sides. I starred at them for a second, then pulled the pistol's out, and stuffed them in the saddle bag. Mounting with a bit of hesitation, I pulled the horse back, then it stopped. Which way would I go? I didn't know. I kicked the horse forward, and it turned left. Looks like I was going this way. I let my horse choose the path. Completely roaming. Literally walking aimlessly out into the dry earth. I felt like I was wasting time, so I kicked the horse into a faster trot. I wondered if I was being followed, and at the thought, my stomach rose, and a smile threatened to turn my face bright. But I I knew I wasn't being followed. Just instinct. Then I stopped in mid thought. Why was I thinking I was being followed. It was a reaction every time I left a town. An involuntary action I didn't instantly after leaving a place where people have seen a face. Because you were made for an outlaw, said one side of me. Ridiculous, I'm a cook in De Luna's Hotel, argued the other side. Yeah, that's why you escaped from jail, stole a horse, stormed into town face covered and rescued men from the gallows, ran from posse's, shot at men, can handle a gun better them most towns men, even better with fists, rough attitude, and sharp eyes for trouble. You can track, battle bulls and cattle, play poker a little better then just good. Uh huh that doesn't sound like an outlaw at all. Arg! Well it's not like I enjoyed doing those things! I could have lost my life! Yeah, but you were smiling. You were laughing, you felt like you could fly. Your mind was in a state of 'playing games.' And you wanted to win. You felt like a little kid playing with your favorite toy. All yours, nobody could stop you. You felt like the boundaries and fences were over. Nothing could stop you. Eyes wild, big smile. Does that sound like the brink of death? I thought about it. Sounding like a new and better life if you look at it that way. But what about Keith? Lou? Sam and Mr. Kiggs? All the towns people? I mean, I couldn't just leave them, they were looking for me. And would continue until I disappeared. Disappeared. My mind went back to the last conversation I had with Billy. you want to disappear… outlaws are the ones to ask for help. They have to do it to ensure they appear again. If we don't completely disappear, posse's finish us off. You want to disappear… just ask. That's what he had said. I had to disappear, and the best way was to ask the pro's. I had to find them first. How? Easy. Just follow the gun shot's, the famous laugh of Billy's echo. I smiled. Easier said then done.[Chapter 25] Two days later, still no success in finding Billy or the others. Every hour that went by, I was beginning to regret even making the decision. Did I really want to be an outlaw? I had gone through three towns, and found no trace. I was leaving my forth town, still unsuccessful. I had gotten into one fight at a saloon, about four miles west of here. A fist fight yes, but instincts took over and I won. I scuttled out of there before the sheriff could check things out. This town was a small but loud town. When I first came rode it, I had a gut feeling that I struggled to control. It told me to turn around and run for the mountains. Not because it was a dangerous town, or I was scared. Far from it. But because I felt like I had just missed the boys I was looking for. Just barely. It was weird. But I searched the town anyway, feeling like it was to late to start after them anyway. A few men on horse back rode in, stopping to let the ladies cross the street. Some children played in the street with a ball or stick, while the older boys grouped together arm wrestling, wrestling, racing and having competitions. It made me think of Keith and the others. Quickly I pushed the thought away, feeling a little sick. I was just about out of town when a kid about Keith age, came in front of me. \"Howdy.\" He said, tipping his hat. I looked around my horse's head at him. No one had really talked to me I this town. Like I was a pass by soon to leave and not worth the time. But this boy had actually stopped my horse, and had a strong gaze back at him. He had ruffled black hair and bright blue eyes. A few freckles spotted across his nose. A regular shirt, vest and torn pants with a belt, hung loosely on his body. By the look of his build and hands, he was a farm boy. Strong and sturdy. But some farm boys have been known to cause trouble. I didn't know which one to set him as. \"Hi.\" I said back, in a kind voice. Underneath the disguise I was annoyed and angry, \"Can I help you with something?\" \"Um, yes you can.\" He said, holding my horse reigns, and petting him with such a sence that it made me think he was going to steal it. My mind flashed the my holsters. Empty. I had put my pistols away. What about my rifle? Slow down, I told myself. You're thinking to fast here. He might be a nice kid. \"A telegram just came in for you.\" A telegram? And how exactly would that be possible. It was then I decided this kid was not to be played around with. \"A telegram huh?\" I said. The boy nodded, looking up at him. His blue eyes starred straight into mine. They reminded me of Billy's, and for a second, I was distracted. \"Scram kid.\" I said, and kicked my horse forward. But he pulled the reigns down, which made my arm jerk towards my rifle. I stopped myself. I didn't want to start another fight here. Especially after I was just about to leave. \"Aren't you Elisha?\" he said. I stopped. How did he know my name? Maybe he was right about the telegram. But whoever sent it would know nobody knows me out here, so they would give a description… along with a name. Crap. \"How do you know my name?\" I asked. \"The… telegram.\" He said slowly, \"You know…\" \"Yes I got it, thank you. Now scram.\" I snapped. But the boy did not let go. He kept his gaze firm on mine. What could he possibly want? My hand snaked around the saddle bag, and curled around one of my pistols. I pulled it out, keeping my movements hidden. I leaned forward in the saddle, and motioned for the boy to come closer, as if telling him a secret. \"Look, I can't stay.\" I said, luring him closer. Two steps closer, and he was almost a foot from my face. I jerked my hand around, holding the pistol in his face. Nobody saw, because it looked like I was just leaning over in the saddle talking to him. The pistol was hidden, except for the mine and the boys eyes. \"I've got business elsewhere. You want to stop me, you're gonna need more then a smart mouth.\" The boy starred at the gun, and gave a queasy smile. \"They said you would pull a gun on me. Said you'd be a lot of trouble to.\" he said. I starred at him. What was he talking about? \"Who's 'they'?\" I asked quietly. He kept still, his eyes on the barrel. \"Jesse, and the others.\" He said. I starred at him hard. He was talking about Jesse James. The James Younger gang. \"Who are you?\" I asked, \"And don't make me ask twice.\" \"Whoa, whoa… hold on there. I didn't mean no harm.\" He said. \"I said don't make me ask twice.\" I said, cocking the pistol. \"I a Younger brother! I swear.\" He said keeping quiet, \"Jesse's and Frank are my older cousins. Cole and Bob are my older brothers!\" I caught his gaze. \"Names Jim, right? Jim Younger?\" I said. The boy stopped, and looked up at me. \"How did you know… my name?\" he asked. I chuckled and unlocked my pistol, putting it away. \"None of your concern.\" I said, with a smile \"Why are you here? Why did you stop me? Is there really a telegram?\" \"Well, no. Sorta. See, I have a message for you. I was suppose to hang back and give it to you.\" Well, he just proved my gut feeling of just mssing them was right. \"What's the message?\" \"Oh um…\" he cleared his throat, and his eyes went off to the side, trying to remember, \"Jesse would like you to accompany him to dinner tonight, if you want to… show… no that's not it… um… if you want to disappear, please come.\" I stopped. How did Jesse know about the disappear thing? Billy. He had talked with Billy. No way. I scoffed, shaking my head. \"Where is this dinner?\" I asked. \"Well I'll show you.\" He said, and took off. I kinda stood there dumbfounded for a second, wondering if I should follow. But he came back, this time on top of a horse. He led me out of town and towards the mountains. I wasn't sure I should follow him, but I had not gut feeling against it. So I kept my path straight, and followed. Just beyond the mountains ridge, as we followed a old dirt path, a house came to view. Smoke came from the chimney, and over five horses were tied to the fences. Jim went over and tied his, and tied mine for me. I dismounted, and pulled my gloves off looking around. \"I'll.. go announce you're here.\" Jim said, his voice cracking with excitement. He went on ahead into the house, and I followed behind. I was about to just charge in, but I stopped myself and knocked. The door opened instantly, revealing Jim. Beyond him, was a sight I'll never forget in my entire life for as long as I live. Beyond Jim was a dinner table, covered in foods I never imagined. The smell made my stomach grumble and mouth water, but that's not what was so intriguing. Around that table were men, all standing up for the presence of a lady… me…. Those men were Jesse James, Cole Younger, Doc Scurlock, Shavez, and William H. Bonney. Never in my life would I have imagined this happening to me. Never. I stepped in, a little unsure. All eyes on me. Billy's blue ones were unchanging, and for the first time, I could get nothing from the gaze. What would he say. Was he going to say anything? There was an empty seat at the head of the table, and one for Jim, further down. The table was nicely set with shinny plates and silverware. Jim pulled my chair out for me, and gave me a slight bow as I took my seat. Jim raced to his seat and took it. They all bowed their heads, and said grace. I did the same, with a silent prayer to keep this dinner without lead. We began to eat without a word. I was sure everybody wanted to say something, and kept thinking about saying it. I was. But I kept my mouth shut, and full of food. \"I talked with Billy eairler.\" Jesse broke the uneasy silence, \"Told me all about you and that hand of steel you got.\" I said nothing, \"told me it stared out as a kidnap. Ended up you saving their necks. He also told me, you knew their names, past lives, experiences and even some of their hobbies.\" \"Luck.\" I said, \"Nothing more.\" \"Yeah, she knew my name to. She put her gun away right after she found out who I was.\" Jim said at the end of the table, \"How does she do that?\" everyone was quiet. \"So you going home?\" Shavez asked. I stopped eating. \"I don't have one.\" I said. Everyone looked at me except Billy. \"Thought you lived in Lincoln?\" Doc said. I frowned. \"It's complicated.\" I answered. \"Billy met you in a jail house right?\" Steve said. I nodded, \"And you got out all on your own, without raising so much of a spec of dust of alarm.' I nodded again. My eyes flickered over to Billy. He was starring at his food, unlike everyone else who's eyes were on me. \"Where is this going? You know all these answers.\" I said, setting my fork down. \"How come you ain't wearing iron?\" Billy finally asked. Everyone was quiet. I licked my lips. I couldn't bring myself to look at him. \"I don't see where this is going.\" I said quietly. Billy blew. He jerked up, sending his plate across the table, and his chair crashing to the ground. \"WHY ARE YOU HERE?\" Billy yelled, looking straight at me. I forgot he had a heck of short leash on that temper of his. Everyone else was frozen, almost afraid to challenge his anger. I pushed my plate away, stood up calmly, and got in his face. \"What kind of question is that? YOU sent for me. YOU gave Jim the message for me to come here. So YOU tell me, why am I here?\" I said. Billy glared, though I could tell he was a little taken aback I had stood up to him. But not surprised. He had no answer for me though. I waited. To my surprise, he picked up his chair, and sat back down, like he was giving up. He knew exactly how to break me down. I flopped back in my chair, rubbing my temples. \"I don't need this right now.\" I said, \"I know all about you guys. The outlaw life, and how it came to be and all that. Jesse, Frank, I'm sorry about you're mother. Jim, Cole, Ben, I'm sorry about you're family. Shavez, Doc, Charley… Billy… I'm sorry about John. To you it may have seemed like the world was lost. But what I lost…\" I took a breath. It was now or never, \"Really was a world. I can't tell you the meaning behind that, because you'd think I'm crazy. You'd think I've lost it and need to be behind bars for safety. But I have to figure out how to get back home. The only thing this mess left me in the beginning, was the clothes on my back. That's before I stole a horse and got a job.\" I felt tears choke back in my throat, \"I don't know what I'm suppose to do.\" \"Then come with us.\" Billy said. \"Dang it Billy I CAN'T!\" I yelled, \"You don't get it do you!\" \"I don't get why you're throwing away something that makes you smile! I don't get why you were living in that heap of a town with so called friends and family, and pretending like it would work! Then you find something you like, and dang good at it to, and you won't take it! You've obviously had a tough past. No one can imagine the pain and desperation you feel for that! You're trying to fix it… I got that much. But you just made up a fake life that don't suit you a bit. Then when the right one comes… you walk over it like dirt! You're right! I DON'T get it!\" \"Billy…\" Doc said, warningly. \"What you think becoming an outlaw will get me home Billy?\" I yelled back. Doc looked at me, wondering if he should warm me to. But my eyes were a lit with a flame that scared him. \"How? Huh Billy, HOW!\" \"Connections!\" Billy answered, \"We look. You're an outlaw, you don't need to pay to get home. You jump a train, you steal a horse, food. Less time, even less money. How can we NOT find it!\" I let out a loud frusterated growl, clenching my fists. \"BECAUSE IT\"S NOT HERE!\" I screamed, \"It's not in the mountains, not the plains, tundra, west, east, south, north, or even over seas!\" \"So you don't have one?\" Cole said. \"Then why you look'in!\" Billy said. We both ignored Cole, to caught up in our argument, \"Why are you look'in for something that ain't there?\" \"It IS, I just… it's not… AHHHH! I can't explain it! Alright? You won't believe me. \"Try me!\" Billy snapped. \"NO!\" \"WHY!\" \"Because!\" I yelled, I didn't know how to explain it without making me sound crazy. I could just tell them, they didn't get it so all I had to do was just say it. But there was no way. \"Just because?\" he said dryly. I nodded, \"Stop being so stubborn women! Why can't you just tell me!\" I couldn't answer. The tears were burning in my eyes, but I refused to let them out. Billy saw I was trying not to cry. \"You are such an emotional, stubborn, self centered girl. I never should have even bought the cookies, and kidnapped you. You are just a load of trouble, like every other girl. Slash some words, push around, get what you want and cry. Cry, cry, cry. Typical girl.\" He said. I don't know what happened, but something snapped inside me. Before I could stop myself, I swung. Fists clenched tight, and a rage that led my kuckles to his face, I punched Billy the Kid across the face. He fell back and onto the ground. \"How's that for a typical girl.\" I snapped and stormed out. I walked right up to my horse, mounted, and spun it around. But I froze. There was shadows coming from the hill up in front of me. A lot of them. Ten…twenty people on horses. I looked up. It was the sheriff from the town, with a posse. But they weren't looking at me, they were looking at the door. I looked back. I had left it wide open, and a man was peeking in. He saw the fugitive, slammed the door and ran back to his horse next to the sheriff[Chapter 26] \"It's them. It's those renegades. All of em, even the Kid's gang.\" The man said. I was to frozen in place, to cold and to blind from tears to put this all into sence. The sheriff looked at me. \"Come on over missy, you don't want get caught in the line of fire.\" He said, \"We gotta wipe of a few outlaws.\" My blood ran cold. They had followed us here. Thought I was on their side, and intended to… no. My hands snaked around to my bag, and wrapped around my pistols. It was smooth and no one saw me do it. \"Come on,\" the Sheriff earged again, gently, like I was a scared, delicate girl. Well I wasn't. I wasn't. And he picked a bad day to play with my nerves and anger, which were already aver the top. I was about to pull, when I realized something. I was aiming to kill these folks. Why? They hand't done anything to me! This wasn't my fight. I didn't want to become an outlaw. My hands released, and I pulled my horse behind the posse. The sheriff gave the order to surround the house. As they did, I slowly and silently took off. I followed the dirt trail out of the mountains slowly, crying. I couldn't do this much longer. I needed to get home… and stay there. But HOW. AGGG. I felt overwhelmed. Thanks Billy… thanks a LOT. He just thinks he can do it all… gun shots. Lots of them. Their firing echoed through the mountains to my ears. It sounded like a machine gun there was so many, so fast. And all of it, going for Billy and the others in that small house. They were going to get killed. They had gathered into the house like trapped rats. Why did they do that! Why did they all gather in one hole where they could so easily be killed! I stopped… because of me. They gathered there because of me. And I left them. I turned my horse towards the mountains, and stopped again. If I did this… I would be an outlaw. Something flickered deep inside me. I would be hunted chased… bullets flying… posse's after me. The flicker grew. The shots continued, my heart racing even faster then them. I looked up at the mountains. I had to make a choice… here… and now. Outlaw, or got back to De Luna's hotel, and continue to make cookies. If… no… WHEN I got home, would I be happier if I had made my stay making sweets? I kicked my horse into a gallop. I had made up my mind. I pulled out my rifle from underneath it's cover. Reaching in my pocket, I pulled out my leather gloves and over my fingers. I couldn't turn back now. I could get killed, hurt, imprisoned hung, shot, shot AT. And for what? All for some mangy outlaws who didn't know when to drop the matter. Outlaws. Billy was right. I was throwing away something that i liked. Something that made my blood rush with excitement, something that made my heart sore and stomach lurch, for cookies and a hotel. A smile crept over my face as the wind rushed past, flinging my hat off my head. As I approached the gunshots, I cocked my rifle. At the last minute, I turned my horse into a sharp turn off the road. Into the sharp jagged rocks, cliffs, and greaves. I guided my horse to the highest point I could get to. I pulled to a stop and jumped off. I was now over everyone. I looked down into the mess of bullets. The house was being ripped apart, and there were a few shot coming from inside. But mostly the posse. I got on my belly and aimed. This was it. I decided here and now, with the pull of my finger. I decided who and what I was, what I was going to be doing, how I was going to die, all right now, in this second. Weather I would left my friends die… or go make cookies. I pulled the trigger.[Chapter 27] The men didn't know what hit em. I was spraying lead faster then I ever remember in practice at the shooting range. I wasn't shooting to kill, just knocked their guns off. They they always seemed to have another. But the ones I couldn't see… the ones who only staging bullets flew. I had to do something. I thought furiously as I kept firing. The men below didn't know I was behind them. The thought it was the men in the house that had such lucky shots. But this shooting wasn't working. I had to think like an outlaw… I was one… I had to act and think like it. So I thought. And thought hard. But the only answer that came was to pick the men off one by one. Kill them. I wasn't sure I wanted to do that. So what could I possibly do? An idea suddenly came to mind. I was an outlaw right? So wasn't dynamite always part of their escapes? A cruel smile creapt over my mouth. I ran back to my horse, and dug deep into my saddle bag. I stuffed my pocket full of sticks of dynamite, and ran back to my high spot look out. Without stopping I threw one. Yeah it wasn't lit… but that wasn't a mistake. It landed right behind a group of men on my far left who were hiding behind a bunch of boulders. Now… this dynamite wasn't enough to kill… just enough to knock em out. Plus it was to far for them to be caught in the explosion. I aimed my gun… and fired. The wick on the stick flared and sparkled suddenly. I threw another one. Which landed on my far right. I set that one alight to. Then I lit one… and waited for the spark to be about an inch from the stick before I threw it hard into the air. The explosions went off one after the other. First on my left, splattering and spraying rock everywhere, blinding the men. The one on my right did the same. Then the one in the air went off, getting everyone's attention. The men right below me were confused and wondering what had happened. The gun shots stopped, and I ran to the top, visible to everyone. \"They're taking off!\" I said, \"They have more horses around the bend and are heading to the river!\" I screamed. All at once the men took off. I lowered my hand from around my mouth in disbelief. They believed me? No way. I scoffed. These guys are… dumb. Dumb was the only word that came to mind. They all left, the last of the dust settling from the horses. I climbed down and up to the house. I knocked on the door. Nothing. I knocked again. The door was almost coming off it's hinges. Then shots rang out and the door started to explode in specific area's. I ducked, \"Dang it boys quite shooting you dang twits!\" I screamed, as the lead flew by. The shots stopped, and the door opened. Billy stood there, pistol cocked, starring at me. \"What the…\" he started. He looked behind me at the rocks above. I crossed my arms waiting. \"Where'd they go?\" \"They left.\" I said. Billy blinked, like he didn't believe me. His eyes wondered behind me and saw the explosion. Then he saw two pistols on him hips, the rifle in my hand, and the dynamite in my pocket. His eyes suddenly sparked, coming alive again, and a smile spread on his face. He gave a sharp abrupt whistle. \"Hey boys! Come looky what we got ourselves into!\" he yelled into the house. Doc came around the corner, ducking low, rifle aimed. He stopped when he saw me and Billy at the wide open door. \"What's going…\" he started. Then Jesse came in, with the same act. He rubbed his chin, rolling his head, chuckling to himself in disbelief. Cole came next, then SHavez and the rest. All of them trying to act all stealth and holding a cocked gun in their hands. \"What are you still doing here? What's going on?\" Cole was confused. \"I WOULD tell ya, but we got a little less then four minutes to skin out or we'll be trading our dinner in for lead down our throats.\" I said. They all starred at me. I gave an annoyed sigh and rolled my eyes, \"MOVE!\" I said. They all bolted for the door without a further word. By the time I was mounted Cole and Jim were already making tracks out of the canyon. I kicked my horse into a hard run and sped out of there knowing the rest where behind me. It wasn't long before the posse hit our tails. Led flew, and sooner or later someone would get a lucky shot and hit someone. Lucky shot. I huffed and pulled my rifle out again. I swung one leg over the saddle, while the other leg went the other way. Now I was riding backwards. I cocked my gun, and waited for the beat of the horse to fall into motion with my aim. There. I pulled the trigger, and one of the horses in the posse flipped out. I didn't hit it, don't worry. I don't blame the horse though. I mean one second it was carrying a heavy saddle with a heavy man whaling on it to go faster, and the nest, the saddle snaps and all that weight is suddenly lifted in a quick loud BANG and a snap. The saddle strap snapped and the man fell off. The horse burst into a hydraulic of kicking and bucking, causing two more horses to loose their focus. That was all for my rifle, I was out. I flung myself back around, facing forward now. I saw the rest of the gang in front of me, their shirts and vest fluttering wildly behind them. I urged my horse to go faster. I felt a bullet wiz by my head, and my heart jumped and I ducked. That was close. I could have been killed if that shot was just a little bit over to the right. Maybe I shouldn't have pulled the trigger. That thought lasted about a second, before I was back into the rage of the race. We were gaining ground between us, slowly but surly. Soon we were out of range and the bullets stopped. When I looked up, I saw that I was further behind then the rest. Much further. And the rest had all stopped for some reason, their horses in a frantic mess. Why'd they stop? Were they waiting for me? I found the answer as I flew past them… and straight over a cliff. I fell off the saddle as I fell, my horse letting out a frantic scream. Water below me caught me in a strong but slow current. It was cold, chilly, but I surfaced quickly and swam to shore a little further down stream. I looked up. The rest of the gang were starring… wide eyed. Then suddenly I saw Billy flying off the cliff screaming THIS IS FOR SURVIVING CHRISTMAS! As he flew. Jesse was next and the rest followed quickly after. I found my horse just coming up onto the small rocky beach. I took shelter the small wood on the side of the river the posse was not on. The rest soon followed, Jim being last. We waited in the cover of the overgrowth as the heads of the posse popped up above the ridge line on the cliff. They all stopped and looked over. A few shook their heads while others instantly turned their horses around. The last few who even thought about jumping, turned around and left. \"You crazy wack!\" Cole yelled when we were trotting across the land, squeezing the water out of our clothes, \"You can't just JUMP of cliffs like that!\" \"Ya there could have been nothing but rock down there.\" Jesse said, smiling. \"How'd you know it was water?\" Jim asked. I licked my lips and smiled. \"I didn't.\" I said.[Chapter 28] I had done it. i had accepted life next an outlaw. A convict. i was one of them now. A part of their gang. I looked back at the dust we had kicked up as we passed over the valley, and found it was settling quite calmly... no wind. And no clouds. I suddenly realized how quiet it was... no wind or crickets. Hardly a sound from the creak of the saddles of the horses hooves. I pulled to a stop, something settling in my stomach. Home flooded my mind. I was an outlaw now... could i ever go home? The confidence and certainty i had only hours ago suddenly left me. I was brave back there when i threw the dynamite, excited as we all took off, and confident in our getaway. But it all abandoned me now. Now i realized I was riding next to a bunch of killers... outlaws, by myself with now way back to Lou or the job i had set up. No way to find the life i had set up here until I could find a way home. ANd for the first time since I arrived, I wondered in if I was doing the right thing. The time warp had given me the spunk and bravery when i needed it. It gave me that spark in my eye Billy talked about... it gave me the brain to get through the impossible situations in such an unfamiliar time... it probably even gave me better aim. But why? and why abandon me now that I had accepted what it had been pushing me towards? Had I lost my game in sharp shooting and riding as well? \"Lish...\" i looked up and found Billy had pulled his horse over to me, \"You alright?\" I looked up, meeting his sharp blue eyes... they were softer. Friendlier. When he met mine, he saw the look in my eye. \"Everything alright?\" Jesse called from up front. Billy waved them off. \"We'll catch up.\" Billy siad. They hesitated, but Jesse took the signal. \"Alright...\" Jesse started off, cuing the others to follow. Doc hesitated, looking from me to BIlly. He seemed to ponder on leaving us alone, but then followed Jim. Billy turned back to me. \"Thanks for clearing us out of that canyon.\" Billy siad, \"You really have a knack for this.\" \"Do I?\" I siad quietly... \"Do i really?\" \"A natural.\" Billy tried to lighten the mood... but i didn't smile. \"I can't go back...\" I siad, not really sure if I meant to Lou;s... or my true home. \"Back where?\" Billy asked. I closed my eyes, and choked by the tears. What was this? Wasn't I burning to get in front of a posse a few hours ago? Now I was crying? Maybe I had just been in the moment... and made the wrong move. It felt like the boost the time warp had given me was leaving me... and the only reason I could think of was because I was doing something wrong... straying from the path i needed to be on... to get back home. \"We'll find your home.\" Billy siad, \"We'll get you back. We'll think of someting so the law won't follow you...\" I shook my head, and gave him a smile. \"You can't get me home Billy.\" I said, \"Nobody can.\" \"You haven't even given me a chance.\" Billy said. \"Billy, you don't understand…\" I sighed, feeling the familiarity of the conversation. He had gotten angry that I didn't explain. \"You'd be surprised.\" Billy said, \"Lish… look at me.\" For a teenage kid he sure had a lot of authority in his voice. I looked up, \"Going home… is that what you really want?\" \"Of course.\" I said, \"I miss my family.\" I closed my eyes, trying again not to cry. And then I felt something warm on my lips… and opened my eyes. Billy had pushed himself over to my saddle one hand holding his reigns the other balancing himself on my saddle… and kissed me. He pulled back, and I starred wide eyed at him, every thought I could possibly think suddenly gone leaving my mind blank, and speechless. \"I've never met anyone like you Elisha Young. You can shoot, and ride better then any man I've seen, and you've got as much fire in you as the woman who raised me. I've had a lot of woman in my life but none of them like you… none of them pawned an entire posse and none of them sure as hell wouldn't jump off no cliff. I like you Lisha, and if you want to go home, then I'll sure as hell make it happen. You have my word.\" His eyes shone and I knew without a doubt he meant it. He would try hard to get me back home… but it hurt to know that he couldn't… hurt to know he would only fail and disappoint himself. But for the life of me I couldn't tell him to take his word back. Because there was a part of me that wanted it to be true. \"We'd better meet up with the others before they send a search party.\" He said, and booted his horse forward. I watched him leave, my eyes still wide. Did he just… naw… I must of imagined it… then why were my lips tingling? Did Billy the Kid… William H. Bonney, the infamous outlaw at the youngest age just... I shook my head. Suddenly I realized Billy was laughing. \"You'll stare straight down the barrel of a gun with a gleam in your eye but you freeze up now? Lish…\" I looked up at him… wondering if I should ask him if I imagined it. I could have. He was acting like nothing happened… sort of. We met up with the gang in a nearby canyon. Somewhere where the light of our fire wouldn't be spotted. The James Younger gang said their goodbyes and split, heading back to Missori to fight their fight. When it got dark enough to hide the smoke against the night sky, we started our fire, and SHavez disappeared, showing up again an hour later with a rabbit. He cooked it and we ate, everyone exchanging a word or two now and then. I stayed quiet. Something didn't sit right with me. Something was making my stomach queasy, and I felt uncomfortable. I starred at the fire, and couldn't help but think something was going to happen. Something terrible, or terrific, or both. I didn't know. But I couldn't sit still and kept shifting. My chest felt tight and I could only swallow one or two bites of food before I set my tin plate down. \"Not hungry?\" Doc asked. \"I'm full.\" I lied. \"I'll take you're plate…\" Steve said. I handed it over and Steve scafed it down, ignoring the dirty looks from the others. \"You alright chicka?\" Shavez asked. I nodded. \"I think I'm just tired.\" I said, \"I'm gonna turn in early.\" I pull my makeshift bed away from the fire, suddenly feeling very hot and tried to sleep. But it never came. I wasn't expecting it to. Something just wasn't right. \"She wants to go home.\" I heard Doc say, \"I can see it in her eyes. It a severe case of homesickness. She can't stay with us Billy.\" \"I know.\" I heard Billy answer, \"I know.\" \"We can take her home.\" Steve said, spitting into the fire, \"If she'd tell us where home was.\" \"We can't just go escorting people Steve….\" Doc said, \"The Sante Fe Ring is pissed and Murphy's men are still on our tail… we would have been dead in that canyon if she didn't show up.\" \"So what do you want to do?\" Billy asked, \"We can ride round the Barrow's River, down east…\" \"That would take us back to Lincoln.\" \"That's where she said she lived when I first met her.\" \"Then why didn't she stay there… we found her in Albuquerque.\" Steve said. \"She's not telling us something Billy.\" Shavez said. \"I know that.\" Billy answered. \"Then why ain't you pushing it? She could be causing us all this trouble and we wouldn't even know it. Murphy's men may still think they got laws but you saw what they did to Alex's wife. If a lady disrespects the law, they ain't much different than a man in their eyes.\" Doc said, \"I say we give her a horse and send her back to Albuquerque… she had friends there.\" \"But she wasn't home.\" Billy said, \"No… no I think we should take her home.\" \"We don't even know where that is!\" Doc hissed, \"If we even stop to piss Murphy's men will have us strong up before we can even pull our pants up. They ain't messing around. Neither should we.\" \"He's right…\" SHavez said, \"We're on a death trail. We shouldn't drag her into this.\" \"Isn't she already in? Blowing lead at the posse and all?\" Steve asked. There was a silence. \"Look. You guys head down to the boarder. Meet up with Johnson. I meet you there. Stick around the flats until I show up and we'll cross the border.\" \"What are you gonna do Billy?\" Doc asked. \"Take her home.\" \"How?\" Doc said. \"I'll figure something out.\" He said, \"Trust me.\"[Chapter 29] Next morning when I woke up, the sun had already risen and I saw there were three bodies and horses missing. Billy was kicked the fire. \"They left?\" I said. \"Headed to Mexico.\" He said. \"You didn't go with?\" I said. \"Is your home in Mexico?\" he asked. I paused but shook my head, \"Didn't think so.\" \"Billy, won't you be safer in Mexico?\" \"Ahahaha… not with Murphy's men. They'll find us eventually. As long as I kill most of them first.\" He said. \"But your gang… they won't want to leave Mexico with you to finish your war.\" Billy looked at me and smiled. \"I can be mighty convincing when I want to. Sides, we won't be in Mexico when I meet up with them, but I know they'll want to head that way.\" I hesitated… remembering Young Gun's scene \"You have to test yourselves gentlemen.\" I gave a small smile. \"Now… about where you live.\" He said. \"Billy it's not…\" I started, but he held up his hand. \"Now that the gang's gone there's something I want to tell you… come on. On your feet.\" \"What?\" \"Up.\" He said. Without my concent or really even giving me the chance to stand up, he hooked his elbows under my arms and picked me up. \"Alright!\" I said. \"Close your eyes.\" He said. I planted my hands on my hips, remembering what happened last time I had closed them. I shut them tight. Billy pushed me back gently. \"Follow me.\" He said. I did so. We walked for quite a ways… a good distance from camp and further into high brush. I could feel it rubbing against my elbows and arms and then I heard the trickle of water. \"Open em.\" He said. I did so. What lay before me was something you'd only see in movies… because places this beautiful didn't exist anymore (in my time). The mountain provided a backdrop to the scene which lay before me now. A crystal clear lake with a creak trickling down the hill provided a small waterfall on the far end. I could see all the way down to the bottom and from here could feel the heat of the water. \"Hot spring…\" Billy said. I smiled. \"It's beautiful.\" I said. \"Ya… I miss places like this. Do you know I can read and write?\" Billy asked. \"Ya… I said starring at the sparkling water. \"You know how?\" he asked. \"You're mother taught you. She was a school teacher…\" I said. \"Now… this is a wild shot. But I'm guessing the same reason you know so much about me and my gang… is the same reason you won't tell me where you live.\" I stopped. \"You said I wouldn't believe your story and I'm asking you to trust me and spit it out.\" \"Billy… if I told you, you'd think I'm crazy.\" \"A girl who wears pants and shoots at the law only to save a bunch of convicts? It's a little late to stick with the sane theory.\" He said. \"Oh my gosh can we leave it? Look, I'll go back to Albuquerque, and you can meet up with your gang and go kill off the last of Murphy's' men…\" Billy was watching me carefully. He licked his lips and then looked at the floor. He sighed. \"Ya I could…\" he said and the look up at the sky \"only to get shot in the back by Pat Garret with my boots off on the middle of the night of some festival?\" My blood went cold, and I shivered. \"H… how do you know that?\" \"How do you?\" he asked. I swallowed. \"Billy...\" \"I asked you to trust me. You said you're story was unbelievable and I said you'd be surprised. Where are you from Elisha?\" \"I already told you… Lincoln.\" I said. \"But you didn't stick around Lincoln…\" \"Because it was different.\" \"Different when? Different from where you came from?\" \"Billy I…\" I didn't know what to say. \"You know when I was born Lish?\" \"Yes…\" \"You think you know… everybody thinks they know the date. Historians think they got it down.\" I starred at him. \"No… you're… you're lying.\" There was no way… \"And you think I wouldn't believe YOUR story. Lish, I know how to read and write because I learned at Brigman Elementary school. I know exactly what happened to you. You ARE from Lincoln… just not this time period…\" I just starred at him, wondering if what I was hearing was true. \"This hear pond… is plowed over for some rich man's mansion. So music rapper named Tupac.\" \"RAPPER…\" \"Had his own private jet and everything…\" \"Billy how…\" \"You think you were the only one?\" He asked, \"Get you head outta the clouds. How'd you think I avoided the law for so long as such a young age? I'm barley twenty Lish… think it was luck? The time change changed me, just like I know it changed you.\" \"Are you even the real Billy the Kid then?\" Billy rolled his eyes. \"Yes. Yes I am. I swapped times when I was thirteen. I grew up here. Learned the way of life and I accepted my life in the west. I became the outlaw written in the history books. My name really is William H. Bonney. I really am Billy the Kid. But I'm not from here.\" \"That's…. that's no possible.\" I stuttered. He laughed. \"Coming from you… that's saying something. I knew there was something different about you when I saw you. The moment I saw you, I thought \"I wonder.\" Our paths crossed again, and I saw in your eyes the same look I see in mine. That look… the time change does it to you. That spark in your eye… that cold stare that would turn a rattler's blood hot.\" \"But… i… it's… the… HOW?\" Billy shrugged. \"My mother died here. I enjoyed it here. John Tunstall did to. He would have made it far if he hand't gotten shot.\" \"If you know the history so well… why didn't you change it?\" I asked, \"Why didn't you try and save Tunstall?\" \"I did. I tried.\" He avoided my gaze, starring at the floor, \"Believe me I tried. But you can't overwrite history. I can't change it. You can't.\" \"But you're gonna get shot…\" \"Supposedly. There's rumors and theory's that I survive and grow old with a woman named Rosanna… or something.\" He said. I nodded. \"That Patt Gareet missed or let you go…\" I said. Billy nodded. \"Billy that's a rumor though… and most of it leans towards foolish dreams of hopeless romantics.\" \"What do you think?\" he asked me. \"I… I hope it's not a rumor… I hope it's true. I've always hoped you survived that night.\" I said. \"Well when that time comes… I'll find out. I'll find out if I live or die.\" He said, \"Meanwhile, I'm gonna kill every Murphy man in my sights.\" \"What about going back?\" \"Back to what? Nothing there for me.\" He said. \"Then… you said you would get me home… and you knew all along?\" \"I suspected. I could only guess. You wouldn't tell me. I told you that if you trusted me I could get you home…\" I looked at him. He was looking at me his blue eyes alight. \"… and… can you? Get me home?\" \"Yes, Elisha. I can.\" He smiled.[Chapter 30] OH MY GOSH!... i just went through my story and realized like three chapters are missing... some are duplicated and some are in the wrong place! SORRY! I'll be fixing this right away... and then updating with a new chapter. Again i'm so sorry... I'll be labeling the missing chapters so you know which ones are the new ones. Oh my gosh how embarrassing. So sorry to the fans...[Chapter 31] \"What?\" \"I know... it's a little confusing.\" he siad. \"Just a little. I mean... are you sure?\" \"No. I've never done it. But that's what Tunstall siad. \"Give back what you took, and take back what you gave.\" \"How do I even... start?\" \"Well we go back to the beginning!\" he siad, \"But first... we eat. You ever been hunting?\" I looked at him as he went about camp giving more wood to the fire. We were talking about time travel.. how the famous Billy the Kid was actually born closer to my time and just went back in time and decided to stay... and then met someone ELSE who had time travled and died but knew the answer of how to get back... and he wanted to go hunting? \"Hunting?\" was all i could say. \"Ya.. hunting... you know. Shoot something to eat.\" he siad. I gave him a worried look. \"I know what hunting is.\" I siad, \"We still do it where I come from.\" Billy laughed. \"Well lets going hunting.\" he siad, \"Come on.\" He held a hand out to me and I looked up at him. his hat shading his face, his bright blue eyes gleaming at me. Not a worry in the world. He was simply hungry. \"You really live in the moment don't you?\" I said. he scratched his neck. \"When you know the exact date of your foretold death... you kinda have'ta.\" he siad. I took his hand and he pulled me up. \"Rabbit sounds good.\" he said. \"Quick little buggers, but good eat'in.\" Three hours later my stomach was growling and I was crouching behind a bush ready to scare a rabbit we had spotted out of the bushes. Billy was a little ways off, ready. I jumped and yelled waving my arms. The rabbit took off like lighting... nothing but a streak of fur. I had to laugh at it... it dipped and dodged this way and that going for the hills one second and the river the next... Billy never fired. \"What was THAT!\" i yelled at him. \"I couldn't get my sights on it!\" he yelled back. \"You had him!\" \"HER...\" he siad. I looked at him. \"How do you know?\" Billy looked up at me with a mischievous smile. \"She couldn't make up her mind which way to go.\" he siad. I squinted at him. He smiled. Eventually we got a rabbit and ate. I was stiff to the bone, cold and hungry so the rabbit was good. My side hurt... flared every once in a while when I pulled one of my wounds wrong. It was one of these movements that made me drop my plate. \"Dang it...\" I hissed. I picked up the plate and kicked dirt over what food had fallen off. \"What?\" Billy sat down acros from the small fire with his share of the rabbit. \"Nothing... just a bit sore. Tugged on a scar is all.\" \"You alright then?\" he asked. I nodded. \"Dang things take forever to heal.\" \"Looky here... got this on my first date...\" he pulled his shirt color down to reveal a small scar just where shoulder met neck. \"Some wanker ragged on my girl so I told him to shut up.\" \"Told him?\" \"Ya...\" He chuckled, \"Course he didn't have much of a choice cause as soon as he opened his mouth I knocked it shut.\" \"So how'd the scar come into play?\" \"I didn't see his pals.\" he siad, \"Or the knife. I was never any good at caring about odds.\" \"I wouldn't think so.\" i siad, \"You're taking on the Sante fe ring...\" \"I was never very good at staying out of trouble either. But the fights I picked I usually won.\" \"What about your date?\" \"She didn't think i looked so pretty covered in blood and bruises.\" he siad. \"I guess she...\" i started. But a chill went up my spin, stopping me cold in my sentence. \"No matter though. She grew up to be somewhat of preacher's daughter. Last i heard she was condemning a sheep herder...\" he siad. I looked at him. He seemed unbothered. But the chill came again. My blood went hot. \"Billy...\" I started. \"Her father wouldn't have agreed anyway. A fancy man he was...\" he siad. Then i saw it. He had his plate in one hand... his other hand awkwardly doing nothing... just sitting on his lap... free to draw his gun at any moment. He looked up at me from under his hat. Our eyes met... he felt it to. \"Was he a preacher?\" I asked. I glanced at my rifle. Just out of reach. \"Naw...\" something broke in the bushes. Billy spun and before i even realized he had drawn his gun a loud shot rang out. A figure in the brush fell... a man. The shouting. Lots of it. A ways off but coming our direction. \"Murphy Men!\" Billy shouted. My fingers went numb. Billy grabbed the horse and jumped up. I kicked the fire out and grabbed my rifle as Billy pulled beside me. He held a hand down to me and pulled me up. \"YAH!\" He snapped the reigns and we took off. A single shot rang out. We both ducked. I looked behind us. \"Look out!\" I saw two more flanking us fast... BIlly pulled the horse in a different direction. The two more fell in behind us not far behind. \"Aw...\" Billy swore under his breath. The horse hit rough terrain suddenly and fell hard. Billy and I flew through the air. We tumbled to a stop and i felt a sharp pain on my head... my vision went black.[Chapter 32] The first thing I realized was my head was throbbing. And there was sand and dirt on my face. I went to brush it off... but found a rough resistance. My hands were tied... I cracked my eyes open... only getting blurry images. It was all black... and for a second i thought i had gone blind... but i saw a bright blur of red and orange... a fire. Dark figures walking about with quiet murmurs and dark chuckles. Five... six... Seven of them. I moved my head to look around and as I did I realized my shirt was wet around my neck and below my shoulder. It took me a second to realize what it was... in the dim firelight m shirt shone black... I swallowed... and tugged on my hands again. Tied to a post in the ground. I looked around for BIlly. I found him timed to a pose in the ground maybe a yard or two from me. I had to stop and stare for a second... his bright blue eyes scared me now. They were fixed on the figures by the fire. A bright and cold glare. My blood ran thick... the look of a killer. A crazy look that burned as bright as the fire. \"Billy?\" i whispered. Billy looked over snapping his gaze to me. Suddenly his gaze was soft... starring at me worried. \"Hey... are you ok?\" he asked now his entire focus on me. I relaxed a little. \"I'm not sure...\" I siad, \"I think my wounds opened again...\" Billy muttered something i figured to be curse words and names directed at the men. \"Murphy men?\" i asked. \"I think so.\" he siad. \"What are they going to do with us?\" I asked. As soon as I asked Billy wearily looked away... he knew... he had heard them talking. \"Billy...\" he didn't answer. I didn't ask again. \"They're keen on the prize money for bringing in Billy the Kid dead or alive... not to keen on the alive part.\" he siad cooly. I looked at him. \"You don't look worried.\" i siad. He gave me a side glance and then i realized... \"What? What else? What aren't you telling me?\" He pulled on his ropes. \"Billy?\" He wasn't looking directly at me but i could see his eyes... they gave him away. That bright look that would make the devil himself think twice was gone... that cocky smile that always showed up in the darkest moments for no reason at all... was gone. He was worried. About WHAT? \"Billy WHAT...\" i started. \"Look...\" Billy licked his lips and glanced at the men then back at me. My heart skipped a beat. The look in his eye now? I couldn't understand... i couldn't quite grasp it. \"Listen to me...\" he siad, \"I won't let them. Ok? I won't let them touch you, ya understand? They lay a finger on you and they will be a gawk-eyed pale corpse before...\" \"WHAT?\" my voice cracked... I lost all feeling in my arms. My stomach tightened and i felt like a cold hand had a stone grip on my chest... i found it suddenly hard to breath. Panic started to swell... \"Look... me...\" i couldn't make out what he was saying. I was looking at the dark figures looming out ahead of me... \"Lisha... at... Lisha look at me.\" Sheer panic made my gaze dart at him... my eyes locked with his and i froze. \"They aren't going to lay a finger on you... you understand?\" His voice was smooth... so sure of himself \"I'm going to get us out of here... both of us... before they can kill me... or do anything else got it? I promised to get you home safe and sound and that's what I'm going to do, you understand? Do you understand me? Nod your head...\" I nodded. \"Good. Now I need you to hang in there. Can you do that? Lisha? I nodded again, tugging furiously at me ropes, \"Breath...\" he siad, \"Calm down...\" I tried to... i really did... \"Elisha...\" I looked over at him. He had a cocky grin and a spark in his eye, \"Lish I got this.\" My breathing went back to normal. My stomach was still tight but i had the panic under control. I took a deep breath. We were going to get out of here. Only a few minutes went by. I was getting more and more uncomfortable... getting lightheaded. I didn't know if it was panic or from loosing blood, but I was fighting the thought of dying. Panic came and went as thoughts drifted through my head. My blood would go cold anytime I thought i saw one of the figures look over at me or step our way. A quick look at Billy and it subsided. Two men came over and I almost screamed. But they weren't going for me... they cut Billy loose. They threw him to the sand, one of them kicking him in the stomach. \"Some sharpshooter.\" someone muttered. \"The famous BIlly the Kid... eating sand off my boot. I like that.\" \"A sharpshooting left-hander. You know you killed my brother?\" \"And my cousin. Leading a Posse for your head he was.\" \"Well then they were probably shooting at me first.\" Billy siad. \"Leave the rat alone boys.\" came a voice from the fire. \"We're just having a little fun...\" the first one called back. He turned back and took a might fist across his face. Billy fell back, unable to catch himself with tied hands. I squirmed. \"You know my Cousin was Murphy...\" \"Well you ended up with the short end of the stick didn't you.\" Billy laughed, spitting out blood. \"You killed him... right there in the streets.\" \"He killed John on the way home from a new years party. I made a promice...\" \"A convict keeping to his promises! How cute!\" Again the second one threw a fist across his face, and then second stepped into a kick. \"STOP IT!\" came a high pitch voice... a voice? MY voice! Where the HELL did that come from! SHUT UP! But they were looking at me now. \"He's ain't much is he?\" someone else said. \"No Jeff... he sure aint.\" \"But she's something... en't she?\" \"Yes Jeff she is.\" I couldn't see their faces... their back to the fire. \"Frank Windy Cahill. He died at Fort Grant from an outbreak in which he got shot. He had a disrespect for my mother and left her broken. I made a promise to him. Poof. William Morton, Jesse Evens, Tom Hill, Frank Baker and Sheriff Brady... all died on separate days... all died by a gunshot. They shot Tunstall. Poof dead. The Morton brothers... poof. dead. I made a promise to them. Tom Kiddney... dead. Made a promise to him too. Poof Poof. Made a promice to Joe WIlalrd and Kenneth Peppin to...\" \"They ain't dead...\" siad one. Billy's eyes lit up. \"Have you heard from them lately?\" The two looked at each other. \"Poof.\" \"You little...\" \"Boys...\" Billy siad, they looked back at him, \"I'm a man of my word.\" \"What?\" they asked. \"I gave a promise. To keep her safe.\" The two men laughed, throwing their heads back. \"Well that may not be a promise you get to keep! How do you feel about that? You broke a promise kid...\" \"I don't just make promises willy nilly. I make only the ones i know I can keep... the one where I know I have got one up on the other idiot.\" \"You listen here, you're the idiot.\" \"If i'm an idiot i wouldn't have lasted this long.\" \"Only an idiot would go up against the Santa fe ring... it's a hundred against one.\" \"Yet half of them are dead. My promises come with the knowing that i'm gonna do it... the knowing that it's already done. So I'll say this once. You lay a finger on her... i'll gut you open and lay your gizzard out for the buzzards. I promise.\" he siad, his face dark, his voice sending chills down my spine. His glare was sharp and had both men turning ghostly white. They starred at him... wondering. Suddenly one of the men by the fire broke in a laugh. His dark figure was larger than the others... but not in a way that would slow him down. He was a barrel chested man with thick arms and a low hat. \"I like you kid...\" he siad, \"You got spunk.\" \"Thanks.\" Billy siad with a smile. \"Come on Skid... let's just kill him. Reward is for dead OR alive...\" the first man siad. Skid, the larger man gave a smile, flashing stained teeth. He stood up and pulled his gun. I tensed and glanced at Billy. He smile slowly turned, his bright eyes on the gun. ","Summary":" I pulled up a chair to the table. My family was sitting around, my dad with a deck of cards.

Miramar, California. \"I got a call today,\" said Charlie as she stepped into the kitchen. Maverick was standing at the sink, staring out into the night as he ran a sponge over the same wine glass over and over again. \"Maverick?\" \"I heard you,\" he muttered, shutting the water off. \"It was from the Pentagon,\" Charlie said, flicking her eyes over him warily. \"Another job offer?\" \"Yes.\" \"Okay, fine,\" Maverick said, setting the glass down on the counter a little harder than he meant to, \"fine, what do you want me to say?\" \"I don't expect you to say anything.\" \"Then why'd you bring it up?\" he demanded. \"Because I don't know what to do.\" Maverick was silent as he dried his hands. \"Maverick, please .\" \"God damnit,\" Maverick snapped, \"god damnit , Charlie! What do you expect me to say? You wanted to raise a family, you've been happy, I've made you happy! Now all of a sudden you're making it sound like Washington is breaking down our fucking door, you're in such high demand -\" \"It's not all of a sudden, honey -\" \"I sure as hell wasn't hearing about it before!\" \"Please,\" she told him, blue eyes flashing, \" please stop yelling. Nick's just in the other room.\" Maverick began absent-mindedly twisting his wedding band up and down his finger, looking around the room, eyes lighting anywhere but Charlie's face. Finally he said, quietly, \"I'm trying, here. I really am.\" Charlie didn't answer, just shook her head as she slid a few dishes into the sink. May 17, 1998. United States Navy Fighter Weapons School, Miramar, California. \"You seem distracted,\" Jester said, as Maverick shuffled a stack of papers into order. \"No, I'm okay,\" Maverick replied, running a hand through his dark hair. \"Well, good, because you're about to get some news and I don't know how you're gonna take it,\" Jester told him, as the latest group of pilots began filing into the room. They had arrived a few weeks ago, shavetail lieutenants with eager smiles, brimming with confidence. Maverick found it hard to believe he had ever been one of them. \"Huh?\" Maverick replied, looking up, but Jester had already moved on, addressing the boys. \"Today, gentlemen, you will have the honor of meeting a highly decorated naval aviator, who attended this very school before taking a tour of duty around the world. He flew alongside Commander Mitchell,\" Jester said, gesturing toward Maverick, \"and was the top of his class in nineteen eighty-six.\" Maverick was still half-absorbed in thoughts of Charlie, thoughts of marriage counseling and far-away job offers and the son that he never seemed to be able to do right by, but that phrase - top of his class in nineteen eighty-six - jerked him out of his reverie. \"Please welcome Commander Tom Kazansky,\" Jester said, \"or Iceman,\" and the aforementioned stepped through the door. Maverick felt like he had been punched in the gut. Iceman was as handsome as ever, face now lined with twelve years of sun and smiles and emotion, hair shorter, darker, uniform decorated like a store-front Christmas tree. His hazel eyes lit on Maverick for an instant, and then a smile graced his lips. \"He has most generously offered his teaching services, and we have accepted,\" Jester said, and stepped back, glancing at Maverick. \"Oh, have we?\" Maverick muttered, but walked forward and touched his forehead in salute. \"Iceman,\" he said. \"Maverick,\" Iceman replied, mirroring his salute, and smirking slightly. \"Good to see you.\" Maverick nodded. \"You too,\" he said, and shook Iceman's hand. His spine tingled and he pulled away, addressing the class. \"Okay, today we're going to discuss the effects the two conformal fuel tanks have on the drag ratio of the F-15E Strike Eagle,\" he said, and out of the corner of his eye, he saw Iceman looking at him with that familiar steady gaze.[Chapter 2] May 19, 1998. United States Navy Fighter Weapons School, Miramar, California. There was a soft knock at Maverick's door. \"Sir?\" Maverick looked up. \"Lieutenant Padgett,\" he said, clearing his throat. \"Come in.\" \"I was just curious what, uh,\" said Padgett, first name Harvey, who went by the callsign of Snowflake, because he was pale all year round no matter how much sun he got. \"What your latest evaluation of my flying was based off of? Sir?\" \"Your flying,\" Maverick replied, running a hand through his hair. \"Yeah, but, sir--\" \"Look,\" Maverick interrupted him. \"You're good. But you could be better. You need to learn to trust your instincts more. Let your gut take over once in a while.\" Padgett nodded. \"I understand.\" \"Dismissed,\" Maverick told him. On his way out Padgett said, \"oh, hello, sir,\" and Maverick looked up again to see Iceman cutting a tall, dark figure in his doorway. His heart jumped into his throat. When they both were alone, Iceman said, \"So.\" Maverick didn't exactly know how to respond to that. \"Did Metcalf retire?\" Iceman said, wandering over to the bookshelf, straightening the spines of thick novels full of flight tactics. \"What?\" Maverick said, jerking his attention away from Iceman's fingers. \"Viper.\" \"Oh, yeah,\" Maverick said. \"Three years ago.\" He realized he was fiddling with his wedding band and stopped, but not before Iceman had turned around. \"And you and Blackwood got married?\" Iceman sat down across from him. \"Ten years this December,\" Maverick said quietly. Iceman nodded. \"So where were you stationed?\" Maverick asked him. \"Here and there,\" Iceman replied shortly. They sat in silence for a moment, not meeting each other's eyes. \"You have a kid,\" Iceman said, finally. \"Excuse me?\" Iceman gestured toward the picture of the three of them on his desk. \"Oh,\" Maverick said. \"Nick. He's eight.\" \"Nick,\" Iceman murmured. \"After Bradshaw?\" \"After Goose, yeah.\" They lapsed into silence again. Iceman stood up to leave, then tilted his head at Maverick and said, \"Funny how things never change, Mitchell.\" \"Funny,\" Maverick repeated, rubbing the inside of his thigh with his fingertips, trying to ignore the prickling in his lap. The door closed behind Iceman and Maverick went back to playing with his wedding ring, slipping it on and off and staring into space. - May 22, 1998. Lyric Opera House. San Diego, California. \"Lord, is it good to see you, Maverick,\" Carol cried, pulling him into a hug. \"Charlotte, you look gorgeous,\" she told Charlie, who smiled and dabbed at her lipstick with a finger. \"Hey, Carol,\" Maverick said, smiling. \"Hi, Richard,\" he added, shaking Carol's husband's hand, and it still felt strange to him, even though they'd been married five years and Goose had been gone for twelve. \"Sorry we're late,\" Charlie said, glancing at Maverick. \"We had a bit of trouble with the sitter.\" \"Oh, don't worry about it, honey,\" Carol said. \"I remember when Scott was that age. Seems like it was yesterday, and now he's nearly off to college,\" she said. \"I'll go check the coats,\" Richard said. Charlie handed him her shawl. \"While you're doing that, sweetheart, I'll run to the little girl's room,\" Carol said, and turned to Charlie. \"You want to come with?\" \"Actually, I have something to discuss with Pete,\" Charlie said, and Carol nodded and left. Maverick's smile faded. \"What do you want?\" he said through gritted teeth. \"We need to talk,\" Charlie said. \"Is this really a good time? Does this seem like a good time to you?\" \"You won't talk to me otherwise.\" \"That's bullshit --\" \"It's not a divorce I'm talking about, Maverick, it's a trial separation. It's just a little time apart, a little time to think --\" \"You just want me gone so you can get your own damn lawyer and figure out how you're going to carve up our family! I'm not stupid, Charlie, I see the numbers you write down for divorce attorneys!\" \"That's the worst case scenario, dear, because I seem to be the only one that ever plans for the worst case scenario! I'm trying to think of what's best for our son!\" People standing around them in the lobby began to stare. Maverick stared back at them defiantly and they averted their eyes. \"Yeah, you're the only one who ever knows what's best for our son,\" Maverick snapped. \"Because you're the only one that ever does anything right, I forgot.\" \" God ,\" Charlie hissed, \"you just take everything at face value --\" \"If you're leaving me,\" Maverick interrupted her, \"I'd like to know, so I can get on with my life. Don't run around behind my back and then talk semantics to my face, and don't you dare act like you know what's best for my son better than I do.\" She stared at him. \"Hey.\" Maverick turned to see Carol handing him two tickets. She glanced between the two of them and cleared her throat. \"Just in case you get up during intermission.\" He handed Charlie one of them. She took it wordlessly. \"Well,\" Richard said as he approached them. \"Time to go in, I guess. What's this play, Lady Butterfly?\" \"Madame Butterfly,\" Charlie murmured. Carol took Charlie by the arm and they walked through the gold-rimmed doors together, Maverick and Richard a pace behind. \"Hey,\" Richard said in an undertone. \"I don't mean to pry, but uh -- is everything okay?\" \"Yeah,\" Maverick lied. \"Yeah, everything's fine.\" He flashed a fake grin that made his jaw ache with the effort. \"Just wondering,\" Richard said, and patted him awkwardly on the arm as they stepped into the darkness of the theater.[Chapter 3] A/N: Some pretty dark stuff is going to happen next chapter, just a warning. - May 24, 1998. Miramar, California. \"I could stay with my sister.\" Maverick sighed, set down his cup of coffee, and began rubbing his temples. \"It would just be temporary --\" \"Then why don't you stay in a hotel?\" \"Because --\" \"Because it's not just temporary , right?\" \"Stop interrupting me. I'll go stay with my sister in Napa --\" \"Napa? I thought Libby lived in San Jose.\" \"No. I don't know where you got that idea.\" Maverick was quiet. \"For how long?\" \"Until we've got this sorted out.\" \"Well, when is that gonna be?\" Charlie tucked a lock of hair behind her ear. \"Hey, Mom?\" They both looked up to see Nick standing in the doorway, baseball glove in his hand. He glanced between them. \"Can I go over to Danny Costello's? His mom said it would be okay.\" \"Um,\" Charlie said distractedly, \"I don't see why not --\" \"Did you put it under your mattress?\" Nick's brow knit in confusion, and then he realized that Maverick was talking about his glove. \"Oh, to break it in? Yeah. So can I, Mom?\" \"Yes,\" Charlie said. \"Yes, it's fine.\" A moment later the front door had slammed behind him. - May 25, 1998. United States Navy Fighter Weapons School, Miramar, California. \"Kazansky?\" Iceman looked up. Maverick cleared his throat. \"I have a few things you need to sign,\" he said, handing him a manilla folder across his desk and shifting his weight from one foot to the other. \"Fine,\" Iceman muttered, accepting it and returning to his computer, brows furrowed as he leaned back in his chair. Maverick circled the desk, stopping next to Iceman, who turned to him, swiveling in the cheap, standard-issue but nicely upholstered desk chair. Maverick stared into his hazel eyes and felt everything reflected in them -- wedding cake and thirtieth birthdays, terraces with crawling ivy and Congratulations, It's A Boy balloons, his supposed happiness -- rushing up slap him in the face. He drew in a breath. \"What you said today about strike missions...\" Iceman tipped his head back and nodded. Maverick's eyes slid across his neck and he lost his train of thought. \"So you never settled down,\" he said, glancing at Iceman's bare ring finger. \"No,\" Iceman replied, gazing back at him, voice even. \"Guess I didn't find the right... the right person.\" Maverick got even closer, his knee between Iceman's thighs, gently running his hands over his chest. He popped the first button of the collar on his dress whites, and slipped his finger through the hole. \"Maybe you got lucky,\" he murmured, \"'cause settling down isn't all it's cracked up to be.\" \"Mitchell,\" Iceman said, voice suddenly strained. \"I think you're getting the wrong idea,\" he said, nudging his hands away. \"I don't think so,\" Maverick said, fingers trailing down Iceman's stomach to his lap, where the fabric of his pants tented. Iceman cleared his throat and sat forward, pushing Maverick off. \"I'm not going to be responsible for you fucking up your marriage,\" he said, quiet and stony. \"My marriage is already fucked up,\" Maverick told him. They stared at each other. \"Get out of my office,\" Iceman told him. Maverick didn't move. \"I'm not going to tell you twice.\" Maverick brushed himself off and left, stomach in knots. He was barely down the hallway when he ran into Jester. \"Commander Heatherly,\" he said. \"Afternoon,\" Jester replied. \"Were you just talking to Iceman?\" Maverick swallowed. \"Yes.\" \"Did he mention anything about the Pacific?\" \"Uh... no.\" \"Ah,\" Jester said. \"I was reading up on his file an hour or so ago. Didn't get the specifics, but turns out he went through some pretty tough shit. Had a real rough time of it, lost a lot of good men.\" Maverick nodded. \"Guys go through something like that, they're almost never the same again. Well, I'll see you later, Commander.\" Jester disappeared down the hallway. Maverick took in a deep breath and continued on his way.[Chapter 4] A/N: This chapter is partially an homage to the film American Beauty, so if you see any similarities, they were intentional. It's also pretty dark, like I said last chapter -- so, possible trigger warning. - May 28, 1998. Miramar, California. Moonlight was pooling into the room, dropping gently through the curtains and falling across the bed in pale squares. Charlie was sleeping softly, facing away from him, her nightgown making a shhsh -ing sounds against the sheets as she moved. Maverick shut his eyes tightly as he slipped his hand beneath the covers and ran a hand along himself, arching his back. He pressed his face into his pillow and bit his lip. Iceman's face filled his mind, his lithe, shirtless body, frozen as it was twelve years ago. He strained to remember details -- the freckle near his collarbone, the exact color of his eyes, his blonde hair... Maverick imagined fisting his fingers in it, straddling his lap, Iceman looking up at him, shrewd, the curve of his brow in shadow, Iceman inside of him -- He let out a choked moan, bending over himself. Charlie sat up. \"What the hell are you doing?\" \"Fuck,\" Maverick said, as pre-come leaked onto his fingertips. He rolled over. \"Go back to sleep.\" \"What are you doing ?\" \"We haven't had sex in six months,\" Maverick muttered, getting up and flicking a bedside light on. He stumbled into the bathroom and began rinsing his hands off. \"What do you expect?\" \"Oh, please,\" Charlie hissed. \"Like I had any choice in the matter --\" \"Yeah,\" Maverick interrupted her in a loud voice, \"that's me, the ineffectual husband, the piece of shit father, just like my father, I guess, you want to fucking bring that up again? How my daddy problems are preventing me from having a healthy relationship with my wife --\" \"I never --\" \"That's all you could fucking talk about in counseling! You made me sound like I was the only one who needed therapy, when you're the one who holds yourself hostage every time I do something you think is wrong!\" \"You quit on therapy! You quit on everything!\" \"I didn't quit on you! You're quitting on me!\" Maverick wheeled around and slammed the bathroom door behind him. \"So what do you think about when you jack off, huh, Pete? That waitress the other night at dinner? I saw you checking out her ass, I'm not blind, you know --\" \"That's none of your business,\" he snapped, sitting on the bed. \"Come on, you can tell me,\" Charlie said, taunting him. \"It's not like we're trying to save anything here, are we? You're just waiting for me to give up on you so you can pretend that's what I was doing all along, even though I've been working my ass off to save this marriage, even though I raised your son for nine years. I can't even get a straight answer out of my husband!\" \"You really want to know? I was thinking about Iceman,\" Maverick hissed through clenched teeth. The blood drained out of Charlie's face. \"Excuse me?\" \"He came back to teach at TOPGUN,\" he said. \"And you know what I did the other day? I went into his office and hit on him, I tried to get him to have sex with me, because I can't get any from my fucking wife! Like father like son, right? Tell that to your goddamn therapist!\" Maverick stood up and shoved the lamp off of their bedside table, breathing hard. Charlie stood there, stock-still, like she had been punched in the gut. Maverick couldn't look at her. Suddenly, she ran out of the room. Maverick sat down again on the bed and buried his face in his hands. She came back in with a suitcase. The closet door slammed open. \"What are you doing?\" he asked, looking up. \"I'm going,\" she spat. \"I don't have to deal with this shit anymore, I refuse to.\" \"Fine!\" he yelled. \"Fine, leave!\" \"It's for good this time, Peter!\" she screamed, shoving random pieces of clothing in the suitcase, hands trembling. \"I'm going to my sister's, I'm getting a lawyer, I'm taking fifty percent and I'm taking my son!\" \"Fuck no!\" he screamed back at her, standing up. \"Just watch me,\" Charlie said, grabbing her suitcase by the handle. \"We'll talk in the morning.\" The door slammed again. A moment later, Nick crept into the room like a ghost. Maverick stared at him. \"Dad?\" he said. \"I heard yelling. Where's Mommy going?\" Maverick opened his mouth to respond and found he couldn't. His shoulders were shaking. Nick left the room. Maverick heard his feet pounding the stairs. \"Mom! Mom!\" The gravel of the driveway crunched underneath the wheels of their Escalade as Charlie pulled out, and then there was silence.[Chapter 5] A/N: Iceman makes a reappearance next chapter. - May 31, 1998. Miramar, California. The phone rang. Maverick lunged for it before it could make any more noise -- Nick was still, as far as he knew, asleep. \"Hello?\" \"Hello,\" said an irritatingly pleasant male voice. \"Is this Commander Pete Mitchell that I'm speaking to?\" \"Yeah,\" replied Maverick. \"Yeah, it is. Who the hell is this, calling at eight in the morning?\" \"My apologies. I was told I should call between the hours of eight to ten on the weekend... My name is Beverly Billington, and I'm your wife's divorce attorney.\" Maverick's chest tightened. \"What do you want?\" he said, fingers drumming the countertop. \"I'm truly sorry to have disturbed you, sir --\" Maverick rolled his eyes \"-- but Ms. Blackwood --\" \"Mrs. Mitchell,\" Maverick snapped. \"Oh, I'm sorry, Commander, but that's how she introduced me to herself --\" \"Listen,\" Maverick hissed into the phone. \"Stop apologizing, I hate that, stop talking about my wife like you know her better than I do, stop calling me Commander, my name is Maverick, and tell me what the fuck you want .\" Beverly Billington stuttered and cleared his throat. \"Excuse me,\" he said. \"I called because I'd like to get in touch with your lawyer.\" \"I don't have a lawyer.\" \"I'd advise you to get a lawyer.\" Maverick continued to drum the countertop. \"I'll call you back when I've contacted one,\" he said, finally. \"Can I get your number?\" Beverly gave it to him and he scrawled it down on a paper towel. After he hung up he rifled through the drawers of the island, pulled out the address book, and flipped to B. \"Hello?\" \"Hey, dolls, this is Libby Blackwood. I'm out right now, so leave a message. If it's business related, my office number's 408-555-8160.\" There was a beep. \"Hi,\" Maverick said. \"I was trying to reach Charlie --\" \"Hello?\" Something warm flooded through his stomach when he heard Charlie pick up, but it passed quickly and he felt lead settle into his chest again. \"Hey.\" \"What do you want?\" she said, voice icy. \"Nick's a mess without you here,\" Maverick said. \"He should be fine staying alone with his father,\" Charlie said. \"It's not like you left for Disneyland,\" Maverick snapped. \"He knows something's up.\" Charlie was quiet for a moment. \"I'm not asking for a lot,\" Maverick said. \"I was thinking maybe we'd take him out to dinner,\" Charlie said, \"a nice place, and explain it to him.\" \"Explain what to him? What is there to explain? You leave in the middle of the night, you don't even tell me where you're going --\" \"Of course I was at Libby's. Where else would I be?\" \"And then I've got divorce attorneys named Beverly calling me up --\" \"He called you?\" \"Not ten minutes ago, he called me, yeah.\" \"Listen, all I'm suggesting is that we act civil toward each other on behalf of our son.\" Maverick didn't like the sound of that. 'Civil' was a divorce word, it was a hard and cold and perfunctory word, without affection and without malice. \"We'll take him out to dinner,\" Maverick said, \"and then what?\" \"We'll settle that later.\" \"Settle it where?\" \"With our lawyers. In court.\" \"Settle what?\" \"Maverick, don't be infantile.\" \"No, I mean it. Settle what?\" \"We'll discuss this later,\" she told him, and hung up. Maverick called back, but he got the answering machine again, and again, and again. - June 2, 1998. Parrillada el Gaucho Steakhouse, Miramar, California. \"I don't want a kids menu,\" Nick said defiantly, looking up at the waitress. \"All right, little man,\" the waitress said cheerfully. \"I like a guy that knows what he wants.\" She tweaked his nose, handed him an adult menu and departed. Charlie cleared her throat. \"Nick, sweetheart, do you know what it means when two people get divorced?\" Maverick put aside his beer and steepled his fingers. \"Yeah,\" Nick told her. \"Shelby's parents got divorced when she was in second grade. She lives at both their houses. She said when they got divorced they bought her a puppy.\" He flicked his eyes between them. \"Can we get a puppy?\" \"No,\" Maverick told him. \"We can talk about it,\" Charlie said. Maverick felt guilt radiating from her as she shifted in her seat and picked invisible lint off her blouse. \"Nick, your mother and I haven't been happy for a long time,\" he said. \"It has nothing to do with you, I promise,\" Charlie added quickly. \"No, of course not, we're not saying it does.\" Nick took a sip of his root beer. \"I don't get it,\" he said. \"Nick, honey,\" Charlie said. \"I might be moving to Washington.\" \"But why?\" Nick said, glancing back and forth, unsure of who to listen to. \"Mom, you live here. Why would you leave?\" \"Your father and I aren't going to live together anymore.\" \"But why ?\" Nick demanded, and Maverick sensed his son's temper rising. \"We're in the process of becoming legally separated, and your mother's filed for divorce,\" Maverick said shortly. \"But --\" Nick's dark blond brow furrowed over his green eyes. \"Why can't you stay here?\" he asked Charlie. \"I can't afford to live away from your father unless I take a job in D.C.,\" she told him quietly. \"Where am I gonna live?\" Nick said. \"With one of us,\" Maverick told him. \"Which one?\" \"Whoever you choose,\" Charlie said. Maverick felt the bottom drop out of his heart. He put his palms face-up on the table and stared at the grain of the wood. \"We'll figure it out when the time is right,\" Charlie added. \"We have to take into account what's best for you. The courts may not want you to stay with me until I've closed escrow on a house, and my hours will be long, and they may not want you to stay with your father if he's an unfit parent.\" \"What the hell is that supposed to mean?\" Maverick snapped, forgetting his son was even there. Charlie glared at him. \"Figure it out,\" she told him. Maverick got up and strode away from the table. He left the restaurant and stepped outside into the balmy night, letting out a breath and closing a fist around his dog tags.[Chapter 6] June 6, 1998. United States Navy Fighter Weapons School, Miramar, California. Maverick liked how footsteps sounded on the battleship linoleum floors. That was all he focused on as he made his way to Iceman's office, slipped in the door, and closed it behind him. Iceman looked up from his computer, and Maverick's eyes trailed across his face. He noticed for the first time that his hair was graying at the temples, slightly, and there were dark circles under his eyes. Maverick didn't say anything as he closed the blinds and stepped toward his desk. \"Mitchell, what's this about?\" Maverick unzipped his flight suit and let it drop to the floor. He ran a hand through his hair. Iceman cleared his throat and stood up. \"Mitchell --\" \"What's the matter, Iceman?\" Maverick said, stepping forward, wearing only boxers. He locked eyes with Iceman. \"You don't still find me attractive? Don't still want to fuck me?\" Iceman's left hand twitched. \"I told you I'm not coming in between you and your marriage, I told you --\" \"You already did, Kazansky,\" Maverick said. \"You've been coming in between us for years .\" \"I'm not taking responsibility for your personal fuck-ups,\" Iceman snapped, coming out from behind his desk. Maverick stepped forward, grabbed handfuls of him like he'd disappear at any second, and pulled Iceman toward him. At first he resisted, but Maverick's grip tightened, and he stared defiantly up at Iceman, daring him to stay, daring him to go. Iceman met his lips and Maverick slipped up against him, tugging at his zipper. Iceman stumbled backward, taking Maverick with him, and onto his desk, knocking papers aside. A manila envelope dropped to the floor and resumes fluttered out. Maverick's knee slipped between Iceman's thighs and found him, hard as a rock, as he gasped against Maverick's chest. \" God , I missed you,\" Maverick muttered, drawing his lips over Iceman's neck, up to his jaw, pulling his zipper down farther and ripping at his flight suit, tearing it away from his body. There was a scar across his chest, a shrapnel wound curving under one nipple and slashing over his uppermost rib. Maverick ran his fingers across the raised, harsh skin. Iceman twisted underneath him, his hips sliding just right against Maverick's crotch. \"Mitchell,\" Iceman moaned, \"just, just --\" \"What?\" Maverick panted, grinding against him again as he pinned Iceman's wrist to the desk. That time he managed to twist just right, writhe just hard enough, and orgasm thrilled through his veins. He collapsed into Iceman's form, hand falling to Iceman's crotch and finding he had beat him to it. \"Stop,\" Iceman told him. \"Just stop.\" Maverick rested his head against Iceman's chest and held him close, heart pounding in his chest. \"Here,\" Iceman said, handing him a handkerchief, and Maverick cleaned up as best he could, pulling his flight suit back on and taking a deep breath. He pushed his hair away from his face and Iceman rubbed at his face, at the red teeth marks that lined his jaw. There was a knock at the door. They looked at each other. \"Come in,\" Iceman said, clearing his throat. \"I was just -- oh, excuse me, Commander,\" a flustered-looking young ensign said. \"No, it's all right,\" Maverick muttered. \"I was just leaving.\" \"No, you weren't,\" Iceman said cheerfully. \"Was there something you needed?\" he addressed the ensign. \"Uh, just the, uh, transfer orders for --\" Iceman nodded, rifled through his desk, and handed them to him. The door closed again. Iceman's eyes swiveled to Maverick. Maverick folded his arms. Something like shame was running through him, but something like relief was running beside it. For the first time in a long time, he felt alive. \"Can we talk about this later?\" Maverick said hoarsely. \"I have a class.\" \"I don't think we should talk about this at all,\" Iceman replied. Anger flushed high in his cheeks. \" That's fucking typical,\" Maverick snapped. \"Listen, Mitchell,\" Iceman said. \"You're in a bad place right now. I heard about your divorce. You come in here and accost me --\" \"You didn't have to --\" \" Lis ten,\" Iceman repeated. He sighed and rubbed his temples. \"Don't tell me how I feel,\" Maverick said. \"I'm not a kid, Kazansky, I'm thirty-eight years old, for Christ's sake, I know what I want.\" Iceman stared at the ceiling. \"I have a class,\" Maverick told him, again, and left.[Chapter 7] June 11, 1998. Miramar, California. \"Most often, custody is awarded to the primary caregiver,\" said Beverly Billington. \"Which is the mother, about ninety percent of the time.\" Maverick's lawyer -- an almost comically inexperienced young guy from the Doyle, Doyle & O'Connell firm, named Ned Naderman -- looked nervously from Charlie to Maverick and cleared his throat. \"If it's made, we'll fight that decision in court.\" \"Oh, will you?\" Charlie said, sounding slightly amused. \"In any case, Nick's well-being should always come first,\" Beverly added. \"Of course,\" Maverick muttered, drumming his fingers on the mahogany tabletop. \"Miss Blackwood would like to settle as much as possible out of court,\" Beverly told them. \"I'm sure everyone here agrees it would be in the best interest of all parties involved not to drag this out any longer than necessary.\" \"I plan to fight for my son,\" Maverick said. His voice cracked a little and he sat up and looked Charlie right in the eye. \"I'm completely willing to take you to court. For as long as necessary.\" Charlie's gaze dropped, and he felt an overwhelming sense of loss, that he had stood by this woman and loved her for a decade -- and now she could barely look at him. \"Well,\" Beverely said, glancing between them. \"We'll work that out later, won't we?\" June 13, 1998. Ruth's Chris Steakhouse. Miramar, California. Maverick felt like it was his first date again, like he was fifteen, waiting for Iceman to walk in. He had asked Iceman to join him -- \"just a casual dinner, so we can talk business,\" he claimed at the time, but they both knew that couldn't be closer to bullshit -- at this expensive-as-hell steakhouse on the coast, even though his wallet was on its last legs paying for a divorce lawyer who was probably going to wind up losing him his house, his son, and his 401K. But somewhere inside of him there was a daring, reckless piece of happiness, because Iceman hadn't said no to him. And he hadn't refused to touch him, that day in his office. For the first time in years, he was remembering what it was like to be wanted , to want somebody back. He was looking around, adjusting his tie, blinking up at the crystal chandeliers dangling forty feet above him, when Iceman walked in. Maverick's chest clenched. Iceman looked good in a suit. He looked tired and a little jetlagged, almost, but he looked good. Maverick waved him over. Iceman took his time like he always did, moving quietly through the maze of candle-lit four-seater tables. \"Interesting restaurant you pick to talk business in,\" Iceman said drily, sitting down. \"You wore civvies.\" \"So did you.\" They eyed each other for a moment. The waiter came over and Maverick ordered a Miller Lite and Iceman ordered a foreign, German-sounding import, Schliemengorben or something to that effect. The way Iceman's lips closed around the mouth of the bottle made Maverick's stomach twist in a way that wasn't entirely unpleasant. He cleared his throat and accidentally knocked his frosted glass over; Iceman tilted his head at him like he was trying to get a better angle. \"Flustered?\" Iceman said, a grin gracing his lips. Maverick realized it was the first time he'd seen him really smile since the whole encounter with the Russian MiGs, when they were back on the ground and Hollywood was hugging anybody he could get his hands on. \"I like your suit,\" Maverick blurted out. \"So do I.\" \"You always were shit at taking a compliment, Kazansky.\" Iceman chuckled. \"Why am I here, Mitchell?\" he said, sobering and fixing Maverick with a stare. Maverick fiddled with his tie. \"Just wanted to talk.\" \"We can talk anywhere , but I'm paying a hundred and fifty dollars for a mediocre steak and the pleasure of your company.\" Maverick was quiet. \"Unless we're on a date --\" \"Hell no!\" Maverick said, so loudly that a few nearby couples spun in their seats and looked at him in alarm. \"No,\" he said, more quietly. \" -- in which case I'd be paying three hundred dollars for two mediocre steaks and the plea --\" \"Like I'd let you pay for dinner!\" Iceman grinned again. \"All right, Mav erick. Let's talk about something else.\" \"We could talk about your time in the Pacific,\" Maverick said, bluntly. The grin melted away. Iceman gave him a Mona Lisa glare -- angry mouth, dead eyes. Maverick half expected him to get up and walk out, but he just said, \"What about it?\" \"Like what happened?\" \"A lot of things happened. It was war.\" \"Where?\" \"Hell -- Panama, Afghanistan. I was serving my country, Mitchell.\" Maverick didn't like the way he said that. \"I have been, too.\" \"Never said you weren't.\" Maverick sighed and took a sip of his beer. Iceman folded his arms. \"How's your divorce going?\" Maverick felt his other hand curl into a fist. Man , did Iceman know how to push his buttons. \"Fucking fine, thanks,\" he said coolly. \"You know,\" Iceman said, \"All those years... I did kind of miss having someone to beat.\" Maverick's finger drew tight little circles on the neck of his beer. \"It's pretty damn pathetic, but TOPGUN was probably the highlight of my life.\" Maverick glanced down at his lap. \"No, it's not pathetic,\" he said quietly. \"I feel the same way.\" He flashed Iceman a little smile. They locked eyes. \"Where's our damn waiter?\" Iceman said, breaking the moment, and Maverick let out the breath he'd been holding in.[Chapter 8] June 13, 1998. Miramar, California. \"You're home a little late,\" said Sherry, tilting her head as Maverick came in the door. Sherry Sherwood had been the Mitchell's babysitter for years now, and Maverick sometimes thought she knew his son better than he did. She hadn't mentioned the divorce to him yet, not outright, instead choosing to fill their small talk with things like grad school tuition and the weather, but he knew a small part of her was disappointed in him, in both of them, for not being able to make it work. \"Did you put Nick to bed?\" Maverick said, pulling out his wallet. \"Yeah. Rate's ten more, for the extra hour I stayed,\" she said pointedly. He handed her two twenties. \"Thanks. Have a good night.\" \"You too,\" Maverick said, and headed upstairs, unbuttoning his collar and loosening his tie. He stopped off in Nick's room. \"Hi, Dad,\" Nick muttered. \"Hey.\" \"Who were you with?\" Maverick paused in the doorway. \"Uh, an, um -- a colleague,\" he said. Nick's forehead creased, reminding Maverick irrepressibly of Charlie. \"Okay,\" he said. \"Night.\" \"Good night,\" Maverick muttered, and closed the door behind him. There was no reason to feel guilty, he thought, as he walked down the hall and into his lonely tomb of a bedroom. No reason in the world. It was just dinner. Not sex, not chaste, stolen kisses, not even mutual whacking off, just dinner. He was guilty anyway, of course. June 14, 1998. United States Navy Fighter Weapons School, Miramar, California. \"You look happy,\" Jester told him. They were sitting in the officer's lounge, as it was called, really just a standard-issue room where the instructors and the higher-ups came to smoke and have lunch between hops. \"Is that a problem?\" Maverick replied, a little harshly, because Jester's face was twisted in suspicion. \"A problem? No, I just think it's a little strange, is all. Considering the circumstances.\" \"Circumstances -- listen, Commander, I don't see how my circumstances are your concern.\" Maverick was half out of his seat, now, and there was an edge in his voice. Jester stared him down. Someone cleared their throat and Maverick turned. Iceman was standing there, a coffee in his hand, steam rising from the mouth of the cup. \"Mind if I join you?\" he said, sounding a little amused. \"Yeah,\" Maverick said. He sat down again. \"I just thought maybe you found yourself a girlfriend or something,\" Jester said. Maverick shook his head. \"No.\" \"Well, you see it all the time,\" Jester said, taking a bite of his sandwich. \"Guy's wife leaves him -- no disrespect intended, Commander, guy's wife leaves him, his pride's shattered, he runs off with some twenty-year old twinkie --\" Iceman chuckled. \"Twenty-year old twinkie ,\" he repeated with a smirk. Maverick snarled something unintelligible in his direction. Jester glanced between them. His brow furrowed. \"Anyway,\" Iceman said. \"This year's recruits -- really, you couldn't do any better?\" \"We get who we get,\" Jester said. \"The best of the best.\" There was a note of irony in his voice. \"They're just young,\" Maverick said. \"Young and stupid.\" \"Because you've always been such a great judge of character, Kazansky.\" Iceman let that one slide. He fixed Maverick with a stare and Maverick felt heat spread from the arches of his feet up through his face, his cheeks flushing under fluorescent lights. He waited for Jester to deliver the blow, to let them know in plain language he knew exactly what was going on, but all he did was stand, toss his trash away and stride out of the room. Maverick stared at the table. Shame welled in his stomach. He was thinking about last night, about how Iceman had paid for dinner and whispered dirty, pretty things in his ear, and how he had gone home and slept in the bed he shared with his wife for years. For ten years. He looked up and Iceman gave him one of his shark-like smiles, all flashing white teeth and broad black pupils. \"I'll see you later,\" Maverick said. \"After their hop.\" He got up. \"Hold on, Mitchell,\" Iceman said. \"You're always running off somewhere.\" But Maverick was hard, and his breath was hitching. All he wanted was to jerk one off in the privacy of the bathroom. \"I'll see you later,\" he said again, and traipsed out after Jester, ignoring Iceman's eyes on the back of his neck.[Chapter 9] June 16, 1998. Miramar, California. Maverick squinted at the bill from his divorce lawyer. \"Three grand,\" he muttered, \" three grand ...\" He knocked the cap off the beer next to him on the counter and took a long swig. \"Gotta be fucking kidding me.\" He gathered the rest of the mail and tossed it onto the kitchen table. California sunlight was dancing in through the wide bay window of their living room, and Maverick stared into it, caught up in a fantasy of Iceman laying him down in bed -- no, not the bed -- the floor, maybe? one hand underneath his hips, and sliding a finger -- \"Hey, Dad.\" Maverick turned around and quickly smoothed his expression. \"Something the matter?\" \"I have a headache,\" Nick whined. \"Probably allergies,\" Maverick replied. He absent-mindedly shook two pills into his hand, and poured Nick a glass of milk. \"Thanks. Um, hey, Danny Costello got a dirt bike yesterday,\" Nick said, lingering in the doorway, wearing a hopeful expression. \"Your birthday's not for months, we'll talk about it then,\" Maverick told him automatically. \"Fine,\" Nick said, swallowing the pill with a mouthful of milk, making a face, and disappearing. Maverick was lost for a few minutes, doing calculations in his head, wondering if he could balance his checkbook if he paid Ned right away. Math had never been his strong point, something Jester mocked him for on a regular basis. He jerked out of his thoughts when he heard a strangled choking sound from the other room. Fragments flashed through his head -- maybe the cat swallowed another pen cap? -- but then he heard a thud on the parquet floor and he ran into the living room, knowing no cat could make that sound, smashing his knee against the coffee table, yelling his son's name. Nick was on his hands and knees, gagging and gasping for air. There was a bright red rash spreading across his neck. \"Nick -- shit! Can you breathe? Talk to me, talk to me ,\" Maverick begged, and then he leapt up again and ran for the kitchen, dialing the nearest phone, rummaging through the cabinets. He pulled out the nearest bottle of pills, the ones he had given to Nick, and looked more closely at the label. His heart stopped. \"911, what is your emergency?\" \"My son took aspirin,\" Maverick said, \"he's uh, high - highly allergic, I --\" he stared at the bottle. \"Never mind, don't - don't send an ambulance, I'll bring him in myself,\" and he was throwing the phone down and running back into the living room. Nick was slumped on the floor and Maverick seized him, recalling his cadet training, and desperately looking for his pulse as he picked him up and kicked the garage door open. Nick's little silver medical bracelet jangled on his wrist -- how the fuck did he forget? But the two bottles were right next to each other in the cabinet -- A little voice murmured in the back of his head, He's going to die in your arms just like Goose did, you son of a bitch. Maverick let out a choked cry and laid him down across the back, fell into the driver's seat, and slammed on the accelator. June 16, 1998. Seton Coastside Hospital, Miramar, California. Everything after that was a blur of white paper gowns, tubes being shoved down Nick's throat and the pale faces of concerned, hovering nurses, pressing Dixie cups of water into his hands, assuring him that the doctors would pump his son's stomach and take care of him just fine if he'd sit down and relax and is there anyone you want to call? Maverick did wind up calling Charlie, and stuttering out some half-assed explanation. She didn't scream at him, not over the phone, anyway, and made it to the hospital in under an hour, having been in town meeting with (who else) Beverly Billington. When she did get there, the first thing she said to him was, \"Is he okay?\" and the second was a long string of curses and epithets and accusations. Numb as he was, Maverick only managed to be slightly surprised that the uptight, classy Charlie was bawling him out in front of all these people. She was as pale as he was, though, and only when a doctor came out and told them that Nick was breathing on his own now did the color begin to return to her face. Maverick's hands were shaking violently, and continued to shake as he got a Snickers from the vending machine -- by then they'd been there for hours. When he got back to the cluster of chairs outside Nick's room, he mistook her silence for a truce and said quietly, \"Maybe I'll call Carol, she can bring over some flowers and cards and stuff, unless you want me to --\" \"I want you out of this hospital.\" Her voice was a pillar of ice. Maverick paused and stared. \"Excuse me?\" \"You heard me, Pete. I want you out of here. I'm taking him with me when he gets discharged. School's out for the summer, I reserved a hotel room in town. I'm taking him with me, and I want you gone.\" \"You can't do that.\" \"Watch me. And this --\" Charlie waved her hand at her surroundings. \"This is going to be the keystone of my custody battle.\" \"I'm not an unfit father,\" Maverick said. He felt like he was falling. \"You almost killed my son.\" \"It was an accident -- you have no idea how guilty I feel --\" Maverick's throat closed up, and he couldn't say any more. \"An accident,\" Charlie repeated, searing him with her blue eyes. \"An accident . You -- why do you even have aspirin in the house?\" \"I get headaches,\" Maverick snapped. \"You get headaches.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Get out of here. Please. Just get out.\" \"I'm not going.\" \"I'll have you escorted out by security.\" Maverick ran a hand through his hair. \"If you go home now --\" she sighed. \"I'll call you and let you know how he's doing, I promise. But please, please get out.\" He was no longer shaking as he turned on his heel and headed toward the hospital parking lot.[Chapter 10] June 16, 1998. Miramar, California. It was late, near midnight but not quite there, when the doorbell rang. Maverick ignored it. He was lying on his couch, staring at the ceiling as the shadows crept in, fingers clutching an empty bottle of beer. His hair was messy and sweaty and sticking to his forehead slightly. The doorbell was more insistent. Maverick sighed and got up. \"If this is - oh, hey,\" Maverick said. \"Kazansky.\" He tugged his shirt down where it had ridden up over his abs. Rain was pouring down around Iceman in turrets, but he didn't seem to notice. He was clutching a bouquet of flowers in his right hand and there was a look in his eyes that Maverick barely recognized. \"Hey,\" Iceman muttered. \"Eagle, uh, from TOPGUN called me, said your kid was in the hospital -\" Maverick leaned on the doorway. He stared at Iceman's lips for a moment and then tilted his gaze upward. \"Thanks.\" He took the flowers from Iceman. \"Little late, isn't it?\" Iceman drummed his fingers. \"Yeah, well... Special circumstances. So... you gonna invite me in or what, Mitchell?\" Maverick stepped back, but only a foot or so. \"Maybe.\" \"Maybe.\" Iceman was grinning at him, now, infuriatingly. \"Maybe?\" \"It's late -\" Iceman fisted a handful of his shirt and pulled him up and in for a kiss. Maverick's chest tightened. Iceman's tongue was spilling, twisting, into his mouth, and his hands were needy and tugging at Maverick, groping and grabbing him. Maverick seized Iceman by the collar and let out a long breath, holding his jaw in both hands, kissing him urgently. The flowers fell to the floor, forgotten. Iceman nuzzled Maverick, breath catching in his throat, hands everywhere, still, and murmured \"upstairs\" to him. Maverick nodded, head against Iceman's chest. There was weak lightning as they came up the stairs, and then - Maverick counted the beats - a clap of thunder. Iceman twined his fingers in Maverick's and turned back, tilting his head like the Victrola dog. More lightning lit the windows. Maverick's hand went to the crook of Iceman's elbow and he pushed him forward, kissing him. Iceman moaned against his lips and one hand went to the back of Maverick's neck, and the other went to his ass, and Maverick pushed him some more into the bedroom and onto the bed, which creaked under their sudden combined weight. He straddled Iceman and started undoing his buttons, one by one, fingers fumbling. Iceman took his hands and pushed them away and dragged him down to the bed, wrestled him onto his back and pinned him there, sliding a leg between his thighs. Maverick snarled at him, bucked his hips up and buried his face in Iceman's clavicle, licking the underside of his jaw. He nudged at Iceman's hand, who seemed to remember why they were in bed in the first place, and he began to slide Maverick's jeans off his hips while laying soft kisses on the side of his face. Maverick shifted underneath him, pushing at Iceman's solid, broad shoulders and letting out a little gasp when he rubbed himself in the exact right place. \"Hurry up,\" Maverick whimpered. \"Tom -\" Iceman spilled a little lube onto his fingers from the bottle he had hastily swiped off of the dresser and drove his fingers into Maverick, who clutched a fistful of bedsheets and rolled onto his stomach. He groaned as Iceman slid into him, pushing him down against the bed, and pulled a knee up to his chest, twisting and squirming in the sweaty sheets as he came, breathing out a few jumbled syllables. Maverick caught a glimpse of him in the mirror beside the bed as he arched his back. Iceman's eyes were wide and bright and dark in the moonlight, pupils large and cheeks flushed. He swore as he came and Maverick felt Ice's pulse rabbit when he wrapped a hand around Maverick's dick, though he was already long gone as far as orgasm was concerned. Maverick slipped down and tugged Iceman to him, pulling his pants the rest of the way off and tossing them in a corner so that they were facing each other stark naked. He closed his eyes and Iceman drew a thumb over the fan of Maverick's eyelashes on his cheek. \"Hey,\" Maverick murmured. \"Commander.\" Iceman wrapped an arm around him and rested his chin on Maverick's shoulder, and that was how they fell asleep. June 17, 1998. Miramar, California. Maverick wasn't sure what woke him, the sirens or the scream. The sirens were distant and the scream was a foot away so if he was any kind of a betting man, he'd put his money on the latter - but he would never know for sure. It wasn't the kind of screaming you hear when you go to a horror movie, not the self-conscious, high-pitched kind. It was low and guttural and pained. Maverick sat straight up and already had his hand wrapped around the base of the bedside table lamp, preparing to bash in someone's head before he realized it was just Iceman, who was now up, wandering to the bathroom, looking almost abashed. Maverick watched him lean over the sink and douse his face with cold water. \"What the hell was that ?\" \"What was what?\" Iceman said, strolling back into the room. There was a familiar swagger in his step, but his face was chalk-white, and he kept looking around like a spooked horse. \"That - are you okay?\" \"Nightmare,\" Iceman grunted. \"What nightma -\" The sirens in the distance died off. Maverick stared at him. \"I...\" Iceman looked at the ceiling. The fan was spinning idly. \"When I hear ambulances, sometimes I -\" he broke off again and ran a hand through his dark blond hair. \"It brings up stuff. Bad stuff.\" His tone was incredibly curt, like he and Maverick were strangers who had just bumped into each other on the bus. \"Bad stuff. Like what?\" \"Oh, blow me, Mitchell.\" \"I'm just asking,\" Maverick snapped. Iceman sat down on the edge of the bed. Maverick watched the muscles in his back ripple as he sighed. \"I was stationed somewhere off the coast of Turkey and our aircraft carrier got bombed. It was bad.\" \"How bad?\" \"Bad,\" Iceman said. Maverick knew not to push it. \"Is that where you -\" Iceman turned and grazed the shrapnel scar across his chest. \"This? No.\" He didn't elaborate. Maverick checked his watch. \"It's two-thirty,\" he said. \"You have a class tomorrow?\" Iceman shook his head. \"I'm going back to sleep, then,\" Maverick said, rubbing his temples and sinking back onto his pillow. He glanced at the nightstand. Next to the lamp, there was a photo of him, Nick, and Charlie. They were all smiling. He slammed it face-down on the table and rolled over. A moment later, the bed creaked again and Iceman lay beside him.[Chapter 11] June 17, 1998. Miramar, California. Maverick stumbled out of the bathroom, still half-asleep after taking the first piss of the day to find Iceman smirking at him from his seat in the armchair that was next to what was formerly Charlie's dresser. \"Morning,\" Maverick muttered. Iceman was already fully dressed and shaved and it was only, what, seven thirty? You could really get to hate a guy like that. \"Morning,\" Iceman replied. \"Listen...\" Maverick pulled a shirt on. \"Yeah?\" \"I'll cover your afternoon class for you, if you wanted to go see your kid in the hospital,\" Iceman said. \"Your hop, too.\" \"How gentlemanly of you,\" Maverick said, as he did his fly. \"Just an offer,\" Iceman said gruffly. \"No need to...\" he made a slightly rude hand gesture. Maverick rolled his eyes, seizing a bottle of cologne and spraying it all over his throat as he stuffed his browns into a duffel so he could change when he got to TOPGUN. \"I like those jeans,\" Iceman said, voice husky. \"Yeah?\" \"They have a little hole in the ass. C'mere.\" Maverick obliged and Iceman pulled him onto his lap, sliding a finger into the hole and fingering Maverick lightly. He nudged Maverick's neck with his lips and drew them up the side of his face. Maverick shifted his weight and he felt Iceman's dick throb gently against him. Iceman slid his finger out of the frayed hole and ran it down Maverick's thigh. Maverick sucked in a tight little breath and grabbed Iceman by the wrist. \"Stop. I gotta - morning class.\" \"Fine. I need to go home and change, anyway.\" Neither of them moved. Iceman's hand was in a very inappropriate place. Suddenly he stood up and Maverick slipped off his lap. Iceman squeezed his shoulder. \"I'll see you later, then.\" \"Yeah,\" Maverick said. He glanced at Iceman, who was wearing that frustrated I-really-want-to-have-sex-with-you- right-now-goddamnit look that he knew so well. \"Cologne's a little strong,\" said Iceman, and he strode out of the room. June 17, 1998. United States Navy Fighter Weapons School, Miramar, California. \"I'd like to speak with you, Commander.\" Maverick waved his hand vaguely. \"One second.\" Jester shut the door behind him. \"Can we talk in the hall?\" Maverick said, getting up and shuffling his stack of papers. \"I have to deliver these, to, uh -\" \"Langley?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Fine,\" Jester said. His tones were more clipped than usual. He held the door open for Maverick. \"I got the JAG Corps all over me about this court-martial,\" Maverick said. \"And, uh, I'm gonna be slipping out today for a while to see my son, around two o'clock. Kazansky's taking my class.\" \"That's what I wanted to talk to you about.\" \"What?\" \"Kazansky.\" Maverick's mouth twitched. Jester stared pointedly at him. \"Listen, I don't know what kind of fuckin' adulterous, summer of my German soldier bullshit you two are pulling, but it's going to stop. I won't stand for it.\" \"You can't prove anything,\" Maverick said. He clenched his fist around the paperwork. \" Damnit, Heatherly!\" \"Now, you look. No, look at me.\" Jester nudged Maverick's chin with his knuckle and Maverick slapped his hand away. \"There's a reason we have regulations. There's a reason we got DADT, son. We -\" \"Don't you dare call me son! I outrank you, you lying piece of shit!\" People in nearby offices stared. Maverick tried to get his breathing under control. \"And don't you start fucking shrieking at me,\" Jester hissed. \"I'm looking out for your best interest.\" \"How would you even know -\" \"You're walking around here with your neck bit up to hell and back, you think I'm not gonna notice? Especially after that little recital you two put on the other day. You're not even divorced yet, Commander, have some goddamn respect.\" Jester strode away. Maverick watched him go and suddenly found himself craving a cigarette. He had picked up smoking years ago, when his marriage had first started to fall apart and Charlie had begun accusing him of everything from having a short man's complex to daddy issues to emotional neglect. He had only stopped when a little five-year-old Nick came to him, teary-eyed and sniffling, and asked Maverick if he was going to live to see him graduate high school. Nicotine patches had done the trick, but nothing could ever wipe you clean. There was always that urge. Maverick turned and walked back to his office. June 17, 1998. Seton Coastside Hospital, Miramar, California. The PTA had obviously done its job. Maybe with a phone tree or two. Nick's room was soaked in flowers and balloons, cards signed by the entire fourth grade class. \"Hey,\" Maverick said quietly. Nick stirred in his sleep and rolled over. \"Dad.\" He looked pale. Maverick sat on his bedside. \"Hey,\" he repeated, more quietly. \"How you doing?\" \"I'm okay,\" Nick said. \"Sally Netherfield and her brother came to see me. Their mom brought a duck.\" \"A stuffed duck, right?\" \"Yeah.\" Nick made a face. \"Dad, I think Sally likes me.\" Maverick smiled. \"Do you like her?\" \"Are you kidding? Girls are weird ,\" Nick said. \"How come?\" \"They laugh too much.\" \"You get used to it.\" \"You didn't,\" Nick said. It took Maverick a second to get that one. \"Nick, I still love your mother very much,\" he said, staring at the wall across from him. \"We're having a tough time right now. We still love you very much,\" Maverick added, squeezing Nick's shoulder, and thinking suddenly of Iceman. \"What if she moves away and she takes me and I never see you again?\" Nick's eyes were damp. Maverick had never quite realized how much Nick resembled him until then. \"I promise that won't happen.\" \"What if it does?\" \"Do you want to stay with me or her?\" \"I want both,\" Nick said. His voice wavered and he pressed his hand to his mouth. Maverick just sighed.[Chapter 12] June 22, 1998. United States Navy Fighter Weapons School, Miramar, California. \"She's got a pretty good case.\" \"I'd say so, yeah,\" Maverick said, tipping the phone away from his face as he mouthed \"turkey\" at the ensign who was running around taking lunch orders. \"I'm not giving up, though.\" \"Oh, no, of course not,\" Ned said nervously. \"I just - we should restructure your defense as more of a, how much will it hurt this kid to move across the country, et cetera, and we can pull up some statistics - you know. I mean, if she stays here, you have almost no case, I'll be honest with you, Commander. You don't exactly have the greatest -\" \"I've been an excellent father to my son,\" Maverick growled, cutting across him. Whether it was true or not was inconsequential. Law was all about what you could or couldn't prove - quality of anything was a sticking point. \"Oh, of course, sir. Nothing less was implied, sir. I just meant -\" \"Hey, Ned, I'll speak with you later, all right?\" Maverick said. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Jester stroll up to Iceman's office and knock on the glass door. He slammed the phone down before Ned could respond and made his way down the hall. Maverick stood there, watching. Iceman was not an easy guy to read, even for someone who ran on gut instinct and intuition the way Maverick did. His emotions were a crater at the bottom of the ocean that radar passed over. But he was bristling now, anyone could see, leaning on his desk with one hand, fingers drumming faster and faster. If he had a pen in his hand Maverick was sure he would be fiddling with it. Jester seemed almost apologetic. He looked old and tired, but at the same time something about him was slightly defiant. Defiance didn't sit well with Iceman. Maverick tried to read their lips. All of a sudden someone ran into him. \"Sorry, sir -\" \"Oh, Lieutenant Padgett,\" Maverick said, righting himself. \"Christ, watch where you're going,\" he said off-handedly, helping him reshuffle his papers. \"Sorry, sorry,\" Harvey said. He looked haggard. \"Sir, I, um, I actually wanted to talk to you.\" \"Go ahead,\" Maverick said, eyes fixed on Iceman's office. \"I was just wondering if I'm - do you think, I mean -\" Something about his stuttering reminded Maverick of Ned-Naderman-the-divorce-attorney and he chuckled. Harvey looked slightly stricken. \"I'm sorry, please continue, Lieutenant,\" Maverick said. Iceman's hand was no longer on the desk, but had moved to his hip. That meant trouble. Maverick stared intently at Harvey in an attempt to move the conversation along. \"I just... do you really think I'm cut out for this?\" he burst out desperately. \"Cut out for -\" Maverick was puzzled. \"You wouldn't be here if you weren't.\" \"You really think so?\" Harvey looked immensely relieved. \"You've got talent,\" Maverick said. \"It's just a matter of -\" Jester closed the space between himself and Iceman. \"- confidence,\" Maverick said as he walked away. \"Thank you, sir,\" Harvey called out. The door closed behind him and the double gaze of Iceman and Jester hit him like a pillowcase full of bricks. \"Afternoon,\" Maverick said sharply. \"Afternoon,\" said Iceman in an odd tone. \"Heatherly and I were just discussing -\" \"Things,\" Jester said, and his eyes darted between them. Iceman sat. A muscle in his jaw twitched. \"Of course,\" Maverick said. Iceman's hand closed around a pen. \"I was just saying to Kazansky - it may not be wise -\" Iceman leapt cat-like out of his seat and grabbed Jester by the collar. He was surprisingly agile for a guy of forty. \"Listen, Heatherly. I keep to myself. I don't go around opening my mouth -\" he shot a look at Maverick \"- and I don't see any reason for you to be coming into my office like this -\" \"I'm just giving you the facts, Kazansky,\" Jester said, but he suddenly looked uneasy. \"Well,\" Iceman replied, and released him. \"I'll be seeing the both of you,\" Jester said, nodding curtly at Maverick as he left. \"Like I do go around opening my mouth?\" he snapped, as soon as the office door had shut. Iceman shook his head and smiled slightly. He walked over to Maverick and closed the blinds behind him. \"You want to go sailing with me, say, maybe a week from now?\" \"Sailing?\" Maverick replied. \"My uncle left me a boat when he died,\" Iceman said. \"A little twenty-five footer. Keep it in the San Diego marina. I went out the other day and cleared away all the seaweed and shit, got it running again. You want to?\" \"Is it a date?\" Maverick blurted out. Iceman smirked. \"No more a date than your little -\" \"I don't - Christ, that wasn't a date, I told you -\" \"Don't get all excited, Mitchell. I was just asking.\" \"Yeah, sure,\" Maverick said. \"I - sure.\" Iceman rolled up his sleeves. \"Thursday good?\" \"I don't have a class.\" \"That's why I asked.\" Maverick nodded and made a move toward the door. \"I wouldn't worry about Heatherly,\" Iceman said. \"He was a little riled. Seems you called him some, uh, unpleasant names.\" Maverick made a non-committal noise. \"But I calmed him down.\" \"Okay.\" \"You're welcome.\" \"Thank you.\" Iceman grinned. \"Bring a case of beer with you. And none of that light shit. The good stuff.\" Maverick nodded again, and slipped out of the office. x A/N: How many boat shenanigans next chapter? SO MANY BOAT SHENANIGANS.[Chapter 13] June 25, 1998. San Diego Marina. San Diego, California. Maverick didn't like the ocean a whole lot. He tried to - hell, you join the Navy, you live in California for twelve years, you're gonna try, right? He'd just always liked the air better. He passed by a little ship chandler on his way to he found Iceman, tugging on some rigging, shirtless and ripped. Maverick had a little niggle of insecurity. Sure, he worked out, and he looked damn good for his age, but he had spent the majority of his time lately behind a desk. And Iceman had - actually, who knew what the fuck Iceman had been doing all those years, but it probably didn't even involve a desk. \"Hey,\" Maverick called. Iceman looked up, gave him a little sarcastic salute, tossed a rope across the nearest cleat and pulled the boat closer. Maverick stumbled on. \"Impressive sea legs,\" Iceman said dryly. \"Fuck off,\" Maverick said, swaying. \"I'm fine on aircraft carriers, okay? It's little - dinky... these kind of things I don't like. Here's your beer.\" \"Bud Light?\" \"If you don't like it -\" Maverick stood up. \"Don't drink it.\" \"Watch out for the boom,\" Iceman said, cracking the top off of one on the side of the boat, taking a swig, and making a face. The boom swung toward Maverick's head idly, and he ducked. \"See, you're lucky, Thumbelina,\" Iceman said. \"I have to hit the deck every time it comes by.\" \"We going?\" Maverick replied. Iceman nodded affably. \"You know, you look... well, like shit, to be honest.\" \"Go take a hike in a fucking lake.\" This raised Maverick's hackles because it hit a nerve recently exposed by his doctor - who, upon noting his dark circles and generally harried appearance, compounded with his blood pressure - apparently in the same range as that of a five-hundred pound chain-smoking lumberjack who subsisted solely on waffles and NSAID pain relievers - had suggested he see a shrink. Maverick had said no, in not entirely polite terms. His doctor had simply smiled and said, \"Many people, during divorces, find themselves seeking an unbiased third party to unload their concerns onto.\" \"I don't need to unload anything,\" Maverick had replied. \"You're very stressed.\" \"I tend to get stressed when people tell me I need to see a shrink.\" The doctor had thrown his hands in the air in surrender. \"Fine. Just my professional opinion.\" \"You tracking, Mitchell?\" \"Yeah,\" Maverick said, snapping back to reality. Iceman twiddled the tiller. \"So how's your kid?\" \"He's doing all right,\" Maverick said. \"Staying with, um, Charlie now.\" He fiddled with a length of rope lying next to him. \"I think it's probably better that way.\" Iceman smiled. It didn't reach his eyes. He leaned back, laced his fingers, and slid them behind his head. \"You really believe that?\" \"I've been busy lately,\" Maverick said. It sounded bullshit even to him. \"You giving up on your own son, then?\" Iceman said. \"Christ,\" Maverick replied. \"I never said that.\" \"Sounds like it.\" \"It's not,\" Maverick snapped. Iceman tilted his head. Maverick sighed. \"It's very hard for me to fight Charlie,\" he said finally. \"I'd imagine,\" Iceman said. \"Don't mock me.\" Iceman rolled his eyes. \"Can we change the subject?\" \"Who'd you vote for?\" \"Nader.\" Iceman raised his eyebrows. Maverick took a sip of his beer. \"I would have gone for Dole, but I mean, Nader wrote that book about seat belts.\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"You?\" \"Clinton.\" \"Maybe we shouldn't talk politics,\" Maverick said. x After a few beers each, they were pretty tipsy, and opening up to each other on all manner of subjects. \"I'm afraid of clowns,\" Iceman said. Maverick cracked up. \"Yeah?\" \"They make me uncomfortable.\" \"Who likes clowns?\" Iceman shook his head. \"Strange people.\" \"When I was eleven,\" Maverick said, \"I had a crush on Nancy Drew.\" Iceman laughed. \"I thought her boyfriend was a huge tool.\" Iceman tossed an empty beer bottle to the side. \"Couple of years ago we'd been stationed in the same place for about six months and I got horny and fucked this little twenty-two year old ensign who'd been hitting on me all day,\" he said, making an inappropriate hand gesture. \"He cried afterwards. No idea why. I just stood there.\" \"Christ.\" \"Yeah.\" Maverick stood up and wandered around the sailboat. \"Guess what I heard on the radio on the way over?\" He didn't wait for Iceman to guess. \"You've Lost That Loving Feeling. The Elvis version.\" Iceman chuckled. \"I remember you singing that.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Yeah. Don't quit your day job.\" \"Fuck you,\" was Maverick's reply. \"I'd like to see you sing.\" \"I can sing just fine, Maverick ,\" Iceman said, looking very smug all of a sudden. \"Bullshit.\" \"Watch out for the boom,\" Iceman reminded him. Maverick got hit in the head with the boom. x When Maverick came to and Iceman had ascertained that he remembered his name, the present year, and who had won the last World Series, Maverick suggested they maybe head back. Iceman was silently tugging on ropes and pulleys, absorbed in what he was doing, and Maverick watched him, occasionally rubbing at the red mark on his forehead. They docked and walked back to the parking lot together as Iceman pulled a shirt on. \"You hear that?\" Iceman shook his head. Maverick opened his door and started digging around in his glove compartment. \"It's -\" he pulled out a big black brick of a cell phone and jerked the antennae up. \"Hello?\" Iceman drummed his fingers on the car. \"Commander,\" Jester said. \"I have some bad news.\" \"Okay, shoot.\" \"You know Jameson? Nice kid from Alabama, callsign Bulldog, Snowflake's RIO.\" \"Yeah. Yeah. What about him?\" \"There was an accident this afternoon.\" Maverick sucked in a breath. Iceman's fingers stopped drumming and he mouthed \"what?\" \"You all right?\" \"What happened?\" Jester hesitated. \"Just tell me. Jesus!\" \"Pilot error. Padgett made a mistake and they went into a irretrievable spin during a dive. Plane crashed into the bottom of the canyon. They ejected, but Jameson's hurt. Bad. They airlifted him to a hospital in Chicago. Where the hell have you been?\" \"Uh -\" \"Never mind, just get your ass in here. Where's Kazansky?\" \"How the hell should I know?\" Jester snorted. \"I'll let him know what happened.\" \"We're gonna get bad press on this, Mitchell, this is our sixth fatality in three years -\" \"Fatality? What fatality? The kid's not dead.\" Not like Goose . \"I'll be there in less than an hour.\" He hung up. \"Jameson and Padgett went into a fl - a spin -\" Maverick pressed his hand to his mouth. \"Jameson's in bad shape. We need to do damage control.\" Iceman nodded. \"I'll see you back at TOPGUN, then?\" \"I'll race you,\" Maverick said. It was a weak joke, considering the circumstances. Iceman checked his watch as he walked away. x A/N: Fixed a boo-boo in the very first chapter - I referred to both Iceman and Maverick as Lieutenant Commanders. They are actually Commanders, as I've referred to them in all other chapters. Jester is a Lieutenant Commander. Also, Kamel is now my preferred ship name for Iceman and Maverick (Kazansky/Mitchell).[Chapter 14] June 27, 1998. United States Navy Fighter Weapons School, Miramar, California. When they had arrived at TOPGUN there was nothing much to do but check up on Jameson every five minutes - he was still in critical condition - and call every single last one of his family members in Alabama and offer information and condolences. They had sent everyone home and canceled classes and hops for the next few days as a gesture of goodwill - Jester's idea. The press were circling like wolves. Maverick came into the office a few days later to get started on the mountain of paperwork building up on his desk. They had to schedule a court martial for Padgett and report all pertinent information to the government. \"Call for you from Commander Mike Metcalf on line two, sir,\" his aide told him. \"Who the hell's on line one? Never mind - hello?\" \"Afternoon, kid.\" \"Afternoon, Viper.\" Maverick wondered how old he'd have to be before Viper stopped calling him \"kid\" and \"son\". Probably eighty. \"Heard about the Jameson kid. Bound to be shitty publicity.\" \"Makes you glad you retired, right?\" Viper laughed. \"Damn straight.\" \"You know who's back?\" \"Iceman? Yeah, I heard. He was a good kid in his day. Hell of a pilot. Sure he's a hell of an instructor, too.\" \"Of course,\" Maverick said, a little bitterly. No one had expected him to be a hell of an instructor. He'd had to prove it. Still had to prove it. \"Commander? Lieutenant Padgett would like to see you. Also, I have Iceman.\" Maverick clicked and unclicked a pen as he nodded. \"Listen, Metcalf, can I get back to you?\" \"Fine with me. Good luck,\" Viper said, a trace of irony in his voice, and Maverick hung up. \"Send 'em in.\" Harvey walked in, eyes fixed on his feet, paler than ever. When he was standing in front of Maverick's desk he drew himself up and saluted. \"Sit,\" Maverick told him. The door swung again and Iceman appeared. He hadn't shaved recently, and there was an attractive smattering of dark blond stubble across his jaw. Maverick felt his cock twitch and shifted uncomfortably under the desk. \"Lieutenant Padgett would like to discuss with you his future here at TOPGUN,\" Iceman said softly. He sounded tired, and avoided Maverick's eyes. \"I'm quitting,\" Harvey said. He looked like he'd been crying. \"I'm packing my bags and I'm going home.\" \"Can I get two cups of coffee?\" Maverick said, buzzing his aide. Iceman mouthed no thank you . \"Make that one cup of coffee. Thanks.\" He turned back to Harvey. \"Listen.\" Harvey shook his head. \"I made up my mind. I've already talked to Commander Kazansky about it. There's no reason for me to stay. Even if I'm cleared for flying. I messed up. I almost killed a guy. I don't deserve to be here.\" \"In the future,\" Maverick said to Iceman, \"I'd appreciate it if you didn't give my students unsolicited advice before I get the chance to talk to them.\" A tiny smile graced his lips. \" Your students.\" \"My students,\" Maverick repeated defiantly. \"It's Snowflake's decision.\" Maverick flashed his eyes at Iceman in an unspoken message of back me up on this, goddamnit and Iceman relented, leaning comfortably against the door. \"He didn't tell me to quit, sir,\" Harvey said. \"He just gave me the facts.\" Of course. \"I'd strongly advise not leaving the TOPGUN academy until your court martial is over,\" Maverick told him. \"I can't stay here, sir.\" \"Enough with the sir ,\" Maverick said. Harvey bit his lip. \"If you're asking me to stay as my superior officer -\" \"I'm asking you to stay as someone who's been in your position.\" The meaning of this largely escaped Harvey, but he replied, \"I'm not like you, sir.\" Iceman rolled his eyes. \"You're more like me than you think,\" Maverick said. \"Dismissed.\" Harvey nodded and departed. \"The fuck was that?\" Maverick demanded, jumping to his feet. \"This is nothing like Goose,\" Iceman told him. \"This was no freak accident, Mitchell, this was pilot error, this was a dumbass, completely avoidable mistake. And he -\" Maverick tried to interrupt and Iceman plowed right through him. \"He'll most likely be charged with involuntary manslaughter -\" \"Jameson's not dead.\" Iceman dismissed this with a flick of his wrist. \"Dishonorable discharge -\" \"You don't know that -\" \"It's a foregone goddamn conclusion.\" \"Why is the idea of someone making a fucking mistake so threatening to you?\" Iceman's face hardened. They glared at each other for a moment. \"I need some air,\" Maverick said, pushing past him.[Chapter 15] June 28, 1998. Miramar, California. Maverick rolled to a stop in front of his house, glanced at his front yard, and immediately slammed on the gas again. When he was safely down the block somewhat he took another look. Four - no, five reporters in his yard. And a van. He squinted. The San Diego Sun. The fuck? He called Iceman. \"The press is in my front yard.\" \"Afternoon, Mitchell.\" Maverick rubbed his forehead. \"Sorry for the other day.\" There was a pause. \"Fine. What was that about the press?\" \"They're in my goddamn front yard!\" \"Don't talk to them.\" \"No shit .\" \"Did they see you?\" \"No, I don't think so.\" \"Good.\" \"Why?\" \"'Could not be reached for comment' sounds better than 'no comment'. 'No comment' makes you sound like a feckless moron.\" \"'Could not be reached' makes it sound like I'm passed out drunk in an alley somewhere. Where the hell am I supposed to go?\" \"Come by my place.\" Maverick drummed his fingers on the dashboard. \"Or you could go talk to the reporters.\" Iceman's smirk was audible over the phone. \"There wasn't any press coverage when Goose died. Christ.\" \"Welcome to the nineties.\" \"I'll be there in ten minutes.\" x \"I need to make a few phone calls,\" Maverick said. \"Uh - LC Russ Anderson, my attorney, and Charlie - you have any booze?\" \"Jim Beam in the cabinet,\" Iceman said. \"I'd cut it with something. What was that about Anderson?\" \"He's basically our Navy liaison,\" Maverick said. \"I'm aware of that.\" \"He told me to call him.\" Maverick poured a Sprite into a glass and then added a liberal amount of ice and bourbon. Iceman watched him and let out a sigh that tailed off into a quiet \" shit \". \"What?\" \"He thinks the Navy's gonna be looking to shut down the program,\" Iceman said quietly. Maverick nearly dumped bourbon all over the floor. \"What?\" \"It's been brought up a few times this past week.\" \"Behind my back?\" Maverick demanded. \"Not intentionally,\" Iceman said, voice soft, cutting a dark figure in the doorway. \"Not intentionally?\" Maverick repeated, slamming the glass down on the counter. \"Not intentionally ?\" \"Call Anderson.\" Iceman was in a state of maddening calm. \"I will fucking call him, thanks.\" \"Maverick, you're overreacting. There's no grounds to shut us down -\" \"Other than five fatalities and three near-fatalities in the span of a few years? And all of those, Iceman , were pilot error or malfunctioning equipment -\" Iceman disappeared and returned with a phone. Maverick sat down and dialed Anderson. \"Hello?\" \"Commander Mitchell here.\" \"Put it on speaker,\" Iceman said, sitting down. Maverick obliged. \"Oh, hey. Listen, I'm a little swamped -\" \"Is the government shutting down TOPGUN?\" Anderson stammered briefly. \"Well -\" \"I'd like a straight answer.\" \"It's not so much that,\" said Anderson carefully, \"as... Well, we're becoming a bit of a liability. I mean, you know as well as I do that the face of aerial combat is changing. They've been pouring money into this program for years and we've been turning out some of the best fighter pilots that the country has seen in recent history. But now, with UAVs becoming more and more common, they're using the casualties - sick as it is - as a, maybe, a bit of an excuse to say, hey, we're draining taxpayer dollars to fund TOPGUN, and look, they're fucking up, excuse my French. It's not - I'm not worried about it, per se, but it's something we should take notice of. And we've got that pending litigation going, so, y'know, just another thing for Clinton to pick at if they come gunning for us. It's a numbers game, at the end of the day.\" \"Why didn't I hear about this until now?\" \"I'm not sure, Commander. You know I try to communicate with everyone. It might be -\" Anderson hesitated. \"Well, you've been under a lot of stress lately -\" \"Fine,\" Maverick snapped. \"I'll talk to you later.\" He hung up. Iceman brought over a box of cookies, nudged them toward Maverick, and took one. \"I can't fucking believe this. My entire career .\" Iceman put a hand up. \"Did he say directly that the government is considering shutting the program down?\" \"No, you heard him, he skated around it -\" \"Exactly,\" Iceman said, brushing crumbs off his hands. Maverick ran his hands through his hair and moaned. \"Jesus fucking Christ .\" There was a stretch of silence. Iceman was burning through cookies like they were breath mints. Maverick wondered if he was more concerned than he let on. More than likely, since Iceman didn't let on about much. \"Twelve years of my life,\" Maverick said. \"Twelve fucking years. My career and my marriage, down the shitter.\" Iceman tilted his head at Maverick. \"You should lay off the cookies,\" Maverick said. Iceman smiled, got up, and leaned over. He pulled Maverick into a kiss, sending shockwaves and stabs of heat straight to his dick that did not pass go or collect two hundred dollars. Iceman's lips tasted like warm chocolate, and his body was soft and welcoming. Maverick pulled him closer, but Iceman stepped back. \"You can sleep here tonight, if you need to,\" Iceman said, his body language suddenly hard to read, hand still on Maverick's shoulder. Maverick nodded. \"I still have to call Charlie,\" he murmured. Their eyes locked. Iceman nodded and left the room. Maverick stared at the tabletop.[Chapter 16] June 29, 1998. Miramar, California. Maverick woke up with a dull throbbing ache behind his eyes. He rolled over, fell onto the floor, and groaned. When he managed to get up, he pinched his temples and staggered to the kitchen. Iceman, fully dressed, shaved, and coiffed, was reading the newspaper. \"Jesus,\" Maverick said. Iceman glanced at him. \"Sports section,\" Maverick said, holding a hand out. \"Also, phone.\" \"Your face is puffy,\" Iceman said. \"I slept on your couch. I have dust allergies,\" lied Maverick, who had, in fact, woken up crying in the wee hours of the morning. \"Phone?\" Iceman handed him the phone. Maverick, after some hesitation, dialed Carol, because he wasn't sure where Charlie was, or if she'd want to talk to him. \"Hey there, who's this?\" \"Carol? It's Pete.\" \"Honey! Oh, it is so good to hear from you.\" \"I wasn't sure -\" \"I heard everything from Charlotte. I can't believe you kids couldn't work it out. You were so good together, hon.\" She let out a long, despairing sigh. \"But if you need anything from me, if you need someone to look after Nick, or anything, I'm here. God, I love that kid.\" Maverick grinned. \"Thanks, Carol. Appreciate it.\" \"Have you heard from Scott? You need to talk some sense into him, Mav. You know he wants to move to Hollywood and get into show biz? I thought for years he'd go into the Navy and the other day he drops this bomb on me that he wants to be an actor , of all things.\" Maverick drummed his fingers on the table. \"I'll have lunch with him or something.\" \"You better, sweetheart! He wants the glamorous life, then tell him how glamorous it is being a fighter pilot. Tell him he'll have women throwing themselves at him.\" Maverick chuckled. \"Okay, Carol.\" \"Talk to you later, Pete. And listen, I'm so sorry about you and Charlie. Maybe it's for the best, hon.\" \"Maybe,\" Maverick said, and hung up. \"Lunch with who?\" Iceman said, as he folded the newspaper up. \"Shit, I forgot to ask her for Charlie's number.\" Iceman winced. \"What?\" Iceman shook his head. \"Can I get a ride?\" Maverick stood up and started wandering around in search of yesterday's clothes. Iceman smiled wryly and stood up, ambling over to Maverick. His thumbs slipped into Maverick's belt-loops and he stared unflinchingly at him. Maverick's eyes searched Iceman's face. Laugh lines, scowl lines, squint lines. Iceman kissed him, and this time, it wasn't a gentle brushing of mouths or a suggestion. There was raw power behind it. His lips skidded down Maverick's jaw and over his neck, teasing the skin with his teeth, not hard enough to leave a mark. Maverick moaned and seized him by the wrists, pushing Iceman's hands down over his own shoulders. Iceman shoved Maverick to his knees and Maverick's hand groped up his thigh, soft skin underneath his hands. Iceman spoke and Maverick heard it as distant radio fuzz - this is Bravo, come in, how copy? - but then Iceman was pulling him to his feet. \"Wait, lemme -\" he was still fondling Iceman's fly, tugging at the zipper. Iceman's hands curled around Maverick's and with what looked like a great amount of effort, he pushed them away. \"We need to take off,\" Iceman said, not making eye contact. Maverick wanted to punch him. \"Great. I'll spend the rest of the day with blue balls because you have some hang-up about my wife - my ex-wife -\" \"Shove it up your ass,\" Iceman told him. Maverick jerked back. \"I don't need armchair psychiatry. I just want to get out of here in a timely fashion.\" Iceman sucked in a breath. \"Okay?\" Maverick's teeth clenched. \"Fine.\" June 29, 1998. United States Navy Fighter Weapons School, Miramar, California. \"You've got mail!\" The latest was from hillarywhalley at TOPGUNdotgov. Maverick's eyebrows knit. FWD : (no subject) Got this from Russ about an hour before you came in, Commander. Iceman mentioned you were concerned about being left out of the loop, and should take a look at it. - Hillary Begin forwarded message: From : Date : June 29, 1998 9:24:27 AM GMT To : ctkazanskyatTOPGUNdotgov, lcrheatherlyatTOPGUNdotgov, lcswellsatTOPGUNdotgov, cjswansonatTOPGUNdotgov... (click to see more) To whom it may concern, As we're all aware, Lieutenant Harvey Padgett's hearing is tomorrow. If he's found guilty, we might be facing litigation. We already have a case against TOPGUN pending and the JAG Corps investigating heavily, so this is not the ideal situation... I have taken the time to talk to various government officials about what this will mean for the future of TOPGUN and we have a few folks from Washington coming down on Thursday to discuss what direction the program might be heading in. The fact that a boy was nearly killed in a routine training exercise is not something the Navy is viewing kindly, and it does not portray us in the best light. With what's been going on in Korea/China recently we may very well be facing another war, and the Clinton administration is not going to want to pour tax dollars into a defunct program. On the subject of Commander Mitchell we might want to keep him a little separated from the action on Thursday. I am not suggesting that information be kept purposefully from him, but he has been, effectively, the face of TOPGUN for the last decade and lately he's been a little off. I heard about his divorce and I have nothing but sympathy for him, but we want this situation to be as sanitized as possible and he has a reputation for being unpredictable. Other than that, we may want to send someone down to Alabama as a gesture of goodwill and to clear up some of this bad press we've been getting recently. Thanks, Lieutenant Commander Russ Anderson x \"That little prick!\" Maverick yelled, standing up and kicking his desk as hard as he possibly could. Iceman chose that moment to walk in, and observed Maverick clutching his foot in pain with mild detachment. \"Thanks for letting me know,\" Maverick snarled at him. \"You're welcome,\" Iceman replied, taking a seat. \"I've been flying since before this kid had pubes, Tom! Where the fuck does he get off?\" Iceman put a hand up. \"Don't -\" \"Listen,\" Iceman said. \"This is a business. The whole military is a business. Anderson doesn't make any money unless he's busting balls.\" \"I've been in this business for twenty years, so you can take your patronizing -\" \"I'm not patro -\" \"- bullshit -\" \" Listen .\" Iceman cleared his throat. \"He happens to be busting your balls at the moment, and you're not the type of guy that takes that very well.\" \"Not everyone is emotionally constipated, Kazansky.\" Iceman laughed. \"What?\" \"I'm gonna go get some coffee,\" Iceman told him, getting up. x A/N: I thought I was all cool with my email addresses and then ffnet was like LOLNO, so excuse the crappy workaround.[Chapter 17] June 30, 1998. Miramar, California. \"Hello?\" \"Afternoon,\" said Charlie. Maverick's teeth gritted. \"Yes?\" \"I just wanted to discuss a few things with you,\" Charlie said, voice light and pleasant. \"Carol mentioned you didn't have my number, I'm sorry about that, I know you were probably worried about Nick...\" All of the saccharine civility was setting off alarms. \"Shoot,\" Maverick said warily. \"I was talking to Beverly, and I mentioned... well, he said that I might want to file for divorce on grounds of adultery, instead of irreconcilable differences.\" There was a sharp pain in Maverick's chest. \"What? I'm not - I never cheated on you -\" \"You told me specifically that you did, Maverick, remember?\" He splayed his hand out on the kitchen table and took a deep breath. \"California's a no-fault divorce state -\" \"We'll just see how it plays out in court.\" \"You know what?\" Maverick yelled into the phone, temper snapping. \"I fucking did! I cheated on you, and I'm still cheating on you, and I'm the happiest I've been in years! Tell Beverly he can shove it up his ass!\" Silence. \"Great,\" Charlie said. The mask of pleasantry still hadn't slipped. \"I'm very happy to know, Pete, that you threw away your entire family just to get your rocks off with a washed-up, glorified airline pilot. I'm sure my attorney will be, too.\" \"It takes two,\" Maverick snarled. \"Don't try to pin this on me. I went to counseling, I put in the work, it's not my fault you're an immature crybaby who's so afraid of other people's expectations that -\" \"And it's not my fault you're a psychopathic, ball-busting ice queen -\" \" Please -\" \"Yeah? Please? Who made me give up my motorcycle, who made me feel like shit for years because your career had to be put on hold -\" Click. Maverick threw the phone. It hit the refrigerator and shattered, pieces of plastic and batteries flying everywhere. He grabbed an old softball bat and a few balls out of the foyer closet, and headed for the backyard. x Wumph. The softball bounced off of the window and rolled quietly into the bushes. Maverick's arm rose again, a second ball leaping out of his fingers, and then he drew back and smashed it away from him as hard as he could. Wumph. His fingers burned. The gate creaked, and there were footsteps and a crunching noise on the dry grass. The bat came back again. Iceman caught the ball in midair. \"It's all your goddamn fault,\" Maverick snarled, and he hit another one. It bounced off of the fence. \"What?\" Iceman said, taciturn as always. He walked forward cautiously, like Maverick was an escaped rhinoceros on a midday rampage. \"My marriage,\" Maverick said, choking back tears. He flung the bat at Iceman and it hit him square in the chest. Iceman closed the space between them. Maverick rocked back on his heels but Iceman grabbed him by the shirt. \"You told me your marriage was already over,\" Iceman murmured. Maverick made a choked noise. \"Was that a lie?\" \"No.\" \"Then I don't want to hear it,\" Iceman said. \"So why are you hanging around here?\" Iceman gave him a dour look. \"I'll tell you one thing, Mitchell, I'm not here to deal with your overemotional bullshit. I came to tell you that Padgett's been discharged.\" \"What?\" \"That was the decision, as of fifteen hundred hours this afternoon.\" \"But -\" Maverick sat down on the deck. \"Christ. Dishonorable?\" Iceman nodded. \"Let's go for a walk,\" he said, hand resting on his hip, thousand-mile stare fixed somewhere above Maverick's head. \"What about Jameson?\" \"Last night's surgery went well. He's responsive.\" \"Great.\" Maverick stood up. x Maverick and Charlie had chosen their house primarily because of location, location, location. It sat on a sloping hill not too far from the beach - Viper was only a ten-minute walk away - and the neighborhood itself was rimmed with palm trees. The ideal place for raising a family. Supposedly. The two of them walked down to the shoreline in silence and fell into a comfortable, side-by-side stroll. Teenagers cruised by on surfboards, yelling incoherently. \"Are you gay?\" Maverick blurted out. Iceman stopped. Maverick faced him and shifted his weight back and forth, seesawing. \"I mean -\" \"I sleep with who's interested,\" Iceman said. His voice was even, but his lips curved up slightly in a big bad wolf smile. \"I keep up appearances.\" Maverick nodded. He knew all too well how that went. \"Are you?\" Iceman shot back, sliding his sunglasses into his breast pocket. Maverick sat down on the sand and stared into the distance. After a moment Iceman settled beside him, not too close. A blonde girl in a bright pink bathing suit fell off of her board halfway into a wave. They both watched as she climbed back on, shaking her hair out of her eyes and laughing. \"I'm not anything,\" Maverick said, dropping his gaze to his hands and fiddling with his wristwatch. \"I -\" he brushed his hair out of his eyes. \"I'm not anybody. I'm the person everyone thinks I am. A lot of times I've had - urges -\" he broke off. \"Urges,\" Iceman repeated, and he pulled his shirt off slowly, tossing it into the sand beside him and lying back. Two college-age girls walking by giggled and waved as they passed. Iceman smirked indulgently at Maverick. \"Yeah, urges,\" Maverick snapped. \"What, you don't get those? You're a fucking robot?\" Their eyes locked. \"I get plenty.\" A shiver ran down Maverick's spine. He looked away, but began unbuttoning his shirt, and pulled it over his head. \"Charlie's going to wind up giving me a heart attack,\" he muttered. There was a beat, then Iceman said, \"You wouldn't feel a little gypped, if you were her?\" \"'Scuse me?\" \"Think about it, Mitchell,\" Iceman said, looking out at the waves. \"What are we? What are you, foremost?\" \"A father,\" Maverick said, confused. \"No,\" Iceman replied. \"You're a fighter pilot. We are the job. At the end of the day, so is she.\" Maverick had nothing to say to that, and they lapsed into silence. x A/N: I'd like to thank everyone who has read and reviewed so far (: All feedback is appreciated, whether I get the chance to respond or not.[Chapter 18] July 1, 1998. Miramar, California. Nick had been left in Maverick's possession while Charlie conducted an interview with someone who had flown out from the Pentagon. \"I would have gotten Sherry,\" she said disparagingly, \"but she had a midterm to study for.\" So Nick wound up wandering around the house curiously, like he hadn't lived there his entire life, leaving Maverick to stare into space and drum his fingers on his thigh. Eventually he came back into the living room and began rummaging through the shoebox of VCR tapes on the floor. Maverick watched idly. \"What's this?\" Nick held up a tape. \"What?\" \"The label wore off.\" \"I think that's, uh...\" Maverick got up. \"The tape from our wedding. See the sticker?\" Nick's brow furrowed in a very Charlie-like way. \"Can I watch it?\" Maverick hesitated. \"Yeah - why not?\" He regretted that as soon as Nick had fast-forwarded to the actual ceremony. There he was, a decade younger, as Charlie glided up the aisle to the soft strains of Mendelssohn. Maverick watched himself fiddle with his collar, look at his feet, and glance surreptitiously at his watch. \"Jeez, Dad,\" Nick muttered. \"What?\" Defensiveness sprang into his voice. \"You look like you're about to crap your pants.\" Maverick lunged for the remote and Nick tossed it to the side. Maverick ripped the extension cord out of the wall and the television went black. \"Let's go play catch.\" \"I don't -\" \"Wasn't a question, Nick.\" Nick didn't move. Maverick nudged him. \"C'mon.\" x Whack. Maverick stumbled out of the way of the ball. Sometimes he wondered if the only things Nick had inherited from him were green eyes and good aim. \"I can tell you're angry,\" Maverick said. \"I'm fine, Dad.\" Maverick lobbed another ball at him. Nick whacked it into Charlie's rosebushes. \"Yeah?\" \"Okay, I just -\" Nick tossed the bat down. \"Why'd you have to mess everything up?\" Maverick's head began to pound. \"Whatever your mother's been telling you -\" \"She didn't tell me anything,\" Nick muttered. \"Pick up the bat.\" Nick stood rooted to the ground. \"Pick up the bat, we're having some goddamn father-son bonding time. You think my father volunteered to play catch with me?\" Maverick's voice cracked. \"I don't know, Dad,\" Nick said. He sounded weary. \"Your pitching stance sucks,\" he muttered. \"Says who?\" Maverick replied, lobbing one overhand. \"My Little League coach. You're not supposed to -\" whack \"- move unless you're doing windup -\" \"I've met your Little League coach, he has his head up his ass.\" Nick rolled his eyes. Gravel crunched as a black Escalade pulled into their driveway. \"Mom,\" Nick said. He held the bat out to Maverick, who took it and strolled over to his soon-to-be-ex-wife. \"Afternoon,\" said Charlie. She was in a dark suit, hair back, looking like she just rolled out of a meeting of Congress. Maverick stared at her. \"You're in heels,\" he said. \"For once,\" Charlie replied crisply. Nick showed up at that moment and Maverick bit back his response. Charlie tapped her finger on the car door and Nick got in, glancing between the two of them. \"Well?\" she demanded. \" Well?\" Maverick shot back, nettled. Charlie sighed. \"Do you have to be so difficult all the time?\" \"Yeah. All the time .\" Charlie rolled her eyes and got in the car. Before she pulled away, she said, \"We're meeting next week to discuss a court date. Don't be late.\" Maverick suddenly felt vaguely queasy. He reached reflexively in his pocket, looking for cigarettes, and came up empty. x July 1, 1998. Excalibur Cigar Lounge and Wine Bar, Miramar, California. Scott was easy to spot. His hair was like Carol's, sandy and wind-strewn, and he was almost as tall as Goose had been. He spotted Maverick, flashed him a grin, and headed over. Maverick seized him in a quick bear hug, and they both sat. \"Glad you could make it,\" Maverick said, taking a sip of his draft beer. Scott flagged the waiter over and ordered a virgin piña colada. \"Yeah, of course,\" Scott replied. \"Sorry I couldn't be at your graduation. I'm, uh, a little -\" Scott waved his hand. \"I didn't go either. I had an audition. Got my diploma in the mail.\" Maverick's hand clenched around his frosted glass. \"So you're serious about this?\" \"Serious as a freakin' heart attack,\" Scott said, beaming. \"And I as good as landed that commercial, my agent says. Speaking of which, I'm paying.\" Maverick shook his head. \"I can't let you -\" \"Pete, you're in the middle of a divorce, the least I can do is pick up a check. I mean, you've been like a father to me the last ten years.\" Maverick was suddenly choked up. \"Thanks.\" He pictured Nick in the distant future telling some guy - maybe Charlie's next husband - you've been like a father to me, and felt like stabbing himself with the butter knife the restaurant had provided. When the pina colada had been delivered and Maverick's beer refilled for the fourth time, he began piecing his disjointed argument together in his head. Don't you want to follow in Goose's footsteps, Carol's disappointed with you, there's no job security in La-La Land, if you want to fly you've got me as an in, I used to be the best goddamn fighter pilot in the Navy - second best... But the more he drank, the more he felt compelled to make small talk instead of accusations. \"You love acting?\" Scott nodded and wiped a tiny bit of whipped cream off his lip. Maverick's eyes caught this and hovered for a minute, locked onto the curve of Scott's mouth. He felt his cheeks redden slightly, and his dick twitched. Maverick took a deep breath and pressed the tines of his fork into his thigh. \"It's not just that,\" Scott said. \"I'm good at it, y'know? I can make people laugh, I can pull off serious stuff, too. I - I could be good.\" \"Do it,\" Maverick said, hearing the slur in his own voice. \"Do what you love, okay? Promise me that.\" Scott's brows met. \"But -\" \"I changed my mind.\" A grin spread across Scott's face. \"Thanks. That means a lot to me, Mav.\" When the waiter had been flagged down, check paid, and Scott had pulled away in his junky little car with an enthusiastic wave, Maverick stood and stared at the pavement. Iceman was weighing on his mind - not Iceman specifically, but the strange newness of him. The way he spooked slightly when a car backfired, the way he favored his right hand and grimaced when he had to tighten screws or reset gauges during pre-flight, the million-mile stare that was no longer a product of callow, disinterested youth, but now something different, and filled with an unspeakable guilt. The way he avoided mirrors, when he had once openly sought them out. Maverick drove home in silence. x A/N: I'm leaving on vacation Saturday for a week, but I'll probably crank out another chapter before then. And there will be sexy shenanigans.[Chapter 19] July 2, 1998. United States Navy Fighter Weapons School, Miramar, California. \"So that's where we are right now.\" Maverick nodded. He was standing next to Iceman on the tarmac, watching the afternoon's class take off as the sun bled out into the violently orange sky. Russ was standing a few feet in front of them, always gesturing, keeping the attention off himself. There was a screech of metal rending metal as one of the jets skidded onto the landing strip, wing taking out a pair of zone lights. Beside him, Iceman twitched compulsively. \"You okay, Tom?\" said Russ. Maverick turned. Iceman was standing there, flight-suited, sweating profusely and looking pale underneath his tan. \"Fine,\" he bit out. His pupils grew larger and larger, crowding the irises out. \"Let's head back, then,\" Russ said, glancing at his watch and walking briskly in the direction of his office. \"You sure?\" Maverick said, when Russ was out of earshot. His hand went for Iceman's shoulder and Iceman knocked it away. Maverick took a step back. \"We should go.\" Iceman nodded. x Russ Anderson's office was a shrine to TOPGUN, or at least a shrine to the mass brainwashing of eighteen-year-old boys and girls across the country. Posters, brochures stacked on his desk. The Navy needs YOU! in bold black print. Jester was there, as well as Merlin, who taught the occasional class when invited. Sitting with his arms folded was Commander Olive Swanson, callsign Eagle. She had taken over manning the control tower for the previous XO, who had retired after spilling one too many coffees on himself. \"Something to - oh, there they are, come in, take a seat, can I get you something? Coffee? No? Tea, maybe? We're discussing the game plan for Thursday.\" Merlin shot Maverick a nervous look and mouthed something that looked like watch out. Maverick leaned over and muttered in Jester's ear, \"Get me a copy of Iceman's file when you have the chance.\" Jester's jaw tensed. \"Done.\" \"Thanks,\" Maverick said, patting him on the back and sitting down. \"Kazansky, coffee?\" Iceman shook his head. \"I was just saying how it concerns me that some of the unconventional methods that Commander Mitchell employs have become, well, canonized, for lack of a better word.\" \"What kind of unconventional methods?\" Maverick snapped. Russ steepled his fingers. Everyone averted their eyes. \"Flybys, dangerous maneuvers, et cetera,\" Russ said, looking less friendly by the second, more Hans Gruber than Ronald McDonald. \"Crashing a thirty-five million dollar plane and killing your RIO-\" \"That was a freak accident,\" Iceman said quietly from the doorway. \"I don't think anyone here appreciates your attempt to deride a commanding officer, Lieutenant.\" Jester cleared his throat. \"Never, sir,\" Russ said. Iceman stepped a little closer. Russ flinched, but all he did was pull a chair out and sit down. Olive lit a cigar. \"I just don't know if it's a good idea to have you represent us in a professional capacity,\" Russ said quietly, looking at his desk. \"So you want me out of the loop,\" Maverick said, leaping out of his seat. \"Something like what you were trying to pull before, but guess what? I'm the fucking base Commander and things like that get around!\" Russ's face was very pink. \"With all due respect, Commander, I feel you've been representing TOPGUN for the past ten years based mostly on good looks and talent, and lately it feels like you're steering this program the way you fly.\" \"I'm a damn good pilot,\" Maverick snarled. \"And if you don't like the way I run things, you're free to seek a position elsewhere.\" \"I don't think so, Commander.\" Maverick stood there, head pounding. Olive's cigar smoke was choking him. Everyone was staring, waiting. \"I'll be right back,\" he said, slipping out of the room. Footsteps followed him down the hallway. Maverick turned around. \"In here,\" Iceman said, tones clipped, pointing at a utility closet. \"That little shit!\" Maverick yelled, when the door was closed behind them. Iceman stood with his back against the door. Maverick's eyes flickered down to his barely concealed hard-on. \"That's sick,\" Maverick said. \"You get off on watching me squirm, Kazansky? You -\" Iceman kissed him, hand was on his ass, groping him with clumsy urgency. He shoved Maverick backward until he was flush up against the wall, grinding into him with vicious intensity. Maverick let out a full-throated moan and his head tipped back against the cement wall behind him. Iceman's lips skimmed his neck, one hand down the pants of Maverick's pleated khakis. He undid the belt and they slipped to the floor. Iceman took hard fistfuls of Maverick's shirt and Maverick pushed back, kicking out at him and nailing him in the crotch. Iceman gasped and Maverick bit him, not even bothering with gentleness, his teeth digging into the skin of Iceman's neck. When he got to the jawline he tasted blood. Iceman winced and let go of Maverick with his right hand while the left kept a steady grip on his collar, knee coming up between his thighs. Maverick could barely think for the brain-splitting boner he was nursing, but Iceman seemed almost detached as he writhed and thrusted, finally resting his forehead against the wall and going still. \"What?\" Maverick panted into his chest. Iceman took a deep breath and untangled himself from Maverick, hands laced through his hair. He sat down on an upturned bucket, eyes wide and bright as he stared into space. \"Sorry,\" he said. His shoulders quaked slightly as he spoke, but his expression didn't change. Maverick cleared his throat. \"What -\" Iceman drummed his finger against his leg. \"- what the hell is going on with you?\" There was a pause. \"You have a notepad or something?\" Iceman said. \"Huh?\" \"Notepad. Get one.\" Maverick started rummaging through the shelves. \"I need a -\" Iceman handed him a pen. \"Okay,\" Maverick said, sitting back down. \"Symptom number one, flashbacks,\" Iceman said. He glanced at Maverick. \"Write that down.\" Maverick complied. \"Frequent nightmares.\" \"How frequent?\" \"Almost nightly.\" Maverick jotted down nightmares - frequent in his sprawling, slanted handwriting. \"Irritability, hypervigilance. Got that?\" \"Yeah.\" Iceman stood up and ran his hands through his hair, looking strangely composed, under the circumstances. After a moment he said, voice flat, \"Sounds like post-traumatic stress.\" The notepad hung limply from Maverick's sweaty palm. His erection was still pulsing uncomfortably. \"Why don't you book something with a -\" he said. \"Let's get something straight,\" Iceman interrupted. He held his hand out and Maverick gave him the pad, and then the pen, which he tucked into his breast pocket. \"We're not gonna sit here and have a heart-to-heart. \" He ran his thumb over the metal spirals. \"If there's one policy I've tried to keep during the course of my career, it's that I don't shit where I eat.\" There was silence. Maverick pinched the bridge of his nose. \"You don't want me involved?\" \"Everything's so goddamn personal to you, Mitchell. You wouldn't let Padgett quit, and he wasn't fit to be here, we all saw it.\" \"I care ,\" Maverick replied, hotly. \"You don't, fine, you want to play the stoic asshole, whatever. But I care. \" \"I'm not yours to care about.\" That stung. \"Let's go.\" Iceman's hand was on the doorknob. \"So you're not gonna do a damn thing about it. You're unbelievable, you know that, Kazansky? What the fuck is this list for, then? You know what's going on here! Like this never happened to anyone before, like this is something new? Something embarrassing? You're a war veteran, Tom, for fuck's sake! You're just as wounded as somebody who got their leg blown off -\" Maverick was practically spitting with anger. \"You've been sitting here in an office for twelve years,\" Iceman said. His eyes were cold, empty, unfocused. \"You don't know.\" \"I know more than you think.\" Iceman gritted his teeth. \"Sorry about your blue balls.\" And he left Maverick standing there in the closet, staring at the door.[Chapter 20] July 3, 1998. United States Navy Fighter Weapons School, Miramar, California. \"Commander,\" Russ greeted. \"Good of you to join us.\" Maverick nodded. Iceman, Jester, Russ, and two strangers in suits with American flag pins on their lapels were sitting at a round table in the largest hangar. Rain was coming down in turrets outside, giving a soft edge to everyone's words. \"This is Bob Moriarty, executive assistant to the Secretary of Defense, and Bill Parcells, adviser to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff over at the Pentagon.\" Maverick shook both of their hands in turn. Typical forgettable government-issue schmucks, both with pasty faces and mousy-brown hair. He sat and shot a look at Iceman, who ignored him. \"I got that file you wanted,\" Jester muttered. \"Thanks.\" \"You're not gonna like it,\" Jester replied, cryptically. \"We've just been discussing this... Padgett,\" Bob said, making a few notes on a clipboard he had. \"Dropped the ball a little, there,\" Bill said, chuckling. Jester's leg was bouncing nervously under the table. Bob held up a hand. \"Commander, is it true that on two separate occasions, Lieutenant Harvey Padgett told you that he did not find himself fit to continue his training at TOPGUN, and both times you dismissed these concerns?\" \"Yes, b -\" \"Were you present the day of the incident?\" \"No.\" \"You didn't take the hop?\" \"No.\" \"Did you speak to Padgett immediately prior to the incident?\" \"Am I on trial, here?\" Maverick demanded. \"No, sir ,\" Russ said, smiling. Maverick fought the urge to throttle him. \"How much do you make, Commander? One ten, one fifteen?\" \"One twenty-five.\" \"Is that outside your pay grade?\" \"Yes.\" \"By how much?\" Maverick gritted his teeth. \"Five thousand.\" Bill wrote that down. \"Padgett came to me, too,\" Jester said, clearing his throat. Bob paused. \"I didn't think anything of it. If a kid is here, we take for granted they're the best of the best and that they're damn well aware of it. This was unexpected, and we weren't equipped to handle it.\" \"You have had other incidents, even fatalities, in recent years.\" Russ broke in. \"We're just concerned -\" \"Who's we?\" Maverick snapped. \"Remember, Commander, no one's attacking you,\" Bob said sharply. \"- that in these times of uncertainty... Commander Kazansky, you've been in a war zone, you understand -\" Iceman drew himself up, and a hush fell over the table. \"Excuse me?\" Bob and Bill exchanged a look. \"Oh, sir, I - I didn't intend -\" Russ's floundering was met with a cold stare. \"Anyway,\" Bob broke in. \"As Anderson said - we're just concerned.\" \"Taxpayer dollars, Commander, taxpayer dollars,\" said Bill. \"We'll be in touch,\" Bob added, getting up and shuffling his papers into a pile. \"Soon.\" Bill nodded, and the two of them headed out into the rain. \"You're setting me up? You're fucking setting me up?\" Maverick screamed at Russ, leaping to his feet. \"Lower your voice, Commander,\" Jester said quietly. \"I'm not doing anything of the sort,\" Russ replied. Maverick lunged across the table and Russ staggered backward, genuine fear flashing in his eyes. \"Jesus Christ ,\" he spat at Jester. \"Put a leash on your dachshund, would you?\" This time it took the combined weight of Jester and Iceman to restrain Maverick, who hollered obscenities in Russ's general direction as he left the hangar. \"You can't pull this kind of thing anymore, Maverick, you're under scrutiny, you might as well say goodbye to your career if you're going to keep up this bullshit...\" Jester sighed. \"I don't care,\" Maverick panted, wrenching out of their grasps. \"I... I don't - care. I'll see you tomorrow, okay, I'll see you two tomorrow.\" Iceman seemed caught between sympathy and disgust. \"Mitchell -\" Maverick shoved past him on his way out. July 3, 1998. Triple R Tattoo Co, Miramar, California. \"That's it? Just a little heart?\" \"Yeah, that's it.\" \"Huh. You know, you're the first guy I've had ask for one of those,\" the tattoo artist said, pushing up her sleeves. Her name tag said Amy and she was pierced and tatted to hell and back, with hot pink hair and an eagle inked across her breastbone. Maverick had staggered drunk around the streets of downtown Miramar - in the pouring rain, wearing only his dress whites - for about an hour, until he spotted the flashing neon lights: TATS, OPEN ALL NIGHT, and decided to cash in on a teenage fantasy. \"I like the uniform. You Army?\" \"Navy.\" \"Ah, yeah. Here, lemme just sterilize these real quick... You're sure you don't want anything bigger? Maybe a rose on your shoulder, bring out your eyes? You got great eyes, y'know, real intense. You seem like an intense guy.\" \"Just the heart,\" Maverick said quietly. \"How much?\" \"Does it hurt, or does it cost?\" \"Both.\" \"Not that much, for a tat this small, and, uh... twenty bucks. You're sure you're not drunk? I don't serve drunks. I get too many of 'em from that bar nearby, they come back and want to sue me or something because they woke up the next morning with somebody's name on their ass.\" \"I only had one beer,\" Maverick lied. His dark hair was plastered to his forehead, and he was damp and chilled to the bone. \"Okay, where you want it?\" He unzipped his pants and slid them down slightly, then pointed toward his inner thigh. \"Right there? Nobody's gonna see it.\" \"That's the point.\" \"I can get behind that,\" Amy said. The alarmingly pointy instrument in her hand buzzed, and she grinned. x When Amy was finished, she snapped her latex gloves off into the trash and said, \"I don't usually say this, but that's a nice job. I mean, that's some symmetrical shit right there. I think maybe I've outdone myself.\" \"Anything I should do?\" Maverick muttered. \"Just keep after it, y'know, if it looks infected, go get it checked out. It'll be a little sore for a few days. Other than that, enjoy.\" Maverick stared at the tattoo. It was tiny and pitch-black, a clear little heart standing out on the soft skin that so rarely saw daylight. \"Thanks,\" he said, dazed. \"No problem.\" Maverick tipped her an extra twenty and called a cab. x A/N: I got about three chapters hammered out while on vacation (lol i know, i'm lame) so I'll be posting faster than usual, after I proofread them.[Chapter 21] July 7, 1998. United States Navy Fighter Weapons School, Miramar, California. The details of the meeting in the hangar were known to most everyone by the end of the week. People stared blithely at Maverick when they thought he wasn't looking, and the class, having worn out the scandal of Jameson and Padgett, moved on to the bad blood between Anderson and Maverick, Iceman and Maverick, Jester and Maverick, Anderson and Jester, Maverick and the entire United States government, etc, etc. \"Can we talk?\" Iceman looked up. The crease between his eyes deepened, but he nodded. Maverick took his time closing the blinds and locking the door before he turned around, hands clasped behind his back, and approached Iceman's desk. \"Something you need?\" \"An apology would be nice.\" Iceman sucked in a breath through his teeth. \"Fine. I apologize.\" \"I don't think I buy that,\" Maverick said, unbuttoning his dress whites, which had been dry-cleaned and pressed since Thursday. \"I dunno, Tom.\" Iceman's eyes followed Maverick's fingers until the final button came undone and then dipped down over his treasure trail to where it led. \"I got a tattoo,\" Maverick said, and he was seventeen again - an orphan with a bright future. a new motorcycle, and an attitude problem. Iceman opened his mouth and closed it. Maverick rested his elbows on the desk between them and with one hand slid his pants down ever so slightly, inviting Iceman to finish the job. He did, standing up gracefully like he was about to receive a congressional medal of honor. \"It's small.\" Iceman stroked his finger over the ink-imbibed skin. Maverick took a step back so his ass was flush with Iceman's cock. \"Not now,\" Iceman murmured - but his finger was still rubbing Maverick's thigh gently while the other hand crept under the elastic of his briefs. Maverick grabbed Iceman's wrist and twisted. Iceman hissed in pain. \"What happened to your hand?\" \"Nothing.\" \"Nothing?\" He twisted harder and Iceman yanked out of his grip, shoving Maverick facedown on the desk and knocking the wind out of him. \"You ask a lot of questions, Mitchell,\" he said, softly. \"I need it - I need - you,\" Maverick gasped. \" Jesus -\" Iceman's hips came forward as he moved closer and Maverick quieted. \"Five years ago I got shot down over the Pacific,\" Iceman said. \"I broke my thumb ejecting. No one died. No sob story behind it. We got picked up an hour later.\" His hand ran up under Maverick's shirt, brushing along his individual vertebrae. \"In the water.\" Maverick's back arched and Iceman slipped his underwear off his ass, the soft bite of the elastic moving as Iceman's fingers did, pressing and probing and pushing. Maverick moaned and dug his fingernails into the wood of the desk. July 7, 1998. Miramar, California. When he arrived, Viper's wife was working in the garden, uprooting a row of cabbages. She gave him a friendly wave. \"Afternoon, Commander,\" Viper said, raising his cup of coffee to Maverick as he walked into the kitchen. \"Afternoon,\" Maverick replied, checking the urge to add a 'sir'. \"You look good.\" Viper got up. \"Let's take a walk. How's your divorce going?\" Maverick shrugged, pushing up the sleeves of his flight jacket. They left the house together, Viper running a hand through his hair. \"You should get laid,\" Viper said, squinting into the sun. \"Best way to get over it, kid.\" Maverick chuckled. \"I haven't exactly been living like a nun.\" Viper was quiet for a moment, then he slipped off his aviators and said, \"Listen, Mitchell...\" Maverick paused. \"I understand the appeal of sleeping with a colleague,\" Viper said. \"Who told you -\" Viper put a hand up and he fell silent. \"Don't throw your career away for a dye-job in a uniform, kid.\" \"You're speaking from experience?\" This was, to date, the single most insolent thing he'd said to Viper, who let it pass with a mere eyebrow raise. \"I thought you loved Iceman,\" Maverick said, doing his best not to sound resentful. Viper chuckled. \"Guys like Iceman are a dime a dozen. There's nothing underneath the shiny wrapper. Don't get lost in that.\" \"Is that him as a pilot or him as a person?\" \"As a pilot? He's excellent, one of the best. As a person...\" Viper lit a cigar he'd been fiddling with and blew a ring of smoke into Maverick's face. \"He's different now,\" Maverick said. \"Not in a small way.\" \"You have to expect that, after ten years on duty.\" Maverick's eyes followed a distant plane as it crossed the horizon. \"Have you ever known anyone with, uh, post traumatic stress disorder?\" \"Quite a few,\" Viper said. \"Comes with the territory.\" \"Did they get over it?\" Viper nodded slowly. \"Some do. But not overnight, Mitchell. And they're never the same.\" Another smoke ring, but it was directed at the ocean. \"You know, I always liked Charlie,\" he said. Maverick opened his mouth to rebut and Viper added, \"Never seemed like she'd make much of a doting wife, though.\" \"No,\" Maverick said through gritted teeth. \"No.\" \"I've got something for you,\" Viper said, and pulled a yellowed envelope out of his pocket. \"Letter from Duke.\" Maverick felt a nerve twitch in his forehead. \"Wh -\" \"To you. Thirty years ago, he wrote this.\" \"Why now?\" \"I thought about giving it to you when you got married, when your son came along... never felt like the right time,\" Viper said. \"So here we are.\" The setting sun glinted off his aviators and hit Maverick in the eyes, who looked down and accepted the envelope with a nod. \"Thanks.\" \"You're welcome, kid,\" Viper said, putting out his cigar and walking away.[Chapter 22] July 8, 1998. United States Navy Fighter Weapons School, Miramar, California. \"Here's Commander Kazansky's file from Jester, sir.\" \"Yeah, thanks,\" Maverick muttered, accepting it. Hillary smiled. \"So, that Iceman,\" she said. \"He's a dish , huh?\" Maverick cleared his throat. \"You're welcome,\" she added on her way out. Maverick slid his finger under the tab of the manila folder and flipped it open. COMMANDER THOMAS E. KAZANSKY, the top sheet read in block lettering. There was medical information under that. He skimmed through it. \"Six one and one eighty my ass .\" Maverick snorted and skipped halfway through the packet. Certain phrases jumped out at him and tangled together in his mind - survivor's guilt, sustained heavy losses, unwilling to respond, chest injury, shot down, blunted affect - \"Commander.\" Maverick looked up. Jester and Iceman were in his doorway. He shut the folder and slid it into his top drawer. \"Something you need, Heatherly?\" Iceman strolled through the office with alpha-dog swagger and settled in one of Maverick's chairs. \"I thought the three of us should get together.\" Jester looked oddly pained as he said it, like someone had a gun to his head. \"I was thinking that too,\" Maverick said, propping his feet up on his desk. \"I suggested to Iceman that we try to coalesce with Anderson as much as possible, while simultaneously protecting our interests.\" \"So what does that mean?\" \"We go along with him and his bullshit for now, but if it proves necessary we'll sell him down the river.\" \"That's a little insane,\" Maverick said. Iceman coughed something into his fist that sounded like \"glass houses\". \"I don't understand why we can't just tell him to go fuck himself now and save the trouble.\" Jester sighed. \"I don't understand,\" Iceman drawled, \"why we can't just let him say whatever he wants to the bureaucrats and leave it at that.\" Jester turned slowly. \"You want this program to head in whatever direction, with no regard to the work Mike Metcalf and I did to shape it, and the work I still do to shape it with the help of Commander Mitchell?\" \"I have to raise issue with the idea of -\" \"Excuse me, Commander, but I don't think occasionally parking your train in Maverick's station qualifies you to make decisions about the future of this program.\" There was a beat of silence. Iceman's jaw tensed. \"Lieutenant, stand down,\" Maverick murmured. Jester nodded. \"My apologies,\" he said curtly. \"I think this meeting is over.\" \"Great.\" When the door had swung shut behind him, Maverick let out a sigh. Iceman tipped his head back. \"You want to get a drink later?\" \"You talking to me or the ceiling?\" \"You,\" Iceman said, with a surprisingly soft edge to his voice. Maverick hesitated. \"I got this letter from my father.\" \"From beyond the grave? That's damn expensive postage, Mitchell.\" \"From Viper.\" Iceman nodded. \"And?\" \"I haven't opened it yet.\" Iceman laughed. \"Scared?\" \"No, I just... no,\" Maverick snapped. \"I don't want to, y'know, get my hopes up and then have it be... nothing. Or worse than nothing.\" Iceman seared him with that familiar steady gaze. \"So, drinks tonight?\" \"Officer's club?\" Iceman said. \"I have some of the good stuff at my place.\" At my place seemed to bounce off the walls and hang in the air. Iceman's expression belayed nothing. \"Officer's club, then your place,\" Iceman said, standing up. He hung in the doorway for a moment, shoulder blades rippling under his shirt as he turned back to Maverick and said, \"I'd like to take another look at that tattoo.\" July 8, 1998. Miramar, California. \"It isn't.\" \"Okay, Lawrence of Arabia has one iconic scene, Pulp Fiction has like, twenty.\" Maverick rolled his eyes. He was leaning on the bar, quickly approaching three sheets to the wind status, and Iceman was either very late or standing him up. Either way, his mood wasn't improved by the two lieutenants standing near him, having an unnecessarily loud discussion about the best director of the twentieth century that had somehow become a hypothetical cockfight between David Lean, Steven Spielberg, Ingmar Bergman, Martin Scorsese, the Coen brothers, and Quentin Tarantino. \"The quality of a film has nothing to do with the imitability. Just because people want to parrot something doesn't make it good . I mean, look at Michael Bay and Jerry Br -\" \"'Scuse me,\" Maverick cut in. They both turned, took a second to register who he was, and promptly fell all over themselves. \"Oh, hello, Commander -\" \"Sir! I didn't - we didn't see you there -\" \"Can I buy you a drink?\" \"No,\" Maverick waved away all of this. \"I was just going to ask you to shut the hell up,\" he said with an affable smile. \"Oh, okay, sir,\" the taller one said. His friend elbowed him in the stomach. Maverick returned to his whiskey. \"Mitchell.\" He turned to see Iceman walking over, gracefully parting the crowd like Moses. \"You're late,\" Maverick said. \"I know,\" Iceman replied, taking a few salted cashews from the dish on the bar and resting his hand on Maverick's thigh as he leaned across him. \"Neat scotch,\" he told the bartender. Maverick considered Iceman carefully. His square jaw, the sharp line of his nose, the way his eyes never came to rest on anything but were always, constantly, untiringly moving in their sockets - body tensed for disaster, muscles rippling under his skin. \"I, uh, need you,\" he said. \"For this.\" Iceman met his eyes. Maverick patted his chest where the letter was folded in the pocket of his dress whites. \"I need somebody , Tom.\" / Maverick made sure he was good and drunk first, and sat down across from Iceman, with the coffee table between them. He took a deep breath and ripped it open with the X-Acto knife in his palm. The letter itself was in better condition than the envelope. \"I should rip it up,\" he muttered. Iceman made an ambiguous hand gesture. \"You need to have an opinion for once in your goddamn life, okay?\" \"Fine. Don't read it, do read it, you think a letter's going to fix the thirty-eight years of hell you put yourself through? You think it's going to fix your relationship with your kid? It's a lot to ask out of something he wrote when you were in the third grade.\" Maverick unfolded it. Dear Pete, I'm writing this letter sitting on the flight deck. My buddy Mike just got a few pictures of his daughter in today's mail, so I figured I'd send something along to you. You're growing up way too fast, kid, every time I see you, you've grown a foot, it feels like. Maybe you'll be the first one to beat those short Irish genes. Daisy says you're doing well with baseball. That was always my sport, you know. Mostly I just wanted to say that last time I was home I was a little hard on you, and I'm sorry for it. My dad was always real hard on me, he was never very touchy-feely with me or my brothers. I grew up without learning how to say things like I love you, or I'm proud of you. I'm gone an awful lot, and your mom's not always there, even when she is... you know what I mean. You're the most important person on the world to me, and I'm prouder of you than you'll ever understand. Someday, when you have your own kids, maybe you will. There was more, but it was blurring together. Maverick folded the letter up into uneven squares and stood. He left the room and sat down hard on the stairs, feeling something building in his chest. Mercifully, Iceman let him be. / The phone rang. Maverick roused out of the fitful sleep he'd fallen into lying on the landing, fly of his jeans digging into his thigh. Iceman sauntered over and tilted his head. \"I'm coming,\" Maverick muttered. Iceman tossed him the phone and he fumbled and dropped it. \"Nice hands.\" \"Fuck off,\" Maverick said, sitting up and running his hand through his dark hair. \"Hello?\" \"Hello, Pete? It's Ned. I just wanted to let you know that Charlotte's camp is getting antsy about a court date.\" \"That's great.\" Ned missed the sarcasm. \"I, um, just thought - you should come in, soon, I think, so we can discuss things.\" \"Great,\" Maverick repeated, and hung up. With a groan, Iceman sat down beside him. Maverick buried his face in his chest. \"You smell good,\" he said quietly. Iceman just laughed. \"You're drunk, Mitchell.\" \"I know.\" They lapsed into comfortable silence.[Chapter 23] July 10, 1998. Miramar, California. \"That doesn't give you the right to drain the account.\" \"It's a joint account, I have every right in the world.\" \"You're robbing Peter to pay Paul.\" \"No, Peter's robbing you to pay Peter's fucking divorce attorney!\" There was silence. \"I'm pulling onto Grove, make sure Nick's ready to go.\" \"Fine.\" Maverick hung up on Charlie and kicked the stove. The doorbell rang. It was Iceman. \"Your timing is really shitty,\" Maverick snarled at him. Iceman just grinned in that irritating way of his. \"Yeah?\" he said, nudging Maverick aside and taking a seat on one of the leather bar stools. The front door opened again, and Charlie walked in. There was a beat of awful silence while she and Iceman sized each other up, like two bears that had been pissing in the same territory for a while but only now come face-to-face. \"You have a lot of nerve,\" Charlie told Maverick. Her voice was like a whip crack. Iceman put his hands up. \"I came over here to drop off paperwork.\" \"Don't,\" she snapped. \"Don't say anything to me.\" The familiar sounds of Hexen II abruptly died and Nick wandered out of the living room. All three adults stared at him. \"Get in the car, honey,\" Charlie said. Nick's gaze was fixed on Iceman. His face showed vague understanding for a moment, and then it was smoothed over and he was pasting on a fake smile and empty eyes. \"Okay.\" Maverick clenched his jaw. When the door had clicked shut, Charlie leaned against it. \"I don't want to see you in my house ever again,\" she said to Iceman. \"It's not your house,\" Maverick shot back, \"I paid -\" \"California,\" Charlie said, \"is a community property state.\" \"You won't,\" Iceman interjected. \"I'll have him back around dinner. I have a phone interview at six.\" She swept out of the house. Iceman threw his manila folder at Maverick. It hit him in the chest and he grabbed it by the spine, dumping reports all over the floor. \"The fuck -\" \"I never auditioned for a role in the destruction of your marriage, Mitchell. Get that straight.\" Maverick stared at him. \"You -\" There was a rumble as Charlie pulled out. \"I'll talk to you later, Commander,\" Iceman said. Maverick lunged forward and seized him by the sleeve. \"My marriage is over .\" Iceman's expression remained even. \"My marriage ,\" he repeated, \"is over . It's been over.\" Iceman knocked his hands away. Maverick grabbed him again and kissed him, ripping the seams of his collar. Iceman buckled and their bodies came together, collided. Maverick panted into his collarbone, dragging his teeth along Iceman's neck and sucking delicately. \"We can't keep doing this,\" Iceman muttered, lips pressed to Maverick's forehead. \"I can.\" He undid Iceman's fly as Iceman thrust against him, slow like clockwork. Maverick felt himself heating up and tautening with arousal like a high-tension wire. Iceman's resistance was fading, and Maverick could feel it - because at the end of the day, they were two men, two lonely, charming egomaniacs with an emptiness in their chests that no amount of fast flying could fill. / \"I have no idea what's going on here.\" Iceman chuckled into Maverick's neck. \"They killed his brother -\" \"I got that part.\" \"And Friendly's trying to stop him from testifying.\" Iceman slipped his hand over Maverick's waist and muted the TV. \"It's late. I should get going.\" The couch creaked as he stood up. Maverick rolled over onto his back and sighed. \"Don't,\" he moaned. But Iceman was already pulling his pants back on. Maverick sat up, dark hair flopping into his eyes. Iceman leaned over, kissed him soundly on the mouth, and muttered a quick goodbye on his way out. And just like that, Maverick was left alone with black-and-white Marlon Brando and his pigeons. / When Charlie brought Nick home, he was covered in various ballpark souvenirs. \"Where'd you take him?\" Maverick said as soon as he was out of earshot. \"Is that any of your business?\" \"He's still my son.\" \"Oh, I'm sorry. So you can bring your smarmy, homewrecking sleazebag of a boyfriend home and parade him around in front of our nine-year-old child and I'm the bad parent? Richard had tickets to a game at Petco park, so he went with him and Scott.\" \"Fine.\" Charlie turned on her heel and strode back to the Escalade. \"Ice queen,\" Maverick called after her. He could tell she wanted to flip him off, but true to form, she was too composed. Maverick traipsed after Nick. \"Hey,\" he said, leaning on the doorway of his bedroom. Nick was silent as he sat down on his bed, staring at the floor. \"I'm sorry about this morning.\" \"About what?\" Nick said evenly. \"I invented that, y'know. Big fake smile, blank face. It fools your mother. It doesn't fool me.\" \"Dad, I don't know what you're talking about.\" \"Tom Kazansky is a friend of mine,\" Maverick said. \"Okay.\" \"Your mother doesn't have friends ?\" \"Not ones that make you scream at her,\" Nick muttered. \"She wasn't screaming at me.\" \"I heard you.\" Maverick took a deep breath. Nick kept his eyes fixed on the floor. \"I'm going to bed, okay?\" \"Yeah.\" Maverick closed the door tightly behind him. / A/N: Finally Iceman gets his own actor meta-reference in the form of Mr. Brando. Speaking of which, if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend renting the The Island of Dr. Moreau. It's hilariously bad and Val takes his shirt off a lot.[Chapter 24] July 11, 1998. United States Navy Fighter Weapons School, Miramar, California \"Call on line one, Commander.\" Maverick picked up. \"Pete Mitchell?\" It was Beverly Billington. Maverick briefly considered throwing the phone through the plate glass window of his office. \"Yeah?\" \"The court date is upcoming -\" \"I'm aware.\" \"I'm giving you an out. One last chance to settle outside of court. Once we take this in front of a judge, you're screwed. You don't have a chance in hell. I'm an excellent attorney, and I will take everything. Your dignity, your properties, your assets, your child. Back down now, and we'll put together a settlement. I'll save you the media circus - you can keep your car, your savings, and your place in the Hamptons.\" \"No,\" Maverick told him. \"No?\" \"No.\" \"You'd rather spend a year in court?\" \"I don't plan on spending a year in court. We can settle finances, but I want custody awarded at the preliminary hearing.\" \"I'll tell you right now, you're not getting custody.\" \"She doesn't even have a place of resid -\" \"Ms. Blackwood has closed escrow on a two-bedroom apartment in D.C. She has a job with the Pentagon lined up, as well.\" Maverick fumbled the phone. \"Uh, can we meet? The four of us?\" \"Whenever you like.\" \"How about the fourteenth? I'll have Ned call you.\" Maverick hung up. \"Prissy little son of a...\" The door creaked and Iceman appeared. Maverick jumped out of his seat, spilling coffee on himself. Iceman muttered something under his breath and snagged a couple of doughnuts from the box on his desk as Maverick dabbed at his shirt. \"I've got some bad news.\" Maverick looked up. \"'S'that why you're eating all my doughnuts?\" \"Jameson passed away last night. He fell back into a coma and succumbed to multisystem organ failure.\" Maverick took a deep breath and looked skyward. \"His parents are flying up from Alabama,\" Iceman continued. \"I can meet with them, if you don't feel comfortable with it.\" Half of him wanted to turn and run like hell, but the other half was a little too proud to let Iceman horn in. It was funny how you could sleep with someone, care about them, share a bit of their personal darkness, and still see them as an interloper - the asshole from a decade ago who could do no wrong. \"Yeah,\" Maverick said after a moment of deliberation. \"Actually, I'd appreciate that, Kazansky.\" Iceman nodded slowly. \"Is it Bradshaw?\" \"Huh?\" \"Goose.\" Maverick shook his head. \"I just don't - I feel - responsible, is all.\" He sat down again. \"What are you going to tell them?\" Iceman sighed. \"That he was a good pilot, a faithful RIO. That it was a freak accident.\" He closed the blinds and moved behind Maverick's desk, giving him a soft kiss. \"You need to shave,\" Maverick muttered. Iceman laughed. \"They should be here tomorrow morning,\" he said, and moved for the door. Maverick glanced up from his desk, clicking a pen in his hand. \"Are they planning to sue?\" \"Excuse me?\" \"His parents. For wrongful death,\" Maverick said. Iceman hesitated. \"Whatever it is, I can handle it, Kazansky.\" \"It's a possibility.\" Maverick swore. \"Every asshole with bars on his sleeve is getting in line to screw me, you know that?\" Iceman slid his hands into his pockets. \"It's a strange business we do, Mitchell,\" he said quietly, and departed. / Maverick wandered into the showers after his mid-morning hop, slick with sweat and frustrated at every single last one of his students. Sometimes he wondered if he was cut out for teaching at all, or if he'd wind up as a cautionary tale on the six o' clock news. Navy Commander goes insane, strangles promising young fighter pilot to death with shoelaces. Film at eleven. It didn't help that Iceman was always there, questioning his authority, correcting him, one-upping him. Maverick paused as he rounded the corner. There was the faint rush of water echoing in the showers, but he knew for a fact there was no one there. Or had assumed so. He was about to leave when a low moan reached him, bouncing off the tile, and he realized. He'd recognize that voice anywhere. It was Iceman. Against his better judgment, he moved closer. Iceman was jerking off, fisting at himself with slow determination. The curtain was pushed back a few inches, revealing everything - the curve of his throat, the faint squeak of skin on tile as he writhed against the wall. Heat seeped into Maverick's stomach and he felt himself flushing, pants suddenly tight. He opened his mouth, but soundless air rushed out as he stood there, watching Iceman. There was something bedevilingly handsome about him in that moment. Iceman cut his eyes across the room and vanished behind the curtain for a moment. When he reappeared there was a towel wrapped around his waist. Maverick swallowed. \"Spying on me, Mitchell?\" \"Maybe.\" It came out tough, but Maverick felt vulnerable standing there, rock-hard and pink in the cheeks. Iceman gave him one of those ingratiating little smiles of his and pulled Maverick into the shower, pushing him up against the wall. Maverick let out a noise and begged \"please\", his voice rising and cracking. Iceman's right hand twitched as he grazed his fingers over Maverick's face. Maverick took his wedding band and twisted a few times until it came off, letting it fall and bounce into the drain. He slid Iceman's Navy ring off and onto his own finger in its place. Iceman gazed at Maverick, expression strange, and loosened his belt. / An ensign in knife-edge whites stopped Maverick in the hallway as he returned to his office with skewed hair, neck dusted with hickeys. Iceman trailed about twenty feet behind, doing his best to look inconspicuous as possible, like he hadn't just hastily washed Maverick's pre-come off his hands in the locker room sink. \"I have a page for you, Commander,\" the ensign said nervously. \"Um, Ted - Ted Boeck, with the San Diego Union, he'd like an interview at your soonest convenience.\" \"Tell him I'm not giving any interviews.\" \"He's insistent, sir.\" Maverick drummed his heel against the battleship linoleum. \"Fine.\" The weight of Iceman's ring - where his wedding band had been light and familiar - was distracting. Back in his office, the little light over line one was blinking. Iceman took a seat as Maverick picked up. \"Yeah?\" \"Ted Boeck with the San -\" \"Listen, Ted, I'll have my people call your people.\" \"Excuse me?\" \"I'm not sitting here and spoon-feeding you the details of a tragedy, you little ambulance chasing son of a bitch.\" \" Excuse -\" Iceman hit Maverick in the shoulder with a well-placed sucker punch and grabbed the phone out of midair as he dropped it. \"Ted?\" he said, as Maverick sank to his knees, rubbing his arm, and breathed Lamaze-style through the pain. When he had smoothed things over and hung up with Ted, Iceman let out a slow sigh and pinched his forehead. \"Mitchell...\" \"I don't have to take that from the press,\" Maverick snapped. \"I'm in charge, that should count for something.\" Iceman sat down next to him on the floor. \"I'm not going to stand by and watch your career take a hit because you're feeling powerless in your life and you want to lash out at everybody.\" \"Don't psycho-analyze me. You're a puffed-up, self-aggrandizing dye job -\" \"Maverick -\" \"- who won't even get help because he's got too much goddamn pride -\" Iceman fished something out of his pocket and handed it to Maverick. It was an insurance statement. Maverick took it and furrowed his eyebrows. \"I went to a neurofeedback center. They service veterans.\" He cleared his throat. \"Did they do anything?\" \"Slider's in town. He wants to go get a drink with me tomorrow night. Tag along if you want.\" \"Yeah, fine. Did -\" \"They just asked me some questions,\" Iceman said, getting up with a small groan. \"You should get moving, Mitchell, we have a civilian from AIAA coming in to give a talk in a few minutes.\" There was a brief clicking as he walked away, then Maverick's office door swung shut. / A/N: \"You don't know about the history of tragedies. I do. You're being very glib, Ted.\" I'm returning to the land of daily scholarly pursuits in a little more than a week, so updates will probably be more spaced out. May is drawing to a close, though.[Chapter 25] July 12, 1998. Half Moon Bay Grill and Bar, Miramar, California Slider was ostensibly in town to pay Iceman a visit, but Maverick was nursing a healthy amount of suspicion. The last time an alumnus of TOPGUN had shown up in Miramar, it had been Hollywood, looking for a job. Iceman had wandered over during pre-flight, under the pretense of inspecting Maverick's plane, and asked if he wanted a ride to the bar, since they were, most likely, going to wind up sleeping together that night anyway. \"You're a little cocky, Kazansky.\" \"With you, Mitchell, I can afford to be,\" Iceman said, giving the jet a pat. The metal rang as he sauntered away. Maverick walked in a few paces behind Iceman, glancing around. There was a general odor of cigarette smoke in the air, and he dug his fingernails into his palms to offset cravings. Slider appeared and wrapped Iceman in a bear hug that lasted about ten seconds too long, then let him go and gave Maverick a brisk handshake. \"You're getting gray,\" Iceman said as they slid into a booth, him and Maverick on one side and Slider on the other. \"Fuck you,\" Slider said, good-naturedly. \"So, Mitchell,\" he added, lacing his hands behind his head. \"I heard you're divorced, or something?\" \"Almost.\" Slider snorted. \"I didn't even know you got married, Peter Pan. And you have kids? Jesus, that's scary.\" \"Just the one,\" Maverick said quietly. \"Drinks?\" Iceman said, sliding out. The first few buttons of his shirt were undone, revealing some chest. On anyone else it would be sleazy, but somehow he pulled it off. \"Rum and ginger ale,\" said Slider. \"Uh... neat vodka.\" / \"I told them I wasn't flying with his ass anymore, what did they expect? So he calls me up, two o' clock in the fucking morning, begging me to take him back, because I was his third RIO that year and if he got passed over for squadron leader one more time he'd kill himself. What a tit,\" Slider said, knocking back his drink. Iceman chuckled. He had one hand on Maverick's shoulder and was stroking him with his thumb, clearly on autopilot. Maverick wondered if they'd even notice if he got up and left. \"So thanks for ditching me, bastard,\" Slider said. \"You're off playing with the big boys and I'm stuck with these assholes. I'm thinking about getting a desk job, it's just too much, y'know? I'm not getting any younger.\" Maverick took a sip of his beer. He felt Iceman's eyes on him and flicked his tongue along the rim of the bottle. Iceman made a soft noise low in his throat. Either Slider was oblivious or too damn drunk to care, because he launched into another diatribe. Iceman continued his mmmhmm-ing and nodding routine, brushing a finger along Maverick's hairline, making the hair on his bicep stand up. The sandwiches wound up being awful. Iceman remarked, rather darkly, he hadn't had food this bad since he was stationed in London. Slider seemed intent on excluding Maverick completely from the conversation, with his long-winded, nostalgic ruminations on those good old days back in flight school. Iceman kept his hand on Maverick's shoulder, squeezing him once in a while as if to silently apologize. Or maybe he was just hoping to get laid. It was hard to tell, with Iceman. By the time Slider had rolled around to the Hollywood stories, Iceman had moved a few inches closer and dropped his hand to Maverick's thigh, rubbing him under the table. \"I gotta piss like a racehorse, I'll be right back,\" Slider said, getting up. \"What do you feel like?\" Maverick muttered, splaying his hips open slightly. Iceman's hand dipped into the curve of his inner thigh, brushing his crotch. \"Self-loathing,\" Iceman said. \"What do you feel like doing , later, I meant.\" \"I feel like taking you back to my place and fucking you up against the mirror in my bathroom,\" Iceman said, with a certain amount of ironic detachment. Maverick bit his lip, holding in a moan, and shifted in his seat. \"So I can watch,\" Iceman added, eyes fixed on the door of the men's room. Maverick arched his back against the leather of the booth and took a few deep breaths. He was sweating like a pig and his heart was doing laps inside his chest. The door to the men's room creaked and Slider reappeared. Iceman let go of Maverick and cleared his throat. \"Uh, we're gonna hit the road,\" Iceman said, tossing a twenty on the table. Slider nodded. \"If you want to get together later this week, I'm free.\" / July 12, 1998. Miramar, California \"You think he knows?\" Iceman glanced over at Maverick. Streetlights passed over the car, lighting up his face. \"Slider?\" \"No, Mr. Rogers.\" \"He's not an idiot,\" Iceman said. \"You should get over.\" Iceman grumbled. Someone behind them honked and yelled, \" Get over, asshat!\" out their window. Iceman went even slower in response. Time passed in edgy silence. Normally the two of them could go for hours sans conversation, but not with sexual tension bouncing around like this. \"I think you're jealous,\" Iceman drawled, twiddling the wheel as they pulled onto his street. \"Jealous of what?\" Maverick muttered. \"Slider.\" \"Bullshit,\" he replied mildly. / The lights were all off, but Maverick had never minded the dark - night carrier landings didn't trouble him the way they did other pilots. Iceman slid a finger over Maverick's lips, tugging the lower one down, scraping his fingernail over Maverick's gums and making him shudder from head to toe. They staggered into the bathroom like drunks and Iceman leaned an elbow into Maverick's back, shoving him up against the full-length mirror. Maverick let out a moan, and it was good , a full-throated noise that rose steadily in pitch and made Iceman's thrusting go erratic for a moment. He regained composure and rested his forehead against the mirror, hips rocking evenly. Maverick's nipples were hard against the cold glass. \"Condom?\" Iceman muttered, lips brushing Maverick's ear. \"Top drawer.\" Iceman padded back into the bedroom and started rummaging around. He returned and Maverick heard the soft rip of the wrapper. He didn't quite want to reach climax yet, yet Iceman was taking his sweet goddamn time. Maverick whined. \"Hold on,\" Iceman murmured, smirk barely detectable in the dark. He slid a finger up inside Maverick, who let out an unintelligible string of vowels. The finger was replaced by Iceman, all Iceman. Colors exploded behind Maverick's eyelids. / They curled up next to each other in a haphazard nest of sheets, sticky with sweat and come and other sundry substances. Iceman stroked Maverick's hair off his forehead and whispered nonsensical little sweet things in his ear. The word wingman crept in there once or twice, contextually unbidden. Once Iceman had dropped off into fitful sleep, Maverick grabbed his bicep (freckled from sun damage and dusted in blonde hair) and pulled it underneath himself, coyote ugly style. Nightmares or no nightmares, he refused to let Iceman run off in the middle of the night. / A/N: I imagine Iceman and Maverick are both very irritating drivers, though for different reasons.[Chapter 26] July 13, 1998. United States Navy Fighter Weapons School, Miramar, California. \"The thing about the fifth generation series of aircraft will be stealth,\" Maverick said. \"That's the advantage. They'll come equipped with AESA radars and LPI networks. The military remains partial to the Boeings, but -\" \"- Lockheed Martin is... incorrigible,\" Iceman said, strolling up the aisle, posture ridiculously erect as usual, hands in his pockets. The students snapped to attention as he walked by. \"President Clinton -\" Laughter broke out at the mention of Clinton. Iceman snapped his fingers once, and it died. He stepped up beside Maverick and made a quick diagram on the blackboard. \"This is how Russia's economy works,\" he said, sketching in a triangle. \"They've privatized a great deal of their industry.\" \"Except,\" Maverick continued, \"for the energy and defense-related sectors.\" \"Which means...\" Iceman turned. A hand went up. \"Lieutenant?\" \"They're primed for a massive economic collapse?\" \"Correct,\" Maverick jumped in. \"Clinton has -\" More laughter. Maverick put up a hand. \"Yeah, it's very funny, adultery is very funny. Shut the fuck up,\" he snarled. This was met with stunned silence. Behind him, Iceman sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. \"- passed legislation that led to the formation of the NTO,\" Maverick said. Jester walked in and cleared his throat. \"Can I speak with you two in private for a moment?\" \"Dismissed,\" Iceman told the class, fiddling with his watch. With a murmur of \"yes sir,\" they filed out. \"Sorry,\" Jester offered. \"We were wrapping it up, anyway,\" Maverick muttered. He didn't add thank God , but he was thinking it. Teaching with Iceman was like being in hell, if the devil chewed Dentyne. \"Let's use my office,\" said Jester, clearing his throat. \"Lead on, Macduff,\" Maverick replied. \"Lay on,\" Iceman said, getting up. \"Huh?\" \"Lay on is the orig -\" Maverick interrupted him with a hand gesture that was a mix of \"suck my dick\" and \"shove it up your ass\". Iceman reciprocated in kind. When the glass door had closed behind them, Jester did a bit of pacing and then leaned down, hands on his desk, and raised his eyebrows at the pair of them. \"Yeah?\" Maverick said. A strand of hair fell into his eyes, and he smoothed it back. \"The boys upstairs want to move the operation to Fallon.\" Maverick blinked. \" Fallon ?\" he demanded, voice rising a few octaves. \"Yes.\" \"In Nevada ?\" \"Yes.\" \"Jesus,\" Maverick said. Iceman's left hand was on his hip and the other was pulling a pen out of his pocket. He played with it nervously for a moment. \"They have a base there?\" \"Of course,\" Jester said, crossing his arms. \"I can't move to Nevada,\" Maverick said. He was suddenly feeling very clammy. \"Did they say why?\" \"We may merge with NSAWC.\" \"Why would we do that?\" Jester hesitated. \"Heatherly -\" \"It's BRAC.\" He sounded defeated. \"They've been pushing for it for years. We put it off. You put it off,\" he told Maverick. \"But - custody.\" Maverick stared at his feet. \"My hearing...\" \"Nothing's finalized yet,\" Jester said. \"How come I wasn't the first to hear about this?\" Jester and Iceman exchanged an uncomfortable glance. \"Three guesses,\" said Iceman. / \"Typical German, I guess.\" Maverick was in the stall of the men's, unsuccessfully trying to get a coffee stain out of his browns with those shitty tan paper towels and that shitty pink hand soap. Two lieutenants had wandered in and begun discussing Iceman. He was half listening to them, half absorbed in his own self-pitying thoughts. It was just starting to sink in - my wife left me. She's taking my son away from me. Denial went a long way in the Mitchell family, but it didn't last forever. \"Fucking Nazi, more like.\" The other lieutenant chuckled in response and shifted his weight around as he did his fly. \"Maybe he's gay.\" \"Maybe he's a gay Nazi.\" \"He's real good, though. You see that dive the other day?\" \"I think Maverick's better.\" \"You're crazy.\" \"No, come on, he's always coming up with stuff. Commander Kazansky's just like, oh hey, this is how you're supposed to do it. Like that's going to help us when we have our asses pinned five to one and the textbook's saying to roll over and play dead.\" Maverick grinned to himself. \"Yeah, but he's actually seen it. He's been out there. I mean, what's Mitchell done? He was good fifteen years ago. He's kind of a has-been.\" \"He's just... I don't know. You call Stacy back?\" The conversation faded as they rounded the corner. / July 13, 1998. Marine Corps Air Station, Miramar, California. A few members of the Coast Guard were there to testify, their uniforms standing out like crocuses against the wood paneling of the courtroom. Maverick felt slightly on edge. \"They'll find in our favor,\" Jester muttered. \"Don't worry.\" As usual, Iceman looked like he wanted nothing better than to be somewhere else. Maverick couldn't blame him. They'd been there for hours, fielding dirty looks from the JAG Corps. \"You'd think we were the Tailhook kids,\" Maverick replied. Jester snorted. Maverick shifted back and forth. Spending a night with Iceman and then sitting on a hard wooden bench for a prolonged period of time was - ill-advised, to say the least. \"We've reached a decision,\" one of the officers said from behind the desk, steepling his fingers. Jester took in a deep breath. \"We're clearing the STFI program of all responsibility from the incident occurring June twenty-fifth.\" He locked eyes with Maverick and gave him a tiny nod, as if to say, you're welcome. / July 14, 1998. 28th Street Diner, Miramar, California. \"You gotta cut him loose, Mitchell.\" \"Who?\" \"Kazansky.\" Maverick took a sip of his milkshake. \"Ever hear of Ted Boeck?\" \"No,\" Viper said, rolling up his sleeves. \"He wrote a piece on us,\" Maverick said. \"TOPGUN, I mean. Didn't interview me.\" Viper scoffed and muttered something about gonzo journalism. He slid his aviators off and set them on the table. \"There's a giant target on my back, y'know?\" \"Your father had that same martyr complex,\" Viper said. \"Look where it got him.\" Maverick sighed. \"What do you think I did when Bradshaw died?\" \"I don't recall you doing shit.\" Viper blew a ring of smoke at him. \"Excuse me, sir, but this diner is non-smoking,\" said a waitress as she went by. Viper put his cigar out on the table and clasped his hands. \"Damage control, kid.\" \"Why do I have to cut Tom loose?\" Viper wrinkled his nose, evidently at the first-name basis. Maverick corrected himself. \"Iceman.\" \"It's deeply inappropriate, first off.\" Maverick bit back what he could have said, namely \"what about you and Jester?\" \"We've never had a good professional relationship,\" Maverick said. \"Simple clash of egos, Mitchell. It was a big pain in the ass, dealing with the two of you. I've never had two pilots pull each other's pigtails like that.\" Maverick sighed. \"Then again, no one ever really liked you.\" \"Thanks.\" \"You were a safety hazard. You make guys nervous. Anyway - I'll just say this. It's gonna come back to bite you in the ass.\" \"I'll take my chances,\" replied Maverick. / A/N: Lots of acronyms today.[Chapter 27] July 15, 1998. United States Navy Fighter Weapons School, Miramar, California. \"Do you think it was my fault?\"' Iceman set his coffee down and sighed. \"What?\" \"Padgett. I know you do.\" \"I think it was extremely arrogant for you to assume that any pilot that passes through your tutelage is undoubtedly fit to meet the standards we set here.\" \"So you do. You know what I think?\" Iceman ignored that. Jester sat down, rubbed his eyes one-handedly, and let out a weary sigh. \"When's your court date?\" \"Uh,\" Maverick said. \"You don't know?\" Iceman said, shaking a packet of Splenda into his cup. \"It's the twenty-first,\" Maverick snapped. \"Well, good luck,\" Jester told him. / July 16, 1998. United States Navy Fighter Weapons School, Miramar, California. \"Maverick?\" \"Yeah, c'mon in,\" he muttered. Hillary cleared her throat. \"I just wanted to let you know that there's a meeting tomorrow that you weren't going to be notified of.\" He looked up at the ceiling and sighed. \"Um, and Jim Drexler locked himself in his office with a bottle of gin and says he won't come out until he finds out we're not moving to Fallon.\" \"Fantastic,\" Maverick said, shooting her a grin. \"This week just keeps getting better.\" \"Que sera, sera,\" she said, smiling back. \"Hey, where's Iceman?\" \"Do you want me to find out for you, sir?\" \"That'd be great.\" She returned with a slip of paper. He studied it for a moment. \"Tell Jester to take my two o'clock.\" / July 16, 1998. Neurofeedback Center of San Diego, San Diego, California. \"I'm here to check in on Tom Kazansky,\" Maverick told the receptionist. \"It's business related.\" \"Tom Kazansky? Hmm... Oh, he's on the fifth floor. Take a right and it's the first door on your left.\" \"Thanks.\" There was an extremely thin brunette woman in the elevator who kept giving Maverick sideways glances. He kept his eyes on the floor and his hands in the pocket of his flight jacket. That was the thing about taking off your wedding band. He'd gone back and fetched it out of the drain, but it was sitting on his dresser at the moment. In its place, Iceman's Navy ring had chafed his finger to hell and back, but it had stayed on. The waiting room was empty, so Maverick took the liberty of letting himself in. Iceman was lying back in a chair, sensors placed on various locations across his scalp, while a bearded guy in the seat next to him stared at a computer screen. The walls were a soft lavender and there were soothing seascapes on every wall. Maverick took a quick glance at the diploma hanging across from him. Eric Eichman, Licensed Neurofeedback Specialist. He cleared his throat. \"Hey,\" he said, trying to play it off as smooth as possible. The two of them looked up in surprise, and Eric gave him a once over. \"You,\" he said, getting up and offering Maverick his hand, \" must be Maverick.\" \"Yeah, actually.\" \"I see what you mean,\" Eric said to Iceman, who grunted vaguely in response. \"So what's going on here?\" \"Tom and I are getting to the end of our session. Would you like to stick around?\" Eric said, in an soothing voice. Maverick pulled a chair over and straddled it backwards. \"What's with the lines?\" he said, gesturing toward the screen. \"That's his EEG,\" Eric replied. \"Actually, this is quite interesting - his alpha level spiked when you walked in,\" he said. \"What does that mean?\" \"Most likely that you're a source of tension for him.\" \"Yeah, well, likewise,\" said Maverick. Eric moused over and closed the program. \"I think we're about finished,\" he said, getting up and disconnecting the leads. Iceman sat up and yawned so widely that birds could have flown in his mouth and escaped his notice. Maverick stood and fidgeting, playing with the zipper on his jacket. / \"He sounded like a quack to me.\" Iceman held a palm up as he stopped at the water fountain and drank for what seemed like half of an hour. When he came up for air, all he did was shake his head. \"Why can't you be normal and go see a therapist?\" Iceman slid a pair of aviators on as he stepped into the elevator. He slid his hand under Maverick's wife beater and smiled at him like a shark that had scented blood. Maverick stared back at him. The elevator dinged and Iceman strolled out. Maverick followed like a lost puppy. \"The irony of you telling anyone to be normal,\" Iceman replied, \"is overwhelming.\" Maverick scowled. He hated that Iceman could go and set him off like that and not follow up. \"I don't think I have a case,\" he said. His palms itched. \"It's a Hail Mary pass. I think I might lose my son.\" Iceman was staring at something on or around the horizon. \"Life goes on,\" he drawled.[Chapter 28] July 18, 1998. United States Navy Fighter Weapons School, Miramar, California. \"It's not the worst case scenario,\" Jester muttered. \"It's Nevada. What's in Nevada?\" \"Vegas,\" offered Maverick. \"I can't drag my wife to Vegas,\" Jim said, rubbing his temples. Maverick was feeling oddly serene. Any minute now he'd burst into tears and start wailing about how he'd wasted the last ten years of his life, but for the moment, he was sitting there with a smile on his face that didn't reach his eyes. Iceman was sitting rigidly in an armchair, glancing through the glass door whenever someone walked by. LC Mike Townsend, who had flown with Chipper a few years ago and managed to wrangle a job at TOPGUN on the basis that they were short-staffed and he was desperate, made a tsk ing noise. Iceman tipped his head back and parted his lips the way he did when something was weighing on his mind. The line between his brows was more pronounced than usual. Maverick drummed his fingers on his thigh. There was a Post-It stuck to the knee of his jeans. He peeled it off. Haircut. He ran his hand through his hair and was surprised when a strand or two fell back into his eyes. Had he really been that out of it lately? He wrote on another Post-It, dentist? and stuck it to his desk. \"It's just insane,\" Jim mumbled, lighting a cigarette. There was a knock at the door, and Viper walked in. Everyone tensed. Mike sneezed and saluted simultaneously and hit himself in the eye. \"Can I talk to you?\" Viper said to Maverick. \"Yeah,\" Maverick replied, following him out. Once they were outside, blinking as they were suddenly bathed in sharp California sunlight, he turned to Viper. \"Why'd you stop by?\" \"I heard about -\" \"- Fallon.\" \"Yes,\" Viper said, drawing the word out as he squinted into the sun. \"That's a ways.\" \"Honestly, I don't know whether to shit or wind my watch over here.\" Viper chuckled dryly. \"You'll figure it out, Duke.\" Maverick paused. \"Duke?\" Viper gave him a dismissive wave. \"Duke, Maverick, you know what I meant.\" He lit a cigar. Maverick sighed and sat down on the curb. \"What am I doing here? Sometimes I don't even know.\" \"Nobody does, kid.\" / \"Hey.\" Iceman gave him a nod. Maverick took a seat on his desk. Iceman glanced at the space now occupied by Maverick's ass. \"What?\" \"You're sitting on my desk,\" Iceman muttered. \"Yeah.\" \"Don't,\" Iceman said, twirling his pen, \"do that.\" \"You're staying, aren't you? If we move to Fallon?\" \"Mitchell... I'm forty years old. Once you get to a certain age, the calls stop coming, the jobs dry up. I'm not throwing away a good thing. What's your vendetta?\" \"I don't have a vendetta,\" Maverick said, swinging his legs. \"I just like California.\" Iceman muttered something under his breath. Maverick leaned back so his head was against Iceman's keyboard and stared up through his eyelashes. Iceman slid his hands through Maverick's dark hair and kissed him. \"Get out of here,\" he tossed out, returning to his paperwork. Maverick sat up, which was a feat of abdominal muscles considering the position he was in, and strolled out of Iceman's office, straightening his collar. / July 18, 1998. Cordwainer's Shop, Miramar, California. \"This is a gorgeous Italian leather. Very supple, very soft. This style says... professional, it says, look at me, I am a businessman.\" Maverick had started having his shoes custom-made around the time Charlie had stopped sleeping with him. He went to a very flamboyant French guy named Cyril in a little strand of shops about twenty minutes out of his way, but it was worth it. \"I mean, it is a custody hearing,\" Maverick said. \"I don't want to look like I just went out and dropped that much...\" \"Oh, of course,\" said Cyril. \"This is more modest,\" he said, sliding the catalog back over to Maverick. \"What size?\" \"Uh, seven.\" \"Small feet,\" said Cyril. Maverick cleared his throat. \"Could you maybe -\" he dropped his voice a little. \"Add a lift?\" \"How much? Half inch?\" Cyril replied, like his request was not at all surprising. \"Uh... a quarter, maybe.\" \"We'll see. They'll be ready by tomorrow evening. Now hurry up and get out, you're not the only gay man who wants to buy shoes from Cyril.\" \"I'm not gay.\" Cyril laughed hysterically as he closed the door behind Maverick, who stood there fuming indignantly and listening to the chimes jingle.[Chapter 29] July 18, 1998. Miramar, California. Iceman came over that evening, saying he wanted to talk . Maverick wasn't stupid, nor had he never used that line himself, but he let him in anyway. \"Someone's been skimming from our funds,\" he said, uncapping a beer and taking a sip. \"Internal affairs is launching an investigation.\" \"Perfect timing,\" Maverick said, pulling his shirt off over his head and tossing it onto the counter. Iceman raised an eyebrow. \"It's hot,\" he said. Iceman walked over and slid his hands over Maverick's waist. Maverick dropped his head against Iceman's chest. \"Did you get a haircut?\" Iceman asked, his hand undoing Maverick's fly as he buried his lips in his brow. Maverick laughed huskily. \"Yeah.\" Iceman's hand crept lower. \"I, uh, I've got a headache,\" Maverick said, pulling away and clearing his throat. There was a long pause. He hoped Iceman would take that for what it was, just nerves and guilt, and push past it. But Iceman just nodded slowly. / \"Who do you peg?\" Maverick said, picking up a football, fumbling it, and tossing it directly into a bush. Iceman was sitting on an iron-wrought patio bench that Charlie had picked out, arms folded. \"Hm?\" \"The embezzler,\" called Maverick, who was on his hands and knees looking for the ball. The sky was fading to a dark orange in the distance. It was the kind of sunset to ride off into, but Maverick had sold his motorcycle on eBay years ago. He got to his feet and lobbed a pass at Iceman, who sent it back with a perfect spiral. \"Nice hands,\" Maverick said. \"You want to play?\" \"What, football?\" Iceman stood up, snorting derisively. \"Yeah, come on,\" Maverick said. \"What, afraid of me?\" Iceman gave him that withering you-must-be-kidding look. \"Ooh, the Iceman is scared,\" goaded Maverick. \"You know I'm gonna kick your ass.\" \"Fine,\" Iceman snapped. \"Let's go.\" Maverick grinned. \"Okay, my end zone's over here,\" he said, gesturing vaguely at the rosebushes lining the side of the house, \"and you're over there.\" \"It's no one we know,\" Iceman said. \"Huh?\" \"The embezzler. It's not going to be anyone we know. It'll be some little troll in an office out East.\" \"How do you know?\" \"I know.\" \"You know, I played in high school,\" said Maverick, changing the subject. \"You could see over the linemen?\" Maverick shot him the middle finger in response and charged forward with the ball. Iceman tackled him easily, without any real malice behind it, and they stayed down maybe a second longer than necessary before Maverick turned the ball over. He was still shirtless, and there was a grass stain on his shoulder. They went on like that for another ten minutes or so, until Maverick managed to feint his way into a touchdown. Iceman rolled his eyes as Maverick spiked the ball and started dancing around, then called \" showboating \" and took him down at the waist. They laid there tangled up in each other's limbs, panting and smudged with dirt. Maverick was laughing so hard - dimples out in full force - that he gave himself the hiccups. Iceman groaned as he rolled over, his boner pressing up against Maverick's thigh. Maverick tensed. \"It's an erection, Mitchell, not a binding contract,\" Iceman sighed. \"I want to,\" Maverick murmured into his chest, taking fistfuls of his shirt. \"Don't - Jesus, I'm just -\" \"Two days. I know.\" They fell into silence. Iceman's thumb traced the curve of Maverick's lips. Maverick swallowed a moan and slid his hand between Iceman's legs. Iceman rolled over so he was on top, sliding Maverick's jeans off his ass, licking a strip from his neck where his pulse was hammering at a jackrabbit speed down to his hipbone. His hands worked quickly, and soon Maverick had his underwear around his ankles like a character in a lesbian pulp fiction novel as Iceman's tongue moved to the tattoo on his thigh. The air rushed out of Maverick's lungs. \"Shut up,\" Iceman panted, breath unbearably warm on his skin, \"neighbors -\" Maverick's fingernails sank into Iceman's ass and he made a choked hissing noise, grabbing Maverick by the wrist and twisting him away. Maverick kissed him again, a needy haze settling over his eyes, their tongues twining and teeth clicking together. His hips came up to meet Iceman's and he drew his mouth away and let out a few sharp syllables, a whiny groan in the depths of his throat. \"Ice, Ice,\" Maverick panted unintelligibly, \"neck - don't... no hickeys, court -\" Iceman moved his lips to Maverick's chest and went lower, teasing a nipple on his way down. He was noiseless, working over Maverick like a cobra while the latter did his best impression of a porn star, whimpering and keening to beat the band. His eyes rolled up in his head as he came into Iceman's palm, shifting onto his stomach, elbows against the dirt. Iceman followed a moment later with a soft, dog-like sigh and rolled off of Maverick. They lay there, slick with sweat, chests heaving in the hot July evening, lit with dwindling sunlight and citronella candles. \"So,\" Iceman drawled, \"about that headache...\" Maverick's whole body shook with laughter. / A/N: As y'all have probably surmised, the climax of May will be the custody hearing, and its aftermath. I'll do an epilogue, though, because I think this fic needs one... anyvey, I have another idea in the works - it's a Top Gun genderswap fic set in the present day and within the movie timeline, and it will be a whole lot of delicious, delirious crack with parodical references out the ass and femslash, plain slash, etc. If you are one of those rare and precious people that appreciates my sense of humor, you'll probably like it, so keep an eye out (:[Chapter 30] July 20, 1998. Miramar, California. \" Oye como va, mi ritmo! Bueno pa gosar, mulata. ..\" \"Hnnnghh.\" Maverick rolled over and made a half-hearted swipe at his clock radio. He remembered the night before in bits in pieces, beginning with Iceman grabbing his ass in between classes and ending with him presumably sneaking out while Maverick was still asleep; the final great act of denial in whatever convoluted affair they had going on. He stumbled into the bathroom and showered quickly, pulling his suit on and Cyril's shoes, which still smelled deliciously of new leather. As Maverick slipped a tie around his neck, he noticed a hickey. No, wait, two hickeys, two angry red marks that happened to be the last thing he needed right now. \"Shit.\" He rummaged through the drawers, finally came up with a tube of concealer that Charlie had left there, and dabbed it over his skin carefully. \"Better than nothing,\" Maverick muttered to his reflection. / July 20, 1998. Madge Bradley Courthouse, San Diego, California. Despite the early hour, the sun was already beating down on everything, leaving Maverick to sweat underneath his collar while he waited for Ned to show up. Charlie arrived before his attorney, stepping out of a taxi in a pencil skirt and heels, jaw set. As she made her way up the stairs, cutting her eyes at Maverick, he took a few steps back into the shade of the archway. \"Good morning, Peter,\" she said crisply. Maverick gave her a nod. Charlie glanced at his neck. \"Are you wearing makeup ?\" \"What?\" \"It's coming off on your collar.\" Maverick's hand moved to his neck automatically. Charlie sighed. \"Here,\" she said, pulling a handkerchief out of her pocket. He moved closer and she began to rub at his shirt with it. \"Thanks,\" he said sheepishly. \"How are you ever going to get along without me?\" she muttered, slipping the handkerchief into her purse. They both stood, looking down the gargantuan stairway and into the street, where morning traffic was moving. \"So,\" Charlie said, running her fingers over the hem of her skirt. \"How's Iceman doing?\" Maverick snorted. \"Jesus Christ.\" \"No, I really want to know. I have nothing but affection for the man who's been stuffing my husband like a Christmas goose for, what, three months now -\" \"You know, if you were sleeping with someone else, I wouldn't treat you half this bad.\" She laughed. \"Are you kidding me? I wouldn't -\" \"Don't -\" \"I wouldn't hear the end of it!\" \"At least admit that if I had a girlfriend -\" \"It's the exact same situation.\" \"It's not! It is not , and you damn well know that! \" Maverick had to resist the urge to stamp his foot. \"Because you think I lied to you, or something -\" Charlie shook her head, nostrils flaring. \"You never once mentioned... the whole time we were married... God, Maverick, it was a slap in the face. It's one thing if you just didn't love me anymore, but to find out I've been living a lie for years ...\" \"It was never a lie, Charlie. Maybe toward the end, but... It was never... I never lied to you. Sometimes when I was younger, you know -\" She closed her eyes, looking pained. \"I had some... I slept with a few guys,\" Maverick said. It felt to him like the words were being wrenched from his mouth, one at a time. He couldn't bring himself to look her in the face. Charlie sighed again, this time with finality, like she was letting something go. \"I knew.\" \"What?\" \"I knew you were... I knew you liked men, too. I'm not blind.\" Charlie chuckled. \"Oh, I used to get so jealous. I didn't even mind when you looked at women, but... I was always afraid you'd run off with - with another pilot, or something, and I'd be left to explain that to Nick.\" She paused. \"And then it happened.\" \"I never meant to betray you.\" Maverick's throat was stinging. \"I know,\" she said quietly. \"I thought I could have everything I wanted, without any consequences. I always thought you'd be there, waiting for me. I overestimated.\" Maverick said nothing. He'd thought much the same. At that moment, both Ned and Beverly pulled up in separate town cars. \"What are you doing out here?\" Beverly demanded, jogging up the stairs, panting. \"We're supposed to be inside in less than a minute!\" Ned, who was running after him, tripped and dropped his briefcase. Paperwork exploded into the hot San Diego air. Maverick went to help him. \"I think we'll win,\" Ned said, as they knelt on the marble, piecing his files back together as quickly as possible. \"I really think so.\" Maverick just nodded. / The beginning of the hearing dragged on for twenty minutes. Beverly and Ned said their pieces to the judge, who was a dour-looking woman of fifty. Maverick shifted back and forth in his seat, the whisker burn on his inner thighs rubbing against the soft fabric of his suit and making him wince. In all honesty, this was killing him. Maverick was a guy of immediacy. He needed to know , right now, if he was going to spend the next eleven years with his son - or the next eleven years flying out to the godforsaken East Coast to see his son. Despite Maverick's feelings on the subject, bureaucracy marched on for another half of an hour before the judge - the honorable Marsha Lightman, apparently - turned her attention to Charlie and Maverick. \"If Commander Pete Mitchell and Ms. Charlotte Blackwood will stand up and give a statement on behalf of themselves,\" said Marsha, \"this hearing will conclude, and I will take a short recess and return with my decision.\" Maverick - who was slumped ridiculously in his chair in an attempt to deal with the discomfort that Iceman, the mouthy twat, had inflicted on the lower half of his body - righted himself. Charlie stood. \"Your honor, I raised Nick,\" she said, her voice clear and even. \"That is disputed by neither Peter nor his attorney. I took him to his first day of school, to get his shots... I stayed home for almost his entire childhood so that my husband could further his career. Throughout that time, I firmly believe M - Pete's lingering problems with his own father prevented him from truly bonding with our son. I know he cares for Nick deeply, and I believe that despite his shortcomings, he is an adequate father. But that's not enough. With the high-paying, flexible job I've lined up with the Pentagon, I'm more than equipped to provide Nick with everything he could possibly need, even as a single parent.\" She cleared her throat. \"Pete works long hours and is on the verge of relocating to Nevada for his job.\" A murmur rippled across the court and Marsha made a small note, pursing her lips. \"I want the best for my son,\" Charlie said. \"And I know in my heart what that is.\" \"Thank you, Ms. Blackwood,\" droned the judge. \"We will hear Pete Mitchell's statement, and then take our recess.\" The blood drained out of Maverick's face as he stood, and he grabbed onto the table as he stood, his nails sinking into the wood. \"I don't have a speech.\" He spoke directly to the judge. A few feet to the left, Charlie sighed. \"But I do have something to say,\" Maverick continued. \"Charlie can stay here. She has that option. I can't uproot to D.C. And I can't lose my son. I've lost my family twice now. I can't do it again.\" He sat. \"Thank you,\" Marsha repeated, rifling through a pile of papers, slipping her glasses off and rubbing her temples. \"Court will resume in ten minutes, at which point I will give my final decision on the custody arrangement of Nick Mitchell. Dismissed.\" The gavel banged. There was a flurry of movement as everyone got up. Out of the corner of his eye, Maverick caught Charlie giving him a look. He turned his attention back to Ned, who clapped him on the shoulder. \"Like I said, Pete - I feel good about this.\" / Outside, Beverly was smoking a Marlboro Light and muttering to Charlie. Maverick took some small satisfaction in knowing that he had a) quit smoking and b) always smoked cowboy killers, never Lights. He wanted to call Nick and apologize for everything, apologize for embodying that stupid Harry Chapin song that had always made him teary because it reminded him of his father, apologize even though it was too little, too late. He knew from experience how this would come back to bite Nick in the ass later - how it would make him bitter and insecure and leave him constantly searching for validation and affection and whatever else he had been denied. Maverick sagged against a pillar. \"I don't see how she could rule against you,\" Ned babbled. \"I mean, uh, they usually rule for mothers, but you, y'know, you don't have a history of abuse, or anything like that -\" \"Stop,\" Maverick muttered, not unkindly. Ned checked his watch. \"Two minutes.\" The rest of that time was spent in uncomfortable, edgy silence. / When they got back, the judge was sitting with her fingers steepled, staring into space. Maverick sat down again and began clicking a pen. Charlie looked utterly complacent. In twelve years, he had never known her not to expect to get what she wanted - why should today be any different? \"You both have a strong defense,\" Martha began. \"I've spent fifteen years as a judge in the family court system, and I have seen some very open-and-shut cases. This is not one of them.\" She removed her glasses and cleared her throat. \"That being said, I have made a decision to turn full custody over to Charlotte Blackwood, with negotiable and extensive visitation rights for Pete Mitchell.\" The air rushed out of Maverick's lungs, and he leaned forward in his seat, biting his lip hard enough to draw blood. Charlie did not react, but there was a tiny smirk on Beverly's face. Maverick rose a half-inch in his seat, every nerve in his body screaming out I want to punch him I want to punch him - \"This case will be up for review in eight months,\" continued Marsha, \"at which point it may be recommended that Pete Mitchell receive partial custody.\" The gavel banged. \"Dismissed.\" Ned was talking, his voice white noise on the periphery of Maverick's focus. Maverick walked out, hands in his pockets. He got into his car and pulled away, throat tight with emotion that he couldn't bear to release. / July 20, 1998. San Diego, California. There was no one else on the road. He took it slowly. After the fifth drink at that shitty little sports bar, his vision had started to pool and slide and blur, but he was still Maverick , goddamnit. Not being a complete moron, he stuck to sidestreets all the way from the bar into Miramar. His drunken hubris had almost completely encapsulated him when a siren broke through the darkness. Maverick glanced in his mirror. Shit. He pulled over. \"Good evening, sir,\" said the cop, sliding his sunglasses off and squinting at Maverick. \"Do you realize you've been weaving back and forth for the last ten minutes?\" \"No,\" Maverick muttered. \"License and registration, please.\" Maverick handed him both. \"I'm going to ask you to submit to a sobriety test,\" the cop said, opening the driver's side door. Maverick glanced at his badge. Adams. He got up, wobbling as he did. Adams took Maverick by the arm and dragged him a few feet forward. \"Please stand at attention, tip your head back, and count to thirty,\" he said, sounding bored out of his skull, like he pulled over drunk drivers every night of his life. Maverick obliged. He tried to stay as rigid as possible, but he felt himself twitching and swaying slightly. Fuck Adams. Fuck Adams, fuck Beverly, fuck Anderson, fuck Charlie, fuck Iceman, fuck Jester, fuck Duke - \"That's enough,\" Adams interrupted. \"I'm going to ask you to walk nine paces, heel-toe, and then submit to a breathalyzer.\" Maverick took three and stumbled to the ground, skinning the knee of his suit on the asphalt. A passing car slowed and its occupants, a man and a woman - probably a couple, probably happily married or something - rubbernecked as they went by. Fuck them too, for good measure. The breathalyzer was a little like giving a blowjob to a robot. Maverick sat on the hood of the squad car while it calculated his results. \"Are you aware of the legal BAC in California?\" \"N -\" \"The legal limit is point oh eight. You blew a point two.\" Maverick stared at the pavement. Adams leaned over and spoke to his partner, who had been sitting silently in the passenger seat throughout the entire ordeal. \"Let's take him down to the station. Wanna call it in?\" The other cop grunted and clicked on his radio. As he was shoved ass-first into the squad car, Adams' hand firmly on his head, Maverick realized he had absolutely hit rock bottom. / A/N: This is so late ~ the next (final) chapter shouldn't take this long. And the epilogue is pretty much written.[Chapter 31] July 20, 1998. Miramar, California. They waited until they had actually dragged him down to the station to arrest Maverick, heaving him out of the car carelessly. \"If no one picks you up, you can spend tonight in here getting sober,\" said the mustached cop at the front desk. \"Anyone you want us to call?\" Maverick rattled off Iceman's phone number and Adams threw him into one of the two cells in the back. \"Will I get time?\" Maverick slurred at him, staggering backward onto a bench. He'd never actually spent time in jail before, and he was a little worried about his career, to be frank. He was already going to be facing down a suspension and a hearing (at the very least) when they found out about his DUI. Adams shook his head. \"First time offense is a slap on the wrist and a fine. Oh, and you'll have to go to First Offender's School to get your license back,\" he tossed out over his shoulder as he walked away. Fantastic. Maverick slumped against the stone wall. Next to him was an elderly man in a suit and a young guy with a shiner. \"Hey,\" the owner of the shiner said, offering his hand. \"I'm Hector.\" Maverick shook it and blurted out his callsign before he could stop himself. Did your mother not like you, or something? a phantom Charlie whispered in his ear. He bit his lip. Hector didn't seem to find it strange, though, and just nodded. \"So what are you in for?\" \"I drank,\" Maverick said. \"And drove,\" he added, in a sad, sing-songy tone. \"Oh, we all do that,\" said the old man. Maverick dropped his head into his hands and pressed his palms against his eyelids, letting out a sigh. He couldn't help thinking of all the people he was fucking over - Jester, with his quietly ardent, bulldog-like loyalty, who had willingly accepted Maverick as Viper's replacement... And Iceman, whom he infuriated on a daily basis. Iceman, who looked at him like they were the only two people in the world, who forgave his shortcomings and his issues and his bullshit. Maverick wondered how many times he could fuck up before it was one too many. And then Nick, of course. The light of his life. His biggest, most painful regret. He twisted in his seat so the other two in the cell couldn't see him tear up, propped his head up with his elbow and fell into a fitful, drunk, dreamless sleep. / Maverick began to stir hours later at the sound of footsteps. In the darkness there was a creak and a shuffling noise, and a soft band of light fell on his face. He glanced up to see the cop from the front desk shining a flashlight at him. \"Someone's here to fetch your sorry ass,\" he grunted, and stepped aside. Maverick staggered to his feet and out of the cell. It was Iceman, standing in shadow, looking at Maverick with an expression he couldn't quite place. \"Get,\" said the cop, pushing him toward Iceman, who turned on his heel and headed out of the building. He waited until they were out on the pavement before turning to Maverick. \"What the hell is wrong with you?\" Maverick tried to hold himself together, but in that instant the little Dutch boy took his finger off the dam and all hell broke loose. He stood there, choking on his own sobs, tears streaming down his face. Iceman stared at him. Maverick bit down on his tongue and managed to slur, \"I lost Nick.\" Iceman stepped a little closer and hesitantly reached an arm out to him, and then both, and then grabbed him and held him tightly, sliding his hand through Maverick's hair and stroking the back of his neck while Maverick cried into Iceman's chest. \"I'm sorry,\" Iceman murmured quietly, lips brushing Maverick's forehead. Maverick tried to get a hold of himself because fuck , this was embarrassing, but he was so very, very drunk... They stayed like that for at least a few minutes until Iceman cleared his throat, jerked his thumb in the direction of the glass door and said, \"They're going to think we're a couple of homos, Mitchell.\" Maverick gave a hiccup-y laugh and backed off, listing to starboard. All of a sudden his stomach quaked and he turned and was violently ill onto the curb. Coughing, he turned back to Iceman, who wrinkled his nose in disgust. \"Here,\" he said, tossing a handkerchief at him. Maverick wiped his mouth. \"Keep it,\" he added, taking Maverick by the sleeve and dragging him toward his car. Somewhere between the crying and the vomiting Iceman had become all business again, and Maverick had the feeling he was about to get chewed out. They pulled out of the parking lot and into the darkness. Maverick snuck a glance at his watch: it was two in the morning, and there was no one else on the road. Iceman's head was tipped forward at a slight incline and his lips were pursed slightly; Maverick could tell he was forming sentences in his head that would not be said until they had been fully polished and arranged. Before Iceman could speak, Maverick blurted out, \"You think I took the easy way out, don't you? Staying at TOPGUN.\" Iceman didn't look away from the road. His shoulders quirked. \"I didn't. I didn't... I don't think they would've broken my sp - my spirit... like teaching did...\" It was hard to form coherent sentences and even harder to express them. Maverick tried to gather himself. He fixed his gaze on the dashboard. \"I had to do every... everything their way,\" he murmured. \"When I flinal - finally got where I am, I didn't... anymore... I don't think I'm the pilot I was ten years ago.\" Iceman snorted. It wasn't particularly derisive, but it still stung. \"Things just slipped through my fingers.\" He clenched his jaw so as not to cry again, because he knew that Iceman was past holding him, past sympathy. Iceman was quiet for a long time. They were almost out of San Diego before he spoke again. \"Anderson was arrested about six hours ago.\" Maverick jerked to attention. \"What?\" \"The JAGs found evidence on his computer that, uh... suggested he had been the one embezzling funds from us. Someone made an anonymous tip because they suspected he had been taking cash from the government in exchange for getting funding cut for TOPGUN... While they were investigating, they found both.\" Maverick was quiet. \" Someone , huh?\" The ghost of a smirk crossed Iceman's face. \"They're thinking he wasn't the only one involved. In comparison...\" \"A DUI isn't that bad.\" Iceman nodded. \"Are you mad at me?\" Maverick asked, his voice soft. Iceman sighed slowly. \"I get a call at ten o' clock at night... This guy Pete Mitchell's down at the station, he gave us your number, do you want to come get him? I spent thirty minutes thinking maybe I should just leave you there to rot for the night. But I didn't.\" He put his turn signal on. \"Am I mad at you? I think you're an idiot, sure. I think you're a reckless idiot. Fine, you're upset, you made a bad decision - I don't know what went down today and I don't want to know. I just want some stability from you for once. I'm tired of running after you.\" The rest of the trip passed in silence. / They pulled up to Iceman's house in the dead silence of the early hour, inky night broken by the occasional streetlight. Maverick got out gingerly, dimly aware of the fact that he was still in a suit. Iceman helped him inside and let him flop onto the couch like a ragdoll, then put a pot of coffee on and disappeared. Maverick took a moment to glance around. Iceman's decor was as minimalist as ever; it didn't even feel like someone lived there. He tipped his head back, letting his mind wander. Where would he live in Fallon? Was there even anything in Fallon? There was thudding on the stairs and Iceman reappeared, tossing a pair of pajama pants and a shirt that said Fuck Me, I'm German on the front and Octoberfest 1994 on the back at him. Maverick started to strip. He glanced around as he pulled his briefs off to find Iceman sneaking a peek at him. He would have laughed, had it not been for the current circumstances. Nothing ever changed with them, did it? \"Coffee's brewing,\" Iceman said, wandering into the living room area. \"I'm going to bed.\" Maverick got up. \"No. Couch.\" Iceman handed him a quilted blanket. \"But -\" \" Couch ,\" Iceman said sternly, like Maverick was a badly behaved dog. \"Sober up.\" He pinched Maverick's bicep and headed back upstairs. / Maverick jerked awake for the second time that night to the sound of someone screaming. \"Wh -\" he stumbled off of the couch, adrenaline pumping, heading immediately for Iceman's bedroom. Iceman was tangled in his sheets, soaked with sweat, hollering \" please no, God, no, please \", his voice feverish and fearful in an awful and primal way. Maverick had heard him panicked before, had heard him scared as hell and pinned by five MiGs, but he had never heard this before, not even on that first night they'd spent together. This was pure horror. Iceman cracked his head on the headboard as he writhed, still half-buried in sleep, and Maverick made an attempt to grab him and hold him down. It was like trying to grab a salmon. He finally managed to pin Iceman's arms, and Iceman moaned in fear and made a gagging noise. Maverick put more pressure down on him, muscles burning with the effort. Iceman began to quiet. The mask of sleep lifted from his eyes and he lay there, panting and shivering. Maverick took a step back. \"W - wh -\" \"It's just me,\" Maverick said quickly, \"it's just me...\" Iceman rolled over and struggled with the sheets, peeling them off of himself. He was shaking like a leaf. \"Ice.\" Iceman tilted his head like he wasn't quite sure where the sound was coming from. \"Are you okay?\" Iceman reached an arm out to Maverick and pulled him closer. Maverick climbed into the bed next to him. \"Tom -\" He held his hand up and cleared his throat. Maverick tried to steady his own breathing. Iceman sank back down onto his pillow. Maverick noticed for the first time how gray he had gotten around the temples, how deep the line between his eyes was. He slid beneath the covers and reached for Iceman, grabbing his hand, murmuring hey tentatively. Iceman glanced at him. A muscle in his jaw twitched. Maverick didn't know what else to say. He remembered nights of comforting his mother after those two somber soldiers had come to their door with that flag in their hands - we're so sorry for your loss, ma'am - and nights of soothing Nick's nightmares, but Iceman was so far away at that moment. He was on the other side of a gulf, hunkered down with his hands over his ears. He tightened his grip on Iceman's hand. \"I'm here,\" he said firmly. Iceman pulled Maverick closer to him and buried his face in Maverick's shoulder, grabbing a fistful of his shirt, still shaking like he would fall apart. Maverick smoothed a hand over Iceman's hair. \"I'll stay,\" he murmured. / The following morning Maverick woke with a serious case of cottonmouth and a ringing in his ears that turned out to be the telephone. He sat bolt upright and, upon seeing that Iceman was missing, tried to leap out of the bed and went crashing to the floor, tangled in blankets. A moment later Iceman appeared in the doorway, looking exhausted. \"It's Jester,\" he said, handing the phone to him. Maverick fumbled his way out of the sheets and grabbed it. Iceman left the room. \"Hello?\" \"Nice to hear from you, Pete.\" \"Yeah, um, hey, did - did you hear about... last night?\" \"Of course.\" \"Ah.\" \"Listen, with what's going down with Anderson, that's the least of our worries.\" Maverick cleared his throat. \"Okay. Good. That's what - um, how did you know where to find me?\" Jester chuckled. Maverick heard him light a cigarette. \"I'm not as dumb as I look.\" \"Yeah, okay,\" Maverick muttered. \"Listen, I've given you a ration of shit about this, but as it stands, as long as you're not a criminal, I don't give a shit what the two of you do in the privacy of your bedroom. If we make it to Fallon in one piece, it'll be a miracle. Have a good one, kid.\" \"You too,\" Maverick muttered, getting to his feet and pulling his pants back up over his ass. He walked into the kitchen where Iceman was bent over the sink, running water over his palms and staring out the window. \"Hey.\" Iceman wiped his hands off on a dishrag and turned around. Maverick set the phone down on the kitchen table. Iceman jerked his head toward the door to the patio and departed through it. Maverick followed him, his feet chilled through his socks as they hit stone. Iceman settled into one of the peeling, white iron-wrought chairs and beckoned Maverick to him. Maverick, broad-shouldered and clumsily hungover, sat rather awkwardly on his lap. Iceman winced. \"I wish these chairs had cushions,\" he said. He drummed his fingers against Maverick's thigh. \"Did you think about me?\" Maverick blurted out. Iceman tipped his head to the left. \"During all that time. Before... before last May.\" Iceman nodded. \"I gave you some thought,\" he said. \"There were some guys that reminded me of you - young guys, mostly. Nobody quite like you, but it was always in the back of my head.\" \"Why'd you come back?\" \"I was done.\" \"Done with what?\" Iceman stared off into the distance for a minute or so before he spoke. \"Dogfighting.\" \"Did you think about me? When you decided?\" \"Is this twenty questions?\" Iceman snapped. \"I knew you were still working there, yes. Did it factor into my final decision? I can't say. I didn't expect we were going to fuck each other, no. Is that it?\" Maverick fell silent. Iceman let out a beleaguered sigh. \"Sorry,\" he said shortly. Maverick's mouth twitched. \"Fine. I know I push your buttons.\" Iceman snorted and snaked his bad hand around Maverick's waist, flinching when his watch snagged on Maverick's shirt and twisted his wrist. \"Was I a good father?\" Iceman sighed. \"I don't know.\" \"Did I deserve this ?\" \"How can I make that call? You know, I used to think in black and white the way you are now. But I don't know anymore. I don't know. I think Charlie hurt you and I think you're letting that hurt do the talking. It's not about your ego when there's a kid involved.\" Iceman pushed his hair back. \"You don't know a lot of things.\" \"Yeah, it's nice to admit that.\" Maverick's gaze fixed on a tree a good twenty feet away. Iceman's forehead brushed his jaw. \"You need a shave.\" Maverick nodded. \"And a shower. You smell like a brewery.\" But Maverick lingered, missing Nick, and Iceman continued to hold him, licking the wounds he would never let anyone see, and together, they watched the sun come up over the distant ocean. / FIN A/N: Epilogue should be up soon.

That was the only class I'm good at, thanks to Bruce. \"Do you need help with homework?\" Lucy asks. I sit up, defenses in place. \"Maybe. Why would you want to know?\" I reply, nervous. I'm surprised Lucy is even talking to me about this. \"Ms. Neil told me that your grades aren't improving. She suggested that I tutor you after school.\" Lucy explains. \"You're probably to busy to help.\" I say, putting my head back on the desk. I wraps my arm around my head and block the class out. \"No, I can make time.\" Lucy replies. I chuckle, amused. \"That's what all the others said.\" I inform, \"And where are they now? It's just the same now as before.\" BRINGGGGG! \" You can at least let me try,\" Lucy presses, \"are you okay with that?\" \"You sure can try.\" I agree. Lucy giggles a little and goes out of the class. I smack myself on the head. ' Stupid! You could have said something nice!' I tell myself. Then Lucy comes back. \"Is tonight okay? I have free time then.\" Lucy asks poking her head through the doorway. I just nod. \"Great. My dad can pick us up after school.\" Then she leaves for her next class. I take out my phone on the way out. I need to text Bruce to tell him that I'll be late. I have a new tutor. Okay, so this is the Jason I'm going with. He's a bit of an outsider and has a rogue like attitude. But they are in... ninth grade? Something like that. Thanks for reading![Chapter 2] Disclaimer: Lucy is my character, the rest is DC's. Not much to say for this one, slight time gap, the rest of the day is unknown of what happens. \"Okay, what do you want to start with first?\" Lucy asks me. We're in her living room with all of the textbooks and folders splayed out in front of us on the floor. I look them over and pick up the Math folder. \"I have lots of homework to make up from here.\" I admit. He open it up on the coffee table and take out the first assignment. As I get started, Lucy goes to the kitchen. \"I'll make some snacks.\" she offers. \"Don't you have a cook to do that?\" I ask without looking up. \" Your family is rich like Bruce, right?\" \"Yes, but I get my own snacks after school.\" Lucy replies from the kitchen. I hear the fridge open and then a few cupboard. I start speeding through problems. \"So, you said your dad would pick us up. Why didn't he?\" I ask again. \"He said he would. But apparently he had another meeting and sent my nanny, Ms. Nuatcherdux, instead.\" Lucy says, slightly annoyed. \"And, your mom?\" I pry. Lucy comes back over with two plates each with a sandwich, chips, a pickle, and a glass of milk. \"On a business trip, to Asia.\" She answers, setting the plates down. \"Bon a petit.\" \"Can you look this over? I'm almost done.\" I say after taking a bite out of my pickle. Lucy skims over the page, going over every step in the equations. \"Jason, these are right.\" Lucy states, astonished, \"I was away for ten minutes and you got this assignment done, correctly.\" She bites into her sandwich. \"Huh.\" \"What do you mean, 'huh'?\" I ask. \"How do you have bad grades, if you know what you're doing?\" She asks me. I shrug. \"I don't get my homework done on time, as you can see.\" I state, motioning to the floor strewn with papers. \"And I don't get enough sleep at night. That's why I sleep during work time.\" \"Oh, so you only have late homework to turn in. No studying needed?\" Lucy asks. \"Exactly.\" I agree. Lucy thinks for a moment, eating a few chips in the process. \"Well, I think we should start with the assignments that should have been turned in a long time ago and work back from there. Sound good?\" Lucy decides. I nod and start shuffling through the papers. \"Okay, this one. . . this one. . . definitely this one. . .\" I mumble to no one in particular as I sort every other paper in front of me. \"I think these are the ten latest and these,\" I say, heaving the second stack of papers onto the coffee table, \"are the top twenty in the middle.\" \"I'm guessing these left,\" Lucy gestures to the pile left on the blue carpet. \"-are from last week.\" we finish together. \"Jinx!\" I yell first, \"You own me a soda.\" I say, proud. She gets up without hesitation. \"I'll be right back. You start on the Top Ten Latest while I get the 'soda' as you call it.\" Lucy teases. 'So cheeky.' Eleven assignments later, I get stuck. Lucy comes over from her English project because she sees me stare at one paper for at least three minutes. \"Stuck on something?\" She asks looking at the paper. \"Yeah, this is an art project. We were picking a painting to do it on in class. I picked a painting, but I have to look at it to finish the project.\" I explain. \"Which picture did you decide on?\" Lucy asks. \"The one called Starry Night .\" I answer. \"We have that one!\" Lucy tells me. \"Really? Can I see it?\" I reply. \"Yeah. It's in the library.\" Lucy grabs my hand and pulls me towards the hallway. \"Wait,\" I stop her, \"I might have other things I'll need to research for, so. . .\" Lucy catches on and picks up the smaller stack of papers. \"So let's move there.\" She says, setting her plate on top of the papers. I mimic her and follow her through the house. I couldn't have it where Jason isn't smart. He is. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Yes, Lucy is a sweet heart if you haven't noticed. Bad boy/Sweet heart cliche. It happens even to Jason.[Chapter 3] Well, this chapter is not finished. If you have a suggestion, by all means. Disclaimer, again: Lucy is of my creation. Jason and all other things DC belong to... you get my point. -The combination of swirling dark and light can only come from- I write out my essay on Silent Night. It has to be one full sheet of paper long: two full pages. I write and scribble until I believe I can type it out on the computer back home. But I'm not so sure. \"Hey Lucy.\" I ask. She looks up from her book. \"Can you read this? It sounds choppy.\" She walks over and takes the paper. After scanning it, she hands it back. \"It's good. Not choppy at all. Excepting this sentence. You can drop it completely.\" She tells me pointing. \"Thanks.\" I say and start to erase the short sentence. I reread it. 'Sounds better.' She returns to her seat and picks up the yellow book. After about an hour, most of my assignments are complete. I'm putting away my folders, when Lucy snaps her book closed. \"How about a tour? It'll give us a chance to stretch our legs.\" She asks me. I just shrug and follow her out of the library. \"You already saw the foyer, living room, library, and one of the west wing hallways.\" she starts. I walk behind her and look around at what she points out. Using observation skills I've had since I was little, I notice how her house is similar to mine. It's a huge mansion with a garden in the back with a flowers side and a vegetable side. Fruit trees along the edge and a grove here and there of oak and maple. The rooms are arranged like back home, only different wood and designs. Where are study would be, they have a sitting area. The house doesn't have an elevator but lots and lots of stairs. Soon, Lucy has to stop. \"I guess you haven't been to every part of your house in one day.\" I chirp. She nods and sits on the sofa. \"At least not in the time we've spent going around.\" She tells me. I scoff and look at the time. \"I should probably be getting back.\" I say. She nods, sadly. \"Can I come back tomorrow?\" \"Sure. You still need to finish all that work.\" She replies. \"I'll call my driver. He'll give you a ride.\" Done with this chapter! So how is it? Some of the characters have something to say: Damian: CtW needs criticism in her reviews. So do it! Review CtW and tell what's good or bad and other stuff or- Alfred: Young man, you know the rules Master Bruce had set for your, er, habits. Damian: Sorry Alfred. But seriously, CtW wants to become a better writer and reviews will get her there. Jason: Wait, Damian, you aren't even in this story. Why are you here? Damian: Uh...[Chapter 4] Yay! It's out! For those that stick like glue to this story, I love you all! *gives out hugs, kisses, the like* Anyway, next chapter, I own Lucy, who is only mentioned here but whatev. Enjoy! \"Jason,\" Bruce says when I walk past his office. \"Come here.\" I turn around and go through the doors, standing in front of his desk. \"What's up?\" I ask. Bruce motions to a chair. \"Take a seat.\" He waits for me to sit in the armchair, \"Jason your report card came in the mail today.\" I start to move, but my guardian holds his hand up. \"Your worst grade is a B-. That tutor of yours has paid off.\" \"Thanks, Bruce. But she would say that I had to just get the schoolwork in.\" \"She? What's her name?\" \"Lucy Blake.\" Bruce nods. \"Yes, I know her parents. Wonderful young lady so I've heard.\" \"Um, Bruce?\" \"Yes, Jason?\" I fidget in my seat. \"Well, due to my extracurricular activity, my grades are just going to drop again.\" Bruce gives me his full attention. \"What do you propose?\" \"That Lucy becomes my study partner?\" I try. Bruce chuckles lightly. \"Jason, that isn't something to be ashamed of. Yes, she can be your study partner. If she wants to. Is she, nice?\" \"Yes, we are lab partners and paired up together a lot for classes… I'd be going to her house a lot after school.\" \"That's alright, as long as you don't stay too long. And she doesn't start prying.\" \"Don't worry sir, I won't tell her,\" I promise. \"You should invite her over sometime. I'd like to thank her for keeping you on track.\" \"I'll ask.\" Quite short, just a filler. The next one will be much longer. Now, if you don't know Jason, you'll want to pay attention to the next one. Reviews! Lots! Just to say how many readers have been waiting! Just to hear remarks like, 'I've been waiting since two Valentine's Days ago, but I'm still here.' Are just what I need. Bye![Chapter 5] Skipping to one of their study sessions. This is more revolved around his past. Disclaimer: Don't own Jason or his past. I'm going off of what I know. I try to focus on the science worksheet in front of me, but I can't. I'm usually so focused with this class. But something else grabs my attention. I shake my head to clear it. I don't want Lucy to see I'm feeling, off . \"Uh, Lucy?\" She looks up from her side of the kitchen table. \"Can you help me with this?\" She looks puzzled that I need help with Science. But she comes over anyway. \"Okay, let's see...\" she starts explaining the periodic table, but I've zoned out. Only one thought fills my head, pushing all else to the back of my mind. I walk down the street, on high alert. You never know what might happen. I reach my alley right when I hear, \"There's the punk!\" I run. I leap over trash cans, knocking them over for my pursuers to trip on. I climb up the fire escape with practiced ease. The group of guys I stole from weren't agile enough to catch me. They almost did two streets down. But the chase was worth it. I stole a cupcake. Chocolate, Mommy's favorite. Whenever I brought her one, she'd stop taking drugs. When she felt like popping something, she'd eat some of the chocolate instead. I didn't tell her I'd get one. I want to surprise her; It'll be her birthday Saturday. \"Jason, are you okay?\" I come out of my daze and see Lucy had taken a chair next to me. \"Yeah, where are we?\" I ask. \"I was showing you how the columns and rows were arranged,\" She states. I nod, distracted. \"Okay, thank you. I remember.\" A tear involuntarily forms. I pick up my pencil and try to answer a question. Columns are each of the families of- The tear drops. \"Jason, is something wrong?\" She asks. I sniff. \"What makes you think something is wrong?\" I ask back. There are now five wet spots on my paper, and counting. \"I've never seen you cry before. It must be something important,\" She states. I wipe my eyes. \"I'm not crying,\" I lie. \"Yes you are.\" \"No, no I'm not.\" \"What's wrong?\" I don't answer, tears streaming down my face. 'I'm fourteen! Born in the heart of Gotham for Pete Sake! And I'm bawling in front of the hottest girl in school!' \"Do you want to talk about it?\" \"I'm fine, okay,\" I answer, shakily. 'What am I going to without her? Without-' I push my chair back, hearing it slam on the floor behind me. \"Jason!?\" Lucy calls after me as I round the bend and sprint down the hall. I hear her footsteps following me. So I pick the closest bathroom and lock myself inside. I crouch next to the pristine toilet as my tears multiply. I think of what happened those years ago. \"Mommy?\" I ask as I climb through the window. I don't use the front door anymore. The man who owns the building is mean to me. \"Mommy,\" I repeat. I walk through the kitchen/living room part of the apartment. I briefly look at the only picture of her and me. I wrote 'Mommy' under her. That is my affectionate name for her. Just like she calls my her, 'strong baby' or 'sweet boy.' I love her nicknames. \"I have a surprise for you. I know you're going to love it.\" I look in the bedroom we share. Both the bed and the mattress on the floor are empty. \"Are you in the bathroom?\" I ask as I stand outside the door. Nok nok nok \"Jason? What's wrong? You can tell me.\" I can answer her question in my thoughts. 'You don't want to know. Not like I'd tell you. I don't want to lose my only friend, so I won't.' Lucy jiggles the knob. Nok nok nok \"Jason unlock the door, please?\" I stand up and move to the sink. The mirror shows a scared little boy. I wait about five minutes, the little cake behind my back. I knock on the door again. \"Mommy.\" No one answers. I try to turn the knob, but it's locked. \"I know you're in there.\" I tease. Nothing happens. \"Well, I guess I'm going to have to eat this chocolate cupcake all by myself.\" I say loud and slow. Nothing happens, absolutely nothing. Usually she would rush to me at the sound of that word. 'Maybe she isn't home.' I think. I look in the living room. Her shoes are here. I start to panic. \"Mom?\" I ask, dropping the kid-ish name. \"Where are you? This isn't funny.\" I try to open the bathroom door again. But even with the busted lock, it won't open. I get a knife from the kitchen to unlock it. But it doesn't work, then I remember the window. I climb up onto the ledge on the outside of the building. Being careful, I make my way to the window of our bathroom. The curtains are down so I can't see anything. I open the always unlocked window and go in feet first. My belly gets scraped by the bent metal lock on the sill. My feet settle in the tub and I close the window after my head is through. \"Mom, you won't believe what I got y-\" I turn around. She's splayed out on the floor. Her face is facing the door, away from me. Her hand is wrapped around a bottle of pills. 'She passed out again.' I step around the pills that spilled out of the orange container. I walk to the sink and take the cup from the floor. The water doesn't work. 'Forgot to pay the water bill.' I assume. I unlock the door and walk over to where I left the cake. 'A whiff of that and she'll perk right up.' Lucy jiggles the knob again. \"Are you sure you don't want to talk about it?\" I look away from my soggy reflection and breathe in a sharp breath. 'How could I not see? I was so stupid.' \"I'm going to get the key, alright? I'll be right back.\" I look up suddenly. 'She can't see me like this.' I look at the window. 'And she won't.' I open it and climb down. Her family has circles of big trees all throughout the yard. I pick one to my right. I run there and lean against a trunk so I'm not in the sight of the house. The cupcake is right next to her nose, yet she doesn't smell it. In fact, her nose doesn't flare from breath. And her mouth is closed. I watch her chest, but fail to see it rise and fall. Her face is ashen. \"Mom?\" I ask. \"Mom, wake up.\" I take hold of her free hand. It's cold to the touch. I check and recheck all the signs. But everything points like a neon sign in front of the bar across the street. \"Mom! Wake up!\" I don't know how to do CPR. I've only heard of it. \"No! Nononono! No, you can't leave me!\" I start crying. \"Come back! Mom!\" I reach behind me and pick up the cupcake I abandoned. \"I brought you a cupcake. See?\" I show it to her vacant eyes. \"Chocolate, your favorite… Mom.\" I nudge her. \"Mom!\" I shake her. \"MOM!\" \"Jason?\" I tense up and peek around the tree. Lucy is standing there with my bag on her shoulder. 'She came?' \"How did you know I was here?\" I ask. \"You were screaming.\" She says. She walks around the tree and drops my backpack next to me. \"I was going to unlock the door. I thought you'd want tissues.\" She hands me the box. I take it and use one. 'Here's the part where she walks away and leaves me be forever.' But instead, she sits down. \"Go away,\" I sniff. \"Actually, I don't have to. This is my family's house. But I'm not going to tell you to leave,\" She counters. \"What do you want?\" I ask. \"To understand. A friend is hurt and I want to help. If you don't let me in I can't.\" \"My past friends and tutors didn't want anything to do with me when they knew,\" I inform, starting another tissue. \"Have I been like other tutors? Or friends you've known?\" She asks. \"I promise it will be different this time.\" I wipe my tears, take a few deep breaths, and decide to tell her. \"My mom died two years ago, on this day.\" I look up from the dirt to see her shocked face. \"Just two days before her birthday,\" I continue, choking on my tears. Lucy slowly comes over, but refrains from contact. \"It's been two years without her,\" I repeat. I lean against her. \"Was that so hard?\" She asks. \"I'm sorry, I didn't know.\" She consoles. \"Wait, Mr. Wayne was married?\" I burn with fury from her stupid question. I break away and stand up. \"No!\" I screech, \"No he didn't! Mr. Wayne isn't my real dad. He took me in !\" I shake from pent up emotions. I don't care if she knows anymore. 'Let her run like the rest of them!' \"My name is Jason Todd ! My real dad was never around! He was a criminal !\" I yell, \"He might be dead or rotting in Blackgate for all I care! And I don't! Because he left my mom and me alone with nothing!\" I scoff at the irony of the conversation turning back to my mother. \"Speaking of which, she was addicted to drugs. She died from an overdose. I loved her, the one person I loved, and she left me too. I took care of her at age twelve and she left me. She thought life wasn't worth living.\" \"You lived near Crime Alley?\" I look up, shocked. There was no resentment in her voice. 'But she'll crack. They all do.' \"Yes, for my whole life right down to when Mr. Wayne found me trying to steal his tires. That is how I survived, Lucy. I stole .\" Lucy doesn't respond. My back is now to her. 'Did she leave?' I think, not turning around. 'Did I scare her?' I don't hear anything. 'Good.' I turn to get my backpack and see she's still there, holding a tissue. 'Wait, why's she crying?' \"Well?!\" I ask, my anger returning. \"Just leave already!\" \"I'm sorry.\" She says, dabbing her eyes. 'What?' \"Why?\" \"Because you went through all that. Your parents, no matter who they were, are gone. You had to do things against the law to live. And I thought I'd understand, that it would be some trivial first world problem I could fix with a tissue box and a hug. But it's more than that. It's your past,\" She explains. I take in what she said. \"You don't think I'm terrible?\" I ask. She shakes her head. \"That is the past, Jason. I don't judge on that. No one should. A true friend wouldn't.\" 'A true friend.' After a length of silence, I crumble to the ground. She scoots over and hugs me. \"Um, I'm going to her grave today. If you want, you could come with.\" I ask, timid. \"Oh, I wouldn't want to intrude.\" Lucy declines. \"But,\" I plead, \"I'd like you to be there.\" I slowly take her hand, \"I'm sorry for yelling.\" She nods. \"Okay Jason, I'll come.\" Okay, the memory with his mom is my imagination. I cried when writing this. I think... It's been a while. Anyway, who loves Lucy? I DO![Chapter 6] Here's the next one. Short and Sweet. Disclaimer: Lucy is mine. She's wonderful, sweet pure, and my character. Not DC's. Although DC propabably wished they thought of her. (LUCY'S POV) Jason sinks to the ground. I kneel down next to him. I honestly don't care if my dark blue skirt gets muddy. Jason starts crying again, so I lightly touch his shoulder. When he looks at me, I offer him a tissue. He takes it. \"Hey Mom. I miss ya.\" He starts, trying to subside the tears so he can talk. \"This is a friend of mine, Lucy… She knows about you, Dad, the Alley. And she's okay with it.\" He pauses to wipe his eyes and blow his nose, \"My first real friend Mom. My grades are better too, all because of Lucy.\" We sit there silently in front of the stone with a crude chocolate bar picture engraved below her name. I didn't know Jason didn't have any friends. True, I never saw him with anyone at school before. I figured he had some outside of school. I feel a surge of honor being granted that title. \"I shouldn't get credit for his grades.\" Jason looks at me in surprise, \"Jason is smart on his own.\" I admit to the simple stone, \"You'd be proud of him.\" After a moment, we stand up. Jason stays facing the grave. \"I love you, Mom.\" He says. We turn to go back to the car. My nanny drops him off at Wayne Manor. I'm driven home. On the way, I get an idea. (JASON'S POV) Two days after Lucy and I visited Mom, I go back to celebrate her birthday. I bring with me a bouquet of wild flowers. I did it every year, even the last one. It's a tradition for her birthday. She'd put them in a cup, but forget to put water with them. When I arrive, I see another person has been here first. There's a few white lilies lying right below the stone. An open letter leans against my terrible drawing I made under Mom's name. It says: \"Happy Birthday Mrs. Todd! In my family, we have a tradition. We each send a letter to a loved one on their special day. Jason loves you and I love Jason. So this is mine to you. Well, I don't know much about you, so I love that you brought Jason into the world. If you didn't, I wouldn't have known him. He's special to me. Thank you. I think your favorite flower is a marigold. And your favorite flavor is chocolate. My favorites are marble roses and butter cream. I'm so glad I met you, - Lucy\" I read the signature again. Lucy wrote it. I'm touched. I lay my flowers on the dirt, right where Mom could smell them. \"Hi Mom. Happy Birthday. I see Lucy came by.. Mom, she's so sweet and caring. No one at school has been that way to me,\" I tell her. \"I've only known her for half a school year, but, Mom? Would you approve?\" I know she's gone, but I still wait for an answer. 'Yes, Jason,' I hear in my thoughts, 'I know she has a place in your heart.' It sounded like Mom. A smile spreads across my cheeks. \"Thanks Mom.\" I scramble to stand up. \"I hope you like the flowers. But I can't stay right now.\" I start off, yelling over my shoulder, \"I got to go Lucy I love her!\" as I run to the gate. Their love in bloom. I like how Jason acts like a child when he's around his mom, dead or alive. He's, uh, fourteen here.[Chapter 7] See what I mean? I needed one chapter to be posted, and now, here I am, getting the ones after it on here faster than you can read them! *Smiles like an idiot* I'm so happy. (LUCY'S POV) \"Ms. Lucy, your friend Jason is at the door,\" Ms. Nuatcherdux says, \"I've taken the liberty of letting him in.\" \"Thank you,\" I reply, putting my book down. I see a particular glow in her face. I can't place it. \"I'll put some cookies in the oven. You two will be hungry,\" She says, patting her skirt down. \"Mr. Todd is in the parlor.\" I walk through the quiet halls. As I get closer, I hear someone mumbling to themselves. I pause right before the doorless entrance to listen. \"Lucy- um, would you like t- no no no… You see, uh, I got these w- no, that's cheesy,\" Jason mutters. I sigh and step into view. \"Hello Jason,\" I greet. He turns around. He isn't wearing his usual t-shirt, jeans, and sneakers. Instead, he's wearing a nice polo shirt, slacks, and brown dress shoes. He's holding a bouquet of roses and an envelope. \"Lucy, uh,\" he looks at the flowers, nervous, \"I bought these for you.\" He hands me them. \"I heard they were your favorite.\" \"Really? From who?\" I ask, curious. \"Mom,\" He answers. I nod and smile. 'He saw my letter.' \"Her favorite flowers aren't marigolds, but you were close. And she loved chocolate.\" \"Well thank you.\" I smell the pink and cream petals. He hesitates a moment, then hands me the envelope. \"I thought, since it was showing tonight, um,\" I open it up, displaying two tickets, \"we could go watch that movie you've been thinking about.\" \"You want to watch Rush of the River?\" I inquire. I know Jason hates movies like that. \"No,\" he says, taking a few steps closer, \"I want to go somewhere with you.\" I blush. \"I want to go out with you, Lucy.\" \"Okay,\" I peek at the showing time, \"yeah, 7:30 pm. I can do that.\" I look up at him beaming in his silly outfit. \"But you can go as yourself.\" Jason looks down at what he's wearing. \"Alfred picked it. It's his attempt at humor, I guess.\" \"Well, his attempt was a success,\" I say, giggling, \"You look pretty funny,\" I admit. \"Will you still go with me?\" He asks. I nod. \"So, what do you want to work on?\" I ask. He thinks. \"We have that physics worksheet to finish,\" Jason suggests. \"I have a better idea,\" I say. I lead him out into the main room. We swerve from the stairs and make a pit stop at the kitchen. \"Bring the cookies to the library,\" I tell Ms. Nuatcherdux. \"As you wish.\" \"And I'll be going to the movies tonight,\" I add. \"Yes miss.\" We climb the stairs. \"What will we be doing?\" Jason asks. \"Something I need a partner for,\" I answer cryptically. I walk into the library and pick up my script. \"Drama.\" They're going on a date! YAY! Stay tuned![Chapter 8] Date Time! That movie, Rush of the River, doesn't exist. FYI. We walk out the theater doors and into the concessions/ticket area. Jason is at my side, holding my hand. I'm finishing off the second large pop he bought us. \"I have to use the restroom,\" He says, apologetic, \"Wait right here. I'll be back in a minute.\" I stand by the drinking fountain. It's only a minute, I'll be fine. We did drink a lot of pop. Just then, a group of guys in masks walk into the theater. \"Everybody down!\" One yells. He holds his gun to the ceiling and fires a few shots. All the patrons, myself included, crouch by the floor. I count four guys, each has a gun. One starts walking over to me, eyeing my bracelet. Two doors slam. \"Did someone start a party?\" Everyone looks to the entrance. \"I think I lost my invitation.\" It's Robin, the boy wonder. He had barged through the doors, batarangs out. The closest guy to Robin turns his revolver at the hero. But said hero throws one of his projectiles before the thug has a chance to pull the trigger. It lodges itself in the barrel and explodes. Robin flips over to him and kicks him below his chin. He falls over, unconscious. \"K.O!\" Robin yells. The second masked man pulls out a knife, even though there's a pistol on his hip. He swipes it at Robin a few times. Robin dodges all of them and catches his arm. He twists it. The goon yelps and falls to the floor, holding his injured arm. Two bullets go past Robin. The man by me and his partner fire round after round at the young hero. He has to flip and somersault to avoid a storm of bullets. But not long after, the guns run empty. \"You guys have lousy aim,\" Robin remarks as he punches one and kicks the other. They both go down. Then, we all see red and blue lights through the front glass. A dozen officers come in, guns at ready. But all four intruders are either out or in pain. Robin is standing above the one with the arm injury. \"Their all yours gentlemen.\" \"Everyone okay?\" an officer asks. Other moviegoers are starting to stand up. I follow their lead, shakily. I lean against the water fountain, trying to calm down. An officer sees me and makes his way through the crowd. \"Miss? Are you alright?\" He asks. \"Um, Y-Yes. I just feel, a little-\" \"We've called an ambulance. You need to sit down.\" \"S-Someone I know is in the bathroom. If I'm not here when he gets back-\" \"Lucy?\" I look up and see Jason, his front soaked. \"What happened here? I heard gunshots and-\" I pull him down and hug him. \"I'll leave you two alone,\" The officer says. I feel Jason's chin move on my shoulder. \"I can take care of her,\" He replies. Jason peels my arms off of him. \"Lucy, your shaking. What happened?\" \"There were these men in masks, they had guns. One came toward me. Oh Jason I was so scared.\" I bury my face in his soggy shirt. \"Sh sh sh, it looks to be over now… I'm here,\" He says. He rubs circles on my back, calming me. \"Better?\" He asks. I nod. \"Well,\" Commissioner Gordon, who came in after the officers, declares, \"no one got hurt and the men are in custody. Thanks-\" He turns, but Robin had disappeared. \"What happened to you Jason?\" I ask. \"I was stuck in the bathroom being attacked by a killer sink,\" He jokes. \" Enough about me. Are you okay now? No one hurt you right?\" He asks, helping me stand. \"I'm okay,\" I reply, glancing at the open doors, \"Thanks to Robin.\" Jason calls Alfred and they drop me off at home. Well, that was a little spill of action. That's all for now. The next one I need to finish writing out in the same spot. I got chunks everywhere! But that's enough to keep you all satisfied right?[Chapter 9] One of the chunks I talked about. Second part is coming up soon. I just didn't want it all here. (JASON'S POV) I step out of the car and open Lucy's door for her. We walk into school together. It has been a few weeks. Each weekend, I took Lucy out on another date, finding places where what happened at the theater won't happen again. I took her to dinner, to the park, another movie, and now we are officially a couple. We walk down the hallway and stop at her locker first. I watch her place a picture we took in her mirror side. Someone down the hall laughs a little too loud. \"Mark's coming,\" She says as we start to my locker, closer to Homeroom. \"Who's Mark?\" \"My ex-boyfriend,\" She says. As we walk by the broad football jock, he shoves his shoulder into me. \"Sorry, Wayne ,\" He says, ice lacing the apology. 'So that's Mark.' I stop, considering my options. \"Jason, don't. It isn't worth it,\" Lucy tells me. I nod and we continue away from him. After school, we decided to walk to Wayne Manor to study. I had the books in my bag as she held onto the notebooks in hers. I don't mind, heh, I suggested it. But as we were walking past the Gotham Park, Mark and some of his buddies were following us. I start to walk a little faster, not wanting trouble for Lucy's sake. But they see and catch up to us. \"Wayne,\" Mark snarls. I turn, right into a punch. I fall to the pavement, wiping my mouth. \"Get up. Do you think you can just take my girl?\" \"I'm not your girl anymore Mark! Just leave us alone!\" Lucy counters. I stand up. \"I'm not fighting you,\" I say. He chuckles. \"Really?\" He punches me again. This time I stumble back. \"Yeah really. C'mon Lucy. Let's get back to the Manor, away from these jerks.\" Mark looks at me, furious. \"What did you just call me?\" I turn back. \"A. Jerk.\" I grab Lucy's hand. \"Run.\" We dash down the sidewalk. \"Come back here coward!\" Mark yells. \"Into the trees,\" I direct. We disappear into the Gotham Park Forest. We slow down and walk through the shrubs. \"You can't hide in there forever!\" Mark yells behind us. \"Jason, where are we going?\" \"A short cut. The North Side of the forest is closer to the Manor. I know where I'm going,\" I reply. \"Okay, I trust you.\" \".. So, Mark-\" \"He picked fights with everything that threatened his dominance, including me,\" Lucy says, disgusted. \"I see why you left him,\" I comment. Suddenly, there's a break in the trees. I look through. It's a good sized expanse of grass. \"I thought you knew where you were going.\" \"I guess we got off track. But I can tell where North is.\" Lucy looks through. \"Jason, do you see that?\" Roughly in the center of the grass, there's a cottage. It's covered in vines and the garden surrounding it is overgrown with weeds. \"It's beautiful,\" she says, letting go of my hand. She steps through and walks to the house. \"Lucy wait.\" I climb out and catch up. \"Someone could be living here.\" \"You think?\" She asks, \"It doesn't look like anyone's been here in ages.\" She goes to the door. It's sealed shut by vines. She tries to move it, but it won't budge. \"Here, let me.\" I throw my weight against it. It moves a little. \"One more time.\" I fall to the floor as it moves forward. Lucy gasps in awe. \"It looks like from out of a book,\" she says. I look up from my spot on the floor. \"It's dirty.\" Papers are strewn everywhere, dust collects in every inch of space, and there's a crack in the kitchen wall. The door opens up into the kitchen with a doorless opening leading to a living room. Lucy steps in and I get up to follow her. \"Jason, this could be our place,\" she says, excited. No one has been here in several years. And no one seems to know about it. I smirk. \"Yeah, our place.\" \"Let's fix it up.\" Mark, might see him again. Reviews are wonderful! (just saying...)[Chapter 10] Now they get to clean up a little *shudders* Good luck you two. The cabin is not real in DC either. We find our way to the North side of the forest, marking our way as we go. At the Manor, we sneak some of Alfred's with us. Well, he let us; he sees everything. We make it back and getting working. \"I'll pick up the papers and books.\" \"Okay, I got the kitchen,\" Lucy says, taking the broom and a box of wipes. I look at the titles of the books; they are all on botany or biology. 'You'd think Poison Ivy lived here,' I muse, collecting them into piles to throw later. \"We could use this place for homework. Of course we'll have to say before hand of where we'll be.\" \"Yeah at the park. And we could have lunch here. That way Mark can't barge in,\" I add. \"Drama practice.\" \"Candle lit dinners.\" She looks at me quizzically. I shrug. \"I'm hungry.\" Lucy finishes the kitchen to the best of her ability and the tools she had and begins to sweep the wood where the books had once occupied. \"How was it in there?\" I ask, referring to the kitchen. \"Who ever lived here loved their spaghetti,\" she comments. I move the bookshelf to reach behind it. When I dust it, I discover it is brown, not the thick coat of gray. \"The books had plants in it. Weird combination.\" \"For someone that wanted to live in a forest away from people, in a city full of people? They would have to be crazy.\" \"We are going to need a trash bin. All the books are mold filled or useless.\" \"The food is also about five or six years old. Forget the bin, we need a dumpster,\" she corrects. \"That's disgusting,\" I say, moving the bookshelf back. \"Speaking of disgusting, should I tackle the bathroom, or would you rather do the honors?\" \"Go right ahead, Jason. I'll pick up here.\" The kitchen and the living room were as clean as we could make them when we left, along with the bathroom. We get back to the Manor right as dusk was falling. \"Yes Ms. Nautcherdux, she's here. Yes… I see it is dark out. She can stay the night… Thank you for understanding.\" Bruce hangs up the phone. \"Lucy can stay.\" \"I'll show her to her room,\" I offer. \"Be back down after,\" Bruce says. We start up the stairs. I lead her to a guest room. \"Mine is across the hall,\" I tell her. She goes to the window. \"Do you think there's a bedroom in the place?\" She asks randomly. \"Sure, probably on the second level,\" I say. We both stand at the window, my arm around her waist. \"Can we bring food tomorrow? Like a picnic?\" She looks up at me. \"I'm still hungry.\" She chuckles and kisses my cheek. \"Sure.\" \"Good night.\" \"'Night.\" I leave and go downstairs. Bruce needs me. They have the cabin now. Just a quick excerpt at that. They do finish that up. But I want to continue with their relationship. But, the next one is a short, special day for a certain, special person in Jason's life...[Chapter 11] The special person in Jason's life: Alfred! (Some of you thought I'd say a past girlfriend, didn't you? ) For R, a guest reviewer: I'll get to it. I just haven't gotten to that point yet. I'm setting it up. But don't worry, he'll become Red Hood. (Otherwise I'd better change the title) And thank you! It helps to know it's alright to cry when writing. If someone didn't, then either A. They have no heart, or B. the story isn't actually sad. (JASON'S POV) Lucy and I are sitting in the living room of Wayne Manor. Alfred walks in, turning their heads. \"Are in need of anything, sir?\" He asks. \"No thank you, Alfred. The show will be on soon.\" \"Very good, sir.\" The butler leaves. Lucy looks at the door, then turns to me. She shows me a letter. \"For me?\" I ask, taking it. On the other side, it's addressed to Alfred Pennyworth. \"No silly, it's Alfred's birthday,\" Lucy whispers. \"Really? It's..\" I go through my mental calendar. \"Ohh..\" I realize. Lucy giggles at my expression. \"This is my birthday letter for him. But I don't know where to put it.\" \"There's one spot he will always check,\" I say, \"the mail .\" Lucy lightly punches me. \"A special place, doofus… Hm, maybe the garden?\" Lucy thinks, \"Oh! I got it.\" (ALFRED'S POV) I walk into the kitchen. Master Jason is sitting at the counter, reading for English class. \"Alfred?\" \"Yes, sir?\" I ask. \"Can you get my bookmark from the parlor? I forgot it when I came to get a snack.\" \"I'll get it for you sir.\" \"Thank you.\" I walk to the parlor and search for the bookmark. \"Alfred!\" Master Jason yells, \"I found it! My bad!\" \"You're very welcome sir!\" I pick up the bookmark. On the other side, it says, 'Take the day off.' (LUCY'S POV) \"Jason, can you get the eggs?\" I ask, measuring out the milk. \"Sure.. Where are they?\" I laugh. \"The fridge! Can't you cook?\" \"No,\" Jason says, searching the fridge, \"I have Alfred.\" \"And when he's gone..\" I start, \"you'd be lost.\" \"Basically.\" We are trying to bake some cupcakes before Alfred comes back from his day off. \"Do you think he'll want a present?\" \"'Your well wishes are gift enough,'\" Jason mimics. \"I don't know what he'd want anyhow.\" \"Yeah, 'cause he's got everything,\" I tease, flicking flour at him. He yelps. \"What? Don't want white hair?\" I ask, flicking more. \"No! I'll wait until I'm older,\" he protests, dusting it out of his dark hair. \"Aw, I think it's cute. Eggs.\" Jason hands them to her. \"Eggs, milady.\" We finish the cupcakes and clean up our mess as best we can. (3RD PERSON) When Alfred comes home, he finds a few cupcakes on a plate, a streaked with flour and eggs kitchen, and Lucy's letter. \"Happy Birthday Alfred,\" Jason says. Alfred receives a hug. \"Lucy sends her regards also. She had to go home.\" \"Thank you, Master Jason. Now go, Master Bruce is in need of you.\" Jason and dates. Sigh. Okay, short, fluffy, and not really in the story. I am definitely going through this when it is done to edit, revise, and CHANGE SO IT MAKES SENSE! *takes a few deep breathes* I'm not liking how it is a mess. The next parts (After he you-know-what) are going to be more structured, since it will be an actual story line.[Chapter 12] Another short, sweet, and non needed chapter. PS, if someone really wants me to think this over because it makes zero sense, I will try to get to it, before school is over. Disclaimer: I own Lucy... yeah, that's it. (LUCY'S POV) I wait in the diner the next morning. I've been waiting for at least five minutes. I check the clock as he comes in. \"Jason you're la-\" I look at him and stop in my tracks. He has a few bruises and an inch long red line on his cheek. \"What happened?\" I ask. I get up and gently frame his face with my hands. \"A minor mugging. I'll be okay,\" He explains. I order an ice pack. \"No, Lucy, it doesn't even hurt.\" We sit down in the booth. \"Was it Mark again?\" \"No, I didn't know them.\" I take the ice pack and set it on his cheek. Jason touches my wrist and guides it away. \"It isn't as bad as it looks.\" He assures. \"Just let me do this and I'll forget you were late,\" I bargain. He looks at me with amusement. \"Oh, alright. But don't do a full on search on me,\" he teases. I press the ice to his cheek again. He orders what he wants to the waitress. I order a plate of french toast. 'How many times has this happened? He sounds as if it has happened before. Of course he's Bruce Wayne's son, but that doesn't mean he'd be mugged a lot. And wouldn't he know how to defend himself?' He sees my concern come through as I think over this. \"Lucy, I'm alright.\" \"Okay,\" I say, finishing my food. \"Are you done? I want to get to the cabin.\" \"Of course, milady,\" he teases. (JASON'S POV) 'Whew, that was a close one. Lucy can't know where I was last night. Good thing there are so many muggings in Gotham.' I don't want to say where he's been and who- what he's been up to until she finds out.. hehe, foreshadowing. For the edit thing, I'm thinking of having the first third (these chapters) be a one shot pre story to the real deal. So I'd have it on a separate thing. Or, most of the first third. I'm not done with it yet and there are a few in the end that are crucial. What do you think about that?[Chapter 13] Yeah, I'm really considering the prequel thing. But, this is the last of the before-importance-stuff. Next chapter will actually be apart of the RHhaH storyline. Enjoy, I had to do this! (JASON'S POV) The morning is upon me with a blast of light from the open curtains. Since they are closer, I draw the covers over my head. \"Happy Valentines Day, Master Jason,\" Alfred says, opening my closet for me. I sit up in bed. That's right. It's Valentines Day. I got to do something for Lucy. I dart out of bed and pat Al on the shoulder on my way past him. \"Thanks Al,\" I say as he grunts. \"You are very welcome sir.\" I eat, get dressed, and pack my bag whilst deciding what to do. I have the hour I usually would ignore the light to get ready. But that still won't be enough time. So I sit down at my desk and draw up a letter to Lucy. It says to meet me at the cottage at six. I stress that she can't be there before six and seven would be even better. I lick the envelope and seal it with a heart. \"Happy Valentines Day,\" I say aloud, writing the words on the front. She loves letters. I set it in my bag. I hear Bruce outside my door. I catch him on the stairs. \"Hey Bruce.\" \"Jason, you're up early.\" \"It's Valentines Day. Can I get Lucy something?\" I plead. He looks at me. \"You do have your allowance,\" He reminds. \"But that won't be enough,\" I beg. \"Come on, I only get, what, thirty dollars per week? That isn't enough Bruce and you know that. I need to get flowers, candles, sweets, a present or two, I'm thinking it will be formal so I'll need a tux, rose petals, a romantic CD-\" \"Alright Jason. Just do three things for me.\" Bruce says. I listen in. \"One, don't spend all my money on this girl. Two, you can use Dick's tux from when he was your age. Three,\" he leans in close, \"Make her night special. Don't have it be traditional. Make it a night she will remember and treasure.\" I nod. \"I'll have Alfred get that tux ready for you.\" He takes out his wallet and hands me a credit card. \"Remember favor number one.\" \"Don't use it all. Got it,\" I say. Alfred drives me to school a few minutes later. We drive past the expensive stores with a half an hour to spare. I look at the store fronts. \"Alfred, pull in here,\" I tell the butler/chauffeur. He proceeds to parking at the gown store. \"Wait here okay.\" \"Happy to oblige sir,\" Is his reply. I walk through the fancy doors of Ze French Stitch , staring at the various dresses. Someone arrives, hearing the bell ring. \"'Allo.\" She says in a french accent. \"Welcome. How may I serve you?\" I look around. \"Hey, I'm looking for a dress for my girlfriend.\" \"Does she 'ave one in mind?\" I shake my head. \"Okay, what kind of dress aah you looking for?\" \"Well a party gown, like for prom. Not long, but not skimpy,\" I describe. She nods the whole time. \"Does she 'ave a favorite calor?\" \"Not really.\" \"What daus she look like?\" \"Golden hair that comes to her shoulders if not just past and eyes like chocolate.\" I describe. \"About,\" I think, \"5 foot 6 inches,\" I decide. She nods so wide, I think she was bowing. \"Good good, wonderful. Follow me.\" I walk down a few rows of gowns. She takes me to the way back. \"Wait here,\" She chirps. I stand at the wall as she goes through a door. I stand for a few minutes then look at a few dresses nearby. They were pretty, but none of them would be for Lucy. I walk down an aisle I haven't been down. It has all golden dresses. They would clash with her hair. I walk along the right side wall, where green and blue dresses sat on sewing forms. I set my eyes on a short green dress. I finger its tulle skirt. \"Ah, here we aah,\" the attendant says, coming back. \"Sir?\" \"Oh, over here,\" I direct, still looking at the dress. It has a green sequined bodice and silver shoulder straps and ribbon at the waist. The multilayer skirt stops before it touches the knee. \"So, 'zis one is abzalootly ta die fo',\" she says, showing me a bright red dress that had a low cut neck line. I cringe at the price. Way too much for me. \"Um, what about this one?\" I ask, point to the green dress. \"'Zat one es one oof a kind. But you aah za costoomer.\" She takes it off the dress form and holds it out to me. I finger the tulle with a dusting of glitter on it. \"Perfect.\" \"Zis es ze oonly size,\" She says. \"Nono, it will fit.\" We go to the register. \"Hey um, can you drop it off at this address by about say, two o'clock?\" I take out a card with the Wayne Manor info on it and two hundred bucks. \"Please?\" She takes both. \"I'll arrange eet,\" She whispers. \"Thank you.\" I pay for the dress and a pair of silver shoes to go with it. \"Find everything alright?\" Alfred asks as I get back in the car. I sigh. \"Yes. Today is going to be perfect. Now to the bakery.\" In a few minutes, I'm standing in front of cakes, describing a cake to the head baker. \"So, a butter cream cake?\" I nod. \"Chocolate whipped frosting?\" I nod again. \"And for two people.\" \"Yes but, I want it to be special. The strawberries on top need to be poking out of the cake, not just resting on top. And the coconut is along the side as hearts.\" \"Would you like any words on it?\" I tell him the rest of the details and pay for the cake in advance. \"It will be there at eleven or noon at the latest. You will have your cake.\" \"My butler will be there to get it,\" I inform. He nods, satisfied that another customer came. Finally, I arrive at school. Right after school I go to the flower shop. I buy a bunch of roses. I don't just get red ones. I buy pink, white, yellow, and purple in marble shades, just as she likes them. I call Al to come pick me up. I take the flowers to the parlor and leave them in a vase so they don't flatten. Alfred brings the cake from the kitchen. \"Hey Al? Can you help me pack a picnic?\" I ask. \"Going to that secret place I know nothing of, sir?\" \"Yes, Al,\" I say, smiling. 'Alfred knows everything.' \"Very well, Master Jason. Oh, by the way, the mail came.\" \"Thanks Al. I'll check it.\" \"I believe I saw a particular box amongst the envelops, sir.\" I set the packed baskets next to the other things. \"Master Jason,\" Alfred says. He produces a beautiful rose. \"From my garden. It is a rare type of rose. It will last longer than others. And none, that I've seen so far sir, is quite as blue.\" \"I never knew you had a flower garden Al,\" I say, taking the flower. \"There are many things you don't know about me, sir.\" \"She'll love it.\" \"I have no doubt. Will you need any of my-\" \"No thanks Al. I'll take a few trips on my bike.\" \"The motorbike, sir?\" (LUCY'S POV) \"Oh Jason, it's lovely!\" I say, twirling in my new gown. Its hem falls an inch above my knees and fits my waist perfectly. \"And I love these roses,\" I say, scooping them into my arms. \"They smell divine.\" \"Well then I know you'll love this one.\" I turn around. Jason holds the bluest rose I've ever seen out to me. \"From Alfred. He says he grew it.\" I lean the bouquet on one arm and take the rare rose. I feel the petals; Soft as silk. I put my nose in the petals and smell it. \"I honestly don't believe him.\" \"It smells real,\" I say. \"But, it hasn't even started to look wilted. Look, it's perfect. Not one flaw,\" He says. \"Well, I'm still putting it in water, just in case,\" I decide. I walk to the kitchen and lay the flowers on the table. I search through the cupboards. 'I know there's a vase in here somewhere.' I check high and low. Finally, I find it in the cupboard next to the fridge. I fill it with water and set the roses in it. The blue one sticks up in the middle. I set it on the table, admiring the cream and gold vase with a rainbow of color popping out of it. I walk back to the living room. Jason is sitting on the couch wearing a black tuxedo. He smiles and stands up. \"I felt out of place in a t-shirt and jeans,\" He says, regarding the suit. \"It was Grayson's.\" \"Jason, I don't have- and my hair-\" I say, fiddling with it. 'I not ready.' He walks over and takes my hands in his. I stop talking and look at him. \"You are beautiful, Lucy. There is nothing you need to change,\" He tells me. I blush and he kisses it. \"Shall we?\" I nod. He links arms with me and leads me to the back sliding doors. The drapes had been closed, so I couldn't see what was out there. But he opens the door, revealing the surprise. An ornate rug is spread out on the grass with the coffee table next to it. Candles are placed around the area and on the corners of the table. The farthest edge of the table from the rug has a row of candles on it. There is a path lit up with candles leading up to the door of the house. All of the ones on the ground are in sturdy holders so they don't tip over. There are two pillows on the rug. On the table are plates of gourmet food with red rose petals scattered around them. \"Oh, Jason,\" I gasp. It's perfect. He reaches over to a CD player and turns it on. Soft romantic music plays. He walks me down the path. \"I hope you're hungry,\" He says. He seats me on one side of the rug, the dress settling around me. He picks up a plate and sets it in front of me. Then he puts another two plates on the rug, one for him and one filled with little tidbits for each of us to munch on. I eye the last plate. It has a silver cover on it. \"Jason,\" I ask, \"What's under there?\" He looks at where I point. \"You'll find out, in a bit,\" He answers, \"for now, let's eat.\" \"Is this from Alfred too?\" I ask, teasing. He looks up. \"I helped,\" he says, exaggerating pain. I giggle. \"Well I bet it is delicious.\" \"If you like the pudding, I should be rewarded. I made it without help,\" He says. \"Pudding from a packet no doubt,\" I tease. He pretends to be offended. \"You doubt my culinary skills?\" He asks. \"Come on, taste it,\" He dares. I scoop a little pudding onto my spoon. I stop it before my mouth. I slowly put it to my lips and taste it. I never knew pudding could have so many flavors in one spoonful. I groan in delight of the delicious pudding. \"Beautiful,\" is the first word that comes to mind. \"I'm glad you think so,\" Jason comments, \"because,\" he leans forward like it's a secret, \"that was made from a packet.\" We both burst out laughing, \"now try the cherry sauce filled chicken.\" We finish eating and lounge on the pillows, taking turns eating the last pieces of chocolate covered fruit. The chocolate wasn't just the milky kind. I can taste at least three different chocolates. The dipped parts of the apples, strawberries, and cherries were a marble of brown and white. \"Are you full?\" Jason asks. I shake my head. \"Good, because we aren't done eating for the evening.\" \"Can I see what's under there now?\" I ask, bringing the mysterious dish back up. He shakes his head. \"Nope, but I have another gift for you.\" He turns around and picks up a small box. He turns back and hands it to me. I pull the ribbon on top and take the lid off. It's a necklace. It has a silver chain and pendant. The pendant is a uppercase 'J' holding an uppercase 'L.' \"Do you like it?\" He asks. I laugh with glee and pull him closer. \"Yes,\" I kiss him. he cups the back of my neck with his hand. His other arm circles my waist. \"Yes I do,\" I say, our foreheads touching and mouths inches apart. \"I had that ordered a month ago,\" he tells me. \"I wanted it to be a surprise.\" \"Can I put it on?\" I ask. He smiles wider and shrugs. I turn around. I feel the cool links brush past my collar bone. He clasps it in the back and pulls my hair loose. He gets up and turns the music up a little louder. \"May I have this dance?\" Jason asks, coming back. I nod and he offers his hand to me. I take it and he lifts me up, leading me to an empty part of the grass. When we are clear over the candles, I step out of the silver shoes Jason gave me. He sees and takes off his shoes. \"I'd hate to step on your toes with those on,\" He teases. He takes my hand and pulls me close. I lift my arm to his shoulder as his other hand touches my waist. We waltz in the moonlight. He twirls me every once in awhile. The skirt of my dress floats around me. Then the song changes to something a little different. We turn together in a full circle and end with me dipping down, in his arms. I rise back up and he puts both hands on my waist. With one motion, he lifts me up and turns slowly. I look down at him and frame his face with my hands. \"I love you Jason,\" I say. \"I love you Lucy,\" He replies. I look into his bright green eyes. \"Jason Peter Todd, I will love you til I die,\" I say, honestly. He smiles. I wrap my arms around his neck and shoulders. And I kiss him. With him still holding me up, I look up. The sky is a deep black with more stars than I'll see in a lifetime. 'The perfect night.' He sets my feet back in the soft grass. I lean against him, half waltzing as the music slows down. \"And I, Lucy Rosea Blake, will love you forever.\" He kisses my forehead, \"I promise.\" The last song ends and Jason leads me back to the rug. \" Now you can see what that is.\" I sit in my spot. He lays a towel on his arm and poses like waiter. He kicks the CD player and it starts playing a french instrumental song. \"Hello, my name ez Jason and I will be presanting ze dessert of ze evening,\" He says in a French accent, \"Today, we 'ave a very specio dessert for you.\" He puts his hand on the handle of the cover. \"Presenting, ze dessert for the evening. Ze Crème Au Beurre Gâteau. \" He removes the cover to reveal a buttercream cake. I gasp in delight. \"As you can see, it haz ze coconut, strawbewies, ze whipped frosting as you like et, eend my personal favorite,\" I sit up to see the top, \"Your new title of course,\" He finishes in his normal voice. On top in red cursive letters it says, My Valentine . \"It's beautiful.\" I say. He cuts a piece and puts it on my plate. \"As that-one-queen once said,\" he hands me the plate and a fork, bowing, \"'Let them eat cake.'\" (JASON'S POV) We finish most of the cake and talk a little, half-listening to the music. Lucy has a little chocolate on the corner of her mouth. \"You have, uh,\" I start to say. She looks at me, her brown eyes sparkling. \"Uh, there's a little chocolate on your-\" I reach over and swipe it away, \"There. All better.\" My hand stays at her cheek. \"Jason,\" She says. \"Yeah?\" She moves closer on the rug. \"I just wanted to say,\" She starts. My fingers linger over her soft lips. \"Uh huh,\" I reply. \"That, yo-\" I lean over and kiss her. She returns it with a soft passion. \"-are, the person I want to spend the rest of my life with.\" we recline back on the rug and look at the stars. \"I'm glad I said yes to tutoring you.\" \"Same here,\" I admit. A shooting star flashes across the sky. 'I wish I could live forever, and Lucy would never leave.' I walk her home. She kisses me good night and goes inside still wearing the dress. I'll clean up tomorrow. I'm so tired, I could only stay awake long enough to get to my bed in Wayne Manor. Jason! You sure can treat a girl to a good time. So, Final thoughts on the prequel-to-the-real-story-chapters? Also, LONGEST CHAPTER I'VE WRITTEN![Chapter 14] Hehe, I don't know how this got switched with another chapter, but I'm putting this one back up. My bad! So, this is the point where the story gets, interesting. Bring! Bring! \"Bruce! Lucy's here!\" I yell up the stairs. Alfred comes out of the kitchen. \"It's okay Al, I'll get it.\" I walk to the entryway as he turns back around. I open the door, the most stunning girl waiting. She's wearing her cream spring dress with little blue flowers over it. It goes past her knees with sleeves that resemble layered petals. At her waist, a satin sash shows her dainty curves. Both the sash and the flower in her hair were blue. And finally, around her neck is the necklace I got her for Valentines Day. \"You look radiant.\" I say after kissing her cheek. She walks in, holding her silver clutch in front. \"Al will be serving supper in the dining room. And Bruce will be down shortly.\" I tell her as she follows the aroma of chicken. She stops at the entrance to the kitchen. \"Good evening, Ms. Lucy.\" Alfred says. \"Good evening, Alfred. It smells delicious.\" I walk over to her. \"I'd get to the dining room so you can eat it.\" Alfred suggests. She nods and we go to the other side of the main room to be seated. Jason leads me to my seat and pulls it out. \"Thank you.\" I say, sitting. He takes his seat as Mr. Wayne comes in. \"Jason, wouldn't you rather sit across from Lucy?\" Mr. Wayne asks. \"No. I want to be at her side.\" He says, placing his hand over mine. I blush. \"If you insist.\" He replies. He takes his seat at the head of the table. \"So Lucy, how is school going?\" \"Well, I've learned to spam my email from colleges.\" The boys chuckle. \"And Jason has been delaying the project in History.\" Jason puts his hands up in defense, while a little red seeped to his cheeks. \"Well, how do you expect me to write a paper on an influential lady of the past if she was also my partner? We wouldn't receive a good grade.\" \"Why would it have to be about me? I'm not influential.\" I defend. \"Don't be too sure.\" He kisses me as Alfred brings in a cart of dishes. He sets one in front of me first and lifts off the cover. \"Oh, Alfred! It looks divine.\" I squeal. The butler proceeds to give the others a dish of chicken, then leaves. \"Thanks Al!\" Jason calls. \"You are very welcome, sir.\" Alfred replies at the door. \"I think you should work on that project, Jason.\" I tease as he takes a bite. \"Not without my tutor.\" He says. \"After supper?\" I nod. \"And it will be on Rosa Parks.\" I decide. He lifts a fork of chicken as salute. \"You're the boss.\" He agrees. \"Master Jason,\" Alfred announces, \"Master Bruce is in need of your assistance.\" Jason nods and gets up from the couch next to me. \"Sorry Lucy. Gotta go.\" He kisses me on the cheek. As he walks away, I stay at my spot on the couch. \"Could I help?\" I ask. He turns and shakes his head. \"I don't want you to get hurt. No doubt it will be messy.\" Alfred stays in the room as Jason leaves. \"Why does he have to help?\" I ask, coyly. \"Master Jason has a specific talent or two that will have an impact on the time it will take to accomplish the task at hand.\" the butler replies. \"How long will that be?\" I pry. \"Depends.\" \"On what?\" I press. \"On the task.\" He states, giving me no useful information. \"Feel free to stay as long as you like. I can call Ms. Nuatcherdux to pick you up at anytime.\" \"I was pulled from Lucy for this.\" I retort as I tug on my tunic. \"I had to leave her up there, alone.\" \"She isn't alone. She's with Alfred.\" Bruce states in his gruff voice. \"I mean without me .\" I explain, clipping my cape into place. \"Jason, you realize you may not be able to have a continuing relationship without telling her.\" \"Dick did.\" \"And look where that got him. Barbara hasn't contacted him outside of work in a few years. And that doesn't count, she knew.\" \"Whatever. I'll make it work.\" I state. Bruce pulls on his gloves. \"Let's go.\" I decide while I wait for Jason to be done, I'll explore the house a little. I've already been here, but I haven't been everywhere . I walk up the stairs and pick a hallway. I walk down it, admiring the decorations. I stop at a familiar door It's open a crack. I peek through and see the disaster inside. Jason's backpack is on top of the mess. On the dresser, the only clean spot is where my picture sits with a creamy white and blue marble colored rose. I select another door farther down. This one is neat, like the guest rooms. But there is also memorabilia on some of its tables. There are pictures of a young man with raven hair and bright blue eyes. On the bed, there's a box that says 'Dick Grayson's Private Box'. 'Jason must have a brother, or an uncle.' I don't bother with the big doors at the end. They must lead to Mr. Waynes chambers. Finally, after an hour or so of peeking into random rooms, I find a study. It's big with bookshelves lining the walls. In one corner, there is a grand piano. 'I wonder if Jason plays,' I muse. The wall you face when sitting at its stool has a grandfather clock in its center, amid the shelves. But when I walk over to it, I realize it isn't working. I gently tap the glass. \"Odd.\" Deciding to ask about it later, I sit myself down at the piano. It still looks playable. I start up a song that I know. I watch my fingers dance over the ivory keys, when I stop. There are three keys that look more worn than the rest. Curious, I press the first one. DING! Then, the second. DANG! And finally, the third. DONG! A clicking sound comes from behind the clock. A bookshelf starts to move! I duck behind the piano, scared out of my mind. 'What did I do?' The whirring stops and I wait for something to happen. Slowly, carefully, I look past the shiny black wood. The grandfather clock had moved to its left. In its place, in the break in the bookshelves, is- \"-Stairs?\" I ask aloud. I stand up and move over to it. The stairs spiral down with walls of stone. \"What?\" I suddenly hear footsteps approaching the room. More clicking joins it from the clock. Without thinking, I dive through the opening right before the clock moves back. Where I broke it off, I might add more there. Again, I'm sorry. This story is really in a rut right now.[Chapter 15] Epic battle between the Joker and the Dynamic Duo! EPIC! Disclaimer: I am not responsible for Joker's insanity. Only DC can do that. (3RD PERSON) Batman and Robin are in the midst of a deadly battle with twenty some of Jokers goons. The Clown Prince of Crime himself is standing on the stage, laughing his head off. Robin gives one clown a right hook and turns to another, deflecting a knife blade. Batman keeps a shorter henchman at arms length as he kicks one rushing at him. The Bat punches Shorty in the face, knocking him out. Unknowingly, a clown with a green star on his pale cheek sneaks behind Batman with a large mallet. \"Batman duck!\" Robin yells, throwing a batarang. His mentor crouches down just as the projectile goes over his head and hits the sneaky clown in the hand. He yowls, dropping the mallet on his foot. Robin smiles at his aim. But he gets tackled due to his lowered guard. He manages to beat them off his back. Both heroes take on the two thugs, knocking them out. Now, the Dynamic Duo is back to back, surrounded by Joker's thugs. \"More decided to show, huh? What does he pay these guys?\" \"Robin, not now,\" Batman scolds. \"I'm just saying,\" one goon braves the circle. Robin kicks him back, \"Why would fifty some guys fight us for a sadistic clown? It's-\" \"Insane?\" Batman suggests. Robin stops talking. \"Focus.\" The thugs advance in groups. Batman takes on one side of the circle as his partner takes the other. Joker still dances on the stages, watching. \"Batsy,\" he sings, \"Why the rush ? Don't you want to see the finale?\" He takes out a big red button and wiggles a gloved finger over it. \"Wanna see what this does?\" He asks mischieviously. Through the fight, Batman narrows his eyes at his nemesis. \"Robin, can you manage here?\" The Dark Knight asks. \"Sure, there are only what? Thirty still standing, right?\" Robin jokes dryly. \"I'm going after Joker.\" Batman takes out his grapple gun and swings onto the stage. Joker pretends to be shocked. \"Oh, Batsy. I knew you were going to stick around.\" Joker puts his hands on his hips in a know-it-all fashion. Batman narrows his eyes even more. Joker smiles innocently with his hands behind his back. \"I'm sure we'll have,\" Joker pulls out his flag gun, \"a blast ,\" he says with a sadistic edge. He points the gun at Batman. But a batarang lodges itself in the barrel and produces a bright light. Joker stumbles back, rubbing his eyes. \"What does the button do Joker?\" Batman demands. Joker just laughs and mutters, \"Just the flash I needed. Haha heh heh...\" Batman rushes at him. He knees him in the stomach and grabs him by the collar. \"What. Does. It. Do!?\" He says inches from the villains face. \"Hey hey, watch the suit. Made it me-self. You like?\" \"I'm not in the mood for games.\" \"You're never in the mood for anything,\" Joker pretends to wipe a tear away, \"especially little 'ol me,\" He adds innocently. Batman growls at the sinister clown in his grip. Joker whimpers for real. \"Hey hey hey! Okay, Batsy, okay. You got me.\" He throws his hands it the air. \"Cuff me, it's over.\" \"You know it is,\" Robin says, leaping onto the stage, \"The others are out or running. Police are also in the front Batman.\" Joker takes out a hankie and dabs his eyes. \"They grow up so fast, don't they. I still remember when Birdy was yea-high.\" Batman throws him to the wall. \"You wanted to know what this does?\" He says, grabbing the button. The villain pulls a stage rope, signalling to more henchmen, \"This!\" He pushes it. \"Ahh!\" A trap door had opened up under Robin. He falls through, grabbing the edge just in time. He looks down to see hyenas. One of them jumps and grabs the yellow and black cape in its teeth. \"Batman!\" \"I love my babies, but , there is no room on the plane for animals,\" Joker comments. \"What are you planning Joker?\" Batman asks, staring his nemesis down. Joker starts to back up with his new henchmen. \"Oh nothing. Just been recruited to a league. Apparently they love the insane,\" Joker says, making a silly face. \"Now, you can make me late for my ride, or , save the bird from being eaten. Tata!\" The exit door slams behind him. Batman immediately turns to Robin. They lock arms and Batman yanks his partner up. He kicks the hyena off the cape. \"Let me guess, I'm heavier than I look?\" Robin quips. He receives the famous 'bat glare.' \"We need to get back to the cave,\" Batman states, unmoved by the Boy Wonder's joke. Is Joker OOC? I'm just making sure.. What does this have to do with Jason? (Question for none DC readers)[Chapter 16] Ooh! We're here! *Giant squeal!* (3RD PERSON) The batmobile pulls up to it's spot in the batcave. Batman pushes a button next to the wheel to open the top. Robin follows him out. They walk over to the computer and the dark knight starts typing. \"So, what are we doing?\" Robin asks, looking at the screen. \"We have clues from Joker. I'm pin pointing the next place he'll be.\" Batman answers. \"Robin, think. What did the Joker say?\" \"Uh, he said 'the League recruits the oddest bunches' and 'I'm the oddest.'\" Robin mimics. \"He was asked to come. Someone needs his help. And it can't be Justice League.\" He thinks out loud. \"Then what League is there that would 'recruit' the Joker?\" Batman knows the answer, he just wants Robin to think about it. \"League of Shadows!\" Robin exclaims, thumping his forehead. \"Duh. Right?\" \"I've seen Ra's do crazier things.\" Batman agrees. He leans back in the chair. \"But his motive is unclear this time.\" He stares at the computer for a few seconds. He then straightens and pulls up the files on Ra's, Joker, and Talia. 'Might as well not leave her out.' \"So he's headed to the Middle East.\" Robin deduces. Batman clicks on the console to also bring up the map of Ra's' current movements. \"It would seem so.\" He agrees. \"I'll call Oracle. She can tell Superman the situation.\" Robin offers, turning to leave. \"No. We're handling this one.\" Batman orders. Robin stops and looks at him, furious. \"What?!\" He yells. Batman finally looks away from the screen. \"We are going after the Joker. Now.\" he emotionlessly tells his partner. Robin stares at him. \"But she's up there!\" Robin protests, pointing at the stairs. \"Alfred can show her out. This is impo-\" \"Yeah! I get it!\" Robin yells at him. \"Can't we just play this out like the other times?\" he pleads. \"No.\" Batman says. Robin huffs and starts for the stairs. \"For an emotionless flying rodent, you're a real grouch Bruce.\" He retorts. \"Where are you going?\" his mentor asks. Robin turns again. \"Up. To see her . At least say goodbye.\" Robin declares. \"You can when we get back.\" the mentor says. 'He's forgetting about his suit.' \"Oh, so I'll say goodbye after we get back?\" Robin asks over his shoulder. Neither of them hear the footsteps coming from the 'trophies.' \"I never said that.\" Batman argues. Robin doesn't pause his assent. \"Jason!\" Jason stops and turns around, ready to take out a smoke pellet. He notices someone behind Batman. \"Jason?\"Lucy asks with disbelief. Jason stares at her, then turns his gaze to Batman. He hasn't moved a muscle. \"Lucy?\" Jason asks after looking back at her. Batman follows his attention to his girlfriend. \"You're... Robin?\" Lucy asks. Jason looks to Bruce. He just nods in his subtle way. Jason takes his mask off. \"Yeah Lucy, I am.\" He starts down the stairs. \"And Bruce Wayne. He's Batman?\" Reluctantly, Bruce removes the cowl. \"How much of the conversation did you hear?\" He asks her. She looks scared at hearing Batman after knowing who he is. \"J-Just where you said you are going across the sea to stop someone. And I won't tell. I won't! It's just the clock moved and-\" \"Lucy, we believe you.\" Bruce throws a glance at Jason. \"Or I believe you. And yes, we have to go to the Middle East to stop the Joker.\" Bruce groans at the statement. \"You're going to leave me?\" She asks. Jason finally reaches her and takes her hand. \"Well, not forever. We just have to stop some villains. We'll be back in uh,\" he looks to Bruce for support. He just rolls his eyes and sighs. \"It takes about two hours to get from Gotham City to the hideout we think they are using. And without the help we-\" \"We'll be back sometime this week.\" Jason says. Lucy becomes downcast at his decision. \"Almost a week! Can it be... a day?\" She bargains. This isn't something you make a deal over, Batman thinks. \"Mm, five.\" \"Two?\" \"Four\" \"Two and a half?\" Bruce has had enough. \"It will be four okay! Four days. I did the math.\" He barges in. Lucy is hurt. Jason tilts her chin up. \"I'll be back Lucy.\" \"Promise.\" \"What?\" \"It wasn't a question. Promise you'll be back. I don't care if it takes you longer. Just promise you will come back.\" She cups his cheek. \"Please.\" \"I promise Lucy.\" He hugs her. \"No matter how long it takes me.\" He's going over seas to fight the Joker. Man, that's dedication. Lucy now knows. Check point reached.[Chapter 17] Hi! I'm back to working on this one! First off, I'd like to say I'm really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really reallyREALLY really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really... etc etc SORRY for making all of you wait to continue reading this. I had a huge writer's block. I didn't know how to write the mission. So what I did? I skipped it up to the point where they encounter the Joker in the movie. So, prepare those tissue boxes, because you will need them. (No, the thing we all know that will happen doesn't happen here. That.. that comes later.) Jason's POV We tracked the Joker to Bosnia. He left a trail of grinning bodies to a pharmacy. Batman opened the door, but no one there could help. We race through the halls, listening for Joker's insane laugh. \"Through here,\" Batman whispers, kicking the door open. I follow him through and stop at his side. Joker's clown goons wearing gas masks are using their full arms to swipe pill bottles into the bags. They look up at us at the sound of the door hitting the concrete tiles. We are only still for a second. Joker turns around to look at us, his revolting red smile. Batman lunges forward and the goons come to meet us, passing a now laughing Joker. I wait for Batman to take out three as I run behind him. I leap over him, grabbing a goon's head and crashing my knee into his face. He falls to my feet. Batman is taking the others still standing, but we have the upper hand. I look up to see Joker taking the back entrance. I smirk and go after him. No way is he getting away again. \"Robin! No!\" I hear behind me. I ignore the order and dive through the door. I pass hallway after hallway until I realize that the only sound I can hear is my near silent footsteps. I stop and look around. Batman didn't follow me. He must still be busy with the henchmen. \"Ohh.. Birdy boy~\" Joker's voice echos through the air. I take out a batarang, ready to throw at a moment's notice. \"What? No hug hello? I'm deeply offended.\" I take a few steps to the left, pinpointing the origin of his voice from that direction. \"Come out Joker! It's over! You lost,\" I say, listening for him to speak again. \"Ohhh hoho-hehehe.. I don't think so~\" he sings again. I take a few more steps. He jumps out from behind a corner, \"SURPRISE!\" There's a flash and I close my eyes, momentarily blinded. I toss the batarang in my hand. There's a grunt that escapes the Joker's crimson lips. I can hear his maniacal laughter before something hard hits me in the head. I collapse to the ground and the laughter dies away. The ringing in my ears is what brings me to consciousness. I feel rough rope through my gloves, restraining my arms behind my body. I take in the rest of what my four senses can before allowing myself to use sight. I taste copper in my mouth, reminding me of the good whack I received earlier. My legs are free of rope and I'm laying on my stomach. 'Concrete flooring. Not the same as the pharmacy.' I hear dripping water, and someone is pacing. My own breathing is shaky. \"Agh, what's taking the bird brain so long to wake up..\" someone mutters. The voice echoes off of walls, so I must be in a large space. And the voice sends shivers up my spine; Joker. I hear someone kneel next to me. He takes a big, exaggerated breath right next to my ear. \"ARE YOU AWAKE KID!?\" He yells. My eyes shoot open, not expecting him to scream like that. But he did, and it hurts. My ears are still ringing as is. The first thing I see is Joker's face, pasty and grotesque as ever. \"Oh goody. I didn't interrupt your sleep, did I?\" He asks. I wrinkle my nose. His breath smells nasty. Like he ate a person for breakfast. 'As if you genuinely care,' I want to spit back. But he doesn't give me time to. \"Anywho, now we can get to the fun stuff.\" He stands up, getting out of my face. I roll onto my back and look around. I'm in a warehouse. I try to sit up, getting to my knees. I look up as the Joker gets back, only to receive a facefull of crowbar. I fall back to the concrete, groaning. I cough as I feel fresh blood on my tongue. I try to calm my heavy breathing. \"Wow, that looked like it really hurt,\" Joker says, watching me. He smiles sickeningly and uses the crowbar a few times, each on different areas of my body. I fall onto my back, gritting my teeth. \"Wup, now hang on, that looked like it hurt a lot more.\" 'You think? No kidding! Why don't you try being on this side, scumbag!?' I want to scream. But considering my throat, lungs, and ribs feel like they've been set on fire, I hold back the retort. It would just egg him on anyway. I just stare up at the ceiling. 'Batman where are you?' \"So,\" he continues, tapping the crowbar speckled with my blood on his gloved hands, \"Let's try and clear this up, okay pumpkin?\" He asks, like I have a choice. \"What hurts more.. A..\" The metal connects with my cheek again. \"Or B..\" This time it lands on my gut. I can barely keep back a grunt. \"Forehand,\" he sings. I was about to sit up, but my temple gets the brunt of the blow, so I fall back, again. \"Or backhand.\" I feel a rib crack. My cheek is pressed to the floor, where a puddle of red had developed from the beating. Joker laughs at my misfortune, so I turn my body to tell him something. But it only comes out as an incoherent jumble. He stoops down again, still in my face. He mimics the sound I made, then cups his ear, \"A little louder lambchop.\" He grabs my head, for a reason I don't care to find out, \"I think you may have a collapsed lung. That always beats the oratory.\" I take advantage of being this close to him. I spit at him, more blood and anything else. He retaliates with the firm grip on my head to slam my nose into the concrete. I yelp at the pain, a distinct crunch reaching my ears. The next sensation I feel is a steady flow of blood down my face. \"Now that was rude,\" he states. \"The first boy blunder had some manners.\" I manage to roll my body so I'm not faceplanting the floor. I smile, teeth showing, little red veins going down them. \"I suppose I should teach you a lesson so can better follow in his footsteps,\" he says. He seriously looks like he's considering it. 'But the Joker is anything but serious.' \"Nah.. I'm just going to keep hitting you with this crowbar!\" He raises it up again, shoving his foot between my shoulder blades. I stare at the curved metal as he wields it above his head like a trophy, laughing. 'Bruce.. Where are you?' Ouch. Well, I hope this satisfies you all for now. Although I left you on a cliff hanger. Now, next chapter is 'the moment' so I have a poll for you all: Who's POV should it be in? A. Robin's or B. Batman's Because I'm okay with either.[Chapter 18] I know I was going to only write Astrid: Part Three, but I'm at a stump there and other stories aren't finished yet. And I also know it took a while, but I finally got this part done. Terrible part, but it's not like any of us are surprised (If you know anything about Jason Todd.) For those that don't, only those with hearts of stone won't need tissues. Jason's POV \"..Okay kiddo, I gotta go. Can't say this hasn't been fun right?\" I don't move from where I am on the floor, my ears still ringing from his assault. Any sound that makes it passed the ringing sounds lagging. \"Well.. maybe a smidge more for me,\" Joker admits, \"But I'm just guessing since you've been awfully quiet.\" 'Yeah, all because of you clown-head,' I want to spit back. But I can't, because he's right. I have a collapsed lung. \"Anyway..\" he says, his voice fading out as my ears start to throb on their own again, \"be a good boy, do your homework and be in bed by nine. And hey!\" I would look at the maniac, but I don't want to move. \"Tell the big guy I say.. Hello.\" I hear a door close as he laughs his head off and a lock click into place. Only after I can't hear that laughter do I dare open my eye. My other one has a bruise forming around it. I roll over onto my back, protesting the entire time. I flip my feet over my head so I'm kneeling. I slide the handcuffs over them so my hands are in front. I stop for a moment, exerting myself. The pain is unbearable and I want to collapse onto the floor again. But I don't. I push up with my hands and stand on my two feet. I feel bones moving in ways they shouldn't and a wave of dizziness passes over me. But I don't sit down. I waver a little, then start walking slowly to the door. I barely take another step before I faceplant on the concrete. \"Ahh!\" I wait for most of the pain to subside. Then I push my arms forward and inch along the floor. I grit my teeth, a dribble of blood rolling down my chin, and try to keep my audible protests at a minimum. I look up, to see how far away I am, when I stop. She's standing there. \"Mom?\" My voice is almost inaudible, but somehow she understands me. \" Jason, baby..\" She says softly. I shake my head, which results in a few stars to dance on my vision, \"No, no, you're dead. You can't be here.\" \" Jason..\" my mother says tenderly, \" won't you give your mother a hug?\" I look at her as she opens her arms wide. I smile with broken teeth and start to move again, I inch along the floor and stop when I'm halfway there. \" Jason?\" I flinch at the new voice and turn my head. I drill a wet gasp down my throat. \"Lucy..?\" I whisper, again with a scratchy voice. She's wearing the same dress she wore when I left. \" What happened?\" She asks. Lucy starts to walk over. \"Lucy, you sh-shouldn't be here..\" I manage, trying to stand up. She finishes coming over. \" Was it Mark again?\" She asks. I'm confused by her question and she puts a hand on my arm. I realize there that I'm dreaming. I don't feel her. I feel nothing. I start to move away from her and to the door. \" Just let me do this and I'll forget you were late,\" she says sternly. This is a memory, she isn't here. But her words hit my heart. 'She's going to be so mad when I get back, that all this happened. She's bound to be scared for me right now. I have to go home to her.' I start dragging my sorry carcass to the door. I start to dream that Mom is there again. I use that to motivate me. I reach her and she is still waiting for that hug. I see the warmth in her eyes, just like when I used to bring her chocolate. I reach up, forgetting that she's a mirage. My hand touches the door handle. Before I collapse back down, I get a firm grip on it and shake. But it's locked. I let go and fall into a heap. When I can move, I turn around so my back is against the door. My head hits the metal and I grab my side in agony. Bruce's POV Snow flies on either side of my bike. 'Faster faster faster, he can't get away with this.. I won't allow it.' I tell myself that Jason is counting on me and I can't let him down. I look at my GPS, which I've followed from Jason's comm. 'I have to get there on time.' Jason's POV \" Jason..\" Lucy says softly. She frames my face with her hands. She's mesmerizing in her green dress. I knew it would fit perfectly on her. \"I love you Jason,\" she says with confidence. \" I love you, Lucy,\" I say immediately after. She chortles to herself and promises, \"Jason Peter Todd, I will love you til I die.\" She leans over and kisses me as she has done many times over. \" And I, Lucy Rosea Blake-\" A sound brings me out of the memory filled daydream my mind concocted. I turn away from Lucy and look at a crate near the wall. The beeping comes from it. Red numbers count down, with eight seconds left. \" -will love you forever.\" I widen my eyes as I realize what's going to happen. Bruce isn't here, Joker won. 'Lucy..' I close my eyes, 'I'm sorry I couldn't keep my-' Bruce's POV My bike glides up the incline and I jump off. I run toward the warehouse. 'Joker, when I find you, you are going to wish I do kill you,' I vow in my head. But I don't reach the door in time. Flames burst out of all the windows. I shield my face from the heat. Pieces of metal fall to the ground around me. When I push a slate of metal off of me, I see the whole warehouse is destroyed. 'Jason!' Wooden crates burn from left over fire. Metal lays in twisted figures. Through the smoke, I smell blood. I run to where the warehouse once stood. I go to the closest piece of fallen wall. With all my strength, I lift it up, but it's empty. I end up where the door once stood. I throw a beam off the pile and start digging with my own two hands. Then I stop. \"No..\" Jason lays lifeless on the ground, covered in blood and bruises. His leg is bent wrong and his left side has burn marks from the explosion. His body is riddled with cuts and bruises from something other than the explosion. And he was right next to the door. He was right there. I gently pick him up. 'If I was faster..' He doesn't wake up, I know he won't wake up. \"Jason,\" I say my voice shaky. I close my eyes and don't hold back the tears that come from the circumstance. In my frustration, I yell into the wind above the roar of the flames. I tried to keep it to the movie as best I could. The memories he sees are from the chapters 'His Scrapes' and 'Their Valentine's Day'. Now, the next part is a little tricky. Because I'm not sure how I am going to go about this.. We are at the point in the story that doesn't take place in the movie. I don't want the part with the Lazarus Pit, I have an idea what to do for Jason's next scene. But I want some of Gotham in there first.[Chapter 19] After a long wait, here is the next chapter. 3rd POV \"And in other news, Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham after a sudden and mysterious disappearance-\" Lucy looks up. There is a video live at the scene of Bruce stepping out of a private plane. He's waving to a crowd of reporters, a grim line set under his nose. Lucy watches for Jason, but doesn't see him. 'Maybe.. He's already left the plane?' she reasons. Bruce continues to not smile, unlike what he would usually do in front of cameras. He has to keep up the billionaire playboy facade. Lucy thinks nothing of it, until he turns around.. And helps carry a coffin off the aircraft. Lucy stares at the sight. Bruce's masked but evident sorrow, the casket that has the Wayne symbol on top. The strange lack of a certain person, who was definitely with Bruce. A tear slips down her face, and another follows. \"Ms. Nautcherdux?\" She asks in a whisper. \"Yes, dear?\" the caretaker asks from the armchair. Lucy sniffs, \"Can you bring the car around. I need to go to the airport.\" \"..Are you alright, Lucy?\" Ms. Nautcherdux asks. \"I need to go to the airport,\" Lucy stresses. A long Wayne car is parked outside the entrance to the airport. Lucy pushes past onlookers, including reporters and people coming and leaving the building. She reaches the line drawn by security to give Bruce space. \"Excuse me, miss,\" a guard says when she tries to cross the line, \"you aren't allowed over there.\" \"I'm a friend,\" Lucy says, tears drying on her cheeks, \"I'm a friend and if you tell Mr. Wayne that Lucy Blake is here, he'll let me through.\" The guard looks at her skeptically, \"please sir, I need to get through.\" He turns on his commlink. Bruce stares at the wooden box holding his son; his partner. \"Sir,\" a security guard says, \"there's a girl in the crowd that says she knows you, personally. A Lucy Blake?\" Bruce sighs, tiredly, \"Yes, I do. Send her over.\" Not one minute later, Lucy's shoe falls are heard on the concrete. Bruce turns to greet her and opens his arms. She barrels into to him -her arms pinned to her chest- and she feels an immovable man stagger a little. \"Tell me it isn't true!\" She pleads, \"Tell me this is some horrible prank and Jason-\" \"Lucy,\" Bruce says, his heart being stabbed with his son's name. Lucy sobs one more time into his shirt before looking up at him. \"..He's gone.\" Lucy's eyes water again and she shakes her head. She buries her face into his shirt and he rubs her shoulder comfortingly. A few reporters get passed the security guards and walk over. \"Sir?\" One asks. Bruce motions for Alfred, who was waiting on the other side of the car. \"Miss..\" Alfred takes Lucy to the back seat. She sits there, numb, and uses all her willpower to not look behind her, at the wall. She knows what lies beyond. Lucy stays at Wayne Manor, which her parents don't mind. They understand how she feels at the loss of Jason. At least.. how much they can. Lucy walks up into Jason's room. It's still how it is before he left. She walked inside only once before, the night he left. Her rose is still there. The picture is still sitting there. And everything is still a mess. The bed has a spot where Jason must curl up at night, because the rest is covered in clothes or junk. Lucy walks over and sits on that clear spot. She curls up with her head on the pillow. She starts sobbing to herself. She knows Alfred is downstairs, she hasn't a clue what Bruce could be doing now. She starts sobbing more and that is where the tears decide to appear. She stains his pillowcase with them. \"Why..?\" She asks the air, \"You promised.. You promised Jason!\" She sits up and looks around. \"What happened? Bruce won't tell anyone. Why.. you promised!\" No one answers, and she shouldn't expect him to. She's lost him and she can't do anything to change it. She stands up and walks to the phone. She dials up a dressmaker's shop. \"Hallo?\" \"Hi,\" Lucy sniffs, \"this is Lucy Blake? I would like to alter my dress order.\" \"Haf course, Miss Blake. What alterationes would you like?\" \"Change the color to black,\" Lucy says. \"Of course mademoiselle,\" the nice lady says. \"Thank you..\" Lucy says quietly. She hangs up and drops the phone. Her dress was going to be red, because Jason asked her to the dance coming up. But now? ..She'll have to wear it to his funeral. Okay, I had tried only working on one until it was finished. That wasn't working. So, here's my new idea: I am going to finish Country Lass (like, one chapter left.) then I'll figure it out from there. NaNo is coming up, so I don't want to make too big of a plan yet. I'd appreciate some prayers, since I feel sick and I have a lot of writing on my plate.[Chapter 20] I am in the process of finishing unfinished stories before November (NaNo's a' coming!) The next on the list is Red Hood has a Heart. I expect to finish this this week. So pester me to insanity, I'll need it to get this done. 3rd POV Lucy doesn't see Bruce for three days after he returned. She had stayed in the manor with Alfred, but she remembers what's below. Even if she doesn't see him, she can take a good guess at where he is. Alfred is preparing some tea for Bruce when Lucy walks into the kitchen. \"I'll take it to him, Alfred,\" she offers. \"..As you wish, Ms. Lucy,\" he says. He hands her the tray and she walks to the study. Lucy sets the tray on her hip to press the three keys on the piano. Ding, dang, dooonng.. The clock slides away, but it doesn't scare Lucy this time. She walks down the stone stairway, holding the tray in front of her. She walks down into the Batcave. The four large screens are lit up and active, a silhouette typing in the middle. Lucy takes a deep breath and walks over to him. Bruce doesn't look at her; He's hunched over the keyboard, the chair pushed away from him. Lucy sets the tray on a flat, keyless area of the console. \"Alfred thought you could use some-\" she explains slowly, not really hearing it all. \"Thank you,\" Bruce says distractedly, not changing the position he's in. He continues to bring up more articles onto the screens, each of the infamous Joker. '..He killed Jason.' It doesn't take a genius to place a reason on Bruce's vengeful search. Lucy looks around. She spots a new glass case, away from the trophy area. She feels all the breath in her lungs leave like a punch to the gut. It holds Jason's red, green, and yellow costume. Lucy walks around the chair and to where the case stands next to the batcomputer. She places her hand on the glass, staring at the R symbol on the chest. It aches that she lost him to soon. So much, she crumples into herself at the base. She stays there, leaning against the glass. She numbly watches Bruce walk away from the computer to a room on the other side of the cave. He returns in his Batman costume, the cowl already pulled up over his eyes. Lucy watches him get into the dark colored, armored car and drive off. Alfred comes down and finds the untouched tea and sleepy Lucy. He walks over and tries to help her stand up. But she refuses to move. Alfred does not press the matter. He stands up and takes the now cold tea upstairs. When he comes back, he drapes a blanket around her. Lucy soon falls asleep. She wakes up at the sound of the road exit opening. The batmobile roars into view and screeches to a stop on its platform. Bruce slowly leaps out, peppered with scratches, bruises, and blood. Alfred waits at the infirmary door, having prepped it for his pseudo son's arrival while Lucy was asleep. The moment Bruce steps off the circular platform, it starts to spin the car to face the exit again. Lucy watches, still too tired to wonder what he had been doing. Bruce almost passes her. But he notices her in the corner of his eye. He stops and turns his cowled head to her. Lucy sees Batman's blue eyes watching her thoughtfully. \"..Go get some sleep, Ms. Blake,\" he advises, losing the low growl he changes his voice to against villains. Lucy shakes her head. Bruce walks closer, pulling the cowl off. It lays against his shoulder blades as he squats down and coaxes her to stand. Alfred is right there by her side when she's on her feet. \"Escort Ms. Blake to the living room, Alfred. I can wait,\" Bruce says. Then he walks to the infirmary. \"Come now, Ms. Lucy,\" Alfred says gently. Lucy listens to him and they walk up the stone steps. She sits on the couch, her blanket still around her. Alfred leaves to patch up Bruce. He is already sitting on the table, waiting for his butler/doctor to get the stitches. Alfred helps him take off the upper part of his armor, where most of the injuries have collected. Alfred starts the first round of stitches when Bruce finally speaks, \"I couldn't do it.. Alfred.\" Alfred stops and looks at Bruce's face. If he ever looked more like the small boy that just lost his parents, it was now. \"Good.\" Alfred goes back to stitching, unaware of Bruce's surprise baring down on him. \"The insane bloke isn't worth life time pain for you, Master Bruce.\" Bruce looks to his knees and nods, understanding. Lucy reaches for the remote and turns on the tv. She flips through channels, not really seeing what's on, or at least bothering to comprehend it. Then she stops and goes back a channel. There's a reporter outside Arkham Asylum. She turns the sound up. \"-had been found outside Arkham Asylum gates not an hour ago,\" the reporter continues, \"it seems the lawless criminal was ruthlessly beaten, as the paramedics say most of his bones are broken-\" The camera pans to show a beaten Joker on a stretcher, effectively knocked out. Doctors are aiding in getting him in the hospital, keeping a wary gaze on the villain. Policemen and soldiers are also on guard, not letting their guard down, even if Joker is not responsive. Lucy has her eyes glued to the screen. Then it shuts off as a hand had taken the remote from her hand. She turns around and sees Bruce there, holding the black and silver device. He sets it down and walks away to a chair nearby. Lucy sees his knuckles are wrapped in clean white bandage. She gulps and realizes how Joker got his extreme injuries. \"..The funeral will take place next week,\" Bruce says quietly. Lucy nods. 'Jason's funeral,' she reminds herself instinctively. She eyes his bandages again, \"Where was he?\" Bruce notes her gaze. \"It doesn't matter.\" \"..Did you want to kill him?\" She finds the guts to ask. Bruce ignores the question, but Lucy doesn't. Eventually, Bruce turns and looks her dead in the eye. \"Yes.\" \"Why didn't you?\" Lucy asks, \"Why didn't you kill that maniac and saved the world from more pain!?\" She's crying again, rivers of salty water cascading down her face. \"Because that is who he is,\" Bruce explains calmly, \"and I would be no better than those I protect this city from.\" Lucy stares at him, trying to take deep breaths as she continues to cry. Bruce moves over and rubs circles into her back to help ease the pain. Lucy instinctively leans over into his chest, too weary to hold herself up. But it's nothing compared to Jason. Bruce makes her feel safe, like a father figure. But Jason.. Jason makes her feel at home . Like he is where she needs to be. Now.. she's homeless. Nowhere to go. The titles are getting a little hard to name. I don't want to abruptly change that, because it gives a little apprehension to what the chapters about. Is Alfred OOC in this? I don't think so personally. I feel he'd say that after. If anyone is confused to why I put this in here, remember: \"Are you really going to do it this time? Or are you just going to put me in a full body cast for the next six months.\" -Joker, Under the Red Hood Keep looking for the next chapter, I want it out sometime TODAY! (Then there's a time skip, to you know when~) ~CtW[Chapter 21] I meant to get this up yesterday, but it's done now. 3rd POV Bruce didn't want to put on a large funeral. He only invited people that truly knew and loved Jason. He had told Dick Grayson about it and he said he'd come from Bludhaven. Other than him and Alfred, Lucy's family had come as well. There were some teachers from school and other people Jason had met at some point in his life. Nice and simple, how Bruce hopes Jason would have wanted it. And the burial site was where he figured he'd want to be as well; right next to his mother. Lucy stood with her parents and caretaker most of the time. She had put on her black dress she ordered, her hair up in a coiled braid and black headband. People start to walk away after the final prayer. That's when her father looks at his watch and says he has to go. Her mother goes with him, trusting that Lucy can get home on her own. Lucy dismisses her caretaker as well, not wanting someone around who didn't really know Jason. Once she is alone, she walks over to the stone. It isn't fancy, but there is an engraving on the bottom, after his name and years. - In memory of a son, brother, and boyfriend who left the world too soon- Lucy places her hand on the top of the stone, feeling the smooth gray material. She chokes back sobs, but her eyes are dry. She spent it all earlier in the funeral. She slides to the dirt, one hand sliding with so it rests at the base of the stone, the other crushing a clump of grass in her fist. A hand comes down to her shoulder. She looks up and sees Bruce. \"I'd like you to meet someone.\" Lucy nods and stands up. She turns to face a young man with black hair, blue eyes, and where a suit much like Bruce's, only a little more casual. Like he couldn't afford much else. \"Richard Grayson,\" he introduces himself, offering a hand. Lucy takes it, but her shake isn't as firm as she'd like. \"Lucy Blake.\" \"You knew Jason?\" He asks, trying not to look at the fresh grave. \"..Yeah,\" Lucy states. \"...Oh yeah!\" Grayson remembers, \"now I remember you. He mentioned you a few times while..\" he fades out, looking at Bruce. Bruce sighs, \"She knows, Dick,\" he says, using the nickname. Grayson looks at Lucy. She shrugs, \"Batman and.. Robin,\" she says so only they can hear. Grayson sighs, \"Nightwing,\" he decides to tell her, \"Jason talked a lot on patrols whenever I'd visit, or if I needed them in Bludhaven.\" \"Ah.\" \"Did you two ever..?\" Grayson asks. Lucy looks down at Jason's stone, and the saying below. Grayson follows her gaze. He sees 'boyfriend' and his mouth becomes and 'o.' \"I see..\" \"Richard will be staying at the manor for a little bit,\" Bruce informs. Lucy nods. \"I'm welcome, right?\" Lucy asks. \"You're always welcome, Lucy,\" Bruce assures. Lucy smiles, but it doesn't reach her eyes. She excuses herself from the group when another person in black comes to offer condolences to the Wayne family. Of course, there is at least one reporter here. Nothing the Waynes do will ever escape the media. Not even their secret lives. Lucy wanders to the other side of the fresh grave, finding the simple one they visited before. \"Look after him, won't you?\" She asks his mother, \"He needs you now, where I can't be near him.\" She stands up, after brushing off the fading letter she left there. Dirt had accumulated in the creases, and she wants it to be clean for Ms. Todd to read. She turns back to Grayson and Bruce, who are back to being alone. She speaks up when she won't be interrupted. \"My ride left, so..\" Bruce nods, understanding. He motions to where the car is parked and the younger pair start toward it. Grayson sees Lucy looking down at the grass as she walks. He nudges her arm and she looks up. He offers his elbow to her. Lucy sees him smile, trying to lift her spirits. She smiles back again and slips her arm through his crooked one. She leans on him as they finish the walk to the car. She stares out the window on the way to the manor. Lucy would have found it appropriate for it to be raining, but the sky was a bright blue, with little puffy clouds drifting lazily. It was even a little warm, almost too warm to wear black. 'Doesn't the world know what happened?' Lucy asks, 'What I've lost? What we'll never get back?' Lucy waits for clouds to roll in and pour out its sorrows, but nothing happens. 'Don't you know where he is!?' She wants to scream. Water enters his lungs, forcing him to choke as he squeezes through the narrow opening. Cold wet stone greets him, smooth from years of pulsing tides. It it replaced by rough pebbles and shards of chipped stone that pierces his skin. The cave isn't deep. There's only five feet -maybe six- of space after the water level ends. The back had collapsed long ago, so aged rocks block the path behind. Salt water continuously laps at the smoothened stone, at a lower tide than it could be. His eyes are still wide from fear, shock. But he doesn't move to get farther away. The jump, the swim, pulling himself up through the narrow crevice; Everything has made him tired. He looks down at his body. His skin is pale, and he silently tells himself it shouldn't be that way. 'The cold water,' he deduces. The white wrappings he woke up in have mostly fallen off in the swim, leaving the ones around his waist. Some still hang loosely by the velcro of water. His hair is plastered to his head. He hears unnatural waves outside his safe haven. The ceiling bends low to the entrance, making it hard to see anything outside; He can't see the intruder. He backs up to the rock wall, giving his position away as he does so. Pebbles roll into the waves and make small splashes. He tenses when everything stops outside. All except the gentle tide is silent. Then, the unnatural splashes become louder, closer. A boot comes into view in the waves, shiny and black. 'Bruce?' He wonders, unsure what to take from the name in his fear. A head ducks down under a higher part of the ceiling that was overlooked. It reveals a head of neatly clipped black and white hair. \"Hello,\" the man in elegant green says. The first occupant tenses, backing away more, green eyes wide. Yet, he's ready to spring, like he did on those guards. \"No need for that, I mean you no harm.\" It takes him several long moments to believe him. The man moves slowly to a drier part of the cave, opposite from the younger of the two. His cape and trousers are soaked, but he pays no mind. He sits cross legged, regarding the still tense occupant. After a break of silence, he clearly asks, \"Do you know who I am?\" The younger nods. \"Ra's Al Ghul,\" he answers. Then, he is asked, \"Do you know who you are?\" The young man looks at his hands, dirty and scraped from the frantic crawling on the shards of stone. He asks himself the question. Then he looks at Ra's. \"My name is Jason Todd.\" He's alive! He's alive! Now we are all caught up to the present (movie). The next will be after the 3 year time skip (Which I intend to get rolling off the presses today.) I know some people are asking, \"but Ra's didn't know Jason survived the fall!\" And this is my answer: Does Ra's seriously tell Batman everything? It's possible he left out that he helped Jason. How would Jason have survived on his own after that? By pure rage and thirst for revenge like Maul? (Star Wars Clone Wars reference.) And for those that do not know who Nightwing/Grayson is (if so, why are you reading this?) Yes, that is his name. And finally, I love the movie, but I'm going to try to put in a little of the movie as possible. Important parts, yes. But parts we all know, not so much. Plus, there's Lucy. So she's bound to change a few things. *wink wink* Until next chapter! ~CtW[Chapter 22] And three years later, lets see what's been going on. Have you ever tried writing Jason Todd without using any swear words? It is very hard, let me tell you. Very hard. 3rd POV He raises the crowbar high. Jason can't move, he just stares in horror. The metal bar comes down, striking him on the cheek. \" If only you had escaped when you could,\" the voice says. ' There was no where to go,' Jason reminds himself. \" If only you were stronger,\" the voice continues. \" I was!\" Jason yells, but his screams are unheard. He's smacked to the floor, all the breath rushing out of his lungs. \" ..Poor, poor Jason,\" the voice says slowly. The figure stoops down, right next to his ear, \"If only you weren't so dependent,\" the voice whispers. Jason feels a hand on the back of his neck, pressing his face closer to the bloodstained concrete. \" Dependent on me .\" Jason opens his eyes. He stares at the simple tan ceiling of his room. It was the same nightmare as before. Joker was the plague of his nights, keeping him awake. And then there were the ones about the Lazarus Pit, waking up with green liquid filling his lungs, trapped in white wrappings; He felt like he was dying all over again. But recently, as he meditated on it, he found a new fear. It's a new threat to his sanity. Bruce. He had tormented him that night. It wouldn't have made sense if he hadn't had seen the news from Gotham the month before. Jason gets to use a tv sometimes, and he saw how Joker once again had escaped from Arkham, and once again, Batman had brought him to justice. But not before he killed a few dozen people. That brought Jason's vision to red. After three years, the maniac was still alive. He was still breathing . And so, Jason hadn't had many good nights since. Bruce was now the one that left him to die, not Joker. Jason sits up and rubs his face. His room is as simple as it can get. There's a wooden bed with lightweight sheets and a heavy rough blanket for cold nights snug to the corner. A chair sits opposite of it, facing the wooden door. A single square window is between the window and bed, glassless with a curtain when it rains. There's a small chest for any belongings at the foot of the bed. And then, a small dusty mirror hanging on the door. Jason swings his legs to the side of the bed, slipping on his boots. He stands and walks to the mirror. Green eyes and tanned skin greet him. His hair has been cut recently, no longer tickling his ear tips. The front bangs are stark white, courtesy of the Lazarus Pit. The rest of his hair is black. He had also shaved off any stubble that had grown in the last year. He didn't need that. He turns and dons the garb of the League of Shadows and exits the room. Walking down the halls, he passes the eating hall. He'll eat, but only after training. It was League rule. He turns out of the halls when he arrives at one of the many dojos. Talia looks up from her stretching. \"Jason. You're right on time.\" He nods. He walks over and gets into position. She mirrors him and they start to spar. He has trained with her and her assassins ever since he calmed down about having to stay with the League. He learned everything fast. But eventually, he's pinned, sweat rolling off of both of them. Talia stands up and walks over to the bench. She drinks from a water bottle. Nothing is offered to Jason. \"I have noticed something about you for some time, Jason,\" she says after having her fill, \"you are more.. Determined. As if there is a personal purpose to your training.\" \"I know that the League is not my place,\" Jason says coolly. \"Neither do I,\" Talia agrees, \"you are too.. Brash. You think before acting, don't take orders well. You despise it here.\" \"I don't exactly hide it,\" Jason mumbles. \"So what do you plan on doing?\" Talia asks. Jason looks at her, \"I'm going back to Gotham. Something is unfinished.\" \"I know I could stop you,\" Talia says, \"but as I said before, this is not your place. But one thing..\" Jason waits for her condition. \"Give my beloved my regards.\" Jason scoffs in his head, and smirks at her, \"No-\" He changes the second word in his head, 'Promises.' But he lets her head what she wants, \"-problem.\" Talia nods. Jason is excused to go eat. He steps into the hall where other Shadow assassins are. They all stare at him as he passes. Whether it's the white in his hair or how they know of his resurrection, he's never fit in. Even after three years. 'Well don't worry your butts off, I'm not staying,' he thinks, finding various words to call each person as he passes them. None of them Bruce would be happy to hear. Jason eats quickly, then jogs to his room and packs his stuff. He has a set of clothing with him that is more for outside use. His League garb would stick out like a sore thumb. He had asked Talia for the set a year ago. She allowed it because he had not caused trouble in a record amount of time. He even got to choose. It was a biker type outfit. The shirt was made of a loose gray fabric. But after he made some modifications to it -bullet-proof armor- it was tight to his front. The pants were black, and had multiple pockets for things he might need. The belt matched with a silver buckle in front. He keeps his boots, mainly because they aren't League issued. His gloves match the belt. Finally, he lifts out the leather jacket from the bottom of the chest. He had wanted one of them when he was younger. They looked so cool. But his is better than any of them. Because it has the same armor as the shirt. He dons his new attire and disposes of the black clothing on the bed. Picking up the small bag that has anything he'll need for the trip, he sneaks out his door. Even though Talia gave her blessing, it doesn't mean that Ra's will just let him waltz out without a word, or warning. So Jason planned his leave when there was a break in the guards. He silently maneuvers through the mansion of a building. He reaches the garage at the base of the bridge. He takes the keys of one of their vehicles -which happened to be a motorcycle- and drives over the bridge and into the night. When Ra's finds out, it'll be too late. Just filling in a few plot holes, like how he knows Bruce didn't kill Joker. He will get the helmet later. (Don't ask how. I don't know yet.) And the next chapter will be tomorrow! Hope this is enough to sate your curiosity for the end. And I know, Jason doesn't have a fluff of white in his hair in this version. But I like that, so I'm keeping it. (Yes I said fluff. Because that is what it is.) ~CtW[Chapter 23] I'm getting close to the movie scenes. (Boy, I need to find a way to watch that movie again. I'm rusty. *cringe*) Anyway, here's a pre-chapter to one of the scenes. And it has you-know-who in it. 3rd POV Lucy moves her head up and down from the teacher to her notes. Out of all the seminars she is scheduled to attend, this one is the more face paced. She types out anything the teacher says that she deems important, astrixing things she'll look up on her own time. The teacher finishes in conclusion and the class is dismissed. Lucy closes her laptop and stuffs it into her bag. She moves with the tide of students to fresh air. She's well into her first semester at the University of Gotham. On her way to the bus, she's stopped by an old peer from high school. \"Hey, Lucy,\" he says. \"Quinton,\" she says calmly, walking away. \"Hey.. hey, Luce, let's talk, alright?\" He asks. \"I have to catch my bus,\" she says. Quinton stops walking and opens his arms wide, \"C'mon Lucy! It's been years!\" Lucy stops dead in her tracks. He's right, it's been years, three to be exact. Three years ago, Jason returned home, but not for her to hold. Afterwards, Lucy had devoted herself to the career of her choice. She didn't leave room for a relationship. Unfortunately, all the guys at her high school hadn't taken the hint. She turns to look at him, \"You aren't my type,\" she says simply. She turns away and continues on her way. She waits at the stop for the long vehicle to arrive. Does she still miss Jason? Yes, of course! But she had found that the last three years weren't as bleak as she thought they would be. She has a good life and a man in her life is not a priority. 'Besides,' she tells herself, 'I already lost the one. Who else is there?' She steps onto the bus once it arrives. She shows the driver her pass and finds a seat. While the bus goes through its route, she reviews what she had gotten down for the class. Finally, it comes to a halt at the arch to a wealthier neighborhood. Lucy closes her laptop and walks off the bus. She strolls to the Wayne Manor gate. Once she passes the iron, she jogs the rest of the way. She forgets herself and knocks. Alfred opens the door. \"Ms. Lucy,\" he says, surprised, \"There is no need to knock. You know this.\" Lucy steps inside as she says, \"Sorry Alfred. It's just the polite thing to do.\" \"Considering how you've moved in since graduation, I find it hard to believe you don't take this as home,\" Alfred explains further. Lucy looks around briefly. Bruce had not only helped pay for college, but also had invited her to a place to stay. A new setting is good for a change of responsibility. \"I'll remember for next time,\" Lucy promises. She walks up the grand stairs and swiftly finds her room. She deposits her bag and computer in their places, then leaves to the kitchen to find a snack. She looks at the clock while picking out an apple. It's almost eight in the evening. Lucy has an idea where Bruce will be. She walks to the piano study. Barely looking at the keys, she presses the correct ones and walks down the stone steps. The cave is empty at first glance. \"Bruce?\" She asks. \"Busy,\" is his response. His voice carries from the armory. He arrives a moment later wearing his Batman suit. His cowl lays against his back. It's been updated several times in the last years, but to Lucy, it's the same as ever. \"How was the seminar?\" \"I think I caught enough of the material,\" Lucy says as he walks to the Batcomputer. \"Anything new here?\" \"Not much,\" he says, \"a few reports came in. Nothing the police can't handle.\" Lucy nods to herself. She eyes the glass case. Jason's costume hangs there, untouched. She looks back at Bruce without changing her posture. He's looking at the screens with his arms crossed. He's waiting for something to happen, something to capture his attention. Bruce may not look like it on the outside most of the time, but there are small moments where there is a crack. And passed the crack, a hole that can't be filled by anything else. He lost a part of himself, something Lucy understands. There's an alert from the speakers, making Lucy jump. Bruce takes it and then pulls on his cowl. \"What is it?\" \"There's a truck that has a stolen weapon transported into Gotham,\" he replies, slipping into his gravelly Batman voice. \"..What kind of weapon?\" Lucy asks. Batman looks over his shoulder, \"An android.\" He leaves with the batmobile. Lucy looks around the cave, for something to do. She eyes the workout area with the punching bag and weights. She isn't looking to be a crime fighter, but staying in shape was never a bad thing. Before she can decide to change into her workout clothes, she hears the roar of a smaller engine. Nightwing arrives on his cycle. He comes to a stop at a spare platform and looks around. \"..Where's the big guy?\" He asks Lucy. \"He just left. Some kind of android,\" Lucy says. Nightwing nods. \"He'll need help with it, whether he wants it or not.\" Nightwing swings his bike around and speeds out after the batmobile. Lucy turns to looks back at the case of Jason's costume. She walks over to it and places her hand on the cool glass. She sighs, wishing once again that he'd be there. Little does she know she'll get her wish. Hope she's prepared. I'll probably just use YouTube with watching it (since it ain't on Netflix anymore.. *Bat-broods a little*) Catch you on the flip side! ~CtW[Chapter 24] Sorry about missing yesterday, I was busy and couldn't find a good place to watch the movie. (I would prefer to not have to buy it, so iTunes was out.) But here's the next chapter, right into the movie. 3rd POV Batman looks up from the scumbags he snatched on their way to the stolen truck. Said truck just started off at breakneck speed. He drops them and sprints after the truck, leaping from large storage bins to keep the higher ground. Nightwing arrives on the scene just as he leaves. He sees the punks dazed on the ground. \"I'm still rounding up the henchmen,\" he sighs to himself. He walks over and ties them to a post until the cops arrive. Then he follows his former partner to the truck. Batman takes a running leap into the air, then extends his cape. It allows him to glide down to the truck. \"-think you lost him,\" one of the perps in the truck tells the driver, \"I think we're good.\" Batman swings around and lands on the hood. \"No,\" he states roughly, \"you're anything but good.\" The passenger to the far left takes out a gun and blasts a hole in the windshield. But Batman jumps to safety. He hangs on as the truck's tires are scrapped. He pulls one of the perps out by his hair, the other screaming at the lost of control. The vehicle careens into the storage bins on its side. He jumps down to the ground and walks to the other side of the truck. A perp is reaching for the shotgun laying nearby, but Batman crushes his fingers without a misstep. The perp yells in agony. Batman lifts him out of the seat and a foot off the ground. \"Who are you working for?\" He asks. \"N-Nobody! Look, we just boosted the truck, an-\" \"Lie to me again, and crashing head on into a wall will be the least painful activity of your evening,\" Batman warns. \"No! I swear to-\" The two turn and look at what is beeping. A metal crate had fallen out during the chase, now making the beeping sound. Batman lowers the terrified man, his focus diverted to the box. The beeping continues, then air comes out from the sides. The box slides open. An orange and green android is curled up inside. It looks up at the humans nearby. Batman cuffs the men in the truck. \"What is that?\" The man with the injured hand asks, staring at the android. \"Your cargo,\" Batman answers simply. Said cargo stands up, its red eyes fixed on Batman. It steps out of the box. \"It's called Amazo.\" \"What the heck is an 'Amazo?'\" He's asked. \"A highly advanced cybernetic android equipped with the power to absorb the abilities of superhumans,\" Batman answers. \"What kind of superhumans?\" Amazo locks his hands together and smashes at the ground, creating a shock wave that breaks the concrete apart. Batman flips to avoid it, landing on the overturned truck. \"Big ones.\" He runs at Amazo. He throws a smoke bomb and delivers an uppercut. But Amazo is unfazed. Batman kicks him as he goes over and interlocks his hands to land a blow on the androids neck. Batman goes for another punch, but his wrist is caught and he's thrown back to the truck. \"Packs quite the punch for a toaster on steroids huh?\" Batman looks up to see Nightwing, who recently arrived. \"Need a hand?\" \"No.\" WIth that, Batman turns back to the fight. \"Okay, how about I just stick around and watch?\" Nightwing asks himself as he leaps to the ground. Amazo throws a large storage bin at the heroes. Batman ducks to avoid it. But Nightwing has to leap as it slams into the bins behind him. He can hear the crooks behind him as he runs to Batman's aid. \"-The pretty boy in the leotard?\" \"That's Nightwing, he was the Bat's first sidekick, the first Robin.\" 'Don't call me a sidekick,' Nightwing internally says without thinking twice. He takes out brass knuckles and kicks Amazo in the chin. He flips back and rips the artificial skin away from Amazo's left eye. The android turns just in time to see Batman swinging in for a kick. Both Batman and Nightwing fire their grappling hooks. They reel them in, punching simultaneously as they pass Amazo. Batman fires a batarang and it glances off Amazo's chest. \"I think you'll have to do better than that, boss,\" Nightwing states. \"I did.\" Nightwing looks back to see the batarang come back and attach itself to Amazo's leg. It goes off, creating a blast radius of ten feet. \"Will that do any good?\" Nightwing asks. \"It'll slow him down,\" Batman answers as they run. Not much later, two storage bins go flying behind them. Amazo appears, covered in flames. \"Think so?\" Nightwing asks, looking back. \"Get to higher ground!\" Batman orders. They fire their grappling hooks again. Amazo just takes off after them. \"Did you know he could fly?\" Nightwing asks. \"Move!\" Batman swings out of the way, but Nightwing gets pummelled by the emblazoned android. Batman adjusts course after them. He runs along a building still being constructed and attaches the bat of his grappling hook on Amazo's metal foot. He's pulled along with. \"I wouldn't be offended by a few suggestions!\" Nightwing yells as he tries to get free of the iron grip. \"He has the same weak points as a human being!\" Batman yells, trying to help. \"Got it,\" Nightwing takes out two thin knives. \"This might sting a bit.\" He forcefully inserts them into Amazo's ears. The android howls at the pain. He drops Nightwing. The black and blue hero free falls. He lands on Batman, who saw him coming and glides to safety. Amazo crashes in the same storage alley as them. They stare him down, wondering if it was over. But it wasn't, Amazo stands up. He shoots lasers at them with his eyes. They duck. \"Lasers, he's got lasers!\" Nightwing says, borderline panic. They split up as Amazo continues this approach. He goes after Nightwing, who flips away from the red beams with his acrobatic training. Batman sneaks up behind him and sticks gray puddy over his eyes. He lands next to Nightwing as Amazo tries to get it off. \"I don't puddy in his eye is going to stop him,\" Nightwing says. Batman lifts a detonator and presses the button. Amazo's head blows off from the impact. \"..But plastique will. Nice.\" Amazo falls over, spilling oil on the ground. Batman stares the android down, narrowing his eyes. 'Who let the android get into the hands of the men in the truck.' He turns away, back to where he left the men. Nightwing follows him. Next chapter will be out today too. Until then-! ~CtW[Chapter 25] Like I said, I'm back for another today. 3rd POV \"This shipment was meant for the Black Mask, I doubt you're behind this. Who do you work for?\" Batman asks the three. Nightwing hangs back near the truck, watching the interrogation. \"I swear, we don't work for anybody, this was our gig, all our idea,\" one says. Batman waits a beat before turning to Nightwing. \"Let it go.\" \"Right.\" Nightwing presses a button and allows the metal corpse of Amazo fall straight to the three handcuffed crooks. \"I'll talk! I'll talk just stop!\" The android is lifted up and Batman walks closer. \"The Red Hood, we're working for the Red Hood. We didn't have any choice, he's gonna-\" The man cries out and slumps forward. He's followed by his companions. Batman and Nightwing take cover. \"The shots came from the rooftop, a sniper,\" Nightwing states. Batman looks at the corpses. \"A good one,\" Nightwing adds, seeing Batman's gaze. Batman steps out and looks at the rooftop with binoculars. They zoom in on a shadowy figure stowing his sniper and sprinting away. \"See him?\" \"Yeah.\" Batman calls his jet and it releases a rope for him to hold onto. \"Hey wait!\" Nightwing yells as he pursues the shooter. \"Right..\" Nightwing turns to the others, \"and I've got them.\" Batman pulls into the cockpit and follows the figure on the rooftops. Then he jumps down and gets into a blue car. Batman continues chase through the streets, even through a tunnel filled with cars. He shoots a grappling hook at the car and it pulls him out of the tunnel. Batman pulls back, forcing the front wheels of the car to come off the road. The driver releases the cover of the car, bringing Batman right back to square one. The car leads him to an abandoned warehouse and crashes through the front entrance. Batman deploys and free falls to the roof. Crashing through the skylights, he crouches to absorb the impact. He looks around to see no one else. There are vats of red hot liquid below him. He sees the blue car, post collision course with one of the vats. He turns to his right and sees a silver 'T' in the guard rail one walk way over. The rest of the metal is rusted, but that one cross section is new. It was from his encounter with the Joker, before he was the Joker. He was the original Red Hood. He was so close to cuffing him. He tried to take the big red helmet off, but tripped and fell into one of the vats. Next thing he knew, there was a pale and crazy creep running around with a thing against bats; One in particular. Batman, who is now standing next to the spot it happened, senses someone is watching him. He looks up to his right, seeing a man in a leather jacket and red helmet pointing a gun at him. \"Hard to forget that night, huh?\" The new Red Hood asks, \"In a way, Batman , this was the site of your first big failure. Maybe your greatest. ..But certainly not your last, right ?\" Batman narrows his eyes at him, smarting from the mention of his late sidekick. \"Ahh, memories,\" Red Hood says casually. Before Batman can say anything, he points the gun at the car and it bursts into flames. Batman protects himself from the blast, but Red Hood escapes. Batman chases after him, using his bat grappling hook to reach his level. The car explodes more and it tears through the walkway just in front of the Dark Knight. He starts to fall to the red liquid, so he fires his grappling hook. His boots skim across the surface before he's pulled to safety. The liquid below him catches fire and shoots him into the air. He rolls and watches the inferno, looking for the Red Hood. But he's gone, and Batman knows he hasn't see the last of him yet. Batman's first encounter with Red Hood. Lucy will be in the next chapter, I'm sure. But I need a night off. Two chapters (even if one is short) is enough for one day. Plus.. I have homework. ~CtW[Chapter 26] Here's a little bit more for you faithful readers. 3rd POV Jason looks around, checking if anyone is in his area. But there's nothing at this time of night. He jumps the fence and starts jogging passed stone after stone. He comes to the one he's looking for. 'Mom..' He kneels next to it. 'It's happening Mom. I'm ready. He's hurt enough people..' The graveyard is silent. 'He's not going to make this city suffer anymore. And I'm not going to stand by and keep my toes off the line.' His attention is diverted to the base of the stone. There are pieces of white paper, dirtied over time by the wind spraying particles over it. He picks one up. 'Lucy..' She's still been coming here. He looks up. There's a grave right next to it. He hasn't come here in the past years because he was too busy. But he sees his own grave, where his friend and family think he is. And just like his mother's, there are letters at the base; three of them. Only his are in envelopes signed to him. He stands up and walks over to them. He picks them up. Her handwriting has gotten neater over the years, if that was even possible. He looks at the engraving they had hid. - In memory of a son, brother, and boyfriend who left the world too soon- He tried to keep Lucy out of mind. He doesn't want her to get caught up in this. But seeing how she hasn't forgotten him, he's now toying with the idea of seeing her again. He takes the letter back to his place. Unlocking his helmet, he sets it next to him. The first letter is on the bottom. He opens it up and reads: Dear Jason, I guess you already know about my family's tradition, so happy birthday. I miss you. I know it's been about three months, but the ache hasn't changed. I wonder if it ever will. The school year has come to a close, and summer is upon me. The blue rose you gave me is still perfect. I don't have too much to say here. Everyone misses you. Bruce is still more broody than usually. ..I love you Jason. More than I had time to tell you, -Lucy Blake Jason puts the letter down. He picks up the second one. It's about the end of her junior school year, thinking about graduating without him, starting to get ready to go to college. He reads through the many things she wanted to tell him, and he actually laughs a tiny bit before steeling himself again. He puts that letter down and finds the last one. This one, he reads carefully, because it was written no less than four months ago. He stops and stares at one statement though. Since I'll be going to the University of Gotham, I wanted to get out of my parents' house. So Bruce offered to let me stay at the manor. 'She lives with Bruce?' Jason asks himself. Lucy was working on her college assignments after Nightwing left. But after she finished the second one, she wondered when they would get back. She walked down to the Batcave and found it empty. She curls up on the chair to wait and ends up falling asleep. The batmobile roars into the cave, followed by Nightwing's bike. Lucy wakes up and rubs her eyes. \"How did it go?\" She asks. Bruce takes off his cowl and walks over to her, not making a move to reply. \"As expected,\" Nightwing says for him, \"it's Gotham, there's mystery.\" Lucy moves away from the computer so Bruce can take a seat. \"This bit of intel is what brought me to town,\" Nightwing says as he takes his place next to Bruce, \"Good thing I've always had perfect timing.\" He plugs a flash drive into the computer console. \"Take a look.\" A video appears on the screen. It pauses and zooms in on someone running on the rooftops. Lucy stares at the figure in the red helmet. \"I got this shot from a snitch. He says this guy's been making some serious moves.\" \"Who is he?\" Lucy asks, at a loss. \"The Red Hood,\" Bruce answers. \"Might be, he bares a resemblance to the original,\" Nightwing comments as Bruce types away. He brings up more pictures of past Red Hoods, including the one that Joker was for a short while. \"Several criminals have utilized this persona,\" Bruce states, filling Lucy in. \"One criminal of particular interest though, huh?\" Nightwing asks. \"Who?\" Lucy asks. But her question goes unheard. \"But he's locked up,\" Nightwing continues. \"Not his MO, either,\" Bruce adds, \"there's been an uptake in heavy trafficking, but crime is down.\" Alfred walks over with a tray, \"Indeed it is. Master Bruce got almost three hour's sleep in the last two days.\" Nightwing pours some sugar into a cup. \"True busman's holiday,\" Alfred quips. \"But he is locked up, like, a lot locked up,\" Nightwing reminds, stirring his cup. Alfred moves to Lucy next, who takes a cup and lets it warm her hands. It's always cold in the Cave. \"Maybe we should go for a visit.\" \"To who?\" Lucy asks. \"The Joker.\" Nightwing looks from Bruce's empty chair to the Batmobile. \"Could you just once say 'let's get in the car'?\" Nightwing asks, jogging to the Batmobile, \"is that so hard?\" He leaps over Bruce's side and into the passenger seat. The Batmobile races out of the cave. Lucy stares after them. 'The Joker.' At Arkham Asylum, down countless stairs, through hundreds of hallways, and behind fortified doors, one pale faced maniac looks back and forth between the two masked heroes. He is the first to break the silence. \"You look good, been working out?\" The two don't even blink. \"You could use a little sun. Then again.. Who am I to talk?\" He belts out a string of laughs. Batman waits until he calms down a little, \"He's calling himself the Red Hood,\" he explains, placing a picture on the table. Joker looks at it a moment. \"What do you know about it?\" \"That he has horrible taste,\" Joker comments, \"When I wore that number it was flashy. More materdie than motorcycle fetish. ..Ohh, these kids today.\" \"If you're behind this in any way,\" Nightwing warns, leaning forward and pointing his finger at Joker, \"we will find out. You're not-\" \"Oh bird boy, you're so much less fun now,\" Joker interrupts, \"all grown up and in your big boy pants. ..Still..\" he thinks aloud, looking at Batman, \"better off than his replacement, right?\" Batman doesn't show any emotion, but he's raging just passed the surface. \"Hard to be tough in the yuks when you're worm food..\" Joker continues. Batman reaches across the table and yanks Joker by his chains. He hits the door. Batman picks him up by his neck and pins him to the wall, glaring like he could burn a hole in his head. Joker's feet aren't even touching the floor. \"You gonna do it this time?\" Joker asks, smiling, \"Or are you just going to put me in another body cast for six months?\" He continues to smile, while trying to breathe. Batman seriously considered squeezing hard enough. Nightwing stands behind him, ready in case he's needed. He starts to reach out when he thinks Batman was going to, but then he lets go. Joker hits the floor with a hard thud. Joker takes a moment to regain even breathing.\"..So disappointing. But, back to the matter at hand.\" He looks up at Batman, \"This new hoodie. You really think I would stir up so much trouble, and not make sure you knew it was me ?\" Joker starts laughing again. Batman stares him down, realizing he was right. He walks out of the room, Nightwing on his heels. Joker stays on the floor, laughing his head off. 'It isn't Joker. It can't be Black Mask. So who on Earth is the Red Hood?' Jason going to the cemetery might be a little OOC, I know. But it leads up to something later. I might get another chapter out today, I might not. ~CtW[Chapter 27] Here's the next update. 13 days till NaNo! I'm really excited. All the more reason to get this done. 3rd POV Bruce sits at the batcomputer, tuning in on the bug he placed in Black Mask's office. The crime lord himself has a knack of ranting loudly to his secretary, who calmly answers or corrects him. \"He did what!? WHAT!?\" 'Looks like Black Mask just found out what happened to his shipment,' Bruce notes. \"Our concern is the one who ordered the theft of the android. He goes by the name, Red Hood,\" the secretary answers. \"I don't care what he's calling himself. Do you know how many bidders I had going on Amazo? A list of puppet dictators and psychos as long as my arm . Millions shot! And whose money is that!?\" \"Your money.\" \" My money! Mine!\" Bruce hears the subtle squeak of a chair, indicating Black Mask stood up. \"This score was a game changer. Amazo was going to buy my way up in the high end international trafficking. Now I'm forced to keep rooting around in this local leg breaking garbage ! \"And ta give me bat trouble, who blows the robots head off! ..I could have at least sold if for scrap, but Batman kept it.\" \"Yes. Batman likes to keep things,\" the secretary agrees. \"..Look, this circus act, this.. Red Foot.\" \"Red Hood.\" \"Whatever. He's dead. Take care of it.\" Bruce leans back as Black Mask starts to chew out a new recruit. But perks back up once their shipment is mentioned. A new voice comes through, \"Yes sir. It's ten cases of assorted SMG's and PDWs. Along with forty-five caliber ASP rats, your personal favorite, and two cases of RPGs. It's all bought and paid for, so this is strictly a delivery, not a buy. And due to recent events, I've doubled the security detail and switched the drop spot.\" Bruce listens to the new rendezvous point and calls for Grayson. They need to get their before the deal goes down. Jason listens to his own radio, which is linked to Black Mask's headquarters. \"Sounds like a plan,\" he comments to himself. Black Mask won't know what hit him. Batman and Nightwing wait on a rooftop close to the rendezvous point. \"Keep your eyes peeled,\" the Dark Knight comments. \"That's ironic, coming from you,\" Nightwing says. When Batman doesn't react, he turns to face him, \"You know, bats don't have good eyesight-\" \"I got it,\" Batman says gruffly. He watches the landing platform with binoculars. A group is waiting as a chopper comes into view. \"Here we go.\" When the chopper lands, one figure walks over to it. He has a gray hood over his head, so neither hero can identify him. After a moment, the two pilots are thrust out of the chopper. They fall onto the others in the group, who, upon further inspection, had their hands tied under their coats and legs bound at the ankles. They fall over like bowling pins. \"Looks like that's our cue,\" Nightwing says, following Batman only a split second after. They use their grappling hooks to land on the platform, carrying a large harpoon with. The chopper has already started to take off. Nightwing positions the harpoon and fires. It hits the chopper and sends an electric wave through it, messing with the controls. \"..And I almost thought he wouldn't show.\" Red Hood says from the pilot seat. He looks to his left and sees the two staring at the chopper. \"You know what I missed most about running with you?\" Nightwing asks Batman, \"the toys.\" \"Stay sharp, we're not done.\" \"You wanna dance!\" Red Hood asks loud enough for them to hear, \"Let's dance.\" He tilts the chopper so it starts falling to the street below. \"Is that going to hold?\" \"No.\" Batman takes the harpoon gun from Nightwing and runs to the edge of the platform. \"So, you want me to- should I-? ..Okay,\" Nightwing takes out a device from his gauntlets, \"I'll just take care of this.\" Batman leaps off the building and dives to the chopper. A figure in a red helmet leaves the helicopter and lands safely on a building. Civilians on the street below watch Batman attach a harpoon to the chopper then the other end goes to the building above. The bottom end of the chopper barely brushes a car on the street. Batman slides down the cable until Nightwing swings into view. He reaches out and grabs hold, bringing his former mentor with. They see Red Hood up ahead on a ledge. He turns and starts to run. They land and chase after him. He jumps off the ledge and across the street. The building he aims for is under construction. He breaks through the boards he lands on and rolls down the ones beneath. The two heroes aren't too far behind him. He races across one side of the building, then cuts through the middle when Batman throws a batarang at him. He breaks his way through an unfinished wall and grabs a canister in passing. Red Hood jumps off the building and throws the canister back as Batman reaches the edge. He takes out one of his guns and fires. The canister explodes. Batman leaps back. He and Nightwing take shelter behind stacks of wood. When the moment is over, they follow Red Hood through the broken window. They chase him across another unfinished building until he runs out of space and jumps. Red Hood tuck and rolls, not breaking his stride the whole time. He leaps over building edges, smoothly landing on the next ones. He rounds a bend and leaps to a blimp passing by. He turns around, taking a knee and unholstering both his guns. He waits. Batman rounds the corner. Red Hood open fires, forcing the dark knight to retreat just out of range. \"He's good,\" Nightwing comments. \"Yes, he's putting on quite a show,\" Batman says dryly. He turns on one of the special visors in his cowl and looks around the corner. He doesn't see anything on the blimp, but a lone figure scampers across one of the buildings near it. He runs across the ledges until he meets with the blimp. He jumps and runs, jumping again right after. He hears Nightwing land on the concrete behind him. Red Hood is once again on a ledge. Batman throws a cable at his foot as he jumps off. But Red Hood twists around and slices the cable off his ankle with a knife. \"He's very good,\" Nightwing corrects, catching up. Red Hood bounces off a few building corners, landing on a narrow ledge going nowhere. \"We got him.\" But Red Hood leaps off and lands feet first through the glass of a train station. \"That's impressive.\" \"Nothing we haven't seen before.\" \"If you say so.\" Batman and Nightwing arrive through the broken glass, looking around. \"..Think we lost him?\" Batman turns around and sees the bomb he heard ticking mere seconds ago. \"Move!\" They duck and cover as the bomb goes off. The column it was attached to falls to bits and something above them falls over. They hear the rev of a motorcycle. Batman looks up, but Nightwing is painfully nursing an injured ankle. Red Hood is sitting on a red motorcycle, looking back at them. A train horn sounds on the opposite track. \"You haven't lost you touch-\" The train drowns out his words. The train curves around him and the heroes rush to get off the track. When the train exits the station, the motorcycle, and rider, is gone. I just love Rightwing's quips. Almost as good as Alfred's. Next up will have more of Lucy.[Chapter 28] Here's the next one. It's MEA weekend here, so I hope to get lots done. 3rd POV Jason sets his helmet on the simple bed of his apartment. He peels off the green mask underneath and changes into what Bruce would call 'civilian clothes.' He puts the hood of his gray jacket over his head and walks out the door. Without his get up, he blends into the crowd. Jason stops at a pay phone. It's impulsive, reckless, and even selfish to not focus on his mission. But he can't get her out of his head. 'Besides, Bats will find out soon anyway. I gave him just enough to figure it out,' Jason reasons. He pays for the call and dials the number. As it rings, Jason has a fleeting, terrifying thought, 'What if Alfred picks up?' Lucy is casually reading when the phone rings. She waits a moment, but nothing happens. She looks around. 'Hmm, Alfred must be busy.' She stands up and jogs to the phone in the hall. But before she can take it off the receiver, it stops. 'Stupid, stupid, stupid,' Jason tells himself. He had hung up before the butler could answer. 'He'd probably think I'm a ghost. ..Though, he isn't far off.' He stares at the phone. 'Well.. what's the chance he is the one to pick up?' He asks himself. After thinking about it, Jason sighs, \"ninety-nine out of one hundred..\" Lucy looks at the phone a moment, then turns away. She takes five steps. Bring! Bring! She stops and looks back. Bring! Bring! Lucy walks back over and picks up the phone. The ringing stops as it connects. She puts it to her ear. \"Hello?\" Jason holds his breath. \"..This is the Wayne residence, who am I speaking to?\" It's her. She answered. But the moment he needs it, Jason's tongue gets caught in his throat. \".. Hello ?\" Lucy asks, annoyed. Jason fidgets in his spot. 'Come on coward, spit it out!' \"Okay, look,\" Lucy decides, \"I'm going to hang up if-\" \"Lucy,\" Jason quietly blurts. Lucy pauses. \"I'm sorry.. Do I know you?\" \"..Yes,\" Jason says. He looks at his shoes, \"Yes you do..\" When Lucy doesn't reply, he continues, \"I'm sorry I'm late. But I fulfilled my promise, Lucy..\" \"I came home.\" Lucy thinks over his words. 'The voice.. It sounds familiar-' \" I promise, Lucy.. No matter how long it takes me.\" Lucy almost drops the phone. \"-and I know it's been three years,\" he says, rambling even if she isn't fully listening, \"But I-\" \"Jason..?\" Lucy asks. She's barely breathing. \"Yeah, Lucy. It's Jason.\" Lucy's shock melts as she furrows her eyebrows. \"Liar! Jason's dead!\" \"Lucy, I'm not-\" \"Yes he is! He's dead. We buried him! Just leave me alone!\" She slams the phone back onto the receiver. She still grips the phone in her hand, squeezing it like a viper. Fresh tears form around her eyes. Lucy takes a few deep breaths and stands straight. She lets go of the phone and wipes her eyes. 'Calm down.. It's just a prank.' She turns away to go back to her book, but then looks at the phone longingly. 'But it sounded just like him. Only.. older.' Jason stares at the phone, the tone at a constant hum after disconnection. His anger of being hung up on -by his girlfriend no less- simmer down when reality hits him. 'What did I expect? She's right, they think they buried me..' He puts the phone back and walks back to his apartment. Meanwhile, Bruce is looking over the video from his cowl visor. Red Hood runs along one of the many ledges. \"He's got some moves, huh?\" Nightwing asks. He's currently sitting on a cot as Alfred wraps his leg. \"And as much as I hate to belabor a point-\" \"And that is often exactly what you do,\" Alfred cuts in. \"I'm chatty, it's part of my charm,\" Nightwing argues casually, \"I'm saying that our boy here has some skills. He's been trained and trained well. Like right there!\" He points out as Red Hood cuts the cable. \"That! He sliced that cable off his ankle before it went taut. You don't just do that. It has to be practiced,\" Nightwing leans back on the cot, \" learned .\" \"And then there's the knife,\" Bruce adds. \"What about it?\" \"You know many knives that can cut my lines?\" Nightwing understands, \"Not many.\" \"No,\" Bruce looks back at the video, \"Not many.\" \"Well look,\" Nightwing carefully swings his injured leg over to his other, \"we obviously got ourselves a player, we- ow!\" He clutches the leg, still in pain. \"Alfred, take him home,\" Bruce says. \"Bruce, I can still help,\" he argues. Bruce turns to him, \"You already have, thank you.\" Bruce then turns back to the batcomputer. \"Go rest up.\" \"..Okay. But, you know where to find me when you need me,\" Nightwing relents as he stands up. Alfred hands Nightwing a pair of crutches. Nightwing looks over his shoulder at Bruce. \"He did just.. thank me, right?\" \"Indeed he did, sir,\" Alfred agrees. Nightwing turns back and starts to walk away with the aid of the crutches. \"Weird.\" Bruce brings up another video. \"You haven't lost your touc-\" The train blocks out the rest of the sound. He rewinds it again and listens. \"You haven't lost your touch-\" He centers in on a bit of the video. He plays it back again. \"-Haven't lost your touch, B-\" He tries again, focusing more on that bit. \"-Your touch Br-\" Bruce narrows his gaze and tries one last time. \"You haven't lost your touch, Bruce,\" comes through clearly. Bruce stands up, knocking his chair over in the process. He stares at the picture of Red Hood. 'Could it be...?' Was Jason calling a little OOC? Maybe. But again, who knows? And now Batman knows. And we are almost halfway through the movie. How many more chapters do you think there will be? ~CtW[Chapter 29] I almost forgot about this scene. You'd think I wouldn't. Well, I was wrong. You won't see Lucy until the next chapter. For now, enjoy. 3rd POV Bruce is staring at the glass holding Jason's Robin costume. He recalls ever since he was a boy, fighting by his side. Sometimes he was a little to aggressive. 'But this?' Bruce wonders, 'how is this Jason?' He turns away, shaking off the memories for now. The bat computer beeps. He walks over and finds out a club had been ransacked by what looked like Black Mask's men. Upon further investigation, Bruce deduces that Red Hood had taken over that part of Black Mask's business. 'Taking the fight to him now?' Bruce muses. He pulls his cowl up and takes the batmobile to investigate. He arrives on the scene, keeping to the shadows. He finds a trail of blood come from one of the doors. He follows it to where a car used to be. There are skid marks, proving a fast retreat, but they disappear after a few feet. Batman takes to the rooftops and runs down the street the car must have gone down. In the distance, he hears a fight in progress. Sure enough, in an abandoned lot, four armored assassins are taking on Red Hood, and winning. \"I thought you'd put up more of a fight,\" one of the assassins comments. \"Oh.. the fight hasn't started yet,\" Red Hood says, even though he's kneeling on the ground. He looks up at them, \"I'm just stalling.\" Bruce doesn't watch any longer. He throws a pair of batarangs, which embed themselves in a blue clad assassin's arm. The other three look up. Batman glides down and lands. He stands up, waiting. The largest of the four rush him. But Batman deflects the blow, jabbing him in the throat. He pushes the large man away. Red Hood stands up behind him. \"What the hell took you so long?\" He asks, taunting the caped crusader. Batman turns to look over his shoulder, \"Shut up and fight.\" They separate, taking on different members of the group. The switch opponents every few hits, never staying in one place for too long. Red Hood comes in contact with the girl of the group. She swings one of her light swords at him. It pierces through his jacket sleeve, making him yelp in pain. Meanwhile, Batman is fighting off the Cyclops character, keeping the largest of the bunch in his peripheral vision. Said assassin is lifting up a car, ready to throw it at either of his opponents. He chooses Batman as Cyclops jumps away. Batman rushes forward and takes the route through the car's back seats. He comes out the other side and places a device on his shoulder. The green clad assassin looks at the device, but it goes off, carrying him up into the air and away from the battle. Cyclops jumps at Batman again, but he gets the same treatment. Only, he hits a wall before he's blasted too far away. Red Hood is still taking on the swordswoman, flipping off of a column for an advantage. He twists her arm around and elbows between her shoulder blades, stunning her. He turns her around and head butts her for good measure. She falls limp to the ground. Batman takes on the final opponent with the light up bo staff. He clocks him in the chin, then breaks the staff in half. He falls unconscious. \"I gotta say, I missed watching you work,\" Red Hood comments. Cyclops lands behind them, near the edge of the area. He sends a blast from the one eye of his suit at the pair. \"Look out!\" Red Hood pushes Batman to the side, but gets hit in the chest from the blast. Batman throws batarangs, but they are all dodged. He weaves back and forth as he rushes the assassin, avoiding the blasts aimed at him. He throws smoke bombs, but they do nothing as Cyclops runs through the wall of vapor. They go hand to hand, and Batman falls to the ground. Cyclops looks at Batman a moment, but then his attention is deterred by the image of Red Hood sitting up. He walks over, kicks him so he's back on the ground, then pins his arms and legs. \"Awful close. You afraid you'll miss?\" Red Hood taunts. \"Black Mask just wants a body. We don't need your head,\" Cyclops answers, charging up his eye. \"Let him go,\" Batman says. Both look at him. \"And step away.\" Batman is holding a taser out in front of him, charged and ready. \"A taser?\" Cyclops stands up and holds Red Hood in front of him. He keeps his hand on Red Hood's throat, who's struggling. \"Nail me and you electrocute both of us.\" Red Hood takes out a taser he had up his sleeve. \"Maybe that's what he has in mind.\" With that, he sticks the taser into the single eye of the armor and turns it on. Cyclops lets go of him and screams. His blood splatters the wall behind him. \"No!\" Batman yells. The body hits the ground. Red Hood looks at it a moment before turning to Batman. \"Just be happy I only killed one of them. They're all assassins.\" \"And what are you?\" Batman asks. \"I'm cleaning up Gotham.\" Red Hood turns around, \"More than you ever did.\" \"You're stealing territory from Black Mask and killing anyone that gets in your way,\" Batman corrects. \"Black Mask, is just a part of the plan,\" Red Hood says over his shoulder. \"Plan? You're becoming a crime lord.\" \"Yes!\" Red Hood turns around. \"You can't stop crime. That's what you never understood. I'm controlling it. You want to rule them by fear. But what do you do with the ones that aren't afraid. I'm doing what you won't, I'm taking them out .\" 'Is this really Jason?' Batman wonders. \"Tell me what happened. Let me help,\" he tries, taking a step forward. Red Hood looks surprised for a moment, even with his helmet, but then he looks away, \"It's too late. You had your chance,\" he takes a small canister out of his jacket. He throws it between them and it sends out a screen of smoke. Batman puts his cape up, covering his mouth and nose. Before he completely disappears from view, Red Hood says, \"And I'm just getting started.\" Batman walks out of the smoke with a breather on his face. He doesn't see Red Hood anywhere. But he spots one of the swords used in the fight. The same one that injured Red Hood, with blood on it. And now I'm up to the point I thought I was at last chapter.[Chapter 30] I was going to have this be longer, but I'll tell why it isn't at the bottom A/N. 3rd POV The blood on the sword is scanned at the Batcave. Bruce waits at the computer for the analysis to be finished. On the screen is a picture of both Red Hood and of Jason. When it finishes, he looks at the top of the screen. MATCH He hears a shatter behind him. He turns to look, seeing Alfred staring at the screen, with a tray and broken dishes at his feet. Bruce turns back to the screen, feeling every bit the same as Alfred's face portrays. Only, he doesn't show it. \"..Don't tell Lucy, okay Alfred,\" Bruce says, his calm betraying his emotions. It takes a moment for Alfred to compose himself enough to say, \"Of course, Master Bruce.\" Bruce can hears his voice shaking. Alfred picks up the tray and broken china. He starts for the stairs, then stops and looks back, \"I can't imagine the reaction she would have to such news.\" \"So! Are you telling me that scumbag stole my guns again !?\" Black Mask rants. His guards swallow thickly. It wasn't the greatest job protecting their boss, because no one could protect them from him when he's angry. \"No sir,\" his secretary states, \"He destroyed them. Blew up the truck, the drivers-\" Black Mask swears just over his breath, \"Of all the-\" \"Previously, he was enlisting anyone under our province to come work for him. Now he's just.. Killing them.\" \"Oh, so now we've got another Batman? One that doesn't mind the blood?\" Black Mask taunts. \"No sir, he's no Batman. He's still taking huge cuts from off the streets,\" the secretary states, \"But now, he's eliminating the competition. He's coming after you .\" The silence in the room is palpable. One of the guards coughs. Black Mask looks at him, then throws his desk to the side of the room. \"You wanna tell me why this guy ain't dead !?\" He asks as he storms passed her. \"We're trying. We sent the fearsome hand of four.\" Black Mask starts to punch every other guard as he replies, \"Four! Guess they're gonna need a new name. ..Why hasn't Batman wiped this little smear off the face of the planet!?\" \"Maybe he doesn't want to. Perhaps he letting you and the Red Hood war it out. He could be waiting-\" \"To take on the winner?\" Black Mask finishes, hitting another guy, \"What do you think this is? A tennis tournament!?\" Another guy hits the floor. \"I'm just saying-\" \"You're an idiot!\" He yells as he walks passed her again. \"And you don't know Batman. He's not letting this lunatic just, run wild. He can't catch him either! Or..\" He looks up out the window, \"It's something else. ..Can't you feel it? We're stuck in the crossfire.\" Not a moment after, a red dot appears on his expensive suit and trails to his neck. He looks down at it, then sees the shooter out the window; Red Hood. Black Mask gasps. Red Hood notices and takes one hand off the big gun to wave. He aims at Black Mask's forehead. \"..Oh, hell..\" He turns and runs at the door, pushing one of his guards down again. His secretary follows suit. The doors burst open and all of the inhabitants of the room exit. \"Wow,\" Red Hood comments, \"he sure can move when he really wants to.\" He aims the bazooka at the large glass window and fires. It whistles through the air and explodes after crashing through the glass and hitting the table in the center. A fierce explosion takes over the top of the building. Red Hood watches for a little. \"That ought to get his attention,\" Jason thinks, \"I'm getting closer.\" He stands up and discards the cannon to the side. He runs over rooftops until he is back at his apartment. He again takes off the Red Hood helmet and the uniform that goes with it. But he doesn't go out completely defenseless. Then Jason walks back to the telephone booth he used previous. He stares at the phone, still trying to decide if he's going to call her. \"Hey, buddy, are you going to just stand there? I gotta make a call too,\" someone says next to him. Jason turns to him. \"Give me a minute. This is harder than it looks,\" he says between his teeth. \"It ain't that hard. Ya put in the money, press the buttons, and pick up the phone,\" the civilian says. \"That's not what I meant,\" Jason says turning away. He decides to call. 'You only live twice, right?' He asks himself. He puts the phone to his ear and waits. The waiting line stops. \"..Hello?\" Jason breathes again after holding it, Lucy picked up. \"Lucy-\" \"Oh, it's you,\" she says, recognizing him. \"Wait! Don't hang up,\" Jason says quickly. Lucy pauses, considering it, \"..Give me one good reason.\" Jason takes a steadying breath. \"I will prove to you that I'm not lying. Meet me at our place in an hour.\" There's silence. \"Please Lucy. I miss you.\" \"..I'll think about it.\" Then she hangs up. Jason puts the phone back. The guy waiting is still there. \"You got girl trouble?\" He asks. \"None of your business. You can use the phone now,\" Jason says, walking away. Okay, the scene I didn't put in here isn't here for a few reasons. 1. I have written it down earlier. 2. BUT! ..I haven't a clue where it is.. 3. I didn't want to make you wait until I found it, so I posted this chapter while I look. Prayers requested for the search. I checked my folder for the story, I checked my Google account, etc. I don't know where that scene is! *sigh* Like I said above, prayers needed. ~CtW[Chapter 31] It's been a couple days, I know. Here's the reunion a guest reviewer spoke about. But it's unclear if it is what they meant. 3rd POV Jason peeks through the underbrush. It's been five minutes after the time he told Lucy to meet him. The cottage in the middle of the clearing hasn't had any movement since he arrived. 'Did she come at all?' Jason wonders. He sits there a little longer, looking over the place he hasn't been to for over three years. It looks well kept, showing Lucy came often enough to care. The windows have fresh flowers in their sill boxes. The door is closed and the lights are off. Jason takes a deep breath and steps into view. He walks over to the door. He has the urge to knock. It doesn't feel like his place anymore. He's been gone too long. 'I don't feel like the same person.' But eventually, he opens the door and walks in. The blue rose is still there, bright as ever. The water it sits in is browned, but it didn't affect the rose itself. Jason walks into the living room. It is cleaner, free of any papers and books like when he and Lucy would stay there to study. 'Where is Lucy?' Jason has yet to see her. He sees the bathroom is open, so he climbs the stairs to the second level. Those rooms are also empty. He sighs. 'I guess she didn't-' He stops his train of thought and turns to the window of the bedroom he's in. He moves the curtain out of the way. Lucy is in the backyard. She's facing away from the house, kneeling next to a gray stone that curves at the top. She has on a red tank top blouse and brown capris. Jason smiles and races down the stairs and to the sliding glass back door. He can't believe he didn't check there before. He quietly opens it and steps down the stairs. Lucy hasn't moved since he last saw her at the window. Jason takes a step closer. \"I'm sorry..\" He freezes in his spot at her words. \"..I'm sorry I thought you were alive Jason,\" she continues, \"that was selfish of me. That was just a dumb prank from someone with no heart.\" Jason reaches out, ready to call her name. \"Or maybe it was all my imagination,\" Lucy says, \"No one was around when I got the call..\" She bows her head more, her chin close to her chest. Jason sees the top of the gray stone. Jason Todd 'She put a stone here too?' \"I should just let you rest in peace,\" she sobs, \"you deserve that, after everything you've gone through.\" Jason can't bear to hear her like this. \"..Lucy.\" Lucy doesn't move, as if she didn't even hear him. \"Lucy,\" he says louder, taking a step. \"Go away..\" Lucy says, as if he's only in her mind. Jason crumples his brow and takes purposeful steps until he's standing right behind her. \"Lucy, look at me,\" he says gently as he crouches behind her. \"No, you aren't there,\" Lucy says, her eyes closed shut, \"you're dead.\" Jason takes her arm and turns her around. She stares at him. \"I'm not ,\" he says clearly. Lucy feels his hand on her arm. She sees the piercing green in his eyes, full of life. The breath from his mouth brushes her skin, a whisper. She has no tear streaks, because she ran out of tears to shed. But her eyes brim with a new kind of tear. One that is torn between hope and disbelief. \"J..\" She moves her hand slowly, so he isn't blown away by the movement. She touches his cheek, which is cold from the weather. He smiles and leans into it. His free hand covers hers. \"Gh-\" \"No ghost,\" he assures, \"I'm really here, Lucy. I told you I'd come back, no matter how long it took.\" \"He died,\" Lucy states, \"we buried him.\" \"You didn't bury me,\" Jason says, \"I don't know who that was, but I never returned with Bruce.\" Lucy, in her confusion, overlooked how Jason said his former mentor's name with venom. A few tears fall down her cheeks, sending warm sensations through her body. \"..Jason..\" She says, her lips trembling. He loosens his grip on her arm and she places her other hand on his other cheek, framing his face. Lucy's arms slip over his shoulders. He holds her up with his hands on her back. Lucy holds as tight as she can, refusing to let go. \"I'm alright, Lucy..\" Jason whispers at her ear, \"I'm here.\" \"Don't you ever leave me again,\" Lucy says sternly through her new waves of tears, \"promise me, Jason. Don't ever leave me like that again!\" Jason nods into her shoulder, \"I promise. Never again.\" Lucy still refuses to let go, so Jason picks her up and carries her to the house like a little girl. He sits on the couch and Lucy curls up on his lap. She rolls over so her head is on the armrest and she can look up at him. She stares at him, her hand tracing his jaw. It traces up to his ear, then fingers through his black hair. She frowns curiously and brushes her thumb over the white bangs. \"What's this from?\" Lucy asks. \"..You like it?\" Jason asks. Lucy inspects the change in his appearance a little longer, moving it from one side of his forehead to the other. Then she nods, \"It suits you.\" They fall into silence. Jason keeps a firm grip on her hand. Lucy keeps her gaze on his face. She sits up and holds him in an embrace again. \"I am really here, Lucy,\" he says, chuckling. \"Then why does it feel like you have to go?\" Lucy asks him. Jason looks over her shoulder at the darkening sky. She's right. He can't stay here with her forever. He has too much work to do. \"Lucy,\" he draws away from her, holding her shoulders gently, \"I'm not going away forever. But I have something I have to finish, okay?\" \"What is it?\" Lucy asks. Jason goes quiet. \"What? You can't tell me?\" \"I don't want you to get mixed up in this, Lucy,\" he says softly, brushing his hand on her cheek, \"You need to trust me.\" \"..Can Bruce help?\" Jason closes his eyes at the name, keeping his thoughts centered. \"Bruce has bigger problems right now. I can handle this.\" Lucy sighs and looks at her lap, \"Be careful, Jason. I still love you.\" Jason looks at Lucy's worried glance. He tilts her chin to look at him. \"I love you, too, Lucy,\" he says straight into her blue eyes. He leans over and she closes her eyes. Lucy places her hands on either side of his head, holding him close. Jason's arms go over her shoulders and support her at the small of her back. Lucy is the one to finally pull away from the kiss, but only enough so their lips are only a hair's width from touching. \"Remember your promise,\" Lucy says. Jason feels her breath on his face, sweetness lingering from her lipstick. His white bangs brush against her forehead, tickling along her eyelashes. She looks through them at him. Jason smirks. \"Do I ever break them?\" Predictions of the future? Anyone? (I will not say if they are true or not.)[Chapter 32] Sorry it took so long.. again. I do not own this movie, DC, or any characters associated. But Lucy Blake is my OC. 3rd POV Alfred watches Bruce as he aims the bulldozer, holding a lantern for light. Grass had grown over, and without the stone, no one would know what was beneath the surface. The cemetery is quiet, except the low rumble of the machine. After enough dirt is cleared away, Bruce jumps down and moves what remains away from the wooden box. \"Do you need more light sir?\" Alfred asks. \"No, I can see fine.\" He holds his hand out behind him. Alfred steps forward and hands him a crowbar. Bruce forces it between the cover and the body of the box. The top comes off. Underneath, there is a boy with black hair and an expensive suit. He looks at peace with his arms across his chest. \"Well.. there you have it. He's still at rest,\" Alfred states, lowering the lantern. Bruce frowns deeper. \"No, he isn't.\" He reaches down and pulls the form up. It's limp in his hand and the hair, now shown to be a wig, falls off the dummy. \"That's not flesh.\" He looks back at Alfred, who is holding a hand over his mouth in shock. Bruce drops the 'body' and leaves it on the dirt. They arrive back at the manor. Bruce goes to change out of his dirt covered civilian clothes and into a Bat Suit. Alfred walks away from the batcave after trying to talk Bruce out of blaming himself. Then he cleans himself up and goes about his duties in the manor. But he's less at ease than he wishes to be. The door opens and Alfred has to stop for a moment to tell himself that it is not Master Jason. He walks down the stairs to greet the arrival, finding Lucy taking off her coat. \"Miss Lucy,\" he says in greeting. Lucy looks over at him, \"Hello Alfred.\" \"How long have you been gone?\" Alfred asks, for he doesn't recall seeing her leave. \"I.. a few hours,\" Lucy states. \"A late night class, is it?\" Alfred asks, \"seems odd for your schedule to change.\" \"..No class,\" Lucy says, \"I just went to the park. A..\" She looks at Alfred. Jason's face is in her mind. 'Should I tell him?' She thinks. After a few seconds, she decides her answer, \"A friend was there.\" \"Ah, I see,\" Alfred states. Lucy smiles, 'Jason's getting help from Bruce, so Alfred already knows,' she thinks with certainty. Lucy walks over to the kitchen for a small snack. Alfred stays nearby in the dining room. He finds random objects to polish, to keep his mind off of things. \"Alfred?\" Lucy asks. Alfred stops and looks at her. She has a glass of milk in her hand as she stands in the doorway to the kitchen. \"Yes, Miss Lucy?\" He asks. \"..Are you okay?\" She asks, \"You seem.. tense.\" Alfred looks at the beautiful girl across the room. She knew Jason, she loved him. She probably still does. 'Would it crush her to know that the one she mourned hasn't even touched his coffin?' He wonders. Lucy waits for him to answer her. Alfred makes up his mind. \"Just the average days of butlering a caped crusader, Miss Lucy. It whittles me to my core sometimes.\" Lucy smiles, \"I haven't ever seen you this stressed though.\" Alfred takes a small sigh, \"It is one of my talents to overlook it, Miss Lucy.\" Lucy nods. \"You sure do.\" She walks away with her milk. Alfred lets out a larger breath he didn't know he was holding. 'Master Bruce is right, she would be devastated to know what Jason has become.' Batman lands the Batplane out of sight and runs swiftly to Ra's fortress. He scales the wall, keeping to the shadows. When he reaches the right open hallway, he swings over the edge and punches a guard in the cheek. Another one turns around and tries to get his gun into position to fire, but Batman reaches him first. The guard falls to the ground, unconscious. A few others find him, but they are no match for the Dark Knight. He changes course, not wanting to take on everyone on the compound before finding the person he came to talk to. So he scales the side of the walls again, reaching a balcony near the top. He sees Ra's through the glass. The man in green sets a glass of wine on the desk before him. He turns and looks around at the glass walls surrounding him. He walks over, sensing another presence. Batman takes the opportunity. He punches through the glass and grabs Ra's by the collar. Pulling him through, Batman forces him to the balcony. \"What did you do to Jason?\" Batman asks, keeping Ra's wrist pinned to his back and his hand on his head. \"Act like you don't know what I'm talking about, and I'll dislocate the shoulder,\" he warns, \"That's just to start.\" Ra's looks up at him as far as he can, \"If you hadn't disabled the roof sensors, my guards will be here in under a minute-\" \"Answer me!\" Batman demands, pulling on the arm. Ra's cries out and complies, \"I want to talk, but it would be more convenient if you could hand me the communicator in my pocket and I call off my men.\" Batman considers it for a moment, then places the communicator next to Ra's mouth. \"Commander, this is Ra's Al Ghul. Stand down. I will be entertaining a guest in my study.\" Batman lets him up and they walk into said study. Ra's pours another drink. \"You remember when we last became embattled?\" He asks. \"You were aiming to blow up banks,\" Batman answers. \"Accurate, if inelegant. I was in the midst of toppling the economy in Europe. But you were on to me. I sought a distraction, so I hired the Joker. \"When your paths crossed in Bosnia, it was to appear that you stumbled upon him.\" Batman sees the memory in front of his eyes, up to the point that Jason ran after Joker. \"He was paid extremely well for what was to be a wild goose chase,\" Ra's continues. He sighs and sets his glass down. \"Then.. he murdered the boy. That was not by design.\" Ra's doesn't look up at Batman. \"I'm afraid I overestimated my ability to control the Joker. ..Just as I underestimated his madness,\" he says, finally looking up. Batman watches him silently, the light of a fancy lamp playing on his cape. \"It grieved me, sir, to be a party to something so brutal.\" Batman finally speaks, \"You've never shied away from drawing blood.\" \"True. But always with purpose. Always with greater goals. This was simply an unnecessary casualty. As penance, I chose not to make war with you again. And, to attempt to rectify this disservice.\" \" Rectify ?\" Batman asks. \"Yes, I had hoped to return to you what you had lost. I have walked this world for nearly six centuries. As you know, I do this by bathing in the rejuvenating waters of the Lazarus Pit. Along with its healing abilities, it has long been told it is capable of an even greater feat. To raise the dead.\" Batman's face falls into a deeper frown. He knows where this is going. \"Procuring the remains of your partner was not difficult,\" Ra's says, turning around, \"You had come to Bosnia under the guise of Bruce Wayne, and you chose to depart as such. You had even concocted the story that young Jason had died in a bombing in Sarajevo. \"This made it easy for me. All it took was a few payoffs to replace his body. I felt confident you would not perform an autopsy. Even if you had, we still would have bought enough time. But my plan.. Well, Detective,\" Ra's turns to Batman, \"It had unfortunate results.\" Ra's doesn't continue. He walks over to the window and silently views the dark sky. He proceeds to tell Batman the rest of the story. \"He returned to this world, but he returned.. Damaged. ..My army searched for months, but we were never able to find a body. Or pick up a trail. I thought him dead, yet again. But I hear you've been having, trouble at home. I have returned your son to you as a blight upon your house.\" Batman turns and takes his leave. He doesn't listen to the rest of Ra's speech, or let him know he's leaving. He goes through the hall and down the edge of the fortress, as he arrived. No guards attack him. He finds the batplane and heads home. Alfred's voice comes through the radio, \"Sir, please take this to heart -Who Jason was before, how we lost him, and this dark miracle or curse that has brought about his return- It is not your fault. I know you view his death as your greatest failure, but-\" \"His life and his death are my greatest failure,\" Batman interrupts, \"Do you remember how he was when I found him?\" \"Of course sir, fearless, arrogant, brash,\" Alfred looks at a mugshot of Jason at about the time he became part of the family. \"And gifted.\" \"Yes, so different from Dick in so many ways, yet so full of potential, and power,\" Batman continues, \"But I knew from the beginning he was dangerous. If I hadn't made him to be Robin, he would have grown to do wrong. ..Then I got him killed. My partner. My soldier. My fault. I own that, I'll carry that like everything else. \"But now there's this. He's taken everything I've ever taught him and turning it on me. A hell of my own making, Alfred.\" \"Sir, this is not your doing. You loved him, he knows that. It should be enough.\" Batman stares ahead of him as he flies, \"It's not.\" A beeping comes from the Batcomputer. Alfred checks what it is. \"Reporting live from Gotham Bay-\" a reporter's voice floods into the cave. \"My word! Sir, patch into the media feed,\" Alfred says, \"Now.\" I loved putting Batman leaving before Ra's finishes in there. I don't if anyone else does, but it's rare we see it from his point of view. I have mentioned this 'NaNoWriMo' that is coming up. Well, it's in two days. *bouncing of the walls excitement* *cough* So, that means I have to put this story on hold. Yes. Again. But this time I mean to finish it! I do! I actually like this story now. But I won't get back to it until December. November is NaNo and I want to devote all my writing time to getting that done. Well, until then, please be patient. And read other works of mine if you want to read something in that patience. ~CtW[Chapter 33] Hi! *waves wildly* I know! It's been forever, right? Good news! I finally have the movie, so I can watch it segment by segment and finish this story! Here is where we left off. Hope you like it! Disclaimer: Don't own the movie, only own Lucy and any plot changes to the movie that appear in here. 3rd POV Red Hood follows the cop cars to the bridge. There, he hides in the shadows. Joker is standing on a big truck, laughing like the maniac he is. Police are helping bystanders get away from the truck, training their guns on Joker. Commissioner Gordon stands out among them with his tan coat, \"Don't know what that maniac is up to, but nobody move until I give the order.\" The spotlight of one of the GCPD blimps falls over Joker, and he bows to it. He looks down into the truck, but Red Hood can't see what's inside. Joker picks up a canister of gasoline and starts pouring it into the truck. \"I'm a little teapot,\" Joker starts singing, \"short and stout. Here is my handle, here is my spout.\" He opens the grate and tosses the rest of the canister down into the truck. \"This wasn't part of the deal, you freak!\" Red Hood hears Black Mask yelling from the truck. \"Get me out of here! Right now!\" \"I thought you'd enjoy seeing some old faces,\" Joker says into the truck as he fishes for something in his jacket. \"After all most of these guys used to work for you.\" He takes out a lighter. 'Time for an entrance,' Red Hood decides. He flips out of his hiding spot and runs the length of the bridge support, so he has the high ground. \"Who's that?\" Red Hood smirks under the helmet, 'Perfect.' \"Get a light on him!\" The light illuminating Joker trails to Red Hood, where he now stands on the top of the bridge support. Another joins it. Joker turns around and looks at him. \"Up there!\" Commissioner Gordon tells the officers assembled. Red Hood just stares down the Joker. \"Hey! Look at you. Mr. Hood!\" Joker says, standing up, \"Or do you prefer 'Red'?\" A spotlight of a third blimp goes over Joker again. \"You know, I used to wear an outfit like that. Mine was more flashy maître d' than motorcycle fetish. You kids today.\" He goes back to his lighter, which won't ignite. \"I'm sorry, could you hold on? I'm was just in the middle of setting fire to your gang.\" \"Go ahead. You really think I'd care if that scum dies?\" Red Hood says. \"Don't know. I just wanted your attention.\" \"You've always had my attention. But what I really wanted, was an audience with you.\" Joker pauses with the lighter and looks up, \"I'm sorry, that seems to imply that you organized this little clambake.\" \"I did. Sure, I had lots of plans but the endgame was getting Black Mask so desperate that he'd cut a deal,\" Red Hood explains, \"he was the only one with the connections to get into Arkham, and get you out.\" Joker looks briefly down at the truck, then says, \"So.. I've been bamboozled. Oh my.\" \"I wouldn't undersell it. It took a lot of work to bring about our reunion.\" \"Reunion? Have we met before?\" A memory passes in front of Red Hood's eyes, one he'll remember forever. \"Yes, we have.\" \"Well, here's to warm memories!\" His lighter turns on over the open truck grate and he drops it inside. Muffled, terrified screaming is heard, but is quickly overtaken by the sound of the batwings engine. It flies over the truck and lets out a blast of a fluffy substance. It instantly covers Joker, and extinguishes the fire. Red Hood's gaze follows the batwing as its pilot circles back around. A grappling hook shoots out and grabs onto Joker's coat. He yelps as he's hoisted into the air. He passes Red Hood, who jumps onto the cable and slices it with his knife. The two fall into the water below, Joker screaming the whole way. Batman watches the water, checking his scanners for any indication to where the two are. \"I got him. You want him?\" Red Hood says over the radio, \"Meet me at crime alley.\" The door opens and Joker is thrown into the room. He coughs, but starts laughing again as air filters back into his lungs. \"Okay.. so, what's the plan? Slumber party? Charades? A little truth or dare? Yes! I'll start with dare!\" Red Hood puts down the bag he was carrying and takes out a crowbar. \"..Or maybe I'll just go with truth..\" Joker decides. Red Hood walks over and beats Joker a few times with the crowbar. \"Tell me, how does that feel?\" He asks between gritted teeth. Joker rolls over. \"Oh, you know.. It only hurts when I laugh.\" He groans. \"..But hey.. I gotta know. Who are you? You said we knew one another, and you do seem really familiar. ..We double at the prom? Or maybe blow up a school bus together?\" \"No. I'm just something you helped make,\" Red Hood says, tapping the crowbar on his open palm. \"That's pretty cryptic, heh, but interesting. Tell me more,\" Joker says. \"Sure,\" Red Hood pulls Joker closer, \"listen up.\" He slams the crowbar into him again. Batman sets the batwing to hover over crime alley. He opens the hatch and leaps down. He walks forward, looking for any sign of the Red Hood. An image appears in front of him; It's the first time he met Jason. He walks over to the batmobile, only to see that the wheels are gone, the axles are supported by cinderblocks. A boy stands up on the other side, with a tool in his hand. He sees Batman and drops the tool in his hand. \"Hello.\" Batman whirls around to see Red Hood. Lightning flashes overhead, reminding Batman that it is raining. \"So glad you could make it.\" \"This ends tonight. All of it,\" Batman says. \"..Nobody knows that better than me.\" He reaches into his jacket and tosses out five ninja stars. Batman leaps into the air, avoiding them. He lands behind a dumpster and places rockets on the side. They activate and propel the dumpster towards Red Hood. Red Hood jumps forward as it goes under him. A cable wraps around his legs. Batman yanks on it and Red Hood falls to the ground. He grunts and sits up, \"Oh, you and your gadgets.\" He takes out his knife and slices the cable. He puts his taser to the cable, shocking Batman. \"You're not the only one with toys.\" He runs at Batman, who drops another gadget on the ground near him. \"Crap.\" Red Hood is blasted upwards. He lands at a wall, where his knife easily cuts into the concrete. He pushes off to across the alley, climbing a fire escape. Batman follows after him, all the way to the flat roof. Batman tackles him to the ground, but Red Hood uses his knife to pin Batman to the roof by his cape. He flips away. Batman lunges after him, only to have his jaw punched. They exchange blows, Batman's cape ripping in the corner to be free. Red Hood dives and rolls, retrieving his knife. They resume their duel, Red Hood almost stabbing Batman in the head before the knife was deflected. He drops the knife behind Batman's back, grabbing it with his other hand and slicing the yellow utility belt away from Batman's waist. The knife arcs up and cuts Batman in the neck, only it doesn't hit his skin from the protective cloth. Red Hood transfers the knife to the other hand and waits for Batman to make a move. Batman runs forward and tackles Red Hood. They both fall off the roof and land on the building over, with tall statues and spires surrounding the long rectangular space. They hit one of the statues, separating. Red Hood loses his knife, landing on his hands and knees. Batman stands up behind him and walks forward. Red Hood turns around and grabs the cowl off his head. He flips away, taking his knife back as he goes. When he stands, he's facing the unmasked Bruce. He laughs. \"Look at you.\" Bruce keeps his hands up, not letting his guard down. Red Hood looks at the cowl in his hands before tossing it back. \"I guess we should keep it even.\" He reaches up and feels for the latch in the back of his helmet. It releases and he drops it, revealing the green mask he wears beneath. Bruce recognizes the shape. \"Jason.\" Lightning flashes again, making his face look like it did the last time Bruce saw him. \"Yes.\" \"I don't want to fight you.\" \"All evidence to the contrary.\" \"Please, I can help you. I know what happened.\" \"Oh, you got to talking with Ra's, huh?\" Jason asks, \"Does it make it easier for you to think that my dip in his fountain of youth turned me rabid?\" Jason looks down, \"Or is this just the real me?\" He kicks the helmet away, toward Bruce. \"Lucy would disagree with you,\" Bruce says, trying to appeal to the Jason he knows must be in there. And that Jason loves Lucy with everything. He stops the helmet with his foot and looks up just in time to see Jason glaring at him. He holds up a detonator. Bruce realizes the helmet has a bomb in it. He leaps away as it goes off. He puts his mask back on as Jason leaps at him. \"Don't use her against me!\" A statue falls over as they duck and counter. \"If you were thinking of her-\" Bruce catches a fist, \"then you wouldn't be doing this.\" Jason gets his knife at Bruce's throat. \"Tell me, what bothers you more? That your greatest failure has returned from the grave? Or that I've become a better batman than you?\" Bruce flips him over and they battle to push the knife towards the other. \"You're ruling through intimidation and murder. You're just another criminal.\" \"I'm what this city needs!\" \"Is this what Lucy needs?\" Bruce asks. Jason's eyes darken. The knife turns down and embeds into the stone between them. Jason wraps a cord around Bruce's neck and fires it at a statue. Bruce hits his back on the stone and yelps. Just as he gets the cord out from around him, Jason appears, socking him in the jaw. He falls on his back, Jason over him. He's punched again and again. He catches Jason's fist, using his other to return a punch. Now Jason's on his back. Bruce digs in his glove and pulls out something while restraining Jason. \"Hidden goodies all over, huh? We're both just a couple of walking armories.\" \"Maybe so, but let's see how well you do without your toys.\" Bruce ignites the flare and drops it onto Jason's jacket. Jason punches Bruce in the jaw. Bruce grabs the edge of the ledge, watching the inflamed jacket falling below him. Jason stands at the statue. He takes the grapple hook and throws it. He doesn't wait for it to catch and jumps after. Bruce grabs onto his leg. Jason kicks him into a building. He runs down the length of the building, Bruce after him after recovering. Jason turns a corner and leaps across an alley. He plunges feet first into a window. Bruce sees his path and follows. I didn't want this to get too long, so I stopped it right here. It will pick up in the next chapter. Well, how many people are still reading? R&R;! (Red Hood and.. um.. hang on, I'll think of a second one...) I'll try to get the next one up soon. Maybe tomorrow. For all those waiting patiently for me to get back to this, thanks bunches! I've had a rollercoaster experience throughout writing this. But the fact that it is almost done shows how much my readers have an impact on me. Thank yoU! CtW[Chapter 34] Here's the next part of that fight scene. And yes, Bruce is trying to get through to Jason using Lucy. The only part of Jason that isn't tied to being Robin is Lucy. Plus, love is stronger than hatred, right? 3rd POV Bruce kicks Jason into the bathtub behind him, smashing a half-circle hole in the side. \"Enough, it's over!\" Bruce yells. Jason gets back up and tries to punch Bruce, but Bruce grabs his arm and shoves Jason into the tiled wall, breaking several pieces. Jason is then pulled to the other side, where his face gets most of the impact. He grabs one of the broken shards before it falls and tries to cut Bruce with it. Bruce evades the make shift knife. Jason tries a punch again, but Bruce clocks him in the nose. Jason rolls with it, flipping back to give himself space. He throws a punch with more force. Bruce steps to his right and Jason's hand hits the wall. Bruce kicks him in the stomach. He throws Jason away from the wall. Jason's chin and jaw hits the sink, breaking it in half from the force, then he hits the toilet seat, cracking it. Bruce stalks over as Jason gets up. He blocks as his former mentor attacks with a hand on either side of his head, but it does no good. Bruce grabs Jason's head and slams it onto his knee as he brings it up. He head butts Jason, then pulls him close. Jason's back slams into the wall. \"You say you want to be better than me. It's won't happen.\" Bruce pulls back a fist, \"Not like this!\" The force of his hand on Jason's chest sends Jason through the wall into the next room. Jason hits the wall and falls to the floor. \"I know I failed you. I tried to save you, Jason.\" Jason stays on the floor. \"I'm.. I'm trying to save you know. Not just for me, but for her.\" Jason glares at the floor and reaches back to his belt. He takes out one of his guns and points it at Bruce. \"Is that what you think this is about? That you let me die? \"I don't know what clouds your judgement worse,\" Jason says as he stands up, \"your guilt or your antiquated sense of morality.\" Bruce doesn't react. \"Bruce, I forgive you for not saving me. But why.. why on God's earth-\" Jason kicks the closet door, breaking it into pieces and revealing the Joker to be behind it, \"-is he still alive!\" Joker looks at each of the combatants and starts chuckling like crazy. \"Gotta give the boy points!\" He says, scooting the chair he's tied to into the open. \"He came all the way back from the dead to make this shindig happen!\" Joker looks back at Jason, \"So, who's got a camera?\" Jason and Bruce glare at each other as Joker starts rambling about what pictures to take first. \"Then one with the crowbar, then-\" Jason kicks the chair over and points the gun at Joker's temple. \"You'll be as quiet as possible, or I'll put one in your lap first,\" Jason says. \"Party pooper, no cake for you,\" Joker whines, but does as he's told. Jason stands back up, \"Ignoring what he's done in the past. Blindly, stupidly disregarding the entire graveyards he's filled.. The thousands who have suffered.. The friends he's crippled.\" Bruce's eyes narrow at the mention of Barbara. \"You know, I thought..\" Jason looks down slightly, \"I thought I'd be the last person you'd ever let him hurt.\" The gun drops slightly, \"If it had been you that he beat to a bloody pulp, if he had taken you from this world, I would've done nothing-\" Jason looks back up at attention, the barrel pointed at Bruce's chest, \"-but search the planet for this pathetic pile of evil death worshiping garbage.. and sent him off to Hell!\" \"You don't understand. I don't think you've ever understood,\" Bruce says. \"What? What, your moral code just won't allow for that? It's too hard to cross that line?\" \"No! ..No, it would be too easy.\" Bruce looks at Joker in the corner of his vision, \"All I've ever wanted to do is kill him. A day doesn't go by I don't think about subjecting him to every horrendous torture he's dealt out to others and then.. end him.\" \"Aww.. you do think about me,\" Joker says from the floor. \"But if I do that.. If I allow myself to go down into that place..\" Bruce looks back at Jason, \"I'll never come back.\" \"..Why?\" Jason asks, \"I'm not talking about killing Penguin, or Scarecrow, or Dent. I'm talking about him!\" Jason points the gun at Joker, \"Just him! And doing it because..\" He looks up at Bruce, \"Because he took me away from you.\" \"Not just from me,\" Bruce says quietly. Jason goes back to glaring. \"I can't. I'm sorry.\" \"That is so sweet,\" Joker mocks. Jason reaches back for his other gun. \"Well, you won't have a choice.\" Bruce loosely catches the gun as it hits his chest. Bruce looks at the gun, then looks back at Jason, \"I won't-\" \"This is what it's all been about. This. You, me, and him. Now is the time you decide!\" Jason kicks Joker's chair and pulls him to stand in front of him. \"If you won't kill this psychotic piece of filth, I will!\" He points the gun at Joker's forehead. \"If you want to stop me, you're going to have to kill me!\" \"You know I won't-\" \"I'll blow his deranged brains out!\" Jason threatens, \"And if you wanna stop it, you are going to have to shoot me! Right in my face!\" \"This is turning out even better than I'd hoped,\" Joker states. \"..What would she think of this, right now?\" Bruce asks. He doesn't use her name because of the criminal between them, but Jason has two people that come across his thoughts. He doesn't say anything, but glares at Bruce even harder. 'How dare he continue to use Lucy against me! I'm protecting her! As long as Joker is alive, she's in danger of whatever chaotic scheme he has planned next!' Bruce drops the gun and turns around. Jason's glare drops to surprise. \"It's him or me, you have to decide!\" Jason warns, but there's a slight tremor in his hand. Bruce doesn't turn around. \"Decide now, do it!\" Jason points the gun at Bruce this time. \"Him or me? Decide!\" Bruce slides a batarang into his palm as he hears Jason pull the trigger. Bruce ducks away from the bullet and throws the batarang. It lodges itself into the gun's barrel and explodes. Jason cries out holding his hand. Joker starts cackling where he was dropped on the floor, \"I can't believe you got him! You expert, rooting-tooting, eagle-eyed, goth-loving marksman. I love it. You managed to find a way to win-\" Jason stands up and Bruce sees him take something out of his belt. \"-And everyone still loses!\" Joker finishes. He cackles as Jason holds up a detonator with his uninjured hand as his bloodied one holds his side. The bomb in the fireplace starts counting down. Bruce starts towards it, but Joker pushes him to the floor. \"No! Don't spoil it! This is better!\" Joker holds his hands at Bruce's throat, close to choking him. \"I'm the only one that's going to get what he wants tonight!\" Joker yells. \"Yes! Bing, bang, boom! We all go out together!\" Jason sits down at the wall, clutching his side and glaring at Bruce. 'Lucy..' Jason heard her name and he felt a small.. hesitance, in his resolve. Bruce grabs Jason as the counter is at three and pulls him into a different room. The building shakes at the explosion, smoke filling the room they were in and rubble settles in piles around them. Bruce stands up and looks around. Joker is pinned under pieces of a wall, weakly cackling to himself. But no matter where he looked, he couldn't find Jason. Guess what? This is not the end of Red Hood has a Heart ! But it is the end of everything you'll find in the movie. Why am I doing that? Because there is another character that needs an end scene. There are two chapters left. TWO! And the last one is an epilogue! R&R;! ~CtW[Chapter 35] Yes, I know what this chapter is called. ..Please don't murder me in a future story. ...Here's a tissue box. 3rd POV The batmobile comes to a stop. Lucy turns around to see Bruce carefully climbing out. \"Alfred! He needs medical attention,\" she says, walking over. She supports Bruce as much as she can. They walk to the infirmary. \"What are you doing here, Lucy?\" Bruce asks, even though he saw her at Jason's memorial case. 'I have to tell her.' \"I..\" Lucy looks away from him, \"I have to tell you something.\" Bruce looks at her in surprise. \"But, let's get you to Alfred first.\" On cue, the butler comes out of the infirmary and takes up Bruce's other side. The crusader grunts, but that's it. He's sat down on the bed and Alfred helps him out of the top half of his ripped costume. He has marks along his torso and arms that hint at a blast, a few tiny pieces of debri stuck in his skin. Alfred starts at his work, while Bruce looks at Lucy. \"What did you want to tell me?\" He asks. Lucy walks over and sits on a chair near the wall. \"I.. I saw, Jason,\" she says. \"What?\" Bruce asks. He grunts afterwards as Alfred puts anti-bacterial on a wound. \"Jason called me, twice,\" Lucy says, \"and we met up at our old spot. He's..\" Lucy's eyes well up with tears, \"Jason's alive, Bruce.. He's alive and he's out there.\" Bruce sees the slightest smile and knows that she doesn't want to hear what he has to say next. \"Lucy.. he's not.\" \"What? No, I saw him. I hugged him. He's alive.\" \"Lucy,\" Bruce gets down from the table and steps over to her. He kneels down to look up into her eyes. \"You may have seen Jason, but it doesn't mean he's there.\" \"What do you mean?\" Lucy asks. Bruce looks back at Alfred, who cleared his throat, \"I believe it is time, to tell her.\" \"Tell me what?\" \"Do you know what I was doing tonight?\" Bruce asks. \"Alfred told me you were fighting with the Red Hood.\" Bruce looks at her, a pain in his eyes. Lucy's eyes water. \"That's.. That's him?\" \"..Yes.\" \"He's Red Hood. He.. he did that to..\" Lucy looks at the bandages around Bruce's chest and arms. She puts a hand to her mouth, tears falling down her cheeks. \"I don't believe it.\" \"Believe it, Lucy,\" Bruce says, \"Jason isn't the man we knew when he was taken from us.\" Lucy shakes her head, \"What are you going to do?\" \"I.. I don't know if he's still out there. He wasn't there after the blast,\" Bruce says, standing up. Lucy stands up. She takes two steps and wraps her arms around Bruce. He grunts a little, but wraps one arm around her as well. \"I'm sorry Lucy. I wish this was different too.\" Jason stumbles into the place he had been sleeping in. It was hardly a home, but it got the job done. He holds his hand, using a pressure point to stave off the bleeding. Finding a first aid kit, he sits on the bed and goes over his injuries, starting with his hand. 'Alfred was good at this,' Jason thinks. He's thought that a lot, but now more than ever. Alfred would be making remarks as he patched him up, maybe a slight tap on the head for some stupid injuries the butler knew he could have avoided if he was careful. Jason sighs. It didn't work. Joker was still laughing in the end. And Bruce, Batman, had thwarted it. 'I guess I have to go after him before finding Joker,' Jason decides, \"If he won't kill him, I'll do both myself.\" He feels a tremor in his hand, remembering when he had the gun to Joker's head and he couldn't pull the trigger. He reaches over to the small table next to the bed and picks up the handgun. He had picked it up after the blast. He tests his hand, flexing it. Then he aims the gun at the wall, staring down the barrel with one eye. 'It won't happen again.' He stands up and gathers all his extra equipment. He has a spare handgun under his pillow, as well as the second knife of the set he acquired. His old leather jacket, one that doesn't have any renforcement, hangs on the headboard of the bed. His mask is still in place, but he lost the red helmet earlier. Outside, under a makeshift garage roof, his motorcycle waits. He rolls it out, starts the engine, and takes off down the road. He ignores the pain in his injuries, ignores the crisp bite the wind makes on his face -and most importantly- He ignores the feeling in his gut that makes up for his lack of conscience. Bruce sits down at the bat computer, looking off into space. Lucy is standing at Jason's costume, trying to come to terms with this new development. Suddenly, a light flashes on the computer console. Lucy sees him press a few buttons, \"What's wrong?\" \"There's an intruder at the entrance to the cave,\" Bruce says. He pulls up some security footage. \"Lucy, go to the trophy room,\" he orders. \"Why?\" \"Go,\" he says a little louder. Lucy takes off. Alfred is told to go with her. \"Master Bruce-\" Bruce looks at him. \"..I would advise you to remember who he once was, but you aren't going to listen to me, are you?\" \"..Just keep Lucy safe.\" Alfred sighs, nods, and then goes after Lucy to do just that. Bruce turns to the cave entrance, seeing the light get bigger as the cycle barrels towards him. After the cycle passes the batmobile, it turns ninety degrees. Jason shoots. Bruce rolls, the bullet hitting the computer. Bruce still has a few batarangs on him, so he tosses one at Jason. Jason ducks, then gets off the motorcycle. \"Miss me?\" Jason asks. \"Jason-\" \"Did you think I died again? Were you happy!\" Jason yells, shooting a few more bullets. Bruce avoids them, taking shelter behind a pillar of rock. \"Or are you never happy?\" \"Jason stop!\" Bruce says. \"Why don't you come out from behind there like a coward.\" \"How about you put away the gun first,\" Bruce says. Jason points the gun at the pillar, waiting for Bruce to move. But he sighs and sets the gun into its holster. \"There.\" Bruce steps out, seeing Jason keeps a hand on the handle. They each size each other up. Bruce sees Jason's attempt at tending to his wounds, while the latter sees him with white bandages and a lack of armor on his chest. \"So, Alfred's still around?\" Jason asks. \"He misses you,\" Bruce says. \"I'll make sure to say hello when I'm done here.\" Jason runs forward. They wrestle, both receiving a few more bruises before Bruce pushes them apart. Jason reaches behind his holster and takes out one of the things that he picked up at his apartment. He throws it at Bruce's feet. The grenade-like object hits the ground and opens, spreading a jelly like substance over the caped crusaders feet. It solidifies quickly. Bruce starts to bend down to free himself, but he hears a click. \"I wouldn't do that if I were you.\" Bruce looks up to see Jason looking at him down the barrel of the gun. \"Jason stop!\" Bruce turns and looks at Lucy as she starts walking toward them. Alfred is in the doorway, an expression on his face that says he tried his best, to no avail. \"Lucy go back to Alfred,\" Bruce says. Lucy doesn't listen to Bruce. \"Jason..?\" she asks tentatively. \"He can't do what is needed, so he doesn't deserve it,\" Jason states to himself. Lucy looks at Bruce. \"Look at me,\" she says. Jason's finger quivers on the trigger. \"Look at me, Jason.\" Jason turns his face to see her, keeping Bruce in his peripheral. Lucy has confusion and fear on her face. \"Don't get involved, Lucy,\" Jason says, whispering only for her. She huffs, crossing her arms, \"I've been involved since I started tutoring you. Jason,\" she takes a careful step forward, dropping her arms, \"put.. put the gun down.\" Jason looks back at Bruce, tightening the grip on the gun. \"You set her up to this! Didn't you Bruce!\" \"I'm not against you, Jason-\" Jason doesn't hear her, \"You don't want me to soil your legacy, do you! So you drag my girlfriend into it-!\" Lucy runs over to him and grabs his free hand, \"Jason..\" Jason looks at her, anger filling his expression. Lucy swallows and says, \"You're scaring me..\" She sees a little anger fade. \"I.. miss you. I want you to come home. Please.. Come back. The boy I fell in love with is who you are, not this.\" Jason's face falls and he averts his eyes to the floor. \"Lucy.. this is who I am. Accept it.\" Jason looks back up, not quite looking in her eyes, \"I have.\" Jason pushes her away, out from before him. He holds the gun up again. Bruce still couldn't get his feet out of the cement and his chest is exposed. \"Jason, listen to me!\" \"No! I'm done, listening! He has to pay for his crimes! Then the Joker will pay for his. If he's still out there.. He could still hurt you. I will never let that monster hurt anyone again.\" Jason aims at the center of Bruce's chest. Lucy goes back to his side, \"Jason, think about what-!\" Bang! Jason's eyes widen. He stares into Lucy's eyes. Right in front of him.. Holding his hand.. A hole in her chest. Lucy coughs and a little blood falls down her chin. Jason stares, everything stopping around him. Then it all happens fast. Lucy starts to fall. Jason drops the gun and catches her. He falls to his knees, cradling her close. \"Lucy?\" He asks. She's still looking at him. \"Wh.. Why did you do that? Lucy..\" Bruce gets the cement off his feet and he runs over. \"Alfred!\" \"Right away sir.\" Bruce comes to kneel near the pair, but something tells him that Jason won't let him too close. \"I'm scared.. Jason,\" Lucy says, her voice quivering due to the pain. \"You're going to be alright, Lucy. I've seen far worse, trust me,\" Jason rambles, trying to keep Lucy from closing her eyes, \"Just keep looking at me. Keep looking at me and you'll be okay.\" Jason looks up, tears on his face. He sees Bruce watching, like an animal trainer trying to catch a wild beast. \"Help her!\" Jason yells. Bruce moves closer and checks her pulse. Lucy is looking at everything frantically, her breathing elevating. Her front is now a deep scarlet. \"ALFRED!\" Jason yells. \"Jason, he's coming. We need to set her on the ground,\" Bruce says. Jason listens, easing Lucy to the floor. Alfred arrives with various medical materials. \"I love you..\" Lucy lifts a hand to Jason's cheek, \"Jason..\" she says weakly. Jason nods and holds his hand over hers, \"I love you too. Forever, remember? I'm here. Now you don't leave, alright?\" Lucy nods faintly, but her eyes start to close. \"No no, Lucy,\" Jason says. Her head falls to the side and her arm goes limp. He starts shaking her shoulder, shouting her name. \"She's in cardiac arrest,\" Bruce states. Jason immediately gets into position and starts CPR. Alfred preps the AED he brought over. He places the pads on her skin and the device tells them to clear. Jason stops and they wait. \"No pulse detected,\" the machine says. Jason starts again. \"One, two, three, four-\" \"Jason.\" \"-five, six, seven, eight, nine-\" \"Jason!\" Jason looks up. Bruce shakes his head. \"There's no pulse. There's nothing to revive.\" Jason shakes his head and keeps counting. \"Lucy, wake up,\" he says as he continues CPR, \"you won't like it there, Lucy, you won't like it there.\" \"Jason..\" Bruce says. \"Try again,\" Jason sobs. \"Jason!\" Jason suddenly stops and falls back onto his butt. Lucy's head is lolled to the side, so he can't see her face. \"I'm sorry..\" Bruce says, as the father watching his son grieve. Tears fall more freely down his face and he's shaking, \"The bullet was meant for him , Lucy.\" Jason slams his fist on the ground. \"For him!\" Jason would feel the added pain of his injured hand later, but now he feels nothing. Nothing can compare the feeling in his chest. Alfred takes off the pads and puts away the kit, with his own share of tears. Jason then crawls back over and cradles Lucy in his arms. \"You saw light in me, you knew I could do better,\" he whispers, his voice broken, \"and.. I don't know if I can fulfill that.\" Bruce sees the boy that he lost years ago, just a child in the world that lost something that can never be replaced. He sets a hand on Jason's shoulder. And like all the other pain, he doesn't feel it. \"I'm.. I'm so sorry Lucy,\" Jason says, \"Please forgive me..\" She doesn't answer. She's gone. I cried while writing this. I'm not a heartless monster. IF YOU DID NOT CRY OR FEEL LIKE CRYING OR FEEL LIKE YOUR HEART AND FEELS WERE TORN APART YOU DO NOT HAVE ONE! And yes, I was planning to do this since the beginning of the story. This story is almost done. Just the epilogue to go. And yes, save that tissue box. There is more crying. Now if you will excuse me. *goes to cry in the corner* ~CtW[Chapter 36] Epilogue is from Jason's eyes because that is better than anything else. I don't own DC and yes, I killed of my OC. (if that is a surprise to you, you skipped a chapter.) Jason's POV I walk down the rows of tombstones, looking for hers. I personally requested to pick it out. I'm wearing my Red Hood outfit, going as I am. Someone catching me before I get there is a chance I'll take. I find her. I stare at the two by five and a half area that is still brown from recent burial. She is buried under the black soil, resting. Like I was. 'Lucy. This can't be where you are. It's too dim, dark, full of death. How was someone so pure born into a city so cruel?' I'm on my knees now. She is somewhere six feet below me. I stare at the bouquet of white flowers in my hand. They are a big contrast to the other flowers gathered around here. They are lilies. These are roses, her favorite. I set them down, leaning against the stone. I remove my green mask and it drops to my side. The wind picks up a bit and I see the fluff of white in my bangs. It reminds me of how different I am from who she knew me as. I can barely tell myself the reality. 'She's... I didn't mean to. I... I...' My mind pulls the memory back. Back in the cave with Bruce, with Lucy. \" I wouldn't do that if I were you.\" \" Jason stop!\" I don't look at her. I feel the weight in my hand increase just from her voice. I have to do this. I have to. It's the only way. I come back to reality. I dig my hands into the moist soil, wishing she's right on the surface and I could pull her up. I'd kiss her, hoping there was still some Lazarus Pit water on my lips, even after three years. My hands turn to fists buried in the dirt. I can't take it. \"WHY! Of all people why HER!\" I scream at the sky at the top of my lungs. Now I'm the force making puddles on the ground. I sob right above where she would be. I can still see her. Laughing. Smiling. Caring. 'You don't deserve this Lucy. I didn't deserve you. Your so kind-' I'm pointing my gun. Bruce throws his batarang. I have to duck so it wouldn't damage my only way of killing him. It slightly grazes my arm. I point my barrel back at him. He's out of options. \" Look at me. … Look at me, Jason.\" \" Don't get involved, Lucy.\" \" Put.. put the gun down.\" \" You set her up to this! Didn't you Bruce! … You don't want me to soil your legacy, do you! So you drag my girlfriend into it-!\" She runs in front of me and takes my hand. \" Jason.. You're scaring me.. I.. miss you. I want you to come home. Please.. Come back. The boy I fell in love with is who you are, not this.\" Those words were full of such tenderness, concern, and hope. \" Lucy.. this is who I am. Accept it-\" And I will regret those words for the rest of my life. \" -I have.\" I push her out of the way and aim my gun at Bruce for the last time. I shake my head to clear it. I don't want to think about it. I look at the tombstone. 'Please Lucy, please come back. I kept my promise. Now you have to do the same.' I stare at the dirt expecting the impossible. 'I did it. See? It's easy. Nothing to it. But you have to start it yourself. You have to want to. Please come back. You can't leave me...' I know she can't hear my thoughts. But like with my mom, I wait for an answer. \"Jason,\" someone says behind me. That isn't her voice. But I still recognize it. \"Jason look at me. Acknowledge your older brother.\" I do neither. \"Jason, you're not alone in the world,\" Grayson says. \"Go away,\" I state, annoyed already. But he sits down anyway. \"I'm a monster,\" I admit. \"No you aren't.\" \"Yes I am. You weren't there when it happened.\" I shudder. \"You didn't see her fall or her-\" \" Jason, listen to me!\" \" No! I'm done, listening! He has to pay for his crimes! Then the Joker will pay for his. If he's still out there.. He could still hurt you. I will never let that monster hurt anyone again.\" \" Jason, think about what-!\" I pull the trigger... BANG! ...right as she runs in front of me. \"-her blood on the floor, from my bullet,\" I finish as the memory fades. I'm shaking from my condition, from my grief. Alfred had me sit down in the infirmary so he could patch my injuries, but I haven't listened to his advice on how to keep up with it. And I refused to stay at the manor. I couldn't eat, sleep, or tend to myself in any way since it happened. And I think I might be getting a cold from the rain. \"It's my fault. She's gone because of me..\" \"Well, Jason-\" he starts. \"-Now don't say it isn't because it is. I... I-\" I try to say it. The reality should be spoken. But it's stuck on my tongue. \"You can't say it can you?\" Grayson asks. I shake my lowered head, defeated. \"Well if you could, you wouldn't stop.\" I feel drops on my face again. 'Is it raining? Or am I crying again?' My brother wraps his arm around me and pulls me close. I just go with it. He can hug me. I need the comfort. \"Did you pick the stone?\" He asks me. I nod, not wanting to try to break the knot holding my throat closed. I don't have the strength. \"It's beautiful. It looks just like her.\" I nod again, squeezing my eyes shut with emotional pain. For the hundredth time, I feel my heart break. \"She always had a smile,\" I manage to say, \"..the letter is a personal touch.. Sh-she loved sending them,\" I croak. Memories of her letters to me, to my mom, even to Alfred flood back. I smile as faint as the fleeting images. \"You really loved her, didn't you?\" He asks. \"I still do,\" I reply choking on my words and tears. 'You know that Lucy? Through all that's happened, I love you. We've been parted by death twice and I still love you. I always will.' After a few minutes, Grayson let's go. \"I have to get back to Blüdhaven,\" he states as he walks away. I never looked at him once when he was here. I regret that. \"Jay?\" He's giving me a chance to, so I turn around. He looks tired, but there's love in his eyes as well. \"Yeah?\" I ask. He can see through my persona. Even with the tears I'm staying as strong as I can around anyone, even him. 'It's a little ironic. People at school called me a bad boy. I never thought I'd become one.' \"You gonna be alright?\" He asks, interrupting my thoughts. I look back at Lucy's grave. 'Am I?' I hang my head, \"I don't know.\" And that's the story! I like how I got Nightwing in there again. Jason really needs the support from his older brother (And they never interact in the movie. The helicopter scene does not count in my mind! They didn't talk, or fight, or ANYTHING! ..Anywho-) I am actually proud of myself for multiple reasons. 1. I actually finished this one. I honestly thought I wouldn't. But my readers are persistent and decided it was a little more decent than I portray it to be *shrugs* Apparently they were right. 2. I killed off a character. I struggle with this, even if it is necessary. So practice with it (sorry Lucy) is good for me. 3. I wrote a tradegy! (English 12 inside joke. Someone mis-pronounced it in class and they will never live it down.) So, that's that. Red Hood has a Heart is finished and I have one less story to think about. I won't list my past works, but if you go to my profile, they are listed. So.. tell me what you think.. :) And no flaming for Lucy's death. (should have put that on the previous chapter... Oops.) ~CtW ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I don't own anything exempt my OC, Lucy. The story is a bit of an AU to the original. J"}]
