I love This Is The End and I noticed that there aren't many stories for it. So, I wrote this! It's not much, but I noticed that you don't get to see what happens about Jay's leg so, I thought why not write about it? So I did anyway, here we go... Seth's P.O.V Well that just happened. Craig went outside to try and get into Franco's basement, becuase apparently there's some water down there. When he came back though, he hadn't managed to get into the basement. Oh, and something was chasing him. The cord around his waist allowed the 'thing' to pull him back to the door. Only when this did happen Craig, in his panic, grabbed me and Jay and pulled us back to the door with him. Jay, being the one with the clearest head out of all of us, shouted for someone to throw him a knife; so he could cut the thick wire. So Jonah, having a not so clear head, literally threw a knife to him and an unexpecting Jay was hit in the leg with the blade and he was silent for a moment before screaming in pain. Everyone was screaming, Danny was under the table, Jonah was freaking out about the knife in Jay's leg, Jay was freaking out about the knife in his leg, me and Craig were still screamng and James was trying to keep the door shut. Craig pulled the knife painfully out of Jay's limb, with a shout of protest from the limb-bearer, and cut the cord. Then James gave us the idea of going through the floor when he said how the water was right underneath us. \"Right, let's do that,\" I agree when Jay suggests we 'mine' through the stone part of the floor. There are murmurs of agreement from everyone else. \"Good idea, Jay\" Jonah says. Jay just glares at him. \"What?\" Jonah asks. \"You threw a knife at me, you motherfucker!\" Jay shouts, angrily. \"I didn't mean to hit you!\" Jonah retorts. Jay goes to push him but ends up falling due to the wound in his leg. He hits his head on the table and blacks out. It wasn't that long and I wish it was longer. Hope you enjoyed!

He tried to slow his breathing because he was just getting even more lightheaded then he already was. Everything was an adrenaline fueled daze. \"WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!\" James was screaming. \"JAY, YOU'RE ALIVE!\" Seth pulled Jay into a bear hug, constricting his already struggled breathing. He released him and all he heard were panicked voices, just screaming and noise . He felt a wave of heat crash over him as sweat dripped down the back of his neck. \"Guys, is it like really hot to you, or...\" He trailed off, aware of how cliche he'd sounded but not really caring. \"WHAT THE FUCK, GUYS, MY FUCKING HOUSE-\" \"James, calm down, you're freaking out Jay-\" \"WELL, I'M SORRY, JONAH, I'M FREAKING OUT A LITTLE TOO.\" \"Jay?\" He felt himself swaying on his feet and the very motion seemed to be shifting his vision of the room up and down, rocking from side to side... \"Hey, hey, hey.\" Seth said, taking him by the shoulders and sitting him down on the couch, \"Breathe, man, just breathe.\" Jay looked at him incredulously, \"What the fuck do you th-th-think I'm trying to do?! I-\" He broke off, gasping in air, unable to control it. \"What are we supposed to do?!\" Seth said, looking around at James, Jonah and Craig, \"Like, should we make him breathe in a bag or something, isn't that a thing?\" \"Yeah, I think so, but I don't have any like brown paper bags or anything, only Ziploc.\" James said. \"What?! Why the fuck don't you have any brown bags?!\" \"What?! I don't know, what the fuck do I need a brown paper bag for?!\" \"Jay,\" Jonah began softly, putting his hand on Jay's shoulder. \"Don't fucking touch me, Jonah. Get the fuck off.\" The room was spinning and dimming at an alarming speed. Jay tried to stand up, his one coherent thought was, I cannot pass out in front of these assholes , but that didn't seem to stop him. He took one step forward, and faceplanted on James Franco's new wood floor.

Want some fucking green tea while I'm out?!\"/ Or, Jonah's prayer is sort of, most definitely being granted. AU. English Humor/Friendship Rated: T Chapters:1 Words: a/n: this is kind of fucking ridiculous, in the sense i shouldn't even be writing it. au where the knife jonah threw jay did a lot more damage than in the movie. extremely colloquial stuff. anyway, expect some innocent bromance, excessive swearing, and insufferable dialogue. \"Where the fuck's my joint, I just put it down!\" \"I FUCKED YOUR MOTHER WITH IT FRANCO, NOW SHUT THE FUCK UP!\" \"I WILL FUCK YOU UP, MCRBRIDE, THIS IS MY FUCKING HOUSE, MY FUCKING RULES!\" He closes his eyes and dabs his wan, unshaven face down with a guest towel. Madmen, is what he thinks, but he'll have to communicate with these morons if he plans on actually surviving. And considering Franco and McBride are now engaged in what can only be described as a battle of witlessness, complete with enough F-bombs to blow the roof off this joint, maybe succumbing to gangrene wouldn't be such a terrible fate. ::::: \"It looks pretty fucking bad.\" The guest room he managed to snag after it became evident this trip to Franco's was strictly one-way is compact, sparsely-furnished, and beige-walled. Its utter lack of personality comforts him, reminds him of normality in this ass-backwards universe. He just wishes the windows had been entirely barricaded. Slants of volcanic light unfurl across the unpolished hardwood like bloody ribbons and he can still smell it, that smoky tang not unlike barbeque being burned on a decade-old backyard grill. God, how he loathes the fire. Almost as much as the ugly wound splitting his left thigh like a freshly cut Thanksgiving turkey. Seth had been accurate in his summary: it does, indeed, look pretty fucking bad. If he tilts his head enough, he can catch a glimpse of the pink meat, layered like ancient rock formations, and the ropey tendons and delicate capillaries, intertwined in a lover's embrace, and yeah, it's enough to make him scared. \"Jay, I am so sorry.\" Jonah's been apologizing for roughly seven years now, but Jay knows there had to be some malicious intent behind the incident. After all, what kind of idiot throws a fucking blade across the room? He could have just as easily handed it to him like a rational-minded person would. That golden earring glints in the firelight like a third eye and when it winks, yeah, Jay's certain. \"Jonah, quit fucking apologizing and get some duct tape so we can close this bitch up.\" Jay wants to inform Danny he's a fucking moron, but he's also ridiculously exhausted and whenever he looks down, more flesh is dying, and so is he, yeah, he's probably going to die at James Franco's house. \"We just need to get some supplies. I mean, we can fix this,\" Seth says and the utter positivity, the fucking certainty, in his voice, his expression, it makes his Adam's Apple swell to a size too large to swallow around. Because even if sometimes he can't stand him, Seth is still his best friend and the fact that he has faith, that he cares, makes him feel like less of a infection-wracked sad sack. Just a little. \"We need Bactine!\" \"Yeah, I'll just run out to Walgreens and grab some. Ya want some fucking green tea while I'm out?!\" Franco yells irritably with a wave of his stupid gun. He keeps swinging the goddamned thing around like he's erecting a force field around himself none of them can breech. \"James, don't yell in front of Jay! You're scaring him. He's already scared enough.\" The words \"shut the fuck up, Jonah\" die promptly on his lips. He is scared. He's incredibly scared. ::::: He sleeps for an hour or two, swept away by the currents of unconsciousness and handled roughly by their undertow. Even under the water's surface, he can still sense the fire, flaming and twisting and searing and tearing, yes, tearing the meat of his left leg. Sometimes, he hears voices; sometimes, he hears screaming; sometimes, he hears his own voice screaming, because God, nothing has ever hurt like this. But he still sleeps. Sleeping is safe. The light has faded considerably when he slams back into reality, enough that he doesn't recognize the figure perched on the edge of the bed. He struggles to speak, but every breath is another stone in his lungs, so maybe he'll just keep his fucking mouth shut for once. The anonymous silhouette leans forward; its glasses glint ominously in the pale luminosity. Seth. \"Hey, dude. You're not dead.\" Jay can hear the lilt in his tone from where he scarcely dodged adding the word \"yet\" to his last sentence. He rolls onto his back and becomes aware of the ridiculous amount of sweat he's managed to produce in the past few hours. The soaked sheets cling to his clammy flesh. Yet, his bony frame is wracked with shivers. \"Seth… the-the fuck is happening?\" \"Jonah thinks your leg's infected. You've got like a fever or something. Franco doesn't have a fucking thermometer.\" Fever. Okay. That made sense. It makes him sad, in a way, to see Seth sitting there, like he's laid up in some drafty, depressing hospice awaiting his dying breath and Seth's just trying to be upbeat about the whole damn thing, about staying by his bedside, about avoiding direct eye contact with the maroon staining the covers. \"Is it… like, bad?\" It's certainly no trip to the hockey rink. \"Yeah. Kinda.\" \"But you're not gonna die, right? I mean, we'll just wait 'till someone comes and you'll get help. No one's gonna die at James Franco's house.\" \"Seth…\" The pain is surfacing again and his thoughts are scattered. He hazily attempts to connect the fractured cognates; it feels like- - damn, what's that book? Sieve full of sand? What's a sieve? Everything is hazy and burning. \"It's bad. I-I think I'm gonna die.\" The notion had seemed entirely unreasonable until it was vocalized. It hangs suspended between them like a curtain of cigarette smoke. Because yesterday, just yesterday, he had been complaining and buying shit for Seth and that was it- - that was his life. He had been living and the mere notion of dying hadn't dared to pounce on him, because he was just a thirty-something-year-old guy who liked cats and did a couple okay movies. Death just wasn't high on the ol' priority list. Jay turns away. He doesn't want to see Seth accept their goddamn fate. Everything is shimmering and febrile and he WANTS a CIGARETTE so FUCKING bad that it's leaving an acrid taste in his mouth. He remembers that stupid book with the sieve (whatever the fuck that is). Fahrenheit 451. They read it in ninth gradeand he secretly enjoyed it, in spite of all the oddities and the sieves and the, what, what was it there was fire wasn't there hey there's fire here too god it's fucking bright it's fucking ::::: When he wakes up, his heart is thrumming so goddamn fast that he feels like he just plummeted into bed from a great height. All the guys are there, but they seem strangely distant. Once his heart stops racing, he realizes he's doped up. Considerably doped up, in fact. \"Seth- -\" \"Having recently been inspired by a very moving speech delivered by Mister Robinson, we're here to make your last hour as comfortable as possible,\" Seth interrupts in a needlessly grandiose voice. \"You'll notice you're on a lot of drugs. You're welcome.\" Blood is pumping out of his leg. He's sweating and shaking and these five guys encircling him are pretty much ninety-five percent douche bag, but they're here. They're here and he's not gonna die alone. Because even though they are douche bags and art house assholes and pretty shitty friends, he can't imagine another group of guys he'd rather die in front of. \"Here you are.\" Suddenly, there's a cigarette flickering in his field of vision and YEAH that's the good stuff. Franco is holding out the mile-long cancer stick (ha ha don't have to worry about that much longer) like a peace offering. A peace offering. Jay accepts it and they hold their gazes a moment, communicating all that shit about sorry I'm dying on your guest bed that doesn't need to be said. The cig is stale, but he doesn't care. It feels good, even better with the dope. \"This is a chicken wing I found in my pocket this morning. I bestow it unto you.\" Danny lays something bearing a vague resemblance to a chicken wing on the plane of his chest. The slightest of grins tugs at his mouth. \"Fuck you, Danny.\" \"Fuck you too.\" He's going. The room is starting to blur at the edges and his chest feels like a cage that cannot contain his frantically galloping heart and shit, he's gotta finish the cig quick. Shit. He's almost out of time. Out of time. Like he's attempting to make a long-distance call and he only had two quarters, not four like he should've been carrying, and when the operator cuts him off, there's no redial. No redial. \"Seth.\" His voice sounds like something dusty and untouched. The man he's been friends with ever since the nineties, before the glasses and the tattoos, looks him in the eye. No more of that hospice shit. They're just two friends who are probably never going to meet again, unless there's actually a Heaven and if there is, he is definitely wishing for a Backstreet Boys concert. Seconds are ticking away. Like sand through a sieve. \"Seth. Thanks.\" The cigarette is smoked down to its butt. Hey-ho, time to go. He's trembling, but he isn't scared, and when he glances up, there's the miniature sun pinned to Jonah's ear (that bastard he'll get it in the end that bastard) and the towel over Craig's shoulder and Franco's gun and Danny's neck beard and Seth's glasses, and those images are the ones that will guide him through the darkness. \"What's a sieve?\" Jay asks. He doesn't bother sticking around for an answer. a/n: I wrote most of this last year and tried to finish it and I don't even know who the fuck I am right now or what I'm doing or whatn just haopneinfged and I'm confused andw erined andn ie wneed to slekep ","Summary":" Contagion Summary: \"We need some Bactine!\" \"Yeah, I'll just run out to Walgreens and grab some.

I just recently saw \"This Is The End\" and fell in love with it and just wanted to write my own fic, I thought it would be interesting if there was a woman in the group of six men so this is what I came up with. Plus, I just love James Franco, who doesn't? Chapter 1: Introducing Blair Bennett Ah, the MTV Movie Awards. My favorite award show to be invited too. Every year, the MTV Awards always had something fun to offer including funny skits, environmental involvement awards, and a lot of performances. Sure, the Oscars were great as well, but they were always more longer and tedious, and well, boring. This year, I was nominated for three awards, due to the recent success of the family-aimed 'Oz the Great & Powerful'. I felt so honored to be nominated as 'Best Villain' for my performance as Theodora a.k.a. The Wicked Witch of the West. After Mila Kunis stepped out of the project for scheduling conflicts, my close friend James Franco suggested me for the role. At first, I was a little hesitant to accept the challenging role, mainly because I was such a huge fan of the original 'The Wizard of Oz'. I initially didn't think that I could fill in Margaret Hamilton's shoes as the legendary witch, that was a lot of pressure for me. Unfortunately for me, James eventually convinced the director Sam Raimi to meet up with me. It was a nerve wracking experience for me to be personally interviewed by none other than Sam Raimi. I was a huge fan of his work, including the 'Spider-Man' trilogy James Franco co-starred in and his 'Evil Dead' films. When I did get the chance to sit down and talk with Sam Raimi, he was a very friendly, down-to-earth man and at once, I signed myself up to be billed as Theodora. Much to my surprise, the movie was a great success and did well in the box office and possessed critical acclaim. I was stunned to find that myriads of the audience enjoyed my role as the Wicked Witch of the West. It was a risky move for my acting career and I'm really glad I broke my type-casting. I was wearing a classy, stylish, yet more laid back outfit to the 2013 MTV Movie Awards. I never bothered wearing fancy dresses or sexier-looking outfits. I mean, this wasn't the Oscars, for crying out loud. I always preferred dressing comfortably anyways. I opted for dark jeans, a flowy light pink blouse and a pair of black booties. My hair was down normal and straightened and my makeup was very minimal. On the red carpet, I did my part by standing there and looking sophisticated and professional as hundreds of cameras flashed at me from every different angle. I could hear the encouraging screams and excited whoops from the audience gathered behind the cameras. As always, I smiled gracefully and made my way down the carpet towards the venue where the show was being hosted tonight. One of the E! News reporters managed to catch up to me and pulled me aside for a typical interview. \"Blair, wow, you're dressed so... comfortably for tonight. I think you might be starting a new trend,\" the reporter said with a brilliant white smile. \"I hope so. I think it's always nice to dress more comfortably, y'know? Those tight-fitting dresses just don't do it for me. I think I've always been more of a jeans and t-shirt kind of gal and I think that everyone should learn to dress comfortably in their own skin,\" I said into the microphone that was positioned below my chin. \"Absolutely. Now, I understand that you've been nominated for three different awards tonight including 'Best Villain'. That's quite an accomplishment, how do you feel about that?\" \"I feel thrilled, ecstatic, honored... Truth be told, I'm actually kinda nervous. This was probably one of the most challenging and nerve wracking performances I've ever done in my entire career. I mean, to step into Margaret Hamilton's shoes... It's a lot of high expectations, y'know? And I know that Margaret will always be the true Wicked Witch of the West, and I never want to replace her as that. I only hope that I brought something different to the iconic character,\" I explained with a soft smile. \"Of course,\" the reporter responded. \"I've seen the movie twice already and I'm impressed by what you brought for Margaret Hamilton's character. And this is like, what, the third project you've done with James Franco so far? Tell me, what's it like being reunited with him in another project and getting to work closely?\" \"James is a handful,\" I admitted, laughing sheepishly. \"But really, he's a great likeable guy and I'm very lucky to get to work with him as much as I do. His reaction when he first saw me in my full costume as the Wicked Witch of the West was hilarious, he didn't believe it was me underneath all that heavy green makeup. Really though, getting the advantage to work with James is always a blast and I hope we get to work on more projects together in the future.\" After a few more occasional short interviews, the MTV Movie Awards finally started. I was seated in one of first front rows, A-list class actors surrounding me. One of my good friends whom I've been close with since the beginning of my acting career, Linda Cardellini sat next to me. We've been the bestest of friends since 'Freaks & Geeks', Linda was the star of the show as Lindsay Weir while I was one of the freaks starring as Sadie Lockwood. It was such a shame our show only ran for one season, due to poor TV ratings. I hope in the future, the 'Freaks & Geeks' cast and crew can reunite and maybe do like a reunion movie or something. Turns out, I won for 'Best Villain'. Shock and disbelief flashed across my face as I forced myself up, the camera crew following me as I made my way up the stage, the entire audience booming in cheers and claps. I put on a warm smile as I accepted my award from Tom Hiddleston, who previously won last year's best villain for his performance in 'The Avengers' as Loki. I kept my inner fan girl inside as Tom congratulated me and kissed my cheek. Such a charming man. I only met him once but already I admired him a lot. \"Thank you,\" I beamed at him before standing before the entire venue, the award clasped tightly in my quivering hands. I never did so well accepting awards, I always got a tad bit nervous and the adrenaline would always kick in. But I forced my old stage fright fear back as I spoke into the microphone. \"Wow...\" I said disbelieving as I looked down at the award, amazed that I actually owned this performance. \"Really wasn't expecting that. Um... Wow, this is incredible. Thank you so much, you guys. This is just amazing. Obviously, I wouldn't be standing up here if it wasn't for everyone who encouraged me to take on this challenging role. A huge thank you to James Franco, you crazy son of a bitch,\" I laughed as I spotted him in one of the front rows. The audience echoed laughter and James himself smiled one of his huge contagious smiles. \"Yes, a huge thank you to James for convincing the director Sam Raimi to meet with me, and Sam Raimi, thank you for giving me the chance to prove what I can demonstrate as an actress. Thank you to everyone who helped in participation with the film and of course to the fans who voted. You guys are the best and I couldn't ask for more. Really, thank you for letting me be up here today and have fun for the rest of the show. Goodnight, everyone,\" I finished, blowing a harmless kiss to the audience and turning towards Tom and together, we exited the stage. \"God, that was the scariest speech I've ever done,\" I laughed breathlessly. \"You were great,\" Tom assured. \"The audience went crazy over you.\" \"Not too crazy, I hope,\" I glanced at him with a smirk. The night finished off quite nicely. Unfortunately, 'Oz the Great & Powerful' didn't win for 'Movie of the Year', losing to 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire'. Good for them, I enjoyed the movie so I can understand why it was most voted for. Honestly, I was quite satisfied with walking away with 'Best Villain'. Hell yeah. Instead of going to a typical after party, I decided to go back home and relax. Now at thirty-one years old, I've been done with partying and drinking for a long time, maturing more throughout my years. Since I started young in my acting career, at the ripe age of seventeen, I succumbed to peer pressure and got into a bad phase of partying too much. Eventually, I grew up and learned to respect myself more. As soon as I got home, I stripped off my heels and poured myself a glass of fine wine, and raised my feet up on the couch, selecting some random TV comedy on TBS. While I was in the middle of my relaxation, the annoying ringtone of my phone gripped my attention. Reluctantly, I checked to see who was calling. Seth Rogen. I didn't get the chance to see him tonight, I wonder if he even showed up. \"Rogen, what's up?\" I answered tiredly. \"Blair Witch Project,\" Seth greeted enthusiastically in his deep voice. I rolled my eyes at the old nickname he gave me. In 1999, when Seth and I both started out in 'Freaks & Geeks', Seth, James, and Jason Segel and I all went to go see the premiere of 'The Blair Witch Project' which turned out to be one of the creepiest movies I've seen. Ever since then, Seth thought it be funny to call me 'Blair Witch Project' all the fuckin' time. Guess what, fourteen years later, it's not funny anymore. \"So listen, I've got a favor to ask. My bud Jay's rolling into town soon and Franco's gonna throw a housewarming party tomorrow night. Any chance you're free tomorrow and help me convince Jay to mingle into our social circle,\" Seth pleaded. \"Rogen, I don't know, man,\" I sighed, running a hand over my face. \"I have a few important errands to run tomorrow and I don't think I can just put everything to the side and come to your rescue, man, I can't.\" Truly, I loved Seth; he was one of my first friends in Hollywood and he was incredibly fun to be around. All the time, I always did favors for Seth Rogen, whether it be to participate with him in a movie or go take his dog for a walk, I'd do it. But I had a busy life too and he needed to understand that. \"Oh, what the hell?\" Seth complained. \"C'mon, Blair, really, this is important to me. I'm sure the great Blair Bennett a.k.a fuckin' Wicked Bitch of the West can afford to cancel her plans for one day and come help her bestest friend in the whole world.\" \"Bitch, you're not my bestest friend in the whole world,\" I teased. \"Says who?\" he shot back. \"Says Jimmy Fallon,\" I smirked. \"What the fuck? No. Fuck that, man. I'm your bestest friend,\" he argued. \"You're my bottom hoe,\" I corrected. \"You wish,\" he snorted. I laughed. \"Okay, okay, calm your man titties. I'll meet up with you and Jay tomorrow, haven't seen the guy since the 'How To Train Your Dragon' premiere anyways.\" \"Fuck yes, thank you, Blair. I owe you one.\" \"Yes, yes, you do,\" I agreed. \"Text me tomorrow, m'kay?\" \"Will do, Blair Witch Project,\" then he hung up. Putting my cell phone down, I sighed and mentally face-palmed myself. I just agreed to Seth Rogen to accompany him and Jay to go to Franco's millionth house-warming party. Fuck. A/N: Review if you want more ;)[Chapter 2] ATTENTION EVERYONE! I have a super-duper important announcement to make… As every one of my readers knows, I've been neglecting each of the stories I've created. Well, if you want to hear an explanation; I've simply lost inspiration for a great majority of the fandoms I've been writing for.

It's supposed to be a fun vacation in celebration of graduation. But it turns out to be fatally worse than they imagine; the group unknowingly steps into the trap of a ghost town, the main attraction being the House of Wax. (AU, AH). (The Vampire Diaries) Phew! *wipes off sweat* still with me? Now, here are my stories that are complete but no sequels in progress. Let me explain… Only Human — Rose never imagined that she would meet the striking God of Thunder in the New Mexico desert, let alone become good friends with the banished man; and never did she imagine that her best friend, Jane, would strangely fall in love with the mighty Thor. Set during the events of Thor. Future Loki/OC Thor/Jane *COMPLETE* I've successfully finished this fic but never wrote a sequel… If you were a fan of this fic and have a wonderful idea of where Rose's story could've gone, don't hesitate to send me a PM. Here are my Hangover fanfics that I've completed: Raise Your Glass — Four best friends: Paige, Jamie, Connie, and Zoey decide to spend their weekend in Vegas for a kick-ass birthday.

OKIE-DOKIE! All the stories I've listed above are up for adoption like I've said several times. It pains me to do this but I've realized that it's not fair to many of my readers who've waited for me, some patient, some not. If you're interested in adopting one of my fics, please do PM me and we can discuss further details from then on. I thank everyone for having the patience to read this awfully long and bittersweet message… P.S. I'm not permanently finished with fan fiction. I do plan on starting new with fresh stories and ideas.. especially during the summer time. ","Summary":" This Is The End A/N: so...

I'm Emma,I'm 31 and I live next door to Seth Rogen. Well,I did..before last night. I guess I'm stuck here with these guys until we get rescued now. After everything happened last night most of us slept downstairs together. Everyone but James. I was sandwiched between Seth and Jonah. To be honest I had a great sleep. I woke up to the sound of James shouting as he darted across the room \"DANNY'S ALIVE AND HE'S EATEN ALL THE FUCKING FOOD!\" I sat up and looked over at Danny as everyone ran over to him. A smile began to grow on my face as I saw him. His smug little face. I got up and stretched. I was only in one of James' big t-shirts he let me sleep in. \"Calm the fuck down guys!

That's all the food we have!\" Seth said as he looked at Danny. \"That's supposed to last us until we get rescued!\" Craig stated. I laughed as I walked over to the table. \"Good to see you Daniel\" I said as I smirked. \"hello you\" Danny said as he looked me up and down and bit his lip. \"Don't look at her in that way\" Seth said as he looked at Danny. Danny chose to ignore Seth. \"You're looking good Emma..as always..when are we gonna fuck?\" Danny sniggered. I laughed as I said \"I was thinking right now? On this table\" \"Come here then\" Danny said as he opened his arms. \"Oh shut up Danny!\" James barked at Danny. \"She just came on to me!\" Danny laughed. \"I was kidding..\" I said as I smirked. \"You're only kidding yourself baby\" Danny said as he winked at me. \"Oh god..don't me vomit\" I laugh. Danny shoved some more bacon down his throat. \"DANNY STOP!\" Craig shouted as he grabbed Danny's cheeks. \"ALRIGHT!\" Danny shouted as he spat out the bacon all over everyone. \"Alright! Alright!\" Danny looked around at everyone. \"Do you not know what's going on?\" James asked Danny. \"Everyone is gone..\" Jonah said as he looked at Danny. \"Okay..I know what happened..you dropped acid didn't you? Franco,you've got white stuff around your mouth,you probably sucked some guys dick-\" Danny didn't finish as I interrupted \"Danny,shut the fuck up! Seriously..we didn't drop acid-\" Danny interrupted me \"I like it when she's feisty\" He bit his lip as he stared at me. \"This isn't a joke Danny\" Craig said. A bang comes from the door and we all swiftly turn around and look at the door. I look over at Seth and grip his arm tightly. \"Come here Em\" Seth said as he pulled me in to a hug. \"What the fuck?\" Danny looked at the door in confusion. \"You've got to help me! Did you not hear me knocking? Things have gotten crazy out here!\" A man said as he poked his head through the hole he made in the door. Danny mimicked his voice as he laughed \"This guy fucking sucks\" He laughed as he pointed at the door. \"Guys..I don't think we should let him in\" James said to us all quietly. \"What? What?..you can't just leave him out there..to die\" Jay tried to reason with him. \"We don't know him..he could be a rapist..or a tittie fucker!\" James argued. \"Are you gonna tittie fuck us?\" Seth asked as I laughed to myself. \"If you want me to tittie fuck you I will oh so good oh you'll love it\" the man pleaded as I began to laugh quietly to myself. \"Even if he is a rapist he couldn't rape all of us\" Jonah pleaded. \"He'd just rape Emma\" Danny said \"Well we can't let him in then\" James stated. \"I'm not gonna rape anyone! I just want to live!\" The man said before having his head chopped off right in front of us,just as Danny got up to let him in. \"THIS IS REAL! THIS IS FUCKING REAL!\" Danny shouted as he kicked the head across the floor and we all began to play soccer with a mans head. \"Guys guys! Stop! This man was alive a few seconds ago! We can't play soccer with his head!\" Jonah said. \"Pick it up Jonah..\" James said as Jonah picked up the head. Blood leaked out of the head as Jonah threw it back on the floor. \"It blinked at me! It blinked at me!\" Jonah wined as he moved away. Craig shrieked quietly as he covered the mans head with a blanket and pushes it away. \"Someone should look through the hole\" Seth said quietly. \"I'm not looking through that hole! Last person to look through that hole got his head chopped off!\" Craig said in a high pitch voice. \"Let's go look out the window upstairs..\" James said to us all and he lead us all upstairs. We looked out of the window to see fire everywhere,smoke,ashes and one big hole. No sign of life or \"Seriously? What the fuck is this? We need to..stay inside..board this place up and take inventory of all the food and shit we have\" Danny stuttered. \"We did that already! You ate it all!\" Craig stated. \"Mm hm..dead weight\" James muttered. \"I'm dead weight?\" Danny questioned. \"Yeah you're dead weight because you waisted all the water and the fucking food!\" James argued. \"Look who's being petty..Tom petty..\" Danny muttered. \"Guys..can we stop arguing?\" I interrupted. \"Emma's right..we all need to start getting along\" Seth said. \"I'm trying to get along with everyone..I made breakfast trying to make amends with you\" Danny said. \"You need to stop being an asshole Danny\" I stated. \"Holy shit,she's hot when she's feisty\" Danny said as he bit his lip. \"Fuck off\" I rolled my eyes. \"She is hot when she's feisty but-\" Craig said but was interrupted by Seth \"She's not a piece of meat guys! And she's stood right here\" \"Emma is an angel,can we all just stop disrespecting her\" Jonah said softly. \"It's only Danny and Craig..\" Jay said. \"Um..Jay,don't make this any harder okay?\" Jonah replied. \"Look,we're not getting anywhere just standing here arguing\" Seth said firmly. \"Exactly\" James said,in support of Seth. \"So why don't we all just try and get along? Okay?\" Seth carried on. Everyone agreed with Seth as they looked around and nodded at each other. \"I'm sorry guys\" Danny apologised. \"Thank you Danny\" Seth added. We went downstairs and cleaned up the head that was on James' floor. After that we all sat around and watched a movie. As they sat around I snook upstairs and laid in bed for a while. I just stared at the ceiling,alone in my own thoughts. I jolted up as Danny came in. \"Hey..\" Danny said as he walked over to the bed. \"Um..what are you doing in here?\" I asked. \"Well I wanted to see you..I came to this party and I haven't even had a chance to be alone with you\" He said calmly as he sat on the bed. \"Um..well..I didn't know you wanted to see me?\" I laughed. \"Course I wanted to see you..you're so sexy\" \"Oh..um..thanks?\" I said as I widened my eyes. \"So..\" Danny moved closer to me as he put his hand on my bare thigh. \"Um..look..\" \"I'm just gonna tell you..you're hot..and I want you\" He began stroking my thigh. \"I'm very flattered Danny\" I laughed \"But I'm not interested in you..in that way..\" \"Oh baby,course you are\" He said as he moved his hand further up my thigh. My breathing got a little heavier and butterflies grew in my stomach. I wanted Danny. I knew if I did anything with him he'd make it awkward for me and he was my best friend. I didn't want to complicate anything with sex. \"Danny..\" I put my hand on his, \"don't..\" \"You want this\" He looked at my lips as he started to rub the outside of my underwear. \"Danny!\" I quickly grabbed his hand. \"what the fuck do you think you're doing? Are you a fucking idiot!?\" I tried to move away but he gripped my waist. He whispered \"Don't struggle\" My breathing got heavier. \"Danny! Stop! I don't wanna fuck you! Seriously..get off me\" I gripped his hand. \"We both want this\" He started to slip down my underwear. \"Danny! Don't!\" I tried to pull away as Jay came in. \"Hey are you? Danny! What the fuck are you doing?\" Jay ran over to me. \"What? Nothing?..\" Danny bit his lip. \"I um..\" I quickly stood up and grasped Jays arm. \"Did you just try it on with her?\" Jay asked as he grew angrier. \"What? No! God..I was just comforting her\" Danny argued. \"I have to um..go..\" Before I left I whispered in Jays ear \"Thank you..\" I ran downstairs.[Chapter 2] \"Hey you\" Seth said as he looked at me,his face lit up. \"Hey you\" I said as I walked over to him and wrapped my arms around him. \"Where have you been? I have missed your face\" Seth moaned quietly in my ear as he wrapped his arms around me. I moaned \"I just went for a lie down\" \"You smell good,Em\" Seth moaned. (He smelt like cigarettes and aftershave. I was used to it and to be honest I loved the way he smelt) \"thanks cutie,you do too\" I chuckled. \"How long have you two known each other now?\" Craig asked. \"Um..\" I looked at Seth \"About..4 years now? Yeah..3-4 years\" Seth smiled at me then looked at Craig. \"Jesus..I didn't realise\" I said. \"Wow..\" Craig said. \"I remember the day you moved next door..in those nice..short shorts..\" Seth smirked. I laughed as I looked at him. \"Ahh yes..and I couldn't always pay my bills so you let me get the odd shower at your place\" I chuckled. \"I bet you wanted her there didn't you Seth?\" Craig said. \"No..I was doing her a favour!\" Seth laughed. I looked up as Seth and smiled. \"I bet you thought you would be able to fuck her didn't you?\" Jonah added. \"What? No! I was just being nice!\" Seth defended himself. \"Shut up..any of you would have done the same\" I laughed. \"Yeah but..I would have joined you in the shower\" Craig added. \"Nice..\" I said as Danny and Jay walked down. Danny winked at me and laid down next to myself and Seth. \"If I lived next door to Emma I'd be masturbating a lot\" Danny said. \"Oh god..\" Jay said. \"Danny!\" Craig moaned. \"That's sick man\" Seth barked. \"Seriously? You're sick man\" James added. \"Alright! So what? I'm obviously gonna jerk off to the image of her at some point! I may as well just admit to it now\" Danny stated \"Danny...I love you,but please don't jerk off over me..\" I laughed. \"Seriously Danny..don't\" Seth said in a very serious tone. \"Woah Seth..I've never heard that serious voice before..has someone got a little thing for Emma?\" Danny smirked. \"Shut up Danny\" I said as I rolled my eyes. \"I don't okay..but she's my best friend and I'd prefer if you just respected her..\" Seth said. \"You're so cute\" I lifted my head up off his chest and smiles as I looked at his big grinning face. \"Well..what can I say?\" Seth chuckled. \"All I'm saying is..she's walking around here in James' t-shirt and it's going down to the top of her thighs,I can't help but look at those legs\" Danny moaned. \"Danny..will you just stop?\" Seth asked. \"I'm sorry but you're all thinking it\" Danny could see through them,just like Jay. \"Seth,I love you\" I moaned as I played with his hair. \"Yeah,you better\" Seth laughed as he held my hand with his other hand. \"Hey,where's your hoodie?\" I asked \"It's upstairs,why?\" Seth answered. \"Because I want to wear it..it smells like you and it's cozy\" I moaned. \"Want me to get it for you?\" Seth asked. \"Yes please\" I smiles as I got up and let Seth run off upstairs. In the meantime Danny moved closer to me. \"Hey big tits\" \"Daniel,hey you..\" I looked at him. \"It's going good..good..what size cup are you?\" He asked as he stared at my chest. \"Danny,will you just fuck off?\" I pushes him away by his face. \"I'm curious,what size are you?\" Jonah asked. \"Jonah! I'm not gonna tell you that!\" I whined. \"I kinda wanna know now..\" Craig moaned. \"Guys! Will you all stop pestering her?\" James said firmly. \"You're all being asses\" Jay added. Seth walked down with his hoodie. (It was a pulp fiction hoodie and it had a picture of Jewels and Vincent on it) \"Aw! Seth! You're a life saver!\" I stood up and smiles as I grabbed the hoodie. \"There ya go\" Seth said as he smiled and sat back down. I slipped the hoodie on. It was giant. I laughed \"I love how big this is\" \"You look so fucking adorable Em\" Seth smiled. I laughed as I laid back down between Seth and Danny. I grabbed Seth's arm and I wrapped it around me,I held his hand with both my hands and rested my cheek on his shoulder. \"James..\" I muttered. \"Yeah?\" He replied. \"Why have you got a massive dick statue?\" I asked. \"What? It's art okay!\" James stated. Danny laughed. \"It is..and I get to sleep under it\" Craig laughed. \"Is that because you're gay?\" Danny asked. \"Fuck you\" Craig muttered. \"Or is it because you've got a tiny dick?\" Danny asked. \"That doesn't even make sense?\" Jay added. \"My dick is bigger than all of yours\" Craig sniggered. \"Yeah..because you're black\" Seth said. \"True,black guys are supposed to have bigger dicks than white guys\" Jonah said. \"Cos you'd know\" Danny sniggered. \"Why the fuck are we sat here talking about dicks?\" I asked as I laughed. \"Don't pretend like you don't love it\" Danny ran his finger up my thigh. \"Danny! What the fuck was that?\" Seth said. \"Nothing?\" He laughed. \"Don't worry about it..\" I moaned. Time swiftly moved on,as the day went by we talked about dicks,pussy,gaming,Nicolas Cage..a lot of things..as it got later I got tired,it was about 1:30 am when I decided I was gonna go to bed. \"James\" I stood up and yawned. \"Can I sleep with you? In your bed?\" I asked. Seth looked at me \"you can sleep with me?\" \"I'd prefer to sleep in an actual bed\" I laughed,I bent down and kissed his cheek \"good night cutie\" \"C'mon Em,I'll go now\" James stood up. \"Don't kick me in the night Emma\" James moaned. \"I won't\" I laughed as we walked to his room. Meanwhile in the living room Seth buried his face in his hands. \"Hey man..do you like her?\" Craig asked. \"I think so..no actually yes..I do..I think I'm actually in love with her\" He moaned. \"Woah..you're in love with her?\" Jonah raised his eyebrows. \"I was not expecting that..\" Craig stuttered. \"That isn't gonna stop me\" Danny laughed. \"And that's because you're a fucking asshole Danny\" Seth looked up at Danny and barked at him. \"Don't go after Emma,Danny\" Craig said. \"What? We might never get to fuck another woman..of course I'm gonna snatch Emma up\" Danny said. \"Danny..leave Emma alone,Seth clearly feels really strongly about her\" Jay tried to reason with him. \"Fuck you guys,you're the ones gonna be sobbing when you have to fuck each other and I'm fucking one fine ass girl\" Danny laughed as he stood up. \"You wouldn't even know her if it wasn't for Seth\" Jay barked. \"Thank you Seth\" Danny said as he went in to the bathroom with James' porno magazine. \"He seriously better not..\" Seth moaned as he bit his lip.

Six long years she spends on the alien planet, searching fruitlessly for that feeling. That gut feeling, that she knows deep down will tell her that she belongs. That this is where she is meant to be, and is where she can always come back to. But she never does. And so she trains, working her way up under Yon-Rogg's tutelage, still wishing for that feeling of belonging to come. Nothing. She wonders for a time if she's just the picky sort, but she sees that look in her team's eyes when they return to Hala after a long mission, and she knows, she just knows that feeling is out there somewhere waiting to be found. And then there's a flicker of memory. A picture. Maria. She can almost taste the familiarity on her tongue, which she chases after but falls short of. There's something else to this woman she once knew, and Carol knows that she has to meet her, at least for her own peace of mind. She remembered this woman for a reason, and she needs to know the why of it all. All those years of memories, and yet she came back to her out of all of them. Why? And so she goes to meet her once again. She's met with an overjoyed hug from Monica, and a wide-eyed look of wonder from the woman that not even the most advanced alien race ever known could erase from her mind. Suddenly it all falls into place, and Carol knows at last that she's home once more.

Waves of endearment and gratification rocked her to her core, a sensation she had welcomed ever since learning to fly at the academy. Here, after all this time . She had lost count of how many mental snapshots she had taken since Carol's return. \"Do other aliens look like that? Besides the Skrulls?\" Monica inquired once more with a tug of the burgundy comforter. Bathed in the pale hues of old Star Trek reruns, the Danvers-Rambeau household had never felt more invigorated. Fighting over blankets notwithstanding, it was pleasant to have some time to relax after saving the world. Carol and Maria shiver on their ends of the leather couch as the warmth agonizingly escapes their bodies. Snatching her share of the blanket back, Carol replied, \"More or less,\", as if it were the most normal question in the world to answer. It astounded her just how much the show had gotten right in terms of her own interactions with life in space. The antagonists reminded her too much of the Kree however, which caused her to slump for a moment. \"But don't call them aliens. They're people.\" Maria took note of her lowered eyes, gone as soon as it came. It wasn't the first time today. \"What other kinds are there?\" Maria indulged, wanting in on the interrogation. Monica cheerfully tore her attention away from the box television set, the first of many to come throughout the night. Carol's pangs of dejection instantly evaporated, leaving her to wonder why she ever let her mind wander in the first place. The enthusiasm the Rambeau women had for science fiction was utterly adorable. \"Well, there are telepathic plants, sentient rocks, some with feathers for hair… But they all have their own traditions and bad jokes. And most of them do, in fact, come in peace.\" \"Do you, Airman Danvers?\" She pauses for dramatic effect. \"Not at all!\" As Carol lunged for a tickle attack, Maria jumped in without hesitation. Kicking her pajama'd legs violently, Monica's shrieks reverberate off the olive walls and fill the dimly-lit living room with ear-splitting delight. \"Cut it out! You guys are mean!\" Settling down, cheeks red from exertion, Carol jests, \"You still love us!\" \"You'll both be hearing from my lawyers.\" \"For what?\" exclaimed Maria, voice cracking. \"You have no proof we did anything.\" Crossing her arms. \"I refuse to speak without my legal team present.\" \"Are you serious?\" \"Deadly.\" Neither of them could hold a straight face for long and quickly saw themselves snickering like schoolchildren. Intoxication gradually died down as the episode went to commercial break and Monica hopped over the couch to wash her hands and grab some popcorn. Maria stretched and propped her feet on the wooden coffee table, her fuzzy purple socks on display for all to see. Carol found herself admiring them. And Maria in general. Maria's concentration drifted toward Carol, whose smile enfolded her entire face as they locked eyes. She couldn't exactly match Carol's crinkled expression with the image of earlier still etched in her thoughts. With Monica out of the room, Maria took it upon herself to address her apprehensions head-on. \"You doing okay? For real?\" Carol snorted as if it were some wild accusation. \"Of course. Why wouldn't I be?\" \"I don't know, I just catch you with a look sometimes. You had it at dinner and now tonight.\" \"Oh, it's just allergies. Don't worry about it.\" Maria musters a grimace that screams you-did-not-just-say-that . Carol wasn't allergic to anything except taking compliments without objection. \"I… I find myself thinking about you and Monica sometimes, and how much… I missed,\" sighed Carol, sinking her chin into her gray USAFA sweatshirt. \"Years of our lives gone, without each other in it. And it just makes me wonder… if I could have done something different to prevent it.\" Twirling her short dark hair in anxiousness, Maria breathes, \"Glad we're on the same page.\" They share a worn-out laugh together, Monica slamming cupboards in the kitchen. Rubbing her clammy palms with the sleeves of her green flannel, her tearful gaze ceases to falter in the coming declaration. \"I can't even begin to describe how angry I was. With myself, the world, whatever took you away from me and my little girl. What did we do to deserve this? Did I do something wrong? No matter how high I flew or how loud I screamed over an engine, I couldn't find my answers in the sky and that killed me. It took me awhile to realize that they were right in front of me the whole time, where everything I cared about was. Monica. Our home. You. The hope that you'd return someday was all we needed to hang on to. And here we are now.\" \"Always the one to look on the bright side.\" Carol wiped a runaway tear from her cheek. \"It's just hard, Maria… nothing in the entire universe compares to the pain of not knowing who I am and how much you and Monica mean to me. There were so many days where I couldn't even bring myself to get out of bed and fight their war... And now that we're back together, I have to leave again. It's the worst feeling in the world. I'm the happiest I've ever been, but if I just followed my heart sooner… maybe then we'd have more time…\" Maria inches closer to Carol, gently resting her hand atop of hers. \"All that matters is that you did. We've been given a second chance, Carol! No matter where you are, you'll always have a home here with people who love you. If this world and our friendship has taught us anything, it's that we won't let our fears define who we are. We're so much more than that.\" \"Higher, further, faster?\" Carol sniffed. \"Higher, further, faster\" Maria affirmed. Time stood still as they studied their features and gravitated toward each other in the most natural of embraces. As Maria tucked her nose in the crook of Carol's neck, Monica sauntered in with a package of popcorn and a blue bowl in hand. She observes their puffy eyes but doesn't bother bringing it up. No need reminding herself of the inevitable. They break apart with reassuring nods as Monica takes her seat between them once again. \"Alright, Magic Hands, do your thing\" Monica instructed, handing the crinkly bag of uncooked popcorn to Carol. The atmosphere of the room exhaled a much-needed sigh of relief. \"Is that all I am to you?\" croaked Carol in mock opposition. \"A personal microwave?\" \"Pretty much.\" Only half-kidding. \"I'm not responsible for any messes.\" Blue and gold energy crept up Carol's forearms toward her calloused fingertips. The bag soon began to inflate and pop as waves of color enveloped Carol's hands. Witnessing such extraordinary abilities in the most ordinary situations would perhaps never grow old to Maria and Monica. Carol grinned back, the radiant swirls of constellations glimmering in the amber pools of their tender eyes; a photo no camera could authentically portray. Maria seized the bag before it could explode and dumped its contents into the plastic bowl between her daughter's lap. The buttery smell combined with the comfort of Saturday night permeated their senses and set any remaining doubts at ease. The episode had since started back up, but neither of them seemed to mind missing the first couple minutes. They were right where they needed to be. Bundling themselves up once more over The Next Generation , Carol, Maria, and Monica took turns grabbing handfuls of popcorn and tossing pieces into each other's mouths. They knew that their time was limited, but it did no good worrying about what-ifs when cherishing the what-is was irreplaceable. Despite all of her uncertainties with the world around her, there was one thing Carol was sure of: No matter what the future had in store, the connection she shared with the loves of her life would always lead her back home. That sentiment was something that came just as easily as the instinct to get back up when beaten down; her sturdiest supports that kept her balanced off the ground and in the stars. We found each other . We have a second chance . Maria's words rang true in Carol's mind. That's all that matters .

He didn't believe in fate. The world was filled with too many moving parts to be considered one massive machine. Sitting in a lawn chair, his legs stretched out over the deck, glass of iced tea in hand, he watched Carol Danvers flop back into the grass. Monica Rambeau giggled beside her; all boundless child energy and thin limbs drowning in the sea of life tickling her skin. Above them, the sky was dark and dotted with winking stars already drunk on the heavy, summer night. Humidity weighed down soft words, leaving only muffled, indistinguishable murmurs to reach the house. Ice clinked against glass, crickets sang out their songs, and Maria pushed open the screen door. She sat down on the steps, her own drink in hand, and leaned back to watch Carol and her daughter. Somewhere in the dark, metal jingled as Goose chased insects through the shadows. Nick Fury didn't quite believe in coincidences, but he watched Carol tackle Monica, listened to Maria's laughter, and saw Goose slink out of the night to sit on the banister and figured that, maybe, some things were just too perfect not to be. oOo \"Breakfast?\" Maria said softly, standing by the stove in a red Han Solo tank top that was so faded it almost looked pink. Birdsong drifted through the window and Goose was sprawled across the counter, dozing in a long patch of sun. \"Sure,\" Fury said, \"need any help?\" Maria waved him off. \"Not in here,\" she said, already placing the pans on the stove. \"Mind fetching the eggs?\" Fury scratched Goose between the ears (and got a soft rumble of a chirrup) before taking the offered bowl and heading outside. The world hadn't quite warmed up just yet; sun still rising up over the tips of the trees. Chicken clucked at him, dodged around his feet. Maria had already scattered some feed and they pecked at the dirt while he gathered up the eggs. When he got back, Carol was digging through the fridge, hair a fluffed, tousled mess. Goose was trying (failing) to perch on her shoulder and Monica had tangled her fingers into her hole-filled t-shirt. She handed cheese over to Maria and reached up to steady the not-quite-a-cat. \"Morning,\" Fury said. With eyes too awake to be fully natural (god damn morning people), Carol wrapped her arm around Monica's slumping shoulders. \"Morning,\" she said, steering the young girl over to the table. \"How'd you sleep?\" Fury was rudely interrupted by his own yawn and Carol's grin was too knowing to be anything other than smug. oOo Monica's fingers dug into Fury's arm as the jet levelled out. Behind them there was earth; everything that they knew, everything they had come to expect. Before them there was the decloaked Kree Imperial Cruiser—massive and black and looking almost too alien against the backdrop of space. \"Is that it?\" Monica breathed, climbing closer to stand between Carol and Maria. \"Yeah, baby,\" Maria reached over, wrapped her arm around her daughter's waist, and pulled her close. \"That's it.\" Carol flicked a few switches and brought them around into the hangar. Talos was already waiting for them, hands clasped behind his back, movement buzzing around him as the Skrulls worked the repair the damage to the ship. The damage hadn't been too severe—nothing that fully breached the exterior—but work still needed to be done. Lifting a tote of toys, Carol led the way off the jet. Monica ran past her to Talos' daughter, both of them disappearing to some other part of the ship. Goose's tags jingled as she trotted after them. The Skrulls no longer jerked away from the Flerken, but Talos still grimaced when she brushed too close to his leg. \"How're the repairs coming?\" Carol walked, elbow to elbow with Talos. \"Good,\" he said, smiling at Soren as they passed. She pulled Maria away, talking about the bridge and something about the communications system. \"Just a few more tweaks to the engines and we should be ready to go.\" They walked past a couple more rooms—the kitchen, a lounge area, and stopped on the bridge. \"The plans you got us were very helpful.\" Carol grinned. \"Well,\" she said, \"what's the use of having a SHIELD agent as a friend if they can't get you into secure facilities?\" \"Hey!\" Nick cried, hands on his hips. Carol's grin was bright and no one gave chase as she fled to deeper places in the ship. oOo It took only one hour of proper work before Carol was out in front of the bridge. A wall of glass separated her from her audience as she wove a blazing, meteoric light show above the curve of the Earth. Laughing, the Skrull children clapped their hands and called out requests over the communicator until the sunlight faded from the long stretch of American soil and it was time for the humans to head back down to the planet. oOo \"You are never driving again,\" Fury said, stumbling out of the car. Carol had the gall to laugh at him, stepping out into the sunshine like she hadn't just tried to murder him with turns taken too fast and optional brakes. She let him wallow about finally having his feet back on solid ground while she tugged the massive totes of kitty litter out of the trunk. Each weighed about thirty-five pounds and she carried them like they were nothing more than a minor inconvenience. \"It wasn't that bad,\" Carol said when she came back and he was still leaning over his knees. \"You're so dramatic.\" \"No,\" Fury straightened. \"No; it was,\" He said and grunted when she dropped a bag of dry food in his arms. \"Are you aware that driving is not the same as flying?\" Hoisting the scratching post hover her shoulder, Carol filled the brand new litter box with unopened toys, and shrugged. \"It's been a couple of years,\" she said, gathering it all up and walking towards the house. \"And there's no lanes in space.\" \"Yeah,\" Fury grumbled, following, \"I noticed .\" oOo Keller called Fury back to work on a Thursday but, it was odd. Not wanting to go back to the office was normal. It was easy. That didn't mean it eased the ache of his heart as Carol, with Monica sitting on her shoulders, waved her arm wildly in a goodbye. She was wearing the SHIELD cap he had given her and was arm in arm with Maria. People walked around them, not sparing a glance for the two women whose fingers were sticky from humidity, honey, and the knowledge that they'd saved the Earth from destruction. \"Bye, Nick!\" Monica called, voice and body above the crowd, unashamed at the looks her volume attracted. Fury waved back unable to stop the grin on his face. When he finally landed in LA a few hours later and stopped by his office, the first email in in his inbox was a collection of scanned pictures. There were a few lopsided ones of Goose playing and lounging around the Rambeau household, some of Carol and Maria singing Karaoke and fighting over a board game, and a couple of Monica and Nick's Nerf gun battle on the Kree ship. The last one was taken by Talos, probably sometime during their last trip to visit the Skrulls. The four of them were silhouetted by the sun rising over the edge of the Earth; Maria leaning into Carol's side, Monica sandwiched between them, and Fury tugged close by a stubborn, super-powered woman. Side by side they stood in the consol room, looking down over their planet. oOo \"Sir?\" Coulson knocked on the edge of the door, head peaking around the frame. \"You have a visitor.\" \"Who—\" Fury glanced up from his report but Coulson was gone. Carol walked in and kicked the door shut behind her. Aviator sunglasses sat on her nose, the grey baseball cap was backwards, and her leather jacket half hid an Air Force t-shirt. She had a brown cat carrier in one hand and a box of things—toys, a bed, and some other things he couldn't quite make out—under her other arm. California sunlight seemed dim against her wide grin and the tiredness that clung to Fury's shoulders dropped away at the pure energy that seemed to flow through Carol's every step. Her chaos burned through the order of SHIELD, igniting something in his being that felt like starlight and tasted like lemonade. \"Nice office,\" she said, placing the box and carrier on his desk. Goose meowed and stuck her nose against the bars until they opened. Free, the Flerken stretched each limb and sniffed at everything in sight. \"Hey there, Goosey,\" Fury scratched her under the chin and she purred against his hand. Only when the Flerken pulled away to go explore the rest of the office did his attention turn back to the woman examining the map on the back wall. \"What're you doing here?\" \"Ship's done,\" Carol said, turning away from the drawing of the Earth to pull up a chair. She slumped into it, legs spread out, arms crossed over her chest. \"I'm leaving with Talos tomorrow to help him find a place to settle his people. Maybe help find the other colonies scattered across the universe.\" Oh. Right. They all knew that the time was drawing close. Carol continued to smile her kind, gentle smile; blue eyes soft like where the sky met the ground on the horizon. Together they watched Goose pad around the room, batting at the leaves of fake plants and climbing up the shelves of his bookcase. \"Guess this is goodbye, huh,\" Fury said. \"Kinda,\" she said. \"I was actually wondering if you'd watch Goose for a while.\" Settling on the windowsill, Goose watched the people on the street below, tailing flicking and curling. \"Thought you were going to leave her with Maria?\" Carol shrugged, \"I was,\" she said. \"But the Tesseract is still, uh,\" her eyes flicked over to the Flerken, \" missing and I figured it would be best to have her close by until it shows up.\" Until the Flerken did whatever Flerken's did with what they swallowed. Hopefully it wouldn't come up in some nasty space hairball. That would certainly be something to explain to his superiors. \"Yeah,\" Fury said, \"I'll watch the cat.\" \" Flerken .\" \"Uh huh.\" oOo The universe kept moving, the stars kept shining, and, sometimes, Nick Fury looked up at the sky and knew that in the middle of all the darkness, there was a woman who shone like the sun. oOo \"People still have questions,\" Coulson said, following at Fury's heel. Most of the office had gone home, leaving just the two agents, a couple of stragglers, and the cleaning crew. The sun hadn't even set yet—the joys of the summer—but the office building still managed to feel abandoned. \"About you, the Kree, and the woman.\" \"It's in the report,\" Fury said, resisting the urge to scratch at the three scabs that crossed beneath his new eye patch. The leather dug into his skin and it seemed that each spare thought turned towards the weight of it around his head. Monica had thought it was cool, though. Even called him a pirate in her last letter. A couple of thick-soled boots and a longer jacket later and it made the other agents pause before talking to him, skirting out of his way when he walked. Suspects talked faster and very few people resisted arrest. It was nice. \"Understood, sir,\" Coulson said, drifting off into silence as they took the elevator up. Fury left the other agent at his cubical desk, walked to his office, and opened the door. Goose sat on his desk; tail wrapped around her paws and purring loud enough that he could hear it across the room. Beside her, dripping with something , was the Tesseract. Its blue light pulsed in an almost sad rhythm, as if it had been through the worst places imaginable. Maybe it had. Who knew what existed in a Flerken? Stepping back, Fury closed the door, locked it, and turned to Coulson. \"No one goes in there,\" he said, \"understood?\" \"Yes, sir.\" Coulson was still standing guard when Fury came back a half hour later with a metal lunch box and two oven mitts. oOo Maria Rambeau's resume showed up on his desk some three weeks after Carol had left. It arrived with another handwritten note from Monica, a couple of pictures (one of Fury sleeping on the couch, Goose in his lap), and two cover letters. One was for Fury's boss, detailing her achievements, why they should hire her, the usual spiel. The words swam in the same, easy confidence that both Carol and Maria thrived in and her recommendations came from pilots, commanders, and scientists alike. The other was for Fury and had only one line written in swirling, cursive script: You win, Pirate Man. oOo \"With all due respect, sir,\" Fury told Keller, \"Maria Rambeau is the best damn pilot I've ever seen.\" oOo The bar sat along a stretch of beach road—ocean to the front, city to the back. Maria downed what was left of her beer. Neon played across her dark skin, painted across the line of her jaw and the curve of her cheek. Her red t-shirt looked more like blood underneath the mix of colours but her smile was wide as she laughed. \"We were idiots,\" Maria told him, \"Lawson didn't mind, though; I think she liked it.\" She paused, hummed under her breath, stared down at her hands. \"Or, well. Mar-Vell, I guess. But she'll always be Doctor Lawson to me.\" The silence of mourning old friends drifted between them. Respect burned for the Kree scientist who had given her life to help those that needed it. Maria lifted her bottle and saluted the ceiling and, beyond it, the stars. \"Bet the base loved you,\" Fury said, finishing off his drink. That made Maria laugh long and hard. \"Hell no,\" She managed around her giggles. \"Oh, god; no those boys hated us.\" Resting her chin in her hand, Maria sighed. \"Women couldn't fly combat so we were stuck testing Lawson's planes which, I mean. It wasn't perfect but it was good. Felt right, you know?\" Her gaze drifted away, staring at something Fury couldn't see. \"Carol and I would spend hours in the sky flying those planes. Have mock dog fights day in and day out, testing our reflexes to the limit. Going higher, further, faster.\" \"So that day, in the desert,\" Fury set his beer down on the table. \"That was your first time ever being in an actual combat situation?\" Maria grinned at him. \"That's right,\" she said, \"spent years and years training for a dogfight like that. Practicing, pretending. After Carol's death, though,\" the words caught and she looked away, swallowed. \"The sky didn't seem all that welcoming anymore and I could only think about the next test flight, the next time one of those planes went down.\" She closed her eyes. \"When they started pretending the flight didn't even happen, I knew I couldn't stay anymore.\" oOo The thing about meeting a woman who could fly, shoot energy blasts, and had a cat that was bigger on the inside was that there was literally nothing on planet Earth that could surprise Nick Fury. Not anymore. Eye patch, leather coat, big black boots, and his unflappable attitude got attention in all the right places. Or the wrong ones seeing that people pretty high on the food chain started demanding him to be the one sent off to all the shitty weird-ass missions. Next door neighbour suddenly had gills and scales? No problem. Some weird ass looking object had drifted by Earth? Nothing but an alien spaceship passing through. Weird Dog creatures climbing out of the ocean? Just another Thursday afternoon. Fury jumped from Level Three to Level Six within a year. Maria just laughed at him. oOo Carol arrived in Louisiana three days before Christmas and spent two of them sleeping. Goose stayed in the guestroom with her, curled on one of the pillows and kept watch with half lidded eyes. The rubber suit had been abandoned in a crumpled on the floor and carol had managed (barely) to pull a tank top over her head before crawling on top of the covers. Monica checked on her every couple of hours to see if she was awake. Maria checked every few hours to make sure she was still breathing. \"Did she say anything?\" Fury whispered, peeking past the door. Blonde hair was sprawled across the pillows, mixing with soft, orange fur. Carol slept on her stomach with her mouth open, arms folded underneath her head. A breeze drifted through the window, playing with the curtains, and the day was warm despite it being the beginning of winter. \"Just gave me a hug, said that she was tired, and passed out,\" Maria said and tugged him away. \"Come on, she'll be fine.\" oOo The morning of Christmas Eve, Fury walked downstairs to Goose chasing balls of wrapping across the kitchen floor and Carol with a pile of gifts at her feet. She looked like a raccoon caught trying to dig through a garbage can before leaping up out of the chair, blocking her presents from sight, and waving her hands wildly to force him back up the stairs. \"Shoo!\" Carol hissed, mindful of the noise and the darkness outside the windows. \"Go away! I'm not done!\" \"Just one little peek?\" Fury tried to turn around, his smile widening as she ignited, floating to block his view of the kitchen, arms spread to take up more space. \"They're going to be opened in a few hours anyway!\" Carol's laugh filled him from head to toe. \"No!\" She cried. \"Nu uh! It's Christmas!\" \"What about a hint? Can I get a hint?\" Shaking her head, Carol tried to soften the volume of her giggles the closer to Monica and Maria's rooms they got. \"You're ridiculous,\" she said, \"fine; one hint.\" Fury's one good eye narrowed as she leaned in. There was mischief in her gaze; a wildness to her grin. \"You ready?\" \" Yes ,\" he said. Carol smiled and it was like a storm ripping through him, tearing down the walls and doors of his soul to open him up for the sky to come flooding in. \"It's from space ,\" she whispered and turned, bounding back down the stairs before he could make a grab at her. \"What—of course it's from space! That's not fair!\" Her amusement echoed through the house, brightening up the corners before the sun had fully woken up. oOo \"We should probably open the space gifts before my parents get here,\" Maria said, powdered sugar on her bottom lip from the French toast. Fury collected the plates, snickering at Carol's pout. \"But I spent so much time wrapping them,\" the super-powered human whined, laying her head down on the table. \"You should at least let them stay that way for just a little bit longer.\" Maria pretended to think about it. \"Nah,\" she said. \"Get the weird, questionable gifts out of the way before the normal people arrive.\" \"Don't worry Auntie Carol,\" Monica said, sitting up straight in her seat, hands folded on her lap, trying to hide her grin with pursed lips. \"I'll be sure to fully appreciate your wrapping skills.\" Carol laughed and hugged the girl close. \"Thanks Lieutenant Trouble,\" she pressed a kiss to Monica's forehead. \"You're my favourite.\" oOo The gifts weren't the weird kind of weird Fury was expecting. No plants with teeth or dogs with three mouths. Instead, Carol gave them communication devices. Some flat, metal things that looked clear except for the fact that there was text rolling across the surface. \"They're called C-Sats,\" Carol said, \"kinda like a phone, camera, and video camera all in one,\" she held out her own, showing them how to use each button, \"but they'll reach across the universe. A lot of people use them to communicate in secret because their signals cannot be traced.\" \"Why keep the pager then?\" Nick said, lifting up the device, scrolling through the options until he captured a picture of a yawning Goose. Carol shrugged. \"These can only reach me when I'm in a certain radius of the access points,\" she gave them all a small smile. \"The pager is directly linked to my communicator; no matter where I am, the signal will get through.\" \"Where'd you get them?\" \"Mining colony,\" Carol plucked Maria's C-Sat out of her hands, typing something across it in rapid Kree glyphs. \"Some place called Knowhere; it's known for its markets.\" Monica leaned over her shoulder, watching as Carol connected it to Earth's satellites and networks. Fury frowned. \"What do they mine?\" \"You don't want to know,\" Carol said, held the device up, and grinned. \"Say cheese!\" She told Monica and snapped a picture. oOo Torn wrapping paper was shoved into boxes, the mess waiting for another hour to be cleaned up while Maria dragged Fury off with her to go clean up the dining room. Carol sat on the floor of the living room, Monica in her lap holding the communication device and flipping through pictures and videos that had already been taken. \"What's this one of?\" Monica said, pointing at what looked like a massive, skeletal head surrounded by nebulous clouds. \"That's Knowhere,\" Carol said, resting her chin on the young girl's head. \"It's not exactly a planet.\" Monica zoomed in on the large, empty eye sockets and shuddered. \"You're right,\" she said, \"I don't want to know what they mine there.\" Flipping to the next picture, she tilted her head to the side, looking down at the clear blue waters and man-made looking star-like landscape. \"Where's this?\" \"Xandar, capital of the Nova Empire.\" \"Are they like the Kree?\" Carol hummed. \"Kind of; they and the Kree have been at war for a thousand years.\" \"A thousand years?\" Monica breathed. \"Why?\" \"Each side has a different story,\" Carol said softly, her eyes on the Nova Corps' familiar star. \"This person did that, another person did this. I don't think anyone really knows who started it.\" Monica leaned back against her aunt's chest and Goose wormed her way onto their laps, purring as they laughed. Once the Flerken had settled, the C-Sat was flipped to the next picture. \"What about this one?\" oOo Nick Fury wasn't quite sure what to expect when he was dragged out to the SHIELD air base outside of Shreverport, but it certainly wasn't being strapped into the back seat of a jet and throwing up into a small brown bag. \" You alright back there?\" Carol called over the headset, humour bleeding through her words. \"Stomach still in the right place?\" \"Dunno yet,\" Fury groaned, pressing a hand against his stomach and taking as many deep, body filling breaths as he could. Now that the barrel rolls and flips had stopped tugging his centre of mass in all different directions it felt as though his cells were finally settling back down. \"Ask me again once I'm back on the ground.\" Laughter bled over and he watched as Maria lifted up beside them. \"Take it easy on him, Avenger; it's his first time.\" \" Aw! I'm your first, Fury? That's so cute!\" He rested his head in his hands. \"Please stop talking.\" oOo \"I take it back,\" Fury said, spread eagle on the grass, \"your flying is worse than your driving.\" \"That's fair,\" Maria said, squatting down beside him. \"I don't know why you didn't come with me; I'm not the one who crashed.\" Carol squawked and pushed the other woman over. \"I was shot out of the sky!\" \"Still counts!\" oOo Carol borrowed the open workshop for a few days, Monica standing by her side as she worked on a 'cat carrier that could withstand space'. It looked like a tiny spaceship backpack with its own gravity, oxygen supply, tiny litter box, and storage for food and water. \"I want to take Goose with me,\" she told Maria once the sun had set, the two of them beneath a blanket. The TV played in the background, sound muted so it was just the lights of each scene flashing across their faces. \"You know; a woman and her cat exploring the universe.\" \"Mmmhmm,\" Maria said. \"Can't let the boys and their dogs have all the fun.\" oOo Carol stayed on Earth until the end of January. Two weeks in Louisiana, flying planes and showing Monica the universe on a thin screen. Two weeks in LA where she followed Fury around, poking at his investigations and laughed at the way the agents scrambled out of his way. She sampled wedding cakes just because she could, asked a woman at the beach teach her how to surf, and stayed up late playing with Goose. Carol existed loudly because it was the only way she knew how. At the end of the month, when she packed up her Flerken in the special built-for-space carrier and carved a trail of starlight across the ocean sky, Fury wondered if he would ever get used to the silence she left behind. oOo Peggy Carter arrived at the Los Angeles office with an entourage of agents. Her steps spelled out business and her movement was sharpened around the edges. She was an old blade, a sheathed blade, but that didn't make her any less deadly. Fury stood up when she entered his office, hands on his desk as she closed the door behind her. \"Ma'am,\" he said, nodding his head but unwilling to tear his gaze away from her. \"What can I do for you?\" Peggy tugged a chair forward, sat down, crossed one leg over the other, and stared at him with unblinking eyes. \"Tell me about Captain Carol Danvers,\" she said. Sitting down, Fury leaned back in his seat, folded his hands over his lap, and kept his face carefully blank. \"What would you like to know?\" oOo \"She's a pilot.\" \"Yes.\" \"But you don't agree with that.\" \"Not particularly.\" Carter hummed, leaned back, tapped her toes against the floor. \"What would you call her, then, Agent Fury?\" \"To put it simply, Mrs. Carter; I'd call her what she is.\" \"And what is that?\" Fury met her spear-glinting gaze with his own. \"A hero.\" oOo Peggy Carter left just as suddenly as she arrived, but before she walked out of the office, she turned once more to Fury. \"I expect great things from you, Agent,\" she said, hand on the doorknob. \"And if your friend comes back around, please tell her that I'd very much like to meet her.\" \"I'll pass the message along,\" he said and watched her go. Only when her heels had faded down the hallway did Fury relax back into his seat and rub a hand down his face. \"Sir?\" His head snapped up, heart thundering in his chest. Jesus . \"What is it, Rook?\" \"Was that—was that who I think it was?\" \"No, Agent, it was not.\" Coulson nodded, once. \"Understood, sir. Do you need me to take any files down to records?\" Fury looked at the stack on his desk. \"Negative, Agent,\" he said. \"You're clear to go home.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" He watched Coulson shut the door behind himself, waited until he was sure there would be no more interruptions, and pulled out the C-Sat. Met someone who'd be excited to meet you next time you're in the neighbourhood. oOo Fury gets the message early in the morning, cup of coffee in hand, sun just rising over the edge of the city and making the ocean glisten. Look what I found, Carol had typed out and there's a picture of something long, metallic, and looking like a melted version of a telescope. Fury put down his coffee. What the hell is it? I have no idea , she said. oOo It's a space probe , she told him, hours later. Not ours, someone else's. Who? Carol's answer was instantaneous; I don't know. oOo Another picture came in, a panel taken off the side of the probe. Goose glared hatefully at the interior, hackles raised, ears flat, and teeth bared in a hiss. Beware the Flerken's true, natural enemy, \" Carol had sent. The Alien Space Probe . oOo I'm going to call her Freckles, Carol wrote underneath another picture of the slightly gutted machine. Goose was laying across a toolbox, tail wrapped around her body, eyes closed as she slept. What do you think? Fury rolled his eye and finished his dinner. I think you're ridiculous. You're the one with the eye patch, drama queen. He ignored her for the rest of the night and it was only when he was getting into bed that she sent him another picture. It was lopsided, awkward, and pulled just far enough away to capture Carol, the space probe, and half of Goose's butt. The blonde had a pair of dark aviator looking goggles over her eyes, a wide grin on her face, and was holding up one hand. At the end of her pointer finger there was a small, white flame. Who needs a blowtorch when you're literally on fire? oOo Fury woke up to about twenty more messages. The first happened to be from an exasperated Maria and only said; Have you seen what she's up to ? The other twenty-one were all images of Carol with the probe; her pressing her cheek against that of an unimpressed Goose with it in the background, wrapping the machine in a tarp and holding it like a child, and others that were works in progress of her fiddling with wires, removing bits and replacing them with others, and one that was a picture of her reflection in the lens. A video was included and Fury watched Goose approach the probe on the tips of her toes, back in an arch, fur pointed up like a porcupine. She walked closer, slowly, each movement calculated, eyes unblinking. Each second grew longer, the video shook from silenced laughter. The machine's lens shifted a fraction of an inch. Goose jumped a good four feet in the air and scrambled away, yowling into a corner while Carol's laughter echoed in the background. Poor Goose, Fury wrote, heading out to his car. Watch out or she might eat it. Carol responded when he was pulling up to the SHIELD offices with a picture of her sprawled on top of what looked like some sort of sleeping bag. Her smile was half hidden behind a bright orange tail—which Carol was pretending to wear as a moustache. A paw was pressed against her cheek, claws sheathed, and Goose's head was partially in the frame with just the tip of her tongue sticking out. She's fine . oOo Be free, my child! Carol sent Fury with a picture of the probe being launched back into the wide open wilderness of space. You must go your own way now! Fury sighed over his supper. That's it? He typed back. You just fixed it up and let it go? Hardly, Carol sent back. But hush. It's a surprise. A few minutes later, he received another 'ping'. Carol was ignited, her hair ablaze, eyes glowing with the same ferocity of two suns. She was floating in what looked like space, the cowl highlighting the soft roundness of her cheeks and the strong line of her jaw. \"Oh my God, Fury,\" she said in the video, a smile filled with pride and giddiness bursting across her face. \"They're going to lose their goddamn minds .\" oOo A full forty-eight hours later and twenty-four images were released from what NASA was calling the 'Remembrance Probe'. It wasn't Earth made and the machine itself was nowhere close to the actual solar system, but the DSN managed to catch the transmissions it was giving off anyway. It was proof, scientists said, that the human race wasn't alone and that the universe was more wild and stranger than they could have ever imagined. Coming in clear, full colour resolution they were easily the most gorgeous pictures of space Earth had ever seen. But it wasn't those that caught the eyes of the population. No, instead it was the four photographs that came from what must have been a security feature built into the probe's internal shell. They were the first that arrived and the ones that held the spotlight the longest. The first one was of a woman; her face covered in a red, metallic cowl that left only the bottom half of her face visible. Blonde hair stuck out of the top like the Mohawk of an old Roman helmet and her eyes burned with an internal fire. She was dressed in what many were assuming was some sort of red, blue, and gold space suit and was leaning into the camera, head tilted in curiosity. Carol. Her body blocked most of the blurry, out of focus background, but did nothing to hide the splash of orange peeking over her shoulder. A cat. A small, orange tabby with wide, brass eyes and an unreadable tag but Fury didn't need to read the letters to know that it was Goose. The next picture was lit by what Fury could only describe as a cheap, shitty flash that could only come from a disposable camera at a dark party. White light highlighted the grimace on Carol's face and how the cowl pulled away from her features as if the edges were on fire. On her shoulder, Goose's ears flattened and her fur was spiking up. There was something about it, though. Something that was only summed up by the third and forth pictures: Because in the third, the cowl had fallen away, leaving Carol with her shoulder length blonde hair staring into the camera like someone had just pulled a party popper in front of her face. Goose, on the other hand, had arched her back completely. Fur was spiked, teeth were bared, and her tail was up like a warning shot. It was the forth that was Nick's favourite; because Carol was laughing. She had her hand against her abdomen while her head was thrown back, eyes closed, and mouth open. The probe had captured the exact second that shock had given away to unbridled joy. In one, swift moment, the camera had captured the beauty of the human soul in one sparking instant billions of light years away from Earth. Unfortunately, the other twenty images were swept aside for the first four, but the scientific communities around the world grasped each image with white knuckled tightness. Carol had, at some point, flown the Probe access point to access point and had let the little machine take pictures along the way. Two galaxies spinning into each other in a monstrous collision course that was taking place over millions and millions of years, a planet so massive that its rings had rings, star systems with a dozen, tiny suns spinning around each other, asteroid belts made up of glowing, shimmering rocks that looked as though they were vanishing and appearing someplace else. Each image had been purely theoretical, brought to life in the most incredible way imaginable. There were others, as well; wilder ones, terrifying ones. A creature the size of Venus swimming through the desolation of a broken solar system; a planet, boiling and brewing, looking almost alive beneath its threadbare atmosphere. But it was the last that was probably the most beautiful of all: It was a simple thing, a spiral galaxy surrounded by the darkness of space. The Milky Way. Because even in the depths of space surrounded by wonder and beauty that most people could only ever dream of, Carol Danvers had turned the probe and its lens towards home. ","Summary":" Nick Fury didn't believe in coincidences. He didn't believe in fate. The world was filled with too "},{"Movie":"Captain Marvel","Title":"North Star","Author":"cosmicwanda","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13247954","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A spaceship chases them through the clouds. It happens in a heartbeat. They crash-land by the lake, pieces of the aircraft and bits of debris strewn across the shoreline. Sand on her cheeks and blood in her mouth, Carol's breath rattles in her chest. It hurts. Something inside of her feels wrong, and her ribs ache as she twists around to look at Lawson in the seat behind her. The ride was bumpy, to say the least. But they're alive, and that counts for something. She takes a deep breath in through her nose. When Maria's voice crackles over the radio, Carol exhales slowly. It's good to hear a friendly voice, warm and familiar and tinged with concern. \"Danvers, you copy?\" \"Yeah, I copy. We hit ground.\" Carol says. \"Carol, you ok? They were—\" There isn't time to explain any of it. We hit ground, a spaceship shot us out of the sky, we could still be in trouble. It wouldn't make any sense to Maria. It doesn't make sense to Carol. She pulls her helmet off and lets it drop to the cockpit floor. \"Yeah, I copy.\" She climbs out of the pilot's seat, grunting with the effort it takes. Carol's glad for the feeling of solid ground beneath her boots, if only for a moment. Then the feeling is gone, dissolving into the air when she sets eyes on Lawson; still strapped into the plane, and injured, a smear of dark blood at her temple. \"Doc,\" Carol says, moving to pry Lawson's helmet off. \"Your blood, it's...it's blue. \" But it can't be. \"Yeah, but how's my hair?\" Blood shouldn't be that color, Carol thinks, oddly transfixed. Blue. She wants to know what it means. Wants to know why, and how, and when. Lawson's breath hitches slightly, snapping Carol back into the present. \"Help me out, will you?\" Lawson asks. Carol unbuckles Lawson's seat belt. First, there had been that ship, firing at them, chasing them back to Earth. And now this. The blood. The color of it, dark and inky and a rich blue. Still a little dazed from the abrupt landing, Carol is almost convinced that she's seeing things, that it's just her mind playing tricks on her. Almost. She could never make something like this up. She gets an arm around Lawson and helps her out of the plane. Wincing, the woman sags against her, leaning all her weight on Carol. They get one step, another. She must be badly hurt. Carol wonders if she's bleeding anywhere else, though the damage seems to be mostly internal. \"I gotta destroy it before they get here.\" They get maybe four steps before Lawson drops to the ground, unable to hold herself up. She falls and Carol goes with her, kneeling beside her, one hand gripping Lawson's shoulder. You have to stay with me, she wants to say. Stay with me. But her head is spinning. She can't get her thoughts straight. \"Lawson?\" is all Carol can manage, at first. \"You remember what I said about our work here, what it's for?\" Lawson rasps. \"To end wars?\" Her breaths are coming shorter now. She clutches weakly at Carol's shoulder. \"Yeah, but the wars are bigger than you know.\" Lawson grimaces, her face scrunched up in pain. \"Ah—dammit. My name is not Lawson. My real name is Mar-Vell, and I come from a planet called Hala.\" Carol huffs out a quiet laugh. That actually kind of makes sense, and it's definitely not the strangest thing to happen today either. Somehow, it doesn't matter. Carol still trusts Lawson—or Mar-Vell. She trusts her. She knows her, and has for years now, and that hasn't changed. But there's still so much Carol wants to ask. There's so much she wants to know. Is Hala anything like Earth, she distantly wonders. Are your people like us? \"I would say that you're delusional, but we just got shot down by a spaceship,\" she replies, wryly. \"And your blood is blue.\" Lawson's laugh is short and pained. Her fingers dig firmly into Carol's arms. \"Listen, I spent half my life fighting a shameful war. Now skedaddle before you give me any more regrets. Just remember the coordinates, ok? You gotta save 'em without me.\" \"Save who, how?\" Carol asks. \"Now I gotta blow this engine,\" She reaches inside her jacket and pulls out a weapon. The gun is sleek and modern, the design unlike anything Carol has ever seen. \"Before they find it.\" \"What are you doing?\" Lawson pushes herself up, aims the pistol at the engine, and— It happens too quickly. A heartbeat, a breath. The blast comes from somewhere in the ruins, and hits Lawson in the chest. It happens too quickly. A shot to the heart. Carol doesn't think, she acts. The gun is in her hand within seconds. Carol whips around, weapon raised and ready to shoot. Her breath picks up. For a long moment, there's nothing but smoke and ash, and Lawson dead on the ground beside her. And then she sees him. She is kneeling in the sand, when he appears. A shadow of black smoke passes over his face, and then he's there, walking toward her. His weapon is lowered. Carol keeps hers aimed on him, a wave of white-hot anger surging through her. You killed her, she thinks, you did this you shot us down. Her entire world is narrowed down to him now. Carol stares as he makes his way closer. Her finger twitches over the trigger. She could do it, could end this right now before he has a chance to. Before he shoots her first. She's never killed a man, but something tells her she could do it. Something tells her isn't just a man; he's more than that, he's worse than that. Carol keeps her aim steady. \"We have no interest in hurting you.\" He isn't alone, she realizes. Of course he isn't. We , he'd said. Carol's eyes stay trained on his face. She wonders how many soldiers are out there. And they have to be soldiers; the uniform, the weapon in his hand, the ship. There's no other explanation. He is a soldier, of that much Carol is certain. And he's not alone. So the odds are stacked against her. So she's outnumbered. It won't be the first time. \"No?\" Carol gets to her feet. Her voice rises louder, louder. \"'Cause all the shooting kinda gave me the wrong impression.\" He slows to a halt. For the first time, Carol is able to get a look at him. Is this who Lawson was so afraid of? The man with the pistol. He chased their plane through the stars and clouds, and shot them out of the sky. Carol stares at him and he stares right back. She doesn't recognize the greens and blacks of his uniform, or the pointed emblem in the center. \"The energy core,\" he says. \"Where is it?\" \"Pararescue's on the way. You have two minutes until you're surrounded.\" A beat passes, like he's considering her. \"Then I see no reason to prolong this conversation,\" his pistol is lifted, pointed at her. \"No, wait!\" It distracts him, for a moment. A heartbeat. Really, that's all she needs. The man lowers his gun slightly, intrigued. It's not enough time, she'll be dead in two minutes. Once he gets what he wants, once he realizes the energy core is right there, he'll shoot her. All that matters now is Lawson and what she died trying to do. Still, Carol isn't sure what she's going to do until she's already in the middle of doing it. Which is how most of her plans go, a mix of impulse and instinct. She can't let him have it. She has to finish what Lawson started. Carol nods at the wreckage, at the glowing blue engine half buried in the sand. \"You mean that energy core?\" She takes aim and fires. A burst of electric-blue light ripples through the air, blasting her backward. It shoots through her, white-hot and blazing, exploding behind her eyes with a blinding whiteness. The world flares emerald and then it's gone. There's sun on her face. At least, she thinks it's sunlight. Vers. She drifts. It's warm here, and she feels impossibly light, like she's floating. There's a voice. She hears echoes of it, faraway and muted. The words are too quiet, they slip through her fingers. It's warm here, and although she is distantly aware of pain, nothing hurts. It's just sort of there. A dull ache behind her eyes. A twinge of discomfort below her ribs. She drifts. It starts to feel a little like sinking. She wakes—it's a slow return to consciousness. She wakes, tired and aching. The sunlight is soft on her face, but it isn't warm like it was before. It takes a long moment for her to realize that something feels wrong. She doesn't remember why her head hurts. Or how she got here, wherever here is. She doesn't even remember falling asleep. It's a slow return. Vers. There's something tugging at her brain. She turns her head toward it, chasing the voice. It fades, and fades. Then everything goes silent. She fights through the thick haze clouding her mind. As the fog begins to clear, cracks of light start slipping through. Slowly, her eyes flutter open. And everything is white. She blinks, adjusting to the sudden intrusion. It's not sunlight, she realizes. Vers? It's not sunlight. The room she wakes in is dimly lit, and there aren't any windows. Oh. She blinks up at the concrete ceiling, and the glowing white panels above her. It isn't that dark, but the absence of real light makes it feel colder. Nothing about the room is even a little familiar. When she turns her head, she sees him. The man at her bedside. He's dressed in black and green, and his eyes — She wakes to golden eyes, and a man sitting at her bedside. \"Vers,\" he says, a half-sigh. He sounds relieved. She doesn't know what that word means, but it's not the first time she's heard it. Golden eyes stare back at her, with something like concern in them. He looks worried, but she doesn't know why he would be, since they don't know each other. He has kind eyes, she thinks. And his voice is strangely comforting. She thinks that might've been the voice she heard echoes of, in the darkness. But she isn't sure yet. Her thoughts are scattered, and she's drowsy, it feels like it's talking all her strength just to keep her eyes open. The last thing that she clearly remembers is this moment right now. And waking. Sun on her face, and a voice in her ears. Before that, there's nothing. When she tries to chase her last thread of thought, she comes up empty-handed. There's nothing, only pitch-black darkness that stretches on and on. She looks at him, and his mouth is moving. It takes her a long moment to realize he's talking to her. There's no one else here, it's just the two of them; her in a bed, and him in the chair beside her. She moves to sit, pushing herself upright. \"Good. You're awake.\" he says. His voice is gentle, as if he's trying not to startle her. \"I was beginning to wonder when you'd come back to us.\" She opens her mouth. No words come out. \"Vers? Vers, can you hear me?\" \"Where am I?\" \"A medical bay on Hala. It appears you were caught in the crossfire of a Skrull attack.\" Which doesn't really explain anything. She frowns, somehow more confused than she was a moment ago. There aren't just gaps in her memory missing, all of it is gone. The man says something. The man with golden eyes. She doesn't hear him, the blood rushing so loudly in her ears that she can't make out the words. It doesn't matter. A feeling like panic crawls into her throat, and she can't breathe, can't force air down into her lungs. It's all so unfamiliar, this place, those words, him. Hala, Skrull, Vers. Tears sting her eyes. She angrily blinks them away, wiping roughly at her cheeks when some spill over. A hot spike of anger flares up inside of her, and her hands start to shake. \"I don't know what any of that means.\" \"Easy,\" he says. He must hear it, the panic edging into her voice. \"You're safe now.\" \"Shouldn't I remember?\" Her name or his. The attack. Something, anything . But it isn't coming back. She wonders, not for the first time, if she's dreaming. If she made this whole thing up in her head, including him. Maybe she did dream it up; the words and the place, the eyes gold like sunlight. And maybe she'll wake any moment now, and it'll all be over. It has to be a dream. She knows, though, that it isn't. Her hands are shaking even worse now. She balls them into fists, her knuckles bone-white. But the shaking doesn't stop. He must notice it. \"Easy, Vers.\" he says, a little firmer this time. Then he gently takes her hand in his and holds it. \"You're on Hala now, you're safe.\" A medical bay on Hala, were his exact words. The bed is unfamiliar. So is the room. So is he. She doesn't like it, this feeling of not knowing. It makes her feel weak. There's something about the warmth of his hand wrapped around hers that anchors her, and makes her feel less alone. His thumb brushes over her pulse, soothing her frayed nerves. He sits and holds her hand until the shaking stops. And even after it stops, he holds on a little longer. He's watching her closely now, as if he's searching her face for something. The frustration she feels is still there, she can feel it twisting sharp inside her, but some of the anger drains from her body. She exhales a shaky breath, feels it rattle her chest on the way out. \"Am I?\" she asks, her voice barely audible. \"Are you what, Vers?\" \"Safe.\" He tilts his head at her. \"Of course you are.\" And she believes him. Her hand in his. Is this what safe feels like? She thinks it has to be. Her ragged breathing evens out. The grip on her hand tightens, squeezing, as if to reassure her. He uncurls her fingers from a fist, slowly, and then he lets go. She finds that she already misses it, her hand wrapped up in his, the warmth of it. The way it had been firm and gentle and steady all at once. His touch tethered her. Without it, her skin already feels so much colder, and she is adrift. \"Good. Just breathe, Vers.\" \"You keep calling me that, but I don't—I don't know what that is. I don't know who you are. Why can't I remember anything?\" \"There was a Skrull attack,\" he says it with a quiet intensity, anger creeping into his voice. \"You were near dead, when we found you. I wasn't sure you'd survive the journey back to Hala, but you did.\" \"You found me?\" she asks. \"Yes.\" His eyes flicker over to her other arm. She follows after his gaze, curious. There's a needle in her left arm, a thin tube attached to it, filling her veins with a dark blue liquid. It's a blood transfusion, her mind supplies. There's some sort of cap on the end of the tube; it's black and round, with a green hexagon in the middle. But it can't be a transfusion. Blood isn't blue. Is it? Something about that color feels wrong, though she isn't sure why. She stares down at her arm, then at the clear plastic tube and the hanging drip bag connected to it. She stares as blue blood flows into her veins. \"What're you putting into me?\" \"You were dying,\" He isn't looking at her. His gaze is still fixed on her arm. \"You needed blood.\" \"Was it always like that,\" she asks. \"Blue?\" \"Kree blood is always blue.\" \"Kree blood,\" she echoes. She touches the inside of her arm, carefully tracing the skin around the tube; it's smooth and unscarred, and her. \"Is that what I am? Kree?\" \"Yes.\" She almost hopes he'll reach for her hand again. (He doesn't.) \"I almost died, but you found me.\" she says, and it takes twice as long to get the words out, they catch painfully in her throat. \"You helped me. You brought me here.\" to Hala, her mind supplies. He stays silent. \"Thank you. For all of it. For everything.\" \"It's what any Kree would do.\" You were dying. You were near dead. It rattles her, knowing she was half-dead when he found her. She has too many question. There's so much she wants to know, has to know. Was anyone else injured? Was he? He doesn't appear to be hurt, though he could be nursing hidden wounds beneath his clothing. The medical bay is empty, and the only noise is the low hum of energy coming from nearby machines. A soft mechanical whirring. It's soothing, in a way. Constant. She glances around the dimly lit room, and for the first time notices the row of beds lined up next to hers. She counts them. There are eight beds, on her right. Two on her left. And all of them are vacant. His voice startles her from her thoughts. \"Is any of it coming back to you?\" \"No,\" she says. \"It's all...blank. What happened to me? Why can't I remember anything, not even my own name? I can't—it's gone. Why is it gone?\" He leans forward slightly, his gaze even. \"We don't know the full extent of it. The memory loss. Or the severity of it.\" he tells her. There's a softer, almost sympathetic, edge to his words. \"But the damage is there. We don't know how long it will last.\" \"Memory loss.\" she flatly repeats. Her chest feels hollow. \"But it'll come back, won't it?\" \"It could take weeks, maybe years, for it to come back.\" he says, and she still hears it, the unspoken or not at all. \"The medical officer assured me—\" She doesn't hear the end of that sentence. Her ears are ringing. A thought occurs to her, and it suddenly becomes much harder to breathe. What if it never comes back? \"But I don't even know what a Skrull is,\" she says, swallows against the dryness. Her throat feels raw from disuse. \"Why would it attack me?\" Memory loss, from being caught in the crossfire of a Skrull attack. There's a bitter taste in her mouth, when she thinks about it. A tightness in her chest. Her brain isn't working fast enough to process even half of this. She looks at him, really looks at him. The man sitting at her bedside. And it scares her, how much she trusts him. How much she needs to trust him. \"There's a lot you don't remember.\" \"So tell me.\" His expression shifts, and his eyes soften. All traces of pity have vanished from his face. \"Not now, Vers. In time, I will. I'll tell you everything.\" he says, and rises from the chair. \"For now, rest.\" \"But I have to—\" \"We'll get you back on your feet soon enough. But first, you need to rest. Then we'll talk.\" Her eyelids feel heavier, so she nods. Rest. She can do that. Although she isn't in any pain, there's still a dull ache lingering in her bones. Rest might help with that, she tells herself. If she sleeps, she might dream. Which means she might remember, even if it's just a fragment of a memory, and that would be enough for now. \"Okay.\" she says. \"I'll be back in the morning. Sleep, Vers.\" He's gone, after that. It's only when the door hisses shut behind him that she realizes she didn't get his name. She'll ask him for it in the morning. \"Vers.\" she says, testing the word. She likes the way it sounds, even if it's unfamiliar. It might not be much, but she's reclaimed this tiny piece of herself, of her past, and she wants to hold onto it tightly. She doesn't want to forget. So she says her name, over and over, into the stillness and quiet of the room. \"Vers. Vers. Veeers.\" Sleep doesn't come easily. She sits in the silence of the medical bay for what feels like a very long time, then she settles back on the bed and stares up at the ceiling. She drifts off slowly, quietly anxious about what awaits her. The last thing to flash through her mind is a glimpse of warm yellow light, like sunbeams slipping through the cracks in her fingers. Waking isn't so bad, the second time around. It doesn't hurt. She blinks past the disorientation. Vers forces her eyes open and the familiar concrete ceiling comes into focus. Good. At least that hasn't changed. Her eyes dart around the room. It's cold and sterile, but she's grown used to being here. A shaky breath passes her lips. Her entire past is lost, as if it never happened. Maybe she'll get pieces of it back, in time. Or maybe she won't. The uncertainty is what bothers her the most, she can feel it like an itch under her skin. A part of her had hoped for answers in her dreams, but she saw nothing. The pitch-black darkness of a dreamless sleep leaves her feeling numb. Waking isn't so bad. It's the thoughts and doubts that come after that are. She reaches for the closest memories; the echoes of a voice, sunlight warm on her face, blue blood in her veins. She remembers watching as dark liquid was pumped into her. That was real. So is this. She remembers this. The way her name sounded when he first said it, and the feeling of his hand wrapped around hers. The memories soothe her, even if it's only for a moment, before the feeling is swallowed up by something else. She counts each inhale and exhale. Just breathe, Vers. One, two. Something inside of her shifts. A long breath in, then one out. Another breath in. It helps ease the pressure building in her chest. There are familiar things all around her, so she focuses on them. The soft hum of nearby machines. The row of vacant beds. The strips of white light. The room is exactly as it was before, and Vers finds comfort in that. But there is one difference. Her eyes slide and she notices someone standing over her. A woman with blue skin. She's new. The woman's face is unfamiliar, but all faces will be now, Vers thinks. Her coat is black and gray, stripes of emerald green running from her shoulders to where the coat flares out at the wrist. Dark hair is pulled back off her face in an intricate braid. Vers stares and wonders, is my skin blue? What color is my hair? Are my eyes golden, like his? Vers stays very still. The woman is using some sort of device that is attached to her left arm. Beams of orange light sweep over Vers' skin. The needle is gone from her arm, she realizes, touching the spot where it had been. There's nothing there, no mark or bruise. She doesn't know why she thought there would be. Vers pushes herself up onto her elbows with surprising ease, and watches as orange light continues to sweep over her body. \"Welcome back, Vers.\" the woman says. It's good to be back, she almost replies. The words won't form. Her mouth is suddenly dry, her throat parched as if she hasn't had a single drop of water in days. She swallows against the dryness, but that doesn't really help. Vers eases herself into a more upright position. A glint of silver catches her eye; there's a small star pinned to the woman's coat. \"Are you scanning me?\" she asks instead. \"I assure you it's routine procedure.\" \"Who are you?\" \"Medical Officer Ava-Lynn.\" \"Oh. Hi.\" \"How are you feeling?\" Vers considers that. She isn't tired or sore or even hungry. She isn't anything. It doesn't hurt, not like it did the last time she woke. Nothing aches. She feels lighter, and her mind is clearer. Vers moves to sit up, carefully swinging her legs over the edge of the bed. There's no stiffness in her bones, no dull or distant pain. \"Better, I think.\" \"Good,\" says Ava-Lynn. \"You'll be back on your feet in no time at all.\" Vers holds a hand out in front of her and stretches her fingers. \"So what's the scan for?\" she asks, but what she really wants to know is how bad it is—the damage, the memory loss. She wants to know the truth, and if there's any chance of recovering what was lost. Is there any certainty it will come back to her, the memories of what happened that day? Even if it hurts, she has to know. \"It's procedure.\" Ava-Lynn taps something on her wrist and the light vanishes. She moves and starts typing on a screen above the bed, and Vers has to crane her head to look; a shimmering holographic image appears out of thin air, in the shape of a person. A diagram of a body. There are ribs and bones, and a heart. It takes Vers a moment. ( Everything takes a moment, lately.) \"Wait, is that me?\" \"It is.\" \"Do you know what happened to me?\" Vers asks. \"Your wounds were consistent with blaster fire,\" she explains. \"The blast caused significant damage, and rendered you unconscious. As you were the only survivor of the attack, we can't know with certainty what happened.\" Vers bites the inside of her cheek, hard enough that she can taste blood in her mouth. The only survivor. He didn't mention that part. The man who sat with her and held her hand until it stopped shaking. The man who found her, and saved her life. She can still hear the quiet echo of his voice rippling through her mind. She looks away. Her throat is now impossibly tight, and her breaths are coming sharper, shorter. They did this to me, she thinks. The Skrulls. They left no one alive. They did this. She feels a sudden stab of hatred toward them. \"You can help me get it back, can't you?\" Vers asks. \"The trauma you suffered was severe. Whether the damage was irreversible or not remains to be seen, and we will only know with time.\" It's not like she expected anything else, really. She tries not to be too disappointed by that answer, but the weight of it sits uneasily in her stomach; like a stone, sinking, sinking. For now, her past is lost to her, sealed off somewhere in a dark corner of her mind that she can't reach. \"Can you tell me your earliest memory?\" \"A blood transfusion.\" Vers says. It's a half-truth. She remembers other things. Sunlight warm on her face. A voice. Glimpses of this room, barely visible through the cracks in her eyelids. But none of that really counts. Her clearest memory is of blue blood running through her veins, and golden eyes staring back at her. A tube in her arm and the man at her bedside. Everything else before that is fuzzy. The holograph disappears. Ava-Lynn turns to Vers with something sympathetic in her eyes. Her voice, however, remains even and clinical. \"I would like to keep you in for further observation, just for another day or so. Then you'll be free to leave.\" Vers can only nod absently, her mind elsewhere. She wonders if it's morning yet. \"There are more tests I'd like to run.\" \"Okay.\" \"Rest, for now. I'll be back with you in a moment.\" \"Wait,\" Vers says, her head snapping up. \"Yes?\" \"There was a man here, the first time I woke. And he was sitting right there,\" she says, and her mind drifts to thoughts of kind eyes and warm hands. It stayed with her, the memory of him. She's certain she didn't dream it up. The chair is gone, but she remembers what he looked like, sitting there across from her. \"Do you know who he was?\" \"Commander Yon-Rogg. Your earliest memory, the transfusion? That was his blood.\" \"He gave me blood?\" \"Yes. He insisted on it.\" \"Why?\" Vers asks. Ava-Lynn's voice is stern as she says, \"I'll be back shortly. It's important that you rest, Vers.\" It's his blood, coursing through her veins. The man with eyes like the sun. The one who saved her. His name is Y on-Rogg, she reminds herself. It's his and hers, this blood inside her. Vers doesn't know what she's supposed to do with that information. Why didn't he mention that, when he was sitting right there? She doesn't notice Ava-Lynn leave, too swept up in her own thoughts to realize until a minute later. It's too quiet, Vers thinks. She's alone again, left to sit with her thoughts in the stillness of the medical bay. She wonders if it's morning yet. If he'll be back to see her soon. There's no way of telling if it's day or night, since there aren't any windows or clocks. She might not remember her past, but at least she can still recognize things and give them names. She knows what clocks and windows and ribs and blood transfusions are. And that isn't much, she knows, but it's something. Vers waits and waits, and wonders if it's morning. She waits. (It takes thirty minutes for her to move.) Minutes tick by, but it starts to feel like hours, and Vers can feel her patience waning. She's itching for a glimpse of whatever is outside these walls. Hala, he'd called it. She wonders what it looks like. She wonders if it's beautiful. Vers climbs off the bed and takes a small step forward. She feels off-balance, at first. The floor is cold and hard beneath her feet. She takes one step forward, then another. After that, she starts to explore. The room is larger than she initially thought, so Vers walks every inch of it, counting how many steps it takes to get from one side to the other. There are more beds in here than she thought, too, just over a dozen. It seems so empty and bare, the furnishings stripped down to only the essentials. She doesn't mind. When she reaches the far wall, she walks slowly alongside it, running a hand over the smooth concrete. Vers gets halfway to the door before taking a step back. She tilts her head at the large black symbol painted above the doorway. It's meaningless to her, she doesn't recognize the shape of it. Vers tries not to be too disappointed by that, but she is. She really shouldn't go any further, she knows. And yet, there's something urgent tugging at her, telling her she has to. A part of her that won't be satisfied sitting for another half hour in the stifling quiet of the medical bay. It's too still now, there's too much time to think. She shouldn't go any further. And yet. A/N: I've been writing this on and off since my third viewing and I'm still blown away by how incredible this movie is. I am obsessed with these two and their dynamic and I have very few regrets. (I have 0 regrets. I said what I said.) Big thank you to redromanova for both enabling and supporting me, I'd be lost without you! x 1. This story will cover Carol and Yon-Rogg's relationship before, during, and after the events of CM. 2. Strictly Carol/Vers POV. 3. There's very little background on Yon-Rogg, and there's even less about Hala, Starforce, and the Kree, so just bear with me as I make up 97% of everything. 4.

They crash-land by the lake,"},{"Movie":"Captain Marvel","Title":"Captain Marvel: Through the Visor's Eye","Author":"Hawki","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13243072","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Through the Visor's Eye This is still a terrible idea. It wasn't as if anyone on this damn planet cared what she thought. Being a member of Starforce apparently only afforded you so many privileges. Yes, she was one of the heroes of the Empire. She had killed dozens of skrulls, and had never shied from putting xandarians in their place. She had made shots deemed impossible by her fellow soldiers. She had never once wavered in her duty. She'd got more stars on her uniform than there were in the skies above Hala. She was, to put it bluntly, among the best of the best. And right now, that counted for nothing. Right now, she was standing above the training grounds, watching \"Vers\" struggle against lobotomized chitauri on an obstacle course. Apparently the goal was to make it to the end alive, and do so while keeping her powers under control. As far as the latter objective once, Vers was doing quite well (though how much that could be attributed to willpower as opposed to incompetence, Minn-Erva wasn't sure). As far as the former objective went, she was doing quite poorly. Poor thing. She fingered the trigger of her carbine. I could just put you out of your misery. She frowned. Out of my misery too for that matter. She winced as she saw one of the aliens swipe at \"Vers,\" drawing green blood. Minn-Erva winced – not so much at the wound, but at the sight of the liquid dribbling from her arm. She knew that the woman's natural blood was red. The universe appeared to favour a kreenoid form, which was why so many species defaulted to the phenotype of two legs, two arms, two eyes. That was constant, even if the colour of the blood wasn't. So \"Vers\" may look kree. Thanks to some mind tricks, she even thought she was kree. But she wasn't kree, and no amount of green blood would change that. She would, as far as Minn-Erva was concerned, forever be an abomination. The Empire distanced itself from lesser species, and now, one of the lowest of the low was wearing the uniform of Starforce. Even as \"Vers\" sent dual energy blasts into one of the attacking chitauri, Minn-Erva remained unmoved. Starforce was playing with fire. It had never played with fire before. Fire was directed to species like skrulls and xandarians. Fire was kept at bay, and utilized properly, not put into the hands of a child. The door to the observation room hissed open. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw who it was and stifled a groan. She'd spoken her part before. Her words had been \"duly noted,\" which experience had taught her was code for \"don't give a shit.\" Until a month ago, she'd trusted Yon-Rogg with her life. Now, that trust didn't even extend as far as she could throw him. \"Minn-Erva.\" \"Sir.\" Which wasn't that far. She was good with her carbine. Physical strength had never been her forte. \"How's our recruit doing?\" Recruit? More like conscript. \"See for yourself.\" He walked over to the plexiglass and smirked as \"Vers\" ducked under a chitauri's scythe, then blasted it in the stomach. \"Better than I thought she would then.\" \"Oh that's so nice to know. Here was me thinking that she'd actually be struggling.\" \"Neither of those things aren't mutually exclusive,\" Yon-Rogg said. \"Still, better that she struggle now than later. Better that she has the sense of earning her power without being aware that she carries powers she can scarce dream of.\" \"Yes, I've heard about the dreams,\" Minn-Erva said. \"How's that going?\" \"So far so good.\" \"What happens when that changes?\" She turned to face her commander. \"What happens when we go as far as we can with this little game?\" \"Excuse me?\" \"What happens when your new pet-\" \"Stop,\" said Yon-Rogg. Minn-Erva did so. \"Choose your next words very carefully,\" he said. \"You'll let me speak?\" \"I will. What you say, and how you say it, will determine a great deal.\" Of course it will. Minn-Erva took a breath. She knew it was fruitless. Yon-Rogg was her superior, and at least claimed to have the blessing of the Great Intelligence in this little experiment. Yet she had to speak. If she met her doom at the hands of a Terran, then she wanted to die in the knowledge that she'd spoken her piece. \"I think this is a terrible idea,\" she said. Yon-Rogg crossed his arms and smirked. \"Does that amuse you?\" she asked. \"Oh, it's only that you've told me, I don't know, ten times already. Only three of which were after I gave you permission to speak freely.\" \"I'd have thought that after my years of service in Starforce-\" \"Those years of service are the only reason I'm engaging in this little game,\" Yon-Rogg said. \"So go on. Tell me why it's a terrible idea. Give me a reason compelling enough to take to the Great Intelligence.\" \"It's dangerous,\" Minn-Erva said. \"Everything we do is dangerous.\" \"The power that… Vers , contains (just saying the word made her feel ill) can go in one of two ways.\" She nodded to the woman down below, firing more energy blasts at the chitauri. Her training clothes were torn in a dozen places, her body bruised and bloody. \"Option one is that it remains too weak for us to do anything with it. It means that every mission we go on, we'll be taking a child with us.\" Yon-Rogg, not giving anything away, asked \"and the other option?\" \"The other option is that the child down there has a temper tantrum and causes us all to die screaming.\" She frowned. \"Yes, I've read the reports. I've seen the projections. We might as well have a one woman army down there.\" \"That's a worst case scenario. Or best, if we point her in the right direction.\" Minn-Erva held up her rifle. \"What is this?\" \"Is this a trick question?\" \"It's a pulse carbine,\" she said. \"The Mk. V Terrazed-\" \"I know its designation Minn-Erva.\" \"And then you know it's reserved only for the most accomplished of snipers,\" she said. \"I'm not doubting your skill.\" \"I'm glad. But tell me – have you ever doubted I would point it in the right direction?\" Yon-Rogg said nothing. \"Do we afford that privilege to any weapon within the empire? Do we usually take the chance that a weapon might turn on us?\" She gestured down towards \"Vers,\" who was nearly at the end of the course, even if she was stumbling to make it. \"Do we accept anything less than the best of the best for Starforce?\" \"No.\" \"No?\" Minn-Erva watched as her commander put a hand to his chin. Was it possible? Might he see the wisdom in this? The insanity in his plan. \"No,\" he repeated. \"We don't.\" \"Then you-\" \"Which is why we'll keep training Vers until she's at the level right for us. Powerful enough to give the skrulls and xandarians terror. Not so powerful that she gives fear to any kree.\" He nodded at Minn-Erva. \"Are you suggesting I'm afraid?\" \"Not at all,\" he said, smirking. \"Well, maybe.\" She gripped the carbine tighter. \"I mean, it must be disconcerting, to finally have a rival.\" You son of a bitch. He patted her on the shoulder. \"Chin up Minn-Erva. You might find it enjoyable to be the girl's mentor.\" \"Excuse me?\" \"We'll talk later,\" he said. He began to walk out of the observation room, making it clear that the conversation was over. \"And is that how you find it?\" she shot back. \"Enjoyable?\" Just because Yon-Rogg declared the conversation was over, didn't mean it had to be. \"Excuse me?\" he asked, turning round. \"Enjoyable,\" she repeated. \"Your whole little experiment. The reason that your pet isn't buried somewhere on C-53.\" \"You know exactly why I brought her here.\" \"Oh yes, you told me – something about cosmic powers and being a potential weapon. But I can't help but wonder about your other motives?\" \"My what?\" Minn-Erva shrugged nonchalantly. \"I mean, the poor girl still has nightmares, and I imagine she might want comfort. And after all, humans and kree are almost identical physically. No doubt you've had your fun on Hala, but I can't help but wonder if after visiting C-53 you decided that you might want to sample the goods and-\" It happened fast. One moment, she was talking. The next, she was struggling to breathe as Yogg-Ronn grabbed her by the throat with one arm, and knocked her carbine out of her grip with the other. That, and he forced her to her knees, his eyes as wide as hers. \"You remember what we talked about earlier about speaking freely?\" he whispered. Minn-Erva tried to nod, but it was hard – being strangled had that effect on you. \"Well, that ends today. From this day forth, on the subject of Vers, you no longer get to speak freely. It means that you're going to bite your tongue. It means you're going to help Vers with any assistance she requires. It means that when you're on the field, and you're seeing her slaughter the enemies of the Kree Empire, you're going to not say anything, but just stay put and continue to act as a sniper. Because that's what you're good at Minn-Erva. And you can stay good, as long as you remember your place.\" He paused. \"You do know your place don't you Minn-Erva?\" She tried to speak, but only a rasp came out. \"Didn't quite catch that, sorry.\" \"Ye…yes…\" she whispered. He released her as quickly as he'd grabbed her. Both hands free, a smile on his face, and a twinkle in his eye. \"Very good. I'm glad we had this conversation.\" He looked out the window. \"And would you look at that. Vers has completed the training course.\" Good for her. Minn-Erva stumbled to her feet, still gasping for breath. \"Go down and thank her Minn-Erva. It's what good team mates do.\" She stood there, glaring at him. \"I mean, you wouldn't disobey an order from your commanding officer would you?\" Still glaring at him, she nevertheless picked up her rifle and walked past him, heading for the staircase that would take her down to the training area. A thousand words were on the tip of her tongue. But she had to keep silent. For now at least. This is going to end badly Yon-Rogg. She frowned, and quickened her pace down the stairs. This was a mistake. And I hope I'm there when you realize that. Six years later, she got her wish. ","Summary":" Through the Visor's Eye This is still a terrible idea. It wasn't as if anyone on this damn planet c"},{"Movie":"Captain Marvel","Title":"Carol & Yon-Rogg A-Z Drabbles","Author":"Keira-House M.D","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13253978","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: I don't own the Marvel Cinematic Universe or Captain Marvel. This story is the product of the Captain Marvel / Marvel Cinematic Universe's characters and world and my imagination Admiration Yon-Rogg never tells Vers who he sees when he visits the Supreme Intelligence, no matter how much she badgers him about it over the years. He isn't like some of the Kree, who see the Supreme Intelligence with an ever changing face. He isn't fickle like that. And yet, when he stands before the ruler of the Kree Empire, after his failure to subdue the Skrulls and Vers' defection, the new form he sees seems only natural. She wears that mockery of their uniform, and has a stubborn, fierce look in her eyes. Her whole body glows with the full force of her powers. She has abandoned the Kree for the Skrulls and returned him to Hala in disgrace. She has embraced her emotions and wrenched herself from their control. But still … she is magnificent. And he can't help but admire her. Blood Carol isn't fond of close contact fighting anymore. She doesn't like to bleed. Or, rather, she hates to see the colour of her blood. She's come to terms with the fact that she's a Human-Kree hybrid, and using her powers and strength to help others makes her feel like she's atoning a little for those years with Starforce. But when she sees her blood, she remembers the transfusion in her early days on Hala, remembers six years when she felt so proud to have her mentor's blood running through her veins, binding the two of them together. Now it is more of a shackle, an unpleasant memory of a betrayal she never expected. Yon-Rogg is still part of her. He always will be. A reminder that some people are not as easily forgotten as she might wish. Captured Vers doesn't know how long it's been since she was captured. Hours, days, weeks … the drugs they are using to keep her subdued have completely confused her sense of time. She can only vaguely remember being ambushed during the mission, and she has no idea who her captors are. They are clearly well prepared, though, because they've prevented her from using her photon blasts with heavy hand restraints that she thinks she'd struggle to remove even if she wasn't half-unconscious. She hears a pair of voices talking about some sort of memory probe, but she can't focus for long and they soon move out of earshot. This must be the work of the Skrulls, she thinks. Starforce members are highly trained, and very good at spotting a Skrull imposter, but all it takes is one mistake and the whole mission can go sideways. She tries to catalogue her injuries, but discovers to her surprise that she cannot feel any of the effects of recent torture, just a lightheadedness that can be attributed to the cocktail of drugs coursing through her veins and keeping her from attempting an escape. For a few brief moments, she considers trying to come up with an escape plan, but she feels so tired … she just wants to close her eyes … More time passes, but the next time she thinks she's relatively aware, she hears crashes, bangs, shouts and roars outside the cell she's in. And then, suddenly, the door is shoved open. Yon-Rogg looks blindingly furious. She can that see his uniform and face are splattered with Skrull blood, and his golden eyes are burning fiercely. He strides forward and she tries to keep her head from lolling to the side as he begins to remove her restraints. \"Focus, Vers,\" his voice is harsh, but he is surprisingly gentle when trying to get her free. She lifts her head, but it feels so heavy that she can only hold it up for a few seconds at a time. \"At least I know now why there wasn't a trail of unconscious Skrull to lead us to you,\" he mutters, wrapping an arm around her waist to steady her, \"they must have you on about ten different drugs. You're absolutely useless like this.\" \"It's good to see you too, Commander,\" she murmurs, trying to smile but not quite able to summon the energy for it. \"Now is not the time for your terrible attempts at humour, Vers,\" he says as he half-supports, half-drags her towards the door. \"I'm fine … ish,\" she insists, \"just let me get my bearings.\" He sighs, \"I've told you before, Vers, you're not as strong as you think you are. You're still vulnerable.\" \"I am a noble warrior hero,\" she insists, giggling a little. \" You are … oh what is the word those primitive planets use? … stoned.\" He helps her down a number of corridors, where she only vaguely notices the Skrull bodies that are laying still on the floor. \"We are doubling your training once we get back to Hala,\" he warns her, \"if you are going to insist on repeating the stupid action of taking on ten Skrulls alone – and I have no doubt that you will, Vers – then you are going to be properly prepared for it.\" He sounds annoyed, but concerned too, and it strikes Vers that he might have actually been worried about her. The thought makes her smile. He sees her expression, though he doesn't know the reason behind it, \"you won't be smiling when we're back to training, Vers.\" She keeps smiling, though. She knows he cares. Duty Yon-Rogg has always done his duty. As a child he followed the path his father laid out for him. As an adult he serves the Kree as commander of their elite Starforce team, dedicated to the expansion of the Kree Empire and the destruction of the Skrulls. And then he finds her. Brave and brash and stubborn, on the backwater planet Mar-Vell has hidden herself on. After she shoots the core he brings her back to Hala, sparking energy that her feeble body cannot handle. And he remakes her, gives her his blood and an implant to tamp down her powers to a controllable level. His blood connects them, and when the Supreme Intelligence gives him the task of training her, he finds that he … well he likes her. She can be frustrating and overly emotional, aggressive and dismissive of the command structure. But she's clever and determined too, amusing and strong. And sometimes he forgets that this is simply duty, not friendship. At times he wonders if one day she will have to die, and such a thought … it hurts. He cannot allow himself to think like this. His duty is to follow the orders of the Supreme Intelligence and serve the Kree Empire. So when Vers grins at him, Yon-Rogg studiously ignores the fondness he feels for her, and tamps down his desire to smile back. He will always do his duty, no matter what. For the good of all Kree. Emotions Vers turns up at his apartment in the early hours, as she does most nights. But while it is usually a sparring partner she's searching for, on occasion she comes looking for something else entirely. She surges forward as soon as the door is half-open, slanting her lips hungrily across his. One of his hands goes around her waist and the other to the nape of her neck as he pulls her closer. Sex between warriors isn't against the rules, even when those involved are of different ranks. In fact it is considered a useful tool to help them de-stress. What is frowned upon is sex that leads to emotional connections. It isn't appropriate on the battlefield for any warrior to consider saving one member of their team over another for sentimental reasons. That, they are always reminded, is what gets people killed and only serves the enemy's interests. Yon-Rogg knows he shouldn't be doing this, that he should draw a line with Vers and stick solely to training. Because, despite years of managing perfectly well without any emotional attachments, he now finds himself inexplicably, but undeniably, caring about someone. And not just anyone, not even a Kree. No, his emotions have been stirred by a Terran-Kree hybrid with the power of Mar-Vell's core running though her, someone brought to Hala to be moulded into a tool for the purpose of Kree expansion. The sex is good, fantastic even. But it isn't simply stress relief anymore. He finds himself trying not to laugh at her ridiculous jokes, resisting the urge to kiss her, and smiling when she stays the night in his bed. He needs to stop, needs to make sure he isn't led by the emotions that he is always telling Vers she needs to get under control. Vers pulls him towards his bedroom. He doesn't try to stop her, only moves his hands so she can tug her shirt off. She's already here now, and he can't find it in himself to send her away. He just wants one more night. He tells himself this will be the last time. (he knows it won't). Fight The first time Carol sees Yon-Rogg after sending him back to Hala in disgrace, she punches him in the face. Three times. He doesn't block her, perhaps thinking he deserves that much. When she goes to hit him for a fourth time, though, he hits back. Carol hasn't slept in about four days, she's learnt far more than she wants to about the sex-trafficking trade on Contraxia, and she is in no mood to deal with this particular reminder of her past. She is, however, in dire need of a good fight. And in this respect, Yon-Rogg's appearance is perfect timing. Carol knows she could probably take Yon-Rogg down with one blast, but what she really wants is a fight that will give her a really good workout, one that will exhaust her enough that she'll sleep through the night. She remembers his words back on earth, trying to get her to fight him without her powers. Looks like he's finally going to get his wish, decades later. In some ways it's like being back in the training room on Hala. In other ways, not so much. There's something broken between them now. \"It's been a while, Vers,\" he says as they circle each other, \"did you miss me?\" \"It's Carol,\" she reminds him through gritted teeth. She refuses to say anything else. He's always been able to tell when she's lying and he'll be unbearably smug if he realises that, even now, after everything, there is a part of her that has missed him. They get into a rhythm soon enough, a dance of sorts. Punch, kick, duck, turn, flip. Yon-Rogg was very, very good when she was on Hala. He's even better now. But so is she, even without the advantage of her powers. \"You've been practicing,\" he says as she dodges his kick. He looks genuinely proud and she kind of hates that a part of her is pleased by his acknowledgement of how she's improved. She answers flippantly, though, because she doesn't want to show weakness to him, \"well sometimes it gets boring just blasting people and I want a bit of variety.\" His golden eyes twinkle a bit, as if he knows her real thoughts. In response she steps up the pace, determined to beat him. By the time fifteen minutes have passed, they are certainly a little worse for the wear, and both have bloody lips and aching limbs. Carol throws a punch, but Yon-Rogg is moving to block it before her fist gets anywhere near him. \"You're still telegraphing your moves,\" he scolds her. She scowls at him indignantly, having made a conscious effort over the past few years to be less obvious with her hits, \"I am not!\" He smiles then, the expression one that used to make her stomach flutter back on Hala, \"well maybe I'm just good at reading you.\" She growls, mostly because he's right and she absolutely can't stand that. It's been a long time since she's seen him, but they spent six years in close quarters and it's clear he remembers her fighting style, despite how she has tried to improve and amend it over time. She moves with renewed vigour and a desperate desire to knock him over and keep him down. Powers aside, she has to admit he was always a better fighter than her when they were on Hala. They've both gotten stronger over the years, but she thinks they might be more evenly matched now. She's certainly holding her own, at least, and for longer than she ever managed when they sparred together in the training rooms on Hala. When she gets him with an uppercut that he fails to block, she thinks she might be close to winning, but he picks himself back up quickly, wipes some blood away from his mouth and gives her a smile that is all teeth, \"good try, but you'll have to do better than that.\" So she does. At one point she fleetingly wonders what they might look like to anyone who happened to wander over to this deserted field. Probably like two people who seem determined to beat each other to death. The thing is, she doesn't want to kill Yon-Rogg. Seriously maim, yes, but not kill. Which is why, nearly an hour after she threw the first punch, when their energy is seriously flagging and their movements are becoming sluggish, Carol simply drops down onto the ground and sits there. Yon-Rogg eyes her suspiciously, clearly wondering if this is some kind of trap. \"Not giving up, are you?\" he asks. She laughs loudly at him, \"hardly, but it's no fun when we're both this tired. I think we can call it a draw.\" He raises an eyebrow at her, \"I was clearly winning.\" She rolls her eyes, \"you're clearly delusional.\" She gets to her feet and turns to walk to her ship. \"Don't want to wait around for round two?\" he shouts after her. She turns to wink at him, \"oh I'm sure we'll meet again soon enough.\" She pauses and then sends a photon blast towards Yon-Rogg's ship in the distance. \"Sorry,\" she shrugs at his furious expression, \"can't have you following me.\" She hurries away and takes off quickly before he can try to do any damage to her own ship. She can feel all the bruises and aches. They'll fade soon enough, but she thinks she's finally had a really good workout. \"Round two, indeed,\" she murmurs to herself. She looks forward to it. Grounded \"You can't do this!\" Vers protests loudly. He raises an eyebrow, \"I am your commander, Vers. And if I don't think you're fit to be flying right now, then I am perfectly within my rights to ground you until you're ready.\" \"But I can help,\" she protests, \"I'm a fantastic flier.\" \"You are,\" he agrees, \"you have not, however, been doing very well at keeping control of your emotions recently.\" She flushes when she thinks of the training session they finished only a few minutes ago. She'd lost count of how many times she'd hit him with her photon blasts when it reached double digits. \"I won't let it affect my flying,\" she insists. He sighs, tapping her forehead and then her still-glowing fists, \"you need to learn to use your head more, Vers, and to keep control.\" \"How long?\" she growls. \"A few weeks,\" he tells her, \"and then I'll reevaluate.\" She clenches her fists in frustration, but she knows Yon-Rogg won't change his mind. \"We'll up your training, Vers,\" he says, \"I just want you to be the best version of yourself, you know that, don't you?\" She nods. Yon-Rogg has always supported her, and though constant mantra of 'control' often annoys her, she knows he's only trying to help her. \"You can head back to your rooms, Vers,\" he says, even though she knows they're supposed to be training for another hour or so, \"you're not in the right frame of mind to train right now.\" As she heads back towards her room, she grimaces at the thought of being grounded for weeks. She loves flying – it feels right in a way few other things do. Tonight she'll rest, and tomorrow she will put all her focus into training. She wants to be back in the air as soon as possible. Hero They tell her that she's a hero. Planets she helps liberate, those that she saves, the Avengers on Earth who ask her to fight with them. Time and time again they say it. But she never quite believes it. \"And you're a Kree? A race of noble warriors?\" \"Heroes ... noble warrior heroes.\" She thought she was a hero once before, and look how that turned out. \" We're saving the galaxy, Vers.\" That's what Yon-Rogg said to her once. A lie, as it turns out. Just one of many he told her over the years. She's got blood on her hands and a mind full of regrets. They say heroes don't have to be perfect. She knows and understands that, sees heroes across the galaxy who have made mistakes just as she has. She doesn't want to go down that road again, though. To her, being a hero is just a reminder of betrayal, and of Yon-Rogg's deception, which still hurts her even decades later. She's always happy to help, and to fight for those who need it. She thinks, however, that she's done with being a hero. Illness Vers turns up for training looking like she's half-dead. \"I'm fine,\" she mutters, sounding anything but. He is not familiar with Terran biology, nor is he completely sure how illness might be suffered by a Terran-Kree hybrid like Vers. But whatever is wrong with her, he doesn't think she should be out of bed right now. She's swaying slightly, her nose is leaking, her voice is scratchy and there is an unusual flush in her cheeks. \"You look terrible, Vers,\" he says, \"go back to your rooms and stay there.\" He pushes her in training, because he wants her to control her powers, but even he isn't about to force her to partake in sparring when she looks like she's about to fall over. She scowls at him, \"I can still fight.\" He almost laughs, but settles for rolling his eyes instead. Sometimes he admires Vers' stubborn determination. Other times it's just a pain. \"Fine,\" he says, deciding Vers needs a physical demonstration of why it is pointless for her to train right now, \"if you can land a single blow on me in the next ten minutes, then you can stay.\" She manages a decent fighting stance, but when they starting circling each other he can see that she's struggling to keep her balance. He flips her easily less than a minute in and she crashes down onto the mat. Normally, she gets up again in a few seconds, more bent on winning than ever, but now she just lies there, her eyes unfocussed. \"Go to bed, Vers,\" he tells her, \"if you die because you pushed your body too hard then you'll have no one to blame but yourself, and I won't mourn a fool.\" \"You'd miss me,\" she counters. She gives him a weak version of her usual grin, but it makes him smile a little nonetheless. He offers her his hand, and though he knows it annoys her to admit weakness, she takes it and lets him pull her to her feet. \"I'll be here tomorrow,\" she insists, although he imagines she will actually be stuck in her rooms for a few days at least, not least because he doesn't want her to hear her coughing and spluttering her way through their training. He sighs quietly as he watches her walk away. Even with his Kree blood and the powers she received from Mar-Vell's core, Vers is still susceptible to certain viruses that do not affect those of entirely Kree heritage, even if there is little danger of them seriously harming her. Terrans are so fragile after all, and even Kree blood cannot entirely change that. Yon-Rogg knows Vers is a weapon to be used for Kree glory, and this illness should remind him of how superior the Kree are, and how beneath him she is, even with her enhancements. Instead, all it has done is highlight her stubborn determination, a trait he cannot help but admire, however troublesome it is sometimes. A couple of days away from her while she recovers suddenly seems like a piece of luck. A little space and he's sure he can shake this … fondness. (somehow, though, he doesn't think it will be as easy as that). Jealousy Minn-Erva watches Yon-Rogg and Vers with envious eyes. She used to be the rising star, the Starforce favourite. All that changed the day Yon-Rogg stopped her from killing the human who had destroyed the energy-core. Her commander looks at the human with interested eyes, and watches her glowing form with a mix of fascination and curiosity. And it only gets worse when they return to Hala. A transfusion is required, both to save the human's life and to bind her to the Kree Empire. Yon-Rogg offers his blood with only the briefest hesitation, despite the intimate connotations such a thing usually brings. (Minn-Erva herself has needed transfusions five times during her time with Starforce. Her commander has never offered her his own blood). \" She's dangerous,\" Minn-Erva insists, \"we don't know what her powers could do to us.\" Yon-Rogg shakes his head, \"the Supreme Intelligence agrees with my assessment. Vers will be an invaluable asset once she is properly trained, a perfect weapon to use against the Skrulls.\" \" And what if she remembers?\" Minn-Erva would never usually dare to be so argumentative with her commander, but there is so much that could go wrong with this plan. \" The medics say she remembers nothing from her old life,\" he counters, \"and it is not for you to question the will of the Supreme Intelligence, Minn-Erva.\" She steps back and nods contritely, although she is not at all satisfied with how the day has gone. When she stalks off towards her apartment, Yon-Rogg is still staring at the new Human-Kree Hybrid. It has only become worse over the six years that Vers has been on Hala. Yon-Rogg usually spars with her now, and only rarely with Minn-Erva. He dedicates hours every day to try and make Vers control her emotions, a task Minn-Erva feels is rather futile. She doesn't believe Vers has the discipline for Starforce, but her concerns are ignored. It is not that Vers doesn't do her share of subduing the Skrulls … it is that her powers are still so unstable, still prone to putting not only Skrulls, but also the other Starforce members, in danger. She's a loose cannon and Minn-Erva doesn't like it. She also doesn't like all the time Yon-Rogg spends with the blonde hybrid, or how Vers has slipped easily into the role of his favourite (the position Minn-Erva once held) without even really trying. She isn't jealous. She's not . Besides, it will all come to an explosive end eventually, Minn-Erva thinks. One day, Yon-Rogg's little experiment will backfire spectacularly. And then things will be the way they were before Vers came. Minn-Erva can't wait. Karaoke Sometimes, Yon-Rogg thinks that Vers is an exhausting amount of trouble. She's an excellent addition to Starforce, and her powers (once she is fully able to control them) will be a huge asset in fighting the Skrulls. She is loyal and fierce and has a sense of humour even he can appreciate. But she's also quick-tempered, prone to being led by her emotions and irritatingly good at slipping out into the city when she is supposed to stay within their compound. It grates on her, the rules and restrictions they impose, all in the name of her safety. He tries to make her understand that it is for her own good. She isn't familiar with all of their customs yet, and it also wouldn't do for some ignorant Kree or visitor to Hala to ruin all his hard work by causing her to question what he has told her. She isn't always good at listening, though. And when the stress gets to her she has a tendency to disappear into the city for a few hours. Which is why, when he just want to rest after their mission, Yon-Rogg is now scouring all of her favourite bars in search of Vers. Next time she's in the medical wing, he decides, he's getting a tracker implanted into her arm. It will probably do wonders for his stress levels. Yon-Rogg doesn't find her until he reaches the edge of the city, when he peers into the window of a brightly lit bar and spots her dancing around a small stage, a microphone in her hand. He rolls his eyes when he realises what she's doing. He personally thinks karaoke is completely ridiculous, but for some reason Vers seems to find it very amusing. If they ever have any downtime when they visit other planets, she is always drawn to the closest place that allows visitors to abuse the ears of their fellow patrons by massacring tunes that are otherwise only mildly annoying. He steels himself when he enters the bar, ready for the assault on his ears … However, he finds that Vers isn't a bad singer. She is in fact rather good. This is somewhat of a surprise to him as the karaoke performances he has been unfortunate enough to hear previously (thankfully not many) have usually been horrific. Still, though, he has admittedly never heard Vers sing before. His plan had been to drag her back to the Starforce base as soon as possible, but he finds himself settling down at one of the tables near the door instead. She looks … happy. Yon-Rogg isn't a monster. Vers is an asset to be cultivated, but he knows that she will be a more effective one if she isn't miserable. He'll give her a couple of night patrols as punishment, because he can't let her think she's managed to get away with this breach of the rules. All that can wait until tomorrow, however. For now, he's content to let her have her fun. Lies She doesn't properly process it until nearly a week has passed. And then it hits her. The betrayal, the secrets. All the lies. Talos doesn't ask questions when she requests a room on the ship to rest in. She tells him she wants to take a break from flying alongside the ship and, though he looks at her with concerned eyes, he agrees easily. And inside the small, soundproofed room, Carol finally gives voice to her emotions. She screams. She cries. She wants to hit things, but she's worried she'll do serious damage to the ship. Because she had really enjoyed her life on Hala. Her nightmares had made her question things sometimes, but for the most part she was happy. And it turns out that that life was all a lie. A lie concocted by Yon-Rogg and the Supreme Intelligence. The rage she feels towards the Supreme Intelligence is distant in a way, but what she feels towards Yon-Rogg … It burns inside her. She had trusted Yon-Rogg, had looked up to him, and considered him to be her closest friend and ally. It is his lies that truly hurt her. Because now she can't be sure how much of it was real. She likes to think that it wasn't all fake, that the confidences and laughter and camaraderie they shared meant something to him. Perhaps she'll never know the truth. She's not sure she wants to. Memories It's all over. Thanos is defeated and half of the universe has been released from the soul stone. And Carol ... Carol is lying on her grass staring up at the sky, murmuring the names of all the stars. She doesn't know how long she's been out there, when she hears a rustling to her left and turns to see the glint of a metal arm. Bucky Barnes, Captain Rogers had told her. One of those who had been trapped in the stone. He lies down next to her, \"Steve says you've had problems with your memory, sorta like me.\" \"Yes,\" she admits. She doesn't really like talking about her past, but if the bits and pieces she's heard about Barnes are true, then he's experienced a similar thing, worse even. \"I lost most of my life before I managed to get away from Hydra,\" he tells her, \"I'm remembering more now, but I imagine there will always be holes.\" \"Everything was a blank for me when I woke up on Hala,\" she says softly, \"even now I've only got a little bit, flashes of memories. Maria and Monica, my friends ... my family, really ... they've got some of my old stuff, and they tell me stories. It helps, but ...\" \"But it's still just a story, not a memory,\" he finishes, \"yeah, I get that too.\" There is a companionable silence between them for a few minutes, before Barnes speaks tentatively. \"Steve … he said you were a soldier too.\" \"I was in the Air Force when I was human, and then a military unit called Starforce when I was on Hala. We were elite, the best of the best. And … and I thought I was doing the right thing, that I was protecting people. We were supposed to be heroes .\" She knows she sounds bitter, but it's something that gets to her, even now. \"From what everyone's told me, it sounds like you did the best you could with the information you had.\" Carol shrugs, \"perhaps. But I wasn't like you, Barnes. I wasn't tortured or frozen … I made my own choices.\" Barnes scowls at her, \"having your entire memory removed sounds fairly torturous to me, and kinda like brainwashing. They turned you into a weapon, just like they turned me into one.\" She sighs, \"I took their word for it, once I woke up. They told me the Skrulls were evil and I just believed them, without ever wondering if I should get a non-Kree opinion.\" \"Sounds like you simply trusted the wrong people.\" \"Trust,\" she murmurs quietly. She hadn't gotten along with all of the Starforce members, especially Minn-Erva, but she'd always trusted them to have her back. And Yon-Rogg. She had trusted him, more than anyone else. Maybe that's why it hurts so much. \"You made mistakes,\" Barnes tells her, \"we all do. But I think it's pretty obvious that you're a good person.\" She gives him a small, thankful smile. \"You're one too, Barnes – a good person … a great one.\" He doesn't say anything. She can understand why, and can certainly relate to the guilt he feels. She only hopes that one day they can both forgive themselves. Nightmares Her nightmares now are different to the ones she had when she was on Hala. But they are still about the crash. Sometimes Yon-Rogg does not hold his fire, but shoots immediately. The blood that pools around her is red, and she dies completely human while he examines the wreckage in an attempt to find the energy-core. Other times, she stands next to Yon-Rogg, and it is her hand that fires the blast which kills Mar-Vell. Yon-Rogg smiles proudly at her and she rejoices in the blow they have dealt to their Skrull enemies. She dreams a hundred variations on such things. She'd once thought that figuring out the truth about the crash would set her free from the nightmares. It seems, however, that it has only changed them. She can fill her days with gruelling activities, and mock spar with the Skrulls until she is exhausted. Sometimes she can even manage a night or two of dreamless sleep. Eventually, though, the nightmares return. She suspects they always will. Overprotective He has to stay close. It isn't a personal preference, he insists to Minn-Erva, when she complains about the amount of time he spends with their new teammate. It is simply that he needs to keep an eye on Vers, and ensure her loyalty is solely to the Kree. His excuse is a good one, but it isn't the whole story. Because Yon-Rogg is drawn to Vers in a way he never expects. Despite the power of Mar-Vell's core, and his own blood running through her veins, Vers was still born a Terran, inferior to the Kree. Yet it is the human parts of her, which occasionally bleed through despite the memory wipe, that he finds … Interesting, curious … endearing. The sharing of blood is a ritual of significance to the Kree, though he doubts Vers is aware of that. It creates a bond that cannot be broken and isn't entered into lightly. Yon-Rogg had been reluctant to begin with, but he had followed the Supreme Intelligence's orders for the good of the Kree. Now he has … an awareness of sorts. There is a reason why he is always ready to answer his door when Vers comes searching for a sparring partner in the middle of the night. It is no coincidence that he usually ends their training sessions right around the time that her exhaustion makes them unproductive. And it is the bond that exists between them that makes him worry for her when she allows her emotions to rule her and does something foolish. (or so he tells himself … though a part of him wonders if Vers could inspire this feeling in him whether she had his blood or not). Sometimes, when she's angry or frustrated, Vers tells Yon-Rogg that he's controlling. \"I just worry, Vers,\" he insists, his expression carefully calculated but still mostly genuine, \"I don't want you to get hurt because you can't control your powers. I just feel a little … protective of you, considering the way we found you and all the damage the Skrulls caused.\" \"Overprotective, more like,\" she mutters. Still, he can see that, while she is annoyed, she's also a little bit pleased. He's been careful to ensure that he is the one she trusts, and he knows that while she sometimes feels he is stifling, she also enjoys the fact that someone cares enough to want to keep an eye on her. It's all in the name of keeping Vers close. She is their secret weapon after all. That is what he tells the Supreme Intelligence, Minn-Erva and anyone else who questions his closeness with Vers. He won't admit that maybe she's snuck under his skin. That his overprotective behaviour is not simply an act. He won't contemplate the idea that she isn't just a weapon to him, and that it's not only their blood bond that makes him itch to keep her close. Because sometimes he thinks he might truly care . And that's what scares him the most. Proud \" I'm so proud of you. You've come a long way since that day I found you by the lake.\" She's dreamt about hearing those words from Yon-Rogg for so long. But it feels all wrong. It was never supposed to happen this way. She's pictured it a thousand different times. Another successful mission … finally landing a punch on him without using her photon blasts … gaining full control over her powers. Not like this. Standing on the planet she's only just discovered is her home world. Yon-Rogg no longer a mentor, a friend, a lover … but a liar instead. Six years she has spent training with him, learning from him, laughing with him … craving his approval. And it is only now, when her whole world has fallen apart, that he finally tells her that he's proud. Is he being genuine, or is this another trick, a last-ditch attempt to entice her back to the Kree side? They stare silently at each other for a few moments, and Carol tries to read the truth in Yon-Rogg's golden eyes, to determine whether the pride shining there is real. Just a few days ago she would have trusted what she saw there, but now … Now she isn't sure. She doesn't think she'll ever be sure again. Quarantine Vers' first mission with Starforce goes off without a hitch. Her second … not so much. \"Twenty-four hours,\" the doctors tell them from the other side of the glass, \"just to be safe.\" Yon-Rogg's golden eyes are burning with frustration, but Vers refuses to be cowed. It's only one day of quarantine, and it's not her fault. Well, not entirely … So maybe it's 95% her fault. (but the other 5% of the blame definitely lies with Minn-Erva). \"Reckless,\" Yon-Rogg lectures as soon as the doctors have left them alone, \"rash, impulsive, irresponsible, foolish, reckless –\" \"You've said that one already,\" Vers interrupts. He glares and she feels a brief twinge of regret. Yon-Rogg lets her get away with more than most commanders would, but he is always serious about training and missions. \"You've got to control your emotions, Vers,\" he tells her firmly, \"this is what happens when you forget that.\" She flushes pink. She'd tried to stop her fists glowing, but she'd become frustrated during the fight and had accidentally managed to blast open a crate and release what the doctors said was a toxic dust of some sort. The rest of the Starforce team had been far enough away to escape the effects, but Vers had been covered in the dust and Yon-Rogg, who had come over to try and help her, had ended up inhaling enough that the doctors had insisted he be quarantined with her. \"I'm sorry,\" she whispers, \"I just … I get angry and I can't think straight.\" Yon-Rogg's expression softens and he takes her hands, brushing his thumbs over her knuckles, \"these are powerful weapons, Vers, if you can control them. Otherwise, they have the potential to be dangerous liabilities.\" She winces a little at his rebuke, even if it's probably deserved. \"Don't worry, Vers,\" he says, gentler than usual, \"I promised you, remember, they day we brought you back to Hala following the Skrull attack. I'll help you. We'll do this together, so that you can be the best version of yourself.\" She nods, giving him a tentative smile. \"Now,\" he says, tapping her forehead, \"time to use this. We've got plenty of time on our hands and nothing else to do, so I want you to tell me what parts of the mission went wrong and how the errors could have been avoided.\" Vers rattles off her analysis in as much depth as possible, determined to learn from this mission. Just one step on the road to becoming the best version of herself. Rough Almost everything with Yon-Rogg is rough. Training, sex … even most of their conversations are more verbal sparring than anything else. And she doesn't mind that, enjoys it even. But every now and then, she wonders … Vers has no memories of the time before she came to Hala, and no point of reference beyond Yon-Rogg, with whom she spends most of her time. It's true that he isn't a particularly demonstrative sort. Still, she thinks he cares. He puts so much effort into training her, never turns her away when she comes to him following a nightmare, and always gets angry when she puts herself in danger or someone tries to hurt her. She thinks this is normal, to begin with. And she doesn't question it, because Yon-Rogg looks at her with fierce golden eyes and makes her feel special. It is only over time that she starts to realise that there might be other ways to care for someone. He grips her hips so hard that, even with their rapid healing, the bruises won't fade for at least a day. And though she quite likes the mix of pain and pleasure, she also feels the ghost of gentle, tentative touches on her skin. Their lips collide in a bruising kiss, but somehow she almost remembers soft, warm lips against hers. He barks out a frustrated order for her to 'control it' when her fists begin to glow, and she hears the echo of her own laugher mixed in with another woman's. Yon-Rogg is her commander, her mentor, her lover, and the closest thing she has to a friend. She doesn't know what she'd do without his support, his dry comments, his help. She's starting to think, however, that there might be something else out there. Not entirely rough. Gentler. She only wishes she could figure it out. Starforce Vers knows she's the odd one out on the base. She hears what they whisper about her. The soldier with no memory. The trainee being mentored by the commander of Starforce. The one who seems to spend most of her time in the training rooms, attempting (and often failing) to get her photon blasts under control. Everyone is polite to her face. No one wants to offend Yon-Rogg, or question the wisdom of the Supreme Intelligence, whose decision it was to put Vers on the fast-track to membership of the elite Starforce team. But she doesn't fit in, and they give her a wide berth, especially after she accidentally blasts half of the training room roof off when she loses control of her powers. (Yon-Rogg arranges a private room for them to practice in after that incident, much to her relief). She thinks, however, that when she is finally cleared to join Starforce, things might be different. The elite group are made up of an eclectic mix of characters, all with talents that differentiate them from the regular Kree soldiers. Vers hopes that in Starforce she can find someone (other than Yon-Rogg) who isn't scared or nervous around her. And it would be nice to have company on the rare evenings when she's free to visit the city bars. Yon-Rogg joins her sometimes, but part of her feels like she misses female friendship. (She gets flashes sometimes. Dark hair, a wide smile, loud laughter. Yon-Rogg tells her it's an overactive imagination trying to fill in the blanks inn her memory, but she likes to think that maybe something lingered in her mind despite everything the Skrull attack took from her). Vers gets her wish. Partly. None of the members of Starforce seem afraid of her, at least not openly. She can even joke and laugh with some of them, though Minn-Erva seems to rather dislike her, for reasons Vers has not yet worked out. But, despite all that, she doesn't find any close connections among them. They're a team, and they work well together. That's it though. She still trains almost exclusively with Yon-Rogg, still spends her evenings off trying to persuade him to come out with her (\"I won't get into another bar fight,\" she says, \"I promise.\"), still doesn't think of anyone else but him to go to and badger into sparring with her when nightmares stop her sleeping. She has this … yearning. She feels like she wants something more. A family? She thinks she had one once, and for a while she thought that perhaps Starforce could become her family. It was a silly thought. She's a warrior hero, helping to save the universe from Skrull attacks. She's living a life others only dream of. And Yon-Rogg tells her to focus on the present. \"No sense in missing what you can't remember, Vers – it will only distract you.\" He's right, of course. He's always right … But sometimes … sometimes she wonders. Touch She wakes feeling like her skin is on fire. She has no idea where she is, and no clue who she is. There is a flurry of movement as she tries to sit up, only for her aching, exhausted body to fall back against the bed she is lying on. She can hear voices all around her, but she can't focus on any of them long enough to tell what they're saying. And then, suddenly, a hand brushes her arm. Her skin cools, her mind settles. She opens her eyes to see someone sitting next to her, dark haired, with golden eyes that are watching her carefully. He takes one of her hands, his thumb brushing gently over her palm. She feels more normal now, less like she's burning alive. \" Don't try to move yet,\" he tells her, \"you're still weak from the surgery and the transfusion.\" \" What happened? Where … where am I?\" she rasps. He looks at her sympathetically, \"I'm afraid that's rather a long story, and you need your rest. I'll be here when you wake up and I'll explain everything then.\" She nods, her eyes heavy, and within a few minutes she has drifted back to sleep, her hand still entwined with his. Vers tosses and turns in the bed, her skin itching and stopping her from getting comfortable. She is obviously grateful to Yon-Rogg and his team for saving her from the Skrulls, but the side effect of the blood transfusion that had been required to save her life is playing havoc with her sleep schedule. Transfusions are apparently rare among the Kree, since they create a permanent bond, although its effects fade significantly over time. Things are hardest in the first few weeks, when the donee experiences significant discomfort if separated from the donor … discomfort that can be reduced by close proximity but only fully alleviated by physical contact. So Vers, as well as being thrown into a new life with no memories of her old one, has found herself sharing extremely close quarters with Yon-Rogg, who has been given the task of preparing her to join the fight against the Skrulls. She can't remember her past, but she's fairly sure that sharing an apartment and a bed with a stranger isn't generally considered the norm. It isn't bad, though. Yon-Rogg doesn't act like she's a nuisance, and he's very patient when he explains things to her. She thinks she'll enjoy being part of Starforce and helping in the fight against the tyranny of the Skrulls. It's only been a week since the transfusion, though, and every time Yon-Rogg is called away somewhere she can't follow, like a classified briefing, Vers finds herself uncomfortable and counting down the seconds until he returns. Just as she's deciding it might be a good idea to move around a bit, despite how tired she is, she hears the door open and looks up to see Yon-Rogg. \"Sorry, Vers,\" he says apologetically as he takes off his shoes and strips off most of his clothes, \"there was an emergency.\" He climbs into the bed next to her and she immediately feels better, especially when he reaches out and tugs her a little closer. \"Better get some rest,\" he says as she burrows into her pillow, \"we've got an early morning training session and I'm not going easy on you this time.\" She snorts, \"you never go easy on me.\" He pinches her side and she laughs. \"Rest, Vers,\" he repeats, \"now.\" And, with his comforting warmth next to her and his arm around her, Vers sleeps. Undercover Yon-Rogg doesn't enjoy undercover operations. Covert is fine – he's had plenty of practice and training in getting around unseen – but undercover, in his mind, means vulnerability. He's an exemplary soldier and he knows it, but it makes him uneasy to be in a potentially hostile environment with reduced weaponry, and without his multi-purpose, high-tech Starforce suit. Besides, subterfuge is not his preferred method of combat. Usually, as commander, he can delegate such unpleasant tasks. But this situation is a delicate one, and the Supreme Intelligence does not wish to entrust it to anyone outside of Starforce. He and Vers have been chosen as the unlucky duo due to the simple fact that they lack the distinctive blue Kree skin, Vers because of her Terran birth and he because he belongs to the hardier, if minority, group of Kree without blue skin. So now here they are visiting a small village suspected of harbouring Skrull sympathisers. And Vers is driving him crazy. \"You really should look a little happier,\" she says as they stroll through the marketplace, \"we're supposed to be married after all.\" \"Our spies suspect the Skrulls are using this village to store weapons capable of inflicting horrific damage on our people, Vers – it isn't the time to be smiling.\" She rolls her eyes and grabs his hand, \"we are not Starforce right now,\" she whispers, \"we are newly-weds who wanted to escape from the big city and visit a quaint little village. If you blow our cover then we're going to have to start blasting people and this won't be a secret mission anymore.\" He sighs. Loudly. But when he looks back at her, his eyes are warm, his mouth curves with a little smile and his hand tightens around hers. Vers gets a little lost in his expression, just for a few seconds. She knows this is an act … an act she has reminded him that he needs to perform – but she really does like his smile. His mouth twists into a smirk, \"now who's distracted, Vers?\" She elbows him in the side, \"come on, the quicker we get what we came for, the faster we can leave and you can get back to torturing me in training.\" He raises an eyebrow at her joke – he knows how much she loves training – and she only shrugs. \"I bet I can talk someone into giving us information quicker than you,\" she challenges him. He snorts, \"you're good, Vers, but I've been at this a lot longer than you have.\" \"Loser has to take all the winner's night watches for the next month?\" she suggests. They shake on it and walk determinedly towards the nearest store. Vers beats him in the end, by about thirty seconds. He doesn't seem bothered, though, only proud. She teases him about it for all of six hours, until they return to Hala and he completely wipes the floor with her in training. They call the day a draw. Vers They call her Carol now, or Danvers, or Captain Marvel. No one calls her Vers anymore. On occasion, she thinks she hears her Kree name, and she always looks around, wary and worried. Sometimes, even a little bit curious. But she never sees a face she remembers from Hala. It takes a while, getting used to her old name. It feels new to her, and sometimes she has to be called three or four times before she realises someone is talking to her. And when she is asked her name, she often has to stop herself half-way through giving the answer of Vers. Vers is a name that conjures up memories of her life on Hala, of the Kree, of Yon Rogg. It is the name she hears in her dreams, usually spoken by Yon-Rogg in a voice that changes from indulgent to frustrated to amused. It is her time with Starforce - all the things she learnt and the places she saw, all the lives she took and the lies she was told. It is six years of her life that she tries to make peace with. Vers is … bittersweet. She's Carol now. Vers will always live inside her, though. Worried \"What were you thinking?\" Vers winces at the tone of Yon-Rogg's voice, which is low and rough, with a rumbling undertone that always makes her feel nervous. He never shouts when he's truly angry, but his expression tightens and sometimes he speaks in barely a whisper. It doesn't make him any less intimidating. She's not really in the mood for a lecture right now, though. She doesn't even know what she did wrong, really. There were civilians in danger, the rest of the team were preoccupied with some of the Skrulls, and all Vers had done was gone to their rescue. Yes, technically, Yon-Rogg had told her they weren't supposed to split up, and that she shouldn't try to engage the Skrulls alone. But what could she do? They were supposed to be heroes, and heroes rescued people. Besides, it had all worked out in the end. She had dispatched the Skrulls, got the civilians out of danger and lived to tell the tale. There is the small matter of the gaping wound in her stomach, which is leaking blood at a rather alarming rate, and the leg she is fairly sure is broken … but it is nothing the medics can't fix. Clearly, Yon-Rogg disagrees. Because he is looming over her bed in the medical centre looking for all the world like he wants to strangle her. \"Vers!\" he glares at her, \"I repeat – What. Were. You. Thinking?\" \"I was thinking that the civilians needed help.\" Her tone is biting and defensive. She really shouldn't be speaking to her commander like this, but she can't help it. \"You might have died , Vers.\" He looks tired, more so than usual. Tired and irritated and … \"You were worried,\" she says softly. \"I was disappointed you disobeyed orders, Vers.\" His golden eyes are tight, though, and she knows she's right. \"I'm fine,\" she insists, \"I just didn't want the civilians to get hurt. We're heroes, right? And heroes help.\" \"Not by running recklessly into danger without any back-up. We're supposed to be a team, Vers, and I don't want to lose any of my team.\" It's probably the closest she's going to get to an admission, so she doesn't pester him anymore. \"So I guess I'm getting double training sessions for this?\" \"Triple sessions,\" he tells her with a wry smile, \"plus extra patrol shifts. And you're grounded from flying the ships for the next six weeks.\" She goes to protest, but he gives her a stern look and she simply huffs. He stands up to leave, but leans forward to kiss her on the forehead gently before he goes. She feels her skin hum at the contact, a side effect, she thinks, of the blood they share thanks to the transfusion he had given her when she first awoke on Hala. \"I'm glad you're ok, Vers.\" She smiles as he heads out of the door. Yes … he'd definitely been worried. Xandar When Nova Prime contacts Carol about Ronan's campaign to destroy Xandar, she is far enough away that it will take nearly a week to reach the planet. She begins the journey anyway, in the hope that she might reach them in time to do something . In the end, although many lives are lost, Xandar is saved by a group calling themselves the Guardians of the Galaxy, and Ronan is obliterated by the Infinity Stone he had been using in his attempt to commit genocide. Though this new group seem quite unconventional, Carol is glad the universe has more heroes. There is so much injustice across the galaxies, and even someone with Carol's powers can only do so much. She carries on to Xandar because, though the immediate threat is over, she still wants to do what she can to help. Nova Prime welcomes her warmly, accepting her condolences and her apologies for not being close enough to assist. When she invites Carol to sit in on the emergency talks with a Kree delegation, Carol scarcely hesitates before agreeing. She doesn't anticipate that the talks will be too much trouble. The Kree Empire mostly abide by their peace treaty with Xandar's Nova Corps, although she knows the Supreme Intelligence likely sanctions covert missions that seek to weaken Xandar's power. Ronan had hated the treaty, as had certain other Kree fanatics, but it has always been understood that this group represent a generally uncontrollable minority. Carol doesn't see why there should be any real difficulty in renewing the peace – though the death toll from Ronan's attack will merit sanctions, the Kree are powerful enough that even the Nova Corps will tread lightly. Besides, the perpetrator is now dead, and he had been a rogue element anyway, considered controversial even by the Kree. In any event, Carol enters the room for the talks expecting no real surprises. Only to find that of the three Kree who make up the delegation, only two are the unremarkable diplomats she expects. The other is Yon-Rogg. Her fists begin to glow immediately, and it takes considerable effort for her to force the power away. Thankfully, no one else in the room notices. At least, no one but Yon-Rogg. Carol can see him watching her intently, a tiny smile playing on the corner of his mouth. She wants to punch him in the face. \"Welcome, everyone,\" Nova Prime says, distracting Carol momentarily, \"talks will begin shortly, but please do take this time to get to know one another.\" Carol looks around the room, trying to find the best exit. But she's not quick enough. As soon as his two colleagues begin talking quietly, Yon-Rogg is out of his seat and right in front of her, blocking her from making an easy escape. \"I didn't think you were a coward, Vers.\" \"My name is Carol,\" she growls. \"Vers suits you better.\" \"I could blast you into space right now,\" she reminds him. He cocks his head and watches her the same way he used to on Hala, analysing her. \"You wouldn't jeopardise the talks,\" he says, \"you want to see justice done.\" \"Justice would be you rotting in a prison cell.\" He shakes his head at her, \"you should know better. I served the Kree Empire loyally long before I ever found you on C-53. What happened with you was a set-back, but not one I could not recover from.\" She snorts, \"so you're a diplomat now?\" \"Not usually,\" he answers, \"but the Supreme Intelligence thought you might like to see a familiar face. And we still have hope that you'll return to us one day, come back to where you belong.\" She can feel her hands heating up again, the anger coursing through her, \"you'd like that, wouldn't you,\" she snipes back. \"Yes. I would,\" he says simply. Sincerely. She can't help but flush, her anger sapping away quickly. She remembers how hard it was for her to have an argument with Yon-Rogg back on Hala – no matter how riled up she got, he almost always remained perfectly calm, only occasionally letting his frustration bleed through. She had never considered it much, not until she found out the truth about her life on Hala and realised how good he had been at diffusing any of her anger or suspicion. She's not going to let him get the better of her now. She knows what she can do, knows that she can beat him. \"I'll be watching you,\" she says fiercely, \"if this is some trick of the Supreme Intelligence's then I will not hesitate to send you all hurtling back to Hala in a burning ship. \"Well,\" Yon-Rogg muses, cool and collected, \"these talks will certainly be more interesting than I anticipated.\" Carol promises herself she'll push him out of a window later, when there are no witnesses. Yon-Rogg For years, Carol's life on Hala remains mostly a mystery to Maria. Part of that is distance. Carol gives Maria and Monica a rudimentary communication device when she leaves with the Skrulls, but it is a cobbled together mix of earth items and the little bit of Kree tech she has left – like the pager she gives to Fury, it can only send a signal and not a message. It is five years before Carol makes it back to earth, with a bag full of interesting items as presents and the news that she has helped the Skrulls get settled at a distance from the Kree Empire. She's happy to share stories of her travels, but she clams up whenever Maria or Monica mention anything Kree-related. Maria knows not to push, not yet, and she makes sure Monica doesn't either, despite her curiosity. They spend three months together, like the family they used to be before the crash, and everything seems wonderful. Things aren't quite as perfect as they seem – Carol wakes screaming every other night, holds herself tensely whenever they are out in public, and is so on edge sometimes that she ends up getting into six separate bar fights during her visit – but they're still good, and when she goes this time, Carol leaves them with a small, handheld device so that they can send proper messages. There isn't another visit for a long time after that. Countless messages fly back and forth across the universe, but Carol always seem to find herself dragged into another mess, or distracted by those who need her help, just as she's thinking of making the trip back to earth. The communication devices get fancier over time, so at least Carol can see them, can watch Monica grow up and smile proudly the first time Maria's little (or not so little anymore) girl shows off her new NASA ID badge. Maria and Monica change physically and Carol doesn't, though her eyes betray her age. But through it all, no matter how much she grins and laughs, or how many planets or civilisations she offers aid to, Carol's refusal to speak of Hala betrays the conflicted feelings she has about the planet she called home for six years, and about those who lived there. Maria is no fool, however. She knows who Carol's mind usually lingers on. Her friend talks apathetically about most of her Starforce team, and frowns when speaking of the one called Minn-Erva, with whom Maria gathers Carol shared some animosity. But the name of her old commander never passes Carol's lips. Not once. Maria can only guess at what passed between the two during Carol's time on Hala. It is clear, however, that Yon-Rogg was the foremost influence on her for those six years, and one not easily forgotten. Maria worries. Carol is strong, both physically and mentally but, as far as Maria can gather, she trusted Yon-Rogg more than anyone else, and the revelation of all his lies must have been hard for her to bear. But Maria is wary of forcing any confidences and so she keeps quiet, hoping that eventually Carol will talk to her. It is only after Thanos is defeated, nearly a quarter of a century after she left Hala, that Carol finally brings up Yon-Rogg of her own accord with Maria. The Avengers compound is overflowing, and so Maria, Monica and Carol are all sharing a room. Monica is asleep on a mattress on the floor, while Maria and Carol talk quietly, neither able to sleep just yet. \"He was alive,\" Carol says suddenly, during a lull in their conversation. Maria looks at her quizzically, \"what do you mean?\" \"Yon-Rogg,\" Carol almost whispers his name, \"when Thanos wiped out half the population. You were gone, and Monica, Fury and Talos … and yet he remained. I checked on my way back to earth – I keep tabs on him, just to be safe – and he was fine.\" \"You got us back, though,\" Maria reminds her, \"helped save the universe.\" \"But if I hadn't,\" Carol says, \"if we hadn't fixed it … he would have been the only one left who knew me … really, truly knew me.\" Maria makes a face and Carol gives her a small, sad smile, \"he does know me, however much I might dislike it. And I can't hate him, not completely. What he did was terrible, but he is a product of his environment, devoted to the glory of the Kree above all else. And however much he used me, I think … I know, that part of him cared for me.\" Maria can't help but protest, \"you should be kicking his ass, not forgiving him.\" Carol laughs a little at Maria's indignant look and squeezes her hand reassuringly, \"I haven't forgiven him, not yet. I will, though, eventually. Still, I won't forget, and the tables have turned – I can launch him into space with one blast and he knows it. But he taught me a lot on Hala, and there's more I could learn from him, in time.\" Maria frowns, \"what he did to you … it was wrong on so many levels.\" \"I know,\" Carol admits, \"and I think a part of him knows it too. He just justifies it as being for the good of all Kree. I'll make him understand, though, eventually.\" Maria can't help but grin a little at the stubborn determination on her friend's face. She hates Yon-Rogg for what he did to Carol, but right now she can't help but feel a little bit of pity for him. Because she thinks Carol's going to make him see the error of his ways, whether he wants that or not. Zeal They get called zealots once. It's during a mission, about four years after her arrival on Hala. The accusation is hurled at them by some Skrull sympathisers on a border planet following a skirmish. She's terribly offended by it. To her, a zealot is someone like Ronan – they might be on the same side but he is rigidly uncompromising and extreme in a way the majority of the Kree are not. Ronan skirts the terrorist line, but Starforce are heroes – enthusiastic, of course, but not dangerously fanatical like the Accusers. Yon-Rogg shows no reaction. Of course, he is better at controlling his emotions than she is, but she wonders why he isn't more affected by their benevolent intentions being so misunderstood. \"They were acting as though we were Ronan ,\" she rants as they head back to their ship. Ronan has a history of civilian casualties, a disregard for the lives of foot soldiers and a taste for violence. Yon-Rogg, on the other hand, always tries to ensure civilians are kept safely away from any conflicts, has risked his own neck half a dozen times to save Vers, and abhors Ronan's more destructive tendencies. \"Not everyone knows what is right for them,\" Yon-Rogg reminds her, \"they must be guided to realise that we only have the best of intentions, and that we simply seek a unified and peaceful empire free of Skrull treachery. Perhaps we are zealots – devoted to our cause and diligent in our pursuit of it – but why should that be a bad thing, Vers?\" Years later, when she's far away from the Kree, Carol winces at the thought of how black and white her world view had been then. Nevertheless, while Yon-Rogg lied to her about many things, she thinks he may have been right when he said being a zealot was not always bad, despite the negative connotations associated with the word. Being devoted to a cause and determined in working towards your goal is a positive thing … As long as what you are working towards is good. And therein lies the problem. The Kree see themselves as altruistic leaders, utterly convinced that they are acting 'for the good of all Kree'. And yet, to so many others, they are a militaristic race who will stop at nothing to control the galaxy. Even Carol herself, only ever trying to help, sometimes finds herself accused of interfering when it isn't wanted, or of trying to impose a peace where none is desired. Good is relative after all. Carol is never going to stop being zealous in her endeavours. It's just a part of her personality. And she can't do much about those who think what she does is wrong. She can only try to be informed, to make her own choices and mistakes. She only hopes that she'll never be as blind as she was during her time on Hala. Thanks for reading. Hope you enjoyed it.

Even in the vast, dark depths of empty space, confined to a spaceship guided by new-found friend Carol Danvers, running from the war in desperate hopes of calling someplace home, Talos was calm. This wasn't the facade he usually put up to mask the rage and distress stirring within him, however, but instead, for the first time in a very long time, this was a truly peaceful moment. Perhaps it was because finally, finally, he and his people - his family - had an ounce of hope to cling to, to make them even the least bit optimistic for what the future held for them. Soon, he prayed, they would all be in a safe place, away from the vile Kree empire and able to live their lives without worry, fear or dread. A lot of the praise and the thanks had to go to Carol, and Talos made sure of that. Or, perhaps this inner tranquility had more to do with the sleepy child nestled into him than his high hopes of better things. Talos lovingly gazed down at his daughter, deciding that this indeed was what seemed to be calming his nerves. The sweet thing had come to him in the middle of sleeping hours while he sat watch up in the captain's chair, watching the stars as they whizzed by. Sleep did not come easy for her, according to her mother, and this proved to be a reoccurring issue. Likely a side effect of being a child trapped in the middle of a gruesome war with nowhere to go, nowhere to truly get away from it all... yet. Talos had barely noticed she'd entered the room until he felt the light touch of some fingers brush against his shoulder. Honestly, he was surprised she had come to him at all. They weren't very acquainted. At least, not anymore. Not much longer after she came into the world, Talos assumed the weighty responsibility of protecting his people; a job that required him to be very absent for most of this child's life so far, unfortunately. Talos didn't regret what he had chosen to do for his kind, but he did regret the repercussions that came as a result. It tore apart his family. His daughter was very little, he could recall. Too little, in fact, to remember much of him. That's why she seemed so hesitant to greet him when he'd finally found them in the laboratory. His little girl, the most precious thing in the entire universe, didn't recognize him. And, though he didn't show it, that was an unbearably heartbreaking reality to face. But she had surprised him, proving he hadn't been completely expelled from her memory when she chose to draw close at the gentle urge from her mother. Some sort of faint connection was reestablished when he knelt down to show affection upon that reunion. Perhaps her brain could not recall the love and memories, but her heart knew. That's usually how things worked. From then on, Talos began to work at slowly rebuilding his relationship with his daughter, and oh , how delighted he was to see that this wouldn't prove to be a difficult feat. She had taken to him quicker than he or Soren had thought she would. Though she did still have her moments in which she gravitated towards his wife, Talos really had nothing to complain about. Especially after tonight. Staring out the window, Talos was zoned out, deep in thought. Until a small hand cupped the side of his head - a sign of affection - and pulled him back into reality. His dark purple hues met an identical (but very tired) pair of eyes gazing straight up at him. The youngling in his arms dared to smile bashfully, and Talos found himself unable to fight a smile of his own. \"What is it, my star?\" He inquiry received no answer, though. Not verbally. Instead, she shook her head, almost as if to say she had no complaints. That's how Talos chose to interpret it, at least. Through many, many unsuccessful attempts to fully converse with his daughter, the great Skrull leader finally had to come to terms with the fact that this was one small battle that he would not win. His daughter was adamant about speaking only on her own terms, when she wanted to. After everything that she'd seen and experience starting at such a young age, Talos supposed that this wasn't the worst way to deal with things... He and his wife would just have to adjust and accommodate this as best they could. The child's eyelids were beginning to grow heavy, but before Talos could urge her to stop resisting, she suddenly made a move. Her tiny, slim fingers wrapped around one of his wrists and with all of the energy her tired body could muster, she heaved his arm over her. It took Talos a second to understand what she was trying to accomplish, but then it clicked. Shifting in his seat, he slouched and propped his legs up on the rail, making it easier and much more comfortable to lay. Once the girl was settled, Talos tightened his first arm around her and then draped his other arm over top in a warm, protective embrace, just the way she wanted. The smile of approval he'd received in response only made his own smile grow. Few things could actually make Talos' heart flutter, but the feeling of his little one's head resting against his chest, to feel the gentle rise and fall of her frame with each breath definitely did the trick. He lightly caressed the back of her head, something he'd done frequently when was a babe, and sighed contentedly. Moments like this was what Talos would dream about when he was away from the ones he loved most; this is what his heart absolutely ached for. Her love and trust. This was it. This was the tranquility, this was the peace he'd been hoping to attain for so long... and even if it would only last for just a couple more hours, he was grateful. He was positive nothing could make him happier. \" I love you. \" whispered a small, scratchy voice. Except that. ","Summary":" Talos couldn't remember the last time he'd felt so... peaceful.

I haven't visited It in years. Normally those who visit are disobedient or new. I am neither. Though this is a special case. Apparently the Supreme Intelligence wants to have my apprentice go through one final test before becoming a true Kree hero. I am here to learn exactly what test and how to administer it. I grow slightly worried as Vers - my apprentice - is not known for mastering her emotions in combat. Or anything else for that matter. Entering the hallway leading to the chamber, I motioned for Vers to go first. She has a propensity to disappear at the most annoying times and I wished for her to actually stay for once. Standing on the circle on the chamber floor, I watched as the blue tendrils slowly creeped up my wrists, than my neck, and finally resting on my temples. Looking out of my peripherals I reassured myself that Vers was still there. She offered me a smirk. Rolling my eyes I stared ahead again at the plain white wall ahead of me and closed my eyes, feeling myself slowly sink into a mindless state. \"Well this is unexpected!\" I turn my head to face who just talked. I widened my eyes, startled at what I saw. \"Once or twice a Kree has seen another as the form they most admire. But I never thought coming from you! And this girl especially!\" I stared into the large brown eyes of Vers - my apprentice, my friend, the person I admire the most. \"I am suprised as well m'am\" I replied, trying to seem surprised. She snorted. \"I can see into your mind you know. It's not that hard to tell if you're telling the truth.\" She sighed. \"Well at least she is quite oblivious to most things, so this thing you have going on,\" she motioned to me. \"Won't affect anything else.\" \"So the test?\" I asked changing the subject. \"I will have Minn-erva administer it. You are too close to the subject in question.\" I nodded, expecting nothing else. \"What will I tell her?\" \"I am sending you on the mission that Minn-erva was supposed to go on, as she will take your place.\" I sighed inwardly, neither woman would be very happy with this. Outwardly I nodded, closed my eyes and slowly felt myself flying up, up, up, back into chamber. Stumbling slightly backwards, I toppled into the waiting arms of Vers. Wide brown eyes met mine and smiled. I smiled back, and for the first and probably the last time I let myself fully relax and embrace the realisation. I, Yon-Rogg, loved the girl I found on the beach two years ago, the one I gave my blood for. Vers. ","Summary":" The Supreme Intelligence. I haven't visited It in years.

Shirou's dad also past away (how is up to you). This story has to take place after the Captain Marvel movie and the 5th Holy Grail war. The story can take place in any fate route (personally I favour the Avalon pairing, but if you want to use UBW or HF that's up to you). Some optional things: Carol returns to earth after 18 years, 10/12 years after the movie(2005/2008) Her friend Maria tells her about Shirou. Carol then goes to Fury, who is now the the director of SHIELD, who gives her more info about her son. So that's the basic outline of the story, the rest is up to you.

This story is the product of the Captain Marvel / Marvel Cinematic Universe's characters and world and my imagination This fic is entirely from Carol / Vers' POV and so for the majority of it she is unaware of the lies she's being told and the way she is being manipulated, though hopefully you as readers can see that this is definitely an unhealthy and dysfunctional relationship. One His is the first face she sees when she wakes up, his golden eyes filled with worry. She has no idea who he is. She has no idea who she is. \"Vers,\" he watches her intently as she looks around in confusion, \"how are you feeling?\" \"Where am I?\" she asks, and she notes her voice is hoarse, as if from disuse. \"You're on Hala,\" he tells her, his voice soothing and even in a way that calms her, \"we were on a mission when we found you … it seems you were attacked by Skrulls.\" She tries to think back, to ascertain what has happened to her, but there is nothing there. Hala, Skrulls … all these words are unfamiliar to her. And her head hurts. \"I … I can't remember.\" Her voice trembles slightly. She doesn't like this uncertainty and confusion. It makes her feel weak. His voice is soft, \"you were in bad shape when we found you, Vers. No one knows how severe the memory loss is, or how long it will last.\" She only nods. She doesn't know what else to do, and she really doesn't want to cry. \"Vers,\" she says after a few moments of quiet, the word feeling unfamiliar on her tongue, \"is that my name?\" He looks sympathetically at her, \"we only found part of an identity tag. The Skrulls are brutal creatures and they revel in carnage so the damage is no surprise. I wanted you to have a name, so I chose the clue that we could find.\" She blinks away tears at the knowledge that her identity is currently lost to her, but her attention is soon caught by the sight of the tubes and machinery surrounding her. A transfusion , her mind offers (identity issues aside, at least she knows some things, though she has no memories to go along with the knowledge). But blood is red , she thinks to herself as she watches the blue liquid enter her body. Or maybe that is simply something her mind has made up. She really can't be sure. \"You needed blood,\" he explains when he notices the direction of her gaze, \"or you might have died. I wanted to help you, so I offered mine.\" His blood in her veins. Is that why she feels a connection to him, why she trusts this stranger she knows nothing about? He takes her hand, and she finds that the physical contact is comforting in the sterile medical bay. \"We'll get you all fixed up soon enough,\" he tells her, \"and then I'll help you train so you can be sure the Skrulls will never get the better of you again. I imagine you're eager to join the fight to end their tyranny.\" She feels a burning anger towards those who have hurt her and caused the loss of her memories. Skrulls, he calls them. She will remember that name. He offers her a small smile, \"rest up, Vers,\" he tells her, before giving her hand one last squeeze and standing up. Before he leaves, though, he leans over and presses his lips briefly to her forehead, \"I'll be back tomorrow to check on you.\" \"Wait,\" she calls out just before he reaches the door, \"thank you … for helping me … and I don't even know your name.\" \"I am Yon-Rogg,\" he tells her, \"and believe me, it was a pleasure to assist.\" When he leaves, the room seems lonely and cold. When she sleeps, she dreams of golden eyes and blue blood running through her veins. Two The nightmares are almost normal now. They began two days after the medics released her, the night following her first visit to the Supreme Intelligence. The Supreme Intelligence, who wears a face that is both almost familiar and completely unknown to her. She isn't disturbed by the dreams every night, but they happen often enough that the memory of them always lingers in the back of her mind, a constant reminder of the mysteries of her past. The first time she had the dream she moved on autopilot, out of her rooms and down the hall to the apartment that belongs to Yon-Rogg. And he answered then, immediately knowing how to distract her by suggesting some early morning sparring. She always goes to find him and he always answers the door. He's reliable like that. One night, though, she is more exhausted than usual. They've just come back from a four day mission where she managed a grand total of five hours sleep. And now, with her regular nightmare waking her in the dead of night, she knows she won't have the energy for the sparring that normally takes her mind off her confusing, frustrating recurring dream. So while she stumbles down the corridor towards Yon-Rogg's apartment as usual, she goes off script when he opens the door. \"Can I stay here … please?\" She doesn't know how exactly he'll react. The Kree aren't known for being particularly emotional creatures, after all. And Yon-Rogg is nothing if not a conservative Kree warrior. He looks closely at her, scrutinising the bags under her eyes and the way she can barely keep her eyes open. \"Come in then,\" he says eventually, voice dry and barely the hint of a smile. She wants him to smile properly. He does it so rarely that it always feels like an accomplishment when she manages to coax one out of him. She looks around his apartment curiously. The furniture is well-made but sparse, the personal touches almost non-existent. \"I've only got one bed so we'll have to share,\" he tells her matter-of-factly as he gestures towards his bedroom. She thinks of the anti-fraternisation protocols she was forced to memorise a few weeks after her arrival on Hala, and reckons that this is probably in violation of at least half a dozen rules. But it's an emergency, really, and she's sure Yon-Rogg would never do anything that could lead to their dismissal from Starforce. She climbs in the bed fully clothed, and as Yon-Rogg gets in next to her she already feels calmer. She falls asleep almost immediately, her commander a comforting warmth next to her. When she jerks awake an hour or two later, shaking from another dream, he is immediately alert. She's shaking, breathing heavily and trying not to hyperventilate. It's not often this bad, but every now and then the dreams throw her more off balance than usual. \"Vers … Vers, you have to relax.\" She can hear Yon-Rogg's voice but she can't do as he says, can't seem to stop shaking. \"Vers,\" his tone more forceful now, with just a thread of worry. She takes deep breaths, but it doesn't seem to help. She just sits up in the bed, trying desperately to calm her mind. And then, without warning, Yon-Rogg kisses her. \"Breathe,\" he murmurs against her lips. And she does. In and out, as the warmth of his lips distracts her enough that she finally ceases to tremble. He breaks away from her after a few moments, slides back to his side of the bed and leans against the pillows, \"better, Vers?\" She grins at him, the unexpected affection cheering her up, even though she's sure he only kissed her as a last resort to try and make her shake off the vestiges of the nightmare, \"thanks Commander.\" He gives her a wry little smile as she settles back against her pillows, \"well don't go spreading this tale around. Neither of us will be much use against the Skrulls if they bench us for breaking the fraternisation rules.\" \"Pinky swear,\" she offers her little finger to him and he looks at it with the same bemused expression he always wears when she says something that is clearly a vestige of her old, forgotten life, rather than something she's learnt on Hala. She wiggles her finger and he sighs before mirroring her gesture. \"Goodnight, Yon-Rogg,\" she says as her eyes start to drift closed. \"Night, Vers.\" She sleeps until nearly lunchtime. She doesn't dream. Three Vers is high on the success of their most recent mission, full of pent up energy that needs to be released. Yon-Rogg takes her to the training room as soon as their ship touches down. Most of their team go off to their apartments to rest, but she wants to work through her post-mission high, hoping it will make her tired enough to sleep through the night. And her commander, as always, is happy to indulge her desire to spar. They go one, two, three rounds, almost dancing around the room as they kick, punch and spin in an attempt to get the better of each other. Her hands glow a few times, but it only takes a brief glance from Yon-Rogg and she manages to push down the power. He likes her to fight normally, reminding her that she needs to be in peak physical condition as a member of the elite Starforce team, and that she cannot rely on a power that is made unwieldy by her fluctuating emotional state. They are five minutes in to a fourth round when Yon-Rogg flips her over his head and she winces when she lands hard on the mat. She has no time to think about the pain, however, because she immediately has to fend off his attempts to make her yield this bout to him. There is a moment of stillness when he pins her to the ground and then, suddenly, she moves, arching up to kiss him. She's not sure why she does it. Perhaps she's just tired and worn out from fighting. Or because he's handsome and she's not blind to that. Or maybe it is simply that he's the one who has been there for her ever since she arrived on Hala, and she just wants to feel closer to him. Whatever the reason … she doesn't kiss him softly. She's angry and riled up, and she pours all of that into this one rough kiss. Part of her expects him to freeze up, to scold her about letting her emotions overwhelm her and breaching fraternisation rules. She doesn't anticipate that he will kiss back with even more fierceness than she is showing. Yon-Rogg is always so serious and dedicated to the cause that she forgets he can get frustrated too – he's just better at controlling himself than she is. It becomes almost a battle of wills between them. She's never managed to win a fight with him without using her powers, and though this kiss is exactly the opposite of what she should be doing to practice control, part of her wants to beat Yon-Rogg in something . She tries to manoeuvre out of his hold, but he just grins cockily and keeps her pinned down. In retaliation, she bites down on his bottom lip as he moves to pull away from her, and she can't help but grin when she tastes blood. \"Vers,\" he gives her a warning glance, before he shifts his body suddenly and manages to completely incapacitate her. \"Interesting technique,\" he tells her almost conversationally as she fights vainly to get up, \"but you've got to govern your emotions, not let your anger get the best of you.\" He stands and offers her his hand to pull her up from the floor. She massages her aching wrists while he steps forward to cup her cheeks in the gentlest gesture he's offered her all day. \"I only want to help you, Vers, you know that, don't you?\" She nods and offers him a small smile. She is well aware of how lucky she is to be able to work with Starforce, and to have a mentor like Yon-Rogg. She only wishes that control came as easily to her as it seems to come to him. Four Vers knows she isn't like the rest of Starforce. They are such a serious group, always focused on missions and training. And she tries to be like them, tries to emulate Yon-Rogg's cool, collected demeanour and poise under pressure. She wants to make him proud. Still, she can't help the emotions that always seem to be bubbling just under the surface, trying to get out. Control it. Control it. Control it. It's her mantra, her way of trying to keep calm. Sometimes, though, she just feels like she has to escape. Her life is a strict regime, with very little downtime. Mostly, that's fine, and she likes it that way. It means less time to feel lonely. She's cordial with the rest of Starforce, though she knows that Minn-Erva dislikes her (even if she can't figure out why), but none of them are her friends. Vers doesn't have friends. She's just got Yon-Rogg. Who else does she really need, though? She has comfortable rooms, exciting missions, and the chance to be a hero and save planets from the menace of the Skrulls. She'd thought about making friends to begin with, back when she was new to Hala. She never really got the chance, though. Yon-Rogg showed her around, but he was always wary of letting her out on her own. For her own safety, of course. She can take care of herself, but the threat of the Skrulls is not to be underestimated, even by a member of the elite Starforce. \" I just thought I should get to know some more of the city, and some of the new recruits invited me out tonight.\" \" I'm sorry Vers,\" he says, \"but you've got to be up early tomorrow for training. And it's really not safe in the city right now. There were Skrull sightings a few days ago, and they have a particular hatred for Starforce.\" She frowns, \"I didn't see anything in the news bulletins.\" \" We've kept it out of the news,\" he tells her, \"we don't want to cause a panic.\" \" I'll be extra careful, then,\" she pleads, \"I just want to get out for a while.\" She loves her work, but she's been feeling a bit boxed in lately. She wants to stretch her legs a bit. Yon-Rogg shakes his head and gives her a consoling pat on the arm, \"not tonight, Vers. Maybe next month.\" She frowns, but nods her head in agreement. Yon-Rogg only wants what's best for her, but sometimes she wishes he wasn't quite so protective. Even now, after four years on Hala, her commander is still leery of her leaving the base alone. The Skrulls have been getting bolder, and Starforce's missions are constantly increasing in frequency and difficulty. It's a dangerous time for all of them. She still doesn't make any friends, but on occasion she manages to slip away to visit one of the rowdy bars she feels drawn to. Sometimes she even sneaks out to fly one of the ships – she can't remember her life before Hala, but somehow she knows with a bone-deep certainty that she loved to fly. And it's on her way to the hanger bay early one morning that she runs into Yon-Rogg. He frowns at her, hands on his hips and disapproval etched onto his features at her deception. She feels terrible, because she really does hate to make him angry, especially after he's helped her so much since her arrival on Hala. \"I'm only concerned for you, Vers,\" he tells her as he steers her away from the hanger bay and towards the training room, \"I don't want anything to jeopardise your place with Starforce.\" He lifts a hand to her neck, brushing the control disc there, \"they could take this away, Vers, if you're not careful. And you know I don't want that to happen.\" The thought of being removed from Starforce, and of losing the control disc that keeps her powers from spiraling out of control, is an awful one for her. Yon-Rogg clearly understands her thoughts, because his stern look softens, \"I'll help you, Vers, don't worry. And one day they'll tell stories about you, and how you helped end the Skrull's vicious campaign.\" She gives him a grateful look, \"and tales of her wonderful commander, of course.\" \"Of course,\" he agrees with a twinkle in his golden eyes, \"now hurry up, we should be able to get a few hours of training in before the briefing later.\" They spar again and again, until she manages three whole bouts without her hands glowing once and he rewards her with the flash of a smile. \"I'm going on a short mission tomorrow to get some intel,\" he tells her as they walk back towards their rooms, \"minimal danger, too easy really, but the source is a bit skittish and prefers to speak to someone from Starforce … since you did so well in training today, perhaps you'd like to come and fly the ship.\" Her eyes widen in excitement, and she leans up to wrap her arms around him, grinning happily when he rolls his eyes but returns her hug, even if his movements are a little wooden. \"No crazy manoeuvres,\" he warns her, as she starts to daydream about how much fun it will be to fly for a while, \"we don't want a repeat of the Torfa incident.\" Vers frowns at him, \"that was Bron-Char's fault,\" she reminds him, \"… mostly.\" He must be in an especially good mood today, because he actually laughs, a rarity for him, \"just don't get too overenthusiastic.\" \"I won't, I promise,\" she tells him. They reach her door and, without even thinking about it, she leans up and kisses him quickly, barely a brush of her lips against his before she pulls back. He raises an eyebrow, \"what was that for, Vers?\" She's not great at finding the words to let him know how much it means that he's trusting her to go with him on this mission, and how she appreciates that he's always willing to help her with training even though she knows that as a highly-placed commander he has a lot of calls on his time. So, she keeps it simple, hoping he will understand. \"Just … thank you, Yon-Rogg … really.\" He says nothing in return, only taps her forehead, his usual reminder for her to let her brain, not her emotions, guide her actions on their upcoming mission. She watches him head towards his own apartment, before hurrying into her own with a buzz of anticipation running through her veins. And she knows, instinctively, that she won't have nightmares tonight. She'll dream of flying freely through the sky instead. Five \"Control your emotions.\" Vers has lost count of the number of times he's said it to her over the years, the words usually accompanied by his tight grip over her fists until she manages to make the glow fade away. It's for her own good, that's what he always says. \" I don't want you to get hurt, Vers, and allowing your emotions to rule you is dangerous in a fight.\" Today is not a good day. Her nightmare was especially long and confusing, and she's just so tired, so angry. Her hands glow again and Yon-Rogg holds her still, tells her to calm down, to let go of the past she can't remember. It's not working. The glow intensifies. She wants to be in control. She wants to make Yon-Rogg proud. If only wishing could make it come true. Occasionally, however, when she's alone, she wonders what is really so bad about allowing her emotions out once in a while. She knows that they can be a distraction when she's in the field, but surely they are an asset too. Would she work so hard if she didn't feel so strongly that she has to help those oppressed by the Skrulls? Would she be able to pick herself up off the floor time and time again during training if she was always as eerily calm as some of her fellow Starforce members seem to be, rather than motivated by stubborn determination? Her mind is pulled back to the fight by the sight of Yon-Rogg's fist heading straight for her face. She barely manages to block the blow, distracted as she is, and it takes only a few more seconds before her commander's next move hits its mark and she is sent sprawling to the floor. \"Get up,\" he tells her harshly, clearly irritated by her poor showing. She immediately goes on the offensive, his critical expression pushing her to prove herself. She manages a little better now, but she knows she's not at the top of her game and so does he. When he calls a halt to their practice, she half collapses onto the mat, while he sits himself down opposite her with far more grace. \"Your head's all over the place today, Vers.\" Frustration bleeds into Yon-Rogg's voice. It's been at least a year since she's had a training session that went so badly and she's sure at least part of him is taking it as a personal affront. \"I'm … tired,\" she admits, \"and confused.\" \"Confused?\" he asks. \"No matter how hard I try, I'm not sure I'll ever be able to completely master my emotions the way the Supreme Intelligence says that I should. Yet part of me wonders whether allowing my emotions free reign might help sometimes. I know that you say it's a bad idea, but somehow I think it might help my powers if I wasn't always suppressing everything.\" Yon-Rogg's eyes darken for a moment, and there is a flash of something there … anger, or worry, she can't quite tell. Then his expression clears and he looks at her with only worry. \"I'm being foolish,\" she says quickly, before he can suggest a visit to the Supreme Intelligence, something which usually vexes her, as the shape it takes is the woman from her nightmares. Her hands glow slightly, a side-effect of her heightened emotions, and Yon-Rogg sighs, \"you're no fool, Vers, and we all have … misguided ideas sometimes. I promise you that the Supreme Intelligence only wants you to be the best warrior you can possibly be.\" He grasps one of her hands in his own and brings it to his lips, placing a soft, almost reverent kiss on her glowing skin. \"I have faith in you,\" he reminds her solemnly. He keeps a loose grip on her hand as the glow recedes slowly, only letting go when it has completely disappeared. A wave of exhaustion hits her and Vers lies back on the mat, tempted to close her eyes and go to sleep. \"Head back to your apartment,\" Yon-Rogg tells her, uncharacteristically generous, \"and we'll continue tomorrow when you're feeling better. We're heading into Skrull territory in a few days and you have to be in top shape.\" The prospect of an imminent chance for a good fight cheers Vers as she walks back to her rooms. The Skrulls are a danger to Hala, the Kree and the whole galaxy, but at least her mind is blissfully unconflicted when it comes to the fearsome race. A simple straightforward fight is just what she needs right now. Six \" I'm so proud of you. You've come a long way since that day I found you by the lake … but can you keep your emotions in check long enough to take me on. Or will they get the better of you as always?\" He pauses for a moment before he speaks again, \"I always told you, you'll be ready the day you can knock me down as yourself. This is that moment … THIS is that moment, Vers. Turn off the lightshow and prove, prove to me that you can beat me with-\" She cuts him off with a blast. \" I have nothing to prove to you.\" She has been set free by the truth. Still, despite the strong front she shows to Yon-Rogg, she finds herself shaken, only just beginning to process all she has recently discovered. It was all a lie. She'd thought the Kree were heroes. She'd believed that she was a hero. She doesn't want to look at her hands. If she does then surely she will see them painted in blood. Skrull blood. And Yon-Rogg is the architect of it all. Every memory of these past six years is tainted for her. She sees it all differently now. What she thought was protection and friendship and care and worry … it was manipulation and control, turning her into a weapon but ensuring she stayed under their thumb. She was happy. At least she thinks she was happy. But she can't trust herself anymore. If she cuts her hand then she will bleed blue. She's not Kree, not completely. But she's not human either. Is this what Yon-Rogg did? He took Carol Danvers and turned her into Vers, into a weapon designed to aid in the Kree expansion. The Skrull destruction. It's her hands, though. She helped decimate the Skrulls, and with the unyielding conviction that she was doing the right thing, that she was helping to save other planets. Will her conscience ever be clean? All the good intentions in the world still don't erase what she has done as a member of Starforce. She drags a half-unconscious Yon-Rogg to the pod. He'll make a good message for the Supreme Intelligence. She looks at him as she straps him into the pod. For six years he and Starforce have been everything to her. In an ideal world, he would be nothing to her now. This is not an ideal world. Feelings, emotions, memories. They all remain. Even now she sees the truth, there is still a part of her that feels something for Yon-Rogg, even though she can't work out exactly what that is. He murmurs about how he cannot go back empty handed, but she doesn't really listen. Instead she simply presses her lips firmly against his. This is what she allows herself to close this chapter of her life. She doesn't imagine she's done with the Kree or Hala or Yon-Rogg, not by a long-shot. But she won't be ignorant, not anymore. And she won't be a puppet. This is goodbye to Vers, the Starforce warrior who trusted Yon-Rogg implicitly. She blasts the pod away from earth, and watches as it becomes just a dot in the sky. Vers is gone. She's Carol again. Thanks for reading. Hope you enjoyed it. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I don't own the Marvel Cinematic Universe or Captain Marvel.

Overhead, the sky had just begun to turn itself into a breathtaking tapestry of periwinkle washed with pink and gold, the sun just starting to dip down below the hilly line of the horizon. They stood out in the backyard, the two adults hanging back and watching contentedly as Maria's rambunctious, bushy-haired daughter raced about, bubble wand gripped tight in her hand. None of them seemed to mind the mugginess. In between sips of their lemonades and laughter, they knew that they would wake the next morning entire galaxies apart — they knew, and tried their best not to think about it. Tonight, there would be no thoughts of war or destruction, nor the heartache that had spanned the six years they'd spent apart. Just the three of them — Carol, Maria, and Monica. If that wasn't what you could call a family, then damned if Carol knew what was. It was as mushy a thought as she'd ever allow herself, but she couldn't help but feel that moments like this made it all worthwhile. All the toiling and climbing uphill she'd ever had to do all her life, all the pushback and the godforsaken grief that had been so generously given to her by so countlessly many — this, she realized, is what it was all for. She'd be kidding herself if she pretended that it wasn't nice to feel something close to a sense of purpose, of belonging ; and she had never felt that more than when she stood here at Maria's side. How very fitting that Maria Rambeau was the only woman who could ever give Carol the same feeling as soaring through the air behind the wheel of an enormous jet, as working alongside Talos to help continue Mar-Vell's work, to hide the Skrulls and make the universe a better place. And the best part of it all was that her very dearest ambition was a shared one. Both Carol and Maria wanted the same things out of their lives — to make a difference. And together, she had no doubt that the two of them could accomplish it. What, with her own stubbornness and Maria's unfathomable smarts? If they wanted to, they could conquer the world together — worlds, plural even, no question. After what she'd seen of most of the worlds outside of Earth, she wasn't sure that many of them would be worth the trouble. It was the softer times, the ones like this, just watching Lieutenant Trouble over there zoom around the yard, chasing soapy-smelling bubbles, that kept her humble. Every now and then, it was nice to have a little reminder that sometimes making a difference didn't have to be on such a grand scale as she tended to daydream it. Sometimes, it could be as small or as simple as lemonades and summer nights, as looping her arm around Maria Rambeau's strong, sturdy waist and leaning her head against her partner's shoulder. Pretending that this wouldn't be their last night together — not for a long time, anyway. Tough as she liked to stay on the outside, Carol had always hated goodbyes. She always felt too stupidly vulnerable whenever faced with them, knocked clean off her feet by the surge of raw emotion that always seemed to embed itself right in the pit of her stomach. You can't get through goodbyes with brute force. And how dare anything make her feel weak. She tried her best to smother her fears in the rim of her lemonade glass, grinning mid-sip as she watched Nick Fury's car pull out of the driveway and roll off into the twilight. \"I hope that he'll be okay,\" said Maria, following Carol's line of sight and gazing after Fury's car, herself. \"With his eye and everything, I mean.\" \"Don't you worry about Fury — he'll be fine,\" Carol replied, with a confidence in her new friend that felt so unshakable, it was a touch astonishing. \"I'm just wondering what kind of story he'll weave up for the boys back at the office,\" she added with an amused snort. Maria's laugh was soft, the kind that put a mischievous twinkle in her dark, familiar eyes. \"That an alien race burned it out while he singlehandedly saved the world as we know it?\" \"Singlehandedly?\" said Carol. \"Like hell!\" Another laugh, this one louder, spunkier than before, rose up like champagne bubbles from Maria's lips. She elbowed her partner gingerly in the rib cage — if there was one thing the years hadn't stolen from them, it was their love of playfully roughhousing and teasing one another — and finished the gesture with a roguish wink. \"That's my girl,\" Maria said, in a voice full of pride, and despite her indignation, Carol smiled. A long pause spanned between the two of them, punctuated only by Monica's laughter pealing through the warm evening air. And yet, in the silence, so much seemed to be said all at once. Somehow, Carol knew that both of them were thinking the same thing — staring up at that vast, endless expanse of sky, it was hard not to — but some part of her selfishly wished to keep pushing all that aside. That part of her, small but relentless, and too tough to kill, wanted to hang on to whatever sense of normalcy she could contrive for herself for as long as possible. When she was out there, weaving her way through the stars, she wanted to be able to look back and remember moments like these most of all. The illusion of perfection couldn't last long, though, and when Maria cleared her throat, Carol knew that the conversation she'd been dreading was about to happen. Sure enough, what came next didn't exactly sound promising. \"So . . . \" said Maria, her voice uncertain, questing for all the answers that neither of them had. \"You really don't know when you'll be back again?\" Carol narrowed her eyes, shifting her gaze to the stars once again, cursing herself for being too cowardly to look in the eyes of the woman she had loved so dearly for so long. \"I can't leave them behind,\" she said at last, \"not until I can find a place where I know they'll be safe from the Kree.\" I owe them that much, for all I've done , she thought, but didn't have the strength to voice. Her response wasn't a complete answer at all, and she somehow knew that Maria would see right through her. If that was true, her partner didn't mention it. Instead, she gave a wistful sigh, and Carol took another sip of lemonade, now watered-down by the melting ice, to hide the sudden emotion making a lump in her throat. \"Six years,\" said Maria thoughtfully, clutching her glass and staring into its sugary depths as if it might hold the solution to their little dilemma, \"and despite everything, you really haven't changed a bit.\" The smile returned to her features, this time as its own rueful ghost. \"I'm grateful for that.\" At last lowering her gaze to meet Maria's, Carol took a step closer and whispered, \"I am sorry, you know. For everything. I only wish I could stay longer. It kills me to have to leave you behind again.\" It was as raw an admission as she would ever make, and it had burned on its way out like hot coals scraping against the back of her throat. The other woman seemed to consider this for what felt like an eternity. Carol nearly found herself dreading what Maria would say, it took so long — the suspense was positively maddening for someone as impulse-driven as she. But where Carol was all warmth and passion, wildfires and rage and untethered waves of emotion, Maria had always been cool, nuanced, precise. She loved to weigh every option, to take her time; it had been Maria whose guidance had taught her to stop and smell the roses, to really enjoy and savor getting to kick some ass. At last, Maria reached out and her hand found Carol's, their fingers interlocking together as they had so many times all those years ago. How strange it was, for something to feel so newly exhilarating and so familiar, all at once. Carol Danvers found herself embracing the gesture gladly, a warmth spreading through her that she was certain had nothing to do with the summer weather. \"I always knew what I was getting into, being with you,\" Maria reasoned, her full, alluring mouth curving into a clever grin. \"The woman I love volunteered to jump in a plane and take what she knew was a huge risk, just to be able to save the lives that were at stake. It wasn't just bravado with you, I knew that. You might be as hotheaded as they come, Danvers, but when you say something, you mean it.\" Her eyes searched Carol's gaze, and after a moment, she gave a slow, subtle nod of her head. \"So if you say you're gonna be back for me someday, then I believe you.\" Another pause, and then, with a smile that was more genuine this time: \"I just know damn well you better not take six years this time.\" There was so much that Carol wished she could say — so much that she could have chosen to say. I love you too , or I promise I'll be back as soon as I can — something to convey the truth of the enormous breadth of her feelings without hiding behind her own cleverness. Was it for Maria's or her own sake that she seemed to want to tough this all out so stalwartly? She couldn't be sure. Either way, no matter what she tried, words seemed to be inadequate for what she intended to express. In place of all that, all she could bring herself to do was squeeze Maria's hands — three quick squeezes, that had been their code for as long as she could remember. It had been one of the first little puzzle pieces to fall back into her head when her memories of life before had begun to arrange themselves back into something resembling normal. Even when she didn't have the strength to say everything she wanted aloud, she knew Maria would comprehend the meaning of this little gesture all by itself. And then, with a smile — doing her best to ignore the sudden watery blurriness in her eyes — Carol nodded and said, doing her best not to waver, \"You got it.\" ","Summary":" The evening air was alive with cricket-song and lightning bugs, August humidity so thick you could "},{"Movie":"Captain Marvel","Title":"Remnants","Author":"LoveMeNever","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13236941","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Set after Captain Marvel (2019). I have never read any of the comic books and am only familiar with events portrayed in the Marvel movies, so if there are inaccuracies that will be why. I do not own anything in the Marvel Universe besides my original character and this particular story. This first part is more like an intro than an actual chapter, so there is way more to come! Carol tapped her finger on her leg while staring out at space. LED lights lit up the spaceship console and blinked every so often. It was peaceful out here. Three months ago, Carol stopped the Kree from eradicating the remaining Skrulls. Now, they were searching space for a place to call their own. Carol was happy to help, but she was starting to miss Earth. More flashes of her memories were slowly coming back to her, of the life she had before the crash. She remembered much more about her best friend and their life together, and she could remember her parents a little more. High school crushes, sports accidents, first time driving a car, and joining the army. She was remembering it all. Except for one flash of long light brown hair glowing golden in the sunlight, big toothed grin, and hazel eyes. Every time the memory surfaced, Carol got a strange feeling in her chest. It felt heavy. It was driving her just as mad as when she would have flashes of Dr. Lawson. She knew this woman, how was the question, and why did her heart drop every time she saw the remnants of the memory? Anytime the flash came, she closed her eyes and inhaled deeply. She could almost feel the wind whipping and the smell of salt, they were on the beach, but when she tried to focus in on the woman it never worked fully. She made out some facial features but that was all. Footsteps interrupted her thoughts. She recognized them as belonging to Talos almost immediately. He had a heavy walk that you tended to hear way before he arrived. \"What's up, Talos?\" She said right as he entered. He rolled his eyes, \"How did you know it was me?\" \"Because I know everything. Obviously.\" Carol retorted with a smirk. Talos pursed his mouth and gave her a pained expression. Walking over to the console, he fidgeted with some of the glowing buttons and touch screen pad. \"How far away from CFR-700 are we?\" Carol frowned, she could feel the anxiety radiating off of him and empathized with him. The past few weeks, all the Skrulls were getting anxious to find a home. Morale was low since the last two planets with a good atmosphere and seemingly habitable lands ended up having hidden dangers that none of them would have expected. Both occasions, Carol managed to wrestle the dangerous creatures away from the Skrulls, but if she had tried to leave, they would have slaughtered the refugees. And so, the search continued. Luckily, the Kree had not followed them so far. Carol hoped that damn AI was destroyed for good and the Kree could be free from its influence and change their ways, but that was way too good to be true. She glanced at the coordinates on the console in front of her, \"We're only about 14 hours away. You should spend some time with your family until then. I'll let you know if anything changes, I promise.\" Talos seemed to relax and he smiled in appreciation, \"Alright, thank you.\" He turned and walked away, leaving Carol alone again. As much as she wanted the company, Carol thought it would be better for everyone if Talos relaxed more. She kicked her feet up on the side of the console and leaned back. It would still be hours before making any kind of contact with CFR-700, so she closed her eyes and let sleep take her. \"Come on! This way!\" \"Slow down! God, you're not leading me to my death, are you?\" \"Hmm, only one way to find out…\" Carol smiled and let herself be dragged off by this person she completely trusted. There was something over her eyes covering them completely, so a small part of her was a little anxious. \"Okay, you ready?\" She only nodded, and felt the person lift the piece of cloth off her eyes. At first she couldn't see anything with the bright sun shining into her eyes, but as they got adjusted, she gasped at the sight before her. She was on top of a cliff overlooking the beach and the sun was setting casting a beautiful orange color on everything. She glanced over and saw a woman, her long brown hair was glowing golden around the edges as the sun hit her, her hazel eyes showing all the beautiful colors in them, and her mouth was in a huge open grin. There were light freckles over her nose and on her cheeks, but they were easy to miss with the woman's skin already being a darker shade. Carol felt a hand wrap around her upper arm and hold tight as the woman came closer leaning her head against hers in a side hug. She leaned into the embrace and took in a deep breath, completely content to stay like this for a while. A jerk startled Carol into the real world again. Her eyes felt a little groggy as they darted around finding the source of the motion. The ship had entered a field of asteroids, Carol grabbed the manual controls and quickly evaded a fast approaching rock, Talos rushed into the room with a few others and immediately began shouting out orders for people to take their stations. \"Where did this field come from? It's not showing up on any of the radars!\" He asked heatedly. Carol checked the sensors and found he was right, they weren't popping up on any of them. That got Carol thinking. \"Transferring controls over. I'm going out there,\" she hopped up from her seat and nodded once to Talos, trying to reassure him. She stepped into the airlock and waited for the pressure to lift until it was safe to open it. She felt gravity flip on her and she used her powers to fly out into space. A particularly large asteroid was aimed at the ship, so she went up to push it away, but when her hands extended out they were met with nothing. The image of the asteroid flickered any time her hand passed through, but there was nothing actually there. This was a hologram field of asteroids. Carol's brow creased in confusion. What was it doing in the middle of nowhere in space? Flying ahead, Carol scoped out the area. The hologram asteroids were passing through her body as she flew further into the field. What is that? A glimmer of light caught her eyes, curiosity got the better of her and as she got closer the surrounding asteroid field disappeared along with the illusion of endless space. In front of her was no longer asteroids, but a planet with blue, red, and green surfaces. She narrowed her eyes, there shouldn't be a planet out here but here one was hidden amongst the fake asteroid field. She flew closer making sure it would be safe for the ship to also fly closer. When she was satisfied there wouldn't be any offensive action for approaching, Carol flew back to the ship and entered the airlock. She ran to the control room where Talos was looking anxious. \"What the hell is going on out there?\" He asked while eyeing the asteroids closely. \"They're fake. It must be some sort of defense system because there's a planet up ahead.\" She explained. Talos shook his head, \"But there shouldn't be a planet out here!\" \"Well, there is. Don't you think it's worth looking into?\" Carol raised her eyebrows and watched Talos' internal battle with investigating more or continuing on their path to CFR-700. \"If this planet isn't on any maps or radars, it could be perfect for your people, Talos. I promised to help you and protect you while you searched for a home. Let me do that.\" Finally, Talos sneered and turned to his men, \"Let's prepare the defense systems but set a course to land on that planet,\" he turned back to Carol. \"I hope you're right about this.\" Carol nodded at him and watched the planet come into view once they were past the holograms of asteroids. They entered the atmosphere relatively smoothly, and they were met with no cannons or guns or energy beams, which was a good sign so far. The ship landed in a forest-like area. The trees here were beautiful and colorful, nothing like what was on Earth. On the ends of the branches were small lights that lit the area up. Talos and the rest of the Skrull looked out of the window in marvel. The automated voice in the ship's system started running numbers, then said, \"Air pollution clear, air: breathable. Planet water system, clear, water: safe. Atmosphere status: strong.\" \"You guys stay here, I'm going to go check things out. Keep the comms up and I'll let you know when it's safe.\" Carol told the Skrulls as she left the ship for the second time. The ship had done an accurate air test because when she walked out of the ship the clear air hit her face and she was able to safely breathe it. She walked for a few minutes in a random direction just to scope it out more. This planet was beautiful, and no sign of any dangerous threats lurking, yet. There were a few animals scurrying through the trees but the scanner that Talos helped install on her suit was not picking up any threatening signatures from them. Some of them resembled squirrels and rabbits from Earth, in fact. \"Oh my God, it's a squirrel!\" An excited voice said. Carol looked around confused, she was the only one out here. Her scanners weren't picking up any other life forms other than the small creatures around her. \"Don't get too close. Those things can be vicious in the wild.\" Carol heard her own voice say. She turned around checking every direction to make sure she wasn't just hearing things. \"It's a squirrel,\" the woman's voice deadpanned. \"Look at how handsome he is!\" Carol was suddenly back on Earth, in a park with a woman with brown hair wearing black skinny jeans, a dark blue plaid shirt, and blue converse shoes. Her face was blurry, but Carol watched her crouch down and pull out a notebook and pencil to start drawing the animal. The blonde felt herself smile, and gaze at the crouched woman affectionately. \"Wow, only you would get a squirrel of all things to pose for you,\" Carol quipped. The woman looked back at her, her face still blurry, but Carol could almost feel the sly smile. \"He wouldn't be the only one.\" Carol felt her cheeks flush, \"Now stop distracting me!\" The other woman laughed. Carol bit back a sarcastic response, laughed, and continued to watch the squirrel. It was actually standing up on its hind legs sniffing the air and staring at the drawing woman. After a few moments the squirrel ran away and the woman stood, showing Carol the drawing. \"Got most of it before he left, what do you think?\" The drawing was actually quite impressive for just a minute or two worth of time. The woman was becoming quite good at impromptu sketches. She grinned a huge toothy grin as she showed Carol the picture. \"It's perfect.\" Carol shook her head, it was another remnant of a memory. She felt a smile on her lips, the memory was a happy one just like the other had been, and it featured the same woman from before too. \"Lifeform detected-\" the scanner on Carol's arm spoke suddenly breaking her thoughts and snapping her back to the new, and possibly hostile, planet. She felt a cold object press to her back and she rolled her eyes. \"Put your hands up! Who are you?\" A voice behind her demanded. Carol turned slowly while her hands were in the air, she'd comply until she found out who or what she was dealing with. Once she turned around she was staring into the face of a Skrull she didn't recognize. There were a few more surrounding her all of them holding energy guns. \"You're Skrull? What are you doing here?\" He looked confused for a moment, \"What do you mean? I'm asking the questions here, and you're in our home!\" \"Home? Oh thank god!\" She almost dropped her hands but put them back up quickly when they all growled at her. \"No you don't understand, I came here with more of your people. With General Talos. We've been searching for a home for them.\" \"Talos? That's impossible. Talos would never trust someone like you. Groala, what's your status?\" The leader of the group of Skrulls asked in his wrist communicator. \"You better come see this, boss.\" Another voice across the comms said. The lead Skrull nodded to his men and waved his gun to the side indicating for Carol to follow them. She did as he wanted her to do because she knew once they saw the other Skrull, everything would be solved. They walked back in the direction of the ship and Carol was relieved to see Talos talking with one of the Skrull apart of this new group. \"Are you Drago?\" Talos said when he saw the leader approaching. \"My name is Talos. You can let her go... she's been helping us, she's a friend.\" He nodded at Carol. The one called Drago dropped his gun and glared at Carol still, but it seemed he wouldn't be shooting her for now. She relaxed and gave him an \"I told you so\" smirk. Talos and Drago clasped hands together. \"General Talos, the last I heard you were in search of the FTL engine. What happened?\" Drago asked, while eyeing Carol and the ship they arrived on. Talos shifted in his stance and glanced back at ship when slowly, one by one, some of the others were emerging from the hangar. His wife and daughter locked eyes with him and then his wife searched fearfully around them, unsure of if it was safe to come out. The general waved for them to come to his side. \"Is there perhaps somewhere safe we can go to talk? We've been travelling for months.\" Drago smiled at Talos' daughter then back up at Talos, \"Of course. Follow me.\" Carol could tell Talos felt a weight lifted off his shoulders at discovering his own people here on this planet. The local Skrull led them to their settlement that was basic in design, they clearly had not been here longer than a couple years. There were huts built at the base of rocky and hilly terrain. It took them awhile to track down into the territory, but once they did they convened at a large hut like structure built into the side of a hill. It was mentioned the hut belonged to Drago, who had apparently found this planet and led a handful of refugees here with him. They all sat around Drago's table with his wife and his children were playing outside with Talos' daughter and the other children on the ship. After Talos and Carol explained the situation about their meeting, Mar-Vell, failed attempts to settle anywhere, and discovering this planet, Drago seemed to trust them more. \"We've been searching everywhere…\" Talos said emotionally after finishing his story. \"Your search is over. We call this planet Dara, it's got it's dangers, like any planet, but we've made it our home. It can be yours too.\" \"Yeah, quite a defense mechanism you've got.\" Carol stated referring to the asteroid field. Drago tilted his head, \"You mean the asteroids? Yes, it's kept us hidden for the most part. Unfortunately, we haven't been able to build any other defenses in the short time we've been here.\" \"We may be able to help with that. If we take some of the equipment from Mar-Vell's lab, we can build more defenses.\" Talos looked over to his 'science guy' for approval and received a nod from him. Drago and Talos eagerly exchanged more ideas on how to better prepare themselves and rebuild a home for their people. They ate and drank together for hours, and when Carol had grown tired, she left the hut. Outside the children were still playing. They played a game with a table and a few balls, it seemed the goal was to get the balls in the other teams holes. Not unlike pool. Carol stared at the scene in front of her and had another memory come back to her. Maria, Carol, a few of their friends from base, and a woman with brown hair were all sitting at a big table at Pancho's bar. They were celebrating Maria's birthday. Everyone already acted like fools because of the rounds of drinks they had. When Maria and another friend of hers by the name of Anthony challenged Carol and the brown haired woman next to her to a game of pool, her competitive side couldn't resist. The rules were losers had to buy the winners another round of drinks along with bragging rights, of course. \"Sam and I are going to beat your asses, just wait!\" Carol yelled over the music and watched as Maria tried to line up her shot. \"Pah! Put your money where your mouth is Danvers!\" Maria laughed and hit two solid colors into the holes. She raised her hands in the air and did a little dance. \"Don't be too scared now, Carol, we'll go easy on you two!\" She taunted. Carol grinned and glanced at the brown haired woman named Sam who rolled her eyes. \"Oh we're screwed,\" Sam said and took a big gulp from her beer. \"What have you gotten us into?\" \"Oh relax! I'm a pool mastermind, okay?\" Carol defended while grabbing a pool stick and readying herself. Sam rolled her eyes, but had a smile on her lips still. Carol was brought back to reality by Talos clapping a hand on her shoulder. \"Carol! I cannot thank you enough for helping us get here.\" \"It was the least I could do, Talos.\" She said genuinely, although her mind was still lingering on the memory, and especially now because she knew the woman she kept seeing was named Sam. \"Will you stay for a while?\" He finally asked. Carol nodded, she would stay as long as she needed to, to reassure herself that they would be safe on this planet. It appeared to be promising enough, but just in case there was any lurking danger she'd stay a bit longer. \"Yeah, of course I will. My job isn't done yet! Gotta make sure you don't get into any more trouble.\" She exclaimed while punching his shoulder lightly. \"What about Earth? Think it'll be safe enough without you?\" \"I think they can manage without me for now. And I'll return eventually. One thing at a time though, Talos.\"[Chapter 2] Six months passed since Talos, the refugee Skrull, and Carol landed on Dara. Things had quieted down quite a bit and the Skrull were starting to rebuild their lives. Carol felt a sense of pride that she could be part of helping the Skrull rebuild. But the longer she stayed, the more she felt that she was no longer needed. Talos included her in many things, and she went on a few missions to find more Skrull refugees, but overall they were handling things fine without her. When she came to that realization, she had told Talos as much and at first he wanted Carol to stay longer, but eventually he saw her point. Unable to say goodbye, she told him she would be back to check on them and if he needed her at all, to use the communication system built into her suit. That was a few days ago now. It didn't take her long to travel back to Earth thanks to her abilities. The first place she found herself was at Maria's. It was evening and the sun was setting. She hoped her best friend would be home and not at work. Outside the door, Carol hesitated to knock. Part of her was dreading seeing her best friend again because a whole year had passed since she told Maria and Monica that she'd be back before they knew it. Admittedly, she knew they probably understood that helping an alien race find a home world would take time but she still felt guilty. She sighed and knocked three times. Might as well get this over with… she thought. No one came immediately to the door, but after a few moments of standing there awkwardly it swung open revealing a wide-eyed Maria. \"Well, look what the flerken dragged in!\" Carol felt a huge grin erupt from her face at the sight of her best friend who luckily, seemed more surprised than anything to see her. \"How is Goose?\" \"Still a flerken, whatever that is exactly, but it's with Fury. He's taken on that responsibility.\" Maria stood to the side letting Carol pass. The two made some small chat before settling down on the couch facing each other. The blonde had her feet tucked on the couch and her arm on the back of the couch. Maria had a similar position as well. They laughed as they enjoyed a beer together. Maria had made sure to scold her best friend for her absence the last year. \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry! But I did promise to be back, didn't I?\" Carol quipped. Maria rolled her eyes, \"Okay next time we'll have to make how long you're going to be gone more clear.\" \"Where's Lieutenant Trouble?\" Carol asked, realizing she hadn't seen the young girl at all since she'd been back. Normally, the girl made her presence very known. Now, the house was quiet, save the two women talking and laughing together. \"She's with her grandparents. They've been planning a trip to the beach, and I need to work, so I told them just to go ahead without me. Plus, now that you're here it's probably a good thing I didn't go, or you'd send out a search party for us.\" Maria laughed at the last part, and Carol feigned ignorance. \"I would never do that!\" The blonde had said. Carol added a quick, \"How is she?\" Nodding several times Maria answered. \"She's a rockstar. Misses you like hell,\" at the last part Maria lightly punched Carol's outstretched arm on the back of the couch. They fell into a comfortable silence until Carol bit her bottom lip in deep thought. \"Hey,\" She started while setting her beer down. \"You still have my things, right?\" Maria nodded, \"Of course! Let me go get the box.\" She stood and retreated up the stairs. It only took her a moment to come back down the steps and drop a cardboard box in front of Carol who started rummaging through it. \"What are you looking for?\" \"Pictures mostly. I've started having flashes of someone named Sam? She seems important.\" Carol explained while going through some of the old pictures. Her best friend's eyes darted to the box and then to some of the pictures Carol was looking at. \"Hmm, Sam… oh! Samantha Pierce! Yeah I remember her, I only met her once because you brought her to the party we had at the bar, but you talked about her sometimes. Hang on…\" Maria grabbed a small book from the box that had even more pictures in it. She flipped through the pages with photographs placed in little sleeves until she found what she was searching for. \"Here! That's you and Sam at the bar that night.\" She handed Carol the book showing her the picture. Carol was standing beside Sam, both women holding a beer, and both had a big toothy grin. Sam stood a few inches shorter. She flipped to the next page and found another picture of them, this one was taken right after the first with Carol and Sam facing each other in a fit of laughter. Sam's face was wrinkled from smiling so big and her eyes were squinted in happiness. Carol saw herself equally as happy. She smiled down at the picture. \" Oh my God! My beer is everywhere!\" Carol couldn't believe Sam had actually tapped the top of her beer bottle with the bottom of hers causing the beer to foam up and explode out of the bottle. She started laughing at Sam trying to contain her giggles. The camera flashed. \" You should've seen your face!\" Sam said in between laughter, her face was going red from it. \"Please tell me you got that on camera!\" Maria took the photo out and waved it around getting it to develop faster. She glanced at it, \"Damn! A second too late!\" Sam took the photo from her and examined it, squinting her eyes because it was not quite developed yet. \"Aww, well I tried.\" She gave Carol a sly grin and twisted her body back and forth innocently. \" You're an asshole. I'm glad it wasn't caught on camera!\" Carol couldn't help but laugh at the situation and playfully shove Sam's shoulder. As Carol stared down at the photo she touched her lips in thought, \"I remember this day… it was your birthday and we went bowling after this too, right?\" Maria nodded and smiled in remembrance, \"Yeah, one of the best birthdays ever. Besides busting my ass on the bowling aisle because we were all very drunk by that time. You had insisted that we do something extravagant because I told you birthdays were never a huge deal when I was little.\" Carol laughed, she knew that sounded exactly like something she'd do. \"So… who is this Sam girl?\" Maria pursed her lips and shrugged her shoulders slightly, \"Well, like I said that was the first day I ever met her. You came up to me and asked if you could bring a friend with you, and of course, I had no problem with it. You said you met her when you were younger and had recently reconnected, but that's all you told me.\" The blonde nodded slowly and furrowed her brow trying to remember anything useful. It bugged her that she couldn't remember, and the only reason it was eating away at her that much was because of the strange ache in her chest. It was different from seeing flashes of Dr. Lawson. She admired Lawson and felt a strong urge to figure out who she was because the Skrull had been after her as well, but it didn't go beyond that. Whoever this Sam person was, it felt way more personal, she missed her. \"You okay?\" Carol blinked several times and nodded, \"Oh yeah, just… thinking.\" Maria gave her a stern glare and crossed her arms. Carol knew that look. It was the look of a mother scolding or trying to get information out of a child. \"You might be an all-powerful superhero now, but I still know you enough to know something is wrong.\" She sighed in mock annoyance then smiled, \"Fine. It's just so frustrating that I can't remember everything about my life here. It's coming back slowly, and I've noticed certain things will jog my memory, but…\" Carol sighed deeply, she wasn't sure how she could explain how any of it actually felt. If Sam was just a friend then why did she miss her so much? And why did she get butterflies in her stomach when a memory of her came to mind? \"I'm sorry, Carol. I know it must be pretty tough feeling in the dark about your own life.\" Maria touched her shoulder in a reassuring gesture which she appreciated. \"Wait. She's not an alien like Mar-Vell, right? Because I don't know if I can handle another situation like last year,\" she joked, lightening the mood some. Carol snickered, she highly doubted that was the case but then again she couldn't be completely certain. She sarcastically said, \"Can't imagine why, we had fun last year! Real best friend bonding time. And you got to go to space , remember?\" Her best friend laughed for a moment and then seemed to have an epiphany. \"You know what? Let's find Samantha and you can ask her all the questions you want! You started remembering things when you came and found me, so maybe it'll be the same.\" She opened a drawer in a little stand by the couch and pulled out a phone book. The amount of admiration Carol had for Maria increased tenfold, she was so lucky to have a best friend like her. \"Okay… well the good news is, I found a Samantha Pierce. The bad news is, there's eighteen of them within a hundred mile radius. Let's start calling.\" Maria shrugged and picked up her long corded phone from the same table she pulled the phone book out of. \"While I'm calling, check the web for any Samantha Pierce's. It'll take a minute to start up the computer and web, but then you should just be able to search it.\" Carol nodded and walked over to the huge computer, grimacing at the loud fan sounds and strange clicking noises coming from the inside. She still couldn't believe how far behind technology on Earth was. And Maria had not been kidding when she said it could take a while to start up. \"Two hours later…\" she muttered when the screen finally opened to a search bar. She awkwardly typed \"SAMANTHA PIERCE\" into the search bar and pressed the enter key. The first result was of an Arts studio for all ages. She clicked on the blue link and waited, what felt like 10 solid minutes, for the web page to load up. Once it did, Carol saw the studio was a learning center for all things considered the arts. It offered voice lessons, music lessons, sculpting lessons, and painting/drawing lessons. She scrolled down the page and noticed a little corner down at the bottom listed all the instructors. Bingo! Samantha Pierce was listed as the painting and drawing teacher. It had a blurry image of her next to her name. \"Hey Maria, I think I've got something!\" Carol called into the living room where Maria was still calling numbers. The other woman came in and leaned over Carol's shoulder to stare at the screen. \"An art studio?\" \"Look-\" Carol pointed to the name listed, \"it's Samantha Pierce, she's an instructor here.\" \"Well I'll be damned… investing in a home computer wasn't a total waste then,\" Maria chuckled. \"This thing is too damn slow,\" Carol waved her hand at the bulky machine, and Maria nodded enthusiastically in agreement. Maria traced her finger over the screen where an address was listed, wrote it down on a sticky note, \"That's the address.\" Carol stared down at the note and read the address. She felt anxious about it now that she actually had a lead to potentially find Sam and being able to ask her questions about who she was to her. \"Thanks, Maria. This means a lot.\" \"Now, let's grab food before I starve. There's a local place that makes the best burger you've ever had.\" Maria's eyes got wider trying to emphasize how good the burgers were. Carol agreed to go thinking it would be a good distraction for now. And spending time with Maria was always a blast, anyways. They took Maria's camaro even though Carol insisted she could just fly both of them there. \"That's the ultimate cheat.\" Maria had argued, so eventually Carol gave it up and let herself be driven like a barbaric. She made sure to tell Maria the barbaric part too, which earned her a death glare. The local place Maria referred to was a hole-in-the-wall looking shack with a huge neon burger light over the door. Carol glanced at her friend skeptically, \"This place? Really?\" \"Yes really, these places are the best kind!\" Maria exclaimed, \"Just come on.\" She chuckled at the face Carol made and got out of the car. Reluctantly, Carol followed her friend inside and was pleasantly surprised that the inside was much cleaner than the outside. It was a seat yourself place, so Maria led Carol to a booth by the window. Shortly after they sat down the waitress came over and took their drink order and Maria went ahead with ordering two of their house special burgers. \"Less wait time.\" She had reasoned, \"And you'll love it trust me!\" Carol chose to trust her friend on that one. She noticed out of the corner of her eye someone with long brown hair and a stature similar to Sam's. Her head turned twice in a double take, but after closer examination, she realized it wasn't the woman from her flashes. The restaurant morphed before Carol's eyes to a slightly different color and there were ghosts of people in booths that weren't actually there. She furrowed her brow. \" God how many pancakes can you eat, woman?\" Carol heard herself ask the person sitting across from her. Sam's face glanced up at her, \"As many as you put in front of me.\" She said with a wry smile. Carol really had no idea how she was as tiny as she was with an appetite like that. \"Well stop staring at me, geez.\" \" I can't, I feel like I'm witnessing something groundbreaking here,\" Carol quipped earning a glare from the other woman. Sam wadded up her straw paper and threw it at Carol. It bounced off her arm and landed in her drink. \"Hey!\" She gave Sam a surprised face and couldn't suppress her laughter as much as she tried. \" It's what you deserve!\" \"Ma'am?\" Carol noticed her food was now in front of her so she turned her head to the waitress who was waiting on something. \"Sorry, what?\" \"Did you need a refill on your drink?\" She asked patiently while gesturing to Carol's half empty glass. \"Oh! Yes, thank you.\" Carol could almost still see the wadded up straw paper still in her drink, but she knew there was nothing actually there. Maria was giving her a skeptical eye. She waited until the waitress was gone to ask, \"Did you see another memory?\" She nodded and took a bite of her burger, \"Yea- holy shit, you were right about this place!\" Carol mumbled due to the burger still in her mouth. Maria nodded and shot her an 'I told you so' look while she took a huge bite of her own burger. \"What did I tell you?\" \"Sorry I doubted you! Anyways, yes, I was remembering a time when Sam and I were somewhere sort of similar to this place…\" \"So no clues?\" Maria's eyebrows turned upward. Carol shook her head, \"Other than if you consider her huge appetite for pancakes a clue, then no.\" She sighed. \"Hey, I'm sure things will start making sense when you meet with her.\" Maria placed a reassuring hand on her arm from across the table. Carol nodded hoping her friend was right. Out of the corner of her eye, Carol saw a man dressed in all black and wearing a black fedora with sunglasses on… in a restaurant. He sat in a booth across on the other side of the room. The way he held the menu up to his face was also very peculiar. She narrowed her eyes at him, and he retreated further behind the menu. Carol stood abruptly and walked over to him confidently. She snatched the menu away from his face, revealing none other than Nick Fury. \"Fury. I see you haven't gotten much better at the covert part of your job.\" Fury sighed in defeat and pursed his lips, \"And neither have you.\" He retorted. \"Do you know how many people reported seeing a \"strange glowing thing' flying in the sky?\" She sat down opposite Fury and her eyes went to the right, \"So?\" \"So?\" He repeated, \"So that means my bosses sent me here to tell you to turn the light show off.\" \"And here I thought you missed me,\" she pouted. \"How did your bosses even know it was me? Could've been anything!\" \"There's only one strange glowing flying thing that we know of,\" he hesitated. \"...There also might've been a very clear picture with you flying in it. Cameras these days are getting clearer and clearer.\" The last part he muttered more to himself. Carol shrugged, \"What's the problem?\" Fury took off his sunglasses revealing one eye to have a patch over it which Carol wrinkled her face at. Had Goose's scratch really done that much damage to Fury's eyes? \"The problem is we don't want a public panic that we have been visited by aliens .\" He whispered the last part so no one in the restaurant would hear. \"Ah, don't worry next time I'll fly faster!\" Carol jested, she enjoyed pushing Fury's buttons. \"Since your cover has been blown, come join us. We can catch up.\" Fury and Carol went back to the table with Maria who seemed amused at the whole situation after Fury explained why he was even there. \"Things have gotten real sensitive at S.H.I.E.L.D since the Skrull invaded. They've been on extra high alert. Mostly because when you and Talos left, there were a few of Talos' soldiers left that we thought were dead. They banded together and starting infiltrating the higher ups to find information about us.\" Fury explained. \"Do you know where they are? I can get them into contact with Talos and he'll call them off.\" Carol asked now in serious mode. \"Well that's the problem, we don't know who they have shapeshifted into,\" Fury sighed and leaned forward on the table stealing a few fries from Carol's plate. \"By the way, if you're back I assume that means you found them a home world?\" She narrowed her eyes at him threateningly and swatted his hand away. \"Yes, they found a place to settle down. Somewhere safe. But if I can help you find these rogue Skrull, I'm sure I can convince them to leave and rejoin their people.\" Fury stood, \"I'll keep in touch then. Try to lay low, for my sake.\" Carol grinned as Fury walked away. \"By the way, I dig the patch.\" Carol said while pointing to the eyepatch over his eye. Fury smirked confidently, \"Everyone does.\" After the two women finished eating they went back to Maria's house. Carol knew the art studio would be closed at this hour so Maria insisted she stay the night. She complied and put a few blankets on the couch to sleep on. It took a few minutes for her to shut her brain off because hearing that they left behind a few Skrull soldiers was an unpleasant feeling. Between the Skrull and potentially meeting Sam tomorrow, Carol was starting to get a tad worried. She sighed and turned to lay on her side hoping to get more comfortable. Eventually, sleep crept up and she closed her eyes.[Chapter 3] Carol stared at the canvas, her brushstrokes were thick and uneven, and the colors melded together in an unpleasant way. She used a variety of blues, yellows, oranges, and purples but her goal of creating a sunset casting shadows over the mountains went horribly wrong. Now, the canvas was a mess of colors. \" I told you painting was not my strong suit,\" she pointed out to the woman standing over her shoulder observing her masterpiece. They were in a small studio apartment with paintings hung up on the walls. The canvas was set up in the corner by a window and Carol sat on a stool directly in front of it. Sam stared at the canvas in a perplexed way, \"There are truly no words…\" she said while raising her eyebrows. \"So you should definitely stick to flying planes.\" Carol shoved her playfully and feigned hurt. \"You have to admit it's unique, though.\" The brunette chuckled cutely, \"Yeah, unique would be one way to describe it.\" She stared at it a bit longer, \"Hmm, maybe it's growing on me?\" \" See, I'm a true artist,\" she tipped her chin up and closed her eyes. She could feel the eye roll Sam gave in response. \" Why do I put up with you?\" She asked while staring into Carol's eyes. There was the slightest of smiles on her lips, and Carol felt her face heat up and heart pound from the intensity of Sam's eyes. It didn't help that her eyes were absolutely beautiful. She likened the feeling to being stared at by a celebrity crush. Part of her wanted to look away, but her dangerous side wouldn't let her. Finally, Sam cleared her throat and averted her eyes. Carol watched as the smaller woman grabbed her sketchbook and pencils from the table. She sat down in front of Carol. \" Alright, stay still.\" She demanded and her brow furrowed in a deep focus. \" Bossy.\" Carol stood on the sidewalk in a busy little town in Louisiana. Across the street was an older rundown building with a shop and bakery attached on either side. There was white paint on the windows that read Learning Arts Studio and an open sign was blinking above the door. So this is the place… she thought. She stared down at the sticky note Maria had given her of the address it had only taken her an hour by car to get to. After her conversation with Fury, she figured flying would just make his life more difficult and Maria had been happy to let her borrow the camaro. Her heart rate was faster than normal as she walked across the street, and she was psyching herself up for whatever was to come next. Carol walked into the art studio in her very signature confident manner, even though she was a nervous wreck on the inside. The studio was quiet besides a piano playing and faint voices singing along somewhere near the back of the building. She glanced down the hall, the building was bigger than it looked from the outside. The walls were white with art pieces hung up to throw splashes of color here and there. The paintings were quite beautiful. The receptionist held Carol with a curious gaze, \"May I help you?\" She asked politely. She was an elderly woman with stringy blonde hair and glasses at the end of her pointed nose. \"Yes. I'm looking for Samantha Pierce.\" Carol stated simply and put her hands on the tall wooden counter. She glanced at the receptionist name plate on the counter, her name was Anna. \"Oh, are you one of the new students?\" Anna asked in a sweet voice. Carol wrinkled her nose a bit, \"What? No, no I'm not. I'm just looking for Sam… uh, Samantha. Does she work here?\" \"Yes, but she's in a class right now. If you want to speak with her you'll have to come back later I'm afraid.\" Carol had to admit she was a little disappointed to hear that, but she had nothing better to do than sit around and wait. Well, besides stopping the remaining Skrull. \"How long will it be?\" She asked, she silently hoped it wouldn't be long, she was eager to get this mystery solved. \"It will be about fifteen more minutes. Give me a moment and I'll let her know she has someone waiting for her, okay? What name can I give her?\" Carol panicked, she wasn't sure if giving her name would be the best idea considering she had no clue how this interaction would go and she technically was pronounced dead 7 years ago. \"Oh, um… I'm actually an old friend of hers trying to surprise her…\" she said slowly, coming up with the excuse on the spot. Technically it's not a lie, though. Anna smiled, \"How lovely! In the years Sam has worked here she doesn't get many personal visitors… but I'll just be a moment!\" She stood and walked hunched over down the hallway where many doors were located, Carol assumed they were classrooms. Anna went into a room far into the hallway on the right and then came back out a few seconds later. \"Okay I let her know for you, dear!\" \"Great, thank you! I'll just wait here.\" She say down on one of the wooden benches that had comfortable red cushions. For a few moments she just sat there staring around at the studio before Anna smiled at her and said, \"How long have you known Miss Samantha?\" \"Oh um,\" I have no idea , she thought. \"A little while now.\" She answered vaguely. Anna smiled and began in a reminiscent voice, \"I remember when I was about your age, my best friend Han surprised me at a play I was in by throwing flowers on the stage for me… it was so thoughtful…\" Carol smiled too, she loved when older people told stories about a time in their life. She thought this Han character sounded more like someone trying for her affection, though.\"That sounds very nice!\" she said. They fell into silence again for a bit. \"Where is your restroom?\" Carol glanced around seeing if she could find the restroom sign, but it was nowhere upfront as far as she could tell. Anna pointed down the hall, \"It's just down the hall and to the left. It'll be the first door on the right.\" Carol nodded in appreciation and went down the hall, she slowed her steps as she walked near the door she had seen the receptionist go through. She pulled down on her S.H.I.E.L.D cap Fury had given her, and peered into the room. Luckily the door had a long rectangular window, so she could see well into the room. It was an art room with canvases set up and young and older people were all painting at a station while a woman was walking around checking their work. Carol's breath hitched in her throat, it was the woman from her flashes of memory, Samantha Pierce, or Sam, as she had heard herself call her in her flashes of memories. She looked relatively the same as Carol saw her in her memories. She wore jeans and a flowing black shirt, and her hair was pulled back in a messy bun. Her beautiful eyes scanned the others' work and her smile made Carol's heart skip. She smiled lightly to herself, the woman seemed at ease and happy. Sam must have sensed someone watching her because her head turned towards the door and the pair locked eyes for a second. Sam's face went pale and her eyes widened. Shit! Carol ducked down out of the way and bolted to the restroom, she definitely had not wanted Sam to see her before she had a chance to really explain what was going on. She had looked terrified when she saw her staring through the window. Granted, anyone would probably be startled seeing someone staring at them like that. Not long after Carol went into the stalls did the restroom door open and someone breathed deeply. When Carol came out of the stall, Sam was standing in front of the mirror and leaning over the sink splashing water on her face. Panicking, Carol went back and forth in her brain about what to do. This was her moment to say something, but now that Sam was physically standing in front of her, she started losing her nerve. She couldn't explain how this felt, she had never run from anything in her life. Before she could figure out what to do, Sam wiped her face with her hands and saw Carol standing there. She froze on the spot. \"Samantha?\" \"Oh god, not this again. You aren't real… you aren't real…\" she started muttering quietly and closing her eyes. \"No wait I'm real! It's me, Carol.\" Carol said trying to ease the panicking woman. It helped very little, though. Sam went to the door to try and open it, but Carol grabbed her arm as gently as she could to stop her. The other woman's head snapped around, her face wrinkled in confusion, and she stared down at Carol's hand grabbing her then stared into her eyes. When their eyes met Sam instantly calmed for a moment. \"Carol?\" Her voice was barely over a whisper and she squinted her eyes as if trying to see through any deception. \"But- that's impossible.\" \"Yeah, it's me. Well, sort of…\" Carol let go of the woman's arm suddenly realizing their closeness and thinking it inappropriate even though it felt normal, \"I don't remember a lot of things. Just bits and pieces.\" \"What? No, you died in a crash! How are you here?!\" Sam exclaimed, Carol hoped she wouldn't start panicking again but she could see Sam was on the verge of losing it. \"It's kind of a long story, let me take twenty minutes of your time… please? I have a lot of questions and I'm sure you do too.\" Carol watched the woman process her words, she was hesitating but not immediately saying no which meant she had to be considering it. Finally, Sam sighed and nodded curtly, \"Fine… but I'm gonna need a drink.\" Trust me you'll need it… Carol thought but decided against saying it out loud. She really hoped Sam would take the news as good as Maria had, but she had a strange feeling that things would be more complicated than that. Judging from her facial expression, Sam still wasn't even convinced she was real. \"Whiskey, on the rocks.\" Sam told the bartender once the two woman had sat down at the local bar. Carol watched as he set it down in front of her and she took the glass in her hands, downed the whole glass of whiskey, slammed the glass back on the counter, and waved her hand for another. Carol had to admit she was impressed and worried at the same time. \"So let me get this straight… you didn't die in the crash, you absorbed the blast's energy which gave you superpowers, and then an alien race called the Kree abducted you and erased your memories to make you into a soldier to fight against the Skrull, who aren't actually evil alien terrorists.\" Sam toyed with her next glass of whiskey while she tried to piece through the bizarre story. Carol tipped her head to the side in thought, \"Yeah, that's pretty much everything.\" Sam chuckled bitterly, and she down the rest of her whiskey again waving her hand for another. \"This must be some sort of sick joke…\" she muttered and downed yet another glass of whiskey. \"Didn't know my imagination could fabricate such a bizarre story…\" Carol furrowed her brow and shook her head, \"Well, from what I remember you did have quite the imagination. But I promise, you're not imagining things. This is real.\" Sam stared at her for a moment considering her, and Carol felt hot under the woman's eyes. \"So you said you don't remember everything? What does that mean exactly?\" Sam was testing her she realized, trying to figure out if Carol was the real thing. She thought it ironic because she was doing the same thing with people seeing if they were Skrull or not the first time she came back to Earth. \"Well, like I said the Kree erased my memories of everything here on Earth and it wasn't until I came here last year that I realized I had a life here… so I started remembering things little by little.\" Sam seemed perplexed, \"So you don't know who I am at all?\" Carol grimaced, \"I've seen you in... flashes… which helped me find you, but it doesn't really go beyond that. All of the memories I have of you are good ones, though. I just can't remember how we met, how close we were, how long we knew each other… that sort of thing.\" \"All you see is flashes? What do you see?\" Sam asked hesitantly. Carol swallowed, she had been waiting to ask her about what exactly it was that she was seeing and maybe get some answers about who she was to her. \"The most recurring one is seeing you, smiling and laughing, and we're at the beach together on the top of a cliff looking down at a pretty great view. I wanted to ask you about these memories that I have, see if you can help me piece them together? Please, Sam.\" \"That's…\" Carol could see her start to sway slightly from the whiskey and she sighed heavily. Sam paused and pursed her lips then she smiled a little, \"You're probably remembering the time I tried to surprise you with a trip to the beach, except halfway there you guessed where we were going. That was one of the most annoying things about you, I could never surprise you with anything because you'd guess it immediately.\" She rolled her eyes but smiled fondly. Carol smiled too, she still couldn't remember everything but the feeling in her chest told her she cared about Sam. \"Seems like something I'd do, I am a genius after all,\" she said humorously. The other woman stared at her then tore her eyes away chuckling as she did, \"Yeah that's exactly what you would tell me back then too…\" Sam got a sort of far off look in her eye like she was reliving those moments. Carol really didn't want to interrupt her reminiscing, but she was dying to say more. Finally, she broke the silence and broke whatever train of thought Sam was in, \"Can I ask you something?\" \"You just did,\" She quipped. It was Carol's turn to roll her eyes and smile, \"Okay, smartass-\" Sam raised her eyebrows in mock surprise and took another sip of her whiskey. \"Wow, already with the name calling!\" She had said, but Carol ignored it. \"Who are you to me?\" Sam almost spit out her drink and after clearing her throat she cocked her head to the side and narrowed her eyes at Carol. \"I'm not sure you're ready for that answer.\" \"What do you mean?\" Sam turned in her bar stool and faced Carol, \"Listen, Danvers… if you're telling the truth about everything, which I highly doubt, then prove it.\" She knew Sam was trying to change the subject, but maybe once she fully believed her, Sam would open up about more. Carol gave her a sly smile, Sam really had no idea her mind was about to be blown. \"You sure you're ready for that?\" The other woman just stared intently at her, so Carol shrugged and stood up. \"Alright, come on.\" The brunette slapped some money down on the counter and followed Carol outside albeit a little wobbly. Carol made her way to the side of the building where no one was watching, remembering Fury's words to lay low, and smirked at Sam who seemed very confused. \"You're not planning on murdering me out here are you? When I said prove it, that's not what I had in mind.\" The other woman jested. \"Just watch.\" And just like that Carol used her powers to float a few inches off the ground and let her body glow brightly with energy. She was satisfied with the open mouthed, gaping stare Sam was giving her. When she landed again and stopped glowing she crossed her arms in a confident way. \"I must be drunk… that's got to be it…\" Sam breathed, \"how did you…? You mean… your whole story is true ?\" \"Yup.\" Carol popped the p, and stood there waiting on Sam's many facial expressions as she worked through what her eyes just witnessed. Her mouth opened and closed trying to say something but changing her mind at the last second. \"Alright, now your turn. How do we know each other?\" Sam swallowed audibly and she was hesitant to answer. Once she recovered from whatever shock she was in, \"We met for the first time before you went to basic training and then we reconnected a little over a year before… your crash.\" Carol stepped onto the plane and took her seat next to the window. She had been glad to get a window seat even though she was flying economy, it was a rare occurrence for sure. Her stomach felt queasy with every moment as she waited for the rest of the passengers. She loved plane rides, just being in the air felt amazing, but pretty soon she'd be on a base in a place she had no friends and no family. It was an exciting and terrifying thought. She heard someone sit down next to her before she saw them. They huffed as they sat and began fiddling with something that sounded like a pill bottle. Carol glanced over to see a younger woman probably about her age with brunette hair and tanned skin cupping two white pills in her hand and pop them in her mouth. She swallowed them dry and sighed. The announcements came on about plane safety in the case of an emergency. When they stopped, Carol noticed the girl beside her start shaking her leg up and down. \" You good?\" Carol asked with a half concerned, half humored expression. The woman looked at her and smiled sheepishly, \"Nervous flyer.\" She said and tilted her head to the side in a cute way. Carol raised her eyebrows and nodded slowly. The plane began to move forward on the runway and then tilted back and into the air. The woman clasped the seat in a tight white-knuckle grip, she hadn't noticed Carol's hand was on the same armrest. She bit back a laugh at how tight the woman was squeezing, she didn't want to embarrass her so she just let it happen. \" Oh god, I'm so sorry!\" The woman exclaimed when the plane leveled out some and she loosened her grip. Carol laughed and extended her fingers to make sure they still worked. \"It's no problem! One hell of a grip you got there, though.\" She laughed at the woman's mortified facial expression. \"Really, it's okay.\" \" I'm sorry I'm not normally like this, flights just make me anxious.\" The woman gripped the seat armrest again when the plane dropped a tad bit. Carol examined her closely, making sure she didn't puke or have an seemed on the verge of both. \"What's your name?\" She thought if she asked her questions, maybe it would take her mind off of the flight. The other woman's eyes locked with hers, Carol just now noticed they were a beautiful hazel color. \"Samantha- well, everyone calls me Sam. Yours?\" Shifting her weight to face her more, Carol answered, \"Carol. So are you traveling for pleasure or business?\" \" Uh, a little bit of both actually. What about you?\" She asked, genuinely curious. Carol smiled, \"Same. I'm in the Air Force going through basic training soon. What do you do for a living?\" Sam had placed her hand under her chin while she listened to Carol, the conversation seemed to be working in calming her down. \"You do have the look…\" Carol furrowed her brow in confusion and the girl elaborated, \"the military look. Both my parents were part of the army so I know the look pretty well. You have it.\" As much as Carol appreciated the compliment she had to admit she was curious what the \"look\" actually was. \"What kind of 'look' is that?\" She air quoted. When she asked, Sam grinned and appeared slightly embarrassed. Finally she replied, \"It's a very confident person, someone strong, and not just physically, but mentally… sturdy.\" Sam blushed as she said it and couldn't keep eye contact for long. Carol raised an eyebrow in amusement. \"That's quite the reading from ten minutes having known me.\" Sam shrugged and smiled mischievously, \"I can just tell. It's a talent.\" The blonde laughed. \"Okay, if you say so! But nonetheless I will take the compliment, thank you.\" She chuckled, \"So where are you from?\" Sam held her head up to the roof of the plane and squinted her eyes deep in thought. \"Originally? Born in California, moved around a lot as a kid, and now I'm living in Louisiana. What about you?\" \" Born and raised in California!\" Carol said proudly. She was going to say more but the plane hit some turbulence causing Sam to stiffen up. Carol reached into her bag and pulled out a small bag of peanuts and handed them to Sam. \"Here, they help a lot with the nerves.\" At first, Sam eyed them clearly unconvinced but when the plane shook one more time she quickly accepted them and began popping them into her mouth much like she did with the pills. \"Thanks.\" She said with her mouth full of peanuts. Carol smiled and the two women continued to talk and laugh for the rest of the flight. When they parted ways, they exchanged phone numbers shyly before going their separate ways. \"I remember… nervous flyer…\" Carol laughed absentmindedly and she remembered the butterflies in her stomach when they had exchanged numbers. She had chalked it up to excitement about finding a new friend, but deep down she suspected it was more than that. Sam laughed showing her teeth. \"Yeah… you calmed me down a lot that day. Without you, I probably would've had a panic attack.\" Carol smiled and her heart swelled, \"Well, couldn't have you starting a panic on the plane, could I?\" Her quip was met with a cute laugh from Sam. The other woman made her way to a bench that was on the outside on the side of the building at the bar. \"You mentioned we reconnected? What happened? Why did we lose touch?\" She asked while sitting down next to the woman. Sam rubbed her face with her hands and sighed, she stared at the ground for a second before answering. \"We still talked occasionally, I'd call you or you'd call me from base if we both had the time, which was rare. But for the most part we could never actually hang out in person, so we just… drifted apart. It was crazy coincidence that we ever met again after that.\" Carol waited for her to finish the story and tell her how they reconnected, but the other woman stayed silent. She was feeling the effects of all that whiskey Carol could tell because her eyes were more squinted and her speech had a slight drag to it, but not by much. As much as Carol wanted to get answers and rediscover some of her memories, she was more worried about Sam now. \"Hey, maybe you should get some rest? I know this can't be how you thought your day would go.\" Sam laughed and her words were sarcastic, \"Which part? The dead coming back to life or the alien part? I at least expected one of those today.\" She shook her head slightly then head a hand to her temple like she suddenly got dizzy, \"Yeah, I'm gonna get the bartender to call me a cab.\" Before Sam could walk away Carol stopped her, she still had so many questions, \"Can I see you again tomorrow?\" Again, Sam hesitated for a moment before she finally nodded, \"Sure, meet me back at the studio same time as you did today.\" Carol watched as Sam retreated into the bar. She decided not to follow her as it might be considered a title creepy that she had basically followed her around all day. The time they spent in the bar talking together was long enough for the sun to have been replaced by the moon in the sky. Carol stayed at the bench for a minute longer until she saw two men in black suits off in the distance. They stuck out since everyone else she saw in this town was dressed way more casually. She began walking towards them, but when they noticed her they sped up and walked into a neighboring bar across the street. She jogged to catch up and entered the bar. She searched the crowd but found no one that resembled the men she had just seen. Her face showed her annoyance because a random guy came up and asked why she was \"so angry\" and \"life wasn't that bad\" and he could \"help her relax.\" She ignored him as she normally did with this sort of behavior. He eventually left her alone only after asking at least three times to buy her a drink and give him a chance. Carol walked around the bar until she was sure she lost the suspicious figures. When she walked back outside, a cab was picking up Sam. The other woman noticed Carol at the last minute and waved from inside the cab. Carol smiled and waved back. She looked forward to seeing Sam again. For now, she went to the closest motel to rent a room for the night seeing it pointless to drive all the way back to Maria's house and then back again tomorrow. Her mind briefly wandered to the two men she saw earlier. She thought maybe they were S.H.I.E.L.D agents sent to keep an eye on her by Fury, or even Fury's superiors. Or worse, they could be the Skrull Fury mentioned. Either way, she would keep a sharp lookout for them again. Whoever they were, they acted suspiciously and Carol wanted to ask them a few questions.

Alex gasped as he threw his heavy bag on the floor, and gazed around as he stroked a lock of hair out of his face. Nigel snorted, and pursed his lips concentrated while rushing towards Mr. Forbes his desk – in fact Alex his father's. 'Get yourself something to drink.' Nigel didn't reply on his command, and just narrowed his eyes, kneeling down in front of the drawer from the desk. 'It must be here somewhere,' he muttered as he crouched in front of the drawer. After some pulls he realized it was well locked, and there would be no way to open it unless they owned the key. 'It's locked.' Alex clenched his teeth as he loosened his tie, opening the first button of his shirt after. He snorted as well. In some large steps he stood next to Nigel behind the desk, and sank through his knees as well to look at the drawer just like Nigel did. 'Any pick-locking skills?' Nigel shook his head, what made Alex reply with a dissatisfied mumble. 'Get up and stand right beside me, I can might open it with…' he shoved his hand into his pocket and got out a piece of wire, 'this.' Nigel smirked and shoved his arms over each other. 'First, Jack, since when do you keep a piece of wire in your pocket. And second, it's impossible to unlock that drawer with that. It only works in films.' Alex rolled with his eyes and shooed him away to push the wire into the lock afterwards. Obviously Nigel was right, as always. It wasn't working at all, and he started to wonder why in fact he even kept trying. He heard how a short chuckle escaped Nigel his throat – all because of amusement – and Alex sighed irritated as he pressed himself up, staring at Nigel rather annoyed. 'You're aware of the fact we need that fucking paper that's hidden inside of there, aye?' Nigel pressed his lips into a serious line now, and suddenly didn't find it amused at all. Alex shook his head and walked away now, getting to his dad his dresser where the bottles of alcohol stood. 'I'm not drinking that,' Nigel immediately refused against Alex his intentions. Alex just smirked, and pretended like he couldn't hear it – pouring in two glasses to almost the edge what made him spoil some on the ground as he picked them up. 'Jack, no, stop it!' Nigel walked straight up to him, and wanted to pull the glasses out of Alex his hands. Nevertheless, instead of Alex jumping aside all cheeky, he pressed his lips almost violently upon Nigel's, and so before Nigel knew it he gave in. Alex tried to put away the glasses, back on the dresser without looking, but failed and so dropped them on the ground – not caring about the glasses clattering over the floor as they broke into thousand pieces. Nigel startled for just a second, but grinned as soon as he kept his thoughts to Alex his warm lips again, and accepted the kiss by gently kissing back – folding his hands under Alex his jawline who pulled him closer. 'Since when did you get so affective?' he mumbled against Alex his lips. Alex smirked cause of that, and simply shrugged as he pulled back a bit. 'Since I finally realize what my real desires are.' A hitch in Nigel his voice got audible, and his cheeks turned red immediately. 'What did you just say?' He slowly pulled back and stared at Alex now, seeing how the familiar cheeky, handsome grin appeared on his face. 'Since I finally realize what my real desires are,' Alex repeated cockier. 'What are you implying? What are your real desires?' Nigel his voice was soft, and almost girlish – showing that he felt really shy right now, and somehow even showed some weakness of being uncertain about this situation. 'I want you,' Alex answered honestly. 'Right here, right now.' Another hitch got audible in Nigel his voice, and he batted his eyes – not daring to look at Alex anymore since his head had turned all red what made him feel embarrassed. 'I want you too,' Nigel replied with a small voice now. 'I mean, we need to open that drawer, Jack. We need that paper. I-' He gasped for air and shook his head. 'I don't want to lose you. Not again.' Alex pressed his lips and batted his eyes as well now, holding his breath while walking back toward the desk to try it another time. Again he failed. Nigel stood next to him and pursed his lips rather disappointed, turning his face toward the window as he sighed. Alex got up, leaning against the desk as he tried to keep himself from sighing frustrated as well. He pulled back his head now so he could stare down at Nigel his face, and titled his head as this twinkle appeared in his eyes. 'I don't want you to feel like this,' he muttered then, apparently caring. \"I don't feel like anything,\" Nigel replied, even if it wasn't true. He was trying not to feel anything at least. Still, Alex didn't seem to buy it. That didn't mean Nigel expected him to say what he said then, though. 'I can give you a head, if you like?' His eyes stood serious, but optimistic, and for a second he looked down. Before Nigel could even ask what it was, giving some one head, Alex gasped for air to clear him out. 'It's a blowjob, to comfort you,' he continued. \"A what?\" Nigel asked, confused when Alex offered him a head, thinking of an actual head. He actually was up for getting himself another skull. But that's not what Alex meant, - what he did mean was even more surprising. For a second Alex went through his knees, as if he was really attempting to give him head any moment, and his fingers fold around the button of his pants. As his knees met the solid floor, a soft sigh escaped his throat, and he chortled - barely audible. \"Jeez..- Don't!\" Nigel called, jumping back while putting his palm against Alex' head, - as if he though he had to hold him back forcefully or something. He more or less calmed down when Alex started to laugh and Nigel realised he'd been joking – or at least he hoped so. He didn't laugh himself, though.. For a moment he thought he was ending up in one of those horrid hallucinations again. \"- Don't ever do that again,\" Nigel sighed, letting go of Alex again. \"It's not funny.\" ... Okay perhaps it was. Alex chortled softly, and tilted his head amused after he got released from Nigel his hand. He smirked. In seconds he got up, and before Nigel could actually realize what was going on, he pressed his lips back on his again. Gently he kissed his soft pouted lips, licking the pink skin after while stroking his jaw. 'Don't worry,' Alex breathed. Nigel wanted to throw back another comment, but lost all of his words as soon as he felt the warm adrenaline rushing through his stomach. His voice trembled as he lightly shook his head, and said 'I don't.' 'Good,' Alex briefly replied, moving further down Nigel his neck while rubbing the tip of his tongue along Nigel his pale skin. A sensitive spot. A hitch got audible in Nigel his breath again, and he closed his eyes as he dropped his head in his neck – revealing more skin so Alex could kiss more space if he wanted to. In fact, Nigel practically begged him to by a moan that escaped his throat unknowingly. 'You getting wet?' Alex teased as he sucked against his skin, leaving a hickey at a perfect spot. 'Do I what?' Nigel questioned in a light panic. 'Nothing,' Alex replied, harking his teeth over Nigel his bare skin of his shoulder now. In a second the cloth of his shirt float through the air. Alex had simply ripped it open, not caring about the buttons clattering all over the floor. That actually made Nigel smirk, and he chuckled satisfied as he cocked his head. 'Ah, good, getting impatient there Jack . I see…' 'Oh you should know,' Alex smirked. 'Then tell me…' Nigel thought it would be pretty fair if he could undo Alex from his shirt as well now, and so did it – not caring about the tie remaining on his neck. After all, he still wore his tie as well. They couldn't easily rip that one off from their necks. It would suffocate them. 'This is your father his office, you know? Don't you think he'll mind if we-' 'Like you actually care,' Alex smirked. Nigel couldn't keep himself from smirking too, and buried his lips in Alex his neck as well– sucking his skin softly while making his way down. Alex sank his fingertips into Nigel his back, scratching his nails over his skin until red, slightly burning stripes revealed themselves in the shuttering light of the reflecting moon. Alex clenched his teeth now, trying not to groan as soon as Nigel pressed his teeth into the skin of his chest, and he opened his eyes on a crack to gaze at his body – just realizing how hot he looked whenever he still wore his tie but no shirt. Alex gasped now, sheaving his hand into the back pockets from Nigel his pants, and couldn't keep himself from pressing his fingers into Nigel his bum – even though it didn't had much effect since it got covered up by cloth obviously. A gasp got audible as Alex threw his head in his neck, not being able to hold back a moan now as soon as Nigel started to move the tip of his tongue along his bare chest. 'Fuck,' Alex groaned, realizing how his erection began to grow without his permission. It bumped against the cloth of his underpants, and got stuck between – especially as Nigel buried his teeth in the skin of his shoulder now. Nigel grinned, stroking the tip of his tongue toward Alex his earlobe now, not realizing how he was serving Alex a boner by this. He just meant it as a way of teasing, but apparently he was very good at it. 'Feeling anything you like?' Nigel was referring to the way Alex squeezed his butt. Nevertheless Alex caught the question up as something different, and so he squeezed out another grown as he grabbed the back of Nigel his head now – softly pulling the roots from his hair as he pressed his lower parts against Nigel his hips. His back writhed and he couldn't keep his animal-sounding vocals to himself anymore – even though Nigel was barely doing a thing. Apparently Alex had some sexual frustrations hiding in his body, or he'd been craving for Nigel to do this way too long already. 'I want to feel you in me,' Alex suddenly squeezed out after some seconds – breathing into Nigel his ear. Nigel widened his eyes, cocking his head, frowning after. It was only than that he finally realized how something bumped against the bare skin of his abdomen. 'You what?' Nigel gasped from surprise, and backed off immediately – colliding with his back against the headmaster his chair, not being able to keep away a chuckle. Alex had no idea whether to feel offended now or not. As he tried to study his breath, he moved his back against the edge of the desk, and grabbed the edges of the wood to press him up a bit. He gasped, swallowing away some saliva that piled up in time under his tongue. 'Blimey Jack.' Nigel his smirk faded, and he turned out to be more serious now. In seconds he turned, plucking their jackets and ripped shirts from the ground, and snorted as he straightened his back. 'We should go. This isn't working. We can't get into the drawer with such less time without having the key or the right tools, and I bet your dad will be here in some minutes. We can't risk that.' Alex clenched his teeth now, again swallowing away some saliva, and crouched down to pick the ripped-off buttons from the ground – the once that got ripped of their shirts. 'Yes,' Alex breathed than – nodding as he hid his face by pointing it towards the ground. 'We'll come back later some time.' Nigel leaned against the desk now, having put on his shirt already though he couldn't close it since it had no buttons left. 'Sounds like a clever plan to me.' Alex shoved his hands over the wooden floor now, piling up all the buttons by this, and as soon as he held them all in one hand, he turned – while still crouching – toward the desk, seeing how Nigel leaned against the desk basically in front of him. Without getting up, Alex placed the buttons on the desk – not ripping his eyes from Nigel's appearance just yet. It might have looked frightening a bit. Nigel frowned, though he still lightly smiled, and titled his head as he gazed down at Alex now, wondering what he was doing. 'Are you sure you don't want this?' The frown on Nigel's appearance became deeper, and a bit of concern was written on his face now. 'What are you implying? What do you mean ?' Alex moved closer now, still not getting up, and placed his hands around Nigel his hips – staring him straight in his blue bright eyes which shown suspiciousness. 'I can make you forget, Nigel,' he whispered – suddenly quoting Nigel his words from years ago in his own bedroom at Whitby. 'I can make you forget everything that's still bothering you, and burns away your last bit of faith.' Nigel laughed a bit nervously now, and clenched his teeth now. 'I still don't-' Nigel couldn't finish his sentence. Alex already placed his lips upon the skin just above his bellybutton, and a stream of warm shivers ran down his spine. His lower lip began to tremble immediately, and he gazed down – almost squeezing his eyes entirely shut by nervousness. 'W-what are you doing? Alex?' Alex pursed his lips after pressing another kiss on his skin, this time on the exact spot where his bellybutton was located. 'What do you reckon?' Nigel asked in silence, and shook his head – showing a slight sense of panic what made Alex don't know whether this would pack out positively or not. 'I don't know,' he squeezed out – lying, somewhere. 'Just chill out,' Alex whispered – making track of kisses down to the edge of Nigel his pants, and boxers since they stuck out above the edge of his pants just a bit. Nigel clenched his fingers around the edge of the wooden desk, squeezing his lips together to leave a groan behind – thinking his moans would be worse than the one Alex squeezed out before. 'Alex-' Nigel squeezed out. 'I don't-' He couldn't finish, again. The first groan got audible as soon as Alex opened the button of Nigel his pants, and pressed his lips against the cloth of his boxers – the place where his lower parts were located. Nigel immediately squeezed his eyes shut, pressing his nails against the solid wood, and tried to be not aware of the erection that was groan in his underpants. 'It's okay,' Alex whispered then. 'I want this,' he continued – stroking Nigel his thighs after pushing down his pants that nevertheless got stuck at the space near his knees. That didn't matter much, though. Alex only needed the space above the knees. 'You deserve to be pleasured after all you've done for me.' Alex pressed more kisses around the space above his boxer now, and kept stroking his thighs as some way of comforting. 'But I haven't done-' 'Sush,' Alex breathed now – getting rid of Nigel his underpants. He got now confronted with Nigel his swollen erection – realizing how easy it had been to wet him up, though he, himself, had exactly the same. 'You're a big boy.' His hands moved further toward Nigel his hips, and with his mouth closed he touched the edges of his own teeth with his tongue - making sure they all were covered with saliva. 'Don't talk,' he continued after. Just as Nigel began to shake his head, blinking a couple of times as he gazed around – still not daring to look down and face his companion together with his little friend – Alex wrapped his fingers around the thin skin of his friend's erection. 'Alex, you don't have-' Nigel was lost, because before he could even finish his sentence, a large groan got audible, and his back writhed without hid permission. Alex had covered up the tip of his penis with his lips, and started to press several kisses on it after smirking for just a second – realizing how priceless Nigel's expression had been. He loved his naked body. It looked just like pale, precious porcelain. ' Fuck ,' Nigel cursed – but not because he didn't liked it. That was after all what it was all about. He liked it way too much than he actually should. 'Don't worry,' Alex repeated again as he pulled back his head for a second – wetting his lips to make it more pleasant for Nigel, and much easier for himself. Within seconds he took his companion's erection in his mouth again – deeper than he had before – and as he finally started to suck, moving his head slowly up and down, Nigel just gave in after another loud grown, and threw his head in his neck by delight. His cheeks fluttered bright red, and loud panting got audible. His hands were sweaty now. His fingertips got pinched against the dark wood of the headmaster his desk, and his back writhed more at the faster Alex moved. 'Damn,' Nigel groaned. 'Fuck- This… Jack. Yes !' Alex pulled back slightly questioning now – searching for Nigel his eyes as he snorted. 'Don't you like it?' He sounded disappointed. Nigel threw a glance down at him now, his eyes spitting fire as his entire head got red like a tomato by now – mostly all because of feeling incredibly shy and embarrassed. 'I do, now keep going or I'll burn down this entire building!' Alex smirked and pressed some kisses on his thigh now, chuckling shortly after. 'You know I wouldn't mind.' 'I'll burn down everything you like,' Nigel corrected himself while panting now – his cheeks turning even more red. 'Calm your tits,' Alex grinned. 'now enjoy…' Alex continued doing his deed, pressing his pink swollen lips against the tip of the erection again to kiss it like a precious delicatessen. 'Alex,' Nigel gasped after Alex had speeded up the head within seconds. 'Alex, I'm coming.' Alex didn't seem to listen, and just kept rubbing the tip of his tongue along little Nigel its thin skin. 'Alex,' he squeezed out now, not being able to keep himself from rushing his hand through his companion his hair. 'You're so fucking good- I can't-' Nigel clenched his teeth now and pushed Alex away softly, interrupting Alex his actions before he would actually climax his mouth full, and pulled him up to press him against the desk after – pressing his swollen erection against Alex his bare abdomen, as he passionately started to kiss him on the lips. Nigel his whole body shocked and trembled. In almost a rush he started to search for Alex his zipper from his pants, and as soon as he didn't managed it to open it entirely, he just ripped it apart with quite come hostility in his voice. Nevertheless he smirked shortly after staring at Alex his pink lips, still being able to remember how wonderful they felt against his lower parts. Again he kissed them, biting on his lower lip as he shoved his hand into Alex his underpants – all without warning. His warm, sweaty hand clenched itself softly around his companion his erection, and before they both knew it, he started to give him a fast handjob. Alex started to pant as well now, pressing himself closer against Nigel as he sank his teeth into his neck. He groaned. 'You dirty piece of shit, just blow me.' It may have sound a bit angry and forcing, but Alex smiled at it. Nigel stopped his handjob now, searching for Alex his eyes as if he was actually surprised by his insult and command. Nevertheless, he kissed Alex his lips again, immediately kneeling down in front of him afterwards to start blowjobbing him gently. Alex his back writhed as well now. The desk behind him shoved over the wooden floor, and a high pitched sound got audible at it. 'Fuck,' Alex cursed than – biting on his lower lip, squeezing out a groan. 'Faster, please… I beg you. My dad-' A lie, obviously, suddenly blaming his father for the fact Nigel had so speed up his pass. Nigel smirked and started to lick the skin even slower now – narrowing his eyes suspiciously as a way of teasing. Alex groaned again and clenched his fingers around the edge of the desk as well now, suddenly realizing why Nigel did that before. This all gave such tension, his muscles all started to straighten. 'Blaming your dad huh,' Nigel grinned as he cocked his head – gazing up from under his dark long eyelashes now. ' Nevertheless he continued sucking shortly after. Alex clenched his teeth, realizing how his climax came closer and closer, and in time he almost reached it he managed to squeeze out a last warning. 'Nigel-' he panted. 'Nigel, I'm coming-' 'Pour it over me,' Nigel replied with a soothing voice – having his eyes shut already as he kept going on even faster by now – though he wasn't using his mouth anymore, but his hand. ' Please .' Not more than three seconds after Nigel his begging, Alex climaxed – pouring out a large amount of seed over Nigel his lips, cheek, jaw and chin. Nigel inhaled deeply, licking his lips slowly to get the bitter taste on his tongue from his companion his precious cum. He acted like it was the whipped cream on a birthdaycake. After cleaning up the spaces he couldn't reach with his tongue with his fingers, he licked it off them as well – searching for Alex his face after who still panted and groaned while stroking one of his hands roughly but caringly through Nigel his hair. 'Please, now finish me,' Nigel dared to whisper as his cheeks turned more red again. Alex moved his lips up to Nigel's, and kissed them gently to stroke his lips down his chest afterwards. He made his way toward Nigel's penis again, desiring for the unfinished climax he was about to manage in hopefully half a minute. In a flash, Alex moved his lips around his erection again, sucking him faster than he did before – apparently wanting to give Nigel that blessing climax as well now. 'I'm coming,' Nigel suddenly groaned out loud – burying his hands in Alex his blonde-reddish hair. 'I want you, Alex,' he gasped. 'I wanted you the entire time already, from when we first met- Now please… Please, end this.' Another groan squeezed out of his throat. ' I love you .' And there it went. Droplets of sticky sperm poured all over Nigel's stomach and abdomen - since he leaned backwards against the desk, and Alex wanted it to – and after he'd entirely climaxed, Alex moved his lips up to the Nigel his abdomen so he could lick up the bitter seeds as well now – trying not to throw up as soon as he tried to swallow it. He managed not to, and in the end even seemed to like it. Alex got up now, standing tightly with his body against those of Nigel, and buried his lips in his neck as he tried to steady his breath. 'I fucking love you too,' he replied him – once against pressing their lower parts against each other. ","Summary":" 'There we are.'

Or more like studying him. There was no proper word for it; every word in the dictionary lacked that something. The other boy just kept watch while he slept (but in all honesty it was kind of impossible to get a good nights sleep under that intense gaze), his eyes never leaving Alex, almost like a predator ready to pounce on its pray. But this look, this one look Alex had seen the other boy directing him countless times during long, comfortable silences was not malicious or vicious, it was just a look. But it was that look. Alex resisted the almost uncontrollable urge to shift on the bed, to nudge just a little bit closer to that warm body sitting on the beds edge. And the fact that Nigel didn't do it in secret, that oggling of his, could be kind of nerve-wracking at times. Like now. They had a test tomorrow too, and they'd both more than probably fail it if they kept this up. Sleep deprived Alex did not make a smart Alex. And he really wasn't in the mood to be lectured by his father anytime soon. In all honesty – that gaze made him quite uneasy. He often felt like he was some precious specimen of Nigel's, which he observed and took notes for. Which just might have some truth to it, he'd seen those journals the boy kept and that so very much uncalled assessment on his personality. What kept Alex from falling into Nigel's usual research subject category was the fact that he was still alive, breathing and kicking. It was mostly that fact that made him feel so unnerved; with Nigel's fascination for all things dead he shouldn't be his interested, or whatever, in him. But at the same time, bundled beneath all that anxiousness those goddamn eyes made him suffer through, was the fact that in a weird way it made him feel absolutely safe too. It hardly made sense, Alex knew that. But still, what was, was. It wasn't as if he could help it. Nigel was looking out for them always had a plan and was a step ahead of him and everybody else. It was a good thing. If only Alex knew what that look meant. It was weird, being in Nigel's head as he was in Alex' and not to know something like this. After Josh, Nigel was moved to another room, but that rarely stopped the other boy from sneaking into Alex' in the middle of a night, sometimes leaving \"presents\" behind but mostly he just sits and stares. It's become their routine of sorts. A very weird, fucked up ritual but no less one. Alex would lay in his bed unable to fall asleep, waiting, and then Nigel would come, take a seat on the bed and breathe with him. They never exchanged words, sometimes maybe small touches but even those were few and far between. Rare as a four-leaf clover, special. So the least Alex could do was to convey his gratitude –for gods sake, he didn't even know what for, but he felt inclined to do so. To give a 'yes' to whatever Nigel was attempting to verify by sitting there. It was unbearable to have Nigel's thoughts so close in his head, entwining with his own, but their bodies separated by a blanket and a few inches of space. Was Nigel feeling the same too? That thing pushing, begging for something deep inside his chest rather than in his head, all the while making his stomach knot with tight heat? Was that the reason he spent hours sitting next to Alex, looking at him long enough to count his freckles (and he had a gazillion of them, mind you)? Maybe he was trying to catalogue that thing, and not Alex himself. He already knew Alex after all, had his thoughts as his own, so it had to be. He was just as unable to identify that feeling as Alex was. Blind, refusing to open his eyes, Alex searches out for Nigel's hand propped to the edge of the bed and circles his wrist with his fingers. \" I'm not one of your wenches, Jack,\" he almost expected it to be said out loud. But there was no need to –if it was in his head it was in Nigel's too. Still, Alex kept his eyes closed. There was no point in poorly feigning sleep anymore, but... those goddamn eyes. Nigel didn't move his hand away from the other boys grip, although it was loose and he could've easily done so. But he doesn't. He's not pulling back, but not moving further towards Alex either. A heartbeat and a half later Alex tugged at the hand, moving it closer to himself and finally to his mouth. He let's his breath ghost over Nigel's hand, those bony knuckles and milk white skin he still cannot see, but has unintentionally memorized damn too well. He waits for a response, a hitch in Nigel's breath or something along those lines, but gets none. It's not surprising. Alex pushes his lips to Nigel's thumb. He gives an each finger a delicate kiss –no, not a kiss. A peck maybe, but definitely not a one kiss is given. This is his spear, his weapon, a tool to be used so they can achieve salvation.

Hacía mucho frío en aquellos pasillos de húmeda piedra. Y en aquellas habitaciones impersonales e incoloras... Habitaciones siempre silenciosas, en las que dormir era cómo haber llegado al último sueño... El de la tumba muda en el mudo cementerio. A través de la persiana jamás se coló ni un sólo rayo de luna... Pero quizás era mejor estar a oscuras; bajo la luz no me hubiera atrevido a dormir junto a Nigel. Su visión me alteraba de una forma antinatural, casi espasmódica. No hubiera conciliado jamás el sueño si hubiera podido distinguir su figura estirada en la otra cama... aguardando. Siempre aguardando. ¿Nunca has tenido la sensación de que alguien te arrastraba, de que ya no eras tú mismo... sino lo que otra persona te obligaba a ser?. ¿De forma inevitable, irresistible?. ¿Cómo si \"alguien\" tirara de tus entrañas, cómo si se acurrucara sobre tu pecho, asfixiándote, cómo el Íncubo de las leyendas?. ¿Nunca has sentido el aliento de alguien sobre tu cuello, estando completamente solo?. ¿Nunca has cerrado los ojos, aceptando esa espectral caricia?. Pero no hay nadie. Es sólo... tu imaginación. ¿Verdad?. El internado siempre me pareció el lugar idóneo para una historia de fantasmas. Era enorme, lúgubre, gélido. Un castillo en el que podrían haber demonios bajo el aspecto de inofensivas gárgolas, muertos inquietos bajo la tierra, brujas ocultas entre las sombras que en su día sacrificaron a jóvenes e inocentes alumnos para sus pócimas de la noche de Walpurgis... Vampiros cómo descarnadas y voraces apariciones nocturnas, succionando el líquido rojo de la vida a la hora de irse a la cama... Eran cuentos de niños, por supuesto. Pero en todo cuento, en toda leyenda, hay una chispa de verdad. Yo lo descubrí al fin... pero ya había perdido la capacidad de maravillarme que sólo los niños poseen. Ya no había maravilla en esas sórdidas historias de terror... ya sólo podía caber el asco. ¿Y la fascinación?. A veces, me despertaba en mi cama arqueado de una forma poco natural. Pero entonces, ya no temía a los vampiros... sino al beso del Íncubo. Esa criatura de antiguo tratado medieval había sobrevivido a todas las \"cosas de niños\", y poseía mis noches y mis días. Era real. Era real. Era Nigel. Cuando él estaba vivo, no pensé demasiado en lo hermoso que era. Los chicos no se fijan de esa manera en otros chicos, ¿verdad?. Pero hay cosas que forman parte de un \"todo\" demasiado intenso y esencial cómo para pasarlo por alto... La belleza de Nigel no era algo baladí. No era un detalle superficial, no era un erotismo homosexual en el seno de una \"respetable institución\" cómo lo era el internado de mi padre. Su belleza no era algo que pudiera motejarse \"de cariz impropio\" entre dos hombres... Era algo totalmente diferente a cualquier cosa que pudiera suponerse. Una faceta más de él... una faceta concreta cómo un rasgo más de personalidad (cómo su mente peligrosa...), en lugar de quedarse en un simple y vacío atractivo físico. Nigel era hermoso, ahora lo sé bien. Espantosa, siniestramente hermoso. Poseía (ese era) el atractivo del Diablo. Esa era la muestra más clara de la apetencia por el Mal. Una mente tortuosa y repugnante, y a la vez subyugante, revestida de la carne más fascinadora. El Mal no se mostraba cómo un monstruo deforme, cómo en una ilustración rancia de un libro de Collin de Plancy, o cómo el villano jorobado de una novela gótica... No; el Mal se mostraba tentador, en realidad, cómo la manzana del pecado original. No había culpa en esa apetencia... sólo la elección final, sólo traspasar esa línea... y no poder volver atrás. No hay arrepentimiento. Algo te arrastra. Y ya no eres tú. Adiós a tu dulce vida. Había algo en él... que yo no soy capaz de describir correctamente. Él era ideal para el internado en el que deberían haber habido monstruos... Él era un monstruo real. Cuando estaba presente, diseccionando pequeños cadáveres de animales inocentes... Ese olor dulzón de la podredumbre no existía, supongo. Era yo el que lo imaginaba a su alrededor... pero me parecía sentirlo de veras, y llegó un punto en que yo no podía distinguir la realidad de la ficción. Me gustaba aquel olor, de todas formas, imaginario o no. Aunque jamás lo hubiera confesado, ni a mí mismo, por aquel entonces. Él sonreía con sus útiles de disección. Nuestros ojos se encontraban, y entonces me parecía que él también sentía el olor. Y su sonrisa cómplice me aterraba... porque me daba la sensación de que era él quien me hacía creer en el olor . De que lograba hacerme creer a pies juntillas cosas imposibles, que no podían existir. Imaginaba sangre en sus labios voluptuosos, entonces. Y cómo él pasaría la lengua rosada sobre ellos, deleitado por el sabor metálico. Si era la sangre de los animales, o la suya propia en una lujuria de autolaceración, no lo sé. Yo simplemente imaginaba... pero a veces de una forma incontrolada, sin entender del todo lo que veía o sin darle explicación alguna, cómo si no conociera las reglas del juego o las obviara... cómo si esa fuera la imagen captada de un cerebro ajeno. Supongo que era esa la comunión de mentes que a mí tanto me aterraba. Sobre todo, cuando por las noches, en la oscuridad, creía sentir sangre en mis propios labios. Pero mi lengua quedaba paralizada, y ni siquiera era capaz de lamer el líquido. Y eso, aunque suene absurdo, me pesaba más que el hecho de sentir sangre manchando mi boca. Él me estaba iniciando en cosas prohibidas, atroces. Yo lo sabía... Cuando él estaba ausente... sentía sus ojos en mi nuca, y me quemaban. Una vez, grité en mitad de clase debido a ello. Nigel estaba en la enfermería, tuvo un accidente en clase de Gimnasia. Grité porque me había parecido sentir sus dedos helados en el abdomen. Cómo si los hubiera pasado suavemente por el... en una caricia tan leve cómo el roce de una pluma. Quizás, lo más terrorífico de todo fue lo mucho que me gustó. Me gustó la sensación. Quería más. Experimentar más cosas prohibidas. Mal que me pesara, era así. Una conexión extraña, estando ambos separados... le sentía justo a mi lado, me parecía capaz de cualquier cosa. Nigel me parecía un semidiós... Los cuentos se habían hecho realidad. Pero él me estaba (y acabaría) absorbiendo la vida... Estaba por todas partes. Y yo ya no era yo, y la realidad se marcaba únicamente por las acciones de Nigel... Por el criterio de Nigel. Por su desenfrenada fantasía mórbida... Si él me hubiera dicho entonces que me lanzara por la ventana, yo hubiera creído que era posible volar. Pero yo le odiaba. Le odiaba con todas mis fuerzas. Sé que es increíble, que leyendo todo esto pensarás que simplemente sentía cosas demasiado retorcidas por él... inconfesables, que era una obsesión. Él por mí, y yo por él. Pero no es cierto. Él era un peso asfixiante sobre mí. Un Íncubo, el íncubo de los cuentos susurrados de un convento del medievo... Me estaba robando la vida, mostrándome cosas horribles, iniciando un lento ardor en mis entrañas que me hacía gustar de ellas... haciéndome desear más . Siempre un poco más lejos... Todo aquello era cómo una especie de interminable orgasmo, supongo. Salvo que yo no sentía ningún tipo de inclinación física hacia Nigel. Y no creo que Nigel tuviera sexo. Quiero decir, que me parecía asexual. Sólo su Mal era cómo una penetración. Una interior, que era peor que cualquier clase de relación erótica. Era una violación del alma, nada tenía que ver con el cuerpo. Pero el hecho es que, fuera cómo fuese, de alguna manera me violaba. Y yo era suyo, ¡suyo!. Furiosamente suyo. Y le odiaba, por ello, tanto... Iba a decir \"tanto cómo para matarle\". Pero eso es demasiado estúpido, teniendo en cuenta cómo acabó todo. Una espiral de condenación. Me había llevado casi a la locura, y seguro a la abyección. Él era una pesadilla hecha realidad, en aquel internado se habían cumplido los sueños propios de los terrores de un niño. Monstruo, monstruo, monstruo. Unos labios inexistentes, espectrales, sobre mi cuello, sobre todo mi cuerpo, por las noches... Y la falta de energía por las mañanas; yo estaba exhausto, enfermo... Nigel, fuiste mi azote en vida. Y, una vez muerto... ¿Creías que no me daría cuenta, Nigel?. Vuelves a cada minuto. Te quedas quieto tras de mí. Observándome. Siempre observándome. Me llamabas Jack. Y yo creo ya que soy Jack. Creo todo lo que tú dijiste, creería todo lo viniera de ti... Ya no puedo más. No puedo más. Por las noches, me sigues ahogando. Y no es extraño que la existencia espiritual de alguien cómo tú se haya transformado en la de un demonio. Siempre lo fuiste, pero ahora has descubierto la verdadera eternidad . Estás en ella, y desde ella sigues manejándome cómo tú quieres. Y seguirás haciéndolo cuando yo muera. Porque tú y yo estamos condenados a estar juntos para siempre. En la eternidad . Íncubo, me posees cómo quieres. Y a mí ya no me queda nada más por decir: me rindo . Soy tuyo, soy todo tuyo, Nigel. Y sé que puedes oírme, que estás a mi lado ahora. Finalmente, soy tuyo, monstruo. Firmaré, no obstante, cómo Alex Forbes esta última página de mi diario. Aunque en mis entrañas siento que soy Jack, necesito despedirme del único alivio que ha podido encontrar mi mente, en este cuaderno... Con el nombre que me puso mi madre al nacer. Con el nombre del niño que un vez fui, inocente y despreocupado. Hasta que te conocí... y mis ojos se abrieron, por desgracia. Lo que soy ahora ya no lo sé. Salvo que, sea lo que sea, debo ser tuyo. Te siento en mí ahora, Nigel. No insistas, ya voy. Alex Forbes Me ha encantado escribir este fanfic. Adoro la película y creo que mucha más gente debería escribir sobre ella.

The Spade kisses his Jack for the first time in the dusty, crowded space of the church' storageroom. It's not ideal, but it's the truth. It's not the way Alex imagined his first kiss being like, but that's how it happens. Alex had been trying to do his goddamn job and put things away as fast as he humanly could after the play's weekly practise is done when Nigel, unsurprisingly, appears into the doorway that leads to the stairs. It's not the first time he's come to intervene with Alex' work. Or his life. Even his head's not left in peace. \"Working hard?\" Alex doesn't dignify the question with a answer. Nigel sighs good-naturedly; \"Unfitting job for a man like yourself, wouldn't you say?\" Alex turns to the window and sets the candlestick to it's place on the wobly shelf next to it. Hands appear on his shoulders, light, yet determined. \"Jack, Jack, Jack,\" the other boy chants, while gently kneading the flesh of Alex' tight shoulders, and when Alex half-heartedly tries to shrug the imposing hands off, Nigel doesn't let him. In all honesty, Alex is not in the mood for another debate –an argument – so he keeps his tongue. It's difficult though, the other boy is taking liberties again. But even if he didn't keep silent and ignore the other boy Nigel wasn't one who got easily intimidated and hardly minded Alex' biting words when he lost his cool and resorted to them in every once in a while. But now when Alex tries to lean away from the hands, merely on long practised reflex, the pair of them stop him from continuing his work with surprising strenght Alex hadn't believed those arms could've possessed. So Nigel stops him, interrupts again. And he says this name that's not even Alex' and spins him around. Alex let's him, he's in co-operative mood today anyway. It's as he'd conclued a second ago –he doesn't feel like fighting today. So he turns, not curious, but cautious. He expects words, something that he hardly understands and doesn't make sense, but instead he gets lips. Nigel's lips on his. And it's not passionate, it's not a confession of a undisclosed love or affections, but a simple kiss, slow and easy. Nigel is shorter than him and so the other boy uses one of his clever hands to grap a hold of Alex' hair, and tugs. The hand he's placed in Alex' hair and on the back of his head is not forceful, nor is it urgently dragging him down to smash their lips tighter together. \" Here,\" it seems to say, gently guiding Alex' head down, \"like this.\" Was it a test? It felt like one. Actually, on Alex' experience on the other boy it would be just like him to mess with Alex like that. It already felt like his thougths were scattered and in tatters, but now, his feelings too. Atleast right now. Had Nigel set out to complitely drive him mad, he wondered. But weirdly enough it's almost like even though Nigel's slowly making him loose it – himself , he's still, somehow , making him whole too. He makes good for the so called damage he does, fills up the empty spaces inside of Alex and finishes his thougths. So somehow it's alright too. And anyway, it's more like a game than a test. A game in which Nigel's holding the winning hand and knows exactly what kind of a set of cards the other by is holding as well. He has the Jack of Spades, of course, but eveything else is uncertain, undecided though they're swiftly moving towards a purpose of some sort. Alex feels this and he's sure the other boy feels it too, and that he propably knows and understands it better than Alex ever could. In a funny way –no, Alex found nothing fun in being prompted and led towards something he didn't fully understand. It was almost like he was uncoherent or half-witted around Nigel, sure, he fought and cursed him, but he didn't fully understand. Nigel did though, always had. He'd fucking courted Alex, danced that idiotic dance of his around him earlierly and gotten Alex mixed up with him, their minds tangled in a way that could only lead into trouble. Or to eternity. So was it some ridiculous act of kindness, an un-Nigel like attempt to make him feel better about it all? That question, the enigma that Nigel still was to him, made his chest ache more in his mind than those lips on his did. He burned, but not from desire. Because of his stupid fears, most likely. But not that he'd ever admit it. Then Nigel falls back just as easily and fast as he'd moments ago leaned to kiss Alex, then cups the side of the still startled boy's cheek in the surprisingly soft palm on his hand. \"Breathe, Jack,\" he sniggers under his breath with a weird sort of humour coloring his voice. It's true, Alex is pretty much frozen to place, his feett rooted to the cold concrete floor of the room and his breath stolen. It hadn't even been a lengthy one, the kiss, not the kind that was granted to steal away the last ounce of air from your lugns and leave you gasping. No, it'd been nothing like that. But before Alex manages to tell Nigel that he's gone too far this time and for the thousand time tell him that his name is Alex, Nigel's eyes skirt past his face and over his shoulder. Alex follows his gaze by turning his head to the window, still foolishly pliant under Nigel's touch. That hand on his cheek feels anythig but foreign, even if it came as a surprise. A group of girls stand outside the window. They had propably been passing by just now and on their way home, but now they're all just as frozen to their place as Alex was a heartbeat or a two ago –still kinda is. They stare, pretty mouths slightly it's not just any group of girls, but Susan and her friends. Alex curses under his breath, finally pushing Nigel off and stomps up the stairs without a looking back. There's work to be done and surely Nigel can find something else to do to amuse himself than tease Alex. So he goes, but Nigel stays behind, smiles and gives the girls a deceivingly friendly wave. The group hurriedly scatters off as if it were they who had been caught. And that's the time when Alex nearly lost his Maraclea due to his foolish, yet driven Spade. 2. The second time the Spade steals a kiss from Alex is weeks later, and Alex is hardly even aware of it. Actually, it could as well have been a dream. A ridiculously vivid dream, but a dream no less. Susan is dead. Well, as good as dead. He knows this, knows he's going to be a suspect though they will have no solid proof on him. When the that time will come he will also know who really did it. He will knows it's Nigel. Alex knows that they need to do certain things to achieve their goal. Necessary means to an end, Nigel had said. And it's true, Alex is well aware of that. And it's not like he feels regret beforehand, no –this needed to be done. Sure, he quite fancied the girl, that was the reason she was chosen. She had gotten the short end of the stick so to say, but what's done was done. The decission was made. She was to be his Maraclea. Then, all of sudden, the realization that it was probably happening right now, that Susan's life might be ending at this very minute, made his stomach turn. It wasn't a feeling of disgust twisting deep inside his belly, but some weird form of anticipation. Whatever it was it left the tip of his fingers tingling and his thoughts a mush. Alex was through trying to categorize the strange sensations and feelings he'd been forced to face and battle with ever since he met Nigel. And now, when their pact was about to be sealed with blood which would be on both of their hands, his head spun with overwhelming nervousness. There was no need to worry. Nigel had steely, steady hands and was more than capable to do the job. Alex trusted him, this had nothing to do with that. Necessary means to an end , he repeats to himself in his head and the words – that simple sentence is a heavy burden to carry. Words should be weightless, thoughts too. But somehow, they're dragging him down, making him second guess his choises, their choises. So it's granted that he's been sleeping fitfully for the past night or two, never really falling into that wonderful state of oblivion sleep usually grants you. No, he's not getting any of that. But he's tired and his brain demands him to do something about it, creating a vicious headache in the progress, so he tries. It's not long after the curfew when he hears his door swing open and then being pushed back closed. He's so disorientated that he figures it might've just been the wind against the old glass of his window and that he's just imagining things when the outer side of the narrow bed dibs. Alex almost curses outloud. He's not going anywhere, not tonight. Nigel could just suck it up and forget whatever plan he had in mind this time. He wasn't up for any of it, not tonight. He wasn't grieving, but he needed a break. Surprisingly, there's no 'Jack, come on, wake up,' but instead Nigel greets him with uncharacteristic silence. It's a familiar dance –Nigel barging into his room that is, but this time something's different. The other boy is breaking his own rules, in a way. He's just sitting there, seemingly without any real agenda or purpose. Alex is sure that he's staring down at him, but he doesn't feel like opening his eyes. He's tired, after all. Dead tired. There might not be any real purpose for Nigel's visit, but there's a hand. A hand that lands on Alex' forehead and brushes away the strands of hair there. Nigel then presses his fingers to the crease between Alex' brows as if questioning it with the simple touch. And it's weird, Alex hadn't even noticed he was scruntching up his forehead or that he looked troubled or whatever Nigel thought he was. A kiss follows the touch, short and sweet and it barely even lands on Alex' pliant mouth in the dark. He forgives it, the miscalculation, and relaxes under the soothing touches. Nigel is still gently rubbing his forehead with his index finger in a way that almost indicates that he's trying to releive whatever stress Alex has, but that'd be wierd. So not like Nigel. No –it was kind of like Nigel, just not his job nor duty. It crosses his mind just as he's drifting into the long awaited sleep, if he was worthy of his Spade. 3. Their last kiss is even more further away from ideal than the first. Alex fits his lips against against Nigel's already cold ones in a desperate attempt to breathe somesort of life into the boy. It's impossibe, he knows, but he tries. He tries once, twice, and shifts his head, planting a prompting peck to Nigel's cheek. He keeps reassuring himself that this is not goodbye. But his hands are rapidly becoming wetter, and not with rain, which makes him gain new perspective. Redder too, even in the dim lighting Alex is able to regognize the vivid color of it. He sees Nigel dead, a hole in his neck and blood everywhere. He looks, and he cannot believe it to be true. Alex spends a few moments to collect Nigel's now broken form into his lap carefully, craddles it gently and smoothes the bit ruffled, wet strands of hair properly into their place. The vivid color of blood is staining everything, the pool of it steadily spreading underneath them. Widening, swallowing them in the reddness of it. Alex holds back the need to gag at the sight of the color that means eternity. There's a faint smell of blood in the air, he's focerd to notice. It and the smell of rain blend together into a obscure mixture Alex doupts he'll never forget. He's used to the blood part of it, it comes with the job. It comes with Nigel. And it's needed to gain eternity. A spear cannot serve his master otherwise, it is, in the end of the day; an impliment for killing. But now Alex is without his Spade and he grieves, illogically, when the other now had everything they ever wanted. He plants another wet kiss to Nigel's mouth and tries to remember just that. It's te last one they'll ever share, and yet it's nothing but a ugly smack of lips, Nigel's unresponsive ones giving under his, and Alex half-sobs into his mouth. And he hopes.

Esa era la palabra que usaría si tuviese que describir la situación. Y a cada día, a cada hora, sentía que más y más se me iba de las manos. En clase, en las asambleas, en los almuerzos, en los recesos, en la jodida habitación. En todo lugar, mis ojos se empecinaban en buscarlo; a él, a ese cabello negro y esa piel tan blanca, los labios rojos y esos ojos… esos ojos vacíos que no transmitían nada. Nada. Eso era Nigel, y yo definitivamente no estaba preparado para todo aquello que me pasaba por la cabeza y que repercutía en todo mi cuerpo. Acababa de discutir con mi padre y aprovechando que Nigel no estaba en el cuarto, hurgué un poco en su escritorio. Luego de verlo destripar aquella paloma, no estaba seguro de que algo más fuese a impresionarme, pero lo cierto es que seguía dándome escalofríos verlo hacer todo aquello. Y también el resultado, como aquel cuadro de insectos disecados que posaba sobre la madera. La curiosidad me ganó. Nigel nunca me hablaba, a menos que fuese para hacerme notar que estaba ignorándome; por eso, cualquier cosa que me diera un mínimo de información me servía . De ahí que estuviese corriendo el cuadro de insectos para ver el libro que había debajo, el cual parecía estar escrito con su propia letra. Pequeña, sobria y misteriosa, casi ininteligible. Sí, no había duda de que era su letra. Y tan ensimismado estaba, que me fue imposible no sobresaltarme cuando me percaté de que estaba prácticamente pegado a mi espalda. Porque sabía que era él. Lo sentía . Instintivamente mi rostro giró y mi corazón latió desbocado cuando me encontré con el suyo a pocos centímetros del mío. Y como si supiera el desastre que estaba causando en mí, el muy bastardo no dejó de observarme. Y pese a que me parecieron horas las que pasamos así, no fueron más que los segundos que le ocupó el tomar el dichoso libro y salir del cuarto. Definitivamente, ese fue el peor día de todos. Me aterraba, me incomodaba su presencia, pero a la vez me fascinaba y me encontraba buscándolo de forma casi obsesiva cuando no lo tenía cerca para obtener a veces, con suerte, sólo una mirada indiferente. Y algo dentro de mí dijo que esa noche era suficiente. Nigel siempre se acostaba más tarde que yo, aunque eran pocas las veces las que podía conciliar el sueño antes que él. O, si lo hacía, era viendo su figura recortada por la luz proveniente del escritorio. Apenas emitía sonido y sus movimientos eran tan precisos que resultaba imposible no sentirse hipnotizado por ello. Paz era lo último que trasmitía, sin embargo. Esta vez no me molesté en fingir estar dormido al percatarme de que su trabajo por ese día había acabado. Tampoco me molesté en quitar mi mirada de la suya, o de su cuerpo cuando me dio la espalda, quizás buscando que sintiese al menos una mínima parte de la turbación que él me hacía sentir. Pero su expresión permaneció igual a la de siempre cuando se metió a la cama, con el rostro vuelto hacia mí. No obstante, y sin saber si fue obra de mi imaginación, podría jurar que una minúscula sonrisa se posó sobre sus labios, una milésima de segundo antes de que apagara la luz por fin. El silencio fue ensordecedor entonces. No me atrevía a moverme, apenas y soltaba aire, que dentro de mi cabeza se oía como un gran vendaval. Entonces comprendí que él tampoco había cambiado de posición, y fue cuestión de que mis ojos se acostumbraran a la oscuridad para darme cuenta que los suyos seguían puestos en mí. Y esta vez sonreía. Sonreía de una forma casi macabra, pero que me llamaba, me incitaba. Juraría que no tuve control de mi cuerpo cuando me puse de pie y caminé los pocos pasos que me separaban de su cama. Nigel fue volteando bocarriba a medida que me acercaba, casi con cada paso, y de pronto me encontré sobre él, apoyado con mis rodillas y manos alrededor de su cuerpo. Ya no sonreía y tampoco había indicios de que hubiese pasado alguna vez, pero una de sus manos se elevó hasta mi rostro, acariciando apenas con la yema de dos dedos mi mejilla. —¿Qué haces? —pregunté, inevitablemente en un susurro. Entonces su mano viajó a mi nuca y comenzó a acariciar mi cabello en esa zona. —Eres tu quien está sobre mí, en mi cama, Alex —respondió sin ninguna alteración en su voz. Sentí unas enormes ganas de golpearlo, de estrellarlo contra una pared para que reaccionara, pero sabía que eso no sucedería. Sin darme cuenta, comencé a temblar. —No hablo de eso, lo sabes, Nigel. No sé qué me haces, pero deja de hacerlo. — Deja de jugar con mi mente. —No estoy haciendo nada. No aún —dijo, y esta vez sí lo pude ver sonreír. Me estremecí de forma poco agradable cuando noté que era una sonrisa dulce, acompañada por su mirada—. Está bien si no lo entiendes aún, pero somos uno. Uno para siempre, Jack . —Y esa sonrisa duró apenas unos segundos, su rostro entero mutando nuevamente a la nada misma. Muchas veces sus palabras eran las de un loco, y aunque me asustaba, eso era lo que me atraía. Sí, me atraía de una manera insana, divina. Justo como un agujero negro que busca acabar con todo lo que hay a su alrededor. Sin embargo, eso que acababa de decir… —Yo no me lla… —Sin poder terminar de quejarme por la confusión, la presión en mi nuca aumentó y su rostro se elevó unos centímetros, los suficientes como para que nuestros labios se unieran. Apenas fue un roce. Enseguida se separó y volvió a observarme, sonriendo. Tuve la sensación de que estaba metiéndose en mi cabeza con esa mirada, como si pudiese saber cada cosa que pasaba ella. —Ya lo entenderás, Jack. Lo prometo —repitió, y esta vez me acarició los labios con los dedos. Tras el estupor no fui lo suficientemente rápido como para aparterme. De todas formas… una parte de mí sabía que desde hacía tiempo era imposible escapar de la red que Nigel había estado tegiendo silenciosamente a mi alrededor. Lo sentí abrirse paso en mi boca y comenzar un beso dominante, fuerte, al que me costó oponer resistencia. Me sentí repentinamente embriagado de Nigel, de todo él, porque no me vi capaz de cerrar los ojos y perderme esa misma expresión vacía que, sin embargo, parecía decir \"por fin te tengo\". Y en algún momento, la mano que no tenía en mi cabeza comenzó a descender por mi pecho con una lentitud paralizante. O yo me sentí paralizado por la situación, no lo sé. Cuando sin preámbilo ni aviso su mano se coló en mis pantalones, no pude más que sobresaltarme. Quise separarme, quise hundir mi cabeza en su cuello, morderlo, desgarrarlo, pero al parecer lo sabía, él siempre sabía, porque su mano en mi cabello se transformó en un agarre firme que apenas y me permitía rozar sus labios y esto sólo por momentos. Sentía la cara arder por estar en esa situación con Nigel, pero si no despegaba sus ojos de mí, no me creía capaz de hacer absolutamente nada. Nigel siempre está, sabrá cada cosa que pienses, Alex. Un gemido se escapó de mi boca cuando me apretó en su mano, comenzando a acariciar y tocar a sus anchas. Su sonrisa al oír mi reacción me hizo sentir un corrientazo de placer que me recorrió entero. —¿Lo ves? Todo está bien si estamos juntos . Es nuestro destino. Sin aflojar el agarre de mi cabello, se acercó nuevamente hacia mis labios y jadeó sobre ellos, apenas rozándolos, mientras aumentaba la velocidad de su mano. No estoy seguro de si traté de controlarme, pero pese a la vergüenza, no tardé casi nada en acabar, entre exalaciones. Me sentía humillado y con ganas de llorar. Lo siguiente que supe fue que, tras una última caricia, su otra mano dejó mis pantalones. Quería salir corriendo de ahí, pero con la mano enredada en el cabello de mi nuca ahora bajando por mi espalda, simplemente me dejé caer sobre Nigel. Mi mirada atónita siguió el recorrido de su extremidad liberada al ver que se dirigía hacia su propia boca. De forma lenta y aún sin expresión alguna, lamió uno a uno los dedos manchados y por último la palma, todo sin dejar de observarme. No sé qué cara habré puesto, porque él terminó riendo, de esa forma breve y extraña que tanto me perturbaba. —Vuelve a tu cama, Jack, mañana hay clases. Queriendo decir mil cosas, como siempre, me callé y obedecí. No supe cuando comenzó, pero en ese instante lo comprendí: ya no había otra forma de ver las cosas.

Seth just laughed his infamous ugly laugh which gotten me to start laughing. I have been friends with that guy since Knocked Up. The same with Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Craig Robinson and Jonah Hill. I've met and sort of befriended Danny McBride during Pineapple Express and Tropic Thunder. \"Hey, Seth Rogen, Alana Morrison, what up, guys?\" I heard a guy said. Seth nodded in hello and I just kindly smiled at him. Seth and I are waiting for Jay's plane to fly down from Montreal. From the corner of my eye, I saw the familiar figure of Jay. I tapped Seth on the shoulder to get his attention and I pointed at Jay. Seth notices Jay and opens up his arms and Jay did the same thing when he saw us. \"I'm so happy!\" Jay exclaimed, excitedly as Seth laughed again. \"What's up, man?\" Seth asked as he and Jay hugged. Once they got out of the hug, I hugged Jay. The last time I saw Jay, it was at the Your Highness premiere. \"It's so good to see you, Jay. How's Montreal treating you?\" I asked. \"G-Good. It's good down there.\" Jay said. \"How long has it been, man?\" Seth asked. \"Sometime in the last...insight a year…\" Jay said. \"Alana and I have the best weekend ever planned for you, man.\" Seth said. \"Lay it on me.\" Jay said. \"No, we don't wanna ruin it. You'll wait until we get to Seth's house.\" I said, cutely and we had left the air terminal to get Jay's bags and we are now in Seth's car all whilst trying to avoid the paparazzi. I know Jay isn't into the whole Hollywood lifestyle and the whole paparazzi thing just makes him plain uncomfortable. \"Okay, I landed, I'm here, we said our hellos, can we please go to fucking Carl's Jr?\" Jay asked. \"Uh, I would...I loved to but…\" Seth started. \"If you say cleanse one more fucking time…\" I started to mutter. Jay gave me a confused look. \" He'll tell you.\" I said. \"...But, uh, I can't really eat that stuff right now. I'm on a, uh, I'm on this cleanse…\" Seth started. Jay looked at me like I wasn't kidding. I just shook my head. \"Y-You're on a what?\" Jay asked. \"My thoughts exactly.\" I said. \"I'm on a cleanse.\" Seth said, seriously and Jay starts laughing. \"What?\" Jay said through laughter. \"It's good for you. I don't know that you're supposed to take six shits a day.\" Seth said. \"That's not true. You're supposed to shit twice a day.\" Jay said. \"That's not true. That's what they used to think, now they know you're supposed to shit six times a day.\" Seth said. \"So, you're not drinking, you're not smoking weed…\" Jay started. \"Oh, he's still drinking and smoking weed.\" I said. \"But…\" Jay started. \"I'm on a cleanse. I'm not psychotic. I swear, if you stop eating gluten, you'd feel fucking better all day.\" Seth said. Jay was about to speak up when Seth cuts him off. \"Whenever you feel shitty, that's because of gluten.\" Seth said. \"That's not true. Who the fuck told you to stop eating gluten?\" Jay asked. \"That's true.\" Seth said. \"Do you even know what gluten is, Seth?\" I asked. \"I know what fucking gluten is, Alana.\" Seth said. \"Alana's right. You have no idea what…\" Jay started. \"I know what gluten is.\" Seth said. \"Gluten's a vague term. It's used to categorize what things are bad, you know. Calories; that's a gluten, fat; that's a gluten.\" Seth started to list off. \"Somebody just told you shouldn't probably eat gluten and you're like oh, I shouldn't eat gluten. \" Jay said. \"Gluten is fat shit, man. I'm not eating it.\" Seth said. Seth finally caved in and we got fucking Carl's Jr. \"Each bite is better than the previous bite.\" Seth said as he was eating his burger. We had finally made it back to Seth's house. My outfit for James's house party is in one of the guest rooms, so I'm using the bathroom to change into my outfit when the time is near. \"Nice place, man. It's beautiful.\" Jay said. \"Yeah, you like it?\" Seth asked. Seth was showing Jay around his house. \"So, this is where the other half lives? Amazing.\" Jay said. Seth had shown him the air hockey table. \"Okay, Jay. Seth and I have a huge surprise for you.\" I said and we shown him the surprise. \"Ohhh..\" Jay said as he ran over to the table. I had jumped over to the couch, so I could be near Seth and Jay. \"Oh my...are you serious?\" Jay asked. \"All of your favorite things.\" Seth said. On the table, it has starbursts, airheads, and even Jay's name was spelt in joints. \"Seth Rogen and Alana Morrison, you are just the best people.\" Jay said. \"We decided to lube up your entry a little bit because we know how you don't love it that much in LA.\" I said. \"This is the transition, this is the much needed foreplay.\" Jay said. \"You know what I got...a 3-D television.\" Seth said as he handed Jay the 3-D glasses for the 3-D television. So, we spent the half of the afternoon, being high as kites, playing video games and just being general dumbasses. Once we all simmered down, Seth spoke up. \"Oh, you know what? We should go to Franco's house soon. He's having a housewarming party, just building his house. I haven't even seen it yet, but I heard it's supposed to be bonkers.\" Seth said. \"Whenever it comes to James Franco, everything is bonkers.\" I said, stating a well known truth. Whenever we're out with Franco, he goes crazy whether he gets bat-shit drunk or high. \"I haven't been in LA for a year and I came here to chill with you two.\" Jay said. \"We all could chill together and we could chill with those other guys. We'll all chill as one big unit.\" Seth said. \"Will I even know anybody there?\" Jay asked. \"There's James Franco…\" Seth began to list off. \"James Franco doesn't even know my name.\" Jay said. Yep, that's true, whenever Jay's along with us, James tends to forget Jay's name. \"Jonah Hill will be there.\" Seth said. \"Can't stand him and he can't stand me.\" Jay said. \"He's like the nicest guy in the world. He likes you so much. He specifically talks about how much he likes you. Out of nowhere, he said, you know what? Jay's an inspiration.\" Seth said. \"No way he said that and I can't stand him.\" Jay said. \"Okay, Craig Robinson will be there.\" I said. \"Never met him.\" Jay said. \"He's a funny guy.\" I said. \"Yeah, sweats a lot but he's a great guy. So, it's gonna be fun, man.\" Seth said. \"For you two, I'll go.\" Jay said. \"I promise, I'll stay by you all night.\" Seth said. Jay starts to kindly decline that but Seth said that he wants to. \"And you know why else, because nobody puts Jay in a corner.\" Seth said. \"Sorry to break up the whole bromance but I need to get ready.\" I said. \"Don't be too long, Alana!\" Seth exclaimed to me. \"Fuck you, Rogen!\" I exclaimed as I went upstairs to get ready for the party. Jay's POV: If I didn't think Alana was beautiful back then, now I think she looks really beautiful now. I'll admit, I have a crush on her ever since we were filming Tropic Thunder. Seth snaps his fingers in front of my face when I was staring at Alana's retreating figure. \"Dude, tell me when you're gonna grow some balls and ask Alana out?\" Seth asked. \"I will during the weekend.\" I said. \"Well, you better hurry. I heard that Franco has got a crush on Alana as well.\" Seth said. Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah...James Franco has a crush on Alana? I won't know who would have the better advantage for Alana, but I'm pretty sure that it would be Franco. No, Jay! You can ask Alana out! Just make sure that Franco's not in the way.[Chapter 3] REVIEW TIMEE!1 Guest: Thank you for liking that. I got ready for the party and the taxi just dropped us off at James's house. The exterior of his house is beautiful. I knew that he would go all out on that house. \"This is crazy!\" Seth commented. \"Yeah?\" Jay asked. \"Yeah, man, right?\" Seth replied. \"Look at it. Of course Franco would go all out on this.\" I said. \"A bit much.\" Jay said. \"I don't think it is a bit much. I think it's right on the money.\" Seth said. \"What is he, Pablo Escobar?\" Jay asked. \"Come on, man. This is an awesome street. Channing Tatum lives up there.\" Seth said. \"Oh, for the love of...would you stop talking about…\" Jay started but got interrupted by Seth. \"The sexiest street in America.\" Seth continued. \"I have been in a couple of movies with that guy and let me tell you, he is sexy.\" I said. \"You two and Channing Tatum.\" Jay muttered. \"I think he's attractive.\" Seth said. Preach! I knocked on the door. \"I think it's a cool house.\" Seth said. \"We know you do.\" I said. \"I can't wait to see inside it. That's why I'm excited.\" Seth said. The door opened to reveal James Franco himself. \"Ha, ha, yes!\" James exclaimed as he bro-hugged Seth. \"So happy you're here.\" James said. \"I'm so happy to be here.\" Seth said. Then James looked over to me. \"Alana, still looking beautiful as ever.\" James said. My cheeks had a light pink painted over them. \"Nice cardigan.\" I said as I took in his outfit. \"You know you love it.\" James said as we hugged, but for some reason, our hug was lasting a tiny bit longer than James and Seth's bro-hug. James then turned me around with his arm still wrapped around my waist and he looked at Jay. \"Hey, Johnny, what's up?\" James asked as he shook Jay's hand with his other hand because his one arm was wrapped around my waist. I huffed a sigh as James got Jay's name wrong. \"It's Jay.\" Jay corrected him. \"I'll never forget it again, man. Good to see you\" James said as his arm is no longer on my waist and then he hugged him. \"Nice to see you. Come on in.\" James said as we were invited inside James's house. \"Check it out! My new place!\" James said as he lead us inside. \"Awesome, man!\" Seth exclaimed. \"Designed it myself.\" James said. \"Really cool. This place is beautiful.\" I said. \"This place is like a piece of me. You three just stepped inside me.\" James said. I groaned, mentally of the innuendo as Jay looked a little weirded out, but Seth seemed used to it. \"You let us both come inside of you. Yeah.\" Seth said. \"Icing on the cake. Check it out.\" James said as he shown us paintings with Seth's name, James's name and my name painted in a unique way. They were hung next to each other. \"Side by side. A team.\" James said. \"Holy shit.\" Seth muttered. \"So, is it weird?\" James asked. \"No.\" I said. \"Are you sure?\" James asked. \"I really like it.\" Seth said. \"What do you think, Jay?\" James asked. \"I'm not a big art guy.\" Jay said. Fuck, I know that James is gonna go into one of his rants about art. \"Uh, I'm gonna go say hi to other people.\" I said and as I was about to walk away, James grabbed me by the wrist. \"After the party, meet me in my room. I have something important to tell you.\" James whispered into my ear. \"O-Okay.\" I said as I walked away from James, Seth and Jay. \"Holy shit, Alana, what's up?\" I heard Jason Segel ask. \"Hey, Jason. Good to see you too.\" I said as I walked up to him and Rihanna and hugged Jason. \"It's a pleasure to meet you, Rihanna.\" I said as I shook her hand. \"You too. Alana, right?\" Rihanna asked. I nodded. \"So, Alana, have you ever seen a psychiatrist?\" Jason asked. \"Actually, no. What about you?\" I asked Rihanna. When she was about to answer, from the corner of my eye, I saw Michael Cera, who was coked out of his mind, slap Rihanna on the ass. She was all pissed and bitch slapped him. \"That's not cool.\" Jason said. \"Don't touch my butt, bitch!\" Rihanna growled. \"Nice shot.\" I said, impressed with Rihanna's bitch slap. \"Michael, that's not cool.\" Jason said. \"Would you shut the fuck up, Jason! We're playing a game, man.\" Michael screamed. I scoffed. \"See you two later.\" I said as I walked away. I couldn't stand being in the presence of Michael Cera. I was smoking from my cigarette and after I put it out, I was about to walk back inside, but then I was stopped by James and Seth. So, now, I was now sitting on James's lap. \"Why don't we do a sequel to Pineapple Express?\" James suggested. \"I'd love to do a sequel to Pineapple Express.\" Seth said, excitedly. \"Alana, you in?\" James asked and so I decided to be like my character, Ireland Beauchamp and decided to speak French. \"Saint, merde! J'aimerais faire une suite à Pineapple Express. Je n'ai aucun problème sur dépeindre le fougueux français, la petite amie, les mauvaises herbes-fumeurs de Saul Silver-\" I was saying excitedly but then James covered my mouth. \"I have no idea what you were saying, but it sounded so sexy.\" James said. I could feel myself turn red. \"Do you two have any ideas…\" James started. \"I do have some ideas. It's that Red, Danny, has become, like, the drug lord, you know, since we killed the other one and he wants to assassinate Woody Harrelson 'cause he's gonna make a speech that makes all weed legal, effectively, rendering drug lords out of the business.\" Seth started. \"Awesome.\" James said. \"Yeah, it's fucking awesome, but we don't have...We don't know how it should end yet.\" Seth said. \"I know. Danny's trying to kill us. And I sacrifice myself for you and Alana and I die for you two. And Danny fucking eats me.\" James suggested. \"Why does he eat you?\" I asked. \"I don't know. I'm just trying to think of, like, the nastiest way to go.\" James said. \"Yeah, he could eat you. Okay. That's a good idea, man.\" Seth said. \"He's just out of his mind. He just, like, eats me.\" James said. After that, I was with Chris Mintz-Plasse and Jonah Hill we were having a fun time and we were on the midst of talking about a sequel to Superbad...then Michael fucking Cera came along. \"Hey, does this coke smell funny to you?\" Michael asked as he blew cocaine into Chris's face. Chris was trying to get the coke out of his face. \"What the fuck is wrong with you?\" I asked as I glared at Michael as Jonah and I were trying to calm Chris down because Chris was freaking out about how he has never done cocaine before. We were all back inside as Craig Robinson was sitting and playing a piano with Kevin Hart and James standing by his side. \"Now, fellas, I want you to real sexy right now. We're gonna sing to all the ladies. All the fellas go like this, in your Barry White voice. Take your panties off.\" Craig started. \"Take your panties off.\" the guys sang back. \"Take your panties off.\" Craig sang again. \"Take your panties off.\" the guys sang back. \"Come on, Rihanna, take your panties off for me.\" Craig crooned to Rihanna. \"Come on, Craig. Can you fuck off for me?\" Rihanna sang back. \"I'll do one of them things.\" Craig retorted and we all laughed. \"Like an angel.\" James piped in. \"What about the host of the party?\" Craig asked. \"I ain't got no panties on.\" James sang back. And as everyone was seeming to have a fun time, I saw Jay walked out. I feel so bad for Jay. I knew that parties like this wasn't his style. So, I followed him outside and he was smoking a cigarette. I asked him for a light and he lit my cigarette. I knew that Seth and I shouldn't have pressured Jay into something that would make him uncomfortable. *TRANSLATIONS* (If they are not correct, sorry. I used Google Translate) Saint, merde! J'aimerais faire une suite à Pineapple Express. Je n'ai aucun problème sur dépeindre le fougueux français, la petite amie, les mauvaises herbes-fumeurs de Saul Silver-: Holy, shit! I would love to do a sequel to Pineapple Express. I have no problem on portraying the feisty, French, weed-smoking girlfriend of Saul Silver-[Chapter 4] REVIEW TIMEE!1 Jodie Howell: I tried to base it off on time when Alana moves to LA, which is at 19-20 years old I have no idea how I got here. I was now sitting in James's lap again as everyone was practically criticizing his house. From the corner of my eye, I spotted Jay. \"Hey, Jay.\" Jonah said. \"Oh, hey, hi Jonah.\" Jay said. \"Is there any place around here I could buy a pack of cigarettes?\" Jay asked. \"Yeah, there's a place like, it's like four blocks away, maybe.\" Seth replied. \"You want to come with me?\" Jay asked. \"Give me this much time. This much joint time.\" Seth said, holding up his joint. Then Jay just abruptly leaves. \"You're a fucking idiot.\" I muttered to Seth as I got out of James's lap. \"Babe, it's cold without you here.\" James said. \"Too fucking bad!\" I exclaimed back to James. Jay and I managed to make Seth tag along with us to the gas station to get more cigarettes. \"You okay, man?\" Seth asked. \"It's nothing. It's just, you know, as soon as we got there, you did what you said you wouldn't do.\" Jay said. \"What'd I do?\" Seth asked. \"Holy fuck, Seth. You are so oblivious.\" I muttered. \"You just fucking ditched my ass.\" Jay said. \"I didn't ditch you. Are you kidding me, man?\" Seth asked. \"In my defense, I only ditched you two with James so I wouldn't have to hear him rant about art.\" I said in defense. \"I did not ditch you. I was talking to Jonah and then you left to go have a cigarette.\" Seth said in defense. \"Well, you know, my cigarette was an excuse. I really went outside because Jonah was being a prick.\" Jay said in defense. \"Jonah was not being a prick. If anything, you were kind of being a prick.\" Seth said, defending Jonah. \"Jonah's the nicest guy ever, man.\" Seth said. \"Oh, my God, that's the thin veneer of kindness. Nobody is that nice.\" Jay said. \"Jonah is that nice.\" Seth said as we got up to the entrance to the gas station. \"Serial killers are that nice.\" Jay said. \"Just answer me one question. Is Michael Cera's butthole as adorable as I pictured?\" Seth asked. I covered my ears. \"I heard the story once, I don't want to hear it again.\" I said, referencing to the story on how Jay walked in on two girls giving blowjobs to Michael Cera. \"Oh, for fuck's sake.\" Jay said as we entered. \"I pictured it like a little donut, like a little pink sprinkled donut.\" Seth said. I went with Jay to get something to drink and I grabbed a water bottle and from the corner of my eye, I saw the cashier lady be a bitch to a man and his daughter, whom had to go to the bathroom. On my way back towards Seth, I also grab some Swedish Fish. \"This cash register lady is really mean. I have anxiety. Will you buy this for me? When I'm stoned, I can't do this.\" Seth asked, giving Jay a Milky Way. \"Seth, you are a grown ass man.\" I muttered. \"Yeah, but still.\" Seth protested. \"I think I'm just gonna head back to your place. I'm not liking it very much over at Franco's.\" Jay said. \"Dude, I want you to get to know these guys. That's never gonna happen if you don't put in any effort whatsoever, okay?\" Seth said. \"I hate it in there. I just want to drink some pop and smoke some weed.\" Jay said and then all of the sudden, the glass breaks. I grabbed onto the shelves to keep myself steady. Then, I saw some blue light on some of the customers. A few moments later, they were shot up into the sky. I looked over at Jay. \"What the hell was that?\" I asked Jay. I looked out into the streets and there was a shit ton of chaos going on. \"Are you two okay? Are you two okay?\" Seth asked. \"Did you just see that? What the hell?\" the woman was screaming and then a fan fell ontop of her. We all screamed in horror at that and exited the gas station. We were running from a car almost running us over and into the gas station. \"Jesus!\" I screamed. Then a car ran over an innocent bystander. \"Why the fuck did you bring me down here?\" Jay asked, yelling that as we were running. \"We're going back to Franco's.\" Seth yelled. \"Why?\" Jay yelled. \"Just run! Keep running!\" I screamed. We all winced as a car ran over another car, going into another car, creating a huge fire. \"We are going back to Franco's.\" Seth said. \"Oh, god dammit.\" Jay groaned. We had ran all the way back to James's place and back into the house, causing everyone to stare at us. \"Hey, you guys okay?\" James asked. \"Are you guys okay? There was a crazy earthquake. Did you guys feel that? That was insane.\" Seth asked. \"Fuck no. You can't feel anything in here. This place is a fucking fortress.\" James said. \"That wasn't an earthquake. That was something crazier.\" Jay said. \"What's crazier than an earthquake?\" Craig asked. \"There was beams of blue light coming out of the sky and people getting sucked into the sky.\" Jay said and I nodded, feebly. \"He's on hallucinogens.\" David Krumholtz said as the guys started laughing at Jay. \"That's enough.\" I said. \"Alana's right. Don't bully Jay. He's a sweetheart.\" Jonah said. \"Keep going.\" I said, putting a comforting hand on Jay's shoulder. \"There were people, and they were there and they got sucked into the sky.\" Jay was explaining. From the corner of my eye during Jay's explanation, James was glaring at Jay. \"Sucked up into the sky? Nobody got sucked up in here.\" James said. \"I got sucked off here.\" Michael said and I winced and everyone laughed. \"No, okay. Ask Seth. He was...you were there. Tell them.\" Jay said to Seth, hoping to get some backup. \"Seth, what the fuck is he talking about?\" James asked. \"I have no idea what he's talking about honestly.\" Seth said. \"Are you fucking kidding me?\" I muttered. \"Did anyone get sucked up into the sky?\" James asked, mocking Jay. \"I didn't see anything. I don't know what he's talking about.\" Seth asked. When Seth and Jay were having a mini argument, the place shook. \"Are we crazy now?\" I yelled. \"Everyone, it's alright. Just a little tremor. Party's still going. In-N-Out Truck is coming in 10 minutes!\" James exclaimed, making everyone cheer. Then, it started shaking again. \"Fuck!\" I screamed as I ran out of James's house with everyone else following me. When I got outside, my eyes widened as Jay, Seth and James stood by me. The Hollywood Hills was on fire. \"What the fuck?\" I heard someone yell out. I turned and it was Paul Rudd, running towards us, carrying wine and then he ran over to James. \"Paul!\" James exclaimed. \"What's happening?\" Paul asked. \"All right, everyone, listen up. Listen up. Who took my fucking cell phone, man?\" Michael asked. \"Martin, empty your pockets.\" Michael said to Martin Starr, who is just confused. \"What?\" Martin asked. Then, Michael turns to me. \"Alana, you slut! I know you have it!\" Michael screamed. \"No, I don't. You're fucking coked up!\" I exclaimed to Michael. \"Somebody dial my phone. It's unbelievable. It's unacceptable after all the coke I wasted on you people!\" Michael was whining as he didn't know that the ground was crackling up behind him. I nudged Seth and pointed over at the street light that was now coming towards Michael. Everyone tried to warn him and then he ended up getting stabbed by the street light. Blood went all over on my outfit and into Jason Segal's eyes. \"What's happening to me? What's happening?\" Michael was asking. Then, the street light lifted him up. Then, Michael's phone rang and it was in his pocket. \"Oh, shit, that's embarrassing.\" Michael said. And then a fucking sinkhole appeared from out of nowhere. Everyone was either running away or dying. People who had fell into the sinkhole was Jason, Rihanna, Mindy and everyone who didn't fell in the sinkhole were either holding on or running away. I saw Chris holding on and tried to help him. \"Just keep holding on, Chris!\" I screamed. \"Alana, I can't hold on anymore! I'm gonna die!\" Chris yelled and then his grip on my hand slipped and he fell. \"No!\" I screamed. After Chris fell, Martin fell into the hole. Jay tried to help Paul, but he fell into the sinkhole. I went over to Jay and helped him and I pulled him up and out of the sinkhole. \"Thank God!\" I cried out as I was sobbing in his shoulder. What the holy hell just happened?[Chapter 5] REVIEW TIMEE!1 Guest: Yes, I will continue Jay and I stumbled into the house. \"Jay! Alana!\" Seth exclaimed as he hugged us both. As Seth hugged us, James was going fucking crazy. \"I told you guys not to go outside! What just happened?\" James yelled. \"Jesus Christ, they are all fucking dead.\" Craig said as Jonah led Jay and I towards the couch. Craig was crying on how he tried to save Aziz Ansari. \"Why the fuck did you guys run out there?\" James continued to yell. \"You know what, James, can you lower your voice? You're freaking out Jay!\" Jonah exclaimed. \"Maybe I'm a little freaked out too!\" James shouted. \"He's not as strong as you.\" Jonah said. I dug into my purse to get my phone. When I turned on my phone, there was no service. \"The water's not working!\" Seth cried out. \"My phone's not working.\" Craig said. \"It doesn't matter. There's no service.\" I said, unemotionally. \"Guys, the fucking internet is not working!\" Seth cried out. When James calmed down, he came over to me. I guess he discovered the freaked out state I am in. \"You okay?\" James asked. \"No. I'm freaking out. Maybe this is all a bad dream and I would wake up and everyone would be alive.\" I said and James puts his hand on top of my hand. \"Let's watch the TV.\" James said as he leaned over to get the remote. \"Where's the TV?\" Jay asked. \"In the floor.\" James replied as a TV pops up from out of the floor. Of course he would do something like this. As everyone was commenting on how impressive it was, the news was on. According to the news, it was the biggest earthquake to ever hit Los Angeles and the officers are encouraging people to stay in their homes. Also, looting and rioting are happening as well. Then, the TV shuts down, signalling that there is no signal. \"Shit! It's gone, guys.\" James hissed. \"So, I think we should go back to your place.\" Jay said. \"No. No way. I'm not leaving here.\" Seth said. \"I don't wanna die in James Franco's house.\" Jay said. \"Jay, you're a god friend of mine but you heard what the news said. Everyone has to stay in their homes and we need to stay here until they start rescuing people.\" I said. \"A huge earthquake happens, who do they rescue first? Actors. They get Clooney, Sandra Bullock, me. If there's room, you guys will come. The point is that we are all going to get out of this first.\" Jonah said. Then, it starts shaking again. \"It's already going crazy out there, guys. We can't leave. I'm not leaving, okay? I'm a victim. I've had a victim's mentality my whole life. People can smell it on me. When I was a kid, I had man-titties. The bullies held me down. They tittie-fucked me.\" Seth ranted. \"That's what's happening out there right now.\" James argued. \"That's right, we are all soft. We are all soft! We are actors! We pretend to be hard, man!\" Craig exclaimed as he was going over to grab one of James's artwork. \"Wait, Craig, what are you doing, man?\" James asked as he went over to Craig. \"We got to board this shit up, man!\" Craig exclaimed. \"Board it up?\" James asked. \"We got to protect ourselves. We don't know how long we're going to be in here.\" Craig said. \"He's right. Locked doors and the windows are not gonna do shit.\" I said and Craig and James started fighting over the painting. Then I spot a helicopter. \"Guys!\" I exclaimed as I pointed over to the helicopter. \"Helicopter! Helicopter! The good guys are here. We're fine! It's going to be fine.\" James reassured us. But what we didn't know that the helicopter crash landed and one of the rotor blades went through the window and stuck itself on the painting Craig and James were fighting over. Craig was now cradling his hand. \"God damn! Shit!\" Craig cried out. \"You okay?\" James asked. \"No, I'm not okay! Fuck your house, Franco!\" Craig said as a little cut was on Craig's finger. \"My house didn't do that!\" James said and we all started to board up the house. \"We got 12 bottles of water, 56 beers, 2 vodkas, 4 whiskeys, 6 bottles of wine, tequila, Nutella, cheese, pizza, eggs, bananas, apples, bacon, steaks, pancake mix, CT Crunch, milk, ketchup, a Milky Way, Swedish Fish, half ounce Sour Diesel, three and a half grams of Grand Master Kush, one ounce of shrooms, 15 pills of ecstasy, a porno mag, a baseball bat, and the video camera from the movie 27 Hours.\" Seth listed off. \"127 Hours.\" James corrected and Seth had marked the correction. \"And a functioning revolver from the movie Flyboys.\" Seth added. \"Old Faithful.\" James said as he leaned over and grabbed the revolver. \"Jesus!\" I hissed as we all ducked down. \"Thing's real. You know, I kept this from the movie.\" James said, making us all uncomfortable. The only person who is not uncomfortable with this is Jonah. \"I always keep my props.\" James said. \"Very good to know. Now put the gun down.\" I said. \"He knows what he's doing. I like this bit. I like it. I get it. Let me see.\" Jonah said. \"It's real. It's heavy.\" James said and then he tossed the gun over to Jonah, making us all uncomfortable again. \"Bang, bang.\" Jonah started, playfully pointing the gun at us. \"Please, put it down!\" Seth pleaded, but Jonah didn't listen. \"Bang, bang, you're dead. Pow, pow, pow.\" Jonah continued. \"Guys, stop fucking with the gun!\" I exclaimed. \"We're getting sidetracked.\" Jay said. \"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll just kill myself.\" Jonah said, pointing the gun to his head. \"No!\" we all exclaimed. \"Jonah, give it back.\" James said. \"Oh, no. I don't know! I don't know! I'm so…\" Jonah started and then he puts the gun in his mouth. \"Can you put the thing down?\" I asked. \"I'm trying to have some fun.\" Jonah said as he hands the gun back to James. \"Look, just because a bunch of people fell into a hole outside, doesn't mean we can't have some fun. We're a bunch of best friends hanging out. It's like a sleepover. \"Okay, food. How are we gonna deal with this?\" Seth asked. \"Uh, yeah. If anyone touches the Swedish Fish, you're dead.\" I said, snatching up the Swedish Fish. \"Can I have that Milky Way?\" Jonah asked. \"No, you can't have the Milky Way. That's my Milky Way. I went out this morning and specifically bought this Milky Way to eat after my party.\" James said. \"That's weird.\" Jay stated. \"It's not weird. It's my special food. Seth, Lana-Bear, back me up on that.\" James said. \"I don't think you should get the whole Milky Way. I want some of the Milky Way.\" Seth said and I pointed at him, agreeing with him. \"I'd be pretty bummed if I don't at least get a bite of the Milky Way.\" Craig said. \"Oh, now Craig wants some of the Milky Way?\" James asked. \"Yeah, I want a bite of the Milky Way. It's a fucking Milky Way.\" Craig defended. \"A sixth of everything is what's fair and reasonable.\" Jay said, playing the peacemaker. \"Everyone gets a sixth of everything.\" Seth said. \"I want the sixth of your T-Shirt. I want the bottom part, the belly.\" James said. \"I'm not sporting a crop top in your house.\" Craig said. \"I'll cut that shit off and make a headband.\" James said. \"You couldn't handle my midriff.\" Craig said. \"Guys, the only issue is that I kind of need the Milky Way.\" Jonah said. \"Great, we're back on the Milky Way again.\" I said as Jay facepalmed. \"No, for real, I have Low Blood Sugar and if my endorphins drop too low, I'm gonna be a nightmare to be around.\" Jonah said. \"Your LBS starts acting up, you can have a finger scoop of Nutella.\" James compromised. \"Fair.\" Jonah said. \"I'm going to bed.\" James said as he grabbed the gun and my hand and we headed upstairs to his room. \"You're lucky that I have a stash of clothes for you here.\" James said as I picked out a Guns N' Roses tank top and grey shorts. After I got changed, I went over to James. \"So, what is that thing that you need to tell me after the party?\" I asked. He leaned over and connected his lips to mine, taking me by shock. A minute later, I started to kiss back. I'll admit, I have a tiny crush on James, but I didn't know that he would actually kiss me. He disconnects his lips from mine and smirked at my shocked expression. \"You don't know how long I wanted to do that. And not for the movies.\" James said.

Enjoy~ OoOOoOO Um romance entre os cavaleirosntemplários By Mafê Ly** Umndisparo. Barulho. Um tiro certeiro. Um acidente. Alexnestava atônito. Seus olhos verdes percorriam o quarto, paravam oranna arma, ora no corpo do homem que agora estava caído no chão,nmanchando-o de sangue. EncarounNigel e percebeu que este também o encarava, de modo inexpressivo. -MeunDeus... Onloiro largou a arma no chão e saiu do quarto. O que acabara denfazer?! Foi um acidente! Nunca quis matar ninguém. Nigel o deixaranconfuso com toda aquela situação, não percebeu quando puxou ongatilho, não percebeu quando... Estavanandando pela casa a passos largos, as mãos na cabeça, estavandesesperado. Já havia descido as escadas e agora andava de um lado,nvoltava para o outro, sua mente vagando para todos os lugaresnpossíveis. -nMeu Deus...O que eu fiz? Eu, eu matei uma pessoa! Meu Deus! –ncomeçou a falar alto, como se isso fosse ajudar em algo - Eu...eu...nComo...? Eu matei uma pessoa! -nSe acalme – Nigel apareceu no corredor que dava em direção ànporta, encarando Alex, que parou de andar em círculos para encará-lon– Está tudo bem. – ele continuou frio. -nComo assim?! - ele disse indignado - Você é louco, Nigel?!- elevouno tom de voz novamente, irritado – Eu matei uma pessoa! -Falenbaixo, se não as pessoas irão ouvir.- preveniu, já que o colega denquarto estava quase gritando – E fique calmo, Jack. -Parende me chamar de Jack, porra!- ele gritou irado – Não tem comonficar calmo agora! Eu não sou como você! Eu não sou um maníaco! –nchegou mais perto de Nigel – Eu não mato a sangue-frio, eu não sou assim! -Estántudo bem, eu o odiava.- Nigel disse como se a morte de seu pai nãonfosse nada. -Calana boca! Meu Deus, EU MATEI UMA PESSOA! Comonnum impulso, Nigel se aproximou, passando sua mão direita pela nucande Alex e beijou-o. Nigel cessou o beijo que havia começado. -nO-o que?! – o loiro estava mais atônito – Por que você feznisso?! -nEu disse para você se acalmar, poderia chamar a atenção dosnvizinhos – o moreno explicou ainda perto do rosto de Alex. Apesarnde toda a situação em que se encontrava, Alex não pode deixar denpensar que o beijo de Nigel era bom. Não era um beijo normal, podensentir um desejo por trás dele, paixão. Poderia dizer que eranviciante. Saiunde seus pensamentos, encarando os olhos azuis à sua frente. Sempreninexpressivos e frios. E aquela expressão, junto com os cabelosnperfeitamente arrumados, a blusa branca definindo o tórax, além donsangue que respingou no braço esquerdo e na face de Nigel só fezncom que Alex tivesse mais vontade de beijá-lo. Não!nNo que estava pensando! Não é possível que uma coisa daquelasnpassou por sua cabeça ainda mais numa hora como aquela! Suanvontade falou mais alto. Aproximou-se do moreno e beijou-o, não senimportando no momento com o que Nigel pensava ou faria. Para a sortende Alex, ele somente ficou parado. -Temosnque limpar o quarto. – foi o que Nigel disse antes de virar asncostas e subir em direção ao quarto onde jaziam os cadáveres. Depoisnde duas horas estava tudo limpo, como se não tivesse ocorrido doisnassassinatos ali. -nPreciso falar com você, Jack. – Nigel disse no tom costumeiro,nsentando-se na ponta da cama, apoiando os antebraços nas coxas. Alexncontinuou em pé, esperando. – Sente-se. -nNão, estou bem aqui. -Estáncom medo de mim? – ele perguntou com um sorriso surgindo no cantondos lábios. Alex o encarou irritado e sentou-se na cama. -Não. Ficaramnpor algum tempo em silêncio. Não sentia medo de Nigel, não mais.nPor mais que tenha falado tantas vezes para ele deixá-lo em paz, senafastar, agora Alex o queria perto de si. Talveznfosse o jeito de Nigel, sempre misterioso e curioso, como um livronpara ser lido, como uma nova descoberta de historiadores sobre osnCavaleiros Templários. Queria desvendar todos os mistérios contidosndentro daquele ser à sua frente. -nEntão, o que você quer dizer? -Eunrealmente gosto de você...-disse olhando Alex diretamente nos olhosn– Alex. Erana primeira vez que ouvira Nigel dizer seu nome, e soava de umanmaneira muito excitante. Aquilo tudo era excitante na verdade,ncometer assassinatos, ter uma paixão proibida, um vício que senapoderava de seu corpo. -nE eu sei que sente o mesmo. – o moreno concluiu olhando para Alex,nque estava incrédulo. Inesperadamente,nNigel beijou-o de novo, de forma mais ardente e desejosa. Alexnabraçou o pescoço do adolescente a sua frente, enquanto os braçosndo mesmo estavam abraçando sua cintura. Cessaram por falta de ar. Ambosnestavam ofegantes e com as faces a poucos centímetros de distância.nAlex chegou perto do ouvido de Nigel e perguntou: -nVocê me ama? -nO...que? -nPorque eu te amo...Quero saber se também me ama- disse num sussurro,nfazendo o inexpressivo Nigel se arrepiar um pouco. -nAmo. - demorou um pouco para responder. Alex sorriu e, ainda no péndo ouvido do outro disse. -Entãonme deixe ser sua Maraclea ,nNigel. Agoranestava surpreso. O que Alex estava dizendo? Ele tinha a mínima idéiando que aquilo significava? -Vocêno que?! -nQuero ser sua Maraclea.- ele disse agora já afastado, olhando-onseriamente. -nVocê sabe o que- mas foi cortado. -nEu sei o que estou dizendo, sei o que vai acontecer. -nVocê não tem que fazer isso! -nMas eu quero fazer! -nEu...Alex... -Vamosnlá, Nigel! Você já matou muitas pessoas! Eu só serei mais uma! Nigelnestava realmente surpreso, o que Alex estava falando era verdade.nNunca hesitou em matar uma pessoa antes, muito pelo contrário,nsempre planejou tudo minuciosamente. -nVocê me ama! É perfeito, não é? Exatamente como naquela época. -Não,nnão existiram Cavaleiros Templários homossexuais...Maraclea era umanmulher...- estava tentando tirar aquela idéia da cabeça doncompanheiro a qualquer custo. -Entãonacho que está na hora que criarmos a nossa versão da história, nãoné? –disse em tom de deboche pegando a arma, que não fora guardadanquando estavam limpando o quarto, e colocando-a nas mãos de Nigel.-nVamos, se você não fizer, eu farei. -Nãonposso fazer isso, Jack... -Vocênacha que ele não sofreu ao descobrir que sua amada havia morrido?-nele disse, relembrando da história. – Você será recompensado.

Je n'ai vu le film qu'une seule fois, il y a quelques semaines, et voilà le résultat : une sorte de souvenir fantasmé. Les évènements sont embrouillés, pas toujours très cohérents. Partez du principe qu'Alex alterne mensonges et vérités, qu'il monte tout le monde en bateau, même l'auteur de la fiction ! Un peu de folie, ça fait toujours du bien ~ Ces personnages ne m'appartiennent pas, ils sont la propriété de leur créateur, Mr Read. Brûlures de Chlore et d'Acide. Le quotidien d'Alex Forbes prenait des allures de cauchemar éveillé. Vous savez, ce genre de cauchemar atroce où vous êtes poursuivi par quelque chose , sans aucun endroit où vous cacher (aucun abri physique, aucune retraite mentale), et où ce quelque chose auquel vous essayez d'échapper se trouve également être un aimant terrifiant ? Partout, il est partout, même là où vous ne l'attendez pas, et quand vous croyez lui avoir échappé, vos pas vous mènent directement à lui. C'était exactement ce que vivait Alex, et il pensait sincèrement devenir fou avant la fin de l'année scolaire. Ou commettre un suicide. Ou un meurtre. Ou les deux. Et encore, il n'était même pas sûr de trouver la paix dans la mort. Le monstre du cauchemar, c'était Nigel Colbie. Adolescent chétif, taciturne, pas vraiment du genre remarquable, pas vraiment du genre agréable ( Voire même du genre détestable ), cheveux noirs, yeux bleus lointains ( On dirait qu'il ne voit pas les mêmes choses que nous, que son regard est posé sur des univers éloignés, des temps reculés. Voilà, c'est ça. Ce gars-là voit à des années-lumière de la réalité. ), avec un penchant malsain pour les dissections, les animaux empaillés, et tout ce qui bougeait autrefois mais qui ne bougerait plus. Le meilleur ami d'Alex par exemple, mort quelques jours auparavant. Et à qui la faute ? Nigel Colbie. Alex n'oublierait jamais le regard du brun quand il s'était tourné vers lui après avoir refusé d'aider Josh à remonter dans le train et l'avoir laissé s'écraser contre le poteau. Un regard complètement apathique, complètement vide. Pourtant, il avait cherché – oh oui, il avait cherché ! – tout au fond de cette mer glacée, l'ombre de la peur, de la terreur, un éclat de satisfaction ou de sadisme, un éclair de tristesse, de fatalisme, n'importe quoi qui aurait pu combler ce néant d'un bleu insoutenable. Mais il n'avait rien trouvé, et le regard continuait de hanter ses nuits. Il n'y avait pas que le regard qui hantait ses nuits. Parfois, Alex avait l'impression que Nigel lui rendait visite en personne, alors que tout l'établissement dormait. Il croyait entendre son souffle, bas et régulier ; il croyait sentir sa présence, la chaleur diffuse de son corps, et même son odeur ; au matin, il croyait voir sur le matelas une marque là où le monstre s'était assis. Alors, il avait décidé de ne plus dormir. Il avait attendu que la porte de sa chambre grince et s'entrouvre pour laisser passer l'ombre de Nigel, mais rien ne s'était produit. Pourtant, il l'avait senti ! De vagues effluves dans l'air (celles des produits qu'il utilisait lors des ses expériences sur les animaux morts), des frissons courant sur sa peau, et cette impression de n'être jamais seul ! Nigel partageait sa chambre jusqu'à récemment, certes, mais il n'était pas resté assez longtemps pour qu'elle soit à ce point imprégnée de son essence, non. Peut-être était-ce simplement lui qui ne parvenait pas à se défaire de l'empreinte de l'assassin. Le jour ne lui était pas plus bénéfique. Tous ses prétendus camarades l'évitaient, après tout, il était le meilleur ami du mort, et les rumeurs allaient bon train. Meurtrier, lui ? Il n'arrivait pas à envisager que l'on puisse penser ainsi. Ils étaient trois cette nuit-là, deux avaient survécu mais c'était lui qu'on pensait coupable ? Bah, ceux qui étaient persuadés de son innocence le prenaient pour un lâche qui n'osait pas ouvrir sa gueule pour dénoncer le véritable responsable. Avaient-ils vraiment tort ? Pourquoi n'était-il pas allé trouver les autorités pour leur dire : « Nigel Colbie n'a pas porté assistance à Josh, c'est de sa faute si ce dernier est mort » ? Quelque chose l'en empêchait, mais il ignorait quoi. Sans doute le souvenir du regard de Nigel et la peur de devoir le croiser à nouveau, les mains maculées de son propre sang cette fois-ci. Nigel. Le seul à lui avoir souri depuis des jours et des jours. Le seul à lui avoir adressé la parole, également, certes pas pour lui dire des choses agréables. Des histoires sur un lien qu'Alex niait invariablement, et qui commençaient à l'agacer plus que de raison. Force était pourtant de constater qu'il ne se passait pas un seul instant sans qu'il pense à lui, d'une manière ou d'une autre. Mais que pouvait-il y faire ? Nigel était partout. Il était comme sa peur, plus présent encore que son ombre. Il l'avait... infecté, et comme toute personne infectée, Alex n'avait qu'un seul désir : se débarrasser de son poison. Grâce à une fille ? Quelqu'un qui occuperait ses pensées et qui prendrait la place de Nigel. Susan. Ce fut un échec. L'autre ne partirait pas, il ne partirait plus. Pire encore, il en profita pour mêler l'innocente à ses plans diaboliques. À leurs plans. Alex n'arrivait plus à penser par lui-même. Il savait pourtant que ce n'était pas à sens unique, et que l'âme de Nigel lui était ouverte. Mais il ne pouvait pas, il ne pouvait pas plonger en lui. C'était trop tard, n'est-ce pas ? Il prendrait un risque inconsidéré. Il avait peur de se perdre complètement, d'aider Nigel à se déverser dans son esprit. Peut-être essaierait-il malgré tout. Le cauchemar empirait de jour en jour, nuit après nuit. Religion, Cathares, Templiers, ordres secrets, nécrophilie, mort, vie, union. Éternité. « Jack. » Il détestait ce nom. Nigel le détestait aussi, mais la colère d'Alex lui suffisait amplement comme contrepartie. « Jack. » La ferme. Le visage sans vie de Susan luisait dans la pénombre, elle rayonnait dans sa mort telle une vierge antique. Il se retourna, Nigel était parti. Son regard retomba sur Susan, ses cheveux, ses joues, ses cils, ses lèvres. La curiosité fut plus forte, et il retira complètement le drap mortuaire, dévoilant son corps bleuâtre, tatoué de cicatrices et d'hématomes, à la peau tendue sur les os saillants. Il ferma les yeux. Quelque chose grandissait en lui. Son âme avait pris feu, son corps brûlait. Pas de belles flammes rouges et oranges, mais plus un incendie chimique, comme si tous les composants de sa personne physique se révoltaient contre ce qu'il leur faisait subir. Quant à son âme, ou ce qu'il en restait, Nigel l'avait probablement noyée dans son venin depuis longtemps déjà. Leur proximité grandissait, aussi insoutenable et abjecte qu'elle fût pour Alex, il était impossible de le nier cette fois. Leur lien mental cherchait à s'étendre, inévitablement, sur le plan physique. Chaque frôlement devenait un coup, chaque souffle un brasier. Alex cherchait à éviter le contact, et Nigel lui rappelait à quel point il était pathétique d'essayer de résister. Ils étaient faits pour s'unir, et lutter contre cette évidence ne servait qu'à retarder de peu l'échéance. Nigel. Alex ne pouvait même plus respirer sans qu'il soit là, quelque part. Il était déjà en lui, dans chaque fibre de son corps, dans chaque parcelle de son esprit. L'autre le tourmentait chaque jour un peu plus, le torturait avec son sourire, avec le voile de désir qui obscurcissait ses yeux, avec chacun de ses gestes, et avec chacune de ses paroles. Des ignominies, des mensonges, des menaces, des poèmes sublimes dans leur horreur, des provocations, des promesses, et encore et toujours ce même refrain sur l'Éternité. Alex ne cèderait pas. Du moins essaya-t-il de ne pas céder. Un jour vit un geste – ou était-ce une parole ? – de trop. Un couteau, du sang, quelque chose comme cela. Il ne lui fallut pas longtemps pour trouver Nigel, ni trop de persuasion pour l'obliger à le suivre. Où ? C'était une bonne question. L'endroit était flou dans le souvenir d'Alex. Sans doute la forêt près de l'établissement. Là, il frappa Nigel. Une fois, sans réaction. Une deuxième fois, sans réaction. Avec un grondement féroce, il se jeta sur l'autre et le frappa encore et encore, cherchant à lui arracher le moindre cri. Mais il ne se débattait pas, pas plus qu'il ne se défendait, et dans son regard brillait une satisfaction malsaine qui déclencha un accès de violence chez Alex. Un coup de plus, et ce fut un sourire qui se dessina sur les lèvres du brun. Alex criait, hurlait, insultait, jurait, retenait des larmes d'effroi. Et sous lui, Nigel ne le quittait pas des yeux, avec cet air supérieur et cet éclat de rire silencieux marqué sur son visage, abominable démon aux cils charmeurs. « Putain, va pas me faire croire que t'aimes ça ! » Et Alex l'insulta de plus belle, le secoua, le roua de coups, en proie à une terreur sans nom. Jusqu'à ce qu'il comprenne la raison du sourire. L'équilibre. Pour la première fois depuis le début de leur relation, ils avaient atteint l'équilibre. Il s'arrêta, les yeux écarquillés et la bouche bée, exténué. Alors seulement, Nigel s'autorisa un petit « aïe », ses traits se tordant de douleur. « J'ai pas besoin de te faire croire quoi que ce soit. Si ? » Non. Les yeux d'Alex se fermèrent à nouveau, et le goût du sang trouva chemin jusqu'à ses lèvres. Nigel. Il n'avait même pas besoin d'ouvrir les paupières pour le savoir. L'autre avait à peine posé sa bouche contre la sienne, retenant sa respiration, parfaitement immobile. Et il sentait le sang de Nigel. Le sang de ce putain de monstre . Une boule de désir incongru se forma dans son ventre, et il rouvrit les yeux, repoussa le brun et le plaqua au sol avant de fondre sur lui. Leurs bouches se cognèrent plus qu'elles ne se rencontrèrent, et Alex songea véritablement à étouffer Nigel avec sa propre langue, l'embrassant comme s'il possédait les clefs de la rédemption, mordant et ses lèvres et sa langue pour goûter une nouvelle fois à son sang. Nigel ne se plaignait pas, et Alex sembla l'entendre dire, directement d'esprit à esprit : « Ton tour. ». Et alors, enfin, il sentit l'équilibre. Il se vengeait, se libérait. C'était lui le monstre, désormais, et cette idée avait, malgré tout le plaisir qu'il en tirait, un arrière-goût amer de défaite. Cette peau frémissante sous ses griffes, ces lèvres vermeilles entrouvertes dans un cri silencieux, ces yeux qui ne le quittaient toujours pas et qui vrillaient son âme jusqu'à l'insoutenable, tout lui appartenait. Comme Nigel possédait son esprit, lui possédait son corps, qui semblait rayonner de sa propre lueur blafarde et lunaire sous le couvert des arbres tordus et des nuages bas. Alex l'étreignait avec avidité et fureur, pressant sa poitrine comme pour l'étouffer, caressant son cou comme pour l'étrangler, le serrant comme pour lui broyer les os. Les larmes brouillaient sa vue, et seule la silhouette lumineuse de Nigel restait visible. C'était un gouffre qui s'était ouvert en lui, et ce n'était qu'en aspirant le démon tout entier que celui-ci pourrait se refermer. Aucun manque, cependant. Juste un désir brûlant et égoïste d'engloutir ce qui lui était semblable, de détruire ce qui nuisait à sa singularité. Était-ce aussi ce qu'avait ressenti Nigel ? Son regard d'azur accroché au sien, il crut y lire la réponse. Il redoubla alors d'ardeur, entièrement soumis à la violence de sa convoitise, et tout – plaisir, douleur, haine, dégoût, besoin – se confondit. Un vague sentiment d'amour, peut-être, parce qu'un orgueilleux ne peut qu'aimer son reflet.

Je n"},{"Movie":"Like Minds","Title":"Like Minds Fanfic - Hurt me","Author":"MicheSpade","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9807124","Passage":"[Chapter 1] It was a rainy day like all the others from the weeks before. Alex just finished his last class, and he couldn't keep himself from grieving about the death of his best friend again. Josh. The basement of the school wasn't as pleasant as it used to be. In fact, now Josh was gone and Raj had find his new (and \"better\") friends, the basement was a more boring place to be than any else where. The walls didn't let go an echoing laughter and there were no sudden sparks caused by Josh who used to mess around with gunpowder causing Raj to get angry. Alex stood alone, his hands resting in the pockets of his trousers, and he sighed as he looked down at the little spot in the corner. It was the spot where he and his friends used to sit. The table was still there, together with the stools they used to sit on. They were nothing more but empty chairs at an empty table now. 'I'm still really sorry about your friend,' a voice suddenly whispered from behind – yet it was clear and familiar. Alex turned immediately, though only with the upper part of his body. His torso. And he gritted his teeth. 'What are you doing here?' Alex asked patronizing. His voice was bitter and sneering. 'Can't you ever leave me alone for a moment?' 'You just had different class,' the voice continued as soft footsteps came with it. Someone walked down the stairs. No one less than Nigel. His bag dangled in his left hand, and just as Alex he was wearing his school uniform. 'So? That's class . In class I can't be alone either.' 'Yet you were rid of me,' Nigel smirked briefly as he finally reached the solid basement floor. 'Thank heavens,' Alex muttered. 'It's almost a pity I'm finished for today.' Nigel smirked again, passing Alex in a slow pass to put his bag on one of the chairs – the one where Raj sat on the last time they were there. 'Well, I can teach you something,' Nigel commented at last. The smirk was still lightly visible at the corners of his mouth. Alex lifted his brows, being apparently rather surprised by those words, and he cocked his head – holding back a ridicule chortle. 'Like what? Taxidermy?' He was about to turn around and walk away when Nigel suddenly grabbed his upper arm, looking more serious now while frowning his brows. He looked difficult. 'No,' he replied then, as if he thought Alex had been for real. 'No of course not.' His voice was soft now. 'I can teach you how to be Jack again.' Alex jerked off, gritting his teeth by annoyance. 'My name is Alex. Stop fucking calling me Jack!' 'Well I'm sorry Jack, but you were the one who got inside my head.' Alex clenched his fist and before he knew it he crushed it against Nigel's face, causing Nigel to topple backwards and groan by pain. 'Guess that means I got to beat myself out of your fucking head then.' Despite the punch should've hurt, and it probably did, Nigel leaned against the table – using his elbows and lower back for that – while smirking as if he were enjoyed. His once shiny white teeth were covered with ruby red blood now, in all of the sudden, and his eyes were closed as he chuckled. As if he was actually enjoying the pain of his bruised nose. Blood came streaming down his nostrils, and at least this meant one certain thing. Alex had hit him good, yet he didn't like the way it didn't seem to affect Nigel a single bit. He shouldn't enjoy it. He should rather be afraid for once and leave the fuck out of here. 'What's so funny?' Alex sneered through his gritted teeth, It appeared Nigel wasn't going to answer. His pale, thin and long index and middle finger stroked along his lower lip, causing some blood to get on it, and he rubbed it against his thumb fascinatedly as he checked it. 'Always venting your anger this way…' Nigel eventually said. The tip of his tongue stroked along his front teeth, and he smirked again – widely. 'This is Jack.' 'Shut up,' Alex hissed as he turned his back at him. He didn't want to hear it. 'Next time it'll be broken. I assure you.' He was referring to Nigel's nose. It was actually a miracle that it hadn't already. 'You know pain doesn't affect me, right, Alex?' Nigel hardened his gaze now, yet looking quite mischievous. 'You can hurt me as many times as you want…' Alex his shoulder sunk in, and it looked like he was about to faint any moment – if just by annoyance and exhaust. '-Okay?' Alex didn't answer. 'That's right,' Nigel nodded then, pushing him self off the table then. Roughly he thumbed the tip of his tongue along his upper lip again, tasting the frequent taste of coppery blood. 'You can't outrun this, Alex.' Alex threw his glance back at Nigel again, yet didn't further respond or moved. His expression was hardened, his eyes throwing daggers, and all of his muscles were tensed. If Nigel crossed the limit, what he would very soon if he wasn't about to stop, he probably regret his words in seconds. Making Alex angry was something you should rather not do. 'We're chosen …' Nigel eventually continued – though lightly hesitating as if he was gauging Alex his limit. Nigel declared to know much about Alex so that meant he should actually know how to find his limit too. In all of the sudden Alex moved, grabbing Nigel's throat as he firmly pushed him back onto the table, and he hovered about his slender figure – waiting for the blood to block Nigel's airways and throat so he would choke slowly. 'I said shut the fuck up, freak!' It appeared that by the hit on the table Nigel's nose had remarkably continued bleeding heavier, what caused him to cough out blood as Alex remained strangling him. Nigel's eyes narrowed angrily. His feet kicked against Alex his upper legs, and with lots of struggles he tried to get rid of Alex his hands around his throat. Saying freak had been Nigel's limit, apparently. Of course Alex didn't let go. He was much stronger and taller than Nigel was, and he was also on top. Nigel fiercely piled up some blood on the tip of his tongue. Despite the lack of oxygen he forced himself to keep his eyes fixated on Alex's, and after some seconds he spit the large mass of saliva and blood out in Alex's face. Alex cursed, leaning back to quickly wipe it off his face, what gave Nigel the opportunity to gasp for breath again. His hand grabbed to his throat, rubbing the bruised spaces around his arteries and muscles. His throat suddenly became horribly sore. 'Little piece of shit,' Alex gritted through his teeth, still hysterically rubbing the blood and saliva from his cheeks. Nigel tightly grabbed the edges of the table, yet that wasn't because he was afraid to be pushed off it, but because he was angry. Nigel, the slender, quiet, mysterious handsome boy. Furious even, yet still motionlessly laying on the table. 'You're fucking insane,' Alex remarked then. This quickly resulted Nigel to move, because before Alex knew it he felt a fist crushing against his jaw too. Alex stumbled on his feet, being highly surprised, pissed and flabbergasted at the exact same time, and he tried his best to stay on his feet. Nigel immediately sat still again, staring at Alex wide eyed – though not in panic. Alex tasted blood and felt how his lower lip started to swell. What just happened? 'Did you just hit me?' Alex suddenly asked as if he actually needed a clarification. Nigel didn't respond, obviously, and only stared back at him cold-eyed as he leaned back against the table. As if he invited Alex to hurt him again . Alex his muscles tensed. The artery on his forehead became visible just as always whenever he got mad, and in seconds he kicked into him again – smashing his fist for a second time against his face, yet this time against his pale, perfectly shaped jawline. 'Screw you!' Alex growled as he grabbed Nigel's shoulders, firmly pushing his back against the solid table again so he would lie upon it like he did before. Nigel didn't lay still this time, though. He huffed, groaned, and decided to grab Alex his throat too now – though he quickly changed the position of his hands towards his shoulder so he could pull him upon him first. Maybe that wasn't his best move, because this caused Alex to put his full weight onto Nigel, yet he could strangle Alex back now. Alex huffed, forcing his hands back to Nigel's throat, and Nigel coughed since the blood was piling up in his throat again. 'Feel it, Jack !' Nigel groaned with this rough edge to his voice. His nose wrinkled and his dark brows diagonally pointed downwards. 'Stop running away Jack !' he demanded. Alex hissed, clenching his jaws together as he tried to put all his strength to the muscles in his hands, yet it seemed like something counteracted him. ' There ,' Nigel gritted through his bloodied lips and teeth. 'I know you feel it!' He was near choking, yet his lips curled up again. He knew he was right. He could sense Alex knew exactly what he was talking about. There was no way to fool him. Nigel's eyes slowly started to roll backwards. The lack of oxygen became slowly too much than he could bare, so sooner or later Alex had to let go of his throat… Nigel's grip loosened. His hands slowly slid down to Alex his chest, and it appeared he was about to knock out any moment. Yet, then it came. Alex loosened his grip, staring at Nigel as he audibly gasped for breath, and he bend more forward – stroking his thumb along the corner of Nigel's mouth to smear out some bit of blood. 'Tell me you feel it…' Nigel whispered breathlessly at last, his eyes staring begging. Alex clamped his hand around Nigel's jaw, smearing another bit of blood over Nigel's lips, and it seemed like he wasn't going to answer. His expression would be scaring to any human being right now. His eyes stood empty yet dangerous, with the most of his muscles tensed as he panted. One wrong move, and he would break Nigel's neck in a snap – it seemed. ' Jack ?' Alex hovered closer now. Forcefully he stroked his fingers along Nigel's jaw, making sure the bruises would be noticed, and he forced him to open his mouth – if just partially. Alex moved over, rubbing his lips along Nigel's now, and his tongue scooped up the bit of blood being left on the inner corner of his mouth. Nigel hissed, wanting to push Alex out of his personal space, yet he couldn't manage too. Alex buried his teeth in his lower lip, making sure it would hurt. 'What are you doing to me?' he breathed so Nigel had to taste him in his mouth. Nigel swallowed, trying to hold still now since he knew he couldn't do anything against Alex's strength, and he pursed his lips. 'I'm doing what's right, Jack. I'm making you notice what you refuse to see.' Alex gasped heavily, moving his legs now so he had Nigel's legs at both sides of his waist, and he held Nigel's lower back. 'Did you drug me?' he questioned breathlessly, burying his face in Nigel's neck now. 'No, Jack. It's the connection. You're feeling it, but it's new to you.' Alex's fist smashed against the table next to Nigel's head, and despite his steady face, he flinched lightly. 'Shut up!' Alex growled. 'SHUT UP!' 'You were the one asking me, Jack,' Nigel replied cold-tuned. He narrowed his eyes lightly. He wasn't satisfied with this at all. 'One more word,' Alex growled as he grabbed Nigel's hair at the back and pulled it so his chin lifted up forcefully. Nigel groaned, but smirked lightly at the same time. 'Still denial,' he grinned. Alex jerked off now. He pushed Nigel firmly against the table and simply walked away. However, he wasn't planning to leave. No. He was thinking of how to get Nigel quiet. Nigel in the meantime continued smirking. While Alex rubbed his chin with lots of frustration, Nigel simply laid there to watch him – enjoying what he saw. However, this quickly got changed, because in all of the sudden Alex turned and grabbed Nigel's shirt to pull him off the table and force him to the ground. Nigel fell on his hands and knees. While choking in the blood and saliva that was still located in his mouth, he forced himself to stay steady and confident, and Alex approached. With a firm kick against Nigel's stomach he made him flip roughly, ending up lying on the floor on his back – still coughing yet smirking. 'You sick fuck,' Alex gritted through his teeth as he kneeled down next to him. Nigel breathed heavily and thumbed his tongue along his red lips to taste his own blood once more. 'Do it again,' Nigel suddenly breathed as he grabbed Alex's wrist. Alex frowned deeply, cocking his head in confuse, and he parted his lips what made him forget his anger for a couple of seconds. 'Hurt me,' Nigel continued. 'I know you want it, Jack .' Before Alex realized so, he smashed his flattened hand against Nigel's cheek again. Nigel laughed mockingly, blinking a couple of times while shaking his head. 'What on earth was that, Alex? Are you kidding me?' He clenched his teeth dissatisfied and sighed. 'I said hurt me.' Alex took place on top of him now. However, this went slowly, and he inhaled deeply as if he tried to concentrate himself before an operation. Nigel watched him closely. His eyes stood dark, and he clenched his fists as if he was angry and again not satisfied. Alex suddenly bend over then. While grabbing Nigel's hair again he buried his face in his neck, and as he roughly pulled Nigel's hair roots, he buried his teeth in Nigel's skin until it hurt. Nigel groaned, clenching his teeth as his tongue pressed against his palate, and he closed his eyes. Alex opened his mouth now, suddenly using his tongue instead of his teeth, and sucked at his skin while lightly grinding his body along those of Nigel. 'I fucking hate you,' he sneered, following by another hungrily kiss in his neck. A hitch got audible in Nigel's breath, and his cheeks fluttered bright red – yet not by shame. 'Prove it,' Nigel breathed, as if he wasn't convinced by that yet despite Alex had just hit him plenty of times. Alex pulled back a bit now. Their eyes met. He kept his face closely to Nigel's, and remained silence for a moment. They could both taste each other's breath on their tongue. It almost looked like a staring contest now. Slowly Alex leaned more close. The tip of his nose stroked along Nigel's, and he slightly shut his eyes while staring at his lips as if they were hypnotizing. Nigel moved his hand up to Alex's back now, holding him there as if it was a way of encouraging, and then suddenly it happened. Alex pressed his lips onto Nigel's, kissing his lips to taste the iron of his blood. Both of their heartbeats rose. After sharing this one little kiss they both desired for more, and so Nigel clenched his fist around the cloth of Alex's shirt, and Alex put more force into it. Their lips pressed closed. While biting in Nigel's lower lip until it drew blood, Nigel tried to get rid of Alex's shirt, and Alex let him. During a small break he gave him the opportunity to throw it aside, letting Nigel's shirt follow all the way. Nigel opened his mouth and breathed, wanting to say something, but Alex pushed him forcefully back to the ground and gritted his teeth. 'Shut up,' he muttered, bending over him again. He kissed Nigel's chin, following his jawline back to his neck again, and softly snapped at Nigel's Adam's apple. Nigel lifted his chin a bit more, burying his nails in Alex's back, and choked in a groan that he'd try to hold back. 'You know you're giving into it by this?' Nigel muttered as he tried to keep his eyes from rolling by enjoyment. He groaned by the unpleasant feeling of a kick in his stomach, yet he smirked. Alex moved back up now, meeting Nigel's eyes again, and noticed Nigel was looking curiously. Alex forced his thumb in Nigel's mouth, and made him suck it as he pressed it against the edges of his teeth. 'I told you to shut up.' Alex stroked his thumb along his lips now and wetted some dried spots of blood. 'So you better listen.' He pressed his lips onto his again, thumbing his tongue along his, and cringed his belly. A groan escaped his throat now. 'You're accepting your role,' Nigel groaned as he grabbed a fist full of hair. Alex jerked away Nigel's hand, and pulled back dissatisfied. 'Stop the bullshit.' 'It's not bullshit,' Nigel frowned offended now. 'Open your eyes, Alex. Show me Jack. Give me what I want-' Nigel cringed. Alex just crushed his fist against his face again, and this time he hit his eye. Alex breathed heavily. While Nigel cupped his eye, he decided to continue his sweet torture by moving to his chest, and he passionately kissed his skin as he hungrily reached for his hips. 'You're an awful creature that no-one likes,' Nigel remarked through his clenched jaws. '-Says the one who stalks me to death.' Nigel smirked and hitched as Alex reached his abdomen. 'You've got no one left. Raj blames you for Josh his death, and he has all the rights to.' Alex his expression hardened, and he paused for a moment. After this, it appeared Nigel wasn't done speaking yet. '-It's your fault he died. You should've never been so stupid and sloppy.' Alex buried his teeth in Nigel's skin now, and bit hard until it lightly bled. Nigel cried in silence, trying to push Alex away, but didn't manage to. 'He hates you now,' Nigel continued through with quite some difficult. Alex pressed his tongue against the bruised place and hungrily stroked it along his skin while grabbing the edges of Nigel's pants. A strange sparkle appeared in Nigel's crazy eyes, and his stomach cringed once more as he threw his head to the ground. A loud groan escaped his throat. ' Fuck ,' he cursed for the first time. Alex his eyes shot up by satisfaction, and he noticed how something against his chest started to grow. Nigel placed his hand onto Alex's shoulder, having the desire to push him away by embarrassment, yet instead he only pulled him closer and forced his lips onto his himself now. Alex groaned, pushing Nigel forcefully back to the ground what caused Nigel's head to collide with the ground. Nigel groaned once more by pain, but gasped after as soon as Alex moved himself to his earlobe and started to bite and suck it hungrily. Both their ears were red and glowing by excitement. 'I want you to be bruised to the bone,' Alex panted in his ear. 'Make me,' Nigel demanded as he closed his eyes and pressed their bodies together. Alex started the grinding now. Hurting Nigel by still wearing his belt he bumped their lower bodies against each other, and despite this was what Nigel craved for, he couldn't bare it for more then fifteen seconds. Forcing his hands between their bodies he started to open Alex his belt, and as soon as Alex realized what Nigel was trying to do, he decided to help him with that as fast as he could. Pushing both of their pants down – if just a bit – he climbed back onto Nigel again, and pushed their lower bodies against each other once more. Now the rough cloth had vanish, they could feel each other much better what made them both widen their eyes as if they had a brief glitch. Nigel curled up his legs, leading Alex by that to the right spot, and he moved up his hand to his chest to scratch it. Alex began to move again. While grinding their lower parts against each other, he tore his gaze away to stare at the ground - since he couldn't really concentrate himself anymore – and while heavily panting he tried to keep himself from groaning too hard. Nigel kept his eyes closed. While pressing his head tightly against the floor he rubbed his fingers along Alex's his chest, and despite he should keep his vocals down a bit, he barely realized it himself. Alex suddenly stopped though. Not only with the groaning, but also with the grinding. Being not satisfied with the result himself he stared down at Nigel's body and looked at the bitemark on his abdomen. 'What's wrong,' Nigel panted as he stroked his hair out of his own face. Alex suddenly grabbed his throat, moving his lips closer to Nigel's again, and kissed his jawline as he pushed down Nigel's boxer with his free hand. Nigel widened his eyes, trying to search for Alex's his eyes now, but couldn't. Without giving Nigel a single warning, Alex suddenly started to palm him. Being totally inexperienced with this, Nigel cringed again, and he tried to pant. This went hard through. Alex was still squeezing his airways what made Nigel not to know whether to like or dislike this. In fact it was hard for Nigel to focus himself on it at all. The way Alex palmed his erection made him unable to think about anything, and for the first he forgot about what he wanted Alex to be. 'Alex,' he groaned as he squeezed his shoulder. Alex let go of his throat now, allowing Nigel to gasp for breath, but didn't stop palming him. 'Alex please,' he moaned then what caused Alex to smirk for once. 'What?' Alex asked airy as if he hadn't hear Nigel at the first time. 'Please,' Nigel repeated, however now being able to steady his breath a bit more. ' Jack .' Alex pursed his lips then, bending over him once more, and he took both of their erections in his hand to press them together. Despite it was hard to focus himself on anything, he kept his eyes fixated on Nigel's, and he slowly started grinding them together again. Since it was bare contact this time, Nigel cursed once more and forced himself to Alex his neck so he could burry his teeth in his skin. Alex smirked, kicking up the speed after some seconds until Nigel in the end showed a struggle. Muttering some thing such as \"no\", he buried his teeth into Alex's shoulder, but Alex didn't stop. In fact he didn't even had the time for doing so, because after less then two seconds Nigel climaxed after what Alex followed just a tad later. Both their bodies cringed and hitched as if their muscles where having a glitch. Stocking breaths escaped their throats, and they clamped against each other as if otherwise they would die. They didn't say anything. Covered in their blood and cum they remained lying like that for at least two minutes, until Nigel finally dared to relax his muscles again, and Alex could back off to put his boxers back on. He had the luck that he'd been on top, causing Nigel to be in a more catastrophic status. Talking about Nigel, he still laid motionlessly on the ground. His breath was still audible, and he stared at the ceiling as if he'd just deal with so many emotions he couldn't take it anymore. Alex chuckled mockingly, putting back on his shirt now, and he shook his head. 'This is your fault,' he said through his breathing. Nigel didn't respond. Despite his back hurt from the hard ground he remained lying on the floor, not even taking the possibility to put his boxers back on. In contrary with Nigel, it seemed, Alex desperately wanted to clean himself right now. His shirt was covered in Nigel's blood, an so were his hands – not even to speak about his belly being sticky by the mixture of their cum. 'I'll see you around,' Alex muttered then, walking back towards the stairs slowly. 'Get up. You look ridiculous like that.' With his cheeks still flushed red, he exited the basement to go to his own room for a hot shower. Nigel, on the other hand, finally got up after at least two more minutes, and then decided to go dress himself. After that, just as Alex, he got his bag and rushed himself to the exit of the basement. Not only because he desired for a shower too, but because he had to prepare himself for another nightvisit again… ","Summary":" It was a rainy day like all the others from the weeks before.

You ducked as a fist came flying at your head, a smile growing on your face as you knew exactly what your opponent's next move would be. Your arm darted out, ready to slam into his stomach, but before you could make contact, your legs were swept out from beneath you, and you slammed to the ground. Your head throbbed where it had made contact with the floor and as you tried to push yourself up, your arm screamed in pain and you crashed back to the ground with a yelp. Taking a deep breath, you blinked away the sparks of light dancing across your vision, letting out an exaggerated groan as a foot lightly kicked your side. \"You better not be dead, the Supreme Intelligence would kill me for murdering her second best warrior.\" \"Second best?\" You snickered, pushing aside the pain as you shoved yourself to your feet. Yon-Rogg smirked at you, immediately getting back into fighting stance, motioning for you to do the same. Flashes of light were still sparkling across your vision and your body felt as if you had fallen 10 stories, but out of habit, your leg slid back as you lifted your fists. \"Y/N!\" Relief slammed into you as you turned. A Kree guard stood at the door of the gym motioning for you to follow. \"This isn't over.\" Yon-Rogg pointed at you, a playful smirk growing on his face. You stuck your tongue out at him and flipped him off, before quickly following the guard out into the hall. You and Yon-Rogg had been friends since your first day on Hala. The second you landed on planet, you were placed in training, your supervisor being THE Yon-Rogg himself. All the other trainee's around you kept talking about how he was the Supreme Intelligence's favorite and how he was a hard-ass to all the new recruits. But that didn't scare you. If anything it made you want to befriend him more. Within five seconds of meeting him, you realized he was one of the most serious people on this planet. And you made it your personal goal to get him to laugh by the end of the day. It only took you ten minutes. His laughter echoed across the training room, all the trainees freezing and watching in confusion as he struggled to catch his breath. You stood back, your arms crossed, a wide smirk on your face. However, the laughter only lasted for a few seconds before he stopped abruptly, pulled himself together, and yelled at everyone to get back to work. But from that moment you became quick friends. He volunteered to personally train you. And soon you were quickly rising in the ranks. You balanced each other out. You were outgoing where he was quieter. And he was more serious where you were more emotional. But you respected each other's strengths and weaknesses. He taught you how to focus and train while you taught him how to let loose and dream. But your friendship didn't stop you from being competitive. You both fought for the best positions and the best missions. But as you continued to be promoted, you were rarely put up for the same ones. You became more of a spy while Yon-Rogg was the definition of a Kree soldier. Yon-Rogg realized quickly that you struggled to blindly follow orders. You liked knowing all the facts. But that wasn't how missions typically worked. You would be given an order and were expected to follow it without question. But what if that order had consequences? You didn't like hurting people. You were a spy. You lied, you manipulated, but you rarely killed. You didn't see the same death and destruction like the other agents, like Yon-Rogg. He would often lightly scold you for following your heart too often. And you would reply by calling him robotic. Neither of you meant anything by it. But sometimes you could see the sincere worry in Yon-Rogg's eyes and he would warn you that your bleeding heart was going to get you in trouble. But you knew that he would always have your back should you need something. He would always keep you safe. And you would always keep him safe. A few days later, you were in the middle of gathering intel on a planet bordering Hala when you received a message ordering you to take out your informant. Your steps faltered as you read the message over and over again. And against orders, you quickly sent a message back asking why . The only answer you received was: \"double agent\". Your heart dropped. You knew for certain that your informant was innocent. You had been working with her for years and she had never led you astray. You knew the only reason she helped you was to make money to support her children. She had no side in your war. You weren't sure how long you stood motionless in the middle of the street. It wasn't until you heard the beeping of a cruiser behind you that you quickly stepped onto the sidewalk, the insistent beeping coming from your comm echoing in your hand. The message read, \"Execute target. Confirm?\" You swallowed hard before confirming. Your heart was racing as you tried to come up with a plan. The last time you had been ordered to kill someone had been two years ago. You had lied and helped that man into hiding. And you had never been found out. Never told anyone. Not even Yon-Rogg. Part of you wanted to believe that if you had, he would have covered for you, but you weren't sure. Even though he was your closest friend, this war had been his life for decades. You didn't know what you would do the day he chose it over you. But nothing was going to stop you from saving this woman. With no time to form a plan, you would have to wing it. When you made contact with your informant, you made plans to meet up behind your usual bar. After making sure you weren't followed, you slipped down the alley, your hand on your blaster. As you caught sight of the hooded woman leaning against the wall, you relaxed. You whispered the code word, but before hearing it back, you began to beg her to leave and never return, realizing far too late that the woman in front of you wasn't your informant. Turning around to run, you ran headfirst into a Kree agent. Knocking him on the ground, you turned the corner seeing your informant across the street. Just as you were about to scream to her, something hit you hard over the head and you blacked out. When you woke, smoke was billowing from a fire in front of you. The sparks burning against your face as you laid against the sandy ground. You weren't in the alley anymore. The desert sand blew around you, no civilization to be seen for miles. You began to struggle to get up when somebody kicked you hard in the stomach, pain splintering through you. All you could do was pray they hadn't broken a rib. Another foot came down, slamming your head into the ground, a rock tearing into your forehead. Brushing the stream of blood across your face, you blinked ferociously trying to focus your eyes. The smoke burned as you peered around finally catching sight of your informant across the fire. The woman was terrified. She was kneeling on the ground, her body trembling. Her mouth moving nonstop, begging, pleading to the Kree agent's standing next to her. But they remained motionless, their blasters aimed at the back of her head. You had walked into a trap. This mission had been a test. And you had failed. Someone spoke, their voice muffled. You strained to hear what they were saying, but all you could hear was the pounding in your head. Before you could prepare to defend yourself, the Kree agent's surrounded you. They grabbed your arms and hauled you up, forcing you to your knees. You began to fight back even as your body screamed in pain. You managed to get one of the agent's on the ground, but you just weren't fast enough. Your legs were kicked out beneath you and you were pinned to the ground, forced to watch in horror as one the agent's aimed his blaster at your informant's head. You screamed. And he pulled the trigger. Defeated, your body fell limp. It was over. You were as good as dead. But as if it wasn't enough to watch the woman you had tried to protect die, one of the agent's threaded his hands through your hair and hauled you up, forcing you to look at the woman lying on the ground. Another agent came around and began speaking to you and when you didn't look up he grabbed your chin forcing your eyes to meet his. As he began to repeat what he said, you spit in his face, barely flinching when he punched you across the face. And this time as you laid silently on the ground, they left you there as tears burned in your throat. You weren't sure how long you remained there, the fire still burning hot across your face. You welcomed the pain and prayed for the darkness to come. After a while, you felt your limp body being dragged against the ground, the rocks buried in the sand, beating into you, birthing more bruises. You knew you had made it back to the ship, when the ground became smooth and solid beneath you, a welcome relief to your body. The two Kree agent's stopped abruptly, your limp body jerking in their hold, a groan escaping from your throat. Loud footsteps echoed across the empty walls in the hall. Two boots stopped in front of you. And you swallowed hard before looking up and meeting Yon-Rogg's eyes. They were dark and hard. And in that moment, you couldn't find one inch of the man you knew. You flinched as his arm moved forward, expecting his fist to slam into your face. When it didn't, you hesitantly met his eyes once more seeing the horror on his face as he looked from his hand to your beaten body. He waved his arm, motioning for the guards to release you, but when they didn't, Yon-Rogg swallowed hard before nodding minutely and leading the way into the Supreme Intelligence's quarters. And the only thing on your mind in that moment was Yon-Rogg's voice telling you to be careful following your heart. As the tendrils of the Supreme Intelligence burned into your skin, you tried to fight it. All you could hear was a voice repeating: \"you have failed your test\". It only took a few moments before your mind gave out and you collapsed. You woke abruptly, the pain in your body causing a whimper to be torn unconsciously from your throat. Prying open your eyes, you saw the bare walls of the dungeon cells. You didn't know that so many things could hurt at once. A coolness spread across your brow and you squinted your eyes as they strained against the bright light in the room. Someone shushed you as you tried to speak and that was when everything came racing back to you. Your heart started pounding and you pushed the unknown hands away before shooting across the room, your body giving out halfway. You dropped, your bound hands unable to stop you from slamming into the ground. \"Y/N.\" You shook your head, trying to get your eyes to focus as you watched the figure crouch down before you. Yon-Rogg. His mouth moved and it took you a few minutes to realize he was talking to you. \"-so stupid. Why would you do that? Saving a double agent. I know you don't like bloodshed, but this is war. She could-\" \"She was innocent.\" You whispered. And he froze, his bright eyes boring into you, \"You don't know that.\" \"I do.\" You swallowed, \"Because she wasn't a double agent. They set me up. The Supreme Intelligence. They knew I saved the last person I was supposed to kill. I helped him. And before you tell me how stupid I was, I'm not sorry. We're on the wrong side of the war, Yon. I couldn't sit around and do nothing anymore.\" His eyes flashed and he ran his hands through his hair, \"Wrong side of the war? The Skrulls are attacking us. Killing us. How are we on the wrong side? This is everything we've been fighting for, how could you betray us?\" \"I betrayed no one but the Supreme Intelligence, who wants to wipe out a whole race for no reason. Tell me there's nothing wrong with that?\" Your voice rose louder, \"Don't you ever wonder why they don't come after us? Why they always just defend themselves? We've never even been given a reason why!\" \"I...\" He swallowed, \"That's not for us to question.\" Your heart sunk, \"So, we're just soldiers that blindly follow orders. Where does it end?\" A loud bang sounded outside and you pressed harder against the wall, Yon-Rogg's mouth tightening as he watched you cowering, never having seen you in such a vulnerable state. \"I'm getting you out of here.\" \"What?\" Your voice cracked. He shook his head and peered over his shoulder as if he was expecting a fight to come through the door, \"I'm not leaving you here. They'll kill you.\" You shrugged, defeated, \"Yeah, I expected nothing less.\" \" And you're fine with that ?\" His voice wavered. \"What do you expect me to do? Fight with broken ribs, sprained ankle, hands tied together? I'm not some wonder woman.\" Voices echoed outside and as if a switch had been flipped, Yon-Rogg shot forward, the sudden movement startling you. He whipped out a knife and cut through your cuffs quickly. He hauled you up, your arm resting around his shoulders, his other grasping your side, the pain of breathing already getting to you. \"You're signing your own death certificate.\" You panted, more worried about him than yourself. You had accepted your fate the second you had saved that man two years ago. You knew you would be sentenced to death. But Yon...he hadn't done anything. \"So be it.\" He growled, his arm wrapping tighter around you, as he all but carried you through the door and started down the hall. \"Be careful with following your heart, it'll get you in trouble.\" You quoted at him, and you felt his steps falter as a small smile pulled at the corner of his mouth. Your chest warmed a little, knowing he had your back. And as you returned his smile, he paused for a moment, looking down at you. You leaned into his body a little more, his head leaning down toward you, resting his forehead against your temple. A moment later, he cleared his throat and you took a deep breath before you both started down the hall again. You didn't make five more feet before guards surrounded the two of you. Their blaster's aimed to kill. \"The Supreme Intelligence wants to speak to you both.\" You weren't lucky enough to fall unconscious this time. The guard's let Yon-Rogg help you down the hall and into the room. You could feel him breathing hard beside you, his eyes darting left and right, trying to find any available escape route to get you out of there. But as you grew closer and closer to the Supreme Intelligence you knew your fate was sealed. The second you entered the room the two of you were torn apart. It took four guards to hold Yon-Rogg down and you began to fight thinking they were going to attack him for helping you. But it wasn't him they wanted. It was you. One of your closest friends, one of the women you had trained with for years, went on missions with, someone you trusted with your life, stepped up to you, her weapon extended. She threw a fleeting look at Yon-Rogg, who was fighting to break away from the guards, terror filling his eyes as Lora raised her weapon striking you across the face. You weren't sure how you remained conscious but as she continued to beat you, Yon-Rogg screamed and screamed and fought with all his strength. But no matter what he did, he couldn't help you. \"I'll kill you!\" He screamed. Finally. Finally . Lora stopped hitting you. Your breath was coming in short and everything was becoming numb. Your last thought was at least they weren't hurting him. But it wasn't until you finally passed out that they came for him. The threads burned into your skin as your consciousness fell to the Supreme Intelligence. \"Why?\" Your voice croaked hoarsely, your gaze focused solely on the ground, knowing exactly who you would see if you looked up. \"Because you disobeyed.\" \"No, why did you make him watch?\" \"Because he loves you.\" Your body jerked, your head shooting up seeing Yon-Rogg staring down at you. His face blank. It wasn't him. The Supreme Intelligence's head cocked, \"I have known for years. Since you joined us. He tried to fight it. I never thought it would be a problem. I'm not certain when his mission stopped being ours and starting being protecting you, but it has caused me enough issues.\" \"You're lying.\" Your heart was pounding. \"It is you who he sees when he speaks to me. Make of that what you will.\" \"So, you're going to kill us both?\" The Supreme Intelligence paused, \"No. I am going to tell him you're dead. Break him down. And then build him back up into the perfect soldier. Emotion's destroy. He will be better without you.\" You swallowed heavily, \"And what happens to me?\" \"You are no threat. However, I can't have you around in fear that you will corrupt my soldier again. But you may be of use to me someday.\" The figure before her smiled. But it wasn't Yon's smile. And then everything went black. Author's notes: Seriously didn't mean to make this so fucking dark but it happened and now I want to make it happy so possibly a sequel one day[Chapter 2] Author's notes: So I just want to start off saying thank you for all the love everyone has been sending I'm really glad you guys are enjoying this! I hope you enjoy this next part! The alarm echoed loudly through the room, the abrupt sound ripping you from your dream. You groaned, rolling over, and burying your face into your pillow. It was still dark outside, why was your alarm blaring already? It was rare for you to ever be up before mid-day. If for some reason you had to be up early, someone usually had to physically drag you out of bed, that person usually ended up on the other end of your fist. \"What time is it? Stupid ass alarm.\" You mumbled to yourself, as you stretched out over the edge of the bed, trying to grab your rudely beeping comm off the nightstand. \"It's five in the morning.\" A deep voice rumbled from behind you. You yelped, shoving away from the unknown body, inadvertently falling off the bed in the process. Struggling to free yourself from the tangle of blankets, you squinted through the dark room trying to piece together who was sleeping in your bed. As you rubbed your throbbing elbow, a head popped over the side of the bed, looking down at you. \"What are you doing in my bed?\" Yon-Rogg's brows shot up, \"You're in my bed, actually.\" \"I….\" You looked around. This wasn't your room. That wasn't your alarm. And that most definitely wasn't your bed. You stood slowly, wrapping the blankets you had torn off the bed around your cold body. Swiping his comm off the nightstand, you chucked it at him. He flicked it off, the offending noise finally stopping, silence reigning through the room. You stood motionless for a second, you and Yon-Rogg just staring at each other. The man himself looked exhausted, his usually bright eyes dull with sleep, his hair disheveled, his chest bare. You glanced down at your own wardrobe, socked feet and a long man's t-shirt. Shrugging you walked back towards the bed. Hip-checking Yon-Rogg, you shoved him until he scooted back to the other side of the bed and slid down back beside him. Yon-Rogg cleared his throat and you flipped around looking at him with a questioning glance. \"You're staying? Don't you want to know how you even got here?\" You nodded, and without thinking about it too much, you burrowed into his side, his arm wrapping around you automatically. There was a time, years ago, when you used to shy away from touches. But something had changed with Yon-Rogg. One day, it had started with a touch on your back. An arm around your shoulder. And then a hug. A gentle hand brushing your hair back. And it was in this moment, lying next to him, that you realized the safest place in the world was in his arms. You had known him for so many years at this point, you had forgotten what it was like to live without him and truthfully you weren't sure you would be able to. \"Tell me in the morning.\" You murmured as you tangled your cold legs around his, your body all but wrapped around him. You felt his chest rumble as he laughed, \"It is morning.\" \"Shhhh,\" You grumbled. Yon-Rogg quieted down and you quickly fell asleep against him, missing the soft kiss he pressed to the top of your head. Three years later, 14 months after your exile: The whip came down hard, slicing into your back. Biting down hard on your lip, you tried not to cry out, but as the whip hit you again and again, a scream ripped from your throat. The deep rumble of the man's voice behind you echoed through the room as he counted; the unknown language flying through your ears as if it were gibberish. You had tried counting as each strike passed, but as the pain spread, you had lost count. Hearing silence above you, you assumed it was finally over, but when you heard the unmistakable sound of his clothes rustle, you braced yourself as the whip hit you one last time. You were on your knees, bent over on the filthy ground, bits of metal biting into your knees through the thin fabric of your clothes. Your head was hanging low, hair hiding your face. Somehow this wasn't the worst pain you had been subjected to. But at that moment you felt like a part of you died. When two boots stopped in front of you, your mind flashed back to the last time you were in this position, when you had looked up and met Yon-Rogg's eyes. But when you looked up this time, the man before you was a stranger. He motioned for you to stand. Gritting your teeth, you braced your bound hands on the ground and forced yourself to your feet, another soft whine escaping your mouth unconsciously. You swayed on your feet, feeling the blood dripping down your back. But you looked straight forward, your face blank; you knew what to expect next. You had been through this before. The woman who had been standing silently in the corner stepped out in front of you. Her high heels and pristine white dress stood out in comparison to the old blacksmith's lair and the company she was keeping. She took a step forward, her heels clicking like daggers against the dirt floor. Reaching out grabbing your chin, her sharp nails cut into your face as she forced you to meet her eyes. You had never understood what people meant when they said someone had dead eyes. But this woman - sometimes you believed she wasn't human. No emotion. No love. Just blank. \"This is what happens when you disobey. Do you understand?\" You stayed quiet, knowing if you opened your mouth you would attack her. But when her eyes narrowed and her grip on you tightened, you growled, \"Yes, ma'am.\" \"Excellent.\" She released you with a jerk, your head snapping sharply to the side. She motioned toward the man behind you, \"Pay him and let's leave. You have work that needs to be done.\" Fury built in your stomach, as you reached into your pocket, pulling out the tiny amount of money you had left. You turned to the man, who had just whipped you and held it out with shaking hands. The man looked between the two of you before quickly taking the money and racing out the door. Expecting you to follow, your master turned on her heel and took off down the cobblestone street. You shuffled along behind her, the people on the streets moving quickly out of your way. Your master was somewhat of a legend on this planet. However, she wasn't known for her kindness or generosity, rather the pain and destruction she brought to the citizens who didn't give her favor. To this day, you blamed the Supreme Intelligence for the situation you were in. When you had been cast out fourteen months ago, you had woken on an unknown planet, in the middle of a worldwide auction. Caged. Handcuffed. Donning what could best be described as rags. The auctioneer yelled, SOLD. And you lost your freedom. Your new \"master\", as they called it, paid for you, you were carted off stage. And all you had seen of your new master was a flash of white. After first few days under her \"employment\" passed, you expected to be out of her clutches within a week or so. But when you tried to leave, she claimed she had \"saved\" you and you would have to pay her back all the money she spent on you. And two years later you were still fighting to get away. When you weren't thieving and extorting people for her personal gain, she took in pleasure from using and abusing you. In breaking you . In stopping you from feeling. The first time she had ordered you to kill you had resisted. But when she had beat you to oblivion and threatened another one of her slaves, you gave in. But you never stopped fighting back. And it took everything within you not to lose your humanity. You were just worried for the day when she grew bored of you resisting and finally put you down. It was times like this that you wondered where Yon-Rogg was. If he was alright. If he was fighting back like you were. All you could hope was that he wasn't. You hoped the Supreme Intelligence had kept its promise, that he was still alive. But what you couldn't stop your mind from replaying was the Intelligence's voice telling you how they planned to break him. Yon-Rogg hit the heavy bag over and over again. He wasn't sure how long he had been going. Right. Left. Right. Duck. A hand grabbed onto his shoulder and he turned, immediately swinging at the offender. Lora ducked out of the way, grabbing his arm and twisting it behind his back. \"You're getting sloppy.\" Yon-Rogg pulled away with a grunt and turned back to the heavy bag, preparing to begin again when Lora grabbed his arm once more, \"You're bleeding.\" \"And?\" He said yanking his arm away, his bright eyes narrowing at her look of concern. It had been over a year since he had lost you. After you had collapsed, they had come after him. Beat him within an inch of his life. He had tried to fight back. But he just hadn't been strong enough. And just when he thought he was going to die. They stopped. When he woke up three days later, they told him you were dead. And he wished he was as well. \"You'll have to forgive me eventually.\" Yon-Rogg blinked, his face blank. \"You have already been forgiven. Y/N is dead to me. I am a Kree soldier. There's nothing more dangerous for a warrior than emotion.\" He droned on in monotone as if he had become so used to saying it, that it had just become second nature. Lora looked at him, not believing a word from his mouth, but nodding nevertheless. She would never forget the day he woke up after being beaten half to death, only to learn that you were dead. She had never seen someone so broken. Someone so full of anger. In his pain, he had struck out, attacking anyone that got in his way. He had raced through the halls, bowling over people, breaking objects left and right, until he finally reached where he needed to be. The last room he had seen you in. And when he found nothing but an immaculately clean room, he had fallen to his knees in disbelief. In the months following, he tried to play the perfect soldier. Tried to pretend that your death meant nothing to him. But he became resistant. Lashed out. Took risks. He couldn't get your words out of his head. That they were on the wrong side of the war. So he began to reach out, use his contacts, find out if what you said was true. He believed if he could find out the truth and do the right thing, then maybe, just maybe, you wouldn't have died for nothing. He would finish what you started. He hadn't thought anyone was paying attention until Lora warned him. \"They're watching you. Y/N is dead and is never coming back. You need to move on. Show the Supreme Intelligence you're a perfect soldier again.\" But he hadn't been convincing enough. A few months after the incident, he had been escorted to the Supreme Intelligence. He thought he would be prepared. But seeing the Intelligence wearing your face was jarring. But what was even worse were the words coming from your mouth. There is nothing more dangerous for a warrior than emotion. Human connection is a distraction. Anger only serves the enemy. The enemy is the Skrulls. Y/N was your enemy. Prove that you are worthy of your title. Lora cleared her throat and Yon-Rogg's bright eyes flashed, the chip on his neck shocking him slightly. His eye's dulled back down as they drifted over to the Kree guards, who were closely monitoring their altercation. Without another word, he pushed her back and turned away, raising his fists before he started hitting the bag again. The chip had been implemented during the second session with the Supreme Intelligence. It was put in place to ingrain those phrases into his head until they were all he knew. Until he became compliant, the perfect Kree soldier. And during the day he was. But not at night. His favorite part of the day was when he drifted off into unconsciousness, for his mind always went straight to you. They could make him forget you, make him hate you, but his dreams would be full of memories of love and friendship. And they couldn't take that away from him. It had been fourteen months since you had landed on this godforsaken planet. And you had finally found a way to get off it. Even under your new master's rule, you tried everything to get back to Hala. Not to join the Kree forces again. But to bring the fight to them. Whether that be as a soldier or as a spy. The one benefit of being exiled from Hala was that you could finally join the right side of the war. Finding Skrull supporters open to former Kree soldier's wasn't easy. Truthfully on this border planet, there weren't many people who even knew of the Kree and Skrull war. And those that did, didn't trust you. And you couldn't blame them. Over the months, you had managed to gather bits of information by trading information for services. You didn't have anything to bargain with except your mind and your skills. The Skrull supporters didn't mind, because most everyone was poor on this planet and skill set was looked upon favorably. After a while, you eventually joined a resistance force of Skrull supporters, fighting alongside men and women, who had become quick friends. \"Y/N!\" You had been leaning against the wall in the back alley for the past two hours. You knew when you made it back to your master's house you were in for another beating, but your contact had said that this information as too important to pass up. As your contact, Micu jogged into view you sighed in relief. She had become your partner in crime and the only one who truly knew everything about you. \"Please, tell me you've found a way off this shit hole.\" The woman before you smiled wide before nodding. Loud bangs echoed from above and the buildings around you began to shake. You ducked down as pieces of bricks began to rain down on your, \"What the hell?\" Micu crouched down next to you, peering out and pointing toward something in the sky, \"That's what I was trying to beat. That's our ride. The Kree. They're here.\" Your breath caught in your throat as you watched the ships begin to descend, bombs being shot down onto the city below. \"No.\" Micu's brows furrowed, \"What's wrong?\" \"That's not just the Kree. That's Ronan's ship.\" Debris fell around you as you dodged left and right, running in and out of innocent civilians trying to get out of range of the ships landing. A blaster shot flew past you and you dodged right, slamming hard into a crumbling building, your shoulder screaming at the pain. A fist flew toward your face and you ducked, swiping out your leg, taking down the Kree agent. She slammed to the ground with a thud and as you tried to step over her, she grabbed onto your leg. You tripped, twisting around as she climbed onto you, slamming her fist into your face. Bucking your hips you threw her off, picking up a stray brick, you hit her hard over the head. She went down with a thud. You took a deep breath as chaos rained down around you. The buildings were on the brink of collapse, the citizen's screaming as the Kree warrior's attacked. You reached down, stealing her blaster before racing down the street. \"Stop!\" You screamed, your voice carrying over the screaming and chaos from the explosions around you. The Kree soldier's back was to you. His whole body tensed as he froze. Your brows furrowed in confusion as the man didn't lift his blaster and shoot you into oblivion, let alone move an inch. Your hand was steady as you held your own blaster at his back, ready for any sudden movement. \"Turn around slowly. Hands up. Put your blaster down.\" You began to creep cautiously around the debris on the ground, circling wide around the Kree soldier, trying hard to keep your attention solely on him, instead of all the innocent's running by trying to flee from the fighting. The soldier hadn't moved but you knew that he was trained to kill. He wouldn't hesitate to put you down. And you wouldn't hesitate to repay the favor. But you needed him alive. As you moved around toward the front of him, your heart was pounding. This could be somebody you knew. And when you caught sight of his face, your heart skipped a beat. It couldn't be. \"Yon?\" Your voice cracked. It was if your voice had brought him to life, because he shot forward, pushing you back against a wall. His hand wrapped around your throat, his blaster resting against your temple. His eyes were blank. You had never seen him like this. And truthfully you weren't sure you even knew him anymore. You had no idea what he had been through this past year. Neither of you were the same people you had once been. \"Yon, it's Y/N.\" You pleaded. \"Y/N is dead. She was a traitor. You are a Skrull. My enemy.\" His flat voice struck hard as if he had stabbed you straight through the stomach. \"You may have trouble killing me, I was once known as the second best Kree warrior.\" You managed to gasp out. And it was if a switch had been flipped. \"Shut up!\" He screamed, his gaze focused at your chin as if he was unable to meet your eyes, but eyes had a rage in them that you were unfamiliar with, \"How dare you use this face. How dare you .\" You could feel him shaking against you, and you reached up grabbing onto his arm wishing he wasn't wearing that god-horrid Kree suit, \"Yon. It's me.\" For a second, the man before you faltered but then he just shook his head, \"No. Y/N is dead. And you're going to be next.\" Yon-Rogg took a step back, his blaster raising, aiming straight at your head. You watched as his hand shook, his finger hesitating around the trigger. You lifted your hands in surrender. \"Show me your true face.\" He spat out. But you just shrugged, \"I can't.\" \"Do it!\" He screamed, taking a step forward, the blaster inching closer to your face. You cleared your throat, \"Remember that day I woke up in your bed for the first time?\" \"Stop.\" \"I freaked out so badly, I fell off the bed. Still remember those bruises, by the way. But I climbed back into bed with you and something changed that day. But neither of us acted on it because we wanted to be the \"perfect soldiers\", everything was so much easier back then.\" You let out a tiny laugh, nervously running a hand through your hair. \"You just took her memories. Stop it.\" \"Do you remember when we first met-\" He cocked his blaster and you swallowed hard. \"-it had to be…. god, about six years ago now. I was freshly recruited off my home planet. And I walked into the gym only to see dozens of men and women fawning over you.\" \"Enough.\" His voice shook. \"About ten minutes into the work-out, I walked right up to you and told you the first joke that popped into my head, which looking back at it now was completely horrible but-\" His arm dropped, his blaster falling to the dusty ground. The sudden movement startled you and you flinched back. But when your body wasn't met with a blaster shot, you raised your gaze, finally meeting his eyes. You had only seen Yon-Rogg cry once in your life. But as a tear rolled down his cheek, you shot forward and wrapped yourself around him, his arms hesitating only a second before they wrapped around your back, fingers digging into your scars that still hurt from the whipping just a few weeks ago, the pain reminding you of all you had been through. You pulled back slightly and Yon-Rogg reached out brushing a piece of your hair behind your ear, his thumb lingering against your cheek. And as you closed your eyes, leaning into his touch, something hard hit you over your head and you collapsed.[Chapter 3] Author's notes: You guys have been drowning me in love and I sincerely love every single one of you. I really hope you guys enjoy this! This was the last chapter I had planned out so I'm gonna do my best to get the next part out next weekend but I gotta do some soul-searching to figure out where I'm taking this story haha hope you enjoy! You ducked as a blaster shot over your head, pieces of the building above you raining down on your head. \"Watch your head, Y/N!\" You threw a quick glare at Yon-Rogg and he replied with his usual smirk. But then his eyes grew wide and he motioned behind you. As you turned you came face to face with a blaster. You woke startled, reaching for your blaster before realizing that you weren't out in the field. You were in your room back on base. Yon-Rogg had been gone for almost a month on a mission. One you hadn't been allowed on. You weren't sure for what reasons and when you had tried to argue, Yon-Rogg had shot you down immediately. You were grounded. And you were going crazy without anything to do. As you waited for word back from his mission, you took the time to wander around the planet and explore. As you walked around the waterbed, skipping over the rocks to get to the other side of the river, you paused as you grabbed something out of the water, dropping it in your bag with a smile. When Yon-Rogg finally returned from his mission, you were waiting outside the door of the conference room. The second you saw him, you bounced up next to him, \"Did you bring me back anything from the mission?\" He snorted, \"What are you, a child?' \"I fucking hope not. Not with the way you two flirt.\" Came a voice from behind you. \"Lora!\" \"What!\" You rolled your eyes as Yon-Rogg followed you back to your room. He leaned heavily against the wall as you placed your hand on the scanner. \"And why did we need to go to your room first?\" You motioned for him to go into your room first and his eyes narrowed as he peeked in, as if expecting something to jump out at him. You pushed at his back and followed him in. \"Since you didn't get me anything, which I'm still crying about thank you very much. I have a present for you!\" You grabbed something from your desk and chucked it at him. Snatching it out of the air, he looked down at it, \"It's a rock.\" \"A very cool rock.\" \"There are a million just like it out in the river.\" \"Not one shaped like a dragon though.\" Yon-Rogg was silent as he looked down at the rock. You cleared your throat, holding out your hand with a smile, \"If you don't want it, I'll take it back.\" Shaking his head, he closed his hand around the rock and he slid it into his pocket. Four years later, one day after being reunited with Yon-Rogg: You struggled to pull yourself from unconsciousness. You weren't sure how long you had been out, but your head was pounding. You knew you should be worried about having a concussion but all your mind was focused on was Yon-Rogg. The last thing you remembered was staring into his eyes before everything went dark. But this time when you opened your eyes, you were met with just darkness. Swallowing hard, you pushed yourself to your feet and began to feel around the room blindly. The room was small. The walls rocky. A chill burrowed deep inside your skin and it took everything in you to stop your teeth from chattering. As you reached the furthest part of the room, something pulled you back with a jolt. Shaking your leg, you heard jangling and reached down feeling the chain attached to your ankle. Yanking hard on it, it didn't give way in the slightest and fear began to well up in your chest. A loud familiar sound echoed through the room, and by the time you realized what it was, it was too late to close your eyes as bright light flooded the room. A whimper came from your throat as you shut your eyes, but the light still burned against your eyelids. The sound of heels clicking on the ground echoed across the stone floor and you knew you were as good as dead. \"Ah, my rebellious slave still causing me problems. I knew I should've killed you months ago.\" \"So, why haven't you.\" You croaked, your throat still dry from the dust and debris that had been falling from the destroyed buildings outside. You peered out into the bright room meeting your master's eyes. Her own narrowing as you didn't look away in submission. The woman before you tsked as she strolled around the room. Her heels still clicking. You hated that sound. You hated this place. You had only been in here once. It was her jail room. The one she used when she wanted to punish her slaves for misbehaving. The first time she had put you in here you almost went insane. Six days alone in the dark. No sound. No food. No water. Nothing. But after you came out, she had claimed that she needed you sane and workable and instead turned to whipping you when you disobeyed. \"Because I'm curious.\" Your brows furrowed. \"About the man.\" Your heart was pounding as you tried to casually peer around the room. \"Ah, so you do know him. He's not here.\" \"Where is he?\" \"Who is he?\" She questioned curiously. \"No one.\" You lied. The woman tsked again and reached out threading her fingers through your hair, roughly pulling your head back. \"No lies. You're friends with a Kree warrior. And I want to know why.\" You spit in her face, but she didn't even flinch. She pulled back slowly and wiped off her face with a handkerchief. Not pulling her gaze from you, she raised her hand and the door opened, two of her other slaves walking through the door carrying an unconscious Yon-Rogg. \"What did you do to him?\" You spat out, your eyes hovering of his body, trying to see if there were any obvious wounds. \"Nothing he won't recover from.\" She said as she walked over to him slowly. She looked down at him as she ran her nails across his face in carnal fascination. \"Get away from him.\" She let out a noise of realization, \"You care for him.\" \"No.\" You swallowed hard. \"Take him away.\" The slaves froze as you shot forward, startled by your sudden movement. You had worked with them before and had always treated them kindly. But they knew if they didn't obey they would be beaten. One of the young girls met your eyes and you pleaded with her. \"Please.\" Your master's eyes flashed and a sinister smile crossed her face before she turned and swept out of the room, the other slaves dragging Yon-Rogg out with them behind her. You let out a scream as you pulled against your chain hard but you fell to the ground, the chains pulling you down. Your master came back every few hours. She questioned you. She beat you. But when you wouldn't give anything up, she would leave. But then she would return. She would threaten. She would hurt you again and again. But all you did was lie on the ground, silently taking it. It could've been hours or even days later when the door finally opened again. Expecting it to be your master again, you just laid there on the ground, defeated. But when you felt someone pulling at your chains you looked up. It was the younger slave girl from earlier. You had never learned each other's names and weren't even allowed to speak to each other. But you had always made sure she had food, water, and something warm to wear. She couldn't have been more than eleven. One of the youngest slaves under your master's rule. You had given away most of your belongings to the younger slaves, hoping that they would stay alive and strong enough to one day be free, even if you weren't. The young girl did some motions with her hands and your brows furrowed. But when she did them again the same exact way, you sat up. She was communicating. \"You're going to get me out of here?\" The girl's face lit up and she nodded motioning down to your chains. You pulled at them, the chains clattering loudly against the stone floor, \"I can't get out.\" She held up a finger and reached down into her pants pocket, pulling out a key. Your eyes widened as she held it out to you. \"Thank you.\" You said reaching out and taking the key, \"I'm gonna get you out of here.\" The girl smiled sadly and shook her head, beginning to walk backwards. \"No, wait where are you going!\" A loud explosion sounded outside the door and you threw yourself to the ground, covering your head as stones rained down around you. And when you looked back up, the girl was gone. But where she had once stood, was a hole blown through the wall of the cell. Using your shaking hands, you quickly unchained the locks and stumbled to your feet, your legs weak from lying on the ground for so long. You clambered through the rubble, the stones cutting into your hands as you tried to steady yourself. As you peeked out into the hall, all you found was chaos. This place had been your own personal hell for so long, that to see it up in flames, warmed your heart. As you ran down the hall, you stopped picking up what looked like a bar, which you could use as a makeshift weapon if you ran into any of your master's guards. You knew you should leave but you needed to find Yon-Rogg and you had unfinished business with your master. Room after room was empty and you continued running and running passing dead bodies, mutilated bodies, people crying, people fighting. The slaves were fighting back and it looked as if they were winning. All you wanted was to stop and help them but you needed to take care of your master first. With her dead, this whole thing would finally be over. When you finally reached her command room, you paused, clutching the bar tighter in your hand before pushing open the door. \"I've been waiting for you.\" Your master sat on, what could only be described as a throne. Her pristine white dress, smeared with dirt, her hair a mess. Her eyes had a deranged look about them. She was on the verge of losing and she knew it. You twisted the bar in your hands and took a step forward. You could see the fear in her eyes. She snapped her fingers and you looked over at a loud sound in the corner of the room. Yon-Rogg was kneeling there. Blood dripping down his face. A gag in his mouth. Two guards standing over him. \"If you think him being here is going to stop me from killing you, you're sorely mistaken.\" \"Let's make a deal.\" You shook your head as you grew closer to her, \"There's no deal I would ever make with you. You beat me. You branded me. You beat children. You killed children. And for what?\" \"For the greater good.\" She stood up, her eyes mad. \"If this is your greater good I want no part of it.\" \"I'm trying to save this planet. Clean it out. Get rid of all the weak, sniveling poor masses.\" \"If you had just helped them instead of hoarding your wealth!\" You yelled. She scoffed, \"They deserve nothing from me. They're weak.\" \"No, you deserve nothing.\" You growled. All those poor innocent people she had killed, just because she wanted to cleanse a whole planet. \"You're not going to kill me.\" She said, but you could hear the fear in her voice. \"You're wrong about that.\" The woman reached down grabbing one of her guard's swords and brought it up aiming at you. She swung it at you wildly, but you easily blocked it. You circled around her and she quickly moved trying to follow you, still waving the sword around violently. You stopped suddenly when her back was to her guards and Yon-Rogg. As you feigned a strike at her, you met Yon-Rogg's eyes, nodding slightly. His gaze dropped to your left hand and you held out two fingers. As your master slammed her sword down at you again, you let the bar slip through your fingers. She smiled and tried to cut you down, but you dropped to the ground, kicking the bar over to Yon-Rogg. Knowing he would take care of the two guards, you turned back to your master and grabbed onto her sword hand, both of you struggling to take control of it. A loud cracking sound sounded through the room and you looked up watching a wide crack form in the foundation of the ceiling. As pieces of stone began to fall, you grabbed your master's wrist, twisting it around, pulling the sword from her grasp and slamming it straight up through her stomach. You met her eyes and then the ceiling collapsed on both of you. You woke with a start. Your body screaming. You could feel where the stones had crushed into your body. When you opened your eyes all you saw was darkness. And all you could think was you were back in your master's cell. That somehow she had survived. And locked you up again. But you weren't. As your eyes adjusted you noticed you were in an old hotel room. Light was shining into the dark room from the window. The shadow of a figure illuminated by the sunlight. Easing yourself off the bed, slowly and silently, you snuck up behind them, and just when you went to take them down, they dropped to the ground sweeping your legs out from beneath you and pinning you to the ground. \"What did I tell you about sneaking up on people? You need to be silent.\" \"I was!\" You argued and you pushed against Yon-Rogg's chest. He stood, holding out his hand for you, but you ignored it pushing yourself to your feet. \"Where are we?\" You asked as he turned back, peering out the window. \"A hotel on the outskirts of the city. The Kree won't be here for another few hours. We have time to come up with a plan.\" You wander aimlessly around the room, refusing to look at Yon-Rogg, \"So, what happens now you kill me? Turn me over to the Supreme Intelligence?\" \"Of course not.\" He scoffed, turning around to face you. In the back of your mind, you knew that you shouldn't be arguing with him. But you didn't know what he had been through. If the Supreme Intelligence had gotten to him. You had seen in the chip on his neck. He had tried to kill you. You had to be sure. \"Why does that seem so out of the question? I mean you did drag me unconscious into a hotel in the middle of nowhere.\" \"Do you really think me so low?\" You finally looked up, \"I don't even know who you are anymore.\" His eyes flashed with hurt, \"I'm still the same person, Y/N.\" You laughed derisively, \"No, you're not. And I'm not the same person either. We haven't been around each other for over a year. Did you really not think my time here as a slave would impact me?\" \"I didn't know. \" He ground out. And you read the second meaning behind that sentence. That he didn't know you had been sent here. He didn't know that you had been going through hell. \"Maybe you didn't. But you also didn't fight back.\" \"I couldn't.\" \"You could! You gave up on me. Was everything a lie between us?\" He stepped right up to you, \"I never gave up on you. The reason I didn't fight back is because I've been working with the Skrulls behind the Supreme Intelligence's back. I have pretended to be her perfect soldier and have been feeding them information. And you know why?\" You took a step back, but he just stepped back into your space. \"It's because of you. It's always been you. I've loved you since the moment I laid my eyes on you.\" \"You're lying.\" Your voice wavered. He let out a disbelieving laugh, \"Why would I lie? I've been told my whole life that emotions destroy. Yet you've destroyed me. Even with all the pain and torture, the Supreme Intelligence put me through, all I could think about was you.\" You turned away from him. Your heart was pounding, you had been waiting for him to reciprocate your feelings for so long. But now that it had happened you didn't know what to do. \"Then prove to me your on my side. Help me save these Skrull supporters. Help me save my former master's slaves.\" Yon-Rogg passed you one of his blasters as you took off down the street, jumping over the rubble of the city that once stood there. Your finger immediately moved to the trigger, ready to take down anybody that got in your way. Shooting down soldier's left and right, you finally reached the Skrull supporter's den. Knocking on the door, you slipped inside, waving back at Yon-Rogg silently telling him to remain behind. But he didn't listen and as he followed you through the door, all the blasters went up. \"He's a friend. I promise. We need to get you off this planet.\" Micu, your contact, nodded, waving at the other's to drop their weapons. Everybody obeyed and immediately turned back to their debate, though they were still throwing wary glances at Yon-Rogg, who was standing silently in the corner. You stepped up, pulling the map toward you and set out the pathway for them to follow. They had a few ships left, but getting to them would be a problem. As you laid out your plan, Yon-Rogg watched in amazement as the Skrull supporters looked at you with respect. \"We're going to meet here. Gather all your people. I will meet you once I get all the slaves from my former master's house. They're innocents. Please take care of them.\" Micu nodded and held out her hand to you. You grasped it and pulled her into a hug. \"We'll meet again one day. Stay safe.\" The explosions were growing closer and you and Yon-Rogg once again took off into the streets. As you reached your former master's house, you went to shoot down a Kree warrior that had just stepped out the door, but Yon-Rogg beat you to it. Turning toward him, you were shocked when he just nodded and turned, aiming back down the street. Knowing he had your back, you slid into the demolished house and ran toward the slave rooms. The door was busted shut and you holstered your gun in the back of your pants before reaching down and grabbing a piece of wood to pry it open. As you groaned, under the pressure, the wood finally gave way and you were able to pull the door open. The young girl who had helped you escape was the first person you saw. You motioned for her to follow you but she was shaking hard. Reaching out, you grabbed her hand. \"She's dead.\" Her brows furrowed and you just nodded as realization dawned on her face. \"She can't hurt you anymore. We need to go.\" As Yon-Rogg put his ship on auto-pilot, you stared out the window, you couldn't be more happy to watch that hell hole burn. You and Yon-Rogg had saved as many slaves and innocents that you could. But there was only so much you could do against Ronan and the Kree forces. You heard him step up beside you as you watched the planet burn, \"So what do we do now?\" \"Well, first you need a shower.\" You threw him a mocking glare, \"Yeah, well if you had been a slave for over a year I'm pretty sure the last thing on your mind would've been getting clean.\" Yon-Rogg held up his hands in mock surrender, but you just rolled your eyes taking the towel from his hand and stalked off to the washer in his room to clean up. The feeling of hot water running over your skin was something you never thought you would feel again. And as you stood there in the shower you felt the tears welling up as all the pain and suffering you had endured this past year finally hit you. And as you cried for the first time in over a year, you let out all the pain you had kept inside. As you scoured Yon-Rogg's drawers for some clothes to steal, for the time being, your hand hit something hard buried deep in his drawers. As you lifted it out with shaking hands the door behind you opened. \"Y/N, I-\" You could tell the moment he saw your scars and wounds from being whipped over and over again. You bowed your head and you heard his almost silent steps behind you. You stiffened slightly as a warm hand began to trace over the scars on your back. The hand retreated and your heart stopped for a minute before you felt him wrap one of his shirts around you. \"I'm sorry.\" \"It's not your fault.\" His voice was deep, \"You can tell me that for the rest of our lives. But I'm always going to know I played a part in this. In hurting you.\" You whipped around, \"You didn't hurt me. Don't say that.\" But before he could respond, he caught sight of the rock you held in your hand. He swallowed hard before meeting your eyes. \"You kept it all of these years. You love me?\" He nodded slightly, \"I do.\" \"I'm not sure-\" Your voice caught in your throat. He took a step back, his eyes darkening. \"- when I fell in love with you. It definitely wasn't the first year we knew each other. You were an asshole. And it definitely wasn't when you almost pushed me down a flight of stairs to test my 'reaction time'. Maybe it was –\" But before you could finish your sentence he shot forward, his fingers threading through your hair as his mouth came down hard on yours. Without a moment's hesitation, you pressed back. His lips were soft but unyielding against yours. A soft sigh tore from your mouth as he deepened the kiss, his other arm coming up to wrap tightly around you. His hand that had weaved through your hair pulled you even closer to him. You knew you were moving too fast. But on the other hand, this had been a long time coming and you couldn't deny how safe you felt in his arms. You pulled your face away with a gasp and tilted your head back, your eyes snapping closed with a moan when you felt him pepper kisses along your jaw and down your neck. As your hands ran through his hair, his slipped under the back of the shirt he had just wrapped around you, his hand burning like fire against your skin. You wished you hadn't wasted so much time. You had known him for almost six years. Six years wasted. You would never be able to go back from this moment. You would never be able to forget how his lips felt on yours. How his hands burned into your skin as he touched you. You pulled away with a gasp and he reached up, his fingers dancing across your cheek before he brushed your hair back behind your ear. \"Together?\" \"Together.\"[Chapter 4] Author's notes: I wanted to have this up when I got home from work but as I was rereading it I realized I didn't edit it AT ALL. So please for the love of Thor ignore any spelling errors and I might change some things tomorrow. I also had some issues on this part because I didn't know where I was gonna take this story but I think I have the next two parts planned out now. I love you guys so much and I hope you enjoy! Your first mission. Technically, you shouldn't have been allowed to go. You hadn't completed the required yearlong training; you were barely even six months along. But because of your personal lessons with Yon-Rogg, you were waves above the other trainees. So, when word got around that the Supreme Intelligence was looking for an unfamiliar face for a new mission, Yon-Rogg put in a good word for you. To say that this put you out of favor with the other trainees would be an understatement. They respected you, yet hated you at the same time. You were living their lifelong dream. You had already been finding it difficult to befriend the others. After Yon-Rogg had singled you out the first day, the others had kept their distance from you. And when you did manage to get close, you heard talk of how you were Yon-Rogg's \"favorite\", how you got special treatment. So, when you were chosen as the agent for this mission, you worried that they would think that you had slept your way to the top. But even they knew you were miles ahead of them in terms of training. When you would spar, you were able to take down anyone within a few seconds. You could outshoot them, easily doubling their scores. It even went so far as your group trainer telling you to hold back when fighting the others. However, when Yon-Rogg had caught wind of that, he had reprimanded the trainer and pulled you aside, informing you that holding back is what gets people killed. And you never held back ever again. Which is how you found yourself here. Your first mission. It would be easy, they said. The Supreme Intelligence hadn't been too keen on sending somebody new, but after hearing how highly her star warrior was praising you, she agreed to give you a trial run. But something went wrong. The mission was easy on paper. Find the target and get the intel. Simple. Easy. Nothing too difficult. Until you landed on the planet. And everything around you exploded. You dodged fire left and right, quickly sending a distress message to Yon-Rogg. Not a second later, his hologram appearing on your arm, a smirk on his face. \"Miss me already?\" An explosion sounded nearby and you threw yourself down onto the ground as fire rained down around you. \"Y/N! Y/N, are you okay? Answer me!\" You quickly brought your arm up, Yon-Rogg's face full of worry as he caught sight of your soot-covered face. \"I got ambushed the second I landed. Yon please, I need help.\" \"Just wait for back-\", he replied, but before he could finish responding, the communication fizzled out as your comm exploded on your wrist. \"Fuck.\" You mumbled. You sat still for a second, before taking a deep breath. You had trained for this. Yon-Rogg had prepared you for this. And with a smile, you dove back into the thick of things. You had a target to find. When you woke up, you were in the med bay. The bright lights burned against your eyes and the steady beeping of your heart, hurt your pounding head. As you tried to lift your arm, you felt something holding it down. Looking down, you saw Yon-Rogg asleep in the chair next to you, his hand resting on your arm. He was slouched over the chair uncomfortably, still dressed in his Kree suit, covered in dust and blood. An open book in his lap. Trying not to jostle him, you tried to push yourself into a seated position, but when you put pressure on your arm, a sharp pain shot through you and you let out a gasp, waking Yon-Rogg from his sleep. Without hesitation, he helped readjust you so that your weight wasn't on your arm. And then he just looked at you. His face was blank and you knew before he even said one word that he was mad. \"Before you say it, I know it was stupid, but I made a choice and I stand by it.\" Yon-Rogg remained quiet, his face expressionless, but then his eyes narrowed, \"I told you to wait for backup.\" \"It was my mission.\" \"A mission you could've died on.\" You rolled over, ignoring the pain shooting through your body as you reached over to the side table. Digging through your bag on the table, you finally found what you were looking for, and pulled it out chucking it at Yon-Rogg. \"I got the intel. I completed the mission.\" \"Don't you realize how valuable you are?\" He said. Your brows furrowed, \"To the mission?\" \"To m-\" he stopped abruptly and stood up. Your heart was beating fast, the sound echoing loudly through the room as your face reddened. Yon-Rogg stood facing the wall, his back tense. Clearing your throat, he turned, peering at you over his shoulder. You held out a hand and waited silently until he walked over grabbing onto it, threading his fingers through yours. You nodded down the book that had fallen off his lap and onto the floor. \"Read to me? I am sick.\" You faked coughed, hiding a smirk behind your hand. He scoffed but you could see the relief in his eyes when reached down picking up the book As he began to read, you closed your eyes, letting yourself drown in the sound of his voice, your hand still tight in his, his thumb brushing over your knuckles gently. About six years later, two weeks after you and Yon-Rogg were reunited: \"Ouch!\" You rolled your eyes, pushing Yon-Rogg's head to the side once again, as you looked down at the chip embedded in his neck, \"Oh, shush.\" \"Well, it hurts.\" He growled. You had spent every single day these past two weeks trying to remove that goddamn chip from his neck. Initially, it had taken some prodding to figure out why he had even been chipped in the first place. After a few days, of questioning, or annoying as he called it, you had finally managed to bother him enough into blurting out that he hadn't been able to stop thinking about you. When you asked him to elaborate he explained how they would shock him into oblivion whenever his mind even drifted to a memory of you. But it wasn't the shocking that worried the two of you. If the Kree had implanted a tracker within it, they would be on your tail in no time. Which impacted your plans of assisting the Skrulls. You had tried everything to get it off. Sometimes you would hit it the wrong way it would shock him, sometimes even knocking him unconscious for a few hours. At first, you felt bad, but with him unconscious, and quiet, it was easier to work out how to get it off. But you hadn't had luck and you were running out of time. \"I'm sorry the big bad Kree warrior can't handle a little pain, but we can't do anything until we get it off. And we've already been off the grid for too long. Anyways, I think I've finally figured it out.\" \"You couldn't have started with that, instead of prodding at me like an animal?\" He muttered. You fake gasped, \"Is that? Is that a sense of humor I hear?\" \"No, you must be mistaken.\" He said dryly. You hummed knowingly as you discretely pulled something out of your pocket. Bracing your hand against his head, you cleared your throat, \"Now, don't worry if there's a little shock, it won't hurt. Well, maybe a little.\" \"Shock, what-\" But before he could finish his question, you shoved the taser into the chip in his neck. His body seized as he let out an involuntary squeak. Gritting your teeth, you held it for a second longer than necessary before finally releasing it. Peering down with squinted eyes, you looked to see if it had made a difference to the chip. But it was still embedded deep into his skin, still blinking faintly. \"Fuck.\" You mumbled, falling silent when Yon-Rogg shot you a dirty look. But you just smiled back shyly in apology. Yon-Rogg lifted a shaking hand to his neck, his fingers coming away wet with blood. You quickly slapped them away before beginning to disinfect the wound. You hummed quietly, as he sat there silently. Out of nowhere, he whispered, \"I almost shot you.\" You froze. Neither of you had so much as mentioned your fight. But you knew he had nightmares about it. A few days ago, he had woken in a terror, pressing down hard on your stomach yelling that he had to stop the blood. He kept apologizing over and over again. It had taken hours to get him to calm down. And the next morning, neither of you mentioned it. Pretending it had never happened. Instead, you just handed him his coffee as he cooked breakfast. \"But you didn't.\" You stated. \"But I could have. I would have.\" He whispered horrified. His eyes glazed over in a way that made your heart beat painfully. You grabbed his chin and forced him to meet your gaze, \"But you didn't.\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"I know.\" You said. He turned away, pulling his head from your hand, \"If we can't get this chip off, I need to get far away from you. They can't find you.\" \"I'm not letting you leave. You'll die.\" You argued back. \"And if I don't, you'll die. All I've ever wanted is to keep you safe.\" You brushed a hand across his face, tracing over his forehead cheekbones before leaning down gently pressing your lips to his, \"I know.\" Yon-Rogg stood in front of you, a smile on his face. You began to call out to him, but as his eyes turned to you, they were black. His arm raised and your heart jumped to your throat as you caught sight of the blaster in his hands. You could hear someone pleading to him, begging him not to shoot. It wasn't until he took a step forward that you realized that someone was you. His finger moved to the trigger and this time he didn't stop. He pulled the trigger and the blaster exploded. You shot up, your heart racing, your body sticky with sweat. You all but threw yourself out of bed, stumbling into the bathroom. Turning on the sink, you splashed yourself, the cold water striking your face as you welcomed the icy blast with a sigh. Your heart settled and you looked up meeting your eyes in the mirror. The bags under your eyes continued to grow day after day. You longed for the day when you could look at yourself and not feel like a stranger in your skin. Another nightmare. Though you and Yon-Rogg had been together for two weeks, you were still learning how to be normal again. You were both just surviving at the moment, but you were trying to figure out how to truly live again. As you made your way back to the bedroom, your brows furrowed at the empty bed, the covers thrown back on Yon-Rogg's side. Grabbing his robe off the end of the bed, you wrapped it around you before walking out into the hall, following the loud sounds down the hall, finding Yon-Rogg standing before a heavy bag, his back bare and covered in sweat. You weren't sure how long he had been here. \"Yon.\" His arms faltered for a second before punching the bag once more harder, the rafters shaking. You watched as his shoulder's dropped as he turned. \"Bed?\" Just one shake of his head was all the answer you needed. Nodding, you held out your hand, waiting until he took it before leading him back into your bedroom. Pushing him down gently on the couch, you grabbed the book off his nightstand before sitting down next to him. Turning to the page that was marked, you began reading. He was asleep within minutes. You didn't stop until your voice grew hoarse. You knew that the two of you wouldn't be able to run from your demons for much longer. But neither of you were ready to talk about it yet. And for the time being, that was enough. \"I need you to train me.\" You stood in Yon-Rogg's doorway, his back to you as he stood in front of his mirror drying his hair with a towel. Meeting your gaze in the mirror, he gestured to his sparsely dressed body. \"Do you mind?\" \"No.\" You smirked, crossing your arms as you looked him up and down. He rolled his eyes before turning to face you, staying silent, but his eyes said everything. You nodded, looking away refusing to meet his eyes, \"I wasn't able to keep up this past year what with…\" You waved your hand, swallowing hard at the memories. He nodded, \"Get dressed and let's go.\" Five minutes later, you hit the ground with a thud and groaned. Yon-Rogg kicked your side gently prompting you to get up. You felt like you were back at the academy. You didn't realize how far out of practice you were. Though you had been forced to do manual labor every day under your master's rule, your body had built up strength and muscles that you weren't used to. You were bulkier than you had been and slower in your reflexes. You were relearning how to use your body. As Yon-Rogg put you through the motions he had done so many years ago, he did so slowly. You expected your muscles to remember what they had so many years ago, but as you tripped, and fell, and missed, you grew frustrated. You slammed to the ground again and again. Your body was screaming and when Yon-Rogg asked if you wanted to stop, you ignored him, getting to your feet, wiping the blood from your nose, and raising your arms again. His jaw tightened every time you fell, but he continued to attack you knocking you down over and over. After completing the first few exercises, Yon-Rogg chucked you a baton as he held out his own. You started slowly as you felt your muscles begin to remember the exercises that had been drilled into your head. But you could feel Yon-Rogg holding back. He wasn't hitting you hard. And you purposefully gave him opportunities to take you down. But he didn't. You pushed him, \"Come on, hit me. I can take it.\" \"Y/N.\" He warned as you swung out at him wildly. \"I can take it.\" You growled. He shook his head, taking a step back as he dodged your aggressive attacks, \"You just started training today. You need to take it easy.\" You let out a grunt of annoyance as he easily ducked your baton again. \"You never had problems attacking me before. Don't go easy on me now, I'm not gonna break.\" He shook his head as he slammed the baton down at you again. Your arm screamed under the pressure but you pushed back at him. \"Come on.\" You shouted, reaching out and shoving him back. His eyes flashed and he swung out and soon you were going faster and hitting harder. Right. Left. Right. Duck. Jump. You smiled as you landed a blow. And then another. But you had been cocky. Without warning, he kicked out your legs from beneath you. You slammed to the ground and looked up just in time to see the baton coming down at your head. But you didn't see the baton. You saw a whip. Your eyes slammed shut and you flinched back as you tried to sink into the ground. When nothing hit you, you relaxed minutely. A gentle hand touched your back and you shot to your feet, quickly backing away from Yon-Rogg. His eyes were worried as he looked at you with sadness. \"I don't need your pity.\" You spit out. He took a step forward and reached out, but you pulled away and took off down the hall. It wasn't until a few hours later when you were lying on the roof of the ship, looking at the stars, that he came to you. He laid silently next to you, giving you the choice to start the conversation for yourself. \"I thought I was ready.\" You whispered so quietly that when he didn't respond you thought he hadn't heard you. \"It's going to take time.\" You sat up abruptly, \"We don't have time. I need to be strong, not weak.\" Yon-Rogg reached out, his hand cupping your face, forcing you to look at him, \"No, you're the strongest person I've ever met.\" You smiled, \"Stronger than you?\" \"I wouldn't go that far.\" He chuckled. You turned into him, curling up against him, his hands ran gently up and down your back. \"Y/N, you need to sleep.\" You nodded, not really paying attention as you poured over the documents in front of you. You had taken over his ship's workroom, papers thrown everywhere, your notes taped all over the walls. \"Y/N.\" He called louder. You hummed in response, as you stood, pinning another paper onto the wall. \"We're gonna need help.\" \"Yeah.\" You mumbled absentmindedly. \"I think we should contact Lora.\" He said bluntly. You continued working for a few minutes, before his words sunk in and your head shot up, \"Are you out fucking your mind? She tortured me. She tortured you.\" \"If we have any chance to get this chip off, it's with her help.\" You scoffed, \"What makes you think she'll even help us? She could easily turn us over to the Supreme Intelligence.\" \"She was there for me when you were dead. When I thought you were dead. She helped me when the guards were reporting on me back to the Supreme Intelligence. She's the reason I wasn't publicly executed.\" You knew he was speaking sense. There was no other way you would be able to get this chip off of him. Only Kree technology would be able to remove it. \"Fine. Set up a meeting. But if I kill her. It's not my fault.\" Yon-Rogg set up a meeting with her the next day. You sat quietly for the rest of the day refusing to speak to him. You knew something was going to go wrong. You stood silently in the alleyway watching as the woman of your nightmares approached you. \"Y/N. Long time no see.\" Lora said. Without hesitating, you punched her across the face.

Adora was the niece of one of the biggest mobsters of all time. Her uncle had just gotten busted for a job he pulled and she was on the run from the police. The police officer and his dog were chasing her down the street. \"Find her boy! She couldn't have gotten far!\" Derek said. He was a young man, in his early 30s, and he was one of the best guys on the force. His dog, Delgado, was the best partner he could have. \"I'll find her. But more than anything I sense fear,\" Delgado responded. Even though humans can't understand or hear animals, he still tried to communicate through barking. Delgado then heard a crash and quickly chased after the sound. He saw Adora had stumbled over some trash cans in an ally and was desperately trying to get up. He pounced on her and began to pull at her dress. \"L-LET GO OF ME! BAD DOG!\" Adora screeched, trying to pull herself free. \"Not in your life kid! If I let you go, you may end up like your uncle,\" Delgado thought as he kept pulling her. Adora tried to break free, but it was no use. Delgado was much stronger. Suddenly, they heard Derek's voice. \"Delgado! Where are ya boy?!\" Derek called. He then heard Adora's struggles and then turned to see Delgado had her pinned to the ground. \"There you are.\" \"S-stay away from me!\" Adora growled, still trying to get away from the dog. \"Calm down. I'm not gonna hurt you.\" Derek said softly. \"Leave me alone!\" She angrily replied, now standing up, only to be trapped in Derek's arms. \"Kid, your uncle is behind bars, but there is still the matter of what to do with you!\" \"We could take her to the station, but if we do, what will happen to her?\" Delgado barked to himself. \"I have to talk to the chief to see what he thinks; in the meantime, you need to come with me to the station!\" Derek replied. \"NO WAY!\" She growled and kicked him in his shin! Derek yelled in pain and she took off running only to have Delgado jump on her and knock her down. While he was trying to keep her down, he accidentally bit her arm! He was trying to bite her sleeve, but missed his target because of her moving. Adora yelled in pain; it wasn't a deep wound, but enough to hurt! \"Kid! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to bite you!\" Delgado gasped (knowing she couldn't understand him) as he now tried to lick her wound, but Adora's eyes widened in horror as she tried one more time to escape. Derek, however, was on her in a flash. He called the station and told them about the situation. Since they were close to his house, he was given permission to take her home and get her wounds cleaned up. Once they arrived at the house, Adora ran in the house and hid under the bed for safety. She was truly terrified and she slowly began to cry. She stopped crying only because she heard whimpering. She turned and saw Delgado pawing at her and trying to get her to come out. \"C'mon kid. No tears now…\" He whimpered softly. But Adora's eyes widened and she tried to move even further under the bed. \"Kid calm down; I'm not gonna hurt you.\" \"What's the matter boy?\" Derek asked, now seeing his dog pawing at someone under the bed and whimpering. Derek got down on his stomach and saw Adora with her face in her hands, trying not to cry. \"Kid…kid what's wrong? C'mon out of there.\" \"L-leave me alone…\" \"No…I'm not gonna leave you alone kid. Not until you tell me what's going on.\" Derek responded softly. \"She needs to come out of there!\" Delgado barked, now attempting to crawl under the bed. Adora gasped as she saw Delgado begin to dog crawl towards her as he wiggled himself under the bed. \"Don't be scared. I'm a good dog…\" Delgado cooed as he now approached her. \"Get her boy…\" Derek smiled, knowing what his dog was gonna do. Adora screamed in fright as Delgado closed in, but then began to laugh as the dog began to lick her all over her face. \"AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAAHAHAH STOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHHOOHOOP!\" \"He's not gonna stop until you come out of there. He wants to meet you and so do I,\" Derek smiled as he too crawled under the bed and began to tickle Adora on her ears and neck! Adora squeaked and tried to escape them by crawling all the way with her back to the wall. \"Where do you think you're going?\" Derek smiled, now crawling after her. \"I think she thinks we're gonna give up,\" Delgado barked. \"We're not done with you yet kid!\" Derek laughed, now grabbing her arm and pulling her to his chest. He then held the squirming girl to him and crawled out with her. He then gently tossed her on the bed and pinned her down to keep her from running away from him. Adora's eyes widened in shock. \"Shhhh…easy…we're not gonna hurt you…\"Derek whispered, now brushing her hair from her face and gently rubbing her head. \"What's your name?\" \"Adora.\" She responded with a small smile as she blushed and leaned into his touch. \"Well Adora…I didn't mean to scare you…\" \"And I'm so sorry I hurt you! I didn't mean to…\" Adora then felt him put a gentle hand on her mouth. \"Shhhh…it's ok…isn't it boy?\" Derek winked at Delgado. Delgado barked happily and then jumped on the bed next to them. Adora sleepily yawned and Derek laid her on his chest. \"Get some rest young one. We will take care of you,\" Derek whispered as he hugged her softly and then he and Delgado watched over her til they too fell asleep. guestsurprise: Just a thought I had! ;) newbienovelistRD: And a very cute one too! ^^ ","Summary":" guestsurprise saw Beverly Hills Chihuahua and made a story about Delgado, her absolute favorite dog"},{"Movie":"Beverly Hills Chihuahua","Title":"Beverly Hills Chihihuahua 2","Author":"Ivy Devi","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6731638","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: NO flames please or constructive criticism even for just this fanfic.

I only own Wynter, the main character, and all others you don't recognize. I was laying in my kennel, staring out to the otherside of the building. It is amazing really. How different this cage is, though it's used for the same purpose. There was an extremely nervous little pup in the cage next to mine. Well, either a pup or a chihuahua. I could never tell the difference. I turned to the other dogs in the building, stiffly, and barked, \"Stop talking, all of you. It doesn't make a difference if you talk or pray, someone is going to die by the time the hours over, whether dog or human, and there's nothing we can do about it.\" I heard a young voice speak from behond me. So it is a pup. \"Could you tell us a story? It might take our minds off of our, iminent death, as you put it.\" He spoke the last part with a little bit of a sarcastic tone. Definetly a pup. But he does have a point. \"Okay, I will. But no interruptions. This is an experience of mine, from long ago, when I was just barely out of puphood. Much stronger than I am now sure, but much, much dumber. It all started when a little prissy white chihauhua had been picked up off a beach around midnight, and dropped off at the dogfights. No, it wasn't these dogfights. The owner of that one was much richer, with much poorer kennels.\" \"There was also a retired police dog, a german shepard there.

Chloe looked bashfully down at her front paws. \"No, of course not,\" she said, adding, almost as if she could read her lifemate's thoughts, \"No one collars us. We're chi-wow-huas. Except . . . \" Her big, chocolate eyes slowly raised back up to face Papi. \"I already have been collared. I'm owned, Papi.\" Papi jumped. \"No one owns a chi-wow-hua!\" he exclaimed, tossing his head proudly into the air. \"But I like this owner,\" Chloe started hesitantly, her own tail slowly beginning to wag. She took a few steps closer to her mate. \"Actually, I love him quite a lot.\" She smiled, amending, \"With all my heart.\" He stilled and looked at her in confusion. Seeing his eyes begin to darken with anger and jealousy, Chloe hurried on, \"I love him. He owns my heart, so he owns me.\" \"Who is this - ?\" Papi started fiercely. Chloe's giggle stopped Papi in mid-demand. \"It's you, Papi,\" she said, pressing her nose to his tawny cheek. Her entire body wriggled. \"You own my heart. I'm all yours. The ribbon is for you.\" Papi nearly melted but refused to forget her error. She had to understand what they really meant to each other and that no one could own a chiwowhua. His front paws shifted anxiously with his barely controlled excitement as he yipped to her, \"Mi corazon, you are my heart, and you own my heart. Still, no one owns a chi-wow-hua! Although it is my honor and upmost blessing to own your heart, you are still your own chi-wow-hua. I would never think of quelling your independence or trying to control you in any way!\" He took a dangling end of her ribbon in his mouth, and from around it, continued, \"You have no need of collars, leashes, or ribbons for you are in possession of your own self! You are a free chi-wow-hua, as beautiful as the day is long, and although I will follow you always to the end of Earth and beyond, if need be, no one, not even I, will ever rule you!\" He tugged her ribbon from her neck. \"Oh, Papi!\" Chloe exclaimed, giggling and rolling her eyes at his declaration. \"I meant nothing wrongful by it! I know we are strong and able to stand on our own feet. I know no one else rules us. But you do rule my heart, and I choose to give all that I am to you!\" \"As all that I am is yours, mi amor, but you still don't need this ribbon.\" He had managed to pull some of the ribbon from her neck, but the other part seemed to determine to hang on. He nibbled at it, his teeth and tongue lightly grazing her fur. \"Oh, Papi!\" Chloe again exclaimed, giggling. She licked his cheek and then his ear, and this time, he did melt, forgetting all about his declarations of their status as chi-wow-huas, letting the ribbon fall the rest of the way from her neck, turning his mouth toward hers, dancing back on his little paws so that he could get the best possible aim, and kissing the chi-wow-hua that would always be his life mate. \"Happy Valentine's Day, Papi!\" Chloe sighed happily between their sweet and passionate kisses. The wag of his tail swept through his entire body so that he shook with his joyful excitement from the tip of his black nose all the way through the ends of his paws. \"Happy Valentine's Day, mi corazon!\" As it had been since Chloe had first allowed Papi into her heart, their Valentine's Day spent together truly was a momentous, romantic, and wonderful celebration!

Between the games he had played with them and his enchanting, beloved Chloe; the feast they had shared; and the time spent alone with his wife, today had truly been a wonderful day, but then, every day with his lady love was a day in paradise. Chloe mimicked her husband's sigh as she snuggled deeper into his soft, tawny fur. \"Are you happy?\" she whispered, licking his ear. \"Very,\" he responded in a deep, pleasured voice, his tail wagging quietly on the rug behind them. Chloe stifled a yawn. \"Today was a busy day. We haven't had such fun in a long time!\" He grinned, lowered his head, and licked her between her toes, causing a double shiver to run throughout her body both from pleasure and from the remembrance that she had actually deigned to play in the mud with him. It was rare that her love asked her to do anything, and she'd known, from the look on his handsome face and in his deep, loving eyes that he'd been aching for her to join him in his play. She still had trouble believing that she had actually done so, however, though, with a sly smile and a slight thump of her tail, she had to admit that it had been kind of fun. Completely disgusting, horribly messy, and totally unladylike but also, and although she'd never admit it, of course, fun. \"Thank you,\" Papi said softly. Chloe blinked in surprise. \"For what?\" she questioned, gazing into his deep, brown eyes. \"For everything,\" he said with a smile full of love and contentment, his tail wagging rapidly. \"For loving me. For giving me the best birthday ever. For giving me the best puppies ever. For making my life a wonderland of joy! For letting me love you.\" \"Oh, Papi!\" Chloe cried, her tail wagging ninety miles an hour. \"You always know just what to say!\" She snuggled even closer to him, until there was not even a breath of space left between their furry bodies, and covered his face with licks and kisses. Papi smiled and nudged her gently. \"There is one more thing I would like for my birthday, mi corazon,\" he admitted in a quiet, husky whisper. \"Name it, mi amor,\" she replied, using one of the many Spanish terms of love that she had picked up from him. He nuzzled her ear as he whispered his request in her ear, careful to keep his voice so low that no one would know just what he was requesting save the two of them. Covering her beautiful face with a shy paw, Chloe blushed. \"Oh, Papi!\" she cried, and then she laughed, her brown eyes dancing with merriment and all the love she'd ever feel for him alone. \"Of course, sweetheart. It would be my honor to work on our second litter with you.\" Papi nuzzled her some more and then nudged her gently with his nose. \"After you, mi corazon,\" he whispered, his heart soaring ever more with love. He always thought he couldn't possibly love her more for his love for her filled his entire being, heart, and soul and was the greatest power he'd ever known, and yet, somehow, by some magical means he could not explain, his love for his wondrous mate grew more every second of every minute of every day and night. The two lovers scampered off together and entwined in secret, their tails curling around each other in the shape of the heart in which their souls were forever entwined. \"Happy birthday, Papi,\" Chloe whispered as she began to cover his every warm, excitedly wriggling inch with loving licks and passionate kisses. \"Oh, chiwowhua!\" Papi groaned as they soared again throughout the tenderest and greatest passion and power ever known to animal, or man, kind: true love! The smile that filled his handsome, furry face was one of the biggest he had ever worn. Today truly had been perfect, but he knew that as long as he was with his lady love, his corazon, his wondrous, most delightful Chloe, that every day that followed would be just as perfect for that was the path of the love they shared and that path truly was their Heaven on Earth!

That's the number of stories that were sitting on my hard drive collecting dust because I lack the energy and time to take care of them as I once did. My betaing pattern has always been to write, then type up if written on paper, the story, read it aloud to my beloved Jack and our children, editing as I go, and then finally format and post. Sadly, this part is simply taking too much of my time and energy, and my beloved Jack and I have too little time together in person these days to be able to keep up with my stories. So what to do? Give up writing? I actually considered it for a while, tried to make excuses to myself other than the large number of stories collecting cyber dust on my computer, as to why I lacked the energy and Muse to write new tales. And then, with the turn of the new year, I decided to stop running and face the problem. The problem is, quite frankly, that once one gets so bogged down in formatting and editing that writing is no longer a pleasure but the actual posting of those writings becomes a hassle and - egad! - work, it's time to cut something out, and that will never be the writing process. So, in short, yes, there will be mistakes in this tale. Yes, it's missing about half of the header information I usually include. But I wrote it for pleasure and am posting it in hopes of sharing that pleasure with others. Do with it as you will.

Almira I do. :) Delgado sat with Tomas, on the sidelines. They were taking a rest, water and food available a few feet away. There was only one dog out of 12 that that wasn't resting; another German shepherd. Delgado's eyes watched her as she continued to run the course; she was swift, precise. He couldn't help but notice the shiny tone to her fur as she moved, the way her sleek ears fell back to her head when she jumped through the tire jump, her muscles contracting and releasing as she jumped up onto the platform and then off again. \"Delgado, cousin, you're staring again. And getting drool all over my paw.\" Tomas said, smirking. \"I am not. I'm merely...admiring a fellow officer's ability to do her job effectively.\" He said, licking his mouth to see if there was any drool. Tomas rolled his eyes. \"Yeah Delgado, whatever you say. She's quite the woman, though.\" He noted as she took down the pretend criminal, pulling his leg out from under him harshly. 'Yeah,' Delgado thought, 'She can certainly hold her own.'. \"Alright Sergeant Almira, go take a rest girl. You did good today.\" Her partner scratched her head briefly before letting her go eat. She trotted past the rest of them, decidedly ignoring the cat calls and suggestive growling. As the only female in this group, she had to often endure suggestive comments, and as she passed Delgado and Tomas, she rolled her eyes, snorting under her breath. She bent her head to lap up some water, when one of the newer officers, a young one, just a few months into his training, came up behind her. He took a whiff of her tail and she choked on her water, wheeling around. \"What do you think you're doing?!\" She snarled, eyes narrowing and hackles starting to raise. Delgado could feel his own eyes narrowing; this was the workplace, not some dog park. Not to mention he should be respecting the higher ranks. \"You're kinda cute when you're angry, nena(1).\" He said confidently. She growled, slipping her front legs down, reading to leap at any moment. \"Stop while you're ahead, cadet!\" She warned, and he smirked, going closer. He clearly didn't have a brain, and Delgado was getting extremely annoyed at the dog. 'He shouldn't be treating a higher ranking officer in such a way; especially after she told him to back down!' he tried to convince himself that's the only reason he was annoyed. \"Come on, niña(2) Don't be like that.\" Delgado was about to get up and storm over when she leapt at the cadet, easily mauling him over. She bit his ear on the special pressure point and he yelped immediately. She pulled him up, him cowering in pain beneath her. \"I said back down, Cadet. Next time, control yourself and remember I am your superior officer, got it?\" Her words were muffled, but rang clear. He whimpered a yes, and she let him go roughly, shoving him away from her. She returned to the bowls, scarfing some food down before going to the opposite corner of the fence and laying down, head in her paws, sun shining in her fur. Delgado sighed. 'Don't get up, Don't get up, Don't- aw hell.' He raised himself off the ground and trotted over to the other sergeant, ignoring Tomas' \"Delgado?\". Slowly, he lowered himself onto the ground next to her. She didn't look at him. \"Are you alright?\"Almira moved her head on her paws to look up at him. He found himself desperately trying not to lose himself in her brown eyes. \"I'm fine. I get that stuff almost constantly. Just another obstacle in my line of work.\" She said, moving her head back again. \"You handled it well.\" He supplied, and she grinned. \"His weakness is his pride. I pummeled it to the ground and he caved.\" \"Sneaky.\" She smiled at that, standing up as her partner called for her. \"I'm not always mischief-proof. I'm Almira, by the way.\" She said, trotting away to the exit, where her partner was flagging her down, leash in hand. \"Delgado.\" He called after her, standing. She sent him a grin over her shoulder, and he watched both her and human walk away, beyond the bars. He glanced over where Tomas was sitting, a smirk on his face, shaking his head. Delgado looked away, acting as if nothing had happened. The next time he saw Almira was at a junior training program. Delgado personally didn't want to be there, but the other dog had a severe case of colic and couldn't make it. So there he was, gruff, weathered Delgado, sitting next to his partner in front of a line of 10 puppies and their handlers. He looked up at his partner, glaring. He earned a shrug in response. The gates opened again, and Almira trotted over to Delgado and his partner, grinning. \"Delgado, right? You're Marcus' replacement?\" She asked, sitting next to him. \"Yeah.\" He said gruffly. They sat as the handlers managed to quiet the puppies down, and each Almira and Delgado had to run the baby course in slow motion, so the puppies could see how it was done. Delgado sighed angrily as he flattened himself to the ground to get into the tire jump. It was basically sitting on the ground, the 5 inch jump seemingly enough for the little puppies. He crawled through it, and watched Almira's eyes narrow as she followed. One by one, each puppy attempted to jump through it. The last puppy was a couple inches smaller than the rest; probably the runt, and got stuck on the jump, his front legs on one side and his back legs on the other, neither quite touching the ground. Delgado held back a snort, but Almira calmly got up and moved to the puppy, grabbing him by the scruff of the neck and pulling him through. She put him down at the end of the line, a few yards away from the jump and nuzzled him into a sitting position. \"Keep trying; you'll get it.\" She said, smiling at him and he beamed back at her. Delgado smiled as well. 'She'd make an impressive mother...' he couldn't help the thoughts of her nursing puppies, himself sitting protectively behind her. He shook his head. 'Focus, Delgado. Focus.' The next night they ran into each other in front of the barracks. She was just coming out of the grooming building, fur still slightly damp. He was on his way to the mess hall for dinner. \"Hey Delgado. How are you?\" She asked him, smiling. He grinned. \"So-so. Yourself?\" Her brown eyes twinkled. \"Better, now I'm clean. Cadet training today.\" She explained, and he shook his head. \"Better you than me,\" She pushed at his shoulder with her paw, \"I was just going to go find something to eat. Would you like to join me?\" He asked, and she smiled wider. \"Like a date, Sergeant Delgado?\" Delgado felt his face get warm under his fur, very fast. \"Yes- I mean no!\" He couldn't find a cover in time and she laughed. \"Ok, ok. I'd love to.\" They settled down, eating their food and chatting in the corner, by the kitchen door. \"So how's Tomas?\" She asked, and he shrugged. \"He's with his wife; their expecting puppies soon.\" He said, and she grinned. \"Really? Well what do you know...Seems like just yesterday we were in Cadet training together and now he's expecting puppies.\" \"You were in Cadet training together?\" Delgado asked; surprised. Tomas never said anything about it. \"Sure. He was the shyest thing. Ah well, he's certainly matured out now. Puppies...wow.\" She chuckled into her food, taking another bite. \"So do you have someone?\" She asked, looking up at him curiously. He snorted. \"Nah. Tomas is the ladies man, not me.\" He said, and she grinned. \"Must have been a lot of broken hearts.\" He snorted. \"Hardly. And yourself? Anyone special on your end?\" She took a couple gulps of water. \"No. There's only a couple dogs here that aren't pigs, and their either taken or a heart breaker.\" He blinked as she grinned, almost slyly. 'Is she flirting with me?' He wondered, finishing the last couple bites of his food, as she did. It was dark out when they left the hall a couple minutes later, and she yawned. \"I'll walk you back to you're kennels.\" He said, and she smiled. \"I wonder if all those criminals you've caught know you're such a gentleman?\" She teased, and he chuckled. \"Yes, because I hold the door open for them and everything when I put them away.\" She laughed and he found that all to soon they were at her kennels. \"Well then, Sergeant, thank you for a wonderful evening.\" She said, looking up at him and smiling. \"You're welcome.\" He supplied, unable to think of anything else, but smiling softly back at her. \"I have to say, though, this was my first not-date-date.\" She teased. His fur got hot again, and heard himself saying \"It can be a date if you want it to be.\" She smiled softly, and he got caught in her eyes again. \"I'd like that.\" Somehow, he found himself leaning in slowly and pressing his nose to hers before licking the side of her muzzle. Her eyes went wide and he backed away, horrified with himself. \"I'm sorry, that was completely out of line.\" He said, looking away. \"Delgado.\" He looked back at her, and she was smiling softly. He blinked. She leaned in and nuzzled his face, licking the base of his ear where it connected to his skull. \"I didn't mind.\" She said, and he felt a grin on his face. \"Same time tomorrow?\" He asked her, and she laughed. \"Wouldn't miss it for the world.\" The next day he couldn't help but stare as she climbed the ramp in the dog walk, trotting across it. \"Come on, Delgado. One more circuit. Don't quit on me now, buddy. Ogle your girlfriend later.\" His partner said, and Delgado glared at him, before finishing off his run. He watched as Almira finished, taking her sweet time as she finished last. She jumped the barrier and landed perfectly, before trotting over to Delgado and Tomas. \"See something you like enough to stop in the middle of the track, Sergeant?\" She asked him. \"Thought I saw an angel.\" He said, and she chuckled. She sat down in front of them, and Tomas raised and eyebrow. \"I'm missing something.\" He noted. \"Yes, Tomas, you are. Congrats on the future pups, by the way.\" She said, and he beamed. \"Thanks Almira. What about you? Still wild or is there someone who can actually keep you in check?\" \"Tomas, nothing could slow me down.\" She countered, and snuck a glance at Delgado, who smirked. Just then, the Cadet from before turned up. \"Hey Nena.\" She growled at him. \"Remember what happened last time before you say anything else, Andres.\" She warned, and he grinned cockily. Delgado's eyes narrowed. He did not like where this was going, at all. \"Yeah...about that. I figured with a little time a pretty little thing like you could change your mind. Whatcha say?\" He asked. 'Who does he think he is, talking to her like...like...like she's incapable of intelligence?!' Delgado thought angrily. He had had enough of this dog. \"Actually, cadet, Sergeant Almira has stayed in a good sense of mind and she has plans for tonight. As your commanding officer, I'm ordering you to remember your rank and respect, and as her date I'm telling you to leave her alone.\" Delgado growled, getting up and placing himself between Andres and Almira. Andres ducked his head and backed away, tail nearly between his legs. \"Your pest should stay away now.\" He said, swinging around. The entire squad was watching Delgado and Andres, although Delgado was ignoring them. Almira grinned, laughing quietly. \"I could have handled it, but I admit yours was much more dramatic. Thank you.\" She licked the side of his face, and the entire squad, including Tomas, 'ooooooooooooh!'ed, teasing. The last time he saw her before the dog fights was a couple months later, a couple days after the accident. He was laying in the shade of the male kennel building, not looking at anyone, but staring at the fenced in course. Almira was going at the run again,and when she finished she went over to Tomas. As far as Delgado could see, she was asking Tomas something, because Tomas jerked his head in Delgado's direction. She immediately went immediately to the exit, scratching at it and barking, looking over at her partner and back to the exit. Her partner let her out and Delgado let his tail swing back and forth a couple times in the dirt as he watched her come closer. She stood over him, licking his head all over. He chuckled. \"Miss me, Princesa(3)?\" He asked and she laid down next to him. \"More than you would ever know, soldier.\" He licked her muzzle and she put her head across his back. \"I have some wonderful news, but I heard something awful happened on your bust. Tell me that first, then I'll tell you. Your partner's in the hospital, you were in the medical kennel, what happened?\" He sighed, and she felt guilty for bringing it back up. But she had to know, that way the air was cleared for her wonderful news. \"We were ambushed. I went down and so did my partner.\" She gasped, and licked the back of his ear. This was one of the first times he'd done a bust and not succeeded. \"It's ok Delgado...Once your partner heals you can keep on trying to show me up on the course!\" She tried, nudging the back of his head. He just sighed and put his head down. \"Delgado?\" \"Here's the thing, though...Almira...They're...laying me off.\" \"What?!\" She gasped, reeling back to sit up. He looked at her, lifting up his head. \"I can't...I can't follow a scent anymore. I can't smell you, or any of the other dogs or humans here.\" He said, looking away. Ashamed. Almira settled back down, shell shocked, and began licking the side of his face and neck. They stayed like that for very long time, until their partners came to bring them inside. Almira gasped, and tugged on her leash, looking around for Delgado, but his tail had just disappeared inside the heavy kennel door. She sighed sadly. Tomorrow, then. Delgado shook his head as he sat in his kennel. He wouldn't see her for a while. He was gone early in the morning. He wouldn't say goodbye. It would be easier if he just left, so she wouldn't have the finality of it. Delgado returned a few days later, Chihuahua in tow. He exchanged words with Tomas about reading the tag. He searched the course for Almira, hoping to see her. He had to explain; he had to talk to her, make sure she was alright. But she wasn't there. He parted with Tomas, not asking. He was...scared to know. Almira sighed, lounging back on her partner's couch as he rubbed her ear. She was always tired now, and was out of commission for quite a while. Her stomach had swelled, in another seven weeks or so there would be some new arrivals. Every so often one of the little ones would kick out inside her, but it didn't bother her too much...only at night while she was trying to sleep. She didn't know how many were in there, but she didn't care. She licked her swollen belly proudly, and her partner grinned, petting her fur down again. The only thing that really hurt was that Delgado didn't know. And she didn't know if she'd ever see him again. Ramirez quickly set Delgado up with his old partner again, who was just getting out of the hospital. It was about a week or so after they had let him off the force, but they were quick to re-evaluate his skill and let him back on. \"Good to have you back, buddy.\" His partner grinned at him, and they entered the course again. \"Sergeant Delgado! Welcome back!\" \"Delgado, cousin, welcome back to the force.\" Tomas said, but Delgado noticed something a little more...frosty in his tone. \"What's the matter, Tomas? Where's Almira?\" Delgado asked roughly, slipping back into their usual spots near the food and water. \"She's on house rest.\" He was told, and Delgado looked at him quickly. \"Why? What happened? How bad is she?\" He asked, standing up again. Tomas look at him calmly. \"Tomas! Tell me!\" Delgado barked, and Tomas stood too. \"She's not hurt, Delgado. Not physically, anyway. She's hurting because you suddenly disappeared, but that's not why she's on house rest.\" Delgado's eyes narrowed. \"Tomas, enough with the riddles. Just tell me!\" \"She's pregnant, Delgado. Puppies are due in seven weeks, give or take a couple days.\" Delgado collapsed, frantically trying to do the math in his head. 1 week he was gone...seven weeks roughly...not to mention the act a week before he left... \"Tomas, where is she? Where's she staying?\" He asked his partner. \"You can't go see her right now, cousin. But she usually comes out for some air after we're done training.\" Tomas said, and nudged him back up. \"Come on, man. Show time.\" Delgado never ran the course so quick before. Almira waddled out of the heavy barracks door, her partner holding it open for her. She went and laid down in front of the mess hall, where her partner left her with some water and food in the shade. Cadets and dogs from various other ranks were just coming in from the course training, and she nodded to the ones she knew. One or two came over to see how she was doing, and offer their luck and congrats. Tomas and Celina had already had their puppies, 11 puppies; 2 boys and 9 girls. She laughed to herself quietly. Poor Tomas. But he loved them all anyway. She looked up from her water bowl as a pair of paws plodded into view. Tomas. \"Hey there Sergeant. Hows the cadets?\" He asked, and she grinned. By Cadets she knew he meant the puppies. \"Kicking. Yours?\" He smiled, eyes glinting. \"Well, one came home...\" He moved aside as she raised an eyebrow, revealing Delgado trying to run over, straining against his leash, which his partner hadn't had time to take of because Delgado was running as soon as the gate opened. \"Delgado! Boy, heel!\" His partner was calling. Almira got to her feet as soon as she could, with her belly in her way. \"Delgado! Oh Delgado!\" She cried, waddling forward. \"Almira...Almira....Almira....\" He nuzzled her face, licking it all over before lowering his nose to her swollen belly and sniffing it carefully. \"I'm sorry, Princesa. I just figured it would be easier if I didn't say goodbye.\" She looked at him. \"Sergeant Delgado if you ever leave me again, You will find yourself between a rock and a hard place!\" She said in her drill voice, the one she used to show cadets who was boss. \"Yes, Ma'am.\" He grinned. He was forgiven. Seven weeks later.... Delgado paced back and forth in front of the Vet's door, Tomas watching him, amused. Almira's partner was with Tomas' and Delgado's, sitting down in the hard plastic chairs. Finally, the vet came out with some blood on his plastic apron. Delgado winced. \"Sergeant Almira's partner? 7 healthy puppies.\" He said, and Delgado's tail started wagging. He could have been embarrassed, but it just wagged harder. \"Congratulations, cousin.\" \"Thank you, Tomas.\" Almira was laying in a bottom kennel, the door open to allow visitors. It was big; enough room for her to spread out and Delgado to join her with room for the puppies. She was on her side, the puppies huddled up against her, eyes still closed. She was nosing each one over, checking it and then re-checking. She looked up, eyes sparkling as Delgado and Tomas entered the room, partners following. Her partner was the first to duck in, congratulating her and rubbing her ears. She licked his hand and he duck out again, allowing Delgado to go in. He climbed in, first his front half, to sniff the puppies. \"Oh Delgado....4 boys and three girls.\" She said, and he licked her muzzle repeatedly before climbing in behind her; between her body and the wall. \"You did so well, Princesa. So well.\" He said, cleaning her ear. She put her head down as Tomas ducked in, just his head though. \"Congratulations, Sergeant.\" He said, and she laughed. \"Thank you, Tomas. Send my regard to Celina.\" \"I'll do just that.\" The Vet let Delgado stay with her for the night, and as the lights went off, the alarmed puppies started barking. Or...squeaking as it sounded to Delgado. \"Shh little ones! Shhh!\" Almira tried to soothe. Soon there was only one barking; but she wouldn't be quiet. \"Hey there! Shh! Let your mama rest!\" Delgado reached over, picking her up by the scruff of her neck and pulling her behind Almira's head, between his paws. She settled down as Delgado started licking her; trying to keep her quiet. \"You're so dashing, Delgado.\" Almira said drowsily. \"You saw nothing. Sleep Princesa.\" He said, watching his family fall asleep. Completely whole, completely happy. What'd ya'll think? I think it turned out pretty well! R and R people, I really enjoy your feedback! 1: Babe 2: girl 3: Princess ","Summary":" Love on the Job Disclaimer: I Do not own Beverly Hills Chihuahua.

Yes, I realize that it had real-life actors portraying themselves in name, but they were really playing characters in a fictional movie. I had an idea while watching, what if there was a girl that was in the close-knit friend group that is Seth Rogen, James Franco, Danny McBride, ect.? How would she come into play in the movie? I thought it could be funny. If people review, I'll keep writing! Please review if you like. I \" Jesus , Blake. What's the big deal? Just come tonight! It'll be fun.\" Seth's voice barked in my ear. I held my phone away from my ear at his loud voice. I rolled my eyes as I walked around my house, then gripping my iPhone tightly to my ear. I flopped onto my bed and laid down, sprawled out lazily, watching the ceiling fan swirl above me. My head was hanging over the end of the bed, my hair falling over. I bit my lip, huffed, and barked back at my friend, \"Because the last time I went to a party at Franco's house, he got drunk, smacked my ass, pissed on me, and wouldn't stop talking about his art.\" Seth laughed into the receiver, his infamously ugly laugh making me smile. He croaked, \"You're still not over that? That was one time.\" \"Me and James fight every time we're together!\" I argued, \"You know how we are. Remember that time during Pineapple Express ? We got in that fist fight on set and Danny had to step in and hold me back? Yeah, you know how James and I are, Seth.\" \"That was hilarious ,\" Seth snorted, \"Or that time when the two of you had a fight at the 127 Hours premiere in front of all the paparazzi...or at the Milk premiere...or at the Oscars after party...\" \"Yes, I remember, Seth.\" I interrupted, putting my hand over my face in frustration, \"It's not my fault James is a pretentious stoner asshole who's got his own head up his ass, no matter how much I love him.\" \"Says you.\" Seth retorted. \"Says his butt buddy.\" I replied, laughing. \"Says his fuck buddy.\" Seth shot back at me. \" Seth !\" I snapped. \"All joking aside, Blake, you really need to come tonight. It'll be great!\" Seth said, enthused. \"Is Dave going to be there?\" I asked, arching my eyebrows. \"No, he's shooting in New York this week.\" Seth replied. \"Fuck. That's the only Franco I love.\" I said, laughing. \"Look, you're in our little gang and if you don't come it wouldn't be the same. All the guys are expecting you to go. Everyone's gonna be there. And I think it would hurt James's feelings if you just fuckin' ignored his invite like that. You guys may hate each other but you're still close. And what better thing do you have planned for tonight? Getting stoned by yourself and watching Titanic alone in the dark again?\" Seth snorted. I bit my lip again and looked around, then muttered into my cell phone, \"No...\" \"Or what was it last time? The Lion King ?\" \"Shut up!\" I laughed. \"Hah! Exactly .\" Seth said, \"I got some great weed, some vodka, some great shit. I know you want to come. And I've got a surprise for you. So if you don't show up at Franco's house-warming party, I'm gonna kick your ass.\" \"Is that a threat?\" I said playfully, sitting up on my bed, my hair flipping back over my face as I did so. \"It's a promise.\" Seth chuckled, \"But really, come. Or you'll be fuckin' lame.\" \"Bullied by Seth Rogen,\" I said, getting up and going to my closet, \"My life.\" \"That's fucking right . Now go get ready, do whatever you gotta do, and meet me at Franco's in thirty minutes.\" Seth said, and hung up. I sighed and threw my iPhone onto my bed. Here I was, Blake Reid, reasonably successful actress, being bullied by my friend into going to a party. That's what you get when you have friends like Seth Rogen, Danny McBride, James Franco and the whole gang of stoner actors. I'd known Seth and James since I was in a few episodes of Freaks and Geeks when I was eighteen. I was friends with Danny from Pineapple Express and when I was in Tropic Thunder . I knew Jonah Hill and Craig Robinson through the three idiots: Danny, Seth, and James. We had a mischievous little group of friends, and sometimes I wondered why I was the only girl. I was a reasonably popular actress, mostly known for Judd Apatow movies, and occasional serious roles, but I was pretty much associated in Hollywood with the clowns I called my friends. And, not to mention the infamous fights James and I always had. The paparazzi ate that up, and it was always published in magazines like Us Weekly, OK! Magazine, Star, People, and more. Sometime's the tabloids like TMZ , E! Entertainment News , and Entertainment Tonight would say we were dating. A few times I'd be at the grocery store trying to buy some groceries and I'd see a whole stand of tabloid magazines with pictures of James and I fighting on them. People in the grocery store would stare at me and ask if I was the real Blake Reid, and I'd regrettably say yes. Then they'd ask about the Reid/Franco feud. It was infamous, our public fights. But then we wouldn't fight, and everyone thought we were dating. But secretly, I loved it when people thought that. It was a love-hate relationship. Really classy. Maybe I should have a group of girl friends. But then again...nothing was more fun than partying with the losers I call my friends. I became extremely close to the boys instantly, and had been for a while, but James and I were a whole other story. We teased each other constantly; whether it was when I had to play his girlfriend in Pineapple Express , when we would hangout at parties, or at his or my movie premieres. We'd known each other for years, and we were always at each other's throats. We'd hooked up three times, twice when we were drunk. One of the worst incidents to date was when I'd gotten so unbelievably drunk that I agreed to bet Danny that I could be sexier than the girls in the Blurred Lines music video. To prove it, I'd given James a lap dance with Blurred Lines by Robin Thicke playing at a party and I blacked out and fainted on top of him. Not many girls can say they've given a lap dance to James Franco and during the middle of it fainted on him. The worst part was that Danny had recorded it on his cell phone, and so did Jonah and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. And then they put it on YouTube, and went viral. And then it was all over TMZ and every entertainment outlet. Best friends ever. The guys never stopped teasing us about it, always commenting on how James and I were \"fuck buddies\". I'd shoot Danny or Seth a look and they'd shut up, then crack up. Hundreds of girls would consider it a blessing to call herself a close friend of heartthrob James Franco's and be able to go to his parties. I'd always had this thing for him, but we also annoyed the shit out of each other. Seth said 'everyone' was going, so maybe the party wouldn't be too bad. I sucked it up and ransacked my closet, grabbing a pair of black leggings, gladiator sandals and a simple white, flowing tank top. I didn't bother fussing with my hair and left it down. I slapped on some foundation and mascara, grabbed my purse, threw my phone in and headed out. I walked out of my house in the Hollywood hills and hailed a taxi. Living in California had its perks. It was a nice night out, a bit cool but warm. Seth had texted me James's address, and I read aloud the taxi driver James's address and sat back, regretting that I was going out tonight. If I had it my way, I probably would've invited Jonah and Seth over to watch a stupid movie and smoke, but whatever. All I could think about as I watched the city lights as the taxi drove through Hollywood was, This party better be worthwhile or I'll end you, Seth Rogen. The taxi cab pulled up and I stepped out, handing them a few dollars and shutting the car door. I stepped onto the sidewalk in front of the house and marveled at its size. It was at least twice the size of my house, ultra-modern and absolutely gorgeous. I could hear the loud music even outside the house. I slung my bag over my shoulder and huffed, taking a deep breath before going in. I arrived at the fogged glass door, and I could hear the chaotic ramblings from inside. Before ringing the doorbell, I debated just turning around and retreating back to my house. Was it worth it? I guess so, as I went against my better judgement and rang the doorbell with a wince. I stood there on the front step awkwardly, running a hand through my hair, pushing the blonde whisps away from my eyes. You'd think that after all these years I'd get over the butterflies in my stomach, and that I'd be over him, but I was still into him. The door swung open, revealing a very excited James Franco. \"My main bitch!\" James exclaimed holding his arms open for a hug, his charmingly wide grin welcoming me. I gave him my sassiest, smuggest look, \"My favorite douche-bag.\" \" I thought hurricane season was over !\" We said in unison, repeating our absolute favorite line from Pineapple Express. He laughed, grabbed me and hugged me, and I did the same, hugging him tight, feeling the warmth from the cardigan he was wearing. \"You came. That's my girl!\" He exclaimed. We both let go and he let me in. The house inside was gorgeous, very artsy. He shut the door behind me. \"I see you're wearing another one of your fashionable cardigans,\" I said mockingly, eyeing him up and down, \"Sexy.\" He was wearing another one of the obnoxious grandma-looking cardigans he always wore and I teased him about. God, I did have to say, he looked cute. \"I know.\" He said, grinning and shrugging. \"What do you think of the house?\" People crowded the house. It was a massive party, but the house itself was brilliant. Art hung from the walls, and the furniture was gorgeous. I looked over to the right of the door, where a giant penis statue stood. I whipped around to look at him. \"I love the house, James. But, uh...penis?\" I questioned, jerking my thumb to the statue. \"I think it adds a certain masculinity. It's art.\" He said, proving himself pretentious as always. \"I think it's a giant penis.\" I retorted, arching my eyebrows at him. \"Art.\" \"Penis.\" \" Art .\" \" Penis .\" \"Penis art.\" \"If you say so.\" I laughed. \"I think you like it, Blake.\" He retorted back, wagging a finger at me. I stuck my tongue out at him, and said teasingly, \"Not yours.\" Before the two of us could start going at it, there was a knock at the door. James turned to answer it, still giving me a sassy look. Seth stepped in, grinning as usual. \"Seth!\" James exclaimed, embracing him, \"Glad you could come, bro.\" \"I am, too. And look who's here, too.\" Seth said, putting his arms out and grinning at me. I gave him an attitude-filled glare, \"I was threatened by my jackass friend if I didn't show up.\" \"That's right,\" Seth laughed, dragging me into a hug, crushing me against him, kissing the top of my head. He reeked of weed and cologne. I laughed and hugged him back, \"Okay, Seth. Okay. Time to fess up. What's the surprise?\" Seth beckoned to the door, and Jay stepped into the doorway. \"Jay!\" I yelled, running to him and jumping onto him, hugging him. He hugged me back tightly. Jay Baruchel, my co-star in Tropic Thunder , and friend. One of the most awkward people I knew, but adorable all the same. He never quite fit with our little group of idiots, and I always felt bad about it. I feel like he thought that we were too close and that he couldn't come in, but all we wanted was for him to feel welcome. We'd gotten pretty close when we filmed Tropic Thunder together. He looked bothered, though, but smiled at me through it once I let him go of our embrace. \"Hey, Blake.\" He said, \"It's fantastic to see you.\" \"Same here,\" I exclaimed, smiling brightly at him. \"I didn't know you were in L.A.\" \"I told you I had a surprise.\" Seth said, smiling at me. \"Hey, Jason.\" James said, standing closely beside me. \"It's...it's, uh...it's Jay.\" Jay muttered uncomfortably with an awkward smile. \" James .\" I said, giving him a \"are you stupid?\" look for calling Jay the wrong thing. Of course he'd get Jay's name wrong, even after meeting him about fifty times. Idiot. Tipsy by J-Kwon throbbed through the party and the house, setting the mood perfectly for a Franco party. One, here comes the two to the three to the four Everybody drunk out on the dance floor Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour Maybe cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore Or maybe cause she heard that I buy out the stores Bottom of the nineth and a nigga gotta score If not I gotta move on to the next whore James slung an arm around me and pulled me close to him, \"Jonah and Craig's over by the table waiting for you guys. What do you say we grab some beer and light up?\" Everyone agreed and I looked up at James with an arched eyebrow, \"I'll grab some vodka from the fridge. Roll one for me, alright? I'm gonna go put my bag up in your room. All I need is for Michael to rifle through and steal my shit.\" At the same time, the two of us looked over to the other side of the crowded room to see Michael Cera snorting lines of cocaine and smacking Rihanna's ass, who in turn slapped him, hard, across the face. We stifled a laugh, and I slinked out of James's arms, walking towards the stairs. \"Okay, I'll roll one for you. But if you're not downstairs in a minute I'm smoking yours!\" He called after me, that dumb grin on his face. \"Don't you fucking dare, Franco!\" I called over the music, a small smile on my face as I walked through the crowds of party guests, over to the ultra-modern staircase. I looked down to the crowd as I walked up the staircase and he smiled at me and shrugged. I laughed and descended up the stairs and to James's bedroom, throwing my purse on the bed. I flopped down on his bed and threw off my shoes. I got up, took a deep breath, and left the room. I After all this time, I was still into him. Nevertheless, what was going to happen tonight was going to change everything . Reviews would be lovely![Chapter 2] II \"Holy shit, that's good stuff.\" I coughed, laughing as I sat around with the boys, smoking at James's coffee table. I took another hit, and James took it from my mouth and took a hit of mine. The party was in full swing. Celebrities that I'd known for a few years had come by to say hi, including Mindy Kaling, Jason Segal, Aziz Azari, and a few more. I'd gone outside by the pool and talked with Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jonah. A drunk and coked-up Michael Cera had stumbled over to us and slapped my butt (I guess that was a recurring theme with him tonight), causing me to spill my vodka all over Chris, and Michael had asked if I'd give him \"a lap dance like I'd given Franco\". After I said no, he'd blown a fistful of cocaine in Chris's face. Jonah and I gawked in shock at Michael, pushing him away, asking him what the hell was wrong with him. Chris was freaking out because he's never tried cocaine before. He was freaking out. While I hate Michael Cera and love Chris—we dated two years ago for a short period of time—I had to admit it was pretty funny. Especially when he shouted \"McBlowin'!\" instead of \"McLovin\" and blew the cocaine in Chris's face. After that little incident, I made my rounds around the party. I really didn't have a lot of girl friends in Hollywood. I don't know, it just seemed harder to be friends with competitive, catty girls, and it easy and more fun to be in a close-knit group of boy friends with the the clan I was friends with now. It was easy, no drama, and stress-less. I came outside after grabbing a lemon for my water out of the fridge. Everyone was outside sitting around Craig while he was sitting at keyboard, playing a tune. I squeezed through the crowd, standing in between Craig, James and Jonah. \"C'mon and take your panties off.\" Craig was crooning, playing the notes on the keyboard. Everyone laughed and repeated the line after him. \"Hey, Rihanna. C'mon and take your panties off for me!\" Craig sang lowly. Everyone laughed. \"C'mon, Craig can you fuck off of me?\" Rihanna sang back, swinging her head around with a smirk. I laughed, as did everyone else, a glass of vodka in my hand. I looked to Jay, who looked weirded out by the fun we were having. I arched my eyebrows in sympathy. He felt so out-of-place, I could tell. I felt horrible. He was in Los Angeles and he wasn't even having fun. \"Take your panties off.\" Craig crooned again, and the huge crowd of us repeated the line back to him. \"Girl you know you get me off. Girl, it's nothing to a boss. Give it to ya nice and soft. Blake, take them panties off for me.\" Craig sang, James and Jonah joining in. I smirked at them and laughed, rolling my eyes. May as well play along with my idiots, right? I looked at them and gave them a little grin and a little hip shake, grabbing Jonah and James's hands, \"C'mon, boys, then get on top of me.\" Everyone laughed. After that, everyone headed inside. Paper Planes by M.I.A. began playing through the stereo system, so naturally, James, Seth and I had to shout-sing the lyrics at each other. Pirate skulls and bones Sticks and stones and weed and bombs Running when we hit 'em Lethal poison through their system No one on the corner has swag like us Hit me on my burner prepaid wireless We pack and deliver like UPS trucks Already going to hell, just pumping that gas I sat with James and Seth for a little while by the obnoxious penis statue, where they were discussing plans for Pineapple Express 2 . I rolled my eyes as James explained to us the plotline. \"Okay, so I think that Red has become a drug lord, right? And Saul and Dale have to rescue you from him before he kills you for holding back information on the newest drug, okay? And then Saul sacrifices himself to save you and Dale.\" James explained to me, clearly very excited about the idea. Seth and I stared at him. While we all loved being in Pineapple Express, it was a weird idea. Seth seemed to love it, \"Yeah, man! I'm down. Let's do that shit.\" \"Blake? What about you?\" James asked, \"You in?\" \"Who wouldn't want to play Saul Silver's girlfriend again?\" I asked, giving him a smug grin, \"Of course I am. What about Danny as Red? He'll do it, right?\" Danny McBride. The epitome of awkward, annoying and asshole. But still one of my best friends. James didn't say anything, he just looked at me. And so did Seth. \"He has to play Red. There wouldn't be a Pineapple Express without him. Red's fucking hilarious because it's Danny. He needs to be in it.\" I commented, then asked, \"Wait. Where is he? I haven't seen him at all tonight.\" James shrugged. \"Don't tell me you didn't invite him.\" I said, arching my eyebrows at him with an \"are you serious?\" look on my face. James shrugged again. \"James! Danny's a close friend. You didn't invite him to your goddamn house-warming party?\" I asked, \"Why? That's like not inviting your own brother.\" \"He's been getting on my last nerve! He's annoying as shit and all he does is get drunk and take ecstasy in my fucking bathtub.\" James exclaimed, \"I'm sick of his shit.\" \" So we're replacing him as Red ?\" I asked, shocked, not believing what I was hearing. \"I never said that,\" James said carefully, \"I said I was sick of his shit. We'll see how he is.\" After that, James, Jonah, Craig, Seth, David Krumholtz, Aziz, and Jason Segal sat around on the couches by the coffee table in the middle of the party's crowds. I took up camp on James's couch and began smoking. Jay wasn't anywhere to be found, and I turned to Seth, whilst reaching for my joint from James and grabbing it from him, taking another drag. \"Where's Jay?\" I asked, \"He hasn't been with us all night. He seems...I don't know. Annoyed? Uneasy?\" \"Awkward? 'Cause he's awkward as fuck, man.\" James grumbled. I rolled my eyes at him, \"Don't be a bully.\" \"I think Jay's a very nice guy.\" Jonah said, going back to the original topic, smiling that \"America's sweetheart\" smile he always flashed. \"I think we should really try to welcome him into our friend group.\" \"Shut up, Jonah. You're just being a kiss ass.\" I laughed at him, taking James's joint and inhaling. \"Hey, don't be a bully.\" James retorted back at me with a smug smile on his face, nudging me in the ribs. Seth smirked, taking a drag of his joint, \"I don't know, Blake. He's always hating on Los Angeles. I don't think he likes it here. I also think it's fuckin' awkward for him to be around us. I mean, we all live in Los Angeles and he lives in bumfuck.\" \"He lives in Montreal.\" I pointed out, raising my eyebrows knowingly at him. \"Exactly. He lives in the middle of fucking nowhere so we never see him.\" Seth commented, pointing his joint at me, as if to prove the point, \"He hates LA.\" I shrugged, \"He seemed fine when we had to stay here for Tropic Thunder . Maybe he doesn't feel included in our group. Jonah's right about that one. Try to reach out to him, huh? Maybe not be so clingy and buddy-buddy with this dickhead over here.\" I jerked my thumb to James. \"Hey!\" He said, laughing, grabbing me by the waist and holding me against him so I was slumped against him, and said to me, \"Look who's trying to be the mom of the group.\" \"I'd agree that Blake's the mom of our group.\" Jonah piped up, his expression completely serious, \"Totally agree. I mean, you've sobered me up more times than I can count and you've told everyone to fuck off when people were shitting on me for the weight thing.\" \"I'd second that,\" Craig chimed in, \"The drunk, weed-smokin' mom of the group.\" I looked up at James as I lay slumped on his lap, his arm wrapped around my waist, and reached up and grabbed the joint out of his mouth and took a long inhale. I blew it out in his face. He coughed, laughing. \"Oh yeah, the mom. No question.\" Seth added sarcastically, \"And you are the designated driver for when we're drunk. And you tell us what to do. And you boss us around.\" \"Only sometimes!\" I said, sitting up against James, \"And only if you're about to do something stupid. Someone needs to be the mom of this group. You guys are lucky I've taken on such a difficult, trying task.\" I said, over-dramatically putting the back of my hand to my forehead to show my distress. \"You're a fucking drama queen.\" Seth said, laughing. Just as he said that, Jay came stumbling out of the crowd of party-goers, looking as awkward as ever, walking to the edge of the couch to talk to me. His hair was in disarray as always, with a crooked frown on his face. He looked very out-of-place, anxious, and tired. He looked like he'd rather throw himself in front of a bus than be here at this party. \"What's up, Jay?\" I asked, \"Where have you been?\" \"Mingling,\" He said, \"At least, attempting to...hey, Blake? Y'know where I could get a pack of cigarettes around here?\" Despite Jay's obvious presence, the guys apparently appeared to ignore it and keep smoking. I looked at them and rolled my eyes. I sat up from James's lap and leaned over the back edge of the couch, and turned back to Jay with a whip of my head. \"Yeah! There's a drug store about a block away. You want me to come with?\" I asked, looking at him with guilt. I felt bad. He came all the way from Montreal to a city he didn't even like to be with Seth, and Seth was rolling a doobie on James Franco's coffee table. \"Would you?\" He asked, his eyebrows arched, as if it was a inconvenience to accompany him to the drug store. \"You know it. I want to grab some vodka, too, because this idiot doesn't have any in his fridge.\" I said jokingly, untangling myself and climbing off of James. James inhaled deeply from his joint, then looked at me, \"Where are you going? I have vodka in the fridge, didn't you check?\" \"Drug store. I'm getting vodka, Jay's getting a pack of cigarettes.\" I said, \"I did check. You have a half a bottle of peppermint Smirnoff. That stuff's gross.\" James grinned at me. I gave him a knowing look, arched my eyebrows and with a sigh, asked mockingly, \"You want anything, Harry Osborn?\" James smirked at me, \"Get me a Milky Way.\" \"Of course.\" I said, with a smile and eye roll. That food was his obsession. I looked to Seth, \"You coming?\" Jay couldn't see, but I urged Seth with my eyes to come. Jay was his guest, he should be spending time with him. \"Give me a this much time! This much of my joint.\" Seth said, holding up the doobie. \"No. Let's go.\" I said. \"Okay, okay, let me get my coat.\" Seth said, handing his joint to Jonah. \"Shit, my cardigan's upstairs.\" I muttered. James shrugged off his grandma-looking cardigan and threw it at me, \"Here.\" \"Thanks, douche-bag.\" I smiled at him, shrugging on the over-sized men's wool cardigan. \"You're welcome, bitch.\" He said, smirking back at me, then turning back to smoke with the boys. Seth grabbed his coat and shrugged it on. We walked out the door and down the street to the drug store. There I was, walking the streets of Los Angeles with Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel while wearing James Franco's oversized men's grandma cardigan. I need girl friends. Once we got to the drug store, I retreated to the back of the store to grab a small bottle of Smirnoff. I went over to Seth, who was rummaging through different stuff while Jay got his cigarettes. \"Do you think he hates it here?\" Seth asked in a low voice. \"A little.\" I said, arching my eyebrows at him, trying not to make Seth feel like shit, \"Just try to include him a little bit more, you know?\" \"Yeah, I just wish he'd try, too.?\" Seth said. Before I could say anything more, Seth and I turned to hear the old woman at the counter yelling at a father and his daughter for asking to use the bathroom. Jay walked over with his pack of cigarettes and Seth looked at the two of us, then me. He handed me the bottle of water. \"The cashier lady seems really mean and evil, and you know that I have anxiety about that kind of stuff...so will you buy it for me?\" Seth asked. I smirked at him, \"Seth, you're thirty-one years old and you can't even pay for a bottle of water because of some bitchy cashier?\" \"This is why you're the mom of our group. This is one of your duties as group mother.\" Seth pointed out with a grin. I gave him a look and sighed, was about to say something, when there was the loudest, most massive shaking of the ground I'd ever heard. I screamed as the entire store shook violently, as if someone had picked up the store and shaken it. Everyone began screaming. There were loud, thunderous noises erupting outside, and cars began crashing into each other. Blueish-white beams suddenly burst through the sky, and beamed on a few of the people in the store. They all stared up into the beam and were suddenly lifted up, rapidly, through them. I screamed again and the store shook once more, sending Seth and Jay to the ground, and I fell on top of them. \"What the fuck is going on?\" Seth shouted as the store continued to shake, like an ever-lasting earthquake. I curled into him and Jay as a display rack fell on top of us. \" I don't know !\" Jay shouted back. \"What the hell was with the beams? Was that aliens ?\" I shrieked in fear, huddling inside James's oversized cardigan. Before we could say anything else, the violent shaking stopped. The three of us lay on the floor of the connivence store in shock, staring at each other. I got my bearings and I pulled myself up, and helped up Seth and Jay. \"Shit,\" I said, looking outside to the windows to the Los Angeles summer night. The sky was an orangish-black color. Cars were getting in accidents everywhere, with car alarms going off everywhere. People were screaming in the streets, running around like animals. Lights were flashing, the clouds were disturbingly dark, and the Hollywood hills looked like they were on fire. Jay and Seth stood on either side of me. We turned when we heard the old woman at the cash register shout at us, \" What the fuck !\" We turned to see a huge chunk of ceiling fall on her, blood splattering everywhere on all the walls around the store. I screamed, disgusted and disturbed, jumping into the boys. \"What the fuck !\" Jay shouted, clutching onto Seth and I. \"Shit, shit, shit, shit!\" Seth screamed. \"We gotta go,\" I urged panicedly, grabbing the boys and beginning to run out of the drug store and into the turbulent, chaotic streets of Los Angeles. \"We've got to get back to Franco's house.\" Reviews would be fantastic! I wish there was a category for this story, but for now it's in Misc. Movies. So yes, please review. That's the only way I'll know if I should update. Thank you![Chapter 3] III Seth, Jay and I sprinted to James's house. And when I mean sprinted, I mean that we ran harder than I have ever ran in my entire life. On the way there, we dodged cars, people running amok in the streets, fire, and the ground splitting open at certain points. I screamed, running across James's front lawn with Jay and Seth in tow. The house looked undisturbed, and as I yanked the front door open and threw myself inside with Seth and Jay toppling onto me, the party halted. James sat in the bubble chair by the couch, and stared at us with alarm as we tumbled through his door. He'd been in mid-conversation, talking to a guest about the massive Freaks and Geeks painting he'd done, which featured Seth, James and myself holding hands with our names Seth Rogen, James Franco & Blake Reid obnoxiously painted above it. Every party-goer stopped partying, and the music came to a halt. I slammed the door behind me, huffing and puffing, pressing my back against it. All eyes of the three-hundred something party guests were staring at me. \"What the hell are you guys doing? What's going on?\" James asked, looking at Jay, Seth and I like we were out of our minds. \"There's been an earthquake!\" Seth exclaimed, looking to James then the party-goers, \"Everyone, there's been an earthquake!\" \"What the fuck are you talking about, man?\" Jonah asked, arching his eyebrows at us. \" Everyone listen up !\" I shouted. Everyone stared at me with dumbstruck faces, eyes wide and drinks in hand. I cleared my throat, \"There's been a massive earthquake, or we're under attack or something !\" \"Blake, chill . What are you talking about?\" James said, getting up and looking at me like I had three heads, putting a hand on my shoulder cautiously, \"We didn't hear anything. The house didn't shake, we didn't hear any screaming. Nothing's going on. Relax. You're pale and you look more terrified than you did when we went to go see Evil Dead . \" Oh, that was bad. I remembered that, when he took me a few months ago as a date to the Evil Dead premiere I almost threw up on him. \"Because it's terrifying! You don't understand. It looks like the fucking apocalypse out there!\" I told him desperately. He rolled his eyes. \"Don't roll your eyes at me, Franco. I mean it.\" I hissed at him, \"We've got to do something. It's fucking insane out there.\" \"That's bullshit. We didn't hear anything.\" He retorted, \"There's nothing.\" \"We went to the drug store and beams came down from the sky. And they beamed people up! It's madness out there!\" Jay shrieked, backing me up. \"Man, this shit is going down.\" Seth reassured breathlessly. Before I could say anything, there was a blood-curdling, loud noise from outside, and the entire house shook. James looked at me with wide eyes, and everyone began sprinting outside, panicked. James tried to stop them, as did Seth and I, but we gave up and chased after everyone, residing on James's front lawn. I stood beside James, Seth, Jay, Jonah and Craig, with all the party guests behind us. We stared up in awe as we watched the Hollywood hills go up in flames. The sky was a hazy, dark orange color, and the clouds were threatening and scarily dark. Cars on the streets were crashing into each other or into trees and telephone poles; there was chaos everywhere. It truly looked like the end of the world. I turned to look at James, narrowing my eyes at him, and imitated him in a dumb male voice, \" Nothing's going on, Blake. Chill.\" He glared back at me, giving me a mocking look, \"Ha, ha. Very funny.\" Before either of us could argue further, Michael Cera pushed from the back of party-goers through to the front of all of us, his back to the street. He stumbled like the idiot he was, coked up out of his mind, fumbling around in his pockets, and then shouting at the huge crowd of party-goers. \"Which one of you bitches stole my phone?\" He shouted, slurring his words. No one answered, they just stared at him with annoyance. He laughed, then snorted, and began fumbling in his pockets again aimlessly, \"One of you assholes stole my phone and I fucking know it.\" He turned to me, laughing, \"Blake, you slut ! You stole my phone. You sassy little whore, stealing my stuff...\" I glared at him, \"I didn't steal your phone! You're fucked up, Michael. It's probably in your pocket...\" There was a sudden crack, and while Michael was rambling, the ground beneath him was crumbling and cracking, creeping to the lamppost that was by the sidewalk behind him. We all shouted at him to move, but while he was in his coked-up state, he didn't listen; the ground cracked beneath the lamppost and it came crashing down with a spine-tingling creak. It impaled Michael from the back, going right through his chest. Blood spurted out of the wound. Everyone screamed; I jumped into James and Seth, screaming. I thought I was going to be sick; it was disgusting. Michael stared at us, \"Is it bad?\" I gagged, absolutely horrified. Everyone was screaming, panicking and yelling. With another sickening creak, the earth rumbled and raised the streetlight up, taking Michael up with it. We all stared up as Michael, while impaled on the streetlight, reached into his pocket and pulled out a bloodly iPhone. \"I found it.\" He exclaimed. Everyone screamed again as the ground opened up and swallowed the streetlight and Michael, plummeting deep into the depths of the Earth. The ground opened wider and wider, creating a massive sinkhole; everyone backed up and backed up, but many were too late. Mindy, Rihanna, Aziz, and much more were sucked in, falling into the massive pit of fire. I stared in awe at it, completely shocked, when I felt someone grabbing my arm. \"Blake, let's go! Get your ass in the house!\" I didn't even register who it was, I was in such shock as I watched the hole grow wider. I stared at the ground as the crack in the Earth came closer to me. \"Blake, Christ! Stop being an idiot and come on !\" I felt two arms wrap around my waist and haul me up and over someone's shoulder. Before I knew it, I was hoisted up and hanging off James Franco's shoulder, with him racing to the house. I stared in awe at the view of absolute chaos unfold in front of me. Almost every party guest had fallen into the sinkhole; multiple celebrities and friends, Michael Cera...everyone. I bobbed up and down as James ran with me over his shoulder, and I saw Jay gripping on to the edge of the inside of the sinkhole. We made eye contact and my eyes grew wide to see one of my closest friends about to fall into the hole. \" Jay !\" I screeched, the pitch of my voice so high-pitched and desperate that it almost made James drop me. I reached my arms out to him, \"Jay!\" James got to the front door, opened it, and sprinted inside. Once we were in, he let me down off his shoulder. Craig and Jonah were there, the only surviving ones besides James and myself. I gasped and headed back for the front door; James stopped me, blocking me from the door. \"Move.\" I barked at him. \"Are you insane?\" He snapped back at me, \"I just saved your life. You can't go out there. You'll fall into that fucking sinkhole or whatever the hell it is. In case you haven't noticed, it just swallowed half of our friends and half of Hollywood !\" He did save my life. That's a weird thing to think. James Franco saved my life. \"Okay, I know, I know. I'm aware . Jay is in there! He was hanging on for dear life, I need to go help him!\" I exclaimed, \"Now move .\" I tried to pushed past him. I was almost at the door, but he grabbed me by my arm and dragged me back into him, encaging me against him with an arm around my chest to prevent me from getting out of his arms and to the door. He rolled his eyes, \"There is no way I'm letting you out there. You'll fall into that thing.\" \"You don't get it. I need to help him. No, I won't fall in, either. I need to help Jay!\" I hissed at him as he held me, \"James, let me go .\" \"Fuck Jason.\" He said, \"He'll be fine, but if you go out there you'll fall in. You're staying inside, goddamn it!\" \"It's Jay! His name is Jay! How hard is that to seriously remember? James, if you don't let me go and take your arms off of me, I will make 127 Hours a reality and cut your arm off.\" I said, wiggling out of his grasp. \"Even in the face of all hell breaking loose, you still manage to be pretty fucking sassy.\" James commented. Before we could argue further, Seth and Jay came barreling into the house, practically stumbling onto each other in sheer terror and panic. I sighed a sigh of relief, and James released me, then turned to me and gestured to Jay, \"I told you he was okay!\" \"What the fuck is even happening ?\" Seth shouted. \"How am I supposed to know?\" James asked, \"I thought you guys were making all this shit up.\" \"Serves you right not believing us.\" I said to him, narrowing my eyes at him. He stuck his tongue out at me in response. \"Okay, before you all start bitchin' at each other and start another infamous Franco/Reid fight, turn on the news. I want to know what the fuck's going on. Craig advised, beckoning to the couch. \"Yeah, turn on the TV. We need to see what's happening.\" Jonah chirped. James grabbed the remote from the coffee table, pressed a button, and the TV came up from the floor. I looked up at him, \"Seriously?\" He grinned at me with the wide, crooked grin he always flashed me that literally made my knees feel weak. I felt like any other girl that fangirled over him when he did that. \"Showoff.\" I smirked, watching as the TV settled in its' spot and James turned it on. I jumped lazily on the couch, squished between Seth and Jonah. James stared at the TV, standing off to the side, as the newscaster on TV spoke. I snuggled in, terrified and disturbed at what I'd seen outside; between seeing Michael Cera being impaled, Paul Rudd step on and squish a girl's head under his foot, or see almost every celebrity I know get swallowed by a huge pit, \"disturbed\" was putting it lightly. I felt disgusted and sick. I re-wrapped myself up in James's cardigan, snuggling in and watching the TV with panic in my eyes. I raked a hand through my hair in stress, my eyes not leaving the screen. \"...Government has asked everyone to stay inside their homes and be safe...\" was all we heard and saw of the newscaster, when the testing screen came up. No more news. Shit. Seth sighed, and looked at me. So did James, Craig, Jonah and Jay. James looked at me panicedly, \"What are we going to do?\" I was terrified. I had no idea what was going to happen or what was evening happening now. But I straightened up, pulled up the sleeves of James's grandma cardigan, and cleared my throat. I looked at my best friends, \"What are we going to do? What any sensible apocalypse survivors would do...See what there is to eat.\" Only I would get stuck during the apocalypse in a house with my idiotic friends. And now, being the only girl and proclaimed \"mom\" of our group, I knew I was going to have to restore some sanity to the boys. Right? Guys, I cannot thank you enough for the amount of support this story is getting. I truly, truly appreciate it. Your reviews inspire me to keep writing. I hope you liked this chapter. Please review, especially if you think I should keep going! Thank you![Chapter 4] IV I tied my hair up, throwing it up in a messy bun, strands of hair falling around my face. I glared at the boys, standing at the front of the countertop island in the middle of the kitchen in between James and Jay. After we'd watched the news, we'd boarded up almost the whole house to prevent anything from coming in. We were all tired. I huffed, and cracked my knuckles. The guys looked at me and Seth expectantly. \"Okay, okay. We're going to have not a ton of food supplies, you guys, so this is going to have to last. Got it?\" I said, and everyone nodded. \"Seth, what have we got?\" Seth sighed. \"Well, we've got...twelve bottles of water, fifty-six beers, two vodkas—one of which is half a bottle of James's gross peppermint kind—four whiskeys, six bottles of wine, tequila, Nutella, a hunk of cheese, three steaks, a Milky Way, the Maxim mag that Blake posed in, half ounce of Sour Diesel, a box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, half gram of Grand Master Kush, one ounce of Shrooms, fifteen pills of ecstasy, a porno magazine, a metal bat, and the camera used in the movie 27 Hours .\" \" 127 Hours .\" James corrected. Seth scribbled it down on the notebook he had. \"Why, why, why is the Maxim I was in included in this?\" I asked groaned, picking up the magazine and flipping to the page I was on. I re-wrapped James's grandma cardigan around me insecurely. \"James, seriously, why do you have this?\" \"'Cause you look like a raging slut in it.\" Jonah laughed, and I shot him a glare. \"It is pretty funny how they screwed you over.\" Jay admitted, \"I gotta say. And your rack is blatantly in the reader's face.\" I turned and glared at him. Jay put his hands up in defense, \"Not that I'm complaining.\" \"Shut up, you guys.\" I mumbled. \"If I'm really the group's mother, you guys are pretty shitty kids.\" James grinned and winked at me. Posing for Maxim was the worst thing I'd probably ever done. I had a normal body type, not unbelievably model skinny, but I was in decent shape. Still, I was self-consious about myself sometimes. Maxim had offered me a photo shoot to promote one of my movies, and I'd taken the offer. And now it lay in the clutches if these idiots. I was partially naked in the picture, lower region was covered and my breasts were shown. Probably not the classiest thing I'd ever done. The worst, though, was that Maxim had said that they were going to write the article about how I was a rising actress in Hollywood. That sounded fantastic, seeing as I was only really in comedies and occasionally had a few guest spots in Danny's show Eastbound and Down and a few episodes on season three of True Blood. So I agreed to let them write the article. Turns out that Maxim only told me part of what they were going to write. Sure, the article talked about my acting, but basically the article as a whole talked about my dealings with Jams Franco and the controversy that the lap dance video had sparked. I remember when I had been walking down Hollywood Boulevard and I'd picked up a copy off a kiosk. My mouth had dropped, and my face turned bright red with embarrassment when I read the title of the article. It had the topless picture of me with the title scrawled across it. It read: BLAKE REID'S BLURRED LINES After James Franco tried to domesticate her, she's proved that man is not her maker. Inside the life of the 'hottest bitch in this place': the only girl in the tight inner circle of the stars of Freaks and Geeks. Besides the topless picture of me, small pictures of stills from the video were also shown in the article. Maxim had played up the video and made it as a hook so that readers would think it was sexy and read it. I remember turning bright red, driving faster than I should've to Seth's house, throwing open the door with the magazine in hand. Before I could even scream and shout about how embarrassed and angry I was about the spread, I discovered Seth, Jonah, Craig and James, rolling around on the floor cracking up in Seth's apartment, the Maxim clutched in Seth's hand. \"They make you sound like a fucking prostitute!\" Seth laughed his ugly laugh, clutching his stomach, \"And they make Franco sound like your pimp!\" I had looked at James, who laid down on the floor and looked up at me from upside down, \"Blake, that is the best article I've ever read. I wish we did the photo shoot together.\" I rolled my eyes and walked over to him, slapping his stomach and laying beside him, \"I didn't tell them to write that shit. I cannot believe they embarrassed me like this...\" \"Relax,\" James had soothed, wrapping an arm around me and bringing him close as we laid on Seth's carpet, rubbing my shoulder comfortingly. \"You're too high strung about this whole thing. It's hilarious. Don't sweat it, Blake.\" I smirked a little and nodded, resting my head in the crook of his neck. While James and I fought a lot, there were moments where we got along better than anyone. After the guys made fun of me a little more for being duped by Maxim, they made me feel better by watching stupid comedy movies, eating two pizzas and smoking more pot than I've ever smoked. It was a good night. I snapped back to reality. \"You're a pig.\" I laughed, and punched him in the arm. \"Oh, and we also have a functioning revolver from the movie Flyboys .\" Seth added. James smiled with pride, looking lovingly at the revolver and picking it up in the air, \"Ah, old faithful.\" \"Jesus Christ!\" Jay said, startled, ducking down. \"Look, it's real! It's genuine. I kept this from the movie. It's an actual revolver!\" James exclaimed, swinging the gun around all too carelessly. \"Yeah, that's great. We know.\" Seth said, occasionally ducking down as James waved around the gun. \"James, put that fucking thing down before you shoot one of us,\" I said, my hands gripped on the granite countertop, ocassionally ducking down whenever James waved the gun in our direction. \"Blake's right, man. You gotta put that thing down, you're makin' me real uncomfortable.\" Craig said, putting his hands up. \"Look, it's loaded, see?\" James said, showing off the bullets packed up in the side of the gun, then he closed it and admired it, \"I always keep my props.\" Jay grabbed me by the shoulders and ducked down with me, the two of us huddling behind the counter as James waved the gun in our direction again. Like whack-a-mole, everyone around the table was ducking down at different times, yelling at James to stop it. \"I can handle it, I can totally handle it.\" James scoffed, looking at us all like we were idiots, \"Man up, you guys. That means you too, Blake.\" I peered over the counter up at him, narrowing my eyes. \"Guys, relax! He knows what he's doing, he knows what he's doing. I like it! I like this bit. Let me see.\" Jonah laughed, signaling James to give him the revolver. James carelessly threw the revolver to Jonah, causing Craig, Seth, Jay and me to cringe and shout at James at how stupid it was for him to do that. \"James, Christ !\" I snapped, throwing my hands up at him, \"Who the hell throws a gun at someone?\" Jonah grinned, looking at the gun. He pointed it to all of us individually, \"Bang. Bang, bang, bang.\" We all rolled our eyes, getting down and re-doing the cycle of playing whack-a-mole and popping up and down, trying to avoid Jonah, who was pointing the gun and cracking up. \"Bang, bang, bang! You're dead!\" Jonah said, laughing, throwing his hand back sassily and putting on a very girlish voice, \"Bang, bang!\" \"Pow, pow, pow!\" Jonah cackled, pointing the gun to all of us. \"Guys, stop fucking with the gun!\" Seth snapped. \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\" Jonah said, then jokingly put the gun to his head, \"I think I'm just gonna kill myself.\" He put on a puppy-dog pout, looking at all of us as we shouted at him to stop. \"Jonah, stop being stupid and stop fucking around!\" I warned him. Jonah began fake crying, putting the tip of the revolver in his mouth. We screamed at him to stop, James reaching for the gun, yelling at him to give it back. \"Okay, okay. Take a chill pill, you guys. I'm just tryin' to have some fun.\" Jonah grumbled, handing James the revolver. We all glared at him. \"Look, just because a bunch of our friends fell into a hole outside doesn't mean we can't have some fun. Right?\" Jonah asked, shrugging, \"We're a bunch of best friends. It'll be like one big sleepover!\" I looked at Jay, who looked disgusted to be called one of our best friends. He grimaced. \"Can I have the Milky Way?\" Craig asked. \"No way.\" James said instantly in response, \"That's my special food. I had Blake go out and get it for me specifically so I could eat it after the party.\" Jay looked at him funny, \"That's really weird.\" James looked back at Jay defensively, \"No, it isn't. It's my special food. I like it.\" \"I bought it with my own money, so I think I should have the rights to eat it.\" I chirped, biting my lip. \"No, not happening! You bought it for me .\" James said, arching his eyebrows at me and giving me a sassy look. I stuck my tongue out at him. \"Okay, I'm gonna be honest and say that I'm gonna be disappointed if I don't get at least a bite of that Milky Way.\" Jonah commented. \"No one's eating it. Not yet.\" I said, putting my hands out in front of me to get them to shut up, \"Right now we really need to go to bed. It's late. We should really all get some rest. We've seen and been through a lot today. Let's get to bed and clear our heads, okay? Find somewhere to bunk and sleep tight, weenies. See you in the morning. Be safe and try not to kill each other.\" I glared at Jonah when I said the last sentence. The boys nodded in agreement. They began to head to the living room and other parts of the house. I turned and looked at James, \"I call the bedroom. Your bed is so comfortable.\" I remembered I'd slept there a few times after I'd gotten so drunk I couldn't drive home, so I'd stayed the night at James's. it was much more comfortable than the bathtub, where I'd slept there with Seth and Danny when we'd gotten really drunk and really high after the Pineapple Express premiere. And when I say slept, I mean we actually spent the night sleeping in James's bathtub and bathroom. I mean that I slept on Danny's stomach while Seth's feet were in my face and the two of them snored. \"My bed all to yourself? No! That's my bed!\" He said, but he was too late. I already had grinned and taken off up the stairs to his bedroom. \"Oh, no fucking way , Blake!\" He shouted after me, choking on his laughter, taking a sharp turn and running up the ultra-modern stairs after me. He was on my tail in seconds as I sprinted up the top of the stairs. \"No fucking up there! We're trying to sleep, you sluts!\" Seth called up from downstairs as I sprinted down the hallway, to the last bedroom to the left, James's bedroom. I was laughing so hard it hurt my ribs as I struggled to open James's bedroom door. I looked to my side to see him printing down the hallway after me. I go the door open and burst into the bedroom. James ran in after me, tackling me and the two of us toppled onto his massive bed. I yelped as he tackled me. We were cracking up and he restrained me in his clutch. \"You can sleep in here with me as long as you don't steel all the covers.\" James said, \"Promise?\" \"I'm not making any promises.\" I laughed. James squeezed tighter, \"We'll stay this way all night if you have that attitude.\" \"Alright!\" I shouted, cracking up, \"As long as you promise not to put your feet in my face.\" I grinned at him. He laughed, \"Fine.\" After a few minutes of the two of us brushing our teeth—the two of us brushing teeth side by side in the mirror made us look like a married couple—and of me taking a shower, I went into James's bedroom to find him in bed, arms behind his head, sitting up in bed. I was wrapped in a towel, my blond hair dripping on the floor as I walked to the end of the bed, and I hit his foot. \"Clothes?\" He asked, his eyebrows arched in question. \"Yes please.\" I replied, smiling. James got up out of bed, going to his massive dresser and pulling out a pair of his dark blue Lacoste boxers and a white V-neck short-sleeve shirt. He shrugged and smiled that crooked, wide grin that made me internally fangirl, \"This okay?\" \"Perfect.\" I smirked at him, taking the clothes and moving to the bathroom. He jumped onto the bed, flopping back down. James's bathroom had no door, just a doorway, so I turned around and dropped my towel. I didn't really care if he saw me naked, we'd hooked up three times before—albeit us being drunk two out of the three times—so he knew what I looked like when I was naked. Still, I stayed turned around and put on my clothes. I hung the towel up and squeezed my hair of excess water. I ran onto the bed and flopped down beside him, squishing the pillow so it would be comfortable. I laid beside James, and he grabbed his sleep eye mask from his bedside table, strapping it on. \"You're the biggest diva I know, Sleeping Beauty.\" I teased, yawning, curling up on my side. James did the same, so now the two of our fronts were facing each other. James stuck out his tongue and lifted the eye mask, grinning at me, \"I could say the same thing about you.\" He snapped his eye mask back on. \"Ha, ha. Very funny.\" I said, and my eyes widened when he reached out and brought me into him. I didn't object, and I curled myself back up on my side, cuddling into his chest. I smiled to myself, glad he couldn't see my cheeks redden and my smile widen. He rolled over and shut off the light, then rolled back over to me. He draped an arm around me, across the left side of my body and I shut my eyes. There was nothing more I wanted to do in this moment than tell him that I truly did have feelings so him, and I have since I was eighteen. But I didn't say anything. Not now. \"Night, bitch.\" He murmured into my hair. I could hear the smile in his voice. \"Night, douche-bag.\"I said in response, smiling. The sound of his steady breathing put me to sleep instantly. I woke up around two-forty five in the morning. It was dark outside, but the sky still had a reddish tinge of fire. I stirred in bed, but James was still fast asleep with his arm draped around me and that dumb sleeping mask on his face. I hadn't kept my promise and I had most of the covers on my side. I got up, carefully and gently sneaking out of James's clutches so i wouldn't wake him up. When I got up to splash my face with water I'd given him the covers back. While I splashed my face, I heard voices downstairs. All the guys were talking. I couldn't sleep, so I figured I'd go down there for a little while to see what they were up to. I tip-toed across James's bedroom floor and to the door, shutting it so he didn't wake up. Being trapped inside James Franco's house with a bunch of my idiotic friends, who were fighting over Milky Ways and waving prop guns at each other? This was insanity. Guys, I cannot thank you all enough for the absolutely amazing reviews you are leaving me. I'm so glad you guys like Blake and her relationship with James! I really thought no one was going to read or review this story, but you guys proved me wrong. Thank you, thank you, thank you so much for your continued support and love for this story. Sorry it took so long to get this chapter out! I hope you all like it! Please review if you like it! Thank you![Chapter 5] V \"What are you freakazoids doing ?\" I tip-toed downstairs to find Jay, Seth, Jonah, and Craig crammed into the bed in the floor in the downstairs living room. They all looked up at me. \"Blake! Come snuggle in.\" Jonah said, squished between Jay and Seth. \"C'mere, ho.\" Jay said, \"Come join the misery.\" I laughed, making my way over to the simpletons I call my friends. I took up residence lying at their feet, staring up at the ceiling. \"Stop being such a little wuss, Jay.\" I said, looking up at him. \"It's the apocalypse, Blake. I know it.\" Jay sighed, \"I can't believe this is happening. Of all fucking places I'm going to die, it's Los Angeles. Fuck me .\" I felt fear racing through me, but I sat up to look at the boys, \"The apocalypse?\" \"You know, like in the Bible,\" Jay explained. We spent at least an hour discussing the possibility that this was the apocalypse, the people we'd lost, and how the hell this all even happened. And, it took us at least twenty minutes for all of us to get situated in our sleeping arrangements. Seth, Jay and Jonah struggled on how they were going to sleep without spooning and having their dicks sticking into each other's butts. \"You guys, we need to go to bed,\" I said, \"So shut up and sleep.\" \"Goodnight, boys.\" Jonah said, kissing Jay and Seth on the top of their heads. He leaned over and kissed me on the temple. \"Goodnight, sweet Blake.\" Jonah said. \"'Night, ya'll.\" Craig said. Jay just groaned in misery. \"Goodnight, freaks.\" I laughed, and shut my eyes to sleep. \" GUYS! GUYS, WAKE UP! DANNY'S ALIVE !\" I woke up to James's frantic yelling. During the night we had all tossed and turned, with Craig's arm draped across Seth's face and my face in Jay's crotch, the rest of my body sprawled across the boys. \" BLAKE! SETH! JAY! CRAIG! JONAH! HE'S EATING ALL THE FUCKING FOOD !\" The four of us sprang up out of bed, fumbling and falling while trying to get up. James wore a tank top and shorts, his brown hair a mess, and with a toothbrush in hands. His mouth was dribbling toothpaste, and some was dripping down his chin. \"Oh my God! Danny, come on , man!\" I yelled, as the guys and I ran to him. There, sitting at the lone table chuck-filled with food, was Danny McBride. We all circled him, yelling at him because of wasting the food. I threw my hands up in the air, exasperated. \"You've got to be fucking kidding me.\" I said, \"Danny, that's literally all the food we have left! You asshole !\" Danny frowned at me, arching his eyebrows and narrowing his eyes at me, \"Nice to see you too, Blake. Calm your perky titties. Jesus. I made this wonderful breakfast for all of you. It was an act of kindness.\" Danny shoved a pop tart in his mouth. \"Stop eating!\" Seth snapped. Jay whined, \"It's all we have left!\" \"Everybody needs to chill the fuck out. I'm sure the Green Goblin can fuckin' afford some more bacon.\" Danny replied, pointing his fork at James. I stifled a laugh; I loved giving James shit about starring in the Spiderman movies. It was a passion of mine. \"That's supposed to last us until we get rescued!\" Craig said, gesturing to all the food. Danny looked at all of us suspiciously, then broke out into a sly smile. \"Wait a second. I know what you guys did. Ya'll dropped acid, didn't you? Blake, what'd you do, get that sweet acid you got for us from Alaska last year for my birthday? Remember that shit?\" Danny laughed, \"Mhm. That's exactly what happened. Craig, you don't have any pants on. Got fucking wild. You probably danced and sweated all over the place.\" I shut my eyes, annoyed, trying not to remember the Alaskan acid trip we'd embarked on last year for Danny's birthday. It was a gift I'd given to him, and we'd ended up all tripping. The night ended with Jonah making out with a cactus (resulting in lots of cuts on his mouth), James fingering me, Seth almost getting hit by a car, Craig dancing ass-naked on the roof, and me sucking on Danny's toes. I rubbed my temples in irritation. God, I needed some girl friends. He looked at James. \"You got a little bit of white shit all on your mouth, Franco. You probably spent the whole fuckin' night sucking on Blake's clit. And fuckin' Jonah over here probably jerked off and watched you two go at it.\" James and I looked at each other, and I swear my cheeks were burning red. I felt flushed. I loved Danny to death (I'd worked with him on a lot of things (like Tropic Thunder and Eastbound and Down ), but his bluntness and crudeness was always a wonder to me. We were bad, but he was a whole other level than us. I had grown used to his language and behavior over the years. \"And Jay, I didn't even know you were in town. Good to see ya.\" Danny finished. \"Danny! We're not on acid!\" Seth and I shouted at him in unison. \"We didn't suck each other's anything! \" Seth added. \"James Franco didn't eat Blake Reid's pussy last night? Now I know ya'll are trippin'. What'd you guys do, blare Blurred Lines and have anal instead?\" Danny scoffed and laughed, pointing to James and I, \"'Cause that's somethin' I wouldn't doubt.\" I smirked at James and he smirked back, but we rolled our eyes at Danny. \"I don't hear you fuckers denying it, so I'll assume that I'm right.\" Danny said, shrugging. \"Shut the fuck up, McBride. Do you really not know what happened last night?\" I said, looking at him with arched eyebrows and an annoyed expression. \"Daniel, you may want to stay seated for a second.\" Jonah said gently. \"A lot of messed up stuff happened. There were a lot of fatalities.\" \"Oh, really? You're putting your serious voice on, Jonah?\" Danny scoffed, \"Tell me about these fatalities.\" \"Dude, Michael Cera's dead, Segal is dead, Krumholtz is dead.\" Craig listed off our friends' names. Danny started laughing, \"Michael Cera's gone, that's not such a loss is it? Ha, ha! Michael Cera's dead!\" \"Come on, Danny. Jesus , that's horrible.\" I said, punching him in the arm, \"You dick. It was gross, he got impaled by a telephone pole and then swallowed by a sinkhole.\" \"That's not funny.\" James muttered. \"Seth, that was a better performance than you've given in your last six movies, where the hell was that in Green Hornet? Jonah, you're fuckin' suckin' balls. You're an Academy Award-nominated person. You need to be fuckin' selling' that shit, dude! Fatalities .\" Danny said, imitating Jonah's use of the word, \"There were a lot of fatalities.\" We all sighed and glared at Danny, getting real tired of his shit. I remembered what James had told me the night before, that he was getting sick of Danny and all of Danny's antics. Like I said, I loved Danny to death, but he had a tendency to be a bit overwhelming and conniving at times. \"And Blake. That was a lovely performance. Almost as golden as your performance in last season of Eastbound and Down . Almost as golden as that sex scene we had together. I'm proud of you, you 'lil bitch. You should win a motherfucking Emmy for that one.\" Danny commented. I smacked my hand to my face with exasperation, \"Oh, my God. Does it look like we're fucking joking?\"I exploded, and Danny popped another piece of bacon in his mouth. Mid-chew, Craig caught him by the jaw and made him spit out the bacon, bits of it flying across the room. Yum, chewed up bacon spewing at me at high speed curtsey of Danny McBride. \"Ugh, gross.\" I said, sweeping bacon crumbs off my shirt, \"Fuck you, Danny.\" \"Yuck. You've got some in your hair. Fucking gnarly.\" James said, sweeping it out of my hair. I smiled at him and laughed, \"Thanks, douche-bag.\" \"No problem, bitch.\" James said, smacking my behind playfully. All of us stopped and swirled around when we heard a loud pounding at the door. My breathing quickened, and all of us stared at the door that had a million planks of wood stacked up and hammered up against it. The barricade against the door didn't seem to hold, through, when some random guy's head popped through and made a hole in the door. I quivered behind Seth and James. James raised his handgun to the stranger. \"Please, please, you've got to let me in!\" The man shrieked, pleading. \"Just…hang on a second.\" James said, unsure, glaring at the man at the door. We all looked at him, confused, as he turned to look at us. James cleared his throat, \"Guys, I know this is going to sound really weird, but I don't think we should let him in.\" \"What?\" Jay asked. \"Why not?\" I exclaimed, giving James an urgent glance. \"Yeah, why not?\" The man in the door shouted, \"I can hear you, by the way.\" \"I'm sorry, man. We just don't know you.\" James said with a sympathetic expression on his face, \"You could be a looter, or a…a rapist. Or a titty fucker. I'm sorry. I've got a woman here to think about.\" He gestured to me, and I smiled a little at James's consideration of me, \"As well as the rest of us. I'm sorry, man.\" When James mentioned titty fucker, Seth held his man-boobs protectively. I stifled a laugh at him. James turned back to look at us, \"You guys, we just boarded this whole house up to keep things and people out, and now the first guy comes along and you wanna just let him right the hell in? How do we know we can trust this guy?\" \"That's true.\" Jay and I said in unison. \"I want to live! Things have gone crazy out here!\" The man screeched, trying to pry his way through the little hole in the door. Danny condescendingly mimicked the man's desperate pleas for help, and laughed. He jerked his thumb to the door, \"This guy sucks.\" \"What if he's a rapist?\" James squeaked. \"So what if he's a rapist? He can't rape all of us!\" Jonah pointed out. \"Let's address the elephant in the room. We all know he'd only rape Blake. She's the woman here.\" Danny said, \"And she's our woman, so don't let that motherfucker in!\" \"What am I, your sex slave? You misogynistic bastard.\" I said, sticking my tongue out at Danny. Danny used that powerful, aggressive tone he always did. \"No, but you're our property since we're all men and you're the only woman. We claim you and we've gotta look after you. Now shut up , woman.\" James nodded, \"Danny's right.\" Jay, Jonah, Craig and Seth agreed in unison. I rolled my eyes. \"I'm not a rapist! I won't touch any of you! Now please, let me in!\" The man shouted at us. \"Are you gonna titty fuck any of us?\" Seth said anxiously, squeezing his own man-boobs. \"If you want me to titty fuck you, I will! But please let me in!\" The man pleaded. Jay took my arm and said, \"Please, Blake. Back me up here when I say we can't just leave the poor guy out there to die!\" I nodded, at him. \"You're right, you're right.\" I turned to James, \"James, c'mon. Let him in.\" \"Absolutely not!\" James said, \"I'm not risking any of our safety.\" \"Let's take a vote. I vote fuck all of you.\" Danny snapped, \"Enough talk. I'm letting him in!\" Everyone shouted at Danny not to do it, but before we could even reach the man in the doorway, we heard a loud roar from outside, pure terror appear on the man's face, and his head was sliced right off. It spurted blood, crimson red liquid spurting across the floor. The man's decapitated head rolled across the floor, landing right at my feet, the dead man's eyes staring up at me. Danny stood next to me, and looked down in fear. All the boys were silent. \"THIS IS REAL! THIS IS FUCKIN' REAL!\" Danny screamed, sending us all into a deranged panic. I screamed, jumping back into Seth. Danny kicked the bloody, decapitated head to James, who screamed. It eventually became a bloody soccer match, all of us kicking the head to each other in terror and panic, none of us wanting to come in contact with it. But of course, I slipped on the blood-stained floor mid-kick, drenching myself in the man's blood. James hoisted me back up, but in the process, fell alongside me, causing the two of us to fall and pile on top of each other. \"I'm gonna puke.\" I said, staring down at the stained clothes once I got back up. Jonah told everyone to shut up. \"Guys! This man was alive a few minutes ago! We can't play soccer with his head !\" Jonah exclaimed, trying to talk sense into us. He went to pick up the head, but the blood made it slip from his hands. Everyone gagged, yelling to pick up the head. Craig, shaking, covered it with a woolen blanket from James's couch. Seth took one of James's metal sculptures and pushed it to the corner of the room. \"There's blood all over my floor!\" James whined. I turned and glared at him, \"Oh, and that's the biggest problem we have right now, isn't it?\" James narrowed his eyes at me, \"Don't get sassy with me, Blake.\" I was about to say something when Seth said, \"Oh, no no no. No fighting. Not between you two. We don't need another Franco/Reid feud. Not right now. Keep the sass to yourselves.\" James stuck his tongue out at me, and I did the same. \"Now, someone look through the hole in the door.\" Seth added. Craig quivered in fear, \"No way, man! The last guy to put his head through there got his head chopped off!\" \"Whatever's out there, might still be up there.\" Jay proposed, and James nodded. James beckoned for us to follow him. We all followed suit, running up after James up the stairs. We stopped at a large window that would've normally looked out all over the beautiful city of Los Angeles. I stood between Seth and James, staring at what I saw in complete and utter horror. \"Is that a giant hole? What the fuck is this?\" Danny screeched. Los Angeles was no longer a city. It was a mess of dust, desert, fire, and post-apocolyptic land. I'd never seen anything so horrific in my life. I gasped, my eyes watering in disbelief. \"It's the apocalypse.\" I said, and all the boys stared at me in fear. I felt James's hand interlocking with mine, and he squeezed my hand. We knew we were in deep shit. Really deep shit. Please review! :)[Chapter 6] VI \"Hi. This is Blake Reid and James Franco, and we're sitting in James Franco's house, in his library. We've been stuck here for twenty-four hours. Yes, me . I have been stuck with these weenies for a whole day. In a fortress. As the only woman. Save me. Help me .\" \"You're such a drama queen. We aren't that bad. You fucking love us. Especially me.\" I looked away from the video camera and turned to look at James, who sat next to me. I stuck my tongue out at him. I was wearing one of James's baggy flannels with a Freaks and Geeks tank top underneath it and my high-waisted denim shorts. My clothes that James had lent be before were soaked in the guy's blood, the one who got his head chopped off. James grinned at me. The two of us were doing the video confessional together, to vent about everyone in the house. I smirked back at him, and laughed. \"Oh yes, Green Goblin. You've found me out. I confess my love to you, Harry Osborn.\" I rolled my eyes. James laughed and slung an arm around me, kissing my left temple. I think I turned fifty shades of red, my face burning red hot. I internally swooned. Luckily, he turned back to look at the video camera. \"Danny McBride is here.\" James sighed heavily, \"I mean, um, I didn't even invite him to my party.\" \"Which you should've.\" I muttered quietly. James rolled his eyes, \"He came anyway and passed out in my bathtub. Again. I mean, I gotta say, it's typical fucking McBride, you know? Like, we've been feeling really weird about him lately...\" \"It's regular Danny behavior,\" I protested to the camera, chiming in, the two of us talking to the camera as if it was going to talk back. \"He's a natural fuckwad. I don't really think he's getting that bad. It was worse when we filmed Pineapple Express with him, remember?\" Danny McBride was a psychopath during the filming of that movie. The only sane thing he did was break up one of the many fights between James and I. The other things were insane. He messed up every line, causing about an hour blooper reel, he was wasted at the premiere and tried to jump on my back for a piggyback ride, and stuck two blunts up his nose while filming because he was so high. He also ate all the food for the cast and crew, and shit in James's trailer. Then mine. And he peed in Craig's. \"Seriously, Blake? You don't think he's being a douche?\" James asked. I pondered the thought, tapping my chin. I sighed, \"Okay, maybe a little. A little bit.\" James turned back to the camera, \"I've been feeling really weird about him lately…and I don't know if I want to be friends with him. I mean, he fucking showed up at my party and now we're stuck here with him in disaster lockdown.\" I looked at James, jerking my thumb at him. \"And I'm the drama queen? Look who's princess of the party over here.\" \"He slept in my bathtub and got pee all over my floor,\" James pointed out, \"I think I have a reason to be a drama queen.\" Before I could respond, there was a knock on the door. James and I swirled around in unison, only to see Danny standing in the doorway. I felt my heart drop into my stomach. How long had he been standing there? Did he know what James and I were talking about? Did he hear us shit-talk him? \"Whaddup?\" James grinned at him, as if he hadn't been gossiping. \"Hey, what's goin' on?\" Danny asked suspiciously, but with a friendly tone to his voice, \"What are you doin'? What is this?\" \"Oh, it's just, uh…\" James began. \"A video confessional.\" I finished for him. Danny nodded and walked away, walking back down the hall. James looked at me knowingly, and we waited until he was down the hall and out of earshot. \"I think he heard us.\" I commented. James swirled back around and snapped at the camera, \"Fuck that dude.\" I sat at the dinner table with my rag-tag group of imbeciles...I mean friends . I sat in between James and Jay, Danny and Seth across from me. Jonah sat beside Seth and Craig sat beside Jay. James and Seth were discussing tsunamis and earthquakes, Jay was reading through the Bible, and I was draining my glass of red wine without hesitation. \"I mean, for all we know the fuckin' Lakers could have just one and that's why this shit is happening.\" Danny said. \"Or Justin Beiber's topped the iTunes top 100.\" I muttered, putting my wine glass down, \"And that's why hell is breaking loose.\" \"In Franco's front yard, a sinkhole. Whenever I see one of those on TV, a bunch of South Americans getting sucked into the ground.\" Seth explained. \"Sinkhole de Mayo.\" Jonah proposed. \"Oh, Jesus.\" I rolled my eyes, \"I think you guys are way off base here.\" \"It's not earthquakes, or wildfires, it's not sinkholes, I think I know what it is.\" Jay propositioned, \"I think it's the apocalypse.\" There was silence at the dinner table. I arched an eyebrow, and exchanged looks with James, Seth and Danny, then I looked to Jay. Danny laughed, and there were murmurs among the boys of disbelief. Jay held up a leather-bound Bible. Jay cleared his throat, \"I'm serious boys, and Blake. It's all in here. In the book of Revelations. Just hear me out, and you tell me what I'm describing doesn't sound like what's going on right now.\" Jay opened the Bible and began reading, \"'And the sky shall open up, and the light of the Lord shall shine down and those of good heart shall be brought into my kingdom of Heaven'. That's the Rapture, those are the gigantic beams of light. 'And there will be a great mountain burning in fire'. I mean, the Hollywood Hills are literally engulfed in flames as we sit here right now!\" \"The Hollywood Hills ain't no mountain. It's a hill.\" Craig pointed out. \"I'm going to have to agree on that one with Craig,\" I commented, \"I live there and it's just a hill, Jay.\" \"Can I just finish? 'And out of the pit rose a great red dragon having seven heads was released'.\" Jay read, and showed us a picture of a demon-looking creature. \"I know that dude,\" Craig said, \"He's from Where The Wild Things Are .\" James sat there, unimpressed, his arms crossed. I knew that look. It was the signature Franco brothers' you annoy me look. I'd seen it on both Dave and James before. I remembered James gave me that look back when we first met while we were filming Freaks and Geeks . I'd from then on, whenever we were mad at each other, I'd mimic him and give him the same look. He'd give me the look back, then our anger would break and we'd be good again. \"That's a load of bullshit,\" James said icily, his voice laced with venom. \"It's not bullshit!\" Jay replied. James narrowed his eyes, \"You wanna know something else, Jay? If this is the end of the world and all the good people died, what you're saying is that Seth, Jonah Craig, Danny, me and Blake are a bunch of assholes.\" James was in that strict, fatherly-like zone he got into when someone really pissed him off. I'd only seen him this ticked when he found out I tried prescription pills and alcohol together one night at a party at my house after the Tropic Thunder premiere in Los Angeles. My house isn't that big, and there were about fifty people in there, blaring Miley Cyrus songs. I remembered that night in bits, but I remembered how terrible I felt, the throbbing headache, and the nausea. To my homegirls here with the big butt Shakin' it like we're in a strip club Remember only God can judge ya, f orget the haters, 'cause somebody loves ya And everyone in line in the bathroom, t rying to get a line in the bathroom We all so turned up here, g etting turned up, yeah, yeah... So la da di da di, w e like to party Dancing with Molly, d oing whatever we want... James had gotten to my house late and was the only sober one there. He'd gotten pissed at Seth and Danny for not keeping a sharper eye out and taking care of me, but they were so hosed that they couldn't see straight, so I didn't blame them. I remembered the look on his face when he found me sitting on the couch with a few friends and other celebrities, empty Smirnoff bottles all around me and a half-empty prescription pill bottle on my lap. Pure worry and anger flashed across his face. James had gotten really upset with me, and told everyone that the party was over and he'd kicked everyone out of my house. Me, being the drunken mess that I was, had yelled at him, slurring my speech, for 'ruining the party', and then I'd puked my brains out. James and I and the boys did a lot of stuff, but James knew that mixing pills and alcohol was unacceptable. Thank God he was there, because he helped me puke up the pills I'd taken that could've been the end of me. In spite of me and James's banter and teasing, I would always remain grateful to him for being there to hold my hair back while I puked, and put me to bed and stayed awake all night with me to make sure I didn't puke in my sleep. James really did look out for me, even when I didn't realize it. I looked over at him and gave him a small smile. God, I was crazy about that freak. \"I'm straight up lovable, son.\" Craig defended himself. \"And if this really is the Apocalypse,\" James said, glaring at Jay with something I sensed was contempt, \"You're here too. So, that just means you're as shitty as the rest of us. Doesn't feel too good, does it?\" We went to bed early, tempers running a bit high in the Franco Fortress. I was jumping into bed with James when I heard Danny shout down the hall from his bathtub bedroom, \"Hey guys, I'm going to bed now. No one come in here and barge in on me.\" \"Sweet. Danny's beating the meat in the bathroom.\" I mumbled, gathering myself in the warm covers like a cinnamon roll. I sighed, comfortable and exhausted. James rolled around and got comfortable, draping an arm around me. \"Do you really think this is the end?\" I asked him in the dark, \"You know, the Apocalypse?\" \"No,\" James replied, but he didn't sound sure at all, \"No, it isn't. You're not worrying about that, are you?\" \" A little,\" I admitted. \"Don't. Relax, and sleep. Jay doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about, Blake.\" James said, \"Don't worry about it, okay?\" He kissed the top of my head. My heart throbbed in my chest, and I could feel the familiar burning of a blush on my cheeks. I was grateful it was dark in the bedroom so he couldn't see my face turning redder than a fucking strawberry. \"Okay.\" I exhaled, leaning my head on James's shoulder. \"Night.\" He said, pulling me close so we were spooning. I held onto his arm that held me for comfort. As he drifted off to sleep, I stayed awake, staring up in the dark at the ceiling. I thought about what Jay had said, and reevaluated things in my life. Why wasn't I more successful? Why was I so awkward? Why was this happening? Most importantly, when was I going to grow the ovaries to tell James how I felt? I had been crushing hardcore on the guy for years, since I was a freshman in high school. I loved him, and I loved teasing him. After all this time, I was still into him and I loved it. But what if he didn't feel the same? James was always taking out other girls, but they never lasted. He and I went on dates to movie premieres or the Golden Globes and Oscars together, but I assumed they were platonic. Seth knew how I felt, even if I wouldn't admit it. All the boys did. Seth loved to rub it in, too, and Danny was his partner-in-crime. I remembered Seth saying that James and I were like \"Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio; everyone wants them to be together, and they know it too, but they're too fucking stupid to act on it and another person comes in and fucks it up\". Seth's words, not mine. Danny thought I was a pussy for not acting on it. He'd roll his eyes and say in his aggressive tone, \"He clearly likes you. You clearly like him. So what the fuck is so hard about this? Oh, yeah. You're too much of a pussy to act on it. And so is Franco. You guys banged three times already, that should be clear that you guys want to be together. Christ, you two are complicated little shits. You bother me.\" Danny was right. The two out of three times that James and I had had sex we were drunk; once in one of the Kodak Theater's bathroom stalls during the Golden Globes, another at one of Seth's house parties. We'd snuck away and into the bathroom, this time fucking in the shower. The only sober time we'd ever had sex was when I went to visit Mindy Kaling on the set of The Mindy Project , and James was co-starring for a few episodes. It was a few days after my little overdose close-call, and James was still ticked off at me for doing it. I had taken him to the side and was trying to talk to him to apologize. He hugged me and told me he was only worried, that he really cared about me and that I'd scared him. Our talk ended surprisingly in a kiss, which then had emerged into sex against the wall in a secluded part of the studio so no one could see. He was playing a doctor on The Mindy Project , so I didn't mind. I remembered when I'd told Seth, he'd punched me in the arm and did his ugly Seth laugh. He gasped, \"You guys fucked? Sober ? Finally! It sounds like scene from a porno. I gotta tell Danny and Jonah. And Craig. Oh My God, they're gonna die .\" \"I didn't even…it just happened !\" I squeaked, my face red, \"I think it was the pent-up tension and anger between us, I…I don't know.\" \" Hah ! You guys had angry sex. It was like a porno.\" Seth chortled, throwing back his head with a laugh as he dialed the boys' numbers to tell them. From then on, James and I had gotten much, much closer. I think both of us were afraid to confront each other about the sexual relationship we had, in fear the other wouldn't feel the same. So we were platonic, really close friends with benefits, if that makes sense. James and I were a fucked up coupling, and I loved it. Now all I had to do was get through the apocalypse with this rag-tag group that I called my friends. Nevertheless, telling James how I really felt about him seemed a lot more scarier than the Apocalypse. Reviews would be lovely! :)[Chapter 7] VII \"Only a little bit. Just cut a little,\" I recommended, Jay and I watching Craig cut a slice of cheese. \"We've got to make it last.\" Danny licked his finger and wiped it on half the cheese block, \"That's me. That's mine.\" All of us groaned, yelling at him about how disgusting it was. \"C'mon, Danny! That's gnarly.\" I scrunched my nose in disgust. James came up from behind me and put his chin on my shoulder. \"Hey, Blake. Can I talk to you for a minute?\" I looked at him. He was all scruffy with his beanie on. He looked like a sexy hobo. I nodded, and he took me by the hand. He led me over to the corner of the room, a secretive look on his face. He smirked at me, and handed me four saltines. He whispered, \"For my main bitch, from your favorite douche-bag.\" I smiled up at him. \"Where'd you get these?\" I asked, and he shrugged. \"Hide 'em,\" He said, and I put them in my back pocket. Once I did, he hugged me, bringing me close to him, \"'Cause we're a team.\" He brought me to face him, pressing my forehead to his, \"Freaks forever, Spring Breakers for life.\" I smiled at him. \"Always.\" \"That's my girl.\" James said, smirking and walking past me, playfully smacking my behind. I rolled my eyes as I watched him walk away. Starring in Spring Breakers last year with James was the weirdest experience I'd ever had. He'd been cast first, then recommended me for the role of one of the girls that he starred alongside. I was hesitant when I read the script, knowing I had to do full frontal nudity. But James assured me that it wouldn't be that bad, that he'd seen me ass-naked countless times, and that he'd do the movie only if I did. I had been pushed by all the boys to do it, them telling me that it was going to be a psycho movie that everyone was going to be talking about. I agreed. Being in movies with James was always a chaotic roller coaster ride of teasing, banter, sass, hilarity, and craziness. I loved it. And even though I was in it with James, I had shit on and teased him for weeks because of how he looked in that movie. I remembered how hard I'd laughed when he'd shown me the costume on set. He'd walked out of his trailer, decked out in fake tattoos, a Hawaiian shirt, cornrows, and grillz. I laughed so hard that I'd felt like my guts were going to burst out of my stomach. Even on the DVD of Spring Breakers , the blooper reel consisted of, almost all the way through, me cracking up mid-scene because I couldn't take James seriously. When we had a kissing scene, I laughed and it turned into a blooper. The funniest was a sex scene we had in a pool, in which James and I had to be completely bare naked. I couldn't take his accent and grillz seriously, so the sex scene must've had at least fifteen bloopers of me cracking up, howling in laughter, as James and I stood there in the pool, nude. \"Don't you dare say a word.\" He had muttered, when he stepped out of his trailer for the first time, \"I look like a fucking psychopath.\" \"You look like a such an idiot,\" I had choked out in between fits of uproarious laughter. \"And you're playing a slut who wants my dick,\" He had playfully mused with a smug smirk. \"So who's the idiot now?\" I had pranced over to him and hugged him, \"We both are.\" Seth grinned at me. \"Let's do all the drugs.\" \"Eh…I don't really want to.\" Jay said, drinking his can of Arizona Ice Tea. Seth's wild eyes stared at Jay, and he smirked, \"You should've thought about that before you drank a can full of ecstasy.\" Jay spit it out, and yelped, \" What ?\" I burst out laughing at Jay's reaction, already fucked up beyond belief. Within minutes, all of us were fucked up beyond belief. Colors surged through our brains, hallucinations took their toll. I was seeing stars, seeing the universe, and trying to forget about the Apocalypse. Seth and I blew bubbles into each others mouth. James and Seth fought each other with the tall stand-up lamps, swinging them around like swords. James and I danced like absolute freaks to Blurred Lines , causing the rest of the guys to holler and laugh in approval as James and I grinded and dirty-danced onto each other. Danny and I pondered the meaning of life, meanwhile tripping so hard that we saw each others' faces as a single giant mouth. We put Jay in a chair and lifted him up like he was in a Bar Mitzvah. Jonah, Craig and I linked arms and kicked our legs high up in the air. Jay gave me a piggyback ride around the house. James and I wrestled each other and the guys stood around us, cheering and betting on who would win the wrestling match. FROM THE CREATORS OF SUPERBAD & PINEAPPLE EXPRESS I fly like paper, get high like planes if you catch me at the border I've got visas in my name Seth and I, decked out in our Pineapple Express costumes, watched as James, who was dressed as Saul, did the worm on the floor. We were reenacting James's plot for the Pineapple Express 2 trailer out of boredom. COMES THE MOST ANTICIPATED SEQUAL IN HUMAN HISTORY James and I lit Seth's seven-pointed joint, afterwards James and I taking puffs. The three of us coughed heavily. \"Should we call Red, get more weed?\" Seth asked the two of us. James, as Saul, shook his head, \"I dunno, man. That guy's gone crazy.\" The scene cut to James, Seth, Danny and I sitting at a table, a suitcase on the table. \"Good thing I have a lot of fucking weed for you guys.\" Danny's Red said. \"I hooked you guys up. Now I need you guys to assassinate [dramatic closeup] Woody Harrelson.\" Jonah's face was shown, wearing a cowboy hat and a dumb expression on his face. \"If pot's legalized, my business will suffer. If my business suffers, then I suffer. So much suffering, all because of that in-bred, Hep-C Woody Harrelson.\" Red said. \"I do what's right. Weed is for the people.\" Jonah said in a pretty good Woody Harrelson accent. Cut back to Red, Saul, Seth's Dale character, and my character, Saul's girlfriend, Riley. Pirate skulls and bones Sticks and stones and weed and bombs Running when we hit 'em Lethal poison for the system \"If you don't assassinate him,\" Red said, grabbing a fake gun and pointing to Saul and Dale, \"I'm gonna assassinate both of you.\" Red grabbed me and held me to him, putting the fake gun to my head, \"And your woman!\" The scene cut to a montage of chaotic and mischievous clips. Saul running away from Red, me in his arms. Craig's character, Matheson, trying to catch Dale and Saul, who tried to elude him. Red holding me at gunpoint. All I wanna do is (BANG BANG BANG BANG!) And (KKKAAAA CHING!) And take your money \"B.F.F.F.F. forever!\" Saul said to Dale. \"B.F.F.F.F.!\" Dale replied. A clip of Red dragging my character, who was screaming, \"Saul!\" down a hallway. Saul chasing after me, screaming, \" No ! Let her go! Riley, I love you more than weed!\" Another title card showed up: PINEAPPLE EXPRESS 2: BLOOD RED Me and the boys laid on the floor on bean bags, pillows and blankets, watching the fake Pineapple Express 2 trailer on James's TV as we smoked some weed. I laid between Danny and James, my head resting on James's stomach. He put the joint to my lips and I inhaled, laughing as we watched the trailer. The boys were laughing, too. Seth choked out that obnoxiously infamous laugh of his, \"We should make sequels to more of our movies.\" \"How about we not do Your Highness 2 ?\" James laughed. \"Blake, we're doing Tropic Thunder 2 ,\" Jay chuckled. \"You got it, Sandusky.\" I laughed, looking up at Jay and winking, referencing his character from that movie. \"You and Franco gotta do Spring Breakers 2 ,\" Craig said with a chortle. Danny coughed out a laugh, \"I agree. Show the people what they wanna see; more boobs, more weirdness, more of Franco giving head to a gun and eating Blake out and snorting cocaine off Blake's boobies. That's basically all the movie fuckin' was, man.\" \"What do you say, Blake? Grab that bikini, I'll grab my fuckin' Hawaiian shirt.\" James laughed goodheartedly, resting his hand on my head, running a hand through my hair as he took a puff. \"Do you still have your Alien costume?\" I laughed, turning around to face him. \"Your grillz and Hawaiian shirt? I'll cornrow your hair.\" Before James could reply, we heard a bashing at the door. We all scrambled up, forming a cluster in the middle of the room for defense. James took out his prop gun from Flyboys , and I ducked behind him and Danny, cowering in fear as the banging on the door became louder and louder and louder. Things we had used to build a barricade up against the front door came flying off onto the floor. An intruder was trying to get inside. We all screamed, clustered together like a bunch of two-year-olds. Someone stepped through the door and stood in front of us. It was none other than Emma Watson. \" Emma ?\" I gasped, arching my eyebrows in surprise. \"It's Emma!\" Jonah sighed in relief. The boys all relaxed, seeing that it was just her. \"Oh my God, you guys are alive!\" Emma said, an axe in her hand and a head to her forehead in relief. \"You're actually alive! Thank God.\" Emma told us the tale of her survival, how she hid in a drain pipe for days on end until she didn't hear humans anymore, only growling. Jay tried to ask her if there was any Rapture-like instances or clues, but she denied them. Emma believed it was the zombie invasion. I looked at Jay, who looked annoyed at the fact that no one seemed to believe his theory of the Rapture. I'd been friends with Emma for about a year now, having met her at one of my movie premieres. She was a nice girl, a great actress, and one of the few actresses in Hollywood that I could stand to be friends with. While the boys were making her something small to eat, I sat with her on James's couch. \"How's everything been? Besides the obvious, I mean?\" She said with a sad laugh, \"I mean, being in here with the boys?\" I smiled at her, shrugging. \"It's like babysitting sextuplets. They run around, yelling at each other, acting like five year olds, acting like maniacs and lunatics. But by the end of the day they're cute and quiet. I'm trying to keep my sanity, you know? But I love them. So, I guess it's okay. They keep me safe.\" Emma looked at me knowingly. \"How's James?\" I laughed, and sighed. \"We're always on each other's ass. But he's fine.\" Emma gave me a look. \"What?\" I asked. \"Oh, come off it. All of Hollywood knows you two are into each other,\" Emma said, \"It's so obvious. You need to go for him, Blake. He doesn't bite, and it won't kill you.\" I felt my cheeks redden, \"I…I know. I'm too terrified to.\" Emma shrugged, \"It's the end of the fucking world, Blake. It's now or never.\" James gave Emma our bedroom for the time being so she could rest. Seth, Jay, Craig, Jonah, Danny and I stood in the hallway as James shut the door to the bedroom. James gave us a funny look. \"What are you guys doing out here?\" He asked. Seth cracked his knuckles and sighed. \"Here's what I think we should do. She's British. She eats shitty food anyway. We should just give her the shitty food that we don't want.\" \"That's fucked up, Seth.\" I commented, giving him an are-you-kidding-me look. \"I for one am very excited. I myself am I massive Harry Potter fan.\" Danny said. All of us looked at him, staring at him blankly. \"What?\" James asked. \"I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. I fuckin' love Harry Potter . I can't wait 'til she fuckin' wakes up and ask her all kinds of amazing questions on how they made those motion pictures.\" Danny replied. \"Take it easy, Dumbledore.\" James snapped, and I laughed at his comment. He smirked at me. Danny gave a vengeful glare at James. \"Stop arguing, the two of you.\" I said, looking to James, then to Danny, \" Stop .\" \"Guys, listen. Listen.\" Jay called our attention, \"I think we need to address the elephant in the room.\" \"Whoa, Jay. Don't talk about Craig like that.\" Seth said. \"That's fucked up. I'm right here, man.\" Craig sighed. \"I'm not calling Craig an elephant! I wasn't referring to him . I'm referring to the issue that's on all of our minds.\" Jay said, \"You know, that we're not give off a vibe .\" \"What vibe?\" We all asked in unison. \"He's talking about us giving off a rapey vibe.\" Danny snorted. We all shushed them, \"What the fuck , man?\" \"Why are you putting that fucking shit in the mix?\" James said, disgusted. \"I didn't! He's the one who said it!\" Jay said, pointing at Danny. Danny shook his head at Jay, \"You're the one who said it. Nobody here was thinking about raping anyone.\" We all began quietly arguing, pinning blames to either Danny or Jay. Jonah shushed us. \"Guys, guys! Jay's not rapey. Jay wouldn't rape a fly.\" Jonah said, and Jay nodded. I stifled a laugh. \"Nobody here is going to rape anyone,\" James assured, \"But if anyone was to going to rape anyone, it would be Danny.\" I was seriously trying to hold back my laughter. Danny looked pissed off and insulted, \"What the fuck, Franco? Why do you think I would be the one who was going to rape somebody?\" \"I'm just tryin' to lay it out there,\" James concluded. \"If anyone's gonna rape someone, it's Jay.\" Danny barked at him, \"He looks like a police sketch of a fucking rapist.\" \" Stop fighting !\" I snapped at them, \"You sound like a bunch of fucking psychos. You're all giving me rape vibes now, Jesus. Cut it out, end this conversation. You guys are creeping me out.\" \"Good job, man. Now you're freaking out Blake,\" Danny taunted Jay, \"You fucking rapist.\" I glared at Danny, \"For the love of God, stop arguing . You guys have more sass than me when I'm on my period. Fucking hell.\" \"You're one to talk, McBride,\" James snapped at Danny, slinging an arm around my shoulders, \"You're the one sending rapey vibes to Blake.\" \"Look, the only reason why I brought this up is because Emma's a woman and we're all guys, and I didn't want her to feel intimidated. She's one girl, in a house with six men. I want her to feel comfortable and safe.\" Jay said, raising his hands in defense. I glanced over at him with annoyance and sarcasm in my voice, \"What am I, Jay? A man?\" \" No ! No, that's not what I mean, Blake. You know that. You're used to us, she's not .\" Jay replied, \"You're a part of this group, we'd protect and make you feel safe anyway. But Emma doesn't know that.\" \"What Jay means is that you're our woman anyway, you're Franco's girl, you're used to our fuckin' shenanigans, and you participate in them with us. So therefore you wouldn't feel threatened in the first place.\" Danny explained, \"And you know we'd keep you safe.\" I felt my cheeks burn red when he called me Franco's girl. I looked at James when Danny said that, and I caught the smile that spread across his lips. The rest of the boys nodded in agreement. \"And if anyone tried to rape you, I'd kill them.\" James said while clutching me tighter to his chest, and narrowing his eyes at Danny, \"You know I'd keep you safe.\" \"And I would help,\" Seth chimed in. \"Same here, you're like a little sister,\" Craig said. Jonah nodded, \"I would never let anyone hurt Blake.\" \"Sometimes I forget why I love you guys, and then you remind me.\" I said teasingly with a smile, accepting James's affectionate gesture, and hugging him back. \"Enough with the rape talk, okay?\" Jay said, but was cut off when the bedroom door was bashed open. Emma came out, wielding her axe. The boys all screamed and backed up, freaking the hell out. \"HEY! Back the fuck up!\" Emma snapped at them. I stared and watched, holding back laughter. The boys all asked her what was wrong, fumbling on their words in nervousness. \"What's wrong? I just heard you guys talking about which one of you was going to rape me and Blake!\" She shouted. \"No, no! That's not what we said!\" Seth assured her, the rest of the guys chiming in in agreement. Seth walked towards Emma, \"No, no. We were specifically talking about not raping you…ah! Motherfucker!\" Emma took the handle of her axe and smacked Seth right in the nose with it. We all screamed in surprise, and I rushed over to Seth to see if he was okay. Blood gushed out of my best friend's nose, crimson red liquid splattered all over his nose and hands. \"Fuck!\" He shouted, covering his nose with his hands, \"Blake, get me a tissue. Fuck, fuck, fuck!\" After Emma backed the boys downstairs by swinging the axe at them countless times, she demanded for all the alcohol in the house. I tried to explain to her what had happened. \"Emma, listen to me!\" I shouted, standing in front of the guys, who had clustered together in a group in fear, \"You heard wrong. No one's raping anyone. Don't rob them!\" \"I'm not fucking around!\" Emma shouted, \"I know what I fucking heard, Blake! They're going to rape us!\" \"I was standing right with them!\" I defended them, \"They were saying they weren't going to rape you, or me!\" \"I said, I know what I heard. It's not safe here!\" She replied. James frantically put all of alcohol in the green duffle bag used in Pineapple Express, and handed it to Emma. Emma axed down the door again, and she turned to me and the guys, who were still huddled in the corner in absolute fear. \"Shoot her!\" Jay shouted. \"I'm not going to fucking shoot Emma Watson!\" James shouted back. Emma looked at me, \"Look, Blake. You're my friend. That's why I'm going to make you an offer. Now's your chance to get out of here, Blake. You can come with me, or stay with your pack of fucking rapists. We'll be safe out there, much more than we are in here.\" I bit my lip, and looked back at the boys. There was no way in hell that I'd leave them. They were my nitwits, my losers, my rag-tag team of idiots who I'd grown up with, worked with, and loved. I'd gone through Pineapple Express, Freaks and Geeks, Eastbound and Down, Spring Breakers, Tropic Thunder , and many more movies with them. Partying hard, late nights, award shows, the good times, and the bad. Leaving them there was not an option. They watched out for me, were protecting me, and had given me and were responsible for some of the best years of my life. They were the only reason I was happy I was famous, that I'd met them. They looked at me, worry on their faces. \"Don't leave, Blake,\" Jonah peeped. Seth glared at me, \"You leave, and I'll kill you, Blake Reid.\" James broke off from their cluster, carefully approaching me because of Emma's axe. James took my hand in his. I looked up and him, and he looked at me, \"Freaks forever, Sprang Brake for life.\" He said the \"Spring Break\" in his character Alien's voice. I laughed, smiling at him. There was no way I could ever leave those guys. \"I can't leave them, Emma. I'm sorry.\" I said, \"I'm safe here, with them. They protect me.\" Emma shrugged, \"Suit yourself.\" She climbed through the door, and Emma Watson disappeared into the yellow fog that swallowed up and clouded the streets of Los Angeles. The guys broke up their cluster. Seth hugged me, thanking me for not leaving, as did Jonah and Craig. James put his chin on my shoulder as I looked outside into the fog. I sighed, and laughed. \"Hermione Granger just stole all of our shit.\" Reviews would be lovely! :) And very much appreciated! ","Summary":" So I saw \"This Is The End\".

I'm so excited. This idea came out of the blue, as many of my ideas have been lately, and I just wanted to really do it. This takes place during the second movie. I was just inspired by all the stories Papi told his pups so I decided to make one of my own for him to tell them. I own nothing. The movie and all its content belong to Disney. I don't own the cover image either. Enjoy the story! \"Alright my little puppies. All little Chihuahuas, time go to bed now,\" a light brown colored Chihuahua called out. His white chest was puffed out a bit to assert his dominance as the father to the five little puppies beginning to climb up into their bed. Two light brown, two black and white and one brown and white puppies crawled onto their pillows. \"Papi Jr. Lala. Rosa. Ali. Pep. Sleep well my little ones.\" Papi said before be turned to go. He was stopped though by the call of one of his youngest. \"Wait, daddy. Could you please tell us a story.\" Rosa asked. She had light brown fur and a light, oval-shaped marking on her forehead. Her sisters and brother also began asking for one. \"Yeah!\" \"Please daddy.\" \"We'll go to sleep right after.\" \"Just one story, daddy.\" The continued begging finally brought the older dog to his knees with a sigh. \"Alright, alright. Settle down,\" he said. Then he suddenly gained a grin on his face. \"I happen to know a wonderful story. A wonderful and true story too.\" \"Is it an action story, dad,\" asked his son. Papi Jr. had both of his father and mother's colors on him, brown and white. \"Does it have romance in it daddy,\" said another, Ali, whose fur was black and white. \"No. No kissy, goo-goo stuff, sis,\" he protested. \"Are adventures in it, daddy,\" asked Lala. She was light brown, just like her father. \"Tell us daddy. Please tell us.\" Pep begged, her tail wagging. She was black and white, just like her sister Ali. \"Whoa there, kids. First off, it is an action story, with romance and adventure in it as well. And I'll only tell you if you promise not to interrupt when I'm telling it. Deal?\" \"Deal,\" all five of the chorused back. He smiled and nodded. \"Alrighty then. Ahem, this is the true story of a dog, a mighty Chihuahua, who went on a fantastic journey, full of adventure, danger and friendship, all to save the one he loved. This, my puppies, is the story of the Big-Hearted Chihuahua.\" Years ago, there once lived a princess. Her fur was the color of pure snow, her eyes as black as the most beautiful black diamonds, her ears a perfect, pearly pink. Her beauty was well know throughout the land. She was surrounded by all that she could wish for. Jewels, dresses, three meals a day, spa days, mani-pedi's. Everything a dog could wish her. But there was still one thing that she did not have. Someone to love and share everything she had with him. \"Uh, dad.\" Papi Jr. interrupted. His dad sighed and looked at his son. \"Yes, what is it son?\" \"Um, is there going to be any kissing, yucky romance scenes in your story?\" Papi sighed and was about to answer, but Pep beat him to it. \"Of course silly. If there's a princess, then there has to a prince to save her and marry her so they live happily ever after,\" she replied. \"Eww. Dad, is that really going to happen in the story,\" Papi Jr. asked. \"Well, tell you what. I'll cancel out the kissy, yucky romance scenes, but only if you stay quiet like you promises. Got it?\" \"Got it, daddy.\" \"Alright then.\" There was also a strong Chihuahua, who everyday would wake up to see his princess, in all her splendor and glory. He was in love with her, but how could she love him? He was a worker, a gardener, working in the garden and field to make the outside look nice. How could he ever amount to the shimmering, lovely dog who he could only gaze on from afar? But he knew that deep under his dirt-covered fur was a big heart that beat in love for her. He knew that one day, one day he would prove himself to her and she would love him back. That day came sooner than expected, to his surprise. One day, as the princess was riding in her carriage, thieves came out and stole her away. The others tried to come after her, but it was too late. She was already gone. News of her kidnapping soon reached the castle. When it reached the strong, gardener Chihuahua, he was devastated. His one true love had been taken. A search party was immediately assembled, he eagerly joined them. He vowed that he would find his love and bring her home. \"And then what happened, daddy?\" Lala asked. \"I can't tell you if you don't keep your mouths such,\" he replied, giving a small glare at his puppies, who immediately quieted back down. Meanwhile, the thieves had taken the princess to the dark castle and locked her in the dungeon. While she was their, bemoaning her fate, she met someone. A valiant wolf with a mysterious past. He warned her of the dangers she was now in. All of a sudden then, she was taken out of her cage and was put before the keeper of the castle himself. The dark lord of the land. The grotesque, fearsome, Chupacabra. He wished to make the princess his queen, if she would only love him back. She outright refused him. The dark lord Chupacabra grew angry, so she had her stripped of most of her fineries and ordered her to death. Luckily for her, the valiant wolf swooped in last second and helped her escape. Now lost, afraid and confused in the new, strange place she was in, she asked the the wolf to help her get back. He agreed, but only until she could get safely home. The two managed to escape, but soon found themselves lost in a unknown land. On the way, the princess met to small-time thieves, not like the ones that had stolen her, but still very crafty. They managed to trick her into giving up her diamond-studded necklace, one of the last things that could tell her apart from anyone else. When the wolf came back, the two were long gone, but he was angry at the princess for lessening her chances of getting home quicker. For now, they would have to travel by foot, something the princess wasn't accustomed to, since she had been pampered all of her life. But still she longed for hope and agreed to let him escort her till they got there. They kept going, unaware that the Chupacabra was coming after them, determined to bring the princess back and make her his bride. The two travelers kept going until they made it to a magic train that would carry them across the endless desert and bring them home. The train neatly left without them but they managed to get on board before it could leave and not return for several days. Meanwhile, the group was still looking for the princess. On the way, the group enlisted the help of two street rats, formerly thrown into the same dungeon as the princess. He promised to help them out if they would help them find his love. They agreed and joined, though eventually on the way, they split of and went on to more happier lives, thanks to the journey. As for the princes and the wolf, mean men searched through the train and the two had to jump off to avoid being caught. Now lost in the desert, they kept walking on foot until they met a trio of the fiercest, angriest creatures either had ever seen beside Chupacabra himself, the mighty rock lions. \"Rock lions? Daddy, you're making that up,\" Ali said. The other puppies were giggling. \"I'm telling you, I am not. They were very real, ask the princess and she'll confirm it,\" Papi replied. His ears perked up at the sound of the grandfather clock striking nine down the hall, just outside the room. \"Whoa, it is way past your bedtime. I'm gonna have to postpone the story until tomorrow, \" he said and hopped the bed and started walking away, much to his puppies disappointment. \"No, daddy,\" Lala said. \"Please finish. We won't interrupt anymore, we promise,\" Pep begged. \"We want to hear the rest of the story. Does the wolf fight the rock lions? Does the princess get back?\" Papi Jr. asked. \"Does the big hearted chihuahua fight the Chupacabra and win the princess's heart and they live happily ever after?\" Rosa asked. \"Sorry puppies. You'll just have to wait till tomorrow to find out. Now goodnight.\" Papi replied and shut the door, but left a bit of it still open to let the hallway light in so the puppies could still see. The five replied \"goodnight\" and fell asleep, imagining how the story might finish tomorrow night. Decided to split it into two parts. Hope you enjoyed reading the first chapter. Just in case you didn't figure out who everyone was: princess=Chloe, gardener/worker=Papi, Chupacabra=El Diablo and the wolf=Delgado. Please review, tell me how you thought this went and I'll see you next time. Sincerely, v.t.7[Chapter 2] Part two, last chapter. Now you get to see how the story ends. Enjoy the chapter! \"Tell us the story daddy,\" Ali begged once the next night came. The other puppies practically bounded onto bed once they remembered that their dad would finish the story tonight. \"Yeah. Continue where you left off,\" Papi Jr. agreed. Papi Sr. got himself comfortable on the foot of the bed and cleared his throat. As I left off, the wolf and princess now faced a trio of ferocious rock lions. The wolf jumped before the princess and in front of the cats and barked and growled at them. The cats snarled and showed off their razor sharp fangs. It didn't look good for our heroes, but luckily fate was on their side. In an instant, a small dust storm came forward and when it cleared, there stood a pack of snarling, proud warriors. They began barking all at once and the rock lions ran away like the fraidy cats they were. The leader of the warriors told the two to come with him. His name was Montezuma, Monte for short, and the took the two to spend the night at the abandoned Aztec buildings where they lived. It was there where the princess realized her true, royal and mighty potential. Before they left the next day for home, Monte gave some advice to her and made her realize how much home and the people there meant to her. More than ever, she realized how special she was to be surrounded by all the finery and friends home, and even have someone who loved him there too. Soon they came back to civilization and it was there they found that the princess was being searched for far and wide by her friends and family back home. She was soon recognized by the guards surrounding the area and they sent word over to the search party to come pick her up. Unfortunately, that also meant that the Chupacabra knew where they were too. He ordered his finest warriors to come with him and recapture the princess, before she could be rescued. The search team was overjoyed to have found the location of their princess, the worker chihuahua most happy and joyous of all of them. He had hpped and prayed for her safe, well-being and was relieved to see his prayers had been answered. But as fate would have it, when the search party came to the place where the princess was, the chihuahua discovered that the dark lord and his forces had gotten top where they were too. And to their shock, the ground beneath their feet crumbled and the princess fell into the earth. Both forces raced into the hole, which they discovered was a lost, abandoned, Aztec temple. While both sides searched for her, the princess discovered ancient tunnels designed just for her breed and tried to hide from everyone. Yet just as she thought she might be safe, one of the Chupacabra's most fiercest warriors discovered her and alerted the dark lord. Before they could recapture her though, the brave, gardener chihuahua sprang into action. While he had the two distracted, the princess ran away out of reach of the danger, though she could still see all that was happening. Soon though, the Chupacabra had the brave chihuahua between a rock and a mouth full of sharp teeth. The princess looked down and saw that her true love was in trouble. She then felt a sudden power flowing through her, beating in her mighty heart and causing her to shake in pride. She closed her eyes and opened her mouth and declared, \"No mas!\" \"No more!\" The sheer protectiveness and dedication to her loyal warrior had unleashed a hidden power inside of her, so powerful the walls of the temple began to shake and many of the dark lord's warriors began to flee and the worker chihuahua was able to escape. Though just as the princess came down to embrace her love, the Chupacabra came back. Luckily for the couple, the valiant wolf came in a attacked him best he could, but it was not enough to defeat him. Just as the Chupacabra was about to finish him off, the brave princess leapt at him, enough to allow the wolf to get up and knock him down. Sadly, the dark lord threw the princess off and she was injured. As the brave hearted chihuahua and the wolf came to her side, the wolf realized he had escaped. The brave-hearted chihuahua came to her side, though she was not moving as he nuzzled her ear. The brave-hearted chihuahua begged her not to leave him, confessing all the things that he loved about her. To his happiness, the princess woke up and confessed her love for him too. While the warriors were defeated, the valiant wolf alerted had also brought the rest of the search party to them, who they promptly arrested. \"And then what happened, daddy?\" Rosa asked. Papi grinned. \"Well, so the search party took them home. The wolf joined the elite guard to serve and protect the royal family and the innocent, the Chupacabra was eventually found and turned into a pet by a lady who loved to dress him up in ribbons and lace and other pretty things and the princess and the brave-hearted chihuahua got married.\" Papi explained. \"And lived happily ever after?\" Ali asked. \"Uh yeah. Until they had five or a dozen so of little monkeys like you,\" he playfully responded. He started to tickle them with his nose and paws, eliciting giggles from his five children. The tickle fest continued for the next five minutes until the five of them declared mercy from the attack, to which Papi consented to. he let them go as they began to yawn and feel sleepy. As he tucked them back comfortably into bed, he asked them, \"So my little taquitos, did you enjoy the story?\" Five nods. \"Best story ever, daddy.\" Pep said. \"I loved it, daddy.\" Lala said. \"I liked the ending.\" Ali said. \"The battle scenes were best.\" Rosa said. \"That was a great story, dad. Thanks for telling it to us.\" Papi Jr. said. Papi smiled at them. \"You are most welcome, my little puppies. Goodnight, grety some rest., You have a big day tomorrow.\" Papi said as he left the room. \"Goodnight, daddy,\" came the five responses before they shut their eyes and fell asleep, dreaming of the big-hearted chihuahua, the princess, the wolf and the Chupacabra. \"I am here my love.\" Papi said to his wife as he entered his bedroom. She smiled as he came close and lay down next to her. \"The puppies are in bed and asleep, we can rest peacefully tonight.\" Chloe smiled. \"Perfect,\" she said as she lowered her head onto her pillow. Just as Papi was about to fall asleep though, he heard her say, \"That was a lovely version of the story how we fell in love, but I don't think Delgado would like it that you called him a wolf in your story,\" Chloe playfully said. He grinned and chuckled lightly to himself. \"Heh, yeah. But you have to admit, he did have the valiance and heart of one, and that was good enough for me to describe him like that in the story,\" he replied. Chloe smiled as her eyes began to flutter close. In just a minute, the two chihuahuas, the princess and the brave-hearted warrior, were peacefully asleep. The End. Hope you enjoyed reading this, I had fun making it. Please review and give me some feedback how I did, it's always appreciated. Thanks for checking my story out!

This idea came out of the blue, as many of my "},{"Movie":"Beverly Hills Chihuahua","Title":"Miracles","Author":"Lava Puppy","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4922215","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Miracles Disclaimer: I do not own Beverly Hills Chihuahua. I wouldn't ever want to have to train that many animals...ever. This counts for all the chapters in this story. \"Delgado!\" Chloe called. She was wandering around the garden behind the pool, looking for the German Shepherd. After a persistent (and rather embarrassing, if you were Delgado) barking period outside that temple, Rachel and Sam had taken Delgado with them back home, to be Chloe's 'body guard'. She spotted Papi and Rosetta a few feet away. After a couple months of grieving for losing Chloe to Delgado, Papi had fallen for Rachel's new Chihuahua (seems that chihuahua lovers run in the family!). Rosetta was laying under a lilac tree watching Papi play with their puppies. All seven of them. Six rambunctious boys and one little girl, the runt. \"Hey! Watch my cola(1) little cachorros(2)!\" he said, rolling back onto his stomach and standing, shaking them off like raindrops. \"Papa!\" Viola, the littlest, squeaked from his back, albeit muffled as she had a good hold on his collar with her teeth. \"Mi pequeño guerrero (3)!\" Papi laughed as she slid off. \"Papi, Don't get them too riled! It's their bedtime!\" Rosetta called. \"Of course, mi corazón(4),\" He said lovingly, before turning to the pups, \"You heard your mama. Bedtime!\" \"Papi, Rosetta!\" Chloe called quickly, before the pups settled down. She didn't want to disturb them too much. \"Aunt Chloe! Aunt Chloe!\" Seven pups immediately started bombarding her with questions. \"Where's Uncle Delgado?\" \"Why aren't you wearing booties?\" \"Tell Papa and Mama we don't need to sleep!\" \"Where's Uncle Delgado?\" Chloe laughed. They were so hyperactive. \"I was going to ask your parents. Rosetta, Papi, do you know where Delgado is?\" \"No, sorry Chloe. Did you check the pool area?\" Rosetta offered, as Papi started rounding the puppies into the white doghouse a few yards away that Viv had bought for the new canine-family, beaming (\"I'm a grandmother!\") \"Yes, he wasn't there.\" \"Sorry, Chloe. He hasn't been around the garden today.\" Papi said, using his nose to scoop one of the boys, Aleksander, into the plush pillow floored doghouse. \"Ok. Thank You anyway, guys. Goodnight puppies!\" She called, sleepy goodnights coming back. She smiled, turning away. Puppies were so cute. As she walked away, she couldn't help but think that Delgado and herself would never be able to have puppies of their own... She shook her head. She shouldn't think about a depressing topic right now. She had to find Delgado. \"Delgado?!\" She called, entering the house. \"Chloe?\" She heard Viv coming in the front door, and smelled her Chanel no. 5 as well as... \"Delgado!\" \"Hey, cariño (5).\" He bumped noses with her and she leaned against his leg. \"Where were you? You've been gone all day!\" She said, looking up at him. \"Sorry. I escorted Viv while she was shopping.\" \"Oh. I see.\" \"Chloe! Look what I bought for you!\" Viv beamed, leaning down and fastening a little silver tiara on her head. It had a dozen tiny diamonds sparkling on it, and a little elastic to keep it on her head. \"Oh!\" She twirled around a few times, smiling widely. \"It's beautiful!\" \"Yes you are, Bello(6).\" Delgado smirked at her blush. \"You're so adorable!\" Viv picked her up and rubbed noses with her. \"Thank You, Viv! I love it!\" Chloe said, licking her. \"Oh I love you too!\" Viv set her down. \"Now you two go play; be good!\" Viv laughed, going upstairs with her bags. Delgado licked Chloe's face so that her front legs left the ground. \"Hey! Delgado!\" Chloe laughed, before licking his leg. She smirked for a moment, before biting it as well. Not hard though. \"Chloe!\" he stepped back, eyes narrowed. \"Catch me!\" She laughed, running away. \"I'm a police dog! You won't get far!\" He raced after her, reaching her a minute later in the pool area. He grabbed her by the scruff of the neck and threw her in the pool. \"HEY!\" She squealed, surfacing. \"Hey is for horses, Princesa(7).\" He shot back. She rolled her eyes and swam to her attached island. \"troublemaker.\" \"Spoiled Princesa.\" \"Of course! I'm a Beverly Hills Chihuahua!\" \"So?\" \"So, I'm supposed to be spoiled. You're a Beverly Hills German Shepherd.\" \"Uh no. Mexican German Shepherd.\" Chloe rolled her eyes and he joined her on her island. He laid down under the umbrella and she curled up next to him. \"Urg you're wet.\" He grumbled, however did not move. \"Your own fault.\" She smiled as he moved her between his front paws, putting his head on her back. They were silent for a few minutes, just enjoying the sunset. \"...Delgado?\" She asked. \"Yeah kid?\" He asked sleepily. She rolled her eyes. He still called her kid. \"Have you thought about...puppies?\" She asked and felt him start. He obviously wasn't expecting that. \"Chloe...we can't. It would kill you, you know that. I can't risk that. Not ever.\" He said, 100% awake now. \"I know that...but, if we could, would you want them?\" She asked. She knew that they couldn't. \"Of course, Chloe. Why would you think otherwise, cariño?\" \"I don't.\" \"Then what brought this conversation up?\" \"...\" \"Chloe.\" \"Papi was playing with his puppies and I wondered if you felt like you were missing out.\" She admitted. Delgado sighed. \"Princesa...I have you. I am Feliz(8).\" \"Thank you, Delgado.\" \"You're welcome. Bedtime, Princesa?\" \"Please.\" He laughed and got up. \"After you.\" (1)Tail (2)puppies (3)My Little Warrior (4)My Heart (5)sweetheart (6)beautiful (7)Princess (8)Happy I hoped you enjoyed it!

When Delgado woke up in the morning, there was warm sunshine rays streaming into the windows onto the satin dog bed, his little white mate curled up against his stomach and he could hear Viv snoring on the other side of the room. He eased himself up carefully; avoiding waking Chloe. It worked. He padded over to the door and stuck his nose into the crack, opening the door enough for him to slip through. He jogged down the hall, then the stairs and entered the kitchen. Beside the pantry, in a little alcove, there were 9 bowls; 2 big silver ones with 'Delgado' printed on them in black; those were his food and water, then 2 smaller gold ones with 'Chloe' printed on them in slender cursive letter, those were Chloe's as she was uncomfortable eating from his big ones and hers were to small for him. There were two small silver ones, one printed with bronze letter 'Rosetta', the other 'Papi'. three other identical ones had 'Puppies' printed on two, and \"Rosetta and Papi' on the other one. Those were the puppies' food and water and their parent's water. All bowls lined the walls. He had his breakfast and went outside. He lay down in the sun beside the pool and put his head on his paws. Why had Chloe thought he thought he was missing out because their inability to have pups? Sure, he sometimes thought about their not possible puppies, but he loved Chloe. Puppy or no puppy, he was staying with her. Suddenly, he was tackled from behind. seven little bodies were all over him, nipping and growling cutely. \"Hey hey hey!\" he stood up and seven puppies fell off of him. \"Good morning Uncle Delgado!\" they sat in a half circle in front of him, on the edge of a pool. \"Hey niños(1). Where's your parents?\" \"Landscapin'.\" \"So what are you up to?\" \"Nothin'.\" \"Yeah. Right.\" \"Will you play with us Uncle Delgado?\" \"Yeah please!\" Seven voices pleaded. Delgado sighed. \"Fine.\" \"YAY!\" \"All of you close your eyes.\" They did as they were told and then... \"BOO!\" seven squeals, seven splashes, one laugh. \"Gotcha, niños.\" He said as they surfaced and started paddling around. \"Come in Uncle Delgado! Come on!\" Viola called, putting her paws on the edge. \"Please?\" she hitched on the puppy eyes only she and Chloe could do. 'Don't jump...Don't jump...Don't...'he jumped, 'what am I doing?!' he looked around under water and gently tugged one of the puppies under by his foot, letting him go quickly. \"Uncle Delgado!\" The puppy, Jose, squealed when he surfaced shortly after Delgado himself. \"Jose!\" He mocked, splashing some water at him with his nose. For the next hour or so Delgado played with the pups in the pool, losing track of time and pushing them under. Eventually they got tired and Delgado helped each of them onto the island. \"Tired already, chorros(2)?\" He laughed, laying down and letting them curl up beside him. He put his head on his paws, and Viola and curled up right beside his nose. He sneezed. \"Ew.\" Viola stated, and Delgado rolled his eyes. \"Well sorry, Princesa.\" She stuck her tongue out at him. \"Sleep already would you?\" He said, and she put her head down. \"'Night Uncle Delgado.\" \"Night Kid.\" A couple hours passed and none of the puppies woke up. Delgado didn't sleep, but watched the water over the edge of the island. If Viola rolled over, she would fall in. But she stayed curled into a tight ball. \"Kids? Pequeninos(3)?\" Papi and Rosetta came through the gates. \"Aye Chihuahua! Delgado got 'em!\" Papi laughed, and Delgado rolled his eyes. \"At least they don't smell like fertilizer.\" He said dryly. Papi shook his head. \"Hey Hombres(4) and mujer(5) wake up!\" He called, standing at the end of the island bridge. Seven pairs of eyes opened sleepily. \"Papa, Uncle Delgado pulled me under water...\" Jose yawned, stumbling to his feet and towards the bigger Chihuahua. \"Did he now? Well say thank you to Uncle Delgado for playing with you, niños.\" Rosetta instructed. Seven puppies who were trying to get to the other side of the bridge head of everyone else without falling in, stopped and smiled at Delgado. \"Gracias (6) Uncle Delgado!\" Delgado nodded. \"Don't mention it kids.\" Papi and Delgado sat next to each other and watched Rosetta count the pups before settling down on the grass a few feet away to bathe them. \"But Mama! I'm clean!\" Viola protested, trying to get away from her mother's grasp. Papi chuckled. \"She's a handful all by herself.\" He said, looking up at the bigger dog. \"How do you two do it? I was tired just swimming with them for an hour.\" Delgado said, sounding almost exasperated. \"Si(7), hombre, it gets pretty exhausting sometimes. But you know, laying there at night with Rosetta and just watching them sleep, It's all worth it. They're all worth it. Plus,\" He added slyly, \"They keep me old muscles moving. Impossible to get old with all that running around!\" Delgado snorted. He was surprised the landscaper could keep up, and completely baffled that Rosetta could keep them all under control, rarely with more than a polite sentence. \"Papi! We have a runner!\" Rosetta called, jerking her head in the direction that the firstborn puppy, Alejandro was running. \"Uh oh. Alejandro get back here!\" Papi took off, kicking up a small amount of dust behind him. Delgado shook his head, snorting. He went back into the house and into the living room. Viv was pacing around the room, phone on her head. \"Of course I can! Oh it will be so much fun! Maybe Delgado will finally let us trim his nails.\" She sent a sly smirk at the German shepherd. Delgado's eyes narrowed. \"Men don't go to the spa and get their nails done!\" He barked, and she laughed. \"Maybe not. But we'll go anyway. Goodness knows Delgado won't let Chloe or I leave without him!\" he could hear a squeaking on the other end of the line. \"For your own good.\" He told her, before laying down in front of the window. He could smell Chloe's faded perfume from yesterday before he could see her bed-fur coming down the stairs. \"Morning, cariño.\" He called to her and she went to him immediately. \"Morning, Delgado.\" She rubbed up against him briefly, smiling. He grinned back. \"You realize it's noon, right Princesa?\" He teased, and she rolled her eyes. \"I couldn't get any sleep with you hogging the bed all night!\" \"I'm a great deal bigger than you, kid. You don't need much space. Your clothes are another story, though.\" She snorted at the last comment. \"Morning, Viv.\" She turned to her faithful owner, who scooped her up. \"Who wants to go to the spa?\" She asked, obviously excited. Chloe squealed. \"YES!!\" her tail began going a million miles a minute. Delgado rolled his eyes. \"Women.\" He muttered. \"Oh Delgado, you big grump!\" Chloe smiled, and Delgado rolled his eyes....again. \"Yeah? You try being tackled by 7 very, very small puppies at eight oclock in the morning. By the way, we have to clean the pool. There's small amounts of fertilizer in it.\" Chloe choked with laughter. \"You went swimming with the puppies?\" She called over Viv's shoulder as they went up stairs. \"Yeah, but then we took a nap because I'm old and tired and not cut out to be running around with a bunch of small, annoying dogs like you.\" Chloe glared, although playfully. \"Old and tired huh? So we won't have any resistance cutting your nails then!\" She barked before disappearing out of sight. Delgado chuckled. Chloe was full of energy, but hey, so was he. He wasn't that old yet.

Delgado wait! You promised you'd take me home. Delgado!\" Delgado tried to ignore the gnawing feeling that leaving chloe left in his stomach. He didn't know why or what had even motivated him to save the gringa in the first place... she wasn't his responsibility. Why then, did he feel this uncontrolable urge to protect her. No. He had his own problems. Delgado turned away from Chloe as the train began to move away from the platform. \"Delgado!\" \"Don't turn around, don't turn around, don't turn aroun- ohh, who am I kidding! I'm coming Chloe!\" Delgado turned and bolted after the train as it slowly began to pick up speed. \"Run Delgado! Come on, you can make it!\" chloe yelled. Delgado got to the door of the box-car \"come on delgado jump!\" And jump he did. Delgado was hanging in the door trying to pull himself in to the train. \"I could... I could use some help!\" delgado grunted. \"Oh, here I've got you!\" Chloe yelped as she latched on to Delgado's ear and pulled only to be jerked back and out of the box \"Ahhh! Delgado!\" \"hold on, Chloe. Don't let go.\" Delgado growled as he heaved himself roughly in to the train car, Chloe hanging off his back. He flopped to the ground as soon as he was in, Chloe clumsily tumbling off his back and onto the rough wooden floor next to him. \"Chloe? Chloe,are you alright?\" Delgado turned and nosed her side carefully. \"I- I'm fine\" she said ,lifting her head \"Oh! Delgado I'm sorry, your ear its bleeding!\" \"I hadn't noticed...\" delgado shrugged before sprawling comfortably back on the floor,across from the chihuahua. Chloe whimpered softly as she sat in front of Delgado and started licking at his torn ear. \"I'm sorry Delgado, you could have been hurt.\" she whispered. \"Why do you care kid?\" Delgado snapped , he quickly regretted it when he saw Chloes wide/watery blue eyes. \"...sorry that was uncalled for.\" Chloe smiled weakly at Delgado. \"Its okay\" she licked his chin showing she forgave him and curled up against his side. Only because he was warm, she reasoned to herself. She liked Papi. Didn't she? She got her answer when Delgado curled around her, his tail against her side and his head next to hers. Blocking the wind with his body and keeping her warm. she felt her heart pound , and her tummy lurch(in a good way). \"Delgado, you will come back with me, wont you?\" \"Si Princesa.\" \"Do you promise.

He growled 'Damn Diablo!' If he ever got his paws on him again he would tear him to shreds. Delgado slowly stepped towards the Chihuahuas. Papi jumped back as he approached out of surprise but the German shepherd ignored him in favor of Chloe. \"Kid?\" He sat next to her prone body and huffed out a soft whine. \"Chloe?\" Delgado nosed her cheek, \"Hey Princesa… Por favor, Chloe, No salgas mi…(1)\" the last part was whispered as he licked her cheek eyes closed tight. \"D-delgado?\" The shepherd's eyes snapped open, \"Chloe!\" the Chihuahua sat up slowly, and Papi hopped up to her side. \"Chloe you're alright!

He turned and headed out of the cave to give them their privacy. Delgado stared in shock when Chloe leaned into his chest pressing her face into his long fur and he automatically put a protective paw around her.

So I've been wanting to write an love story for Carol and a female OC since before the movie came out and now that I've seen it (really good movie! I was so excited for Brie in this role!) this story is starting to take shape, and how I want to connect it to my 'Infinity War' and 'Endgame' story! :) This story will feature spoilers for 'Captain Marvel' although more references than spoilers, I think (what I mean is, this story takes place in 2014, before the events of 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' (which is my personal top favourite Marvel movie so far, but 'Black Panther' is a very close second!) sorry, got too excited there! ;D This story takes place in 2014 while the events of 'Captain Marvel' take place back in the 1990s, so while there will be some references to those events in this story, I don't think there will be any major spoilers, and this story is mostly separate).

Mr. and Mrs. Bane, Doctors of Archaeology, were constantly leaving on sudden business deals and expeditions - they were away more than they were at home, and had seen more places than anyone Nora knew. So when she woke up the next morning to find only Mary, the woman who looked after her whenever her parents were away - 'Mary Poppins' as Nora sometimes called her - Nora wasn't all that shocked when Mary told her that her parents had left in the middle of the night on urgent business. It wasn't unusual. What was unusual, however, was the nature of it, and for a couple of reasons. One, they had apparently gotten a call late into the night and had hastily thrown some packing together and left within half an hour of receiving the call. And two, they hadn't said goodbye to her. Mary said it was because the call was so sudden and they didn't want to wake and disturb her, it being the middle of the night. All right, she could understand that, but at the same time, she was their daughter. She was twelve years old now, almost thirteen, and her parents sometimes brought her along on their trips - there was a lot of moving around, it was constant upheaval. The strange part was was that the older the got, the less they brought her along, which seemed backwards to her. She could understand them leaving her at home when she was younger and her joining them as she grew older, but it was the opposite and she had no idea why. The days passed, turning into weeks, which also wasn't unusual, for trips such as these could see the Dr. Banes gone for weeks or even months on end. Nora dismissed her original wondering about the nature of this trip, concluding that it was just another one of her parents' adventures, and carried on as before. However, when a month had gone by without any word from either of them, she really began to wonder. Her thirteenth birthday passed, still nothing. When three months had passed, still without any trace, men in black suits arrived at the door of the Bane's house. Apparently, they were apart of the team her parents had been working with on this job - they didn't say what that job was, or go into any further detail - when her parents had suddenly disappeared without a trace, no one could find them. They were still searching, and assured Nora that they would do everything they could to try and find them. Harry and Jenny Bane were officially reported missing. Mary helped in any way she could, but also had a young family of her own, so she couldn't be around all the time, and was around less and less the older Nora got. The older she got, the less and less she believed her Mum and Dad would be returning. Her parents were gone, and they had left without saying goodbye. They had always been very work-focused people, and obviously struggled balancing work and family life. It was unintentional that they let their work take priority, but this still was the case nonetheless. This unannounced leave and disappearance, however, confirmed Nora's long-held suspicions: her own parents had chosen their work over her. She had hated archaeology and anything to do with it ever since. Well, that started off on a sad note! :/ Hope you all enjoyed this first chapter, though! We'll learn more about Nora and how she's coping with her parents' disappearance in the next chapter (Carol probably won't appear for a few chapters at least). Thanks so much for reading and I hope you enjoyed! :)[Chapter 3] 2 ~ Eleanora 'Nora' Bane and the Curse of Archaeology London, 2014 For someone who hated the archaeological profession so much, it made it difficult when your house was basically a museum. Her parents had acquired a vast collection from their jobs and travels over the years and every piece was a painful reminder of what it all had cost her. Nora thought that judging by the amount of artifacts vs. the amount of family photographs proved her point pretty well. It also made it difficult when it was the one thing she excelled at. Having grown up in a house full of history and with archaeologist parents, a lot of their knowledge had been passed onto her, so hate it as she may, she knew it damn well. That was how she had picked up odd jobs over the years. She had bar-tended for a while too, but eventually quit. Now twenty-five, she hadn't gone to university, but picked up jobs assessing artifacts and cataloging at various museums and universities, bringing in some of her parents' artifacts and sharing them. In those cases, she tried to leave the item with whoever she was sharing it with, who firmly replied, \"We couldn't possibly take away that precious artifact from you.\" It could mean less to her, honestly. She was currently in the process of packing away all that stuff and figuring out where to donate it, maybe even moving altogether - it was just her now, so a flat would be just fine, she didn't need the whole house. However, assessing and cataloging and packing away everything turned out to be a lengthy and frustrating process, and one that was taking much, much longer than she'd hoped. Part of her wanted to load it onto a truck and dump it at the museum and let them handle it. London had enough museums, she was sure someone would want this stuff and would gladly take it off her hands. She'd begun packing it away, but hadn't gotten rid of any of it yet. There had been no update on the Bane disappearance case, and Nora often wondered if, true to their word, the men in black suits really had done 'all they could' to search for her parents. But it had been eleven years with nothing having turned up, and that was pretty self-explanatory. She had inquired countless times over the years, but had never gotten very far. No one seemed to know anything about her parents. They seemed to have simply vanished into thin air, leaving behind their daughter and all of their beloved artifacts. She hated all this stuff. She hated it all. She hated her parents for leaving her to deal with it all. She hated them for leaving her, period. All this crap had been sitting around for thousands of years while her family had barely lasted twelve. Their office she'd barely touched, barely set foot in. One, it was an even more daunting case than the rest of the house, stuffed to the brim full of papers and books and boxes, and two, it felt even closer. She hadn't always been allowed inside, and always had to knock, but that was where Harry and Jenny had done most of their work from home, and so it felt all the more close to their loss. After returning home from the gym, setting foot inside the house with stuff lying scattered everywhere, a blatant reminder of all the work she had to do and had been putting off and succeeding in doing so for years, Nora instead collapsed onto the couch with something to eat and watched reruns of Doctor Who . She had always loved the pure other-worldliness of the show, whether on another planet, or even on Earth, right in London even. However, with the events of the last years, maybe it wasn't all so fictional, not even that far away. Just last year, Thor was here, right here in London, the Norse God of Thunder, lighting the place up and swinging his hammer around. Harry and Jenny would've loved it. But Gods in London? It seemed crazy. Almost as unbelievable as her parents' disappearance. After re-watching three episodes, cleaning up the dishes, and having a shower - it was like avoiding homework, she would literally rather do anything else - she finally got down to work. She would feel accomplished in what she managed to do in a couple of hours, however, one look at the masses of other similar items would remind her that she was nowhere near to being finished or freed of this burden her parents had left her. As if getting rid of it all would suddenly solve everything. All of this stuff was dusty, old, and boring. Her parents had kept it all in pristine condition, but their absence over the last eleven years had caused that condition to downgrade considerably. If they knew how she had neglected it all, they would be very disappointed. But it wasn't hers, it was theirs. Like you neglected me. They would be as disappointed as the time she'd accidentally bumped their favourite piece, an ugly old vase, and it had smashed to the floor. She could still hear them yelling at her for what had been an accident, until they finally realized she herself was hurt, having cut herself on a piece of the broken glass. She shook her head, ridding herself temporarily of that bad memory. Stupid vase. She hated it the most. Mary called, asking if Nora would be around that evening as she wanted to stop by. \"You know where to find me,\" Nora told her. \"Lost amongst the treasure trove.\" The thing was, when she had been younger, before her parents' disappearance, she had been quite interested in all this stuff, so she actually knew quite a lot, that, and being surrounded by it all the time and two passionate archaeologist parents who were happy to engage anyone in conversation about it. However, a lot of this stuff was new to her. She hadn't been allowed near many of the artifacts unless with careful supervision, or her parents themselves were showing her (especially not after the whole broken vase incident). Some of it - okay, she admitted, most of it - left her curious, but then she remembered what it meant and what she was doing. Don't get attached. You'll only turn out like them. Collectors of a vast amount of old crap that held little-to-no value and had ultimately consumed their life. When Mary arrived, Nora was dusty, frustrated, and stiff from precisely examining each and every item and every page of notes, trying to match each stack of notes to their respective object. Luckily, for the most part, her parents had been pretty organized in their cataloging and note-taking. \"Hope I'm not interrupting anything,\" Mary said. \"Nope. Actually, I'm glad you interrupted.\" Mary sighed when she saw she had caught her in the middle of her work. \"At it again? Still packing it all away.\" \"Yup. It's a hell of a process. Could use a hand.\" Again, Mary sighed. \"I'm sorry, Nora. But I can't do that to Harry and Jenny's work.\" Nora shrugged. Always the same reply. \"That's okay. I'll do it then.\" \"Nora, what if they come back?\" Mary's gaze burned into her. What if they come back to find that you've given away their life's work. They'll be devastated. Now it was Nora's turn to sigh. \"You still think they're coming back? Mary, it's been eleven years. They're not coming back. And even if they did, they can spend the whole rest of their lives tracking it all down again, that's what they loved to do, anyway. And then I won't be in their way.\" Mary scoffed. \"You still think they didn't care for you? Love you?\" \"They vanished into the night without a trace, without even bothering to say goodbye to their child. I mean, for all we know they could've found El Dorado and are now living in splendor in a city of gold. Tell me they care.\" The two women stood staring each other down, each holding their side of the argument equally firmly. Finally, Nora sighed and rubbed a hand over her face. \"I just need to get all this stuff out.\" \"Or, maybe, you need to get away from all this stuff,\" Mary offered alternatively. \"Go traveling Nora. Your parents left you some money, and you've been saving. Go, get out of London, get a change of scenery. I think it would do you some good.\" Nora shrugged. \"Maybe...\" \"The sooner you stop believing that they left to rid themselves of you, the better.\" Her words hurt, but it was nothing Nora hadn't considered before. There's the first official chapter! :) Hope you all are enjoying so far! I'm in the process of adding Nora into my 'Infinity War/Endgame' story - I keep getting so many ideas! Thank you so much for reading and I hope you enjoyed! :) And thank you so much for all the follows and favourites! :) you all are amazing![Chapter 4] 3 ~ Deals and Forgery Museum of Great Britain - London \"So, it's authentic?\" \"As authentic as it gets, Mate.\" \"Wow - fascinating...\" Randy breathed, already large eyes even wider behind his glasses as he examined the artifact, the hilt of a Crusader sword, broken off from the blade. \"Yeah,\" Nora droned with a roll of her eyes. The way he gushed over it was more painful than annoying as it reminded her of her parents. Randy was a new intern at the museum she most frequently visited to display pieces from her parents' collection. \"And they found this? Your parents?\" \"Uh huh.\" \"Wow, that's, that's awesome!\" He beamed. \"Your parents are big names here.\" \"Uh huh. Tell me about it...\" \"And what about this?\" He carefully set the sword hilt aside and gestured to the other item she had brought along as well. \"I was hoping you might be able to help me with that, actually. I don't know what it is, and I can't find any record of it in my parents' notes, and they kept detailed notes of everything.\" \"Hmm...\" he examined it closer. The item was a long, thin cylinder, both ends cracked, making it look like a short wooden spike, and was about the length and width of a paper towel roll. The surface was rough. \"Huh, it almost looks like it was broken off of something,\" Randy observed. \"Yeah, on both sides,\" Nora noted. \"Yeah. And it almost appears to have some sort of writing or markings carved into it, see?\" She nodded. \"But I'm not sure what it is, I've never come across anything like this in my studies.\" \"Vampire spike?\" she joked. He chuckled. \"Maybe.\" \"Well you can keep examining it, if you like. As well as the sword hilt.\" His eyes widened like a child in a candy shop. \" Really ?\" She shrugged. \"Yeah, keep them. I have no use for them.\" \"You're sure?\" \"Yes, they'll only sit collecting dust at home.\" His expression gave off the impression that he had just won a million pounds. \"Okay, thank you! That's brilliant!\" \"Don't mention it, Mate. I'll see you later.\" \"Bye, Nora! Thanks again!\" \"Yeah-\" She gathered her bag and was just leaving the room when someone came through the door from the other side and they almost crashed. \"Oh, Nora, hi!\" Lizzie beamed at her once they had skidded to a stop. \"Oh, hey Lizzie.\" Lizzie was in charge of the internship program and often tried to recruit Nora. Nora would, in return, remind her of her lack of university degree, and Lizzie would reply by saying that they could work around that. However, Nora didn't like the idea of them making exceptions for her. \"Bringing in more artifacts?\" Lizzie asked, going over to the table to join Randy. \"Yeah! One of which is the hilt of a Crusader sword!\" gushed Randy. \"Yeah, just some, just some stuff,\" Nora replied, cursing herself for her embarrassing stuttering. She would be lying if she said she hadn't developed a slight crush on Lizzie and admittedly, maybe, maybe , sometimes brought items in just so she could impress her with her knowledge. She loved the way the young woman's eyes lit up when examining an artifact, like Randy, who Nora was sure also had a crush on the other woman. \"This is amazing!\" Lizzie cried, her obvious excitement making Nora smile. \"These items are so rare, so unique! Your parents were so lucky to find them.\" \"And, she's letting us keep them!\" Randy told her. \"No!\" \"Yes!\" \"Really?\" Now she looked to Nora who shrugged. \"They're just sitting around the house collecting dust. They'll do the same here, but at least they'll have more of a purpose.\" \"Oh Nora, thank you so much!\" Lizzie came over and threw her arms around her. \"What can we do to repay you?\" \"Oh, don't be silly, it's nothing, really.\" Nora hugged her back. \"Well it's not nothing to us. Can we at least buy you a drink and dinner, or something?\" Lizzie pressed. \"You really have no idea how much this stuff means to us.\" No, you're right, I don't... \"Yeah, but I know what it's like, with my parents. How excited they got about all this stuff. It's fine, really. Thank you, though, for the offer.\" Though that actually sounds really nice... \"Well, thank you, so much. And I know I mention it every time, but it's part of the job: we do have an internship program...\" Nora chuckled. \"I knew you'd ask again.\" \"It's really great,\" put in Randy. Nora nodded. \"I'll think about it.\" \"Well, that's a step further than we got last time, so I say that's successful.\" Lizzie smiled. \"Thanks again, Nora.\" \"Yeah, anytime. Thanks.\" With that, she left. Out in the hall, she paused. Having long ago built a wall between her and her parents' profession, which had strengthened over the years, she sometimes wondered if she was throwing away big chances and opportunities because she so stubbornly kept that wall up, and if in doing so she was holding herself back. She didn't let herself ponder it for long. Forgery was tedious work, and extremely time-consuming, but Nora would be lying if she didn't feel a little bit of an excited buzz and a little swell of pride when she completed a project. She examined sixteenth century coins, very likely pirates' gold, a few of which she had made herself, and the others which where authentic. She could only tell the difference because she had made them and knew that they weren't the real thing. Not bad, Bane. Her parents and Mary would be appalled if they knew what she was doing, and she guessed that if Lizzie found out that internship offer would be gone. Lizzie's line about all these artifacts being 'rare and unique' flooded her thoughts. But people would pay good money for stuff like this, as she had discovered, and it wasn't even the real thing! Sure, it was a bit of a sketchy way to earn money, but... Her phone buzzed. An unknown number sending a short text message, with a location and time. That was it. With the forged coins all finished, she gathered them, packing them up and left the house. She had a rendezvous and an exchange to make. Wow, thank you all so much for the 1000+ reads already, and all the reviews, follows, and favourites! :D that's amazing, I just started this story! Obviously, Nora's forging efforts are going to backfire... But that won't be until a little later. One month until 'Endgame'! Can't wait to see Carol in action again! ;) As always, thanks so much for reading and I hope you enjoyed! :))[Chapter 5] 4 ~ What Was Left Behind Nora had seen Indiana Jones (her mum had always had a huge crush on young Harrison Ford) and had played Tomb Raider (she herself preferred Lara Croft), she knew how it always went: someone, usually some ominous force was always hunting for the same 'treasure' as the hero, and there usually ended up being some sort of mystical/magical object or force involved. But she had always accepted it as something that only happened in the movies and games and on television, not in real life. Archaeology wasn't really like that. Like with Doctor Who , there were the fantastical elements, but it was all set in the real world, grounded in reality. But also as she had discovered with Doctor Who, all that stuff was a lot closer than she thought. Today she was tackling the office. And she was not looking forward to it. That morning she had training scheduled at the gym. Afterwards she came home, made something to eat, and had a shower, dragging out the process as if it would make the cleaning up of the office go away. It did not, however, and if anything it only made her more reluctant. The office door made the same old creaking sound when she opened it. She immediately opened the window and turned on the lights, trying to brighten the stuffy place that was jammed full of papers, boxes, books, and of course, more artifacts. Naturally. That was a given. Where the hell should she start? She felt overwhelmed already. \"Bloody hell,\" she sighed, and dove in. She grabbed the nearest box - nearly dropping it as it turned out to be much heavier than anticipated - and plopped down to sit on the rug (which had come from India) and began rifling through the box. Did she even need to look at all these papers and notes? Could she just throw them out? It's not like they were being used for anything anymore. But she felt a twinge of guilt at tossing away all of her parents' hard work. But also, what good was it all doing cluttering up the office? Putting some music on in the background helped make the task seem less dull and more manageable. Her curious side got the better of her, and what could have and should have been a quick job became a very long one as she examined each and every scrap of paper and every sentence, word, and marking written on them. Most were stapled together, notes on various artifacts, their history, alleged location, stories about them, but there were a lot of single and incomplete sheets as well. Nora recognized a lot of the artifacts as ones still sitting here in the house, some in this very room, as if waiting for her parents to return. You and me both. Though they were waiting more patiently than she was. She decided to do a section of the room at a time, breaking down the task into more manageable pieces. The desk seemed like the least big piece, that was, until she opened the drawers. God, her parents kept everything. Like the rest of the room, the desk drawers were stuffed just as full, so full she had trouble opening some of them. She took to just pulling everything out and tossing it on the floor. She even went as far as pulling one of the drawers out completely and dumping out its contents. Now there were papers everywhere, and that still wasn't the last of them. Muttering to herself, she continued with the unloading of the desk. This carried on until she realized just how big of a pile of papers had amassed on the rug, and she decided to sort through those before adding any more. She was moving to the other side of the pile to sit when she stood on some of the pages and slipped. Cursing, she just managed to catch her balance, although her actions shifted the rug and drew up one of the corners. Now moving to re-adjust the rug, she tugged it back in place, lifting one end to drag it over. And when she did she found something. A file folder sat just off centre beneath the rug. It was like the countless others she had found in here, but what was it doing under the rug of all places? Why was this one separate from the others? And why was it hidden? Her curiosity spiked - must be important and/or exciting if it were hidden and oh-so strategically placed. Going over she scooped it up, sliding it, and a bunch of dust, out from its hiding place. It was thin, not much inside it. Opening it she found a sheet of paper. At the top was a black stamp, a symbol and title. S.H.I.E.L.D. An instant memory suddenly resurfacing struck her like an electric shock - the men in black suits who had come to break the news of her parents' disappearance, this very symbol - an eagle - had been on their badges. She had forgotten that detail until just now, the stamp jogging her memory of it. Her heart had begun to thunder in her chest. She read further. The page was titled Project M.A.R.C.H. Beneath the acronym in fine print read: Mythical Antiquities Research and Care Headquarters. It appeared to be some sort of vague assignment outline, but her parents seemed to be heading the project. She read their names a ways down on the page. Behind the page, she found a couple of ID cards paper-clipped to the back of the folder. They were for her parents, one for each of them, and had the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo and title on them as well. TEMPORARY was marked across the back of both cards. Jumping up and going back over to the desk, bringing the file with her, she fired up the computer. She opened an internet search tab and punched in S.H.I.E.L.D. S.H.I.E.L.D. Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement and Logistics Division. World intelligence and law enforcement agency. Founded: 1946. Howard Stark, Peggy Carter, Colonel Chester Philips. Based In: Washington, D.C. Nora cast a glance over at the ID cards. \"What were you guys doing?\" she voiced aloud. She sat there for a few minutes, she didn't know how long, just looking back and forth between the ID cards and the web-page. Next time her eyes fell on the screen, they settled on the location: Washington, D.C. She had a lead. Suddenly, after eleven years of nothing, things were beginning to piece together. She picked up the ID cards. Time to put her forging skills to work. \"Mary, hi,\" she said into the phone, all while throwing some clothes into a suitcase. She had just completed booking a flight only minutes before. \"I'm doing it, I'm taking your advice and going on a little trip. Not sure how long I'll be gone, but a few days at least.\" \"Oh, Nora. That sounds wonderful. Are you going with anyone?\" \"No, no, just me.\" \"Well that's good, I'm proud of you. Where is it you're going?\" \"Washington D.C.\" It's all starting to connect! ;) Hope you all are enjoying, thanks so much for reading! :)[Chapter 6] 5 ~ Amy Locke, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Upon arriving in Washington D.C., Nora gave herself a day to battle jet-lag and explore the area she was staying in, but then it was time to get down to work. Forging the ID badge had been easy - she had scanned her mother's badge, changed a few of the details, and inserted a photo of herself and voila! - but sneaking into the headquarters building would be very much something else. She dressed in the most professional clothes she owned: a black blazer over a white button-up shirt, dark jeans, tall boots. And sunglasses. Secret agents always wore sunglasses. Pinning on the fake badge she was suddenly Agent Amy Locke of S.H.I.E.L.D., and was ready to go. This is Agent Locke reporting for duty! Yes, her plan was not fool-proof, but it was the best she had right now with the sudden lead on her parents. She had to give it a try. Arriving at the Triskelion, the round, cylindrical building loomed over her. She wondered how many secrets it held. There was only one way to find out- She took her first steps inside. She was greeted by various professionally-dressed people on their way to work, and a giant version of the agency's eagle symbol on a sign in the lobby. She was definitely in the right place. Now she just had to find the right section. Heading over to the elevator, she read the directory: Records and Archives, Basement. Brilliant. That seemed like the most logical place to start. More people were also waiting for the elevator, so when the doors opened, it ended up being fairly crowded in there. \"What floor?\" the suited man standing closest to the buttons asked her. \"Basement, please. Thank you.\" Which meant that she would probably be getting off last. The elevator was incredibly smooth and quiet as it carried the passengers to their awaited destinations. She stared at the floor, not wanting to draw unwanted attention. On the next floor stop, most people got out, and a blonde woman got on. She smiled at Nora, coming to stand next to her. \"Hey, Liv. How are you? Nice hair, when did you dye it?\" Nora could only stare blinking back. \"I-I'm sorry?\" \"Oh-\" The woman looked startled and taken aback. \"I'm sorry. You just look so much like a friend of mine who works here. So much like her...\" \"Oh, that's all right. Happens.\" \"Yeah...\" The woman continued staring but quickly caught herself and looked away. Her ID badge read, Carter, Sharon. At last, it was Nora's turn to get off. She and the woman, Sharon, exchanged and friendly but slightly-awkward smile, and Nora stepped off the elevator, exhaling a heavy breath. It definitely felt like a basement down here, fluorescent lights, concrete walls. Archives and Records wasn't the only section located down here, so she had to do a bit of wandering. Luckily, the building was circular, so if you got lost you just had to keep going around and eventually you would end up back where you started, for the most part. Finally she found it, pushing the glass door open. A woman sat at a desk in a small entrance hall with a large set of double glass doors leading to what Nora guessed was the room where the actual records were stored. Nora had been kind of waiting for a moment to proudly flash her fake badge. Yes, yes I am a secret agent here at this secret intelligence agency, see, I've got a badge. And sunglasses. The woman at the desk glanced up at her and offered a smile. Then she pressed a button, which turned out to be for buzzing Nora in. The loud buzz startled her. \"Thanks,\" she said, and opened the double doors, entering the room. She was in! She was in - oh, God... The room which she entered wasn't really a room, more of a warehouse, filled with row after row after row of huge, tall shelves full of boxes, full of every record since the agency's establishment in 1946, she guessed, judging by how much there was here. Well, she'd made it this far. Time to continue the journey. She had no idea where to start, or what she intended to find, and already felt overwhelmed. She forced her feet forward though, boots clicking against the concrete floor, weaving between the long, tall shelves. She went to the B's first, figuring that checking up on her last name would be a good place to start. She did not envy whoever had the job of organizing all this. She got frustrated just trying to organize her parents' collection, let alone all this. Time to dive in. She continued walking until she reached the large, very large, B section. She walked along the shelf, trailing her fingertips across the filing boxes' surfaces. B. BA. She slid the box from it's place, straining under its weight - no wonder there were so many boxes with the same labels if this was how heavy one was. Setting it down on the floor and crouching beside it, she opened it up and searched through. Nope, nothing. Too early in the alphabet. Placing the lid back on top and picking up the box she lifted it back into its place, taking down the next one, equally heavy. Yikes, when she got back home she would have to tell her trainer that they needed to work on her arms more. She did the same with the second box, and began rifling through the perfectly-organized files. Backup... Banner... Her heart leapt, but then realized that while it was a 'Ban' in 'Banner' there was no 'Bane', meaning there was no file. She continued looking, trying to see if maybe (unlikely) someone had put the file out of place by accident. Barton... Battle of New York... Nothing . She absorbed this. So there wasn't any file on her parents themselves. But what about the project they were working under. Project M.A.R.C.H... She returned the box and began speed-walking down the long aisles to the M's. While this search turned up some interesting results as well - Mandarin, Mjolnir, Mystic Arts - nothing on specifically Project M.A.R.C.H. P's for project then? If nothing turned up there, she didn't know where she would go from there. Perhaps she could ask someone - they probably had an online database. But that could blow her cover. Arriving at the P's, she hurriedly started digging. S.H.I.E.L.D. sure had a hell of a lot of 'Projects'. Her eyes scanning down the list suddenly landed on one, bringing into focus the name: M.A.R.C.H. Project M.A.R.C.H. Ha ha, there it was! Grinning now she withdrew the file, which was thin like the one she had found back home, but not as thin. She was about to open it when she stopped, realizing what she was doing, what this meant. This file could hold the answers to what had happened to her parents. Was she prepared for that? It had been so long with nothing, and now suddenly she had something. It was now or never. Before heading to her own station, Sharon knocked on the Director's office door. \"Excuse me, Director Fury? Do you have a moment?\" Fury looked up from his desk and nodded, appearing concerned when she shut the office door behind her. \"Agent, is everything all right?\" \"I had a strange encounter in the elevator this morning.\" \"Strange how?\" \"There was a woman also in the elevator, English with darker hair. But other than that she looked exactly like Agent Sword. I thought she was Liv, I even said hi to her, but it turned out she wasn't her.\" Fury absorbed this. \"Was she an agent?\" \"Yes, she had a badge.\" \"Name?\" \"Amy Locke.\" \"I think we would know if we had two nearly-identical agents working for us, or it certainly would have come up. Where was she headed?\" \"She got off at the basement.\" \"Hmm. Either garage or records.\" Sharon nodded. \"We'll call down there and see if anyone saw a woman matching her description. I'll run her name through our lists and see if it turns up.\" Sure enough, upon calling down to records, the woman at the front desk confirmed that an agent matching Sharon's description had gone into the records room. And there was no 'Amy Locke' registered with S.H.I.E.L.D. Fury pressed a button on the phone. \"Hill?\" \"Yes, Nick? \" she responded over the radio. \"I need you to head downstairs to records. I think we may have an impostor.\" Duh, duh, duh! ;) A little suspense! So I don't think Carol and Nora will meet for a couple/few chapters still, but I'm thinking Carol will appear in the next one :) Yay! Thank you so much for reading and as always I hope you enjoyed!

The beginning might be a bit boring, but it gets great when you're getting further into it - or at least, in my opinion. I also made a trailer, and you can watch it here: watch?v=JcDKr76oLNE Update: I almost wrote this two years ago when my English wasn't that good yet, Alex isn't very IC if you ask me, and I honestly hate I wrote Alex in the way of \"I, I\" instead of \"Alex/He\". However, in the next parts of this fan fiction, I recently have 6 of them already, it'll be much better and much different. I also like to say that this part might be very similar to the movie. I guarantee that the others won't, though. (I'm talking about the PARTS then, not the chapters. This part will have 50 chapters, if I'm right. Really worth the reading, from what I heard from some friends…) Warning: 1. We are both Dutch , which means we're both not that good in English. So it'll contain probably some bad gramatics and less details in the beginning . However, friends and people around on tumblr etc. desperately asked me to put this online, and so I decided to. In the beginning Alex might be played a bit bad. But it'll get better in time. I started to write this while barely being known with the film and the English Language, and it gets much better further in the story. What I heard from friends who already read it entirely, they seem to adore it. Haha. 2. This story also contains some gruel things, has a sexual twist, and it's possible to find anything else which might startles you or anything whenever being under the age of 16. Just so you are all aware of that. 3. This used to be a role playing game which means it's written by two different persons. I wrote everything for Alex, and the friend of mine wrote everything for Nigel. It's written in the way that you're able to see two characters their eyeview. That means, the story will be read in parts like: Alex, Nigel, Alex, Nigel, Alex - you'll see that whenever you'll start reading. It might be a bit tricky to understand right now, but don't worry. I put everything in the right order so the only thing you'll have to do is read, haha. A good story to read whenever you are bored. Chapter one - The new boy Nigel: \"...Bless us Oh Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thy bounty, through Christ, Our Lord. Amen.\" After the common prayer everybody sat down on their chairs and got to their dinner, which many were eager to do all along. Of course you could make all your students pray before their meals, when you threatened they'd else get nothing at all. That didn't mean you could make all of them like it. Nigel was one of the few who didn't mind. He was taught no different under the strict authority of his father. How could someone complain, when they knew no different? For someone who was new entirely to this school, he didn't stand out much. He blended in perfectly well with the other students, which was not that strange considering everyone was made to wear the same uniform. Still, no one seemed to notice him at first. No one, except one other person in the hall.. Alex Forbes. Somehow he noticed him right away, as if he felt the odd boy's presence by mere instinct. And just as he thought of him, asked something to his friend sitting next to him, Nigel looked up, as if his name had just been called. Like he could hear what you were saying though this was technically impossible. Alex: \"...Bless us Oh Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thy bounty, through Christ, Our Lord. Amen.\" Those were the phrases Alex always mumbled. The reasons why he still took the effort to say them were they were required and his dad didn't wanted to be embarrassed in front of the whole school - even though they already knew how difficult he could be. As soon as everybody had finished the phrases, they took a seat to stuff their selves with food. As Alex poked in the dished meal, Josh - which sat next to him - suddenly began to speak. 'Who is the new guy?' he asked him softly while pointing at the boy on the other side of the room. Alex glanced up, following his stare and shrugged his shoulders lightly while he sheaf a amount of food in his mouth. 'I don't know,' he answered shortly. Alex saw how the boy glanced up, like he knew that they were talking about him. Alex blinked a few times and glanced at my dish again. 'Did you actually know that I saw them placing a new bed in your room. He's probably going to be your new room mate.' Alex glanced up when he realized what Josh just told him and gave him tap with his elbow. 'That's bullshit,' he answered irritated. Then, when he glanced at the boy again - which seemed to enjoy his mail - he stood up while lifting my hand up in the air. 'Could I leave, sir?' One of the teachers glanced up while frowning slightly. 'To where, mister Forbes?' 'To the bathroom.' 'Could you do that later?' 'It's quite necessary need.' He motioned that could go and turned back to his dish as Alex nodded grateful. When he stood up, he glanced once at his friends, his dish and then at the boy again - which still seemed to pay his attention on his meal. After that, he walked right away, but not to the bathroom. That was just a way to get out of there. Now he was able to look if Josh had been honestly. As he reached my room, he noticed that Josh was right. Alex had a new roommate, and probably that new guy. As he sighed he came closer to the new bed, staring at the chest in front of it. As rude and curious he could be, he knelt down and opened the seals of the chest. Slowly he lifted up the lid while staring at the plastic cover that seemed to hide his possessions. Before he sheaved the cover away, he glanced at the doorway to see if anyone was coming. There seemed to be no one in the hallway at the moment. He heard nothing. He looked back at the chest while wrapping his fingertips underneath the edges of the plastic cover, and pulled it away to see what was hidden. A few plastic storage boxes - which contained bones, a whatever it was, and suddenly he saw a black thing coming up. As he sheaf it further away, he suddenly stared right into the eyes of a dead cat what made him fell backwards. 'Fuck,' he cursed while staring at the chest with big eyes - like he couldn't understand what he just saw. Did this new guy took a dead stuffed cat with him? He pressed his jaws and swallowed, trying to get rid of the fear. Then he bend over the chest again, to snoop between the stuff. Nigel: \"Do you mind?\" The voice seemed to come from nowhere. After all there had been no footsteps in the hallway to indicate anyone was coming. Or maybe Alex was just too creeped out by the cat in his trunk to hear anything. Nigel's voice cut through the silence clearly, though. It was a lower voice than you'd expect. It sounded nearly emotionless though a little offended around the edges. When Alex turned he stared at him for a moment, and it was like he was staring him away from his stuff, pursing his lips slightly in indifference. When Alex moved back finally Nigel walked past him without another word and kneelt down before his trunk, just to check if everything inside was still there, and if it was still intact, like he expected Alex to steal his stuffed cat. Alex: As I suddenly heard someone talking, I held my breath and glanced at the doorway. It was the new guy from which voice was very odd and emotionless. As I frowned lightly I threw the plastic cover over his stuff again and I stood up to walk right towards to the door. 'Don't make yourself feel too comfortable.' Just as I wanted to walk away I pursed my lips, pressing my hands on the doorframes. Was I really about to leave this guy behind in my room with his freaky stuffed stuff? I looked backwards over my shoulder and sniffed. Then I slowly turned my body into his direction to see what he was going. 'Who are you actually?' I asked him on a uninterested tune - like I didn't care at all. To be honest, I was interested in his name, just so I could accuse him at the headmaster - which was my dad - if he should do anything wrong. Nigel: Nigel ignored his new roommate entirely, instead he putted his hand on the cat without an entire clear reason why. As if he once again wanted to make sure it was still there. He lift his head up towards his roommate, when he requested his name, but without really directly looking him in the eyes. Like Alex meant nothing to him. And he didn't.. At least for now. \"I'm Nigel.\" Alex: The way he ignored and glanced at me made me even more irritated. I almost wanted to ask him if he even heard me. I pressed my lips when he told his name. Again so emotionless without a single change of tune in his voice. Nigel, I repeated in my head. I nodded slightly and looked down at him like he was a parasite that had to be destroyed soon. 'Well, just as I said. Don't make yourself too comfortable.' I left the room, without even glancing again or introducing myself. He would probably already know my name - my dad must have told him before he gave him the opportunity to stay in my room. That afternoon I'd stared Nigel while I laid down on my bed, wondering about the fact what he was doing. How it could be possible that he was so observed by anything dead. It made him quite interesting, though. But he stayed a weird freak. After I told my friends everything about Nigel that I knew, they came with an awesome and very thought plan about kidnapping him to give him like this wake up call. I had pursed my lips while my eyes were sparkling on the moment Josh suggested that. We should take him to the trains, me, Josh and Raj. Let's see if he would get that rush as well, that adrenalin. It was night now. The silence prevailed the building and all the birds were quiet outside - so did the wind, and every other natural phenomenon. I was staring at Nigel, which slept on his back, peacefully and quiet. As slowly as I could I came closer to him, armed with a cloth of drugging substance what would let Nigel be out for a little while. After I called Josh to get to my bedroom, we carried him to the nearest train station. There I placed him on a stool to take a seat next to him. Josh and I had been watching him for a little while now. He finally seemed to wake up. 'Hello,' I said to him, when he suddenly woke up and looked very incomprehensible around him - probably because of the fact that he had no idea were he was. I grabbed him by his shoulders and dragged him towards to the entrance of the train - which Josh had opened for me. While I still kept my hands tight on his shoulders, I pushed him with the upper part of his body outside of the train, grinning because of the rush. 'Come on!' I yelled loud while staring in front of me. Everything was passing so fast. Nigel still seemed to be a bit absently, so I placed my mouth near to his ear and began to shout again. 'Are you enjoying it?! Don't you feel it? You're like totally ignoring this.' I heard how Josh threw some fireworks out of the train, how it exploded somewhere behind me. 'Isn't this a fucking rush?' I asked again with a bright grin on my face. Nigel: Nigel slowly began to come back by senses. What an odd and vivid dream to have, for a moment he could have sworn he was being smothered. He opened his eyes then, but they were greeted with more light then he had expected, with more light than the small dorm could possibly provide. He opened his eyes more and lifted his head. He realized he was sitting on a chair, which seemed to tremble lightly.. like whatever he was in was moving. He also a boy in front of him, looking at him faintly amused. Nigel didn't know his name, but he remembered seeing him hang out around his roommate. He felt a slight movement next to him, heard a breath, so he quickly turned his head to see who else was there. It was Alex. Nigel stared at him, and though his eyes were emotionless still there was also confusement to be read on his face. He didn't react on the boy's greeting, just waited for an explanation. The explanation came, just no in the form he had expected. He was grabbed by his shoulders and the back of his neck, before Alex grabbed the side of the door and leant both of them out of the train, hovering dangerously above the trainrails. Though he felt the wind on his face and heard the loud noise of the explosives Josh threw behind him, he couldn't feel the 'rush' Alex was describing. Either he was too drugged, or maybe it was because he already knew how this was going to end.. Nigel had the vague sense of having to struggle, but he was still under heavy influence of whatever Alex drugged him with, and so he could barely bring himself to move at all. However his hand caught something.. a door handle, and it was quite lose. If he managed to get it off, he could speed up the process of getting the end he was expecting. So he pretended to play Alex' game, being confused and hurt by his tight grip, (he didn't even actually have to pretend for that), while his hand desperately pulled the handle instead. But before he had a chance of pulling it off. He heard commotion coming from Josh, if whom Nigel suddenly remembered the name. One of the explosives had fallen on the floor and he felt Alex pull his hands off him to get out of the way. Nigel could just in time turn himself to avoid his feet being blown off. The 'bang' that followed was incredibly loud, loud enough to make his ears drum afterwards. The moment he felt he wasn't being held anymore he stumbled on. It wasn't easy, because the drugs were still in his system, but he would have managed to pass both Alex and Josh, if it wasn't for Alex to stop him. Alex: While I kept talking to Nigel, he didn't seem to understand a word of it - or he was ignoring me as hell. 'I'm talking to you!' I yelled in his ear. Suddenly I heard something sizzle behind my back, and I felt how Josh grabbed my jacket to pull me backwards. 'Watch out!' Josh shouted while pushing me away. Because of the suddenly movement I lost the grip of Nigel his neck and shoulders. 'You fucking idiot,' I mumbled at Josh who almost fell backwards because he tried to avoid the explosives. I glanced at Nigel who also tried to avoid the explosives. Then, after the beep in my ears had reduced I saw how Nigel tried to get away by trying to hit me right in the face. I grabbed his shoulders and pushed him to the wall behind him while he still tried to hit me in the face. 'Where the fuck do you think you're going!?' I pressed him closer at the wall to avoid the way that he could escape. Then, Nigel suddenly began to spit right in my face which made me hit him at the nose - which began to bleed immediately. Again I leant us above the train rails, this time pushing him a bit further away from me, like he could fell any moment. 'You're a piece of shit, do you know that!?' 'That's enough, let him go,' I heard Josh yelling at me, grabbing my jacket again - but it didn't made any sense. 'You've to learn respect somebody, you stupid f-' 'That's enough!' I heard Josh yelling again. 'Christ!' This time Josh made it to pull me back into the train, which made me almost fell backwards while I heard Josh shouting my name. Fast I turned my head after I found my balance, watching how Josh slowly fell backwards, almost out of the train. Nigel: He struggled against Alex' grip this, but for he wasn't usually a violent person and he was still under influence of the drugs, it was only easy for Alex to grab his Jacket and push him back against the wall of the train. Nigel had been bullied or even suppressed by use of violence more than once in his past. He was not going to let it happen again. Not without a fight. So he gave Alex a hatefull glare in return and spit in his face. Of course he was rewarded by a punch in the face, but it had been worth it.. Alex hung him out far enough this time for Nigel to get a tighter grip on the doorhandle, and he actually managed to get it off this time. He lifted it and moved it to Alex' neck to cut open the omotryoid muscle in his neck. But at this point Josh pulled away both Alex and Nigel.. Like Nigel wasn't meant to kill Alex after all. In Josh' short moment of being the savior, he lost his balance and the suction of the wind through the train's door took a hold of him, slowly taking him in, like claiming Josh to it's own. As if it was a sacrifice. Nigel stepped closer and extended his arm to help Josh back in but, the moment he looked the boy in the eyes, he knew it wasn't meant to be.. There was this voice in his head, telling him to stop, telling him to let it happen. Was it Alex? He saw Josh reaching his hand to his, but Nigel stopped extending his hand far enough for him to grab it, he just lifted it now, away from where Josh could ever reach it, and then the boy lost his grip and disappeared from sight in incredible speed. He was gone. Nigel held still, slowly lowering his hand as he realized what he just did. He killed someone, in a way.. Or no.. He didn't. He turned slowly, staring at Alex with an ice-cold glare, the blood still moist and visible under his nose. He looked at Alex as if he was blaming him. He was in a way. 'You made me,' his eyes pointed out. 'This is your doing.[Chapter 2] Alex: My body froze as I saw how Josh slowly got sucked by the suction of the speed. I wanted to help him, to save him, but my legs were nailed at the ground as I held my breath while my eyes were about to pop out any moment. Just as I slowly began to breathe again, I saw how you slowly came closer to Josh, extending your arm, like you wanted to pull him back into the train. I swallowed, seeing how you doubted. Just as you wanted to grab his hand, lifted your hand which made Josh not be able to grab your hand before he fell. My heart stopped with beating for a few seconds, as I saw the glance in Josh his eyes when he realized that you wasn't about to help him, and he lost out of sight. My chest began to vibrate as you turned your body back to me, staring at me with those cold eyes. I could see the terror in your eyes, but you didn't seemed to give no sound. It was like you blamed me for Josh his dead, like you despised me on a odd way. Without any expression on your face. I pressed my lips which began to vibrate as well, realising that you didn't took the effort to save him, to stuck out your arm a little bit further so Josh had been able to pull himself into the train again. I let my head fell against the wall, licking desperately my lips while I was about to cry any moment. I blamed myself, I had to admit. But it was your fault. A few days later, we all stood around the grave of Josh, watching how his chest slowly got moved into the big hole in the ground. I stared emotionless at it, just as cold as the weather. I felt how the cold breeze stroked along my cheeks, and I glanced up while I noticed that someone was staring at me. It was you, watching me with the same glance as the one in the train - when Josh died. I pressed my jaws, not to scream at him that it was his fault. My dad followed my glance to Nigel, staring incomprehensible but suspicious as well because he had no idea what was going on. Everyone walked slowly away when the chest of Josh had finally reached the ground, but I couldn't walk away that soon. The next week was hard for me. I had been quiet and sad while I stayed mostly of the time in my room, staring at the ceiling while wondering why you let Josh fell. Just as rehearsals of the new play was about to start, I slowly began to accept Josh his death. I had to, once. Now I was sitting in the church, watching how Susan - the girl which I really liked - rehearsed for her part. Nigel: Nigel had come in unexpectantly. Whispering in Alex' ear closer in his personal space than he'd probably wish Nigel to come. \"I'm really sorry about your friend..\" He sat down on the row behind him, looking up at the ceiling of the church, as if he could see heaven through it. \"But you don't have to worry.. He's in peace now.\" He had stared at Alex pointedly after that.. As if reading his mind.. And to Alex it must feel like he did. The question was if he was really capable of doing this. \"The girl's quite something, isn't she?\" he suggested, as if he wanted to prove that he could read his mind. He got no answer, but the silence seemed to satisfy Nigel anyway. He got up again and turnd around, walking out of the church as quickly as he had come. But as he did, he already knew Alex would follow him. He wouldn't be able to resist it.. He was curious, and Nigel knew it. Nigel felt it. So was Nigel himself. The only difference was that Nigel had grown to admit it.. Alex would not. But follow he would anyway. Alex: Suddenly I heard someone whispering in my ear. The voice sounded to familiar - even though I hadn't heard it that much yet. I pressed my lips, trying not to make any response. I didn't wanted to curse you in the church - nor in the presence of Susan. She would probably look down on my if I should do that. As I suddenly heard you slowly standing up and walking away, I liked my lips. I doubted if I had to follow you, to go after you so I could ask you why you didn't saved Josh. I stood up, smiling lightly at Susan who seemed to glance at me, and turning my back to her so I could walk away. As soon as I reached the outdoors I took a deep breath, aiming at you while you slowly walked away with your hands in your pockets. 'Hé, douche bag.' You didn't seemed to give a sound again, you were totally ignoring me again. I pressed my jaws and walked fast towards you so I could grab your shoulder and pull your body to mine. 'I'm talking to you, freak. Why did you let Josh die? You could have saved him!' Nigel: Nigel had to suppres an amused smile when he heard Alex following him, as he had predicted, and he managed fairly well. Especially when Alex grabbed him and turned him around, at which Nigel could grant him with another cold but piercing stare. \"Could I, Alex?\" He cocked his head lightly, studying his roommate with an almost irritable pout. He couldn't stand the other's ignorance. \"You know why, there's no need to pretend you don't.\" Alex: 'Your hand almost touched his you stupid fuck. You could see Josh being so grateful when you extended your arm, and you pulled it back! Like you didn't even cared!' My voice began to shiver and the tune of my voice hit a wrong note, like I was going to cry any moment. Actually, my voice hit over because of all the anger. I wanted to kill you now, even though I wasn't that violent. 'What the hell are you talking about! Stay away from me. Get out of my life.' I pushed you away which made you almost fell over a fence. 'You don't know me! You don't know anything.' Nigel: At this Nigel actually smiled, unaffected by Alex' words or his anger. \"Out of your life? I'm not sure you want that..\" He stumbled backwards when he pushed him, but managed to grab himself at the fence he otherwise had fallen over. He looked at Alex and sneered, both annoyed as amused. \"..Face it, Alex..\" he mused, simply steadying himself and walking right after him. He walked up closer behind him again than Alex may have wished for. \"Raj doesn't need you anymore, after what you did to Josh.. You're all alone. Except for me. You're going to need me, Alex, weither you like it or not. ... You'll see, soon enough. I do know that.\" Alex: 'Trust me, I want you and all your stupid mindfucking stuff to get out of my mind. I don't know what you're doing to me, I don't know even why, but stay away from me!' I took a step backwards as you began to talk to me again. You seemed to be sure about the fact that I had to face the fact I needed him - which I obviously did not. You were a psycho. A freak which tried to make me crazy, just like you were. 'You're lying,' I said curtly. 'You're really fucked, you know that? You don't belong here. You belong in a psychological institute.' As you kept continuing his phrases I clenched my fists. Then, when you finally finished your last sentence, I hit you again in the face. 'Stop fucking with me! Stop with giving me these fucking lies!' Nigel: You'd expect someone to cringe at those words, or at least show any sign of offence. Nigel didn't. He just kept walking closer and closer to Alex, his lips pursed lightly in amusement. It was like he could feel Alex' fear, despite his tough act, and feeded on it. Got stronger. When he got pucnhed he finally backed off, grabbing his jaw at which already a bruise began to form. He smirked at him now. To have Alex call him a liar was highly ironic to Nigel. Already he knew he was the better liar of the two. \"So much violence, Alex.. But I'm not lying.. I guarantee it.\" Alex: I just couldn't do anything else then staring at him with a incomprehensible glance. Didn't you get it? Didn't you seemed to hear one word of what I just told you? 'And why is that Nigel? Why should I need you in my life? What do you have to afford me that I don't have. You're only taking things away from me. Is that what you want? Because you did it well, I've to admit.' I licked my lips, looking a bit around to find the right words to say right now. 'You're taking everything slowly away from me, from the day that you came in my life. And I still don't understand, but you seem to be able to dig in my mind. Stop that.' I looked serious at him, impendent also. 'If you want anything from me, just ask me, OK? I want this to end.' Nigel: \"Well you're intelligent Alex, unlike some around us. I suggest you figure it out.\" Nigel frowned and studied him when he claimed he took everything away from him. Didn't he even realize what he did? Didn't he realize he made Nigel a murderer..? Alex didn't seem to grasp the concept of sacrifice yet. \"Oh no, Alex.. You started this.. And we're going to finish is. Because the truth is, it's only just began.\" He smiled suddenly, boyish, almost genuine. \"You don't get it do you..? But you will.\" He walked past Alex, keeping his eyes on the other's face. \"You will.\" And just like that, he was gone again. Alex: I swallowed. I had really no idea what the hell you were doing. I knew only that you had found a way to enter my mind, and somehow, I need it sometimes. I had to admit that you made me so curious, but this had to end. You made me fell worthless, miserable. The way you smile almost killed me. As you passed by, staring at me with your piercing eyes of a hawk, I pressed my jaws again. I wasn't going to answer. Not any more. I kept staring right in front of me while I doubt about your words.[Chapter 3] Nigel: It was deep in the night when Nigel suddenly opened the door to Alex' - previously both their,- bedroom. He had been moved out after the incident with Josh.. But he didn't like it, even though he had expected he would. Alex didn't like it either, which surprised him even more, but he would never admit it to him. When he walked him he saw the other was sleeping, and he walked in gently, careful not to wake him yet. He sat down on the chair, which he often used to preoccupy whenever he was working on anatomies and such, only the other way around, so he could support and arms on the back of the chair. He sat there and he just stared at Alex, long enough to count the freckles on his face if he did the effort. He was just experimenting again... Alex had invaded his mind. Not long after Nigel had discovered he could invade his too. He wanted to know if he could wake him up with this particular gift. Alex: I went to bed very early today. I just didn't felt so well today. Everything became so different since the death of Josh - and Raj who suddenly considered ignoring entirely. I had my arms wrapped around my pillow while I lay with the left side of my face on it, covered underneath the warm covers. I didn't notice that Nigel came in, a little while ago. I didn't even notice that he was staring at me, until now. Like he waked me with his cold piercing eyes. I swallowed and opened my eyes slowly. My sigh came back, and my eyes began to focus slowly. I saw a shape of a body. I pressed myself a little bit up and frowned when I realized that it was Nigel who seemed to stare at me like some psycho no-lifer. 'Do you mind? What the hell do you think you're doing?' Nigel: He cocked his head when he actually got him to wake up, intrigued by the fact it worked, intrigued by Alex. \"I'm just.. checking something,\" he whispered. He got up from the chair and sat on the edge of his bed, then. He had the vague sense that he might be about to get hit again any moment, but he didn't seem to care. \"Just.. Relax..\" he said, suddenly putting a hand on Alex' chest to push him gently back down. \"You'll thank me for it later.\" He suddenly moved over then, and for a moment it seriously seemed like he was going to kiss Alex, but he didn't. He moved his forehead against his instead and closed his eyes to concentrate harder. Whatever it was of a creepy link between their minds, it seemed to get worse.. stronger.. Intense.. Like they were separated only by this thin transparent layer and trying to poke through. \"So close..\" Nigel whispered exhilarated, and Alex could feel his breath on the skin of his cheek. Nigel finally moved back then, if only for a little, to look at him, and he smiled brilliantly as he did. \"I knew it was you..\" Alex: 'You're checking something,' I repeated highly irritated. 'Why don't you check it another time? When I'm not sleeping and it's not fucking midnight.' Just as I wanted to turn my back again, Nigel suddenly came closer to sit on the edge of my bed. I frowned, doubting about what he was going do. It was pretty confusing - and scary - how he stared at me and came closer every second. I swallowed while watching you incomprehensible. It was probably only because I just woke up. If I really realized what he tried to do, I'd probably punched him again. I could see the lightly blue shade on his jawline. I gave him that when I hit him near the church. When he suddenly came so close that it looked like he was going to kiss me, I opened my mouth a bit to ask him what the hell he was going to do - but I swallowed the words back into my wondering soul. 'Too close,' I mumbled while frowning my eyebrows. I felt weak, somehow. I knew that I couldn't push him away, not now. It was like I almost liked this, the way he was so close. When he pulled his head a little bit back to stare me in the eyes I swallowed again and pressed my lips. 'What are you talking about...' My voice softly died, like I began to understand what he meant at my last word. I didn't wanted to believe him - also because I still didn't really understood it. Everything was too confusing. He probably tried to drive me crazy now I was on one of my weakest. Nigel: Nigel cocked his head, wondering about Alex' comment. He wasn't sure whether he meant too close physically, or mentally.. Nigel knew though, that if it was mentally, they could never be too close. If only he could pierce through the one last wall between them. \"I told you.. You'll understand soon enough. I'll make you understand if I have to.\" He raised his hand and put it at his shoulder, almost as if to comfort him. \"..and we'll be free.\" He smiled wicked again and then got up. \"Goodnight Alex.. I'll see you soon.\" He turned around again and left him on his own, vaguely amused by the fact he knew Alex wasn't going to catch much sleep any time soon. Alex: My head felt so incredibly strange, like some really tried to enter my mind, to control it. I pressed my lips as I stared at Nigel, almost emotionless like he got me hypnotized. I felt how his hand touched my shoulder, which made me come back to the normal world again. I swallowed, following him with my suspicious glance. 'We'll be free,' I repeated him while I tried to hid more of my body underneath the covers, like he was going to harm me. I didn't even took the effort to react on his last sentence, and I turned my body and face to the direction of the wall, staring at it like I was able to look right through it. I felt awoken, on a different and odd way. Nigel had found a way to dig into my mind. 'Lock the door,' I mumbled - what shouldn't make any sense. He was always able to enter my room. Nigel: The coming night's Nigel kept visiting, like he had that once, keeping Alex from his sleep. But repeating events are hard not to get used to. So after many arguments, Alex had given up the fight and let Nigel come back to his room as often as he pleased. Nigel happily took his advantage from that. He even did his experiments and taxidermy's in Alex' room again.. He could somehow better concentrate when Alex was closer. Like Alex was in his mind, secretly thinking with him, making him stronger. Alex had jerked his mouth irritably at this new habbit of Nigel but hadn't commanded him to leave the dead animals out of his room either.. Probably because he found it fascinating, in some morbid, sick way. More than once Nigel stayed up late, working at the desk once again, when Alex had already long gone to sleep. Nigel could feel Alex' eyes burning into his back when he worked but he kind of liked it.. At one night in particular, Nigel suddenly turned around halfway at his process to look at Alex. He had his eyes closed, had already fallen asleep it seemed. So Nigel walked up to him soundlessly. For a moment he reached out his hand and hovered it above Alex' face, but he didn't touch it.. Not really. It was like he was testing if Alex was awake to notice. When Alex didn't respond, he dropped his hand again, and softly left the room, suspiciously.. Only Alex hadn't been asleep.. he'd just been pretending.. And curiosity crept over him, about Nigel's suspicious behavior, about where he was going. Alex: I had hid myself in secret for a little while now. It looked like I was asleep, like I had those sweet dreams that were haunting me for weeks now. I dreamed about Nigel, almost every night what made sleeping uncomfortable. I could feel his breath on my skin, even in my smallest daydreams. How he feed himself with my fear, my curiosity and my mind. I could even feel his hand floating above my head with my eyes closed. As I heard him slowly snipping out of the room, I opened my eyes suspicious, while I looked around me like some kind of a raptor. I pushed myself up from the bed and stood up to follow him after I putted some clothes on as fast as I could - but still quiet as a mouse. I wondered what he was going to. Were he tried to go to. I pressed my lips so no one could hear me breathe. I wanted to follow him secretly, as a shadow hidden in the dark.[Chapter 4] Nigel: Nigel walked through the hallways, quiet as a fox, and he seemed to know exactly where he was going, on the contrary to Alex, for he wasn't headed to his own room. Halfway a corridor he suddenly stopped, though, giving Alex only just enough time to hide before Nigel turned around, as if he thought he heard something. For a moment he kept staring at the hall behind him but it appeared to be empty. So after a moment of deliberation he just shrugged it off and continued his journey. He came to a door eventually, one Alex had never been before, and went inside quietly, closing the door behind him. This was perhaps Alex' only chance to catch Nigel red-handed, whatever he was doing.. Why ever he wanted that. As Alex walked through the door it soon turned out it was simply another bedroom.. But not of a student, of Father Mcdonaldson, the religion-teacher. He was fast asleep and didn't wake up from Alex coming in. Next to the bed, on the table, there was a bottle of anesthetic. The same Alex used to drug Nigel to unconsiounce. The door behind Alex closed then and Nigel flipped on the light. \"I knew you'd be too curious to let it go..\" Nigel mused, walking closer. \"I'm glad you came.. See, you gave me my initiation by that prank on the train. ... now are you ready for yours?\" He lifted his hand, in which he held a knife, and offered it to you, casting a glance to the sleeping teacher. \"You know it has to be done..\" Alex: It scared the hell out of me, the times when Nigel suddenly stopped walking and I had to hide behind the first object I could find. I even fell one time, but Nigel didn't seemed to notice that - thank goodness. As I followed him on foot, I came into a room I'd never seen before. I swallowed, wondering what I was going to enter. It seemed to be a normal bedroom, but when I glanced at the man in the bed I frowned. Nigel stepped out of the darker side of the room which made only his face glow lightly. Then he closed the door and flipped on the light. 'What?' I asked incomprehensible. I glanced at the clean and shining knife he held in his hand while he was offering it to me. 'You want me kill?' I felt how my weakness came back again, how my throat got pinched by the fear that was running through my veins. But it wasn't only fear. It was also a rush, a adrenalin like I doubted if I should kill him. I licked my lips and glanced from him to the professor. I slowly shook my head. 'I can't.' Nigel: (assume this is after the basement scene. Because of some reason I forgot, we decided to skip that one) Nigel stared at you coldly, yet forcefully, as if only his eyes would be sufficient to make you do it. \"Yes you can, Jack .. You have to.\" When Alex didn't take the knife Nigel stepped closer and pressed the hand that held the knife against Alex' chest where he could no longer ignore it. \"And you know you want to. Each and every step for us to unite matters. This is one of them. ... Do it.\" he said pointedly now, in the tone of an order. The truth was, Nigel could never force Alex.. He wasn't the master of Alex. He was his pike, his weapon.. Alex was the knave that wielded him. And all Nigel wanted was for Alex to reach for that crown, take control. Alex: 'Don't call me Jack,' I corrected him. 'Don't let me go that far.' I looked him in the eyes - which almost begged him to keep me from taking the knife. I laid my hand down on his. I could feel my heartbeat through the knife and his hand. I pressed my lips while I tried to swallow, transporting away that terribly fear which haunted me for weeks now. 'Don't let me do this, Nigel. I'm not a killer. I don't... I can't...' I glanced at the teacher again, which laid petrified on the bed, like he was already dead. I felt the cold steel of the knife touching my hand. How it gave me a vision about me killing Father Mcdonaldson. How I tracked his artery in neck and cut it open to feel his warm blood touching my cold skin, dripping of the once so clean and shining steel. Precious rubies made out of blood. I pressed my jaws and bit on my lower lip, feeling how he teased me to kill. 'I beg you,' I whispered once again, so softly. Nigel: Nigel pursed his lips, annoyed with Alex fear, his weakness. Nigel didn't want Alex to be afraid, it was not his aim at all. All he wanted was for Alex to see the truth, to see that they were chosen, and that Alex was the key to that.. Alex had to take on his faith. \"You have no choice, Jack\" he said mercilessly, but he didn't let go of the knife when Alex took it, his hand still touching his. It didn't make any sense. If he wanted Alex to take the knife and do it, why didn't he just let go of it? He stepped closer, speaking close to Alex ear as he did more often. \"It's time for you to wield your weapon..\" Nigel wasn't talking about the knife, that's why he didn't let go. He was talking about another weapon entirely. \"It's time for you to wield your pike.\" Alex: I could feel his warm breath touching my skin again, how his words found a way into my head to mess with me. I swallowed while I stared emotionless to the point in front of me. Like I stared at nothing. The touch of his hand made my skin burn, like the knife went right through his and my hand. I pressed my lips and closed my eyes for a moment. 'I can't wield a weapon that doesn't deserves to be in my weak hands. You should do it if you think it's our destiny - if you want him to be dead so badly.' I grabbed his jawline softly to turn his face to mine, like I was going to kiss him when I glanced at his pursed lips what made me purse mines. 'You should waste his blood.' I sheaf my fingers into his for a few seconds, like I actually stroked his hand. 'You've to kill him.' Nigel: Nigel doesn't answer, just flicks his attention up look at Alex when he turns his head - blue eyes laughing dark lashes. The look of complicity. After a moment, Nigel's gaze drops and he nods at the professor. \"His blood won't be wasted.. It's your destiny as much as it's mine. Alex is who you were. But you're not weak anymore. You're Jack now.\" Nigel could feel Alex' hand moving over his, giving him the order. He managed to look satisfied, though without smiling, and nodded his head. \"As you wish..\" He finally stepped away from Alex then towards the teacher. He held the knife above his chest, dangling over the exact place where his heart should be, - as anatomist Nigel should know, - and he looked up at Alex. \"..together,\" he offered, wanting you to hold the knife along with him. Alex: As his blue eyes stared at me, I held my breath for a moment - not knowing what he was going to answer now. His eyes pointed at the professor, who still lay on the bed like he slept as a rose. I pressed my lips together when he began to talk again. I wasn't Alex any more, in his opinion. I'd become Jack now. I felt my life was becoming a big lie now. Nigel shoved is hand back while he whispered the words that made my heart relieved, somehow. I still didn't wanted to be a part of this, a part of murder. But Nigel seemed to rule over my mind, he had found all of my weakness and knew how to handle them. I dropped my hand when I saw him slowly walking to the bed, holding the knife in his pale hand like they were one. I chucked my head, lifting up my chin as I stared at him, waiting for him to do it. My shoulders were tense, but still dropped down like the attitude of a bum. Suddenly he glanced at me again with his glowing blue eyes, which had no mercy - like he really thought that we had to do this. I swallowed, but choked almost in my saliva. I slowly stepped towards to him, still doubting about what I had to do. I should be a part of this anyway, he should kill him anyway. I extended my arm and wrapped my fingers slowly around his while looking him in the eyes. I pressed my lips and glanced at the professor again. 'What about the evidence?' I asked so soft that it probably wouldn't be audible. Now I just had to wait for Nigel, who should push the cold steel straight through the professor his skin and flesh. Nigel: \"There will be no evidence..\" Nigel muttered, and then pushed down the knife in the poor man's heart, with surprisingly much strength, gushing blood over both their hands. The professor's body started to twist in pain, his eyes opened in panic, but the drugs were still in his system, and so he suffered soundlessly, apart from the gurgling sounds coming from his throat. The twisting lasted for at least a minute and then the body became still entirely, not even breathing anymore. It was the most strange and intense feeling. Taking someone's life.. And sharing it with Alex made it even stronger. Nigel smiled, closing his eyes for a moment to let the feeling overwhelm him, and then pulled back the knife. \"I'm proud of you, Jack.\" Alex: He didn't give me the opportunity to let the words sink into my mind. He already pushed the knife through the pour man his heart - and I could admit, I felt how I helped him. I felt how the blood gushed over our hands, how it filled the spaced between his and my hand. I swallowed, staring at the man who began to twist heavily without a sound. Only the gurgling sounds of his lungs that filled themselves with blood broke the silence. After a minute, the body stopped with twisting and he didn't seemed to breathe any more. I felt how Nigel took the knife out of the body, which made a flesh-cutting sound. I dropped my hand on the body of the professor, on his wound that still bled. I could feel the tears coming up in my eyes, but I couldn't cry. I glanced at Nigel again, who had this smirk on his face that almost scared me. I slowly shook my head, not knowing what I had to say right now. I was speechless. Nigel: He smiled intriguing and walked around the bed towards Alex, closing the space between them. \"Don't be afraid,\" he whispered in a soothing yet sinister voice. \"You did well..\" Nigel lifted his hand and touched Alex' cheek to make the other look back at him. He didn't seem to care about the fact he was getting blood on Alex' cheek now. \"You'll see that what happened here is a good thing.. Now go back to bed. I'll take care of the evidence.\" Alex: I tilted my head after I glanced back at the professor his lifeless body. He was dead, really dead. I killed a human being. I pursed my lips as I suddenly felt Nigel his warm fingertips on my cheek. I flexed my jaws seeing how he came closer again. His breathe stroked along my skin that was clammy now. Without answering, I glanced at my hands. They were read, like the rubies I thought of before. I slowly lifted up my hands and laid them down on my face after I closed my eyes. I didn't wanted to believe what happened. My face became even more covered with blood now, and I slowly stroked my fingertips from my forehead down to my chin while staring at Nigel like he were a ghost. How could he ask me to go back to sleep after this? I looked incomprehensible at my hands again, like I finally noticed what I'd done to my face. 'You made me a monster,' I whispered with a blank stare. Nigel: Nigel frowns openly, that expression only deepening by what Alex has just implied. His gaze flickers to Alex's beckoning hand and then back up to his companion's face. \"I made you complete,\" Nigel corrected, and he smiled again. \"To unite us it's only proper to unite yourself first, isn't it?\" He studied Alex and suddenly leaned in to Nigel with a sneer on his face and a challenging eyebrow raised. \"Ow come on.. I know you enjoyed it. You may not want to, but you did. You can't hide your thoughts from me, Jack.\" Alex: I tilted my head again, glancing once again at the body from the professor. His light grey nightgown had turned into dark red around his chest, and I sniffed which made me able to smell the iron-rich blood that had covered my face. Nigel was right. I had visions about this. I'd even dreamed about this, about me killing innocent people what gave me such a rush. I blinked a few times now, like I came back to this world, and I stared at Nigel his face for a few seconds. 'Let's clean this mess up before someone catch us.' I grabbed the covers of the professor his bed to clean my face and hands and glanced at Nigel again. 'I'm sure I can't sleep tonight anyway.' I stroked with a hand through my hair and shook my head while nibbling on my lower lip. 'Fuck,' I mumbled. How did Nigel want to clean this stuff up? Nigel: Nigel looked at Alex and pursed his lips. Nigel had a very specific way of cleaning things. He couldn't handle the smallest flaw in whatever was to be entirely clean and tidy. So he shook his head and put his hand on Alex' shoulder. Pulling him gently back. \"Just go clean yourself then, properly.. and wait outside or go to bed, It won't be long.\" He smiled assuring and gestured towards the door, hoping Alex would take this offer anyway. Alex: I pressed my lips for a few seconds. I could hear a hysterical tune in Nigel his voice, somehow. He had to do it properly, I could notice that. I pressed my jaws and took a few steps backwards while nodding slowly. 'Sure,' I said quietly. Suddenly I began to frown lightly. 'What is your plan Nigel? They are going to miss him, and you can't hide the body here. They will search for it.' I tilted my head. I couldn't keep my small smirk away now, like I almost loved it to see Nigel in trouble - even though that I was just as guilty as he was. I loved the feeling of fear, fear of being trapped, to be correctly. Nigel: Nigel nodded, but seemed to discard the problem immodestly, gently leading Alex back towards the door. \"They will search for it.. But they won't find it.\" Once he got Alex out of the room into the hall he grabbed the doorknob and gave Alex one final look. \"Go wash yourself.. But be quiet. Then go to bed, I'll follow you after. I promise.\" He closed the door then, leaving Alex on his own.. well.. sort of. Nigel was always still in Alex' head.[Chapter 5] Nigel: It was at least an hour later when Nigel came back into Alex' room, clean this time, and he looked down to Alex who was back in bed like he had been before. \"Are you still awake?\" Nigel whispered and he sat down on the edge of Alex' bed, looking at his face in the dark. Alex: I opened my eyes when I heard someone walking down the hall. I had no idea who it was, and somehow I felt a gust of freezing cold stroking along my body, like a unpleasant fear. When I heard the door slowly getting opened, I closed my eyes again, pretending to sleep. When I suddenly felt how someone took a seat on the edge of my bed, I opened my eyes slightly. 'I am,' I whispered when I noticed that it was Nigel his face hanging above him. I swallowed and pressed myself a little bit upright. 'How did it went? Is he gone?' Nigel: \"It's taken care off..\" Nigel muttered. He studied Alex for a moment and then lifted his hand, softly brushing back the locks of hair in front of Alex forehead with his fingertips. \"No one will ever know it was us.\" He cocked his head and smiled, mockingly boyish again. \"You can't sleep, can you?\" he whispered, almost amused somehow. Alex: 'How surprisingly that you noticed,' I answered almost mockingly. Of course I couldn't fall asleep like there was nothing happened. I just killed somebody. This was probably going to take a long time till I would be able to sleep normally again - which I didn't after Nigel's appearance. The way he stroked through my hair made me purse my lips a little bit. It was an odd, but at the same time such an amazing feeling. I frowned lightly and pressed my lips. I had to be honest that I doubted about Nigel his disposition. Sometimes it looked like he was gay - to be honest. I swallowed while I kept staring him in the eyes. I had to be honest. It was like he made me feel gay. I frowned while thinking about that - but he probably couldn't see that. Nigel: Both his smile as the ominous look in his eyes remained unaffected by Alex' sarcasm entirely, all he did was raising his eyebrows slightly in a questionable glance. \"Do you need me to help out with that? I can get you to sleep.. .. Without the anesthetic of course.\" He continued to stare at Alex almost cheerfully, but this smile disappeared entirely when he suddenly caught something, a flair of Alex' mind. He leant closer, looking the other straight in the eyes. \"We're not lovers,\" he explained quietly. \"We're so much more significant than just that, much more important too.\" Alex: I raised my eyebrows, just as he did, and stared at him with questionable stare. How did he want to get me fall asleep? I began to grin slightly when I thought of him singing a lullaby - what wouldn't work of course, but it should be quite amusing. 'What's your plan? How can you make me fall asleep?' If he really thought about singing, I would probably only laugh at him. He didn't looked like a good singer to me. His voice was softy, and odd on a special way. I pressed my lips softly, thinking about the things I thought right now. It was odd, strange, and weird. As he suddenly came even closer to me, I thought he was going to kiss me, this time for real. I stared him in the eyes as I felt how his nose softly touched mines for a second, and I swallowed. 'What do you mean?' I dared to ask. I couldn't keep myself from glancing a couple of times from his bright blue eyes to his lips. 'What do you mean with we're so much more significant than just that ?' Nigel: He studied Alex surprised expression and grinned, his eyes narrowing in challenging way. \"You don't believe me?\" he asked, not moving away from you as he did usual after nearing you so closely. \"What will I get when I get you to fall asleep?\" He pursed his lips, half amused, half annoyed, when Alex asked him what he meant. \"I think you know.. And if not, you'll find out.\" Alex: 'What do you want me to give you?' My voice was soft and my stare tight. I really couldn't get my eyes away from his bright blue eyes now, which stared at me like I was prey. I pressed my eyes and swallowed. His breath kept stroking my cheeks and his expression the same. I still couldn't understand him. Because my mouth was on the height of his neck now, I pressed myself a little bit up so I could watch him properly. My hand lay on his back for a few seconds. Even though it was probably the most stupid thing ever, I tried to enter his mind to search for the answer. I probably only didn't understood him because I didn't wanted to. I didn't want to face the \"truth\". 'I doubt that.' I pulled my arm back and pressed myself up again so my head would lay back down on the pillow. I did it slowly, because I didn't wanted to touch any piece of his body with mines, like his touch was lethal for me. Again I swallowed. There was a silence now that I actually didn't wanted to have here. Not now. I glanced at the door for a moment, which was closed and seemed to be one with the wall. After I glanced back at Nigel, I placed my hand on his jawline, like I was going to push him away from me - but somehow I couldn't because of that glance. My lips were pursed softly, and my eyebrows frowned lightly. 'You've to tell me.' Nigel: He pursed his lips thoughtfully, making up something that could come in handy. He smiled the moment he did. \"A guarantee ..\" Nigel mused. \"If I prove you I can get you to sleep easily, I want you to guarantee me, that you'll come with me, the next time I ask for a night trip.\" He let a silence fall, allowing, - or perhaps forcing,- Alex to think over it himself. When Alex didn't seem prepared to give an answer any time soon he sighed softly, disappointed, but he didn't urge on about it. His lips just parted slightly when Alex touched his jawline and he kept looking at the other with a piercing gaze. \"I don't have to tell you..\" he whispered and then he opened up his mind for the other, telling him exactly what he meant, but through their minds. 'We're not lovers.. We're eachother's destiny. Alone, you are just a knave, and I am just a pike. Together, we make something bigger, something stronger. When you're ready to embrace it. We will be one.' Alex: I stared at him and nodded slowly. I would guarantee that I would come with him, probably. My glance was emotionless now, like it was my turn to stare straight through his head. I bit my lower lip and turned my head away when I suddenly felt how he entered my head again. I blinked a few times and took my hand back. 'Like one soul split in two bodies,' I concluded him. That was what it meant after all, in my opinion. I sniffed and glanced back at him again. 'I guarantee you,' I answered him while staring him in the eyes again. 'You should go to sleep too, by the way.' I pulled the sheets up to my chin and glanced away then. 'You've such a terrible stare sometimes,' I mumbled. Nigel: Nigel nodded his head, glad he finally understood and pleased he made the promise he'd come with him. \"Something like that, yes..\" He tried to keep his eyes on Alex' face, but he didn't manage for long since Alex turned away from him. He was about to ask what was wrong when he mentioned the stare, at that he chuckled softly, a rare but not a bad sound. \"I know.. But you like it that way.\" he concluded, sure of his case. \"Now let me get you to sleep, where my stares won't reach you.\" He opened his mind again, connecting to Alex, and he used the same method as waking Alex up, as to get him to sleep. \"Goodnight, Jack.\" For a moment Nigel could swear Alex was going to curse at him for calling him Jack, but he was probably to tired for that, because the next second he slipped away. Nigel smiled content and studied Alex for a few minutes after, as if he was something more precious than anything else in the world, and then he laid down on the bed next to him and buried his face in Alex' neck, slowly falling asleep himself. ","Summary":" Hi everyone! A year ago I started to RPG with a friend. I play Alex Forbes, and a friend of mine pl"},{"Movie":"Beverly Hills Chihuahua","Title":"Siempre estuviste aquí","Author":"Topo Len","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13110824","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Si todo empezará de nuevo ... .. . ¿Qué ocurre, princesa? Te ves decaída Lo siento Delgado- la pequeña chica suspiro mientras miraba a su fiel amigo, su compañero y su más valioso confidente- es solo que he estado un poco... pensativa. ¿Es por Papi?- directo y sin rodeos. Al estilo Delgado. La chica palidecio y afirmo con la cabeza tristemente. Él ya lo sabía. La conocía perfectamente. No por nada eran amigos desde hace años. Se conocieron cuando ella, en palabras de Delgado, solo era una \"tierna y adorable cachorrita\". Un incidente extraño fue lo que los unió de por vida. Delgado era un jóven que recién estaba cumpliendo su sueño: ser parte de la policia. Rondaba por la edad de los 22 años. Por otra parte, Chloe apenas y rozaba con los 15 años. Era la típica chica rica. Presumida, mandona y alborotada. Sí- su ondulado cabello blanco se meció un poco con el viento. Dio un sorbo a su bebida y desvió el contacto visual con el hombre frente a ella. Conozco a Papi, él no te haría daño- comenzó con sus conjeturas- entonces, ¿Qué es lo que te inquieta? Papi va demasiado rápido- se sincero- es cierto que me agrada estar con él y por eso mismo decidí darle una oportunidad, pero a veces me sofoca. Cuanto había cambiado todo. La caprichosa Chloe de hace siete años se había transformado totalmente. Delgado tomo su mano, procurando no exceder el límite que él mismo se impuso años atras. ¿Lo has hablado con él? Lo he intentado- ella correspondió su tacto. El calor de Delgado siempre le había gustado, desde que lo conoció todo en él la maravillo. Gracias a él pudo cambiar y madurar. Siempre estaria infinitamente agrecida por eso- pero siempre es el mismo resultado. Parece que no me escucha y me siento harta de eso. Princesa- sonrió. Si, siempre que la llamaba de ese modo se sentía feliz- no me quiero meter en tu vida amorosa, pero no creo que él te convenga- desde el comienzo nunca le agrado el eterno enamorado de Chloe, de su princesa. ¡Ay, Delgado! Yo también se que no me conviene, pero lleva insistiendome todos estos años y cortarlo tajantemente despues de apenas dos meses... Él sabía a lo que se te atenía. Tu fuiste clara desde el comienzo. Voy a pensarlo. Por ahora- se levanto y comenzó a jalarlo animada- ¡¿Quién quiere una buena ronda de karaoke?! Delgado bufó. No es que odiara cantar pero si podía evitarlo, mejor para él. Sin embargo, al ver esos ojitos suplicantes y esa hermosa sonrisa de felicidad no tuvo más remedio que aceptar. Eres mi perdición Chloe-susurro para sí. La miro animada preparar todo para el karaoke. Nuevamente estaba auto torturandose. Nuevamente haciendo caso omiso a sus sentimientos. Si todo empezará de nuevo...-suspiro- no te dejaría ir jamás. ¡Listo! Hay que empezar. Claro- se acerco apenado. ¿Qué clase de cosas estaba pensando? Chloe es su mejor amiga, su confidente, su protegida. Jamás podría pasar algo entre ellos. Jamás. Jamás. Jamás. ¿Delgado? ¿Estás bien?- sin darse cuenta se despegó del mundo real. Los ojos oscuros de la peliblanca lo miraban con preocupación. Hermosa...-susurro. Desde el primer momento en que la vio, lo supo. Ella era lo más hermoso que habia visto en su vida. Su tez era tan palida. Parecía de porcelana. Su cabello tan blanco como la nieve y en medio de toda esa tormenta, unas grandes esferas negras y brillosas resaltaban. Oh, Delgado- se sonrojo violentamente. Su pálida piel no hacía más que resaltar ese sonrojo- ¿Qué cosas dices? Lo que veo- respondió simplemente y comenzó a distraerse con las canciones que había disponibles en la rocola. El corazón de Chloe se aceleró. Tomo el brazo de delgado y comenzó a ver también las canciones. Se pegó a él, dejando que su calor y su aroma la impregnara totalmente. Tú también eres muy guapo, Delgado, no se porque no tienes novia aún- comento como si nada, observando con diversion el sonrojo del oficial. Yo no estoy hecho para esas cosas- suspiró. Aunque lo estuviera, la chica con la que quería estar ahora estaba en una relación. Había sido lento, muy lento. Todos lo estamos- le contradijo y decidió observarlo. Ninguna mujer se fijaría en un hombre tan grande como yo. ¡Solo tienes 29, Delgado! Aparte eres muy atractivo- sentía su sonrojo crecer pero no se detendría. Debía decirle todos sus buenos puntos- Eres un hombre muy agradable y protector. Siempre tienes algo interesante que contar y das los mejores consejos. Tú calidez es impresionante, cada que estoy cerca de ti me siento bien. Y, por favor, ¡mírate! eres todo un oficial sexy, incluso mis amigas me suplican como locas una cita contigo. Tu piel morena más tu increíble condición física es impresionante. Incluso tu altura es imponente. ¿Cuánto habías dicho que medías? ¿1.90? Chloe-susurro. A cada frase sentía su corazón latir con prisa. Y lo peor de todo es que sentía a su pequeña princesa acercarse más y más. Podría controlarse si estuvieran en un lugar público, pero estaban en la mansión de la familia de Chloe, los dos convenientemente solos. ¡Y tu voz! ¡También es impresionante! Puede ser ruda y seca en varias ocasiones pero cuando te lo propones suena muy dulce. Tus ojos brillan tanto cuando haces o hablas de lo que te gusta y eres tan humilde y maravilloso. Eres... Chloe... para- gruño por lo bajo y ella se tapo la boca con sus manos mientras se alejaba- ¿Princesa?- la llamo preocupado. Eres el hombre de mis sueños- susurro lo que por tantos años se negó. Delgado no pudo más. Tomo a la pequeña chica de apenas 1.50 de estatura entre sus fuertes brazos y la pegó a él. Ni siquiera escucho lo que dijo o tal vez se negó a hacerlo pero apenas vió una lágrima correr por sus mejillas su instinto lo guío. ¿Del...gado? ¿Escuchaste lo que dije? -estaba temblando. No-se relajo- no lo hice, princesa. Qué alivio-suspiro, mientras se aferraba a él y lloraba en su hombro. Al fin lo hizo, despues de tantos años reconoció que estaba enamorada de su mejor amigo, de su confidente, de su protector. ¿Qué pasaría ahora?[Chapter 2] No grato ... .. . ¡Lo siento, llego tarde!-corriendo y algo agitada hizo aparición la pequeña chica. Había olvidado por completo su cita con su novio. Se incómodo de tan solo pensarlo. ¿Papi y ella de verdad eran novios ahora? No te preocupes, hermosa- la tomo de la cintura y le planto un casto beso en los labios- esperaría por ti todo el tiempo que fuera. Suspiró y le lanzó una suave sonrisa. ¿Algo ocurre? No, nada- tomo su brazo y comenzaron a andar. ¿Cómo estuvo tu semana cariño? Todo este tiempo no pudimos vernos. ¡Oh! Lo de siempre, no hubo nada interesante- se mordió el labio nerviosa. Claro, Chloé, síguele mintiendo. Ya veo, debes estar cansada. ¿Quieres tomar algo aquí? Escuché que preparan unos jugos deliciosos. ¡Me encantaría! Y, Papi, ¿qué tal tu semana?- se sentaron en una mesa libre del lugar, esperando que los atendieran. ¡Llena de trabajo para este gran hombre!- lleno de orgullo sonrió mostrando sus aperlados dientes. Ciertamente Papi no era el chico mas atractivo, pero si había algo que lo hacía destacar era esa sonrisa de ensueño, llena de felicidad y compromiso. Tienes una sonrisa muy bonita- comento de la nada mientras miraba el menú. Eres encantadora- susurro embelesado, con los colores a mil bailando en su rostro apiñonado. Chloé fingió no escuchar pero sintió sutilmente los colores subiendo por su rostro. Un sonrojo ligero, pero significativo para el hombre frente a ella. Sin embargo, dudo que Papi me pueda hacer sonrojar como Delgado. ¡Bum! Una cachetada mental y ahora si, los colores a mil sobre su rostro marfil. Ofuscada ocultó su sonrojo huyendo al baño del lugar. Se cercioró de que no hubiese nadie y suspiro amargamente. ¿Qué estoy pensando? Se reprimió. Su corazón se sentía pesado cada que recordaba los eventos del día de ayer. ¿Qué nada paso? ¡Claro! a otro perro con ese hueso. Por fin se dió cuenta de lo que había negado por años. ¿Desde hace cuánto que estaba enamorada de Delgado? haciendo cuentas no lo sabía. Tal vez desde que hablaron por primera vez. No , sacudió la cabeza, fue desde antes, fue desde que lo miró. El sonido de la puerta la alerto. Asustada se encerró en un baño, esperando que quien sea que haya entrado hiciera lo mismo y pudiera salir. Oye, ¿lo viste? Es de quién te he hablado. ¡Es guapísimo! ¡Súper guapo! Aunque el pequeño tampoco estaba mal. ¿Pequeño? Se cuestionó. Cuándo entramos al restaurante sólo estaban otras dos parejas. Seguro entró alguien mientras no estaba. Ni te hagas ilusiones- una tercera voz- \"el pequeño\" esta saliendo con Chloé. ¡¿Qué?! ¿Hablas de Chloé, la actriz? La misma. Los he visto pasear por ahí. Pero- esa fue la primera chica- yo pense que tenía algo con el grandote. También los he visto muchas veces juntos. ¡Jo! ¿No será que está con ambos? ¡Que zorra! Bueno, ya sabes lo que dicen de las actrices. Nada las complace. ¡Que cosas tan interesantes hablaban de mí, señoritas!- molesta salió del baño donde se encerro. Las chicas facil le llevaban veinte o treinta centímetros, pero no por eso iba a dejarse intimidar- sigan, sigan, parecían divertirse mucho, ¿no?- termino de lavar sus manos y peinar su cabello. No... nosotras- intento excusarse. Tranquilas, no estoy molesta. Me encuentro acostumbrada a que- las miró de pies a cabeza- personas como ustedes quieran inventarse chismes sobre mí- sabía que eso desencanderia algo muy malo, así que apenas cerro la puerta apresuró el paso para llegar a su mesa. Y tal cual lo predijo, ahí estaban. Hola, princesa- saludo el oficial- espero que no te moleste que interrumpa tu cita. ¡Para nada!- exclamó entre feliz y nerviosa. Miró de reojo a Papi. Estaba mirándolos seriamente. No importa, ¿verdad?- Papi tomo de la muñeca a Cloeh y la jaló sutilmente a él- le estaba comentando a Delgado que, de todos modos, pronto nos iremos, ¿cierto? Pero si acabamos de llegar- haciendo un puchero lo miró con las cejas levemente fruncidas. Papi suspiro cansinamente y después sonrió. No puedo decirte que no con esa carita. Oh... - Delgado no era tonto. Sabía que Papi siempre estuvo celoso de la relación tan cercana que ha mantenido con Chloé, pese a que ellos don amigos de infancia- creo que ocasione un pequeño inconveniente. Será mejor retirarme. ¡No... Delg...! Sí- la interrumpió- no es por correrte, compañero, pero hace mucho tiempo que no veo a mi dulce novia y quería estar un rato a solas con ella. No te preocupes- el moreno la miro con una sonrisa forzada- nos veremos luego, princesa. Sí- sus ojos le pedían \"Llévame contigo\", pero el era todo un caballero. No podía arrebatar a la princesa de su príncipe- Adiós. Él era esa clase de hombre. Desde que la conoció hubo algo en ella que lo hechizo. Nunca supo que, pero nacía en el protegerla. Ella era tan delicada y dulce como una muñequita de porcelana y él tan duro como un pedazo de acero. Siendo de mundos tan distintos, lo único que podía hacer era cuidarla y velar por su bien. Ser su fiel guardian, su cabellero día y noche. Un caballero no puede quedarse con la princesa. Pensó mientras se alejaba. Papi es más de su mundo y él le adora. ¿Acaso tú no la adoras también? La voz de su conciencia atacó. Suspiró cansado y dió paso veloz a su apartamento. ¡Eso fue muy grosero, Papi! Pero, cariño... solo quería un momento a solas contigo terroncito. Delgado solo iba a comer un rato con nosotros y después se iría. Lo conozco muy bien, él no quería interrumpirnos de ese modo. Pero... ¡Nada de peros!- tomo aire- ordenemos algo y comamos, ¿ok? De acuerdo. Ninguno se atrevió a decirle algo al otro hasta que salieron del restaurante. ¿Quieres ir a algún lugar en específico, mi terroncito?- rodó los ojos. ¿Cuántas veces había escuchado ese apodo? Sin duda miles. Me siento cansada- se excuso- creo que me iré a mi casa. Lo siento, Papi. Oh... - su expresión cambio de inmediato, pasando de la felicidad al desconcierto y finalmente la tristeza- ¿Quieres que te acompañe, mi amor? No- negó con una suave sonrisa- puedo ir yo sola. Oh... insisto, por favor. Bien- tomó la mano del chico y comenzaron a andar. No podía ser tan despiadada con Papi. Pasados unos minutos se armó de valor. Disculpa por la escena de hace rato, es solo que me molestó el hecho de que corrieras a Delgado de ese modo. Disculpa, Chloé, es solo que... no pude contenerme. Delgado siempre te mirá de una manera tan... ¡Ah! solo no puedo tolerarlo. Delgado me mirá normal. Tal vez tu lo veas así, pero yo soy un hombre y me doy cuenta de lo que otros hombres sienten. Él te mira como si fueras el centro de su universo. No... -su sonrojo iba creciendo, al igual que el ritmo de los latidos de su corazón. ¿El centro de su universo? ¿Qué cosas dices? Y yo simplemente no puedo soportarlo. No quiero perderte, Chloé. Siempre he estado enamorado de ti, desde niños. No sé como, antes era insoportable. Para mí siempre fuiste increíble. Papi, admítelo, yo era una malcriada, lo fui durante mucho tiempo hasta que...- se calló de pronto. No debía mencionarlo, no ahora. Lo sé. Hasta que conociste a Delgado. Se que es un buen hombre, Chloé, el te ayudó a madurar muchisimo y tu lo ayudaste a superar algunas cosas del pasado, ¿no? Y se que, por más celos que me den, la relación que hay entre ustedes jamás podrá romperse, sin embargo, ahora somos novios, y quiero que me trates como tal. Como tu novio. Yo... lo siento. ¿Porqué te disculpas? Creó que aún no estoy lista para tratarte como quieres, Papi. No te preocupes- tomo su mentón suavemente y la acercó a él- esperare el tiempo que sea necesario. He esperado por años, ¿no? Eres un tonto, Papi- rió suavemente. Su corazón dolía y en su estómago tiernas mariposas revoloteaban. Pero bueno, este es el momento perfecto para que te bese, ¿no?- se acercó lentamente. Aún no- se alejó- lento, ¿vale? Vale- sonrió- será como quieras, mi terroncito. A partir de aquí- se zafó de su agarre- puedo ir sola. ¡Bye!- sin esperar tiempo a respuestas se echó a correr con la esperanza de que no la siguiera. Su cabeza estaba revuelta y su corazón pedía a gritos una respuesta. Después de unos minutos de correr, decidió ir a pie, disfrutando de la paz de la tarde en las pacíficas calles de Beverly Hills. Se colocó sus audífonos y decidió perderse en sus canciones. Dar un respiro a sus emociones y solo dejarse llevar por la melodía. Mientras más se acercaba a su casa, más vislumbraba una figura. ¿Será? Su expresión se volvió una de horror total cuando pudo reconocerlo. Se giró y comenzó a correr a todo lo que sus piernas daban pero ya era muy tarde. Él ya se había percatado de su presencia. Pero vamos, ¿porqué huyes de mí? ¡Déjame en paz! No tengo nada que ver contigo. ¿Ah no? Te recuerdo que tenemos una cuenta por saldar, niña. No me iré de aquí hasta que me pagues. Dime cuánto quieres y te lo daré pero vete cuanto antes. Oh no- con brusquesa la tomo de la muñeca, azotandola fuertemente contra la pared- sabes bien que no es dinero lo que quiero. ¡D-Dejame!- exclamó mientras lo pateaba, pero en él no surtiría efecto. Esta vez tu amiguito policía no vendrá a salvarte. Estás sola, así que arreglemos nuestros asuntos de una vez. ¡Lárgate!- los años no habían pasado en vano. Sabía que era asechada, no solo por él, también por fans locos o enemigos de su familia. Ya no era la niña tonta de antes. ¡Vuelve aquí, perra!- escupió con rabia, pero ella no hizo caso. Solo corrió y corrió, al único lugar donde sabía que podía estar segura. Su enemigo tardaría de cinco a diez minutos en levantarse, así que sin perder tiempo marco un número aceleradamente. Princesa, ¿qué pasa? ¡¿Dónde estás?!- su voz pendía de un hilo. Llena de miedo y adrenalina. ¿Qué ocurre? ¡Voy para allá! Estoy camino a tu apartamento. Por la ruta de siempre. Chloé- la llamó seriamente- ¿Qué paso? Es él. ¡El diablo volvió![Chapter 3] Hola! Se que ha pasado bastante tiempo, pero la verdad es que no me sentía inspirada ni motivada. Pasaron varias cosas y no podía escribir, pero ayer, dos personitas me enviaron un review que me motivo bastante y me puse manos a la obra, exprimiendo lo que pudiera de inspiración. Este capítulo es gracias a ustedes y sus reviews. Espero lo disfruten! Lovingdog Beberihills fan En marcha ... .. . Miedo. Preocupación. Odio. Furia. Una oleada de emociones lo atacó. Sus compañeros de trabajo lo miraron asustados. Solo habían visto a Delgado una vez así en su vida y sabían que la historia podría estar repitiéndose, así que lo dejaron partir sin decir nada. Si era algo grave, él los llamaría. ¡Delgado!- grito cuando lo miró. Sus pies estaban rojos y dolidos debido al haber corrido con tacones tanto tiempo. De su rostro corrían pequeñas gotitas de sudor y sus ojos mostraban miedo y desesperación. ¡Princesa!- la tomo entre sus brazos y la cargo. Sin perder tiempo echó a correr a su apartamento y una vez pasada la adrenalina del momento ambos se miraron pidiendo explicaciones y apoyo. Venía regresando de mi cita con Papi- comenzó sabiendo que Delgado querría detalles- iba por el camino de siempre. La calle estaba muerta y me pareció ver una figura a lo lejos. Primero pensé que sería Ray, mi manager, por eso avance sin miedo, pero cuando pude ver bien su figura ya era demasiado tarde. Me tomó de la muñeca y me azotó contra la pared. Pude zafarme gracias al gas pimienta que cargaba en mi bolso y después de eso me fui corriendo y te marqué. Me alegra saber que actuaste rápido- la felicitó revolviendo su cabello con ternura- ¿Cómo te sientes princesa? Solo me duelen un poco los pies. Fue un mal día para elegir usar tacones- rió bajito mientras se quitaba los huaraches y sobaba sus talones. Le avisaré a tu familia. Tú deberías marcarle a tus amigos y a Papi. Delgado...- lo llamó en un susurro. ¿Sí? ¿Pasará lo mismo que hace tres años? No. Esta vez sera diferente- su mandíbula crujió- te juró que lo atrapare y no dejaré que vuelva a acercarse de nuevo a ti. No quiero que te arriesgues. Es mi trabajo- sintió como lo tomaba por la espalda y lo abrazaba con fuerza. ¡Casi pierdes la vida, Delgado!- sus pequeñas manitas acariciaron su espalda por debajo de su camisa. Él moreno tuvo que esforzarse por contener suspiros. Chloé... - no pudo evitarlo. Su voz gruesa y ronca la sobresaltó. Esta cicatriz es prueba de eso- sus pequeños dedos acariciaban la extensa cicatriz en la espalda del oficial, aprovechando también para darle pequeñas caricias inocentes en los alrededores. Debo de irme. De acuerdo- se detuvo y se alejo un poco. Lo miró con una sonrisa- estaré bien. Lo sé- la miró fijamente- yo te enseñe a defenderte, princesa. Se que estaras bien. Entonces, ¿porqué estas tan preocupado? No tardaré- hizo caso omiso a su pregunta. La puerta se abrió tan rápido como se cerró. Chloé se tumbó en la enorme cama de Delgado. Tanto fue el impacto que su olor se desprendió y un sonrojo enorme le adorno todo el rostro. Debería llamarlos- susurró. Sus amigos de la universidad. Su maganer. A Papi. Una hora exacta pasó en lo que Delgado llego. Hora que aprovechó para informar a todos sus allegados, despidiendose con la simple advertencia de que no la buscarán. ¿Qué dijeron en mi casa? Se preocuparon bastante pero se relajaron cuando les dije que yo te cuidaría. Confían bastante en ti. Los años me avalan- sonrió y se sonrojo al recordar lo que la madre de Chloé le había dicho. ¿Te sonrojaste?- se acercó juguetona- déjame adivinar, ¿qué te dijo mamá? No fue nada- una ligera sonrisa nerviosa adorno su rostro. ¡Oh, vamos¡ Dime- lo miro suplicante. Sabes que esa mirada de cachorrito no siempre funciona conmigo, princesa- tomo sus mejillas y las apretó cariñosamente. ¡Eso no es justo!- exclamó sonriente. Por cierto- volvió a su mirada seria- ¿Ya le dijiste a tus compañeros? Sí. Mi manager me comentó que canceleria las entrevistas de esta semana y que se pondría de acuerdo con mi madre para ambos dar las mismas excusas a la escuela y a los medios. Es un hombre muy inteligente. Me alegra que tu manager sea sensato. No por nada mi madre le tiene confianza- sonrió- por otra parte, mis amigas se preocuparon pero dijeron que me cubrirían en la escuela. Y Papi... -suspiro. Quiere verte, ¿verdad? Sí. No le dije dónde estaba para evitar problemas pero deduzco que para este momento el debe estar en camino. ¿Quieres verlo? No. El diablo es astuto. Bastante, y sabe acerca de los sentimientos de Papi. Si viene para acá y también te ve saliendo supondrá que estoy escondida aquí. Ire a casa de Papi a convencerlo de que me deje tu cuidado. Gracias, pero solo será una semana. Chloé- la tomo de los hombros mientras se sentaba en la cama- sabes que es peligroso que salgas. Si estoy encerrada por más tiempo los medios enloqueceran. Tranquilo Delgado- tomo su mano- Confía en mí, ¿si? Tengo un plan. Me encantaría escucharlo. Primero ve con Papi. Hay que evitar que me encuentre. De acuerdo. Mientras tanto. Un hombre alto y fornido, con la mirada filosa y una sonrisa torcida miraba unas fotos sobre su escritorio. ¿Señor?- una timida voz lo llamo. ¿Qué quieres? Ya sabemos donde esta la chica. Es justo como lo dedujo. De nuevo ese oficial, ¿eh?- tomo una foto delante de él. Miró la sonrisa de la chica y el guiñó que lo ofrecía coqueta y la quemó con odio. El hombre joven que entró a comunicarle eso tragó saliva mientras veía a su jefe levantarse y acercarse a él. ¿O-Ocurre algo, señor? Necesito que mandes al Cuervo. ¡¿Al Cuervo?!-exclamo asustado. Si. Dile que nuestra venganza al fin se cumplirá. El chico se quedo de piedra mirandolo. ¡Vete!- bramó. ¡S-si!- corriendo salió del despacho. Al fin- encendió un puro y lo llevo a su boca mientras seguia contemplando las fotos con rabia- ha llegado el momento de que pagues por todo lo que me hiciste perder. Mientras avanzaba hacía el departamento de Papi, la escena de esa tarde lo asalto nuevamente. Ya veo- la madre de Chloé suspiró mientras en una maleta comenzaba a empacar varios cambios de ropa y cosas para su hija- le dire a Ray que llevé esto a la estación, ¿de acuerdo? Hay que hacerlo lo menos obvio posible. Gracias por su comprensión. La que debería agradecer soy yo. Mi hija siempre ha estado envuelta en varios problemas y tú siempre la proteges- tomo sus manos y lo miró como una madre cariñosa- te estamos muy agradecidos. Yo... - sonrió- es mi trabajo. Lo sé- comenzó a reír- protegee a tu \"princesa\", ¿no? ¿Cómo?-susurro mientras miles de colores bailaban en su rostro. Se que la adoras y ella también a tí. No temas, lo de Papi no sera serio, solo esta con él por el aprecio que le tiene como amigo. Cuando ambos dejen de ser tercos al negar lo que sienten podrán tener una muy bonita relación. D-Debo irme. Gracias por la compresión. Eres un buen hombre- comenzó a reír- adecuado para mi pequeña revoltosa. Dejó a mi hiia en tus manos, Delgado. Espero que en esta semana ambos puedan sincerarse. Delgado la miró con una sonrisa y asintió con la cabeza mientras se marchaba. Cuando llevaba poco más de dos metros escucho a la alegre mujer gritar... \"¡Quiero nietos pronto!\" seguido de una gran y alegre risa y un Delgado sonrojado hasta las orejas. Tocó tres veces la puerta del apartamento de Papi sin respuesta alguna. Hasta la quinta la puerta se abrió lentamente, dejando ver a un hombre con la mirada llena de determinación. No me detendrás. Tengo que ir a verla. Papi, escúchame. Es peligroso que vayas. Es más peligroso que se quedé con un tipo armado hasta los dientes como tú. Sabes que jamás dañaría a Chloé- lo miro por lo bajo. Pese a que Papi era más alto que Chloé, la diferecia con Delgado seguía siendo considerable. Déjame pasar- le exigió cuando el oficial bloqueó su puerta. Primero escúchame. Si vas a verla daras a conocer su paradero. Piensa un poco, Papi. Solo será una semana. Tranquilízate. No puedo. Quiero verla. La pondrás en riesgo. Seré cauteloso. Los hombres de \"El diablo\" son bastante astutos. No nos quedaremos en mi apartamento. Nos tendremos que mover. Déjalo en mis manos, sabes que la cuidare con mi vida. Lo sé...-susurro- la última vez casi mueres al salvarla. Confía en mí. Delgado, tú hiciste todo para salvarla y yo solo estaba sin hacer nada. ¡Como un inútil! Esta vez también yo quiero protegerla. Si tanto te importa cuidarla y que este bien- lo tomo del hombro- no te metas en esto y cuídate bien a ti mismo, Papi. Solo por dañarla podrían buscar hacerte daño a ti o a su familia. Delgado. ¿Sí? Cuidala. Con la voluntad quebrada y los ojos resignados entro de vuelta a si departamento. ¿Qué estaba pensando? se reprendió. Ir es ponerla en peligro. Suspiró mientras se retiraba. Hizo una llamada a sus compañeros de la comisaría mientras reportaba la situación y las direcciones de las personas que podrían ser usadas como carnadas para Chloé. Una vez hecho eso volvió a su apartamento y le explicó a su princesa que durante esa semana debían desaparecer de Beverly Hills.

Meeting his unblinking stare, I stepped forward until our bodies were mere inches apart, tilting my head up slightly to keep my gaze trained upon his face. His hand reached up to wipe a drop of blood from my cheek, resulting merely in smearing more across my face in the process. I pressed my hand over his, holding it against the side of my face, not breaking the silence of the tracks in between trains. Expression unchanged, voice steady, he continued, \"How do you know I won't kill you next, Elizabeth?\" His hand dropped slowly down to his side as I released it from my grip and took his pale face, still damply colored in streaks of red, gently between my hands. \"Because you're mine,\" I told him softly, hearing my voice nearly break with the quiet force of those words. Beyond anything else I knew this to be true, needed it to be true. His face retained the same blank calm, but something in his eyes seemed to... shift, as if he were studying me intently. In anyone else it would have been an imperceptible change in countenance, but for Nigel it was an almost ostentatious display of emotion. The sound of an approaching train echoed dully in the distance. [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Standing almost naked in the small room attached to the crawlspace beneath his parents' house, Elizabeth washed the dried blood from her face and arms in the metal sink, slightly bent over to avoid knocking her head against the low ceiling. Jack had gone crazy. The only thing left to do had been to shoot him. Due to the connection their minds had developed, the result had been an almost unbearable pain for Nigel. She sighed, reaching for a faded blue towel folded on the counter by the industrial sink. It was like the tearing away of a part of his brain. When Jack had come at him with the shotgun on the tracks it was all he could do to stop him. Even after he had killed Nigel's parents and that girl from St. Mary's, claiming that it had been Nigel himself who had done so... truly believing it, in fact... Jack's death had still taken its toll on him. The sound of the water for the shower upstairs shut off, followed by soft footfalls on the ancient wooden floorboards. Elizabeth finished drying off and replaced the towel, sighing as she glanced down at her shirt and jeans, lightly crusted in dried blood, piled in a corner near the door. Walking over to the low bed that took up the entirety of the far wall, she picked up a gray t-shirt from the lightly rumpled blanket and pulled it on over her bra and panties. As she sat down upon the bed in Nigel's shirt, leaning back against the wall, the small white painted panel across the room slid open. Shirtless, Nigel climbed through the door, sliding it closed behind him with an almost mechanical movement, and made his way over to the bed. Elizabeth slid over to give him room and he sat down beside her, taking her by surprise as he collapsed into her lap, resting his head against her chest. She sat there for a moment without moving, merely looking at his exhausted form, admiring the soft contours of his face. His pale skin, like porcelain in the dim light, strong jaw line, and graceful neck. As she brushed a lock of damp black hair from his closed eyes, a long breath escaped his slightly parted lips before his breathing slowed to a deep, even pace. She slid down the wall a bit, settling more comfortably into the pillow behind her. Closing her eyes, she held the curled up boy gently in her arms, his smooth skin and body still warm from the shower pressed closely against her. Sleep came quickly.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 – \"Winters Come and Go, and Fade Like Narcotics\" My sleep went undisturbed by dreams that night. I think it was the warmth of Nigel's presence that kept the demons at bay. He never allows himself to be that vulnerable, not even around me. He isn't one for physical affection either. Not a single night has passed without nightmares in a long while. I am sill in awe of the fact that there were none last night. Thank god. Thank god. [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] The dim light eventually took its toll on her eyelids, pushing its feeble glow into her skull and forcing her awake. Elizabeth pushed herself up with one hand, eyes closed tightly, and brushed a long strand of dark brown hair from her face with the other. Blinkingly, she finally deigned to open her eyes, turning towards where Nigel had lain beside her the previous night. Gone. Though it wasn't an unusual occurrence, somehow she had expected him to be there when she awoke this time. He often disappeared for hours at a time, leaving her to her own devices, showing up without a word. She should have been used to it and, in fact, was. Why she had expected today to be any different... Likely, he had gone to see to Jack. Looking over towards the door, she noticed the absence of her clothes from the previous night. They had probably been burned already, lending credit to her belief about Nigel's whereabouts. Standing, she stepped up to the row of cabinets along the side wall across from the sink, close to the ceiling and painted the same stark white as the rest of the narrow room. Opening the far right cabinet, closest to the bed, she pulled out a small pile of neatly folded clothes. The cabinet had been a concession from Nigel, empty and unused before Elizabeth, that she now used to store a single change of clothes. For the occasion that she hadn't the time to go... home . Giving her head a stern shake, she closed the door firmly and pulled off the shirt she was in. Although not in any particular hurry Elizabeth changed quickly, replaced Nigel's shirt neatly folded on the bed, and promptly left the room. Upon exiting the crawlspace she hopped down into the basement, replacing the mattress leaning against the wall so that it covered the square hole about a yard up from the floor. [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] The cold English chill seeped steadily through her clothes, sinking into her bones as Elizabeth walked down a street not quite a mile from Nigel's house. Pulling her black coat closer around her petite body, she quickened her pace, swiftly approaching the end of the block. She turned the corner in a rush and came to a sudden halt, staring down the narrow avenue before her. A cold gust of wind came up from behind and swept past her thin form, tugging from her grasp the edges of her unbuttoned coat and flinging them out before her. Bracing herself, she took a tentative step forward, ignoring her coat flapping in the harsh wind that pushed her toward her destination. The fourth house on the left, although outwardly no different from its surrounding fellows, loomed ominously in her vision as she approached. Passing the raised porch out front, Elizabeth made her way to the gate at the side of the house and wrenched open the latch, wincing at the loud groan of protest from the rusty metal. Without pausing to wait around for anyone who might have heard, she slipped into the side yard, adjusting the gate so that it appeared to be firmly shut but in actuality remained unlatched for a quick escape. Carefully opening the side door to the house, she peered cautiously around the doorframe to look about the kitchen. Empty. Before stepping foot into the dark room, the only light coming from a naked window above the sink, Elizabeth paused, tilting her head to the side, listening intently. The sound of raised voices, quieted by slight distance, filtered downstairs to rest threateningly in her ear. Taking a deep breath, she slipped quickly inside, shutting the door behind with a muted thud.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 – \"I Don't Need Your Pity\" \"What are you doing?\" I paused, scalpel held carefully in one gloved hand, and looked up from my work at the reflection off the window before me. I was sitting at my desk in the dorm, partway through the dissection of a white-tailed swallow. Alex stood silhouetted in the doorway, hands tucked into his pockets, leaning against the doorframe. His stance menacingly casual; like a panther ready to spring. \"We've got work to do, Nigel.\" Alex stepped forward until he was standing directly behind me and leaned in close, his freckled face hovering just over my shoulder, breath warm and suffocating against my neck. \"Or have you forgotten?\" [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Nigel stood before a metal garbage bin in the middle of a construction site that had been abandoned for the winter, his dark blue eyes staring coldly into the hot flames that licked away at the final scraps of blackened cloth. The foul stench of scorched flesh mingled with the chill early morning air as the darkness faded to the muted gray of a false dawn. As the fire dwindled and was slowly reduced to softly glowing embers, he looked up at the sky, the last chance for seeing stars already past. You could never see the stars here anyways. The damn clouds always got in the way. He turned abruptly on his heel and headed for the forest that bordered the site. A trickle of smoke still rose from the metal cylinder, but Nigel didn't look back as he walked away. [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Elizabeth was halfway down the block before she realized why her neck was so cold. In her hurry to leave she had left her scarf behind. Shit. There was no way she was going back… there. She raised her hands to tug the collar of her coat up and one hand glanced across her neck. She winced slightly and gingerly touched what she knew must be bruises forming in two places on the pale skin of her neck. Most likely in the shape of thumbprints. Shit. She adjusted her collar as best she could to hide her neck and quickened her step. Distracted so by her shame, Elizabeth hardly noticed the person walking down the sidewalk in the opposite direction until she ran straight into them. Flustered, she muttered quick apologies as her hands reached up to cover her neck. She looked up to find a pale face turned towards her, dark blue eyes calmly studying her face. \"Elizabeth.\" Nigel's gaze shifted downwards to what her hands covered. A flash of rage in his eyes as her hands fell away from her neck, revealing a mere two of a new set of marks. The previous set had barely had time to fade. She trained her gaze upon the ground beneath their feet, unable to meet his eyes. The soft rustle of cloth, then his scarf around her neck. Elizabeth looked up, lost herself in his now calm eyes, lost track of time. \"Nigel...\" She reached a hand towards him, but he turned away. Began walking back the way he came. Her hand dropped heavily back down to her side. \"Let's go.\" \"…Okay.\" And she followed him. They never went anywhere in particular. Down by the water maybe, or perhaps just to wander the empty streets at night in the peaceful dark. They just started walking with no direction, and after a while their feet found the well-trod path they often followed when there was nowhere else to be. No-one gave them a second look as they padded through the lightly trafficked avenues near enough downtown to have people scattered about them throughout the day. As they made their way through the ambling groups of shoppers they were often forced to walk one behind the other. Normally adept at slipping swiftly through crowds, today Elizabeth trod more slowly behind Nigel as he picked their way through the occasional cluttered patch of pavement. Passing through a small mass of people outside the front of a popular store, she was cut off by a pretty girl about her age, dressed in fashionable clothes and laughing loudly in an overly ostensible manner at something one of her companions had said. Startled, Elizabeth pulled up just short of running into her and stood there for a moment, slightly dazed at having been torn from her thoughts so abruptly. The girl's pretty face darkened in an ugly manner as she shot her a condescending look, as if Elizabeth had been the one to cut across her path. All of this in just a moment or two, and then a hand, larger and radiating slight warmth, wrapped around her own, enveloping it in a strong grip as a gentle tug guided her left and forward through the crowd. She blinked, mildly disoriented as her feet followed mechanically, and looked up to catch Nigel's calm, confident stride as he walked one step ahead of her, pulling her easily through the crowd. Knowing and trusting that he would lead her the right way, Elizabeth immediately fell back into her jumbled thoughts, too exhausted or tired to even care what was happening. She merely watched his feet as they walked, never once looking up to notice anything else. All that existed was herself, and the gentle force pulling her forward.[Chapter 4] A/N: Okay, more revisions. These were actually done a while ago but I completely forgot to post them. So here they are: Chapters 4 and 5 in their (hopefully!) final versions. I'm quite pleased with them actually. Enjoy! Chapter 4 – \"And Our Lungs Were Screaming Like a Murder of Black Crows\" Jack had crept into the dorm room we shared late one night. It only takes a few seconds for the chloroform to kick in. When I awoke, I had expected to be on the train like the last time this had happened. Instead, my surroundings were dark with only a single light hanging overhead. The air smelled damp and cool. Blurred vision. I blinked and looked up at the person seated at a table directly beneath the light. Alex? No, it was Jack. Alex was bearable, but Jack… I gave my head a firm shake as if to dispel the thought from my mind, though it didn't help. The movement caught Jack's eye and he stood up, walking across the room to where I was leaned against the wall, clad only in my pyjamas and coat. We were in the basement of the school, where Alex liked to hang out with his friends to avoid the headmaster. \"Now, Nigel,\" Jack began, standing over me, obviously relishing the feeling of power that came with the situation. \"You should know by now that the connection works both ways.\" He crouched down in front of me, and I turned my face away. Jack roughly grabbed my chin with one hand and forced my head forward until our faces were level. His eyes narrowed, he spoke more slowly now. \"I know every thought that passes through your mind. There's nowhere for you to hide.\" I looked calmly back at him, unwavering in my gaze. Jack stared at me for a moment longer before getting up and striding over to the table. He picked up a small metal box and held it in his hand, scrutinizing it intently, seemingly unconcerned with anything else. Pushing myself to my feet, I tucked my hands into the pockets of my coat, studying Jack's face. \"So, who is it tonight?\" Jack looked up from his box and smiled. [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] \"You went back there again.\" She needn't look at Nigel's face to know that the expression there was the same as always, calm and controlled. They were sitting by the water. It was almost noon. Elizabeth continued staring into the icy depths, noting how the water today matched the color of Nigel's eyes perfectly. \"I know those marks.\" His voice sounded to Elizabeth like it were a million miles away. \"When Jack was still here, he would…\" Now she turned to look at him, her mind clinging to the truth of his words in a feeble attempt to pull herself back to reality. Drowning in the void she created to protect herself from that very same reality, some part of her now seemed to want it back. Nigel looked back at her, the inner struggle of her mind clearly visible across her face. Dark blue met gray, and he knew. She never could talk in this state. He snorted lightly, bringing a hand up to ruffle Elizabeth's already wind-blown hair, and she gazed up at him with a detached look of vague surprise. As he turned to look out over the water the faintest hint of a smile touched his lips. They sat there like that, Nigel looking at the water, Elizabeth looking at Nigel, for a full minute. Elizabeth abruptly stood up and dusted off the backside of her coat. Nigel watched her movements with curiosity, still seated. She tilted her head slightly to one side, then turned away from him and ran as hard and as fast as she could. It wasn't long before she could hear his steps behind her as they ran alongside the water. With each step the numbness faded a little more. With each harsh breath tearing through her lungs Elizabeth felt just that much more alive. By the time they had run far enough to reach the end of the concrete walkway, she could feel the cold again. Panting, she stopped and turned in time to watch Nigel catch up, an amused look upon his face. And for the first time in a long while a small, wavering smile crossed Elizabeth's delicate features. Her stomach had cramped because she wasn't used to running, the cold air had scraped her throat raw, and her entire body ached. But it didn't matter, because all she wanted to do at that moment was scream. So she did. After watching her for a few moments, Nigel's voice rang out alongside Elizabeth's. They stood there shouting at the top of their lungs, one long wordless cry that echoed out across the water.[Chapter 5] A/N: If you've been reading my story up until now and haven't read my note at the beginning of Chapter 4, you might want to do so now. Chapters 4 and 5 went through major changes. Please read and review! Chapter 5 – \"And I Woke Up in a Cold Sweat to Those Barren Walls Again\" I can hear them through the walls and through the vents. Footsteps filter down from the ceiling above. Voices echo distantly through the halls. There is nowhere to run. Just a calm, passive acceptance of what is to come. This, is home. [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Conflicting sounds filtered through Elizabeth's fuzzy thoughts as she slowly emerged from her dreams. There were footsteps from above, voices, faint and far away. Though warm, her slender body shivered beneath the blankets, hands clutching at the surrounding fabric. Beside her, Nigel watched her movements with his usual calm, steady gaze. Elizabeth's body gave a sharp jerk and she awoke with a start, bolting upright. Breathing heavily, she looked around to see the dark eyed boy beside her. The sickly look faded slightly from her face at the sight of him and she slumped back against the pillows, pressing her palms against her eyes. The pair sat in silence for a while, the only sounds being the dim murmur of Nigel's parents in the kitchen above them. \"I hate people,\" Elizabeth said after some time had passed. She pulled her hands away from her face and stared blankly at the wall before her. A cruel tone entered her voice as she continued. \"They're terrible, terrifying, horrible creatures.\" \"Why don't you hate me then?\" Nigel asked, turning towards her, his voice almost dangerously calm. When he wanted to know something there was nothing that could stop him; he would get that knowledge somehow. It always seemed to work that way, ever since Elizabeth had first met him \"I don't know…\" Her reply was soft, almost a whisper. Try as she might to avoid thinking about what the answer might be, she knew it was a futile struggle even before it began. She usually chose her words more carefully around Nigel; the grogginess of sleep must have caused her to forget. \"I am a terrible, terrifying, horrible person.\" He shifted his body so that he was directly in front of her, looking her straight in the eye, his words sincere and deadly serious. \"So why do you care for me?\" Elizabeth wanted to look away but couldn't, caught by that piercing gaze. He was much stronger than her, fierce, strong willed, and violent when he was angry. There were infinite reasons for her to fear him, for her to hate him, as she did everyone else. I am a murderer. Nigel's words at the tracks echoed through her head. \"I don't know, I really don't know…\" she mumbled. \"Why?\" Nigel demanded, his voice hard and fierce. His face had a commanding sort of look to it, one that could not be precisely defined as anger. \"Why me?\" \"Because you're mine!\" The sharpness in her voice startled the girl, and she looked down to where her hand had grasped Nigel's shirt. Her next words were more gentle. \"You're my terrible, terrifying, horrible creature. You're mine and I want you.\" Elizabeth trailed off, fingers loosening their grip. \"I want you… \"[Chapter 6] A/N: Sorry it takes me so long to update. My inspiration hits sporadically at best. Thank you to anyone who is reading this, and I really and truly appreciate any reviews or comments I get. Just a disclaimer that I should have added earlier: The chapter titles are in quotes because they are all song lyrics. All songs will be by either Michael Trent, The Films, Sons Of An Illustrious Father, or Travis Bilenski. As of yet, they are all by Travis though. Please read and review! Thank you. ^^ Chapter 6 – \"And Your Legs Were Wrapped Around Me, All Bruised Up By Other Boys\" It was dark outside when Nigel followed Jack out onto the damp grass, black duffel bag tossed over one shoulder. The sun had set early and the empty field looked serene in the emerging starlight. A few lights tossed an orange glow across the patch of grass closest to the cluster of brick buildings at the far end of the campus. With Jack leading, the two boys quickly approached the buildings, stopping just outside the border of light. Nigel glanced around but saw no-one in the surrounding area. Surely most of the classes had let out for the evening, so the chances of crossing paths with anyone were slim. Turning, he was just in time to catch a glimpse of Jack stepping around a corner where the light was less bright. Nigel followed his companion, and the two boys slipped silently through the narrow passageways. Jack stopped abruptly, careful to stay in the shadow as he cast his gaze upon on the four-story library that towered above its surroundings. Nigel merely leaned his back against the wall, a vacant look on his face. A silence settled across the complex, broken only by a harsh wind that picked up and wound its way through the tangle of buildings before dying down. The sound of a door sliced through the air, followed softly by footsteps. Nigel looked up just in time to see a slender girl in a black coat hurrying past, straight dark hair ruffled by a slight breeze. A single glimpse was enough for him to recognize her as me. In one swift motion, he grabbed Jack by the collar and slammed him up against the wall. Jack merely laughed. \"Not Elizabeth.\" There was a sharp edge to his voice and eyes as he stared down at Jack. Jack stopped laughing, allowing a pleased, vindictive smile to settle across his face. \"But Nigel, she's your Maraclea, is she not?\" His sickly sweet voice clashed harshly with the cruel expression of pleasure on his face. I didn't understand what he meant by this when Nigel first told me the story of this day, but I was to find out all too soon. \"Besides, it's you that killed my dear friend Josh on the train that night,\" he continued dismissively. Nigel let out a low wordless growl and released his grip on the other boy, turning down the passageway that I had since disappeared along. Jack merely stood there, watching him go and smiling to himself in the shadows. \"An eye for an eye…\" [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Elizabeth sat at her desk, idly tugging at the uncomfortable skirt of her uniform. She found her gaze drifting away from the chalkboard at the front of the classroom towards the window she was seated next to. Her fingers gently probed at the remaining soreness in her neck as she stared absently out at a patch of dark, roiling clouds that predicted an evening storm. Realizing what she was doing, Elizabeth quickly pulled her hands from her neck, praying that she hadn't smudged the thin covering of make-up over her slowly fading bruises. The others were easier to hide beneath layers of winter clothing, but her neck… She sighed quietly to herself and turned back to check the clock above the board. At least the day was almost over. If it weren't for him she would have skipped more often than not, but as it were that would only lead to more… incidents. What her mother saw in that man Elizabeth would never understand. He still tried to get her to call him dad, even after four years. That he dared to consider himself a father figure to her after all he had done… The end of classes bell startled her out of her thoughts and she looked down to find her hands curled into fists upon her desk. Her anger subsided in a wave of exhaustion, replaced by a slight shiver as she stood to leave, gathering her things with now trembling hands. Elizabeth made her way through the jostling crowd of girls in the stone hallways of the Catholic school compound without taking notice of her surroundings in the least. By the time she stood in front of the house on Rosebay Lane she could hardly remember how she had gotten there. She slipped quietly past the softly dozing hound just inside the metal gate and made her way to the hidden basement room where Nigel sat studying a leather bound book at the small desk. He didn't look up when she entered, sliding the thin panel closed behind her, but he took note of her presence. She was greeted by a dry rustle as she sat down on the edge of the bed, followed by a thin smack as today's paper hit the floor by her feet. She looked up at Nigel, who merely leaned back in his chair and looked at her, unreadable as always. Picking up the paper, Elizabeth was greeted by a large picture of a familiar freckle faced boy. The article on Alex's disappearance took up half of the front page, an unnecessarily large amount of space for a missing persons case. \"His father must have the whole city out looking for him by now,\" she murmured, scanning the newsprint for anything that might hint at a suspect. The space was mostly occupied with quotes from Alex's father and information on how tragic it was for such an influential man to lose his sole heir. Dropping the paper back down into her lap, Elizabeth looked up at Nigel. \"What did you do with him?\" She paused, fidgeting on the bed. \"I mean, what if they find his..?\" \"It's been dealt with,\" he stated simply, cutting her off midsentence. After a few moments of silence the raven haired boy crossed the small room to stand over the slender girl. \"Or don't you trust me?\" Elizabeth flinched at the harshness of his tone, straining her neck to hold the gaze that had captured her in its depths once again. Kneeling down in front of her, Nigel's voice softened dangerously. \"Such a pretty face,\" he cooed sweetly, reaching his hand up to trail a finger ever so lightly against her cheek. \"But far too broken for anyone to ever truly want. Who do you think would accept you other than me?\" Desperation and defeat reflected in her soft gray eyes, but still she never looked away from his cold gaze until he kissed her. Soft lips pressed roughly against her own, as the warmth of another body pressed in against hers. Nigel leaned in closer, steadying himself with one hand on the bed beside her while the other cupped her chin firmly. Elizabeth struggled to focus on breathing, feeling as if the breath had been torn from her lungs. Their lips parted after what seemed like an eternity, and she opened her eyes, unaware of having closed them. Nigel moved the breathless girl further back onto the bed, running his hands down the smooth skin of her legs, causing her to clutch at the blankets. \"Who else cares for you besides me?\" he whispered huskily in her ear, as she writhed beneath him. Her entire body burned at his touch as she surrendered to the strength of the young man above her. He slipped his hands under the button up shirt of her uniform, grabbing roughly at her sides and hips, leaving more bruises alongside those already fading. Her hands reached out to his chest before finding his neck and pulling him down towards her. Nigel nosed his way gently down her neck, his breath hot against her sensitive skin. He nipped her collar bone lightly a few times before attacking her skin more violently, pressing his body roughly against hers. Elizabeth whimpered in his ear, digging her fingers into the flesh of his back. Nigel pulled back, a fierceness in his cold blue eyes. \"You're mine, Elizabeth, and no one hurts what's mine,\" the boy growled possessively before returning his lips to hers.

Summer holidays mean free time, and free time means new FanFiction ideas, hence why this little fic has popped out of my somewhat disturbed brain. Ask me my favourite movie, and I will nearly always say This Is The End . It brings together nearly all my favourite actors, and I ' m automatically drawn to anything created by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. But what would happen if a girl was part of the group? That ' s the thought I ' ve been having anyway, so I decided to do a canon fic feature a female OC. Now, pre-warning you, I am English, not American. So, if I use phrases that are English, or mess up an American phrase, please don ' t hesitate to correct me! Chapter One- Hollywood Whore God, I wished I was home right now. I hated thinking of my poor old house sitting up in the Hollywood Hills, alone, empty, sad. It wasn't even like I had an excuse to be away; I wasn't the one who was filming on location, unlike my boyfriend, Dave Franco, who had pissed off to film yet another disturbing solo episode for Funny Or Die. I'd been in a few of his little videos and honestly, I always wanted to bleach my tongue afterwards. I'm not some kind of fucking prude, though! Okay, when you've been in as many Seth Rogen/Judd Apatow/Evan Goldberg movies as I have, you really do have to keep an open mind about, well…everything. When you've had some of the lines I've been forced to say over the last seven or eight years, all forms of modesty go straight out the fucking window. Let me spin you a timeline of my acting career: 2005: I, Mackenzie Bolton, moved to Los Angeles, California as a fresh-faced, innocent twenty-year-old to pursue my very clichéd dream of becoming an actress. Not too long after arriving, I received a small, two-episode part in the first season of Supernatural as a demon who pretended to help the Winchester brothers and ended up getting stabbed in the throat for betraying them. 2006: After no roles, or even any call-backs, since Supernatural I was getting ready to give up hope and move back home to Amityville, New York when I finally won the role of Will Ferrell's teenage daughter Cosmopolitan in Talladega Nights . 2007: After the (somewhat surprising) success of Talladega , I was contacted by director/producer Judd Apatow who was interested in me auditioning for a movie he was directing, Knocked Up , where I would play Marnie, the live-in younger sister of Katherine Heigl's and Leslie Mann's characters Alison and Debbie. I accepted and got the part, quite flawlessly I might add. This is how I met my now very closest friend, Seth Rogen. Not long after this, Judd called me again and asked if I would consider a main role in his and Seth's latest…masterpiece, shall we call it. This was the role of Clarissa; awkward, clumsy, anti-social geek and best friend of Jonah Hill, Michael Cera and Christopher Mintz-Plasse in a little-known project called Superbad . I now fondly look upon that movie as my big break in Hollywood, making me a household name in comedy. That was when I decided any serious projects I had planned to do could go and fuck themselves straight up the ass. 2008: I like to think this is where my movie career took off. Being good friends with Seth, he offered me a role in his weed-based, action comedy Pineapple Express as one of drug lord Ted's psycho henchpeople, Mandy, gun-toting assassin extraordinaire. This is how I met three of my other best friends, James Franco, whose character I shot in the leg, Danny McBride, whose character had a thing for my character, and Craig Robinson, who'd had to physically throw me at Seth's character like a human bowling ball. At the after party for the movie, James introduced me to his brother Dave, who I knew from his thirty-second role in Superbad , when my character had told his character that he could take the two points his soccer team was losing by and deep-throat them. But apparently that hadn't put him off me in anyway, and five months later, Us Weekly got hold of a pap picture of the two of us kissing on Venice Beach and published it, revealing to the world that we were dating. We've been together ever since. Then came the role of porn star Lolabelle in Zack and Miri Make a Porno . That is not a role I will ever, ever be proud of. Very few twenty-three-year-olds are willing to go full-frontal, butt-ass naked on camera…and I am one of them. Still, I had to show my ass, and my boobs were more than slightly visible; to this day I have never let my father anywhere near that movie, and my mother is probably turning in her grave whenever it's mentioned. I also had relatively decent parts in non-Rogen-devised movies. I played self-conscious sorority girl Jayden in The House Bunny opposite my Superbad co-star Emma Stone, I did a voiceover as the talking butterfly Nimah in Kung Fu Panda (though Seth had also starred with me)and I was in Step Brothers as John C. Reilly's character's younger sister Callie. 2008 was a crazy year for me. 2009: A calmer year, thank fuck. Nothing really came up for me aside from a small part in Funny People as up-and-coming comedienne Isabella, and I was also in a seven episodes of How I Met Your Mother as Ted's girlfriend Tamara. 2010: Trying to find a new genre to break into in the movie industry is not very easy, so playing spring breaking college girl Josie in Piranha 3D as my attempt at horror was definitely not my best idea. The fake leg they gave me for when I was ripped apart by the piranhas made me look fat. So then, because I had loved the originals so much, I tried out the A Nightmare On Elm Street reboot, playing Harley, Nancy's best friend. I died in that too, FYI. On the plus side, I also had a voiceover role in How To Train Your Dragon as dragon hunter Åshild , alongside my good friends Jonah Hill and Chris Mintz-Plasse, and it is also the movie in which I became very close friends with Jay Baruchel. Though I knew him from Knocked Up , it was HTTYD that sealed our friendship. 2011: This was a pretty fun year. James, Danny and I teamed up again in Your Highness , where I got to try out my skills with anEnglish accent as Princess Theodina, James and Danny's warrior sister. I was also in Bridesmaids as, well, bridesmaid Aimee. 2012: This was the first proper time Dave and I got to work together, as I had a role in 21 Jump Street as Jonah and Channing Tatum's Jump Street co-officer, Kira. This was also the first time in five years that I was turned down for a role. James had put me forward to Harmony Korine to audition for Faith in Spring Breakers . I was called back for a screen test with James and everything. We enacted the scene where Alien attempts to comfort Faith in the pool room in full costume, so I nearly shit myself laughing, seeing him in that Hawaiian shirt and those cornrows. Though to be fair, the first thing he said when he first saw me in my orange-and-turquoise bikini was that I looked like a prostitute. Either way, I was too 'confident and assured' for Faith, apparently, so the role was given to Selena Gomez, of all people. I've never really gotten over the irritation of that. 2013: Well, that's where we are now. So far, there's not really been anything worth noting, aside from a stream of commercials for Victoria's Secret in which I look super hot, and I was in a few episodes of The Big Bang Theory as a potential girlfriend of Stuart the Comic Store Owner called Scarlett, but it transpired she was only with him so she could own the comic book store and intended to sell it. Heavy stuff for that show, actually. I'll never regret being in so much comedy, because if I hadn't, I'd probably be stewing around back in Amityville on my sofa with a bottle of vodka in my hand, wondering what my life would be. Or I'd be a prostitute. One or the other. I just try to think positive. And without those movies, I wouldn't have the close-knit gang of morons known as Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson and Danny McBride to call my best friends. And I wouldn't now be lying on my bed in Seth's guest room, orange iPhone 5C pressed to my ear, grumbling at Dave in total annoyance. \"What the fuck do you mean, filming's delayed for five more days?!\" I said desperately. \"The camera guy broke his leg,\" Dave explained. \"So we haven't shot anything for two days.\" \"You've been gone two weeks !\" I practically exploded. \"The video's ten minutes long! How does it take more than two weeks to film something ten minutes long?!\" \"Um, well-\" \"On second thoughts, I don't wanna know,\" I said with an unintentional laugh. \"I just remembered why I refused to be in any more of those videos. But seriously, Dave. It's James' housewarming tonight! You were supposed to be back before we went!\" \"I know, it's not like I haven't realised that. It's really shitty that I can't go.\" \"This is going to break the poor man's heart. You're aware of that, right?\" Now it was Dave's turn to laugh. \"He's a big boy, he'll be fine.\" \"Okay, but when your brother starts crying on my shoulder because he misses you so much, I'm FaceTiming you and bombarding you with the guilt.\" \"That seems fair.\" I could practically feel Dave's grin through the phone. There was a sudden pounding on the bedroom door, like someone was trying to get in with a goddamn battering ram. \"Mack!\" Seth's voice came through the door. \"Get off the fucking phone!\" \"Hold up, Rogen!\" I shouted back. \"We're having a crisis in here!\" The door opened, revealing Seth leaning on the doorframe. \"Can't you guys have phone sex some other time? You'll see each other in like three hours!\" \"Ha-di-fucking-ha,\" I said sourly. \"You're hilarious, Seth. And no, we won't. Their cameraman had the fucking indecency to go and break his leg. The filming's been delayed.\" \"Wait, he's not coming?\" \"Nada.\" \"Oh man. James is gonna be offended.\" \"Tell him to stop making me feel bad!\" protested Dave. \"I can't fucking help it!\" I laughed. \"He said stop making him feel bad, because he can't fucking help it.\" Seth also laughed, his trademark 'har-har-har' sound. \"I'm just telling it like it is. Anyway, we have to go. Jay's flight lands in an hour, and we gotta get to LA International.\" \"Oh shit. I totally forgot about Jay!\" I exclaimed, clapping my phone-free hand to my forehead. \"I'm sure he'll appreciate that,\" Seth said dryly. I shot him the finger, then turned my attention back to my cell. \"Sorry baby, but that's my cue to leave. I'll call you tomorrow, yeah? I doubt I'll be in a position to talk after your brother's infamous party.\" \"Just try not to end up like you were at the Jump Street wrap party.\" \"That was a year ago!\" I whined. \"Stop bringing it up! Why can't we just forget it?!\" \"You turned your cop costume into a stripper outfit and started pole dancing in front of the entire party. I'm not gonna forget that for a long time. And then there was the situation at our housewarming.\" \"We are not supposed to talk about that! Ever!\" That was probably the worst experience of my life. Not only was I totally shitfaced that time, but I was high too, on a mixture of ecstasy, shrooms and weed. This led to me removing every last piece of my clothing, raiding our fridge and covering myself in Nutella and peanut butter and offered Dave a 'snack' by licking me clean, again in front of the entire party. This was the reason I now tried to avoid getting overly drunk, though I knew tonight would end up being a very large exception to this. Didn't nobody leave a James Franco party sober. \"And on that note,\" I said tightly. \"I will talk to you tomorrow. Love you, babe.\" \"Love you too, Kenzie,\" he replied. \"I'll be home soon.\" \"You'd better be,\" I retorted, but I made a 'mwah' noise down the phone and hung up. Seth, meanwhile, was bent double, pretending to vomit on the carpet. \"You guys are sickeningly in love,\" he informed me. \"You only have yourself to blame, since you and James are the only reason I got to know him,\" I shot back, sticking my tongue out at him. \"Like I knew you'd start sucking his dick after five minutes!\" \"Why do you think I'm now borderline teetotal?\" \"Dunno. You're getting more mature, more boring. Your old age,\" he mocked. \"I'm twenty-eight!\" I shrieked, throwing a pillow at him. \"I'm younger than everyone in our little group! Everyone !\" \"Alright, chill out!\" he ordered, holding up his hands in a surrendering gesture. \"You'll give yourself a fucking aneurysm. And seriously, get dressed. We really need to go.\" \"Yeah, yeah,\" I replied, waving my hand dismissively. \"Give me ten minutes. Go smoke a joint or get the house half-presentable or something.\" \"You're giving me permission to smoke? Seriously?\" \"Not permission, as such. It's a mere suggestion. Now fuck off.\" I stood up and shut the bedroom door in his face, before turning and raiding the half-empty wardrobe for clothing to replace the old t-shirt of Dave's I was wearing. I ended up in white sweatpants, a black crop top (that showed off the bottom of the colourful flower-and-butterfly tattoo on my back) and white flip-flops, minimal make-up and had my long brown hair up in a messy ponytail. I really wasn't overly bothered about being photographed like this. \"'Kay, Rogen, I'm ready now!\" I called, grabbing my orange satchel bag and shoving in my purse and cell phone. He was waiting by the front door, a flat cap placed on his head. \"Jesus Christ, I will never understand how long it takes women so fucking long to get ready.\" \"I was fifteen minutes!\" I said irately, walking up to him and raising my eyebrows at his headgear. \"Nice hat,\" I smirked, sauntering out the door and getting into his car. \"Can we go to Carl's Jr. when we've got Jay? I'm hungry as fuck.\" Seth groaned, practically head-butting the steering wheel. \"Come on, Mack, don't give me the option! You know I can't!\" I rolled my eyes heavily. \"Please, spare me all this 'cleanse' bullshit again. You are not cleansing! I've been on God knows how many of the fucking things, so I think I know what I'm talking about! Stop trying to do them!\" \"Yeah, well we can't all be size four Victoria's Secret models, can we?\" \"Oh sweetie,\" I said comfortingly, patting his cap. \"Your chub makes you adorable, and don't let any of those tabloids tell you otherwise.\" \"I know I'm adorable,\" he replied, flashing me the famous Rogen Lopsided Grin. \"I'm fucking endearing. I'm like a teddy bear.\" \"A teddy bear that smokes a fuck-ton of weed.\" He didn't correct me, for obvious reasons. The LA International parking lot was, no surprised, full to the brim. We were lucky enough to get a space pretty close to the airport entrance. Still, this was mainly because if I'd not spotted the space and starting screaming, \"Park! Park! Park! Parkparkparkparkpark!\" whilst flapping my arms in the direction of the gap, we'd still be aimlessly driving around. As we made our way to Jay's terminal, pushing through the typical huge crowds, I couldn't help but wonder why nobody had invented teleporters yet. It would make everything so much easier. No more flying, no more cars or bikes or boats. Hell, no more walking. Less pollution too. Oh my God, if I put that forward to some Greenpeace shit I could totally become a philanthropist. \"We're kinda early,\" Seth muttered, looking at his watch. \"How early?\" I asked, narrowing my eyes. \"Only ten minutes,\" he answered. \"No need to shit yourself, this won't be eating into your pre-party beauty regime.\" \"I do not have a beauty regime!\" I said hotly. \"There is nothing wrong with weekly waxing and daily self-facials! Which, FYI, I've already done today!\" \"How could you give yourself a facial? Dave's not here,\" he said suggestively, quirking his eyebrow at me, causing me to gasp and slap his arm. \"That's disgusting! God, and to think, I used to be so innocent before I met you.\" \"Yeah, Amityville's really Virtue City, y'know, with all those demon possessions.\" \"Those were never proved! Demon possessions aren't real things! Anyone with half a brain could tell you that!\" Silence followed that. We were too busy trying to look to see if Jay's flight had landed. However, the things that weren't silent, however, were the fans. Every so often we'd get someone yelling one or both of our names, to which we would awkwardly smile or raise a hand at. \"Mom! Mom, I think that's Seth Rogen and Mackenzie Bolton over there!\" \"Hey, Seth Rogen! What up, man!\" \"Oh my God, Mackenzie Bolton! Hi!\" \"Holy shit, Jessica, it's Seth Rogen! And…no way, Mackenzie Bolton too! Quick, let's take a selfie with them in the background!\" \" Welcome to Los Angeles International Airport ,\" the Tannoy system suddenly announced. \" Attention, all passengers. Do not leave your baggage unattended. \" \"That must mean a flight's landed,\" I said musingly, more to myself than as a conversation starter. Sure enough, people came flooding out of the doors at the end of the terminal and the crowd dispersed, but Jay wasn't one of them. For another few moments Seth and I looked around, when the doors opened again, and Jay emerged, holding his arms out. Almost simultaneously, the three of us began laughing and jumping around, excitement hanging in the air. \"Yay!\" I squeaked, clapping my hands. \"We're so happy!\" Jay pretty much squealed. \"Look at this!\" \"What's happening, man?\" Seth asked him as they enveloped each other in a huge man-hug. \"Good to see you, buddy!\" Jay returned as Seth literally lifted him off his feet. \"Where's mine?\" I demanded, and Seth released Jay so he and I could embrace. \"Hey Mackenzie, it's been a while.\" \"Yeah, only a bit!\" We let go of each other and Jay took a step back so he could see both me and Seth. \"How you doing?\" he asked us. \"I'm good, man,\" Seth replied. I shrugged. \"Same old, same old. I've been living with this douchebag for the last two weeks, so I can't complain.\" I gently elbowed Seth in the ribs. \"I thought you were living with your boyfriend now?\" \"Oh yeah, I am. But, he's away filming, so what can ya do.\" \"So how long has it been, man?\" Seth asked him. \"Sometime in the last…\" Jay thought for a moment. \"Inside of a year or something.\" \"Oh my God, I can't believe it's been that long!\" I remarked. \"Well, I have the best weekend ever planned, man,\" Seth announced. I cleared my throat significantly. \"Fine. We have the best weekend ever planned.\" \"Just wait till you see what we've done,\" I added. \"You are gonna love it!\" \"Lay it on me!\" Jay exclaimed with another throwing-arms-out gesture as we turned and headed in the direction of the exit. \"We don't wanna ruin it,\" said Seth. Suddenly, a reporter with a cameraman behind him popped up out of literally nowhere. \"Seth Rogen!\" \"Oh shit, here we go,\" Seth muttered. \"Hey,\" he said to the reporter. \"How's it going, man?\" There was the buttering up… \"Yeah, good.\" \"So, you like, always play, like, the same guy in every movie.\" And there was the signature paparazzi sting. \"When are you gonna do, like, some real acting, man?\" \"Okay, thank you.\" Seth's tone was abrupt and vaguely offended. Jay and I, meanwhile, were attempting to keep out of the camera's range. \"Give me something!\" the pap implored. \"Give me, like, the laugh, man! Give me the Seth Rogen laugh.\" I was surprised that Seth actually did what they asked; I sure as hell wouldn't have. \"Seth Rogen, everybody!\" \"Always nice to be treated like the wall,\" I mumbled to Jay, who nodded grimly. \"Alright,\" Jay said once we were back in the car and on our way back to Seth's. I'd let him call shotgun. \"I've landed, I'm here, we've said our hellos; can we please go to fucking Carl's Jr.?!\" \"Ha!\" I shouted gleefully from the backseat. \"Thank you, Jay! See, I told you, I told you-\" I jabbed Seth on the shoulder. \"We should go to Carl's Jr.!\" Seth turned to raise an eyebrow at me, then turned his eyes back on the road. \"Er…\" he began apologetically. \"I would love to. I'm on a…\" \"If you say 'cleanse' one more time, I'm gonna junk-punch you,\" I warned him. \"I can't really eat that stuff right now,\" he back-pedalled. \"What.\" Jay sounded scandalized. \"I'm on this cleanse,\" Seth said quickly, and I kicked the back of his chair. \"You're on a what ?\" Now Jay just sounded confused, like the word 'cleanse' was Pig Latin or something. \"I'm on a cleanse,\" Seth repeated. \"You just sealed your junk-punch fate, my friend,\" I told him. Meanwhile, Jay was trying and failing to contain his disbelieving laughter. \" What ?\" he said again. \"It's good for you!\" Seth insisted. \"I didn't know- you're supposed to take six shits a day!\" \"Well that ' s total bullshit,\" I said. \"It's true!\" \"You're supposed to shit twice a day!\" said Jay. \"And even that's pushing it,\" I tacked on. \"No, that's not true,\" Seth attempted to explain. \"That's what they used to think. Now they know you're supposed to shit six times a day.\" \"Who is this 'they'?\" I asked. \"And how exactly are they testing how many times a day it's healthy to shit?\" \"So you're not drinking.\" Jay was trying to understand what Seth's 'cleanse' entailed, apparently. \"You're not smoking weed. You're not-\" \"No, no, I'm drinking and smoking weed,\" Seth corrected him. \"But-\" Jay frowned. \"You see why I said he's not cleansing?\" I said to him. \"What? I'm on a cleanse, I'm not psychotic,\" Seth joked. \"Look guys, if you stopped eating gluten, you'd feel way fucking better all day! Whenever you feel shitty, that's 'cause of gluten.\" \"That's not true!\" said Jay. \"It is true!\" \"Where the fuck does gluten even come into this?!\" I demanded. \"Who the fuck told you not to eat gluten?!\" asked Jay. \"It's just true!\" Seth persevered. \"You don't even know what gluten is!\" shouted Jay. \"I know what fucking gluten is!\" Seth argued. \"You have no idea what gluten is!\" \"I do know what gluten is!\" \"Do tell us, then,\" I challenged, folding my arms. \"Gluten's a vague term!\" he defended himself, already totally wrong. \"It's something that's used to categorise things that are bad, you know? Calories, that's a gluten. Fat, that's a gluten.\" I actually could not believe my ears. \"Are you being fucking serious?!\" \"Somebody just told you that you probably shouldn't eat gluten, and you're like,\" Jay arranged his facial features into a dumb expression and made his voice deeper. \"'Oh, I guess I shouldn't eat gluten'.\" \"Gluten means bad shit, man, and I'm not eating it,\" Seth said with an air of finality. And yet, it was fifteen minutes later that we found ourselves parked outside the nearest Carl's Jr., stuffing our faces with the various fried goods on the menu. The boys would not shut up making appreciative 'mmm' noises, something I was able to control myself. \"God!\" Seth basically moaned in delight. \"Each bite is better than the previous bite!\" \"It is,\" agreed Jay. \"Amen to that,\" I said, swallowing my mouthful of Sante Fe Chicken. \"Gluten!\" Seth cheered, and Jay and I raised our burgers up and cheered too. This really was what life was all about; good friends, good food and good times. I wouldn't want to change my life right now for absolutely anything. A/N- Well, I hope you enjoyed the first chapter! I ' m not exactly expecting a ton of feedback for this, as the This Is The End category is so small, so if you are reading, words can ' t describe how happy I would be if you ' d review! They mean so much, and I always take advice/ideas to heart! So please review! Xx Gee xX PS- If you go to my profile, there is a link to the model I have chosen to portray Mackenzie. Usually I use actors, but since this purpose of this movie was actors playing themselves, that wouldn ' t really work. I ' m also creating a Polyvore collection too, so have a look at that too! It ' s linked as ' Mackenzie ' s Style. '[Chapter 2] A/N- Well, I didn't expect to get reviews or follows this quickly, but there they are! That really has honestly surprised me. So thank you so much, CourtneyMisfitMarie, Mariah smiley, DemmarisAoka, Guest and Morgan for reviewing! Chapter Two- Cocaine Nose and Trendy Clothes Temporary home sweet temporary home. I loved Seth's place, especially since he had it all refurbished about eight months ago. Don't get me wrong, mine and Dave's place in the Hills was gorgeous too; we had all big glass walls, white exterior, marble pool area and crazy bright furniture inside that totally clashed with the classy-looking outside. But something about Seth's place just seemed more fun…maybe it was because he had an air hockey table and we didn't. \"Hey, this looks beautiful!\" Jay announced as the three of us walked through the front door. \"Yeah, do you like it?\" asked Seth. \"I totally redid it.\" \"It's fucking awesome!\" Jay replied appraisingly. \"It's all new,\" said Seth, beginning to point various things out as he led Jay through to the living room. \"Those are new.\" \"God damn , son!\" Jay exclaimed. \"It's pretty nice, huh?\" said Seth. \"So this is how the other half lives,\" Jay joked. \"God, I know right?\" I said, kicking off my flip-flops. \"I'm tempted to take up permanent residency. You'd love that, wouldn't you, Rogen?\" \"Yeah, Mack, because I'm sure your BF would really fucking appreciate that,\" he replied wryly. \"Hey, who ruled him out?\" I shot back. \"He's moving in too.\" \"Anyway,\" he said quickly. \"Look, we got air hockey tables,\" he said to Jay. \"Jesus Murphy!\" Wow, how boring was Montreal if this was the kind of reaction Jay had to typical LA life? \"Right? Okay, get ready Jay.\" Seth and I paused in the archway that led into the living room. \"Get your ass ready for the best weekend of your life,\" I said, gesturing into the room by throwing out my arm. Jay took one step in, saw what was on the coffee table and starting whooping, running round the sofa. I laughed; I'd never seen the man so excited. \"Look at it, man!\" said Seth, sitting down on the sofa with Jay. I just leant across the back cushion. \"Oh my…are you serious?!\" Jay said almost disbelievingly. \"We stocked up on all your favourite things!\" I said. \"Check it.\" \"Starbursts and Airheads on a…a...and it says Jay,\" he listed, his eyes settling on his name written out in blunts. \"In joints,\" Seth elaborated. \"In joints,\" Jay repeated. \"In joints,\" I also said. They both looked at me oddly. \"What? I wanted to get in on the joint lovin' too!\" \"It says Jay in jays,\" Seth continued. \"Now I know what you did while I got changed,\" I said. \"But I would just like to point out that the Starburst were my idea.\" \"Seth Rogen, Mackenzie Bolton,\" Jay said, sounding touched. \"You are just the best people.\" \"Oh sweetie,\" I said, hugging him round the neck from behind. \"We do try.\" \"Yeah, we know you don't love it in LA so we figure we'll make it…y'know, we'll lube up your entry a little,\" explained Seth. \"It eases the transition,\" agreed Jay. \"This is the much-needed foreplay.\" I pulled a disgusted face. \"Nice analogy, guys. And on that note,\" I slapped my hands on the sofa and stood up with a stretch. \"I shall leave you to your man time. I've got stuff to do anyway. Catch you on the flipside.\" That 'stuff' was the two hours it would take for me to get ready for Franco's party. I left the boys to it, grabbing some towels from my room and stepping into the en suite shower room, stripping off my sweats and crop top. Even through the sounds of the shower hammering against the glass shower door I could still hear what sounded like Jay and Seth running a fucking marathon. The Backstreet Boys' Everybody (Backstreet's Back) was also being played so often I was ready to go out there and throw the iPod dock out the goddamn window. Still, I was so happy that Jay was here, and that he was actually acting like he wanted to be here. I knew just how much he really did hate it in Los Angeles, what with his stupid hipster attitude to life, so being honest, actually managing to persuade him to get on a plane and fly over here was a miracle in itself. \"Everybody, yeah,\" I sang, massaging shampoo into my hair. \"Rock your body, yeah. Everybody, rock your body right. Backstreet's back, ALRIGHT!\" Okay, so I was officially going to kill those two for getting that fucking song stuck in my head. I shut off the shower and groped around for the towels that I'd dumped on the floor, eyes shut against the remaining suds that were attempting to battle their way into my retinas. I rubbed one against my face before tying my hair up in a towel turban and wrapped the other one around my soaking frame, padding into the bedroom and opening the wardrobe. Great. Now for the difficult part. What in the name of hell was I supposed to wear? A lot of famous people were gonna be there, like a lot. That called for more than my usual skinny-jeans-and-tank-top attire. But then again, it wasn't exactly like this was going to be a formal occasion! I couldn't turn up in one of my signature Hervé Leger bandage dresses like it was a red carpet event! GAH! Okay. Middle ground, middle ground… I thought desperately, flicking through the few clothes I'd brought to Seth's. Eventually, I settled on a pair of black shorts, glossy black tights, an orange camisole, a leather jacket and black spike-heeled ankle boots. That seemed like the happy medium. I dressed at a leisurely pace, then set to drying my hair with my hairdryer. I left it floating down in natural waves around my shoulders and down my back- my favourite style. I could never be bothered with all the curling tongs/hair mousse/hair gel/hair dye bullshit. I didn't apply any makeup yet; I'd wait until half an hour before we left. Instead, I went through to the guys to tell them they had an hour before we needed to move our asses. I walked in on Seth announcing, \"My eyes feel like they're melting.\" \"Because that's healthy,\" I commented, making them both jump. \"Jesus, Mack!\" gasped Jay. He turned round and looked at me. \"What're you all dressed up for?\" \"For…wait.\" I narrowed my eyes at Seth. \"Dude, you didn't tell him?\" \"Um…\" was all Seth said. \"For fuck sake, Rogen!\" I groaned, whacking the back of his head. \"Great. So you're gonna spring this on the poor man an hour before we leave?\" \"What are you guys talking about?\" Oh right. Jay was still in the room. \"Actually, Mack was just thinking-\" thwack . \"-ow! Mack and I were thinking that we should go to Franco's house soon. He's having a housewarming party; he just finished building his house. I haven't even seen it yet, but it's supposed to be bonkers!\" \"I can confirm that the house is indeed bonkers,\" I said. \"James emailed Dave some pics about two, three weeks ago just before they finished building. Seriously, that shit isn't a house; it's a fucking art piece.\" \"I haven't been in LA in like, a year,\" Jay pointed out. \"And I came here to chill with you guys.\" \"We can chill together, and we'll chill with those other guys,\" Seth suggested. \"Yeah, we can chill as a pack,\" I said. \"A pack of…chillers.\" \"Will I even know anyone there?\" Jay demanded. \"You know James Franco,\" Seth reminded him. \"James Franco can't even remember my name,\" Jay said bitterly. \"It's cool, he forgets it tonight and I elbow him in the dick,\" I said. \"No biggie. And hey, Jonah Hill's gonna be there too.\" \"Can't stand him, he can't stand me,\" Jay said. \"He's like the nicest guy in the world! He likes you so much!\" Seth sounded genuinely surprised, even though we knew there had been some tension between Jay and Jonah, right from our How To Train Your Dragon days. \"Out of nowhere, he just said, 'You know what? Jay's an inspiration'.\" Jesus, laying it on a bit thick, bro! Jay saw right through this. \"There is no way he said that, also, just can't stand him.\" \"Okay, fine,\" Seth said exasperatedly. \"Craig Robinson.\" \"Never met him,\" Jay said sulkily. He was getting beating down and was gonna crack, I could tell. \"He's an absolutely hilarious dude,\" I said, smiling. \"Yeah! He sweats a lot, but he's a great guy,\" added Seth. \"So it's gonna be fun, man.\" \" Pleeaasee come Jay!\" I begged, forcing myself into the gap between the guys and- somewhat irritatingly, I'm sure- began headbutting Jay's shoulder. \"Please, please, please, pleeaasee !\" \"Okay,\" he finally agreed. \"For you, I will go.\" \"Yesss!\" I cheered, fist-pumping the air. \"I promise, I'll stay with you all night,\" assured Seth. \"Okay?\" \"Yeah, and so will I,\" promised. \"See?\" Seth pointed at me. \"Mack's got your back too. We won't ditch you-\" At this point, Jay tried to interrupt him. \"No, because we want to be with you all night. Right, Mack?\" \"Fucking A-right, my man.\" \"And you know why else?\" he continued. He reached over me and caressed Jay's cheek. \"'Cause nobody puts Jay in the corner.\" Jay simply batted his hand away. So we succeeded in getting Jay into a taxi on the way to Franco's. So that was Miracle Number Two of the day. I myself was actually pretty buzzed for the party. I hadn't seen James in person in about a month, because the way I saw it FaceTime did not count. He'd been busy filming and sorting out the final details of his house, and I'd been prepping for filming to start on Kick-Ass 2 where I was playing Rosa Holmes, or Lady Katana, master swordswoman of the Toxic Mega Cunts. \"Come on Jay, smile!\" I said in a sing-song voice. \"It really won't be as bad as you think. I promise.\" Jay just continued to glower out the window. I kicked him in the shin. \" Smile , for fuck sake!\" \"I'm going to really hate this,\" he muttered. \"God, you are such a party pooper,\" I remarked. All he did was frown at me and glare out the taxi window. I was seriously resisting the urge to grab him by the scruff of his t-shirt, shaking him and scream, \"LIGHTEN THE FUCK UP!\" I watched his face growing steadily more and more sulky as we drove through Hollywood, and saw him form a face like thunder as soon as we pulled up outside Franco's insane-looking house. \"Awesome!\" said Seth as we drew to a stop. \"Holy shit,\" I breathed as I paid the cabbie and the three of us exited the taxi. \"It's even more impressive in person. Or would that be in house?\" \"This is crazy,\" Seth agreed. \"Yeah?\" Jay didn't sound so sure. Seth turned to look at him. \"Yeah, man, right? Look at it!\" \"It's a bit much,\" said Jay, ever the pessimist. \"I don't think it is too much,\" defended Seth. \"It's the right amount of 'much',\" I said. \"I think it's right on the money,\" said Seth. \"What is he, Pablo Escobar?!\" demanded Jay. \"Come on man, this is an awesome street!\" Seth tried to persuade him. \"Channing Tatum lives up there!\" \"For the love of-\" sighed Jay. \"Will you stop talking about-\" \"This is the sexiest street in America,\" Seth interrupted. \"What is it with you and Channing Tatum?\" I asked. \"I think he's attractive,\" Seth replied defensively. \"Yeah, you and ninety-two percent of the world,\" I retorted as we approached Franco's front door and Seth knocked. \"I think it's a cool house,\" he said. \"I know you do,\" said Jay, rolling his eyes. \"I can't wait to see inside it,\" Seth continued. \"That's why I'm excited!\" \"We get it!\" I said exasperatedly. \"You're excited! Just shut up, man!\" That was when the door opened. \"Ha-hey! Yes!\" cheered James, pulling Seth into a man-hug. \"What's up man?! Seth!\" \"Hey man, how's it going?\" \"Hey! Let's get some loving over here too!\" I exclaimed, pushing Seth behind me. \"What up, my brother!\" \"What's up, my brother's ho!\" he laughed, pulling me into a hug too. \"Mack, it's been way too long!\" \"Urgh, tell me about it,\" I replied as we let go of each other. \"This house better be worth it.\" \"You look taller,\" he commented. \"Yeah, well, I can never wear heels when your brother's around, can I?\" I quipped. \"Since he's such a short-ass that we're the same height.\" \"Wait, is he not here?\" \"Hate to say it, but no,\" I said regretfully. \"Filming's delayed, which is so totally shit.\" \"Fuck. Well, I'm so happy you're both here,\" he said. \"We're so happy to be here,\" said Seth. \"Hey, Johnny, what's up?\" James said heartily, shaking Jay's hand. \"It's just Jay,\" he corrected in a tone that was one hundred percent 'just don't act like I'm bothered by this. FYI, I'm really bothered by this.' \"It's Jay,\" I affirmed. \"How many times have I gotta remind you, Franco? Seriously, you get his name wrong again and I will straight-up elbow you in the dick. Got it?\" \"I'll never forget it again, man,\" he said, quickly hugging Jay too, who looked very uncomfortable. \"Good to see you! Come on in,\" he invited. \"Yeah. Yeah, great,\" Jay said, his false enthusiasm already faltering. \"Check it out!\" James announced, gesturing around the huge living area we were now standing in. \"My new place!\" \"Awesome, man!\" Seth said admiringly. I merely repeated my sentiments from earlier. \"Ho-ly shit, dude. This is crazy!\" \"Designed it myself,\" James said proudly. \"I can tell,\" I teased. \"This place has 'James Franco's twisted imagination' written all over it. Especially the dick statue.\" I jerked my thumb in the direction of said statue. \"Compensating for anything?\" \"Well, I think it's really cool,\" said Seth. \"This place is beautiful, man.\" \"Kiss-ass,\" I mock-coughed. \"This place is like a piece of me,\" James said in his typical melodramatic way. \"You three just stepped inside me.\" Jay and I both pulled revolted faces, but Seth carried on the joke with, \"You let us all come inside you. Yeah.\" \"The icing on the cake,\" James said mysteriously. \"Check it out.\" He gestured up, and revealed to us two hand-painted canvasses that read James Franco and Seth Rogen. The A in James and Franco spread through both the names, and the Es in Seth and Rogen were linked too. \"Painted them myself.\" \"We can tell,\" I said. \"I'm more than a little offended that I'm not up there too.\" \"Your name's too long,\" he teased. He looked at Seth for his reaction. \"Side by side. A team.\" \"Holy shit,\" Seth said with a laugh. \"So is it…weird?\" James asked anxiously, or as close to anxious as James could get. \"No,\" Seth assured him, but I did catch Jay nodding his head, though quickly turned this into a shake of 'no.' \"You sure?\" James pressed. \"I really like it,\" Seth promised. \"So Kenzie, what do you think?\" \"I think I'd like it more if my name was up there too.\" \"What do you think, Jay?\" Well, props to the man for actually getting Jay's name right. Jay shrugged. \"I'm not a big art guy.\" \"Oh shit,\" I said under my breath. Don't ever, ever, ever say you don't like art in front of James Franco unless you want a ten-minute lecture on how everything around you is, in fact, art. \"You don't like art?\" James asked. Oh Jesus, right on cue. \"Well, come on,\" Jay said. \"I-\" \"You play video games?\" James cut across him. \"Yes,\" Jay replied warily. \"Well guess what, buddy? You like art.\" \"Yup,\" Jay said with a nod. \"You ever been to Subway?\" \"Yes.\" \"You order a sandwich? Someone put that together for you, dude. That's art.\" \"Sandwich artist,\" Seth tacked on. \"So let me lay this on you, Jay,\" James said. \"Oh fuck,\" Jay and I said in unison, as I knew exactly what was coming, having had the same lecture a couple of months back. \"Your momma's pussy was the canvas, your dad's dick was the paintbrush. Boom-\" he clicked at Jay. \"You're the art. Huh?\" Jay clearly had literally no idea how to reply. \"Thanks, James Franco.\" \"And on that highly disturbing note,\" I said, flicking my hair over my shoulder. \"I'm going to mingle. Seth, Jay, Franco.\" I nodded at them each in turn before turning on my heel. \"Oh my God, Jason!\" I shrieked, throwing my arms out. \"It's been forever, bro!\" \"Hey, Mackenzie!\" Jason Segel replied, giving me a hug. \"Long time, no see!\" \"How many years has it been?\" I asked. \"Like, four, yeah?\" \"Something like that,\" he replied. \"So how's How I Met Your Mother 's most hated character these days?\" My character Tamara had been a complete bitch, your typical spoiled rich daddy's girl who dangled Ted on a string for months. There had been hate mail sent to the screenwriters to have her violently killed off- and I loved it. \"I'm good. Awesome, actually,\" I said with a smile. \"I've got some good projects lined up in the next few months and they're looking positive. Yourself?\" Jason and I spent a good fifteen minutes catching up on news from the last four years. Then I saw someone else across the room. \"Dude. Dude. Dude !\" I exclaimed, clutching his arm. \"It's Rihanna! Oh my God, it's Rihanna! I fucking love her! Holy fuck! I gotta go talk to her!\" And before Jason could even reply, I was speeding across the room to where Rihanna was standing by a table near…oh fantastic. Michael Cera. Over the last couple of years, Michael had turned into a real douchebag. We'd been good friends; great friends, actually. From Superbad right up until a couple of Christmases ago, Michael and I had been pretty close. But then he discovered the joys of cocaine. I won't deny it, I've taken coke in the past. Twice, to be exact. I hated both times, and had vowed to stick to the floatier stuff like weed and shrooms. But Michael got totally hooked on it, and now could barely live without the stuff. So now, every time I saw him he was totally coked off his nut, unable to string more than two sentences together. Tonight would clearly be no exception as I watched him vacuum up three lines in as many seconds. \"What's up Kenzie?\" he slurred at me as I approached. \"Hi Mike,\" I said contemptuously, barely looking at him. I really couldn't be fucked with his shit right now. \"You're looking smoking hot tonight, darlin',\" he drawled, attempting to squeeze my ass, so I quickly grabbed his wrist and twisted his arm around. \"You even try and touch my ass, Cera, and I will give you a stump where your hand used to be,\" I snarled, thrusting his hand back at him. \"Got it?\" \"Chill out, beautiful,\" he said infuriatingly, so I made a noise of discontentment back as I approached Rihanna. \"Hey, Rihanna,\" I said excitedly, offering my hand to her. \"I am a huge fan! It's so great to meet you!\" \"Thanks,\" she said, shaking my hand (I had to refrain from squealing in fangirl delight) \"You're Mackenzie, right?\" \"Yeah, I am,\" I replied. \"You know of me?\" Try to remain calm. Try to remain calm. An A-list celebrity knows your name. It's fine. Just chill. JUST CHILL. \"Yeah, y'know, I've seen you in some stuff,\" she said. \"You were in 21 Jump Street right?\" \"Yeah, I was,\" I said. \"Hi Rihanna,\" said Jason, coming up behind me. \"Hey Jason,\" she replied, smiling at him. We talked as a three-way for a while, and I literally couldn't get it into my head that I was talking to Rihanna. The press always portrayed her as a conceited, arrogant bitch, but in reality she was pretty nice…if a little aggressive. \"I've seen a shrink maybe twice?\" I said. \"Once when I was nineteen, after my Mom died, and then I saw one in 2008 when all of my work just got on top of me and I freaked out from the stress.\" And by 'freaked out' I mean I smashed up my neighbour's car and got two hundred hours community service for it. I went full-out Britney Spears, minus the head shaving. \"So, Ri-Ri, what about you?\" Jason asked. \"You ever see a psychiatrist?\" \"Um…\" She thought for a few moments when there was this sudden whack sound as Michael slapped her ass. Rihanna didn't even hesitate as she turned around and full-on bitch-slapped Michael clean in the face, the sound of the blow echoing through the packed room. Michael reeled backwards, clutching his ear. \"That's not cool!\" \"Don't touch my butt, bitch!\" she warned him. \"Michael, that's not cool!\" Jason said. \"Shut the fuck up, Jason!\" Michael shouted, slapping the table. \"We're playing a game, man!\" Jason raised his hands in armistice and Michael grinned cockily at Rihanna. \"Say cheese, baby.\" \"Wow. I need some air,\" I said quickly, eyeing up the open back doors. \"I'll see you guys around.\" I moved as quickly as I could to put a wall between myself and Michael. I spent a few moments catching up with Craig Robinson, who I hadn't seen for about ten months, and Emma Watson, who was quick to pick up on and admire the Harry Potter -themed tattoo on my left wrist. I'd had Always written in simple black scripture with a Deathly Hallows symbol for the A after I'd seen the final movie; it was my all-time favourite book series. I was standing by the pool by myself, sipping from a plastic cup of vodka and cranberry when I felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned and came face-to-face with Chris Mintz-Plasse, my Superbad co-star and close friend. There'd been some speculation on set if we'd get together, but the only intimate moment we'd ever shared was the world's most awkward kiss between Fogell and Clarissa at the party. \"Fogell! Hi!\" I shrieked, my absolute favourite line from the movie, putting my arms around him and hugging him close. \"Hey Kenzie, how are you?\" he asked, hugging me back. \"I'm great! Hey, I got my script for Kick-Ass the other day,\" I said. \"Have you got yours?\" \"Yeah, I got it I think, on Monday.\" \"I assume that, um,\" I cleared my throat awkwardly. \"You read page ninety-three yet?\" Chris blushed a little. \"You mean the sex scene?\" \"No, I mean the totally unwilling, borderline rape sex scene,\" I said grimly. \"The totally unwilling, borderline rape sex scene where I nearly cut your dick off with a katana. That's gonna be fun to film.\" \"What are we filming?\" a very familiar voice questioned, and Jonah Hill walked into view, grinning his typical 'I like to think of myself as America's Sweetheart' grin. \"Jonah, my man!\" I said, clasping his hand and backslapping him. \"Aw, look at this! The Superbad crew reunited.\" \"We should totally do a sequel,\" Jonah suggested. \"Like, life after college. We'd smash the box office!\" \"Yeah, we totally would! Oh my God, brainstorm moment!\" I exclaimed \"Plot twist: Clarissa and Seth are married now and have like two kids and Seth totally hates his life and Rissa is literally a pen away from signing the divorce papers! And Fogell should be gay,\" I added as an afterthought. \"What?! Why is Fogell gay!?\" demanded Chris. \"Because it works,\" I insisted. \"And Evan should just, like, be dead. He got hit by a bus. Saves us from having to work with Michael in his current…state, shall we say.\" \"Hey, he's not that bad,\" said Jonah, but he did frown. And it was at that moment that Michael chose to stumble his way over to us, bleary-eyed and grinning like a maniac. \"Reunion!\" he slurred. \"Hey, let's get on that sequel, bitches.\" \"For fuck sake, Michael,\" I sighed. \"You're totally fucked up. Again.\" \"Shut the fuck up Kenzie,\" he snapped. \"You're so boring now! Hey Chris!\" he added, way peppier. \"How's it going?\" Chris laughed uneasily. \"Hey, does this coke smell funny?\" Michael asked, and he suddenly blew a handful of white powder into Chris' face. \"Fuck, Michael!\" Chris spluttered, wiping his face frantically. \"Michael, what the fuck, man!\" demanded Jonah. \"What the fuck is wrong with you?!\" I yelled at him, grabbing Chris by the shoulders and trying to calm him down. Michael was oblivious to mine and Jonah's outbursts. \"That's expensive shit, motherfucker!\" \"What are you doing?!\" said Jonah. \"I've never fucking done cocaine, dude!\" Chris shrieked, still wiping at his face. \"Why does it fucking…?!\" he trailed off, looking terrified. \"Well you did the best shit possible for your first time,\" Michael said smugly. \"Because that's good fucking-\" \"Fuck, fuck, fuck!\" Chris' panicking totally cut across Michael's stupid spiel. \"I'm nervous, dude! I don't know what-!\" He looked at Jonah and I for help. \"What is wrong with you, man?!\" exclaimed Jonah, putting a warning hand on Michael's upper arm. \"Look, he's freaking out!\" Michael laughed at Chris. \"Chris, just chill out!\" I ordered, seizing his head and making him look at me. \"You are fine! I promise you!\" \"I've never done this fucking drug before, man!\" he yelped, pulling away from me. \"Mike, please!\" Jonah attempted to stop Michael manhandling Chris even more. Instead, Michael leaned in close to Chris' face. \"I'll walk you through it. I will walk you through it.\" \"Michael, no one is asking-\" I began angrily, but he physically put his hand over my mouth to shut me up. Bastard. \"I'll be your guide,\" he insisted, getting even more up in Chris' grill. \"You're fine, Chris,\" Jonah was assuring him. \"You're fine.\" \"You got some in your moustache, baby!\" Michael said almost seductively, looking like he was about to kiss Chris as he blew on the poor man's face. \"What are you-\" Chris shouted, pushing him back. \"Michael!\" That was when I bit the hand Michael still had over my mouth. \"Fuck off, Cera!\" I screamed, shoving him back violently and causing him to crash down to the stone floor. I jerked my jacket sleeve back up my arm angrily, as it had fallen down when I'd shoved him. \"Kenzie, you bitch! That fucking hurt!\" he whined, lurching to his feet and stumbling back into the house. I turned back to Chris and Jonah, breathing heavily. \"You see why I want him killed off now?!\" They both nodded slowly. \"Thought so.\" A/N- Again, I just wanna say thank you so much for the feedback I've already received!

Chapter Three- Sorry, But The Party's Over \" For fuck sake, Seth!\" grumbled Clarissa, stumbling after her best friend. \"Slow the fuck down!\" \" Hurry the fuck up, then!\" he retorted, barely slowing down in his mission to get to the soccer pitch. \"Jesus, Rissa, do you have to be so slow?!\" \" Heels, Seth! Heels!\" she shouted, slowing to a complete stop and bracing herself on her jean-clad knees. \"Oh my God, I think I'm having a fucking heart attack!\" \" We don't have time for this!\" Seth shouted back, doing a U-turn so he could grab Clarissa by the arm and drag her along beside him. \" I hate you,\" she panted, dragging her feet along the floor. \"What is it that you have to tell us that is sooo important that you have to tell us right now ?\" \" It's Jules, man,\" he answered, not tearing his eyes away from the entrance to the soccer field. \"It's fucking Jules!\" \" Oh for fuck sake,\" Clarissa sighed, not bothering to even question it further. Yet more deluded thoughts about Jules from Seth's deluded mind that would in no way echo anything that could possibly happen in real life. However, Seth still insisted on dragging her on to the field with him, right into the middle of Evan's PE class. Fan-fucking-tastic. \" Evan!\" the coach was shouting. \"Get into the game!\" \" Kick it over to me,\" Evan said feebly as Seth and Clarissa staggered to a running stop in front of him. \" Seth! Clarissa!\" the coach shouted. \"Get off the field!\" Clearly it was not the first time the two of them had interrupted his lesson. \" Guys, get out of here,\" said Evan. \"They're gonna make me run laps again.\" \" I don't even want to be here!\" Clarissa complained. \"I've been dragged here by force!\" \" Dudes, just fucking listen, okay?\" Seth panted. Running had never really been his forte. \"Jules and her stupid fucking friend came up to me, and they asked me to buy her alcohol! But not just for her, for the whole party! Do you realise what that means?\" \" That she's only fucking talking to you because you were probably stupid enough to mention that Fogell's getting a fake ID but passed it off as you being the one getting the ID?\" Clarissa supplied. She'd known Seth way too long. \" No! It means that by some divine miracle, we were paired up and she actually thought of me!\" Seth retorted. \"Thought of me enough to decide that I was the guy she would trust with the whole fun-ness of her party!\" \" Jesus fucking Christ,\" Clarissa muttered to herself, putting her head in her hand. \" She wants to fuck me!\" Seth continued, oblivious. \"She wants my dick, in or around her mouth.\" \" Are you fucking kidding?!\" Clarissa exploded. \" This is what you dragged me out of AP Biology for?!\" \" Rissa's right, man,\" said Evan. \"Did you ever think that maybe she's just using you to get her alcohol? She doesn't want your dick.\" \" See?\" Clarissa said smugly, putting an arm around Evan's shoulders. \"He knows what I'm sayin'.\" \" No!\" insisted Seth. \"She's got an older brother. She could've asked him but she asked me ! She looked me in the eyes and said, 'Seth, Momma's making a pubie salad and I need some Seth's Own dressing'! She's DTF! She's down to fuck, man! P in vagi! She wants to fuck!\" He grunted as he kicked a soccer ball away from the three of them. \" You chauvinistic asswipe,\" Clarissa said scornfully. \" Tonight is the night that fucking is an actual possibility!\" Seth totally blanked her. \" You just sound like an idiot! You're not gonna be able to sleep with her, man,\" Evan said reasonably. \" No. Dude, I know,\" Seth said, quieter now. \"I talk a lot of shit, okay? But she's gonna be at the party and she's gonna be drunk! And she likes me at least a little, enough to get with me! At the very least I'll make out with her! Two weeks, hand job. Month, blowjob, whatever, whatever! And then I make her my girlfriend! And I've got like two solid months of sex. By the time college rolls around, I'll be like the Iron Chef of pounding vag!\" \" I'm gonna fucking kill you so hard, Seth,\" Clarissa warned. \"So hard. Seriously. Sleep with one eye open.\" \" Can you guys get out of here and we'll talk about this later?\" Evan begged as his soccer team appeared to converge around them. One of them was Greg, the typical high school soccer jock, and a typical asshole because of it. \" What the fuck, Evan!\" he shouted, running past. \"We're down two points!\" \" Oh, shut the fuck up, Greggy!\" Clarissa snarled at him. \"It's fucking soccer! Take your two points and deep-throat them, cunt-biscuit!\" She made a jerking off motion at her mouth. \" Fuck you, Clarissa,\" he snapped back, coming to a stop. \" Hey Greg, why don't you go piss your pants again?\" Seth suggested mockingly. \" That was like eight years ago, asshole!\" Greg riposted, clearly embarrassed. \" People don't forget,\" Seth told him as he ran off. \" Look, as much as I really, really want to hear the rest of this charming tale,\" Clarissa said sarcastically. \"I told the teacher I was going to the bathroom so everyone now probably thinks I have fucking explosive diarrhoea.\" -Superbad, 2007 When I eventually found Seth and James, Seth was stoned, as per usual, and James was pretty half-baked himself. I sat down next to James with a huff, and they both stopped laughing to look at me. \"Hey Mack, how're you enjoying the party?\" James asked, putting his arm around my shoulders and giving me a squeeze. I did the same to him. James really was like the big brother I'd always wanted; huggable, protective and funny…if a total egotistical asshole most of the time. After being an only child my whole life, being part of the Franco family made me feel so warm on the inside. \"You've got a good shindig going on here, Franco,\" I said, looking around the crowded room. \"But, er, if at any point you see Michael Cera bleeding from the arm or anywhere else, I can assure you was not my fault.\" \"Jesus, Mack, what did you do to him?\" Seth groaned, rubbing his eyes with his thumb and index finger. \"Nothing…bad,\" I said innocently. \"Mack.\" That came from James, who was putting on his 'serious brother' voice. \"Nothing that bad, I promise,\" I swore. They both still looked doubtful. \"C'mon, y'all. Why you actin' s'picious?\" I drawled at them, stealing one of James' signature lines from Spring Breakers . \"Alright fine,\" he laughed. \"We believe you.\" \"Hey, gimme some of that!\" I demanded, holding my hand out for the joint he was holding. He handed it over and I took a deep drag, but I inhaled wrong and started choking. \"Shit!\" I spluttered, handing it back. \"It's like being back on the set of Pineapple Express !\" \"Weird you'd say that,\" Seth said with a grin. \"We were just talking about the sequel.\" \"Woah, woah, woah. Hold up,\" I said. \"We're doing a sequel and you didn't tell me?! You dicks!\" \"It's a work in progress,\" Seth explained. \"We don't even know how it's gonna end.\" He went on to explain how Red would now be the main drug lord since Dale and Saul killed Ted, and Mandy, my character, now doubled as his bodyguard as well as his main assassin. Red wants Dale and Saul to assassinate Woody Harrelson because he's going to give a speech to make weed legal in the US, making Red's work useless, and if they don't kill him, then Mandy will kill them. \"And I sacrifice myself for Dale, and Red's gonna fucking eat me!\" James finished enthusiastically. \"That's fucked up, man,\" I said, wrinkling my nose in distaste. \"What the fuck kinda movie do you want this to be?! That's sick! Ew! You know what I think? I think Mandy should have like a total change of heart! Like, she sees Saul going to sacrifice himself and like steps in at the last minute to try to save him!\" \"That could work,\" Seth said thoughtfully. \"I like that.\" \"Oh yeah!\" I cheered, high-fiveing them both. \"Can you say 'character development'?\" However, all my enthusiasm suddenly drained from my body when I heard the song that had just started playing. When you're ready, come and get it, Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na. You ain't gotta worry, it's an open invitation. I'll be sittin' right here, real patient. All day, all night, I'll be waitin', stand by. Can't stop because I love it, Hate the way I love you. \"Oh, fuck no!\" I spat out, clenching my fists. \"Turn it off!\" Wow. Find someone pettier than me, I challenge you. It had been a year since my failed Spring Breakers audition, and I still couldn't stomach the thought of Selena fucking Gomez, much less stomach the sound of her fucking little-girly voice. \"Woah, Mack, take it easy!\" James said, flinching away as I had just screeched in his ear. \"The stupid bitch stole my role!\" I yelled, grabbing his arm. \"I can't listen to this! Turn it the fuck off! NOW !\" Not too long later, a little while after James had hastily changed the song, the entire party had gathered around Craig and his keyboard. Everyone, including myself, was pretty stoned and very drunk, so the mood was nice and mellow for us all. I was stood in between Craig and James, nodding my head to the notes Craig was playing. \"Now fellas, I want you to get real sexy right now,\" Craig said softly, playing out a few opening notes. \"We're gonna sing to all the ladies. All the fellas go like this, in your Barry White voice: take your panties off,\" he sang. \"Take your panties off!\" all the guys in the room sang back. \"Take your panties off!\" \"Take your panties off!\" \"Come on, Rihanna, take your panties off for me!\" Craig crooned. \"Come on, Craig, can you fuck off for me?\" she sang back, swaying her head in time with the music. Everyone cheered for her, followed by some laughing. \"I'll do one of them things,\" Craig replied with a cheeky grin. \"What about the host of the party?\" he suggested, looking at James, who had his arm around Seth. \"I ain't got no panties on!\" James kind of shout-sung, closing his eyes. \"He ain't got no panties!\" sang Craig. \"Everybody!\" \"We ain't got no panties on!\" James, Seth and I yelled, some of the other guests behind us joining in. \"We ain't got no panties on!\" repeated Craig. \"We ain't got no panties on!\" the three of us continued, James now draping his other arm around my shoulders. We started dancing- well, I'd say bopping, actually. \"We ain't got no panties on!\" \"We ain't got no panties on!\" \"Ain't nobody got no panties on!\" \"We ain't got no panties on!\" At that point, you could mainly hear James shrieking over the top of everyone else. \"Ain't no party like a no-panty party 'cause a no-panty party don't stop!\" Craig sang so quickly I thought he was about to explode. \"Fuck those panties!\" yelled James. \"Fuck those…\" I trailed off as everyone kept singing, as I realised that Jay had apparently vanished from the crowd. I removed myself from under James' arm and went looking for him, finding him leaning against a wall outside, smoking. \"Hey, dude,\" I said, putting my hand on his arm. \"You alright?\" \"I guess,\" he replied, taking his cigarette out of his mouth and exhaling the smoke. \"Jay, please try to have fun,\" I said desperately. \"You're one of my best friends, and I hate seeing you all down and stepped on and shit.\" \"I told you I'd hate it here,\" he reminded me, stubbing his cigarette out on the wall. \"Is it that bad?\" I asked gently. He nodded. \"Maybe you just need a breather. Come on, I'm munchie-ing hard. Let's get Seth and go to this little convenience store a few blocks away. Okay?\" He sighed. \"Yeah, alright.\" So we headed back into the house to find Seth, James and Jonah sitting around a coffee table with Mindy Kaling, Martin Starr, Kevin Hart and a few other people. \"Yo, Rogen!\" I said loudly when we reached them. \"Hey Jay!\" Jonah said, smiling. \"Kenzie!\" I nodded at him and smiled back. \"Oh, hey, hi Jonah,\" Jay said uncomfortably. \"Listen, we're gonna go get some cigarettes and candy from that store that's about four blocks away,\" I said, speaking solely to Seth. \"You wanna come?\" \"Sure, give me this much time,\" he said, gesturing at his joint. \"This much joint time.\" And in that time, Jay left to go to the bathroom, only to return seconds later looking thoroughly revolted as he revealed he had walked in on Michael Cera about to receive a two-way blowjob. I hastily dropped the ice pop I'd been about to bite into. It was about half eleven at night when we wound up on the streets of LA. It was dark, and starting to get cold, so I was pretty grateful for my pantyhose and leather jacket. Whilst Seth and I were making conversation, Jay stayed moodily quiet, keeping his hands thrust in his hoodie pockets. \"You okay, man?\" Seth finally asked him. \"You seem even more down,\" I commented, frowning. \"It's nothing. It's just…you know, as soon as we got there, you both did what you said you wouldn't do,\" Jay accused. \"Hey man, back up!\" I said angrily. \"What did we do!?\" questioned Seth, sounding genuinely confused. \"You both fucking ditched my ass!\" \"We didn't ditch you!\" defended Seth. \"Are you kidding me, man?!\" \"We did not ditch you!\" I said, glaring. \"I said I was going to mingle! If you had a problem with that, you should have fucking said something, bro!\" \"Yeah, and I was talking to Jonah and then you left to go have a cigarette,\" said Seth. \"Well, you know, my cigarette was an excuse,\" said Jay. \"I really went outside 'cause Jonah was being a prick.\" \"Jonah was not being a prick!\" Seth replied. \"Maybe you're the one being a prick here, Jay!\" I snapped. \"Jonah is so nice; he's trying his damn hardest to settle all this shit with you!\" \"Oh my God, that's a thin veneer of kindness!\" Jay insisted as we got to the convenience store. \"Nobody's that nice!\" \"Jonah is that nice!\" persisted Seth. \"Serial killers are that nice!\" Jay retorted. \"Just answer me one question,\" Seth said, in a clear attempt to change the topic. \"Is Michael Cera's butthole as adorable as I picture?\" \"Oh for fuck sake,\" Jay sighed, opening the shop door. \"Of all the questions,\" I said, entering the shop, blinking in the harsh light. \"I picture it looking like a little doughnut,\" Seth continued. \"Like a little pink sprinkled doughnut.\" He recoiled at the sudden florescent light. \"It's so bright in here.\" \"It is fucking bright,\" agreed Jay. \"I'm so high,\" groaned Seth as the three of us immediately went down the candy aisle. \"At least you guys can rub your eyes,\" I grumbled, pointing at my heavy eyeliner. I deliberated over the candy for a little while, eventually selecting a Hershey's bar. Meanwhile, as I headed over to the drinks chiller to grab a few cans of Arizona iced tea, I overheard a man arguing with the woman behind the register to let his daughter use their bathroom. The old bitch refused them, saying customers only. \"This cash register lady is mean,\" Seth whispered as Jay, clutching a bottle of orange soda, and I rejoined him. \"I have anxiety, will you buy this for me?\" He held out his Milky Way to me and Jay. \"When I'm stoned, I can't do this.\" \"I got ya, buddy,\" I said, taking the chocolate. \"Jay, you want me to get yours too?\" \"Listen, I think I'm just gonna head back to Seth's place,\" he said apologetically. \"I'm not really liking it very much over there at Franco's.\" \"Dude, come on,\" I said, starting to get royally pissed at his negativity. \"We want you to get to know these guys!\" Seth told him. \"That's never gonna happen if you don't put in any effort whatsoever, okay?\" \"I hate it in there,\" Jay stressed. \"I just want to drink some pop and smoke some weed.\" That was when an almighty shake rocked the whole store, the windows shattering behind us. Everyone in the store shrieked. \"EARTHQUAKE!\" I screamed, clutching hold of Jay and burying my head in his shoulder, my eyes squeezed shut as Jay put his arms around me tightly. The shaking continued; I could feel it, could hear the sounds of glass smashing, of wood creaking, metal clanging, cars honking, Seth yelping in fear. \"Jay, what's going on?!\" I yelled, refusing to open my eyes or even release the poor man from my stranglehold. \"Jesus Christ!\" was all he said, sounding mesmerized. \"Mack! Mack!\" He tried to pull me off him, but I clung on. \"Mackenzie, it's over!\" He pulled a final time, and I did let go, brushing my hair out of my face. He was right; the shaking was over. The store was now empty, aside for me and him, Seth and the register lady. Seth must have fallen over, as he stumbled to his feet and grabbed hold of Jay and I. \"Are you okay?!\" he asked us frantically. \"Are you okay?!\" I nodded, but Jay appeared to go into shock, unable to form any words at all. \"Did you see that?!\" screeched the register lady. \"What the hell-\" Her words were cut short as a huge chunk of concrete ceiling fell down on top of her, spraying blood all over the back wall of the store. \"Holy mother of fuck!\" I screamed at the same time Jay shrieked, \"Oh my God! Jesus! Jesus!\" \"Run!\" Seth ordered. \"Run, run!\" So we did. Well, after I'd shoved my chocolate and cans of iced tea into my bag. It wasn't like the old bat would be doing inventory now. Jay and I jumped through the now-empty windowpane whilst Seth actually took the time to exit through the fucking door. \"This way!\" Jay shouted, pointing down the main road. Well I sure as hell wasn't gonna argue with him. LA was in total chaos; people running all over the place, cars driving on the wrong side of the road, trees falling and fallen down, buildings were on fire and Jay, Seth and I had to make a dramatic turn to narrowly avoid being run over. The car in question flew past us and through the shop window, pummelling through exactly where we'd been standing moments earlier. So what did the three of us do? Stand there like fucking morons, screaming at the car. \"Oh my God!\" spluttered Jay. \"Jesus!\" Seth cried, pulling Jay and I out of the way so we avoided a second car ploughing into us. We stared as the car sped straight into another poor soul with a would-be-comical thunk noise. Cue more screaming. \"We need to fucking get out of here!\" I screeched, turning on my heel and sprinting, the two idiots close behind me. \"Why the fuck did you being me down here?!\" Jay yelled at me, and I shot him the finger as we side-stepped a shit-ton of sparks spitting out of a fallen power line. Still screaming, I might add. \"I don't know what's happening!\" Seth bawled as a taxi frantically beeped its horn at us from behind. \"What do we do?!\" I cried, fear coursing through me. \"We're going back to Franco's!\" he shouted. \"Why?!\" demanded Jay, so I punched him on the arm. \"Stop being a whiny bitch!\" I yelled. \"Just run!\" barked Seth. \"Keep running!\" We made a dramatic right-angled turn to avoid getting mown down by yet another car, which went smashing into the taxi that had just passed us and burst into flames. \"Oh my fuck!\" Jay shrieked as the three of us clung together in a weird three-way hug-type-thing. \"We. Are going. Back. To Franco's!\" Seth commanded, shaking Jay a little. \"Oh, goddamn it!\" Jay groaned, and I had to fight the urge to trip him up several times as we ran the remaining three blocks back, and even as we reached the pavement outside Franco's, we still nearly got completely smushed by a passing fire truck. \"This way!\" Seth was shouting. \"We're almost there! We're so close!\" We burst through the door, gasping and panting, barely able to breathe. Everyone turned to stare at us as I pushed the door shut, limping on my now very sore feet. Fucking stilettos. \"Hey, are you guys okay?\" James questioned us from his position sitting in his weird hanging bubble chair. \"Are you guys okay?!\" Seth asked him. \"There was a crazy earthquake! Did you guys feel that?!\" \"That was insane,\" Jay said almost inaudibly, his hand over his mouth. \"I think I shit myself,\" I announced tremulously. I turned around and tried to look at my ass. \"Seriously, someone look for stains. Come on, Franco, you must have felt it! It was huge!\" \"Fuck no,\" he smugly replied. \"We can't feel anything in here. This place is a fucking fortress!\" \"That wasn't an earthquake, guys,\" Jay said quietly to Seth and me. \"That was something way fucking crazier.\" \"What's crazier than an earthquake?\" Craig asked, not even looking up from rolling his joint. \"There…there were beams of blue light coming out of the sky,\" Jay said jadedly. \"And people getting sucked up into the sky.\" \"He's on hallucinogens,\" joked Aziz Ansari, and the dickheads around him all laughed. \"Come on, guys,\" said Jonah, stepping out of the crowd. \"Don't bully Jay, he's a sweetheart.\" He looked encouragingly at Jay. \"Keep going, man. What are you talking about?\" \"There, there were people, and they were there, and they got sucked up into the sky,\" Jay explained, sounding more and more tired as he spoke. \"Jay, what are you talking about?\" I frowned. I was so confused. I mean, I'd been there…and I hadn't seen any of this. \"Sucked up into the sky?\" James questioned with a mocking tone. He spread out his arms to gesture around the room. \"Nobody got sucked up in here!\" \"I got sucked off here,\" Michael decided to pipe up, trying to give the blonde next to him a high-five; she just looked awkward and tried to move away. Everyone seemed to find this hilarious, but I just scowled. Man, I really hated that guy. \"No, okay, ask Seth! Ask Mack!\" Jay insisted. \"Guys, you were there!\" he said to us. \"Tell them!\" \"Seth? Kenzie? What the fuck's he talking about?\" James couldn't have sounded any less interested if he tried. Seth laughed nervously. \"I have no idea what he's talking about, honestly. Mack?\" \"Well…I didn't really see what was going on…\" I said lamely, because I wanted to support Jay, even if he sounded totally insane. \"Did anybody get sucked up into the sky?\" James ridiculed, sardonically raising his arms and waving them a bit. \"I didn't see anything,\" Seth replied. \"I don't know what he's talking about.\" \"Hey!\" I hissed in his ear. \"No need to be so dismissive, man!\" \"You were there with me!\" Jay said disbelievingly. \"What are you saying?! All those people that were in the store with us, they just fucking vanished. Mackenzie, please back me up on this!\" \"Jay, I really didn't see anything!\" I said ruefully. \"I had my eyes covered the whole time!\" \"And I didn't see blue light sucking people up in the sky!\" Seth said. \"You sound crazy, man! We should just be lucky we're-\" The house suddenly started shaking, the pictures on the walls rattling around and everyone gasping in surprise. \"It's not over!\" shouted Jay. \"It's the aftershocks!\" I elaborated. \"Fucking earthquakes.\" \"Everyone, it's alright. Just a little tremor,\" James said calmly, standing up. \"Party's still going. In-N-Out truck's coming in ten minutes!\" I'm sure everyone's cheering would have lasted longer if the house hadn't been rocked by yet another quake or whatever the hell was going on. \"Oh my fuck!\" Jay shouted for about the eighth time in the last hour, grabbing me by the hand and dragging me outside. This time, though, everyone had the sense to actually fucking listen to him, and the entire party came speeding out the front door after us. Even James came out, but he was mostly yelling at everyone to get off his new grass. But nobody was listening to him. Nobody was looking at him. \"What the fuck?!\" exclaimed Jay as we stopped abruptly, starting up at the fireball that was the Hollywood Hills. All the screaming stopped. Nobody knew what to say. Nobody knew what to do. It was like the world had frozen. I was the first to find my voice. \" MY HOUSE! MY FUCKING HOUSE IS UP THERE! \" I took a few shaky steps forward, getting ready to run, when Jay clamped his hands down on my shoulders and dragged me back to his side. \"Mack, are you fucking insane!?\" he spluttered. I just looked at him through wide, tear-filled eyes. My house…my clothes…my furniture…my…oh my God. \" THE CATS !\" I now screamed, struggling against Jay's hold. \"Our cats are still there! Dear God, someone get the cats! Don't let them die!\" \"Mack, stop it!\" Jay grunted as he fought against me to keep me still. \"It's…fuck! I'm sorry, but we can't do anything!\" \"What the fuck?!\" someone suddenly screeched, and I stopped fighting. We all turned to see Paul Rudd running towards the group, clutching a huge bottle of champagne. \"Oh God!\" \"Paul!\" James shouted as the terrified man practically collided with him. \"What's happening?!\" Paul cried. I was about to have a snappy comeback about how it was pretty fucking obvious what was happening when Michael stumbled out of the group and faced us. \"Alright, everybody, listen up! Listen up!\" he yelled. \"Who took my fucking cell phone, man?!\" \"Michael, there are bigger things to worry about here!\" I yelled back, gesturing at the Hills behind him. He ignored me. \"Martin, empty your pockets!\" \"What?\" Martin Starr said, frowning. \"I saw you in the bathroom, man!\" Michael accused, pointing at him. \"Kenzie!\" Now he pointed at me. \"Dial my phone!\" \"Oh, for fuck sake, Michael,\" I snapped, but I pulled my phone out of my bag and dialled his number. It didn't connect. \"I have no fucking signal, jerk-off! Deal with it!\" \"Shut the fuck up!\" he shouted hysterically. \"It's unbelievable! It's unacceptable after all the coke I've wasted on you people!\" Somewhere in the middle of Michael's rant the ground beneath him had started to crack. The crack began to split all the way up the grass behind him, heading in the direction of a streetlamp. \"I didn't take your fucking cell phone!\" Martin insisted, which was when everyone noticed the crack. \"Mike!\" everyone began to shout. \"Mike! Mike! Mike!\" \" Michael !\" I screamed. \"Behind you!\" It was too late. The crack reached the streetlamp and the lamp came crashing down, spearing Michael straight through the chest. Blood spurted out everywhere, hitting Jason Segel in the face and spraying everyone else lightly too. I also got a face full of it, the red coppery liquid filling my open, screaming mouth. I spat it out, terrified and disturbed. \"What's happening to me?!\" Michael howled. \"What's happening?!\" Everyone was screaming as the lamp began hoisting him up into the air, sparks flying everywhere. None of us could help him; he was fucked. We all stared up in horror as Michael reached into his pocket and pulled out his blood-soaked cell. It was now playing his ringtone. I guess I'd found some signal. \"Oh shit, that's embarrassing,\" he sobbed. There was an almighty roaring sound and the earth physically opened up like the mouth of Hell, swallowing up the streetlamp and Michael. The hole got bigger, spreading towards the party. People began falling in like dominos, bringing others down with them. Everyone backed up rapidly, but I watched in terror as Martin, Rihanna, Mindy and Jason were all swallowed up. I was rooted to the spot. People were running around me, and that was when I saw Jay fall too. \"Shit! No! NO!\" I bellowed, making a run for him, but Seth and James each grabbed one of my arms and began to drag me back towards the house. \"No! No! Get off me!\" I howled, trying to wrestle out of their grip. \"Jay! Jay !\" \"Mack, we're not letting you die too!\" Seth said forcefully, he and James still pulling me towards the house but we were struggling against the tide of terrified guests, forcing us to stop. \"Kenzie, stop fighting us! Jesus!\" ordered James, tightening his grip as they tried to wait for a gap to run, but I just writhed around even harder. There was a sudden cracking-squishing noise, and we gaped in disgusted shock as Paul crushed the head of James' assistant under his foot. \"Karen!\" James shrieked whilst Seth just screamed like a girl, and I took the opportunity of them being distracted to tear myself from their grasp and sprint as fast as I could back to the hole. \"Seth, come on!\" I heard James shout. \"Kenzie! Get in the house!\" \"Fuck you!\" I yelled back. \"I'm not leaving without Jay!\" \"Fuck!\" I heard him curse, but neither he nor Seth came back to get me. I reached the hole just as it grew another few feet, and I heard a voice whimpering from within. \"Oh my God, I'm gonna die!\" \"Chris!\" I shouted, and, panicking, I dropped to my knees and looked down into the hole. \"Take my hand!\" I reached down, but it was too late. The dirt shelf Chris had been clinging too broke away from the hole wall, and Chris went tumbling down into what looked like actual lava. The clump of dirt then smacked Martin, who had also been clinging to the inside of the hole, in the face, sending him spiralling down too. \"Shit!\" I sobbed, scrambling back. \"Jay! Jay, please, where are you!\" \"Mack! Mackenzie!\" I heard him yell, so I looked up and saw him the other side of the hole. I carefully made my way around, passing by Kevin and Aziz in time to watch Aziz get his arm cut off and fall, and to see a spasming Kevin go careening down into the hole too. \"Jay! Jay, I'm here!\" I cried, collapsing next to where I could see his hand clinging to the entrance of the hole. I looked down, and thank God, he didn't seem to be hurt. There were only two people left clinging to their life down there; him and David Krumholtz. \"Guys! I'll help you out!\" \"I can't hold on much longer,\" David said weakly. \"Jay, you have to reach out and grab me. You hear?\" \"Okay, you take my hand, and I will swing you up to Mackenzie!\" Jay promised. \"Yeah, and I'll pull you up,\" I swore. \"Are you sure?\" David said. \"I'm gonna give you my whole weight. I'm gonna reach for you, alright?\" Jay nodded. \"Yeah, yeah.\" \"We got this, David! Just hurry!\" I pressed. \"Are you sure you can do that?\" he asked. \"I can grab you on three!\" Jay assured him. \"One, two, three!\" He reached down, and I did too. Jay and David joined hands, and laughed in relief. \"Alright, buddy!\" Jay said. \"Now I'm gonna…\" said David. \"I'm gonna swing up to Mackenzie.\" \"I got you, buddy!\" Jay vowed. \"You're gonna hold my weight! All of it!\" \"Okay, come on!\" \"You can hold on to my full weight?!\" \"I can do it!\" \"I don't want to die!\" \"Then hurry the fuck up!\" I shouted. \"I might fall any second!\" \"One, two, three!\" both men counted, but when David let go, he lost his grip almost instantly and went plummeting down into the lava. \"No! No!\" cried Jay. \"Fuck!\" I shrieked. \"Jay, come on, you gotta take my hand! I can't watch you die too! Please!\" Jay took my hand in one of his, and using our combined strength, him pushing himself up and me pulling as hard as I could, he got out. The force of the pulling/pushing sent both of us falling back on the grass with two separate oof noises. \"We're alive!\" I gasped out, seizing his arms to stop my legs giving way. \"Holy fuck, we're alive,\" he agreed breathlessly, clutching my shoulders. We both turned, and only now did we take in the full scale of the hole that had just swallowed half of Hollywood's celebrities. \"Oh man,\" we both groaned. A/N-So I'm trying this thing where, at the beginning of a chapter you see how one of Mack's characters fits into the films she's been in. Let me know how you like that, because it's the experiment I mentioned earlier. I'd really appreciate the feedback on that! So I hope you liked it, because the end has begun! Leave a review, and I'll update soon! Xx Gee xX PS- Hey, you guys should go check out Starfire Tamaran's fic More Than Distance Between Us if you're a Franco fan! It's so good, and the characterisation is awesome! PPS- Yup, reminder that Mackenzie's actress/model and the Polyvore page are linked on my profile![Chapter 4] A/N- Since I received pretty positive feedback for the 'Mackenzie's character in her movies' thing, I've decided that's how I will start all my chapters from now on. It's pretty fun, deciding what scene to do and smushing the character in. Big ol' thanks to DemmarisAoka and Morgan for reviewing! Chapter Four- The Cameras Are Gone \" Pete, you need to wait for Marnie!\" Debbie shouted at her husband, before yelling up the stairs, \"Marnie! For God's sake, you're gonna be so late!\" \" Get off my dick for once, Debbie!\" Marnie stormed down the stairs, scowling at her older sister. \"Jesus Christ, what is being late gonna do, exactly?\" \" Marnie, you're already failing Math,\" Debbie pointed out as the two of them walked through to the kitchen. \"Being late makes you look worse.\" \" Thanks for that, Deb,\" Marnie said sarcastically, rolling her eyes. \"What else do you wanna remind me of on this lovely sunny Thursday morning? That my Drama teacher says I need acting lessons, despite being a fucking Drama teacher? That I started speaking French in my Spanish test last week?\" \" Drop the attitude, Marnie,\" Debbie said bluntly. \"You know, you're seventeen, not twelve.\" \" Really? OMG,\" she gasped, placing a hand on her heart. \"I thought I was still in middle school. Reality check, much?\" \" God, Marnie, you're a pain in my ass!\" Debbie suddenly exclaimed. \"No wonder Mom sent you to live here!\" \" Fuck you, Debbie.\" Marnie scowled heavily, grabbing her red satchel from one of the island stools. \"I'm going to school, happy now? 'Sup, Pete?\" she added to her brother-in-law, sashaying past him and Charlotte, one of her little nieces, and heading out the door. \" Maybe try actually wearing a skirt tomorrow!\" Debbie yelled after her, but Marnie just threw up her hand and flipped her sister off, then made sure to make her skirt even shorter. \" Always nice to see you two getting along,\" Pete commented, ushering his daughter outside after her aunt and shutting the door. \" She needs to realise she isn't my mom,\" Marnie muttered sulkily. \"She can't tell me what to do.\" \" She might be annoying sometimes,\" he said reasonably, fumbling for his car keys whilst he supported Charlotte against his hip. \"But she wants what's best for you. You know that, Marns.\" \" Yeah, well…\" Marnie became distracted by the sounds of two sets of footsteps walking behind her. She turned and saw her other older sister Alison walking towards them, accompanied by some random curly-haired dude. \"Hey Ali!\" \" Morning,\" Alison said sheepishly as she approached. \" Good morning, Alison,\" Pete replied. Marnie just slyly smiled at them. God, these guys could not have been more obvious if they'd both been wearing neon signs that read ONE NIGHT STAND. \" I'm Ben,\" the curly-haired guy introduced himself. \"What's happening, man?\" He shook hands with Pete, who smiled and simply said, \"Ben.\" \" How's it going?\" Ben asked. \" Ah, to be young,\" Pete sighed reminiscently. \" Stop it!\" Alison requested calmly, awkwardly looking away. \" Hey, Marnie,\" Pete sniggered. \"This is just like that time you tried to sneak Joel Frasier out of your bedroom window last month!\" \" Oh my fucking God, Pete!\" she protested, kicking him in the shin. \"Why would you even bring that up?!\" \" Okay, see you later,\" Alison said abruptly, pulling her sunglasses down over her eyes and beginning to walk away. \" All righty,\" Ben said, holding his arms out in some kind of goodbye gesture and followed Alison. \" See you later,\" Pete called sardonically after them. \"Enjoy the day!\" As soon as they were out of earshot, he turned to Charlotte and said, \"Never do what they did.\" \" I'm gonna do it!\" Charlotte promised with a giggle. \" You are?\" Pete laughed. \"Uh oh! Someone's getting home-schooled!\" \" Hey, if we're going for home-schooling around here then sign me up!\" said Marnie. \"Save me from that shit-tip high school, per-lease!\" \" Language!\" Pete warned mockingly, clipping Charlotte into her car seat. \"There are children present!\" \" I was raised by your wife,\" she pointed out, climbing into the passenger seat. \"Fucking blame her for my shitty attitude to life.\" -Knocked Up, 2007 Very few people can say that they've projectile-vomited on James Franco's front door. I am the girl that can hand-on-heart say that she has. As Jay and I unsteadily made our way up the path that led to James' house, our faces ghostly pale with fear, both of us covered in blood and dirt, I felt that familiar churning feeling in the pit of my stomach. By the time we'd reached the door, I couldn't keep it down anymore. As Jay reached to push the door open, I spewed out an almighty fountain of puke, which splattered all over the door and doorstep, narrowly avoiding Jay's outstretched arm. \"Jesus fuck, Mack!\" Jay groaned, but he wrapped an arm around my waist to support me, and we staggered into the house. \"Holy shit!\" was the first thing we heard; James was freaking out big time. \"Jay! Mack!\" Seth gasped in relief, pulling us both into three-person hug. \"You're alive! Oh, thank God!\" \"We're okay!\" I snivelled into his shoulder, beginning to cry. \"We're not dead yet,\" Jay assured him, way less emotionally than me. Meanwhile, James was in the middle of the biggest bitch-fit I'd ever seen him throw. Ever. \"I told you guys not to go outside! What just happened?!\" He stormed over to me and grabbed hold of my head, making me look at him. \"Jesus Christ, Kenzie! What the fuck was that?! You could have fucking died! Why didn't you fucking listen to me!?\" \"I'm so sorry!\" I sobbed, putting my arms tight around his neck. \"I was scared! I couldn't leave Jay, I wasn't thinking straight!\" James let go of my head and hugged me back closely, leaning his cheek on the top of my head. \"What the fuck would I have told Dave if you'd died?!\" \"Oh my God!\" I whimpered, pulling back from him in shock. \"Dave! I need to call him I need to see if he's alright! Oh my fuck, what did we just see?!\" I pulled my phone out of my pocket ( how had it not been smashed?) and started dialling my boyfriend's number. \"Jesus Christ, they are all fucking dead!\" Craig cried. \"I told you guys not to run outside!\" James yelled. \"I tried to save Aziz!\" Craig was sobbing, clutching at Seth. \"I tried!\" \"You did your best, man!\" wept Seth, hugging him. \"I love you!\" \"Why the fuck did you guys run out there?!\" shrieked James, pacing around the room. \"You know what, James, can you lower your voice?!\" Jonah shouted from the sofas. \"You're freaking out Jay!\" \"Maybe I'm a little freaked out too!\" James shouted back. \"We're all fucking freaked out!\" I wailed, dialling Dave's number for the fourth time; it was just totally refusing to connect. \"He's not as strong as you!\" Jonah responded. \"Look at my house!\" James bawled. \"The house is not the main fucking priority here, Franco!\" I screeched. \"My phone won't connect to a network, I can't call anyone!\" It was bedlam; James was having a fit about his house, I was screaming at my phone for not working, Seth and Craig were still crying and Jay was getting irritated because Jonah kept touching him. \"Can we get Jay some water please?!\" Jonah demanded. \"Can we get him some hydration?! He needs to be hydrated!\" \"The water's not working!\" Seth shouted, frantically twisting the faucet. \"Everyone just runs out the door!\" whined James. \" Franco !\" I snapped, looking away from my phone and scowling at him. \"My phone's dead too!\" stated Craig, panicked. \"Guys, the fucking internet's not working!\" howled Seth, repeatedly clicking at a laptop. \"Let's watch the TV!\" James suggested hurriedly, grabbing the remote. \"Let's check the news!\" \"Where is the TV?\" asked Jay, frowning. We all looked around. He was right; there was no TV to be seen. \"It's in the floor,\" James explained as a whirring noise began to emanate from a spot in the middle of the sofas, and sure enough, the TV began to rise up out of the hardwood flooring. \"That's dope,\" Craig said appreciatively. \"Yeah, cool, huh?\" said James. \"Damn, I knew I should have taken you up on your offer to design our house,\" I muttered thoughtfully. \"That's really neat,\" added Seth. \"That is impressive, James,\" concluded Jonah as the TV finished its grand arrival. \"… the biggest earthquake to ever hit Los Angeles -\" the male news reporter was saying before James flicked the channel over. \"- officers urging people to stay in their homes right now ,\" the new female reporter was saying, as the banner at the bottom of the screen read SEEK SHELTER NOW in red lettering. \" And also reports of looting and rioting are spreading across the city. \" \"Riots?\" James repeated in a whisper as we all stared in alarm at the television. Jonah had his hand covering his mouth, Seth was drinking whiskey clean out the bottle, and I was chewing nervously at the skin around my thumb, ruining my French manicure. \" Police are pretty much outnumbered as people are turning to one another ,\" the TV woman was saying. \" Martial law has now been declared -\" James changed the channel for a second time. \" Air Force One has gone down -\" was all we heard before the screen flickered and broke up, before turning to the static blue NO SIGNAL screen. \"Shit!\" hissed James, clicking the remote at the TV to no avail. \"It's gone guys.\" \"The whole world's gone fucking mental!\" I whispered, twirling a strand of my hair around my finger fearfully. Jay suddenly turned to Seth and me. \"So, I think we should…we should probably go back to your place, huh?\" \"What are you talking about, man?!\" demanded Seth. \"No, no way! I'm not leaving here!\" \"You're bat-shit crazy if you think you're getting me to go back outside that door, Baruchel,\" I snapped, folding my arms. \"I don't…wanna die at James Franco's house,\" Jay said uneasily, and I didn't miss the offended 'what's he talking about' raised-arm gesture James made either. \"You heard the TV!\" exclaimed Seth, gesturing at the blank screen. \"The TV said stay here! It said stay in your homes! We need to stay here until they start rescuing people, okay?!\" \"A huge earthquake happens, who do they rescue first?\" Jonah asked in what I assumed he imagined was an intelligent tone. \"Actors!\" \"Famous people!\" agreed Seth. \"They'll get Clooney, Sandra Bullock, me!\" Jonah paused for a millisecond. \"If there's room, you guys'll come! The point is that we're all gonna get out of this first!\" A huge explosion outside suddenly rocked the entire house, making the walls and ground shake and causing us all to start. \"What the fuck was that?!\" I yelled, jumping backwards and almost crushing Jay in the process. \"It's already going crazy out there, guys!\" Seth yelped. \"We can't leave! I'm not leaving, okay?! I'm a victim! I've had a victim's mentality my whole life! People can smell it on me! When I was a kid, I had man-titties! The bullies held me down, they titty-fucked me!\" \"Woah, Seth!\" I grimaced, putting a hand on his chest to shut him up. \"Little too much information there, bro!\" \"That's what's happening out there right now!\" James shouted fearfully. \"James!\" I shouted back. \"You are not helping!\" \"That's right, we are all soft!\" Now Craig was freaking out even more too. \"We are all soft! We are actors! We pretend to be hard, man!\" \"Yeah!\" James agreed. \"We soft as baby shit!\" shouted Craig, moving towards the wall. \"As baby shit!\" James shrieked. \"Soft as…wait, Craig, what are you doing, man?!\" Craig had grabbed hold of one of James' stupid paintings and was attempting to tear it down from the wall. \"Hey, hey, what are you doing?! What are you doing to the painting, man?!\" \"We gotta board this shit up, man!\" Craig instructed, a pretty clever idea really. Just not according to James. \"Board it up?!\" \"We gotta protect ourselves!\" Craig told him. \"We don't know we gonna be in here!\" \"Guys, come on, let's sit down and talk about what we need to do!\" I suggested. \"Let's do that, that is a good idea!\" They both ignored me. \"There's raccoons and bandits and shit out there!\" Craig exclaimed, clearly terrified out of his wits. \"This is Obey , man!\" James cried like we knew what he meant, stepping protectively in front of the painting. \"This is my favourite fucking painting!\" Craig ignored him, reaching up and trying to pull the stupid picture down. \"What are you doing, Craig!? Guys, help!\" he pleaded, turning to us. \"Help! Help! Get off!\" \"BOYS! QUIT IT!\" I screamed, snapping suddenly, when we all heard the sound of a helicopter approaching outside. James and Craig stopped wrestling with each other, and James pointed to the window where the helicopter lights were shining through. \"Look! Helicopter! Helicopter!\" He took a few steps closer to the window, still gesturing at the light. \"The good guys are here! We're fine! It's gonna be fine!\" The whirring of the helicopter was growing steadily closer, and that was when we realised that it wasn't landing; it was crashing. This was confirmed when we saw a chopper spinning rapidly out of control speeding towards the window. It collided with the ground with an explosion just outside the window, and the tail of the chopper came flying through the glass, imbedding itself in the painting James had so desperately been protecting just seconds earlier. Craig started screaming in pain, clutching at his hand, and for a second I thought for sure that the piece of helicopter had chopped one of his fingers off. \"God damn! God damn ! Shit!\" \"You okay?!\" James asked, taking a few hesitant steps towards him. \"No, I'm not okay!\" Craig spat. \"Fuck your house, Franco!\" He held up his finger, revealing the drop of blood oozing out of a paper cut-sized slice. Are you actually fucking kidding me right now. \"My house didn't do that!\" James protested angrily, and he reached out to touch the piece of chopper. The second his skin came into contact with the metal, there was a sizzle of burning flesh, and James withdrew his hand with a pained hiss. \"On what planet did you deem that a good idea?\" I asked him sarcastically, raising an eyebrow, and he just flipped me off. \"Well that was rude. Okay. We all just need to calm the fuck down, okay? Let's just do some of this logical thinking people are so fond of. Craig's right; we gotta board this place up and stop people getting in and fucking slitting our throats in our sleep. Yes, Franco,\" I snapped, seeing the objection on James' face. \"That does mean tearing down your precious art. Deal with it. Come on!\" I clapped my hands impatiently at them. \"Let's rock and roll, you bunch of bitches!\" And rock and roll we did. The boys got set to tearing down all of James' pictures, portraits, canvasses and whatever else they could find and nailed them over all the exterior windows and doors. Seth attempted to duct tape the cracks in the walls together. Craig built himself a little one-man tent out of a chair, a couple of blanket and the dick statue. I gathered together every last bit of drink, food, drugs and other miscellaneous items I could find and set them down on the kitchen island for Seth to catalogue. \"Okay, we got twelve bottles of water, fifty-six beers, two vodkas, four whiskeys, six bottles of wine, the three cans of Arizona ice tea that Mack stole from the convenience store, tequila, Nutella, cheese, pizza, eggs, bananas, apples, bacon, steaks, pancake mix, CT Crunch, milk, ketchup, a Milky way, half ounce Sour Diesel, three and a half grams Grand Master Kush, one ounce of shrooms, fifteen pills of ecstasy, a porno mag, a baseball bat and the video camera from the movie 27 Hours ,\" he listed, checking them off on his checklist. \" 127 Hours ,\" James corrected him, and Seth quickly wrote that extra hundred hours down, because it was just sooo important at this stage of our lives. \"And a functioning revolver from the movie Flyboys ,\" Seth finished off. \"Old Faithful,\" James said fondly, picking the gun up. \"Jesus!\" Jay exclaimed, dropping to the floor. \"This thing's real,\" James explained, displaying it to us all. \"I kept it from the movie. This is an actual revolver.\" \"We can see that,\" I said uneasily, as Jay slowly stood back up next to me. God, I now wished I'd put him between me and James. \"Franco, that's very uncomfortable!\" Craig said nervously, holding up his hands. \"Could you put that down please?\" \"Loaded!\" James decided to show us all that there actually were bullets in the chambers. Fan-fucking-tastic. I gave it five minutes before he accidentally shot one of us. All of us were protesting about him holding it, but him being James Franco, he totally ignored us. \"I always keep my props!\" he enlightened us. \"Always keep my props.\" He twirled the gun round in Jay's and my direction, and Jay ducked down again, out of range, whilst I took a step back into the worktop. \"I know how to handle it!\" James insisted. \"He knows what he's doing,\" Jonah said with a laugh. \"I like this bit, I like it. I get it. Let me see!\" \"It's real, it's heavy,\" James warned him. \"Let me see it like that,\" Jonah maintained, so James through the revolver to him, causing the rest of us to shout out in irritation and objection. \"Come on, guys!\" protested Seth. \"You could kill-\" but he was cut off by Jonah pointing the gun at us each in turn and pretending to shoot it. \"Bang, bang!\" he said in the campest tone I'd ever heard come out of a man's mouth. \"Please put it down!\" begged Seth, whilst this time I followed Jay's suit and ducked behind the island. \"Bang, bang, bang! You're dead!\" Jonah continued, and now the other guys were beginning to duck down too. \"Pow, pow, pow!\" \"I hope you're fucking happy,\" Jay snapped at James, who raised his arms in a 'whatever' gesture. \"Stop! Guys!\" shouted Seth. \"Stop fucking with the gun!\" \"Pow, pow!\" Jonah carried on his little game. \"It's so funny,\" Craig said derisively, his hands clasped together, praying-style. \"It's so funny.\" \"Jonah!\" I hissed. \"Put the gun the fuck down!\" \"We're getting sidetracked!\" Jay exclaimed in an attempt to bring us back to the problem at hand. \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry,\" Jonah said sorrowfully, and he placed the gun next to his temple. \"I'll just kill myself.\" At this, we all yelled out a chorus of, \"NO!\" \"Jonah, what the fuck are you doing?!\" I shrieked. \"Put it down! Put it down now !\" \"Jonah, give it back!\" James ordered, holding out his hand for it. Meanwhile, Jonah was acting out an OTT mental breakdown that consisted of wailing and flailing around, ending with him actually placing the gun in his mouth to yet more yells of 'no.' \"Come on, no, no!\" commanded Jay. \"Don't! Jesus!\" \"Would you put the thing down?!\" Seth said exasperatedly. This was just getting boring now. Jonah stopped his wailing abruptly. \"I'm trying to have some fun, man.\" He handed the revolver back to James without a fight. \"Fun?!\" I exploded. \"There is nothing 'fun' about this situation, Jonah! People are dead! Jay and I nearly died! Hello?!\" \"Look, just because a bunch of people fell into a hole outside doesn't mean we can't have some fun!\" he said in an attempt at comforting me. It failed, FYI. \"We're a bunch of best friend's hanging out. It's like a sleepover!\" \"A sleepover surrounded by fire, death and destruction,\" I muttered, folding my arms. \"Okay, food,\" Seth said loudly, trying to regain control. \"How are we gonna deal with this?\" \"Um, can I have that Milky Way?\" asked Jonah, pointing at the chocolate bar. \"No, you can't have the Milky Way!\" retorted James. \"That's my Milky Way!\" \"What?!\" Jay exclaimed disbelievingly, having been cut off from saying how there were a lot of us that probably wanted the Milky Way. \"I went out this morning, specifically bought this Milky Way to eat after my party,\" James insisted. \"That's weird,\" said Jay, his eyebrows knitted together. \"It is a little weird,\" I agreed. \"It's not weird, it's my special food!\" James argued. \"Who the fuck has special food at the age of thirty-five!?\" I exclaimed. \"Jesus, man.\" \"I like it. Back me up on that, Seth!\" James looked at Seth for support. Seth totally shot him down. \"I don't think you should get the whole Milky Way. I want some of the Milky Way!\" \"I'd be pretty bummed if I don't at least get a bite of the Milky Way,\" Craig chipped in. \"Oh, now Craig wants the Milky Way!\" said James. \"Yeah, I want a bite of the Milky Way!\" Craig retorted. \"It's a fucking Milky Way!\" \"I'm the female here,\" I reminded everyone. \"It's ladies first. I want the Milky Way, I get the Milky Way.\" \"A fifth of everything is what's fair and reasonable,\" Jay suggested. \"Everyone gets a fifth of everything,\" Seth asserted. \"I want one-fifth of your t-shirt!\" James announced aggressively, pointing at Craig's TAKE YO' PANTIES OFF shirt. \"I want the bottom part! The belly!\" \"I'm not sporting a crop top in your house!\" Craig objected. \"I'll cut that shit off and make a headband!\" James said. \"You couldn't handle my midriff,\" Craig replied rationally. \"Guys, the only issue is,\" Jonah interjected. \"I kind of need the Milky Way.\" \"Oh, for fuck sake,\" sighed Jay, putting his head in his hand. \"No, for real, I have low blood sugar and if my endorphins drop too low I'm gonna be a nightmare to be around.\" \"If your LBS acts up, you can have a finger scoop of Nutella,\" said James, opening the jar and holding it out to him. Urgh. Fucking Nutella. I would never eat that shit again for the rest of my life, that was for sure. \"Fair,\" Jonah said with a raise of his hand. Then I saw a wicked gleam in his eye. \" But, can I eat it off Mackenzie? I hear she is pretty good for that kinda thing.\" A mocking smirk spread across his lips. \"That is so not funny, asswipe,\" I returned with a scowl. \"Oh really? Because I think it's hilarious.\" James grinned maliciously. He scooped out a small dollop of Nutella and massaged it into the back of his hand. \"Oh hey Jonah, how about a snack? I know you get awful hungry,\" he jibed in what was quite possibly the worst imitation of my voice known to this planet. Jonah was quick to join in with James' mocking. \"Oh, Kenzie, I sure would!\" The pair continued their, unfortunately, rather accurate imitation of what happened that night for what felt like a lifetime, adding various sound effects and actions which I was sure (or more, hoped) did not actually occur on the evening. \"Oh Jonah, your tongue is so big and wet! I can't believe I picked Dave when I could have had you, you hunky boy!\" James twittered, his pitch an octave too high. By this point, I'd heard more than enough. I picked up the bacon and launched it at James' head. However, I missed spectacularly as it glided past him and fell to the floor with a dull thwuck . \"Fuck you, Franco,\" I snapped. \"You're just jealous your baby brother gets more sex than you do.\" The other guys all started laughing. \"Anyway, that was one time, and if I recall correctly, I was drunk out of my face and totally high! I cannot be held responsible for that! And stop wasting the fucking food, jackass!\" \"Ooooh, damn!\" drew out Craig, and I shot him the finger. \"Shut up, Craig!\" \"I'm going to bed,\" James proclaimed, grabbing the revolver. \"Don't touch that Milky Way, Jonah!\" he warned as he walked away. \"Hey yo, Franco!\" I shouted, running after him in my stupid high heels. \"Wait up!\" \"What's up, sis?\" he said when I reached him. \"You got a blanket or anything I can borrow?\" I asked as we made our way up the stairs. \"Jay and me are sleeping on the sofa and he's got like a rug and shit. I'll freeze!\" \"I've got some spare blankets in my bedroom,\" he said. \"Come on, I'll get you one.\" \"Thanks, dickbrain,\" I said with a laugh, and he grinned at me. Just like the rest of the house, James' bedroom was typically artsy, with more canvasses on the wall and all exposed wood-and-stone walls with a big-ass double bed in the middle of the room. \"Here,\" he said, opening his closet and grabbing a plain duvet from the top shelf, throwing it to me. \"Awesome, at least now the end of the world won't kill me by me freezing to death,\" I joked. \"Do you want to borrow a t-shirt or something to sleep in?\" he asked, and I nodded, so he also handed me just a basic black t-shirt. \"Do you think the rest of the world is just like this?\" I asked quietly, sitting down at the end of his bed. \"God, I don't know, Kenz,\" he sighed, sitting down next to me. \"I am so scared,\" I whispered. \"There's no phone service, no internet! What about Dave!? He's my boyfriend, your brother…he could be dead for all we know! I have no way of contacting him, of phoning my dad back home…it's all just totally gone to shit and I don't know what to do!\" My face crumpled and I began to cry, not attractively either. I was exhausted and terrified and distressed and angry…I was a mess. \"Hey, hey, hey,\" James soothed, putting his arm around me. \"I'm sure there's a simple explanation for all this. It was just an earthquake! We'll all get out of this alive, I promise!\" \"But what about the blue lights?! Jay said-\" \"Fuck what Jay said,\" he said dismissively, rolling his eyes. \"That's bullshit. Earthquakes happen all the time, and people live. So chill out, get some sleep and we'll work out what to do tomorrow. Okay? It's fine .\" I nodded slowly. \"Okay.\" I reached over and gave him a hug before retreating into the bathroom across the hall to change. I gratefully kicked my heels off my sore feet and stripped out of my leather jacket, shorts, pantyhose and cami, leaving me in my Victoria's Secret turquoise bra and pink spotty girl boxers. Thank God I hadn't worn a thong. Though I loved the guys and was so close to them all, there was no way I wanted them to see me totally in my underwear. I pulled James' t-shirt down over my head, and was thankful to see that it reached mid-thigh. Just an earthquake, James had said. We'd be fine. We'd get out of this alive, he'd said. But as I made my way back downstairs and saw the fire flickering away outside through the gaps in the boarded-up windows, I began to wonder if this was something a whole lot more devastating than just an earthquake… A/N- Shit's getting real. I'll clarify now, this is not a romance fic, so James and Mack will not be getting together. I want them to have a sibling-esque relationship, because Mack always lacked that big brother figure in her life until she met James. So lemme know how you're likin' everything, updates will come quicker if I start getting more reviews and follows! Kisses to you all! Xx Gee xX PS- Polyvore. You know what to do.[Chapter 5] A/N- I feel like I shouldn't be cranking out a new chapter after just like three or four days, but what the hey, here ya go! Super thanks to Ronnie. H for reviewing! Chapter Five- Throwing A Fit, Making A Scene \" Am I teenager-y enough?\" Kira asked, panicking as she saw the high school gates drawing closer. \"I do not feel teenager-y enough! I look old! I can tell! They'll see that I'm twenty-five! Oh my God! We are D-O-N-E, fucked!\" \" Kira, just calm the fuck down,\" Jenko said calmly. \"We've done this shit once, we'll be just as fucking awesome this time.\" \" It's okay for you guys,\" Schmidt muttered, looking gloomily out the window. \"You were popular and shit in high school.\" \" Schmidty, we were still best friends in high school despite your status as a dweeb,\" Kira reminded him. \"Trust me, anyone tries that shit with you again and, in the words of our darling Jenko, I will seriously beat their dick off with both hands.\" \" Hey,\" Jenko practically sang. \"We're here.\" \" Park in that handicapped spot!\" Schmidt suggested as they drove into the student parking lot. \"It'll make us look cool.\" \" That's awesome!\" Jenko enthused. \" No, it'll make us look like jackasses,\" Kira said, but like with 75% of the words that came out of her mouth, the boys ignored her and parked up. They exited the car, with Jenko pulling his seat forward to let Kira squeeze out through the cap, and stood without trying to draw too much attention to themselves. That was, until Schmidt started freaking out because everyone around them was two-strapping their backpacks, whilst the three of them were one-strapping on Jenko's instruction. \" Dudes? Everyone's two-strapping it!\" he exclaimed worriedly. \" Just stay with the one-strap!\" Jenko muttered. \" I can't! I can't!\" Schmidt replied, hurriedly pulling the other strap over his shoulder. \"I can't right now!\" \" Schmidt!\" Kira hissed. \"Stop! You freaking out is making us even more noticeable!\" \" Don't succumb to the peer pressure!\" Jenko said incredulously. \"What are you doing?!\" \" You're supposed to use two straps! One strap is peer pressure!\" retorted Schmidt. \" We're not telling you to take drugs!\" exploded Kira. \"Take the fucking strap down! Now!\" \" No!\" Schmidt clamped the strap to his shoulder with his hand. \" No! No, you're fucking up right now!\" Jenko whispered irately, looking around at all the different students. \"Okay, those are Goths. Those are nerds.\" Kira did the same. \"Those are cheerleaders.\" Jenko caught sight of a group of students in 1950s-style clothing. \"I don't know what they are.\" \" Rockabilly,\" Kira mumbled to him, but all she got was a blank stare. \" What the fuck are those things?!\" Schmidt exclaimed, puzzled, staring at some girls dressed in colourful Japanese-type clothes. \" I…have no idea,\" admitted Kira. \" I am so confused right now,\" said Jenko. What he failed to notice, that Kira did, was Schmidt staring at a blonde girl who had just pulled up on her bike. She was very pretty in a non-conventional, artsy way, but Kira was way, way more interested in the guy that the girl had come to a stop in front of. He was gorgeous; athletic build, wavy brown hair, model-esque facial features, chiselled jaw line, grey shirt that fit him perfectly. In short, he was Kira's ideal guy, appearance-wise. Fuck, it was like someone had built him in a lab for her. \" Woah,\" she and Schmidt breathed out in unison, but they both lost the dreamy looks on their faces when they saw the girl and the boy kiss; they were together. \" Hey, yo,\" the boy suddenly called, walking up to Jenko, Schmidt and Kira, causing them to stop. \"Hey. Is that your car?\" He jerked his head in the direction of the vehicle Hoffs at the station had loaned them. \" Yeah,\" Jenko said proudly; he loved his cars. \" What's that thing get, ten miles to the gallon?\" the boy asked. \" No, try like, seven,\" Jenko replied casually. \"What about you?\" he asked a different boy who was standing by his own car. \" Biodiesel, dawg,\" the other boy answered. \" Oh God, it's the hippy squad,\" Kira muttered in Schmidt's ear, and he had to turn his laugh into a hacking cough. \" Smells like egg rolls,\" he managed to cough out. \" Yeah it does,\" the hot guy said smugly. \"Runs on leftover fry oil from Hunan Palace. But we try to ride bikes when we can, global crisis and whatnot.\" \" Are you serious?\" snorted Kira, unable to control herself. \" Whatever man,\" Jenko said offhandedly. \"I don't care about anything.\" \" You don't care about the environment?\" the boy demanded, looking between Jenko and Kira. \"That's kinda fucked up, man.\" \" Caring about and being interested in are two very, very different things,\" Kira replied, and the boy scowled at her. She grinned cockily back and blew a kiss at him. \" Hey, hey,\" another boy piped up from his position leaning on the car roof. \"Will y'all shut the hell up? Trying to study.\" \" Look at him!\" laughed Jenko, pointing. \"He's trying. He's actually trying! What a nerd!\" The boy put his book down and moved in front of Jenko, who was taunting, \"Look at him. Look at the nerd!\" \" Who you calling a nerd, man?\" the boy challenged. \" Oh I'm sorry, what?\" Jenko asked ignorantly, before he punched the boy clean in the face, flooring him. \" Jenk-\" Kira had to cut herself off before she blew their cover. \"What the fuck man?!\" \" Shit, dude!\" exclaimed Schmidt. \" Hey, what the hell, are you serious?!\" the hot boy cried, helping his friend. \" Turn that gay-ass music off,\" Jenko said condescendingly, looking at their car. \" You punched me because I'm gay?!\" the punched boy demanded. \" What?!\" Jenko clearly had not been expecting that. None of them had. \" You've gotta be fucking kidding me,\" Kira sighed, putting her head in her hands. \" No, I- oh come on!\" he said to the crowd that had gathered around them. \" That's not cool, man,\" Schmidt said quietly. \" That is really insensitive,\" added the hot boy. \" I didn't punch him because he's gay!\" insisted Jenko. \"I punched him, and then he happened to turn out to be gay afterwards!\" \" I was gay when you punched me!\" the other boy spat. \" In a weird way,\" said Schmidt in an attempt at peacemaking. \"It might have been homophobic not to punch you just because you were gay.\" The three of them still ended up in the principal's office, a whole fifteen minutes into the school day. \" You punched a little gay black kid in the face, and it's not even second period. How do you explain that?\" the principal questioned them. \" Mr Dadier, I'm so sorry about that,\" apologised Jenko. \"I just-\" \" Look guys, I'm going to relate to you, okay?\" Mr Dadier said. \"A kid died the other day, and nobody, including me, is doing anything about it. That's weird, guys. And then you three show up, with thirty days left, causing trouble in my school. I am one more gay black kid getting punched in the face away from a nervous breakdown! Do I make myself clear? You three cross my line again, and you walk into this office, I'm gonna expel you. You got me?\" All three of them nodded quickly. \" Mr Dadier, really, we are honestly sorry,\" Kira said sincerely, flashing her best 'you can trust me' smile. It half-worked, because Dadier half-smiled back. \" Alright, let's do this,\" he said, pulling three files out of his desk. \"You must be Daisy.\" Kira nodded; Daisy McQuaid was her alter-ego for the assignment. \"Here. Yeah, you strike me as the Home Ec, cheerleader type.\" She took her file silently. \" Which one of you is Doug?\" Dadier asked the guys. Neither of them moved. \"Let's do that again, and pretend you guys aren't weird. Which one of you is named Doug?\" Both Kira and Schmidt looked at Jenko. \" No, dudes, I'm Brad,\" he muttered back, but Dadier heard him. \" Okay good,\" he said. \"That means your name is Doug, son,\" he said to Schmidt, handing him a file. \"So you're the twins?\" he directed at Schmidt and Kira. \" Yeah, I'm Doug,\" Schmidt sighed. \" I'm sorry about my brothers,\" Kira quickly apologised. \"Both of them had lead paint on their crib bars, and well, teething and all that.\" -21 Jump Street, 2012 I had no idea why I was even attempting to try to sleep. I was so scared and restless that all I could do was lie there on James' sofa, swaddled up in my blanket with my head resting on my folded-up leather jacket. I tossed and turned and sighed, but sleep was just evading me. Of course, it didn't help that outside all I could hear was explosions and gunfire and screaming. I was shaking so much, despite the heat the blanket was providing for me. I just felt sick. \"Jay?\" I whispered. \"Jay, are you awake?\" There was silence for a few moments; moments in which I was sure Jay had actually managed to fall asleep, so I was getting ready to roll over and try once again to snooze when he spoke. \"Yeah Mackenzie, I'm awake.\" He was brusque, just like he had been for the last two hours, since we'd finished cataloguing all the food. He was pissed with Seth and me for not backing him up, I could tell. \"You don't have to be so blunt with me, you know,\" I said, rubbing my eyes and yawning. \"I'm not being blunt.\" \"Yes, you are. You called me Mackenzie. You only ever call me Mackenzie if you're pissed off, upset or we haven't seen each other for a while, like at the airport. So what's up?\" \"Oh, you know, it's the end of the world and here I am, trapped in James Franco's house with a bunch of people who really mean nothing to me.\" Jay sounded so cold. Wow. Now that stung. \"Thanks for that,\" I muttered, pulling the blanket up closer around my neck as I had suddenly gotten very cold. \"Kenz, don't be stupid,\" he said quickly, and the warmth had returned to his voice. \"You know I don't mean you. I just mean that-\" Jay's words were effectively cut off by more explosions outside. I could hear him shifting around uncomfortably as the first, then the second went boom. I clutched my blanket tighter, my knuckles feeling like they were about to break. That was when we heard the footsteps coming slowly towards us. They were slow, plodding, like a bear, and for a second I thought one had broken into the house, especially when I saw a big black shadow moving towards us. Jay raised himself up on his forearms whilst I curled up in the foetal position, whimpering, only to see Seth walk into the light, wrapped in a blanket. \"Hey,\" he said indifferently. \"Hey,\" replied Jay, and I could tell from his voice he was frowning. \"'Sup,\" I said, drawing the 'u' sound out. \"I'm gonna sleep with you guys,\" Seth announced. \"What?\" said Jay. \"I'm gonna sleep with you,\" Seth repeated, and he settled himself in next to Jay in the open spot between the sofas on the floor. \"It's too scary to sleep alone.\" \"But this is my little area,\" Jay protested. \"Well, I'm invading your little area. Besides, Mack's here too,\" Seth pointed out, and I waggled my fingers in a wave. \"She's in her couch area,\" Jay whined. \"This is my spot.\" \"Okay, Sheldon Cooper,\" I teased. \"Chill out. Three's company, I say.\" \"Are you mad at us, man?\" Seth suddenly asked him. Good, so it wasn't just me picking up on Jay's irritated vibes then. \"If I was pissed at you guys, I'm sure it would have something to do with the fact that I had no interest in coming to this house socially, and now I am barricaded in here with a bunch of people that I really hate,\" Jay replied petulantly, which was pretty much what he'd told me too. \"Maybe this was meant to be,\" said Seth. \"Maybe this horrible, horrible, deadly earthquake happened so we could become closer as a group of friends.\" \"This is nature's way of telling you to get that stick out of your ass and accept everyone,\" I added. \"I don't need a group,\" Jay insisted. \"I'm like DMX, man. I'm a lone wolf.\" \"One man wolf pack,\" I snorted, quoting The Hangover . \"DMX isn't a lone wolf,\" Seth told him. \"DMX has the Ruff Ryder crew. You can't stop, drop and open up shop alone! You need people to help you in an earthquake disastery situation.\" \"It was something else!\" Oh God, not this again. \"It was Judgement Day.\" \"I had no idea you were a Bible kinda guy, Jay,\" I said thoughtfully. \"Like Terminator 2 ?\" asked Seth. \"No, not like Terminator 2 !\" sighed Jay, facepalming. \"For God's sakes.\" \"Like Skynet? You think this is Skynet? Like Skynet went live?\" \"No! Will you please stop saying 'Skynet'?\" \"Well you're the one that said Judgement Day!\" \"The biblical Judgement Day!\" Jay explained, and Seth scoffed. \"What?\" \"That's just crazy!\" Seth said superficially. \"You fucking heathen.\" Okay, apparently he'd offended Jay even more. \"Okay, here's the thing,\" said Seth. \"Let's sat for a second there was blue light sucking people up into the sky. That means that we were not awesome enough to go to Heaven.\" \"You're basically saying God hates us,\" I chipped in. A sudden set banging footsteps accompanied by a large shadow coming down the stairs caused all of us to jump wildly, making me to scramble into a sitting position in my panic while Seth and Jay cuddled up to each other in panic. \" Craig ?!\" I spat as the one and only Mr Robinson stepped into the light. \"Goddamn you, man!\" \"What y'all doing?\" he whispered. \"Fuck you, Craig!\" Seth hissed as he and Jay released each other. \"I'm scared. It's scary by myself,\" Craig mumbled. \"Come join the love-in, then,\" I invited, opening my arms in a greeting gesture. \"Yeah, it's way better with more people,\" added Seth. \"I'mma come down here,\" Craig said, and he scooched himself down on the other length of the sofa so his head was positioned next to my head. \"So you're gonna-\" began Jay. \"Right here,\" Craig finished for him, snuggling up with his personalised towel. \"I feel better, actually,\" said Seth. \"I like that. It's better with more people.\" \"Hey guys.\" Jonah's voice suddenly floated out of the darkness behind us. The boys all started for a third time, and this time I let out an actual shriek of fear. \"Jesus Christ!\" said Jay, at the same time Seth yelped, \"Jesus!\" \"For fuck sake, Jonah!\" I grumbled, scowling at him. \"Sorry,\" he apologised. \"Franco has this crazy open floor plan. I can hear every word you guys are saying. I might as well hang with you guys if that's cool.\" He proceeded to awkwardly step over me on his way to squish in between Seth and Jay on the floor. \"It's cool if we can all now focus on going the fuck to sleep ,\" I suggested irately. \"It feels so much more safe now, guys,\" Seth said contently. \"It's nice here,\" agreed Jonah as he shuffled around, trying to get comfortable. \"Should we spoon it?\" he suggested to Seth. \"Yeah, you want to?\" answered Seth, so he, Jonah and Jay spent the next minute or so arguing about if they should go dick-to-butt, tip-to-tip or just plain dicks-up, with Jonah eventually deciding they'd go ' Scarface -style' with him placing his arms around Jay and Seth. \"Goodnight boys,\" he said, kissing Jay and Seth on the forehead. I cleared my throat significantly. \"And Kenzie.\" \"Sweet dreams, fellas,\" Craig said, closing his eyes. \"Nighty night, fuckers,\" I yawned, and a few minutes later I was totally out cold. The red of the inside of my eyelids tricked me into thinking the sun was up the next morning. When my eyes fluttered open, though, I saw it was mostly just the fires outside the boards. I was lying on my side, facing the wall by the stairs. I lie there for a moment, seeing the odd positions the boys and I had shuffled into overnight. Craig had his hand planted on Jay's face, Seth, Jay and Jonah were all cuddled up together and my hand was curled in a fist over Seth's eye. Jesus, had I punched him?! I was all set to go back to sleep when I realised something. I could smell…was that… bacon ? I sat up, rubbing at my heavy eyes when I heard clattering steps coming slowly down the stairs. It was James, dressed in a white vest, shorts and flip-flops, brushing his teeth. He looked totally stunned at something. \"Mornin' James,\" I yawned, stretching my arms above my head. Then I heard movement behind me. \"Franco! Bolton!\" The voice of Danny McBride filtered into my still somewhat hazy subconscious, and I turned my head so suddenly I felt my neck crack. \"Good morning, sunshines!\" Danny was sitting at James' table, surrounded by loads of the food we'd scavenged last night! \"Danny, no!\" I howled, jumping up and leaping over the back of the sofa. \"Guys, guys, wake up! Danny's alive!\" James yelled at the others, causing them to awaken. \"He's eating all the fucking food!\" James and I ran over to the table with the guys stumbling after us, every single one of us screaming at Danny to stop eating…except for Jonah, who excitedly said, \"Danny!\" \"No, it's cool man,\" Danny said good-naturedly. \"I fucking made this for you guys!\" \"Stop eating!\" shouted Seth. \"Don't eat another piece of bacon!\" begged Jay. \"Guys, just chill the fuck out, okay?\" Wow, Danny really had to be the most ignorant person in the entire world. \"I'm sure the Green Goblin can fucking afford some more bacon.\" I couldn't help it; I snorted out a laugh in the most unattractive way ever. We all gave James shit for being in the original Spider-Man trilogy. It wasn't that he'd been bad in them, it was just…well, the third one…need I say more? \"Dude, that shit's supposed to last us till we get rescued!\" shouted Craig. \"Wait a second,\" said Danny, still fucking eating. \"I know what happened. You guys dropped acid, didn't you?\" He looked around at the six of us. \"Mhm. Craig doesn't have any pants on, he got fucking wild. Probably danced, sweated all over the place. You've got white shit all over your mouth, Franco, you probably sucked someone's dick. Jonah over here probably watched and jerked off. Kenzie's half-naked so she probably decided to treat you all to an encore to her famous striptease whilst she painted herself in Nutella. Jay, I didn't even know you were in town. Good to see you.\" \"Danny! We're not on acid! We didn't suck each other's dicks!\" Seth said, annoyed. \"James Franco didn't suck any dick last night?\" Danny mocked. \"Now I know y'all are trippin'.\" \"Do you actually not know what happened last night?!\" Seth asked incredulously. \"Daniel, you may want to stay seated for a second,\" Jonah said gravely. \"Some really messed up stuff happened, and there were a lot of fatalities.\" \"Oh really?\" Danny sneered. \"You're putting your 'serious' voice on, Jonah? Okay, tell me about these 'fatalities'.\" \"Dude, Segel's dead, Krumholtz is dead, Michael Cera's dead,\" Craig told him. \"So Michael Cera's dead, that's not a total loss, huh?\" Danny began laughing. \"Michael Cera's dead!\" \"Fucking hell, Danny!\" I yelled. \"This ain't funny! Like, at all, you shit-turtle!\" The other guys all made varying statements of agreement. \"Seth, that's a better performance than performance than you've given in your last six movies,\" said Danny. \"Where the fuck was that in Green Hornet , huh? Kenzie, you're letting some of that shitty New York accent slip out of your sexy little mouth, best keep that under wraps if you wanna keep convincing people you're a pure LA bitch. Jonah, you're fucking sucking balls. You're an Academy Award nominated person. You need to be fucking selling that shit, dude. Fatalities ,\" he stressed in imitation. \" There were some fatalities. \" \"Fatalities,\" Jonah repeated. \"Okay, now that was good,\" Danny approved. \"That was good.\" \"Does it seem like we're fucking joking?!\" burst out Seth. Danny just looked bored and stuffed another bit of bacon in his mouth. \"Hey, hey, hey! What the fuck you eating, man?!\" we all shouted. \"Spit it out your mouth!\" ordered Craig, grabbing Danny's cheeks. \"Give me the bacon!\" Danny obnoxiously did just that, spraying a shower of mushed-up meat all over the table. And us. \"Danny, I swear to fucking Korean Jesus, if you put another bit of bacon in your mouth, I will rip your fucking tongue out with my bare hands,\" I savagely warned him. \"Stop all that dirty talk, Kenz,\" he taunted. \"We're in public.\" I was about to launch into a furious outburst when a loud bang caused all of us to swing round and divert our attention to the front door. The banging continued, steadily getting more and more frantic, and I didn't fail to notice James pushing me more behind him as he pointed his gun at the door. He really was my big brother. \"Shit, what do we do?!\" hissed Seth. \"Shoot 'em, shoot 'em, shoot 'em!\" squawked Craig. The banging kept going, which turned into tearing as something began ripping down the boards. \"Franco, shoot!\" I squeaked. \"Shoot it! SHOOT IT!\" \"Shoot the door, Franco!\" exclaimed Seth, just as a middle-aged, balding man stuck his head through the gap in the boards. \"Oh God!\" the man gasped. \"Did you not hear me knocking out here?! I've been knocking forever! Please! Please, you gotta let me in!\" \"Hang on a second,\" James said cautiously, turning to the rest of us. \"Guys. I know it sounds really weird, but I don't think we should let him in.\" \"Why not!?\" asked Jay, sounding appalled. \"Yeah, why not?!\" demanded the man. \"I can hear you, by the way.\" \"I'm sorry, we just don't know you, man,\" James told him. \"You could be like, a looter or a rapist or a titty-fucker. Like, I'm sorry.\" I saw Seth grab at his man-boobs when James said about titty-fucking. \"Look, guys, we just boarded up this whole house to keep everyone out,\" James continued. \"And the first guy comes to the door, we're gonna let him in? I mean, how do we know we can trust this guy?\" \"He has a point, dudes,\" I admitted, frowning. \"I want to live!\" the man shouted. \"Things have gone crazy out here!\" \" Things are fucking crazy out here !\" imitated Danny. \"This guy fucking sucks!\" \"What if he's a rapist?!\" said James \"Man, even if he is a rapist, he can't rape all of us,\" Jonah said. \"If anyone, he'll go for Kenzie. She's got the only vagina.\" \"Thank you for that, Jonah,\" I said, rolling my eyes. \"I'm not -I'm not a rapist!\" the man insisted. \"You want to titty-fuck us!?\" demanded Seth, still clutching his chest. \"If you want me to titty-fuck you, I will! So good, you'll love it!\" the man yelled hysterically. \"Seth, back me up, please!\" pleaded Jay. \"We can't just leave him out there to die, are you crazy!?\" \"What do you want to do?\" James asked Seth. \"I'll do whatever you want to do!\" \"Let's vote on it!\" Seth suggested in a panic. \"I fucking vote you let me in!\" the man shrieked. \"Here's my vote,\" announced Danny, raising his hand. \"Fuck all of you, I'm letting him in. This is boring.\" But just as Danny stood up, the man screamed, \"THERE'S SOMETHING OUT HERE!\" A deafening roar emanated from outside, and something sliced clean through the man's neck, decapitating him. Blood sprayed everywhere, and the man's head came rolling towards us, settling at Danny's feet as we all screamed. \"This is real!\" screeched Danny. \"This is fucking real!\" And with that, he raised his foot and booted the head in James' direction, who jerked it away with his gun towards Craig, and this started off a game of soccer with the head, because no one wanted it anywhere near them, least of all me. James slipped over in the blood that was all over the floor, and he crashed into my legs, sending me toppling down with him. I landed with my eyes exactly in line with the eyes of the head. I let out a shriek and punched it away, and it landed at Jonah's feet. \"You guys!\" he exclaimed. \"This man was alive a few seconds ago, we can't play soccer with his head!\" He bent down and picked the head up as James and I climbed unsteadily to our feet, our arms around each other. Oh look at that, I was crying again. As Jonah straightened up with the head, a load of blood and head fluid splattered out of the neck, and Jonah hastily dropped it with an, \"Eurgh!\" \"What the fuck is going on!?\" shouted Danny. \"It blinked at me!\" wailed Jonah. \"It- it blinked at my face!\" Finally, Craig saw sense and chucked a blanket over the head, and Seth used a tripod of some sorts to shift it out of the way. \"There's blood all over my floor!\" whined James. \"Really Franco?\" I snapped. \"Like really? We just watched a man have his head sliced clean off his body, and you're bitching about the fucking state of the floor ? Get your priorities straight, man!\" I was seriously on the verge of losing my shit. It hadn't even been twenty-four hours and I was already totally losing my mind. Just how long would it take for me to go completely nuts? \"Someone should look out the hole!\" advised Seth. \"I ain't looking out that hole!\" exclaimed Craig. \"Last person who looked through that hole got his head chopped off!\" \"Wait, wait, wait, wait!\" gasped Jay, who was still out of breath from Head Soccer. \"What is out there might still be out there!\" Everyone started going 'shh!' \"Okay, I know, I know,\" whispered James, beginning to move towards the stairs. He gestured at us to follow him. He led us up to a lookout room at the very top of the house. He tore the boards away from the window and we all looked outside. There was nothing there. No wild animal, no human. No signs of life at all. All that was out there was thick, opaque smoke, fire, burning cars and buildings, sparks and that gigantic hole that had swallowed all our friends. \"Oh. Holy. Shit,\" I muttered. A/N- So Danny has arrived. That means shit is just gonna start going downhill from here, doesn't it? Well, I hope you liked the chapter!

Chapter Six- She's Got No Soul \" Come on, Dale, this is gonna be fun!\" Callie insisted, kicking her older brother lightly in the shin. \"Don't tell me this isn't what you've wanted for the last twenty-two years since I came along.\" \" I don't need a brother!\" Dale sulked, folding his arms defiantly. \"I don't even want you that much.\" \" I think you're just jealous because Dad's attention won't be totally focussed on you,\" Callie retorted, also folding her arms. She and her brother were very alike; both stubborn, both head-strong. But Callie wasn't quite as moronic. \" I am a man. I do not need the attention of a father figure,\" he said, straightening up to his full height. \"This guy's gonna be a total dick. I know it.\" \" Well, why don't we go see?\" Callie suggested, pointing out the window. \"The moving truck's just pulled up. They're here.\" \" Oh, fuck me,\" Dale sighed as their dad went hurrying out the front door. Callie and Dale followed him, lurking in the doorway. A woman not much younger than their dad was walking up the path. She was very pretty, in an over-fifty kind of way. Callie waved good-naturedly at her, and Dale scowled. \" Oh Jesus, Dale. What?\" \" She's not our mom,\" Dale said. \" I know, but she can be as good as,\" Callie replied, and she went skipping down the pathway, joining her dad and step-mom's conversation just as her dad asked where Brennan was. \" He's still in the car,\" Nancy said uncomfortably, gesturing at the blue sedan. Callie and her father turned to look, and sure enough, she could see Brennan's curly head in the back seat. \"It was kind of a rough drive. Hello, Callie,\" she added warmly to her new stepdaughter. Callie smiled back. \"Hiya, Nancy.\" She gave her a hug as Robert struck up a conversation with Don From Across The Road. \"Welcome to the neighbourhood.\" \" Thank you, sweetheart,\" she said, also smiling. \" So, this is my brother,\" Callie introduced as she, Nancy and her dad walked up the path towards the house. \"Dale, though you already know that.\" \" Hi Dale,\" Nancy said. \" Hey Nancy,\" Dale replied. \"Could you make me a grilled-cheese sandwich?\" \" Dale!\" Callie scolded, glaring at him. \"Don't be such a dickface! You're thirty-nine, make your own fucking sandwich!\" \" Sure,\" Nancy replied regardless. \" No!\" Robert retorted. \"Dale just ate. He's testing you to see how much he can get away with.\" \" I'm hungry,\" Dale persisted, but Robert ignored him and led Nancy into the house, leaving Dale and Callie outside to meet Brennan, who finally pulled his head out of his ass and got out of the car. He and Dale stared at each other for a few moments whilst Callie awkwardly stood there, rocking back and forth on her heels. Then Brennan advanced on the two of them, coming to a stop about ten feet away. \" Hey,\" he said monotonously. \" Hey,\" answered Dale tonelessly. \" What's up,\" Callie said, trying for a peppier tone of voice. \" I'm Brennan,\" her stepbrother presented himself. \" I'm Dale,\" Dale said. \"But you have to call me Dragon.\" Callie facepalmed. \"What in the fuck, bro?\" \" You have to call me Nighthawk,\" Brennan said quickly. \" Well, I'm Callie,\" she said in an attempt to inject a little normalcy into the situation. \"And you can call me Callie. Or Cal. I'm not fussed either way.\" \" Sorry, little lady, the men are talking,\" Brennan said, holding his hand up to her face as he and Dale continued to glower at each other. \" Hey, fucker! Don't talk to my little sister like that!\" Dale exclaimed angrily. \" Dale, chill out,\" Callie warned, holding her brother's arm. \" Wait, wait, wait!\" Brennan shouted. \"I have been misinformed! At no point was I told there was a girl in the house!\" \" Well, now you know,\" Callie said, frowning. This guy was really beginning to piss her off. \"The vagina between my legs signifies that I am, indeed, female, you total asshole. And by the way, you have to call me Huntress.\" -Step Brothers, 2008 \"You wanna do a what now?\" I frowned at James as we stood outside his in-house library a couple of hours after we'd seen the devastation outside. Being trapped in his own house was just fine for James; he'd been able to change clothes whilst I was stuck in my dirty shorts and now-laddered tights from the party, though I had stolen one of his red tank tops and I'd torn the feet clean off my tights because they were so tattered from running they were barely there anyway. \"A video confessional,\" he repeated like it was obvious. \"Like in 127 Hours .\" \"Not everything has to link back to one of your movies, y'know,\" I teased, and he playfully shoved my head. \"No, there was actual scientific fact behind it,\" he insisted. \"Talking to his camera stopped the real guy from going fucking nuts.\" He held up the hand-held camera from said movie. \"C'mon Kenzie. Please? For me?\" He batted his eyelashes at me and pouted like a little kid. I sighed loudly, but jokingly, grabbing the camera from him. \"Alright then. For you. Let's make a fucking confessional.\" I set everything up in the middle of the library on the (now de-blooded) tripod Seth had used to move the severed head. James positioned two chairs in front of the lens and I settled myself one whilst he pressed the REC button. \"Hi,\" he said to the camera. \"This is James Franco, um, in my house, in my library.\" \"And I'm Mack Bolton, broadcasting to you live from the hellhole that is more commonly known as Hollywood,\" I said. \"We've been stuck here for about twenty-four hours,\" James continued. \"Danny McBride is here.\" He had now adopted the tone of a sulky seventeen-year-old girl, and I'm pretty sure it was totally unintentional. \"I didn't even invite him to my party, but he came and passed out in the bathtub, and I gotta say, it's like typical fucking McBride.\" \"Wait,\" I said quietly, turning to look at James. \"Dude. You didn't invite Danny to your party? That's more than a little fucked up, man. He has done nothing to you! Yeah, he can be a jackass sometimes, but he really is not that bad!\" \"Says the girl who nearly had a restraining order slapped on him for sexual harassment!\" James retorted, glaring at me. \"James!\" I gasped. \"Don't say that on camera! I only told you and Dave, and I only told you because you're Dave's brother! Look,\" I said, looking back to the camera. \"It wasn't as bad as he's making it out to be. Danny just got a little touchy with me on the set of Pineapple Express is all. And I didn't nearly get a restraining order put on him!\" I added to James. \"I warned him with one. I wasn't gonna actually do it!\" \"Okay fine, what about when we did Your Highness ?\" James challenged. \"When he made you wear that costume? Fucking hell, you looked like Princess Leia after the fat slug thing kidnaps her! And he kept touching your tits! It looked like Game of Thrones ! Look, Mack, you're my brother's girl,\" he said, more gently now. \"And I love you like a sister. I just wanna protect you, y'know? You're my little bitch.\" He turned back to the camera. \"I've been feeling really weird about Danny lately,\" he said. \"Like, I don't really know if I wanna be friends with him, and then he fucking showed up at my party and now, we're stuck here with him in disaster lockdown, so…\" A sharp knock on the wall behind us caused us both to turn around. Danny was standing in the doorway, grinning at the two of us. \"What up?\" he said merrily. \"Danny. Hi bro,\" I said, trying not to physically gulp. Fuck, had he heard?! \"Hey, Danny. What's up, man?\" James said quickly. \"Not much. What are you doing?\" he asked curiously. \"What is this?\" \"It's just a video confessional,\" James replied. \"Yeah, we're going all Blair Witch Project on this shit,\" I said. Danny nodded slowly a couple of times before he turned and moseyed his way back down the corridor, out of earshot. \"Fuck that dude,\" James hissed, whipping back round to face the camera. \"Okay,\" I groaned, standing up. \"It's time to kill the bitchfest, I think.\" And with that, I reached out and hit the camera's power button, sending the screen to black. \"Yo, fuckfaces!\" I bellowed, cupping my hands around my mouth. \"Dinner's served! Get your asses into the dining room, I haven't spent the last hour slaving over this for you lot to ignore it!\" Well, at the mention of dinner the boys practically came a-runnin'. We all sat down around James' massive dining table to glasses of red wine and plates of pizza and potatoes that I'd managed to cook with what little electricity there was. The conversation was mainly consisting of theories of what in the fuck was going on. \"Earthquakes cause tsunamis,\" suggested James, who naturally was sitting at the head of the table. \"Yes!\" agreed Seth, pointing at him. \"Tsunamis cause other tsunamis,\" James continued. \"Disaster.\" \"I mean, for all we know, the fucking Lakers could have just won,\" put in Danny. \"And that's the reason why all this is happening.\" \"The hole in Franco's front yard?\" said Seth. \"Sinkhole. Every single time I turn on the news, sinkhole in South America, bunch of South Americans getting sucked into the ground.\" \"Sinkhole de Mayo!\" piped up Jonah. \"Sinkhole de Mayo,\" repeated Seth. \"That's why it's named that, because sinkholes happen in the summertime.\" \"It's Cinco de Mayo, you uncultured turds,\" I said with a sigh. \"It's not wildfires, it's not earthquakes, it's not sinkholes,\" Jay said quietly. \"I think I know what it is.\" \"Let's hear it,\" said Craig, whilst I put my head in my hands. If he said Judgement Day again, I swore to God… \"I think it's the apocalypse,\" he replied, more dramatically than what was probably intended. All the other guys made various jeering comments as I tried and failed to look supportive of what Jay was saying, when in truth…I just thought it was total bullshit. \"I'm serious, guys,\" Jay insisted. \"It's all here.\" He held up a Bible. \"In the Book of Revelations.\" \"You took my Bible?\" James asked with a sneer. \"Well just hear me out and you tell me what I'm describing isn't what's going on right now,\" Jay said, opening the book and beginning to read, \"'And the skies shall open up, and the light of the Lord shall shine down, and those of good heart shall be brought into my kingdom of Heaven.' That's the Rapture, those are the gigantic beams of blue light,\" he explained. \"The lights none of us saw,\" I muttered. \"'And there will be a great mountain burning in fire',\" he kept reading. \"I mean, the Hollywood Hills are literally engulfed in flames as we sit here right now.\" I felt a little crack in my heart then. My house…my poor home had been up in those Hills. My whole life, gone in a crackle of flames. I had to blink hard to stop any tears escaping. \"The Hollywood Hills ain't no mountain,\" Craig retorted. \"It's a hill. Takes about ten minutes to get across that motherfucker with no traffic.\" \"Coldwater,\" James and I both said. \"I take Laurel Canyon,\" said Seth. \"Cahuenga,\" Jonah said. \"I usually zip down Barham,\" said Danny. \"Guys, can I just fucking finish?\" Jay interrupted irritatedly. \"'And out of the pit rose a great red dragon having seven heads',\" he read. \"'That old serpent called the devil and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world, was released unto the Earth.'\" He turned the book around to show us an illustration of what looked like the crossbreed of a goat, a rhino and a basketball player. \"I love that dude!\" said Craig, pointing at the picture. \"He's from Where The Wild Things Are !\" \"Jay,\" I said uncomfortably. \"Don't you think all this is just a little far-fetched? I mean, Judgement Day, the apocalypse, Satan? That's a load of very heavy stuff.\" \"It's a load of bullshit,\" James said dismissively. \"It's not bullshit!\" Jay averred. \"Want to know something else, Jay?\" James said spitefully. \"If this is the end of the world and all the good people died, what you're saying is Seth, me, Kenzie, Jonah, Danny and Craig are a bunch of assholes.\" \"I'm straight-up lovable, son,\" stated Craig. \"And if this really is the apocalypse,\" James carried on his little tirade. \"You're here too. So, that means you're just a shitty as the rest of us. Doesn't feel too good, does it?\" \"James!\" I hissed, punching him on the arm. Jay, meanwhile, just didn't say anything. I threw my slice of pizza down on my plate and stood up, shoving my chair back with a scrape. \"God, you guys are driving me crazy! It's like living with a bunch of seven-year-olds! Jesus fucking Christ!\" I turned on my heel and stormed away, my long hair whipping out behind me in brown curtain. I don't know why, but I ended up locking myself away in James' en suite bathroom. I sat down cross-legged in his bathtub with my head in my hands and tears pouring down my cheeks. I was cracking. I'd been trapped in this house for one day, and I was cracking. My mind was scrambled like eggs. I couldn't focus on anything except for the demolition of LA that was outside the front door. I didn't know if just LA was a burning wreck, or if it had spread all over America, or even if the whole world was like this. I didn't know if my boyfriend was alive, or my dad, or anyone in my family. I didn't know if there was anything left of my home, of my pets. I was so confused about everything, and I didn't know what to do. I knew I'd overreacted at dinner, but I hadn't been able to help it. I hated how much James and Jay detested each other. Jay was my very best friend, and James was pretty much my brother-in-law; he protected me, he kept me safe. I just wanted everyone to get along! Why was that too fucking much to ask for?! I kicked the side of the bath, which only earned me some stabbing pains shooting up my ankle. God, I was so furious with just…everything. And everyone. There was a knock on the door. \"Kenz? Kenzie?\" \"Fuck off, Franco. I'm not in the mood.\" \"For fuck sake, Mackenzie, open the fucking door.\" \"Oh, Mackenzie , is it now? You're getting all stern, Franco? Oh, well I guess I have to open the door now, don't I?\" \"You're acting like a fucking kid.\" \" I'm acting like a kid? Says the fucking primadonna who threw a bitch-fit because someone came to his party who, shock horror, wasn't invited. I don't give a shit! Piss off !\" \"You're in my bathroom. I'm not going anywhere.\" \"You're such a pain in my ass, Franco.\" \"Back at you, Bolton. Now open the door.\" \"I. Don't. Want. To.\" \"Mackenzie, open the door before I fucking knock it down.\" James had adopted his 'angry big brother' tone, and I knew that arguing more was futile. With a sigh, I stood up and clambered out of the bath, undoing the bathroom door and opening it. James was literally standing eight inches away from me, arms folded and face set in a hard expression. I copied him. \"What is up with you, man?\" he asked me, no longer angry. Just concerned. \"I don't even know anymore,\" I said quietly. \"I'm breaking, James. I'm shattering. It feels like I've got no soul, no conscience, no mind! I feel totally empty, and I don't know what to do.\" \"Well, fucking calm down for one,\" he said simply. \"All that stuff Jay said is a pile of shit, okay? There is no way that this is the apocalypse. All this Bible shit makes no sense. We're good people. We're great people! We make people happy! If this really was the apocalypse, we'd have been taken up to Heaven just like everyone else God thinks is awesome enough.\" \"You know what? I really don't want to have this conversation now,\" I said curtly. \"I'm tired, and I'm going to sleep.\" I pushed past him, heading out the bedroom and down the stairs to collect the t-shirt I'd slept in last night. I walked down the stairs to find Seth arranging his and Jay's sleeping spot in the nook of the sofas, and I didn't miss Danny's shout from the other bathroom. \"Hey guys, I'm going to sleep now! Nobody come in here and bother me!\" Charmanté. Like we didn't know what that was code for. The next few days passed slowly…so slowly. There was literally nothing for us to do in this godforsaken house. The lack of WiFi put paid to the normal things like Facebooking, Tweeting and Netflix. So basically we sat around playing card games like Go Fish and Snap. Yes, really. We were all slowly going stir crazy, but none of us dared say anything about it. One thing that was certain, though, was that James had been most definitely right about one member of our little survival clan. Danny was behaving like a total moron. When he wasn't hiding himself away and jacking off to James' porn magazine, he was sleeping, eating or just plain getting up in everyone's grills. He. Never. Shut. Up. At lunchtime on the fifth day of us being shut up like a pack of rats, he really began pushing my buttons in ways I didn't even think were possible. \"First bit,\" Seth said, as Craig carefully positioned a knife over the hunk of cheese we were cutting up for lunch. Craig was being very precise with it all. \"You're not cutting it all?\" Seth asked. \"That's smart. You're divvying it up first.\" \"I'm pretty chill on that idea,\" I said, absent-mindedly scratching at the tattoo of two birds and a cherry blossom tree on my right wrist. \"Make the cheese last, I cannot live without some cheesy calcium.\" \"This is like, Fruyère or some shit,\" said Craig, just as Danny licked his finger and wiped it along the entire chunk that Craig was about to slice off. \"Come on, Danny!\" Jonah, Jay, Seth and I all went, \"Eurgh!\" \"Are you fucking kidding me?!\" I spat. I grabbed the knife from Craig's hand and pointed it at Danny. \"I am this fucking close to cutting your goddamn finger off , McBride!\" I was so angry that I barely noticed James quietly taking Seth to the side to talk to him about something. \"If they're all equal, what does it matter?\" he demanded. \"It's not one fucking chunk per person, asshat!\" I said angrily. \"It's one chunk per fucking week! We actually need this food, you fat fuck!\" I slammed the knife down, tip-first, into the table barely an inch from Danny's arm, burying it a centimetre deep in the wood. \"Woah, woah, Kenzie! Not the table!\" James shouted, running over and wrenching the knife out. \"Come on, sis! This shit's expensive!\" \"I'm sorry!\" I said, shoving my hands in my shorts pockets, the same shorts I'd been wearing for the last five or six days. God, I was filthy. \"I'm just a little highly strung at the minute. I'm sorry Danny.\" I really wasn't. I kind of regretted missing. \"You know what, Kenz, it's cool,\" Danny replied, holding up his hand. \"I hear PMS is a very hard thing to control.\" I just shot him the bird. \"Let's do all the drugs!\" Seth suggested with a borderline-manic smile, holding the pile of every narcotic that was in the house. \"I don't really want to,\" Jay said unenthusiastically, sipping his can of beer. \"Shoulda thought of that before you drank a can full of ecstasy!\" Seth gleefully informed him. Jay rapidly spat out his mouthful of drink. \" What ?!\" After that, it really did not take long for everyone to become totally and utterly fucked up. The cocktail of weed, shrooms, E, Sour Diesel and God only knows what else sent us all on the wildest trip any of us had ever experienced. I felt like I was physically on HFS from 21 Jump Street . Seth pretended to breathe bubbles out of his mouth like a dragon. James and Seth had a lightsaber fight with a couple of lamps while the rest of us threw money and 'made it rain' on them. The six of us performed a can-can-style dance. Seth was certain that if one of us poked him in the nipple he would turn into a pure ball of light, which Danny tested out. I tried to climb the wall like Spider-Man and jumped on James' back yelling, \"DIE, HARRY OSBORNE! DIE!\" causing James to fall over backwards and wind me when he crashed into my chest. Danny became convinced that his eyes had become mouths. We stuck Jay in a chair and lifted him up above our heads like he was at a Bar Mitzvah. Jay and Seth performed a dance while the rest of us stood around them clapping. I removed my top and ran around the house in just my bra and shorts, hanging upside down from the upstairs railings by my knees until the guys formed a human safety net below me so I could fall down into their arms. The opening bars of Paper Planes by M.I.A began to play. FROM THE GUYS WHO BROUGHT YOU SUPERBAD , read a chalkboard. AND PINEAPPLE EXPRESS … I fly like paper, get high like planes. If you catch me at the border, I got- Dale (Seth) watched and cheered as Saul (James) dropped to the floor and did the Worm. COMES THE MOST ANTICIPATED SEQUEL IN HUMAN HISTORY Dale and Saul lit up a seven-part joint and inhaled and took a drag, when Dale started choking. \"Should we call Red?\" Dale asked. \"Get more weed?\" \"I don't know, man,\" Saul replied hesitantly. \"That guy's gone crazy!\" Cut to Red (Danny) sitting at the head of a table with Saul and Dale with Mandy (me) standing behind him, armed with a gun (baseball bat) \"Good thing I have a lot of fucking weed for you guys,\" Red announced, popping open a briefcase. \"I hooked you guys up. Now I need you guys to assassinate-\" [insert close-up] \"-Woody Harrelson.\" Cut to 'Woody Harrelson' (IE, Jonah in a cowboy hat and weed t-shirt) \" If pot's legalised, my business will suffer, \" Red said in a voiceover. \" And if my business suffers, I suffer. So much suffering, all because of that inbred, hemp seed Woody Harrelson. \" \"I have to do what's right!\" 'Woody' said. \"Weed is for the people, it's the people's weed!\" Cut back to Red, Dale, Saul and Mandy around the table. \"If you don't assassinate him,\" Red said aggressively. \"Mandy here is gonna assassinate both of you. Mand!\" he barked, and Mandy pointed her gun at Saul's head. \"Run!\" Saul yelled, grabbing a handful of cocaine (pancake mix) and throwing it in Mandy's and Red's faces before he and Dale made a run for it. \"Argh!\" Red screamed. \"Mandy, go!\" \"I can't!\" she spluttered back, still wiping the coke out of her eyes. Red seized her by throat. \"You kill them, or I'm gonna kill you! Got it?\" Cut to the beginning of a fight between Saul, Dale and Matheson (Craig), followed by clips of various gunfights and someone falling from a balcony. Cut to Dale and Saul hiding, about to run into combat. \"B.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F forever!\" Saul whispered. \"B.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F!\" Dale hastily replied. Cut to Red and Dale about to punch each other in the face, followed by Saul on the floor about to shoot someone, to Saul being pushed along the floor screaming. Cut to Mandy straddling a struggling Dale, her gun pressed against his forehead. \"Mandy, you don't have to do this!\" he shouted. \"Yes I do!\" she sob-shouted back. \"If I don't kill you, Dale, then Red will kill me! I can't die! Not yet!\" Cut to a dramatic car chase (with Tonka cars) between Saul and Dale in one car, and Red, Mandy and Matheson in a flaming oil tanker. \"You're letting them get away!\" yelled Red. \"Fuck this!\" Mandy snarled, jumping out of the window just as the picture cut to the (toy) tanker falling down a cliff-side (a step). PINEAPPLE EXPRESS 2: BLOOD RED , the final chalkboard read. The final clip was of 'Woody Harrelson.' \"I smoked weed with Steve Jobs,\" he said. \"And that's when he came up with the iPad! It's pretty great!\" The six of us were all huddled up together, all of us embarking on a pretty mellow comedown. We were watching the trailer we'd made for Seth and James' idea for the Pineapple Express sequel, laughing and smoking what remained of the weed in the house. It was actually pretty cosy. \"We should make sequels to more of our movies,\" Seth said. We agreed. \"How about we not do Your Highness 2 ?\" James said to me and Danny. \"Aw, are you kidding?\" I said with a laugh. \"I'd love to reprise Princess Theodina! If Danny promises to keep his sticky little hands to himself this time!\" I looked at Danny pointedly. \"I cannot promise that,\" he chuckled. \"Do 128 Hours ,\" Seth suggested. \"The story of one man and his quest to find the arm he savagely cut off before it goes mouldy and can't be reattached,\" I snorted. \"The beginning of the rest of your comedies,\" said Jay. \"Looks good,\" said Seth, just as an almighty crash on the front door made all of us start. Whatever was out there was banging so violently that all the barricades we'd set up over the door were crashing down, and James quickly pointed his revolver at the door. With every smash we screamed, huddling closer and closer together. The whacking and cracking continued, and so did our screaming. Whatever it was really, really wanted to get inside the house. \"What the fuck is it!?\" I shrieked. \"Franco, fucking shoot it!\" The final blockade over the door came tumbling down, and out of the fog and smoke appeared Emma Watson. She gasped when she saw us all lying there. \"Emma!\" exclaimed Seth. \"It's Emma,\" confirmed James, like it actually needed confirming. \"Oh my God, you guys are alive!\" she cried in sheer relief, clapping a hand to her forehead. In her other hand she was clutching an axe. \"You're actually alive, thank God!\" I looked at the shredded remains of our door shield. \"Y'know, Emma, a simple Alohomora would have sufficed nicely.\" A/N- And Emma has arrived! Well, not for long, because we all know how this turns out, don't we? Anyway, hope you liked the chapter!

It really means a lot, and it's been awesome chatting with you these last couple of weeks! XD Chapter Seven- A Number One Hit \" Three, two, one,\" Mandy counted down, before thrusting her leg out and kicking in the apartment door of Saul or Sole or whatever the fuck the dealer was called. Budlofsky spun round the corner with his gun cocked and aimed, whilst Matheson walked around the apartment, looking through Saul's stuff for any sign of where he and the witness had gone. \" Red said he'd be here,\" he said, pulling a wooden bowl down from a shelf. \" Yeah, because Red's a really reliable source,\" Mandy snapped, rolling her eyes as she stood up from looking under the sofa. She headed over to the wall and looked at a vintage Scarface poster. \"The guy's got sweet taste in décor, I'll give him that.\" She reached up and pulled the poster down, rolling it up and stashing it in the interior pocket of her leather jacket. Matheson made himself comfortable on the couch and started fiddling with the weed set out on the coffee table. \"Mmhmm!\" he hummed gleefully. \"Them some drugs!\" He picked up a still-lit roach and placed it in his mouth. \" Smells like vomit in this house,\" Budlofsky said, wrinkling his nose as he pressed his cell phone to his ear. \" Found the culprit,\" Mandy said disgustedly, eyeing up the splatter of sick on a printer by the door. \" Want a hit, man?\" Matheson offered Bud, holding the joint out. \"It's still lit.\" \" I'm having dinner with my wife,\" he refused. \"She can always tell. Smell it on my sweater.\" \" For real?\" laughed Matheson, about to take another hit. \" Wait,\" Mandy said quickly, hurrying over and snatching the joint from his hand, despite his protests. \"It's still lit. Fuck! That means they were here! Like, really recently, otherwise this would have gone out! Fuck shit balls! We must have just fucking missed their sorry asses! Great. So there goes my style of never missing a target.\" \" You ain't got no style, motherfucker,\" chuckled Matheson, and Mandy scowled at him with such ferocity that he quickly scooted over to the furthest point of the sofa that he could. \" Ted, it's Budlofsky,\" Bud suddenly said into the phone. \"We're here. Saul's gone.\" \" And Mathe-\" Matheson's shout was cut off by a swift punch to the gut from Mandy that caused him to start choking as he inhaled his smoke wrong. \"And Matheson!\" he shouted anyway. \" I think he knew we were coming,\" Budlofsky continued. \" They not here, Ted,\" Matheson called. \"Hi Ted!\" \" Give me the fucking phone!\" Mandy snarled, ripping the phone out of Bud's hand. \"Boss, it's Mandy. Mandy Averlage. The fucker made a run for it before we got here. But it was definitely him.\" She picked up a bag of Pineapple Express from the coffee table between her thumb and forefinger. \"The Pineapple Express is here. We're now going to beat the fuck out of Red so he tells us where they went. Ciao.\" The three of them arrived at Red's fifteen minutes later, with Mandy again kicking the door down. It took some scuffling, some punches and Mandy drawing her Micro SMG to eventually persuade Red to sit the fuck down and wait for Saul to contact him. Almost laughably quickly, the phone started ringing. Mandy cracked Red around the head to get him to answer. \" Hello?\" he said casually. He waited for the answer. \"Yeah, Saul. Yeah, I'm fine, man. I just stubbed my toe.\" A long pause. \"I would never talk to anyone about the stuff that I do with you involving drugs.\" He looked up at Mandy, who positioned her finger tighter on her trigger. There was another pause. \"Per-fect.\" There was another pause, and Red covered the mouthpiece of the phone to look back at Mandy and Matheson whilst Budlofsky dithered in the background. \"There's somebody else on the phone with him,\" he informed them. \" What the fuck? Who?!\" demanded Mandy. \" I don't know!\" Red whispered. \"He's whispering to another man.\" \" The witness,\" Mandy muttered. \" So you're coming by tomorrow?\" Red said into the phone. Pause. \"Just heard you whispering to that other guy you were talking to. Who is that?\" Pause number six. \"Is that the bubby that's on Forty-First and River Street? The one where we played shuffleboard that one time?\" Mandy made note of the address. \"Noon it is, bromosexual.\" Red motioned at Matheson that everything was confirmed. \"Okay yeah. We'll definitely hit the casino up.\" Red hung up the phone. Mandy stood up, stashing her SMG away and rubbing her fingerless glove-clad hands together. \"Well boys, looks like retirement is coming earlier than anticipated.\" -Pineapple Express, 2008 We sat Emma down at the table, gave her some food and a blanket and let her tell her tale of what life was like outside walls. \"I hid in a drainpipe for days,\" she told us. \"Like, three or four, I don't even know how many. And then I stopped hearing people and I started hearing growling noises.\" Oh, fuck me, that did not sound good in any way, shape or form. \"Out there, in your travels, er, did you see anything that you would describe as…apocalyptish?\" Jay asked her, and we all groaned. \"Jay! Knock it off!\" I hissed at him. \"I mean, no,\" Emma replied. \"But, er, I would say it's completely obvious what…what's going on here. I mean, it's a, it's a zombie invasion.\" \"Fuck!\" exclaimed Seth. \"I'm the one who said it's been zombies,\" said Danny. \"You said zombies?\" asked James. \"I said zombies the whole time,\" Danny answered. \"I don't think…you never said zombies!\" argued Seth, while James and Danny high-fived. \"Great, so we've gone from Evan Almighty to 28 Days Later in the space of about thirty seconds,\" I groaned, dragging my hands down my face. \"Wait a second, you guys haven't been proven right,\" Jay reasoned. \"These are still just theories.\" \"Honestly, I'm just so relieved that you guys are here,\" Emma said thankfully. \"And I'm very happy about the idea of sleeping and just-\" \"You tired?\" James asked her. \"Yeah.\" She nodded. \"If you want to take a little rest, you're welcome to do that upstairs,\" he offered. She nodded again. \"Thank you.\" I hopped down from the worktop I'd been sitting on and offered my hand to her. \"Come on then, Em. I'll show you the way.\" \"I can do it!\" James protested. \"Okay, fine,\" I said, holding up my hands. \"You do it then, Franco.\" \"Thanks guys,\" she said gratefully, picking up her axe. \"Seriously, you're awesome, really!\" \" You're awesome!\" Jonah said as she and James walked past. He looked back at the rest of us, grinning. \"So fucking tight.\" We still followed James upstairs anyway, the five of us waiting out in the little hallway. He was in the room with Emma for a minute or so, then stepped out saying, \"We'll be right out here, okay?\" Quite literally, as he was about to find out. He frowned at us as he closed the bedroom door. \"The fuck are you guys doing out here?\" \"Here's what I think we should do,\" said Seth. \"She's British, right? She's used to eating shitty food anyway. Let's just give her all the shitty food that we don't want!\" \"Dude!\" I exclaimed. \"That is way, way too mean! She's been living in a fucking drainpipe for the last four days, for fuck sake!\" \"That's fucked up!\" agreed James. \"Look how tiny she is, she's not even a full seven! She's like half a seven!\" \"And anyway, British food is great!\" I said. \"Have you ever had proper English fish and chips? When Jonah and I were in London promoting Jump Street , it's all I ate! That shit is good food!\" \"This is a fucking cool thing, man,\" chipped in Danny. \"I, for one, am very excited. I'm a massive Harry Potter fan.\" \"Haha, yes, Danny!\" I cheered, high-fiving him. \"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good!\" \"Mischief fucking managed,\" Danny replied, grinning. \"Fuck yeah, Kenzie!\" High-five number two. \"What?!\" James sounded and looked like he could barely comprehend what we were saying. \"Yes, I love fucking Harry Potter !\" Danny defended. \"I cannot wait till she wakes up and I can ask her all these amazing about how they made those motion pictures!\" \"Take it easy, Dumbledore!\" James exclaimed. \"Guys, listen, listen,\" Jay cut in. \"I think we need to address the elephant in the room.\" \"Woah. Jay, don't talk about Craig like that!\" Seth hissed. \"That's fucked up. I'm right here, man,\" said Craig, sounding offended. \"I'm not calling Craig an elephant!\" Jay said quickly. The guys didn't listen to this, and continued defending Craig, despite the fact he hadn't actually been offending Craig. It cumulated with James informing him, \"That's racist.\" \"I wasn't referring to him!\" Jay insisted. \"I was referring to the issue that's on all of our minds!\" \"What?\" said James. \"This is one girl, in a house with six males and a girl who's a penis away from being a male,\" Jay whispered. \"Okay, thanks for that,\" I said, rolling my eyes. \"Look, I really don't care about what this 'issue' is, so I'm gonna go in there and make sure that Emma is okay. This is a situation that requires a woman's touch, and I am that woman. You guys just fuck off downstairs, for God's sake!\" I didn't wait for their reply; instead, I just walked into James' bedroom, shutting the door firmly behind me. \"Hey Emma,\" I said, sitting down next to her on the trunk at the end of James' bed. \"Hi Mackenzie,\" she replied, smiling tiredly at me. \"No no,\" I said quickly, sitting down cross-legged in the middle of the bed. \"Just call me Mack, seriously. Formalities were thrown out the window around the same time the Hollywood Hills imploded.\" \"So how's everything been in here with the boys?\" she asked. \"It could be…worse,\" I said carefully. \"Like, they act like children ninety-four percent of the time, but we're alive, we're relatively safe and we're all close enough that the constant company isn't bugging us.\" Y'know, that much. \"So have…\" she began delicately. \"Have you heard anything from your boyfriend? He's James' brother, isn't he?\" I sighed and tried not to let it show how much the question had unsettled me. \"No. I tried to phone him as soon as the…whatever this is hit, but there's absolutely no phone signal, not internet…nothing. And I'm so scared for him.\" My voice cracked on 'scared' and a couple of tears started to streak down my cheeks. Again. Could I not just have one day where I didn't start crying?! \"Oh my God, Mack, I'm so sorry!\" Emma exclaimed quickly, taking hold of my hand. \"I didn't want to upset you or anything!\" \"No, I know,\" I sniffed, wiping my eyes. I hadn't worn make-up for days; the smears coming off on my hands was dirt. \"It's just…you know, I can sit here and act like despite everything I'm okay, but I have this constant underlying sick feeling because I just don't know anything.\" \"None of us know anything,\" Emma said, leaning down to unzip her shoes. \"And I think that maybe that's the best. I think the truth will end up killing us.\" \"I think you might be right,\" I said grimly. \"The thing is-\" I didn't get a chance to finish my sentence, because suddenly I could hear the boys' raised voices through the door. It was Danny. \"If anyone's gonna rape somebody, it's Jay!\" Emma and I both snapped our heads up. What the fuck ? \"What!?\" Jay's tone was incredulous. \"He came up with the rape idea!\" Danny was saying. \"What the fuck are they talking about?!\" Emma demanded, hastily zipping her shoes back on and jumping to her feet, axe firmly in her grasp. \"Emma, I'm pretty sure it's not what it sounds like!\" I said quickly, clambering to my feet. \"They're going to rape us!\" she exclaimed fearfully. \"That's what they said!\" \"No, Emma, there's gonna be a logical explanation for this!\" I insisted. \"No! Mack, we need to get out of here!\" she asserted, gripping her axe tighter. \"They've lost it!\" \"No, Emma, I really-\" I didn't even have time to finish my sentence as Emma ripped the bedroom door and stepped into the hall with an angry yell of, \"Hey!\" Her axe was primed to kill. \"Woah! Easy, easy!\" I heard the guys shout. \"Back the fuck up!\" she warned, which was when I hurried out into the hall too. Things were about to go very south, very quickly. \"What's wrong?\" Seth asked her. \"What's wrong!?\" she repeated disbelievingly. \"We just heard you guys talking about which one of you's gonna get to rape us!\" \"No, no, no, no!\" the guys all shouted. \"Look!\" I yelled over all the hubbub, stepping in between Emma and the guys with my arms out like I was blocking them back. \"Let's all just take a second to talk this over, okay!\" \"I got this,\" Seth said, stepping out of the group. \"It's funny, it's funny! We were specifically talking about not raping you!\" His words fell on deaf ears, as Emma took four steps forward and whacked Seth clean in the face with her axe handle. There was a crack, and Seth stumbled back clutching his face, groaning in pain. \"BACK. UP!\" Emma shouted, herding the guys down the stairs as I walked behind her, trying to convince her that it was all a misunderstanding, I was sure, how the guys were anything but rapists, how I'd been locked in here for days with them and hadn't even had one rapey advance made towards me. It didn't matter; Emma had hit that state of anger where no rational thought could be made. She was swinging her axe at the guys like a madwoman, and as she drew it back for a sixth time I grabbed hold of the handle in the middle, forcing her to stop. \"Mackenzie, get the fuck off!\" she snarled, pushing the handle hard into my chest so I was winded and forced to let go, falling down onto my ass with a pained cry. Fuck me, that floor was hard! \"It's me, Jonah Hill!\" Jonah suddenly exclaimed soothingly, attempting to reach out to her. \"America's sweetheart! J-Bug, J-Bone! Your friend! I would never hurt you!\" \"Get back !\" she cried, swinging the axe yet again and causing the guys to flinch back. Yet again. This time, when I clambered to my feet I rushed over and joined the group of guys. There was no way I was hanging around with this crazy biatch. \"Give me everything you have to drink! Put it in the bag!\" she demanded hysterically. \"There is seven of us! You cannot rob us!\" Seth shouted. \"I'm not fucking around!\" she screamed, and she swung her axe round and decapitated the dick statue. \"Give her the drinks! Give her the drinks!\" yelled Craig, pointing at the island top where we'd set up our watering hole. Seth and James grabbed hold of a green duffle bag and pretty much sprinted over to fill it up with our various beers, wines, whiskeys et cetera. \"Hurry the fuck up!\" Emma shouted. \"Calm the fuck down!\" I retorted, getting seriously pissed off. \"They're getting the drinks! Just put the motherfucking axe down, you psycho!\" \"Don't give the Milky Way away!\" Seth hissed back at James as he cautiously handed Emma the bag. \"Now, Franco! Shoot her face!\" shouted Danny. \"Shoot her!\" \"I'm not gonna shoot Emma Watson!\" James shouted back. \"Mackenzie, are you coming with me?!\" Emma asked me demandingly. She wanted an answer, now. \"Emma, look, man,\" I said calmly, stepping forward so we were only a few steps apart. \"Please just stay here with us! It isn't safe out there!\" \"It isn't safe here!\" she said pleadingly. \"It's safer out there, trust me! Out there, nothing's tried to fucking rape me!\" \"Okay fine,\" I said firmly, folding my arms. \"If that's how you feel, then go. But I'm not going. No way. I'm not leaving my best friends. And there is no fucking way you're leaving here with all our drinks.\" I reached out and seized hold of the strap of the bag, and I pulled. \"Mack, what the fuck are you doing?!\" hissed Seth. \"Just let her go, she's crazy, man!\" \"Give me the fucking bag!\" I snarled at her, which was when Emma pulled her hand back and bitch-slapped me straight across the face. The force floored me, and when I say floored I mean I literally skidded back about five foot on my ass, stopping just shy of the guys. \"Oh, fuck no!\" I screeched, getting ready to rip Hermione a new asshole, but I was too late. With a scream, Emma axed down the few barricades we'd reapplied to the door and vanished into the smoke with the last of our liquid-based provisions. I remained on the floor, and I looked up at the guys with my eyebrows raised. They all looked down at me with the same expression, and I knew we were all thinking the same thing: things had just gotten so, so much worse around here. \"So today's not exactly been that chill,\" I said to the camera in James' library. \"Emma Watson turned up.\" I clapped my hands together once. \"Yeah, sounds cool, right? Turns out, not so much. There was a slight misapprehension when we heard the guys discussing rape…I know that sounds bad, but it was actually conversation about how nobody was going to be raped, rather than who would be. Um, Emma didn't really see it that way and basically tried to murder us all with an axe. No Avada Kedavra or anything clean, she was just gonna go all Friday the 13 th on our asses. And I'm talking the original, not that pile of shit they called a reboot.\" I had to take a moment there to pause and not get too het up on that. Horror movies were a passion of mine, anything from Hitchcock's Psycho to The Blair Witch Project . If it was a horror made between 1960 and 2000, I loved it. However, I had a strict reboot rule; no watching the remake if I hadn't seen the original. And after seeing the original Friday the 13 th , I immediately viewed the reboot. I have never been so disappointed in my whole life. I got bored, and this was after I'd seen someone bear-trapped and stabbed in the head, seen a girl roasted inside her own sleeping bag and seen a topless girl in the lake also get macheted through the scalp. As far as I was concerned, reboots were the work of Lucifer himself. \"I'm digressing here. Look, long story short is that Watson jacked all our drink. We have no vodka, no wine, no beer, no nothing. We don't even have any water since Danny fucking used it all to wash his fucking hair and God knows what else. So now, there's seven of us trapped in a house with no liquid sustenance, and I'm pretty sure it'll be about twenty-four hours before we've killed one of us to drink his blood. And I specifically say 'his'. Ain't no one killing me.\" I looked desperately at the ceiling. \"Seriously, God. If you can hear me, just help us! We've done nothing wrong! We're good people! We deserve to be up there with you! We deserve the Rapture! Christ, if you can hear me, just help ! I'm begging you!\" And with a sigh, I reached over and switched off the video camera. A/N- Sorry, I know this chapter is a lot shorter than usual, but I figured that was a pretty apt place to end the chapter. I'm back at school now, so updates may take a little longer. But I hope you liked the chapter, I'd love to get me some more of them reviews! Xx Gee xX PS- Don't forget to check out my Polyvore, guys![Chapter 8] Chapter Eight- Can't Take It No More \" Please tell me that you completed your simple task,\" said King Tallious, staring down at his youngest son. \"And secured the treaty signed by the Lord of the Dwarf Village.\" \" Father, they sent a beautiful woman to distract me, and I was defenceless!\" Thadeous protested. \" Don't bandy words with me, Thadeous,\" the King warned. \"Your brother and sister are to return from their quest at any moment. Please go and bathe yourself!\" \" Why must I bow to greet them?\" Thadeous demanded. \"No one does anything special for me when I do extraordinary things!\" \" For the love of the Gods, Thadeous, your sister Theodina has done more extraordinary things in the last week than you have in the entirety of your life, and she is merely a woman,\" Tallious exclaimed with annoyance. \"What extraordinary things have you done of late? Do tell me. Enlighten me.\" \" Courtney!\" Thadeous called to his faithful man-servant. \"What extraordinary things have I done?\" Courtney produced a scroll and read, \"You took a bubble bath, ate some toast, had a sleep for one hour and commissioned a naked statue of your fine self.\" Thadeous looked at his father like this proved his point. \" God, if your mother could see you now,\" the King muttered contemptuously. There was a sudden uproar towards the back of the courtroom, and Julie, the squire, began to shout, \"Hear ye, hear ye!\" \" Oh dear Gods,\" mumbled Thadeous, taking a drink of wine. \" It is with blossoming personal joy,\" Julie read from the scroll in his hands. \"that I announce the return of the mighty, the magnificent, the merciful, Prince Fabious! And the enchanting, the enthralling, the enigmatic, Princess Theodina!\" A great cheer rose up in the court, and the double doors at the back of the room opened up to a fanfare. In rode Fabious and Theodina on their matching greys, a stallion and a filly, flanked by the other knights in the guard. They held on to their horses' reigns with one hand, and their other hands were grasping each other, lifted high above their heads to the adoring yells of the crowd around them. The twins came to a stop in the middle of the court and dismounted, giving each other a warm hug before turning and grinning at their younger brother. \" Brother!\" shouted Fabious, running up the steps to embrace Thadeous. \"Oh my God, I missed you so!\" He planted a kiss on his brother, who quickly pulled away. \" Yes, we both have!\" Theodina added happily, also hugging her brother tightly, though Thadeous did not return the hug. \"It is so fantastic to see you!\" \" Father!\" Fabious turned to the King, as did Theodina, both of them dropping to their knees and bowing. \" My son,\" Tallious said proudly. \"My daughter.\" He took hold of their hands and stood them up, pulling them both into a hug. \"Welcome home.\" \" We did it, Father!\" Theodina announced. \"We defeated that Cyclops in your honour!\" \" As you all know,\" Fabious addressed the rapt crowd below the royal family. \"The evil wizard Leezar has plagued our kingdom with his foul creatures and wicked ways for years.\" \" But with our brave, trusted knights,\" added Theodina. \"And our dear Simon and Elizabeth,\" She and Fabious held their arms out for their mechanical bird companions to join them. \"We have slain the latest of the cold-blooded enemies Leezar has sent our way!\" \" Behold!\" proclaimed Fabious. \"The head of Leezar's mighty Cyclops!\" He reached into his leather travelling bag and removed the decapitated cranium of the beast, holding it up for the whole court to admire. The sight brought fresh cheers from their mouths. They were chanting the names of the prince and princess. \"Fa-bi-ous! The-o-di-na! Fa-bi-ous! The-o-di-na! Fa-bi-ous! The-o-di-na!\" Fabious handed the head over to the King, who in turn handed the head to Thadeous, who looked disgusted. The King then held up a hand to silence the court, placing his arms around his eldest son and only daughter. \"Once again, Prince Fabious and Princess Theodina have made me as proud as a father could ever be! All the land owes them gratitude.\" \" This is not the only news that I've brought home with me today!\" Fabious declared, and Theodina let out a small squeal of excitement. \"Father, brother, kingdom.\" The crowd suddenly split like the Red Sea, allowing a beautiful dark-haired woman to walk through, and Fabious ran over to take her in his arms. \" She is radiant,\" murmured the King. \" I'd like you to meet my bride-to-be,\" Fabious revealed blissfully. \"Belladonna.\" The court erupted into cheering yet again as Fabious and Belladonna kissed. \" Three cheers for my brother and Belladonna!\" Theodina shouted. \"And let us all get royally shit-faced!\" -Your Highness, 2011 \"So. We're tired. We're thirsty. We have no drinks,\" I said to the guys as we sat around the small table in the living room. \"What the fuck are we gonna do now? Just stay here and hope that we get killed by the decapitation monster before we die of thirst?\" \"That's kind of pessimistic, isn't it?\" said Jay. \"Says King of the Pessimists over here,\" I retorted. \"We're basically fucked. We are gonna die unless we can find some form of liquid sustenance.\" \"There's a couple of water containers in the basement,\" James said. \"Okay, great,\" I said with a strained smile. Just…think…positive. \"Where's the door to the basement?\" \"Um.\" James faltered. \"It's…outside. Around the other side of the house.\" Everyone groaned. Shit . This could not have been going any worse than it was. Fucking Hermione. I was never watching those movies for the rest of what was probably going to be my very short life. \"Please, please, please, just tell me you're joking,\" I begged him, putting my head in my hands. \"You're telling me you built a house with no fucking indoor basement entrance ?!\" \"I fucking didn't think I'd need one!\" he replied defensively. \"Who prepares for the fucking apocalypse, Mack?!\" \"Touché,\" I relented. I stood up and walked over to the front door. We hadn't bothered to board it back up, since with our track record, someone would chop it back down in the next two days. I put my hand on my hip and cocked my head to the side. \"So. The water is out there. We are in here. Quite the conundrum we're facing.\" The guys had all gathered around with me. \"I know for sure there's at least two jugs of water,\" James said. Jay rubbed his hands together. \"Any volunteers?\" \"Does anyone wanna volunteer to go with Jay?\" Jonah asked. \" What ?\" said Jay. \"I thought you said, 'Someone volunteer to go with me out there.' I must have misheard you,\" Jonah replied innocently. \"I'm sorry.\" \"You did not, you motherfucker!\" Jay said angrily. \"Hey, okay, ease up!\" Seth quickly interrupted. \"Just chill out, dude,\" he said to Jay. \"Just relax, man! God.\" \"So how we gonna do this, fellas?\" asked Craig. I thought for a second. Then an idea hit me. \"I got it.\" I hurried into the kitchen and went through the drawers until I came across a box of matches. I threw them to Seth. \"What the fuck am I meant to do with these?\" he questioned. \"Light one so the tip burns black,\" I explained impatiently. \"Then turn all the matches upside down and cover it up so we can't see the tips. Whoever chooses the burnt one has to get the water. It's like drawing the short straw, apocalypse-style.\" Seth opened the box and pulled out seven matches, lighting one of them and quickly blowing it out. He placed it back in the cluster of matches and mixed them all up so none of us had any idea where the burnt one was. \"So…\" I said awkwardly. \"Who wants to go first?\" \"I'll do it,\" Craig volunteered. \"Craig. Alright,\" said Seth, and he held out the matches to him. \"Go ahead, brother.\" The rest of us stood there, barely daring to breathe loudly as Craig reached out and slowly pulled a match from the bunch. The tip was black. The guys all started fucking cheering about the fact it wasn't them, while I let out a quiet sigh of relief. No need to rub it in the poor guy's face. \"So sorry, Craig,\" Danny said insincerely, placing a hand on Craig's arm. \"There's a lot of guys in here that I wish it was instead of you,\" said James, not-so-subtly jerking his head in Danny's direction, who looked affronted. \"Wanna go best two out of three?\" Craig attempted, but of course no one took him up on that. Instead, we found him a long length of cord that we tied around his waist as a safety line. If there was any problems outside, we'd be able to pull him straight back into the house. \"If I tug, if I pull in any way, or if you hear me screaming, anything , you pull me right back in, alright?\" Craig instructed us as we tested how taut the rope would go. \"We'll try man, but you're pretty heavy,\" said Danny. \"What?\" said Craig. \"No, I mean, I'm saying I just don't think it's smart to make any guarantees.\" I'm sure Danny thought that this was an acceptable defence. He was wrong. \"Fuck no!\" Craig complained. \"You promise to pull me back in! You got me?\" \"Yeah, yeah, yeah,\" the guys all said. \"I promise, bro,\" I assured him. \"We're gonna do out best. You're gonna be safe.\" \"Alright,\" Craig said, sounding a little more relaxed. \"You wanna do a test run?\" I asked him. \"Yeah!\" \"You gotta scream,\" James told him. \"Let us hear the scream.\" He let out a scream and the other six of us pulled on the rope, dragging Craig forward a few feet. \"Everyone thank Craig for doing this,\" said Seth. \"Thank you, Craig,\" we chorused. Craig nodded and cautiously opened the door, checking his rope was tightly tied and slipping outside. \"It's getting smoky in here!\" Danny hissed. \"Go, go, go, go!\" He closed the door enough so that we could still pull the rope. We held the rope loosely in our hands, letting it move as Craig moved. We waited for a few minutes, listening to the sounds of crackling flames and crunching gravel outside. Suddenly, the rope started to move much quicker, scraping against our hands and causing Jonah to suddenly drop it, exclaiming, \"Rope burn!\" This was the same time the grazing pains got to all of us, and we all let go of the rope. \"Shit!\" I screeched, dropping to the floor in an attempt to grab the rope. All that happened was me smacking my face into the wood. The other guys had all tried to seize hold of it, but Craig was moving too fast, and the rope disappeared out the door. \"No, no, no, no, no, no!\" we all cried, looking outside into the opaque flaming smog. \"Oh my God, he's fucked!\" I groaned, looking outside in despair. \"Well, maybe he'll be okay,\" said Seth. \"Maybe there's nothing actually out there now.\" This was a theory that was totally shot down in flames when we heard Craig cry, \"Fellas, fellas! Pull me in! Pull the rope! Pull me in!\" \"We don't have the rope anymore!\" shouted Seth. \"We fucking dropped it! We're sorry!\" \"You've got the rope, man!\" yelled James. \"What?!\" Craig shrieked, and there was suddenly a deep, guttural growl, followed by Craig's blood-curdling scream. \"Craig!\" James shouted. \"What the fuck is yelling his name gonna do?!\" I bellowed at him. \"What the fuck do we do?!\" exclaimed Seth, before turning and yelling Craig's name some more. That was when Craig came barrelling through the door, still screaming. \"Are you okay?!\" Seth asked him hurriedly, clapping a hand on his back. \"What happened, man?!\" \"I don't know!\" he gasped out, panicked. \"There's something out there!\" There was another roar outside, and the something started pulling on the rope that was still attached to Craig. The force propelled Craig backwards, bringing Seth and Jay with him, and the three of them crashed into the door, landing in a heap on the floor. The seven of us all started screaming, trying to get the thing to release Craig, but whatever it was just kept pulling him, slamming the poor man's head against the door. We were pulling and pulling, but the thing had some serious strength to it. \"We gotta cut the rope off!\" I grunted, keeping a tight hold of Craig's hand and heaving. \"A knife!\" Jay shouted, holding his hand out. \"Somebody throw me a knife!\" The only people not trying to save Craig were Jonah and Danny, so Jonah said, \"I'll get it!\" and grabbed hold of a conveniently placed knife on the table. He didn't think to run over and hand it to someone. No. Instead, Jonah decided to literally throw it at Jay, and the knife buried itself an inch deep in Jay's thigh. He stared at the knife in horror, then let out a scream of pain. \"OMG! Jay! I'm so sorry, bro!\" Jonah apologised, raising his hands. \"What in the fuck, Jonah?!\" I screamed. \"Are you totally fucking blind?!\" And then, with absolutely no hesitation whatsoever, I reached over and ripped the knife clean out of Jay's leg, causing him to let out a fresh cry. \"Oh, grow a pair of balls, Jay! It's not that fucking bad!\" I quickly handed Craig the knife, and he started sawing through the rope as quickly as he could to our yells of, \"Cut it! Cut it! Cut it! Cut it!\" The rope snapped in two, and the sudden release of pressure sent the five of us on the floor sprawling down. I ended up collapsed across both Seth and Jay, who quickly pushed me off. \"God!\" shrieked James, slamming the door shut. \"What the fuck was that?!\" \"I don't know what the fuck that was,\" panted Craig. \"But I ain't going back out there.\" \"Craig, you didn't even get any of the water!\" exclaimed Danny, who had been hiding under the table the whole time. \"The door was fucked up!\" Craig retorted. \"Damn it, this is so frustrating!\" James spat, walking a few steps away. \"It's so close, but so far! The water, it's like, right underneath us!\" He stepped on to the concrete flooring and drew a square shape in the air with his fingers. \"Like, right there!\" Jay slowly raised his head. \"What do you mean, right underneath us?\" \"Like, literally, like, right there!\" James said, jabbing his hands at the floor. \"If you went right through the floor!\" Danny reached out and knocked four times on the concrete. The next thing we knew, Jay, Craig, Seth, Danny and I were sitting on the floor using screwdrivers and hammers to crack away at the concrete to make a hole down to the basement. \"You could help us, y'know!\" I snapped at James, wiping my sweaty forehead with the back of my hand. \"I'm supervising the destruction of my house!\" he retorted. We took the job in shifts over the next day or so. It was the only way to prevent us all arguing about who'd done however much work. The hole was now about seven inches deep and a metre wide, and Danny, Seth and I had all been smashing away at that concrete for a good hour or so into our shift when James suddenly started yelling about something. \"Who did this?\" The three of us looked up at James' open upper floor where he was standing. \"Who did this?\" \"Care to enlighten us on what 'this' is?\" I asked him, dropping the bit of chair leg I'd been using as a hammer. \"What are you talking about?\" questioned Seth. James held something up, and I only vaguely registered that it was that fucking porno mag the guys were all obsessed with. \"Jizzed all over the pages of this nice magazine I was nice enough to tell you about!\" \"Well for obvious reasons I'm just gonna state that it clearly was not me,\" I said, raising my hands. \"Was it you, Seth?\" James demanded. \"No,\" Seth replied, looking confused. \"It was me, Franco,\" Danny said, more aggressively than what was probably needed. \"I fucking made jizz in your magazine.\" \"Why?!\" James yelled. \"When I fucking jack off long enough, I end up jizzing, dude!\" Danny retorted. \"I'm assuming the same shit works for you!\" \"Real fucking smart answer!\" James exploded. \"Why don't you fucking aim, huh?!\" \"I have a particularly explosive ejaculate!\" Danny shouted. \"It just goes everywhere! It's like a fucking wild fireman's hose!\" He saw fit to add gestures here. \"You just gotta hold on and pray to God that it doesn't get into your eyes or your mouth!\" By this point, everything had just gotten way, way too ridiculous for me. I was bent double with laughter, tears streaming from my eyes, struggling to breathe. Is this really what we had resorted to: arguing about cum in a magazine? \"I don't know why you're fucking laughing, Kenzie!\" James said angrily. \"Look!\" He brandished the magazine down at us, and I saw myself grinning back on the page. Oh my actual fucking God, it was one of my Victoria's Secret adverts. \"Danny!\" I yelled, kicking him roughly in the shin. \"That is fucking disgusting, dude! Have a little class!\" \"Mackenzie, this is in no way an insult to you,\" Danny replied patronizingly. \"You should feel complimented that you're aesthetically pleasing to the opposite sex.\" \"Yeah, I'm just sooo complimented that you made your dick explode all over a picture of me!\" I snapped. \"The fuck kinda jerking of is that?!\" James shouted. \"What, you never had any brothers? You didn't learn to jizz in a fucking sock or on a fucking tissue?!\" \"No, I don't have any brothers!\" Danny shouted back. \"I was raised in a house of women!\" \"I highly doubt they fucking taught you to fucking close your eyes and fucking cum wherever you want!\" James screeched. \"Yeah, thanks for that, Franco,\" I said, wrinkling my nose in distaste. \"Nice to know what your and Dave's teenage years consisted of.\" \"You're getting all worked up over a fucking porno mag!\" Danny yelled. \"Who has goddamn porno mags any more!? Welcome to the twenty-first century, Buck Rogers! You designed a house with fucking iPads in the walls, yet you're jerking your dick like a goddamn pilgrim!\" \"That's right, man! I like to fucking read!\" James retorted. Seth and I had literally no idea how to respond to most of this argument; we'd occasionally make eye contact which we'd immediately break to avoid bursting into laughter. \"You think that's the only thing I jerked off in here?!\" Danny shouted maliciously. \"I've been dropping loads around this fucking house like a goddamn dump truck!\" \"You don't cum on my stuff!\" James screamed. \"I'll come wherever the fuck I want, James!\" Danny stated angrily. \"I'll fucking cum in your kitchen, I'll cum on your fucking art, I'll cum anywhere I want!\" \"I will fucking cum right on you!\" James hollered, making violent jerk-off gestures at Danny. \"I will cum like a fucking madman all over you, McBride!\" \"I fucking wish you'd cum on me right now!\" Danny snapped. \"I fucking dare you to cum on me!\" \"Guys! There are less embarrassing ways to settle-!\" I began as both of them started making even more violent gestures at one another, but I was interrupted by Danny. Of course. \"I'm gonna jack my dick so fucking hard in here!\" he grunted, 'jerking off' the baseball bat between his legs. \"This!\" James made another jack off gesture. \"No more, man. All over your fucking face!\" I tuned out at that point. This entire argument had surpassed ridiculous and ventured into the land of Just Plain Fucking Stupid. Danny, however, was just not gonna shut up. \"I'll cum on these walls! I'll cum on the fucking cabinets! On the fucking furniture! I'll cum everywhere!\" \"If I see your dick one more time, I'm gonna fucking shoot it off!\" James hissed, jabbing his gun at Danny. \"You don't have enough bullets, bitch!\" Danny shouted. \"No fucking jerking off in my house, McBride!\" And with that, James stormed off in the general direction of his bedroom. Danny furiously threw his bat down, and a metallic clang rang out. \"Fuck this!\" \"Come on, man,\" I said. \"I'm just…I'm too thirsty to do this!\" he said irately. \"And the fucking bitter irony is I'm not gonna have my thirst quenched until I finish this! Goddamn it, I hate it!\" Danny started storming off too. \"Danny, no!\" Seth said in the most authoritive tone he possessed. \"Don't walk away! Danny, don't walk away from me!\" \"It's too late, Seth!\" Danny insisted, not turning around. \"I've already walked away too much!\" \"Er, no you haven't!\" I exclaimed. \"Turn around now and it's the same fucking distance! Come back and help us!\" \"Danny!\" Seth shouted. \"Daniel!\" But Danny had disappeared around the corner. \"For fuck sake!\" I growled, kicking the inside of the hole and instantly regretting it as pain shot up my toes. So Seth and I got back to work. For another hour we stood there, uselessly whacking away at the floor to no avail. To be honest, we had little to no strength left. We were so tired, and we were so thirsty. There was nothing left in our systems to physically give us strength. \"Need a hand?\" asked Jay, suddenly popping up from nowhere. \"Dude, you would be a lifesaver,\" I said gratefully. \"But your shift just ended, man,\" said Seth guiltily. \"You don't have to help us if you don't want to.\" \"The fuck else am I doing?\" Jay asked rhetorically. \"Well then, we seriously appreciate this,\" I said, handing him the baseball bat. \"Thank you.\" So then all three of us were pounding away at the concrete, chipping off little bits of the floor at the time. \"I don't know what I'm thinking of this,\" Jay said suddenly. \"But remember that time that I got you a fucking Taco Bell gift certificate for like, twenty bucks, and I bet you that you couldn't eat all of that in one sitting.\" \"I do remember that! I remember thinking,\" Seth said reminiscently. \"'How much food could twenty dollars possibly buy you at Taco Bell?' And the answer is infinite.\" \"I wanna hear this story!\" I piped up, curious. \"We went to see fucking Gladiator ,\" Jay told me. \"And Seth here sharted midway through the movie.\" \"Oh my God, what ?!\" I said, my jaw dropping. \"That's fucking gnarly!\" \"I did, though,\" Seth laughed. \"Due to the tigers' appearance,\" added Jay. \"I got scared of the tigers,\" Seth said. \"Literally, when the second tiger came out, I went-\" Seth gasped exaggeratedly followed by a plopping noise. \"-and then I shat. I shat in the theatre.\" Both of them dissolved into reminiscent laughter. \"Dude. That's more than a little-\" I started to say, and that was when the floor collapsed underneath us.

Chapter Nine- I Wanna Kick Your Teeth In Jayden had never had people look at her. She'd never felt the sensation of dozens of pairs of eyes settling on her before. But now, strolling through the campus with Shelley and the girls, decked out in her new clothes and her make-up and her hair extensions, all eyes were on her. On all of them. Most of them male eyes, which was a first as well. Jayden squirmed a little under the gazes; she wasn't sure that she liked this at all. \" Wow,\" breathed out Natalie. \"So this is what it feels like to not be invisible.\" \" Apparently so,\" said Jayden. \"I don't think I like this. People are staring at my ass! My skirt is too short, isn't it?!\" \" You look fine, Jayd. We weren't exactly invisible before, anyway,\" said Harmony. \"Just the anti-hot.\" \" Check out Joanne!\" Natalie exclaimed, looking round Jayden at the girl decked out her newly blinged-up spinal brace. \"I really like what you've done with the Bedazzler.\" Joanne smiled. \"Thank you.\" \" It looks awesome,\" agreed Jayden. \"Maybe I'll borrow it for my retainer.\" \" So what's next, Shelley?\" Joanne asked their house-mother. \" I want all the fraternities to see how hot you guys are!\" Shelley replied enthusiastically. \"Kinda like a coming-out party! So, we are gonna take some pictures!\" \" We are not posing for Playboy !\" scoffed Mona. \" No, in a calendar!\" Shelley told us. \"'The Girls of Zeta!' Everyone will see the new you, and selling the calendars will help us raise money for our phil-an-coppopopy!\" Joanne's phone suddenly bleeted. \"Hey you guys, Lilly just texted me,\" she said. \"She says, we look hot, and, this is fun.\" \" This is so not my definition of fun,\" Jayden mumbled, looking awkwardly at the ground. Something else that wasn't her definition of fun was getting ready for their calendar shoot. While she really appreciated what Shelley was doing for them, she felt so overexposed. She had never, ever been comfortable with her appearance, and parading around campus dressed, in Jayden's opinion, like a hooker really was not helping her confidence at all. But here she stood, dressed like a sexy bunny rabbit, turning and pouting and smiling in front of a garden backdrop for the April calendar shot. Natalie was behind the camera, trying to psych Jayden up, telling her it was okay and how hot she looked, but the truth was she just felt cheap. She tried smiling again, tried to pout, tried to look seductive, but all the power to fake it had drained out of her. She'd never felt so paranoid about herself before. Abruptly, she stopped all her posing and just drooped slightly, dithering there in the middle of the room. \" Come on, Jayden,\" Natalie twittered, clicking the camera. \"You look smokin'! It's like you're on fire! Well, not literally because then the alarms would be going off and we'd have to go through all the fire procedure…\" \" Natalie!\" Jayden interrupted. \"Can you…can you not? I feel stupid enough in this outfit as it is.\" \" No, no, no! Jayden!\" That was Shelley, hurrying into the room, looking concerned. \"You don't look stupid! You look amazing! You look like a Playboy bunny!\" \" I don't want to look like a Playboy bunny!\" Jayden grumbled. \"I hate this! I feel like a prostitute!\" \" Jayden!\" gasped Natalie. \" What? I do! I can't cope showing off so much skin! I can't do it anymore! I can't!\" Jayden reached up and tore the satin rabbit ears off her head, dropping them to the floor. \"I just feel so uncomfortable! I'd rather just go back to being invisible all the time than have all these dirty little boys staring at me because they can see my ass hanging out of the bottom of my shorts!\" And with that, she pushed her way passed Natalie and Shelley and stormed up the stairs. A few moments later, they heard her bedroom door slam shut. -The House Bunny, 2008 The three of us crashed down on the basement floor, landing on our asses with debris collapsing around us. Pain exploded up my spine as I cracked down on my back with a cry. \"You guys okay?!\" came James' frightened yell, and he and Craig appeared at the mouth of the hole. \"Oh, fuck me!\" I groaned, rolling on to my front. \"I think I just broke my ass bone.\" \"Yeah? Well I think I broke my ass in half ,\" moaned Seth. Jay was just lying there, groaning in the background. \"Shit, they got through!\" James called, and Danny appeared too. \"You guys fucking did it!\" he said appraisingly at the same time James exclaimed, \"Oh my God!\" \"Fuck, did that hurt?\" asked Craig. \"Oh, no. We're right as fucking rain,\" I said sardonically. \"I only might have a busted spine!\" \"Yes, it fucking hurt!\" spat Seth. \"I loosened this up for you,\" said Danny. \"I'll have you know.\" \"Danny, do not start that shit with me or I'll come up there and drop-kick you in the mouth!\" I warned, glaring up at him. \"Okay, just shut up!\" said Seth as the three of us stood up and dusted ourselves down, cracked our backs and whatnot. \"It's fucking dark down here…\" \"Hold on, hold on!\" piped up Craig, and he started rummaging around in his pockets. He pulled something out and handed it down to us, Seth taking whatever it was from him. \"Nice!\" said James. The thing in Seth's hand lit up, shining directly in Jay's face. \"What is this?\" I asked, frowning at the brown fabric thing. \"That's Terrence Peterson,\" Craig replied. \"My monkey flashlight keychain.\" \"Monkey flashlight keychain?\" repeated Seth, and Craig nodded. \"What's his name?\" \"Terrence Peterson,\" Craig answered proudly. \"You see it, Seth?\" James asked in reference to the water, the reason we were underground in the first place. \"No,\" Seth replied, shining the monkey around the space we were in. \"Are you sure it's even down here?\" \"Er…\" James thought for a second. \"Not sure.\" \"NOT SURE?!\" I yelled. \"Are you fucking kidding me, Franco?! If we've gone through all this effort and there is no water down here, I'm killing you so we can drink your blood! Capiche?!\" \"Chill out, Kenzie,\" he said, rolling his eyes. \"There's like a fucking ninety percent chance of water being there.\" \"Hey, is there any weird shit down here?\" asked Jay as the three of us began to move further into the basement. \"Nah, it's where I keep all my stuff from my old movies,\" James answered. \"Costumes, props.\" Seth was right; even with Terrence Peterson the Monkey Flashlight Keychain, it was fucking dark down here. Wherever the torch beam didn't hit, it was just pitch black. It was also freaking cold, too. As we shone the light around, we came across a promo poster for Pineapple Express , some more baseball bats and the fake severed arm from 127 Hours . Then Seth turned around, and the beam illuminated something big and man-shaped. The three of us shrieked, and Jay whacked the figure with his bat. That was when we realised it was just a fucking cardboard cut-out. \"What?!\" shouted James. \"Is someone down there!?\" Danny called. \"It's your fucking stupid cut-out from Spider-Man …\" Seth thought for a second. \" 3 ! Jesus Christ.\" \"Urgh.\" I shivered. \"I had nightmares for about a week after seeing your fucked-up face in that, Franco.\" I neglected to mention how I'd had to stop myself cheering in the cinema when Harry Osborn died. I'd never hated a comic movie character quite so much. \"Hey!\" I said suddenly, pointing. \"I think I've found it! Look!\" Seth turned the light beam, and it illuminated two full ten-litre water bottles. \"There it is!\" exclaimed Jay. \"Yes! Yeah!\" cheered Seth. \"We fucking did it!\" I cried. \"Fuck yes !\" \"What, did you find it?!\" called James. \"YEAH!\" Jay, Seth and I all shouted back, dancing around in a circle with the monkey light going all strobe-ish between us. We'd done it. We'd found the water. We were gonna live. We were gonna be okay. James, Danny and Craig helped us and the bottles out of the hole. As soon as we were out, we were cheering and dancing and just generally starting to act sane again. James grabbed seven cocktail glasses and we all sat down around the dining table to a celebratory bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch and a gloriously full glass of water each. \"Water!\" we toasted, clinking glasses and taking sips. \"That is so fucking good ,\" praised Seth. \"The three heroes over here,\" commended James, gesturing at Seth, Jay and me. \"Breaking through the floor.\" The three of us pretended to act sheepish. \"We did break through the floor,\" said Seth, high-fiving Jay, who turned and then high-fived me. \"Any of you guys would have done the same thing,\" said Jay. \"And I'm sure I'll regain the use of my spine soon,\" I said light-heartedly. \"Just remember that: I gave up my health so you guys wouldn't die of dehydration.\" \"Oh man, that did fucking hurt,\" agreed Seth. \"Yeah, I'm surprised you didn't shart again,\" commented Jay. \"I think I did,\" replied Seth, and I laughed. \"Definitely wouldn't surprise me, Rogen. Have you checked for fudge puddles?\" \"Hey, what year is this?\" joked Jonah, opening the ketchup and smelling it. \"19…\" \"That's a good…that's a good year,\" quipped Seth, and the rest of us began laughing until we saw that Danny had gotten out of his seat and was starting to pour another glass of water. \"Hey, hey! Yo, yo, yo!\" we all shouted in protest. \"Woah, woah!\" \"What are you doing?!\" demanded Seth. \"What am I doing?\" Danny said innocently, and the water sloshed out of the bottle into his glasses, splashing over the sides. We all yelled out again. \"I'm just pouring myself another glass of water to wash down that dry-ass Cinnamon Toast Crunch.\" \"That's very nice, but you can't just pour yourself another glass of water, man!\" James exclaimed furiously. \"Will you cut it out?!\" \"One glass at dinner!\" I shouted. \"That's what we fucking said, McBride! One. Fucking. Glass .\" \"We agreed to one glass at dinner,\" Seth backed me up. \"We voted on it, man!\" \"Well man, I'm just getting sick and tired of all these fucking rules, man,\" retorted Danny. \"You don't see me putting rules on you guys.\" \"You cannot have another glass of water!\" James asserted. \"Jay weighs a hundred and fifty pounds less than me!\" Danny pointed out. \"Mack weighs even less! Why the fuck is it fair that they and I should drink the same amount of water? We should be dividing our rations based on our proportionate size.\" \"There's no need to start making all this personal, Danny!\" I said heatedly. \"I don't want to come off as a diva here or anything,\" chipped in Jonah. \"It's just that I think everyone should split everything equally.\" \"See?\" I said, pointing at Jonah. \"He knows what's up.\" \" I just think that everyone should have the fucking same ,\" Danny imitated Jonah cruelly, taking on a camp, high-pitched tone. \" I have a goddamn earring . Shut the fuck up, Jonah!\" \"Hey!\" I shouted angrily, standing up in my righteous indignation. \"Don't fucking talk to him like that, you cunt-face, or I swear to God, you're gonna be missing an eyeball soon!\" \"Mack, calm down!\" James said, and Jay took my arm and forcibly made me sit back down. \"You know what, Danny?\" James continued. \"If you weren't jizzing all the time, maybe you'd be more hydrated!\" \"You're making me into a joker right now, Franco, and you are not gonna like the fucking punch line!\" Danny warned him. \"No more jerking off, no more water!\" James stated. \"Just sit the fuck down!\" Danny appeared to actually back down. \"Okay. I'm done. We're not gonna have any more water.\" But the next thing we knew, he'd turned and seized hold of the open water container, pouring it into his mouth and over his head. The rest of us were up in a flash, wrestling with Danny and trying to get him to release the bottle. There was screaming; just so much screaming. The water was flying everywhere, drenching us all. The extremely minor- and I do mean extremely minor- perk was that it was the first shower any of us had had in days. By the end of it, I resembled the type of woman you only ever saw in Ibiza during Spring Break when it was Wet T-Shirt Competition time. James had dragged Danny away from us, and Seth salvaged what little water was left in the container: all three inches of it. \"You guys made this happen!\" Danny screamed. \"You guys forced my fucking hand by ganging up on me!\" \"If you weren't acting like a prick then there wouldn't be any need to gang up on you, goddamn it!\" I roared, absolutely livid, not to mention soaked to the bone. \"Goddamn it, I'm gonna fucking kill this motherfucker!\" screeched James, brandishing his revolver at Danny at point-blank range. What none of us expected, however, was Danny to turn and place the barrel of the gun in his own mouth. When James didn't pull the trigger, Danny wrenched it from his mouth. \"That's what I thought. Nerd,\" he spat, storming away. After that, Danny only got worse. He stole James' tuxedo and wore it around the house. He drank the remaining water in the open bottle. He ate a shit-ton of our remaining food. And finally, he passed out in front of the fireplace, snoring up a storm, the fucker. \"Alright guys,\" whispered James, as the rest of us stood around just staring at Danny's unconscious form. \"Let's get rid of him.\" \"What?\" hissed Seth. \"What do you mean? Like, kick him out of the house?\" \"Seems a little drastic, doesn't it?\" I muttered. \"His fucking reckless behaviour is dragging us all down!\" James replied. \"I mean, he wasted our water twice!\" He held up his fingers for emphasis. \"Two times! Two times!\" \"Dan is under a lot of pressure, okay?\" Jonah said quietly. \"And he's not handling it as good as the rest of us are.\" \"Look at him He's wearing my fucking tuxedo!\" James hissed. \"He's been eating non-stop! The fucker's gained weight since he got here! The fucker's gots to go! Go ! The fucker's gots to go !\" \"Alright, fine,\" I sighed. \"Fuck McBride. Let's get him up and out.\" So that's what we did. We abruptly jolted Danny out of his Sleeping Beauty routine, sat the man down and told him it was time to nut up or shut up. And by 'nut up' we meant 'get the fuck out of the house.' \"Is this how you all feel?\" Danny asked us dolefully. \"We talked about it,\" Jay said quietly. \"You guys are gonna vote me off the island?\" Shit, I'd never heard Danny so dejected before. \"I mean, I made you guys breakfast.\" \"Shit man, you wasted half of our food when you did that!\" grumbled James. \"Just thought I was doing something nice for you guys,\" Danny replied gloomily. \"Just to apologise for my behaviour at the party.\" He looked at his lap. \"A party I wasn't even invited to.\" I felt something stir in my chest then; something that felt like…pity. Fuck. No. Stop it, Mack. Do not feel sorry for this asswipe. Do NOT. He pretty much signed your death warrant when he wasted all the water. I had to listen to my subconscious. \"I'm not an idiot,\" Danny continued, so melancholy. \"I know why you guys don't fucking call me or hang out with me anymore. It's because I party so fucking hard. Always have. Ever since I was a baby. I wouldn't just suck on my momma's titties. I would fucking…bang 'em, and motorboat 'em.\" \"We are getting fucking sidetracked here,\" I said loudly. \"Everything I've been doing has just been a cry for help,\" Danny said wretchedly. \"When I came on your magazine, James, and on your face, Mackenzie-\" This was met by a chorus of \"URGH\"s from the other guys. \"He means my picture!\" I said hastily. \"It was a cum for help,\" Danny carried on. \"I've just been crying and cumming, and crying and cumming…tears from the tip of my penis, dude.\" I looked around at the others. Fuck no, they all looked like they believed Danny's fucking crocodile tears! That last part had vanquished any form of sorrow I felt for Danny: it was all bullshit so we'd let him stay! \"I'm sorry, alright?\" James croaked, sounding on the verge of tears. \"You can cum wherever you want.\" \"I don't even care about cumming anymore,\" Danny said desolately. \"Right now, I'm just kinda into going.\" He stood up, ignoring the guys saying his name. They all got up and went after him, apologising as they did so. I followed, but I kept my mouth firmly shut. \"Let's just discuss it some more, okay?\" suggested James. \"Yeah, let's just talk, dude,\" agreed Seth. \"We're giving you an option. It's a choice, man!\" \"There's nothing to figure out, alright?\" Danny affirmed. \"You guys have said enough, and there's no going back anymore. I don't know if there maybe is, like, something you guys could give me so I could at least have some sort of protection while I'm out there?\" \"Danny, you don't have to do this,\" Craig told him gently. \"Alright, if you're really leaving,\" said James. \"Then you should take this.\" He held out Old Faithful. \"Really?\" said Danny. \"You don't know what's out there,\" James replied, way too dramatically. Danny took the gun. \"Thank you, James. It means a lot to you, and I appreciate that you'd give this to me, you stupid…stupid motherfucker!\" These last four words suddenly built in crescendo, and before I knew what was happening there was the sound of six shots being fired. I screamed so loudly it felt like my tonsils would explode. I thought I was going to die. The boys around me were all clutching at their hearts, at their guts, checking for bullet wounds. It soon became blatantly obvious that no one had been shot; the gun had been loaded with blanks. \"Fucking psychopath!\" spat James, pulling the revolver from Danny's hand. \"It's a prop gun! What, do you think I'd put real bullets in here?!\" \"You were gonna send me out there with a fucking gun filled with blanks!?\" Danny demanded angrily. \"Fuck you!\" exclaimed Seth furiously. \"Don't turn this around on us! You just tried to shoot us, you fucking dickhead!\" We all let rip with angry outbursts. 'Psychopath,' 'cockface' and 'fucking murdering motherfucker' were thrown about a lot. \"Whatever!\" Danny spat out. \"Fucking civilisation is broken down. There's no more reason for this false bullshit! You guys act like you're so fucking high and mighty, like you never made a goddamn mistake before! Franco, you're some pretentious fucking nerd!\" \"Fuck you!\" James retorted. \"And Jonah,\" Danny sneered. \"You fucking cunt.\" Jonah just looked trodden down and stepped on. \"Craig.\" Now Danny turned to his wingman. \"You didn't have my back, back there. You fucking disappoint me.\" \"Bro,\" Craig said sadly. \"And Seth.\" Danny settled on the man standing next to me. \"You duplicitous taint.\" \"What?!\" Seth exclaimed indignantly. \"Then of course, there's Jay,\" Danny jeered. \"The self-righteous, cock-sucking, two-faced backstabber.\" \"What the fuck are you talking about?!\" Jay demanded. \"I overheard your little conversation with Craig, alright?\" Danny revealed. \"The only reason why you care about any of us is because you think it's what God wants you to do. You don't give a shit about us!\" \"No, no, no, no, that's fucking twisting that shit,\" Jay insisted. He looked at Danny. \"You're fucking lying!\" \"Am I twisting this ?\" Danny demanded. \"I believe you were in Los Angeles two months ago, at the Four Seasons.\" My face blanched. Don't. Please, Danny…don't… \"I saw you there, and you specifically asked me not to tell Seth, so that you could maintain the illusion that you always stay with Seth when you're in Los Angeles.\" \"Oooh,\" drew out Craig. \"Jay!\" \"The fuck, man?!\" said Seth, looking angry. \"It's not…\" began Jay. \"It's…\" \"Textbook twattage,\" finished Danny, making a book-shape with his hands. \"But that isn't all, kiddies. No, no, no.\" Now his eyes settled on me, glinting with malice. \"Don't,\" I whispered, my eyes welling up because I knew exactly what he was going to say. \"Danny…please just don't. I'm begging you.\" \"Danny, what the fuck are you talking about now?\" James asked irately. \"Now Franco, this one may interest you the most,\" Danny said nonchalantly. \"Because who did I see leaving the Four Seasons that day with Jay, but our very own Kenzie Bolton.\" \"Wait, you knew he was here?\" Seth demanded of me, and all I could do was stand there and gasp out a few apologetic noises. Danny barked out a sadistic laugh. \"Oh-ho, she knew real good. Tell me Kenzie, did you think about your boyfriend at all when you were fucking Jay?\" A/N- Dun dun duuuunnn! Talk about plot twist!

Chapter Ten- Her Friends Are All Gone \" Please state your name and the role you are auditioning for.\" \"Mackenzie Juliette Bolton, final screen test for the role of Faith.\" Harmony Korine smiled at her and said, \"Okay, Mackenzie, this is just a test to see how well you work with James and to see your take on Faith's personality. Alright?\" \" Yeah, sounds good to me,\" Mackenzie replied, smiling, but the smile quickly turned into a frown. \"Wait a second. Where is James?\" \" Right here, y'all,\" came a drawling Southern voice from the door. Mackenzie turned, and burst out into hysterical laughter. \"Franco! What- what- what-!\" She couldn't even speak, she was laughing so hard. James grinned at her and actually came into the room. He was decked out in his full Alien costume: tacky Hawaiian shirt, surf shorts, flip-flops, cornrows and grillz on his teeth. Mackenzie doubled over, desperately trying to regain composure and look professional, but she just couldn't. \" What are you wearing ?!\" she managed to splutter out. \" Hey!\" he said indignantly, in his normal voice. \"I'm not the one who looks like a fucking prostitute!\" He gestured at her orange bikini top and turquoise bottoms. \" No. You just look like a discount pimp!\" she informed him, but she reached up and gave him a hug. \"Bro, I'm nervous.\" \" Don't be. You're gonna be awesome\" he assured her. \" Well, I do try,\" she joked, tucking her hair behind her ear. She clapped her hands once and rubbed them together. \"So, we ready to do this?\" \" Absolutely,\" said Harmony, stepping back. \"So, Mackenzie, we're doing the pool hall scene. You're miles from home. You're scared, you're alone and you're panicking. You don't want Alien talking to you like this, and you want to make that clear. Let's go. Action.\" James took Mackenzie's arm and gently pulled her into the centre of the room. He released her and folded his arms, looking concerned. \"You alright?\" he asked in his pre-established Alien voice. \"What's wrong?\" Mackenzie sniffed like she'd been crying, wiping her eyes with the side of her hand. \"I just…I want to go home.\" \" Why? You upset?\" \" I don't like it here,\" she said quietly. \" So what's wrong?\" he asked. \" This isn't why we came here,\" she replied. \" Why'd you come here?\" he questioned. Mackenzie sighed. \"I don't like where we're from so I thought that if we came here we could…\" She shrugged. \"Be free or...just have fun.\" \" Okay. Ain't that what we're doin'? Havin' fun?\" \" No.\" \" What kinda 'fun' did you wanna have?\" Mackenzie shivered slightly; James was actually beginning to creep her out a little bit. \" Um…\" she faltered, temporarily forgetting her line. \"Oh! Sorry! Not going to jail.\" she continued in the softer voice she had adopted for Faith. \" Well, you're outta jail now. I didn't put you in jail, I got you outta jail,\" he told her, smirking and flashing the metal on his teeth. Mackenzie couldn't help it- she started laughing again. \" I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!\" she giggled. \"It's the teeth, man! It's the teeth! They're so bad!\" \" Come on, Mack, you had this!\" said James, looking vaguely irritated with her. \" Right. Yeah. Sorry.\" She cleared her throat. \"I don't know you,\" she said in a harder tone. James nodded once. \"Alright. And?\" \" I don't know what you want with me and my friends but you should leave us alone,\" she asserted, glaring at him and folding her arms. \" I'm just tryna be nice,\" James said innocently. \" I don't know you,\" she said again, but her resolved tenor crumpled slightly. \" Alright. I'll tell you what,\" James said quietly, moving closer to her so he was just a couple of inches away from her face. \"I like you.\" He reached up and caressed her cheek, which Mackenzie bit the inside of to stop herself laughing again. \" I like you,\" he repeated. \"I ain't gon' do nothin' to hurt you. Don't you see that? If you wanna go home, you can go home. But then you just gon' be home. You gon' be back right where you started.\" As James continued stroking her cheek, Mackenzie started to make sniffling noises like she was on the verge of tears again. \" You gonna be thinkin',\" he continued. \"'Hm. Maybe I missed somethin' out there.'\" Mackenzie shook her head, looking down as real tears began to leak from her eyes. \" You wanna go?\" James asked, continuing his assault on her face. She nodded. \"Why?\" He briefly moved his hand to cup her chin. \"Why? Why you so upset? Nothin's wrong. Nothin's wrong.\" \" I. Want. To. Go. Home,\" she said through gritted teeth, then instantly regretted it; Faith's character didn't get angry, she just fucking cried all the time. \" I know,\" James soothed. \"You can.\" He moved his thumb gently over her mouth, tracing her lips, and she had to resist the urge to bite him. \"But goddamn, I like you so much.\" Mackenzie lowered her head again, pretending to burst into silent tears. \"Listen to me. You're gonna go, but your friends are gonna stay. Your friends are gonna stay with me. But I want you to know that I like you so much . But your friends ain't gonna go with you.\" James paused, but carried on stroking her face. \"And I'm gonna be thinkin' of you when I'm with your friends.\" Mackenzie pulled her face from James' grip and pushed past him, wiping her eyes on her hands and sniffing angrily. \" Cut!\" called Harmony. -Mackenzie Bolton's 'Spring Breakers' audition, 2012 Silence. Deadly, disgusting silence. That's all there was. Nobody moved. Nobody spoke. Nobody breathed. They were all just…staring. Staring between me and Jay. I was horrified; I just couldn't comprehend the fact that Danny had said this. He was looking at me now, and his face was etched with cruel joy. That was when I snapped. \"You fat, ugly motherfucker! I can't fucking believe you could do that to me!\" I screeched, throwing myself at him. I was kicking him and punching him and clawing at him with what was left of my bitten and broken nails. I was screaming all sorts of obscenities at him, practically trying to gouge the man's eyes out as I did so. \"You've fucking ruined everything!\" \"Mack, fucking cut it out!\" Danny cried, shielding his face with his arms. \"I'm gonna fucking kill you!\" I roared, and that's when a pair of hands seized the tops of my arms and forcibly extracted me from murdering McBride. I thrashed against the grip, turning around to face my assailant. I found myself looking directly into James' eyes. Oh, fuck. \"What the fuck is McBride talking about?\" he questioned fiercely. \"James, I-\" I croaked. \"Is it true?\" \"James, please, I don't-\" \"Kenzie! Is. It. True?\" He shook me slightly. \"I- yes.\" I nodded slowly, a solitary tear trickling down my face. \"Okay? Yes. He's telling the truth.\" \"You mean you guys actually had sex?\" Seth exclaimed disbelievingly. \"What the fuck ?\" \"You fucking cheated on my brother?\" James spat at me, and he abruptly released me, causing me to stumble back a few steps. \"It didn't mean anything, okay!\" Jay was quick to defend us, pulling me away from the group. We both stood there as James, Seth, Jonah and Craig all gaped at us. I could see the judgement in their eyes. I hated it. Danny was in the background, just smirking. I hated him. \"It was a mistake!\" I bawled, bursting into tears. \"We…we never, ever intended it to happen!\" \"So why the fuck did it happen, then?\" I had never seen James look so angry before. \"We were wasted!\" Jay said, putting his arm around me as I stood there howling, tears and snot dribbling attractively down my face. \"Dave had been away for a week promoting one of his movies,\" I sobbed, gulping in an attempt to catch my breath. \"And it was the anniversary of the day my mom died, nine years ago. I was…I was feeling so miserable that I'd just been drinking all day. Whiskey, vodka, scotch, brandy; you name it, I'd been drinking it since ten that morning. I was just crying and drinking, and Jay called me up to surprise me. All I was doing was crying down the phone at him, so-\" I dissolved into even uglier sobs, losing the ability to form a coherent sentence. \"So I asked her to come and see me,\" Jay continued for me. \"I didn't know how drunk she was until she actually got out of her cab and fell into the doorman.\" \"We…we went up to Jay's suite,\" I snivelled. \"We had a few more drinks…and then…it was all just moving in the very wrong direction…and the next thing we knew…it was morning, and it had happened.\" They were still all just looking. \"Fuck, guys, it isn't like we wanted to do it!\" Jay snapped, but he looked so guilty. So ashamed. \"But you fucking did!\" said Seth. \"Both of you fucking lied.\" \"You don't think we don't know that?\" I said angrily. \"I… hate myself for what we did!\" \"Does Dave know?\" demanded James. I shook my head, unable to even make eye contact with him. \"Wow. I had no idea you could be such a fucking heartless bitch, Mackenzie.\" Mackenzie. Not Kenzie. Not Mack. Mackenzie. James never, ever used my whole name. No one did. Not unless they were well and truly pissed with me. And right now, from the look on James' face, he had surpassed 'pissed at me' a very long time ago. Right now, I'd put a wager closer to he hated me. \"Don't fucking talk to her like that, Franco!\" Jay said protectively. \"You're just as fucking bad, Jay!\" said Seth, pointing an accusing finger at him. \"I hope you're fucking happy now, Danny,\" I snarled. \"I could not be fucking happier if I tried, my beautiful little Kenz,\" he taunted. \"Oh, and by the way, just for the record, I'm choosing to leave now. You're not kicking me out. You guys had already said that I could come back in, and I'm the one that said I'm not coming back in.\" He half-turned around and opened the door. \"Don't be cocky.\" And with that, he backed away into the dense smog outside, flipping us off with both hands until he disappeared. \"Get the fuck out of here,\" James spat, slamming the door shut. Seth turned to Jay and I. \"So this really is all true?\" Jay hesitated for a moment. \"Yes.\" \"Jay? Mackenzie?\" Jonah suddenly piped up after being silent this whole time, and we both turned to look at him. \"I know this is probably my fault since I put Jay on a pedestal, but you should not be dishonest with your friends and cheat on your boyfriend. You really let me down.\" My eyes dropped to the floor, and I watched as my tears splashed on the hardwood. That had been the last thing I wanted to hear someone say. Jay, however, reacted in a slightly different way. He pulled his arm back and let it snap forward, punching Jonah clean in the jaw. \"Jay!\" I shrieked. \"What the fuck, man?!\" Seth just glared at us, before turning on his heel and walking off. \"It's all fucked, isn't it?\" Jay grumbled, looking at his bleeding knuckles before he too stalked away. \"Jonah, you okay?\" James asked him. Jonah took a deep breath, like he was breathing through the pain. \"Yeah. His insides hurt worse than my outsides.\" \"James, can I talk-\" I began, but he just glowered at me. \"No,\" he snapped. \"I'm sorry Mackenzie, but I just don't want to talk to you.\" He, Craig and Jonah soon dispersed after that so they could go to bed, leaving me on my own in the middle of the room. \"I'm so sorry,\" I whispered into the emptiness. Needless to say, I cried myself to near-sleep that night. This was the very worst I'd felt throughout the entire of the apocalypse, and that really was saying something. The atmosphere in the house was just so…so hateful . James refused to speak to me, Seth refused to speak to Jay, Jonah and Craig didn't know how in the fuck to respond to what was going on, and I just felt so goddamn alone. I tossed and turned on the sofa, cocooned up in my duvet. The boys were all asleep in their rooms, dick tents or sofa dens. Jay and I were still in the living room. He was fast asleep; he was fine. I was the one who felt like she was trapped in perdition, never to be raised from. I rubbed furiously at my heavy eyes, just praying for sleep to come. I just wanted today to be over. I could try to deal with the fallout in the morning. But of course, God wanted to punish me just that little bit more, so sleep was just not gonna happen. I looked at my phone, which was clinging on to its last ten percent of battery. 3.33am. Jesus fucking Christ… A sudden male scream echoed from upstairs. \"No!\" Shit! It sounded like Jonah! I jumped up and over the back of the sofa, stumbling slightly as I lunged for the stairs. I could hear scuffling noises coming from his bedroom, but they were muffled. What was going on?! I burst into the room, shouting, \"Jonah!\" He was sitting in the middle of his bed, his duvets all twisted up around him. His face was totally ashen, and he was panting like he'd been running a marathon. \"Bro, what the fuck happened?!\" \"I…it…I…nothing,\" he said quickly, drawing his covers up tighter around him. I frowned. \"Are you okay, man? You look kinda sick.\" \"I just had a bad dream,\" he replied, not meeting my eye. \"Nothing serious.\" I leaned on the doorframe, staring at him. \"Well, if you insist. I thought I heard you scream, but I guess it was my imagination.\" I waved somewhat awkwardly at him. \"Night then.\" \"Yeah. Nighty night, Mackenzie,\" he said with an overly-done yawn, stretching his arms over his head. That was when I saw the three deep scratches raked down his forearm. \"Jonah?\" I said quietly, pointing. \"What are those?\" \"What's what?\" he asked innocently, bringing his arm down to look at it. \"Oh! Um…I uh, fell out of bed and caught my arm on the side of the bed.\" \"Three times?\" \"Er…yup.\" I narrowed my eyes at him. \"You know I don't believe a word you're saying, right?\" \"Look, Mack, I'm fine ,\" Jonah insisted breezily. \"But I can tell you're not. You've got bags under those pretty brown eyes of yours. You need your beauty sleep, you know that.\" \"Yeah, well, I'd probably find it easier to sleep if James hadn't ostracised me from his life and made me feel like the scourge of Los Angeles,\" I muttered, but I wasn't loud enough for Jonah to completely pick up on what I had said. \"Anyway, let's take two on this. Good night , Jonah.\" \"Goodnight, my sweet little Mackenzie.\" \"So we're all officially fucked,\" I said to the now-titled Confession Cam. Well, I'd titled it, anyhow. \"We have no water, and I mean none . McBride fucking wasted all the emergency stash before he fucked off outside into what looks like the middle of Mount Vesuvius. So we're rapidly dehydrating, and I'm pretty sure I saw Craig drinking his own urine a little while ago. Yup, we've stooped to piss drinking. That's how dire this situation has become.\" I sighed heavily, running my hand through my knotted and greasy hair. \"And d'you know what? That isn't even the worst of it. Danny decided to tell everyone about me and Jay sleeping together. That is truly the worst thing that has ever happened to me. James won't speak to me…hell, he won't even look at me. And why should he? I cheated on his little brother. It was a one-time, one-off totally drunken mistake that both Jay and I regretted instantly, but it's still come back and bitten us on the ass.\" I paused, thinking I could hear someone hovering outside the door, eavesdropping on my confessional. When I turned and saw no one there, I continued, \"I hate myself. I really do. I love Dave…I always have and always will. He's the love of my life. For fuck sake, we've been together for nearly six years. Why was I stupid enough to risk all this just because I was wasted and upset and needed to feel close to someone? I'm starting to think it might actually be better if he is dead. At least…at least then he won't ever find out just how much of a total whore his girlfriend is. Oh my God, I can't believe I just said that. I'd say I should go to Hell for that, but the truth is, I'm pretty sure I'm already in Hell.\" I looked up at the ceiling and let out a scream. \"You know what, God? Congratu-fucking-lations. You win. Okay? You win. Kill me. Just let me die. Send one of your decapitation monsters in here and let it chop my head off. Let me choke on the ash outside. Or better yet, save yourself some time. Just let the ceiling above me come crashing down and crush me to death right here, right now. Because I can guarantee that nothing you do to me will cause me as much pain as what I'm experiencing already. Fuck you, fuck your angels, and fuck Heaven. I'm done.\" We were dying. There was no use pussyfooting around it. If we didn't find more food and water, we were rapidly all going to starve and dehydrate. But there was no food left anywhere in this house. So one of us had to go outside to look for some. We gathered around the small white table like we had so many times before, and Seth produced that same box of matches from a few days ago. \"I think we all remember how this works,\" he said, lighting one and hastily wafting it out. \"Whoever gets the burnt match has to go to one of Franco's neighbours houses, get us some food and some water.\" \"No-ho-ho!\" Craig quickly said. \"No, I'm not going first!\" \"I'll g-\" I tried to volunteer, but James cut across me. \"I'll go first,\" he said, raising his arms like it was a big deal that he was potentially sacrificing himself. \"Thank you,\" said Seth, holding the matches to him. \"Very mature of you. Thank you.\" James didn't even look as he chose his match, but he was fine; the tip was red. He punched the air and exclaimed, \"Yes!\" He then composed himself and quickly said, \"Sorry.\" Seth clapped him on the shoulder and said, \"Good job.\" He looked over at Jonah, who apparently hadn't recovered from his rough night as the poor man looked like death warmed up. \"You okay, Jonah?\" \"What's that?\" Jonah mumbled absent-mindedly. \"You okay?\" Seth repeated. \"Yeah,\" Jonah said, but his tone was vacant of emotion. \"Just bad sleep. Crazy dream.\" \"Here, Jonah.\" Seth held the matches out to him, and he silently plucked one from the bundle. This one was red too, and when Jonah saw he quickly dropped the match down on the table. \"Mackenzie,\" was all Seth said to me when he handed me the match bundle. So he was still pissed with me too, not that he really had much of a reason to be mad with me, mind. Still, I reached out and took one of the matches, turning it around to look at the end. Red. \"Thank you, God,\" I muttered, and I was unsure if I was being sarcastic or genuinely thankful. It should have been me. Seth, Jay and Craig all squirmed uncomfortably, with Craig loudly exclaiming, \"Shit!\" It was now the final three; one of them was going outside. \"Craigers, you feeling lucky?\" Seth asked him as he passed over the matches. \"Will history repeat itself?\" Not today, apparently, as Craig's match emerged red. This left Jay and Seth. I really had no idea who to root for at this point; I didn't want either of them to go out there into that wasteland! James certainly knew who he was rooting for though, as he slapped Seth on the back and said, \"You got this, dawg.\" He was on Seth's side. Shocker. Seth held out the two remaining matches to Jay, who squeezed his eyes shut as he reached for one of them. He opened them just as his hand darted out and pulled out his choice match. This one was red too. \"Seth, no! Not you!\" cried James, throwing his match down in anger. The rest of us just remained silent, unsure really how to comment on it. None of us wanted Seth to go out there, of course we didn't. But at the same time, it had to be one of us, and no one wanted it to be their self. Seth blew out a sigh. \"I'm not going.\" \"What?!\" Jay and I both demanded in unison. \"What the fuck are you talking about?!\" I added irately. \"I am not going!\" Seth asserted. \"I'm bowing out. I'm declining to go!\" \" What ?\" Jay said again. \"Er, let me break it down for you,\" Seth said sarcastically. \"I'm not fucking going!\" \"You are definitely going!\" Jay insisted. He looked around at the rest of us. \"Tell him he's fucking going!\" \"Tell you what,\" Seth snapped. \"Why don't you fucking go, Mr Self-Righteous? You're constantly saying what assholes we are, how good you are. You go get us some fucking water!\" \"Shut the fuck up and back off, Seth!\" I shouted. \"No, Mack, he's right,\" Jay said. He snapped his match in two. \"I will go,\" he said firmly to Seth. \"Because I have something called 'honour.'\" \"That's good. Yeah, you're very honourable,\" Seth said sardonically. \"Fucking another guy's girlfriend, that's real honourable, right?\" Of course. We just had to go back to that. When all else fails, bring up 'Jay and Mack Had Sex'. \"I'll go with you, Jay,\" Craig gravely offered. \"Really?\" Jay said, sounding disbelievingly touched. \"Is it because of our…pact upstairs?\" He pointed up. \"Nah,\" Craig replied. \"'Cause you got them skinny-ass arms. You couldn't carry enough to feed a hamster.\" \"I'll come too!\" I suddenly volunteered. \"I'll help as well.\" Fuck it. I was close to death anyway; why not just potentially shorten the process? \"Oh yeah, gotta make sure you can protect your boyfriend, huh, Mackenzie?\" sniped James, speaking directly to me for the first time in about twelve hours. Something inside me broke then. I was so fucking fed up of him treating me like this. It was none of his business, what had happened with me and Jay. It was between me, Jay and Dave, and nobody else. I got that James was angry on behalf of his absent brother, of course I did. But he didn't need to keep treating me like I was something disgusting that he'd stepped in. I might have been a heartless, cheating bitch, but I still had feelings. And at this precise moment in time, that feeling was indignant fury. \"Fuck you, James!\" I spat. \"I'll stay here, then, and be totally useless like you bunch of assbutts! That's totally fucking fine with me! Happy?\" I flipped him off and stormed over to the sofas, where I sat with my back to everyone, drawing my legs up to my chest and wrapping my arms around myself. I effectively tuned out anything else the guys were saying. I honestly just did not care anymore. It was only when I looked around and saw Jay and Craig about to embark on their journey that I actually stirred. I uncurled myself and stood up, hurrying over to them. \"Please keep safe,\" I begged them, taking their hands in mine. \"Or at least, just don't die. Please. I'm internally broken enough already.\" Craig chuckled. \"Ain't no motherfuckers taking a pop at this.\" I decided to neglect reminding him that something out there had already tried to 'take a pop at that.' I laughed without a trace of humour and put my arms around him, earning myself a classic Craig Robinson bear hug. I then turned to Jay and fiercely wrapped my arms around his neck, and he hugged me back tightly. I didn't care how this looked, didn't care how everyone knew what had happened at the Four Seasons; Jay was my best friend, and nothing anyone said was going to change that. \"Don't die,\" I whispered in his ear, and he held me out at arm's length. \"Promise me, Jay. You die, and I'll die. That's how this will work. So promise me, Baruchel. Please.\" \"You've always been so overdramatic,\" he said, giving me a small smile. \"But yeah. I promise that we won't die.\" He turned to Craig, tightening his grip on the baseball bat he'd just picked up. \"I know where the nearest house is,\" James said, coming up behind us. \"Awesome. Let's get that money,\" Jay said, trying to sound confident. \"Let's do it,\" Craig agreed. Jay reached out and opened the door, smoke pouring into the house instantly. \"Out and to the left,\" James told them. They both nodded, and the next thing, they'd slipped out the door, which James shut firmly behind them. And then there were four. This could not have been anymore awkward if it tried. James hadn't said a word to me since his earlier outburst, and Seth was barely speaking to me because I hadn't told him Jay had been in LA. And Jonah…Jonah just seemed off, all pale and sweaty and distracted and shit. Jesus Christ, the last thing we needed was for him to develop the flu in the middle of all this bullshit. Antibiotics were a thing of the past. But even if it wasn't flu, something definitely wasn't right with the man. I was sat on the sofa, picking away at the last of my French manicure and inspecting exactly how much damage my poor nails had endured over the last week and a half. The tips were ragged and broken, the skin around the nails bitten, red raw and bloody. I hadn't bitten my nails since I was about nineteen, but all this stress had caused me to relapse. Jonah was wandering around in a total daze; going into the kitchen, pausing, coming back into the living area, pausing, then heading into another room and coming back a few moments later. James and Seth, meanwhile, had disappeared upstairs. \"Jonah? Bruh?\" I called to him after about five minutes of him doing this, as I was starting to get a little worried. He paused, halfway to wandering back into the kitchen. \"What's going on with you, man?\" He didn't say anything. Instead, his face drained of what little colour was left, and he suddenly collapsed, hitting the floorboards with a sickening thud. \" JONAH !\" I shrieked, leaping up and sprinting over to him, dropping to my knees by his head and looking for signs of life. \"JAMES! SETH! HELP! PLEASE!\" I screamed at the stairs, hoping and praying they would hear me and not just brush me off. Thank God, they did listen, and both of them came barrelling down the stairs about twenty seconds later. \"Oh fuck!\" shouted Seth. \"Is he okay?!\" asked James, panicked. \"I don't…I don't know!\" I said frantically, running my hands through my hair. \"One second he seemed okay, and the next he just…he just collapsed!\" \"Dude! Jonah!\" Seth exclaimed as he and James reached me and Jonah's slumped form. \"What the fuck! What do we do?! Do you guys know first aid or anything?!\" \"No!\" James replied. \"I know how to check for a pulse!\" I said, remembering some of the first aid training I'd undertaken in the eleventh grade. \"Well, fucking get on it, then!\" Seth yelled. \"Don't yell at me!\" I wailed, and I pressed two fingers to Jonah's neck, probing for that flicker of life. As I did so, James and Seth were clapping and clicking in Jonah's face, trying to get him to awaken. \"Here!\" I announced desperately, feeling a feeble throbbing under my fingers. \"I've found a pulse! But fuck, it's so weak! I think…shit, you guys, I really think he's dying!\" \"Wait! Low blood sugar!\" Seth suddenly proclaimed. \"LBS!\" \"LBS?!\" James repeated. \"He's having an LBS episode!\" Seth explained. \"Quick! Someone get the Milky Way!\" I shouted. \"I'll get the Milky Way!\" yelped James, running off to the kitchen. \"You get the Milky Way!\" Seth also shouted. \"Jonah! Stay with me! Stay with me!\" \"I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it! Open his mouth!\" James came speeding back, the brown-wrapped Milky Way clutched in his hand. \"Open his mouth! Open his mouth, I'll get this in there!\" I reached out and clasped Jonah's chin, wrenching his mouth open. \"Come on, Jonah! Wake up! It's Milky Way time, buddy!\" James started prodding the chocolate bar at Jonah's mouth, but obviously Jonah was not biting it. \"Jonah. Milky Way, Jonah!\" \"It's not fucking working, man!\" Seth shouted hysterically. \"What the fuck?!\" \"How do we get it in there?!\" James demanded. \"Chew it and spit it in!\" I suggested. \"Yeah! Yeah, Mack's right!\" Seth said in agreement. \"Chew it up and spit it in his mouth like a baby bird!\" Oh, so now I was being useful I was back to 'Mack' again. James nodded and took a bite, positioning himself over Jonah's head. However, a few seconds later there was the distinct sound of James swallowing. \"You just swallowed it, man!\" Seth said disbelievingly. \"It's so good!\" James defended. \"Give me a bite!\" Seth demanded, seizing the bar and taking off a chunk. \"Mmm! The second it hits your mouth is, like, amazing!\" \"Guys!\" I shouted. \"You're missing the fucking point of eating the goddamn Milky Way! Give it to me!\" I snatched the bar from James' hand and bit off a hearty chunk. I chewed it into mush, then positioned my mouth three inches above Jonah's. Seth held Jonah's mouth open, and I allowed a dribble of Milky Way spit to drool out of my mouth. However, before I could get the spit into Jonah's agape mouth, his head suddenly twisted around to face upwards, and he began to recite something in a language I didn't recognize, in a voice that sounded like it was doubled up…like two people were speaking. James, Seth and I all shrieked, leaping to our feet and taking a step back. Jonah lie spasming on the floor, spitting out words that none of us could understand in the slightest. \"What the fuck was that?\" Seth whispered. \"That's Hebrew!\" said James. \"That was not Hebrew!\" I answered scathingly. \"Moron. I think it was Latin or some shit like that!\" \"Yeah, I went to Hebrew school for six years!\" added Seth. \"That's not Hebrew!\" That was when Jonah's head snapped up, his eyes springing open and revealing murky-green irises. \"You will drown in a river of blood,\" he hissed in that same deep, doubled-up voice. \"The End of Days is here. You will quiver in the shadow of Kingdom Come. Judgement Day is upon you. The apocalypse is nigh!\" His head slumped back down, his eyes closing. James, Seth and I all looked at each other with wide, panicked eyes. Oh. Holy. Fuck. This shit had just gotten so, so much more complicated. A/N- Demon possession. Always a fun time, no? Well, shit is about to well and truly hit the fan in our favourite actors' lives. Once again, I just want to say a huge, almighty thank you to every single one of you who reviewed!

Chapter Eleven- And Nobody Screams Harley yawned heavily and rubbed at her eyes. She hadn't worn make-up or gotten properly dressed for days; she was just so tired. But she couldn't sleep. How could she? Dean, Kris, Jesse…they'd all been asleep when they died. And she was next. She or Nancy or Quentin. Krueger was coming for one of them. Hearing Nancy's mom tell the three of them how they all gone to pre-school together, how they…how they had all been abused by that man had made Harley feel like her entire life had been a lie. Freddy Krueger was coming for them. He wanted revenge against the children who had gotten him killed. Eleven of those children were dead…and there were three to go, just barely. Nancy had almost died in the bath, Quentin had nearly been drowned in the school pool, and Harley had almost been electrocuted when her radio 'fell' into her shower. She just wanted to sleep. Why was this happening? Why her!? She headbutted the window of the Jeep. \"What's taking Quentin so long?!\" she grumbled, peering out the glass to see if she could spot him in the store. Nancy didn't reply. \"Nance? Nancy?\" Still no reply. \"Nancy! Don't! Fall! Asleep!\" she said, much more loudly, kicking the back of the passenger seat. Nancy jerked with a shivery gasp, clutching the sides of her seat. \"Harley?!\" she cried out. \"It was Krueger! He's here!\" Harley unclipped her belt and slide into the middle seat so she could look at her best friend. \"Babe, we gotta stay awake! Come on! We can do this!\" Nancy ran her hands through her hair, hyperventilating. \"It's too hot! I'm too hot!\" she exclaimed, ripping her cardigan off. \" Nancy, please calm down!\" Harley begged. \"You've been awake too long! I've been awake too long! We are gonna end up losing it if we're not careful! But we just need to stay up a bit longer. Okay? We are gonna stop this motherfucker if it's the…we're gonna stop him.\" She had nearly said 'if it's the last thing we do,' but the reality was that it really could be the last thing they do. \" I can stay awake,\" Nancy replied. \"I know how.\" And before Harley could stop her, Nancy's hand darted out and pulled out the car's cigarette lighter, which she pressed down into her forearm. \" What the fuck are you doing?!\" Harley shrieked, wrenching the lighter from Nancy's hand and shoving back in its holder. She'd been too late; the lighter had scalded a deep burn into Nancy's arm. Nancy was sobbing, looking at the smoking burn. \" I had too!\" she cried. \"Krueger's here!\" Harley slapped her in the face, twice. \"Nancy, please! You're scaring me! He isn't here! It's the micro naps! I promise, he isn't here!\" \" He is!\" Nancy insisted. \"We need to warn Quentin!\" And without waiting for Harley to reply, she shoved the passenger door open and climbed out, hurrying towards the store. \" Nancy!\" Harley shouted after her, but she ignored her. \"Nan- oh, goddamn it!\" She wrestled with her own door until it opened, and she practically fell out in her haste to exit the car. That was when she heard the laughter. Deep and menacing. It was all around her, coming from every angle, thudding in her ears, suffocating her. She twisted her head around, desperately trying to find the source of the laugh. He was standing by the hood of the car. Krueger. He was grinning at her, a yellow, rotten grin. His shoulders shook as he laughed at her. \"Shouldn't you help your friend?\" he taunted. \" You're not real,\" Harley said, backing away from him. \"You're not here. You're not real!\" \" Oh I'm real,\" he replied menacingly, advancing on her. \"I've always been real.\" \" No,\" she whimpered. \"You aren't real! I don't…I don't believe in you!\" Her back pressed up against the glass window of the store. Krueger was right in front of her, his dead eyes level with hers. \" My Harley girl,\" Krueger said softly, running his hand through her hair in a way that made her puke in her mouth a little bit. \"You never were as good as Little Nancy.\" Harley twisted her head away, tears pouring down her face. \"Look at me!\" he suddenly roared, causing her to cringe. Reluctantly, Harley looked at him, dead in the eyes. \"Go fuck yourself, Krueger!\" Krueger didn't even say anything. Instead, he seized Harley by the lapels of her denim waistcoat and lifted her up three feet clean off the ground. She began screaming then, struggling against Krueger's superhuman grip on her. \"Get off me! Get the fuck off me, you motherfucker!\" There it was again. That laugh. It made Harley's blood run cold. \" Sorry to crash the party so late,\" Krueger jeered, and he slammed Harley into the window, sending her smashing through the glass into the shop in a pile of blood and glass splinters. The glass tore through Harley's wrists and the inside of her elbows, slashing her veins. She bled out in seconds. To most of the people in the store, it had looked like the crazy girl outside had committed suicide by jumping though the window out of her own free will. But as Nancy and Quentin clutched at their dead friend's corpse, Nancy sobbing her heart out, slowly going into shock, they both knew that this meant they had very little time to end Freddy Krueger once and for all. -A Nightmare On Elm Street, 2010 Something brown and slimy started to leak out of the side of Jonah's mouth. James, Seth and I all stood around him, dithering around like a bunch of fucking dickheads, totally unsure what to do to help him. \"What is that?\" asked Seth disgustedly, looking at the brown stuff. James reached out and touched it, smearing some on his fingertip. \"What is that? Is that bile?\" \"I don't know,\" muttered James, inspecting his finger. \"It's cold.\" \"Sniff it,\" Seth suggested. \"No!\" James replied, holding his finger out to Seth. \"You sniff it.\" Seth did just that, recoiling from it almost instantly. \"It smells like puke!\" \"Ew!\" James started wiping his finger on Seth's t-shirt. Wait. Bile-like consistency. Cold. Pukeish smell. I'd seen this before…like in every Hell-based horror movie ever. Oh, shit ! \"Guys, I know what-\" I started to yell, when Jonah suddenly sat up and sprayed a fountain of green vomit over the three of us. We began screaming, futilely attempting to keep the puke off us by shielding our faces with our arms. For obvious reasons, that really did not work. We still ended up coated in the stuff. By the time Jonah had stopped vomiting I was scraping sick out of my eyes, my nose, my mouth. \"The fuck did that just happen!\" I screeched, shaking my arms in an attempt to shake some of the muck off me. \"It's in my eyes!\" James was shrieking, wiping his face. \"I think it's in my nasal cavities!\" I cried, pinching my nose. \"Dudes!\" Seth suddenly shouted, pointing down. \"He's gone!\" \"What?!\" I spluttered, following his finger. He was right; Jonah had vanished. \"What in the fuck?!\" \"Where is he?!\" demanded James. \"He's fucking gone!\" Seth howled. \"Oh shit!\" I shrieked. \"Shit shit shit! This is not good! You guys, that stuff coming out of his mouth…I think it means he's been possessed!\" \"Possessed?!\" they both shouted in confusion. \"Yeah, possessed!\" I repeated impatiently. \"As in, fucking demon possession, possessed! I don't know if you douchebags picked up on it, but that was not Jonah's normal voice! There were two voices overlapping each other; the demon is using Jonah as a vessel, talking through him!\" \"Are you fucking kidding me?\" James said doubtfully. \"Demon possession?\" \"Do not doubt me, Franco!\" I said stiffly. \"I've pretty much dedicated my life to horror films- I've seen The Exorcist about eighty times! And I'm from Amityville! I'm like a demon possession expert!\" \"Fuck! Jonah!\" He began to yell Jonah's name repeatedly, as did Seth and I, looking wildly around us. Where the fuck could he have gone?! \"Jonah, stop this!\" ordered Seth. \"Please!\" \"Jonah, where the fuck are you?!\" shouted James. \"Why did you puke on us?!\" I hollered, and the next thing I knew Jonah had popped up from nowhere and seized James by the top of the arm, picking him up and sending him flying down into the sofa area. Jonah leapt after him, and I think he began to physically bite James. \"Jonah!\" I shrieked. \"Stop it! This isn't you! I know you're still in there, you have to fight it!\" \"Bad Jonah! Stop!\" shouted Seth, like he was berating a misbehaved dog. \"Stop eating him!\" Jonah looked up at him and hissed. Like, actually hissed. He hissed like a snake. Suddenly, he was back on his feet, lunging for Seth. \"Watch out!\" James warned in a panic. \"He's super strong!\" But it was too late: Jonah shoved Seth over with such a force that Seth went skidding along the floor and almost ended up falling head-first down the hole to the basement. I wanted to help him, I did, but I was in the process of attempting to help James get back up on his feet. However, I was still dripping with vomit, as was James, meaning the floor around us was slick with the icky substance. As I went to haul James up, my bare feet slipped in the mess, and I went crashing down next to him, cracking the back of my head on the hardwood. I saw stars, and I blinked hard to steady my vision. \"Shit, Mack, are you okay?!\" he asked me, leaning up on his elbow. \"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine,\" I said quickly, and the two of us used each other to steady ourselves as we stood up. Seth and Demon Jonah were wrestling by the hole, and I'm pretty sure I heard Demon Jonah ask Seth if his man-titties were big Bs or small Cs. Fuck, not only did we have a demon on our hands, but a sassy demon at that. But however freaked out Seth was, he managed to look past it as his fist flashed up and he punched Demon Jonah in the face, sending him sprawling. \"I'll get you something to help!\" James shouted, whilst I ran over to attempt to provide Seth with some back-up. I kicked Demon Jonah in the ribs about five times, not that I'm entirely sure how this helped anything. \"Stay down, you fucker!\" I grunted, booting him a sixth time, but I had done literally no damage whatsoever because he was just rolling around on the floor. Meanwhile, James and Seth were screaming in the background. James threw Seth a stool to beat down Jonah with, but of course Seth was incapable of even the simplest of tasks and recoiled away when the stool hit him. This gave Demon Jonah enough time to scramble to his feet and grasp hold of Seth and throw him up to the top floor of the house, sending him smashing through the wooden railings. \"Seth!\" James and I shouted, quickly running up the stairs to check he was okay. He was lying on the floor, groaning, but thank the baby Jesus, he didn't seem overly harmed. He managed to struggle to his feet just as Demon Jonah let out an inhuman roar. \"Fuck this shit!\" I screamed, running past James and Seth in my attempt to get away. \"We're getting crazy!\" James yelled, sprinting after me. \"We need to hide!\" I shrieked. \"Where the fuck can we hide?!\" Fucking hell, I really hoped Jay and Craig were still okay… We ended up in James' bedroom, the three of us bent double, bracing ourselves on our knees as we tried to regain the use of our lungs. \"We gotta hide! We gotta hide!\" James was whimpering. \"I literally just said that!\" I snapped. \"He's coming, he's coming, he's coming!\" James continued in the same tone. \"We know he's coming!\" exclaimed Seth, unnerved. \"I don't know what the fuck to do!\" \"I don't know-\" James began, when Seth suddenly ran past us both. \"Where are you going?!\" \"Shit!\" was all Seth said as he wrenched open the doors of James' closet. \"Good thinking, Batman!\" I said, James and I both following after him. We positioned ourselves behind the railings of clothes, making sure they covered our faces. Well, they covered my face. Seth and James were both a good three or four-ish inches taller than me, so their eyes peeped out over the top of the rails. They shut up instantly, and through the clothes I could see that Demon Jonah had wandered into the room and was looking around. Looking for us. \"Please go away!\" snivelled Seth. \"He's sniffing,\" James whispered. \"I'm so scared, guys!\" Seth whimpered. \"Be quiet!\" James ordered. It was silent for about three seconds, when suddenly a sound like a small leaf-blower started up. I frowned. \"Who the fuck is vacuuming at a time like this?!\" I hissed as quietly as I could. I twisted my head up to look between James and Seth, and saw that Seth was breathing as loud as humanly possible out of his open mouth. \"Seth!\" I hissed. \"You're breathing really loud!\" James whispered to him. \"Am I?\" Seth replied. \"Don't breathe through your mouth!\" James said. \"Okay,\" Seth answered, snapping his mouth shut. Then the weird vacuum-breathing noise started coming out of his nose. \"Can you just breathe like a normal person?\" I whispered at him irately. \"Now you're nose-breathing too loudly!\" \"I'm sorry!\" he hissed. \"I can't help it! I don't know where else to breathe from!\" He started to alternate between nose-breathing and mouth-breathing. \"Is that-\" \"Seth!\" James whisper-snapped to get him to shut up. \"Jesus H. Christ,\" I muttered, trying to be as quiet as possible since Demon Jonah had just snapped his head around to look directly at the closet. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man oh man oh man oh man. We. Were. Fucked. We tried to hide ourselves more with the clothes as the demon got ever closer, but I could just tell it wasn't going to work. \"Oh shit, don't move!\" Seth hissed. \"Shit, he's coming over!\" I whimpered. \"Fuck, fuck, fuck!\" Demon Jonah was creeping closer, his hand outstretched for the closet door handle, when Seth suddenly lunched forward with a scream, knocking the demon down to the floor. James and I sprinted after him, James kicking the demon back down and me standing on its gut. The three of us fought with each other to get down the stairs first, none of us relenting at all. We ended up in such a tangle that we all tripped at the head of the steps, sending all three of us rolling down the stairs. We landed in a groaning heap at the bottom, vaguely concussed and very in pain. \"Oh, fuck my life!\" I moaned. \"You guys okay?\" James asked us as we struggled to sit up. \"Yeah. Yeah, it's all good!\" I said, taking the hand he'd offered to me and climbing to my feet. \"We gotta get out of here!\" \"Let's go!\" James said, helping up Seth, who was just repeatedly saying the word, \"Okay!\" We were about halfway to the door when it suddenly burst open, a screaming Craig and Jay falling through it. Seth, James and I all started screaming at them in return. Jay and Craig began to barricade the door shut, still yelling. \"What the fuck?!\" shrieked Seth. \"What are you doing?!\" \"There's a fucking demon chasing us!\" shouted Craig. James, Seth and I all looked at each other, then back at the two of them. \"A demon ?!\" we exclaimed in unison. So this really was Hell on Earth. Jonah really had been taken over. \"What the fuck happened to you guys?!\" asked Jay, gesturing at our vomit-decorated attire. \"That!\" Seth said hopelessly, pointing at something to the side of us. We all turned, and saw Demon Jonah lurching towards us like a zombie. \"It's Jonah!\" shouted James. \"He's been fucking possessed!\" I added, hastily backing away. Jay, however, wasted literally no time swinging his baseball bat around and cracking the demon right around the face with it. \"Oh, fuck!\" exclaimed Seth. \"You brained him!\" \"Is that…I was supposed to do that, right?\" Jay asked hesitantly. \"Well, even if it wasn't, it's a bit fucking late now!\" I retorted, when Demon Jonah suddenly hissed up at us. Jay smacked him straight in the nose again, and this time the demon stayed down. \"Motherfucker,\" Jay spat. After James, Seth and I got changed out of the puke clothes (Seth borrowing some of James' stuff and me swapping the tank top of James' I'd been in for my stained orange camisole and leather jacket), Seth and James dragged Demon Jonah's unconscious form up to the bedroom he'd been residing in the last…however long we'd been trapped in this hellhole. I gathered up a frying pan, the little hammer and the baseball bat, plus a load of James' belts for us to tie Jonah to the bed with. James, Seth and Craig were all strapping him down to the double bed whilst Jay and I stood at the foot of the bed frame, primed with the bat and a very large atlas I'd taken out of James' library. \"Fasten, goddamn you, bastard!\" Jay was yelling. \"He is gonna be fucking bad news when he wakes up!\" shouted Seth. \"He's fucking strong!\" agreed James. \"My side's good,\" confirmed Craig, just as the demon began to stir. \"Oh, shitmuffins!\" I screeched, holding the atlas high above my head, ready to beat down some motherfuckers. \"Alright, I'll fucking hit him!\" declared Jay, standing in a fighting stance with his bat raised up, but the other guys were already running out of the room, and James grabbed hold of his wrist and dragged him out with me following, dropping the atlas as I did so. We ended up in James' library, sitting in a circle and trying to come to terms with what the fuck had just occurred. \"This shit's cray-cray, guys,\" Seth said quietly. \"I mean…it's like, the real, like, apocalypse. It's like, the book of Revelations. Like, that means there's a God. Right?\" Jay was nodding. Of course; he'd been right this whole time. \"I haven't led my life as though there's a God this whole time,\" Seth admitted. \"None of us really have,\" I mumbled, leaning my forehead on my hand. \"I mean, who fucking saw that coming?\" he continued. \"That there's actually a God?\" \"I'd say…ninety-five percent of the planet,\" replied Jay, and I shot him a glare that said, 'this is not the time for your smug wisecracks.' \"Jesus fucking Christ, man,\" blew out Seth, \"You might want to stay away from saying that,\" Craig suggested gravely. \"Jesus fucking Christ?\" he said again. \"Why?\" The rest of us objected at him, with Jay actually making the sign of the cross over himself. This was a new world; we could not be saying shit like that anymore. \"Hello?\" I said obviously. \"It's one of the Ten Commandments. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. That's like, third grade stuff.\" \"Jesus isn't the name of the Lord,\" Seth protested. \" God is the name of the Lord.\" \"Jesus, God, it's all the same,\" Craig told him. \"It's the Trinity,\" added Jay, holding up three fingers. \"It's the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,\" I concluded. \"It's like Neapolitan ice cream,\" James put in. \"I don't even know what the fucking Commandments are,\" Seth said. \"Guys, I think this is sort of bullshit,\" James suddenly said. \"Because we're all good people. I can look at each one of you in the eye, I know you're good. Well, maybe there are some exceptions.\" He looked pointedly at me, and I looked to the ground in pure mortification. So now we'd half-dealt with our demon problem, it was back to Mack-shaming. And with it, James was basically saying that I deserved to be here, trapped on Hell on Earth. And he was right. I mean, even this was one of the fucking Commandments. Thou shalt not commit adultery . \"I'm good,\" Seth quickly said. \"We're five actors!\" James carried on. \"We bring joy to people's lives!\" \"Yeah, but we don't do it for free,\" Jay reminded him. \"We get paid handsomely; much higher than the average profession.\" \"It's not like it was just handed to any of us,\" James defended. \"We've worked really hard to be here.\" \"Yeah, pretend like it's hot when it's cold,\" chipped in Craig. \"You sitting on the beach, it's freezing, you in your drawers, talking about something, everybody's surfing.\" \"I think God may have just fucked up,\" Seth whispered. \"Made a mistake, and left us behind by accident. I mean, He's got a lot of shit on His plate.\" \"He's God , jackass!\" I said heatedly. \"God doesn't make mistakes! He's omniscient and all that!\" \"Mack's right,\" said Craig. \"It's not an oversight, it's not a mistake, okay? We gotta face facts. We're here, and there's a reason we're all here.\" \"Why are you so sure?\" demanded James. \"I...I've done things, man,\" he said solemnly. \"I…I gouged a man's eyeballs out.\" \"What in the name of all that is holy?!\" I exclaimed. \"What the-\" said Jay. \"Fuck off.\" That came from Seth. \"Craig!\" James practically reprimanded. \"I was a kid, man,\" Craig explained. \"It was a fucking bar fight. It was a bad foosball game. He said I didn't call spinneys, and I fucking called spinneys. He got all in my face and I-\" cue violent gesture. \"-smashed a bottle across his face. The first eyeball was an accident, but then I was like, fuck it, and I went for the second one. It was fucked up. But you know what? That shit happens. I'm saying, that's…I think that's why I'm here.\" \"I gotta admit something…\" James began. \"I…um…\" He hesitated, then just came straight out with, \"I fucked Lindsay Lohan!\" None of us even spoke. Everyone's eyebrows just shot three inches up their face. What in the fuck. \"She was fucked up, she was high!\" James confessed. \"It was at the Chateau Marmont and she kept banging on my door. She kept calling me Jake Gyllenhaal.\" \"That's fucked up,\" Seth grimaced. \"Yeah. I said…'call me the Prince of Persia.'\" \"Well, all my dirty laundry has been well and truly aired,\" I said sourly. \"As has Jay's. We got nothing to admit.\" \"See, that's what I'm saying, man!\" said Craig. \"We've all done bad shit, y'know? We've done more bad shit than good in our lives, and…\" he trailed off, sighing. \"It's time to pay the piper.\" There was a sudden electronic fizzling sound, and the lights completely shut off. Everyone cried out variations of, \"what the fuck.\" \"Oh, brilliant,\" I grumbled. \"Because a power cut is exactly what we need right now.\" \"God did this,\" James whispered dramatically, holding a lit Zippo up so his face was illuminated. \"He gave us light, and then He took it away.\" \"You hear that?\" Jay asked rhetorically as a load of inhuman roars started emanating from upstairs. \"It's the soundtrack of us going insane.\" \"Damn, I wish there was something we could do to help him,\" Craig said sadly. A metaphorical light bulb suddenly flickered to life over my head. Of course. How had I not thought of this as soon as I realised what had happened. \"I know what we can do!\" I said at the same time as Jay. I looked at him, and he looked at me. It was clear that we'd both had the same idea. A/N- Honestly, that might be one of my favourite parts of the whole movie. Love me some demon activity. Yes, I'm a freak, I'm more than aware. But anyway, let me know how you liked it! Your reviews are making me feel so validated! Keep 'em comin'! Xx Gee xX[Chapter 12] A/N- Getting closer to the end now! There's only one more chapter after this. Sad, really, isn't it? I know I think it is. So I'm giving many of the thanks to LunaEvanna Longbottom, Im Kind Of Important, Ansolo, bitchinh0es and Firework's Feelings for reviewing! Chapter Twelve- She Couldn't Survive Her 15 Minutes \" So, er, who are you?\" Zack asked the stunning brunette in front of him, trying not to openly stare at her boobs. She smiled. \"My name is Lolabelle Waters.\" \" Hi Lolabelle,\" said Miri, rolling her eyes at Zack. \"What do you do?\" \" Oh, I'm a porn actress,\" she replied, smiling again. \" Oh, you're an actual porn star?\" Zack sounded like he could barely believe his luck. \" Yeah, I started out when I was nineteen,\" she said. \"I couldn't pay any of my utilities bills, and they were gonna evict me so I needed an easy way to make cash.\" \" Huh,\" said Miri. She looked at Zack. \"Now where have we heard that one before?\" They called Lolabelle offering her a role in their movie four days later. Despite the freezing cold outside, she turned up at the scripting (half an hour late) in a cropped top, micro miniskirt and, as a concession to the cold, knee-high boots and a cardigan. \" Hey Miri!\" she said enthusiastically, bounding through the doors, not actually apologising for her lateness. \"Hi Zack!\" \" Hey, Lola,\" Zack said, grinning at her. \" Lolabelle,\" she corrected, taking a seat next to Delaney. \"Not Lola.\" \" Oh, right,\" he said. \"Fuck, my bad.\" \" So, as I was saying before Lolabelle got here,\" Miri said loudly, looking at Lolabelle in a vaguely irritated fashion. \"Here are the scripts, so everybody take one.\" \"' Star Whores'?\" said Lester, reading the title off his. \" Yeah!\" said Zack eagerly. \"Funny, right?\" \" What does it mean?\" asked Lolabelle, frowning at Zack and Miri. \" Star Whores?\" Miri prompted. \"Like Star Wars but sexy? No? Seriously?\" \" What's Star Wars?\" Lolabelle looked so confused. \" You know what? Never mind,\" Miri said quickly. \"See, we figured this opens us up to an even bigger sales market beyond the people we went to school with. People who like comics and sci-fi.\" \" So horny nerds?\" piped up Lolabelle. \" Yeah, horny nerds,\" replied Zack. \"Stuff like Spider-Man and shit, you know? There's always a shitload of Star Wars nerds at those comic-book shows. So we sell them a Princess Leia they can really fucking jerk off to.\" \" That'd be me,\" said Miri. \"Princess Lay-Her.\" Lester raised his hand. \"Who am I playing?\" \" You, my friend,\" said Zack. \"Are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.\" \" Aw, man, he's gonna be balling dudes?\" Delaney groaned. \"I thought you said this shit was boys on girls.\" \" If I have to fuck a guy, okay, but I'd rather fuck a girl,\" said Lester. \" What's wrong with you, boy?\" Delaney asked him. \" Uh, we'll change the name to Sky-Baller,\" suggested Zack. \"I will be Hung So-Low. Delaney, my friend, you are On-Your-Knees Bend-Over.\" \" Man, I can't be in no porno!\" protested Delaney. \"My wife will kill me!\" \" Hump me, On-Your-Knees Bend-Over,\" Miri said seductively. \"You're my only hump.\" \" On the other hand,\" he said. \"Fuck my wife.\" \" Unfortunately, On-Your-Knees Bend-Over does not have any sex in the movie,\" said Zack. \"But!\" He handed Bubbles and Barry their scripts. \"The droids do, I-C-U-P and R2-T-Bag.\" He moved over to Stacey. \"And Stacey over here is gonna play Darth Vibrator.\" \" I'm the bad guy?\" she frowned. \" She's not a guy, Zack,\" pointed out Lester. \" I know that,\" Zack replied. \"Because I'm not a fucking idiot!\" \" Who am I? Who am I?!\" asked Lolabelle, practically bouncing in her seat. \" You, Lolabelle, are going to be playing,\" Zack answered, giving her a script. \"Darth Sexy-Puss, the girl working with Darth Vibrator, completing their quest to fuck the galaxy.\" \" Oh my God! That's so clever!\" she laughed, clapping. \"Wait…I don't get it.\" -Zack and Miri Make a Porno, 2008 *cue dramatic, if slightly cliché, organ music* THE EXORCISM OF JONAH HILL Me being the horror nerd I was, I knew the entire exorcism chant from The Exorcist . Jay…well, he mostly knew the whole 'power of Christ compels you' shit. But, hey, y'know, it was a start. We meant business with this shit, so Jay put his hoodie on and drew the hood up over his head, and I stepped back into my high heels. Well have you ever seen anyone perform an exorcism bare-footed? Didn't think so. Jay grabbed the Bible that he'd been reading non-stop since the apocalypse hit, and I bound together a spatula and some salad tongs with bandages to form a crude cross. The five of us headed upstairs to the bedroom, and James gently slid the door open. \"Urgh, the fucking stench,\" he groaned. We all stepped into the room, leaving the door behind us open in case a getaway was required. God, James was right; it fucking reeked in here, like death and soiled boiled eggs. Demon Jonah was still tied to the bed, writing around and roaring. Jay and I approached it/him, whilst the other stood to the side, holding candles. \"Jonah Hill?\" Jay addressed. The demon continued to writhe and roar. \"Jonah?\" The demon laughed. \"Jonah Hill?\" \"Jonah Hill is no more,\" the demon sneered. Shit. It had anchored itself in there good. \"Demon?\" Jay now tried. \"Yes?\" the demon replied. \"Fuck!\" whispered Seth. \"That's not good. That ' s not good .\" \"Jay, you fool,\" the demon hissed, and I clutched my cross tighter, holding it closer to the demon as Jay launched into the exorcism. \"I say unto thee, the power of Christ compels you!\" \"Oh does it?\" jeered the demon. \"Does it compel me?\" \"The power of Christ compels you!\" Jay repeated. \"Does it, Jay?\" \"The power of Christ compels you!\" \"Is the power of Christ compelling me? Is that what's happening?\" Jesus Christ. I didn't care if it was Jonah's body; right now, I was thirty seconds away from decapitating this fucker. \"The power of Christ compels you !\" Jay said yet again. \"Guess what?\" the demon said, sounding bored. \"It's not that compelling.\" \"Oh for fuck sake, move !\" I snapped, pushing Jay behind me. \"Be silent!\" I shouted at Demon Jonah, and he just smirked at me. I stepped up on to the trunk at the end of James' bed, held the makeshift cross out in front of me and declared, \"See the cross of the Lord! Be gone, you hostile power! Oh Lord, hear my prayer, and let my cry come unto thee! The Lord be with you!\" \"Let your cry come?\" the demon inside Jonah jeered. \"You mean just like Jay made you cry when you came?\" I faltered for a moment. How could- how could it know that? I almost whacked my forehead in realisation. Of course. The demon was picking into me, clawing through my memories. I couldn't let it hurt me…I couldn't…that gave it power… \"Jay, Mack, are you serious right now?!\" Seth suddenly interjected. \"This is your fucking plan? You're gonna repeat lines from The Exorcist ?!\" \"I would assume they did their fucking research!\" Jay retorted. \"It's a movie!\" Seth shot back. \"It's a pretty fucking accurate movie!\" I snapped. \"It's like a fucking demon-exorcising manual!\" \"Well, it isn't fucking working!\" Seth exclaimed. \"It will! It is! Just ignore the fucking thing!\" I took a deep breath. \"I CAST YOU OUT, UNCLEAN SPIRIT!\" I screamed, thrusting the cross at the demon. \"IN THE NAME OF OUR LORD-\" \"Jeez, it hurts a little bit!\" Demon Jonah said uncomfortably. \"It's like, this little sting!\" Yes! Yes, I was doing it! I could hear the demon burning! \"-JESUS CHRIST! IT IS HE WHO COMMANDS YOU! HE WHO FLUNG YOU FROM THE HEIGHTS OF HEAVEN TO THE DEPTHS OF HELL! BE GONE FROM THIS CREATURE OF GOD!\" I cried. \"Seriously, fuck off!\" the demon barked at me. \"BE GONE!\" I cleared my throat; exorcising really took it out of your voice. \"In the name of the Father,\" I continued, not as loudly. \"and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit! By this sign of the Holy Cross, of our Lord Jesus Christ! Jonah Hill! I speak for you, and I free you from this demon of Lucifer!\" Jay stepped up to stand next to me. \"The power of Christ compels you!\" he proclaimed again. \"The power of Christ compels you!\" I stepped down now; I'd done my part. The demon let out another uncomfortable squawk, and the bed suddenly began to rise up and shake, just like Regan's in the movie. \"Jay?\" James called nervously, but Jay just started exorcising more vehemently. \"The power of Christ compels you!\" The bed began to shake even more violently, creaking under the force of it. \"Holy shit!\" shouted Seth. \"Jay, stop it!\" I exclaimed fearfully. \"We're not helping, we've just royally pissed it off!\" \"Just stop it!\" yelled Seth. \"THE POWER OF CHRIST COMPELS YOU!\" Jay continued. The flames of the candles were flickering, the bed was thrashing around, the demon was screaming, we were screaming, Jay was screaming that the power of Christ was compelling the demon. It was pandemonium. \"Get the fuck down!\" Seth abruptly shouted, seizing hold of Jay mid-exorcism and forcefully yanked him down from the bed. \"What the fuck!?\" exclaimed Jay, pushing Seth, who then pushed him back. \"Don't fucking push me, asshole!\" \"Fuck you!\" Seth spat at him. \"Boys, stop it!\" I cried, forcing my way between them and placing a hand on both their chests. \"Easy, easy!\" \"Fuck you!\" Jay retorted at Seth. \"You're the fucking asshole, you liar!\" Seth said heatedly. \"Still?!\" Jay said exasperatedly. \"Yes, still !\" replied Seth angrily. \"Guys, I don't know if you've noticed, but we have a very possessed Jonah here!\" I exclaimed, trying to drag them back to the reason we'd all gathered in this stinky room in the first place. \"Do we have to argue about this right now?!\" \"Let 'em fight,\" the demon suddenly piped up, sounding awfully relaxed for something that had nearly been killed. \"We have got an exorcism to finish!\" Craig put in. \"Hello?\" \"Do you wanna know why I didn't stay with you?\" Jay said in a low voice. \"Because you were too busy fucking my brother's girlfriend?\" muttered James, and I turned and scowled at him. He just stared back at me, a hard expression on his face. Jay ignored him, looking dead at Seth. \"You fucking changed. You're a fucking…sell-out.\" \"Jay, stop it!\" I warned him, still not taking my hands off either of their chests. \"You did fucking sell out,\" the demon chipped in, sounding like it was thoroughly enjoying this. \"Everyone says.\" \"At least I did change!\" Seth retorted. \"You act like you're fucking eighteen years old still, Jay!\" \"Grow up, Jay!\" the demon mockingly said. \"That's why he's yelling at you!\" \"Seth, back the fuck up!\" I shouted. \"Oh sure, you would stick up from Jay, wouldn't you?\" James said scathingly. \"Honestly, Mackenzie, did you ever actually love my brother?\" \"You know what, Franco?\" I suddenly screeched, finally letting go of Seth and Jay as I stepped forward to face James. \"I am so fucking fed up of you treating me like shit! I made a fucking mistake, okay? Do you know how it felt to live with myself afterwards, seeing Dave every day and knowing what I'd done to him?! No, you fucking don't! I am in love with him! Okay? I love him more than anything and everything in this world! I fucked up! And being honest, it is none of your fucking business!\" \"You've been holding me back this whole time!\" Seth suddenly shouted at Jay in the background, and he reached out and pushed him again. This time, because I wasn't there to stop them, Jay retaliated, and a fight broke out between the two of them. \"You fucking made it my business when you cheated on my little brother, you little slut!\" James was meanwhile shouting at me. \"You motherfucker!\" I screamed, and I threw myself at James, grabbing hold of his shirt and slamming his back into the wall. James pushed me back to get me off him, and I shoved him back, slamming my hands into his chest. So Seth and Jay were busy throwing punches, James and I were wrestling with each other as I attempted to knock Franco's teeth out, and somewhere in the middle we ended up in one massive whirlwind of fists, the four of us falling back into the walk-in wardrobe. Jay and Seth both fell into a stack of cupboards and collapsed, knocking the door clean off one, just as James extracted my viper-like grip on his throat and knocked me down to the ground next to Seth and Jay. \"Everyone, fucking break apart!\" James yelled as Seth and Jay continued to have it out, and I was about to try to kick James in the ankle when Craig suddenly let out a disbelieving exclamation. \"Yo! What the fuck is all this, Franco?!\" He was looking at the broken cupboard, and Jay and Seth even stopped fighting. We all followed his stare. There, nestled in the cupboard, were cans of beans, foil-wrapped crackers, some chocolate bars…what in the fuck?! \"It looks like food!\" James cried in a falsely surprised tone. \"How'd that get there?!\" \"How the fuck long have you been hoarding this shit, Franco?!\" I demanded furiously, gesturing at the cupboard with my hand. \"What?!\" said Seth, sounding scandalized. \"You have more food?!\" \"You knew he had extra food?!\" Craig exploded. \"Er…he gave me one cracker!\" Seth rapidly backtracked. \"But you still fucking knew!\" I shouted, incensed. \"I would have sucked a dick for half a cracker!\" Craig exclaimed hysterically. \"Alright, well maybe I didn't want you to suck my dick, alright?!\" James shouted back. Suddenly, a roaring sound came from the room Demon Jonah was in, but it wasn't demon roaring. It was the same kind of sound that came when something went up in flames. The sound was followed by a burst of yellowish-orange light, and that was when I realised: it fucking was fire! SHIT! Craig and James were still arguing about crackers and sucking dicks, completely oblivious to what had broken out behind them. \"Er, guys?\" I began, probably much more tentatively than was needed for the situation. \"Guys!\" Seth tried to get their attention, pointing. \"Guys, guys! Fire!\" Thank God, Craig shut up and turned around. \"SHIT!\" James did the same, before shouting at the three of us still on the floor, \"Jonah's on fire!\" Seth, Jay and I scrambled to our feet as Craig and James ran into the bedroom, James frantically blowing on the flames to little avail. The rest of the guys- somewhat moronically- followed suit, but it didn't make any difference; the fire spread across the width of the bed, the entire duvet engulfed in flames. \"Put it out!\" the demon cried as we all screamed at the fire. \"Use your mouth! Put it out!\" \"Smother the fire!\" I yelled, so Craig picked up a fake-fur blanket from the floor and threw it over the demon. However, the blanket must have actually been polyester or some other flammable material, because in seconds that was completely on fire too, and as a result, Jonah went up in flames with it. \"Real fucking smart idea, Mackenzie!\" shouted James. \"Don't buy cheap fucking flammable knockoffs then!\" I shouted back, just as the demon pulled out of his restraints and rolled out of bed, knocking into the wall. The room was now steadily catching fire with every step Demon Jonah took towards us, so needless to say we all very rapidly vacated the room, stumbling over each other in our haste. We were running as fast as we possible could, but the demon was hot on our heels (no pun intended), setting fire to everything in its path. Why, oh why did I decided that now was a good time to wear my heeled boots? Because just as we passed the gap in the railings that the demon had thrown Seth through earlier, I tripped, and went catapulting through the gap, landing with an extremely painful thunk. I attempted to get back up, but a sudden hot, shooting pain travelled up my leg as soon as I put weight on my ankle, and I immediately fell back down again. Fan-fucking-tastic, I'd sprained my ankle. I could see the carnage continuing above me as I tried to get my ankle to support me, each attempt bringing tears of pain to my eyes. The entire top level of James' house was on fire, and as the guys came sprinting down the stairs, the demon jumped straight down from the upper level, landing literally three feet away from me. The rug we were both on caught fire now, and Jay quickly grabbed hold of my arm and yanked me to my feet. \"FUCK!\" I screamed as all my weight went to my injured ankle. \"Jay! Stop! I've sprained my ankle, I can't walk! I'll only weigh you down! Just leave me here! It's okay!\" \"No, it fucking isn't!\" he insisted almost angrily, taking hold of me and lifting me into his arms the way someone would carry a baby. Burning debris was falling all around us, setting fire to the sofa, the other rugs, just…everything, and we rejoined the group in heading for the front doors. The fall had slowed the demon down, as it was army-crawling towards us as James, Craig and Seth tried to tear down the remaining boards blocking up the door. It was snarling and growling, clearly in pain, but that didn't stop it trying to reach us. But finally, the guys got the doors open, and we stumbled out of them, Jay almost dropping me in the process. But we looked back into the house just in time to see the demon get fatally crushed by a flaming ceiling beam, blood spurting out around it. \"Jonah,\" I whispered, my voice breaking as tears slid down my soot-coated face. There was screaming, just so much screaming as the remaining five of us made it outside, watching James' house completely collapse. \"No! My fortress!\" he wretchedly cried. \"Guys, I just want to point out,\" Jay gulped, setting me down to my feet but keeping one of his arms around my waist to support my weight. \"Um…we're out in the open now!\" \"Oh fuck!\" I shouted as we all looked around at the burning wasteland surrounding us. \"Shit, shit, shit!\" hissed Craig. \"Hey, hey, hey!\" James suddenly exclaimed, scrabbling around in his pants pocket. He triumphantly held up a set of car keys! \"My Prius!\" He pressed a button, and the familiar click-click of a car unlocking echoed out. I almost collapsed with relief- we had a way out of here. Or not. Because as we all turned to look where the car was parked, a huge, scaly winged demon landed on top of the shelter the car was under. It let out a huge squealing roar, looking right at us. \"What is that?!\" exclaimed James. \"Demon!\" I squawked. \"Demon! Demon! Demon !\" \"No fucking way!\" breathed out Seth. \"Well, that's it,\" I sighed, defeat dripping from every syllable. \"We're screwed. Goodbye, you assholes. It's been nice knowing you all.\" The demon let out another roar. Then Craig spoke. \"I got this.\" All of our heads whipped round in disbelief. \" What ?\" said Jay. \"I'll distract the thing,\" Craig replied. \"I'll run over there, screaming and shit, and that should give you enough time to get to the garage.\" \"Well yeah, but that thing can kill you!\" Seth said quietly. \"Maybe I deserve it,\" said Craig. \"I've been shitty my whole life, being selfish, only doing shit for me. Maybe it's only right that the last thing I do, on this planet, isn't for me.\" He looked at us all. \"It's for you guys.\" \"Craig, you don't have to do that-\" Jay began, but Seth cut across him with, \"Thank you very much, Craig. I appreciate that.\" \"Seth!\" I shouted angrily at the same time Jay muttered, \"You spineless…\" \"I love you guys,\" Craig told us, looking close to tears. \"You're my best friends.\" \"You're a real mensch, Craig,\" James said in a low voice. \"See you on the other side,\" Craig said, and his tone had an air of finality to it. He really was going to do this. Tears were falling thickly and freely down my face now, and Jay placed his other arm around me and gave me a comforting squeeze. It didn't really help all that much. Suddenly, Craig began to run off, screaming obscenities at the demon as he did so. He was waving his arms and his towel around frantically, trying to get the demon's attention. As much as I really didn't want it to, Craig's plan worked, as the demon very quickly turned its attention to the easy prey. In the time the demon had its eyes locked on Craig and away from us, James, Seth, Jay and I managed to sprint our way over to the car, Jay having to give me a piggyback due to my ankle. He dropped me down gently and we both climbed into the backseat, James driving and Seth taking shotgun. \"What's he gonna do?!\" whispered Seth as we watched fearfully out the window. Craig was yelling something we couldn't hear, and he sudden began to run towards the demon, spinning his towel around his head like it was a pair of fucking nunchucks or something. \"No, no, no, no!\" I whimpered as the demon lunched. \"Craig!\" But suddenly, with no warning whatsoever, as the demon went to bite Craig's head off, a blindingly bright beam of blue light spurted down around Craig, sealing him in a cylinder of light. The demon jerked back as if scalded, flying off into the night. \"It worked!\" gasped Jay. \"What's happening?!\" asked James. \"The Rapture,\" I whispered, hardly believing my eyes. \"Craig!\" shouted Seth. \"Craig!\" The man in question was slowly being lifted up above the ground, high enough for James to drive the car right under him. Jay and I looked out the back window to see Craig go shooting up into the sky, disappearing in another burst of light. \"Holy shit!\" spluttered Seth. \"Do you guys realise what this means?!\" \"That Craig was an angel this whole time?\" replied James, and I kicked the back of his chair with my non-injured foot. Moron. \"No, it means we can still be save!\" said Jay. \"I don't fucking get it. Why does Craig get saved?\" demanded James. \"I mean-\" \"Craig sacrificed himself for us!\" interrupted Jay. \"Which means there's still hope! That means we can be redeemed!\" \"It means that if we're actually nice to each other, we can get sucked up into Heaven, too!\" concluded Seth. \"That's the deal!\" \"Alright, I got it,\" said James. \"Let's just head out to my place in Malibu, just survive long enough until we do enough good things and they accumulate, or do enough sacrifices, and we'll all to Heaven together.\" \"That's a great idea, James!\" said Seth, his voice overly chipper. \"Seriously! Really, really good idea! Really, you're such a smart guy!\" \"Thanks Seth!\" James replied with a false laugh. \"You're such a nice guy! You've got a great smile.\" \"Thanks man!\" \"And an awesome laugh!\" \"I've heard it's annoying!\" \"How about that Jay back there, man?\" Okay, now I knew that they were just doing this in an attempt to get Raptured. \"Come on,\" Jay said bashfully, and I looked at him disbelievingly. Surely he wasn't falling for this horse shit? \"You got a cool body,\" James told him. \"You can walk around with your shirt off anytime.\" \"And then there's Mackenzie,\" said Seth, looking at me in the inside mirror. \"You know, you're beautiful, you're hilarious. You're a great actress.\" I folded my arms, not even replying. \"All the guys want her,\" James put in, smiling at me in the same mirror in the most sarcastic way possible. Nice. Even now, I was still getting sniped at. \"It's not working,\" Seth suddenly said. \"This isn't working.\" \"What, you thought we would be Raptured already?!\" asked Jay incredulously. \"I thought it would happen already,\" Seth answered. \"You bunch of twats,\" I said scornfully. \"We've been talking nice! How the fuck does that get you into Heaven?\" \"Doesn't hurt to smile,\" said James, and that was when a huge RV smashed into the passenger side of the Prius. The speed the RV was driving at sent the car screeching back into a load of abandoned cars, totalling the Prius. When the car settled, James had smacked his head on the window, Seth had headbutted the dashboard and Jay and I had cracked our heads together with such a force I thought I was concussed for a moment. \"What the fuck?\" mumbled Jay as we all struggled to sit back up. \"Urgh, you guys okay?\" groaned Seth. \"Yeah, we fi-\" I began, when suddenly an entire troop of people stormed the car, smashing on the windows, yelling at us, ripping open the doors and dragging us out of the vehicle. \"Oh my God! Get the fuck off me, you ugly bitch!\" I snarled at the blonde chick who had me in a headlock, so she grabbed hold of the hair on my scalp and hauled me into a standing position, forcing all my weight down onto my injured ankle. I howled in agony, so the blonde punched me in the jaw. The four of us were forced over into the middle of a patch of abandoned cars, the psychopaths around us continuously punching us, kicking us, scratching us. Blood was dribbling into my eyes from where the blonde had torn out a handful of my hair from the roots, and from a cut where some other random had cracked me in the forehead with a rock. \"Yo, cut his fucking head off!\" one of the psychopaths yelled, and I heard the chilling sound of a chainsaw revving up. We began to scream more then, struggling even harder, when another voice penetrated the night. \"Stop!\" I was nearly sick when I realised I recognized the voice. The RV door opened, and a chunky figure stepped out. He was wearing a torn up, filthy tuxedo, Nikes, a necklace of keys and sunglasses, and he had a crown made of half a skull on his head. In his hand he held a dog leash. Danny McBride. \"Danny?!\" said Jay, looking and sounding disgusted. \"What the fuck?!\" Danny exclaimed delightedly. \"You guys are still alive?\" \"Er, yeah!\" I shouted. \"Holy shit, I didn't expect that!\" He tugged on the dog leash and grunted, \"Get the fuck out here!\" Now I really was sick, spitting a mouthful of it on Jay's leg by mistake, because on the end of the lead was a half-naked man wearing a Mexican wrestler man. \"Shit, I can't believe you guys are here,\" Danny continued as the man started to hump his leg. \"That's fucking crazy, and your timing couldn't be more perfect.\" \"What the fuck are you on about, McBride?\" I said angrily, glaring at him. \"If you think we're joining your fucked up cult then you so have another thing coming.\" \"No, no, little Mackenzie,\" he chuckled. \"You clearly misunderstand me. See, it's been a long time since any of us have eaten, and you four look…delicious.\" \"What does that have to do with us?\" demanded Jay. \"The fuck are you talking about?\" spat James. Danny laughed again, and the sound turned my stomach. \"I'm a cannibal, hombre! We're gonna fucking eat your ass!\" \"Fuck you, you can't eat us!\" Seth exclaimed furiously. \"Fuck that, man!\" \"I do whatever the fuck I want, when I want!\" Danny informed him. He pointed at Wrestler Mask. \"I butt-fucked this dude!\" He jerked the leash again, and…oh God…I don't really want to go into detail about what the man did, but rest assured, it was not pretty. \"See that? I fucking slide right in that shit. I do whatever I want! This is my gimp! Channing, introduce yourself!\" My eyes widened in revulsion. Surely he couldn't mean…no…that wasn't…it couldn't be. The man removed his mask. It was. Danny's bitch was Channing Tatum. \"Hey, what's up, guys? Y'all cool?\" he said nonchalantly, like it was perfectly natural for us to all be meeting up in this situation. \"That's Channing Tatum!\" said James. \"That's Channing Tatum, dude!\" added Seth. \"What the fuck!?\" \"Congratulations, Franco. Rogen,\" I said mordantly. \"Way to point out the goddamn obvious!\" \"Channing fucking Tatum!\" Danny said with sadistic glee. \"I found wandering on the freeway. I collected him, made him my bitch! Get off my dick,\" he added, brushing Channing off. \"I call him Channing Tate-yum!\" \"Hardcore, man,\" said James, grimacing. \"I got him trained good,\" said Danny. \"Watch, he does tricks!\" As Danny demonstrated his new pet to us, James whispered, \"Alright. I'm gonna create a diversion.\" \"Yeah?\" Seth whispered back. \"You, Jay and Mackenzie make a run for it,\" he hissed. \"Wait, what?!\" I whisper-cried. \"Danny's gonna eat you!\" Seth reminded him. \"Listen,\" James whispered. \"Full-on sacrifice for you, dawg. Like the ending to Pineapple 2 .\" \"James, you can't!\" I said tearfully. \"Please! I'm sorry for everything I've done, I am! I love you, man, you're my brother! You can't just die! I need you!\" \"Hey,\" he said gently, squeezing my hand. \"It's gonna be okay. I'm sorry too. I was just so fucking angry, Kenzie. You're right, it wasn't any of my business. I shouldn't have got involved. I love you too, little sis.\" \"James, please-\" I started, but Danny's voice cut through me. \"That's Channing fucking Tatum, dawg!\" We looked back as Channing removed his mask again. \"I love him,\" he said, sounding completely mentally broken. \"Fucking GI Joe, dudes,\" Danny said smugly. \"Fucking loves me.\" \"Danny!\" yelled Seth. \"We're friends! You can't eat us!\" \"I'd love to catch up,\" Danny said sarcastically, \"But we're fucking starving, so…LET'S EAT!\" The cannibals swarmed on us, revving chainsaws and brandishing hammers. James suddenly yelled, \"Fuck you!\" and seized hold of a brick on the floor, smacking the nearest psycho in the face with it. \"Run!\" he shouted at us, taking on the rest of them. So that was what we did. Jay, Seth and I ran as fast as we could as James stayed behind taking on every single cannibal in Danny's cult. My ankle was giving me hell, but I pushed myself as hard as I could, breathing through the pain that was making tears leak from my eyes like a faucet was on. \"Man, we should go back!\" Seth was saying as we slowed to a stop. \"We should go back and help him!\" But suddenly, the blue beam of the Rapture engulfed James, the light illuminating everything around it. \"Holy shit!\" cried Jay. \"It worked!\" gasped Seth. James was lifted up about a metre from the ground. We could hear him shouting something, but at this distance it was incoherent. Then we saw him raise both his hands, which were set to flipping Danny off. Then he made an ejaculating gesture. The light suddenly vanished as abruptly as it had appeared, dropping James straight back into the middle of the cannibals. No! \"Oh, shit!\" hissed Seth. Danny started to advance on James, crouching down next to him as the cannibals around him began to get restless. He suddenly lunged, and even from here I could see that he had sunk his teeth into James' face. \"James!\" I screamed, my heart shattering apart. \" James !\" The rest of the cannibals mobbed him, and James began screaming in sheer agony. A full-out sacrifice…like the ending of Pineapple 2… I think Mandy should have like a total change of heart… she sees Saul going to sacrifice himself and like steps in at the last minute to try to save him… James was right. This was the ending of Pineapple Express 2 . I didn't even have time to reconsider this. \"James!\" I screamed again, and I started sprinting towards the cannibals, seizing a ragged strip of metal that was lying on the ground by my feet before I did so. My sprint was more of a rapid hobble, sending pain shooting up my leg so often I thought I was going to explode. I could hear Jay and Seth yelling behind me to get me to go back to them, but I ignored them completely, clutching my crude weapon even tighter. I could hear the sickening squelchy noises as the cannibals bit into James again and again, and I was finally there, battering away the cannibals as much as I could, feeling a sick sort of pleasure as I felt the ragged end of the metal tear through their skin. \"Have it, you motherfuckers!\" I screeched, feeling blood splattering against my face with every blow I delivered. A pair of hands suddenly seized me, and I felt myself being lifted up, then thrown violently to the ground. I landed right next to what was left of James. I couldn't even recognize him. He was missing his nose, an eye. Bits of his cheeks had been torn clean away, and part of one of his eyelids was gone too. This isn't even mentioning the state of the rest of him. I didn't look for long enough, because my stomach was churning so violently I was about to puke again, but I think one of his legs was gone, as was most of his abdominal area. I looked at his…um, I guess I could call it his face, and he looked at me with the eye he had left. \"Kenzie,\" he wheezed, and his eye glazed over. He was gone. James Franco was dead. I'd been too late. \"NO!\" I howled, just as Danny came into my eyeshot, grinning down at me. \"So you decided to join the party after all, Kenzie!\" he exclaimed with childish amusement. He looked around, taking in the sight of his followers. Most were up, very much alive and moving despite the deep cuts to their chests and faces, but I'd managed to straight up kill two of them, slicing one's throat and full-out decapitating the other. Danny frowned at me, tutting. \"Look at that, Kenzie, you've killed two of my best men.\" \"You motherfucker!\" I hissed at him. \"You killed James, Danny! You fucking ate him! How could you?\" \"Very easily,\" he replied mockingly. \"Just like it will be easy to eat Jay and Seth when my people catch up to them. Maybe I'll make you watch.\" \"Please,\" I scoffed. \"Like you'll keep me around long enough for that. You're just gonna eat me now, aren't you?\" Danny laughed darkly. \"No, Kenzie, I'm not. See, Channing over there is getting a bit boring now, a but same-old, same-old. I need to get myself a new little plaything.\" He crouched down, kneeling over me, his face barely five inches from mine. I gagged. \"You keep the fuck away from me, McBride, or I swear to God-\" Danny laughed again. \"Yeah, because God's been sooo helpful to you. Come on, Kenz.\" He pressed himself down on me, his weight keeping me pinned down. \"You know I've always had a thing for you, and I know you secretly always have for me.\" I spat upwards, hitting him straight in the eye. His face contorted in anger. \"You shouldn't have done that, babydoll!\" His hands dropped to my shorts, and I could feel his stubby fingers grappling with the zip. \"No, no!\" I cried, thrashing about underneath him. \"Stop it! Get the fuck off me! Stop!\" \"Don't be selfish, Kenz,\" he chided me. \"You gave it up for Jay, now it's my turn!\" I squeezed my eyes shut as I felt Danny tear my zip open. \"I'm sorry James,\" I whispered. \"I'm sorry Jay, I'm sorry Seth! I'm sorry I couldn't save you!\" Danny's hands were at the waistband of my shorts, beginning to pull them down, and my eyes snapped open when that great beam of blue light shot down from the sky, knocking him twenty feet away from me. Oh my God! Yes! YES! I'd done it! I was being Raptured! I didn't know if it was for my attempted saving of James, or my heartfelt apology, or what! But I'd done it! I was going to Heaven! As I felt myself being lifted up from the ground, I looked at Danny, who was gaping at me and screaming in fury. The urge to scream abuse at him and flip him off was so, so high, but I had a feeling that was exactly why James had been left behind, so I kept my mouth firmly shut. I hovered about five feet above the ground for a few moments, and suddenly I shooting upwards, towards a big, white hole in the clouds. A burst of white light overwhelmed me for a moment, and then…then there was darkness. A/N- Yay! She got Raptured! Finally, something good has actually happened to poor old Mack! This chapter turned out way longer than intended. So, what did you think? I'm especially curious about what you though about my take on the exorcism, with Mack's added knowledge, and also what you thought about how she was actually Raptured. If you were ever gonna leave a detailed review, I'd love it to be now! Much love, and I'll be cranking out the final- yes, final - chapter as soon as I can! Xx Gee xX[Chapter 13] A/N- So here it is. The chapter of the finale type. But this is not the time for sorrow. That's for the end A/N. Instead, lots of lovely final thanks to ShyKitten, Im Kind Of Important, Morgan, LunaEvanna Longbottom, Xxhope4thebestxX and Firework's Feelings(x2)! Chapter Thirteen- Wake Up, The Party's Over Now I yawned and stretched, rolling over in bed and keeping my eyes shut against the sunlight. Holy fuck, what a weird-ass dream. I mean, an apocalypse? Demons? Possession? James and Jonah dying? That's some whacked shit. Still, I'd had weirder dreams. There was that one about clowns stealing my kitchen so they could make some soup…but you don't need to know about that. I threw my arm out, groping along the mattress so I could give Dave a thump and wake him up too. But instead, all my hand found was something that felt fluffy, powdery, watery and solid, all at the same time. I opened my eyes. I was looking up at a picture-perfect blue sky, the kind that stretched over Miami on a perfect summer's day. There were no clouds in this sky. I sat up suddenly, gripping at the mattress underneath me, realising why there were no clouds in the sky. It was because I was sitting on the clouds. It all came flooding back to me like a punch to the face. There really had been an apocalypse. There really were demons. James and Jonah were really dead. And Danny…Danny was a sick bastard who deserved to be trapped down on Earth for the rest of his miserable fucking existence. I placed a hand on my forehead, feeling for the cut one of the cannibals had inflicted me with to see if it was still bleeding. I probed and probed and probed, but I realised that it wasn't there. It had…healed. I looked down at myself, looking for the rest of the abrasions I'd received on Earth. Instead, all I saw was white. My clothes were entirely white, and repaired too. My tights were white and ladder-free, my camisole white and stainless. The zip on my white shorts was fixed like Danny's assault had never happened. Even my white leather jacket had been repaired. The only thing that was strange was my boots. White was only splattered up them, the tops still black. What, had they ran out of whiteness for me? I gingerly climbed to my feet, still waiting for that fiery pain when I put my weight down on my sprained ankle, but it never came. Even that was fixed. I held my hands out in front of me, and the nails were rounded out, the skin around the beds smooth and new. Even my hair was clean and silky when I ran my hand through it. I truly was a new woman. I stepped forward, then I took another step, and another, walking through the thick shroud of white mist in front of me. A gate gradually emerged in the haze, big and tall and golden. And clichéd. I approached it frowning, unsure really where to go from here. Was I supposed to knock? Wait for the gates to open? Locate the reception desk? I stood there in front of the gates, dithering for a good few minutes. Then I decided to just take the initiative: I reached out and pushed the gate open. It didn't take much force; once I pressed even mildly on the gates, they just swung open by themselves. I took a couple of steps inside, craning my head around to see if I could catch sight of anything other than the thick smog I was standing in. Then I realised something. I could hear…music? \"What the fuck?\" I muttered, trying to squint through the mist and seeing absolutely jack shit. \"HELLO?!\" I shouted. \"Kenzie?\" I heard a voice calling me, though it was hazy, and I couldn't completely recognize it. All I could hear was that it was deep and male, with a vaguely throaty quality to it. \"Kenzie? Is that you?\" \"Um, I want to say yes, but I can't actually see whoever you are!\" I called in the direction of the voice. \"Kenzie! It's me!\" The voice was closer, and I saw a person-shaped shadow moving through the fog towards me. Oh my actual God! I suddenly knew why I recognized the voice! Oh my God, it had been so long…! \"Dave!\" I cried, beginning to run towards the shadow. \"Dave!\" \"Kenzie!\" he shouted again, and I saw the shadow start to run too. We met in the middle, taking hold of each other by the shoulders, just looking at each other like we couldn't even comprehend that the other one was actually there. He looked just like he always had, decked out in white jeans and a white t-shirt. \"Is it really you?\" I breathed, hardly daring to believe my eyes. I removed one of my hands from his shoulder and placed it over his face, pressing around like I was kneading bread. Dave laughed and kissed my palm. I could feel him grinning. \"Yeah, it's really me, Kenz.\" \"No!\" I shouted, horrified, stumbling away from him. \"Please, babe, do not call me 'Kenz' ever again!\" Just the mere thought of anything that would remind me of Danny McBride made me feel sick. I could still hear his voice as he'd tried to rape me. Don't be selfish, Kenz. You gave it up for Jay, now it's my turn. \"Woah, Mack! What's wrong?\" Dave asked anxiously. A golden halo was positioned above his brown wavy hair, glinting in the sunlight. He was an angel. And I wasn't just being all sappy with a pet name, he was genuinely an angel . Did that mean…? I reached up above my head, and sure enough, my hand came into contact with a smooth, metallic object. It was icy but hot at the exact same time. I couldn't describe it, but it felt incredible. \"Some, um, fucked up shit went down on Earth,\" I explained, dropping my hand to brush my hair out of my eyes. \"Wait. Surely you saw what it was like down there? How long did it take for you to be Raptured?\" \"I wasn't left behind for long,\" he replied. \"We were about to start filming again when all the earthquakes hit. One of the producers had brought their kid on set, and she was trapped in a trailer that had been knocked over. I busted open one of the windows to get her out. A tree nearly fell on her but I pushed her out of the way. That was when those weird blue lights came down.\" \"Well, it's nice for some.\" I couldn't stop myself from sounding snappish. \"I've been trapped down there in your brother's house for almost two weeks! I've almost lost my mind!\" \"Fuck. Yeah, of course. You were at James' party,\" Dave said. \"Where is he? Is he still on Earth?\" Shit. \"Dave…I don't know how to tell you this,\" I said gently, biting my lip uncomfortably. \"James is…he's dead, babe.\" \" What ?\" Dave spluttered, looking aghast. \"What the fuck happened!?\" \"Okay, the first thing you gotta know is that things were fucking insane down there!\" I said quickly. \"Okay? Now me, James, Seth, Jonah, Jay, Craig and Danny had been trapped like rats for fuck knows how long. We basically hated each other by the end! But we chucked Danny out of the house, and he resented that…\" \"Kenzie,\" Dave said urgently. \"Please just tell me what happened to James.\" I sighed. \"Okay. The house burned down, we were out in the open, Danny and his crew of psychopathic cannibals turned up and basically…Dave, Danny ate James.\" \"Oh my God.\" Dave looked like he was going to be sick. \"I'm sorry, babe,\" I said helplessly. \"I tried to help him, I really, really did! I ran back, I- I beat the cannibals away. But I was too late. I was just too late.\" He didn't cry. That was the first thing I noticed. I didn't know if it was a man thing or what, but Dave just didn't cry. It was like he'd gone into shock or something. I pulled him into a tight hug, putting my arms around his shoulders as he put his around my waist. It only then occurred to me that I was still wearing my four-and-a-half-inch Louboutins; I towered above my boyfriend. I impatiently kicked off the shoes, letting my feet settle into the odd consistency of the clouds. Oh shit . A realisation hit me. I had to tell Dave about me and Jay. I couldn't let it stew away until it blew up in my face again. But…I'd just told him about James. I couldn't dump this on him now ; how heartless would that be? But at the same time, I'd be hurting him if I kept it from him. I had to tell him. There really was no choice. \"Dave, there's something else I need to tell you,\" I said hesitantly. \"What is it?\" His voice was astoundingly calm, considering his big brother had died. I inwardly sighed. Time to burst that bubble. \"Right, but I'm begging you,\" I said, not making eye contact with him. \"Just don't start yelling and screaming at me. I totally understand if you end up hating me after this, but just don't shout. Please. I got enough of that when I was trapped down in that hellhole.\" \"Kenzie, just tell me.\" I took a deep breath. \"Okay. So, a couple of months ago, when you were away promoting, I had one of my…episodes.\" Dave knew exactly what I meant by that: we often referred to the outbursts I had when I was angry/stressed as my 'episodes.' It had started in 2008, after I got so high and wasted because of the stress of my workload that I smashed up my neighbour's car with a brick, resulting in my community service. Dave and I had only been together for about a month or so, and it was a side to me that he had never seen before. I'd scared him- a lot. So much so that he booked me into therapy, which I undertook for the rest of that year. I didn't want to refer to what had happened as a 'psychotic outburst,' so Dave started to say that I'd had an episode. I'd had two more episodes since then. One was in 2011, after I discovered that I had miscarried Dave's and my baby at six weeks pregnant. The fallout from that one was so nuclear that I'd ended up flying home to my dad in Amityville, leaving Dave behind in LA for a week. The other was in 2012, during the filming of 21 Jump Street . It was during a kind of prickly patch in our relationship, and I- totally unreasonably- became convinced that Dave was cheating on me with the actress playing Molly. Irony, right? Obviously, I confronted him about it, despite the fact there was zero evidence to support my paranoia. The result was a screaming match between the two of us which was so violent that the scene Jonah and Channing were filming had to have 'cut' called because all they could hear was us, and Dave and I didn't speak for two whole days. That was made even more awkward by the fact that on both of those days, Dave and I had a lot of scenes together, including a sex scene. But this had been my first episode without Dave there to calm me down. He'd even been there in 2012. I'd tried to deal without him, but I just hadn't been able to cope. \"Oh God,\" was all he said now, because he knew that whatever I was about to tell him would be pretty bad. \"You didn't know, I get that,\" I said. \"But you were out of town on the anniversary of Mom dying, and you know how I get on that day. I was drinking from like, half nine that morning. By eleven, I was totally slaughtered. I was upset, I was angry, and I'd already broken three plates and snapped Nebula's water bowl in half.\" Nebula was our girl kitten. We had…er, did have four cats in total, and the three boys were named Star-Lord, Parker and Castiel. As you can tell, my fangirl side took over. \"Then in the afternoon, Jay called me,\" I continued. \"He was in LA, and he wanted to surprise me. I…I started crying at him down the phone, and he got all concerned and shit and asked me to go down to the Four Seasons to see him. He didn't know how utterly fucked up I was until he saw me. We went up to his suite, and he was trying to calm me down. But…I don't know, I guess I must have forced him to have some drinks with me, because soon he was almost as wasted as I was, and we…we…\" I wanted Dave to finish my sentence, for him to give some indication that he'd worked it out so I didn't have to say it aloud. But all he did was stand there almost impassively, his hands shoved in his pockets. So I had to say it. \"We slept together.\" There was a pause, a pause so long I thought Dave had gone deaf or something that had prevented him from hearing me. \" What ?\" he finally said, and his tone was hard as nails. \"Please don't make me say it again,\" I whispered. \"You had sex with Jay when I was in New York?\" I nodded once, launching into a rapid, tearful explanation. \"I'm so, so sorry, Dave! You can't even begin to imagine just how sorry I am! It was a total, complete mistake! I regretted it as soon as it happened! Both of us did!\" \"That didn't stop it from fucking happening!\" he shouted at me, and I cowered away from him. \"I know! Okay! I needed someone to hold me and tell me it would be alright! But you weren't there! You weren't there , Dave! And I know that doesn't make it right! Nothing can make this right! But…but…Jesus Christ, I just need you to know how truly sorry I am! I love you so much, Dave, more than I can ever tell you! I hate myself for doing this to you, I have for the last two months! I totally understand if you want to break up now, because I'd want to dump me too, but I just want-\" Dave very effectively cut off my babbling by putting his hands on my hips, pulling me towards him and kissing me. I instantly shut up with a, \"mmph!\" noise. I closed my eyes and laced my hands together at the back of his neck, leaning into the kiss that carried on for a good forty-five seconds. \"What was that for?\" I murmured when we surfaced, neither of us letting go of the other. \"You fucked up,\" Dave replied. \"You really fucked up. I'm pissed that you let that happen, but I still love you, Kenzie, and as far as I'm concerned, what happened on Earth, happened on Earth. Let's just forget about all that shit and start again.\" \"Really?\" I whispered. \"How can you still love me after that?\" \"Because you're my dream girl,\" he said with a grin, quoting one of the Funny Or Die videos we'd been in. \"And you're my dream boy,\" I said, kissing him again. \"So. Why don't you show me what the rest of Heaven looks like?\" Well, they certainly missed out this little fact during Religious Studies at school. Heaven was one big motherfucking party! There was music blarin', drinks flowin', people dancin' and weed blazin'. I looked around, but I couldn't see any of the people who had been at James' party and fallen into the hole. Fuck, it looked like they really were chilling with Satan. \"Y'know, I was really expecting more white feathery wings and choirs,\" I said to Dave as we pushed our way through the crowd hand-in-hand. \"A blonde chick with feathered hair twerking to Turn Down For What isn't quite what I was thinking.\" \"Nothing about this is exactly normal, is it?\" Dave asked as we reached a small clearing in the throngs of people, bending down and scooping up a small grey cat. A very familiar cat. \"Oh my God!\" I shrieked. \"Parker?! Dave, how-?\" \"It's Heaven,\" he reminded me, scratching Parker behind the ear. \"You can wish for anything and it's yours. I fucking wished for our cats.\" I looked down and saw black-and-white Star-Lord and brother and sister gingers Castiel and Nebula slinking around our ankles. I reached down and scooped up Cas, kissing him on the nose. \"We can really wish for anything?\" Dave nodded. \"Yup. Anything. Well, I'm pretty sure you can't wish death on someone, but you get the idea.\" \"Then can I be honest with you?\" I asked him. \"Isn't that what keeps relationships healthy?\" he quipped, and I kicked him in the shin. \"There's something I want more than anything in the world…\" I said. \"But if I wish for this…don't freak out? Okay?\" \"Um, okay?\" \"Promise?\" \"Yeah, I promise. Kenzie, what is it?\" \"This.\" I squeezed my eyes shut, and I wished, begged and prayed. There was a small popping noise at my feet, followed by a puff of smoke. Nebula and Star-Lord got freaked out and ran away, and Castiel and Parker hopped out of mine and Dave's arms and followed them. A wailing suddenly started up; small, high-pitched and tender. I looked down, crouching as I did so. I looked into the wicker basket at my feet, taking in the sight of my baby son. \"Holy shit,\" I heard Dave mutter as I reached into the basket and gently took the baby out, clutching him close to me, tucking his little blue blanket around him. Dave looked at me, then looked at the baby in my arms. \"This is what you wished for?\" \"I wished for us to be a family,\" I said quietly, looking at him through my lashes. \"Are you mad?\" Dave shook his head. \"No.\" He moved behind me, looking at our son over my shoulder. He reached out and stroked his little nose, and the baby blinked his big brown eyes at his daddy. \"He's beautiful.\" \"Yeah,\" I said, tenderly kissing the baby's forehead. \"Our son. What shall we call him?\" \"What do you want to call him?\" I thought for a few moments. Then, as I looked back at Heaven's gates, inspiration struck. \"I want to call him Noah.\" \"Noah?\" Dave repeated, grinning. \"I like it.\" \"Yeah…\" I said, looking at my son's curious face. \"Noah James Franco.\" \"I'm really starting to think I should have used a different wish!\" I said ten minutes later, totally frazzled. Noah just would not stop crying! From the size of him, he wasn't even newborn! He looked about three months old! \"Sing to him?\" suggested Dave, looking just as done in as I felt. \"Let him have his first taste of weed,\" came a deep, sassy voice behind me. \"Really loosen him up.\" \"Craig!\" I squealed, turning around as Noah wailed in my arms. \"You are here!\" \"Yes siree,\" he said smugly, taking a drag on the joint in his mouth. I was going to reply, when Noah started crying so hard I thought his head was going to pop, he went so red. \"My God, we should have done this the conventional way!\" I said desperately, cradling Noah so his head was resting on my shoulder, gently jiggling him up and down. \"At least we'd've had nine months to prepare!\" \"Wait,\" said Craig. \"Y'all mean this is your kid?\" \"He is,\" I replied, moving Noah round so he was facing Craig. I did this as gently as I could, because he had finally stopped crying and was beginning to yawn. \"Craig, meet Noah Franco.\" \"What's up, little man?\" Craig tapped Noah's tiny, scrunched up fist with his own. Suddenly, an almost deafening shimmering-like sound erupted around us, shaking the ground. Whilst the Heavenites around me didn't react at all, Dave and Craig included, I was totally caught off guard. I let out a scream, and Noah started crying again. \"What the fuck was that?!\" I cried, kissing Noah on the forehead and gently, \"Shh\"ing him a few times as I rocked him. \"Here, I'll take him,\" offered Dave, so I handed Noah over. \"It means someone's been Raptured,\" he explained as he played peek-a-boo with his son, who was giggling up a storm. Yup, he definitely was not a newborn. \"Really?\" I frowned. \"They need an announcement for that?\" \"Someone has to go and meet the person,\" Dave said. \"It's our boys,\" Craig piped up. \"Seth and Jay.\" \"How in the fuck do you know that ?!\" I exclaimed. \"Because I'm a motherfucking angel,\" he shot back, grinning. He waved his hands in the direction of the gates. \"Y'all coming or what?\" \"Damn straight, we are!\" I said, also grinning, taking a now-finally-sleeping Noah from Dave's arms and cuddling him close. The four of us meandered our way through to crowds, soon finding ourselves in the dense shroud of mist Dave and I had reunited in. The gates stood tall and glimmering, and as soon as we approached them, they sprang open. Jay and Seth were stood right outside them, both wearing dazzling white versions of the clothes they'd been wearing when they were Raptured. They looked dumb-foundedly delighted, neither of them able to drop their expressions of glee. \"Welcome to Heaven, motherfuckers,\" Craig smirked at them. \"Craig!\" they both cried, barrelling over to us, laughing like crazy people. \"Mack, Dave!\" There was a lot of cheering as we all embroiled in a large group hug. \"Hey, hey!\" I warned, placing a hand on Noah's chest, though thank God, he remained asleep. \"Watch my son, please, we've only just got him to sleep.\" \" Son ?\" Seth and Jay both repeated. \"Yeah,\" I said. \"It's a long story, cannot be bothered to go into all the details right now. But he's called Noah.\" \"Noah,\" said Seth, grinning at him. \"Are you all angels?\" Jay asked us instead, and he and Seth stared in rapture (see what I did there?) at our halos. \"Yes sir,\" answered Craig. \"That's so cool, man!\" Seth said excitedly. \"Congratulations!\" \"Oh! Fellas!\" Craig pointed above Seth and Jay's heads and clicked, and with a ping , they both had halos too. They spent a few moments pointing and gaping at each others, and trying to see if they could look at their own, finishing up by rubbing their halos together. \"Dude, this is so…what do we do now?!\" asked Seth. \"Why don't you step this way?\" I suggested dramatically, standing to the side. We led them back to Party Central, making light, easy conversations. I was worried Dave would say something to Jay, and though he was initially a little frosty with him, they were soon talking just as normally as ever. As soon as we hit the centre of Heaven, the eternal party was in full flow, and the five of us joined in with the dancing, though I had to be very, very careful not to wake Noah. \"Woah!\" Seth suddenly exclaimed, clocking Craig's joint. \"They got weed in Heaven?\" \"You tell me,\" Craig said mysteriously, and with another ping , an identical joint appeared in Seth's mouth. \"Holy shit!\" cheered Seth as Jay made various noises of appreciation. \"That's awesome!\" He reached up and pressed the joint to his halo, lighting it and taking a drag. \"That's insane, man!\" \"No, no, no. That's Heaven,\" corrected Craig. \"Anything you could think of is yours.\" \"How do you think we got our perfectly little family?\" I said, turning my head to give Dave a kiss, who grinned at me. \"So, anything?\" Seth said. \"Anything,\" I confirmed. Seth looked like he was thinking really hard about something for a moment, then ping . He was standing on a Segway. \"Holy shit, this is awesome!\" he said again, spinning the machine in a circle. \"Segway!\" cheered Jay. \"I've always wanted to ride one of these things!\" Seth laughed. \"Go ahead, Jay,\" Craig said. \"Make a wish.\" \"It can be anything you can think of,\" I said quietly, nuzzling Noah. \"Anything?\" Jay thought for a second. Then- \" Everybody. \" \" Rock your body. \" The music cut off completely, aside from one backing track. Everyone gasped, turning in the direction of five men who purposefully strode their way through the crowds of angels. \"What!\" exclaimed Craig. \"No. Fucking. Way,\" said Seth, his Segway disappearing. \" Everybody. Rock your body right. \" \"This fucking song!\" I muttered. \"Is that-\" began Dave. \" Backstreet's back, alright! \" The tempo really kicked up, and the Backstreet Boys settled in a large opening in the middle of the party. \" Oh my God, we're back again. Brothers, sisters, everybody sing. \" Everybody broke out in spontaneous dance moves around the group. Even I said \"to hell with it\" and started to join in. \" Gonna bring you the flavour, show you how. Got a question for you, better answer now, yeah. \" \" Am I original? (Yeah) Am I the only one? (Yeah) Am I sexual? (Yeah) Am I everything you need? You better rock your body now. \" Craig, Jay and Seth were really solo-ing it up, break dancing and making it rain. Dave and I started dancing together, and even Noah woke up in the middle of it and started laughing. \" Everybody (Yeah). Rock your body (Yeah). \" Suddenly, it was one huge flash mob. Every single angel in Heaven was dancing in synchronized movements. We all knew the dance moves, though how, I can't tell you. \" Everybody, rock your body right Backstreet's back alright, alright.\" \" Alright. Backstreet's back, ALRIGHT! \" Huge confetti cannons fired off from God knows where, and everyone was dancing and laughing and just generally having an awesome time. I looked at Dave, who had taken Noah from me and was tickling him and kissing him, and I realised something. I hadn't died down on Earth. I'd been born again in my own little slice of Heaven.

Xx Gee xX ","Summary":" A/N- Hi everyone! Summer holidays mean free time, and free time means new FanFiction ideas, hence w"},{"Movie":"Beverly Hills Chihuahua","Title":"Rivers of Love","Author":"Mellowberry","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5026529","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"Help!\" A woman screamed in terror. She was lying on her back right next to the door. \"My dog attacked me! And he's running away! Get him before he hurts someone else!\" Just then, a large dog wearing a pink dress bolted out the door. He half turned around and yowled, \"You were never my owner! And never will be!\" He lowered his head and began to chuckle ominously. \"I already have an owner, and I am going to continue what he told me to do.\" \"911! The police! Call the police! And make them get their police dogs! My dog will hurt everyone.\" The women screamed again. The dog snickered and snarled, \"Don't scream for those heroic, courageous police dogs.\" He spat the last four words. \"Not when one of them is going to die…\" He cackled in the sky, his foul breath poisoning the air around him. The dog tore his dress off, and ran down the street, the shadows engulfing him. Oooooo...Freaky...Who could be this mysterious dog? Please R&R;![Chapter 2] \"Hey Chloe, come catch me!\" Papi yelled as he began to run many laps around the swimming pool. Chloe rolled her eyes. \"Think about the puppies!\" She called back as sat on the soft grass surrounding the pool. \"Fine,\" Papi sat down beside her. \"You thirsty?\" \"Yes.\" \"Let's take a drink of water from the hole I dug yesterday, it's filled with water today since it rained yesterday. Or maybe we can drink from the pond.\" Chloe sighed, but with a small smile dancing on her lips. That's just like Papi. \"Um…Papi…. But that water is gross and bad. Why don't we drink some water that Viv left out for me?\" The two dogs headed towards the house as they continued to talk. \"You know what Papi.\" Chloe asked Papi. \"What?\" \"I sometimes wonder what Delgado is doing.\" ~~~~*~~~~ \"You see any suspicious activity, officer?\" Delgado's owner, Officer John, asked Delgado. Delgado made no noise as he knew a bark meant a yes. Delgado and Officer John were walking down the streets of Mexico to make sure nothing suspicious was going around. That was when Delgado saw her. A female German shepherd was prowling the streets with a distant look in her eyes. She was walking around and searching through every box that was around. \"You there!\" Delgado called. The German shepherd took one look at him and panic crossed her face. She quickly ran away, her tail between her legs. \"Stop! Stop! Come back!\" Delgado barked furiously at her. The look in her eyes, the way she moved, it was obvious she was lost. And I'm going to save her. ~~~~*~~~~ \"Maybe Delgado should have come with us. He could have been the guard dog, and protect our puppies.\" Papi said as he rolled around in a patch of dirt, making him appear more brown than he really was. \"I know.\" Chloe sighed. \"I tried to convince him…but no, he didn't listen. He also could have found a beautiful German shepherd around here to be his mate. You know, since this is Beverly Hills.\" \"I guess.\" Papi continued to roll in the patch of dirt. \"But he was always devoted to being a police dog, and still is.\" Chloe continued. She thought for a moment. \"And always will be.\" \"Just like how you are devoted to being a prissy Beverly Hills Chihuahua.\" Papi teased Chloe. \"Hey!\" Chloe narrowed her eyes and tried to bat Papi but missed when Papi leapt to his feet and pranced away. \"You better get in shape, Miss Prissy, with that fat belly of yours.\" Papi teased again. Chloe flattened her ears and was about to say something when Viv called her. \"Chloe! Dinner time!\" Viv called out. \"Ahhh. Time to eat. Want a portion?\" Chloe directed her questions at Papi. \"Sorry bonita. But Sam is gonna give me a meal and I don't want a full stomach.\" Chloe shrugged and wobbled away with Papi following. She walked into the estate and found a prime rib in her bowl. Chloe glanced at Papi and grinned as she saw the drool coming out of his mouth. As Chloe began to eat, Viv came up. \"Oh my, Chloe. You are getting fat. Maybe I should cut down on your meals. But that would be mean, right?\" \"I am NOT fat!\" Chloe retorted angrily, but knew Viv wouldn't understand. \"I am PREGNANT!\" \"She needs to take you to the vet.\" Papi sat down. \"So the vet can tell her you are pregnant.\" \"But my next appointment is in two months! And that means two months of less food!\" Chloe's cringed at the thought of that. \"Pretend you're sick tomorrow. That should work.\" \"Okay.\" \"Papi!\" Someone shouted. \"Oh, that's Sam calling me. It's time to go home. Bye mi corazon.\" \"Bye Papi!\" Chloe touched Papi affectionately on the cheek as Papi ran to Sam. Chloe watched as Papi went away. She then turned to Viv and stuggled to get into her lap. \"Oh Chloe. I remember when you could just jump into my lap.\" Viv sighed sadly as she picked Chloe up. \"You really are getting fat.\" I haven't updated this story for a long time! Sorry to the people that wanted me to. I know it isn't very exciting, but it's because it's just the beginning of a story, and usually the middle or something is the most exciting. In each chapter, there will at least be one part with Chloe's POV, and at least one part with Delgado's POV. Also, Italics means they are thinking. Remember, R&R;![Chapter 3] Delgado was out hunting for suspicious activity, again. But this time he sought out for someone… the German shepherd. And then he spotted her. She was rummaging through boxes again, and even the trash cans this time. I need to find out more about her. Delgado thought. Why does she remind me of Chloe so much? Delgado glanced at his owner and nudged his hand to let him know he would be away for awhile. When his owner gave a nod, he headed towards the filthy dog. Delgado quietly began to creep on her from behind. She was too busy to even notice anything. When Delgado finally was right behind her, he grunted, \"You there.\" The German shepherd spun around so quickly that Delgado thought he was seeing things. Her eyes darkened with pure terror and she shrunk back from Delgado's larger size. \"Don't hurt me!\" She squeaked. \"I'm a police dog.\" Delgado growled. \"I wouldn't hurt you. But what are you doing here? I haven't seen you around before. You must be new.\" \"I guess you can say I am new around…but actually…I am lost.\" The German shepherd admitted as she looked down with sorrow. Just like Chloe! Delgado thought with a jolt. No wonder why she reminded me of her! Chloe had that same look in her eyes when she was lost. \"Do you think you could help me go home?\" The German shepherd continued with some hope in her eyes. \"I live in San Diego…Hunters Glen.\" \"Tell me your name first.\" Delgado demanded. \"I am Delgado.\" \"I am Rio.\" Rio… Delgado thought as he whispered it. \"So…will you help me?\" Delgado was about to say no but couldn't. \"I'll help you.\" He uttered, immediately regretting it. Why did I say that!! \"Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! You don't know how much this means to me.\" \"I know, I know.\" \"So when do we set off? Now? Please?\" \"No. Tomorrow. Come stay with my owner and me. You'll be safer with us.\" The excitement died from Rio's eyes and got replaced by dread. \"Will your owner let me?\" Her voice quivered with a little fear and her body appeared a bit hunched. \"Of course he will. Here, follow me.\" Delgado padded away with Rio following him, looking unsure. \"There you are buddy.\" Officer John exclaimed as Delgado went up to him with Rio. \"Who's this? Is she your friend?\" Delgado just gave him a tail wag and licked his face to tell him that she was supposed to be with him. \"Well, I guess she can come with us…\" Officer John gave up. Delgado gave Rio an I-told-you-look and licked his owner's face again. Rio just gazed unsurely and followed Delgado. Delgado was just walking down the crowed streets when he felt something touch his ear. His first instincts as a police dog were to warn his owner of someone trying to attack them, but he quickly realized it was just Rio talking in his ear. \"You don't realize how much this means to me, do you? I am so very grateful.\" Rio whispered in his ear. \"Yeah, whatever,\" Delgado shrugged and just walked on. ~~~~*~~~~ Chloe was walking through the streets. Then she saw him. \"Delgado! Delgado!\" Chloe called after him. But Delgado didn't go to her; he didn't even look at her. Chloe got irritated. \"Delgado! Hello!! I'm here!\" Instead, Delgado began to run away from her. And as Chloe followed, he only seemed to get farther and farther away. \"Delgado…come back…I miss you….\" Chloe woke up with a start. \"Why did he run away…?\" She asked herself out loud. I'll miss you too, kid. But this isn't a good-bye, I'm sure I'll see you around. Chloe replayed what Delgado told her on the day she left him. \"He'll come, someday.\" Thump. Thump. Thump. Viv walked into Chloe's room, which had a cute little bed, with a plate of waffles in syrup. \"Breakfast!\" She announced cheerily. Chloe jumped out of her bed and walked over to the breakfast plate and remembered what Papi told her the day before. \"After I eat breakfast,\" She promised herself. Chloe quickly gobbled up her breakfast and launched her plan into action. She strolled out of the long hall and to the kitchen, where Viv was, and pretended to appear weak while groaning and whining. \"What's wrong, dear?!\" Viv quickly hopped out of her chair and kneeled down beside Chloe, looking and sounding rather concerned and alarmed. Chloe just decided to whine and groan louder. \"Oh dear!\" Viv pulled out her cell-phone and speed-dialed Chloe's vet. \"Hello. Look, this is no laughing matter. Chloe is feeling unwell now! I will be rushing to your clinic very soon, okay? Okay. Good. Bye.\" Viv placed her cell-phone back in her purse. \"C'mon Chloe. Time to go to the vet!\" Viv scooped Chloe off the floor and sped to the vet…going 20 miles faster than she should have. When she parked, her car screeched to a stop and almost flung Chloe off of her seat, or almost gave her a heart attack. \"C'mon girl.\" Viv placed Chloe in her purse and walked/jogged to the vet's clinic. \"There you are!\" Chloe's vet, Dr. Chase, greeted them as they walked into the large, white waiting that had fancy chairs. \"Let me check on Chloe.\" She took Chloe and took her into a room at the very end of the hall with a metal table. After doing a series of test, Dr. Chase was finished. \"There is nothing wrong with Chloe, Viv.\" \"Thank goodness! But why was she acting all uncomfortable?\" Dr. Chase patted Chloe's stomach and gave Viv a smile. \"Chloe is pregnant.\" \"Pregnant! But how…oh…right. Thank you.\" Viv took Chloe back and placed her back in her purse, also taking tips to give to the vet. \"Bye!\" Viv got into her car, and sped back home. ~~~~*~~~~ Delgado entered the house he was familiar with and headed straight to the kitchen. The counter was off to the right with the stove-top on top and cabinets above them. \"Meal time!\" Officer John said as he took two dog bowls and poured dog pellets in them. Then, he took another two bowls and filled them with tap water from the small sink located on the counter. He placed them gently in front of the two dogs. \"Food alas!\" Rio plunged her muzzle in the bowl and ate up her food in what seemed like ten seconds. \"You must have been starving,\" Delgado observed as he gave Rio a look of amusement, remembering back to when he became a lost dog. \"I was,\" Rio admitted, a cute smile radiating off her face. \"But I am not as hungry now.\" Delgado nodded and ate his food. Officer John came in and saw they had both finished. \"Come Delgado and….\" He thought for a moment or two and finally said, \"His friend,\" He led them into an extra room that was next to the kitchen and made sure they went inside. He then took the unfinished water bowls and put them into the same room and then closed the door. \"This is where I sleep,\" Delgado explained to Rio as he went into his dog house at the left corner of the room. \"You could sleep there,\" He pointed at a pile of mats at the opposite side of the room. \"Okay…\" Rio shrugged and sat down onto the mats and quickly fell asleep. Delgado thought about the days events and finally went to sleep. I am SO SORRY! I took such a long time to update it! Sorry! Since school is starting soon for me, I won't be updating it very much, please understand. Anyways, I hope you enjoy! Please review! And sorry if there are any mistakes.[Chapter 4] Nobody ever really reviews this story...I don't know if I should continue it. If I get at least 10 messages saying that I should continue it, then I will.[Chapter 5] Wow, I didn't realize how many people wanted me to continue o.o I'll continue then :D But I need to say all of these first... I haven't logged onto fanfiction for a loooong time! Sorry! I'll try to go on more now though since there's so many people that want more of the story. Also, I'm starting a new story about this manga called Vampire Game so I won't be able to focus all my attention on just this story. But I'll do all I can. Since I haven't updated this story for such a long time, I promise I'll put up the next chapter soon! And don't forget to review![Chapter 6] This is Chapter 3 for my story 'Rivers of Love'! Hope you enjoy! And don't forget to review to tell me what you liked/disliked about the story or if I made any mistakes. It was quite some time when I had written Chapter 2 and I might have forgotten some stuff about BHC. I'll try to put up Chapter 4 ASAP. Oh yeah, and one more thing...*Beverly Hills Chihuahua isn't mine. It's Disney's* But I think you all know that ;) Enjoy! Chloe woke up to find Papi gazing at her with a wagging tail. \"You came back!\" Chloe smiled and nuzzled him affectionately. \"Of course, mi Corazon. I always do, don't I?\" Papi replied with a wide grin. Chloe smiled up at him. \"Yes, you do,\" She admitted. \"But it's nice to have you greet me when I wake up.\" \"Chloe!\" Viv arrived at Chloe's room and set her bowl down right next to the fancy, white door with Chloe's name engraved in it. Chloe jumped off the bed, also careful to not mess her fur, and landed on the floor. Taking a quick whiff, she quickly realized it was bacon and eggs. Taking a piece neatly between her teeth, she took the bacon and swallowed it down eagerly. Glancing at Papi, Chloe noticed how he was staring at the food, his eyes saying just how much he wanted the delicious meal. Chloe nudged the bowl a bit closer to Papi. \"Eat some!\" She urged with a friendly grin on her face. \"I already ate but…\" He looked down at the bowl, \"Well…a little won't hurt,\" He plunged his muzzle into the bowl and looked satisfied when he lifted it up again. \"The rest I will leave for you, mi Corazon.\" He backed away from the bowl and jokingly gave Chloe a bow as she stepped up to the bowl. Looking inside, Chloe noticed how messy it was and was about to tell Papi to fix it when she remembered he wasn't a neat-freak, like her. Giving off a little sigh, Chloe ate the rest of the food up. \"So did you do it?\" Papi suddenly asked Chloe as he took a step forward, tilting his head slightly to the side. \"Did what?\" She questioned him, having no idea what he was talking about. She sat down and waited for his answer. \"You know, look uncomfortable or something to make Viv take you to the hospital,\" Papi stated patiently while gazing at Chloe's stomach in fatherly pride. \"Oh yeah, that!\" Chloe remembered now. \"Yep, I did. Yesterday. Everything went off well,\" Chloe paused for a moment. \"But Viv was in a rush to leave and I never got to find out when I'm supposed to give birth.\" \"Well, isn't that a shame? Oh well. At least now Viv knows you're pregnant rather than fat,\" Papi replied with a shrug. Chloe smiled at her mate. \"Yeah, I guess so.\" Delgado woke up with a start, getting to his feet and letting out a big yawn. He glanced over at the pile of mats in the corner and spotted Rio. At first, he was confused. Who's this strange dog doing in my house? He wondered. Then everything came back to him. Right. My promise. Padding up to the female German shepherd, Delgado nudged Rio gently with his muzzle to wake her up. \"Get up,\" He grunted as he let out another yawn. Blinking sleepily, Rio raised her head slowly, then let out a huge yawn. Looking around, she slowly began to remember where she was. \"Come on, we need to eat and then go straight on our way to…where was it again?\" Delgado questioned, tilting his head slightly to the right. \"San Diego…Hunters Glen,\" Rio gently reminded him. \"Right. I'll take you to a train that would stop at San Diego and then I'm sure you'll be able to find your way to San Diego,\" Delgado bounded over to the door to exit the room and went over to the kitchen. Opening a cabinet, he took large back of opened dog food out and pushed it on it's side, spilling a lot of the large bone-shaped pellets on the ground. \"Well, eat up!\" Rio just stood at the entrance of the kitchen, eyes a little wide at what Delgado had just done. But she shrugged it off and padded forward beside Delgado, beginning to eat the pellets one by one. When they finished eating all the pellets, Delgado went up to the sink, stood on his hind paws, and used his muzzle to turn the tap water on. Licking up his fill, he backed up and allowed Rio to finish. When she was finished Delgado closed the water off again. \"Come on, we need to get a move on,\" Delgado grunted as he turned to one of the doors and opened it, revealing outside of the house. The two dogs padded out of the house with Delgado leading the way. \"How did you learn to do all that stuff?\" Rio asked after walking for about ten minutes. Delgado looked up at Rio. \"I study the humans, and I'm a police dog. Part of being a police dog is to make sure humans are safe. If there ever was a human hurt and couldn't open a door or something like that, then I would be able to do it.\" Rio gazed up at him with a new-found respect in her eyes. \"Wow. That's so cool!\" Her eyes shone as she gazed up at Delgado. \"Oh, one more question…is it okay for you to just leave your owner alone?\" Delgado flicked his ears. \"He's used to having me sometimes run off with my own errands. He knows I'll eventually come back some time sooner or later.\" Rio looked interested but she didn't say anything. After padding on for another twenty minutes, Delgado noticed something posted up on a nearby streetlight. He went up to it and noticed it was another one of those 'lost pet' papers. But for some reason this dog looked familiar, but Delgado couldn't put his paw on it. Who is this? Delgado wondered as he racked his brain for the answer. Suddenly he remembered. El Diablo![Chapter 7] Yay! It didn't take me way too long this time to give you all the next chapter of Rivers of Love. Hmm...I'm wondering if I should change the name. Oh well, whatever. Anyways, enjoy the chapter! And please review! I only got one review since I put up chapter 3 you know, and I want more than that! I need to know that people are appreciating my story! So please review! Chloe smiled at Papi as she watched her mate swimming in the pool. \"Shame you can't join, Corazon,\" Papi apologized as he swam laps in the pool that was made specially for Chloe. \"It's a really hot day today and the sun sure seems blazing.\" \"Yeah, but it's nice enough to watch you swimming. And I've got my shade so I'm all good,\" Chloe replied with a happy smile. \"If that's what you say, Chloe,\" Papi smiled back at his mate and continued on. I have everything I want right now. My owner Viv…Papi as my mate…and now I'm pregnant with Papi's puppies! I don't think life could get any better. Except if Delgado suddenly showed up and decided to stay here. Chloe thought to herself. But for now, everything I want is here. Chloe watched as Papi suddenly narrowed his eyes, and the happy look from his face turned into a scared and afraid one. \"What's wrong?\" Chloe asked, alarmed at the sudden change of mood. \"Don't move, Corazon. Whatever you do, don't move,\" Papi was staring at something beyond Chloe, slowly swimming to the side of the pool and getting out. \"W-what's w-wrong P-Papi?\" Chloe stammered. The way Papi was reacting was scaring her, a lot. She wanted to see what was behind her but she didn't dare since Papi told her to not move. \"Whatever you do…don't move Chloe…don't move,\" Papi slowly stepped forward, eyes wide and determined. \"Please Papi, tell me what's going on!\" Chloe begged. She was scared and the way Papi was acting didn't help at all. Now, Papi was almost to her, standing in front of her but to the left. Before she knew what was going on, Papi suddenly jumped out just as a hiss sounded and a moan escaped his jaws. \"Papi!\" Chloe whirled around just in time to see the snake slithering away into the bushes and the bitemark on Papi's shoulder. \"No! I'll get Viv!\" Even with her stomach heavy with the puppies, Chloe sped to where Viv was, sitting on the sofa watching TV. \"Viv!\" Chloe knew that to Viv, that sounded only like a bark- but that was good enough. \"Hey Chloe, what's wrong? Where's Papi,\" Viv asked cheerfully as she turned her attention to Chloe with a smile. Chloe barked again, frustrated, and tugged at Viv's red skirt. Come on… \"You need to take me somewhere?\" Viv asked and Chloe barked again while nodding her head. Now sure that Viv was following her, she pelted ahead to Papi. \"Viv's coming! She'll drive you to the vet or tell Sam!\" Papi smiled up at her even though Chloe could tell he was in pain. He was just about to say something when Viv entered. \"What's this?\" Viv stepped up to Papi and saw the bite-mark on his side. \"Oh no!\" She took Papi in her arms, had a quick word with Sam, got into the car, and drove off at high-speed. Chloe just sat there watching them, giving off a little whine. Please be alright Papi! Please don't let it be a very poisonous snake! Please! Delgado stared at the paper for a few minutes, before Rio made him shake all his thoughts away. \"Delgado? What's wrong?\" She asked as she gazed at him, looking somewhat worried. She turned her attention to the 'lost pet' paper he was staring at and looked back at him. \"It's just like any paper that an owner would make for their lost pet. It's not like something's wrong or anything.\" Delgado shook his head with his eyes furrowed together and his mouth into a frown. \"No…you don't get it do you Rio? This dog, El Diablo, is an enemy of mine. If he's out and about on these streets then…well…who knows?\" Rio's eyes went wide. \"You can fight him though, can't you? I mean, you're a police dog and everything.\" \"Yes, I can fight him, but he'll be up for the fight. Let's not forget he's a Doberman, and those kind are strong fighting dogs, although not as strong as a Rottweiler. And he'll be coming back for some revenge, which would make him twice as determined to beat me. And let's not forget you here. If he somehow gets you alone…then…well…can you fight?\" Rio looked from side to side, worried and on edge. \"I never fought before…\" Delgado sighed. \"Then whatever you do, stay by my side.\" Rio smiled. \"Okay.\" Even though Rio seemed sure she would be able to stick to Delgado, he wasn't exactly sure. Rio seemed a bit on the curious side; which might cause trouble sooner or later. \"What's wrong?\" Rio's voice suddenly jolted Delgado out of his thoughts. Shaking his head to clear it, he replied, \"Nothing. Just remember to stay away from Dobermans for the time being.\" Rio nodded once as the two passed a policeman and his dog. Wait, that's Fernando! Delgado realized as he turned back. Like him, Fernando was a German shepherd, but a bit smaller in size. \"Hey Delgado. What's up?\" Fernando greeted him as the two dogs went up to him. He glanced swiftly at Rio and then back to Delgado with a questioning look. \"I'm taking this dog back to her home,\" Delgado barked. \"I need to double check something. Train to San Diego is that way, right?\" With his muzzle Delgado pointed down a narrow alley, a creepy looking place with mice scuttling about the ground. \"Sure is,\" Fernando nodded with his head. \"Now I need to get going,\" With a slight nod, he turned away and bounded over to his owner, who was calling his name. \"You know Delgado…are you sure it's that way?\" Rio looked queasy her eyes darting about the alley nervously. \"Yes, you heard Fernando. He said it was here too,\" Delgado walked ahead and stopped right at the head of the alley when he realized Rio wasn't following him. \"What's wrong?\" Rio glanced behind Delgado nervously. \"Well…let's just say I don't like that place very much…you see…I kinda met someone there…\" \"Come on, everything's gonna be okay. Remember, the sooner we get moving the sooner you reach home. So just man it up and get over here,\" Delgado was getting a bit impatient, and his tone showed it. \"Fine….\" Stepping forward, Rio followed Delgado down the alley until they reached a crossroad. Once again, Rio stopped. \"What is it this time?\" Delgado sat down as he sighed, twitching his tail. \"This is where I met that someone,\" Rio whispered, her eyes wide with fear. \"Who exactly is this…someone?\" \"Well…he's…\" The last thing Delgado saw was Rio's eyes go wide as if something or someone was behind him. Then everything went black. Oh my...I wonder if Papi will be okay! o.o And who was that? XD Anyways, I'll try to get the next chapter up as soon as possible. But school's starting real soon for me...and well...it'll definitely be keeping me busy. . But once again, I'll try ^_^ ","Summary":" \"Help!\" A woman screamed in terror. She was lying on her back right next to the door. \"My dog at"},{"Movie":"This is The End","Title":"More Than Distance Between Us","Author":"Starfire Tamaran","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10050012","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: So, I saw This Is The End last summer and I loved it so much that I decided to write a fic about it. However, I ended up deleting the fic halfway through but now I'm back with my own little \"reboot\" and I hope it'll turn out better than my last one did. I hope you guys like it! Review and let me know what you think! \"How do I look, babe?\" I stepped out of the bathroom and did a little twirl for him. My outfit of choice for James's party tonight consisted of a black halter top with lace up detail on the sides, black pants, and black studded over the knee boots. \"Very sexy,\" he grinned, eying me up and down. \"So, I texted Seth and I'm going to meet him and Jay at the airport in an hour. I'm gonna hang out with them for a bit and then come back when the party starts,\" I explained as I sat down beside him. \"Sounds like a plan. I think they're gonna love what I've done with the place,\" he said. \"Minus the dick statue,\" I snickered, lightly elbowing him. \"It's art! Plus, I find that it adds a good amount of masculinity to the place!\" he retorted. Note to self: don't ever insult James Franco's art unless you want him to have a bitch fit. \"Whatever you say, Harry Osborn,\" I laughed before getting up and walking towards the mirror. I grabbed my neutral pink lip gloss out of my bag, unscrewing the cap to take out the wand, applying it on my lips. James got up from the bed and walked over to me. Pulling my hair aside with one hand, he began to kiss my shoulder blade, moving up to suck and nip at the skin of my neck. I tilted my head to the side and allowed him better access. Alright, two can play at this game… I turned around and gripped his cardigan, \"I think you put this on wrong,\" I murmured, taking off and tossing it to the floor. Then, I took hold of his shirt. \"And you definitely put this on wrong,\" I pulled it over his head and threw it on the floor, letting him know what I was getting at. \"Let me guess, I put these on wrong too,\" he smirked, unzipping his pants. Then he leaned in to close the distance between our lips. I linked my fingers behind his neck and gripped his hair. James deepened the kiss and trailed his hands up and down my hips. I'd known James for about seven years now. We first met when I co-starred in Knocked Up, which is where I also met Seth, Jonah, Craig, and Jay. I knew Danny from Pineapple Express, Tropic Thunder, and a few episodes of Eastbound and Down. James and I didn't hit it off right away though. It wasn't until after the 'incident' with my now ex-boyfriend Michael Cera that we'd grown closer with each other… *Flashback* It was the 'Pineapple Express' after-party and almost everyone was here, everyone except Michael that was. He told me that he couldn't make it because he wasn't feeling well but I wasn't going to let it ruin my fun. After grabbing a drink, I walked over to Danny, Seth, Jay, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. \" Hey Anastasia, lookin' good!\" Danny chuckled, pulling me in for a hug. \" Why thank you, you don't look so bad yourself Daniel,\" I replied, hugging him back. \" Hey, where's Michael? I thought for sure he was gonna be here tonight,\" Chris said. \" Yeah , so did I. He texted me an hour before the premiere and told me he was puking his guts out and couldn't make it,\" I sighed. \" You know that's probably code for snorting cocaine right?\" Danny retorted, which earned him a slap upside the head from Seth. \" He doesn't do that anymore! I gave him an ultimatum and he promised me he'd never do it again,\" I argued. \" Bullshit, I'm sure he just said that so he could keep fucking your brains out.\" \" DANNY!\" Jay yelled, giving him a murder glare. Danny shrugged, \"What? I'm just being a good friend and she deserves to know the truth.\" I glanced over and saw that both Seth and Chris's eyes were wide as wide as baseballs. They looked like they'd just seen a ghost. \" Um, why do you guys look like you're about to have your dicks ripped off?\" I asked, raising a brow. \" U-uh, Anastasia there's I've been meaning to talk to you about... I think we should do a sequel to Superbad! W-wouldn't it be awesome if we did one?\" Chris stammered. Seth nodded, \"Y-yeah, that's a great fucking idea! I wouldn't mind reprising my role as Officer Michaels!\" Yup, they were definitely hiding something from me. They may have been great actors on-screen, but when it came to lying? They were fucking awful. \"Alright, what do you two know that I don't? Spit it out!\" I barked. Seth raised his hands in defense,\"W-we're not hiding anything!\" I sighed and ran a hand through my hair, \"Okay, I believe you. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna get another drink.\" I turned around and Jay stepped in front of me. \"I-I'll get it for you, what do you want? Vodka? Whiskey?\" he asked nervously. And insert me losing my shit in three, two…. \" What the fuck are you guys hiding from me?! Tell me NOW!\" I yelled, grabbing Jay by the shirt. Danny rolled his eyes, \"They're acting like morons for your own fucking good, Anastasia. If I were you, I wouldn't try to get past Jay. So quit your bitching and let him get your drink for you.\" \" Like hell I will!\" I shot back before shoving Jay out of the way. What I saw next I didn't expect. I now knew why Jay, Seth, and Chris were acting so weird. Standing only a few feet away from me was Michael. He was making out with some random girl and pretty much dry humping her. The sight tore me apart and I felt my heart breaking. Tears had already started to well up in my eyes. Seth lightly grabbed me by the arm, \"Come on Anastasia, I'll take you home,\" he said quietly. I shook my head and wriggled free from his grip. I drank the rest of my drink before tossing the cup aside. Then I stormed towards Michael, ignoring Chris, Jay, and Seth's protests. \"Guess you changed your mind about coming, huh?\" I hissed. Michael pulled away from the girl and looked at me. \"Hey baby, I was uhh, feeling better. How about w-\" he started to say but I cut him off by slapping him, HARD. \" Save it! How long have you been cheating on me Michael?! Cause I have a feeling this isn't the first fucking time!\" I spat, clenching my fists. \" Listen baby, we had a lot of fun together but I'm a man that has needs and you just didn't satisfy them, I'm sorry,\" he slurred, giving me a wink. I noticed that his pupils were dilated and that's when it hit me, he lied about quitting cocaine. \" You're sorry?! Well, I'm sorry too. Sorry that you just lost the one person that could love you more than you deserve.\" With that, I spun my heels and walked away from him. There was only one thing that could numb my pain right now. Alcohol. Lots of it. Once I had a few drinks in my system, I stumbled towards the restroom. I ended up bumping into James on my way there. \" Hey, you alright? I heard what happened with Cera back there,\" he said, concerned. I shook my head and giggled a bit, \"Never better! Good riddance to that douchebag! All he wanted from me was sex anyway, so fuck him!\" I pushed past him and opened the door to the restroom and slammed it behind me. I never knew how much it hurt to have your heart broken, until now. I sunk to the floor and buried my face in my hands as tears started to blur my vision again. I felt so pathetic. I didn't know what hurt more, Michael's words or the fact that he never stopped doing cocaine and had been cheating on me for God knows how long. Right now, all I wanted to do was curl up in a ball and eat a lot of ice cream. Then I heard someone knock on the door. \" GO AWAY!\" I screamed, hoping that whoever was there would do as told. The door burst open and James practically ran in. \"Look, Michael's an asshole for what he did and he didn't deserve an amazing girl like you.\" \"You really think so?\" I said softly, looking up at him. \"I know so,\" he replied solemnly. I wiped the tears from my eyes and smiled a bit. \"Mind if we get out of here? Maybe go back to your place and watch some movies?\" He helped me up and wrapped his arms around me, giving me the hug I really needed right now. \"Of course.\" I stared at him and bit my lip. Handsome was an understatement when it came to describing his looks. He was beautiful. Before I could stop myself, my lips crashed onto his. Feeling him not moving against me, I brought my hands to the back of his neck. That must've snapped him out of his trance because his lips began to move against mine. We were both panting by the time we pulled away. His brown eyes met my hazel ones as he cupped the side of my face, \"Look Anastasia, I don't think we should be doing this. It's not that I don't want to; to be honest I've liked you ever since we met on the set of Knocked Up, but you've had a shitty night and you're feeling vulnerable. Right now you'll do anything to make the pain go away. You shouldn't do this when you're upset.\" As much as I hated to admit, he was right. I just witnessed Michael practically having sex with some skank right in front of me and I was willing to do whatever it took to get my mind off it. The paparazzi pretty much hammered us with questions as soon as we walked outside. \"Anastasia Massaro!\" \"Anastasia, are you having an affair with James Franco?!\" \"Did you really cheat on Michael Cera with him?!\" \"How long have you been cheating on Michael?!\" \"We have a right to know!\" \" Just ignore them,\" James whispered in my ear as we both got in his limo. The next few days only got worse. Michael - being the douche that he is- told the paparazzi that I'd been cheating on him with James for months. TMZ, E! and Entertainment News were talking about it for weeks. I couldn't even go shopping without seeing magazines with pictures of James and I leaving the party and hanging out together at various places. People would ask me why I cheated on Michael with James and I'd tell them that it wasn't true and that he cheated on me. Some of them believed me and some didn't. The ones that didn't believe me were the ones that idolized him and couldn't take the fact that their so called 'idol' was a cocaine-addicted, manwhore. It wasn't until about five or six months after the fiasco with Michael that I'd started dating James. Of course, the media was all over that. Surprisingly though, I didn't care. For the first time in months, I was happy, probably the happiest I'd ever been. I laid against James's bare chest and sighed. As much as I wanted to do the whole 'cuddling after sex' routine that we always did, I had to go meet Seth and Jay. Sitting up, I leaned over and grabbed my top off the floor. \"If only we had time for the cuddling, or even round two,\" he winked at me. \"Don't worry, I'll make it up to you,\" I said playfully. \"Looking forward to it,\" he replied, pulling me in for one more kiss. Once I arrived at the airport I headed towards Jay's gate, trying to avoid the paparazzi as much as I could. Seth was already waiting by the door by the time I got there. \"What took you so long? I've been texting you non-stop,\" he said, raising a brow. I rolled my eyes. \"Seth, relax. Jay's not even here yet.\" \"… You had sex with Franco before you came here didn't you?\" he asked bluntly. \"Yup, and it felt soooo good!\" I crooned, referring to my favorite song by The Lonely Island. Seth started laughing at my random song outburst; his goofy laugh was enough to make me start laughing as well. \"Hey! I'm so happy!\" We both turned to see Jay jumping up and down like a little kid on Christmas. \"Jay!\" Seth and I yelled. Jay ran up and gave Seth a big hug first and then gave me one. \"It's so good to see you!\" I exclaimed. I rarely got to see him since he lived in Canada. \"I have the best weekend ever planned but I'm not gonna ruin it,\" Seth said as we turned and headed towards the exit. We got in Seth's car and I sat in the backseat while Jay rode shotgun. \"Alright, I've landed, I'm here, we've said our hellos… Can we please go to fucking Carl's Jr?\" Jay asked. \"Now that you mention it, a superstar burger with cheese sounds so fucking good right now,\" I agreed. \"Uh, I would love to but I can't really eat that stuff right now. I'm on this cleanse.\" Seth said proudly. \"You're on a what?\" Jay asked, shocked. \"A cleanse Jay, also known as the diet from hell,\" I said bluntly. Jay started laughing and Seth glared at us, obviously annoyed that we didn't agree with his new diet. \"It's good for you! You're supposed to take six shits a day!\" Seth spat. \"No you're not; you're supposed to shit twice a day!\" Jay argued. \"No, that's not true. That's what they used to think; now they know you're supposed to shit six times a day.\" \"So you're not drinking, you're not smoking weed, you're not-\" \"No, I'm drinking and smoking weed. I'm on a cleanse, I'm not psychotic!\" he exclaimed, \"Anastasia, back me up here. With all that modeling you do, I'm sure you've had to lay off on some foods right?\" \"Nope, I just exercise two hours a day, five days a week,\" I shrugged. \"Whatever, gluten is still bad for you. If you two stopped eating gluten, you'd feel way fucking better all day. Whenever you feel shitty, that's cause of gluten,\" he ranted. Jay and Seth continued to argue about gluten for about ten minutes before Seth finally gave in and took us to Carl's Jr. Once we were done with our burgers, we went back to Seth's house. \"So this is how the other half lives, amazing!\" Jay exclaimed as Seth gave us a grand tour of his place. It wasn't as big as James's place but it was still incredible nevertheless. \"I agree, you've really outdone yourself this time, Rogen,\" I said as I looked around. \"Alright, I have a little surprise for you two, get ready,\" Seth said as we walked into the living room. It took everything I had not to cry tears of joy once I saw what was on the table. On the table were starbursts, weed, a pipe, some video games, and Jay's name spelled in joints. \"Holy shit!\" I yelled happily before hopping onto the couch. \"Seth Rogen, you are just the best people,\" Jay said, smiling. \"You guys wanna see what else I got? A 3D television,\" Seth smirked and handed Jay and I some 3D glasses. \"No fucking way! This just keeps getting better and better,\" I grinned, putting them on. \"Let's get into it,\" Jay said eagerly. Seth picked up the pipe and put it in his mouth and started imitating Gandalf. \"Hello, little hobbit! Spark my Ganja! Ha! Ha! Ha! I'm a well-known, homosexual advocate!\" he said, causing Jay and I laugh our asses off. The next few hours consisted of us getting higher than kites, playing video games, and dancing to 'Everybody' by the Backstreet Boys nonstop. Then Seth and I told Jay about James's party tonight and he was pretty reluctant about going because he didn't know anyone there. We both managed to persuade him to go for us, plus Seth said that he was going to stay with him all night so he wouldn't feel left out. I just hoped that Seth wouldn't break his promise once we got there.[Chapter 2] A/N: I just want to give a big thank you to everyone that reviewed, faved, and followed this story. I'm really glad you guys like it so far! Yugioh13 – Thank you so much for leaving a review. Michael was such a tool in the movie and the worst boyfriend ever to Anastasia. She put up with his crap for two years and seeing him make out with another girl was the last straw for her. You're right though; James treats her better and definitely cares about her more than Michael ever did. samalama1993 – Thanks! The taxi pulled up in front of James's house and Jay and I stepped out. Seth paid the driver before stepping out as well. We walked onto the sidewalk and Seth and Jay's jaws practically hit the ground once they saw the place. James and I had only been living here for a few weeks or so and he told me that he wanted to have a housewarming party once we were all settled in. \"So, what do you guys think?\" I asked, enthused. \"Holy shit, it's amazing. You two have definitely outdone yourselves,\" Seth said, in awe. \"Just wait until you see the inside,\" I said excitedly as we walked through the yard. \"No offense, but I think it's a bit much,\" Jay said. \"I don't think it is a bit much, I think it's right on the money,\" Seth grinned. \"Yeah, and Channing Tatum lives right up the street,\" I gigged a bit. \"Which means that it's the sexiest street in America,\" Seth chuckled. Jay rolled his eyes, \"Jesus, will you two stop talking about Channing Tatum.\" \"Well, I think he's attractive,\" Seth argued. \"Couldn't agree with you more,\" I laughed. We walked up to the fogged glass door and Seth knocked. The door swung open a few seconds later and there stood a very excited James, \"Seth! What's up man? I'm so glad you're here!\" he exclaimed, giving Seth a hug. Then he gave me a hug which only lasted a couple seconds because he noticed Jay. \"Hey Johnny, what's up?\" James asked, causing me to face palm myself. Even after meeting him about a hundred times, James still managed to get Jay's name wrong. \"It's uh, Jay,\" Jay mumbled with an awkward smile. \"I'll never forget it again, man. Good to see you,\" James said before hugging him as well. Then he led us inside. \"Really cool, this place is beautiful, man,\" Seth said. \"This place is like a piece of me, you two just stepped inside me,\" James said, motioning to Jay and Seth. \"You let us both come inside you,\" Seth chuckled a bit. I couldn't help but snicker at the obvious innuendo. James draped his arm over my shoulder and smirked, \"I'm gonna go light up by the coffee table, care to join me?\" \"Maybe later, I'm gonna grab a drink and do some mingling first,\" I replied, wiggling out of his arms I turned around and froze in my tracks. There on the other side of the room was Michael – fucking- Cera. He was snorting lines of cocaine off the table and smacking Rihanna's ass, who retaliated by bitch slapping him across the face. \"What is 'that' doing here?!\" I growled, clenching my fists. \"Look, Anastasia I can explain….\" James started to say but I cut him off. \"Explain what?! That you invited the same asshole that not only ripped my heart out but also spread all those rumors about me!\" I exclaimed, shocked. James sighed. \"I almost kicked his ass when he showed up but he told me that he didn't want any trouble and that he would leave you alone.\" \"James, he's already drunk and coked up, do you honestly think he's gonna keep his word?\" I asked dryly, folding my arms. \"If he tries anything I'll give you my revolver and you can shoot his dick off,\" he said. \"Just forget it, I'm not gonna let him ruin my fun,\" I said, trying to stay positive. \"That's the spirit,\" he grinned, kissing me on the cheek. After that James, Seth, and I sat down by the penis statue and began discussing ideas for Pineapple Express 2. \"So, Red has become the drug lord and he wants to assassinate Woody Harrelson because he's gonna make a speech that makes all weed legal. Then he kidnaps you and threatens to kill you if Saul and Dale don't assassinate Woody Harrelson in time. Oh, and you're gonna get tortured by Red as well. It's gonna be more fucked up than Saw,\" Seth explained to me. \"Sounds pretty exciting and fucked up,\" I laughed. \"So does that mean you're in?\" James asked. \"Of course, I'd love to reprise the role of Saul's feisty, weed smoking girlfriend,\" I replied, \"Speaking of Danny McBride, where is he? I thought for sure you invited him….\" James shook his head, \"No, I didn't because he's an ass! The last time I invited him to my party he got drunk, pissed all over my art and furniture, and passed out in the bathtub!\" I just sighed and rubbed my temples. Although he had a tendency to be an annoying douche sometimes, Danny was still one of my best friends and I couldn't believe James had the nerve to not invite him. I decided to go outside to the pool where I ran into Jonah and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. We talked for a bit until Michael stumbled over and slapped my ass. \"I see you've still got a great ass on you baby,\" he slurred. \"Why didn't you come find me when you got here huh?\" \"Because I have nothing to say to you Michael! You broke my heart and told all those lies to the paparazzi! You knew what you were doing and you knew it would hurt me but somehow that didn't stop you! You hurt me in so many different ways that I never thought were possible!\" I shouted. Chris put his hand on my shoulder and whispered \"he's not worth it\" in my ear before he glared at Michael, \"Look, she obviously doesn't want to talk to you so just go somewhere else alright?\" Michael grinned, \"Hey Chris, does this coke smell funny to you?\" he asked and blew a fistful of cocaine in Chris's face. \"Are you fucking crazy?!\" I yelled, trying to shove Michael away from Chris. Chris was losing his shit because he'd never done cocaine before. I tried to get Chris to calm down -which he did, somewhat- but then Michael tried to blow more cocaine in his mustache and he started freaking out again. I went back inside and poured myself some vodka before I went in the living room. Everyone was crowded around Craig while he was playing notes on a keyboard. I pushed past a few people and stood beside James. \"Alright fellas, I want you to be real sexy right now. We're gonna sing to all the ladies. All the fellas go like this, in your Barry White voice: take your panties off,\" Craig sang lowly. Everyone laughed and mimicked him. \"C'mon Rihanna take your panties off for meee!\" Craig crooned. \"C'mon Craig, can you fuck off of me?\" She retorted, swaying her head from side to side. I roared with laughter, as did everyone else. Craig turned to James and me and grinned, \"How about the host of the party and his sexy lady?\" James and I exchanged smirks before belting out \"We ain't got no panties on!\" Everyone laughed again and repeated the line. My fun was put on pause when I saw Jay leave the room. I felt terrible for him. Seth wasn't spending time with him like he said he would and now he was miserable. The only reason why he was here in the first place was because of us. After that Seth, Jonah, Martin Starr, David Krumholtz, Kevin Hart, and Mindy Kaling all sat down on the couches around the coffee table. I sat down next to James and lit a joint before taking a drag. David, Kevin, and Seth were currently telling James why the house wasn't safe for kids. \"A kid could fall off this fucking railing,\" Seth said, pointing to it. \"That's why you have the railings so they don't fall off,\" James said dryly. \"Don't you and your girlfriend want to have kids someday?\" David asked smugly. \"Of course we do and when that time comes we'll make this place more kid-friendly,\" I retorted. \"It looks fine the way it is! They only way something bad will happen is if our kids are accident prone,\" James argued. \"Oh, and we're gonna have to hide the penis statue and the painting with the pear nipples on it from the kids for a few years,\" I chortled. \"Why? It's art not porn!\" \"Once we tell them about the birds and the bees then you can put them back where they were!\" Before James could protest any more, Jay walked over to us. He looked even more miserable than he did before. If he had a choice between jumping off the Grand Canyon and being at this party, he would probably pick the first option. \"Hey Jay, you alright?\" I asked. \"Yeah, I'm fine. Um, do you know where I can get a pack of cigarettes around here?\" he inquired. I nodded and got up from the couch, much to James's dismay. \"Yeah, there's a place about four blocks away. Just let me grab my cardigan and I'll go with you if you want?\" \"I'd like that, thanks,\" he smiled a bit. I grabbed my black cardigan with white skulls on it off one of the coat hangers in the hallway and put it on before heading back to the living room. I looked at Seth and raised a brow, \"Are you coming?\" \"Give me this much time, this much joint time,\" Seth replied, holding up his joint. \"Seriously?!\" I exclaimed, crossing my arms. \"Alright, alright I'm coming,\" Seth muttered, handing his joint to James. James took it and looked at me,\"Hey, when you get back there's something I want to ask you.\" \"Oh really? Mind giving me a hint as to what that 'something' is?\" I teased. \"Nope, you'll just have to wait to find out,\" he grinned. Once we got to the store, I went to the back to grab some M&M;'s. Then I went over to Jay who already had his cigarettes and an orange soda. \"Would it make you feel better if I hung out with you when we go back to James's?\" I asked. He shook his head, \"I'm not really liking it over there, no offense. I think I'm just gonna head back to Seth's place.\" I ran a hand through my hair and sighed. \"Jay, you know I love you right? You're one of my best friends and I haven't seen you in forever and I'd really like it if you came back to the party.\" Before Jay could say anything else, we turned to see an old woman behind the counter yelling at a father and daughter for asking to use the bathroom. Sheesh, what a cranky, old bitch. We walked over to Seth and he handed me a Milky Way. \"This cash register lady is mean and I have anxiety so will you buy this for me Anastasia? I promise I'll pay you back later, but when I'm stoned I can't do this,\" he said. I smirked, \"Sure, but don't expect me to bite my tongue if she decides to cop an attitude with me.\" Suddenly, the whole store began to shake very violently. Seth was sent to the ground and a display rack fell on top of him. I screamed and clung to Jay as the store continued to shake. My eyes widened in shock as blue beams unexpectedly burst through the sky. They beamed on some of the people in the store and the people stared up into them. I began to hyperventilate as they hovered in the air for a few seconds before being sucked up into the sky like a vacuum cleaner. Then, the shaking stopped and Seth got up and looked at us. \"Are you guys okay?\" he asked, urgently. I shook my head and tried to speak but no words came out. The cashier lady started yelling at us and a huge chunk of ceiling fell and crushed her. Blood was now splattered all over the walls. We all screamed and ran out of the store as fast as we could. It was absolute chaos outside; cars were crashing into buildings, people were screaming and running, and tons of buildings were now engulfed in flames. \"We're going back to Franco's!\" Seth barked as we continued to sprint down the street. \"Why?!\" Jay shot back as Seth pulled him out of the way of a speeding taxi. \"We have to warn them! Plus, it's the only place where we'll be safe at this point!\" I cried, agreeing with Seth. The taxi crashed into another vehicle and instantly burst into flames. We all screamed again before Seth looked at Jay. \"We are going back to Franco's!\" \"Oh, Goddammit!\" Jay mumbled. Please review![Chapter 3] A/N: Thank you so much Stacy, Anastasia, Guest, and Johnny-and-Ponyboy-Forever for all of your reviews! You guys rock and I'm so glad you like my story. I also want to thank everyone else that has faved and followed my story. However, I would appreciate some actual feedback other than \"update soon\" for this chapter and future chapters. I really want to know what you guys liked, didn't like, what you think of Anastasia, what you think should happen between her and James, etc. One more thing I'd like to point out is that I've decided to add another female OC to the story. I couldn't help but notice that there aren't any Jay/OC stories and I just thought that he deserved someone as well. Enjoy! We all ran as fast as we could across the street. It was a miracle that we even made it back to James's house in one piece. I screamed at the top of my lungs as I sprinted across the front lawn with Seth and Jay right behind me. I panted heavily as I pulled the door open and ran inside. All of the party guests were now staring at us. James sat in a bubble chair in the living room and raised an eyebrow at us as we tried to catch our breath. \"Hey, you guys okay?\" James asked, looking at us like we'd gone insane. I shook my head. \"Do we look okay to you?! There's been an earthquake and people are being beamed up into the sky!\" Jay nodded in agreement, \"She's right, while we we're at the store these beams came out of nowhere and started sucking people into them!\" \"Things have gone crazy out there,\" Seth said. \"Jesus babe, calm down. What are you talking about?\" James stood up and put his hands on my shoulders, \"You must've had too much to drink because we didn't hear or feel anything. Nothing's going on so just relax. Maybe you should go upstairs and lie down.…\" \"I swear to God I'm not drunk or crazy James! You have to believe me! We're all in danger!\" I cried. Before James could say anything else, the entire house shook. Everyone screamed and ran outside. James and I tried to stop them but they didn't listen to us so we ended up following them. I stood in between Jay, Seth, and James. We all stared up in shock and horror as flames began to consume the Hollywood hills. I wanted nothing more than to yell at James for not believing any of us, but before I could…. \"Everybody listen up!\" Michael yelled/slurred as he made his way through the crowd until he was in front of all of us, \"who took my fucking cell phone man?!\" He turned to me, \"Anastasia, I know it was you! Empty your pockets you fucking whore!\" I flipped him off, \"I didn't take your fucking phone dumbass! Do yourself a favor and lay off the cocaine, Michael!\" The ground began to crack under Michael's feet as he kept rambling on about his phone. The, the street lamp behind him started to shake. We all screamed for him to move but he kept yelling about his stupid phone. The street light came crashing down and impaled Michael right through the back. Blood spewed everywhere like a garden hose. I screamed and held onto James as more and more blood gushed from Michael's wound. \"Is it bad? What's happening to me? What's happening?\" Michael whimpered as he stared at us. Suddenly, the street light shot upwards, taking Michael with it. He reached into his pocket and pulled out his bloody iPhone \"Oh shit, that's embarrassing,\" he muttered. Without warning, the ground began to open up and swallowed both Michael and the streetlight. Everyone started to back up as the ground began to open wider and wider. Within seconds, a massive sinkhole was created. Rihanna, Mindy, Martin, and many others fell to their deaths. Before I could make a run for it, someone pushed me and I fell into the hole. Fortunately for me, I was quick enough to grab onto the ledge. I glanced over and saw that Jay was in the same predicament as well. \"Oh my God, I'm gonna die!\" I snapped my head to look at Chris, who was on the verge of letting go and falling to his death. \"Chris! Whatever you do, don't let go! Hold on!\" I screamed, trying to hold back my tears. \"I can't!\" he yelled. Then he let go of the ledge and plummeted to his death. Almost instantly, tears began to well up in my eyes. All of my friends were dying and there was nothing I could do about it. \"Anastasia, hold on! I've got you!\" I looked up to see James leaning over the ledge and holding his hand out for me. I grabbed his hand and he pulled me up with ease. \"Come on, we've gotta go back inside!\" he yelled, grabbing me by the arm. I was about to go with him until I saw that Jay was still holding onto the ledge for dear life,\"Jay! Hang on! Let me go! We've gotta help him!\" I barked, struggling in James's grip. James shook his head and wrapped his arms around my waist, \"He'll be fine, come on!\" he said quickly before dragging me towards the door. Once we were inside, he let go of me and closed the door. I tried to get past him but he wrapped his arms around me again and held me in place. \"Get off me! I've gotta save Jay!\" I hissed, thrashing against him. \"Are you fucking crazy?! If you go back out there you'll fall in again and I refuse to let that happen!\" \"And I refuse to let my best friend die because my boyfriend wouldn't let me help him! Now let go of me!\" Just then, the door swung open and Jay ran inside. James let go of me and I sighed in relief. Jay wasn't alone though, standing right behind him was Lydia Sky, my best friend and co-star in Tropic Thunder and Spring Breakers . One of the sassiest girls I knew, but still a great friend nevertheless. \"Lydia! Thank God you're alive!\" I exclaimed, hugging her tight. \"What the fuck is going on?! There's a fucking sinkhole outside and the Hollywood hills are on fire!\" She exclaimed, wiggling out my grip. \"We're in the middle of the fucking apocalypse! That's what's going on!\" Seth yelled. \"We need to check the news and see what's happening,\" James chimed in, grabbing the remote off the coffee table. He pressed a button and the TV came up from the floor. \"Showoff,\" Lydia coughed loudly. \"Thank you,\" James retorted before turning the TV on. Jay, Lydia, and I sat down on one of the couches and watched the TV. All the newswoman said was for everyone to seek shelter and be safe before the signal cut out. I ran a hand through my hair and sighed, \"Looks like we're not going anywhere so the best thing to do is board this place up and see how much food we have left.\" We spent the next hour and a half boarding the place up to make sure nothing got in. After that we laid everything we had to eat and drink on the countertop island in the kitchen. \"Alright Rogen, what do we have left?\" Lydia huffed, tucking a piece of hair behind her ear. Seth bit his lip and looked at the check list of all the supplies we had. \"We've got twelve bottles of water, fifty-six beers, two vodkas, four whiskeys, six bottles of wine, tequila, Nutella, cheese, pizza, eggs, bananas, apples, bacon, steaks, pancake mix, C.T. Crunch, milk, ketchup, a Milky Way, half-ounce Sour Diesel, three and a half grams Grand Master Kush, one ounce of 'shrooms, fifteen pills of ecstasy, a porno mag, a baseball bat, and the video camera from the movie 27 Hours .\" \" 127 Hours,\" James corrected. Seth nodded and scribbled it down on the notebook. \"I'll be taking this,\" Lydia reached over and grabbed the bottle of tequila off the table. \"What the fuck Lydia?! That's supposed to last us until we get saved!\" James barked. \"Me taking one small bottle of tequila isn't gonna kill us all so take your fucking tampon out, Franco,\" she scoffed, pulling the cork out of the bottle. James looked over at me and my hands shot up in defense, \"Don't even look at me. The last time I tried to take a bottle of tequila away from her she almost broke my wrist,\" I replied. \"Hey, it was New Year's Eve and you were being a buzz kill,\" Lydia shrugged and took a sip. \"Enough! Just let her keep the tequila so we can see what else we have,\" Seth said before looking back at the counter top, \"We also have a functioning revolver from the movie Flyboys .\" \"Old faithful,\" James smiled and picked the gun up and held it up in the air. \"Jesus!\" Lydia and Jay said, ducking down. \"This thing's real, I kept this from the movie. This is an actual revolver,\" James grinned, waving it around. \"You're making me real uncomfortable; can you put that down please?\" Craig said, putting his hands up. \"Franco, I swear to God if you blow my head off,\" Lydia growled, ducking down whenever James waved the gun in her direction. \"Loaded,\" James said, showing off the tiny bullets packed up inside the gun before closing it, \"I always keep my props.\" \"James, put that gun down right now before someone gets hurt!\" I shrieked, ducking down behind the counter as he waved it around again. James rolled his eyes, \"Relax, I know how to handle it. You guys are overreacting.\" \"He knows what he's doing. I like this bit. I like it. I get it. Let me see,\" Jonah laughed, motioning for James to give him the revolver. James shrugged and threw the revolver to Jonah, causing Jay, Lydia, Seth, Craig, and me to yell at him for doing so. \"Bang, bang,\" Jonah said, putting on a girlish voice as he pointed the gun at all of us, \"Bang, bang, bang! You're dead!\" \"Stop fucking with the gun!\" Lydia snapped. \"Pow, pow, pow!\" Jonah laughed, aiming the gun at us. \"Knock it off Jonah! This isn't fucking funny!\" I barked. \"We're getting sidetracked!\" Jay yelled. \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\" Jonah said and then pouted as he put the gun to his head, \"I'll just kill myself.\" Jonah started to fake cry as he put the tip of the revolver in his mouth. We screamed for him to stop and he reluctantly handed the revolver back to James. \"I'm just trying to have some fun. Look, just because a bunch of our friends fell into a hole outside doesn't mean we can't have some fun. We're a bunch of best friend's hanging out, it's like a sleepover!\" Jonah exclaimed, trying to sound positive. Lydia rolled her eyes and looked back at the counter, \"Alright, what are we gonna do about the food?\" \"Um, can I have that Milky Way?\" Jonah asked, pointing to it. \"No, you can't have the Milky Way,\" James said irritably, \"That's my Milky Way. I went out this morning and specifically bought this Milky Way to eat after my party.\" \"That's really weird,\" Jay said. \"It's not weird. It's my special food, I like it,\" James shot back before looking at me, \"Back me up on that babe.\" \"Nope, because I want some of the Milky Way too,\" I smirked, crossing my arms. \"I'll be pretty bummed if I don't at least get a bite of the Milky Way,\" Craig remarked, putting his hands on his hips. \"Let's just forget about the Milky Way for now, alright? It's late and I need sleep,\" Lydia hissed before looking at me, \"Can I borrow some pajamas? I really need to get out of these clothes.\" \"Yeah, come on,\" I replied and led her upstairs to the room that James and I shared. I grabbed some shorts and a tank top out of one of the drawers and handed it to her. She thanked me and left the room. Oh, and she also told me that she'd rip James and I's throats out if she heard us fucking. Yup, gotta love Lydia. Then I changed into my pj's and climbed into bed and James followed suit. He put on his sleeping mask and turned off the light. \"You're such a prima donna,\" I snickered as I cuddled into his chest. \"Mm hmm,\" he murmured, wrapping his arms around me and pulling me closer to him. I bit my lip as his fingers trailed up the side of my thigh, hitching my t-shirt up slightly. \"Lydia's gonna kill us if we do this you know,\" I teased, lifting his mask up. \"She'll just have to deal with it,\" he smirked before pressing his lips against mine. Please Review! Oh, and the link to what Lydia looks like is on my profile.[Chapter 4] A/N: Thank you so much to everyone that reviewed, faved, and followed! I can't tell you guys how much I appreciate all of the love and support this story is getting. James Edward Franco – Thank you! I'm glad that you're enjoying it so far! Yugioh13 – I know right?! I was cracking up when I saw it in the theater XD Yeah, Lydia is definitely one of those girls who speaks her mind and doesn't give a damn what anyone thinks. MonkeysGoBoo – Thank you! Guest- Yes, but not until the next chapter. I know everyone wants to know what he was going to ask her so don't worry; you'll find out soon enough. Morgan – Thanks! Yeah, I noticed that there aren't any fics about him and I thought he deserved someone as well, plus I thought it'd be interesting to add another girl to the mix XD The girl in the cover photo is what Anastasia looks like but if you want to see a full size pic of her, the link is on my profile. I also changed what Lydia looks like so the link to that is on my profile as well. Thanks again for your review! Lydia's POV I couldn't fucking believe this. Not only was I stuck in this house for God knows how long, but now I had to listen to James and Anastasia going at it upstairs. Even though I warned them not to! Clenching my fists, I slid out from under one James's tables (my current sleeping spot) and tiptoed into the living room. Seth and Jay were currently lying down on the floor beside the couches, looking as annoyed as I was because they also had to listen to the horndogs upstairs. \"Mind if I join you guys? I can't sleep at all thanks to James and Anastasia and I really need some company,\" I huffed, crossing my arms. \"Sure, come snuggle in,\" Seth replied. \"Oh, and if you try to spoon me while I'm asleep, I'll beat you within an inch of your life,\" I retorted as I made my way over to them. \"Uh, as I was saying, I think this is Judgment Day. Not the Terminator 2 version, the biblical version,\" Jay said. Seth rolled his eyes, \"Alright, let's just say for a second there were blue lights sucking people up into the sky. That means that we were not awesome enough to go to heaven.\" \"Seth, I think there's more to it than tha-\"I was cut off by the sound of loud footsteps. A large, dark figure walked down the stairs and headed towards us. I held onto Jay and bit my lip. Then I sighed in relief once I saw that the large, mysterious figure was only Craig. \"What are ya'll doin?\" he whispered. \"Fuck you, Craig!\" Seth spat, trying to catch his breath. \"I'm scared, it's scary by myself. I'm gonna sleep right here,\" he said. He walked over and lied down on one of the couches. At that point, James and Anastasia had finally decided to give it a rest for the night and I couldn't help but sigh in relief, \"Good, now I can finally get some sleep,\" I muttered, closing my eyes. \"Hey guys.\" We all jumped upon hearing Jonah's voice. The fact that he was standing right behind us was even creepier. \"Jesus, Jonah you scared the shit out of me!\" I snapped, turning my head to look at him. \"I second that!\" Jay barked. \"Sorry, Franco has this crazy open floor plan. I can hear James and Anastasia fucking upstairs and every word you guys are saying. I might as well hang with you guys if that's cool,\" he replied. He moved one of the couches aside and squeezed in between Seth and me. It took us about a half hour to get settled in, mostly because I didn't want to sleep with Jonah's dick in my ass. \"Goodnight, you guys,\" Jonah said, kissing my head and then Seth's. Then he leaned over and kissed Jay's head. \"Goodnight, Hill,\" I mumbled, closing my eyes. \"GUYS! GUYS, WAKE UP! DANNY'S ALIVE! HE'S EATING ALL THE FUCKING FOOD!\" \"WHAT THE FUCK, DANNY?!\" I woke up to James and Anastasia's yelling. We had all tossed and turned throughout the night, with Craig's hand on the back of Jay's head, Jay's face in my boobs, and Seth's head against Jonah's shoulder, pretty much spooning him. We all got up and I rolled my eyes once I saw that Danny-fucking-McBride was sitting at the table, eating all of our food. Words could not express how much I hated Danny. The main reason being that when he and I were on the set of Eastbound and Down we made a bet out of sheer boredom. He said that I had to go a month without drinking tequila and smoking weed. If I caved, I had to wear a slutty dress and stripper heels to my next movie premiere and if I won he had to change his last name to McDouchebag. He ended up winning the bet and when he showed up at the premiere I kicked his ass. Jay, Seth, and Anastasia held me back while I yelled \"I hate you, Danny McBride!\" repeatedly. Almost every single magazine quoted that and had pictures of me yelling at and fighting with Danny. \"Oh God, now we're stuck with McDouchebag! Just kill me now, please!\" I screamed at the ceiling. Danny rolled his eyes and chuckled a bit, \"Nice to see you too, Lydia. I see you're still bitter about the incident at the Goon premiere.\" \"Can you fucking blame me? You humiliated me Danny!\" I growled. Danny shrugged,\" Hey, you agreed to the bet and that was a year ago. Get over it. Although, I have to admit your tits looked amazing in that dress.\" \"You're dead, McBride!\" I yelled and stormed towards him. Unfortunately, Jay quickly grabbed me and prevented me from beating Danny into a coma. \"Hey! Hey! This isn't the time to start another infamous Sky/McBride fight!\" Seth shouted. \"He's right, just calm the fuck down, Lydia,\" Anastasia advised. Reluctantly, I nodded and Jay released me. I looked back at Danny, who shoved a piece of bacon in his mouth. \"Stop eating!\" Seth barked. \"Guys, just chill the fuck out ok? I'm sure the Green Goblin can fuckin' afford some more bacon,\" Danny replied, motioning to James. \"Dude, that shit's supposed to last us until we get rescued!\" Craig said. Danny looked at all of us and smirked, \"Wait a second, I know what happened. You guys dropped acid didn't you? Craig doesn't have any pants on, probably got fuckin' wild. Probably danced and sweated all over the place,\" he turned to James, \"You've got white shit all over your mouth, Franco. You probably spent most of the night going down on Anastasia until she blacked out while Lydia over here said 'fuck it' and decided to give head to Jay. Then Jonah over here probably watched and jerked off.\" I'll admit I had a thing for Jay ever since we filmed Tropic Thunder together, but I was too much of a chicken shit to tell him. The closest him and I ever came to hooking up was when we had to kiss in Goon. \"Danny, we're not on acid! We didn't have one big orgy either!\" Seth argued. \"Well, one of those things definitely happened last night,\" James smirked and playfully smacked Anastasia's ass. \"Which reminds me, I still need to rip both of your throats out for keeping me up,\" I hissed. \"Daniel, you may want to stay seated for a second,\" Jonah said quietly, \"Some really messed up stuff happened last night, and there were a lot of fatalities.\" \"Oh really? You're putting your serious voice on Jonah?\" Danny scoffed, \"Okay, tell me about these fatalities.\" \"Dude, Segal's dead, Krumholtz is dead, Michael Cera's dead,\" Craig said. \"Guess if Michael Cera's gone it's not a total loss huh? Ha, ha! Michael Cera's dead!\" Danny said before letting out a condescending laugh. \"That's not fucking funny Danny! I may not have been on good terms with Michael but he still didn't deserve to die!\" Anastasia said, exasperated. \"That's really not funny, man\" Seth muttered. \"Seth, that's a better performance than you've given in the last six of your movies. Where the fuck was that in Green Hornet? Jonah, you're fuckin' suckin' balls. You're an Academy Award nominated person. You need to be selling that shit dude! Fatalities ,\" Danny said, putting emphasis on it,\" There were some fatalities.\" \"Does it look like we're fucking joking?\" I screeched, and Danny rolled his eyes and popped another piece of bacon in his mouth. Craig grabbed him by the jaw and made him spit it out the bacon, sending bits of it across the room. Suddenly, there was a loud pounding at the door and we all turned around. The doors didn't stay barricaded for long. Some bald guy popped his head through a hole that was now in the door. James raised his revolver and pointed it at the guy. \"Oh God, did you not hear me knocking out there?! I've been knocking forever! Please, please you've gotta let me in!\" he pleaded. \"Hang on a second,\" James told him before looking back at us, \"Guys, I know it sounds really weird, but I don't think we should let him in.\" \"What?!\" Anastasia said. \"Why the fuck not?!\" Jay and I yelled in unison. \"Yeah, why not?\" the man shouted, \"I can hear you, by the way.\" \"I'm sorry, we just don't know you, man,\" James said, looking back at him, \"You could be a looter… Or a.. a rapist. Or a titty fucker. I'm sorry.\" Seth held his man-boobs when James mentioned titty fucker. I had to cover my mouth to hide my laugh. James turned around and looked back at us, \"Look guys, we just boarded up this whole house to keep everyone out and the first guy comes along you wanna let him in? How do we know we can trust this guy?\" \"I want to live! Things have gone crazy out there!\" the man said. \"Things have gone fuckin' crazy out here!\" Danny mimicked before laughing, \"This guy fuckin' sucks.\" \"What if he's a rapist? I'm not about to let him rape my girlfriend!\" James said. \"Even if he is a rapist, he can't rape all of us,\" Jonah pointed out. \"I'm not a rapist! Just please let me in!\" the man shouted. \"You wanna titty fuck us?!\" Seth said nervously, grabbing his man-boobs. \"If you want me to titty fuck you I will! So good, oh you'll love it!\" the man pleaded. Jay gave me a desperate look, \"Lydia, back me up please. We can't just leave him out there to die!\" \"Oh, for fucks sake, this is ridiculous. I'm letting him in whether you guys like it or not,\" I snapped and walked towards the doorway. \"I'm with you on that, Sky,\" Danny replied and got up from where he was sitting. Before I could even attempt to help the man, there was a loud roar outside and then the man was decapitated. Blood spurted all over the white tank top Anastasia had lent me and all over the floor. \"I think I'm gonna be sick,\" I said, trying to wipe the man's blood off me. \"THIS IS REAL! THIS IS FUCKIN' REAL!\" Danny screamed and kicked the man's head to James, who screamed. Out of terror, we all ended up kicking the man's head across the floor like it was a fucking soccer ball. Eventually, Craig put a blanket over the head and Seth took one of James's metal sculptures and pushed it towards the corner of the room. \"Okay, someone should look out the hole!\" Seth said. Anastasia shook her head and hid behind James, who wrapped his arm protectively around her waist, \"No fucking way!\" Craig nodded in agreement, \"I ain't lookin' through that hole! The last person that looked through that hole got his head chopped off!\" \"Wait, whatever is out there, might still be out there,\" Jay whispered. James nodded and signaled for us to follow him. We all ran upstairs and looked out a large window. My eyes widened at the sight. The sky was dark and there was smoke everywhere due to the Hollywood Hills being engulfed in flames. \"There's a huge fucking hole out there! What the fuck is this?!\" Danny shouted. \"The end of the world,\" I murmured. Jay cleared his throat, \"You guys do realize we had the opportunity to save that poor bastard, right?\" Jonah sighed and stepped away from the window, \"Jay's right, we could've done more.\" \"Well, I don't know that I could've done more. I was just trying to get him into your fuckin' house!\" Jay said, looking at James. \"Hey, I tried to help him and look at how well that turned out!\" I sneered, motioning to my tank top. Jay raised his hands in defense, \"I know, I'm not blaming you at all, Lydia!\" \"Shit, my fuckin' phone doesn't work!\" Danny said and put it back in his pocket, \"Oh, Jesus Christ. Guys, there's something really fucked up going on out there. I don't think any of us can leave. We should just stay in here, fortify this bitch, and take inventory of all the food and shit we have.\" Anastasia shook her head, \"We did that already, you ate it all.\" Seth sighed, \"Do you guys have any water left at all?\" \"Yes, but it's in the storage cellar. You have to go outside and around the back,\" James muttered. \"Yeah, I'll pass,\" I quipped. \"I'm not going out there either,\" Jay said. \"Well, I think Danny should go,\" James stated, looking at him. \"Fuck you, Franco! I'm not going outside!\" \"Fuck you! You ate all the food, man!\" \"Oh, here we go. Somebody's being petty, Tom Petty!\" \"I'm not Tom Petty. I'm one of the fuckin' heartbreakers cause' you broke my heart and you ate all our food!\" \"Whoa, easy guys,\" Seth cut in, \"Something is ripping people's heads off outside. So, we're all staying in this house, right? We need to stop arguing, so we might as well start getting along, ok? Let's vote, who thinks we should start getting along?\" We all sighed and raised our hands. Then Jonah spoke up, \"I think its best before we move on if I could maybe say a few words about the bald gentleman whose head was chopped off.\" \"Yeah, good idea,\" Anastasia nodded, bowing her head and closing her eyes. The rest of us followed suit and Jonah cleared his throat, \"Dear bald guy-whose-head-got-cut-off, um, we didn't know you very well. I'm just picturing you up there in heaven, in a big grassy field and that head of yours getting kicked around by God and Jesus and his buddies...\" I opened my eyes and glared at him,\"That's fucked up, Jonah.\" Then Craig suggested that we should say a prayer for all of the celebrities that fell into the sinkhole outside. So, for the next few minutes we said prayers for Rihanna, David Krumholtz, Aziz Ansari, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and Michael Cera. \"Alright, we're still alive. We don't have any water but we do have other shit to drink,\" Seth said once we were done praying. \"If it gets desperate, you can drink your own urine,\" James informed us. \"For the record, you will never drink my piss and I'm not drinking anyone's piss either,\" I commented, folding my arms. James looked at Anastasia, \"Well, I'm willing to sacrifice my pee for you then, babe.\" She scrunched her nose in disgust, \"Yeah, I think I'd rather die of thirst.\" \"I'm not drinking pee either,\" Jay said. \"Trust me, if things get desperate enough, you guys will be begging us for pee,\" James replied. \"Alright guys, we're on the same page. What's our new motto?\" Seth asked, putting his hand in out. \"How about live together, or die alone ?\" I shrugged, putting my hand in the center as well. \"Isn't that from Lost ?\" Jay asked, quirking a brow. \"Damn straight,\" I smirked. He shrugged and put his hand in. Then Anastasia, Craig, James, Jonah, and Danny followed suit, \"One, two, three… Live together, or die alone!\" we yelled and raised our hands.[Chapter 5] A/N: Hey guys, wow, it's been too long since I've last updated and I can't tell you how sorry I am for that. I had finals and lots of assignments to do so I wasn't able to update my stories, and when that was over and done with, I started a couple new stories. On top of that, I was still trying to think of some more ideas for this fic.I also want to let you guys know that I am putting some of the deleted scenes from the movie into the story as well (the ending part of the last chapter was one of them), and if you're interested in checking them out, they are up on YouTube, just type in 'This is The End (2013) Deleted, Extended & Alternative Scenes.' I now want to take the time to thank all of the guest reviewers for reviewing. Thanks a lot you guys! Anyway, I hope you all enjoy this long overdue chapter! MonkeysGoBoo – Thank you so much! I'm so happy you love it! :D samalama1993 – Thanks! Well, wait no longer because the new chapter is here! Yay! I'm not the only one who enjoys reading James Franco fics! Mariah – Oh no, I really appreciate the feedback. The thing about Lydia is that although she comes off as very blunt and has an attitude, she's not completely heartless. She'll still show compassion when the situation calls for it. Don't worry though, James and Anastasia are still going to be the main couple of this story and they'll still have a lot of moments together, but there's also going to be some Jay / Lydia moments as well since they're going to get together. kodaful1 – Thank you! :D JamesEdwardFranco – Thanks! ScarletBreezes – Thanks! I'm glad you're rooting for them already. Oh, and things will definitely get more interesting when Emma comes XD Jojo657 – Thank you! \"Hi, this is James Franco and Anastasia Massaro. Um, in my house, in my library. Uh, we've been stuck here for twenty four hours. And Danny McBride is here,\" James said bitterly, rolling his eyes. I looked away from the video camera and narrowed my eyes at him, \"James, stop it.\" \"What? I didn't invite him to my party-\" \"But, you should've. We both should've invited him, James. Don't you think it was pretty shitty to just blow him off like that?\" I sighed, raking a hand through my hair. He scoffed, \"Oh, please, like he hasn't done worse. What about that time we were filming the fight scene between you, me, Seth, and him for Pineapple Express ? You ended up twisting your ankle because he decided to improvise and shoved you into the bathtub.\" I bit my lip, remembering that day all too well. I wasn't able to do the rest of my scenes for a week because the rest of the movie required me to run and walk. Thank God for stunt doubles. \"He said he was sorry, James! Besides, as painful as that was, I think it made the fight more realistic!\" \"Okay, what about that time we went to a party at Seth's house? He not only grinded on you while were dancing, but when we tried to have some 'alone time,' he barged in and told me to get out so he could have his way with you.\" \"James-\" \"Anastasia, stop defending him already! This is typical fuckin' McBride!\" James argued before turning back to the camera, \"I've just been feeling really weird about him lately… like, I don't know if I want to be friends with him. Then he fuckin' showed up at my party and now we're stuck here with him in disaster lockdown. So uh-\" Before James could continue his rant, there was a knock at the door. We both turned around to see Danny leaning against the doorway. Wait, how long had he been standing there? Oh God, he fucking heard everything! \"Whaddup?\" Danny grinned. Okay, so maybe he didn't hear everything after all. I mean, he would've confronted us right then and there if he had, right? \"Hey Danny, what's up man?\" James grinned back, as if he hadn't been shit talking him. \"What are you two doing? What is this? Are ya'll making a sex tape or something?\" Danny joked, with a hint of curiosity to his voice. \"Nope, just a video confessional.\" I replied. Danny nodded and left the room without another word. James and I waited until he was out of earshot before saying anything else. \"I hope to God he didn't hear all that.\" I mumbled. James just shrugged before turning his attention to the camera, \"Fuck that dude!\" \"Anyone know how to make a potato?\" Seth asked, eyeing the potato in his hands as him, Jonah, Craig, Lydia and I stood in the kitchen. I figured helping them make dinner would be the best way to get my mind off James and Danny's feud. \"Don't you just eat it raw?\" Craig answered, tearing the plastic off the frozen DiGiorno pizza. \"No, you don't eat them raw. You boil them.\" Lydia piped up, snickering a bit after Seth took a bite of the raw potato and spit it out. \"You boil them?!\" Seth exclaimed in disbelief, \"Oh, well we don't have any water.\" \"We could use beer?\" Jonah suggested. \"Dude, beertatoes!\" Seth said excitedly. \"I'm not gonna lie, that actually doesn't sound half-bad.\" Lydia commented with a smirk. \"Bring em' on Rogen.\" I said, rubbing my hands together. \"This is gonna be the tastiest thing that's ever happened,\" Seth boasted, popping the cap off the beer bottle. Then, right out of the blue, all of the lights in the house went off. We all groaned in frustration and started yelling / begging the house to turn the lights back on. \"Fuck you house!\" Lydia spat. \"House! Lights on!\" Jonah yelled. \"Pretty please house!\" Craig pleaded. \"Don't worry, guys. Just wait for it! Wait for it!\" James's voice insisted from upstairs. As if on cue, the lights automatically turned back on. \"Ah! Solar power generators! Harness the power of the sun baby!\" he said proudly. I now remembered James mentioning to me that he had those installed when I first moved in with him. At first I thought it was a colossal waste of money, but he insisted that we needed them in case of an emergency. Needless to say, I was glad that he refused to get rid of them. \"Every time I think I'm green, you do something greener man.\" Seth commented, giving James a thumbs up. \"What does green mean?\" Craig inquired. Jonah began to explain to Craig his long definition of 'going green.' Almost halfway through his explanation, Jay walked down the hall. I thought he was going to help us with dinner, but then he let out a scowl after seeing and hearing Jonah and then walked upstairs, shutting us all out once again. I'm not gonna lie, that really hurt. Lydia must've seen the look on my face because she quickly pulled me aside and put a hand on my shoulder. \"Don't worry; I'll talk to him.\" \"I know he still feels like he doesn't fit in and hates everybody, but now I can't help but think he secretly hates me too.\" I muttered. She smiled at me, \"Look, just go back in the kitchen, make sure the guys don't burn what little food we have left, and in the meantime, I'll try and cheer up Baruchel.\" With that, she swirled around and walked upstairs. Lydia may've had her bitchy moments, but that didn't mean she was a total ice queen. The only time I'd ever been this depressed was when Michael begged me to go to one of his out of control house parties. At the time, I really wasn't in a partying mood, but Michael wasn't going to take \"no\" for an answer. It was one of the worst nights of my life. As soon as I got there, Michael had given me a drink to 'help me loosen up.' Little did I know that said drink had a ton of Xanax and ecstasy pills crushed up and mixed into it. As the night went on, he kept giving me more of those toxic drinks. I don't remember how many drinks I had exactly, but before I knew it, I was unconscious on the kitchen floor. James found me and didn't hesitate in beating the living shit out of Michael while Seth called 911. When I woke up in the hospital, Craig, Lydia, James, Danny, Jay, and Seth were there. Right off the bat, Lydia, Seth, and James told me to dump Michael for what he did. They kept insulting him and telling me I could do better. I told them to get the hell out of my room and out of my life. I ruined three friendships that day for Michael, probably one of the worst things I did for him out of love and stupidity. Pushing the memory of that night out of my head, I walked back into the kitchen and helped the boys finish making dinner. When it was ready, we all sat around James's dining room table discussing earthquakes, tsunamis, and other logical explanations as to why the apocalypse was happening. \"I mean, for all we know the fuckin' Lakers could've just won and that's the reason why all of this is happening,\" Danny commented. \"That, or Justin Bieber has just been elected President,\" Lydia retorted. \"Yes Lydia, we all know about the sheer hatred you have for Bieber. When 'Baby' first came out on the radio, you yelled \"Fuck this generation!\" and threw your radio out the window,\" I snorted. She folded her arms, \"Can you blame me? He's an annoying piece of shit who's got his head so far up his ass he doesn't know which way is up!\" \"Speaking of that, thanks for almost giving me a concussion when you threw that big ass radio out of your window.\" Danny grumbled, turning his head to glare at her. \"You're fucking welcome.\" She shot back with a wink and took a swig of her wine. \"Well, in Franco and Anastasia's front yard, a sinkhole. Every single time I turn on the news, Sinkhole in South America, bunch of South Americans getting sucked into the ground.\" Seth explained. \"Sinkhole de Mayo.\" Jonah pointed out. \"It's not earthquakes, it's not wildfires, and it's not sinkholes.\" Jay stated, \"I think I know what it is.\" \"Let's hear it,\" I said. \"I think it's the apocalypse.\" Jay confessed. Danny just laughed while the rest of the boys shook their heads in disbelief. Lydia rolled her eyes at them and then nodded at Jay, urging him to go on. It seemed that her and I were the only ones who believed him. Jay held up James's bible and cleared his throat, \"I'm serious you guys, it's all in here. In the book of Revelations. Well, just hear me out and you tell me that what I'm describing isn't what's going on right now.\" He opened the bible and started reading \"'And the sky shall open up and the light of the Lord shall shine down and those of good heart shall be brought into my kingdom of Heaven.' It's the Rapture, those are the gigantic beams of light. 'And there will be a great mountain burning in fire.' I mean, the Hollywood Hills are literally engulfed in flames as we sit here right now!\" \"The Hollywood Hills ain't no mountain. It's a hill.\" Craig interjected. \"Can I just finish? 'And out of the pit rose a great red dragon having seven heads. That old serpent called the devil in Satan was released onto the earth.\" Jay read, turning the bible around to show a picture of a demonic creature. \"I know that dude,\" Craig said, \"He's from Where The Wild Things Are .\" \"That's a load of bullshit,\" James said acidly, crossing his arms. \"It's not bullshit!\" Jay argued. \"And you wanna know something else Jay? If this is the end of the world and all the good people died, what you're saying is that Seth, me, Anastasia, Lydia, Jonah, Craig, and Danny are a bunch of assholes.\" James replied matter-of-factly. Craig's hands shot up in defense, \"I'm straight up lovable son.\" \"And if this really is the apocalypse. You're here too. So, that just means you're just as shitty as the rest of us,\" James said, giving Jay a scornful glare, \"Doesn't feel too good, does it?\" The rest of dinner was pretty quiet and the tension was thick enough to cut with a knife. Jay left the table without hesitation after what James said to him and Lydia was quick to follow him. She gave me a look that said 'Are you coming? Or are you taking Franco's side again?' and when I stayed put, she gave me an icy glare stormed out of the room in a huff. That made me feel even shittier. I stood in front of one of the windows down the hall, trying to clear my head of all of the drama in the house. \"Hey, you okay? You look like someone just ripped your heart out\" James's voice broke me out of my thoughts. \"Don't you think you were being a bit harsh to Jay, James?\" I asked, turning around to meet his gaze. \"Not at all, but that's not what I want to talk about right now. I want to talk about what I was going to ask you at the party, before all of this crazy shit happened...\" he let his voice trail off as he got down on one knee. I swallowed a lump in my throat and my heart began to race as he pulled something out of his pocket: a black velvet box. Tears welled up in my eyes as he opened it to reveal the most beautiful ring I'd ever seen. It was a pink diamond in the shape of a heart with little diamonds surrounding it. \"I love you, Anastasia Olivia Massaro. And if this really is the end of the world, then I want to spend every last moment on earth with you as my fiancé. Will you make me the happiest man alive?\" \"Yes! Yes! A million times yes!\" I said quickly. He smiled and slid the ring on my finger and I launched myself at him, throwing my arms around his neck and hugging him with all my might. More tears of happiness ran down my face as I did so. He wiped them away with his thumbs before pressing his lips to mine. I slid my arms around his neck, forgetting about everything. In that moment, it was just him and I. Oh my gosh, James proposed to her! What a way to do it huh? XD I hope you guys really liked this chapter. I do have a question though, Emma will most likely show up either in the next chapter or chapter seven and I was wondering if you guys think Emma should try to attack Lydia and Anastasia with her ax? You know, after she thinks the guys are going to rape her, Lydia and Anastasia try to tell her that it's all just a misunderstanding and that they would never do that and she doesn't believe them and says they'd probably let them rape her. Or, should she not attack them, but instead offer them the option to go with her?[Chapter 6] A/N: Hello my awesome readers! I just want to start off by giving a massive thanks to all of you for your responses to last chapter's question. It was really helpful and I really appreciate it. I want to let you guys know that updates may be a little slower than usual because I'm about to start school again. Also, when you guys get the chance you should check out Little Gee's fic 'To Hell With It.' It's really funny and her OC is amazing. You guys definitely won't be disappointed. Oh, and if you guys want to see what it looks like, the link to Anastasia's engagement ring is on my profile. ImagineDaydreams – Thank you so much! Of course, I'm not gonna give anything away, but I can tell you that it'll definitely be one hell of an ending. IHeartJayGatsbyTheOneAndOnly – Thank you! Don't worry, I will! :) Morgan – Thanks again for the feedback and I'm so glad you liked the chapter. :D daryldixonlover18 – Thanks! And I know it's been awhile, but I have no intention of discontinuing this story. Not sure if I'll have her attack them or not, but thanks again for giving me your opinion. LittleGee – Thank you so much! You rock! :D Oh yeah, it's definitely gonna be interesting to see what their fates will be. PrettyPrincess2013 – Thanks for reviewing and giving me your feedback, I think I may do just that. Lydia's POV \"Hey, you alright?\" I asked Jay as I walked up the stairs of James's attic. From the looks of it, Jay was still trying to get some answers because he was thumbing through the Bible. \"I just wish that they would believe me, you know? I mean, it all adds up. What's it gonna take to make them see that this really is the apocalypse?\" Jay sighed. I knew that this was probably the worst time to tell him how I felt about him. Then again, it was the end of the fucking world. Who knows how long it'd be before we got rescued. It was now or never. \"Jay, I've gotta tell you something,\" I said softly, placing my and hand on his wrist. Jay lifted his head too look at me, furrowing his brows in confusion. \"What is it, Lydia?\" I gulped. \"I…. I….\" Come on Lydia, don't be a pussy! Just fucking tell him! \"Look, whatever it is, just tell me. Considering the situation we're in, I'm sure it's not that bad,\" Jay replied, chuckling a bit. I felt my face heating up as he reached out and cradled my cheek. Alright, time to go with Plan B. aka Actions speak louder than words. Since Jay was slightly taller than me (and I didn't have my heels on at the moment), I had to stand on my tiptoes in order to do this. Doing so, I leaned forward and closed my eyes. His lips just barely brushed mine when I heard someone else coming up the stairs. \"Hey… Whoops, I'm sorry! Are you two having a moment? Because if you are, I'll just go,\" Jonah suggested, putting on that annoying America's sweetheart voice. I opened my eyes and looked at Jay. I couldn't tell if he was pissed at Jonah for interrupting us, or at the fact that Jonah still didn't get the hint that Jay flat out hated him. \"No, its fine, Jonah,\" I replied through clenched teeth as I turned around to look at him. \"Are you sure? Because I can go,\" Jonah pressed, raising a brow. \"What do you want, Hill?\" Jay growled, looking back down at the Bible. Jonah sighed. \"Look, I know those guys can be bullies sometimes. I saw you get hurt back there, Jay…\" Jay let out a snarky laugh, one that said \"Stop with the America's sweetheart bullshit, you're not fooling me.\" Jonah ignored Jay's laugh and looked at the Bible in his hands, \"Whatcha got there? The Holy Bible?! That's a pretty sick book. I follow a lot of principles in that thing. Don't tell me how it ends.\" Jay laughed again and I sighed, already knowing where this conversation was heading…. \"There's that laugh I love.\" Jonah grinned. \"Listen bud, there's no need. I'm onto you. There's nobody else around. It's just you, me, and Lydia. So, you can drop all of this fuckin' shit right now,\" Jay retorted, smirking at Jonah. \"What?\" Jonah asked innocently. \"Jay, don't-\" I tried to intervene, but Jay just shook his head. So much for trying to break up this argument… \"What?\" Jay mimicked, \"That's good stuff. That's good stuff. That's strong, nice colors. This whole 'nice guy' racket that you're runnin' down there? The other putzes might be buying it, but not this kid here.\" \"What?\" Jonah repeated, still confused at what Jay was getting at. \"I'm just saying that I know, and Lydia most likely does too, that deep down underneath you, maybe not so deep, probably pretty close to the surface… You are just bad news,\" Jay concluded matter-of-factly. Jonah clamped his hand over his mouth, clearly hurt by what Jay just said. \"Jay, I'm not bad news,\" he whispered. \"You're the worst news,\" Jay replied bluntly. \"I'm good news! I'm incredible news actually!\" Jonah insisted, \"I'm a Valentine-from-the-girl-you-like kind of news.\" \"No, you are your daughter's corpse was found at the riverside with all her belongings neatly stacked in a pile beside her.\" \"Alright, I'm the doctor calling to say that 'Guess what buddy? Even though you slept with that tramp, you don't have HIV.'\" \"You are a jarring imagery of a dead four year old girl in the streets of Sarajevo.\" \"No, I'm not! I'm the milk that nourishes that little girl back to health.\" \"No, you're the news that your favorite uncle actually had a boner every time you sat on his lap.\" \"I'm the reveal the dad Santa Claus and he cares about you more than some big guy in a suit.\" \"You are a can of Hearts of Palm.\" \"Jay, I think he gets the point,\" I hissed, putting my hand on his shoulder and giving it a light squeeze. I could tell that Jay's last comment had really struck a nerve because Jonah was looking at him like he had just betrayed him. Jonah shook his head. \"Listen, I'd be lying if I told you that this was not really hurting my feelings. In fact, it's breaking my heart. And more so, what about Seth and Anastasia? They've been such good friends to you and me. And they're stuck in the middle of this bickering on your end you know? And I'm trying to show you my worth, but you're not letting me do it with words and now I'm gonna have to do it with actions. Now spread those wings for me Big Bird,\" Jonah ordered, waving his hand back and forth in a flapping motion. Jay quirked a brow. \"I'm sorry?\" \"Spread those wings up for me.\" \"No.\" \"Spread your wings. Open your arms. I wanna give you a hug.\" Jonah walked over to Jay and tried to hug him but Jay pushed him away. Sighing, Jonah then turned to me. \"Alright Lydia, he's clearly not gonna spread his wings for me so I'm gonna need to give you a hug to convince him.\" I rolled my eyes. \"Yeah, I'll pass.\" Jonah scoffed and then turned to leave, \"Figure it out you two, my heart's this fuckin' big.\" He paused and curled both of his thumbs and index fingers into a big heart shape and pressed them against his chest, \"There's a lot of room for both of you.\" He then left the room, but of course, Jay wasn't gonna let that comment slide. \"HILL, YOU MAGNIFICENT BASTARD, I READ YOUR BOOK!\" Jay yelled after him before opening the Bible again. I couldn't help but burst out laughing after he said that. \"The only book I wrote was 'How to be Friends'!\" Jonah sassed back. Oh shit… \"Jonah!\" Jay whispered angrily, slamming the Bible shut in agitation. \"I'm just gonna let you cool down, I'll be down the hall,\" I mumbled before walking back down the stairs. I sauntered down the hall and stopped once I was standing right next to James and Anastasia's bedroom. I leaned against the wall and stared at the door, thinking of all the ways I could get my revenge on them for ruining my sleep. I could pour bleach on Franco's boxers, cut up their expensive sheets, cut up Franco's porno mag…. \"Why are you standing outside their bedroom?\" Jay asked, causing me to jump slightly. I turned around and giggled a bit. \"Oh nothing, I was just thinking of some ways to get even with James and Anastasia for ruining my sleep the other night….\" I replied, letting my voice trail off. Jay quirked a brow. \"What did you have in mind?\" I moved forward, until my body was pressed up against his. \"Us making them pay for it,\" I murmured seductively, trailing a finger down his chest, emitting a groan from him. \"Oh, fuck it,\" Jay whispered, before ducking his head towards mine and kissing me. It took me a second, but I began kissing him back. After about fifteen seconds or so, he pulled away and moved his lips down my jaw and neck. \"Jay….\" I moaned, trying to sustain myself as his hands roamed my body, \"Bedroom,\" I managed to groan out as he lightly bit down on my skin. The last thing I wanted was for us to fuck in the hallway. I squealed quietly as he suddenly cupped my ass and lifted me up. He opened the door with one hand and locked it behind him once we were inside. His lips were on mine as soon as I felt my back hit the bed. I threaded my fingers through his dark brown hair. My breath caught in my throat and my heart dropped to my stomach as his hands explored my torso. Jay suddenly pulled away, leaving me both dazed and stunned. \"Why'd you stop?\" I demanded, opening my eyes. He didn't answer; instead he opened the drawer of the bedside table and rummaged through it for a few seconds before pulling a small gold wrapper out. \"Better safe than sorry, right?\" he chuckled awkwardly before tearing it open using his teeth. \"Yeah, gotta wrap it before you can tap it,\" I snickered. I sat up, grabbed a fistful of his shirt and forcefully pressed my lips against his. Our tongues fought for dominance as Jay hurriedly tugged my black leather crop top over my head. I felt him smirk against my lips and I took this opportunity to separate us for a few seconds, so I could grab the hem of his shirt and take it off. I threw it across the room before I flipped him over and straddled him. For once, I completely forgot that we were in the middle of the apocalypse and struggling to survive. Those next few moments consisted of nothing but pure bliss and passion. Jay showed me things I never thought I'd feel again. I wanted to stay like this forever. \"Thank you, that was probably the best revenge ever,\" Jay breathed as I rested my head on his chest, running my fingers across his red Maple Leaf tattoo. \"You're welcome; it was a lot better than my other option….\" I mumbled before leaning over him and opening the bedside drawer again. He laughed lightly, \"Yeah? What was it?\" I fished out a lighter and a joint from the drawer, grinning mischievously as I lit it and put it to my lips. \"Cutting up James's precious porno mag\" He laughed again before grabbing the joint from my mouth and putting it to his lips. I rolled my eyes and snickered before lifting my hand and running my thumb across his cheek. \"Where have you been all of my life, Jay Baruchel?\" He inhaled deeply for a few seconds, before allowing the smoke to flow out of his mouth. \"Waiting for you,\" he murmured. With a content sigh, I then dipped my head to nuzzle his neck. Anastasia's POV Words could not express how infuriated I was with Jay and Lydia. They were going at it in our bed for crying out loud! Ugh, so much for those new sheets James just bought…. My mental rant was cut short when James came up behind me and put his hand on my shoulder. \"Hey babe, can I talk to you for a second?\" I nodded and he took me by the hand. He led me into another room and gave me a secretive smirk before handing me four crackers. \"Here, hide em.'\" \"Where did you get these? James, I really shouldn't,\" I said, shaking my head. He tucked a strand of hair behind my ear and kissed my forehead. \"The last thing I want is the love of my life starving to death. Besides, what's cheese without a few crackers?\" Smiling, I took the crackers and stuffed them in my back pocket. \"Good point.\" \"Spring Breakers forever, sweetheart,\" James said, wrapping his arms around me and pulling me close to him. Spring Breakers was probably the most erotic role I'd ever done. Mostly because it was the first film where I'd had to bare all. Other sexy roles that I'd done just required me to be in my underwear. James assured me that it wouldn't be that bad, and that I had a rockin' body and nothing to be ashamed of. I still remember stepping out of my trailer in nothing but my bikini for the spring break scene and seeing James's costume for the first time. I never laughed so hard in my life. Lydia's reaction to it was \"Wonderful, I have to suck tongue with a Slim Shady knockoff\" which made me laugh even harder. James and I had to do two sex scenes for the movie. The first one was when my character, Gia, was upset that Lydia's character, Nikki, left with Cotty after seeing her get shot in the arm. James's character, Alien, tried to convince Gia to stay as well and she need a way to get her mind off it all so she decides to have sex with him up against the bathroom wall. The second one was the infamous pool scene between James, myself, Ashley Benson, and Vanessa Hudgens. To this day, I still refuse to let my parents watch that movie. Not that I'm ashamed of doing it or anything, but come on, what parent wants to see their daughter doing two raunchy sex scenes? It was awkward enough walking in on them watching my sex scene with Chris in Superbad. Seth grinned at us. \"Let's do all the drugs.\" \"Eh, I don't really want to,\" Jay said reluctantly, taking a sip of his beer. \"Should've thought of that before you drank a can full of ecstasy,\" Seth smirked. \"What?! Jay yelped, instantly spitting it out. Within minutes, we were all higher than the Empire State Building. We all danced to Gangnam Style. James and I used his lights as light sabers while Jonah, Danny, and Lydia pulled out some cash and made it rain. Jay sat in a chair and we hoisted him up like he was in a Bar Mitzvah. Lydia gave Jay a lap dance to Dirty Dancer by Enrique Iglesias. FROM THE GUYS WHO BROUGHT YOU SUPERBAD AND PINEAPPLE EXPRESS. I fly like paper, get high like planes If you catch me at the border I got visas in my name If you come around here, I make 'em all day I get one down in a second if you wait Seth and I sat down in out Pineapple Express costumes and watched as James, who was also in his costume, did the worm on the floor. I don't know if it was the drugs talking or if we just bored, but we decided to make a sequel to Pineapple Express. COMES THE MOST ANTICIPATED SEQUEL IN HISTORY James lit Seth's seven-pointed joint, then took a puff off it before handing it to me. \"Should we call Red and get more weed?\" Seth asked us. James shook his head. \"I dunno know, man. That guy's gone crazy.\" In the next scene, Seth and James were sitting at the table with a briefcase in front of them. My character, Farrah, was tied to a chair nearby, giving James and Seth a pleading look. \"Good thing I have a lot of fucking weed for you guys,\" Danny (as Red) said. \"I hooked you guys up! Now I need you guys to assassinate –cue dramatic close up- Woody Harrelson.\" The scene switched to Jonah wearing a weed t-shirt and a cowboy hat with a goofy grin on his face. \"If pot's legalized, my business will suffer. And if my business suffers, I suffer. So much suffering, all because of that inbred, Hep-C Woody Harrelson,\" Red said bitterly in a voiceover. \"I have to do what's right. Weed is for the people. It's the people's weed,\" Jonah said, doing a pretty spot-on Woody Harrelson impression. It then cut back to Farrah, Saul, Dale and Red. \"If you don't assassinate him,\" Red warned, pointing the fake gun at Saul and Dale. \"I'm gonna assassinate both of you.\" Red got up, grabbed me by the hair and pressed the fake gun against the back of my head. \"And then I'm gonna assassinate you too!\" The scene cut to various crazy clips. Red pretending to smack me across the face while I was tied up, me screaming \"Help! Saul!\" in the process, Craig's character, Matheson, trying to kill Saul and Dale. All I wanna do is (BANG BANG BANG BANG!) And (KKKAAAA CHING!) And take your money All I wanna do is (BANG BANG BANG BANG!) And (KKKAAAA CHING!) And take your money \"B.F.F.F.F forever!\" Saul said to Dale. \"B.F.F.F.F!\" Dale said quickly. The last clip was of Red holding the fake gun to my head and grinning evilly at Saul. \"Red! Let her go! NOOOOOOOO! Farrah!\" Saul screamed. PINEAPPLE EXPRESS 2 BLOOD RED We all laid on the floor on some pillows and blankets, smoking weed while we watched the Pineapple Express 2 trailer on James's TV. \"We should do sequels to more of our movies,\" Seth commented. James laughed. \"How about we not do Your Highness 2?\" Danny snorted. \"Y'all need to do a Spring Breakers sequel while you're at it\" \"Now that you mention it….\" Lydia suddenly got up from where she was sitting and ran upstairs. She returned about a minute later with a smirk on her face and her iPod touch in her hand. She pressed a few buttons and Everytime by Britney Spears started playing. \"Come on ya'll, let's do it one last time for old times' sake... Notice me, take my hand,\" she sang. I took James's hand and we both stood up. Our bodies swayed to the music as we sang along. The rest of the boys watched in amusement as we reenacted our favorite scene from Spring Breakers . \"Everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby.\" James took both of us by the hands and spun us into him. We all laughed, and then Danny chanted \"Threesome! Threesome!\" Lydia scowled and flipped him off as we started sing again. \"I make believe That you are here It's the only way I see clear What have I done You seem to move on easy And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, you're haunting me I guess I need you baby I may have made it rain Please forgive me My weakness caused you pain And this song is my sorry-\" Our nostalgia moment was interrupted by someone pounding on the door. Oh God, now what?![Chapter 7] A/N: Hey guys, so I first want to start off by saying that I decided to change up Lydia and Anastasia's filmography a bit because I wanted them to do some more movies together instead of just two. You guys will also find out what those movies are, all of the other movie / TV roles they've done, and Lydia's first movie either in the next chapter or chapter nine. Another thing I want to tell you guys is that I've recently created Polyvore collection (huge thanks to LittleGee for inspiring me to do so :D) and it has all of Lydia and Anastasia's outfits along with Lydia's tattoos. The link to it is on my profile so feel free to check it out. Also, big thanks to jenniferemma .js for reviewing! And now, without further ado, here's chapter 7! ~Flashback ~ \" Yeah mom, I'm doing great. We just started shooting Knocked Up about a week ago, and so far, this has been one of the best experiences of my life,\" I said into the receiver as I walked towards my trailer. We were done filming for the day and I was more than ready for some much-needed R&R.; \" That's great, honey. I just want you to know that your father and I are so proud of you. You've come so far and I know you've got a bright future ahead of you. You deserve it,\" she replied. \" Awww, thanks mom. Just don't get over emotional if I ever win an Oscar,\" I snickered as I opened the door to my trailer and shut it behind me. \" Oh, you know I will, sweetheart. So, have you made friends with any of your co-stars?\" I nodded, gathering my keys and a few other things off my makeup table and shoving them into my purse. \"Yeah, they've been great. I've really hit it off with Seth, Craig, Jonah, and Jay. They're all like my brothers. I-\" A sudden knock on the door prompted me to put my conversation on 'pause.' Whoever it was, I didn't want to keep them waiting. \"Hey mom, someone just knocked on the door of my trailer, I'll call you later, okay?\" \" Alright honey, take care. I love you.\" I hung up the phone and slung my bag over my shoulder. I opened the door to see none other than James Franco standing right in front of me. My heart was hammering in my chest and I took everything I had not to melt right then and there. \" Hey, Anastasia right? Seth's told me a lot about you, I'm James.\" he gave me the famous Franco smirk as he stuck his hand out for me to shake. Okay, be cool, Anastasia. Don't act like an annoying fangirl, you're better than tha- OH MY GOD I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M MEETING THE SEXIEST MAN ALIVE! \" I-It's such an honor and privilege t-to meet you. I-I really, really love your movies,\" I stammered, eagerly grabbing his hand and shaking it. He chuckled. \"Why, thank you. Listen, Craig, Jonah, and I are about to hang out at Seth's house and I was wondering if you'd want to come? It's gonna be really fucking fun.\" \" Hmm, hanging out with James Franco, Jonah Hill, Seth Rogen, and Craig Robinson? Or going back to my place and watching The Simpsons? Yeah, I think I'll go with option number one,\" I replied with a giggle. \" Oh, you're a Simpsons fan? I'll definitely have to remember that,\" he said with a laugh, \"But hey, why don't you give me your number and I'll text you the address?\" \" Sounds like a plan,\" I replied, pulling my Smartphone out of my bag. I gave him my number and he entered it into his phone and put it back in his pocket. Just when I thought he was about to leave, he took my hand in his and kissed my knuckles. \"See you later, Anastasia,\" he gave me a flirtatious wink and then departed. \" So much for trying to keep my ovaries from exploding,\" I muttered under my breath. We all huddled close together as the banging continued to get louder and louder. James whipped out his prop gun and wrapped a protective arm around my waist. The items that we'd used to barricade the doors had been knocked off onto the floor. We all screamed as more and more items flew off the doors. I quickly hid behind James as the intruder stepped through the door and walked in front of us. The intruder turned out to be Emma Watson. \" Emma?!\" Seth and I screeched, our jaws literally dropping in surprise. We were all quick to relax since it was only Emma and not a mysterious creature hell-bent on decapitating us. \"Oh my God, you guys are alive!\" Emma said, lowering her axe and sighing in relief, \"You're actually alive! Thank God!\" Lydia and I had been good friends with Emma for about two years now. We met her at the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 premiere (which Lydia pretty much dragged me to) and she was really down to earth. Emma told us how she survived by hiding in a drainpipe for days and how she stopped hearing people, only growling noises. Jay tried to ask her if she saw anything pertaining to the apocalypse, but got nothing. Emma came to the conclusion that we were in the middle of a zombie invasion. As the guys got into a debate about the end of the world vs a zombie invasion, Lydia and I sat down with Emma on the couch. \"So, how are things going with you two? Other than… well, you know,\" she said. \"Trying to hold onto whatever sanity I have left,\" Lydia replied bluntly. Emma laughed, \"Oh come on, I'm sure things aren't that bad.\" \"They'd be better if McDouchebag wasn't here,\" she mumbled. I smirked at her, \"Wow Lydia, I thought you'd be on cloud nine after what you did with Jay a couple hours ago.\" Emma chuckled a bit, \"Well, it's about fucking time, Lydia.\" \"Bite me,\" she growled, her cheeks turning redder than a tomato. Rolling her eyes, Emma then looked at me, \"So, how are you and James?\" I smiled at her, \"We're good. He's really been helping me deal with all of this. I probably would've lost my mind by now if it weren't for him.\" \"You forgot to mention that he's an ass,\" Lydia mumbled. I sighed; Lydia and James had always had a bit of a love/hate friendship. Sometimes they got along, but other times they'd be at each other's throats. I didn't even have the balls to tell her about my engagement because God knows how she'd react. \"Lydia, would it kill you to at least be cordial with him?\" I groaned. She snorted, shaking her head in disbelief, \"After what he said at dinner? Fat chance.\" James gave Emma the bedroom so she could take a nap. Lydia, Craig, Jonah, Danny, Jay, Seth, and I stood the hallway as he shut the bedroom door. He looked at us and raised a brow. \"The fuck are you guys doing out here?\" he whispered. \"Here's what I think we should do. She's British, alright? She's used to eating shitty food anyway. Let's just give her all the shitty food that we don't want!\" Seth suggested. \"What the fuck, Seth?! Are you serious?\" I asked incredulously. James nodded in agreement. \"That's fucked up! Look how tiny she is! She's not even a full seven! She's like half a seven!\" \"This is a fuckin cool thing, man. I, for one am very excited. I'm a massive Harry Potter fan,\" Danny said. We all gave him a look. \"What?\" James asked. \"Yes, I love fuckin' Harry Potter . I cannot wait until she wakes up and I can ask her all these amazing questions about how they made those motion pictures,\" Danny replied. \"Take it easy, Dumbledore,\" James snapped. \"Guys listen listen,\"Jay spoke up. \"I think we need to address the elephant in the room.\" \"Whoa, Jay, don't talk about Craig like that,\" Seth said. \"That's fucked up. I'm right here man,\" Craig hissed. \"I'm not calling Craig an elephant!\" Jay exclaimed. \"That's racist!\" James scolded, frowning at Jay. \"I wasn't referring to him. I was referring to the issue that's on all of our minds,\" Jay said. \"Like what?\" James asked, quirking a brow. \"This is one girl in a house with six males. I-I think it's important that she feels safe and comfortable,\" Jay replied. I narrowed my eyes at him and crossed my arms. \"And what are we, Jay? Drag Queens?\" \"Yeah, what gives?\" Lydia huffed, putting her hands on her hips. Jay's hand's shot up in defense and he shook his head. \"No! No! No! Of course not! It's just that you two have known all of us for years. You're used to us and you know that we'll do whatever we can to make sure you guys are safe.\" \"I make no promises for Lydia on the protection part,\" Danny muttered. \"Go to hell and get fucked, McDouchebag!\" Lydia growled, giving him a murder glare. \"As I was saying!\" Jay cut in, \"We don't want to give off a bad vibe.\" \"What kind of vibes are you talking about?\" Seth inquired. \"He's talking about us giving off a rapey vibe,\" Danny said bluntly. We all quickly shushed Danny and then looked at Jay. \"What the fuck, man?! Why are you putting that shit in the mix?!\" James asked, disgusted. \"He fuckin' said it!\" Jay shot back, pointing at Danny. \"You're the one saying it! No one here is thinking about raping anyone,\" Danny stated. \"Well, you talking about vibes is the only thing that's rapey going on right now,\" James argued. \"Dude, nothing was rapey until you brought up the rapey vibe,\" Seth said. \"The one who smelt it, dealt it, dog!\" James lectured, wagging a finger at Jay \"True that, dude,\" Seth nodded, agreeing with James. James continued to harangue Jay. \"The one who denied it supplied it!\" \"Guys, guys, guys!\" Jonah cut in,\"Jay's not rapey, Jay couldn't rape a fly.\" \"For the love of all that is Holy, stop fucking arguing! Jesus!\" I yelled, trying to break up this fight before things got out of control. \"Fine, but for the record, if anyone's gonna rape anyone here, it's probably gonna be Danny!\" James jeered. Danny glared at him, now pissed off and insulted. \"What the fuck, Franco?! Why do you think I'm gonna rape somebody?!\" \"I'm just trying to lay it out there,\" James replied. \"I'm not gonna rape anyone, alright? If anyone's gonna rape somebody, it's Jay. He came up with the rape idea and his face looks like a police sketch of a fucking rapist.\" \"What the fuck does that mean?!\" Jay thundered. \"Shut the fuck up, Danny!\" Lydia barked, elbowing him in the gut. \"HEY!\" We all turned around to see a now pissed off Emma wielding her axe. \"Back the fuck up!\" \"What's wrong?!\" all of the boys asked nervously. \"What's wrong?! I just heard you guys talking about which one of you is gonna get to rape me, and possibly, Lydia and Anastasia!\" Seth shook his head. \"No, it's funny! It's funny we were specifically talking about not raping you... Ah!\" Emma stormed forward and slammed the handle of her axe against Seth's nose. Seth's glasses flew off his face and blood gushed from his nose. He yelled out in pain as he covered his nose with his hands. Emma backed the guys downstairs by swinging her axe at them repeatedly. We tried to tell her that this was all just a misunderstanding, but she wouldn't listen. \"Give me everything you have to drink! Put it in a bag!\" she demanded. \"There are eight of us! You cannot rob us!\" Seth shouted. \"I'm NOT fucking around!\" She swung her axe towards the penis statue, cutting almost half it off. The boys all screamed and quickly rushed to the kitchen. Seth and James frantically loaded all of the drinks in the green duffle bag used in Pineapple Express and handed it to her. \"Shoot her!\" Danny yelled. \"I'm not gonna shoot Emma Watson!\" James shouted back. Emma looked at Lydia and I. \"Look, since you two are my friends, I'm gonna offer you both the option to go with me. You can take it, or stay here and get raped by these assholes.\" I knew that this was probably the worst time to do this, but I didn't care. I held up my left hand, revealing my engagement ring to her and everyone else. \"It'll be a cold day in hell before I abandon my fiancé and my friends, Emma. So, thanks but no thanks,\" I said. \"Wait, you're engaged?! Since when?!\" Lydia yelled, turning her attention from Emma to me. Emma rolled her eyes. \"Whatever, congradu-fucking-lations, Anastasia. Now if you'll excuse me,\" she turned around walked towards the door, axing it down again. \"Oh, hell no! I'm not about to get dehydrated because Hermione's on her period!\" Lydia marched towards Emma. Emma shot her a glare, flipped her axe around, and swung it sideways, whacking Lydia right in the face with it. She screamed, stumbling backwards right into Jay's arms. \"Motherfucker!\" Lydia roared, holding the side of her face in pain. She glared at Emma, suddenly rushing forward and tackling her to the floor. She screamed angrily and began to pummel Emma with vicious punches. Emma screamed and threw her arms up in an effort to block them, but Lydia head-butted her and kept landing blows to her face. That's when Danny decided to intervene. He pulled her off Emma and threw her over his shoulder and she began to punch his back repeatedly. I could tell that Danny touching her was only pissing her off even more. \"Calm the fuck down, Lydia! This ain't Jerry Springer!\" Danny snorted, smacking Lydia's ass as she continued to struggle against him. \"Danny stop! You're only pissing her off even more!\" I shouted, waving my hands in the air in exasperation. \"Put me the fuck down! I'm gonna kick her in the goddamn throat so fucking hard, the only thing she'll be able to say for the rest of her life is 'Wingardium Leviosa'!\" At this point, Emma scrambled to her feet, grabbed the bag, and bolted out the door, disappearing into the thick fog. Danny set Lydia down, and she kicked him right in the stomach, causing him to yell out in pain. \"If you ever touch me again I swear to God I'll fucking shred you, McDouchebag!\" She hissed, glaring down him as he clutched his stomach. I ran my hands through my hair in frustration. Great, now we're going to die of thirst because Hermione just stole all of our shit.[Chapter 8] A/N: Hi everyone! So, first off I want to thank jenniferemma . js once again for reviewing. However, I would definitely appreciate some more feedback because I really want to know what your opinions are and any questions you may have. Anyways, enjoy! :) ~ Flashback (2009) ~ \" Have you told Jay you're madly in love with him yet?\" I teased as we walked towards my trailer. Lydia and I had been filming The Other Guys for about three weeks now. I was playing Vanessa, Michael Keaton's feisty daughter who joined the force not long after graduating the police academy. Lydia was playing my partner, Marcie, who also had a love / hate relationship with Mark Wahlberg's character. \" I don't know what you're talking about, Anastasia. We're just friends,\" she replied through gritted teeth as she sipped her Cinnamon Dolce Crème Frappuccino drink from Starbucks. I snorted. \"Bullshit. Lydia, you are so into him it's not even funny. When we were shooting Tropic Thunder, you were blushing the second he introduced himself to you and you kept smiling and giggling when you and him were being interviewed on set.\" \"… I'm ignoring you right now.\" \" Whatever you say, Mrs. Baruchel.\" Lydia's response was to flip me the bird as we walked into my trailer. As we walked inside, I was greeted by the sight of a bouquet of red roses sitting on my makeup table with an envelope taped to the vase. \" Whoa, who sent these?\" I blinked as I took the envelope off the vase. \" Are we being Punk'd right now?\" Lydia questioned, her eyebrows raised in suspicion as she looked around the room and under the table for hidden cameras. I shook my head, wondering who the hell would send me flowers since my last relationship ended pretty badly. Tearing the envelope open, I pulled out a sheet of paper that was in it: a poem? \"Is that a poem? What does it say?! What does it say?!\" Lydia asked eagerly as she put her chin on my shoulder to get a closer look. Clearing my throat, I began to read it aloud, \"'Your smile melts my heart. Your entire body is off the charts. Your beautiful hazel eyes brighten my day. To you I would like to say… I think you're wonderful, and you're someone that I woo. Finding a gorgeous girl like you, well, chances are few. I know more about you than I ought to. It may sound obsessive, but I want you. I love that you're smart, and you actually use your brain. And I can tell that your personality certainly isn't plain. So, in conclusion, you're someone I adore. And I'm sure you're wondering what I wrote this poem for. I would love nothing more than to be your guy. Which is why I gave this Secret Admirer thing a try.'\" \" Oh my God! You've got a secret admirer! You've got a secret admirer!\" Lydia said in a sing-song voice. \" Shut up! No I don't!\" I laughed, lightly elbowing her in the stomach. Boy, was I wrong. For the next week and a half or so, I received tons of gifts and love notes from my secret admirer. On top of that, he started texting me as well from an unknown number. I tried calling said number, but no voicemail had been said up and he's too shy to actually talk on the phone. This was driving me crazy. I had to know who he was. My prayers were finally answered when I was in my hotel room watching the Simpsons. I got a text from him asking me to meet him at this restaurant called Delmonico's. Of course, I happily obliged. I slipped on a black lace bodycon dress (one of the many gifts he gave me), curled my hair, slapped on some makeup, and slid on my black patent leather Christian Louboutin pumps. After calling a cab, I inhaled deeply and tried to prevent my hands from shaking as I pulled on my coat and grabbed my purse. 'Please don't let this be a sick joke. Please don't let this be a joke' Once I paid the driver, I got out of the taxi and walked into the restaurant and told the hostess my name. She led me to a very nice table and I had to keep from fidgeting when I sat down. Glancing down at my phone, I quickly typed out a text to let him know I was here and pressed 'send.' About a minute later, a red rose was placed on the table. I lifted my head to see James sitting right across from me. He was wearing a black suit and a suave smirk on his face. I could've melted right into the carpet if I wasn't so shocked. \" James? It's you?\" I asked, raising brow in confusion as I rose from my seat. He got up as well and walked over to me. \"Anastasia, I know this is unexpected, but ever since I first met you, ever since I first laid eyes on you... I knew you were the one. I wasn't lying when I told you how I felt about you, but I knew that you were going through a rough time and weren't ready for another relationship…. But, I need you to know…. That I am unconditionally in love with you.\" His words hit me like an axe to the chest. He was right, I didn't expect this at all, but I wasn't complaining either. I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel something for him too. He closed the distance between us by wrapping an arm around my waist and pulling me against him. It's safe to say I instantly felt fireworks when his lips connected with mine. A tired sensation ran through my body, causing my eyes to droop shut. James felt my body relax and took his this opportunity to entangle his tongue with mine. When we broke apart for air, we were both breathing pretty hard. Tons of people in the restaurant were cheering, awwing, and taking pictures on their phones, but we didn't care. Nothing could ruin this moment. He pressed his forehead against mine, his brown eyes gazing into my hazel ones. \"Will you be my girlfriend?\" \" Absolutely,\" I said. Not missing a beat, I threw my arms around his neck and crashed my lips against his. \"Alright guys, the door to the basement is out there, around the side of the house. I know for sure there's at least two jugs of water,\" James explained to us as we stood in by the front doors. \"Okay… Uh, any volunteers?\" Jay asked, looking at us expectantly. \"Does anyone wanna volunteer and go with Jay?\" Jonah spoke up. \"JONAH!\" Lydia screeched, giving him an appalled look. \"What?! I thought he said someone volunteer to go with him. I misheard, I'm sorry.\" \"You did not, you motherfucker!\" Jay said acidly, glaring at Jonah. \"Hey!\" Seth, who now had a big wad of tissue in one of his nostrils, interrupted, \"Okay, ease up. Just chill out, dude. Just relax, man.\" \"So, how are we gonna decide this guys?\" Craig questioned. James went over to the kitchen drawer and pulled out a box of matches. He took out eight of them and lit one of them. \"Whoever pulls the burnt match has to go get the water,\" Seth said. He blew out the flame, turned the matches around in his hand, and held them out for us to draw. \"Who wants to go first?\" James asked. Craig sighed. \"I'll do it.\" Slowly, he reached forward, hesitating for a few seconds, before pulling one of the matches out of Seth's hand. Sadly, it ended up being the burnt one. That's when Seth, Danny, and even James decided to be dicks and cheer loudly. \"Shut up! Don't rub it in!\" I barked, folding my arms. James sighed. \"You're right, you're right. I'm sorry, Craig. There's a lot of guys in here I wish it was instead of you,\" he said, nodding his head in Danny's direction. \"…. Ya'll wanna go best two out of three?\" Craig asked. Just to be on the safe side, I managed to find a long orange cord for Craig to wrap around his waist so that we could easily pull him back in if anything went wrong. \"If I tug, if I pull in any way. Or if you hear me screaming… Anything, you pull me right back in, alright?\" Craig ordered, tightening the cord around his waist. \"We'll try man, but you're pretty heavy,\" Danny said. \"What?\" \"Well, I'm saying- I just don't think it's smart to make any guarantees,\" Danny replied. Rolling my eyes, I smacked Danny upside the head before looking at Craig, \"We've got your back, Craig. Don't worry.\" \"Alright, you wanna do a test run?\" Danny inquired, referring to Craig's well-known, high-pitched scream. Craig did a test scream and we all pulled him back. Then, he slowly walked outside and Danny closed the door behind him. \"Let's just hope this doesn't backfire,\" Lydia muttered, tightening her grip on the cord. All of the sudden, the cord was yanked right out of our hands. I quickly drove forward and tried to grab it, but I wasn't quick enough. \"NOO! NOOO! Craig! Craig!\" I screamed, frantically looking out the door. About ten seconds later, there was a loud knock at the door. \"You guys! Pull me in! Pull me in!\" Craig yelled from outside. \"We don't have the rope anymore! We fuckin' dropped it! We're sorry!\" Seth yelled back. \"You got the rope man!\" James pressed. That's when we heard Craig start screaming and it didn't take a rocket scientist to know that something was out there. \"Craig! Craig!\" Lydia, James, Seth and I yelled. Craig hurriedly ran inside, leaning over to try and catch his breath. \"Craig, what the hell happened out there?!\" Lydia asked, putting a hand on his shoulder. \"I don't know! There's something out there-\"Craig was suddenly yanked backwards. Seth, Jay and I grabbed onto him. We all screamed and yelled as we played tug of war with the unknown creature outside. \"A knife! Somebody throw me a knife!\" Jay demanded. \"Okay!\" Jonah nodded and grabbed a kitchen knife off the table. Then he carelessly threw it to Jay and it wound up landing right in his thigh. Jay screamed in agony and Lydia turned her head and looked at Jonah in disbelief / agitation. \"Dammit Jonah! You had one fucking job!\" she spat before getting up and running towards one of the kitchen drawers. Jay screamed again as Craig the knife out of his thigh and used it to cut the cord. Thankfully for him, Lydia managed to find a rag for his wound and ran over to him. \"Just hold still, okay?! You're gonna be alright Jay. Just look at me, keep your eyes on me,\" she told him as she started to wrap the rag around his thigh. She tied it in a double knot before collapsing beside him, panting heavily. \"What the fuck was that!\" James shouted, looking out the fogged glass and then at Craig. \"I don't know what the fuck that was, but I ain't going back there!\" Craig said. \"Craig, you didn't even get any of the water!\" Danny, who decided to hide under one of James's tables, complained. \"The door was fucked up!\" Craig snapped. \"Dammit! This is so frustrating! It's so close! But so far! The water, it's like, right underneath us! Like, right there!\" James stressed, pointing to the floor. Jay quirked a brow, \"What do you mean right underneath us?\" \"Like, literally… Like, right there. If you went right through the floor…\" There was an awkward silence and Danny knocked on the floor a few times. So, here we all were, using kitchen utensils and other items to try and break through the floor. Since this was gonna be impossible for all of us to do in one sitting, we decided to take shifts. Once Lydia and I's shift was over, we walked upstairs to the attic and collapsed on the floor in exhaustion. \"Why didn't you tell me?\" She breathed, after a few moments of silence. I sighed, only Lydia would bring this subject up at the worst possible time. \"I was going to, but I didn't know how. I know you don't exactly get along with James, but it would really mean a lot to me if you tried to. Because when we do get Raptured, I want you to be the maid of honor at my wedding.\" \"Alright, for you, I will try. Plus, I've always wanted to be in a wedding,\" she smirked. She crawled over until she was sitting right next to me and sat down. \"Any ideas on how to get our minds off of this? At least for the next fifteen minutes.\" I shrugged. \"Wanna reminisce about all of the roles we've done and the music videos we've been in? You know, as a way to restore some sanity around here? You can go first.\" She nodded, \"Sure, you're on. Ah, I'll never forget my first role: Sin City . My first ever role was a self-governing, badass prostitute named Channing. And to think, I was only eighteen at the time too. I had to do a lot of hardcore training for that role, but in the end, it was totally worth it,\" she laughed. \"The following year, I had three roles. I played the very provocative, flirtatious, and insensitive sorority girl Holly in Black Christmas , who ended up getting her throat slit and her eyes plucked out. Then I co-starred in Stay Alive, playing Phineas and October's sister who survived at the end. And then I was in Smokin' Aces . I played Talia, the very exotic, but deadly assassin. This was the first time I got injured during filming. When we were shooting this very brutal fight scene and I tore my bicep and I tore a ligament that connects the forearm and the bicep and they had to call \"cut!\" My arm was swollen to about the size of a softball by the end of the day. Then, we had to delay filming because I unfortunately had to get surgery and spent the next two and a half weeks with my arm in a sling. Even after I had recovered and was ready to start filming again, I had to wear an arm brace just to be on the safe side. Then, once those films were released, I got two calls, one from Fergie asking me to be in her video London Bridge and the other from Akon asking me to be in him and Eminem's video Smack That. I can honestly say that 2005 and 2006 were both great years for me, excluding my injury of course. Alright Massaro, your turn. Tell me all about your 2007 through 2010 roles.\" Clearing my throat, I began to tell the tale of how I got into the business. \"Seems like only yesterday I moved from Houston to LA to pursue my dream. I was only twenty one years old and I was somewhat nervous because I was either going to achieve my goal and become an actress, or movie back to Houston and wait tables for the rest of my life. I looked online for some roles and I saw that there was going to be an audition for the role of Seth's sister, Dana, in Knocked Up , and that's where it all began for me. I auditioned, got the role, and not only did I meet Seth, Jay, Craig and Jonah, but I also met James as well. My next movie was Superbad I played Evan's rebellious cousin, Abby. I had a blast filming Superbad , but the only time I really got nervous during filming was when I had to do a sex scene with Chris. Lucky for me, I was in my underwear the whole time and so was he. Then, I auditioned for my first horror movie: Hostel: Part II, as Beth, Lorna, and Whitney's friend, Anya. I also really enjoyed working with Eli Roth. In 2007, after all three movies had come out, I was given the opportunity to appear in Paramore's Misery Business video, and Fall Out Boy's Thanks For The Memories video, where I got to kiss Pete at the end. The same year, I met you on the set of Tropic Thunder and we definitely hit it off right away. I also played Will Ferrell's sister, April, in Step Brothers and Saul Silver's girlfriend in Pineapple Express. The following year, I was in two horror movies. The first one was Saw 6 , as one of the co-workers on the carousel trap. The second one was Sorority Row , as Alana, and I was also lucky enough to co-star with you again. Then, James asked me to co-star with him in General Hospital which was pretty fun because we did a lot of kissing in it. Then, we both got a call from Adam McKay and he told us he wanted us to both be in his upcoming movie The Other Guys , which I also enjoyed filming. Then, of course, we were both in the music video When I Grow Up by The Pussycat Dolls and Telephone by Lady Gaga and Beyonce. Okay, you know the drill, Sky. Tell me about your movies from 2007 to 2011.\" Lydia switched positions, lying down on the floor and looking up at the ceiling. \"In 2007, I starred in Wrong Turn 2 , playing the shy girl, Taya. Then I played Chazz's crazy ex-girlfriend Heather in Blades of Glory . Towards the middle of the year, I landed the role of Layla, Augie's older sister in Role Models, Mia, the bookworm sorority sister in The House Bunny , and then of course, my role as the Prima Donna, London, in Tropic Thunder. In 2008, I only had a couple roles. I played Will Ferrell's sassy friend, Ashley, in Land of the Lost and the sarcastic sorority sister, Tila, in Sorority Row. After The Other Guys came out, you and I were both lucky enough to star as the sexy and deadly vampire best friends, Arianna and Phoebe for eleven episodes on The Vampire Diaries-\" \"And we both got to make out with Ian Somerhalder!\" I grinned. Lydia licked her lips and giggled. \"Oh yeah, and he was a very good kisser. Anyway, as I was saying, after The Vampire Diaries, I played Isabella, Kurt's cousin and co-worker in Horrible Bosses and Tara, Nick's cousin in 30 Minutes or Less . Alright Anastasia, it's your turn again. Go ahead.\" \"Well, after The Other Guys hit theaters , James persuaded me to co-star with him in Rise of the Planet of the Apes . Not long after that, I cast as Siren, Rocket and Sweet Pea's sister, in Sucker Punch. In 2012, I was on Danny's show Eastbound and Down for three episodes and I played a goofy stripper named Nevaeh. Following that, I was very thrilled because Matt Groening called me and he asked me to guest star as myself on an episode of The Simpsons. I was fangirling for days after that. The only roles I've got under my belt for this year are Gia from Spring Breakers, and one of Daenerys Targaryen's handmaidens on Game of Thrones , for about five episodes, Aletheia. And so far, those are the only two roles I was completely nude for. Welp, that concludes my filmography.\" Lydia chuckled. \"I know, we were both handmaidens on Game of Thrones and we both had to bare it all. Even though, I was only in it for about six episodes, I thought it was a great experience. Same with Spring Breakers . But, back to my filmography, last year I guest starred on Family guy as Bonnie's younger, alcoholic sister. My favorite role for that year was the hardcore, tough as nails S.H.I.E.L.D. / Avengers member, Nadia aka Velvet, in The Avengers. To this day, that role and my Sin City role are my all-time favorite roles because I'm a big comic-book fan and they were the most fun to co-star in.\" I smiled a bit. \"Wow, we've both come a really long way, haven't we?\" \"Damn straight!\" Lydia beamed before high-fiving me. Chuckling, I got up from where I was sitting and walked towards the door. \"Well, if you excuse me, I'm gonna go see if the bozos downstairs need any more help.\" \"Good luck,\" she mumbled. \"Thanks, at this rate, I'm gonna need all the luck in the world.\" Well, there's chapter 8! I hope you guys enjoyed it! I also wanted you guys to see what Anastasia and Lydia's filmographies were since I only briefly mentioned a few movies that they were in a few chapters back. Also, pics of all of Anastasia's gifts are on my Polyvore collection so feel free to click the link on my profile and check em' out. With that being said, please, oh please review! :D[Chapter 9] A/N: Hey, everyone! I hope you all enjoyed last chapter and Lydia and Anastasia's filmographies, but as I said previously, I really do appreciate any feedback you guys have. So, if you get the chance, please don't hesitate to leave a review. If you do, I'll give you a virtual cookie! :) Morgan – Thank you so much! I really wanted everyone to see why they started dating and I also wanted to make it as romantic as possible. And I'm really glad you liked reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it. :D After a few hours of constantly hitting the concrete, we now a semi deep hole in the middle of the floor. I was praying that it would just give in and break already because I didn't know how much longer I could take this. Our hard work was put on hold when James started hollering upstairs. \"Who did this?! Who did this?!\" Seth, Danny, and I looked up at the second floor hallway where James was standing. \"What's wrong, babe?\" I asked, leaning on the extra baseball bat I'd been using to dig through the floor. \"What are you talking about?\" Seth inquired. James held up what appeared to be a porno mag and something else behind it, but I couldn't quite see what it was. \"Jizzed all over the pages of this nice magazine that I was nice enough to tell you about!\" \"Clearly, it wasn't me,\" I retorted, shaking my head. \"What it you, Seth?!\" James yelled. Seth shook his head. \"No.\" Danny rolled his eyes and raised his hand. \"It was me, Franco. I fuckin' made jizz in your magazine.\" \"What?!\" James screeched. \"When I fuckin' jack off long enough, I end up jizzin', dude!\" Danny quipped. \"I'm assuming, the same shit works for you?\" \"Real fuckin' smart answer!\" James thundered. \"Why don't you fuckin' aim, huh?!\" \"I have a particularly explosive ejaculate.\" Danny snapped. \"It just goes everywhere. It's like a fuckin' wild fireman's hose - you just got to grab on and pray to God it doesn't get into your eyes or your mouth!\" \"The fuck kind of jerking off is that?!\"James shouted. \"What, you never had any brothers? You never learned to jizz in a fuckin' sock or on a fuckin' tissue?!\" I couldn't help myself, by this point I was laughing so hard my stomach hurt. James, still butthurt over Danny ruining his porno mag, glared down at me. \"It's not fucking funny, Anastasia!\" James hissed. \"I doubt you'd be laughing of you saw what else he jizzed on!\" He pulled the mystery object out from behind the porno mag and held it up in front of the porno mag. My jaw dropped once I saw what it was…. A magazine that had Lydia and I's rather racy Spring Breakers promotional photoshoot in it. \"What the fuck, Danny?!\" I hollered, punching him in the arm. \"Now, you're really crossed the line! Do you seriously have no self-control whatsoever?!\" \"If anything, you both should be flattered!\" Danny retorted, rubbing his arm. \"You both looked fuckin' hot in those bikinis! And that one pic of you sucking on a popsicle made me hard as a fucking rock.\" \"Ugh, what the hell are you guys bitching about now?\" I turned my head to see Lydia walking down the stairs. Her usually tan skin was now almost as pale as a sheet and she looked like she was about to faint any second. \"Lydia, are you alright? You look really pale,\" I said, concerned. She nodded, \"Yeah, I'm fine... Just tell me what's going on.\" \"Well, McBride over here decided to jizz all over the promotional photoshoot we did for Spring Breakers!\" I said hotly, nodding my head in his direction. Lydia shot Danny a death glare. \"You're lucky I'm on the verge of dying of thirst right now, McDouchebag, because if I wasn't, I'd twist your spine into coat hanger!\" \"Oh, like I've never heard that before!\" Danny retorted, before looking back at James. \"But, to answer your question, Franco, I don't have any brothers! I was raised in a house of women!\" \"I highly doubt they fucking taught you to fucking close your eyes and fucking cum wherever you want!\" James spat. \"I mean, you're getting all worked up over a fucking porno mag!\" Danny shouted. \"Who has goddamn porno mags anymore?! Welcome to the twenty-first century, Buck Rogers! You designed a house with fucking iPads in the walls, and yet you're jacking your dick like a goddamn pilgrim!\" \"That's right man! I like to fucking read!\" James sneered. \"You think that's the only thing I jerked off in here?!\" Danny retorted. \"I've been dropping loads around this fuckin' house like a goddamn dump truck!\" \"You don't cum on my stuff!\" James yelled. \"I'll cum wherever the fuck I want, James!\" Danny growled. \"I'll fuckin' cum in your kitchen, I'll cum on your fuckin' art, I'll cum anywhere I want!\" \"I will fuckin' cum right on you!\" James shouted, exchanging jack-off gestures at Danny. \"I will cum like a fuckin' madman all over you, McBride!\" \"Ooh! I fuckin' wish you'd cum on me right now!\" Danny challenged. \"I fuckin' dare you to cum on me!\" \"Seriously, you guys?! This really isn't the time to-!\" I tried to intervene as they kept exchanging masturbation gestures at each other, but my attempt was quickly thrown out the window. \"I'm gonna jack my dick so fuckin' hard in here!\" Danny growled, vigorously jacking off the baseball bat between his legs. \"This,\" James exchanged another gesture. \"No more, man! All over your fuckin' face!\" \"...All over the fuckin' floor, all over the fuckin' place!\" I sighed. Is this really what it's come to? Fighting over provocative magazines like a couple of ten year olds? \"I'll fuckin' cum anywhere I want! I'll fucking cum on these walls! I'll cum on the fucking cabinets! On the fucking furniture! I'll cum everywhere!\" Danny yelled. \"If I see your dick one more time, I'm gonna fuckin' shoot it off!\" James hissed, pointing his gun at Danny. \"You don't have enough bullets, bitch!\" Danny spat. \"No fucking jerking off in my house McBride!\" James yelled, waving his gun at Danny one last time and stormed off towards our bedroom. Danny angrily threw his bat down. \"Fuck this!\" \"Danny, come on,\" I said. \"I'm too thirsty to do this!\" Danny argued. \"And the fucking bitter irony is I'm not gonna have my thirst quenched until I finish this! Goddammit, I hate it!\" Danny started to walk away. \"Danny, no! Don't walk away!\" Seth ordered. \"Danny, don't walk away from me!\" \"It's too late, Seth!\" Danny declared, not turning around. \"I've already walked away too much!\" \"Bullshit, you can still come back and help us!\" I said irritably. \"Danny!\" Seth hollered. \"Daniel!\" But Danny had already walked around the corner and down the hall. Letting out a frustrated groan, I turned my head and looked over at Lydia. \"Hey, can you give us a hand?\" She didn't answer. Instead, she suddenly hunched over and threw up all over the floor before collapsing like a house of cards. \"LYDIA!\" I screamed, rushing over to her. I held her in my arms and shook her rapidly. \"LYDIA! LYDIA! WAKE UP!\" Tears started to well up in my eyes and I began to panic as the realization hit me: she was dehydrated. Seth and Jay were at my side, both of them were trying to get her to come to as well. \"S-She's not waking up! What do we do?! Lydia, wake up! Come on, Lydia, don't die on me!\" Jay yelled / pleaded. But it was useless; Lydia wasn't waking up unless she had that water in her system. \"She's dehydrated,\" I said, trying to keep my emotions under control. \"T-The only way she'll wake up is if we get that water as soon as possible. So Seth, I'm gonna need you to help me dig through the floor. And Jay, you stay here with Lydia okay?\" They both nodded and Seth and I walked back over to the hole. For the next half hour, we kept hitting the floor, which still wasn't collapsing. Jay had set Lydia down on the couch and didn't leave her side. Seth and I were exhausted and thirsty, but we also knew that if we didn't find this water soon, we'd all die of thirst. \"So,\" Seth said suddenly. \"Remember that time we were at Franco's party and you got drunk off your ass and suggested we all play truth or dare?\" I snorted, \"Yeah, and then Danny dared me to play one round in my underwear, and being completely wasted, I stripped down in like ten seconds. If I recalled correctly, you decided to take advantage of that glorious opportunity too, Rogen.\" Seth laughed. \"I dared you to go on Franco's front yard and sing the \"I'm a Little Teapot\" song.\" \"And then you filmed it and put it on YouTube, you ass!\" I retorted, playfully hitting him in the chest. He smirked. \"I think what Lydia dared Danny to do was way worse than what you had to do. She dared him to take his shirt off, put on a pink bra, and run outside chanting \"I am woman, hear me roar!\" and \"Damn, these crabs really itch!\"\" \"I think that may have been the best dare in the history of dare-\" I started to say, but was cut off when the floor suddenly collapsed underneath us. \"Son of a bitch!\" I ground out as instant pain coursed through my body. Now, I had done some pretty excruciating stunts in my movies before, but I think falling right through the floor just topped all of them. \"Are you guys okay?!\" James yelled, looking down at us. Seth groaned in agony. \"I broke my ass in half!\" \"Shit! They got through!\" James exclaimed happily. \"You guys fuckin' did it!\" Danny smirked. \"Oh my God!\" James shouted. \"I loosened this up for you, I'll have you know,\" Danny boasted. \"Yeah, and then you threw a bitchfit and stormed off,\" I mumbled, getting to my feet. \"It's fucking dark down here!\" Seth said, getting to his feet as well and looking around. \"Hold on.\" Craig reached into his pockets and pulled an orange flashlight keychain out. He turned it on and tossed it down to Seth. \"That's Terrence Peterson, my monkey flashlight keychain,\" Craig explained to us. \"Do you guys see it?\" James asked, referring to the water. Seth shook his head, \"No, are you sure it's even down here?\" \"Yeah, I think it's this way,\" I told him. I led the way as we started to walk around the basement. We spotted a few of James and I's costumes and props, but no water. We kept moving until we came across James's Green goblin cardboard cutout from Spiderman 3, which instantly scared the shit out of both of us. \"What?! Is someone down there?!\" I heard James shout. \"It's your fuckin' stupid cutout from Spider-Man 3. Jesus Christ,\" Seth said. Just when it seemed like all hope was lost, Seth moved the cardboard cutout aside and spotted… the water! \"There it is! We found it!\" I screamed excitedly. After we cheered for joy for about five minutes, we poured a glass of water for Lydia and Jay carefully poured it down her throat. Thankfully, it was just enough to cause her to regain consciousness. We all clanked our water-filled martini glasses together as we sat around the dining room table. \"Mmm, that is so fucking good,\" Seth commented after taking a sip of his water. \"The two heroes over here, breaking through the floor and saving Lydia's life,\" James grinned at Seth and I. Seth and I high-fived each other and Lydia thanked us repeatedly for saving her life. All of us were so deep in conversation that we didn't even notice what Danny was doing until Craig said something. \"Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?!\" Craig exclaimed. \"What am I doing?\" Danny repeated, casually pouring himself another glass of water, causing all of us to yell at him. \"What? I'm just pouring myself another glass of water to wash down that dry ass Cinnamon Toast Crunch,\" Danny replied. \"That's very nice, but you can't just pour yourself another glass of water, man! Will you cut it out?!\" James barked. \"We agreed to one glass at dinner, we voted on it,\" Seth said. \"We're supposed to make it last, remember?\" I piped up, narrowing my eyes at Danny. \"Well man, I'm just getting sick and tired of all these fuckin' rules. You don't see me putting rules on you guys,\" Danny pointed out. \"You cannot have another glass of water,\" James stated firmly. \"Lydia weighs a hundred and seventy pounds less than me. Why the fuck is fair that she and I drink the same amount of water?! We should be dividing our rations based on our proportionate size,\" Danny replied. Lydia rolled her eyes. \"Just shut up and sit down, McDouchebag.\" \"I don't wanna come off as a dive here or anything,\" Jonah cut in. \"It's just that I think everyone should split everything equally.\" \"I just think that everybody should have the fuckin' same. I have a Goddamn earring,\" Danny mimicked. \"Shut the fuck up, Jonah!\" \"You know what Danny? If you weren't jizzing all the time maybe you'll be more hydrated,\" James lectured. Danny glared at him. \"You're making me into a joke right now Franco, and you are not gonna like the fucking punchline.\" \"No more jerking off, no more water, just sit the fuck down!\" \"Okay, I'm done, I'm not gonna have any more water….\" Without warning, Danny picked up one of the jugs of water and began to douse himself with it. We were all quick to try and stop him, but the damage was done. Danny was now drenched in more than half the water. \"You guys made this happen! You guys forced my fuckin' hand by ganging up on me!\" Danny argued. \"You just killed us all! Thanks a lot, asshole!\" Lydia hissed. \"Goddammit, I'm gonna fucking kill his motherfucker!\" James fumed, pointing his prop gun at Danny. Danny grabbed the barrel of the gun and put it inside the mouth. Once he saw that James wasn't going to pull the trigger, he yanked out of his mouth. \"That's what I thought, nerd!\" Danny seethed. He stormed off, leaving us all standing there shocked and livid.[Chapter 10] A/N: Hey guys! So, I'm not gonna give out any spoilers or anything, but I can tell you that this is gonna be a very emotional chapter. Oh, and you'll most likely want to punch Danny in the throat too. I'd also love to know what you guys think of Danny's 'pipe bomb' on the girls so please review! Kodaful1 – You're welcome! It makes me really happy that you liked their filmographies and the fact that this story is jay/oc also. Well, I don't want to give that part away, so you'll just have to wait and see what happens. Thanks for reviewing! :D Danny's behavior only got worse over the next few days. He drank almost all of the water and we had little to no food left. After he stole one of James's tuxedos, he ate more of our food and passed out next to the fireplace. \"Alright guys,\" James said as we stood in the kitchen, staring at Danny as he slept. \"Let's get rid of him.\" \"What?\" Seth asked, shocked. \"What do you mean? Like kick him out of the house?\" I sighed. \"I don't think that's a good idea, James. I mean, he could be killed if we kick him out….\" \"Like yes, like totally kick him out of the house,\" James clarified. \"Anastasia's right, he could die,\" Craig said. \"If he stays, he could kill us!\" James hissed. \"I'm with Franco on this one,\" Lydia piped up. \"We need to get him the fuck out of here.\" \"Exactly! His fuckin' reckless behavior is dragging us all down!\" James said. \"I mean he wasted our water twice!\" He held up two fingers to prove his point. \"Two times! Two times! When you were outside Craig, he was laughing! When we all thought you were dead, he was laughing!\" \"James, stop!\" I spat, shooting him a death glare. \"Dan is under a lot of pressure okay?\" Jonah said softly. \"And he's not handling it as good as the rest of us are. We just need to give him space and let Danny do Danny.\" \"Danny's done Danny!\" James argued. \"I'm not gonna let Danny do Danny anymore!\" \"Danny did Danny, but he's gotta do a little more to get to the end Danny! H-He's gotta do some more Danny.\" \"Danny's dun done Danny! And it's too much Danny!\" \"No man, no,\" Craig said. \"It doesn't matter how much of a prick he's being or whatever else. Everybody deserves a second chance, right Jay?\" Jay smiled. \"That's exactly right.\" \"Wow, fuckin' wow. What a surprise, Jay disagrees with me,\" James said scornfully. \"What in the fuck?!\" Jay exclaimed, throwing his hands in the air in incredulously \"This really isn't the time to be starting shit, Franco!\" Lydia huffed, running a hand through her hair. James ignored her and glared at Jay. \"You've had it out for me since the very beginning, Jay!\" \"I don't know you! I've had it out for you?! I don't fuckin' know you!\" Jay shouted. \"That's right! You don't even know me and you come into my house and the first five minutes you start insulting my fuckin' art! That's an extension of me because I like that. You insult that and you're insulting me. And when Danny jizzes on my magazine, he's jizzing all over my face! And when he poured that water on himself, he was pouring all of our life bloods all over himself and he was fucking laughing!\" \"… This is literally the most I've ever talked to you.\" I groaned in annoyance. \"We're getting sidetracked, again! Jesus Christ!\" \"He's like a little bumblebee,\" Jonah said. \"He's scary at first when he buzzes around your face, but then... he just goes out the window. Or, he stings you once and then he dies.\" \"Jonah' right,\" Craig nodded. \"He is like a bee and you catch more bees with honey than with vinegar juice.\" James rolled his eyes. \"Look at him! He's wearing my fucking tuxedo! He's been eating nonstop! The fucker's gained weight since he got here! The fucker's gots to go! Go! The fucker's gots to go !\" \"Danny's like a baby, okay? Just a little baby, and right now he needs our tit in his mouth,\" Craig said quietly. Lydia snorted. \"In that case, I don't want Danny anywhere near my tit.\" \"Anastasia please, speak some reason into these fucking guys,\" James said, turning his attention to me. I sighed. \"Look James, I know that you and Danny don't exactly see eye to eye, but I really don't think we should kick him out. He's been our best friend for years….\" Jay nodded in agreement. \"This is the group, we've been through all of this together. We can't-\" James cut him off. \"He's fucking dead weight and you all fucking know it!\" \"I'm not arguing against you,\" Craig said. \"I'm just saying, let's start with love.\" Ultimately, we all voted to kick Danny out of the house. We woke him up, sat him down on one of the living room couches, and told him that he needed to get out. \"Is this how you all feel?\" Danny asked sadly. \"We talked about it,\" Jay muttered. \"You guys are gonna vote me off the island? I mean, I made you guys breakfast….\" \"Shit man, you wasted half of our food when you did that!\" James said angrily. \"Just thought I was doing something nice for you guys,\" Danny said dejectedly. \"Just to apologize for my behavior at the party.\" He looked down. \"A party I wasn't even invited to. I'm not an idiot. I know why you guys don't fucking call me or hang out with me anymore. It's because I party so fucking hard. Always have. Ever since I was a baby. I wouldn't just suck on my momma's titties. I would fucking… bang 'em, and motorboat 'em.\" I looked down, feeling the guilt rise in my chest rise like a tidal wave. Sure, Danny had his moments where he was a complete douchebag, but he was still one of my best friends. I'd known him for years and I just didn't feel right kicking him out. My head was telling me not to feel sorry for him because he wasted our water and our food, but I couldn't help it. \"Everything I've been doing has just been a cry for help,\" Danny said. \"When I came on your magazine, James, and on Lydia and Anastasia's pictures, it was a cum for help. I've just been crying and cumming, and crying and coming… tears from the tip of my penis dudes.\" \"I'm sorry, alright?\" James said, on the verge of tears. \"You can cum wherever you want.\" \"I don't even care about cumming anymore,\" Danny said pessimistically. \"Right now, I'm kinda into going.\" He stood up, ignoring all of us saying his name repeatedly. The only one who wasn't saying his name or apologizing was Lydia. \"Let's just discuss it some more, okay?\" James offered. \"Yeah, let's just talk, dude,\" Seth agreed. \"We're giving you an option. It's a choice, man!\" \"There's nothing to figure out alright?\" Danny asserted. \"You guys have said enough, and there's no going back anymore. I don't know if there maybe is, like, something you guys could give me so I could at least have some sort of protection while I'm out there?\" \"Danny you don't have to do this,\" Craig said. \"Alright, if you're really leaving,\" James said. \"Then you should take this.\" He held out his prop gun. \"Really?\" Danny asked. \"You don't know what's out there,\" James replied. Danny took the prop gun. \"Thank you, James. It really means a lot to you, and I appreciate that you'd give this to me, you stupid… stupid motherfucker!\" Before I could even blink, Danny suddenly fired six shots at us. I screamed loudly as I felt my life flash before my eyes. We all clutched our chests, checking for any bullet wounds. I couldn't help but sigh in relief when I realized that James's gun had been filled with blanks the whole time. \"Fucking psychopath!\" James spat, yanking the revolver out of Danny's hand. \"It's a prop gun! What, do you think I'd put real bullets in here?!\" \"You were gonna send me out there with a fucking gun filled with blanks?!\" Danny yelled angrily. \"Oh, fuck you!\" Seth shouted. \"Don't turn this around on us! You just tried to shoot us, you fucking dickhead!\" \"Oh, whatever!\" Danny snapped. \"Fuckin' civilization is broken down. There's no reason for this false bullshit! You guys act like you're so fucking high and mighty, like you never made a goddamn mistake before! Franco, you're just a pretentious fucking nerd!\" \"Fuck you!\" James quipped. \"And Jonah,\" Danny jeered. \"You fucking cunt.\" Jonah looked like Danny just punched him in the mouth. \"Craig,\" Danny said, turning to him. \"You didn't have my back, back there. You disappoint me.\" \"Bro,\" Craig said quietly. \"And Seth,\" Danny turned his attention to him. \"You duplicitous taint.\" \"What?!\" Seth exclaimed. \"And then of course there's Jay,\" Danny sneered. \"The self-righteous, cock-sucking, two-faced backstabber.\" \"What the fuck are you talking about?!\" Jay demanded. \"I overheard your little conversation with Craig, alright?\" Danny confessed. \"The only reason why you care about any of us is because you think that's what God wants you to do. You don't give a shit about us!\" \"No, no, no, no, that's fucking twisting that shit,\" Jay urged. \"You're fucking lying!\" \"Am I twisting this?\" Danny demanded. \"I believe you were in Los Angeles two months ago at the Four Seasons. I saw you there're, and you specifically asked me not to tell Seth, so you could maintain the allusion that you always stay with Seth when you're in Los Angeles.\" \"Oooh,\" Craig scolded. \"Jay!\" \"The fuck, man?!\" Seth demanded. \"It's not….\" Jay tried to explain himself. \"It's…\" \"Textbook twattage,\" Danny concluded, making a book-shape with his hands. \"However, that's not all. These two have some skeletons in their closets as well.\" Danny gave Lydia and I a mischievous look. \"Danny, don't,\" I whispered, giving him a pleading look because I knew that what he was about to say was going to devastate James. \"Please don't do this.\" Even Lydia was begging him not to say anything. \"Danny…. I know that I've been a huge bitch to you all these years, but I'm begging you, please don't tell them… Please….\" \"Danny, what the fuck are you talking about?\" James asked angrily. Danny let out a sadistic laugh. \"I'll get to you and your fiancé in a second, Franco… But right now, I want you all to know the real Lydia Sky,\" he looked at her, showing no remorse as she kept begging him to keep his big mouth shut. \"It's a shame Jay doesn't know what kind of girl you really are, Lydia. I mean, you've obviously been in love with him for years, so I have to ask… Did you even think about him at all when none other than Dave Franco was fucking your brains out in my bedroom, at my house party?\" \"... You fucked my brother?!\" James spat, disgusted. \"What the fuck, Lydia?!\" \"What?!\" Jay exclaimed. \"Lydia, is that true?\" Tears welled up in her eyes and she slowly nodded her head. \"Yes…..\" \"You see, Jay… Lydia's like a doorknob, everyone in Hollywood's had a turn,\" Danny said maliciously. \"She's probably slept with countless fucking directors to get to where she is today. She's as fake as those boobs of hers and she's the biggest slut in LA.\" \"FUCKER!\" Lydia screamed before running towards Danny. Jay quickly grabbed her and threw her down on the floor, pinning her down with his body weight and preventing her from putting Danny in the morgue. She screamed some more and yelled various threats at Danny. Lydia had reached her breaking point. Smirking in satisfaction, Danny looked at James and I. \"Now, here's the biggest secret of all. So Franco, did Anastasia ever tell you that you knocked her up?\" \"WHAT?!\" James shouted, immediately looking at me in disbelief. \"But, of course,\" Danny said nonchalantly. \"You couldn't really tell that she was pregnant in the first place since she aborted the baby only a few days after she found out. Oh, and this was about a month before ya'll started filming Spring Breakers. According to my calculations, she's been keeping this dirty little secret from you for over a year now.\" I couldn't hold my tears back anymore. They had already starting running down my cheeks by the time Danny finished his 'pipe bomb.' Lydia and Seth were the only ones who knew my secret. Danny overheard me telling Seth but promised that he wouldn't say a word to James or anyone else. So much for keeping that promise. James wouldn't even look at me, but I already knew that he was crushed. He always talked about wanting kids one day, and I has just shattered all of his hopes of having them. \"And just for the record, you guys,\" Danny said. \"I'm choosing to leave. You're not kicking me out. You guys had already said that I can come back again and I'm the one who said that I'm not coming back in. Don't be cocky.\" With that said, Danny opened the doors behind him, gave us the double finger, and took his leave. At that point, Jay got off of Lydia and Seth looked at him. \"Is that true?\" Jay looked at him and nodded. \"Yes…\" \"Jay,\" Jonah intervened. \"I know that this is probably my fault because I put you on a pedestal, but you should not be dishonest with your friends. You really let me down.\" Jay glared at Jonah for a few seconds, and then punched him right in the face. Seth shook his head and stormed off and James scolded Jay, but Jay had had enough. \"Yeah, it's all fucked isn't it?!\" Jay scowled and stormed off as well, with Lydia following him. \"Jonah, you okay?\" James asked, once they both left. \"Ah! Yeah, his insides hurt worse than my outsides,\" Jonah replied. After that fiasco, I went upstairs to our room and sat down on the bed. I couldn't believe that Danny would stoup so low, but he did, and now I was about to pay the price for his actions. \"So, when were you gonna tell me?\" James asked, taking off his cardigan and throwing it into one of our drawers. He was angry and devastated. That much was clear. \"James, I wanted to tell you, but…\" I choked out, feeling the tears sting my eyes again. \"But what?!\" he demanded. \"You could've told me, Anastasia! As much as I want kids one day, I would've understood!\" \"Stop it! I know I fucked up, okay?! Stop reminding me! It was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do and I could barely live with myself afterwards!\" \"You wanna know what hurts the most? The fact that you kept this from me for so long. I would've helped you get through it because I love you! You have no idea, Anastasia, how much I love you… But, I need some time to think…\" I looked at him for a few seconds before glancing down at the ring on my finger. I wrapped my fingers around it and pulled it off my finger. \"Take all the time you need,\" I mumbled, placing it in his palm. A tear rolled down his cheek as I took a step back from him. I couldn't be in the same room as him right now. I had to get away from him. Not wasting another second, I ran out of the room and into one of the bathrooms down the hall. I slammed the door behind me before collapsing on my knees on the cold floor. I just wanted to curl up in a ball and put an invisibility cloak on me for the rest of my life. James was devastated, and he had every right to be. I brought this on myself. Lydia's POV \"Jay! Jay! Jay, just talk to me! Just let me explain! Please!\" I cried as I tried to catch up with him. \"Just leave me alone, Lydia. I really don't want to hear it right now!\" Jay shot back as we walked back into the living room. \"It was one time Jay! I swear to God! It was one time and we were both drunk! It meant nothing!\" He sat down on the couch and ran his hands through his hair in irritation. \"Just leave me alone alright? I don't want to talk about this right now. Just go,\" he mumbled. \"Fine,\" I whispered, turning to leave. \"You wanna know something?\" he said suddenly. \"I thought you were better than that. I really thought you were different, Lydia, but now I see that you're not. You're just like all the other plastic fantastics in Hollywood.\" His words cut me up like a knife. More tears fell from my eyes as I walked away from him. I'd never felt so defeated, so shattered... Both Jay and Danny's words were enough to break me. For the first time in my life, I was broken. Broken beyond repair.[Chapter 11] A/N: Hello there, everyone! So yeah, I know it's been weeks since I last updated and I want you all to know that I have not abandoned this story. I've just been busy studying for and taking midterms, celebrating my sister's birthday, and all that hullabaloo. Anyways, please read and enjoy! Morgan – Thanks! I'm so happy that you enjoyed this chapter. Dramatic was definitely what I was going for and I'm glad that I achieved that. Thanks again for reviewing! ^_^ LittleGee – You're absolutely welcome! And I completely agree, he's a heartless douchebag and it really sucks that Anastasia and Lydia's relationships are pretty much dead now because Danny couldn't keep his big mouth shut. Thank you so much for leaving a review for me! :D Guest – Yes, she did have a reason for the abortion and in this chapter you'll see why she did it. Well, the reason why Jay was really mad at her is because deep down he's secretly liked her ever since they met on the set of Tropic Thunder and he never thought she'd do something like that. Plus, he's now got it in his head that's she's possibly whored around like Danny said and that she's just been stringing him along this whole time. Still, I can see where you're coming from though, what he said was really uncalled for. Especially since he's made mistakes as well. James refused to speak to me when I finally stopped crying and walked back into our room. Part of wanted to kill Danny with my bare hands for telling James what I did. Another part of me blamed myself for not telling James sooner. Yeah, he would've been upset even then, but it would've been nothing compared to how devastated he was now. For the most part, I was tossing and turning the whole night. Every time I went to shut my eyes, Danny's harsh words and James's devastating reaction to them kept replaying in my brain. When morning finally did come, Lydia and I decided to do another video-confessional. We figured that it would be best to get away from the boys for a few minutes or so, plus we needed to vent. \"So, we're all gonna die,\" I said, facing the camera. \"Why? Because Danny fucking drank all of our water and ate the rest of our food before he made his exit. As if that wasn't bad enough, he also did something else…\" Lydia slowly looked up at the camera; her eyes were still bloodshot from crying non-stop, much like mine were. She'd always been so confident and carefree, but after Danny had told Jay what she did with Dave, it was like a completely different person. Never in a million years did I expect to see her so... destroyed. \"H-He… He fucking told Jay my secret,\" she croaked out. \"A-About two years ago, I went to Danny's party and made a huge mistake... I-I got drunk and slept with Dave, James's brother. I-I never told… anyone about it…. Dave and Danny were the only ones who knew… And I feel so fucking stupid for thinking that McDouchebag was gonna keep quiet about it… T-To this day, I still regret it, because…. B-Because, for six years now, I've been in love with Jay… And Jay, if you do end up watching this… Now you know, and if you end up hating me forever, I-I'll understand…. I just wanted you to know I really feel about you…\" She clasped a hand over her mouth and started to sob again. I looked at the camera, tears already begging to flow down my face. \"I-I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but… I hate Danny… I hate him so fucking much… James tried to tell me that he was nothing but trouble, but I wouldn't listen… I really thought he was my friend, but I was wrong… Because friends don't tell your husband-to-be that you aborted their child last year…. Yeah, Danny is that cold… You see, James had mentioned many times that he wanted kids someday, but I, on the other hand, wasn't ready for them. So, w-when I found out that I was pregnant; I didn't know what to do. I-I knew that I wasn't ready to be a mother, and t-that was when I had to make a choice: keep it or get rid of it. You can already guess which route I took… It was one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make, a-and I could hardly live with myself when it was all over... I'm so sorry James… Y-You… You deserve better…\" Lydia wrapped her arms around me as tight as she could as we both continued to sob harder. I didn't know if I could do this any longer. I didn't want to give up, but I don't think I could take another minute of James looking at me with such sheer devastation and hate. We all stood around the small white table, and Seth brought out the same box of matches that we'd used before. \"I think we all remember how this works,\" Seth said, lighting one of the matches and swiftly shaking it out. \"Whoever gets the burnt match has to go to one of Franco's neighbors houses, get us some food and some water.\" \"No-ho-ho!\" Craig shook his head. \"No, I'm not going first!\" \"I'll go first,\" James spoke up, raising his arms dramatically. \"Thank you,\" Seth said, holding the matches out to him. \"Very mature of you. Thank you.\" James kept his eyes closed as he took the match. He was safe; the tip was red. He punched the air and yelled, \"Yes!\" Then he quickly calmed down and muttered, \"Sorry.\" Seth patted him on the shoulder and said, \"Good job.\" He looked over at Jonah, who looked awful. His skin was deathly pale and he appeared to be very out of it. \"You okay Jonah?\" \"What's that?\" Jonah mumbled. \"You okay?\" Seth repeated. \"Yeah,\" Jonah said monotonically. \"Just bad sleep. Crazy dream.\" \"Here, Jonah.\" Seth held the matches out to him, and Jonah took one from the pile. His was red as well and he quickly dropped it down on the table. \"Anastasia,\" Seth said, handing me the pile. I reached out and took one of the matches and turned it around to look at the tip. It was red. \"Hallelujah,\" I breathed, although I wasn't entirely sure if I should feel guilty or thankful. \"Lydia.\" Seth turned to her and heled out the matches. With a sigh, she leaned forward and plucked one out. Hers was red too. Seth, Jay, and Craig shifted uncomfortably, with Craig yelling, \"Shit!\" Now it was down to all three of them, and one of them was going outside. \"Craigers, you feeling lucky?\" Seth asked, passing the matches to him. \"Will history repeat itself?\" Not this time, because Craig's match was red. It was down to Jay and Seth. James patted Seth on the back and said, \"You got this, dawg.\" Lydia rolled her eyes and patted Jay on the shoulder and said, \"You've got this, don't worry.\" Even after all the harsh things he said to her, Lydia was still willing to make things right with Jay. Seth held out the final two matches to Jay, who closed his eyes as he reached for one. His eyes shot open as he pulled out the match of his choice. Jay's match was red also. \"Seth, no! Not you!\" James wailed, throwing his match down in frustration. Craig, Lydia, Jonah, Jay, and I, on the other hand, stayed quiet. We didn't want Seth to go out there either, but one of us had to do it. Seth sighed. \"I'm not going.\" \"What?!\" Lydia and Jay spat in unison. \"Are you fucking kidding me right now?!\" I fumed. \"I'm not going!\" Seth insisted. \"I'm bowing out. I'm declining to go!\" \"What?\" Jay repeated. \"Er, let me break it down for you,\" Seth retorted. \"I'm not fucking going!\" \"You are definitely going!\" Jay asserted. He looked at us. \"Tell him he's fucking going!\" \"Tell you what,\" Seth snapped. \"Why don't you fucking go, Mr. Self-Righteous? You're constantly saying what assholes we are and how good you are. You go get us some fucking water!\" \"Oh, fuck you, Seth!\" Lydia said acidly. \"You're nothing but a spineless pussy!\" \"No, no, it's okay, Lydia,\" Jay said. He snapped his match in half and looked at Seth. \"I will go, because I have something called honor.\" \"That's good. Yeah, you're very honorable,\" Seth muttered sarcastically. \"That was really uncalled for, Seth,\" Lydia snapped, narrowing her eyes at him. \"Oh, like you're any better, Lydia!\" James said harshly. \"You fucked my brother and probably a bunch of other guys in Hollywood! You've been boarded more times than the Amtrak!\" A loud, sharp SNAP echoed throughout the house, causing all of us to gasp at what just happened. Lydia shook her hand a few times and glared at James, her eyes now watering at his cruel words. \"You know what, Franco ,\" she snarled. \"There's something I've been meaning to tell you for a long time now and I think it's about fucking time you heard it: I sincerely hope you rot in hell.\" \"Right back at ya, Lydia ,\" he replied coolly, clutching his cheek. He looked at me for support, but I turned away from him. I wasn't siding with him this time because what he just said was really low. Craig cleared his throat. \"I'll go with you, Jay.\" \"Really?\" Jay asked, sounding touched. \"Is this because of our pact upstairs?\" \"Nah,\" Craig shook his head. \"Cause you got them skinny-ass arms. You couldn't carry enough to feed a hamster.\" \"I'll go too,\" Lydia declared. \"You guys are gonna need all the help you can get.\" \"I doubt they need that kind of help,\" James muttered under his breath. Lydia flipped him off with both hands and then turned to Jay and Craig. \"Okay, let's grab some garbage bags to put the food and water in and some weapons.\" Once they had everything they needed, they stood in front of the doors and James told them where the nearest house was. I hurried over to them and gave them each a big hug. \"Be careful out there, okay? Promise me that no matter what, you'll all come back in one piece.\" Craig nodded. \"Don't worry, we've got this.\" \"I promise we won't die,\" Jay said. \"Now, let's get that money.\" \"Let's do it,\" Lydia agreed. Jay leaned forward and pushed the door open, smoke immediately flowing into the house. \"Out and to the left,\" James told them. All three of them nodded in response and walked out the door, which James quickly shut behind them. Blowing out a sigh, I went over to one of the sofas and sat down. James and Seth had gone upstairs. Jonah, on the other hand, well… To say that he still wasn't all the way there would be a complete understatement. He was pacing around the house, all pale and sweaty and not saying a word. This was really starting to freak me out. I wouldn't tell if he was just getting sick or if he was in some kind of trance. \"Jonah, you okay?\" I asked, snapping my fingers a few times to get his attention. \"What's wrong? Are you sick or something?\" He didn't answer me. What he did next, though, nearly gave me a heart-attack. Jonah collapsed, hitting the floor with a loud thud. \"JONAH!\" I screamed, rising from the couch and running over to him. Kneeling down beside him, I checked to see if he was still breathing… He was, but just barely. \"FUCK!\" I screamed, looking up at the stairs. \"JAMES! SETH! HELP! JONAH'S ON THE VERGE OF DEATH!\" It only took about ten seconds for both of them to come stampeding down the stairs. \"Oh, fuck!\" Seth yelled. \"Is he okay?!\" James demanded. \"Clearly, he's not!\" I shrieked, breathing heavily. \"He just… He just collapsed out of the blue!\" \"Dude! Jonah!\" Seth, yelled, clapping his hands in front of Jonah's face. \"What the fuck?! What do we do?! Do either of you know First-Aid or anything?!\" James shook his head. \"No! I-I suck at First-Aid!\" \"I think he's got low blood sugar!\" I yelled helplessly. \"Shit!\" Seth exclaimed. \"He's having an LBS episode! Go get the Milky Way!\" \"I'll get the Milky Way!\" James announced, immediately making a beeline for the kitchen. \"Come on, Jonah!\" I hollered. \"Hang in there, dammit!\" \"I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it! Open his mouth!\" James ran back into the living room, gripping the Milky Way in his hand. \"Open his mouth! Open his mouth! Open his mouth! I'll get this in there!\" Leaning forward, I grabbed Jonah's chin and yanked his mouth open. \"Wake up, Jonah! Please, wake up!\" James pressed the Milky Way against Jonah's lips, but Jonah wasn't eating it. \"Jonah. Milky Way, Jonah!\" \"It's not fucking working, man!\" Seth yelled. \"What the fuck?!\" \"How do we get it in there?!\" James pressed. \"Chew it up and spit in his mouth like a baby bird!\" Seth suggested. James took a bite and leaned over so he was positioned over Jonah's mouth. To our astonishment, he wound up swallowing a few seconds later. \"You just swallowed it, man!\" Seth shouted in disbelief. \"It's so good!\" James shot back. \"Give me a bite!\" Seth barked, grabbing it from James and taking a bite. \"Mmm! The second it hits your mouth is, like, amazing!\" \"Oh, for Christ's sake!\" I scowled, yanking it out of his hand. \"I'll do it!\" I leaned down again so my mouth was just a couple inches away from Jonah's. Seth and James held his mouth open while I allowed some Milky Way saliva to drool out of my mouth. Before I could get the spit into his mouth however, his head shot up and he began to recite a language I'd never even heard of before. His voice was different as well, it sounded very robotic and inhuman. We all screamed in fear and jumped back. Jonah started convulsing on the floor, not letting up on muttering said unknown language. \"What's that?!\" Seth murmured. \"That's Hebrew!\" James said. \"I'm pretty sure it's Latin not Hebrew!\" I said. \"I would know; I took a few classes back in college!\" \"Yeah, I went to Hebrew school for six years!\" Seth yelled. \"That's not Hebrew!\" Jonah's head suddenly snapped up, his eyes shooting open to reveal bright green irises. \"You will drown in a river of blood,\" he growled. \"The End of Days is here! You will quiver in the shadow of Kingdom Come! Judgment Day is upon you! The apocalypse is nigh!\" His head sunk down and his eyes closed. \"Holy.. .fuck….\" I murmured, looking at the boys. All three of us had nothing but pure fear and shock written all over our faces. Something brown and slimy began to ooze out of Jonah's mouth. James, Seth, and I stood around him, completely unsure of what to do at this point to save him. \"What is that ?\" Seth cringed. \"Is that bile?\" James ran his finger across Jonah's cheek, swatching some of the mysterious gunk onto his fingertip. \"I don't know,\" James answered, inspecting it. \"It's cold.\" \"Sniff it,\" Seth said. \"No!\" James shook his head and held his finger out to Seth. \"You sniff it!\" Seth leaned forward and smelled it, nearly puking after doing so. \"It smells like puke!\" \"Ew!\" James started to wipe it on Seth's shirt. Out of nowhere, Jonah sat up again and sprayed all three of us in a shower of dark green vomit. Despite our attempts to shield ourselves to avoid getting it all over us, we ended up drenched head to toe in the stuff. When Jonah was finally done, I did not hesitate in trying to get it out of my eyes and mouth. \"WHAT THE FUCK?!\" I screeched, rubbing my eyes and spitting out some of the remains. \"It's in my eyes!\" James yelled, his hands flying up to wipe his face. \"This is so fucked up!\" I screamed. \"You guys!\" Seth yelled, cutting off our protests. \"He's gone!\" \"Where is he?!\" I demanded, looking around. \"He's fucking gone!\" Seth wailed. \"Of course, it all makes sense now!\" I hollered, still looking around for Jonah. \"Pale skin, different voice, bright green eyes, speaking in tongues…. Jonah's fucking possessed!\" \"Bullshit!\" James yelled. \"I think you've just seen one too many horror movies!\" \"James, this isn't the time for your pretentious comebacks!\" I shot back. James ignored me and began to shout Jonah's name repeatedly. Seth and I did the same and looked around for him. Where the hell did he go?! \"Jonah, stop this!\" Seth yelled. \"Please!\" \"Jonah, where the fuck are you?!\" James shouted. \"Jonah, get your crazy ass out here!\" I hollered. Before I knew it, Jonah appeared out of nowhere, grabbed James by his shoulders and threw him against the sofas. Jonah jumped on him and began to gnaw on his face. \"Jonah, please stop!\" I cried. \"You need to snap out of it! This isn't you!\" \"Bad Jonah!\" Seth lectured. \"Stop eating him!\" Jonah looked over his shoulder and hissed at Seth. Suddenly, he got to his feet and lunged at Seth. \"Watch out!\" James yelled. \"He's super strong!\" But his warnings were too late and Jonah shoved Seth with so much force that he was sent sliding across the floor and almost fell down the hole to the basement. As much as I wanted to help him, I was currently in the middle of trying to haul James to his feet without falling over (due to us both being covered in vomit and all). However, as soon as we walked onto the hardwood floor, he slipped and dragged me down with him. \"Fuck, are you alright?!\" James asked, as I rolled onto my back. \"Never better!\" I nodded, both of us holding on to each other as we scrambled to our feet. Seth was trying to get Jonah off of him, and at one point Jonah threatened to titty-fuck Seth and asked if his man-titties were big Bs or small Cs. Great, as if Seth's agoraphobia wasn't severe enough already. Seth retaliated quickly and punched Jonah off him, causing him to land flat on his back. \"I'll get you something to help!\" James yelled, while I ran into the kitchen to look for any weapons to hold off Jonah. I spotted a broom in the corner and grabbed it. By the time I returned, James had tosses a stool to Seth, but Seth didn't react quick enough and was hit with said stool. Jonah got to his feet and ran towards Seth. \"Leave him alone, you motherfucker!\" I yelled, hitting the back of Jonah's head and back repeatedly with the metal side of the broom. Jonah whipped around and his arm struck my chest, sending me flying backwards. My head slammed against the wall and instant pain shot through my body. Just when I thought that Jonah was gonna finish me off, James ran over and helped me to my feet. The room was still spinning and I could barely walk, so he wrapped a supporting arm around my shoulders as we ran upstairs. Apparently, Jonah had also thrown Seth through the second floor railings and now he was groaning in pain on the floor. Thankfully, he managed to get to his feet as Jonah suddenly let out a roar downstairs. \"Fuck!\" I screamed. \"We've gotta hide!\" We ran into James and I'd bedroom and looked around for a decent hiding spot. \"We gotta hide! He's coming! He's coming!\" James wailed. \"We know he's coming!\" Seth said. \"I don't know what the fuck to do!\" \"Let's hide in here!\" I said, pointing to the closet. They both nodded, and we ended up standing behind all James and I's clothes. Since I had heels on, I had to bend my knees in order to fully hide behind the clothes. Jonah walked into the room and started looking around for us. I just prayed he wouldn't check the closet… \"Please go away,\" Seth whimpered. \"He's sniffing,\" James said. I was silent for about four or five seconds, and then Seth started to breathe as loud as he could through his mouth. \"You're breathing really loud!\" James hissed. \"Am I?\" Seth replied. \"Shut the fuck up, Seth!\" I hissed. \"Don't breathe through your mouth!\" James told him. \"Okay.\" Seth closed his mouth, only to start breathing through his nose. \"Dammit, Seth!\" I growled. \"I'm sorry!\" he said. \"I don't know where else to breathe from!\" He started switching back and forth between breathing through his mouth and nose. That's when Jonah turned his attention towards the closet. SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! SHIT SHIT! We're dead. We're beyond dead. We tried to hide ourselves with the clothes as Jonah moved closer, but it was useless. Jonah reached for the door handle, and Seth immediately charged forward with a scream and shoved Jonah to the floor. I kicked Jonah in the stomach and head a few times for good measure before turning around and sprinting after the boys. We were so anxious to get down the stairs that we ended up tripping and tumbling down them. We landed in a pile at the bottom of the stairs, groaning in pain and struggling to get up. \"You guys okay?!\" James asked us as we sat up. \"Yeah, I'm fine!\" I nodded, clambering to my feet. \"We need to get the fuck out of here and find Jay, Craig, and Lydia!\" \"Let's go!\" James said, helping Seth up as well who kept saying, \"Okay!\" Before we could open the front doors however, they were suddenly yanked open to reveal a screaming and panicked Craig, Jay, and Lydia. \"What the fuck?!\" Seth yelled. \"What are you doing?!\" \"There's a fucking demon chasing us!\" Craig shouted \"And it nearly ripped us to shreds!\" Lydia shrieked. \" A demon?!\" James, Seth, and I exclaimed in unison. We were officially in Hell now. All these demons roaming the Earth were living proof of it. \"What the fuck happened to you guys?!\" Jay questioned, looking us over. \"That!\" Seth said, pointing to something to the side of us. We turned and saw Jonah wobbling towards us, ready to attack. \"It's Jonah!\" James shouted. \"He's-He's possessed!\" Jay stepped forward and swung the bat he was still wielding, hitting Jonah square in the face with it. \"Oh, fuck!\" Seth yelled. \"You brained him!\" \"Is that… I was supposed to do that, right?\" Jay asked uncertainly. A couple seconds later, Jonah hissed at us again and Jay hit him in the nose again, knocking him unconscious for good this time. \"Motherfucker!\" Jay snapped. A/N: Uh oh, as if things weren't complicated enough already, now they've gotta deal with Demon Jonah. On that note, I hope you guys liked this chapter! Now, I know I said before that I wasn't going to abandon this story and I really don't want to, but unfortunately I won't be able to update for another four to five weeks or so. The reason why I won't be able to is because I'll be studying to test out of Intermediate Algebra (since I sadly had a very bad teacher last semester and ended up failing the class) and I need to pass this test so I can take Pre-Calculus next semester. I have two colleges in mind that I'm considering transferring to but they require transfer students to have a math level of Intermediate Algebra or higher and if I don't test out of Intermediate Algebra and take (and pass) Pre-Calculus, then I won't be able to transfer to either of them, and obviously, I don't want that to happen. Again, I'm sorry for the delay but I really need to focus on this right now. Wish me luck and I'll see you all soon! ^_^[Chapter 12] A/N: I'm baaaaacccccckkkk! ^_^ So, the good news is: I passed my test! You guys have no idea how happy I am that I passed it. I'm also on winter break now so hopefully I'll be able to update on a weekly basis again. I really want to thank you all for being so supportive while I was M.I.A for the past couple months. I also want to let you guys know that I've made a few music videos for this fic and the link to them is on my profile. Feel free to check them out and leave some comments letting me know what you think. :D I've also featured LittleGee's OC, Mackenzie Bolton, from her fic 'To Hell With It' in a couple of them. You guys should also check out her trailers (the link to them is on her profile) as well. They're amazing! Oh, and one more thing I want to tell you guys is that I will be switching POVs between Lydia and Anastasia a couple times in this chapter. You'll see why when you read it. MysticGohan88 – Thanks! Well, I won't give too much away, but I can promise you that James and Anastasia will not have a sad ending. Once James, Seth, and I changed out of our vomit covered clothes (James loaned Seth a gray sweat suit and I changed into a black camisole, a black leather jacket, black slashed pants, and black ankle boots). Then we dragged Jonah's unconscious body upstairs, and, using a few of James's belts and my scarves, we tried him to the bed. However, when Jonah stated to wake up, we were all quick to get the hell out of there. We all ended up hiding in James's library, trying to figure out a logical explanation to Jonah's possession, even though Jay, Lydia and I already knew the answer. \"This shit's cray-cray, guys,\" Seth whispered. \"I mean… it's like the apocalypse. It's like the book of Revelations. Like, that means there's a God, right? I haven't led my life as though there's a God this whole time, who fuckin' saw that coming? That there's actually a God?\" \"I'd say… ninety-five percent of the planet,\" Jay said. \"This really isn't the time to be a wiseass, Jay,\" I mumbled, running a hand through my hair. \"Jesus fucking Christ,\" Seth sighed. \"You might want to stay away from saying that,\" Craig advised. \"Jesus fucking Christ?\" he repeated. \"Why?\" The rest of us scolded him for repeated it, and Jay and Lydia both made cross signs over their chests. \"Because you're not supposed to take the Lord's name in vain,\" I replied. \"It's one of the Ten Commandments.\" \"Jesus isn't the name of the Lord,\" Seth argued. \"God is the name of the lord.\" \"There isn't much of a difference,\" Lydia piped up. \"I come from a Catholic family, so I know more about this than you think.\" \"Jesus and God. It's all the same,\" Craig affirmed. \"It's a trinity,\" Jay added. \"The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost\" Craig concluded. \"It's like Neapolitan ice cream,\" James added. \"I don't even know what the fucking Commandments are,\" Seth said. \"Guys, I think this is sort of bullshit,\" James said. \"Because we're all good people. I can look each one of you in the eye, I know you're good. Well, maybe not all of you….\" He turned his head and looked at me, and I hung my head in shame. I didn't know how much longer I could put up with James guilt-tripping me for what I did, but, at the same time, a small part of me knew that I deserved this. I don't think James was ever going to let go of the fact that I got rid of our unborn child. \"I'm good,\" Seth said. \"We're actors,\" James continued. \"We bring joy to people's lives!\" \"Yeah, but we don't do it for free,\" Jay pointed out. \"We get paid handsomely; much higher than the average profession.\" \"It's not like it was just handed to any of us,\" James argued. \"We worked really hard to get here.\" \"Yeah, pretend like it's hot when it's cold,\" Craig said. \"You sitting on a bench, it's freezing, you in your drawers, talking about something, everybody's surfing.\" \"I think God may have just fucked up,\" Seth said quietly. \"Made a mistake and left us behind by accident. I mean, he's got a lot of shit on his plate.\" \"That's bullshit and you know it, Seth,\" I said coolly, shaking my head at his words. \"They're right,\" Craig said. \"It's not an oversight. It's not a mistake, okay? We gotta face facts. We're here, and there's a reason we're all here.\" \"Why are you so sure?\" James inquired. \"I… I've done some things, man,\" Craig replied gravely. \"I…I gouged a man's eyeballs out.\" \"What the fuck?!\" Lydia yelled. \"My thoughts exactly!\" I exclaimed. \"What the-\"Jay said. \"Fuck off!\" Seth said in disbelief. \"Craig!\" James berated him. \"I was a kid, man,\" Craig clarified. \"It was a fucking bar fight. It was a bad foosball fight. He said I didn't call spinneys, and I fucking called spinneys. He got all in my face and I smashed a bottle across his face. The first eyeball was an accident, but then I was like, fuck it, and I went for the second one. It was fucked up, but you know what? That shit happens. I'm saying, that's… I think that's why I'm here.\" \"I gotta admit something…..\" James spoke up. \"I um…. I fucked Lindsay Lohan!\" \"WHAT?!\" I thundered, my eyes widening. \"When the fuck was this?!\" \"It was back in 2009, before we started dating,\" James replied. \"She was fucked up, she was high! It was at the Chateau Marmont and she kept banging on my door. She kept calling me Jake Gyllenhaal.\" Lydia looked like she was going to throw up. \"Please, for the love of all that is holy, don't say another fucking word, Franco! I don't want to hear about how you banged crackhead Lohan!\" Even Seth cringed at James's confession. \"That's fucked up.\" \"Yeah… I said 'call me the Prince of Persia.'\" \"Well, seeing as Danny already told everyone Lydia and I's secrets, we've got nothing else to admit,\" I said quietly. \"See, that's what I'm saying, man,\" Craig said. \"We've all done bad shit, you know? We've done more bad shit than good in our lives, and… It's time to pay the piper.\" All of a sudden, the lights shut off completely. Immediately, we all yelled out, \"oh shit!\" \"Are you fucking serious right now?!\" Lydia shouted. \"This really isn't the time for a power outage!\" \"God did this,\" James murmured, flicking and holding up his lighter. \"He gave us light, and then he took it away. \"You hear that?\" Jay asked, referring to Jonah's inhuman roaring and cackling upstairs. \"Damn, I wish there was something we could do to help him,\" Craig said sadly. Jay and Lydia looked at each other, and it was clear that they both had the same idea in mind. \"I know what we can do,\" they whispered in unison. ~Insert very dramatic (and spine-tingling) organ music here~ THE EXORCISM OF JONAH HILL Luckily for us, Lydia had seen more horror movies that dealt with possession and exorcisms than I could count. Jay, on the other hand, only had one line memorized from The Exorcist, and that was 'the power of Christ compels you.' Jay grabbed the bible and Lydia lit some candles and threw one of my old cross necklaces around her neck. James and I tied together a spatula and some tongs with one of our satin napkins. Although, I was pretty sure I had some old crosses lying around in a box in our hallway closet somewhere (they were a gift from my somewhat paranoid dad, don't judge me), so I told Jay, Lydia, Seth, James, and Craig to go ahead and start the Exorcism and that I'd join them shortly. Flinging open the closet door, I reached up and grabbed a medium-sized box that sat on the shelf and set it on the floor. A sudden blow to the back of my head caused me to immediately black out. The last thing I remembered was falling backwards right into a pair of muscular arms… \"Wakey, wakey, sweetheart,\" an all too familiar Sothern accent murmured in my ear. My eyes shot open and I groaned upon feeling the sudden pain in the back of my head. I quickly looked around to see where I was exactly…. and to say that I was in hell would be a complete understatement. Not only was I tied to a chair, but I was also in what appeared to be an old, dirty RV. It was practically dark in here, there was broken glass everywhere, and, to my utter terror, bones and bits human flesh were lying around. The fact that a few of Danny's friends were currently chowing down on someone right in front of me was irrevocably deranged and petrifying. With a scream, I started jerking back and forth in my chair, anxiously trying to pull my wrists out of their restraints. But, considering my wrists and legs were bound with barbed wire, constantly thrashing only caused the blades to vigorously cut into my skin. \"I wouldn't do that if I were you, Anastasia,\" Danny said tauntingly, trailing his finger down my cheek. \"You see, the more you try to get free, the more pain you feel. So, I suggest you stay fucking still unless you want to inadvertently slit your wrists…\" \"Where there fuck am I, Danny?!\" I screamed, wrenching my face away from his touch. \"WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?! HELP! SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP ME! HEL-\" My cries for help are instantly cut off when Danny suddenly backhands me across the face. The force of it is enough to split my bottom lip open and make my cheek start throbbing. \"Shut the fuck up!\" Danny yelled. He grabbed a fistful of my hair and snapped my head back so I was forced to look him directly in the eye. \"No one can hear you and no one's going to save you, so be fucking quiet so I can get down to business,\" he snarled \"You b-bastard,\" I spluttered, breathing heavily as I glared at him. \"You goddamn coward! You're sick! You're fucking sick!\" My insults earned me another hit, this time it's a blow right to my jaw. Blood gushed out of my mouth as I screamed in agony. Danny doesn't stop there though. More blows are delivered to my face and my stomach. The only person that would help me block all of this sheer agony out was James…. I had to think about him and no one else… Thinking about him would at least give me some serenity….. But I think it was safe to say that any sanity I had left was gone now. Lydia's POV Jonah was lying on the bed, thrashing and writing in anger as Jay and I slowly walked over to him. \"Jonah Hill?\" Jay called. The demon inside Jonah continued to thrash and roar. \"Jonah?\" Jonah laughed. \"Jonah Hill?\" \"Jonah Hill is no more,\" the demon sneered at Jay. \"…. Demon?\" \"Yes?\" \"Fuck!\" Seth gulped. \"That's not good! That's not good!\" \"Jay, you fool,\" the demon growled, and I looked down at my cross necklace. I took it off and clutched it tightly in my hand. \"I say onto thee, the power of Christ compels you!\" \"Oh, does it?\" the demon mocked. \"Does it compel me?\" \"The power of Christ compels you!\" \"Does it, Jay?\" \"The power of Christ compels you!\" \"Is the power of Christ compelling me? Is that what's happening?\" \"The power of Christ compels you!\" Jay tried again. \"Guess what?\" the demon smirked. \"It's not that compelling.\" \"Alright, that's it!\" I spat, pushing Jay out of the way and standing on the bed stool. \"I cast you out, unclean spirit, along with every Satanic power of the enemy, every spectre from hell, and all your fell companions; in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ!\" I screamed, holding the cross out in front of me. \"Be gone and stay far from this creature of God! For it is He who commands you, he who flung you headlong from the heights of heaven into the depths of hell!\" \"Oh, so you want to talk about depths, Lydia?\" the demon mocked. \"Just like Dave Franco plunged himself into your depths?\" I tightened my grip on the cross and swallowed thickly. The demon was trying to get inside my head, but I couldn't allow myself to hesitate or falter. If I did, we were all fucked. \"Are you two serious right now?!\" Seth intervened. \"That's your fucking plan?! You're gonna repeat lines from The Exorcist ?!\" \"I would assume they did their fucking research!\" Jay retorted. Seth rolled his eyes. \"It's a movie!\" \"Put a fucking sock in it, Rogen, okay?!\" I snapped. \"We've got this under control! And FYI, watching Supernatural comes in handy too!\" I turned to the demon again and narrowed my eyes. \"It is He who commands you, He who once stilled the sea and the wind and the storm! Hearken, therefore, and tremble in fear, Satan, you enemy of the faith, you foe of the human race, you begetter of death, you robber of life, you corrupter of justice, you root of all evil and vice; seducer of men, betrayer of the nations, instigator of envy, font of avarice, fomenter of discord, author of pain and sorrow!\" \"Ah! It hurts a little bit!\" the demon shirked, clawing at the headboard. \"It's like, this little sting!\" Yes! Yes! Yes! I couldn't believe it, I was defeating the demon! \"Why, then, do you stand and resist, knowing as you must that Christ the Lord brings your plans to nothing?! Fear Him, who in Isaac was offered in sacrifice, in Joseph sold into bondage, slain as the paschal lamb, crucified as man, yet triumphed over the powers of hell!\" I cried. \"Fuck off, Lydia!\" the demon yelled at me, still cringing in pain. At this point, Jay stepped up and stood next to me. \"The power of Christ compels you!\" \"Be gone, then, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit!\" I shouted, pointing the cross just inches away from Jonah's face. \"Give place to the Holy Spirit by this sign of the holy cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with the Father and the Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever!\" \"The power of Christ compels you!\" Jay chanted again. \"The power of Christ compels you!\" The demon screamed again and the bed started to rise up and shake. \"Jay?\" James yelled nervously, but Jay continued to chant. \"The power of Christ compels you!\" And cue the bed shaking even more vigorously. \"Holy shit!\" Seth shouted. \"Jay, stop!\" I screeched, putting my hand on his shoulder. \"It's useless! We're just pissing him off even more!\" \"Just stop it!\" Seth yelled. \"THE POWER OF CHRIST COMPELS YOU!\" Jay repeated. The flames from the candles started flickering out of control, the bed continued to shake violently, we kept screaming at Jay to stop (and so was the demon), and Jay ignored our pleas and continued to chant. \"Get the fuck down!\" Seth barked, grabbing hold of Jay's waist and yanking him off the bed. Jay quickly grabbed hold of my arm and pulled me down with him, resulting in both of us falling over. \"What fuck?!\" Jay exclaimed, getting to his feet and harshly shoving Seth. \"Don't fucking push me, asshole!\" \"Fuck you!\" Seth snapped. \"Fuck you!\" Jay yelled at Seth. \"You're the fucking asshole, you liar!\" Seth spat. \"Still?!\" Jay said, exasperated. \"Yes, still !\" \"Um, hello?!\" I intervened, stepping in-between them. \"We're dealing with a possessed Jonah here! Now's not the time to argue!\" \"Let em' fight,\" the demon interrupted, sounding very amused. \"We have an exorcism to finish!\" Craig pointed out. \"Hello?\" \"Do you wanna know why I didn't stay with you?\" Jay asked, shooting Seth a death glare. \"Yeah, I do,\" Seth said heatedly. \"You fucking changed. You're a fucking… sell-out.\" \"Jay, stop!\" I barked, putting my hand on his chest. \"You did fucking sell out,\" the demon piped up. \"Everyone says.\" \"At least I did change!\" Seth shot back. \"You act like you're fucking eighteen years old still, Jay!\" \"Grow up, Jay!\" the demon lectured. \"That's why he's yelling at you!\" \"You've been holding me back this whole time!\" Seth reached past me and suddenly shoved Jay. Jay wasn't backing down either, and within seconds, they were throwing punches at each other. James, Craig, and I yelled for them to stop and they fell into one of James's cupboards and collapsed on the floor, knocking the door off one of them. \"Everyone, fucking break apart!\" James ordered as Seth and Jay continued to fight wrestle. \"Knock it off you guys!\" I barked, seizing Jay's shoulders and trying to pull him away from Seth. \"STOP IT!\" \"Yo! What the fuck is all this Franco?!\"Craig exclaimed, looking at one of the broken cupboards. Right there in the cupboard were some chocolate bars, a can of spray cheese, a few bags of chips, and a can of beans….. ARE YOU SHITTING ME?! \"It looks like food!\" James cried out, feigning surprise. \"How'd that get there?!\" \"Have you been keeping food from us this whole time, asshole?!\" I yelled. \"What?!\" Seth spoke up. \"You have more food?!\" \"You knew he had extra food?!\" Craig thundered. \"Er… he gave Anastasia and I each one cracker!\" Seth tried to defend himself. \"That still doesn't make it any better!\" I exploded. \"You knew he had more food and didn't fucking tell us!\" \"I would've sucked his dick for half a cracker!\" Craig yelled. \"Alright, well maybe I didn't want you to suck my dick, alright?!\" James shot back. Suddenly, a loud roaring sound came from James's bedroom. I quickly turned around to see that the bedroom was now on of fire. \"Guys, guys!\" I screamed at James at Craig as they continued to argue. \"THE FUCKING BEDROOM'S ON FIRE!\" We all ran into the bedroom, and James tried to blow out the flames, which only caused them to spread across the bed. The entire bed was now engulfed in flames. \"Put it out!\" the demon yelled. \"Use your mouth! Put it out!\" \"We've gotta fucking smother it!\" I yelled picking up one of James's blankets. Craig did the same with a fake fur blanket and we both threw them on the demon. To our dismay, those caught on fire too…. along with the demon. The demon let out a roar, tearing its restraints off and running into the wall. We all screamed and ran out of the room and the demon was in hot pursuit, and setting the whole house on fire. I was sprinting as fast as I could, but considering I was wearing five-inch heeled boots, it was damn near impossible. We quickly moved everything out of the way that was keeping the front doors. The demon was crawling towards us now, roaring in pain. Finally, we managed to get the doors open and we tumbled out of them. We all turned around to see the demon get crushed to death by a flaming ceiling beam. And then it hits me…. \"ANASTASIA!\" James and I screamed at the same time. Before we could make a run for it and go back inside to save her, Jay grabbed me and held me back while Seth did the same with James. \"Are you two fucking crazy?!\" Seth yelled, trying to hold James in place. \"Look, maybe she got out, alright?! After all, you do have a back door to your house, maybe she was able to escape in time! We just need to find her!\" \"Right, right!\" James exclaimed, digging into his pocket and pulling out a set of car keys. \"My Prius!\" He pressed a button and I couldn't help but jump with joy once I heard the sound of the car unlocking. My celebration came to a stop when I looked up to see a huge, black winged demon land on top of the garage. It let out a roar and looked at us. … Shit. \"What is that?!\" James cried. \"It's a fucking demon!\" I screamed fearfully. \"No fucking way!\" Seth shouted. The demon roared again, and that's when we knew all hope was lost for us. \"I got this,\" Craig said. We all swiveled around and looked at him in disbelief. \"What?!\" Jay yelled. \"I'll distract the thing,\" Craig said. \"I'll run over there screaming and shit, that should give you enough time to get to the garage.\" \"Well yeah, but that thing can kill you!\" Seth pointed out. \"Maybe I deserve it, Craig replied. \"I've been shitty my whole life, being selfish, only doing shit for me. Maybe it's only right that the last thing I do on this planet, isn't for me. It's for you guys.\" \"Craig, you don't have to do that,\" Jay began, but Seth cut him off with, \"Thank you very much, Craig!\" \"What the hell, Seth?!\" I yelled, and at the same time Jay mumbled, \"You spineless…\" \"I love you guys,\" Craig told us, on the verge of tears. \"You're my best friends.\" \"You're a real mensch, Craig,\" James told him. \"See you on the other side,\" Craig said. I couldn't stop the tears from falling down my face as Craig ran towards the demon, screaming almost every swear word in the book while he did so. He frantically waved his arms and towel around to distract the demon. The demon's focus was now on Craig and we all took this opportunity to run towards the car. Jay and I climbed into the backseat while Seth took shotgun and James drove. \"What's he gonna do?!\" Seth whispered frantically. We all looked out the front window as Craig yelled out, \"TAKE YO PANTIES OFF!\" and suddenly ran towards the demon, spinning his towel around above his head. \"CRAIG! NO!\" I screamed as the demon flew towards Craig. Then, out of nowhere, a bright blue beam of light surged down on Craig, securing him inside the barrel of light. The demon screamed as the light hit it and took off into the night. \"It worked!\" Jay exclaimed. \"He did it,\" I murmured. \"He got raptured.\" \"What's happening?!\" James asked. \"Drive!\" Seth told James. \"Drive!\" James did as told while Craig was slowly lifted off the ground, just high enough for James to drive underneath him. Jay and I turned around to see Craig lifted up a couple more feet before shooting up into the sky, disappearing into the dark clouds. Anastasia's POV I wasn't a suicidal person, not in the least bit. But right now, I just wanted Danny to end my suffering and kill me. He'd already beaten me like a piñata and taken all of his anger out on me. What more did he want? My lips felt swollen, my clothes were now covered in blood, and I knew that there were bruises all over my face. Danny studied my face for a few seconds before bending over and picking something up off the floor. I began to shake and hyperventilate as he pressed a shard of glass against my cheek. \"Pretty…. Pretty… Pretty,\" he said, dragging and digging the tip of the shard across my skin and making me scream for the millionth time. He repeated this a few more times until he was satisfied. I looked down and whimpered when he was done. At this point, I wanted it all to be over. I was more than ready to give up, and I didn't care if I went to Heaven or Hell, I just didn't want to be here on Earth anymore. Danny would be doing me a favor if he slit my throat right now with that glass shard. \"Hey Danny, can I eat her tits when you're done with her?\" A voice inquired. I turned my head to see what sick bastard had asked that. It was none other than Channing-fucking-Tatum. \"Channing?!\" I screamed in disbelief. \"You're a cannibal now too?! Oh my God!\" \"And I'm Danny's bitch.\" he shrugged it off as if it wasn't a big deal. \"Come on Danny, at least let me get one bite! They look soo good! I really wanted to throw up after he said that, but I managed to keep the vomit down my throat as Danny laughed at Channing. \"No way, Channing. I've been calling dibs on those babies for the last six years now,\" Danny said maliciously. \"But maybe you can eat her legs when I'm done. Now, if you'll excuse me.\" This was it. I was really going to die. So, I shut my eyes and prepared for more pain, but it didn't come. Something (or someone) had slammed into Danny's RV. My head snapped forward and my chair fell over. Groaning, I raised my head to see a few of the cannibals immediately fling the door open and sprint out of Danny's RV to catch the culprits responsible. Danny got up and turned his head to look at a couple of his henchmen that were still in the RV. \"Alright, I'm gonna go fucking see who's next on the menu. Watch her and make sure she doesn't try to escape. If she does, chew a few of her fingers off.\" I closed my eyes and felt more waves of nausea wash over me. Silently, I began to pray as I heard the cannibals in the RV chuckling sadistically. God, if you're listening, please, I beg of you, please... Just let me die.[Chapter 13] A/N: *awkwardly waves* Hello all, so I realize that it's been about five or six months since I last updated, and believe me, there's a reason for that. I had a really busy and rough semester, and I had very little free time, but now I'm back! However, I also want you all to know that this is the final chapter, and I just want to thank you all so much for your support and feedback. Oh, and if you want to see what Lydia's bridesmaid dress looks like as well as Anastasia's wedding dress, they're already in my Polyvore collection and the link to that is on my profile. Also, for any wrestling fans out there, I have another story coming out soon and the trailer for it is on my profile. It's a WWE fic and the pairing is Seth Rollins/OC. I've also made a few tribute videos for the fic as well, all of which are on my channel, and the name of my channel is Starfire Tamaran. Oh, and if you can, please comment on them. It would really mean a lot to me. :D Kihlala Sisters – Thank you so much! Oh, and don't worry, you can rest assured that Lydia and Anastasia will both get their happy endings, one way or another XD – Thanks! ^_^ Morgan – Thanks! I guess you could say him taking Anastasia and torturing her showed how fucked up and gone he really is, plus a part of him wanted to get revenge on James in the worst way possible. NikkiFoxy86 – Will do! Let me know what you think! Anastasia – Thank you! I hope you enjoy this last chapter! XD After lying on the cold floor for about a minute or two, I felt my wrists and legs being untied by Danny's henchmen. Then, they both told hold of my arms and forced me to stand up. My heart began to kick into overdrive as they led me towards the open door of the RV. I could hear Danny talking to someone, but I had no idea who that someone was. I got my answer when the cannibals suddenly shoved me out of the RV… and right into Danny's arms. My eyes widened as I saw Lydia, Jay, Seth, and James. Craig and Jonah weren't there. All I could do was hope that Craig managed to get raptured somehow and that the exorcism managed to work on Jonah, but I wouldn't be surprised if either of them were dead by now, especially with Danny and his crew running around and eating everyone in their sight. James eyes widened when he saw me, and he immediately tried to run towards me, but Danny's cannibals tightened their grip on him and kept him in place. \"Oh my God, what have you done to her, Danny?!\" James yelled, still struggling in their grip. \"Let her go! Let her go NOW!\" Danny just laughed at James's demands as he moved a lock of hair away from my face and trailed a finger down the chin, and I have to hold down the urge to throw up as he did so. \"No can do, Franco,\" Danny retorted. \"Besides, the last girl I ate tasted like shit, but luckily for me, Anastasia's about to make up for that.\" Danny suddenly yanked my face towards his mouth and dragged his tongue across my cheek, which instantly caused me to cry out and shudder in revulsion. Raising my head, I looked over at James, who looked both disgusted and defeated, and mouthed, \"I love you\" to him. \"Danny!\" Seth suddenly spoke up. \"We're friends! You can't eat us!\" \"I'd love to catch up,\" Danny retorted. \"But we're fucking starving, so… LET'S EAT!\" Danny pulled down the sleeve of my jacket and scraped his teeth against my bare shoulder as his cannibals crowded around James, Jay, Seth, and Lydia, revving up their chainsaws and preparing to go in for the kill. \"Fuck you!\" James shouted, picking up a brick by his feet and hitting the nearest cannibal in the head with it. \"Run!\" he yelled at us, chucking the brick at Danny's head and forcing him to release me. \"Chew on this, fuckers!\" Lydia screamed, seizing hold of a pipe nearby and lunging at the cannibals. They were trying to create a distraction while Seth, Jay and I ran for it. \"James, don't do this! I can't lose you!\" I screamed, taking hold of his shoulders. He shook his head and quickly said, \"I have to! Now go! You have to get out of here, alright?! Stay with Seth and Jay and stay alive!\" \"James, no! You can't!\" I screamed, tears beginning to well up in my eyes again. \"I love you! I'm so sorry for not telling you! I'm sorry for everythin-\" I was abruptly cut off when James suddenly took my face in his hands and kissed me. It was very brief though, and when he pulled away, he whispered, \"I love you too. Stay safe.\" and gestured for Seth to come towards us. I couldn't hold back my sobs as I felt Seth drag me away from the scene. Turning my head, I saw Jay yelling at Lydia and trying to get her to come with us. \"Lydia, what are you saying?! Come on, we've gotta get out of here!\" Jay yelled urgently, taking hold of her shoulders. \"These guys are insane; you'll be dead in seconds!\" Shaking her head, Lydia leaned in and heatedly kissed Jay for five seconds or so. Then, she pulled away and whispered, \"I'll see you on the other side, Jay… Now, go! Go!\" Seth, Jay and I ran like hell away from the scene as James and Lydia fought off the cannibals with everything they had. \"Man, we should go back!\" Seth said as we stopped dead in our tracks. \"We should go back and help them!\" However, before we could do so, two blue beams of the Rapture descended onto James and Lydia. \"Holy shit!\" Jay yelled. \"It worked!\" Seth cried out in shock. Lydia was levitated about a meter off the ground for a couple seconds before she was suddenly shot upwards, disappearing right into the clouds. I felt my lips curl into a hopeful smile as I looked over at James, who was shouting something at Danny, but we weren't able to hear what it was since we were too far away. He raised both his hands and gave Danny the double finger before making an ejaculating gesture. The light suddenly vanished and James was dropped fright in front of the cannibals. Oh, dear God! NO! NO! NO! \"Oh, shit!\" Seth shouted. Danny began to saunter towards James with a sadistic grin on his face and crouched down in front of him. His cannibals slowly began to advance on him, licking their lips in anticipation. Danny suddenly pounced on James, sinking his teeth into his face. \"NO!\" I screamed, feeling my heart break into a million pieces as Danny and his cannibals swarmed James. \"JAMES! JAMES!\" \"Come on, we've gotta keep moving!\" Jay shouted, seizing me by the arm as three of Danny's cannibals sprinted towards us. Grudgingly, I slowly nodded and ran as fast as I could. Once we rounded the corner, we hid underneath some debris. We kept quiet until we didn't hear their voices anymore. As soon as they were gone though, I couldn't stop myself from breaking down. \"H-He's d-dead,\" I spluttered out, my breathing increasing. \"J-James i-is d-dead. H-He w-was s-so c-close t-to g-getting i-into h-heaven! W-Why d-did h-he h-have t-to d-do t-that?!\" \"I don't know why he had to flip off Danny!\" Seth said, putting his arms around me and shaking his head. \"He was in the clear!\" \"That was in the text book,\" Jay explained. \"I think it was Envy, or-'' \"Jay, just don't, okay?!\" I sobbed out. \"I don't want to hear about all of the sins James just committed! I just want him back!\" Jay sighed and quickly dropped the subject. \"Well, this is another fine mess we've found ourselves in,\" he muttered. Without warning, the ground shook, causing all of us to jolt upward in surprise. Scrambling out of our hiding spot, we slowly looked up to see none other than the devil himself. That's when I knew that we were officially fucked. \"Oh, you've got to be fucking shitting me!\" Jay yelled. \"Holy shit!\" Seth and I yelled at the same time. All three of us continued to panic as the devil slowly stalked towards us. Then, it crouched down and let out a roar as four heads protruded from its back. Jay suddenly turned to us and confessed, \"Listen to me, guys, I'm a fucking idiot! I-I put myself off! I'm self-righteous! I think I'm better than both of you! I was resistant to change! I should've grown with you two! I should've-I should've changed with you! We should've all changed together! I-I didn't like what I became, so I hated what you two became!\" \"J-Jay, I'm so sorry!\" I cried out, rapidly shaking my head. \"I-I should've been a better friend to you! I should've visited you more and I should've fought harder to keep our friendship alive, but instead, I just let it crumble!\" Turning to Seth, I continued, \"S-Seth, I know I don't say this enough, but I love you, man! You're the big brother I've always wanted! Don't ever forget that, okay?!\" Seth nodded. \"It's fine, you guys. It's fine.\" \"Seth, Anastasia, I love you both,\" Jay said, wrapping his arms around the two of us. \"If we die, we die together,\" I choked out, hugging them both with the little strength I had left. \"Fucking right!\" Seth said. A piercing scream left my lips as one of the devil's heads plummeted towards us, ready to devour all three of us whole. Just when I thought this was the end for all of us, two blue beams of light suddenly enveloped Jay and I, knocking the Devil fifteen feet away from us. I couldn't believe it, I was being Raptured! After all the things I'd said and done, I was being given a second chance! Looking over, I saw Seth trying to take Jay's hand…. He hadn't got raptured! NO! This wasn't right! We couldn't just leave him down here to die! \"Seth!\" I screamed, holding my hand out. \"Take my hand! I'm not gonna let you die down her-\" Before I could finish my sentence, my body suddenly skyrocketed upwards towards the clouds. Slowly, I sat up and opened my eyes and surveyed my surroundings. Everything around me was pure white. Blinking my eyes a few times, I looked down and noticed that my clothes and my boots were also white. All the blood stains and holes were gone. With a gasp, I quickly rolled up my sleeves and looked at my wrists to see if I had any scars from the barbed wire Danny had tied me up with… I didn't. They were completely scar-less as if I'd never been tortured in the first place. The next thing I noticed was that I was lying in what looked like the backseat of a car, and a very nice one at that. Who was driving it was definitely a female, but I couldn't see her face. \"It's about damn time you woke up, Massaro. I was starting to get lonely up here!\" Oh my God, I knew that sassy voice anywhere! I didn't think I was ever gonna see her again! \"Lydia?!\" I exclaimed, immediately lunging forward and wrapping my arms around her neck. \"You really made it after all! Thank God!\" She stopped the car and turned around so she could hug me properly. \"I missed you too, girl,\" she replied, winking at me. \"So, what do you think of my ride? Pretty hot, huh?\" \"Very,\" I said, nodding in agreement. \"Wait, where the fuck did you get a purple Camaro from?! And why's there a halo on your head?!\" \"I wished for it,\" she replied, shrugging as if it wasn't a big deal. \"And to answer your second question, it's because I'm an angel now. You've got a halo too.\" Reaching up, I gasped as my fingers came in contact with a somewhat warm, smooth metal. \"Holy shit,\" I whispered. \"Oh, and this isn't the only thing I wished for,\" Lydia added, snapping me out of my daze. As soon as those words left her mouth, a small gray tabby kitten suddenly leapt across the passenger's seat and into my lap, purring happily. \"Aww, she's so adorable!\" I exclaimed, scratching the kitten behind the ear. \"What's her name?\" \"Nova,\" Lydia said with a grin. \"You know me, I've always been a cat lover, but I never got around to getting one when I was on earth, so I decided to wish for one here in heaven.\" \"Um, Lydia, there's something you need to know,\" I said, quickly changing the subject. \"I-It's about James, Jay and Seth…\" \"W-What happened to Jay?\" Lydia suddenly took hold of my shoulders and looked me dead in the eye. \"P-Please tell me h-he made it…\" \"I-I d-don't k-know,\" I spluttered. \"Last time I saw him… H-He was getting raptured, b-but S-Seth didn't get Raptured s-so Jay tried to grab his hand to take him with… I-I tried to h-help S-Seth too, but I wasn't quick enough… M-My body had already started soaring upwards as soon as I reached out to take hold of his hand… T-That's not even the worst part though… J-James didn't get raptured after all because he'd mocked Danny, and um…. Danny ate him.\" \"That explains why I couldn't find him after I got raptured,\" she whispered, pulling me into a hug. \"Hun, I'm so sorry... I know that James and I didn't exactly get along, but believe me when I say that he deserved to be here with you…\" Before I could say anything else, I saw two figures jogging towards us. \"Looks like we've got company,\" I muttered, climbing out of the car to get a better look. Lydia followed suit and narrowed her eyes. \"Alright, who's there?! Show yourselves- JAY!\" she suddenly exclaimed as the mystery figures revealed themselves. It was Seth and Jay! They made it! And most importantly, Seth managed to get raptured! Lydia wrapped her arms around Jay's neck and kissed him. He was definitely caught off guard at first, but then he wrapped his arms around her waist and kissed her back. With a laugh, I walked over to Seth and pulled him into a hug. \"I'm so glad you're here, Seth. I don't think I would've been able to handle losing someone else that I love and care about.\" \"It's good to see you too, Anastasia,\" he replied with a smile, hugging me back. \"Now, uh, where are we supposed to go? Are there some gates nearby or something?\" Lydia pulled away from Jay at that point and looked at Seth. \"Hop in,\" she said, gesturing to her car. \"I'll take you where we're supposed to go.\" When we arrived at the gates, they automatically opened to reveal a smirking Craig. \"Welcome to Heaven, motherfuckers,\" he greeted us. \"Craig!\" Jay, Seth and I cried, practically leaping out of the car like a few lunatics. We all laughed and cheered as we formed a group hug. \"Are you guys angels?\" Jay asked, his eyes marveling at our halos. \"Yes sir,\" Craig replied. \"That's so cool, man!\" Seth exclaimed. \"Congratulations!\" \"Oh! Fellas!\" Craig pointed above Seth and Jay's heads and clicked his fingers, halos appearing above both their heads after he did so. Almost immediately, they started freaking out and gaping at each other's halos, even rubbing them together at one point. \"Dude, this is so… what do we do now?!\" Seth asked. \"Come this way,\" Craig said, stepping aside. Heaven was the complete opposite of what I expected it to be. Girls were dancing in white bikinis, people were smoking weed like chimneys, and there was loud music blaring. Basically, Heaven was one giant party. \"Whoa!\" Seth gasped, staring at Craig's joint. \"They got weed in heaven?!\" Craig smirked. \"You tell me.\" With a ping sound, a joint suddenly appeared in Seth's mouth, much to his delight. \"Holy shit, that's awesome!\" Seth exclaimed, pressing his joint against his halo and taking a drag. \"That's insane, man!\" \"No, no, no. That's Heaven,\" Craig stated. \"Anything you can think of is yours.\" \"Damn straight,\" Lydia said, picking up Nova and lightly petting her. \"Anything, huh?\" Seth asked. All of a sudden, a Segway appeared and Seth was standing on it. \"Holy shit, this is awesome!\" he exclaimed, whirling around on it. \"Segway!\" Jay cheered. \"I've always wanted to ride one of these things!\" Seth chuckled. \"Alright, Anastasia,\" Craig said, turning to me. \"Make a wish. Anything you want.\" There was only one thing I wanted more than anything right now. So, I shut my eyes and wished with all my might. \"W-Where am I?\" an all too familiar deep voice inquired behind me. \"A-Anastasia, is that you?!\" Swiveling around on my heels, I gasped in surprise. My wish worked. James was alive and he was here. \"JAMES!\" I screamed, immediately darting towards him. As soon as we came face-to-face, I snaked my arms around his neck and planted a passionate kiss on his lips. I didn't care how cheesy this moment was, I was just happy to see him again. Or kiss lasted for about a minute or two before James pulled away and stroked my cheek with his thumb. \"I thought I lost you… Look, about what I said to you back on earth before Danny took you, I'm so sorry, I was just angry and-\" \"Don't,\" I cut him off by putting a finger to his lips. \"I should've told you sooner, but we're here now. That's all that matters. I love you, James, and I know for a fact that I want to spend the rest of my life with you.\" \"In that case,\" he began, reaching into his pocket and pulling something out… it was my ring. Even after our argument, he still held onto it. \"Marry me. Right here. Right now,\" he said, sliding the ring onto my finger and looking into my eyes. I nodded. \"Of course!\" Grinning, he took my hand and we walked back over to Seth, Jay, Craig and Lydia. While Seth and James had their little bromance reunion, Craig turned to Jay and said, \"Go ahead, Jay. Make a wish. Anything you can think of.\" \"Anything?\" Jay asked, quirking a brow. He closed his eyes and thought for a couple seconds… \" Everybody\" \" Rock your body\" Everyone gasped and screamed as the Backstreet Boys themselves slowly made their way through the crowd. \"What?!\" Craig exclaimed. \"You've got to be shitting me,\" James said in awe. \"No. Fucking. Way.\" Seth said, hopping off his Segway, which immediately disappeared after he did so. \" Everybody. Rock your body right\" \"Best. Wish. Ever!\" Lydia shouted, pumping her fist into the air. \"I can't believe this this happening,\" I said, my mouth dropping open in shock. \" Backstreet's back, alright!\" \" Backstreet's back, alright!\" The rhythm kicked into overdrive as the Backstreet Boys stopped in the center of the party. \" Oh my God, we're back again. Brothers, sisters, everybody sing.\" As if on cue, we all broke out into impromptu dancing. \" Gonna bring the flavor, show you how.\" \"Gotta question for you better answer now, yeah.\" \"Am I original? (Yeah) Am I the only one? (Yeah) Am I sexual? (Yeah) Am I everything you need? You better rock your body now.\" Jay started to make it rain while Seth and Craig started break dancing. Then, Jay and Lydia started dancing together and James and I did the same. \" Everybody (Yeah). Rock your body (Yeah). Everybody, rock your body right. Backstreet's back, alright, alright.\" \" Alright. Backstreet's back, ALRIGHT!\" Giant confetti canons fired off as the song died down and we all cheered, having the absolute time of our lives. There was only one thing I wanted to do now. \"Do you James Edward Franco, take Anastasia Olivia Massaro to be your lawfully wedded wife? To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish until death do you part?\" Craig asked, turning to James. James nodded, lightly grazing his thumb over my wrist. \"I do.\" Craig smiled and turned to me. \"And do you, Anastasia Olivia Massaro, take James Edward Franco to be your lawfully wedded husband? To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish until death do you part?\" My lips curled into a smile and I looked James directly in the eye, \"I do.\" \"Then, by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife,\" Craig announced. \"You may now kiss the bride.\" James cupped my face in his hands and our lips met in an intense, loving kiss. I was now Mrs. Anastasia Massaro Franco, and I wouldn't have had it any other way. ","Summary":" A/N: So, I saw This Is The End last summer and I loved it so much that I decided to write a fic abo"}]
