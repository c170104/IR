[{"Movie":"Becoming Jane","Title":"I am yours, I am all yours","Author":"aknuk","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10702745","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Primer capítulo Jane bajó su pluma nuevamente, abatida por los pensamientos que no salían de su mente. Observó su rostro en el reflejo de su espejo, y no pudo evitar que su mente exclamase a toda voz lo que había sucedido esa tarde. No se sentía así desde su romance con el señor Smith. ¿Pero hasta que punto era comparado con él? Sonrió con melancolía y se abrazó a sí misma. ¡Lo había visto! Mejor aún: él la había venido a ver. ¡Era algo demasiado inesperado! Estaba idéntico a como ella lo recordaba, pero ahora tenía años de sabiduría a cuestas. Sin embargo, parecía haber perdido su picardía juvenil que tanto le gustaba. No parecía el mismo Tom juguetón que la tentaba a decir cosas indebidas. Se había vuelto un hombre hecho y derecho, con una familia formada. ¡Que linda era su hija! Y se llamaba Jane, como ella. Se preguntó si sería en honor a su persona ya que es mucha casualidad para que solo fuese una mera coincidencia. Se soltó su cabello y comenzó a peinarlo. Sus canas se habían acumulado y sus ojos se habían arrugado con el pasar de sus cuarenta y cinco años. Ya poco quedaba de esa Jane soñadora y tenaz que fuera en su juventud. Ahora estaba marcada por la experiencia y la sabiduría. Por la muerte y el sufrimiento, por el sacrificio y la tristeza. Eran muy pocas las cosas que la regocijaban, pero al menos tenía su escritura. En ella podía plasmar todo pensamiento y sentimiento que la inundasen. Definitivamente, Lefroy fue una inspiración para ella. Quien sino, podía inspirar al orgulloso señor Darcy. Sonrió al preguntarse si Lefroy se dio cuenta de las similitudes que compartía con Darcy. Claro esta, había una gran diferencia entre ambos y era que uno tenía dinero mientras que otro carecía de el. Esto no era poca cosa, ya que fue el gran impedimento para que ellos se casasen. ¡Oh, querido Lefroy! Cuanto se ha extrañado. Su juventud lo añora y lo reclama. Sus pensamientos fueron interrumpidos cuando su hermana Cassandra entró a la habitación. -¿Cómo te encuentras?- le preguntó, sabiendo el torbellino que debía ser la mente de su hermana. - Bien- respondió sinceramente-. En algún momento tenía que pasar… Cassandra asintió con la cabeza. Se acercó a su hermana y comenzó a cepillar su cabello. - El también estaba muy impactado. Se percibió cuan conmovido estaba al verte. Jane no dijo nada y solo admiró sus dedos que tamborileaban el tocador. - Y su hija- continuó Cass-. Su hija se llama Jane también. ¿Crees que es por ti? Yo sí lo creo. Es maravilloso que te tenga tanto apreció como para poner tu nombre en su hija. - No voy a mentir al decir que no me agradó verlo. Pero es una mezcla de alegría y tristeza, de melancolía y añoranza. No estoy segura de cuan agradable haya sido verlo. - Haz sido muy fuerte, Jane. Esto de seguro no ha sido fácil para ti ni para él. Han pasado ya muchos años y muchas cosas. - Lo sé. Estoy conciente de que la vida nos ha cambiado a ambos y ya no somos aquellos jóvenes apasionados. Mucho de su semblante ha cambiado. Se lo ve maduro y serio, como el caballero que estaba destinado a ser- dijo, con un dejo de tristeza. - Pero su amor por ti no ha cambiado. Lo pude observar en sus ojos: se le encendieron cuando te escuchaba leer. Jane volvió a obsesionarse con sus manos manchadas de tinta. - Lo que ha pasado, ha pasado. No hay beneficio alguno en volver al pasado y añorar lo que se pudo haber vivido- o a entender que no quería hablar más del tema. No se volvió a mencionar el tema hasta el día siguiente, cuando Henry y Eliza vinieron a visitarla. Jane se preparó mentalmente para el tema, ya que conocía a su cuñada lo suficiente como para saber que tocaría el tema. - ¡Que cambiado que está el señor Lefroy! Lo he visto tan maduro, casi avejentado. - Ah, los años pasan para todos, mi querida. Nadie se salva de ellos- dijo Henry. - Ha tenido una excelente carrera de abogado. Definitivamente, llegará a ser alguien muy importante en la rama de las leyes. Jane se dedicaba a hundir su rodaja de limón en el té y observar como reflotaba en segundos. Se negaba a ser participe de esa conversación y deseaba con todas sus ansias que finalizase. - ¿Y a ti que te ha parecido, querida Jane?- preguntó su cuñada con intriga. - Creo que ha sido bueno verlo. Es un viejo amigo a quien respeto y quiero como tal. - El cual tú dejaste plantado para casarse- le recordó su hermano. Todos los ojos se posaron en ella para observar su expresión. - Jamás me pidió matrimonio- dijo, intentando estar serena-. Solo cometimos el error estúpido de dejarnos llevar. - ¿Dejarse llevar?- repitió Eliza-. No fue una sandez - Ustedes, simplemente, se amaban- dijo Cassandra, con la voz un tanto tomada-. Oh, Jane. Siempre me preguntó que pudo haber pasado si ustedes dos se hubiesen escapado. - Nunca sabremos que hubiese pasado porque no pasó- alegó Henry, un tanto exasperado de hablar sobre un tema tan profundo para Jane-. Tal vez se hubiesen terminando odiando o detestando, y toda posibilidad se hubiera marchitado. - Es por eso que Jane se detuvo de continuar con su huída. El futuro de sus familias dependía de ellos- dijo Cassandra. - Hubiese sido una locura. El tenía que alimentar a toda su familia y yo a la mía. Un episodio como este habría hecho que todos quedasen en la ruina. - Tú eres una persona muy buena. Y tu decisión fue reflejo de todo eso. Pero, me pregunto si el precio tal vez haya sido muy alto…-dedujo astutamente Eliza. - Tal vez lo fue, tal vez no. Creo que Tom logró formar una linda familia y posicionarse socialmente. Y así poder ayudar a su familia. De alguna manera yo logré mi propia independencia al no comprometerme sin amor y poder vivir de mi escritura. - Y eso no es poca cosa, mi querida Jane!- recalcó Cassandra con orgullo. - Pero es como dice mi querido hermano. Quien sabe si, luego de pasar tantos inconvenientes, hubiésemos acumulado rencor por la culpa de todo el daño causado. Hubo un minuto de silencio en el que pareció que todos se daban un tiempo para meditar sobre el asunto - De todas maneras, creo que el señor Lefroy tiene mucho que pensar. La tarde transcurrió con el toque de otros temas, pero Jane no pudo apartar sus pensamientos de todo el asunto. Le resultaba poco placentero y muy angustioso. ¿Qué necesidad había de revolver el pasado? ¿Por qué la había afectado de esta manera? No era el único amor de su vida, ni lo más extraordinario que le había sucedido. Entonces, ¿por qué le dolía tanto recordar a Lefroy En aquel momento, abrió los ojos. Todavía lo amaba. Y no había intento de derrocar esta asunción que pudiese desbaratar ese sentimiento. Y sin duda que el reencuentro la había perturbado. No había sabido de él años y ya lo consideraba un fantasma de mucho tiempo atrás. Pero ahora él se encontraba tan vivo y palpable como la primera vez. Sus pensamientos fueron interrumpidos por la sirvienta. - Señorita- dijo, mientras le entregaba una carta sobre una bandeja. - Gracias, Mary- y observó como se retiraba de la sala. Todavía estaba intrincada en sus pensamientos, cuando decidió leer el sobre. Bastó con ver la letra del remitente, para saber quien era: su caligrafía era fina y cálida. Era de Tom Lefroy. - ¿Jane? ¿Qué sucede?- dijo su hermana mientras entraba a la sala. No sabía cuanto tiempo había estado observando el sobre, pero su postura había sido impasible e inmutable. Su hermana le alcanzó el sobre. Leyó el remitente y le dedicó a su hermana una mirada pasmada-. ¡Ábrelo, Jane! ¿Qué esperas? Sin embargo, Jane esperó una semana para abrirlo. Lo mantuvo en su tocador, viéndolo día y noche, preguntándose que podía ser. Por las noches, se avergonzaba de ser como una niña idiota y quería abrirlo. Pensaba en abrirlo al otro día, pero el coraje por la mañana ya no era el mismo. Una noche, luego de soñar con Lefroy y la fuga, se levantó de la cama rápidamente y la abrió. Estimada señorita Austen: Probablemente, le debe extrañar muchísimo esta carta, pero tengo el deseo de expresarle cuanto me alegra haberla visto. Como viejos amigos, me alegro enormemente saber que ha logrado vivir de lo que ama. Y me enorgullece mucho ver que ha logrado su independencia. Si a usted no le resulta impertinente, me gustaría poder verla nuevamente y conversar como los viejos amigos que somos. Espero su respuesta. Tom Lefroy. Buenas! Aca vengo con mi humilde historia sobre algo que me hubiese encantado que pasara en la vida de Austen. Como no hay mucha información sobre ella, me he tomado todas las libertades para crear esta aventura. Espero que disfruten. Esta historia es un regalo para mi buena amiga Viviana. Se lo mucho que te gusta esta historia y cuanto te dolió su desenlace. No puedo cambiar lo que ocurrió, pero te puedo regalar este pequeño reencuentro.

It's alternate history but then of course, so was a lot of the movie haha Its about Wisley and Jane. I hope you like it. Patience December 16 th , 1799 Dearest Cassandra, In the first place I hope that you and your beloved husband Mr. Ferrars are so busily stringing the banister with garland and adorning the ceiling with sprigs of mistletoe, preparing for the happiest of Christmases, that you are far too busy at this moment to read my letter. Though you should understand that I do expect a prompt response as always. Are you having of a blustery winter season in Steventon? We are frightfully cold here. The snow is two hands deep and if one should step so much as a foot outdoors, they immediately feel regret for it. My husband and I spend every evening sitting by the hearth wrapped in thick throws. Sometimes Mr. Wisley plays a game of backgammon while I write. He has implored me to join in his lonely game of one but I can't abide it. This novel will not write itself after all. I am working on a new one – one that I have titled \"Susan\". I would give you a glimpse but you know that I am hopelessly superstitious. Now, sister, I must confide in you that I received my Christmas gift very early this year. Just two days before, I learned that I am with child. The house maiden Gretchen was the first to notice that my symptoms (of which no woman in polite society would ever detail) could mean but one thing. My condition was soon confirmed by the local doctor. Mr. Wisley could not be happier. He has been fawning over me something terrible. I must confess I love it though of course I protest otherwise. You always said that I liked to be disagreeable. I shall not change that now though I fully expect much else to change. The one thing that shall never yet change is my abiding love for my husband. You know that I went into this union with no affections – no feelings other than panic and perhaps a slight appreciation that he was helping our destitute family's situation, accompanied by a slight resentment that he wasn't Mr. L. However, I came to adore Mr. Wisley. He is not only a true gentleman but exceedingly kind and gentle. He was so patient even when I openly hesitated in marrying him. Here we are now three years later, enjoying an exceptionally contented marriage. I used to believe that love must be accompanied by bells and melodious song. All the heroines in my novels believe the same. They represent my girlish ideology. I have however since learned that deep, abiding affections must be cultivated over time. Those sorts of affections endure because they are forged from friendship and kindness. I am so grateful for my Mr. Wisley. I assure you that I count my blessings daily. You, Cassandra, are one of my most cherished blessings. Have a merry, merry Christmas, sister dear. I shall expect to see you and my sweet nieces very soon. Yours, J.W.

É realmente um filme muito belo, porem, que nos lembra que nem tudo que queremos acontece, por isso ao mesmo tempo que e romantico, é realista, e foi isso que me conformou logo depois. Mas, como eu comecei a amar a Jane Austen agora em julho, é com muito orgulho e humildade que posto essa fanfic, e espero que gostem, do fundo do coracao, por que foi de lá que veio a minha inspiracao. Muitos beijos a todos, e, boa leitura. :** Kiss and say Goodbye Thomas apareceu naquela floresta e despejou toda a verdade à Jane. Ele não poderia continuar com aquela palhaçada. Não dava mais, seu coração não suportaria se unir a outra mulher que não fosse aquela que estava e sua frente. Eles estavam tão perto um do outro agora, mas tão longe em pensamento. Jane queria agarrá-lo e dizer que não agüentaria se casar com outro que não fosse ele. Thomas por outro lado, parecia disposto à agradar a vontade de seu tio, cortando relações com sua amada. Não era o que ele queria fazer, mas sim o que precisava, pela sua família. Então, desatou a dizer: _Quis o destino que nos encontrássemos para que eu pudesse te dizer algumas coisas. _Que tipo de coisas? Veio me dizer o quanto sua noiva é mais rica do que eu, e possui mais conexões? Se este for o caso, pode dar meia volta e ir... – foi cortada pelo homem à sua frente. _Eu amo você, Jane. Nunca diria-lhe qualquer tipo de desaforo como esse – suas testas se encostaram e ela mais do que nunca desejava beijá-lo. Precisava dele agora, após tanto tempo, e mesmo depois de uma declaração dessas. – Mas, por outro lado, conversei com meu tio e o mesmo infelizmente ordenou que eu desacatasse os meus sentimentos, cortando relações com você. De acordo com ele, eu não poderei mais te ver, por causa das minhas obrigações e dos laços que você não tem. Quando ouviu estas palavras Jane foi soltando os braços que estavam em volta de seu pescoço, e se afastando dele com lentidão, de como quem encontra um animal perigoso no meio da floresta. Ela ia se preparando para dar meia volta e ir embora, com os olhos úmidos, mas, antes que pudesse, Thomas segurou sua mão e voltou a dizer: _Quando eu disse obrigações me referi ao que está escrito nesta carta. E entregou a ela um pedaço de papel, cheio de letras escritas com certa dificuldade, onde sua mãe lhe agradecia pela mesada que havia sido mandada, e dizia também que não sabe o que seria da vida deles sem esse pouco dinheiro que o filho dava. Jane acabou de ler a carta chorando, porém, tentando se conter para não mostrar a ele o quanto a situação a abalara. Então, pra dar-lhe uma resposta, respirou fundo, enxugou o rosto e disse a ele, com a voz mais calma que podia dadas as circunstancias: _Entendo o seu lado Lefroy, e essa carta, de certa forma, me consola. Pois agora sei que não está me abandonando por ser um acomodado com o dinheiro do tio, como de certa forma fui levada a pensar. Mas sim por que sua família depende de você, e eu lhe garanto, que embora eu nunca mais vá esquecer esse dia, eu não guardo ressentimentos de sua pessoa, se era o que você temia. – respirou fundo mais uma vez, ainda contendo o choro. – Uma vez que minha opinião fosse pedida eu mesma diria que você não pode se casar comigo. Não seria capaz de sacrificar a sobrevivência de sua família pela minha. Os olhos de Thomas também lacrimejavam tamanha a compreensão de Jane, e sentiu, novamente, uma pontada no coração suplicando-lhe para que fosse feliz fugindo com ela, mas como a mesma dissera, não seria capaz de fazê-lo agora que sabe de suas obrigações. _Quanto aos laços, Jane, eu não dou a mínima para eles. Foi apenas um argumento que meu tio usou para tentar me convencer a não ficar com você, por isso ignoraria facilmente esse segundo dada a importância do primeiro. Algumas lágrimas sorrateiras ainda escapavam do rosto de ambos, quando Thomas aproximou-se de dela e acariciou-lhe o rosto. _Me desculpe Jane. – disse num sussurro. - Hoje é nosso último dia juntos. E eu quero te abraçar uma última vez. Dito isso ela atirou-se em seus braços, agarrando-o da forma mais firme que podia, para que ele nunca mais fosse embora. Fato esse que não iria acontecer. Depois de correspondido o abraço, ficaram assim pelo que parecia uma eternidade, até que Thomas se aproximou de seu ouvido e disse: _Quando você se virar e for embora, não quero que olhe para trás. Quero que se lembre de nós assim. Juntos, como um dia pensamos que ficaríamos. Ela consentiu com a cabeça, e como se fosse impossível, começou a separar-se dele, ficando ainda muito próximos, com os olhos fechados, apenas desfrutando seu ultimo momento. _Por favor Jane, não chore. Não vale a pena desperdiçar suas lágrimas por mim. Ela abriu os olhos e disse, com toda a convicção possível: _Voce foi a única coisa na minha vida que valeu a pena. Ambos suspiraram e Lefroy fez seu ultimo pedido: _Antes de ir, lhe peço uma última coisa. Me de apenas um beijo, e então poderemos dizer adeus. Ela passou as mãos em seu pescoço, e com um sorriso dolorido no rosto ambos se aproximaram e encostaram seu lábios. As mãos dele passeavam nas costas dela, explorando aquele local para tentar guardar cada traço na memória, e era exatamente o que ela fazia de volta. Depois de alguns segundos, Jane pediu passagem para aprofundar o beijo, e Thomas cedeu na hora, ambos realizando uma batalha de amor e desejo que nunca seria vencida. Quando ambos ficaram sem fôlego, ele começou a traçar uma trilha de beijos pelo pescoço dela, voltando para cima então e finalmente depositando um último casto e doce beijo em seus lábios, completamente o oposto do que era o outro. Ficaram abraçados por mais alguns segundos, antes que ela quebrasse o silencio, sussurrando: _Adeus Lefroy. Eu te amo. – sussurrou a ultima parte. _Adeus Jane. Ela então, não agüentando mais a tortura, desvencilhou-se dos braços dele, enxugou as lágrimas que caíam de seu rosto, e seguiu seu caminho de volta para casa, sem olhar para trás, como ele havia pedido. Sem olhar para trás, para te a chance de ver todos os seus sonhos bem ali, naquele homem, que aquele momento fazia o mesmo que ela. Ambos desistiram de seus sonhos por causas nobres, e ao mesmo tempo que essa virtude os satisfazia, ela os matava. E aiii? O que acharam? Eu sei que esta meio primário, mas espero ter conseguido agradar a todos.. :) ah, que quiser, eu tambem escrevo fanfics da serie de tv Bones, entao, dá lá uma olhadinha no meu perfil, e, quem quiser, por favor, deixa aí uma review! haushuas adoro rima gente...

De ser así, Tom Lefroy estaría ahora mismo en mi cama. :D Dedicado especialmente a Escristora quien me inspiró un poco a escribir este pequeño relato. Jane Dublín, Irlanda. Medianoche del 23 de junio de 1802. Aquella situación le inquietaba. A pesar de no ser la primera vez que se encontraba de aquel modo, siempre tendía a ponerse más nervioso de lo normal. Su mujer estaba apunto de dar a luz a su segundo hijo y lo único que podía hacer era mantenerse al margen, tal y como le habían recomendado el médico y la matrona. Dio órdenes a una de las enfermeras de que lo avisaran cuando todo hubiera acabado y se dirigió rumbo a su despacho; a pesar de las horas que eran, no iba a pegar ojo teniendo a su esposa en el estado en el que estaba. Lo mejor sería tener la mente ocupada en otra cosa. Con paso firme, se encaminó a su destino. Pero antes, pasó por la puerta del pequeño Anthony, que dormitaba ya en su pequeña cama. Entró sigilosamente, sin hacer ruido para no despertar al pequeño. Pronto dejaría de ser el único hijo e iba a ser una dura tarea el convencerle de ello. Aunque, por el momento, parecía llevarlo bien. Era un niño bastante bueno y casi nunca le daban problemas de ningún tipo. Tom sonrió tiernamente, le acarició con suavidad el cabello rizado de su hijo, le dio un pequeño beso y le arropó. Salió antes de interrumpirle su plácido sueño. Bajó las escaleras hasta el piso inferior, donde se disponía a entrar en su despacho. Justo cuando se encontraba girando el manillar de la puerta, escuchó otro fuerte grito de su esposa proveniente del piso de arriba. Tomó una gran bocanada de aire y entró sin pensárselo más en el habitáculo. Pese a que se suponía que esa era la noche más corta del año, definitivamente iba a ser la más larga para él. Sentía impotencia por no poder hacer nada por calmarle el dolor a su esposa, así que prefirió no pensar en ello. Se paseó un poco por la estancia sin saber qué hacer exactamente. Revisó unos papeles que había en su mesa; no era gran cosa, así que volvió a estar como al principio. Se levantó de su asiento y abrió su licorera. Normalmente no solía beber solo, siempre le parecía ridículo hacerlo, pero en esa ocasión no tuvo más remedio; necesitaba algo para calmarle los nervios. Con Anthony le pasó lo mismo, pero esta vez la cosa se estaba alargando más y solo le quedaba esperar. Se sirvió una copa de whisky escocés, regalo de un amigo de Edimburgo. Regresó a su asiento, apoyó la espalda en el respaldo y cerró los ojos mientras aquel amargo brebaje le ardía en las entrañas lentamente. Efectivamente, todo aquello había conseguido tranquilizarlo un poco, pero no lo suficiente. Así que, con la excusa de haber probado el regalo de su colega, se propuso a redactar una carta agradeciéndole el presente; hacía mucho que no le veía, así que seguramente se alegraría al recibir noticias de él. Abrió el primer cajón de su mesa y ahí lo vio. Hacía aproximadamente un mes recibió aquel paquete. Lo guardó ahí, en aquel cajón, olvidando su existencia hasta ese momento. Ni siquiera sabía quién era el remitente. Lo cogió y, tan sólo con observar los torpes trazos de la caligrafía, supo al instante de quién se podía tratar. El sello del lacrado también le delató. Solamente una persona de Steventon podría mandarle aquello. Soltó una leve carcajada y sonrió de lado. —Cuánto tiempo sin recibir nada tuyo, viejo amigo—a pesar de no sorprenderle el autor del paquete, lo que sí que le extrañó fue el tamaño de éste. Normalmente no solía enviarle más que cartas breves de apenas una sola hoja, con lo cual, le intrigaba más averiguar de qué se trataba. Lo desenvolvió con delicadeza y pudo descubrir que se trataba de un libro. Frunció ligeramente el ceño, sin entender nada de aquello. Le desconcertó por completo aquel detalle, puesto que no era muy común ese tipo de cosas en su amigo. En la tapa del ejemplar únicamente ponía el título de éste: \"Orgullo y Prejuicio\". Tras unos segundos, en los cuales se quedó pensativo, cayó en la cuenta de quién podría ser su autor. Lo abrió de inmediato, encontrando entre las primeras páginas una nota donde rezaba lo siguiente: «Estimado amigo Thomas: Lamento mucho mi ausencia absoluta durante todos estos meses, pero me destinaron fuera del país y estuve incomunicado por completo. Espero que aceptes mis disculpas por ello. Hace unas semanas que se publicó el primer libro de mi hermana menor, Jane. Me complace ofrecerte un ejemplar como muestra de mi agradecimiento por todo lo que has hecho por mí. Si se entera de que te envié algo así, seré hombre muerto, así que te ruego que guardes total discreción al respecto. Al menos por el momento. Al parecer, quiere mantenerse en el anonimato. Espero que este presente sea de tu entero agrado y deseo que lo disfrutes. Eliza te manda recuerdos. Sin más dilación, me despido por el momento. Manda recuerdos a toda la familia. Un cordial saludo de tu amigo ~Henry Austen~ » La sonrisa se amplió en su rostro. Meneó la cabeza, cogiendo de nuevo su copa y tomando otro pequeño sorbo del licor. Sostuvo el libro entre sus manos y lo miró con detenimiento. Se quedó mirando fijamente la portada de cuero, decorado únicamente con las letras del título en medio. Abrió el libro a continuación y comenzó a leer. Al principio no le estaba convenciendo mucho pero, poco a poco, las palabras le estaban embriagando más que el whisky que llevaba entre las manos. —Hum... Interesante—murmuró deteniéndose en una de las páginas y se echó a reír—. ¿Por qué me está resultando tan familiar este señor Darcy?—se acomodó un poco más en su asiento y se sirvió una copa más— Me cae bien el señor Darcy. Se nota que tiene una gran personalidad—la sonrisa no desaparecía de su cara a pesar de todo. Se limitaba a asentir y a reír a cada instante. Chasqueó la lengua a modo de desapruebo y negó con la cabeza— ¡Oh, señorita Bennet! Ni se te ocurra hacerle caso al descarado del señor Wickham... —y volvió a echarse a reír como si no hubiese un mañana. Continuó leyendo aquellos pasajes con determinación; las palabras pasaban volando frente a sus ojos, haciendo que aquella lectura le penetrara rotundamente a lo largo de unas horas. Tanto fue así, que ni siquiera se dio cuenta de la hora que era cuando leyó la última página. Cerró el libro y se quedó ensimismado durante unos segundos. Durante esos segundos, le vinieron a la mente los recuerdos que compartió con la escritora y un halo de melancolía le recorrió el cuerpo. Con su sonrisa aún permanente en el rostro, sacudió la cabeza y se mordió levemente el labio inferior. Abrió nuevamente el primer cajón de su escritorio y sacó una hoja de papel. Cogió su mejor pluma y mojó la punta en el tintero, rasgando con suavidad el fino y delicado papel; se disponía a escribirle al remitente del paquete. De pronto, llamaron a la puerta y la cabeza de la enfermera asomó tras ella. —Señor Lefroy—dijo sonriente—, su esposa le está esperando. Tom dejó lo que estaba haciendo y guardó todo en el primer cajón del escritorio. Miró el reloj de cuco que se hallaba en la pared; eran casi las seis de la mañana. Miró entonces hacia la ventana y comprobó que estaban apunto de filtrarse los primeros rayos de luz de la mañana en cuestión de unos pocos minutos. Sin más demora, subió escaleras arriba hasta el piso superior. —¡Mira, Tom!—exclamó Mary con una mezcla entre júbilo y cansancio en su voz, al ver a éste entrar en el dormitorio—¡Es una niña! Tom caminó despacio hasta la cama y se sentó al lado de su esposa. Le sonrió con ternura y depositó un beso en su frente, arrebatándole a la pequeña de entre sus brazos. La meció ligeramente y ésta abrió sus diminutos ojos, que resultaron ser grises, como los de su madre. Le acarició una de sus sonrosadas mejillas con suavidad y se quedó mirándola, eclipsado por la mirada de su pequeña hija. —¿Cómo la llamaréis?—preguntó repentinamente la enfermera. Tom se quedó pensativo. Continuaba meciéndola entre sus brazos mientras cientos de nombres pululaban por su mente. Pero sólo había uno que era perfecto para ella. Sólo uno sería el que llevase. Y él sabía cuál era. —Jane...—murmuró Tom sin apartar la vista de la niña—. Se llamará Jane. —¡Oh, es perfecto, querido!—intervino Mary con una leve sonrisa— Madre se alegrará saber que le pusimos su nombre. Mas Tom no pensaba precisamente en la madre de su esposa. Sin saber el motivo, ese nombre le anduvo rondando por la mente durante un largo rato. Una parte de él quiso llamarla así por el motivo aparente, pero sólo él sabría el verdadero motivo. Sólo él sabría que se inspiró en una escritora que, una vez, en algún lugar, le robó el corazón. Corazón que había vuelto a conquistar con aquella novela y con la que sentía que había una parte de él. Y nadie más sabría eso, ya que para el resto del mundo sería simplemente Jane. NDA : A decir verdad, puede que este no fuese el motivo del nombramiento de la primogénita de Tom Lefroy, pero yo prefiero pensar que así fue. Ni siquiera se saben los motivos, pero pienso que más de una persona cree que sus motivos fueron su supuesto romance que tuvo con Jane Austen y que, dentro de lo que cabe, nunca pudo olvidarle [soy un poco ilusa, lo sé, pero no me importa. xD]. Cuando Jane Austen comenzó a escribir Orgullo y Prejuicio ya conocía al señor Lefroy, con lo cual, probablemente lo acabase unos años después y me pareció interesante incluirlo en esta historia. La primera vez que se publicó lo hizo con un nombre diferente o anónimamente, no lo recuerdo bien, por eso he hecho alusión de que no había constancia del autor del libro. He intentado averiguar el lugar de nacimiento de Jane, pero no había manera de saberlo, así que supuse que podría haber sido en Dublín, ya que su padre estuvo trabajando como juez y demás cosas allí. Pero los datos no son completamente exactos. Para terminar, he de añadir que Jane Christmast Lefroy nació el 24 de junio de 1802 y de ahí el motivo por el que hoy suba esta historia. La tenía en mente desde hacía un par de semanas, pero hará cosa de un par de días que la comencé a escribir y pensé que sería un bonito homenaje a la primera hija de Tom Lefroy. En fin, no sé cómo me habrá quedado la historia, ya que es la primera vez que escribo sobre este fandom. Así que espero que os haya gustado tanto como a mí escribirlo. Próximamente escribiré otra historia más, pero ya más adelante. Cualquier tipo de review será bien recibido.

Espero que os guste :) Era lo único a lo que alcanzaba a pensar durante la noche y lo único que recordaba al despertar. Un par de ojos azules parecían perseguirla en sueños, escondiéndose y esperándola en los rincones más profundos de su mente para aturdirla. Jane sabía que estaban ahí, que no se irían. En el fondo, tampoco deseaba que desaparecieran. Era lo único que le quedaba de el. Cada noche, durante el resto de su vida, Jane los visualizaba, preguntándose si seguirían igual de luminosos, de aquel azul tan brillante con ese toque de picardía. O si estaban cerrados y yacían bajo la tierra. Cuando se marchó, Jane solo conservaba sus recuerdos. Retazos de una vida pasada que ya no alcanzaba a creer como suya. Por eso, muchas veces se aferraba de manera sobrehumana a la escritura, deseosa de plasmar en ella todos aquellos deseos e ilusiones que se vieron frustrados.

Probablemente no, pensaba ella. ¿Que sentido habría tenido entonces escribir sus historias? ¿No reflejaba en ellas sus aspiraciones? Una vida con el señor Lefroy lo hubiera sido, así que no habría tenido la necesidad. Jane no supo nada de el durante mas de 20 años, pero fue entonces cuando por accidente, él apareció en Londres. Jane sintió una especie de latido que cruzo su pecho, mas profundo y doloroso que los que acostumbraba a sentir cuando pensaba en él. Se quedó petrificada mientras Lefroy avanzaba con paso algo dubitativo hacia ella, como si tuviera miedo de no poder controlarse y estrecharla entre sus brazos hasta el fin de los tiempos. Las personas a su alrededor comentaban algo acerca de otra Jane, una jovencita que no se separaba del lado de Lefroy. Pero ni Jane ni Tom escuchaban nada, puesto que todos sus sentidos parecían sumidos en una neblina que los abstraía del mundo. Lo único que Jane podía percibir con claridad d eran aquellos ojos azules y brillantes, que mantenían el mismo toque de picardía que antaño, y aun eran capaces de mirarla como si se asomaran a su alma. Jane los observó con detalle, buscando memorizarlos y llevarse una imagen mejorada y reciente de ellos, que pudiera acompañarla hasta el fin de sus días. Y dejó que la mirasen. Dejó que Tom la mirase como en aquellos bailes, donde aun parecían tener todo el mundo y el tiempo para ser felices. Pero el tiempo no siempre era justo.

Prompts: Always for 10iloveyou After the confessions of their mutual feelings in the gardens of Lady Gresham, Jane immediately wrote to her sister and told her all that had transpired in that moonlit lawn. She wrote freely, foregoing the need to use her scissors to edit said letter, because she only had one thing on her mind and was in too much of a hurry to use the vast number of adjectives she usually had at her disposal. As Jane was riding in the carriage with her cousin, Eliza, and younger brother, Henry, Jane fervently wished that her sister would be with her on this auspicious journey. The long ride from the country into the larger populous of the city of London was absolute torture on Jane's nerves. She was hoping and praying that Tom's uncle would be moved to help their some-what dire situation. Idly twisting her fingers in nervousness and glancing out the window at the passing scenery, Jane took note of how many more carriages were on the road and the number of buildings they had been passing and coming up with the assumption that they must be getting closer to the city. Closer to Tom's uncle and whatever decision he may make with their situation, and whether it will aide or hinder their inner most desires. But even more important to Jane was that she was closer to seeing her beloved Tom. Time slowly passed until the carriage finally pulled to a stop. Peering out the curtains of the carriage, her heart leaped when she saw Tom in the doorway. After being ushered into the house with Eliza and Henry, Jane's gaze shifted from the imposing man in front of them—presumably his uncle—and locked with Tom's who was standing behind him. She could feel the warmth and admiration in his stare, causing tiny flutterings in her stomach. Jane suddenly knew that no matter what his uncle may decide during this trip, she would always love Tom and cherish the way that he could make her feel. If only with a single glance.

Jane/Tom. Becoming Jane. Romance. Angst. 747 words. G. It was wrong of them to want and yearn for each other when nothing more could come from this arrangement. Italics are quotes from the film. All are said by Tom Lefroy (James McAvoy). I'm yours, Jane, heart and soul! After reluctantly accepting Mr. Wisley's proposal, Jane took to a walk in the woods with her brother, George. She explained the situation to him, by way of hand gestures, which is the only way to communicate with him. While she was in the middle of telling him about Wisley's proposal, she heard a twig snap. Jane had an instinctive feeling it was him before she even saw him. Out of all the inappropriate times to see the insufferable Mr. Lefroy, it just had to have been after his recent engagement to another and her hasty acceptance to Mr. Wisley; even when she still felt such passionate feelings for him. She begrudgingly made the proper inquires that propriety calls upon in such a situation. She regrettably inquired after his new fiancé, and asked what so-called Lefroy charm had he used to lure her. Jane could tell that he was uncomfortable and not-at-all happy about the subject matter. Out of the corner of her eye, Jane saw George quietly asking her if she loved him. If she loved him?! Well, of course Jane loved Tom. Even though previously he had basically said he thought more of his family's expectations than what she meant to him; she still does love him after that. Jane did try to forget him, but her heart just wouldn't let him go. Jane, I've tried! I have tried and I cannot live this lie. Can you? Jane denied her true feelings. The sting of his previous rejection still hurt, and she did not want him to see just how much she was still affected by it. While she adamantly refuted how much she did not love Tom, he abruptly rushed towards her uttering that he could not live this lie. What lie is he talking about? All other thoughts fled her mind when he met her lips in a sensitive, familiar, yet incredibly exciting kiss. Sensations swirled in her mind. She raised her hands to his jacket to momentarily pull him closer, before her head momentarily cleared. She forcibly pushed him away, and leapt away when he finally let her go. She wanted to rush towards his warm embrace not away from it, but reality and decorum came back to her at a dizzying rate. It was wrong of them to want and yearn for each other when nothing more could come from this arrangement. When he caught up with her, he put his gloved hand on her cheek and persuaded her to run away with him to get married. Rebuffing the idea at first, Jane realized that happiness was within her grasp and she'd be a fool not to accept his offer. What value would there be in life, if we are not together? Past emotions ran through her body at the mere glance exchanged before he suddenly turned away and rushed towards the street outside the building. She glanced at Henry on her left, silently asking if he would go after the mysterious figure. He complied, rushing after the darkened man. Jane clung to Eliza's arm in the reception area; one part of her desperately wished it was Tom who she thought she saw previously, while the other just wanted to forget Tom and get on with her life. She grasped Eliza's arm tighter when it was confirmed that it was Tom she saw earlier; he had a lovely young lady on his arm and both were following her brother into the room. Jane saw the years have aged him, as they have in turn aged her. While it pained her to see him, it also brought her joy, to see that he was doing well in both health and wealth. When Jane found that the young lady was his daughter, she was pleasantly pleased to find that she had her father's sweet disposition. Although it was a shock to find that she was named 'Jane' as well. Agreeing to read for her new young friend, Jane guided the young lady to sit beside her on the stiff couch. Carefully choosing a passage from the end of her novel, Pride and Prejudice , which would both speak to her audience as well as it would to Mr. Lefroy, she began to read. Applause was given after Jane had uttered the last word. She looked up to acknowledge the praise and tenderly smiled at Mr. Thomas Lefroy when he gave the loudest praise of all. His love.

Étouffée par des conventions stériles. Aigrie avant l'âge. Elle écrivait en tentant de s'évader et de fuir sa vie en la rendant autre. Ca ne marchait pas. On voulait la marier. Elle ne voulait pas. Elle voulait aimer, écrire et vivre. Mais elle ne savait pas comment faire. Et surtout avec qui le faire. Aucun homme ne la comprenait ni ne la tentait pour quelque chose d'autre que ce qu'elle avait à ce moment. Et son prétendant n'avait rien de nuisible...Mais elle n'en voulait pas. Jane avait beaucoup de prétendants, sans même s'en rendre compte. Ce qui était triste, c'était que parmi tous ces visages, elle ne trouvait pas ce qu'elle cherchait. Jane était donc brillante, mais solitaire et vide. Jusqu'à l'arrivée de Tom Ofrell. Leurs deux caractères explosifs avaient d'abord été incapables de s'entendre, Jane avait été incapable de supporter son assurance et ça avait été réciproque. Puis Jane avait compris qu'il y avait plus en Tom que ce qu'elle pensait, et Tom avait compris l'humanité de Jane. Grâce à Tom, Jane avait appris la vraie vie, l'amour, la surprise, le rire. L'exploration, la tension, les vrais sourires et les vrais troubles des moments où on ne savait plus quoi dire. La stupéfaction, le désir, fou, tremblant, passionné, incontrôlable. Où il n'y a plus d'opposition, de conflit, d'égalité, d'indépendance, de fierté. Où on est incapable de se passer de l'autre, où on a mal, où on pleure à s'en détruire. Elle l'avait aimé, vraiment. Elle avait compris qui il était. Un homme perspicace, courageux, aimant, fougueux. Elle ignorait cependant ce qu'il voyait en tant qu'avocat, toutes ces condamnations à mort qui le brisait un peu plus chaque jour, qui lui faisait voir la vie en noir. Peut-être était ce pour ça qu'il avait été dubitatif devant les écrits de Jane, au premier abord. Parce qu'il avait beaucoup vécu malgré sa jeunesse. Et qu'il n'avait plus envie de parler. Sa vie lui déplaisait autant que Jane s'y morfondait. Et puis, il n'avait jamais demandé à venir à la campagne, lui, on l'y avait forcé, le faisait quitter ses amis et sa vie de débauche qui le maintenait en vie. Alors, il y avait peut-être aussi de la mauvaise humeur à tout ça. Tom avait également changé grâce à Jane. Il avait découvert une jeune femme vive, indépendante, intelligente qui l'avait d'abord irrité car lui semblant méprisante envers autrui. Il ne savait pas que cela cachait surtout une grande tristesse. Car Jane était surtout seule, jusqu'à son arrivée. Il avait changé sa vie. Elle avait changé la sienne. Tom avait laissé tomber sa vie de débauche pour tomber fou amoureux de cette femme sensible, intelligente, perspicace, fragile sous ses airs de fureur. Il voulait l'aimer et l'épouser comme elle le méritait. Mais dans la société de leur temps, ils n'avaient pas leur mot à dire. Le précepteur de Tom ne voulait pas d'une femme libre pour lui, et la famille de Jane souhaitait qu'elle épouse un homme dans le fond honnête, mais qui n'était pas pour elle. Alors devant le refus des deux parties, Tom avait jeté l'éponge. Il ne pouvait vivre sans la fortune de celui qui le nourrissait. Et Jane, brisée, l'avait fixée désespérée en comprenant que c'était perdu. Il l'avait fixé, résigné, presque froid sous le poids de la douleur. Elle l'avait quitté, furieuse, brisée. Amoureuse. Il était retourné la voir, longtemps après. Voulant la reconquérir, se faire apprendre qu'elle avait accepté d'épouser quelqu'un d'autre. Furieux, il avait laissé éclater son désespoir et son amour devant l'un de ses prétendants. Encore. Ils avaient fui.C'était selon Tom la seule solution et Jane n'en voyait pas d'autre. Ils étaient prêts à perdre leur nom, leur fortune, leurs familles, ceux qu'ils aimaient pour être ensemble. Ils se consumaient l'un et l'autre, par amour. Mais si Jane était prête à tout perdre, elle ne voulait en aucun cas détruire la vie de Tom. Aussi, lorsqu'elle découvrit dans son sac une lettre de sa famille le remerciant de lui envoyer une partie de sa pension, elle comprit que les frères et sœurs de l'homme qu'elle aimait allaient sombrer si elle continuait sur cette voie là. C'est pourquoi elle le quitta, pour le sauver et les préserver tous. Pour qu'ils ne finissent pas par se haïr. Elle ne voulait pas haïr Tom. Jamais. Elle n'oublierait jamais ses yeux désespérés, souffrants, plein de reproche et d'incompréhension. Il avait suivi sa calèche sans vraiment chercher à l'empêcher de partir. Il était sûrement résigné. Tom avait un jour dit à Jane que pour devenir une grande écrivain, elle devait connaître ce qu'elle écrivait. C'était le cas désormais. Des années après, ils se retrouvèrent. Elle était devenue Jane Austen. Il avait eu une fille. Ils s'aimaient toujours. Ils suffisaient d'observer leurs yeux et leurs échanges de regards. La fille de Tom demanda une lecture à Jane. Elle accepta, touchée. Il avait appelé sa fille comme elle. Il ne l'avait jamais oubliée, il s'était juste résignée à son choix. Il était fier de ce qu'elle était devenue, une écrivain magnifique et digne. Mais ça n'empêchait pas la douleur de s'être perdus. On ne sut jamais la suite de cette scène... Alors qui sait ?

Para Jane ya no hacía falta las palabras; ella ya era feliz contemplando los ojos verdes de su amado. -Jane, he regresado por ti-dijo al tiempo que se esbozaba una media sonrisa en su rostro. Le extendió la mano y la muchacha la tomó sin dudarlo un segundo. -Señor Lefroy-tartamudeó Jane incrédula, podía sentir el rubor en sus mejillas. -Desde ahora no tendrás que llamarme más así seremos marido y mujer-le susurró cerca del oído. -Yo... -Ni una sola palabra más-la interrumpió esta vez levantando un poco más el tono de voz aunque seguía siendo igual de cálido y pausado, música para los oídos de Jane. -Está bien, si mi futuro marido no me deja hablar-contestó a modo de broma.

But I'm not currently in love, thank goodness. (*doesn't go there*) Sorry if this disappoints There's that invisible wall, again, my love. I could feel it, quite explicably there the moment when we rushed to each other like in one of Mrs. Radcliffe's novels, meaningfully and not caring about bare ankles. No matter how happy I was then, I could feel it. A wall. And now, as this early morning coach rumbles down this crumbling forest road, I can't help but think of that letter I held for a second, that soft paper slipping through my fingers as I pushed it back in your coat pocket. It was something I had to hide from you, my love, as you stood in front of me, all chestnut hair and glittering blue eyes and nearly mine. It was something I had to hide in my face. But you saw that worried look, my own boring, earth-brown eyes obviously not concealing the truth as well as I hoped. That invisible wall is growing wider, my dear. I can feel it pushing you away from me on the carriage seat, every moment I remember the words your mother scratched elegantly onto paper; Dear Tom, how timely was the arrival of the money you sent. I'll bet she's a lady, your mother. I'll bet she's kindly, witty and funny, just like you. It's such a shame I'll never meet her. Dear God, I'm going to miss you, my love. Because I can't marry you. Your family – God, your family – they could starve, for all I know. I couldn't be responsible for that! Surely you'll see, that, when I tell you. And now we're sitting in this inn. It's a nice place, it gives me ideas, even as I contemplate what to tell you without breaking our hearts. But they are crushed when I finally find the words, and you grab my hand. I feel like you will never let me go, I can see it in your eyes. Desperate eyes. Did you even know what we were doing? And I pull away. Just like that; an invisible wall driven between us. Cold, wet brick, sliding through my hand as I leave you at the table. \"Typical bloody runaway.\" I hear the coachman mutter as I ask for my suitcase to catch the next coach home. Runaway. It's funny how I never thought of it that way. Typical, bloody writer. Full of romance and metaphors and too many adjectives. Perhaps I'm only suited to writing about love, if this is what it does to me. And, as the coach pulls away from the inn, your face appears at the window, and I can't watch you for long enough. I hate everything for just a moment, I hate this horse with the bandy leg that's making this coach rock, I hate my mother, Cassandra and bonnets. I nearly hate you for a second, darling, sweet Tom. Then I realise what I'm thinking and promptly shush. For you would never love me if I hated the world, would you? A/N: Angst, angst, angst! I wonder if Jane Austen had dark moments?

He couldn't even remember my name at the beginning. He probably thought that I was some stupid little country girl who had big plans for a future that was never going to come true. When I first saw him I thought that he was interested in me too, his gaze met mine briefly and showed curiosity. But after my reading he did not talk to me and only days later he did not even recall my name. .-.-.-. \"What do you make of Mr. Lefroy\" Eliza asked me. \"We're honoured by his presence\" I answered ironically. \"You think so\" my cousin laughed. \"He does\" I replied. \"With his preening prancing Irish cum Bond Street airs.\" \"Jane\" my brother tried to appease. \"Well I call it very high indeed\" I insisted. \"Refusing to dance when there are so few gentlemen. Henry, are all of your friends so disagreeable? Where in Ireland does he exactly come from anyway?\" \"Limerick, Miss Austen\" a smooth voice behind me answered. I turned around, feeling heat rise in my cheeks and I did not know what to say. Instead of looking offended though his gaze shone with interest, his whole face and posture a picture of challenge. He voiced that challenge, disguising it with the request for a dance. And I wondered why. In any case it seemed that this time he could recall my name. .-.-.-. He approached me in one of the worst moments of my life. I saw no other options but to accept Mr. Wisley's addresses - not only had Lady Grisham pressured me into it just minutes ago, mother and even father had made it clear what choices lay ahead of me. And with Tom now standing next to me at the fountain I heard Eliza's words ghosting through my head as well, reminding me that Tom was expected to marry rich. He was out of my reach and on top of that from tomorrow on he would not even be around anymore to at least see him. I had tears in my eyes and did not want to show them to Tom. He stood next to me, out of the corner of my eyes I saw only his exhale in the freezing winter air. And for some reasons I got the feeling that he was just as crushed as I was. \"I have learnt of Mr. Wisley's marriage proposal.\" he started and for reasons of proper conduct he added a meaningless \"My congratulations\". \"Is there an alternative for a well-educated, young woman of small fortune?\" I asked, hoping for him to offer me the solution I just couldn't see. \"How can you of all people dispose of yourself without affection?\" he countered bitterly, refusing to look at me. How wrong he was. How could he not know? I did feel affection, just not for the right man. \"How can I dispose of myself with it?\" I asked in return and because I wanted to be honest with him, to make sure he knew I referred to him I added \"You are leaving tomorrow.\". He finally turned his head to look at me and slowly his eyes found mine. Those beautiful blue eyes were full of wonder. I could stare for the rest of my life into those eyes. But I did not have all those years, only this moment and even that would slip away too quickly. And I realized that I might only have this one opportunity to kiss someone I loved. I focused on his mouth and bent towards him but he bent backwards slightly, leaving our personal spaces unmarred. My eyes travelled up from his lips to his eyes and when I bent forward again he did not move away anymore. When my lips touched his I marvelled at their softness and warmth. It never occurred to me that a man's lips might feel like this. It felt beautiful and I was glad that I was brave enough to kiss him. Suddenly though I felt him respond to me and I absentmindedly noted that his fingers graced my cheek and neck as if he was afraid his touch could break me. Hesitatingly he kissed me back and I knew in that very moment that I never wanted to kiss anybody else anymore in my whole life. When I broke away for air my bravery left me. What had I done? I had never cared much for proper behaviour of my gender but women never initiated an contact this intimate. And he had a reputation, he surely had had kissed a lot of women. God knows he spent passionate nights with them too? It was my first kiss, I didn't know how it was done - how could I have hoped that he might enjoy it as much as I did? I drew back and looked at him to assure myself that I had not just made a complete fool out of myself. Had he not wanted it? Had I done it wrongly? But he only stared back at me awed. I noticed only then that his hand still caressed my neck lightly. \"Did I do that well?\" I asked embarrassed. \"Very\" he replied without thought \"...Very well.\" he nodded and a smile started to form on his face. I was relieved, he seemed to have liked it. \"I wanted to, just once, do it well\" I said a little embarrassed, still I couldn't help but smile at him. I heard men approaching us but I couldn't yet see them. When I looked back at Tom joy was written all over his face and he led me into the shadows of some trees and bushes nearby. \"I have no money, no property\" he rushed out happily and I wondered if his mood and his words could be any more contradictory. \"I am entirely dependent on that bazaar old lunatic, my uncle\" he continued pressing me against a tree \"I cannot yet offer marriage, but - you must know how I feel!\" he said and my stomach began to tingle in anticipation. 'Not YET offer'? \"Jane, I'm yours.\" he said suppressing laughter of pure happiness. \"God, I'm yours. I'm yours heart and soul...!\" It was the first time he had called me Jane. .-.-.-. .-.-.-. She was a beauty with fine features and a pureness you did not find in women of the city. I wondered if she was one of Henry's sisters or if she was a friend of the family. My uncle had introduced me upon my arrival, since I happened to enter in the middle of a speech though nobody was presented to me. I sat down next to Henry and was curious about this girl that had all the attention of the room on her. The girl without name restarted her speech once - twice - and did not stop anymore to compliment the blond next to her. Soon enough I stopped listening to the overly sweet, faceless words and only heard her voice. It was melodious and very pleasant to listen to. I closed my eyes to focus better on it and enjoyed the first moment of relax since my departure from London. .-.-.-. This would develop into the worst winter of my entire life, I just knew it. It was cold and wet and probably the dirtiest walk of my life. And all you ever saw were trees. I so needed to get back into the city. Then something blue caught my eye. It was the girl, the brunette from our neighbour's house. Thank god, finally there was somebody to talk to and to blend out this countryside boredom. I tried to catch her attention but I soon enough realized that I did not know her name: \"Miss...! Miss ..ahm! Miss!\" I tried but she did not seem to hear me. I hurried to reach her, called out to her and finally she reacted. \"- Austen!\" She called back. Oh! \"Mister Lefroy\" I replied and bowed to her. \"Yes, I know\" she responded, seemingly offended. \"But I'm alone\" I had to suppress a laugh at that and how formal she behaved \"Except for me!\" I countered. \"Exactly\" she answered and still did not slow down her steps. \"Oh, come on!\" I said chuckling \"What rules of conduct do apply in this rural situation? We have been introduced, have we not?\" If not wholly the first time, it had been done just now. \"What value is there in an introduction if you cannot even remember my name? In fact you can barely stay awake in my presence.\" Wow. She was offended. Probably I was better off with the trees. I turned around and to signal her my willingness to put some much needed distance between us I did not use her name again when I greeted her goodbye with a \"Madam.\" .-.-.-. She did not leave my mind that day. I had never met someone like her. This girl already enriched this forced vacation and I did hardly know anything about her. \"Mr. Lefroy\" I asked my uncle at dinner \"I was wondering about our neighbours, the Austens\" I started. \"Yes?\" he offered \"Henry told me he has a lot of brothers and sisters? There don't seem to be too many around?\" \"Well, some of the boys don't live at Steventon anymore. One has moved to the coast and two others are still doing services at the army. Then there is Henry of course and George. A nice fellow, he is.\" \"And his sisters?\" I asked, hoping to direct our talk in the right direction. \"He only has two: Cassandra and Jane. You have met them both a few days ago.\" \"Alright.\" I answered \"Which one was which?\" \"Cassandra is the blond girl, she is the one engaged to Mr. Fowl. Jane is the brunette one and the youngest of them all. I think she's your age... How old are you exactly now, Tom?\" \"I'm nineteen, uncle.\" I answered absentmindedly. Jane. .-.-.-. Dancing with her was the best idea ever. Her mouth was sharp, she had a quick mind and wit. Bantering with her was pure fun. \"Will you give so much to a woman?\" she asked somewhere in the middle of our second or third dance. \"Must depend upon the woman.\" I replied, enjoying our conversation, if you could call it that, immensely. \"And what she thinks of me.\" \"That you, Sir\" she retorted immediately \"Are above being pleased.\" I had a hard time deciding whether she was bluntly offending me or challenging me - I was just too amused. And I knew just how to tease her back: \"And I think that you, Miss -\" I faked to not remember her name again, the first time after all it seemed to have gotten quite some effect \"what was that again?\" \"Austen,\" she answered annoyed \"Mister - ?\" she parried She was good at this. \"Lefroy.\" I helped her remember. .-.-.-. When I heard noise coming from the book shelf behind me I was thinking of her already. I had asked Henry a few times about his sister without being obvious. She was a writer and loved to read. Lucy did not read at all and Mr. Lefroy enjoyed outdoor activities like hunting or fishing. Mrs. Lefroy preferred to stitch in her free-time and had told me once that - since the Austens didn't have an own library - Jane was always welcome to come over and read in the one of my relatives. I caught sight of her as she was rushing to tiptoe out of the room. I already had to smile at her. \"Miss Austen\" I greeted her, telling her at the same time that she had failed to creep out. \"Mister Lefroy\" she answered and hearing her say that I noted that is was the first time she spoke out my name. \"...and reading.\" she added mockingly, with a tone that showed she didn't really trust her eyes. She was too much fun. Fine though. I was good at teasing her back. .-.-.-. \"Of course you know about this.\" she accused me, letting me know that she did not approve of boxing. Which encouraged me to tease her with it: \"Of course\" I replied grinning, watching the fight. The trained guy didn't show much sportsmanship though for he kept beating the other, even though that man was already on the floor. He even picked him up, only to beat him down again. What an honour-less bastard. Somebody needed to teach that idiot a lesson. \"Beating the man to a pulp\" Jane said nauseated while I decided to end this myself. I took off my gloves and threw them at Jane, fixing my eyes already on my target. \"What are you doing?\" she asked me in a hurry and when I tossed her my cloak she screamed \"Mister Lefroy! Stop!\" But I was already on my way through the crowd, surprised the boxer with a first healthy blow and announced: \"Let us see how you do against me, Sir!\". I was a good fighter. I was smaller than most but therefor quicker and I dealt my blows more precise than others. I stood good chances of winning against this guy. Then he landed a hit against me. It was not light, yet it could have been worse. I did not feel much of the pain though for I heard her. She screamed my name and I had never hear her say it before: \"Tom!\" Her voice was blurred by others, everybody was screaming and my ears didn't work too well because of the knock, but I was sure I heard her. Somebody pushed me in her direction. And when I was halfway in her arms, halfway in someone elses I heard her clearly: \"Tom! You must stop!\" she pleaded and she sounded so full of worry. So preoccupied, for me. And in that moment I did not care anymore about honour, or teaching anybody any lessons, I just wanted to stay close to her. And I would have, hadn't someone pushed me back into the ring. I had to get up again and fight, or I would make a fool out of myself. I tried to get back focused, but her voice echoed in my ears. And then suddenly I heard it again: \"Tom!\" It was said not only with worry - no, there was unconcealed affection and admiration, out in the open for everybody to hear. So I turned to search for her in that mass of people and realized too late that it had not been Jane who had called out to me but little Lucy. The second I had turned away from my opponent I knew that I had lost the fight. When I woke up from his knock-out people had already left. Everybody but her, she shook me lightly and touched my cheek. I even think she stroked through my hair a few times. And she said something to guide me back into consciousness. It took me a little while to understand what she was repeating again and again: \"Mister Lefroy! Mister Lefroy?\" So we were back to that name again. Yet I couldn't find it in me to be disappointed. Not when she was so close to me, caring for me tenderly. And so, for one brief moment that was still influenced by weakness I allowed myself to give her a look unfiltered with my emotions, because there was no other person on earth that I would rather want to come back to. .-.-.-. Seeing her now was torture. Within the last 17 years - how often had I dreamed of her, wishing to meet her again, imagining what-ifs of all kind? But now, instead of the expected happiness I felt nervousness, sorrow, longing and confusion. I tried to focus. Be nice, say hello and leave again. Should be possible. I'd grown. \"Best behaviour\" I reminded my daughter. If they really had to meet I didn't want her to make a bad impression. \"Jane,\" Henry began \"an old friend.\" And he couldn't help adding \"Late as ever.\" But I did not care, for she stood in front of me, looked at me with those eyes of hers and it was hard to not forget everything else on earth. Eventually I was able to look away and address her sister-in-law: \"Madame la Comtesse. Miss Austen.\" I greeted and bowed. \"Mister Lefroy\" I heard her reply softly and it was impossible to not look at her again. I wanted to say something but nothing made sense and after unsuccessfully searching for the right words to say to her I remembered that I was in company of my daughter and that I needed to introduce her. \"Please allow me to introduce to you\" I said, trying to control my breathing, \"your most avid... of admirers, my daughter, Miss Lefroy.\" Of course the most avid admirer would always be me, but I did not intend to say that. As I did not intend to reveal the full name of my eldest daughter. I was unprepared though for how difficult it was to say \"my daughter\" to Jane Austen, when there was a time when that could have been \"our daughter\" . She seemed to notice it too. \"Miss Austen\" my girl said \"what a pleasure to meet you.\" I was glad she was on good behaviour in deed. However her eagerness got the better of her and she added: \"Will you read for us this evening?\" I should have left her at the carriage, I should have known she was too young and excited to remember the rules of good conduct. \"Ah, well you see, my sister never reads\" Henry excused Jane. \"Otherwise how else is she supposed to remain anonymous?\" \"But -\" my daughter started - did she not remember her education at all? \"Jane!\" I called her back. It worked, however I realized too late that now everybody had heard her name. I immediately looked at Jane to see her reaction. Maybe I could still prevent her from understanding? Her gaze slowly met mine, asking me a thousand questions. And I searched for a thousand answers. That she was called after my mother-in-law, that Jane was a very common name, that it didn't mean anything, that it was the only name I could think of to name a female child. Everything to not tell the truth, that she was simply named after her, Jane Austen. Thank god she didn't know my daughter's middle name yet - Christmas - which had of course nothing to do with believes and everything with the precious holiday I had spent in Hamshire. However, not finding the words to lie to her nor the bravery to tell the truth, I just didn't say anything. For I was too afraid all my brain could form where the words 'I missed you'. .-.-.-. \"I miss you, Jane\" I finally was allowed to say it out loud. \"And I will forever love you\" I added in my mind. I would not return again to England after this last visit. There was nothing to tie me to this country any longer. I laid down the flowers and stretched out my hand to touch the four precious letters on her gravestone. J A N E ","Summary":" Say my name .-.-.-. He couldn't even remember my name at the beginning.

Technically though, this isn't my first fic, this just happens to be the one that I feel is halfway presentable, as well as being the 'first fic' which I'm posting to the internet in general. Hope y'all like it. Musing I did love my wife. There is no plausible doubt over that. While yes, our marriage was arranged – in the style of the times – by our friend's and families' expectations, I did find her interesting, attractive. With the time leading to our marriage , I grew to have a suitable amount of affection for her. She was no doubt a friend, and to live my life with her would not stress my soul nor tax my spirit. As we lived this life together, the affection I had for her grew to a love that was , what I believe , quite fitting for a man and woman married. She was my confidant , and I hers. There were times however, few and far in between , when I was feeling ponderous over some nonsensical and most unrealistic what ifs that I would remember. Recall, more like, the moments I had with my other. That one person, who I have come to realize, will always share my heart – actively or dormant, no matter who else arrives. And to my dismay, or at least without the whole of my willingness, those recollected moments would transfer, into my present. Fantasies are not a regular occurrence for my person, but that one which holds on me, those feelings that will always measure my being, would become questions for the time I spent. How it might… If not questions, then they were simply musings, and those moments I speak of with a mild regret, for truly, there is no active guilt necessary for the situations I refer to; it was not a conscious choice. These moments would contain alternatives: In those flashing thoughts and musings, she was my confidant, and I hers. But if I were to pause for the truth of my mind and heart; those moments were precious to me. And she is as well. ","Summary":" April 15, 2010 Wow, exciting, I'm posting my first fic to the site!

She was witty but naïve, her spirit shining even in the depths of the wild English countryside. They immediately disliked each other. She simply couldn't believe his arrogance and insolence- how dare he fall asleep while she was reading! He simply saw a poor country girl with big dreams. Dreams that would undoubtedly be crushed in the near future. But he couldn't help but admit to himself that there was something about her dark, expressive eyes that made him curious to know more. And she couldn't help but remember his flashing smile, even as she ranted about his insufferable character. They were drawn to each other, unsettling as it was. Fate made them meet again, and again, and again; destiny brought them together. It was their own choices that tore them apart. She brought out the best in him, Tom mused. He had tried living without her, tried bestowing his affections on someone else. It hadn't worked. Though he was now engaged, he spent his days and nights dreaming about her. The very thought of her marrying someone else repulsed him, but who was he to talk? Hypocritical as ever, Jane would have said with her charming smile. When she heard that Tom was engaged, Jane thought her heart would explode. It wasn't a sharp piercing pain, no, not the pain of her heart shattering into a millions pieces. Unyielding pressure built inside her chest as the word resonated in her head, \"Engaged...engaged...engaged...\" Her insides twisted, a fist tightened over her heart. Engaged. \"So soon?\" she heard herself say. Had he forgotten her so soon? When he visited his aunt in the country, his whole body tingled with anticipation and dread. Jane was so close, yet so far away... Duty and love battled each other in his heart, but in the end, love won out. He had already given her his heart and soul, and he would sacrifice his family, his profession, anything, for her. There he was, being selfish again. He knew his family depended on him for money, but if Jane was with him, he knew that he could find a way to make ends meet. Jane wanted to be spontaneous for once. She knew her duty- to stay and marry Mr. Wisley. But that was not what she wanted. She wanted to be with Tom, to have that happy ending she desired for herself, for all her characters. And so she ran away with him. He knew something was wrong with her. Her face was creased with worry, and though she tried to manage a smile for him, he could tell it wasn't genuine. Did she have second thoughts about this? he wondered uncomfortably. What did I do wrong? From the moment she read that letter, Jane knew that she couldn't do this to Tom's family. They depended on him for their meager income- it was their only chance of survival. She knew what it was like to be poor, but Tom's family was probably far worse off than she was. Her father's words came back to her: Nothing destroys spirit like poverty. Jane spent rest of the carriage ride in torment. She wanted to be with Tom, to get married and have children. But what of their life? What of their family? She knew this was the one time she couldn't afford to be selfish. By the time they had come to a stop, Jane had made her decision. His heart pounded with dread as he looked into those dark eyes of hers. They were filled with sorrow and longing, and as she pulled out his mother's letter, he knew what she was about to say. No. No. No. They couldn't be selfless now! They were so close. He was willing to sacrifice his family for her, but she couldn't let him make that sacrifice. Everything she said was true, and that was why he let her go. But as he stood there on the street, watching her carriage draw away, Tom thought that he'd never be happy again. Tom smiled as he saw Jane's success, smiled as he read Pride and Prejudice , smiled at Darcy's antics, so like his own. But his heart twisted at the ending, the happy ending that he and Jane wanted but would never have. Ah, well, she would live vicariously through her novels, and so would he. He could imagine that they had really eloped, all those years ago, and he'd still be as prosperous as he was now. As he watched his eldest daughter pick up the book that he had laid down on the coffee table and begin to read, completely engrossed in the novel, he smiled again. She was pleased that she shared the same name as Jane Bennett, and of course, the authoress herself. Jane Lefroy would never guess that it was anything more than a coincidence.

Tuuudo bem? Bom, esta é a minha segunda fanfic de amor e inocência, e espero que agrade aos leitores.. provavelmente ela será dividida em dois capítulos. O primeiro é este e o segundo, é uma resposta da Jane, ou seja, uma outra carta, mas dessa vez, escrita por ela. Sem mais delongas, boa leitura, nos vemos lá em baixo :) Cartas para Jane Capítulo I \"Você é generosa demais para zombar de mim. Se os seus sentimentos forem os mesmo de abril passado, diga-me logo. Os meus sentimentos e desejos não mudaram, mas diga-me uma palavra, e eu os silenciarei para sempre. \" Suspirei fundo ao escrever a frase de Sr. Darcy para Elizabeth. Cada gesto, cada palavra que colocava em minha história através do apaixonado cavalheiro me lembrava do meu. Tom Lefroy. Ele foi embora tão repentinamente de minha vida do que quando entrou, mas devo dizer que essas indas e vindas não causaram menos impacto em meus sentimentos. Ainda sinto um palpitar tão forte quando penso nele. Lembro-me de seus olhos azuis e da forma como olhavam para mim, fazendo-me sentir a pessoa mais especial desse mundo. Lembro-me também desses mesmos olhos ao dizer adeus, da tristeza em que estavam quando nos despedimos. Sentia falta do toque deles, que, mesmo sem nenhum contato físico, digamos assim, parecia que vasculhavam cada canto do meu corpo e de minha alma. Nunca nenhum olhar havia pousado sobre mim como os dele. Nunca havia causado tanto impacto, nunca havia feito tanto sentido como faz agora, que estou longe desse mesmo olhar. Suspiro fundo e me encosto-me à cadeira, massageando minha têmpora na tentativa de aliviar o choro que sentia que subiria em apenas alguns segundos se eu não o aplacasse. Nesse mesmo momento, ouço uma batida na porta, e quando dou a permissão para que a pessoa entre, vejo que é a empregada da casa, srta. Hill, se desculpando pela interrupção e alegando que o motivo era uma carta que havia chego para mim. _Pode deixar em cima da cômoda, vou lê-la depois. Sinto como se minha cabeça fosse explodir. _Tudo bem, srta. Austen, apenas espero que essa enxaqueca não a impeça de ler a carta, já que.. – sussurrou a última parte. – foi assinada por Thomas Lefroy. Na mesma hora, senti minha espinha gelar, e me levantei com tanta pressa que quase derrubei as folhas de papel de cima da mesinha. Por outro lado, meu corpo me lembrou que nessas horas mais importantes de aflição, alguma desgraça tem de acontecer. Não por isso. Ao me levantar senti um murro no meu dedo menor do pé, e quando olhei para baixo, percebi que o choro que estava anteriormente tentando conter, havia escapado na forma de uma solitária lágrima, e o cúmplice dessa lágrima fugitiva foi o maldito pé da cadeira. _Pode deixar Hill, já vou lê-la. Obrigada. –Respirei fundo e dei um gemido de dor. No entanto, essa batida repentina serviu para aliviar o suspense e o buraco imenso que alastrara meu peito assim que ouvi o nome de quem havia assinado a carta. Meio mancando, ainda corri para a cômoda e quando olhei para o envelope, reconheci a letra da pessoa que vem fixando-se em meus pensamentos pelos últimos tempos desde sua partida. Hampshire, 29 de abril de 1799 Querida Jane, Antes que tire alguma conclusão precipitada, gostaria que soubesse que não escrevo-lhe esta carta para que se martirize pelo que não aconteceu. Muito pelo contrário. Embora pareça um tanto inusitado e sem sentido enviar-lhe uma carta após causar-lhe tanto sofrimento, gostaria que a lesse até o final. E se em algum momento da leitura minhas palavras causarem-lhe desconforto, tristeza ou amargura, peço desculpas antecipadamente. Nunca me passou pela cabeça lhe magoar. Antes de mais nada, expresso meus cumprimentos e esperanças de que esteja bem, de que nem a sua boa aparência, seu bom humor, seu carisma ou alegria pela vida tenham sido afetados pela minha partida (isso pode soar-lhe um tanto quanto presunçoso, mas se eu bem lhe conheço, deve estar sorrindo desconcertada neste exato momento, por pensar da mesma forma que aleguei acima). Muito tempo se passou e você provavelmente deve estar casada, mas mesmo assim, existem algumas coisas das quais preciso lhe dizer, e o farei nesta carta. Eu sei que um outro deve estar presente em sua vida, ou deve falar em seu ouvido palavras de amor como eu falei, mas eu duvido que ele tenha tanto amor e até os erros do meu inglês ruim. E então, imediatamente você vai lembrar de mim. Eu espero que se lembre. Espero que eu não tenha sido um romance passageiro na sua vida, e talvez só tenha estas esperanças por não ser assim com você, já que eu ainda a tenho em meu coração. Antes que se zangue, peço desculpas, novamente. Desculpe-me pela intimidade com que lhe escrevo esta carta, mas esse é apenas mais um dos elementos que tento usar para tornar-lhe conhecidos os meus sentimentos. Eu não deixei de amar você. E, infelizmente, tenho a impressão de que não abandonarei esses sentimentos tão cedo. Não que amá-la seja algo ruim, mas piorou depois que tive de me casar com Mary, já que não era com ela que pretendia deitar-me todas as noites. Depois de algum tempo, aprendi a conviver com esses sentimentos e aprendi a reprimi-los, ficando apenas conformado com o que aconteceu e ver com bons olhos o que passamos. Mas digo que é desmoronando essas paredes que repreendem meu coração, que tenho a coragem, ousadia, e atrevimento em escrever-lhe esta carta. Acho que tudo isso ocorre por que os detalhes tão pequenos de nós dois, são simplesmente muito grandes para serem esquecidos, mesmo que as areias do tempo se deem ao trabalho de disfarça-los. Mas lembre-se: disfarçar é diferente de apagar. A vida é como um rio, que segue seu curso sem esperar que o acompanhemos, e algumas pessoas são como uma breve correnteza, passam pela nossa vida rapidamente, mas causam um impacto tão grande que têm o poder de deixar-nos às avessas. Porém, você não, Jane. Você é uma correnteza tão forte e certa, que acompanha o curso do meu rio e causa reviravoltas a todo o momento em meus sentimentos. Uma hora eu amo você, mas estou olhando para a minha esposa; em outra, a culpa por traí-la em pensamento é tão grande que sinto raiva de mim mesmo. Gosto e depois desgosto do curso que o meu rio tomou. Por que meu amor por você é uma correnteza tão fatal, Jane, que é impossível não se deixar afogar nela. E uma vez nesse meio, eu nunca mais quis sair. Não consegui sair. Não consegui abandonar as águas de seus lábios, mesmo que somente em minha memória. Por mais pervertido que isso possa parecer-lhe, meu maior arrependimento foi não tê-la feito minha, em todos os sentidos. Ás vezes me pego acordado no meio da madrugada com um copo de Whisky em mãos, em pé ao lado da lareira, imaginando como teria sido se tivéssemos feito amor. Como teria sido tocar-lhe e mostrar-lhe o quanto eu te amo. Porém, em um lapso, lembro-me que eu tenho uma esposa deitada em minha cama, com quem devo estar todo o tempo. Com um misto de sentimentos, volto para a minha cama e faço com ela tão ardentemente o que gostaria de fazer com você. Então, Jane, espero que saiba, que nessas noites, nunca serei inteiramente dela, na verdade, nunca serei, em sentido algum. Pois a cada beijo dado, é o seu gosto que sinto, a cada toque dela, é como se recebesse o seu. Cada movimento dado por ela, eu imagino que é você. Quando olho nos olhos dela, é o seu reflexo que eu vejo. Cada hora que passo junto dela nunca será melhor do que todos os minutos ao seu lado. Como você sabe, mas faço questão em reafirmar, eu só me casei por obrigação. Enquanto eu passo o dia com outra, saiba, é com você que eu queria estar. Hoje e sempre, meus pensamentos serão seus, tudo que é meu, sempre será seu. Minha vida, minha alma e meu coração. Ou melhor, nossa vida, nossa alma, e um único coração. Somos um. Dessas noites de amor com você em pensamento, nasceu uma linda menina, a qual tive a ousadia de chamar de Jane Christimas Lefroy. Talvez tenha batizado-a de tal forma por amá-la demais, assim como eu amo você, e até mesmo para fazer com que eu me sinta menos cafajeste por faze-la sofrer. Outra hipótese é de chama-la assim para que você nunca saia da minha vida, de uma forma mais concreta. Para que eu possa falar \"Jane\" em voz alta pela casa. Para que eu possa dizer seu nome com o mesmo amor à ela sem me sentir culpado. Minha querida, Jane, dou a você liberdade de escolher uma hipótese entre as citadas acima, já que todas são teorias verdadeiras. Se houvesse outra maneira, eu escolheria você sem hesitar, mas não há. Gostaria que soubesse e nunca se esquecesse: eu amo você. Segui em frente por que o rio não para, mas, enquanto minha esposa é somente um gigantesco meandro, você é a correnteza inteira, que me afasta dela e depois, a traz de volta para mim. Como o rio sinuoso que minha vida se tornou. Escrevi essa carta para imaginar sua reação ao lê-la, e para despejar diante de você, uma última vez, todos os meus sentimentos. Agora que já os exprimi, voltarei a reprimi-los. Pelo menos até o momento em que você responda a esta carta como uma última e singela forma de dizer Adeus. Por que você sempre sabe o que dizer. Do seu, Lefroy. E entaaaooo? O que acharam? Espero que tenha conseguido fazer algumas pessoas se emocionarem, ou mesmo que tenha conseguido expressar devidamente os sentimentos do Lefroy, algo que eu adoraria ver no filme. Massss como não foram gravadas cenas mais cutes e com mais opinião dos dois amantes, frustrada, resolvi eu mesma escrever. Espero do fundo do coração que tenham gostado. O próximo capitulo não demorará muito para sair, já que a carta da Jane está praticamente pronta. Antes que eu me esqueça, capítulo dedicado ao Roberto Carlos (embora muito obviamente ele nunca verá isso) por que não sei se alguém percebeu, mas tem um pequeno fragmento da música detalhes ali. Ouvi ela no mínimo umas 20 vezes essa semana. É liiiiiiiinnnndaaa! Capítulo dedicado às pessoas que leram até aqui, que deixaram reviews nas outras fanfics, e quem quiser deixar aqui também, muito obrigada. Heleninha, esse capítulo também é dedicado a você, por que veio sendo uma amiga muito presente e muito boa pra mim. Beijos a todos, e obrigada pela leitura. Maíra :)[Chapter 2] Oiiii genteee tudoo bemm? Espero que sim, por que o mundo é belo, as minhas notas ainda são boas, eu ainda sou feliz, e o sol ainda brilha. Estou numa tremenda felicidade contagiante por acabar de assistir ao filme Across the Universe, um musical com músicas dos Beatles e meu Deus, eu só passei a adorar ainda mais essa banda... DEFINITIVAMENTE DIVOS. Bom, aqui está a segunda parte da fic, espero que gostem, foi de coração. Boa leitura, nos vemos lá em baixo... Assim que terminei de ler a carta, me dei a atenção de relê-la mais duas vezes, tamanha a minha indignação. Era como se um buraco em meu peito fosse preenchido, mas ao mesmo tempo o vazio continuasse. Gostaria de tê-lo ali comigo para responder, em voz alta, a sua carta. Quase sempre, ao contrário do que muitos pensam, as palavras tem mais significado quando ditas, com a devida entonação, do que quando escritas. E esse era um dos momentos em que eu queria dizer-lhe tudo o que sentia, e não escrever-lhe. Porém, como não havia outra alternativa, contentei-me em escrever-lhe de volta, tanto para dizer-lhe tudo o que sentia antes de seguir em frente, quanto para expressar um ultimo adeus. Sentei-me com muita calma, peguei a pena e o tinteiro, algumas folhas de papel, e comecei a escrever minhas ultimas sentenças, antes que o adeus final seja dito. Minha letra não saiu como o esperado, mas esse era somente mais um fator para que Lefroy notasse o meu nervosismo e espanto ao receber sua carta. Steventon, 29 de abril de 1799 Querido Lefroy, Não costumo escrever muito sobre os meus sentimentos de forma direta, sem me esconder atrás do amor de meus personagens, mas, farei este esforço por você; Assim como tenho feito tantas outras coisas por você, desde que nos conhecemos, e assim como fez por mim arriscando seu casamento ao me enviar aquela carta. Tudo o que estava escrito nela me fez chorar, por ser verdade, e sorrir, por saber que você se sente como eu, tem os mesmos arrependimentos que os meus, e pensa numa realidade diferente, como eu. Aliás, tudo isso faz o maior sentido, já que você estava completamente certo quando disse que somos um. Essa frase me parece tão perfeita e justa, que irei escrevê-la novamente, para que você nunca se esqueça disso. Somos um. Estivemos tão perto da felicidade plena, mas a sacrificamos por algo mais nobre: pela família. Em contradição, não existe nada mais nobre do que o amor, e foi por isso que desisti de nós. Por amá-lo, por que não suportaria a ideia de dormir com você numa cama grande e quente, enquanto a sua família, os que tanto te amam e têm expectativas sobre você, dormiriam em camas pequenas e frias, passariam mais fome, e sentiriam como se fossem esquecidos de Deus, ou pior, do próprio filho. Toda mulher solteira da minha idade fica sentada esperando que um príncipe encantado com um cavalo branco passe em sua frente, um homem que a faça feliz e que a ame incondicionalmente. Devo dizer-lhe, que graças a você, não preciso mais esperar meu cavaleiro encantado, por que você foi, e sempre será ele. Ao contrário do que você imaginava, recusei casar-me com o Sr. Wisley, e assim será com os próximos candidatos que apareçam em minha vida, a princípio. Nunca aceitarei nenhuma proposta, por que nenhum deles é você. Mas, por favor, não pense que o que foi dito acima seja uma indireta, por que você realmente tem suas obrigações com seu tio, e eu, felizmente, não as tenho com ninguém. Por isso, posso manter-me intacta, com esse voto de fidelidade, e com as palavras que ainda irei dizer nesta carta. Sabe Lefroy, meu coração partiu-se em pedaços quando entrei naquela carruagem, sem devidas despedidas, sem um último beijo, um último toque, com direito apenas de um último olhar, e tenho que admitir, a presença deste vem assombrando meus sonhos todas as noites, quando encosto minha cabeça no travesseiro e penso em tudo, inclusive em você. Há algo em seus olhos azuis que me persegue toda vez que fecho os meus. Eu tentei escapar deles mantendo-me acordada por noites seguidas, tentando afastar você da minha mente, mas infelizmente não consigo tirar você do meu pensamento. Eu ainda tenho seu rosto pintado em meu coração, rabiscado em minha alma, gravado em minha memória, e eu ainda sinto seus lábios queimando sobre os meus, o toque dos seus dedos, tão profundamente guardados em mim. Por um lado, é reconfortante saber que não sou a única a se sentir assim, por outro, o sentimento é devastador, como se a saudade me engolisse a cada segundo. Descobri, por fim, um jeito de amenizar esses sentimentos, e como você deve saber, é escrevendo. Comecei a escrever um livro que a princípio se chama \"Primeiras Impressões\", e admito que o personagem principal, o , foi inspirado em você. Desejo tornar-lhe consciente o fato de que todos os personagens principais das histórias que ainda irei escrever terão um toque \"Lefroy\", em algum aspecto, seja no jeito arrogante, presunçoso, e bem aparentado; seja nos olhos azuis, na lealdade, no carisma, na honra ou no amor que tenho por você. Impressiono-me como existe uma só palavra para definir tantas coisas, e ao mesmo tempo como existem tantas palavras e mesmo assim, sentimentos indefiníveis. O que passamos se encaixa no segundo caso, com certeza, afinal de contas, mesmo escrevendo tanto, não sei se consegui tornar compreensível tamanha a minha felicidade em saber que você continuou sua vida, por que somente assim conseguirei, talvez não de imediato, libertar-me do meu arrependimento. Você, como cavaleiro encantado, libertou-me dos sentimentos que eu sentia antes, e me deixou imensamente aliviada. E, antes que eu me esqueça, muito obrigada pela homenagem quanto ao nome de sua filha. Espero somente que você não faça diferença dela com as outras que ainda estarão por vir, justamente pela história que o nome dessa menina resguarda. Que ela seja eternamente abençoada, e mesmo não a conhecendo, sei das índoles de sua esposa e sei que era fará um bom trabalho com seus filhos. Antes de receber a sua carta, tenho que admitir, passava horas me torturando com imaginações de como seria seu pedido de casamento à sua esposa. Imagino-o beijando-a e dizendo que a ama, dizendo a ela exatamente as mesmas coisas que você disse a mim. Agora, após seu desabafo, me sinto confortável em saber que você não me esqueceu, e que, felizmente, mesmo com tanto amor destinado à mim em seu coração, que você não parou sua vida. Que, assim como suas esperanças ditas no primeiro parágrafo do que me escreveu, eu não mudei, e sei agora também que você não mudou. Isso me conforta tanto que chego a ficar feliz, por que agora meu ego se diz satisfeito em saber que, pelo que disse em sua carta, embora todos os \"eu te amo\" que você venha dizer a ela, sei que nenhum será igual ao que disse para mim, embora não seja, de certa forma, mentiroso, quando ditos à sua esposa. Nunca me esquecerei do que passamos juntos, e prova disso são os personagens que escrevo pensando em você. Daria tudo para reviver aquela despedida na estalagem, e fazer tudo diferente. Infelizmente, eu novamente me oporia à fuga, mas em compensação, teria lhe dado um último beijo, um último abraço, quem sabe até teria me feito sua, já que essa é, muito provavelmente, a última vez em que nos encontramos. Porém, dentre todos os itens que disse que teria feito em nossa despedida, há outro, não citado, que teria feito sem a menor dúvida. Eu teria olhado em seus olhos azuis uma última vez, e dito, do fundo do coração, que eu amo você. Teria dito que, mesmo pelas circunstancias do destino, mesmo que o tempo passe, mesmo que o mundo acabe; aquilo que sentimos um pelo outro não diminuirá, mas por outro lado, também não aumentará. Se manterá sólido, assim, se tornará eterno. E é com muito orgulho que termino esta carta com um símbolo. Símbolo do nosso amor, símbolo da nossa história, símbolo de nós. Por que nosso amor é eterno. Por que nós somos o infinito. Da sempre sua, Jane Austen Lefroy. Fimmmm genteee! NOTA URGENTE: era para aparecer o símbolo do infinito maroto ali em baixo, antes da Jane assinar a carta, mas como nao apareceu e eu nao tive coragem de mudar o final, por que gostem, utilizem da sua bela imaginação para imaginar um símbolo do infinito ali. *thank you very much.* E aí... O que acharam da minha fic? Ela é curta, embora, seja uma das mais sentimentais e profundas que já escrevi. Estou publicando-a em comemoração ao término de minha leitura do livro Orgulho e Preconceito, que, tenho que admitir, demorou bastante, mas não por desinteresse, e sim, por medo. Não queria que a história acabasse, por que não aguentaria um final na história de Jane Austen. Porém, com muita relutância, terminei o livro e escrevi o último capítulo, que, como alguns podem ver, foi inspirado na música Painted on my heart, da banda The Cult, que é maravilinda, e o final foi inspirado no filme as vantagens de ser invisível. Justamente por aquela dedicação final, das vantagens de ser invisível, eu dedico esse capítulo à minha melhor amiga, há 13 anos, Marina, por simplesmente tudo que ela faz por mim, e nesse caso, pela cultura pessoal que ela me traz quanto ao seu amor pelo Logan Lerman. Já disse querida, nossos maridos estão em Hollywood, só falta a gente ir lá buscar.. ahushauhsuas Capítulo dedicado também aos leitores da fic, e a todos que gostaram dela, em geral.

Bueno el personaje no es mio ni tampoco lo son los lugares y demás personajes mencionados en la historia, por eso es un fanfiction y obviamente no busco lucrar. \"Yo era el invierno de mi vida y el hombre que conocí a lo largo del camino era mi única verano\" Por cuarta vez en esa noche, el viento lo había despertado, separando el fino dosel de algodón de su cama se sentó en el borde de la misma, la habitación tenia un gusto fúnebre, lóbrego y nostálgico, el aire era pesado y la única entrada de claridad en su habitación era la escasa luz de luna que las pesadas cortinas dejaban entrever, decidió que no iba a ser posible volver a conciliar el sueño así que simplemente se sentó en la rígida silla que se encontraba al lado de su cama, encendió las velas de un candelabro en la encimera y se dedico a reposar su mente y dejar que su vista vagara libremente por la habitación. Trato de recordar como era que había terminado así, solo, en una gran mansión llena de nada, censurado por las paredes y por sus propios pensamientos dolorosos y amargos, había tomado la despreciable costumbre de repeler toda clase de felicidad que le fuera facilitada, cuando había un maravilloso y soleado día, se encargaba de que Mrs. Fairfax ordenara tapar las ventanas de su habitación, único lugar que se había dedicado a habitar desde que le fueron liberados los cerrojos de su única atadura, su demonio personal había muerto, Bertha Antoinetta había sido escoltada por la muerte a un lugar que él deseaba conocer pronto, no por la tristeza de haber perdido a su esposa, en absoluto, simplemente no encontraba gusto alguno en continuar con su vida vacía y monótona, el único lucero en el tortuoso camino de su vida era Adele, su protegida. Y ni siquiera ella le prestaba tanta atención y lo evitaba, anticipándose a su mal humor y a su constante borrachera. Una tenue y nublada luz de sol comenzó a asomar por entre la cortina en el momento en que volvió en sí, no sabía si había dormido o si simplemente el rumbo de sus pensamientos acelero el tiempo, se levanto y asomo por la puerta, llamo a Mrs. Fairfax y le ordeno que preparara la ducha, 15 minutos después se encontraba en el baño desnudo frente a un gran espejo de cristal, se notaba más delgado y demacrado, las pequeñas pero presentes cicatrices de quemaduras en la parte inferior de su torso eran su recordatorio de lo sucedido aquella fatídica noche. Se metió en la tina y comenzó a beber el whiskey de su taza al lado de la tina, sintiendo como el agua tibia y el whiskey embotaban sus pensamientos, se preguntó a que hora llegaría el abogado enviado del señor Langlois. Bajo al comedor casi completamente borracho, la señora Fairfax solo le dedico una mirada recelosa mientras le servía un lujoso desayuno, Edward notó que Adele se empeñaba en pasar desapercibida en el comedor, como si esperara que él estuviera suficientemente borracho como para no darse cuenta de su presencia o lo suficientemente sobrio como para ignorarla como usualmente hacía, fue entonces que Edward empezó a entender que la niña pensaba que él era desagradable, y eso le dolió, por mucho que no lo demostrara, la quería, solo no se sentía listo como para demostrarle nada a nadie. Cuando casi hubo terminado de remover su comida con el tenedor, apenas había probado bocado y vio a la señora Fairfax acercándose a el. - Ha llegado el señor Lefroy, ¿le hago pasar a la sala?- - Me gustaría atenderlo en mi despacho.- Dijo Edward de un modo casi ininteligible debido a su borrachera. - Como desee.- Y la señora Fairfax desapareció por lo puerta del comedor. Como pudo se levanto del comedor y se tambaleo hasta la puerta de su despacho, inspiro fuertemente, decidido a hacer lo que correspondía, y abrió la puerta. Dentro de la iluminada habitación, con finos muebles decorativos y un gran escritorio de roble tallado a mano, además de numerosos libros con encuadernaciones de piel, se encontraba un hombre más bajo que él, cabello oscuro, espaldas amplias y un porte estudiadamente elegante, no podía verle la cara ya que estaba de espaldas, aún así pudo adivinar un rostro joven, tal vez unos 5 años menor que el. El joven al escuchar que se abría la puerta del despacho volteo de frente a él, y en su embriaguez solo pudo pensar que además de joven era \"atractivo\", con esos carnosos labios rojos, esos preciosos ojos de un azul tan claro que le recordaba al cielo en uno de esos maravillosos días sin nubes, sus facciones delicadamente masculinas, y la manera en que su cabello rebelde le envolvía como un aura. Desecho el pensamiento de inmediato y se adelanto a saludarlo. - Bueno días señor Lefroy, como ha estado el viaj...- Se tropezó con su propio pie y solo pudo ver como el suelo se acercaba vertiginosamente a su cuerpo, azotándolo contra el, solo pudo ver la alarma en el semblante del señor Lefroy antes de quedarse dormido. Cuando despertó se encontraba en su habitación, con el hedor de una embriaguez pasada, recordó como era que había llegado a ese punto, y sintió una punzada de la más fría vergüenza al recordar la cara de Mr. Lefroy al verlo caer precipitadamente al linóleo de su despacho, reflexiono en que fue muy imprudente haber bebido hasta tal punto. Afuera el sol se estaba poniendo, lo que quería decir que había dormido casi todo el día, tenia un dolor de cabeza que se sentía como si algo hubiera explotado en esta y en lugar de cerebro hubiera un yunque de hierro solido, salió de su habitación y llamo a la señora Fairfax. - Se ha ido, se va a hospedar en la posada del pueblo, ha dicho que vendría mañana a primera hora, esperando verlo mejorado. -¿Le has propuesto que durmiera aquí? - Naturalmente, pero se ha negado tanto que termine por dejarlo ir, ¿hice bien? Rochester no respondió a la pregunta de Mrs. Fairfax, aún habiendo dormido todo el día se sentía abatido, y adolorido, hasta que estuvo de nuevo desnudo en el espejo, se fijo en el pequeño hematoma que había en su brazo y encontró la explicación de por que le dolía la cara, tenia una pequeña parte rojiza en su pómulo. Mientras el agua caliente abría sus poros, pensó en que le hubiera gustado mucho haber conocido al señor Lefroy ese día. Recordó sus facciones, su marcado porte y pensó que ese hombre era decididamente afable. ... Sentado en su alcoba de esa fría y vieja posada, con una taza de té calentándole la cara, Mr. Lefroy se encontraba escribiéndole una carta a su tío, el señor Langlois, acerca de su llegada a Thornfield House, decidió dejar de lado escribir acerca de la pobre impresión que le había dejado el señor Rochester, y se dedico a escribir como había sido el viaje y a prometerle a su tío que arreglaría el asunto con el señor Rochester rápidamente, y la verdad es que deseaba volver de inmediato a Londres. Le gustaba el campo, poder respirar aire puro y sin hedor, poder ver los campos que con el atardecer se tornaban color ámbar oscuro, la gentileza de la gente, pero pensó que arreglar el asunto del testamento del señor Rochester no iba a ser una tarea delicada ni satisfactoria, por lo que sabía, Mr. Rochester había enviudado hacia un par de meses, era déspota, grosero, arrogante y ahora después de lo sucedido en la tarde, pensaba que también era alcohólico. Simplemente no podía entender por que su tío no había enmendado aquella tediosa tarea a otro abogado, el ya tenía demasiado trabajo en Londres como para además encargarse del testamento de un alcohólico que no podía ni sostenerse por su propio pie. Recostado en la silla de su alcoba, sin poder dejar de pensar en la pesada voz inundada de whiskey de aquel señor, pensó que Mr. Rochester era decididamente desagradable.[Chapter 2] Perdón por tardar en publicar, iba a publicar el sábado pero si no era una cosa era otra, en fin muchas gracias por leer y muchas gracias a Elii por el lindo review. Recuerden que los personajes no son míos, ni los lugares, ni las puertas desvencijadas ni las miradas frías, ¡disfrútenlo! Se encontraba camino a Thornfield House, como había prometido a Mrs. Fairfax, a primera hora de la mañana, solo había encargado que entregaran su carta, había tomado un baño y había emprendido su camino a la gran mansión en un coche rentado en la posada. Iba lleno de renovadas energías y con la esperanza de que no se repitiera lo ocurrido la mañana anterior, deseaba terminar con todo esto lo antes posible. Mrs. Fairfax. aguardaba por él, así que simplemente lo guio por el mismo recorrido que habían emprendido al lujoso despacho de Mr. Rochester, Mrs. Fairfax abandonó la habitación y lo dejo ahí, solo, justo como la mañana anterior, casi esperaba ver entrar a Mr. Rochester ahogado de borracho y tropezarse al preguntarle por el viaje, pero cuando escucho un ruido a sus espaldas y giro su cabeza, vio a un Mr. Rochester que no se tambaleaba, que no lucía desmejorado, que no parecía haber bebido una gota de alcohol en absoluto, incluso parecía rodeado de una extraña aura de felicidad que parecía extravagante. Mr. Rochester le ofreció una sonrisa que a Lefroy le pareció extraña en esa cara, no como si fuera forzada, más bien como si no estuviera acostumbrado a hacerlo muy seguido y parecía un poco antinatural la manera en la que exhibía todos los dientes. Trato de responder con una sonrisa que no dejaba de parecer fingida y espero que Mr. Rochester no lo notara, aunque probablemente lo hizo ya que su sonrisa fue remplazada por lo que parecía ser su expresión habitual, se adelantó y le ofreció la mano. -Bueno días señor Lefroy- tomo su mano y la sacudió- ¿como se encuentra usted? -Bien, gracias. - Hubo un pequeño silencio en el que Lefroy no supo que decir.- Usted se nota mucho mejor que el día de ayer ¿como se encuentra? Pensó que la vergüenza que había cruzado el semblante de Mr. Rochester era pura imaginación suya. - Oh si, ya estoy mucho mejor.- Parecía que se debatía en decir algo o no.- Quería disculparme con usted por haber estado tan indispuesto, y que usted tuviera que perder un día de su valiosísimo tiempo. -No se preocupe.- Fue lo único que dijo, y el silencio que siguió le pareció lo más incomodo de aquel viaje, le parecía agradable que el hombre no hiciera como si nada hubiera pasado, y también le alegraba no haber visto aún al hombre al que la mayoría veía, al grosero y altivo ricachón. -Por favor, tome asiento.- Dijo Rochester mientras se situaba en su lugar detrás del escritorio. -Gracias.- Pensó que sobrio no le pareció tan repulsivo, incluso estaba siendo educado. Pero su mente le hizo desechar el pensamiento imponiéndole el recuerdo de un Rochester apestando a licor. Después de eso se dedicaron enteramente a redactar el testamento de Mr. Rochester, y Lefroy pensó que la cantidad de libras que el hombre manejaba era ridícula, le irritaba la manera desenfadada en la que se refería a su dinero, como si no fuera nada. Acordó dejar el 50% de todo a Adele, un 30% a un afortunado en una carta que deseaba que fuera abierta el día de su muerte, un 10% a la Iglesia aunque no tenía ni pizca de creyente y el 10% restante lo dejo repartido por el servicio de la mansión. Se dijo para sus adentros que el señor tenía una vida de lo más triste, repartiendo su riqueza entre la iglesia y el servicio, sin esposa, ni hijos. Sin nadie. Pensó además que esto no podía ser fruto de una serie de eventos desafortunados, sino que era culpa del propio señor, aunque no conocía su pasado podía adivinar algo muy oscuro y escabroso, y le parecía muy misteriosa la muerte de su esposa. -Sé que no le agrado.- Dijo Rochester con monotonía en su voz y una seguridad implacable, y tomo completamente desprevenido a Thomas, quien de repente se encontró sin nada que decir.-Puedo notarlo en sus maneras hacía mi persona y puedo decirle con toda la seguridad con la que puedo contar que no podría importarme menos, usted solo viene a cumplir aquí con una labor, así que siéntase libre de pensar lo que desee. Lefroy noto como se le subían los colores a la cara, pero mantuvo una expresión irrompible, afilo su voz y se repuso lo suficiente para contestar. -Tenga por seguro que así será, pierda usted cuidado.- Podía sentir como un entrañable desprecio se iniciaba en su vientre, se sentía mareado. -Es usted libre de irse, puede hospedarse aquí si lo desea, ya he ordenado que limpien y acondicionen la casa de huéspedes. No podía creer que le estuviera ofreciendo tal cosa, sin ofrecer ninguna respuesta se levanto de su silla, miro a los fríos ojos de aquel hombre, dio la media vuelta y salió por la puerta hecha una furia cuando se encontró con Mrs. Fairfax. -Mr. Lefroy, ya está lista la casa de huéspedes. Lefroy estaba a punto de decir que no, que no se hubiera molestado, por que no pensaba pasar mucho tiempo ahí, con ese ser despreciable, que no quería siquiera ser el objeto de una mirada casual por parte del señor, que ni siquiera quería que existiera el vinculo de trabajo que ahora los ligaba, pero después pensó en que su tío no lo había dotado de mucho dinero, en que la posada era fría y desagradable y en el trayecto en coche que debería recorrer cada mañana para llegar a Thronfield House, pero también pensó en que al menos quedándose ahí podría, al menos en una pequeñísima medida, indemnizar el mal trato que pudiera llegar a experimentar en la semana siguiente en que le tomara arreglar los documentos, así que simplemente asintió con la cabeza y dijo. -¿Podría usted llevarme a mi habitación? Me encuentro cansado. La señora lo condujo por un pasillo largo a la izquierda de la salida del despacho, el pasillo dirigía a otra sala pobremente iluminada que daba a un gran jardín y ahí podía verse la casa de huéspedes, era una construcción en piedra, pudo adivinar que era muy vieja ya que las puertas y ventanas estaban un poco desvencijadas, entro por la puerta seguido de Mrs. Fairfax que una vez cruzado el umbral de la habitación destinada para él, lo dejo solo. Con el orgullo aplastado como por un ariete, se sentó al borde de su cama y puso su cabeza entre sus manos, sintiéndose humillado de que sus posibilidades económicas le impidieran quedarse en un lugar lejos de aquel desagradable señor, pensó que de ser una persona solvente económicamente, ni siquiera tendría que estar en ese lugar, en esa situación, en la que si decidía independizarse de su tío, su familia lo pagaría con hambre. Por momentos la vida le desagradaba tanto o más que lo que le desagradaba Mr. Rochester. ... Edward miraba curioso por su ventana la manera en que Lefroy tomaba su equipaje del coche de la posada, horas atrás Mrs. Fairfax había mandado a un sirviente en caballo para pagar la deuda del señor Lefroy en ese lugar -cosa que pareció molestar al señor Lefroy- y para que mandaran traer su equipaje, casi eran las 6 de la tarde, hora de la cena, así que Mrs Fairfax le llevo su comida a su habitación ya que últimamente solo el desayuno lo tomaba en el comedor. - Hoy voy a cenar en el comedor.- Le dijo cuando la señora atravesó la puerta con una bandeja en manos. -Entonces irá usted a cenar solo, el señor Lefroy ha pedido que le llevemos la cena a su habitación. -Siempre ceno solo, pero hoy no me siento con ánimos de soledad, dígale que vaya a cenar al comedor, y también avísele a Adele que quiero verla ahí. La señora simplemente se dio la vuelta y salió de la habitación, dejando a Rochester solo con sus pensamientos, Por razones que no terminaba de entender, el otro señor parecía empezar a odiarlo, y pensaba que lo único terrible que le había visto hacer era caerse de borracho, no era algo que le provocara orgullo, al contrario, le hacía saborear una intensa cólera hacía él mismo, pero no le parecía motivo suficiente para un desprecio tan agudo. Le sorprendió sobremanera que decidiera, después de lo que le dijo en el despacho, hospedarse ahí. Después reflexiono que debía ser por falta de fondos y por eso decidió pagar su deuda de la posada, haciéndolo molestar aún más. No entendía ni un poco de la situación, pero no dejaba de parecerle fascinante. Al llegar al comedor Adele estaba en el lugar de siempre -1 silla alejado de él-, y frente a ella estaba Lefroy, la opresión que se sentía en el aire era tangible, podía sentir la mirada tímida de Adele y la ausencia de la mirada de Lefroy que era notorio evitaba mirarlo directamente y se dedicaba a mirar su taza de té, con la espalda recta y las manos crispadas. Se limito a sentarse en el comedor, no sabia como empezar en ese tipo de situaciones, así que simplemente, como un acuerdo implícito se dedicaron a comer sin articular palabra, y Rochester no podía evitar dirigir pequeñas miradas furtivas a Lefroy, y observar la manera en la que comía. Como su porte elegante e intrincado eran sus modales en la mesa, impecables. La institutriz de Adele debía estar realizando un buen trabajo ya que la niña también se esmeraba en recordar sus modales, le puso triste el hecho de que nunca parecía interesarse por las actividades en la vida de Adele, así que decidió romper el silencio. -Adele.- La llamo y le pareció escuchar un poco de vacilación en su propia voz y también un poco de pesadez en la mirada de la niña, como si esperará un regaño.- ¿Como te va con Miss Eyre? -Bien, gracias.- Y la niña no dijo nada más. -Me alegro.- Aunque no se alegraba en absoluto, ahora estando sobrio, se daba cuenta de lo dañada que estaba su relación con Adele, al punto de poder parecer apenas conocidos. Notó como Lefroy se removía incómodo en su asiento. -Adele, éste es el señor Lefroy, va a estar con nosotros una breve... -Brevísima- Corrigió el ojiazul con mordacidad. -... Brevísima temporada acompañándonos. -Es un placer señor Lefroy, espero disfrute su estancia aquí.- A Rochester le pareció sorprendente la manera en la que la niña se dirigía a sus mayores, como si ella también fuera mayor, no había ni pizca de vacilación en el tono de su voz y había montones de sincera bienvenida. Lefroy debió haberlo notado también ya que le vio esbozar la única sonrisa honesta que le había visto a ese peculiarmente atractivo rostro y cuando lo hizo Rochester quedo impactado por la calidez de su sonrisa. Se sorprendió aun más cuando sintió la tensión también en su rostro. Una tensión muy parecida a una sonrisa. -El placer es mío Adele.- Lefroy volteo para mirar a Rochester y en cuanto sus miradas se cruzaron su sonrisa se apagó, o al menos eso le pareció haber visto. De ese momento en adelante los tres se dedicaron a comer en silencio, pero en la cabeza de Rochester no había ni un ápice de silencio. No podía dejar de recordar el calor que sintió por toda la cara cuando Lefroy sonrió y entonces su mente evocó el recuerdo de la sonrisa que le había ofrecido esta mañana, una mueca falsa e incomoda y pudo notar el contraste con la sonrisa que le había visto hacia unos minutos. No pudo dejar de pensar en que le gustaban las dos sonrisas, la falsa y la verdadera, una era cálida y deliciosa llena de un mundo de color intenso, la otra era fría, lóbrega y real, su mirada cuando estaba a punto de dejar el despacho era tan glacial que podía amainar el mas fuerte incendio. Y por alguna extraña razón le parecía excitante, ese contraste, lo sentía como descubrir un color nuevo, en ese momento supo que tenía que descubrir todos esos nuevos matices. Cuando hubieron terminado la cena, Adele se dirigió a toda prisa a su habitación, y el señor Lefroy se dirigió con paso apresurado a la casa de huéspedes, Edward lo alcanzó. -Señor Lefroy.- Lefroy volteó y el azul de sus ojos era puro hielo. -Debiera usted sonreír más.- En cuanto las palabras salieron de su boca se sintió la criatura más torpe del mundo. - Podría tomar esa observación también para usted. -Lo haré.- El señor Lefroy lo miro sin comprender, pero sin derretir el hielo en sus ojos, hizo un pequeño asentimiento con la cabeza y desapareció por la habitación adyacente.

There was no doubt in Jane'snmind that she had to go back home. Tom was forsaking his family fornher, and she could not allow that. At the next stop she would tellnhim… \"Jane,nare you well, my dearest?\" Tom'snvoice wrenched her heart. She tried to hide her emotions. \"I willnbe fine, Tom.\" Hendid not press her. What they were doing was unsettling for theirnreputations, but to be together, Tom knew it had to be done. He wouldnfind a way to make it work. Itnhad only been five minutes after the tires had gotten stuck in thenmud when the carriage suddenly came to a halt. Tom sat up from thenseat. \"We are not even halfway to the next stop.\" \"Arenwe stuck?\" Jane asked, looking at him. \"Indo not think so.\" Thendoor opened, slamming against the outside of the carriage. A beardednman in mud-caked clothing was standing there, a knife in hand. \"Getnout now!\" he snarled. Janengasped, her hands covering her mouth. Tom stared at the man fornseveral seconds, the events not registering yet. \"I said, get out!\"nthe man yelled, brandishing the knife higher. Tom'sneyes fell on the knife. He turned, grasping Jane's hand tightly. Hencould feel her shaking as he helped her from the carriage. They werenpushed to the side with the other men that were driving the carriage.nTom peered around taking note that they were outnumbered. Twelvenbandits stood against the five of them, all with some sort of weaponnin hand. Two of the bandits were atop the carriage rummaging throughnthe cargo. Assuredly, they would find all the money he tucked away innhis bag. Janenstared down at the leafy ground, her clutch on Tom's arm becomingntighter as her fear grew. He held onto her protectively, hoping thatnhis presence would ease her fear. But what happened next no one hadnsuspected. Onenof the bandits - a man in fine clothing that had been tattered fromntraveling – caught sight of Jane. He stared at her for a moment,nhis eyes mischievous. He sauntered over to her, looking her up andndown. Tom pulled her back instinctually, feeling the threat of thenman. \"Thenlady is of no interest to you\" Tom said, a slight shake in hisnvoice. Thenman never took his eyes off Jane. \"I believe she is. She'll fetchna good price.\" Thenblood drained from Tom's face, and Jane could feel her kneesnweaken. \"Sir, please\" pleaded Tom. \"She is to be my wife.\" \"That'sntoo bad\" the man sneered, reaching out to grab Jane. \"NO!\"nTom screamed. He pushed Jane behind him. The drivers of the carriagenmoved to help, but the rest of the bandits had jumped in, their bodynlanguage threatening them to step down. \"Take me instead.\" \"Tom!\"ngasped Jane. \"Inam the nephew of the chief judge in London. A mighty ransom will benpaid for my safety.\" He did not know if they'd believe him, butnhe had to try. Jane's life was at stack, and he'd do anything tonkeep her from harm. \"Please, sir, take me.\" Thenman glared at Tom for an agenizing moment. He then gestured to hisncomrades. \"We'll take them both!\" Tom'snface fell. He drew Jane closer to him, her body racked with sobs. \"Inwill protect you,\" he whispered into her hair. Thencarriage drivers stood helplessly as the bandits descended on theirnpassengers. The man with the knife, along with another bandit, laidnhands on Tom. The man in the tattered fine clothes, who appeared tonbe the leader, took hold of Jane. \"Tom!\"nscreamed Jane as they pried her away. Tom's hand slipped from hersnas they pulled them apart. Jane kicked and sobbed trying to get awaynas Tom was knocked to his knees, his hands roughly pulled behind hisnback. The bandits tied his hands then placed a blindfold over hisneyes. Thenleader clapped a hand over Jane's mouth, preventing her screamsnfrom being heard. The last sight she saw was of her dear Tom fallingnlifelessly to the ground.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: In which two lovers are torn apart His head ached as if it had been slammed into a wall. Tom wondered what he had drunk to cause such a throbbing. He slowly cracked his eyes open. The light in the room was dim thankfully, and seemed to be coming from a single window close to the ceiling. He blinked a few times trying to clear the blurriness from his vision. Her face was the first sight he saw, comforting the pain his head felt. Tom crooked an awry smile, finally realizing his head was pillowed in his lady's lap. Her chilled hand rested on his cheek. \"Tom, how are you?\" her voice, full of concern, cut through the thumping in his head. \"Can you sit up?\" His eyes shut tightly, and he rubbed them with the heels of his hands. Then it suddenly occurred to him: the carriage ride from Hampshire foiled by a band of kidnappers and thieves. He pleaded with them to take him for ransom, but the bandits insisted his betrothed be taken as well for ransom or selling or for their own pleasure. At least they were still together. As long as Jane was by his side, he could keep her safe. \"I will be fine, Jane\" Tom replied, attempting to sit up. \"A bit of a headache, but it shall pass.\" Tom peered around slowly to examine the surroundings. They were being held in a damp square room, seeming to be a small basement or cellar. A short wooden door stood to the left of them with a large, round pull in the middle. He knew the door had to be locked, but he would try it, Tom noted to himself, as soon as he regained his bearings. The floor was hard dirt covered by old straw. The round window close to the ceiling was covered by iron bars. \"This must be the bandits' hideaway.\" \"I'm afraid it is\" Jane replied. \"Oh Tom, what are we to do?\" Tom reached for her hand, planting a warm kiss on the back of her chilled palm. \"I do not know, but at least we are together.\" He gathered her to his side. Jane laid her head heavily against his shoulder, the exhaustion of the events weighing her down. \"Did you see where they have taken us?\" \"No. I was blindfolded after you were knocked out and manhandled back into the carriage. One man guarded me, not taking his grip off my forearm the entire journey. I fear his grip has left bruises.\" Tom flinched at the information, his blood boiling to the point of wanting to jump to his feet and slamming his fist into the stone wall. But losing his temper would not do any good, and he only pulled Jane closer against him as if his hold would shield her from any more pain. Jane nibbled her lip, settling her breath to continue. \"I lost track of time, seeming to fall into a daze when the carriage final halted and we were brought to this room. Only minutes ago I could hear two men speaking just outside the door, but only heard one pair of footfalls leave.\" Her eyes filled with tears. \"What if your uncle will not pay a ransom for both of us? I am so scared, Tom. What if we are separated and cannot find each other again?\" Tom loosened his hold, pulling Jane far enough to meet her eye. \"We will make it, Jane. If we are separated, I will walk through the pit of hades to find you. Whatever it takes, I will protect you.\" Suddenly, footfalls echoed through the area outside the door and both went quiet to listen. A lock rattled and the heavy door creaked open. Tom stood instantly, putting himself in front of Jane, headache forgotten, ready to fight. The guard was the first to appear in the doorway. He strolled in slobbishly and stepped aside as another man entered. He was the same man who branded a knife at them in the carriage. He grinned toothlessly at them. Behind the toothless bandit was a taller man, who had been assumed to be the leader of the band. An amused smirk crossed his face as he sauntered in. \"How are my guests?\" \"If you will release us, we'd be fine, sir\" Tom snapped, daggers in his eyes. \"That is not an option. Mr. Lefroy, is it?\" the man replied, and Tom realized he spoke with a French accent. It was quite muted, but still lingering in certain words. When Tom did not answer, he continued, \"I have one of my men off to London gathering information on your supposed relation to the chief justice.\" \"You will find I have not lied to you.\" The man stepped forward, dangerously. \"I trust you have not.\" \"What of my betrothed?\" \"Oh yes, I will see that your uncle know of the circumstances with your betrothed.\" Jane's hopes fell. Chief Justice Langhorn did not agree with his nephew's courting of such a women. When he becomes aware of their elopement, he may not pay the ransom for them. Or worse, save Tom but leave her to damnation in the hands of these thieves. \"For now I would like a word with your betrothed. Miss?\" Jane cleared the horrible lump in her throat. \"Miss Austen, and what are you called, sir?\" \"Monsieur Girard\" the man replied, extending his hand for her to accept. \"Come, Miss Austen.\" Jane's face turned instantly pale as the fear of them being separated materialized. \"Whatever you have to say, you can say it to the both of us\" Tom insisted, his stance daring but his voice desperate. Girard towered over Tom as he snarled, \"I will speak to her if I please. You're treading on deadly ground, Mr. Lefroy.\" Tom was not one to back away from a fight, and before he could rationally think, he had thrown a blow to Girard's face. The taller man blocked his fist, yanking Tom's arm behind his back and tossing him to the ground face first. Jane screamed, rushing to Tom's side but an arm wrapped around her middle and she was lifted into the air. The door clattered shut as she was carried, thrashing at her capture, from the cell. Her screams were echoed with Tom pleas through the hallway until she could hear him no more. ","Summary":" Prisoners Writer'snNote: This is my first \"Becoming Jane\" fanfic. I've wanted tonwrite one for a "},{"Movie":"Becoming Jane","Title":"Turn Back Time","Author":"AngelNatari","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11232570","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Just a warning for all those who thinks this story is about \"Becoming Jane\" well it really isn't. This is actually a story based off the TV movie \"Miss Austen Regrets\" and yes this is a time travel piece so if you don't want to read it I understand. Anyway on with the story. 2015 I will admit up front I am totally in love with Jane Austen's works. That time period seemed so simple to me though I am sure back then times weren't as easy as in the book. My name is Andria. I am a college student and an American in case anyone needed to know. Let me tell you right now this isn't your average story. I was a simple person really until I somehow travel back in time. I was driving home from one of my classes. I only lived ten minutes away. A really strong storm was starting and I thought I could make it home. I kept driving as fast as I could while still being within the speed limit when a freaking deer came out in front of me and I swerved my car out of the way and the minute I did that it was also struck by lightning. I woke up and found myself half in a river or some kind of stream and half on shore. I looked around and my car was no where in sight. I thought it was really odd. I mean how did I get thrown out of the car? I slowly pick myself up and start to look around. No of this seems familiar to me at all. I walk up the hill before me when I see a tall manor before me. I know this is cheesy but I guess I'm not in Kansas anymore. \"Hello? You there excuse me young man?\" I hear someone call out to me. I see a young woman and a man sitting together on a bench at first then they start coming my way. Wait did she just call me a man?! I stand still as she comes up and examines me. \"You are a woman!\" the woman exclaims. \"What was your first hint? My boobs?\" I ask her sarcastically. \"Oh I thought since the way you were dressed you were a man, and you do speak in odd tongue. Come back with me my aunt must meet you!\" the woman exclaims taking my arm and forcing me to come with her. I look at the man as he comes forward taking the lead. Well I can tell he has a stick up his butt. He paid little to no attention to me but I didn't care. We finally reached the house as the woman took me into the sitting room. \"Look aunt Jane I found a woman dressed as a man.\" the woman told her. The woman nearly spit out her tea. \"Oh my dear come let us get you in some fresh clothes.\" the woman says putting her tea down and also taking my arm and taking me away from the group. \"Now my dear what is your name?\" Jane asks me. \"I am Andria. I am not from here in any sense not even this country. What year is it?\" I ask her in return. \"1814.\" she tells me as she takes off my brown jacket. \"Oh my goodness, I am from 2015. Please tell me you believe me.\" I beg her. \"I have no other choice to but the people out there can not know. You are obviously from America so you are a friend visiting me from there. I will teach you what you need to know to survive. At least until you can go home.\" she tells me. \"Whenever that is.\" I tell her as she walks away from me to the cabinet. I take off my top and jeans when the door opens and there stands Mr. stuck up from earlier. \"Forgive me miss, I did not know Miss Austen brought you in here.\" he tells me covering his eyes. \"You are obviously a virgin.\" I think to myself and I pick up my shirt and hold it over me. The man turns and walks out closing the door behind him. Jane comes back and has quite a bit of cloth in her hand. \"Alright you will dress in this. I am sure it should fit someone as skinny as you.\" she says she starts dressing me. By the time we are done she takes me over to a mirror and see that she has dressed me in a light green dress and put my hair up. I can't believe this is really happening. I am with Jane Austen I feel faint but then I regain my composure. \"Now just follow my lead, you were playing a trick on my niece and that is what you will tell her if she asks.\" Jane says as we walk out of the room down the hall and back to where the group is. \"There we go much better I do appreciate the joke though my dear friends this is Andria Worthington from America I met her when she was a mere child and now she is here to visit me.\" Jane says as she lightly pushes me forward. \"Pleasure to meet you all.\" I say as I bow my head then see the only seat left is by the man who just saw me close to naked. I walk over and sit down beside him. I should know how to act. I have seen all the Jane Austen movies and read the books. I still felt odd literally all eyes were on me. \"It is a pleasure to see you out of those wet clothes.\" her niece says to me. \"You can call me Fanny if you wish. The man sitting beside you is Mr. Plumtree.\" A part of me kept saying GET ME OUTTA HERE! I sat there as the people conversed. I mean it was only Fanny, myself Jane and Mr. Plumtree but still it felt odd. Finally we went to eat in the dinning room and I swear that man knew not when to shut up and eat. No matter how much Jane tried to get him to eat he kept going on and on. I couldn't help but giggle a little. \"Something humorous Miss Worthington?\" he asks me in all seriousness. \"No of course not, seeing as you seem to have all the answers to any question I could possibly fathom.\" I tell him and see Jane give me a look. \"Please forgive me I did not mean to interrupt your speech.\" \"Yes, shall we eat now?\" Fanny asks as she started eating. Finally after the food was ate people went about the house, Jane went to write of course. I wish I knew which of her novels she was writing judging by the timeline it must be \"Emma\". I went outside and we unfortunately followed by the love birds. I decided to go and sit over by a bridge so I would be sparred the lovey dovey things. After just a few moments I heard someone start walking my way. It was still daylight out so I could tell it was Mr. Plumtree. Great he was all I needed. He walked pretty close until he noticed I was there and stopped. He bow slightly. \"May I join you?\" he asks me. \"I suppose so.\" I tell him patting the ground on earth beside me. He sat down and it seemed he had a lot on his mind and me being the very thoughtful person I am decided I could listen to it. \"Something bothering you Mr. Plumtree?\" I ask him curious. \"Fanny, it seems she is quite taken with me and I with her at times but I don't know.\" he tries to explain to me. \"She is young and still quite fickle not to offend you or anything but she is still trying to understand her own feelings just as I am sure you are as well.\" I tell him as I place my hand on his for comfort. He doesn't say anything but merely smiles at me. Ok that is a little more then a normal friendly smile He looks down at my hand and takes it in his. Oh great I forgot people don't comfort people that way here. Oh great now what am I going to do? \"You seem very kind Miss Worthington.\" he says as he kisses my hand. \"Thank you kindly Mr. Plumtree though I am afraid I must get going it seems the sun is about to set and I have some chores to finish.\" I tell him as I take my hand and start to stand up. \"May I see you tomorrow?\" he asks me. Really now he wants to be around me all because I touched hi hand?! Oh what do I say? \"Yes, I will see you tomorrow then.\" My lips reply before my brain can stop them. I start to walk back to the house when I sense him walking behind me. I stop and turn around to look at him. \"I wanted to walk you back, I hope that is well by you?\" he asks me. Oh no have I created a love sick puppy? I simply turn and run into the house and quickly run to the sitting room where Jane is writing she looks up at me confused. \"We have a big problem.\" I tell her. She stops writing and motions for me to sit down. I start to tell her what all has happened with the whole I touched his hand and now he won't go away thing. \"Oh my well you can't ignore him that is rude and improper. Fanny will be devastated.\" Jane says as Fanny walks in. \"I can't believe him! I thought he was going to propose.\" she says sobbing. I fall backwards and faint. Great he was going to ask her to marry him and I ruined all of that. I wake up to see Jane smiling at me. \"Am I dead?\" I ask her. \"No you are among the living. do not worry Fanny has already set her sights away from Mr. Plumtree you are in the clear with him now.\" she tells me helping me sit up. \"How long was I out for?\" I ask her \"Two days was how long you slept, scared poor Mr. Plumtree to death, he is out in the gardens now. I just now got him to leave you side.\" she tells me. \"I don't like him, he is stuck up and rude a real pain the butt if you ask me.\" I tell her as I look out the window. \"I can't be whatever you call it with him.\" \"It is called courting, he would have to ask your father first.\" Jane says as we both look out the window. \"That does not mean you cannot talk to him. Give him a chance this is a way to see how different men are here.\"[Chapter 2] The next morning I was awoken to crying, very loudly. I rose from my bed and went to the hall to see Fanny sitting on the ground crying. Really? Ugh it is too early for this. I walk over to her and plop down beside her. \"I do not understand this! He nearly proposed to me and now he says his heart has changed? How could all of that have happened in two days?\" She asks me sobbing. I turn my head to look at her. \"Fanny please, this is all over a boy? You are young very pretty woman. Any man would want you on their arm do not worry about the one who can not see past the end of their nose.\" I tell her trying to comfort her. \"He says his heart has found another, in such a short amount of time. How is that even possible?\" she asks me. Great I feel like I am playing twenty questions with her now. \"I know not my friend. Do not dwell on it though. Your aunt told me there is a ball tonight I am sure many men will want to dance with you there.\" I tell her as she perks up a little. \"Do you really believe that to be true?\" she asks wanting me to say yes. \"I do not have a doubt in my mind, go on now pick out a dress to wear and please let me sleep.\" I ask her as I retreat into my room and lay back on the bed. \"Was I really ever like her?\" A few hours later I am wide awake with a different dress on this time is a brown one. I don't know how to do their hair styles so I wonder out of my room to find Jane when I bump into none other then Mr. Plumtree. I really had hoped to avoid him today but it seems he is quite drawn to me. \"Miss Worthington, your hair is down just as it was the day I first saw you.\" he tells me being rather observant. \"I was just going to find Fanny or Miss Austen. In America we do not wear the same hair style and I usually leave my hair down.\" I tell him as I look for a way to get past him. \"You look very well.\" he compliments me. \"Thank you very much Mr. Plumtree. I am sorry I startled you when I fainted. Miss Austen informed me you never left my side. No one has ever been that kind to me.\" I tell him as he smiles at me. \"I was just making sure that if you awoke that your needs would be met.\" he says humbly. \"Are you attending the ball tonight?\" \"Yes, Miss Austen informed me of it just last night. Will you be attending as well?\" I ask him already knowing the answer. \"I am, I hope to have a dance with you there.\" he tells me. \"What of Fanny? I thought you and her and an attraction to one another?\" I ask him. \"It appears my heart has chosen another path.\" he says as he steps to the side allowing me to pass him. Jane stands at the end of the hall watching us as I walk up to her. \"Come, let us put your hair up my dear friend.\" Jane says as she takes me away. \"Very good conversation skills you have.\" \"I will be nice as you have asked me to. I will be so nice he can't stand me. Or I could-\" I start. \"Why not just be calm and allow him to be kind to you?\" she asks me. \"Alright, I will do just that.\" I tell her as she finishes putting my hair up and we walk into a room where the piano is. Out of the window I see Mr. Plumtree getting in a carriage and leaving. A part of me actually misses him but that is a very small part. I know I will see him at the ball very soon. \"I am ready dear aunt to go meet the man of my dreams.\" Fanny says with a giggle. I roll my eyes and look at Jane. \"You look wonderful dear niece. It appears you are correct we should start for town if we arrive at the ball early the more the dancing we shall have.\" Jane says leading us to the door. It took a little over two hours to get to the house that was hosting the ball. People began to flock in as the sun was barely just starting to set. It turns out this was Fanny's house. \"Perhaps here I can win Mr. Plumtree back from whoever it is.\" Fanny says walking inside. \"You are in the clear?\" I ask Jane. We all walk inside Jane and Fanny start dancing and I sit back and smile watching them dance. It look like they are having a very good time. As the dance ends I see Mr. Plumtree and Fanny walking my way but from different directions. This is not going to end well. Mr. Plumtree reaches me just as Fanny comes to my side. \"May I have this dance?\" Mr. Plumtree asks looking right at me. \"Of course you may.\" Fanny says taking his hand and starts to lead him to the dance floor but he looks back at me. I just smile at him as they begin to dance for the next seven songs. I begin to grow bored and decide to walk out of the room and to the gardens. It is beautiful outside and very peaceful compared to the ball inside. I guess I never really was a party type of person. I sit down on a bench and listen to the mixture of the sounds from both inside and out. I look at the window and can see Fanny and Mr. Plumtree dancing. Though it seems as if his eyes are searching for something or someone else. I still don't understand how something as small as a hand touch could make his heart change it's mind? I try to put the thought out of my mind. I look up to the stars for peace and do find it momentarily. Then I hear someone walking my way I look over and see a man who looks a bit tipsy to me. \"Ah what a lovely damsel!\" the man cries out as he walks closer. \"Get away from me or I will hurt you!\" I yell at him but it's no use. He finally reaches me and grabs my arm very tight. I know that is going to bruise my soft alabaster skin as they would say here. Gosh this guy is strong and heavy two things against me. Finally I am fed up with it. \"Get off me or I will break your nose!\" I yell at him at the top of my voice. The man just laughs and has the nerve to try and kiss me, my hands reacts fast and thrust forward breaking his nose and splattering his blood on my new white gown Jane had gotten me. The man does stumble off of me and I run inside to see Jane and Fanny still dancing. I look down at my dress and am clearly upset but I don't want to ruin their time. I look up one more time and see Mr. Plumtree looking my way with pure horror on his face. Oh no he is going to take this the wrong way. He is going to think I am the damsel in distress when I actually was the heroine. I see him release Fanny leaving her alone on the dance floor and he comes rushing my way taking me in his arms. \"Are you alright? Where did the blood come from?\" he asks me very quickly. \"I am fine, there was a man in the garden he forced himself on me but-\" I try to tell him as he walks past me to the garden. I watch inside as Jane comes and joins me we see Mr. Plumtree at first talk to the man for a few moment but then he punches him and the man falls to the ground again. \"You alright?\" Jane asks me. \"I was the one who broke that man's nose. He forced himself on me I had no choice.\" I tell her quickly as Mr. Plumtree comes back inside. \"Just let him play the hero, act like you are more than grateful.\" Jane says as Mr. Plumtree reaches me and takes my hands. \"Forgive me for not being there when you needed me most.\" he says looking me in the eyes. I felt something odd in my stomach then. Was this really butterflies in my stomach. Oh no was I starting to like him? \"Thank you for being here with me now, I fear I could not face the rest of the night alone.\" I tell him as he just smiles. \"Then you shall dance with me the rest of the night.\" he says offering me his hand. \"I don't know how to dance like that. I only know how I dance back home.\" I tell him as I look away from the ballroom. \"Do tell me how do you dance back home?\" he asks me. \"I would have to show you for I cannot explain it.\" I tell him as I hear a small giggle come out of me. \"Show me then.\" he says. I take his left hand and put it around my waist and take his other hand in mine and slowly dance a very simple dance. \"I like this dance, it is a simple one is it not?\" he asks me. \"That it is, it is usually a couples dance but it can be a friends dance as well.\" I tell him as we continue to dance. We go back into the ballroom as the clock strikes fifteen minutes after twelve. I sit down in a chair happy to rest as Fanny comes up to Mr. Plumtree. \"Where had you gone? You left me alone on the dance floor so now we must finish our dance.\" she says putting her arms behind her back and giggling. \"It is past midnight Fanny, it is the Lords day now.\" he tells her. \"You did not seem to mind when dancing with another woman. Who is she?\" Fanny asks him not a tad bit angry. \"That is not any of your concern please just rest a while.\" he tries to explain to her. I see this is going no where fast so I come up to them about to take Fanny away. \"I bet whoever she has must have more money then I for I know she is not prettier then me\" she says. I just stand in shock. Well she doesn't know that she is talking about me but still that hurt. I take her arm and walk her out of the ballroom. \"Fanny you are acting like a child who has had their candy taken away. No one will ever find that attractive!\" I tell her as she lowers her head. \"I am sorry it's just I really like him and I don't know how to tell him.\" she tells me. A wave of guilt hits me. It's my fault that she is unhappy. \"Fanny, there are plenty of men here are you to tell me the only one you like is Mr. Plumtree?\" I ask her. \"Well no, but he is the one I have known the longest.\" she says lifting her head up. \"Maybe it is time to expand your horizon try talking to new people and get to know them.\" I explain to her. \"Yes, I shall do just that. Please forgive me for behaving improperly.\" she says as she turns and walks away from me. I look back into the room and see her start talking with a group of people around her age. Mr. Plumtree comes to my side and smiles at me. \"I thought that you would not want me to tell her that you were the one who I have taken a liking to.\" he tells me. \"Thank you for that, though I fear she will still want you and that I have ruined her chances for a happy life.\" I tell him not looking away from the ballroom.[Chapter 3] I sit in the kitchen sampling grapes and talking to the kitchen staff. It was a normal day I suppose. Well as normal of a day it could be for someone like me being stuck in the past but there were parts that were nice. I look out the window and see Fanny talking with someone. At first I can't tell who it is until I hear yelling. It must be Mr. Plumtree. Fanny runs inside and throws her bonnet at me. I look up at her in shock. \"You! its you that he wants, the wild red head who appeared out of no where!\" Fanny yells at me. Jane looks at me and then goes to Fanny. \"How is that her fault? She did not do anything wrong no one did. The heart is a truly complicated thing and Fanny you have already taken up interest in two others please go and write them now.\" Jane tells Fanny. Fanny picks up her bonnet and walks off with a determined face. \"I think you had better go talk to the one who described you as a wild red head.\" Jane says with a grin. I walk out the door to see Mr. Plumtree walking about the lawn. I get closer and he sees me and I go to his side. \"I had to tell her, she would not stop talking to me about if we were together. I did not want to give her false hope.\" he tells me. \"I understand, though I still don't see why she threw her bonnet at me. I think it was because that was the only weapon she had perhaps.\" I tell him as he looks at me. \"I do not understand my affections for you. To be honest you have not even been here a month and I feel as though I can not go a day without seeing you.\" he confesses to me. \"I am a horrible person Mr. Plumtree, you do not know very much about me at all.\" I try to tell him. \"Believe me when I tell you Fanny would be a better match for you.\" \"There is nothing you have done that could turn my feelings away from you.\" he says as he tries to grab my hand. Jane's POV I watch as the young Miss Worthington tries to explain to Mr. Plumtree why they are not a match. To be honest the reasoning was quite simple he was from the past and she from the future. How could someone as strong and proud as she give in to someone like Mr. Plumtree a future lawyer. Though I do confess a part of her was relenting. I saw this as her face softened. What ever words he was telling her were words she had not heard before. Things were different here though. She didn't know how to act like a lady from this time. It would be my task to teach her such lessons. I did not know if she would ever return home or if this time was now meant to be her new home. I could tell after a short time of talking they were beginning to grow closer. This is what I feared though, she had no family here and no money. I would have to make up a story about her now having no parents or money. He took her hands is his and held them to his face. I watched as he smiled at her and she returned it. If I had not known better I would have said she was falling in love with him as well. They separated after he kissed her hands. He kept looking back at her though. Fearing perhaps she would not be there the next time her turned to look at her. Once he was out of sight she came back in the house. I went to her wanting to know what they talked about since I could not hear them. \"So do tell.\" I ask her impatiently. \"He is different then the men where I come from you are very right there Miss Austen. There is something about him that I can not help but like.\" she tells me as she lowers her head and blushes. \"If I did not know any better I would say you are falling in love with him?\" I ask her. \"I do not know, how could that be so? I am not from here and I do not know when if ever I will return home.\" she tells me with worry on her face. \"Let us worry about that when and if that happens. For now I am sure you just need time to think things over.\" I tell her. Andria's POV The next morning I woke up rather refreshed. I walk out to stream where I was found by Fanny and Mr. Plumtree. I look down into the stream wondering how all of this happened in the first place? Did I belong here? Was this natures was of putting me where I belonged? I sat down by the stream when I heard giggling in the background. I turn around and see Fanny talking to another young man. Wow she recovers quickly I thought to myself. I look back into the stream and realize my hair is down but I did not care. \"Miss Worthington!\" I hear a male voice call out for me. I turn around to see Mr. Plumtree walking my way. Really what time did people get up in this time period? I stand up from the stream and begin to walk to him. We finally reach one another when Fanny walks past us on purpose showing off her new friend. I can see Mr. Plumtree not even turn her way but instead off me his arm. I accepted and he took me a little further into a small patch of woods. \"Miss Worthington I am quite glad to see you today.\" he tells me with a big smile. \"We have not even gone one day without seeing one another, I can not imagine you have missed me that much.\" I tell him with a laugh. \"Oh but I have, I wish to speak to Miss Austen about our situation when I return from my business in town.\" he tells me as I lean against a tree. \"Oh well, I am sure she will speak to you whenever you want.\" I tell him as he walks closer to me. \"Please tell me that at present you do not harbor feeling to any other besides myself?\" he ask me. Wow, that is really straight forward. I don't know anyone else besides him well at least in this time period. \"No, you are the only one.\" I tell him.

He looked and acted so different from the mennof my country "},{"Movie":"Hidalgo","Title":"fortitude","Author":"zhuu","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6043497","Passage":"[Chapter 1] He'd been with women before her, but none of them stayed put so stubbornly in his mind. It was a quality he admired in her, he thought, but nonetheless it was an irritating one. Why wasn't she so easily dismissed as the women from before? ( Before and after had somewhere become divided by a great canyon of her - there was life before her, and life after her.) Besides, all that remained of her in his mind was a pig-headed will and dark, smoky eyes. The others were a mess of hot, tangled limbs and spicy breath on his mouth, his cheeks. But over time they had merged into one single generic entity - running their fingertips down the smooth slope of his bare chest, the slow scrape of the nails leaving a trail of goosebumps on his flesh, blondes, brunettes, red-heads, southern accents, and hoity-toity misses, they were all the same. Only she, with her olive skin and swathe of curled hair stuck there - haunting the space behind his eyes so that he couldn't even sleep in peace. Sometimes he'd feel an ache deep in his stomach when he thought of her, a bizarre tightening of his muscles, and he'd wonder if it could ever work. Him and her. How could it? A man ungoverned by society, far rider and his fine pony, a man with no rules and little respect for them, with the daughter of a Sheik? The cultural boundaries were inescapable - they cast a tall, dark shadow over him and he shied away from it. So when she came to him on the night before his departure, chewing at her swollen lips and wringing the soft skin of her hands into tatters, he was coolly impassive. She was fragile, vulnerable and he spoke to her as he would a nervous pony, the tone low and seductive, even if the words were not so satisfying. \"You would leave without saying goodbye?\" she asks him, her voice trembling but her chin notched up towards him, her eyes smiling (proud and gallant to the last, it was more than he could say for himself). \"I thought'd be easier fer the both of us,\" he shrugged, turning his face away from her, the ache in his stomach moving up towards his throat, \"considerin',\". \"Ah,\" she doesn't understand – somewhere in the back of her mind she'd allowed herself a futile amount of glittering hope and his indifference stung like sand in an open wound – even if she sounds as if she does, she is gentle and naïve, even if she'd convinced herself otherwise. The sound of her uncertainty and the slow poke of her tongue in her cheek (she's uncomfortable now, wondering whether she should leave or press her hand against his heart to see if there was something beating) and the way she tilts her face up towards his makes his throat contract. He swallows thickly and tucks his hands into his pockets (the temptation is there and his skin's burning for contact with hers), wanting so much to press a few inches further and close the gap between their mouths. The moonlight makes her face looks pale and he thinks that there is no other way for it to be – they could meet like this, when the moon is silver in the sky and the sun with it's prying eyes cannot see the way their hearts beat and their fingers quiver, but what kind of life is that for her? He would not have her be his dirty little secret. (Besides, he doesn't think that a Colt would be enough to keep her father away from his 'pride' if he found his daughter missing – he could never run far enough, and sooner or later they would swarm over him like bees.) \"You should go home, Jazira,\" her face is uncovered and he watches helplessly as her mouth tightens into the straight line that he knows so well, after such little time, \"yer father'll be wonderin' where you are.\" He's purely earnest and she knows that he's worried that something will happen again, that he'll be tied to a post and she'll be dragged away screaming. The memory makes her wince – and she's suddenly aware of the thin line that fans down her back, arrogant and bold-faced because men have never been shy of their cruelty. \"I should,\" she says slowly, tasting the words in her mouth, \"but I couldn't watch you leave and not say anything,\". And then there is no need for words; she raises a tentative, shaking hand to his mouth and traces the curve of his lips. He is stoic, with stiff shoulders and clenched fists, but his lips are parted and his eyes are dark, unreadable, wide. He thinks he can see the glimmer of tears in her eyes, and his stomach clenches. Who would cry over him? He's distant and cool with everyone, with women, and he never fails to push them away. How could anyone love him, when he is incomplete? Jazira has never said that she loves him; but it has been clear to him since she had cupped his hand with her own and shown him her face, streaked with bitter tears and aching with the injustice of the world. Her fingers leave a trail of hot skin down the slope of his neck, down his chest, along his wrist. She pulls one of hands from it's pocket and he lets it slip away meekly, her boldness and apparent determination silencing him. She bends her head and presses her lips against his skin; it's cool and dry and her mouth leaves a fiery eruption of goose-flesh. And without a word she leaves; the moonlight shining onto the empty dock as though she'd never been there at all, the only evidence of her presence the faint thrum of his pulse in his ears. She was stubborn to the extreme. That night he dreamt of dark hair and shining eyes and when he woke up he was sweating, his mouth twisted into a flicker of a grin, because this time the tangled limbs of his dreams had been clearly attached to a face .

It's a drabble/short oneshot, if you can tell. Yes, I know it's not a true drabble. Whatever. Judgement Judgement. People often fall short of it. For the cowboy cloaked in tattered leather and a dusty old hat on his head, Frank Hopkins made an odd sight riding to the finish line against two others on an impure brown and white stallion who came by the name 'Hidalgo' at a whistle. And even on that fateful and historic day that his his mustang raced with his head nearly parallel to the ground and his hooves about to trip over themselves, he fought for the first position, desperately passing up the two purebred Arabians that flanked him. Arabians who'd been born for racing. He, an impure mustang, as they called him, beat two Arabians who had been trained since foals to run faster than the wind. And yet, even once he was showered and adorned in praise by friends and family, Frank couldn't help but notice the dull and tired look in his faithful stallion's eyes. Once he had stepped foot back on American soil, he easily knew what his horse wanted most: Freedom. The freedom to race the birds and soar with the wind, and though he tossed and turned all night and wrestled with nightmares, Frank knew which decision was right. Should he let Hidalgo stay, letting him live out the rest of his days in misery, or let him return to where he was foaled and raised? With a heart twisted in pain, he slowly took off his horse's halter that Hidalgo had known for nearly all of his life with Frank. The stallion had looked at him with a sort of happy look, but Frank dismissed it; it was hard enough. It was what they both wanted. And no matter how much he was judged in the great race across Arabia and the other many countries by the \"true racers,\" as they called themselves, he knew that he'd come out on top. He always did. Judgement never got to him. Woo. This category looked rather lonely.

Hidalgo remembered the torture, the nightmares he had encountered that day. His race for that day had included a rough ride through the mountainous terrains of the Alps. His rider wasn't the best, and halfway through, a horse that he had been behind tripped, scaring the rider to death. This made Hidalgo angry, because any good rider knows to never race directly behind another horse! Also, that experience made the rider hurt Hidalgo by pulling on the reigns and kicking him. So when he had gotten back to the stables, Hidalgo kicked the rider's front teeth out. That will show him. Hidalgo thought. Unfortunately, the manager of the rider got very, very mad about this, and wanted to get Hidalgo shot. Hidalgo's owner begged and begged, but the manager wouldn't budge, saying that he would press charges on the owner if he didn't obey. So, amid a flood of tears, the owner of Hidalgo bid him one last adieu. And as the owner took up the high powered rifle to shoot Hidalgo right through the head, Hidalgo had a 2 second stroke of genius. He fell to the ground, motionless, as the owner thought that Hidalgo's old heart had just given out. So he went the the manager of Hidalgo's former rider, and told him that watching Hidalgo die was even worse than any charge that he could press. But Hidalgo was very much still alive, barely even daring to take a breath until his owner was gone. As soon as his owner walked out of the big double doored stable though, Hidalgo thrust himself up, his knees working better than they ever had before. His escapee life was just about to begin. Hidalgo, seconds after he had gotten up, got an immediate burst of horse adrenaline and broke through the double doors, much to the surprise of everyone outside. He ran as hard as he could toward the small fence separating the stables from a sheep pasture, only stopping after he had leaped over the fence with grace. Now I'm starting to miss my owner already . Hidalgo thought with sadness. WHIZZ! A bullet went right past Hidalgo, almost striking his shoulder. Apparently the rider's manager got trigger happy, even though Hidalgo would be gone anyway. Hidalgo saw a little ravine no more than 50 feet away from him, but unfortunately he would have to wind through the many sheep grazing in between. Another bullet shot by and grazed his shoulder, then hitting a sheep. It fell with a agonizing bleet. Immediately, Hidalgo realized that if he wanted to live, he would have to make a run for it-and fast. So he burst into action, hearing another bullet hit another sheep. To Hidalgo, now sheeps' lives didn't matter anymore. He plowed as quickly as he could through their herd, shoving them to the ground where they could at least dodge a bullet. Suddenly, the rider and his manager started shooting. Hidalgo was just 10 feet away now. Then 5. 4. 3. Hot pain gripped his rear as he realized that he had been hit by a bullet. Hidalgo's front legs gave in, and he went flying into the ravine head first. Managing to use his legs as a shield, he kept himself from snapping his neck. Finally, he came to rest in the middle of the ravine. A little creek ran over him, cooling him down, and easing the pain on his blood-oozing wound. Hidalgo, being a smart horse, knew that in order to keep from getting infected, he would have to get the bullet taken out of him, and his wound cleaned. So he decided to go to his mother's owner, even though she was dead. Hidalgo walked, stumbled, and even dragged himself, he was so desperate to get to his birth place. Eventually, after 5 nights of agonizing pain, suffering, and misery, he was there. But what he saw disturbed him greatly. There were no signs of life at his old barn. None. But what scared him the most was in the house. When he poked his head through the screen door, he found the cut up bodies of the rancher and his wife. Hidalgo whipped his head out, glad to be out of that foul stench. He judged that they had been there for a few days now. A rustling noise disrupted his thinking, and before he knew it, the rancher's kids were upon Hidalgo. One of them had a knife, and both of them had strange looks in their eyes-along with different colors now. Hidalgo tried to run, but they tied him down with a rope... The boy, whose name was Mickey, began building a fire and dragged several pans out of the bushes. They are going to cut me up and eat me! Hidalgo thought. Rachel, the girl, took the knife and began to sharpen it on a stone. Hidalgo started thinking, and decided that he had better kick the girl, so that the knife would at least be out of the picture. Apparently the girl had forgotten the rules of horses, for she was right behind Hidalgo. This will be too easy. He thought. With a sudden WHAM , the girl was on her back, crying. The knife flew into the bushes, with Mickey jumping for it. Luckily for Hidalgo, it went deep into the bush area, where no one could find it. After minutes of hitting and kicking Hidalgo, Mickey finally stopped. And when Rachel got up, her eyes had changed back into their normal color; the look had become regular again-not the bloodthirsty look she had had before they met. Since Rachel was a smart girl, she deduced that the kick had ended her \"disease\". So she proceeded to do the same to Mickey. He took a frying pan to the face. Normality returned to him, also. \"Man, what happened?\" Mickey said. \"I think that we were under some kind of spell or something...\" Rachel said before collapsing onto the ground. \"Rachel!! Uuh..\" Mickey said, before falling onto the ground too. Those were Mickey's and Rachel's last words. Hidalgo thought with sadness that he had afflicted their deaths, but quickly forced that thought out of his head. With nowhere else to go now, and with all of his options failed, Hidalgo began to wander.

Note 2 : Il s'agit de mon premier essai sur ce fandom. Like the Wind that is Free Frank Hopkins n'oubliera jamais le jour où il a rencontré celui qui allait devenir son meilleur compagnon, son ami, son confident. Son frère. Hidalgo. Un mustang libre et sauvage. Indomptable. Esprit des Grandes Plaines. Petit cheval pie au caractère bien trempé. Il l'avait capturé, le mustang libre, le Grand Esprit. Il l'avait capturé. Avec un vulgaire lasso, il l'avait privé de son troupeau, de ses attaches. Aussitôt attrapé, aussitôt relâché. Il lui avait retiré le lasso dès qu'il avait pu le toucher. L'étalon sauvage aurait du s'enfuir, reprendre sa liberté. Il n'en fit rien. Ce jour là, Frank n'avait pas capturé un cheval sauvage. Il avait gagné un ami. Ce fut lorsque le mustang, au lieu de fuir, avança vers lui, qu'il le comprit. Il ne serait plus jamais seul. Plus jamais Frank Hopkins ne se retrouva seul. Il le nomma Hidalgo, le Noble mustang. Le frère de l'Enfant Bleu, autrefois Cavalier Lointain, lui donna tout. Il lui donna tout dans l'Océan de Feu, cette course incroyable contre les meilleurs chevaux Arabes des lignées les plus pures qui soient. Contre ces cavaliers au teint halé pour qui les mustangs étaient impurs, souillés. Contre le grand Al Hathal, Pur-Sang Arabe noir de jais au galop si rapide, à l'endurance si développée. Frank avait cru perdre son frère dans l'Océan de Feu. Mais le Grand Esprit s'était relevé, et il était remonté. Au galop, ils étaient repartis, vers Al Hathal, vers l'arrivée, la mer, la Victoire. Progressivement, ils étaient remonté ; ils avaient dépassé l'Étalon Noir qui ne pouvait allonger d'avantage ses foulées. Le galop rapide aux foulées courtes du petit mustang pie les mena droit à la Victoire. La Victoire, la mer, la Gloire. Mais surtout, la survie et la Liberté. La liberté pour les milliers de mustangs qui attendaient leur heure dans le grand corral. Un seul homme avait décidé que la race des mustangs avait eu son heure, qu'ils devaient disparaitre. La victoire d'Hidalgo lui donna tort, la prime obtenue par Frank leur rendit leur liberté. L'immense troupeau se déversa dans les Grandes Plaines en un flot continu. Le noble mustang et son fidèle cow-boy les observaient jouir de leur liberté reconquise. Toujours sauvages. Toujours Libres. A aucun moment, le Grand Esprit ne manifesta son envie de les rejoindre. Parce qu'il n'était pas captif. Parce que c'était son frère. Pourtant, Frank avait défait les courroies du filet et relâché la sangle. Rendant à Hidalgo son aspect initial, sans le moindre artifice de l'Homme. L'étalon avait avancé de quelques pas, et c'était retourné vers l'Enfant Bleu. Il l'avait regardé. Un dernier regard. Un dernier sourire. Un hochement de tête. Le mustang était parti. Il avait rejoint ceux qu'il n'avait jamais vraiment quitté, dans les Grandes Plaines. Frank demeura seul. Lourde solitude retrouvée. Il regarda son ami galoper, libre, parmi ses frères. Il sourit. Heureux. Le Grand Esprit ne fut jamais dompté. Et jamais il ne le sera. Il galopera, libre, parmi les mustangs sauvages pour l'Éternité. Toujours sauvage, toujours libre. Hidalgo, mon compagnon. Mon ami. Mon Frère. Terminé. C'était un OS relativement court, mais j'ai eu plaisir à l'écrire. J'aime beaucoup les chevaux et ce film est magnifique. J'imagine ce qu'a pu ressentir Frank T. Hopkins en capturant Hidalgo, et en le relâchant. J'espère que cette petite fic vous a plu, merci aux personnes qui laisseraient des reviews.

Like this one. I was introduced to it at my school's latest singing competition. Let's face it, the singers sucked, but the song brought me to the verge of tears—and that's something only one song has done in the past: \"Now We are Free\" from Gladiator . *sniff sniff.* What was the first thing I did when I got to the internet? Looked up \"My Immortal\" on YouTube. And then, I decided to do a songfic. The only question was: which fandom? After sifting through the database for a while, I found the perfect match. AHA! The rest is history, devoted readers. DISCLAIMER: I don't own Hidalgo— I'm too poor. My Immortal I'm so tired of being here, supressed by all my childish fears... Jazira swept back the colourful walls of her tent and gazed out into the desert. The moon cast a red glow over the sands. Was that all it was—just sand? All Jazira could see was sand. At that moment she remembered Frank, and his tales of the Wild West. Spectacular tales, and spectacular worlds. She longed to visit them. She longed to ride on Hidalgo's back once more with that cowboy, taste the western winds and share a whole new world with him. Yet, she was afraid—of the unknown. And if you have to leave I wish that you would just leave, 'Cause your presence still lingers here And it won't leave me alone... How had they parted? With a smile, a wave, and a quick farewell. What kind of a parting was that? She remembered giggling and walking off towards the sea while Frank stood, his eyes never leaving her, his hair blowing wildly in the wind. While she slept every night, she peered through a crack in the walls of her tent, and stared at the moon. Occasionally, it ceased being the moon and transformed into his rough, mesmerizing face, staring right back at her. Sometimes she felt him beside her while she sat alone, or when she rode freely through that ocean of fire, her hair flying behind her. These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time cannot erase... Nothing could stop her feelings. She felt like she was no longer in control—he was. His heart was her heart, his soul was her soul. When they parted, they shattered. Her heart and his, her soul and his. Both ripped apart, bleeding. No matter how hard she tried, there was no remedy except his impossible presence. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears And I held your hand through all of these years But you still have All of me ... She had been with him every step of that race. She shared his sufferings, his heartache, and his victory. She had been there to clean his wounds, to comfort him when he was ready to surrender, to push him to finish what he had started. She had taught him to believe in himself, and in return, he took her whole being and placed it within his heart. You used to captivate me With your resonating light Now I'm bound by the life you left behind... She remembered seeing his beautiful face for the first time. He had looked like someone from a dream, dangerously attractive. She was immediately drawn to him. It seemed that, from the first moment they set eyes on eachother, he saw through the veil that shrouded her face. He saw her not as an ordinary girl, but as...beautiful, inside and out. Your face it haunts My most pleasant dreams... Once she had dreamt of a beautiful garden, like something from Damascus. She tasted the delicious fruit and ran her hands along the spectrum of flowers. Suddenly, she saw Frank leaning against a tree. She stood there, motionless, unable to breathe. Then, she woke up. Your voice it chased away All the sanity in me... She heard his voice all around her. She heard him in conversation, she heard his whisper on the evening winds. Once she heard him, and she called out to him desperately, unaware of reality. Was she mad—or just in love? I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone But though you're still with me I've been alone all along... She couldn't come to terms with the fact that she would never see him again. She was madly in love—she needed him to survive! She screamed his name and wept. He was somehow with her—in spirit, but was it just madness? She was really alone after all. And that fact was a blow to the heart for Jazira.

Hi I'm Spark or Sparkynif you like. I'm a pure bred colt tri-coloured mustang. So thosenhumans say anyway. I am now a whole year old and the shortest of thenherd. My sire is the head stallion around here. No one messes withnhim. And my mum, lead mare, she's the best. \" Comenon lads, round 'em up, we need to start on the little ones.\" That's Joe. He's head stable boy around here. I don't have anclue what he means about 'starting on the little ones' butnI'm sure it will be fun. \"Hi,nyou want to race?\" Oh great, I thought more competition. I hatenBlacky; he is always trying to beat me when he knows he can't. Inhave the finest blood and he well, he's just a low life. Well asnusual I win. He just doesn't give in. What'snthis? No more than two people ever come into the field at the samentime. There were at least ten men heading towards us. With headncollars, great we're going to be brought in. I have been leadn' on a lead rope before, and have taught briefly walk, trot and canter to their voice commands, but other than thatnthey tend to leave me alone. Joe headed strait towards mum, hernbeautiful white mane flowed in the gentle breeze and chestnut coatnglistened in the sunlight. Of course I never left my mums side, so Infollowed them in to a training ring, right beside the field. Dadnwhickered as we left. \"Right Joe, start weaning him!\" Innever understand what the boss ever says. \"He has already beennweaned once sir, we do so again?\" I can't remember beennweaned before, it can't have been important. As it turns out, beingnweaned is important and isn't so good, in fact I hated it. Beingnaway from my mother is awful, I know I shouldn't be with hernanymore but I love my mum and go on the most awesome adventures. Theynsoon strapped that dreadful head collar onto me. Boy was it painful.nBut it was happening to the others too. One in particular I feltnsorry for. Coffee was her name. She was beautiful. But she doesn'tnhave many friends, unlike me. She is so young and so she sticks tonher mothers' side, never leaves her, NEVER, poor girl. \"Allnright boys rap it up; put 'em in the stables.\" I hate thenboss. Always makes us do things, even if we don't want to. Forninstance now, why go back to an enclosed stable when there is a hugenfield to gallop in. Well I wasn't having that. So I kicked up anfuss. Rearing, bronking, bucking, kicking out, everything, yetnnothing worked. I'm just too small. When I tried snapping, mum gotnstressed. \"Just behave\" she said, but NO! I'm not goingnin. I wanted to gallop with dad, he promised I could. \" Calmndown boy, calm\" what a broken record Joe sounded like trying tonbring me in. \"give him 'ere Joe, I'll teach him\" Joenseemed reluctant to hand me over to the boss, but if he didn't hencould lose his job. I looked at mum, \"what are they going to do\" I panicked. \"I don't know son, just stay with me\" hernkind words always made me feel safe. \"Come on little colt!\" The boss dragged me away from my mother, as they locked her in thenstable, they pulled me out. Scared I was. Peoplensaid they could see the fear in my eyes. Know wonder. They wherenseparating me from my mother, all night, distressed and alone in anstable to big for just me. This is my punishment for wanting to go innthe field, to have freedom. I was alone, scared and cold. Allnnight I had terrible nightmares, so I decided to give up and notnsleep. I stood shivering near the door, whining. \"Joe! Go seenthat bloody foal!\" The boss screamed at him. Suddenly a cold handndropped upon my back and I shot towards the back corner, when thenlights flickered. I was trembling with fear. I ran in circlesnwondering where to go, this stupid straw rapped round my feet andntripped me up. I couldn't get it off. I screamed for my mum. As Joenunbolted the door I jumped to my feet and shot towards the door.nStraw dropped from my feet, free! At last, I barged out of that hellnhole and neighed to my mother and galloped towards her. \"Ohnyou naughty boy, I'm so glad you're here.\" Mum nuzzled menas if I had been gone for years on end. \"In you go Sonador, letnyour foal in\" Joe pushed my mum back and unbolted the door. \"Yes\" I cried Joe was letting me reunite with mum. I knewnJoe was nice boy really. Off I pranced to mynmothers' side. We nuzzled for hours, until I just had to go tonsleep. Being my mums first born, she was really protective and reallynclingy, but I love her, and glad she's so kind I love to stay withnher. So I lay down, next to my mum, when my dreams emerged and mynnightmares faded away. Now that I was by my mothers' side nothingncould harm me now, not in my warm, safe and secure sanctuary. The next mourning Inawoke to find my mother gone. I had several questions like why couldnshe leave it was so perfect? When did she go, why didn't they takenme with her? How could she do this to me? She promised never to leavenme, yet she has done so now. I started pawing at the door. No onencame. I tried climbing but it didn't work, I could only just pop mynhead over the door. Nothing I could do brought my mother home, notneven squealing at the top of my voice. Now I started to get reallynwound up and stood at the back of the stable focusing on the door. \"Incan do this\" I repeated to myself. Then took a huge leap at thendoor, I didn't make it over but I did break it. Wood shatteredneverywhere. I found a new strength within, as I lay on the groundntrying to get back up but my shoulder hurt, badly. Eventually I gotnup avoiding putting weight on my right shoulder, missing the splintsnof wood across the floor I galloped off trying to shake off the painnand find my mum. I searched everywhere. People chased me all over thenyard. Why couldn't they understand, I wanted, no I needed to findnmy mum. I was ready to leave her, not yet. Mumnwas no where to be seen, so I crawled through the field fence andncalled for my dad. He's a great dad, not like the rest, he'snkind, sensitive and loves his children. He came charging up to me,nknowing I was distressed he tried to calm me down before we smashednthrough the fence looking again for mum. \"There\" dadnpointer his hoof towards her, his magnificent black silk coatnglittering like the stars. I had to canter along side his trot as hentook me all the way up to mum in the training ring where a man wasnsat on her back. Shenhad a strange black ropes or something around her head, not a headncollar, and a cold shiny metal rod in her mouth with long strips ofnblack stuff held by that man and a strange black thing with strangenmetal bits hanging down, on her back where the man was sat. Shenseemed to enjoy this, yet he controlled her every move. The mannjumped off and left her stood in the middle of the ring. Henjogged over to us putting me in the arena with mum and quicklynputting dad back in the field. \"What are you doing out here?\" mum seemed really angry and annoyed to see me, yet I was so happy tonget her back. \"Mum I woke up this morning and you where gone.nThen I broke down the door, and searched everywhere, then I ran tonget dads help\" I gasped helplessly. I was so tired, I didn'tnget much sleep, n then I bashed down doors and galloped all morning.nI let myself fall to the floor with exhaustion. Joe came runningntowards us, sort of panicky calling for the boss. With what he needednhelp for I didn't know, but I heard him explain to the boss that hensaw me fall and thought I could be hurt. When he saw that Joe wasnright about me laid on the floor he started to sprint towards me, allnworried and shaky. I looked up at him as im to say what's the fussnabout chief? \"Ohnno, my pride possession, down\" Boss seemed upset and angry. Inthought best get out of the way, so I jumped up and galloped off,nputting in lots of free jumps. \"Joe,nshot some poles out, and get some jumps put up\" Boss screamednat him. \"I want to see what 'appens, now move.\" He ordered.nWondering what Joe was doing, I wondered up and curiously sniffed andnlooked at these colorful poles. I stepped back, thinking they were sonsort of new toy. I turned around and trotted a bit, looking back atnit. I cantered up to it, leaping into the air, wind whipping past mynface, whirling through my mane I felt like I was flying. Landing onnthe other hand was a bit rough; I tripped and began to feel uneasy.nBut I tried again, it was fun and I didn't want to spoil it. Thenhumans started to put more out, higher as well. I felt my confidencengrow and began to think woah this is so fun . \"He'sna good one, we get tack on him tomorrow, 'k?\" Boss orderednJoe. Break me in? What's that? Who cares? This is way to fun tonstop and think about what they are babbling on about. \"Woah nownboy, steady, slow down, come on now, back to the stable\" Ha no,nI'm having way too much fun. One by one they started to put thenjumps away, until one was left, the one I had never dared to jump,nthe poles were different, flatter and longer, and it was set highernup than the rest. Boss and Joe had decided to leave this one, so Inthought I'd give it a shot. Quickly changing my mind as theyngathered round to catch me I struck out my feet, pleading with themnnot to take me in. They backed me into the corner when my dadnrealized how scared I was, at least fifteen men had me cornered, allnof them ready to pounce. Mynfather charged forward, leaping fences to get to me, fighting off thenmen to free me, I followed him back out into the field where Infinally collapsed with exhaustion. Joe ran after us to make sure Inwas ok; he was the only one which stood back, not wanting me to bencaptured. \"Joe,nfirst thing tomorrow, that colt needs tacking up, I want him ready bynten o'clock, got it?\" Bosses voice was faintly heard in thendistance, was so mean to Joe. Tack? I thought, \"Dad? What isntack?\" My dad looked down. \"You see it's this thing\" he trailed off. \"This thing which the humans out on you, sonthey can control you to do certain things, like walk, trot, canter,ngallop, jump and lengthen or shorten your strides a certain time.nYou have already been voice broken yes?\" I nodded. \"Wellnthis is similar, but harsher ok?\" I nodded and headed over tonthe water bucket, my father following. \"Hate to break it to yankid, but your not the only one going through his, they are going tonput a saddle you up and ride ya, but you will be a magnificentnstallion, you have great paces. Now when they bring you in, be good.nAnd trust in them, especially Joe.\" Dad finished and turnednoff. \"I'm off to find mum.\" I galloped off, prancing andntesting the air with my lips. In the distance I could make out humannfigures, talking to each other and laughing, curiously I headed upnuntil I saw mum and trotted her way. Morningncame early today. I was tied up out side a stable door, Joe stood bynmy side letting me sniff the 'tack' he brought to put on me. Onenstrange looking human started hacking away at my feet. One startingndoing something with my tail, another with my mane and 2 on eithernside brushing down my fuzzy coat mixed with adult fur. Boy did I looknbeautiful when they finished. \"OknJoe, bridle, now. Make sure he takes that bit.\" You could tellnJoe hated Boss, but he did as he was told. Joe's soft hand guidednwhat they called a bit, into my delicate mouth. They had putnpeppermint flavoring on it tempt me into taking it, but that didn'tnstop the harsh, horrible, cold taste of metal stinging my mouth. Ohnyuck, it was horrible. I screamed. I continually chomped and tried tonspit it out but it didn't work. So it wouldn't come out, I had tonwarm it up, the cold bitterness felt awful, if only it were warmer itnwouldn't hurt as much. I tossed my head in the air and fidgetednlike mad. \"Getnhim walking round. Joe use the reins left and right to turn. You nonthe drill.\" Boss obviously wanted me learning quick. \"Thatnyearling has a lot to catch up on h e is already 4 months behind\" Boss ordered Joe as he walked me around. \"He's got it sir,nsee\" Joe exclaimed. \"Right then saddlen'im up.\" Joe tied me back up to the wall and brought over then'saddle'. \"Actually tack someone up in front of him, show itndoesn't hurt.\" Boss' face was beaming, delighted with mynprogress. Itndidn't look so bad. So on went the saddle, nice and easy although Inflinched a little as the girth was pulled up from underneath me. Indidn't really mind. \"Excellent\" Boss took over from Joe.nThe work now became really fun. Lunging, leading, free ranging, itnall became fun until… BANG! My saddle droppednto the ground. I spooked wildly calling for my mother. As shenappeared by the ring I was galloping flat out until my legs couldncarry me no further. Incollapsed to the ground, my side pressed against the rough wood fencenaround the arena. The last thing I remember was my mother stood overnme telling me I was like my father, Hidalgo. WhennI finally awoke Joe, my mother Sonador, my father Black beauty and mynboss where gathered round looking at me anxiously. \"Oh my poornbaby\" Mum cried. \"You know\" my dad begun \"Younremind me such much of my father; he was fast, a good jumper too.\" Wow I thought. My grandfather was amazing, everyone new his name,neveryone talks about him. Can I live up to his name? I wondered. Overnwhelmed with excitement I shot to my feet and pranced around. My mumnsays Grandpa always liked me better than the other foals so it'snreally nice to get the chance to make him proud of me. Joenchased me all over the arena trying to bring me in, but I was toonexcited. \"Spark my boy, come here, you have had your fun\" Dadnshouted to me. And of course I had to obey; I mean he is my fathernafter all. I merrily trotted over to mum and dad when we werenreleased into the small grazing paddock. \"Oh sweet grass\" I laid and rolled in the soft blades, kicking my feet into the air,nrubbing my head and neck into the cool, sweet smelling grass. \"Mynboy, you want to be the best don't you?\" My dad questioned. \"Yes, of course father\" I replied. \"Well listen, Inhave got Tom over to teach you some jumping techniques\" Tom wasna handsome light bay gelding; he stood around 13.2hh and had a thinnblaze down his face with lots of little freckles. His eyes shone andnhis spirits set high. Although he was a gelding he had the presencenof a stallion, arched neck, high strides and fabulous jumpingntechniques he had it all. \"Before you go off with Tom, you willnlearn you're racing skills from me.\" Wow. Dad was seriouslyngoing to teach me. Most stallions are bothered about there foals, butnthat's what makes my dad special, he did. \"One last thing,ntrust in the humans they know what they are doing\" And withnthat he left me with Tom. We cantered up to a fallen down tree. Woah,nthis was high, bigger than I had thought anyway. Tom checked thenother side for ditches and soft ground. Then slowly cantering up tonme he said \" stay inline with me, take off when I do, thenhumans are watching, and make it look good.\" I looked over tonsee Joe and the boss stood by the fence, eyes gazing on me, theirnbodies tense. I lined myself up against Tom, finding it rather easynto keep up. \"One…Two…Three…\" We both counted thennsoared like an eagle though the air. Landing on a perfect note wencantered and kicked out with joy. \"Congratulations, you made itnover perfectly, look.\" Tom pointed his head in the direction ofnthe humans. The jumped for joy, bringing themselves into the field toncatch me and Tom. Onenman was setting out some jumps as we entered the arena. Tom's earsnpricked up as he looked around at how the jumps were set out. \"Spark,nlook, see if you can connect the jumps, make a course.\" Inlooked round, deciding on a starting fence I walked around, pullingnJoe as went along, Tom followed, fighting against boss. \"Tom, isnthis right, what I'm doing?\" I asked, not sure what I wasndoing. \"Just follow you're heart it will tell you where to go\" He replied. OncenI had used all the jumps to build a course Joe and Boss had given upnand let us off the lead ropes. \"After you Spark, I will follownyou over; don't worry if you knock any down.\" Ok so off Inwent, gracefully and calmly, cantering up and flying over each jumpnin turn. At the end Tom was released back into the field, but me, Inwas taken back into the stable. Where I was to be tacked up, andnbacked. I stood around the same height as Tom and this short girl wasnstood with my tack. She stood around 5ft tall, wearing jeans coverednby suede chaps and a brown suede cowboy jacket. She didn't wear anprotective hat, but a cowboy hat with the letter V engraved into it.nShe held out a nice big juicy carrot as she placed the saddle on mynback. Tightening the girth and adjusting the stirrups I stood stillnpatiently as Joe put my bridle on. Once fully tacked she hopped onnand walked me forward into the arena. Thencourse was still up from earlier on. I was dying to rush over themnall. I tried to canter off over them, but she sat tight and turned menaway from them, wanting me to do what she wanted I obeyed and waitednfor her to tell me what to do. She whispered Noro lim,nSpark, noro lim into my ear, meaning ride fast Sparknride fast. We faced the jumps and completed a course. \"Wellndone Vicky\" Boss said as she jumped from my back. \"Younsaid on the phone he had never been rode?\" Vicky questionednBoss, \"if so, why was he so accustomed to be ridden, he didneverything I asked at exactly the right time.\" So I likednVicky, we had this connection, and she hated Boss. \" Actually itnis his first time backed; no one has ever ridden him. He has beennvoice broken and lunged but that's it.\" Boss snapped at her.nVicky had left me stood by her side without holding onto my reins,nfirst thought run, second stay; we have this connection between us,nas if we were bound to be horse and rider together as one. Vickyntook hold of my lead rope and grabbed my tack. As she was putting myntack away I heard the Boss talking to Joe. \"I want research donenon this girl, find everything you can, no one just gets on a horsenlike that and can get it to do what it wants.\" Boss was saying. \"I know sir; something is strange about that girl\" Joenreplied. It's not like Joe to criticize I could sense somethingnterrible was going to happen. Joencame rushing into the arena where Boss and I where stood. \"I'vengot it, I've got it\" he cried. \"She is, Samovila.\" Boss stood confused and worried. \"Sam-a who har?\" Bossesnword dribbled from his mouth. \"Samovila, the ancient eastnEuropean Goddess\" Boss jumped back in shock. \"It can'tnbe, she kills men\" Boss looked extremely frightened. \"Yes,nshe kills men, but only Hunters. They were wary ofnher beauty. She was a well dressed woman speaking the languages ofnanimals. Vila was fiercely possessive of her wild herds. Should onenbe injured or-worse yet-killed, the Vila mutilated the offender ornlured him into a magic circle and danced him to death. Alternatively,nthe Vila might bury him in rocks by starting an avalanche, or simplyncause him to keel over with a heart attack. The Vila was able tonmasquerade as a snake, swan, falcon, horse, or whirlwind.\" Joenhad done his research alright. \"So she is dangerous, toondangerous In fact. Get her on the phone; I am to make it clear shenstays away form our ranch.\" Screamingnand shouting came from both ends of the phone line. He can't bannVicky or Vila from the ranch, the connection between us is far toonstrong. I galloped off around the field in search for my father. Infound him laying down by the pond staring down at his reflection. \"Father\" I say, and then explain about Vila, \"Younhave met her. She is back? I wondered how long it would be. She is antruly beautiful woman searching for an answer. Did you bond? We did,nunfortunately our bond was not strong enough for her to take me backninto the wild. She does that sometimes, the ones she truly connectsnwith, she releases them, or keeps them as her own.\" Dad fellninto a soft sleep so I cantered off thinking could I be the one shensets free? Am I the one? Will I be released or become one of her own?nCan I survive in the wild? So many questions and no answers. Darknessndrew across the land. As I lay down in my stable I drift off into andeep sleep. A soft voice whispering in my ear awoke me. Vila! She hasncome to take me. She slipped on my head collar, taking me to my mumnand dad to say goodbye, then I would be gone forever. Tears trickledndown from my mums' eyes, dad comforted her as she held her head lownnear his, hugging and wishing I would stay. Walking off I looked uponnthe ranch one last time. I held back the tears and forced myself on. \"Where is he? I have lost my ride!\" I heard Boss scream asnwe vanished into the fog. ","Summary":" A lost ride. Hi I'm Spark or Sparkynif you like.

He remembered his youth, his days as a foal, his first few months of breaking. He was a mustang and one wild horse, difficult to break. But this new man came, and he was diferent. Not hard or cruel, but soft and inviting. He was friendly and spoke to Hidalgo in a language he understood. He was asked to do things by this man, never told. It turned out the man liked to go fast. Hidalgo did, too. And so they began to race, long distance. The way Hidalgo liked it. He was made to run that way. He was made to run in general. And the man, Frank, he was made to ride. He was part Indian. He was as free of spirit as his horse. Hidalgo looked around. He was galloping cross the grass, but there was a somewhat steep hill up ahead. Should he stop? Should he go around? Then he heard it. It was a whistle. One saved for him by one man and one man alone. Frank Hopkins. Hidalgo whinnied in reply, running faster, faster than he had ever run before. Excluding in that far-away race. That was fun. Except when he fell. But even then Frank didn't abandon him. Then they had come home, and he was released by Frank. Back to a herd, which was so big it had broken off into smaller herds. Hidalgo had taken one for his own. It was a good size. Enough to keep him busy. But still he rememberd Frank. He ran, using his strong mustang legs to pull him up over the steep edge of the cliff. He reached the top and looked down. There, sitting at a campfire, was Frank, smiling. Hidalgo stopped, whinnying. This was his human. With this man he was comfortable. He reared back, calling to this human. He was home.

I blinked at him. Go? Okay. Without wasting a moment I cantered down the hill. Not hearing him coming after me, I looked back. He stood there, one hand holding my bridle, tears in his eyes. I realized then that he really wanted be to go. To run with my herd-mates. To be free again. A small part of my mind told me to run, to take this chance at the freedom I thought would never be mine again. But I had to stay.

Summary: You were there, my love... so you know the story. Why am I retelling it now to you? To myself? Why should I relive the pain? Author's Note: So... this is a bit of an odd story. It's odd because it is a new fandom for me, but I saw the movie and I could not leave it alone. I'm sectioning it off differently than is usual of me and the chapters are not led in to with quotes. Also, it's written with a type of narrative I've never used before in a story. Tom is speaking to the reader in a way, but he is telling his story as though he talking to Jane. I felt that he would not be speaking of their relationship to anyone but her, and I wanted to explore the story from his perspective. I do not quote anything directly from the movie, because if you're reading this I assume you've seen the movie - he goes over it as though from memory. Anything in quotes is mine. I did not just want this to be a retelling and rehashing of Becoming Jane. I do hope to bring something new to the table. We follow Tom through his encounters with Jane and things we did not see on screen. Another thing that is different about this story is that it is not just fan fiction... it is something of a historical fiction as well. I researched the characters from the movie and have attempted to use fact and fiction together. I used fact to fill in some of the gaps that the movie left us with - and also just plain made some stuff up. I do not pretend to be an expert on Regency England, but I did research and I did try. So... thank you for trying this with me. I hope you like it and keep coming back for more! ***** There You Were Part I: Hampshire Chapter I *1* I can make no claim to have loved you from the beginning. For it is true, as you may know, that I did not. For the sake of honesty I must admit that I did not initially find you to be anything special at all. I dare say you had the somewhat unfortunate advantage of forming a more solid opinion of me that day in your mother and father's parlor than I did of you. Late, uninterested... ignorant. I can not imagine what you may have thought me to be that day. First impressions, my dear. First impressions. I have long since realized that our lives are not our own. Oh, yes... we are able to make decisions here and there. Will I stand idle? Will I dance with each single lady at the ball? These are little things that give us the illusion that we are in control of our lives, but we are not. By some horrible miracle (Is that ironic, my love? Or is it just tragedy?) I was sent to stay in the country against my will. My own actions had led me to this turn of events but my own actions could not save me from them. Had I been a different man - a better man, I might never have met you at all. The idea is singular in and of itself because, you see, meeting you is what made me a better man. In any case, we are all bound to lead the life we encounter, not the life we imagine... and all life is, is a succession of incidents. Unrelated and unbiased incidents that sometimes lead to change. Change in our situation. Change in our relationships. Change in ourselves. *2* So it was one day as I held a gun for, not the first time in my life, but for the first time in the company of my nervous uncle and cousin... that a small voice calling my name from outside startled me, and unfortunately the gun, in to action. It had not been my fault, I still maintain that the blame lay clearly with Lucy for having, indeed, been the small voice... but perhaps guns were not for me. I had always been more of a boxing man myself. It was clear that I was not the only person in the room to hold this opinion, and it was suggested, and can no longer remember from whom, that I go for a walk. Which led to our second meeting. If our first was beyond my control, our second was even more so. I was lost in muddy Selbourne Wood and there you were. Miss... what was it? I could not recall. I did not think, and nor did I care at the time, that it would offend you. I only knew that I had sat with your family in your home as we all listened to you rattle on about, God only knew what. Everyone around me seemed politely besotted by your written words. What had you been speaking about? Oh, yes. Your sister and her fiancé (happier times for us all). I could not listen as intently as the others. You spoke eloquently and you, no doubt, had talent - but I was unimpressed. I might have mentioned my frustrations aloud, and received a brief scolding from your brother, which left me feeling more amused than chided. So as I saw you walking that day in the woods calling to you... Miss, Miss - unable to pull from the depths of memory your name, I was saved from trying as you spoke to me quickly and in passing. Miss Austen. Oh yes, Miss Austen. Now I remembered... and I was vaguely disappointed that I had not encountered someone more diverting in my hour of need. Yes, I am sorry. That is how I felt upon the beginning of our second meeting - but I confess it now, that was the very last time I ever felt disappointment when finding myself in your presence. You were quick witted and sharp tongued - though I could see that I made you uncomfortable. I was something different from what you were used to. A man not at all like the men who had vied and were at present vying for your affections. I was not bound to your country's polite manner of conduct and it seemed, though for all you tried, that neither were you. We had met twice and twice I had managed to offend you, this I knew because this you told me without ever admitting you had been offended. I had been unable to paste myself to your words at your family gathering which must have hurt your pride - for who amongst your people had ever told you that your talent was anything short of wonderful? Offense number one. Number two, of course, being my inability to recall the name of a woman whom I had only ever met once and whom, in my defense, was only one of the many I had been introduced to that day. Also, to be fair, it was hard to remember much of anything after having endured Lucy Lefroy's... considerable singing talents in the parlor. I do, however, concede the point to the extent that, yes, I did fall asleep during your reading. There was no excuse for that but... good God, woman, there was writing on both sides of those pages. So, yes, you had every reason to ignore me, to keep walking as I called out to you - but once I was able to stop you from walking away from me, we spoke briefly of the woods we found ourselves in. I admitted to you that I found it unimpressive... nothing but mud and trees, perhaps offending you again by offending your country (admittedly, that was the point). I was a London man - by circumstance if not by birth, you see, and quite unable to understand why it was that anyone would choose to live so far away from, at least what I believed at the time to be, everything. You recommended (not so much a recommendation as it was an assignment) to me a book about the woods that I would later read - that you would later find me reading. That might have been the first clue as to my feelings for you. That not only would I never forget your name again, but that I should remember to read obscure book you had ever only mentioned to me once - and that you had not even mentioned by name. So yes, as I said, I was disappointed at the beginning of our second meeting... but by the end, oh by the end. Your manner, your words, your peculiar elegance and passion. There was something about you that I could not immediately disregard. You left me and I called to you - asking if I had offended you, and you, dear Lady, swore I did not. Yet you left me there alone and lost, a testament to just how not offended you were. I found it amusing and beguiling at the same time. I think back to that day... and though I did not know, though I could not have known at the time - you had somehow secured my heart irrevocably as your own during those few moments in the woods. I can not tell you that was when I knew I loved you, but I can tell you that I do now know that I loved you - not from the beginning as was previously admitted, but almost all along. *3* That night I lay staring up at the ceiling in my room at the Lefroys', thinking of many things. Contemplating my escape from Hampshire, my glorious return home. How I hated this place with it's somber grace - it's mundane predictability. Day in and day out everything was the same. Colourless and, please forgive me, ugly. My uncle, the judge, was teaching me a lesson, indeed (little did he know the cruel fate he had sealed for me in trying to teach me this lesson). And the lesson was this; I would have to practice a bit more discretion as I continued in my inappropriate behaviors with inappropriate company... lest I be sent away to live again in quiet and dull obscurity. Dull, colourless, and please forgive me again, ugly obscurity. Nothing had been interesting thus far in to my stay just as I had suspected nothing would be. And then, yes and then... I thought of you. Turning to my side, I tried to push the image of you - lovely, face flushed with embarrassed irritation - away. What were you doing in my head, I wondered. I had met many women in my life. Indeed I had... experienced many women, but never had my thoughts turned to any of them so unexpectedly. Yet there you were. I had been wrong a few moments before in my thinking, I realized - for one thing had been interesting, and that was it. You were interesting. I closed my eyes and again wished your face away, willing sleep to come. The sooner I fell asleep, the sooner it would be day. The sooner it was day, the sooner I could get on with all the boring redundancies the day had in store for me, and the sooner that was over with... the sooner I could get back to sleep. A few weeks worth of repetition of this and I would be home. Away from Hampshire. Away from the Lefroy's... And yes, away from you. The sooner the better. The ability to look back at the events in one's life with the perfect clarity of what was and the knowledge of what was still yet to be is an unfortunate circumstance of the human condition. For you see, I did not know it then - but I could not possibly leave soon enough. As I lay there in bed unable to put you from my thoughts... it was already too late. *4* We were late. Lucy, Mrs. Lefroy and I were late to the ball two or three nights later. My memory fails me yet again as I try to remember whose ball it was and why it was being thrown. Perhaps I can not remember because I was dizzy with the idea that I was going to be surrounded by dozens of country women - each of whom were going to expect a dancing partner of me. Each and every one of them just like Lucy. If there was any fun to be had at all that night, it would have been with your brother. I found him to be quite agreeable in London and hoped that he would show me the finer things Hampshire had to offer. If there were finer things. Which I doubted. The Lefroy ladies and I entered the ball room from the balcony above and I was just about to make my way to... I will never know where exactly I was planning on going because that was as far as my thought carried itself before I saw you below. I will admit to you now and never again that I was, at first, jealous to find you dancing with Mr. Wisley. I did not understand why I should feel this, but did not have to wonder for very long in any case. The feeling was fleeting as a moment after I felt the emotion Mr. Wisley had made the egregious error of using your foot as part of the dance floor. It was then impossible to be jealous of him. So I could only smile. You caught my eye just as I was laughing at the sight before me. My heart felt tight in my chest, but I kept smiling. For your part, you looked at me as though you hated me. And perhaps you did... but who other than you would have shown me? The confines of propriety required that you conceal feelings of dislike, but there you were. There your emotions were. I was fascinated by you, Miss Austen. You were an anomaly in a world where much of everything was indistinguishable from much of everything else. I made my way down to the ball room, in search of you - but once I made it to where I had previously seen you, you were no longer there. Another dance had started in front of me and I knew I had only a matter of moments to make my escape, past a line of young maidens standing idle - watching me as I walked away. I did not make eye contact with a single one of them, nor did I look back once I was clear of danger. I had risked the lion's den just to speak with you. Yet another clue as to my feelings even though I was as yet unaware of them. Quickly I found myself in search of your brother, perhaps he would know where you were. I had caught sight of him while still in peril on the ball room floor - him and your cousin, Eliza Freullide, on the opposite side of the balcony from where I had come. What an odd pair the two of them made, but how I envy them now. To have the means and position to be with the one you love. It is something so few of us have. What I found on that balcony was not what I had expected, however - you stood with your back to me, talking to your brother and cousin. There it was, that feeling in my chest again. Nervousness? Excitement? What it was exactly, I did not know and I did not wish to examine the condition past the point of curiosity. They tried to warn you, didn't they, Jane? Even now I can smile at that. Jane... Jane, your brother had said. You ignored him. You went on speaking; went on insulting me. Were all his friends as disagreeable as I? And just where in Ireland was I from? Limerick, you learned, is where I was from in Ireland, and you learned it from me - me who happened to be standing behind you. You must have been surprised. You mentioned me declining to dance so you had no doubt seen me narrowly escape with my life from the sea of husbandless women - thinking me a safe distance away. You turned around to look at me, face pale. I had given you no reason to like me or speak well of me, indeed I had done the opposite - but you felt guilty anyway. I am certain of it. I was bothered by your opinion of me, but I do confess to being curious as to the emotion from which it originated. Was it is the same emotion that urged me to ask you to dance even though you had not three seconds prior made your dislike for me abundantly clear? And how amusing it was escorting you down the steps, your eyes cast downward, diverted to the side or to the ceiling - anywhere but on me. If you had looked, you would have been unhappy to note the grin on my face. For it had been you, had it not, that had been judging my refusal to dance as, shall we say, undiplomatic. How could you have turned me down without seeming a hypocrite? Not one word was spoken on our way down and I have no way of knowing what you were thinking, but I do imagine it was something along those lines. I am sorry, but it was not in my nature to turn down an opportunity such as I found just then. A man, after all, has to make his own fun. You did dance well - even while keeping up with me in conversation. I feigned to be forgetful of your name once again, just to tease you - but you, without missing a beat, did the same to me. I could have laughed. We spoke many words, all amounting to the equivalent of calling one another arrogant. I suspected you felt yourself above your peers (and if you did you did rightly so). Although, if I had known that this would be one of only two times I would ever dance with you, I would have kept my words to myself, my eyes on you... and I would have danced with you all night. Instead, when the music ended I walked away from you and you from me - leaving the others to clap politely at the one hundredth of one hundred identical dances they had accomplished in their lives. And yet... we did find our way back to each other through out the night. Allow me to apologize most sincerely for any unwanted attention it may have brought you. No doubt your mother had something to say about it. Mr. Wisley and his aunt, with their eyes so permanently affixed to your person, must have noticed as well. You must have wondered why, just as I wondered why. Why should I want to be near you who disliked me? Who had not a kind word to say to me? You with your dull writings and your... irritatingly innocent eyes. I was not even sure if my opinion of you was any higher than yours of me. Why was I drawn to you so? Three... or four instances was it? Instances in which we found ourselves near to each other. Each time you had more to say about my elevated airs and I of your pious indignity. You were wonderfully antagonistic and I am sorry to say that I did enjoy the spark of anger in your eyes every time I said something you did not wish to hear. I found that I was enjoying myself for the first time since my arrival nearly a week before. For the first time, I was glad not to be in London. *5* My mother had once told me that in life we must make our choices with enough courage to support our conviction and accept the consequences of those choices with a smile... whether those consequences be good or bad. For once a decision is made it can not, for all intents and purposes, be unmade. This was in response to my inquiring as to why she had married my father who was so many stations below her. Penniless as he was, she loved my father with as deep conviction as could be had, and good or bad, she accepted whatever else came. When the opportunity arose to stay in London with my uncle, to learn the law, to aid my mother and father in their financial responsibilities, I knew it was my duty to accept. And in accepting, the weight of my family came to be fully upon my shoulders. I made this choice with conviction as my mother had taught me... but I did not know you then. I was young and did not quite yet understand my mother's true lesson. That I would have to live with that decision and the consequences of that decision for the rest of my life. Decisions can not be undone. There was no changing the past. So you see, it is exactly how I have said. Our lives are not our own. It was decided long before we met that we could not be together, and through decisions that had nothing to do with us. I often wonder what I would have done had I ever had the opportunity to go back and do things differently - exactly what my mother had warned me about. A man could drive himself mad wondering what might have been, but I have wondered and do still wonder. I know, had it been you, if you were me - you would have changed nothing. You would have helped your family without question or protest knowing full well we would never be together. You are a better person than I... For I do not know for certain that I could do the same. *6* When the ball was over and I was again back in my room and in bed, I amused myself with the recent memory of Lucy pouting jealously in the carriage ride back home. She had begun to question me about my interest in you, but her mother quickly cut her off, as seemed to be her way. Poor, dear, annoying little Lucy. Too young to be considered ridiculous in her behavior, but old enough to suffer the pain of unrequited infatuation. I did care for her though, I realized. Being one of eleven surviving children, I found that I had almost missed being incessantly bothered by a younger relation... But I did not want to think about my siblings. I closed my eyes, no longer amused. This place, this house, these people - they all served as reminders of what it was exactly that depended on me. I was here even now to learn to meaning of... what had my uncle said? Prudence. To learn prudence. And for what? To make myself worthy enough to inherit what was his. For my family. I did all this for my family. And, for all the love I had for them, I admit to you - shamefully - that I hated them as well. Forever trying to crawl out from behind the shadow of poverty, forever defending my mother's actions, and always, always, fighting to keep food on the plates of my brothers and sisters. So no, I did not wish to think of these things just then. I never wanted to think of them, truth be told. I preferred to perform my duty quietly and go on with my life as though it were not a very large portion of my life. And so, I tried to push these thoughts to the very back of my consciousness - as far back as I could manage, which was where they usually stayed. It was, however, proving to be particularly difficult in this instance. Perhaps because I was becoming increasingly aware I was on the threshold of disaster in regards to my uncle and the money he afforded me. The majority of the time I could ignore the fact that my family and I relied completely on his rather conditional benefaction - but the situation I was in did lend itself most incontrovertibly to a very deep understanding that my uncle could, and indeed would, strip me of everything if I displeased him. I realized quite plainly that I had been wrong about my uncle's lesson to me when I had thought it over some nights before. It was not, as I had previously mused, that I must learn how to get away with being myself... It was that I must learn to be someone else. I let out a sound of exasperation and threw my legs over the side of the bed. I remember running my hands through my hair, resting my head in my palms - knowing I would not sleep well that night. So I stood up, lit a candle... and made my way quietly to the library. It should not be a great mystery which book I searched for to take from the shelves. *7* By the time I had awaken the next morning I had already suffered a few minor embarrassments during my as yet short stay in Hampshire. Shooting my uncle's gun off in to the walls of his cellar, for instance. Falling backward on the seat of my very expensive pants as I called out to you in the woods, for another. These types of things, given my nature, were easily brushed aside the moment after they had occurred - the embarrassment fading away almost as swiftly as it had come. Usually the feeling was replaced by another emotion all together such as amusement or irritation. As I woke up in my night clothes on the arm chair in my uncle's library, my uncle and aunt staring at me with concern... I knew this would not be one of those instances. After a brief moment of confusion, I sat up abruptly. \"Uncle.\" I said quickly - nodding my head in something of a bow to my aunt. \"If you you found your room to be other than accommodating in some way, surely something else could have been done about it.\" My uncle responded. \"Uncle, I--\" \"Is Tom in here?\" I heard Lucy's voice come from the doorway. I closed my eyes briefly, biting down on my jaw. The girl seemed to be in constant search of me - why should this moment be any different? \"Lucy--\" Her mother started to warn her, but it was too late. There she stood in front of me, eyes wide - grin wider. \"Tom?\" I pulled my robe tighter around me. \"Come, Lucy.\" Her mother said, pulling her away. \"But I--\" Their voices trailed away and I heard the library door close behind them. My uncle took a deep breath and sat down near me. \"How are you enjoying your stay here, Tom?\" \"Well enough, sir.\" I responded, having nothing more to say on the subject just then. \"Glad to hear it.\" He said, then a pause. \"I know that your coming here was not exactly your idea and that adjusting to country life when you are clearly quite accustomed to city living, must be quite difficult. Having said that, Tom, I really must insist that you put in the effort.\" \"Yes, uncle.\" I said, somehow knowing this had to do with more than just the discovery of me asleep in an arm chair. Perhaps I had been acting just a bit... aloof. For the previous three years I had divided my time between being quietly absorbed in study (yes, Jane, I did study) and things of a more diverting nature. It was, none of it, spent cultivating personal relationships or learning to be interested in the lives of others. I was respected in London, sought out after. The nephew of a successful and affluent judge. Three years of that and now Hampshire - it was difficult readjusting my behavior. \"We are very happy to have you...\" he continued. \"But I am sure that a young man such as yourself could easily find better ways to direct your restless energy than roaming around aimlessly through the night.\" I nodded. \"Of course.\" \"You are, after all, only here for the summer. Why not make the best out of it?\" I nodded. \"Yes, of course, uncle.\" Was really all I could say. He took a deep breath and nodded as well. He stood up. \"Will you go calling this morning?\" He asked, seemingly from nowhere. I must have looked confused. \"I had not thought of doing so...\" \"Well, I am uncertain of the customs of Ireland or, indeed, even of London... but here, when a young man dances with a young woman at a ball it is considered polite to call on her the next day.\" It may well have been a custom in both London and Ireland, but I did not know - and for certain it was one custom I had never observed. It seemed to be just a bit ridiculous when a man could possibly dance with many several women at a ball. Should he have to call on all of them the next day? I voiced this question to my uncle who merely said; \"Perhaps it is lucky for you that only danced with one young woman, then.\" He smiled, and I got the distinct feeling that he was teasing me a bit. \"Indeed.\" I responded dryly. My uncle bowed and left me alone once again in the library. I sunk back in the chair and ran my hand over my face... I supposed I was obliged to pay you a visit. *8* \"Mr. Tom and Mr. George Lefroy for you, Miss.\" I heard the maid speak to someone in the parlor. I had brought George as something of a chaperone so no one could get the wrong idea from my calling on you. I was not to be teased over this. \"Mr. Lefroy?\" It was you, and you seemed none too happy. I smiled to myself for I had assumed your reaction would be something to that effect. The maid looked to George and I and gestured for us to enter the parlor. There you were, sitting daintily with your hands folded neatly in your lap. The maid curtseyed and was gone. George and I bowed. \"Miss Austen.\" I said. George addressed you as well. \"George.\" You said with a smile, and then looked to me with a bit less of a smile. \"Mr. Lefroy. Please, sit down.\" You offered, feigning courtesy when I knew you hated me for being there. \"I am told paying you call would be only polite as you were so kind to favor me with a dance yesterday evening.\" \"Well, I must admit I would not have expected you to follow such--\" \"Provincial rules of conduct?\" I finished for you. You smiled a smile that was almost more of a grimace. This was turning out to be quite an amusing opportunity... for I knew you had many things to say to me that George's presence would prevent you from. I, on the other hand, could goad you as I wished. You turned to George. \"George, so kind of you to accompany Mr. Lefroy here today. How are things at Ashe?\" \"Quite fine, Miss Austen. Thank you for inquiring.\" Silence. I could have laughed. \"Tell me,\" I started finally. \"How is your novel coming? Have you yet... accomplished what you meant to?\" The irritation on your face was plain. \"I have accomplished nothing.\" You responded, then looked down for a moment of subtle frustration. That had not been what you meant at all, but it was what you said. \"What I mean is, it is not done - but it is coming along rather well.\" \"Oh, I am very happy to hear it. There are so few successful feminine writers, but who knows? We could be sitting here now with the next Mrs. Ann Radcliffe.\" \"Mrs. Ann Radcliffe?\" You asked, seeming surprised. \"You have read The Mysteries of Udolpho ?\" I nodded. \"Mmm.\" I said. \"Prose are a bit weak in my opinion, but that is to be expected, of course. She could only write of that which she is immediately familiar - so we get much of nature and of the heroine Emily St. Aubert fainting. It does get to be a bit redundant. f?\" How you did not narrow your eyes at me, I shall never know. You only looked at me, blank faced - doing quite a job at concealing the anger I know you must have been feeling. \"Which is not to say that you are to follow in her footsteps. You might well be a surprise.\" \"Forgive me for saying so, Mr. Lefroy, but could it be possible that you could not understand the deeper meaning of the book?\" You asked, and I said nothing. \"It was sentimental and gothic. The heroine endured travesty after travesty and still remained a good person in the end. I can see how someone of limited literary knowledge may have scarcely understood the point... which is not to suggest you are such a person.\" I did not have to think of anything to say in response to you, for your brother walked in just at that moment. \"Lefroy!\" He said. \"I thought it was you.\" I stood and shook his hand. \"Austen.\" I said. \"What brings you here? Don't tell me you've come to visit my sister? That would be down right polite of you.\" \"Oh, yes.\" You interrupted, standing as well. \"Mr. Lefroy is very kind and polite, indeed, to grace us with his presence.\" \"Indeed.\" You rolled your eyes and looked away from us. \"Will you be joining us at picnic tomorrow? Perhaps join in at the cricket match?\" \"Henry...\" You said. \"I am sure a man of such high class metropolitan upbringing would find our country picnics very dull.\" \"Oh, no.\" I said. \"You are mistaken. Just this morning my uncle was suggesting that I immerse myself more in country life. I would be delighted to come.\" I met your eyes. \"I am actually quite good at cricket.\" *9* And, as it turns out, so were you. It was a beautiful day... honestly the kind of day one could not expect to see in London. Perhaps in Limerick, when it stopped raining long enough - but not London. Not in a metropolis where one could not hope for a patch of green grass outside of a park, much less an open field on which games such as cricket could be played. There were other diversions to be had in the city, amusements of a somewhat questionable variety... but nothing such as this. Not for a person such as me. I confess I never would have expected to see you walking toward me with a bat in hand... but, yes, you did turn out to be quite good. Something I might have guessed when you took up Mr. Wisley's turn upon his refusal to take it up himself. I thought, perhaps, you believed you had something to prove to me - that a woman could do anything that a man could and just as well. I was intrigued, but not impressed, by your forwardness. By the way you seemed not even to notice the look of stunned propriety on your mother's face and the way all the other ladies in attendance gasped. Why must we all drop our jaws and divert our eyes when a lady chooses to do something other than sit daintily under a parasol and fan at herself? Is that not irony? If it ever seemed to you, to anyone for that matter, that I believed women to be below me or incapable in any way, it was not so. It was my opinion that a woman could have and do whatever she wanted the same as a man could. It seemed to me, though, that women generally - while perhaps wanting to be considered as equal to men - remained comfortable in their confinement. Freedom belonged to everyone and was there for the taking... but freedom is not always an easy thing to have. As in all things, the bad comes right along with the good. You can not choose to play a man's game while still hiding safely behind the rules and obligations that keep you happy and comfortable and expect to be considered an equal. To anyone. You yourself once had said that you did not devise the scruples by which you lived, but were obliged to obey them. You playing against me in the cricket match seemed to me to be an exercise in hypocrisy. I would give you your credit where your credit was due, but in this instance there was none. This was when I became partially aware of my feelings for you. You wanted to be something other than what your surroundings had made you. Jane, you were lovely and brilliant already, but you wanted something more. I could see it in you. The potential. You wanted to be different and that made you different. If you could me mine for only a moment, I would let you flourish. I wanted to corrupt you without ruining you. I wanted to open you up and let you spill out on to the world. To be whatever it was that you were trying to be. But you would most likely never let me, and I would most likely never try. So as I sat for a moment on the ground after you had just won your team the match, I found myself feeling a bit annoyed. Annoyed because I expected so much more from you than I ever could have hoped to receive. You were better than your circumstances, and yet... and yet. I did not know. Also, you did just beat me at cricket. I let my irritation fade away and stood up, mentioning that it was obvious you had played the game before, allowing you to have your satisfaction. A few moments later Henry and I were racing down the hill to a bit of river for a swim. You and Eliza followed us - running almost as fast as we. Of this I was very aware. I was undressed completely by the time you made it down to us. I could feel your embarrassed eyes upon me... and then I knew you were gone. If you really wanted to prove to me that you could be my equal in all things, you would have jumped in that river with me. I knew you would not, but hoped that you would. To experience something for yourself. Something other than obligations or minor acts of dissent. A writer could not write of what they did not know - so how could you ever hope to be a writer when you knew nothing? Your world was a very small place. *10* \"I've warned my sister about you.\" Henry said to me as we prepared to make our way back up the hill. I laughed as I pulled a boot on. \"Only you?\" I asked. \"And only your sister? I am disappointed. I had hoped that the whole of the female population of Hampshire would have been warned about me by now.\" I paused. \"Twice.\" Another pause. \"By everyone.\" Henry smiled and shook his head. \"I am afraid that is mostly likely not far away from the truth.\" \"Ah, then I've succeeded.\" I clapped Henry on the shoulder with a laugh and, being fully dressed, we began back up the hill to where everyone awaited our return. \"She is my sister, Tom.\" Henry warned, but in a friendly enough way. \"Yes, I know.\" I sighed. \"I just do not wish her heart to become one of the many in your collection.\" \"Do not worry, Austen. My intentions toward your sister should be of little concern to your or anyone.\" \"And yet, why do I still worry?\" I stopped and faced him. He stopped as well. \"Why, indeed?\" I asked. \"Believe me, even if your sister did come off of that pedestal she's placed herself on long enough to decide I am not the horrible creature she imagines me to be, she is not exactly the type of company I am known to keep. Furthermore, it does not matter because I am gone by summer's end...\" I shrugged slightly. \"Yes, and I have had the opportunity to see for myself that that happens to be more than enough time for you.\" He responded. I let out a noise of irritation as I rolled my eyes - about to say something, but he continued to speak. \"As for what she thinks of you, no one can speak better of her feelings than her herself - but I know her, and I can assure you her behavior does speak contrary to her words.\" \"And I seldom have the opportunity to observe either so allow me to assure--\" \"Lefroy--\" Whatever he was going to say, I do not know for I cut him off quite a bit more sharply than I meant to \" Allow me to assure you...\" I trailed off for a moment, and took a deep breath. Your brother only looked at me with a concerned confusion. He had not meant to upset me, I know. I was not even sure of why he had. I regained my briefly lost composure and began to speak again. \"Forgive me.\" \"Of course.\" He said. I let out a breath of air with an amiable smile and we continued on our way. \"You must understand, it is just because I care for Jane that I feel I must to say these things to you.\" \"I am fully aware that I have a reputation.\" I started. \"But you forget that I am here at my uncle's insistence to learn how to behave as an upright man of the law. I am doing my best to keep out of trouble.\" \"Yes, and how are finding it?\" \"Oh, quite effortless.\" I said with a serious frown. \"While I'm asleep anyway. I have yet to figure out how to get on while I'm awake.\" Henry laughed shortly. \"If your uncle only knew you.\" I winced. \"Let us hope it never comes to that.\" *11* I searched for you when we returned to the picnic, if for no other reason to apologize for having undressed so abruptly in front of you. There had been many things running through my thoughts at the time, and none of them had been your or Eliza's reputation. Your brother may not have realized you two had been following us, but as I said before, I had been aware. And also, my dear... my dear sweet Jane... I desired to see the flush that would no doubt cover your cheeks as I broached the subject. Would you deny having seen me? Would you think me impudent for bringing it up? I tried not to think such things, for such things led to a certain behavior that always seemed to get me in to the kind of trouble that I had just been speaking to your brother about. I found that I could not help myself. You see, your brother had enlightened me to a fact of which I had been previously ignorant. He believed your opinion to be higher of me than you would have had me believe. But you were no longer there to apologize to. We were informed that you, Eliza and your mother had taken your leave whilst Henry and I were still at the river. Though it was a bit disappointing, I could not keep myself from smiling. You had left to avoid me, to avoid having to acknowledge what had occurred. I did not doubt it at all. And if my thoughts turned to you once again as I lay in bed that night, I wondered... would you be thinking of me as well? *****[Chapter 2] There You Were Part I: Hampshire Chapter II *1* It was several days before we spoke again. I did see you, once, walking alone in the woods. When I had begged leave of my uncle and aunt that afternoon to go for a walk, I confess to having hoped for exactly that. Something told me that your previous unaccompanied amble had not been a solitary occurrence and that there was a possibility that I might encounter you again. I was walking for nearly an hour before I saw you. I had been stopped just off the path, by a pebble in my shoe. I had just slipped it back on when I looked up and was obliged to smile... For there you were. Your back was to me as you walked away, so you must have walked right past me without either of us noticing. I made move to approach you, but before I could I became aware that you were humming softly to yourself. A familiar tune that I recognized from... from where? I knew it, I was sure. I closed my eyes for a moment as I tried to remember. So familiar, and not just the notes. Soft. Feminine. Warm. I opened my eyes. Why were you humming a tune from Ireland, Jane? A favorite of my youngest sister, Anne, I was a bit surprised that I had not known it right away - even if it had been years since I had been home to Limerick. My mother sometimes murmured the melody to her when she was having trouble sleeping. From where had you picked it up? I watched you recede in the distance, feeling a distinct and not all together pleasant tightening of my chest. I turned slowly in the opposite direction of where ever it was that you were headed, and I walked away. *2* I sat comfortably once again in my uncle's arm chair in the library, feeling that the late morning was a much more appropriate time for reading than the late night. While I had pulled your book from the shelves many nights previous I had not had a chance to look through it until this day. Relatively well written, the book lacked charm. It was boring and grey much the same as the land it favoured, but it was easy to see why you would enjoy it. It was also easy to see why I had fallen dead asleep while trying to read it. Pretty words delicately crafted to dull perfection and pieced together to create mind-numbing prose. It might well have been the book you would have written of Selbourne Wood had you ever had the inclination. Talent, if you'll excuse the contradiction, is not always equal to skill. Ah, but I did come to an interesting scene in the book which you would never have written. A description of the mating habits of a particular bird... Awkward in it's displacement, I had to chuckle when I read over it. I imagined you reading the same passage, blushing over Mr. Wyatt's diction. If you could not find sanctuary even in your tedious books, where could you turn? A barely discernible creak from the shelves above me alerted me to someone's presence. I looked up and stood. Lucy, no doubt, spying on me again. There was another creak, louder this time, and I made my way around the book shelf in time to witness your, and to my pleasure not Lucy's, attempt at a quiet retreat. It occurred to me briefly to let you go, but seeing the expression on your face when you'd realized you had been caught was so much more important. So it was only a step, maybe two, I had allowed you to gain before I said your name. Miss Austen. You spun to face me, feigned delight and surprise at my \"sudden\" appearance when you and I both knew you had already been aware that I was in the room. Ah, Mr. Lefroy... as though you had been searching for me. As though we were friends. I could not, for many reasons I suppose, hold back a smile as I bowed to you. It must have been hard to see me again after having seen me so compromised at the river. You curtseyed in return and before I was able to speak another word, you commented upon, perhaps, the first safe thing you could. The book in my hand. Your book. I could detect a bit of astonishment in your demeanor for an instant. Oh, you had said. Quite probably wondering, as I did, how I had managed to remember the book and why I had elected to read it. The astonishment disappeared, naturally, when you asked and I told you what I thought of it. Disturbing? I give you credit for not rolling your eyes at me as you so obviously wanted to, but yes... disturbing. I chose the word to tease you, of course, and I almost - almost - left it at that. But how could I? You listened attentively, nervously I would say, as I read the interesting passage I had found aloud to you. You stood before me fidgeting with your fingers, I could see from out of my periphery vision as I approached you slowly. I drew the words out protractedly, letting you cling to them. Allowing you to understand what it was I was reading about. I stopped, though, just as I got to the sentence that would leave no room for confusion. I read it to myself once again. It wasn't appropriate, but you bade me continue. I looked up at you from the book, meeting your eyes. You wanted to hear but perhaps you did not know what was coming. Perhaps you did. I like to think you did. I looked down at the book and finished the last sentence, meeting your eyes once again as the word ecstasy left my mouth. I wanted to look at you as I said it. I could not have hoped for a better, nor could I have enjoyed more another, reaction from you. You stared in to my eyes saying nothing, breathing just a bit harder than moments before. What must you have been thinking? I believe I would have given most anything to know your thoughts just then. Drawing the moment out a little longer, I inquired as to the frequency of such occurrences in Hampshire - leaving you to infer as to my full meaning. You sputtered unintelligibly and I had to laugh. You were ignorant to the ways of the world; my world. My usage of \"Ignorance\" as a means by which to describe your predicament seemed to break my temporary hold over you. I followed you as you walked away from me, busying yourself with a newly urgent desire to look over the shelves of books. I tried to advise you on your writing, speaking to you the thoughts I had mused over the day of the cricket match. You were in need of experience and until that experience was had you could expect your writing to remain beautiful, but hollow. What qualified me to offer this advice? You wanted to know. What did you expect me to say? My reputation had preceded me many times with regard to you, so there was nothing I could tell you that you did not already know. Specifics, perhaps, were undisclosed to you as propriety commanded... but a scandalous reputation speaks volumes about a person. You knew I was no virgin. You knew I was no great bastion of morality. All I could say in response to you was, essentially, that I knew more of the world. A great deal more, you commented with a forced laugh. Were you actually trying to offend me? I did get the feeling that an emotion quite near to jealousy had formed those words in your mouth. I thought back to my conversation with your brother. You did like me, of this I was almost certain... and even if I did not exactly know what it was I felt for you, I knew my interest in your exceeded the limits of aid and advise. I did not agree aloud that I knew a great deal more than you, but did say that I knew enough. Enough to know that your horizons did need to be... I paused before I finished the statement. A moment to think of a word that was suggestive enough by nature, but perfectly innocuous. Widened. The word was so suited to the message I meant to convey, I could not help but smile as I turned from you and went to the other side of the book shelf. It was my turn to recommend a bit of reading to you and when you were standing rather suddenly in front of me again, I had it ready for you. What ever words of reprove you had for me were lost on your tongue as your face came so very near to mine. I was able to tell you to read it explaining that it would help you understand what I meant. I was even able to bow before I walked away from you. That was all I could manage for, you see, you were not the only one effected by our close proximity. Had I stayed a moment longer, my lips would have found their way to yours and I might have kissed you until one of us could no longer breathe. Since I was out of the library and away from you before I could examine the desire more closely, I decided it had been only a temporary lapse in judgment. It had been weeks since I had last kissed anyone and that, for me, was quite a long time. I had wanted you because you had been standing in front of me. Nothing more. *3* I stared out at the garden from my window - watching the day fade away to darkness. It had been a week, perhaps longer, since I had seen or spoken to you. My days had been filled with listening to Lucy practice her singing and one or two dinner parties. I had escorted the Lefroy ladies to the market on a Tuesday and then on a walk on a Friday - both in hopes of spotting you. I was curious as to how you were finding Mr. Fielding's history as opposed to Mr. Wyatt's. Also, for some reason, I missed your company. Whenever I was not preoccupied with another task, which was often, I thought of you. Your wide brown eyes (still irritatingly innocent) laughing at me or, more often, chiding me. Your perpetually flushed cheeks. Your... mouth. Your lips, so full and red - the way they moved as you spoke. The topics you spoke of. How was it that there was a book written about wretched Selbourne Wood when there was none of you - lovelier and drastically more interesting? How was it that there were no pieces of music meant to sing your praise or works of art meant to capture your beauty? I put my hand over my face at this thought and rubbed my eyes. These things were very nice to think of someone whom I found annoying, pretentious and ignorant. Very nice things, indeed. There was a knock at my door. I furrowed my forehead and looked toward it. \"Come in.\" The door opened and in walked a servant with a small silver platter - and on the platter was a letter. \"A letter for you, sir.\" The woman said with a curtsey. I stood and walked over to her, nodding my head at her briefly as I took the letter - excusing her from my presence. She curtseyed again and was gone. For a moment I had hoped it was from you, but pushed the hope aside immediately. Breaking the wax seal and opening the letter I could recognize right away the handwriting of my uncle. I sighed, raising my eyes toward the ceiling, and then walked back over to my window where I sat down again. I held the letter in my hand for a minute or two without reading it, knowing instinctually what it said. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath - opening my eyes again I turned my attention toward the words before me. Thomas, I do hope that your time in the country has served you well and that this letter finds you a changed man. I am arranging your transport back to London for an estimated arrival date of the 6th of July. Judge Langlois Quite short and quite to the point... my lesson was over, and I was to return back to London within four days time. I refolded the letter, feelings of confusion overwhelming me. This was what I wanted - what I had been wanting since the moment I stepped foot here. I was returning to London and back to my life. Back to what I knew. I should have felt ecstatic and overjoyed... But my confusion stemmed from the fact that, for all I wished to, I did not feel these things at all. Instead all I felt was a dull ache in the middle of my chest and a vague sense of... loss. But what, I asked myself, was I losing? *4* I had lost my ability to believe in God at a young age - long holding the belief that God was a luxury of the rich... as so many things seemed to be. I mostly kept this opinion to myself, though on rare occasions would make it known. Once, for instance, I had been sitting next to my mother and siblings at a Sunday morning service and it had suddenly come upon me to stand up and leave. As this was a small chapel and the reverend happened to be in the middle of his homily at the same time, my rather unexpected exodus had escaped the notice of few if any. Suffice it to say I did receive a rather vigorous reprimand for my behavior. After that I attended service every Sunday with my family until 1793 when I went to stay with my uncle in London. By the time of our meeting, Jane, I had not been near a church for three years. *5* I sat quietly on the last pew in the small chapel, listening to your father speak. Well, I could hear him speak but I do not know how much I was listening. I was distracted by the back of your neck, which was all I could see of you from my vantage point. It was enough... just to know you were there. Enough to make me happy. Enough to tear me apart. If I stopped long enough to think about why I was there, I would have thought it strange. I had come to see you. Not to speak with you. Not to interact with you in any way. Only to see you. Whatever it was between us was soon to be at an end and it was, for some reason beyond me, important that I take in the sight of you as much as I could. I wanted to remember you. Beautiful, horrible, wonderful, irritating, lovely, tempestuous, passionate... Jane. My Jane. My... friend Jane. In just three days time, I would see you once more and then never again. When the sermon was done and the service over, I did not wait to be excused before leaving. I did not wish to be obliged to converse with anyone just then and so I walked away from the church to the nearby brook. I had grown up near the Shannon River in Ireland had not noticed until my time in Hampshire how serene the sound of water really was. There was nothing like this in London. No trees or streams. Just people and reputations. I had had three years to make myself believe that was the life for me, and it took less than two months for me to realize it was not. That perhaps it had never been. I stared over the river thinking to myself that this land did have a way of becoming familiar. Indeed, a very peculiar way of feeling like home. I had never expected to become attached to anything here, and was quite dismayed to find that there were very few things to which I had not. I took a deep breath and squinted my eyes against the early morning sun. It was difficult to think that my time here was coming to an end. I had not wanted to come to the country, had wanted it even less when I arrived... but now. Now things were different, and at that moment I made the decision not to tell you I was leaving. If you did not know, then I could imagine as though it were not so. You could help me convince myself for a short while. Then I heard your voice. You had read the book I had recommended, but what was infinitely more important was that you had sought me out to tell me. It was the first time you had done so. I smiled a small smile to myself and turned around to face you. A bow and an address from me and just a reiteration that you had read my book and subsequently disapproved of it from you. Of course you disapproved, I had not expected you to like it. I must say you surprised me by reading past the first pages. I found that you surprised me quite often. The conversation over the book lasted for some minutes, but somehow Lucy had found us just as we were speaking of the trouble that my hero had gotten himself in to. She seemed suspicious as she asked us to what sort of trouble we refereed. I shall never forget the mischievous smile on your face as you answered her question but seemed to direct the answer at me. I can remember your face better than the words you spoke. All kinds of trouble, all sorts of trouble. Something to that effect. The words were for her. The smile was for me. Another first. It was enough to make me forget, for a moment, the rather unpleasant reality that faced me. You walked away, presumably in search of your brother as you ended up in front of him and Eliza, and I followed. \"Henry.\" I bowed, then to Eliza. \"Madame Freullide.\" \"What do you say, Henry,\" You started. \"Shall we show our friend Mr. Lefroy what he has been missing of the country?\" I looked at Henry with a look of puzzled question. He looked at me, then back to you and cleared his throat. \"I don't know, Jane. Mr. Lefroy has seen a great deal.\" He paused, looking at me again. \"Is that not what you told me our last night in London, Tom?\" I laughed, remembering as he listed things we could have done that night, that I had seen and done all of them at least once. Some of them quite disreputable. His brotherly instinct to protect you from me seemed very easily provoked. I knew he liked me well enough, but that did not mean he approved of me. \"Yes, but that was London.\" I responded. \"I have seen very few things of interest in the country.\" I meant something different for you than I meant for your brother. While it was true that I had seen very few interesting things in the country it was also true that I had seen very few.. . interesting things in the country. I am certain he understood. \"The place I have in mind is nearly half a day's walk from here.\" You said. I smiled. \"Well then it is lucky that we shall not have to walk.\" \"Tell me, Mr. Lefroy... have you ever been to Laverton?\" \"Laverton?\" I asked. \"The Laverton fair?\" Henry asked you, sounding as though his interest had been piqued. You looked at him and nodded. Henry turned to me with a grin. \"Well, this should be fun. Plenty of trouble to watch you try to stay out of there.\" Eliza laughed as she and Henry walked away. You began to follow but I stopped you by placing my hand gently over your arm, bringing you to a halt. You turned to me and the look in your eyes as well as the soft contact caused my heart to beat more rapidly - even you seemed taken aback by my forwardness. I had done it because I was comfortable with you, forgetting that it was against many rules of conduct and propriety. I was not your husband or fiancé, I had not known you since infancy - nor were we of any relation. I had no place to take such a liberty. I swallowed and took my hand away from you. \"I... I'm sorry.\" I said. \"It's all right.\" You said, but there was something in your voice that said otherwise. \"Was there something you wanted?\" I nodded, my eyes slowly trying to find their way back to yours. \"Where exactly is it that we are going?\" You shrugged just slightly. \"It's a secret, Mr. Lefroy.\" You said. Were you flirting with me, Jane? I met your eyes with curiosity. \"A secret?\" \"Yes, you've heard of those. A circumstance in which I know something that you do not know.\" \"Is that not the definition of irony?\" I asked with a laugh. You were about to say something - perhaps lecture me on my misuse of literary terms - when Lucy again was upon us. \"Can I come, Jane?\" She asked. \"Mother will allow it if Tom escorts me.\" You looked to me. \"Tom?\" You asked. You said my name, my forename. It came from your mouth so casually, I was not even sure that you had noticed. But I noticed. \"Er, yes.\" I looked down at Lucy. \"I would honored to escort such a beautiful young lady to...\" I looked at you, hoping for a hint as to what this Laverton fair was. \"It's a secret.\" You said to Lucy. She smiled excitedly. \"I love secrets.\" The two of you walked away arm in arm and I stood where I was for just a moment. Perhaps good things could come from attending church after all. *6* That night at the fair, to this day, Jane, to this very moment, was the most fun I have ever had in my life. Not because of the fire breathers or the men on stilts or the alcohol or the women. I had seen all these things before - many times before. Many times since. The reason I shall never forget that night is, well, that should be apparent. Even though I escorted Lucy and she clung to me most ardently for the majority of the time we spent at the fair, it was you I was there with. Yet another first for the day; the first time we ever spent any real time together. We had seen each other in passing, at parties, at balls - chance encounters every so often. But this, this was different. You and I outside the confines of Steventon or Ashe and there together of our own choosing. I do not pretend not to have been surprised by your taking me to such a gathering of ostentacious display, but it only made you more interesting. You had asked me... something. Was there fun enough there for me? Entertainment? Trouble? I am not quite sure which, but since there was an excess of all three, I said yes. Yes there was, and freedom - the kind that almost always only a man could enjoy. Every way you looked there was some one doing something they wanted just because they wanted to do it. Men making salacious spectacles of themselves, surrounded by women whom they must have paid for. Now that, I had also seen many times before. I asked you if you envied this freedom of men, perhaps because I did. While I could make a show of being free and doing as I pleased, I was still very much shackled to others' dependancies and expectations. As, I suppose, were you. \"What will your mother say when you arrive back home?\" I asked jokingly as we wove our way through out the crowds. \"Oh, she will not say anything to me, I suspect.\" You answered. \"She will speak of her disapproval to my father as she invariably seems to do, and then he will speak to me.\" \"About?\" You did not answer right away, which made me wonder if it was not me that he would be speaking to you about. \"My prospects, I suppose.\" \"You mean Wisley.\" You laughed a sound of annoyance. \"Does everyone know of his attentions toward me?\" You asked. \"I would sooner marry the Biggwither boy before attaching myself to such a spiritless man as Mr. Wisley.\" \"Such words of disdain, Miss Austen. What has he done to earn them?\" You took a deep breath, seeming to regret speaking so harshly of a man who had not, as far as I knew, done anything ill against you. \"For all I know of him, he is a kind and honorable man - but he thinks that his wealth will buy him anything he pleases, and that has made him... indolent. He could have all the money in the world and could still not hope to buy me with it.\" \"And what might a man hope to buy you with?\" I asked, not knowing why I did so. You looked at me and seemed to have no words of response, I was not sure if I had offended you. I blinked and looked away. \"I apologize, I did not mean to--\" \"No, I...\" You shook your head and seemed to search for an answer. \"Honestly, I hope never to be bought - or won. That would imply an ownership of some sort, would it not?\" I smiled a small smile that you may not have even noticed. \"I have always imagined marriage as something more of a partnership.\" You continued. \"My mother and father married for love and that is what I intend to do.\" You paused. \"If I marry at all.\" I laughed. \"You would choose to be an old maid?\" \"There are worse fates.\" You answered. \"Well, I suppose opinion would differ in regard to that, depending on who you are speaking with.\" You looked at me, growing annoyed I could see. \"Yes? And what is yours?\" I looked at you, the smile fading from my face. \"I have no opinion.\" I answered gravely, having no desire to delve further in to the subject. The truth was that I had very strong opinions on the matter, but I was not ready nor was I willing to share them with you. My parents had also married for love and so I could see the merit in it, but I could also see the trouble. You had not experienced poverty to the extent which I had - and poverty, Jane, is among one of the worst fates imaginable. Indeed, when there are hungry mouths and greedy land lords depending on you, I can think of no worse. I was not sure if whether that meant I agreed with you or disagreed with you. \"You?\" You scoffed. \"You who have an opinion of everything have no opinion?\" I pursed my mouth in thought and then stopped, you stopped as well. \"My opinion, Miss Austen, is that you there will be people your whole life through that will be ready to look down at you for not marrying the right man, for not marrying at all, for not having the right name, for not-- you see what I'm getting at?\" \"Yes, but why should others dictate how we live?\" \"They should not, though it is very difficult to live without approval, for living without approval almost always portends living without means to support yourself.\" You said nothing. \"Of course, you could always run away with me.\" I said, teasing you as I offered you my arm. You took it with a hesitant smile and we continued to walk. \"You would have not to worry about such things as approval or marriage, because you would have none of them...\" \"But, oh - the literary conversations we would have!\" You laughed. \"There would much 'having', Miss Austen, but I do hope that not all of it would be conversation.\" You turned your head from me to hide the embarrassment my words had just caused you, but I knew you were amused... and I was glad of it. I can not say for how long we walked together observing the show around us, conversing - laughing even, I only know that I had never enjoyed myself more. Some time later we found ourselves amongst a crowd of people surrounding a boxing match - if it could have been called that. It is difficult to consider it a match when one opponent is so obviously ahead of the other in terms of skill and experience. I was irritated immediately by the fool who had decided to fight when it was apparent that he did not know how. The professional, though, managed to secure a bit more than my irritation after he offered us a glimpse of the worst form imaginable. A real man would never hit his opponent off guard. I began taking my gloves and coat off without thought, ignoring your concerned questioning. Goliath was unyielding and David was going to get himself killed if someone did not stop this. I jumped in to take his place, quite confident in my own abilities. It was going quite well at first - I even supposed that I was going to win your brother a good sum of money. He'd seen me do this before and knew I could beat the man and so gambling on me was not a risk. All was going well at first, I missed a jab and was able to duck and get in my own hit right away... But then, there was dear Lucy, was there not? A person can always count on something he did not count on. She called my name from within the crowd and I had to look. I was responsible for her. It turned out that she was fine, just excited to see me as always. With the slight turn of my head went my consciousness and, I imagine, a great deal of your brother's money. I awoke, I assume, moments later... to you. You called my name, caressed my face - tried to wake me with such urgency. I had been touched by women, nameless and faceless. I had been kissed, caressed... stroked. But never before had I felt what it was to be loved by a woman. To have her gentle and urgent brushes come from a place other than lust. To have that woman care for me. Yet there you were with no obligation to me, holding my face and calling my name. Caring for me, fearing for me. I smiled even through the metallic taste of blood in my mouth. You asked me why I had done what I had done and I lied to you. I muttered some nonsense about not wanting my boxing lessons to go to waste. I could not bring myself to share with you my true reasons... that I could not bare to see a fool taken advantage of. I was unwilling to show that aspect of my nature. To anyone. This was not the type of place and nor did I live the type of life which would allow for such habits of selflessness. Indeed, the he only way to survive was to hide your true emotions and reasoning from the world which would tear them away from you if given the chance. I could never allow anyone to ever really know me. But it was too late for that, for, somehow, you already did know me. My sense of justice, you had called it was what you believed had spurred me on and in to the fight. You saw right through my lies. You saw right through me. How was it, then, that you did not know I loved you so deeply? Perhaps it was because it was not until that moment that I knew it myself, though I tried to deny the feeling. I laughed shortly, still trying to keep myself from you... for even if it had been my sense of justice it had also been a lack of judgment (which seemed common of me in your presence). I should have let the man get beat. I had been taught to do just that. Justice plays no part in the law and therefore neither in my life or in this world. You looked almost hurt when you asked me if I truly believed that. I know you believed exactly the opposite or at least wished to believe the opposite. You would never have accepted it the way I did... but I was compelled to accept it. There was no purpose in idealism. I wished to tell you that, no, I did not. But believe it I did. I had to. You stared in to my eyes with such pain; as though you felt pity for me. I stared back at you for a brief few moments, the constriction in my chest becoming unbearable. I did love you. There was no denying or undoing it. I loved you more than I ever would have believed myself capable of loving anyone. I suddenly wanted to taste your lips, feel your breath. I wanted to make love to you there, right there in the midst of all those people. To make you mine again and again - damn propriety. Damn everything. I loved you with my whole heart and soul... and the pain was nearly all I could take. For I would never make love to you. I would never kiss you. You would never be mine. You would never even know what it was I felt for you. I was leaving and that would be the end of it. I begged your leave, unable to stay a moment longer in your presence. Walking quickly away from you and out of sight, I wiped the blood from my mouth and labored to retrieve my senses. I loved you. I loved you. It kept repeating itself in my mind. I loved you. How long had this been so? I wondered - thought back to our first meeting. To our second. To that day by the river. To the library. Every moment I had spent with you. You who were so different from me, from everyone. You who insulted me before you knew me. You who caressed my bloodied face. You, Jane. You. It all seemed so obvious now. I had searched for you at the ball, had asked you to be my first dance partner. Indeed you had been the only woman I had wanted to dance with at all. I had gone to the picnic to see you. I had read your book. I had sought you out again and again without understanding why it was that you intrigued me so. But now I knew. Now I understood. As I said before, I had loved you almost all along. *7* The carriage ride back to Steventon was quiet for the most part. Lucy drifted off to sleep early on and I allowed her to rest her head upon my shoulder. It obstructed my view of you who sat next to her, and of that I was grateful. Any sight of you just then would have hurt too much. \"Your uncle will be pleased to find that you've found yourself a wife, Lefroy. Something to settle you down.\" Henry said teasingly, referring to Lucy. I smiled a bit and looked outside the window. \"A wealthy wife of family.\" I said. \"He would be overjoyed.\" \"Is that all your uncle is concerned with?\" Your voice. I closed my eyes, feeling very unhappy. You were upset with me, I could tell. You did not like what I had said about justice, and had quite probably not liked what that said about me. I had disappointed you, Jane... but it was better that way. After all, I was leaving. And even if I was not, what then? I had nothing for you. \"Wealth and lineage?\" \"Jane.\" Henry said, most likely sensing tension. \"What?\" You asked. \"I am merely curious as to the state of his uncle's priorities. Is money all that matters? Are education and merit held in such small regard these days that--\" \"My uncle's priorities are much the same as everyone else's.\" I interrupted you, keeping my eyes on the passing country - my heart bleeding pain in to every hole it could fill. Please, I pleaded with you silently, end this. Stop your judging. You knew nothing of me. A pause. \"Are they the same as yours?\" You asked. \"Priorities speak little of a person unless you know why it is they are forced to prioritize as they do.\" \"What reason other than wealth would force a man to prioritize punishment above justice and money above affection?\" Were you speaking of my uncle, Jane... or of me? \"Obligation.\" I responded without a thought. \"Obligation to what?\" You asked with a laugh. \"To your pocketbook?\" I swallowed, and looked across from me to Eliza and Henry whose eyes seemed to have been on me all along. A very awkward silence hung in the air for a long moment. I could not show you or anyone in that carriage the extent of my feelings for you. I could not show how I cared or how your words stung. \"And who would you have me marry?\" I asked. \"A well educated young woman of small fortune? I might be penniless with no means to support myself or her but, oh, we would have great literary conversations.\" Now they were looking at you who said nothing. \"We do not do what we desire.\" I continued, once again looking out from the window. \"We do what we must.\" \"What must we?\" Lucy asked groggily as she awoke from her sleep. No one answered her. \"Jane?\" She asked. \"Tom?\" More silence. \"What must we?\" \"Lucy.\" Eliza spoke. \"Why do you not tell us what was your favorite part of the fair?\" And Lucy, never missing an opportunity to speak, did speak. \"Oh, the whole affair was immensely entertaining, was it not?\" She asked. \"The high walkers, particularly...\" After that I heard no more. I stopped listening, and anyway, I do not believe it was long before she stopped talking. She must have realized that there was an even better opportunity for her, which was pretending to fall back asleep and lay her head back on my shoulder. I did not mind, for I felt sorry for her. She was in love with me as I was in love with you, and neither of us would have what we desired. I would have wished that pain on no one. *8* Henry and I stood at your door before I departed with Lucy back to her home. He had asked to speak with me and, as I stood there, I was certain I would not want to hear what it was he had to say. \"Tom.\" He started, clearing his throat. I stood rigidly with my hands clasped behind my back, a nod was all I gave him in response. \"Allow me to apologize for my sister's behavior. She is given over to fits of strong opinion.\" I said nothing. He took a deep breath and clasped me on the shoulder. \"She is in love with you, Tom.\" I swallowed. I was not sure if the news was good or bad, for in truth... it was both. \"She's told you this?\" I asked. A pause. \"No.\" He said, taking his hand from me. \"But if tonight was any indication--\" \"I am leaving.\" I interrupted him abruptly, not wanting to hear what it was he was going to say. If you loved me, if he had some proof that it was so - leaving would be unbearable. He furrowed his forehead. \"Your uncle--\" \"Has sent for me, yes. I will be gone the day after to-morrow.\" Henry looked down and nodded. He seemed almost relieved, but distressed as well. \"Does Jane know?\" \"Why would Jane know?\" I asked. \"Do you care for my sister?\" \"Sir, I find that this conversation has ventured to become rather a bit more familiar than I am willing to allow.\" \"I assume that means yes.\" He said with a laugh. Again, I said nothing. Again he took a deep breath. \"Then do what you must, Lefroy... but do not neglect to remember her feelings.\" \"I rarely have occasion to remember my own, Austen.\" He laughed again shortly, though appeared to be largely not amused. \"I shall come to London some time. Visit for a spell.\" I bowed shortly and turned to go, but something compelled me to turn back to your brother. \"I would never conduct myself intentionally in any way as to cause your sister distress.\" I paused. \"I do care for her.\" It was dark and it was slight... but I could see that your brother was smiling. \"I know.\" He said, and his smile widened. \"Everyone knows.\" I looked down, an ironic smile playing upon my own lips. Henry bowed. \"Lefroy.\" He said. I bowed once again, and turned back to the carriage. I stopped short and again, I turned back to your brother. \"When you say everyone...\" \"Goodnight, Lefroy.\" Were the last words I heard from a very amused Henry before the door shut behind him. *9* I was unable to sleep that night as I had expected. I had thought that I had been in love before, but realized now that I had never been... and I was finding my first true experience with it to be a bit more unpleasant than books and second hand accounts would have you believe. While there was a vague sense of euphoria that clouded my mind when I thought of you, there was mostly just pain. I wanted to imagine you and wanted to forget you - and I was finding it very difficult to reconcile the two desires. \"Jane...\" I whispered your name to myself, just wanting to feel it on my tongue. I fancied you could hear me. That, somehow, as you lay in bed staring up as I did... you heard me whisper to you. Absurd, I know - but it comforted me. \"Tom?\" A soft feminine voice crept in to my ears. I sat up abruptly as my room filled with the light of one flickering candle. \"Lucy?\" I asked in confusion. I had not even noticed her open my door. She walked completely in and shut the door behind her. \"Lucy, what are you doing? Can you imagine the kind of trouble you could get us both in to if--\" \"I love you!\" She interrupted me. I was quiet for a moment, any angry words of reproach gone from my mind. I smiled softly, sadly, and stood up. I walked over to my window seat and sat back down. Looking out from the window, I held my hand out to Lucy. \"Come here and sit with me a moment.\" I felt her take my hand and sit next to me, but I did not look at her right away. I was not sure of what to say or do and I knew if we were to be caught sitting there in such a compromising way it would hurt Lucy and her family. But she loved me and I... I felt somehow responsible for taking some of that burden away from her. I took a deep breath. \"Lucy,\" I started and then looked at her. I could see clearly two wet lines drawn vertically down her face. \"Do not cry.\" \"I know you think I'm just a stupid little girl... but you're leaving and I had to tell you.\" I paused. \"It...\" I stopped, not quite certain of what words were to come from my mouth, but knowing I had to say something. \"It honors me that you would hold me in such high regard. If someone so wonderful as you could love me, it makes me feel as though I might have a chance in life.\" \"Do you think...\" She started as she wiped the tears from her face. \"Do you think you could ever love me, Tom?\" \"I think that the man who is lucky enough to win your heart would be a fool not to return your favor.\" I squeezed her hand. \"But I do not deserve it and therefore could never presume to accept or return...\" I trailed off. She looked down, but I took her chin in my hand - forcing her gently to look at me. \"I care for you a great deal. My only wish for you is your happiness... and you would not find that with me.\" \"I would.\" She protested. I stared in to her eyes and then sighed, realizing my best course of action was not to reason with her, but to frighten her. \"All right then.\" I said as I stood up. \"We had better leave quickly.\" \"What? Leave?\" She stood, confusion knitting her eyebrows. I nodded as I retrieved my luggage from under my bed. \"Well, of course. We'll have to run away together. You don't suspect your mother and father would ever allow us to be married.\" \"Run away?\" She asked, sounding quite unhappy. \"Yes. To Ireland.\" \"Ireland?\" \"Yes, where I'm from. My uncle would not allow us to stay with him.\" I turned to her. \"We'll live with my mother and father and all my brothers and sisters. My mother would be grateful to have your help.\" \"... How many brothers and sisters?\" \"Eleven.\" I answered off handedly. \"Eleven?\" \"Mmm.\" She looked to me and then to my luggage, then back to me. \"I think I'll be going back to my room now.\" She said. \"But I thought--\" \"What good would a marriage be if we made everyone around us so unhappy?\" Though I smiled on the inside, I managed a resigned expression of understanding. \"You are right.\" I said. \"You must think me a fool.\" \"No, Tom.\" She said with a shake of her head. \"I could never think that of you.\" I smiled. \"Shall we be friends?\" She smiled as well, as though now I was the one to be pitied. She stood on her toes and placed a soft kiss on my cheek. \"I should like that very much.\" She said and then turned to go... but before she opened the door, she turned back to me. \"Tom?\" \"Lucy.\" \"My mother and father... they will not hear of this, will they?\" I held in a laugh. \"It will be our secret.\" I said, she smiled with a nod and was gone. How quickly young and foolish love dissolved when tested. Perhaps if you offered to run away with me, my affection for you would evanesce... But no, I thought as I sat on the edge of my bed. If you proved to love me so much as to wish to run away with me, that might well have been the happiest day of my life. And it was, Jane - as well as the worst. But... I suppose am getting ahead of myself. *****[Chapter 3] There You Were Part I Chapter III *1* I do think back occasionally with wonder. I wonder how many things I would have done differently. Would I have avoided meeting you all together?... Or would I have arranged it so that you never knew the circumstances which would eventually force us apart? I do not know, Jane. I do not know if I would have done the honorable thing and left you in peace, or if I would have kidnapped you in your sleep and married you at the first available opportunity. After all this time, I still am unable to piece together a life for us that would have worked out. Perhaps things happened the way they happened because they could have happened no other way. I... do not know. I only know that I loved you. I have loved you all my life. *2* I stood in front of the second floor window at the Ghresham ball for half an hour awaiting your arrival. Carriages and people came and went, and still I stood. I am not sure what I must have looked like standing there and peering out through the dark pleated drapes - silent and still. I only knew I did not want to miss you. This was my last night... our last night. Even if I was to never tell you of my feelings, seeing you and being near you was all I wanted. There, another carriage... and yet another sigh, for no - it did not carry you. But wait, could that be...? No. Not nearly as beautiful. But there, that carriage must have been yours... No? Just how late were you going to be? \"How long do you plan on standing here?\" Lucy. \"As long as it takes, my love.\" I answered her blandly without looking at her. There was a long enough pause before she spoke again to make me think she had walked away, but she had not. \"I understand what you did.\" She said, surprising me slightly by still being there. I took a deep breath and looked at her only briefly before returning my gaze to the window. \"Oh yes?\" I asked. \"Do enlighten me.\" \"You tricked me.\" I nodded shortly, grimacing as though I'd been caught at something shameful. \"Please do not think ill of me for it, Lucy. I only meant to show you what you would not see for yourself.\" She shrugged slightly, waving her fan around unconsciously. \"I suppose I should thank you then. For it is obvious that I do not love you... I believe I never did.\" She paused. She did not seem angry with me or spiteful, she was only a young girl telling me the truth of her emotions. \"Is that not funny?\" \"Immeasurably so.\" \"Shall you dance with me tonight?\" She asked cheerfully, still wanting to show me off I gather. \"Lucy, how very forward of you.\" \"How can I possibly be forward with a man who was just last night willing to run away with me?\" She asked playfully. I do confess I found that to be quite funny and found myself thinking that Lucy was more clever and interesting than people around her might have been predisposed to believe. \"True enough.\" I responded, then finally did meet her eyes as I bowed fully to her. \"Of course I shall dance with you. It would be an honor.\" She smiled, curtseyed and was gone. If she had left any later than that, I might have missed you, my dear... for as soon as I turned back to the window - there you were. The footman helped you down from the carriage. I thought I would be able to observe the whole of your walk in to the house but you looked almost immediately up at me... it was almost as though you had known I was going to be there. I stepped out of sight before you could have been sure it was me and walked away from the window. My heart beat rapidly as I hid myself from view. My sudden nervousness was due in large part to one fact I had forgotten; you had not been exactly pleased with me the last time we parted ways. Would you still be cross with me? Would you ignore me? I watched you ascend the staircase from a concealed vantage point - realizing even as I did it that I was behaving strangely. Even for me. I had never before stalked around in the shadows so that I might catch a candid glimpse of someone. The hold you had of me was... frightening. I followed you in to the ball room and observed as you visually swept the room for... I did not know what. Or whom. For a short moment I allowed myself to think it was me for whom you searched, but told myself it could not have been. Why would you want me? I was nothing like you. I offended your sense of propriety and honor - had done nothing to raise your opinion of me at all. You could have had any single man in the room and so now I was only one of many. I had not remembered you out of a crowd, so why would you choose me out of one? But still... you did seem to be seeking something hidden to you. You looked and looked, moving from one area to another - peering past face after face. You did not see me. Perhaps... But then there was Wisley. You saw him and stopped. My heart tightened as I watched him bow, you curtsey - as you began to dance. Had you been searching for him all the while? Wisley? Had his money and stature finally managed to sway you? Did you love him for all the ways he was different from me? I nearly hated you just then, imagining that you could be bought so easily - for the Jane I thought I knew had no price. She was above such pettiness. Had I been wrong about you? I continued to watch. No. No, you had not been searching for him... for I could see, even as you tried to conceal it from your dull dance partner, that you were not interested in him in the least. That was when I knew. It was me. I knew it was me. I asked, perhaps offending Lucy in doing so, the nearest idle husband seeker to dance and we joined the line without you noticing... and a few moments later we were face to face, you and I. I had not to wonder if I had been wrong in my earlier assumption for the look of surprise on your face was confirmation enough... and I had to smile. You looked, not embarrassed, but... happy. No, you were not upset with me at all. We danced and I held your hand, touched your back, could scarcely take my eyes away from you. Though, every instance I looked to you, you were looking to me as well. If only we could have just gone on that way all night, no... for the rest of my life. You were mine and I was yours and we were together. Your soft hand in mine, your beautiful brown gaze upon me. I loved you so much it hurts. Yes, even now... hurts. When the dance was ended and I bowed to my partner, I allowed myself a sidelong glance at you. I was awarded with your eyes meeting mine and a slight smile upon your lips. I looked away from you and back to the woman in front of me. Ignoring the screaming impulse I had to grab you and ruin your reputation forever, I smiled and tried to push my feelings for you away. That dance was all we would have - all we could have. I was leaving and I would not torture myself with you all night. Yet, somehow, we came to stand almost back to back. Had it been accident or subconscious design? Had we both unwittingly maneuvered our circles nearer to one another? I tried to ignore your body so close to mine, but could not... and ended up muttering something about your dancing. Oh, yes. How could I forget? My words had sent you fleeing from the ball room. Passion. You danced with passion - a passion, might I add, that I had not noted from our previous foray together. I can not remember if you laughed, but I do know you thought the idea of a woman demonstrating passion to be of little point. A woman need not demonstrate passion to catch a husband... a sensible woman would not. That was what you said. No, not a husband. Not in the case of many of your peers, I'm afraid. Neither passion nor love was very commonplace in marriage. I looked at Wisley, knowing you meant him. What a dull husband he would make... No, I supposed you would not demonstrate passion to catch a man such as him. But a man such as me. A lover, Jane... No, my intention had not been to hurt you. My words had not meant much - just simple flirtation, really (If I had said what I had truly wanted to say, I might have scandalized you beyond repair). Even so, you excused yourself from your company. I cursed silently at myself for not being more sensitive to what I was saying - and then took several moments to decide between staying where I was and going after you. I should have stayed. Everyone would have seen you flee, and would know I was following you. There was enough talk surrounding us by then, did we really need any more? I followed you anyway. What did their talk matter to me? I would be gone in less than a day and I had hurt you. How could I not follow? I made it to the top of the stairs just in time to see you brush John Warren aside. Good on you, Jane. I dare say you could have been a bit more rude... but you did not know what kind of low person he was then. Neither did I. When I saw how you passed him over, I realized you might well do the same to me if I approached you. Perhaps you needed to be alone. John looked up at me and I turned around, putting on my best show of not caring what it was that ailed you. I did have some inclination that my behavior might get related back to your father by way of John's mouth, and that I did care about. I would not have your father knowing I chased after you in a most undignified fashion for us both. I stepped back in to the ballroom and Lucy was upon me in an instant. \"Tom, are you enjoying the ball?\" She asked. I smiled tiredly. I was fast forgetting that I had so recently thought the child to be clever or interesting. \"No.\" I decided to tell her the truth. \"No?\" She asked - apparently not having expected anything but, yes of course. I looked at her and bowed for what felt like the hundredth time that night. The millionth time in my life. \"But I suppose a dance with you would remedy that.\" I continued. She smiled widely, and I accompanied her to the dance floor as I had promised I would... dancing, bowing, holding her sweaty young hand. All the while I thought of you, and I grew sad. This was to be my life, wasn't it? Attending balls I did not wish to be at, dancing with women who I did not wish to dance with; women who were not you. A life full of polite and compulsory behavior. Devoid of happiness. I had never known myself to have such melancholy thoughts or emotions and it was quite disturbing. When the dance was over, I made sure to acquire myself the nearest glass of wine... and just as the glass was in my hand, I caught sight of you, along side Lady Gresham - walking past the east entrance of the ballroom. I was at the balustrade by the time you were speeding down the stairs again, Lady Gresham having already parted ways with you. I watched you this time without any intention of going after you at all, instead wondering what it was she had wanted with you... and why you appeared to be so upset. My aunt and her daughter solved the mystery for me almost right away. She - my aunt - called Wisley a good opportunity for you. I made a quiet noise of contempt... I was tired of such talk. As though marriage was all politics. It was not just the idea of a person spending their life with someone they did not love, it was the idea of a person selling their self. Perhaps that it what you meant when you spoke of being bought at the fair. Blatant prostitution with a prettier name. At least Wisley had not proposed, of that I was grateful... until Lucy solved the rest of the puzzle for me. She believed you should have accepted Wisley at once. I looked at her suddenly. She seemed to realize right away by my reaction and the reaction of her mother that she had said something that was not supposed to be said. She had not understood why that news was to be kept from me... but my aunt understood. I wanted you, she knew. I wanted you and was standing in the way of you and a good marriage. She knew that I could not hope to propose without my uncle's consent and, close as she was to you, most likely wished to protect you from disappointment. She dragged Lucy away, but the damage had been done. Now I knew. I clenched my jaw and dropped my glass, not caring about the mess of wine and shattered crystal, and took to the stairs in search of you. Why? Why had you not told me? We were friends, were we not? You loved me, did you not? You must have. God, you must have. I could not have imagined all that lay between us. I stopped outside and reigned in my breathing, my hand over my heart. I was making a fool of myself, and for what? You had always been meant for Wisley. He was a good opportunity for you and I was not. He had the money to marry you and to keep you, and I did not. No one wanted us to be together... except for me, and it was not usual for me to get what I wanted. Not really. After a minute or so, I regained my composure and continued to look for you. *3* When I was sixteen years old, still living in Ireland, there was a girl. Milky white skin, cheeks always flushed red... long auburn hair that she never seemed to wear up. Her name was Abigail and she was beautiful. Headstrong, opinionated, stubborn - everything a proper lady of her position should not have been, but these traits were exactly what attracted me to her. Hers were the first lips to ever touch mine, the first hands to ever caress my skin. My first lover. I was young and thought myself to be in love. I proposed to her in the rain, underneath a tree. I promised her the world and more, and she accepted. She threw her arms around me and placed kiss upon kiss on my cheeks. I smiled, trying to catch her mouth with mine. She laughed and cried and swore her love to me. To the best of my recollection I do not believe I ever told her I loved her. I am uncertain of why this was, but the words were never said. I showed her in other ways, with my actions. With my body. We knew it was wrong to indulge in each other the way we did but youth knows little of anything but its own blindingly strong emotions... and so we made love under that tree, shivering in the cold. I walked her home later that day. I remember that I kissed each of her eyes in turn, softly... tenderly. It was the last time I would touch her. There, in her garden, was the last time we would see each other. I was never quite sure of what had taken place, but Abigail had been sent away shortly after I helped her home. I do not believe a single soul had ever known of our short-lived engagement, but I do believe her being sent away was a result of the amount of time she had spent with me. Had I been a more suitable match from a better family, we would have been married. While I can look back on the incident now and know I did not love her, that I did not know enough of myself much less of anything else to engage in such a relationship - it did leave me heart broken at the the time. It changed me irrevocably and, though I would leave for London the next year and experience much more that would shape me in to the man I was to become and be when you and I first met - it was then and not in law school that I learned what I knew of justice. It was then that I learned the cruel nature of the world and my place in it. *4* At length I found you standing at a fountain. It was dark, but I was sure it was you. I approached you slowly, swearing to myself that I would not give away my emotions. Neither my pain nor my anger. Do you remember? I told you I had just learned of Mr. Wisley's proposal, I congratulated you - hating you, hating myself. You threw my own words back at me... was there an alternative for an educated young woman of small fortune? Were you trying to goad me? I spoke next with words of disbelief, though my calmness belied the raging emotion my face tried to conceal. How? How could you consider marrying Wisley? Even with all the familial pressure? Even with Lady Gresham and her particular talent at forcing what she wanted? Even with all his money and everything he could give you? You, marry without love. I asked you, you of all people I said, how could you throw the rest of your life away by marrying a man whom you did not love? What I really meant was, how could you do this to me? Ah, but there was no use for you in considering the alternative... because I was leaving the next day. Somehow you knew. Who told you, I wondered vaguely. I had not wanted you to know. Though I did not really think about it. I only looked at you, hoping your words were, but at at the same time hoping they were not, an admission of your feelings for me. Was it true? Was I your alternative? You looked at me, sadness in your eyes - and for the first time I was aware that I was not the only one suffering from my situation. Then you leaned in, Jane. You leaned in to me and I did not know what to do. I had kissed so many other women - had all the experience in the world, the experience I had teased you for not having so many times. And now. Now... I felt like a boy who knew nothing of anything. I was scared, and I hesitated. Could I let this happen? For if I did, there would be no going back for me. You would know my feelings and I would have you, Jane. I did not know and nor did I care how. You would be mine, for I could not bare anything otherwise. Our lips met and I felt my body dissolve under the wave of emotion that assaulted every one of my senses. I went hot and cold with each gentle caress of your tongue - so tentative, so sweet. If ever there was any small doubt in my mind of my love for you, this kiss shattered it beyond all recognition. I loved you - indeed it was hard for me to conceive of a time that I did not love you. Somehow I always had. My world was nothing but you... So when you pulled away and asked if you had done that well I had not even to think a beat before assuring you that you had. Very well. It had been a defining moment of my life. I held my hand against your neck lightly, suddenly so happy - my mood completely having changed. It was like nothing I had ever felt before. This was why people wanted to fall in love. For all the pain it could cause, there was no matching it in the elation it could cause also. You said you had just wanted to kiss well at least once and I smiled at the endearing sentiment. Jane, I planned on kissing you again and again, not just once. I might have said so, but we were interrupted by some passers by. I pulled you away quickly without thinking, not wanting the moment to end. Beneath the shadowed safety of a tree I hid us under I professed my feelings to you. It seemed so natural to finally tell you that I belonged to you, that everything a part of me was yours. I had nothing to my name and could not hope to marry you until it was settled away with my uncle, but you had to know. Even though I was worth nothing... Though you did not seem to think so. With a smile you asked me to let you decide my worth, and I knew you thought me worth more than I deserved you to think. Oh god, you felt for me what I felt for you. I could have died then a there a happy man. The group of people nearby grew closer and I pulled you away yet again. I asked what we would do for I was at a loss. Again, you repeated my own words to me... What we must. We would do what we must. Not what we desired. You seemed so hopeful, but I could not dare to hope just yet. Doing what we must implied speaking with your father, speaking with my uncle. Most likely my uncle first. It would be difficult and we would have to be careful in the way we approached the matter. You took my hands in yours and kissed them, the act was so tender and so... loving. I smiled and took your chin in my fingers, wanting nothing more than for our lips to meet once again. You appeared shy - nervous - this time, for it was me and not you who had the confidence to pursue a kiss now. I pressed my mouth to yours and your arms went around my neck almost right away. I was pleased by how comfortable you were showing yourself to be with me. You were perfect and I would not have guessed that you had never done this before. As I wrapped my arms around your back pulling you tightly in to me, you let out just the slightest sound of pleasure and then pulled away. It was a good thing that you did so because that noise was enough to sending my head spinning with lust and had we kept on the way we were, I am not sure that I would have been able to stop. I ducked my head attempting to meet your downcast eyes, but I could tell from your flushed cheeks and embarrassed smile that there would be no more kissing of that nature for the night. I grinned and held your chin so that you would look at me. You held my hand against your cheek. The voices grew nearer to us still and I dropped my hand, stepping back from you. A few moments of silence between us were enough to allow reality to set in. I was still leaving the next day. This night would be the last we saw of each other for quite some time. \"I will write to you.\" I swore, wanting to reach out but too aware that we could be spotted. You nodded, your eyes wet - though you did smile. \"A letter seems such small consolation when I will not see you or...\" You did not seem to have the words, which struck me as odd. You always had the words. I was elated to see that you would miss me. \"Can I hope that you will write to me?\" I asked. \"You need not hope, for you should know that I will write to you.\" You responded, and my heart felt so full I feared it would burst. I looked around quickly and risked taking your hands once again. \"I will work out a plan, I promise, and I will marry you, Jane. If you'll have me.\" The words came from my mouth in a nervous jumble, much the same as my confession of belonging to you had come not even five minutes before. You squeezed my hands in yours and the expression of joy upon your features made me so happy. \"I thought you could not yet offer marriage.\" You said. I laughed. \"Indeed, I can not.\" I responded taking one of your hands and pressing it against my chest with both of mine. \"But I can offer you my heart as a promise that I will ask for your hand one day, properly.\" \"Then accept my heart as a promise that I will give you my hand on that wonderful day when you are able to request it.\" \"I accept what is so kindly given to me.\" I kissed you firmly upon the lips without thinking, and then pulled away from you completely. I bowed, and you curtseyed. \"Miss Austen.\" \"Mr. Lefroy.\" You responded. I could stay out there with you no longer, for your family and mine had no doubt noticed by now that you and I both were absent from the ball. I turned to go, feeling my heart sink immediately - I was not ready to leave you. I prayed that this would be different from my previous ill fated attempt at love. It had been painful to learn that Abigail was gone - that we had been so easily separated... but by the time I had made my move to London, I could no longer remember the exact color of her eyes or even the shape of her face. I had recovered almost completely. Had something happened and I was to be parted from you, it would have destroyed me. No, I was not ready to leave you. *5* Though leave you I did - and I returned to the party alone. It had been unspoken between us, but we both knew that returning together would not have been wise. I took my place amongst a circle of acquaintances and tried to keep up in dull conversation, but my thoughts were hopelessly and understandably elsewhere. I took great pleasure, however, in knowing what we had shared outside... what only you and I knew. You were mine and I was yours and we were in love, and no one could take that away from us. I watched you from across the room, as you moved gracefully from circle to circle. As you chatted with some friends. As you danced with Wisley once more. I narrowed my eyes, unable to keep down the sudden flare of jealousy that made my face go hot. I do believe I hated him. \"What about you, Mr. Lefroy?\" Someone or other had said. I looked at him and at the other three faces whose eyes rested on me awaiting an answer abruptly, having not the foggiest idea of what I had just been asked. I cleared my throat. \"Er... I suppose I... would have to say, I have never been one for that sort of thing myself.\" And then, dear Jane, they - all of them - stared at me silently. Either my answer had been offensive or it just did not relate to the question. I cleared my throat again and took a sip from the new glass of wine I held in my hand. \"Yes, well.\" The man who had questioned me said, looking rather confused. I paused, and then... to hell with it. \"I apologize, I have no clue as to what you were saying. My attentions were otherwise preoccupied.\" I responded truthfully with a smile, there was more silence... and after a moment I bowed and walked away. Managing to meet your eyes as I made my way back to the refreshments, I grimaced amusedly. You furrowed your forehead in question, but did not approach me. Even as every part of my body ached for you, I knew the importance of keeping our distance. \"I've noticed a bit of flirtation between you and the Austen girl.\" George Lefroy commented as he came to stand beside me. I smiled. \"There are only so many walks a man can take before he gets bored and searches for something else to keep himself occupied.\" I replied as I smiled and bowed at a pretty young woman who walked passed me, she smiled shyly in return and curtseyed in response. A moment later I looked at George with an ironic smirk. \"I see.\" He said. \"Well, take care. She is all but promised to Mr. Wisley. Mother and father believe that they will be married in the fall.\" I had to grit my teeth to keep from saying what I wanted to say. Why did he, did any of them, think they could go around planning your life for you? Wisley had proposed so therefore you were to be married. No one seemed to take in to account that you had your own mind with your own thoughts. \"She has accepted him then?\" I asked a bit shortly, knowing it gave me away slightly - but I could not help it. Now that you were really and truly mine, I was finding it very difficult to keep it to myself. You loved me, not Wisley. \"Well, I have not heard of her accepting quite yet but I am certain--\" \"I wish them both very happy.\" I interrupted him. \"You need not warn me, George, for to-morrow I will be gone. What I do today is of little consequence.\" \"But you have more than yourself to consider, cousin.\" I sighed. \"Let me explain something to you, cousin . I have had this conversation already, and allow me to lay your fears to rest, for I have no intention of hurting Miss Austen or--\" \"Miss Austen?\" He asked, confused. \"Yes, what were you--\" \"Tom, I speak to you of my sister.\" He said. I was silent. \"Surely you must have noticed how fond of you she has come to be. Have you not thought of how your frivolous flirtation with other women effects her?\" Well, this was funny. What was it with Hampshire men and their unyielding need to protect their sisters from me? I all but laughed as I pat my cousin on the shoulder. \"George, you are a good and caring brother, but do not worry about your sister. She will forget about me the moment I am gone.\" I took another drink from my glass. \"Lucy and I have an understanding.\" \"An understanding?\" He asked. \"What sort of understanding?\" \"The sort of understanding where I threatened to run away with her to scare her out of her feelings for me.\" I answered. I am not sure what I had expected him to say or do in response to that, but he laughed a bit. \"And what would you have done if she said she would go with you?\" I paused. \"Well let us both thank God that is not the course she chose to take.\" I took yet another drink from my glass. George nodded. \"You do not care much for people other than yourself, do you?\" He asked. I opened my mouth to speak, but he continued. \"Forgive me, cousin, for being so blunt... but your actions seem often to stand great chance of hurting some poor girl irreparably.\" He looked briefly to you who did not notice, then back at me. \"And this time I do not just speak of my sister.\" I looked down and he walked away. Taking a deep breath I looked at you once more - your smiling face looked to me as well... though the smile slowly went from your face as you met my eyes. I tried to smile for you, but do not know how well I pulled it off. I should have been a strong enough man to leave you be - to flee from Hampshire and never see you again. I knew what lay ahead of us and how difficult it could prove to be. If my uncle denied his consent I knew it was not just my own heart which stood to be crushed. But I had you finally... how could I give you up? *6* I found Henry outside with Eliza, they seemed just to be coming back to rejoin the party from wherever they had just been. \"Henry.\" I said, addressing him informally - not bothering with a bow. Eliza looked at him as though she knew something was wrong. \"I'll follow you.\" Henry said to her, gesturing that she go on without him. She nodded, and was gone. He looked at me, his face showing obvious concern. \"What is it?\" He asked. \"I must ask of you a favor.\" I responded, taking care to keep my voice down. \"What sort of favor?\" I took a very deep breath and bit down on my teeth. \"Your sister has given me her consent to write to her.\" I started. \"But I am worried that my letters may not reach her, you understand.\" Your brother sighed. \"Yes, I believe I do.\" \"I know what liberty I am taking by asking this of you, Henry, but I must. If I address my letters to you, will you see to it that they make their way to Jane?\" \"Tom, I must ask you... what are your intentions toward my sister? Will you write to her for a week, two perhaps, and then forget her once you settle back in to your city life? If so, then I can not agree to this. I will not see her hurt.\" \"I love her.\" I answered honestly, knowing that if he was to help us he would have to know the whole truth. \"My intentions toward her are honorable, I assure you.\" Henry was silent for a moment. \"Do you intend on asking her to marry you?\" \"Well, I suppose I already have in a way...\" \"What?\" He asked in an outraged whisper. \"How does one ask a lady to marry him in a way?\" \"I have promised myself to her. I...\" I paused and took a short breath in and then out. \"I can not pretend that there are no impediments to a marriage between us, but I will devise someway. If I somehow find a way to introduce her to my uncle - if he only knew her without knowing the circumstances...\" \"And if you can not? What then? What will happen to Jane?\" I looked down and clenched my eyes shut, not wanting to imagine what would become of either you or me if my uncle denied his consent. I looked up and met your brother's eyes. \"I would never injure her - it would be the same as injuring myself.\" I said. \" Please... please do this for us.\" After a moment... Henry nodded, a small smile spreading slowly across his face. He put his hand on my shoulder. \"I must say I did not expect this.\" He laughed a little. \"But I will help you in any way that I am able.\" I smiled, fighting to hold back tears of relief and joy. I shook his hand. \"I am indebted to you.\" \"Oh, just knowing I was right all along is enough.\" He clasped me on the shoulder once more before walking away, laughing as he did so. It was a comforting feeling, knowing he was happy for us - that he would help us. We were not alone, Jane. \"Henry.\" I said, turning to him. He stopped and looked at me, a smile still on his face. \"Will you do one more thing for me?\" *7* I walked the path up to your door quietly, hoping that you would be there awaiting my arrival - hoping that Henry had given you my message. He had hesitantly agreed, but seemed weary of the trouble we could stir up if we were to be caught. It was late and this was a risk, but I had to see you. I would call the next day before I left, but it would be a quick and formal farewell. I could not allow that to be how we said goodbye. So as I approached your door, I was worried that you would not be there - that Henry would have judged the risk too great. Or perhaps he told you of my plans to come to you that night, and you would choose not to see me. What if you thought it was all a mistake? What if you regreted everything? I stood in front of your home, quiet as the grave. You were not there. Sighing, I looked up at your window and then I looked down. This had not been a good idea. What had I been thinking? Of course you would not be there. What if your mother or father caught me there with you? The scandal it would cause! Your reputation would be lost completely. It had been wrong of me even to suggest a meeting in the dead of night - and at your home of all places. I turned and prepared to go. But there was a rustling behind me. I turned abruptly and smiled. There you were - ushered by your brother, silhouetted in the moonlight, a wrapper pulled tightly across your chest, your hair spilling in cascades over your shoulders. I had never seen it down before that moment. You nearly took my breath away. \"... Yes, but I do not understand what I am doing outside in my nightgown--\" You stopped suddenly as you caught sight of me, and suddenly you were beaming. \"Tom?\" \"Jane.\" I said, and closed the distance between us immediately. My arms were around you and my lips upon yours before another word was spoken. Again, I could feel myself dissolve - waves of hot and cold breaking over me as you touched your tongue to mine. \"Lefroy.\" You brother whispered contemptibly. I stepped away from you, clearing my throat, realizing what I had just done. You put your hand to your mouth - hiding an embarrassed smile. \"Good God, man. Have the decency to wait until I've gone inside.\" \"How long do we have?\" I asked. \"I will keep look out but I would not suggest more than a few minutes.\" He shook his head, letting out a breath. \"I do not know how I let you talk me in to this.\" I gave him a small appreciative smile, he nodded shortly as well - looked to you for a moment, and then turned back to the house - leaving you and I alone. I turned to face you and took your hands - pulling you further in to the garden and away from the house, further in to the darkness, where we would be safe. \"Why did you not tell me you were going to do this?\" \"I wanted to surprise you... And if I was unable to make it here, I did not want to leave you disappointed.\" I paused, a small nervous laugh. \"You must think me mad.\" \"Yes, but it is a magnificent madness.\" You responded, I smiled and kissed you again - deeply and passionately. It took all the restraint I had to keep myself from pushing you against a tree and pulling your nightgown up over your hips. I had never wanted a woman the way I wanted you, but I was not going to trample over your innocence. Not just yet. There would be plenty of time for that when we were married. Would it not have been glorious, my love? \"Must you leave, Tom?\" You asked, pulling away - resting your head on my chest. \"Yes, I must.\" I said, holding your chin so that you looked in to my eyes. \"I must begin our work of convincing the judge. I will send word of my progress to Henry. He has promised to help us.\" \"Yes, I know.\" You said. \"And do you promise not to forget me?\" I swept a curl from your forehead. \"You have an even greater imagination than I thought if you can ever conceive of the possibility that I would ever forget you.\" You embraced me tightly. \"I can not believe that you are here. Is this really happening?\" You asked. Closing my eyes, I held you to me. \"Now that we are together, how could we ever part?\" Sadness enveloped your words - breaking my heart. \"We will be together again.\" I whispered in to your hair. \"If all goes well, we will be together always.\" I withdrew from you a bit to look you in the face. \"And I can think of no reason why all should not go well.\" It was a lie, you understand. There were plenty of reasons, reasons in excess, why all may not have gone well. Please know, Jane, that my uncle was quite capable of great kindness and generosity. His actions, though they may have at times seemed cold hearted or cruel, were justified always at least to the extent that they were done with my best interests at heart. It was upon him whom I depended because he allowed it. He did care for me... but this was precisely the trouble. What I wanted and what he thought to be best for me may not have been the same - and he was, unfortunately, exceedingly unpredictable. I would not voice my worries to you just then... I could not bring myself to do it. \"I wrote to my sister.\" You whispered. \"I explained that the day has come that I would flirt my last with you. I wrote that tears flowed from my eyes at the melancholy idea...\" You shook your head, looking down. \"Did they?\" \"They did.\" You said, then looked back up at me - your eyes bright with pain and tears. \"They do.\" I felt the sting of tears behind my own eyes as I cupped your face... I pressed my lips to yours gently and enveloped you in my arms. I was not sure how I was ever going to be able to let you go. \"Why do I fear that I will never see you again?\" You asked. \"You need not--\" \"Jane!\" Came a harsh whisper from near the house. It was Henry. We each looked at him suddenly - my heart racing. \"Henry, what is it?\" \"Someone's coming.\" He answered. You turned suddenly back to me, looking stricken. This was it then, I had to go. \"When will I see you?\" You asked urgently. \"Tomorrow. I shall call, I promise.\" You did not look happy about it, for you knew as I did that we would not be allowed to Jane and Tom the next day. We would have to be Miss Austen and Mr. Lefroy, and that would have to be enough. Henry grabbed your arm and began to pull you away. \"Jane!\" He whispered again. I kissed you once more quickly, and then you allowed him to pull you away. I hid deeper in the shadows, watching. Just as the two of you made it to front stoop, the door creaked open. \"Jane? Henry?\" Came your mother's voice. You and your brother looked up to her. \"What are you doing?\" \"We were just...\" Henry started, but apparently knew not what to say. \"Enjoying the view of the stars.\" You interjected. \"In your night gown, Jane?\" She asked. \"I've never heard of such a thing.\" She said as she turned back in to the house. Henry followed after her... but you turned to look back at the dark garden that hid me from view. I knew you could not see me, but you must have known I could see you. You smiled for me and I smiled for you - and then you were gone.

Bold Notes Italic Thoughts from Katy Underline Author comments Chapter One \"DAD\" In was a beautiful morning and Katy could hear Flicka out her window. Katy got up and went to her mirror in her bathroom to comb out her brown wavy hair. She looked at the dark circles under her shiny brown eyes. Rubbing them until they hurt, Katy walked out of the room and picked up her blue jeans of her chair and a red shirt off of her bedroom floor. Struggling to put those on she pulled them over her head and walked down stairs to eat her breakfast. The wood flooring was cold against her feet. Suzy, there Germen Sheppard ( a germen sheppard seemed like a good farm dog) opened her eyes and looked up at Katy and pushed herself up, seeking some food. Katy looked in the cabinets for some cereal. \"I forgot. Howard got back last night from collage. He has to eat everything doesn't he.\" she thought out loud. She searched all over the kitchen for some food. Finally Katy went to the fridge and peered on top, hopping for some bread to make a sandwich. But there was no bread either. She went to the table to find a note that read: WENT TO THE STORE TO BUY FOOD. AS YOU CAN SEE, HOWARDS BACK. TRY TO FIND SOMETHING TO EAT. THEN HELP YOUR FATHER WITH THE CHORES. LOVE YOU, MOM So Katy grabbed the last banana out of the basket and went out on the front porch. Walking on her toes so not to get her socks dirty Katy sat on the steps and grabbed her boots that were right next to the porch steps and slipped them over her feet. It was a beautiful day to take flicka out for a ride through the mountains. The wind was low and the sky had no clouds to be seen. She went to get flicka and exercise her legs from standing in her stall all night. Grabbing a halter and a lead rope from the tack room as she passed, the horses that just woke up from the barn doors opening. \"That's weird. I thought dad would go to the barn first in the morning and let the horses out.\" \"KATY!! Come here.\" Her dad yelled from behind the barn. \"Come and help me!! Hurry\" Katy ran forward. Her mind was racing. Dad always has -- with him. If he was in trouble, -- would help him . All she could hear was her heart beating against her chest and her boots hitting the dirt floor. Pushing The big sliding doors so they almost broke the hinges. Then she froze, she was prepared for anything, but her dad was sitting there with a big smile on his face and leaning up against a barrel. \"Dad! You scared me to death! What do you want?\" \"Gotcha! HAHAHA! I was just having some fun. But I also needed to get your attention, do you want to go for a ride through the mountains?\" Rob said, still chuckling from the scare he gave his daughter. Katy thought to herself, 'Our relationship as gotten better in the past month, I just wish I didn't have to go back to school.' \"Yeah, sure. I was planning on taking Flicka out anyway. It would be nice for some company.\" So, Finishing their chores of feeding the horses grain and letting them loose with the others, they tacked up Flicka and breezy socks (Katy's little cousin named Breezy Socks when he was born.) for a ride through The flower filled mountains. But it will be more than a ride through the flowers...

Bold Notes Italic Thoughts from Katy Underline Author comments Chapter Two \"Flicka's secret\" Arriving back from the ride with her father, Katy saw her mother's car in the driveway and started to head into the barn. She crossed-tied Flicka and as she was taking off her tack, Katy noticed that Flicka had a red spot on her leg. But then she thought for a moment and remembered that they walked through some berry bushes. So she decided to leave it and give her a bath later in the day. \"I promise girl, I will give you that bath later. But I have to go and beat Howard to the food before its gone.\" Katy put away the tack in the tack room and Flicka in her stall, she ran up to the house to get a sandwich made before Howard found that mom went to the store. After she made her peanut and banana sandwich, Katy sat down on the porch steps again and looked up to the sky. There were dark clouds that were moving east and they were full with water that looked to come down at any second. Thinking about the ride that her father had taken with her, but that thought had made her think about the bath she was going to give Flicka. Taking one more big bite of her sandwich then throwing the rest to Suzy, Katy got up to feed Flicka and give her that bath she promised her. On the way to Flickas stall she found some more of the berry juice on the floor. Stopping to inspect in, she heard her father in a stall. She looks up and saw that it was Flicka's stall. From inside the stall Katy could hear her dad Saying 'sorry girl' and 'take it easy'. She wandered over and peered inside the stall and saw here dad getting up from a bending position and putting Flickas berry covered foot down. Rob wandered over to her, still looking at Flicka's hoof. \"You could have told me earlier. She needs to go to the vet tomorrow. Why did you wait?\" Katy starred at him, mind racing from the words that came out of her dad's mouth. Finally her brain connected to her mouth. \"WHAT!? What's wrong with her?!\" \"You mean you didn't know?\" Rob said with a puzzled look on his face \"Know what? What am I suppose to know?\" Katy's eyes were searching for an answer on his face. \"Her leg. She must have walked through a thorn bush or something. Didn't you see it when you groomed her?\" \"No, I thought it was berry juice. I remember us walking throw some berry bushes\" \"Does that really look like berry juice to you? You have to inspect your horse more carefully in the summer because there are a lot of dangerous things that are poisonous to them. But we can't take her to the vet now, it's raining.\" \"What are you talking about 'it's raining'? She can't stay like that! She might get an infection! Her chances will rise now that there is moisture in the air! Please dad... we need to take her.\" Rob looked into his little girl's eyes and couldn't let his daughter down. \"Get Flicka ready for the trip, I'll go and get the trailer hitched up\" Author notes: Do not fear there will be more on this story soon.

Hidalgo is owned by Disney. Sad I know, but true. Frank Hopkins gazed into Lady Anne Davenport's deep lust filled eyes weighing each option.

Unbeknownst to either Frank or Anne grave consequences lay ahead, for in the warmth of a mother's womb rests what time will make a child. Dawn emerged stirring the secret lovers, which were wrapped in each others enamored embrace. Both murmured their good-mornings and stared into the others eyes. Anne smiled softly, tucking a strand of light gold hair behind her ear. Finally after a long, daunting silence she asked, \"Are you alright?\" Sitting up Frank answered, \"Just thinkin' about Hidalgo and the race, wonderin' if I did right by him\". \"Oh,\" whispered Anne, who propped her head upon her hand. \"Do you still wish to prove yourself in the Great Bedouin Race?\" \"Maybe, but..,\" he started only to see Anne rise from the elaborate four post canopy, which was decorated with soft shades of red and gold twirling together. So they miraculously created a look of unity in each precious stemmed rose splayed delicately across a background of white. Frank watched her don the emerald nightgown from the previous night. Crossing the vast tent like a ghost, Anne took a seat in a small chair and the west wind blew, ruffling the canvas walls. Turning away, she stared at the wall stoically; for a moment, Frank thought she could see something through the canvas, until she spoke, \"Man can not corral the wind nor can I keep you.

Wild mustangs were galloping away from something, feeling scared. They had to get away from them. They had to get away from the men. The men were on strange machines that had two black round things, which moved in circles. It looked kind of like what some kids rode, only it made sounds, big sounds that where horrible to the ears of a horse. I witnessed the whole thing, and got captured too. I was running along side my mother, my caring mother. She was black with a star on her forehead. My dark chocolate brown coat was shining in the sunlight. My ears were pinned to my head. I didn't know what was going on. All I knew was that we had to get out of here. The leader of our herd, a silver stallion at the age of eight, suddenly stopped, and we all stopped too. We were all trapped, yes, they trapped us! Those horrible men! They stopped the machines that they were riding on. They each held some rope, yes I recognized the rope. Each of the ropes were tied into a circle. The other horses around me quivered with fear. Suddenly, the leader galloped to the front. He signaled us to go, and we went but the leader of the men told three of the group to \"round us up,\" whatever that means. So the three men got back on their machines, and followed us. I slowed down a bit though, because I was getting tired, very tired. My mother gave me a little gentle push from her muzzle, saying, \"Come on darling! You could keep up.\" Encouraged by her words, I sped up again, still staying beside her. The three men though, were shouting something at us. I didn't know what they were shouting exactly, but it sounded like they were somewhat happy. Then, I saw what they were happy about. There was a horse, a buckskin mare eating something. The herd saw the buckskin, and decided it was safe to go to that horse. So, they went towards the buckskin, not noticing the metal bars that would be surrounding us. The buckskin looked up, and saw us coming. She neighed something a warning to us though, but the others still didn't listen. They headed straight towards the mare, and were soon, well, now trapped. The three men got off their machines and closed the gate, quickly. There were smirks on their faces. I was scared, and didn't know what they would do to us, where they would send us off too. I looked at my mother with my chocolate eyes. She just nuzzled me and said, \"Don't worry. Whatever happens, I'll protect you. I promise.\" Then, she looked at the men and pinned her ears back to her head. She pawed at the ground too. The other horses neighed and some pawed at the ground nervously. They didn't know what was going to happen. Some were angry though. One, a sorrel yearling half reared and kicked the metal bars. The evil men just laughed and ignored the behavior. \"Well, we got 'em now,\" one of them said. I knew there was no way out. We were captured. We fell for the men's trap. We waited, scared of what was about to come next. One of the men got some device out from his pocket. He was communicating in it. He replied with a smirk, \"Jeff, we finally caught them! Did you catch that silver stallion?\" The other man, which was called Jeff, replied back, saying, \"Yeah, I finally caught the little rat! He'll be in for good use.\" He was laughing. \"Well, good. Come over here. We need to load these mustangs in the trailer.\" Then, the man with the device put the device in his pocket. \"He's coming, boys.\" I wondered what was a trailer. I shook my head and pawed at the ground. Then, I looked at all of the other horses. Now, there were about ten horses here. There were seven mares, two yearlings, and one foal. I was that one foal. I was only about 2 months then. After an hour of waiting, the man had finally come with the leader of our herd, the silver stallion. He didn't look too happy. His ears were pinned and he was pawing at the ground. He did a half rear two, wanting to get out, but the man took out this thin rope thing and slapped it against the silver stallion's neck. Our leader stopped, but kept his ear pinned to his head. \"Come on, boys. Lead this stallion in the corral with the others horses.\" The three men nodded, and grabbed the rope. They led our leader into the corral with us, but closed the gate quickly. \"Now are you going to bring the trailer?\" \"Yes. Yes, I am now.\" Jeff went on his machine again and rode off, perhaps to go get the trailer. I wondered where we were going. I hope it was some where nice. They were probably just relocating us. Yes, that's it! They were relocating us! I looked at my mother again and nuzzled her. Another hour passed and Jeff finally came with what was called, a trailer. Now the trailer looked kind of big. It could probably fit five or six horses. The other horses looked at the trailer, and were nervous. They were shifting their wight. Some where neighing. Others were pawing at the ground. They didn't know what was going to happen to them, but I heard Jeff say, \"Okay Rob, open the gate and lasso...six horses, with the help of the other two guys, of course.Well, go ahead, go on!\" Little did they know, that some would be escaping from their grasps. Right when they opened the gate, a few horses did escape . About three horses escaped. The three horses that did escaped were the two yearlings and the lead stallion. He reared, thrashing his hooves. Rob closed the gate quickly, and yelled for the other two men to try to capture the lead again. They didn't really care about the yearlings. So the two men went to try to catch the silver stallion, but failed. He was too fast for them. \"Eh, we'll get 'im later,\" said Jeff. \"Just rope the ones that are left.\" There were six mares, and me left in what they called, a corral. The two men came back and opened the gate, but closed it quickly so that no more could escape. I thought this would be easy for them to catch me and my mother. It wasn't. Rob came near us and tried to catch my mother, but she reared, thrashing her hooves like the lead stallion. She was a brave one, my mother. Rob moved back quickly and said some word under his breath. It sounded like he was mad, real mad. He tried yet, again, but this time, my mother half reared. She tried to land on Rob, but failed. Rob moved away again. He again said something under his breath. This time, he look straight at me with a smirk. I nickered nervously and moved back. My mother snorted and looked straight at Rob with a mad look. She pawed at the ground. \"It's okay girl, I won't hurt you.\" He walked up to my mother slowly and gently. My mother took the bait and walked towards him. Suddenly, when Rob was near enough, he quickly put the rope over my mom! My mother reared and neighed with madness. I stayed back and nickered to her. I was scared. Rob led my mother towards the gate, and I followed. What can I do? I needed my mother. Plus, she told me too. She said, \"Everything will be okay, just stand by me.\" Rob waited with my mother for the other two men to catch the other five horses. They did, with some luck. So Rob opened the gate and led us to the trailer. It looked quite cozy in there, and thought it would be a good trip. As we were all led into the trailer, Jeff said something. He said, \"We'll need to train these horses before we even send them to auction. The mother and foal will have to stay together for sometime. We could separate them when the foal's a weanling.\" Separate my mother and I and what was a weanling? I thought that this was a bad thing about to come when I am a... weanling , whatever that was. When we were all loaded in the trailer, the men closed the door behind us It was dark, real dark. Then, suddenly, it started to... move ! The trailer was moving ! The horses around my mother and I were nervous. One horse, a paint mare, said, \"Where are we going? We are going to die here!\" My mother shook her head. \"No, no we are not going to die! We are probably just going to be relocated. You'll see.\" \"Yes we are. What do you know, old mare?\" That mare knew she had gone to far. My mother wasn't old. She was only about six years old. So, my mother nipped her and snorted. I shook my head and just looked at the other horses. I could see some had fear in their eyes. I decided to talk, but to my mother. \"Mommy, where are we going?\" I waited for her answer. \"I am not sure dear, but everything is going to be okay, don't worry.\" She nuzzled me and ruffled my short mane. I believed her. She has not failed me anyway. She does protect me. She is a good mother, yes. About four hours passed and we finally came to a stop. The other horses didn't know where we stopped to. Some looked out the little tiny openings and saw some white fences. It could be a farm, possibly. I wondered what was are fate. Suddenly, the door opened and the four men came. They let us out, one by one. First, they led my mother and I off the trailer. The ground beneath us was soft. It was a dirt path. I looked around and saw green pastures and... horses ! Wow, there were horses out here, grazing peacefully on the grass. Well, it looked nice here. Rob led my mother and I towards a brown colored stable. I wondered what the horses were like here. I hope they were kind. I looked around in the stables and saw horses looking out with some curiosity. They nickered to us in greeting. The ground here was well, hard. I heard the clip clopping of our hooves as Rob led us into an empty stall. I looked around my new surroundings. There was hay on the floor and a food and water bucket. It was warm and cozy in here. I looked up at my mother. \"Mommy, I think it is nice here, but I wish I was back in the wild.\" \"Yes, me too dear, but we would have to make life living here.\" She went towards the food bucket and sniffed the feed. It smelt good. She tried it. It tasted good too. She then went towards the water bucket, and tried the water. It was fresh and good too. Then, I heard some more clip clopping on the hard floor. My mother looked out and saw the mares from the trailer. She nickered a greeting and said, \"Don't worry, everything is fine. The food is great and the water is fresh.\" There mares looked at her for a minute, and snorted. They probably didn't believe her. Soon, I was board. I yawned and laid down on the hay. It was probably now the afternoon. I would say around five o' clock. I looked up at my mother and nuzzled her. \"I'm going for a nap. Goodnight, mommy.\" I smiled, then laid my head on the hay covered floor. My eyes slowly began to close. I felt my mother's warm muzzle. \"Goodnight, my son,\" she said gently to me. Soon, I was fast asleep. Soon, I awakened from my nap. I was guessing it was now nine o' clock, night. I yawned and got up. I took a drink of milk from my mother. She looked like she was about to fall asleep. \"Mommy?\" I tilted my head slightly in a questioning way. \"What dear, what it is?\" My mother looked at me with her soft eyes. A soft smile was on her face. \"I...I was wondering. What would tomorrow be like?\" \"I don't know dear. We will have to wait. Now, you must go back to sleep, come on.\" She nudged me, but I didn't lay down. I just looked up at my mother. \"I'm not tired though. Can I go to sleep when I feel sleepy?\" \"Sure dear.\" She yawned and shifted her weight under her hooves. Then, she fell to sleep. I looked around boardly, wondering if any other horses were awake. I sure did hear some mares talk. It was probably the wild mustang mares from our herd, because one of them said, \"I don't think I trust that other mare.\" \"What do you mean?\" one of the mares asked. She was a dun. \"What do I mean? WHAT DO I MEAN!\" I heard a hoof stamp on the ground. \"Look, she said 'don't worry, everything's going to be fine here. The food is great, blah, blah, blah!' What do you think of that? I'll tell you what I think! I think that that black mare likes it here!\" \"Well, we are going to have to, you know, live here. I mean, I well, kind of agree with the black one. I mean, she is right. The food and water are great!\" \"Eh, forget you!\" The conversation ended. I wondered if they always talked behind my mother's back. I looked at my sleeping mother and nuzzled her. I know that well, one mare hates her, but I don't. Soon, I yawned and began to lay down again. I was going to fall asleep again. My eyes closed slowly.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Training The next morning, I woke up early. I heard the sounds of footsteps. My mother was awake too. There was Rob, staring at us. \"Hey girl. Jeff! What do you think we should call this mare?\" Jeff came and looked at my mother. \"Well Rob, I think you should call her...Inferno. I mean, she does have a fiery attitude when you first caught her, right? So call her Inferno. It fits her personality.\" Inferno, my mom's new name. I wonder if she liked the name. It seemed like she did because she nickered in pleasure. \"Now, what should we call the colt,\" asked Rob. He looked at me with a questioning look. I looked back at him the same way, then I nickered. \"Eh, I don't know! He does have quite a spirit and when he grows up he will be black as ebony. We'll call him...Black Spirit.\" So that was my name. Black Spirit. Wow. I had a name. I nickered in agreement and pranced around the stall. I knew I had spirit! I loved the name! \"We should start training them Jeff. You know, to get them used to people.\" Jeff nodded. \"We'll take them out now. Grab Inferno's halter. We'll lead her out first. The foal will follow.\" Rob went to get my mother's halter, whatever that was. Now, Rob was a pretty nice guy, so far. He looked about the age of twenty and had black hair with blue eyes. He was kind of tall, but kind of short. I could tell that he loved horses but I don't know why he would want to work with Jeff, catching wild ones. Jeff was a little different. Jeff looked a little older than Rob. He had brown hair and brown eyes. He looked like he was in his thirties. He was tall. Probably that's why Rob worked with him. He was probably training to become a horse trainer or something similar. After four minutes has passed, Rob finally came with my mother's halter. Her halter was just a brown leathery one. Rob tried to put it on her, but she didn't like this part. A snort came from her nostrils. She backed up and pawed at the ground with her hoof. \"Easy girl, easy Inferno,\" said Rob, but my mother wouldn't listen. She nickered warningly and half reared in the stall. After awhile though, my mother finally let Rob put on the halter. He led her out of the stables and sure enough, I followed. We were led into some type of pen. It was round with those metal bars. They looked a little similar to the ones that held us when we were captured, except that it was red. I wondered why we were here. Then, I knew why. Jeff told something to Rob, but I didn't capture the words. Rob just gave the rope to Jeff and looked at me. He started to walk toward me. My mother wondered what was going on. She neighed to me and tried to get away from Jeff. She was trying to protect me. I snorted and looked at Rob. I nickered to him, then when he was near to me, I loped to the other side of the pen. I nickered again and shook my head. Rob rolled his eyes and tried to come after me again. I loped again to the other side and pranced around, nickering happily. I thought this was some kind of game. It was fun, trying to make the man chase you around the pen! Rob got the idea and laughed. \"Alright Black Spirit, stop playin' little one!\" He came after me again and I loped again, then did a half rear. This was so much fun! I got tired of the game pretty soon, though. I did trust him a little bit but still not that much. I whinnied to him, daring him to come near me. When he did, I reared and snorted. My nostrils flared. My ears were pinned slightly back to my head. Rob looked at Jeff and shrugged but Jeff ignored him. Rob sighed and tried again to go near me. I jogged to my mother and stayed near her. I knew I would be safe around her. Jeff shook his head. \"Rob, come here. I know what will work.\" Rob wondered what Jeff was talking about. He went toward Jeff. \"Hold out your hands.\" He sprinkled some stuff into Rob's hands. \"Go near Black Spirit and hold your hands flat. He'll sniff it, and probably eat it. Go on!\" I listened and shook my head. I loped to the other side of the pen. I watched him wearily. \"Come here boy, I won't hurt you. Come on, come on!\" He held his hands flat. I looked at the golden stuff in his hands. It looked like my mother's feed. I never tasted it before, but my mother said it was tasty. I went towards him and sniffed the feed. I ate some from his hands. My mother was right! This stuff was good! I continued to eat the feed from his hands. It tasted like...apples. I wondered what this feed was called. I remember hearing the name of it before, but what kind was it? I watched Rob as he lifted his hand. His hand started to come towards my little soft mane. I was scared now and didn't know what he would do, so I quickly loped to the other side of the round pen. A snort came from my nostrils. Rob scratched his neck and looked at Jeff. Jeff signaled him towards the feed bag, but stopped. He thought for a moment. When he was done thinking, he called, \"Rob, come here.\" \"What is it, Jeff?\" He walked over to Jeff, wondering what he was going to say. My ears pricked forward. I wanted to listen to the conversation. \"Look. Let's try a different approach with the colt. Get that rope over there, then get the feed. Hold it flat, just like you did earlier and let him eat it. While he is eating the feed, put the rope around his neck. Got it?\" \"Yeah, yeah. I got it!\" I guess that Rob was a little annoyed by Jeff. He looked at me, then at the rope and feed. He scooped some feed into his hand first, then grabbed the rope. He started to walk over to me. I snorted, neighed, pawed at the ground, then loped to one side. I didn't like ropes. I wanted to be back in my stall. I missed my warm and cozy stall. But right now, it was not time to go in the stall. We were training, and I hated it. My mother hated it too, but not as much as me. My mother started to like it, but I didn't. This was too new to me and too early. Rob shook his head and looked at Jeff. \"I think we should call it a day. The colt looks tired.\" \"Right. Well then, we'll keep working tomorrow. Let's get these mustangs in their stall.\" When I heard that, my heart leaped for joy! Finally, we were going back in the stall! Jeff opened the gate and grabbed the rope that was tied to my mother's halter. I followed close behind. We were at the stables and in my mother's stall. I went toward my mother to suckle some of that warm milk. It rushed down my throat as I drank. I was so thirsty. I heard Jeff speak while I was drinking. \"We forgot to train Inferno! We need to get her back...ah she could wait. The mare had a long day too. We'll train both the mare and foal tomorrow.\" At least they were training me and my mother tomorrow. I wondered what tomorrow's training would be like. It was around eight o' clock and I felt sleepy already. That first day of training sure tired me out. I laid down on the soft yellow colored hay and slowly fell asleep. My mother stayed awake though. She would watch over me. The next day, I was awakened again by the sound of footsteps. I got up and took a quick suckle from my mother. It was Rob who was walking around. He stopped by the stall that my mother and I were held in. He looked at me, and said, \"Mornin' Black Spirit. Better eat up because today is going to be a long day. I'm workin' with you, while Jeff works with your mother.\" He had a soft smile on his face. Rob continued to walk on. I guess he was going to feed us and the other horses, before we started to train again. I was right. He got out the bag of feed and went into each stall. He poured each horse a bucket of feed. When he was done with filling all of the horses' buckets, he put the feed away. Next, was filling all of the water buckets. He went into each stall and took the empty water bucket out. Then, about three minutes later, he would come back in with the water bucket filled. Soon, all of the horses had water, and Rob was done with the chores. He went back to the stall that I was kept in and just looked at me. \"I think you would be a great horse when you grow up.\" I shook my head and wondered what he meant. Did he mean I would be a great horse to ride? Will I actually be carrying people on my back? I looked at my back and snorted, then looked back at Rob. No way am I going to have a human on my back! I heard more footsteps, then saw Jeff with a halter over his shoulder. \"Rob, here. Take the mother out.\" Rob nodded and entered the stall. My mother snorted and flicked her tail. She didn't like the halter. She backed up and pawed at the ground. \"Easy girl, easy. It'll be okay now. Come on!\" It was quite a struggle to get the halter over my mom once again. After twenty minutes, passed, he finally got the halter on her. \"There you go, girl.\" He smiled and led her out of the stall. I followed her. Again, we were led to the round pen but this time they did something different. They left me in the one I was in before all by myself. Then, they led my mother into a different one. It was a struggle for them, that was for sure. I whinnied for my mother and she looked at me. She whinnied back and tried to go after me, but Rob and Jeff put a piece of cloth over her eyes. She had to follow them. I watched as they led her in a different pen. When they were done with her, Jeff commanded Rob to go into the pen I was in. Rob listened and went in the pen I was in.. Rob shook his head and said, \"Come on, Black Spirit. Someday you'll have to trust me.\" He sighed and just sat on the dirt ground, watching me. I watched him. We just both watched each other. My ears swivelled forward and back. \"What is it, boy?,\" he replied softly to me. Of course, nothing was wrong with me. After about seven minutes passed, I started to walk over to Rob, but cautiously. Rob just looked at me. I continued walking. When I was near, I stopped. I nickered softly and lowered my head to his hand. I sniffed it, looking for that feed that he fed me yesterday. There was none. I lifted my head and looked straight into his eyes. He slowly lifted his hand toward my soft dark brown fur. I allowed him to pet me. His hands were gentle against my fur. It felt good to be petted. After Rob was done petting me, I slowly moved away to the other side of the pen. I looked at him again and nickered. I started to prance in place. Now I trusted Rob. He was nice. I wanted to play a game, a fun game, the game that we played yesterday. Rob knew what I was getting at. He smiled and got up. He started to walk toward me. I loped to the other side of the pen and nickered happily. This happened for about two hours, maybe even longer. It didn't matter. I was having fun. I saw Jeff with my mother. \"Come on Rob. Training's over,\" he called. \"Ok, ok.\" Rob stopped playing with me. \"Come on, Black Spirit. You need to go with your mother, Inferno.\" I jogged, following Rob out of the round pen. I was reunited with my mother again. \"Hey Rob. How about you lead them into the pasture,\" suggested Jeff. Rob nodded and took me and my mother to the pasture. Finally, we get to go in the pasture with other horses! I looked around the pasture with excitement. Then, suddenly, my chocolate eyes saw three foals. A chestnut filly with a star, a buckskin filly, and a black paint colt. My ears pricked forward in curiosity. I debated in my mind if I should go or not. Finally, I decided to go over to the three foals. I went toward them at a nice jog. The fillies just turned away, while the colt looked at me in curiosity. I stopped in front of the black pinto colt. \"Hello,\" I replied to him. \"Hey. I'm Oreo. What's your name,\" he replied to me in a proud voice. A smile appeared on my face. \"Black Spirit. It's nice to meet ya!\" I bucked playfully. \"Yeah, you too!\" He laughed, but then looked at the two fillies who turned away. \"You see those fillies over there? Well, the chestnut one is Moonshine, and the buckskin one is Spirited Away.\" I nodded and looked at the two fillies for a minute. \"Moonshine and Spirited Away...got it. Why did they turn away though?\" I wanted to know why. \"Eh...who cares? I mean, they're fillies!\" He snorted in disgust. \"Yeah, you're right. Who cares! Hey, want to play a game?\" \"Like what?\" \"Like...TAG! You're it!\" I nipped him playfully, then loped away from him. I was having so much fun with my new friend, though I did wonder what the two fillies were talking about. Oh well, who cares? They're just fillies! \"Hey!\" He laughed and started to chase after me. I whinnied happily as I was running away from him. The fillies looked at us. \"Look at those jerks,\" complimented Spirited Away as she watched. Moonshine nodded in agreement and snorted. \"I know! I think that black colt is mighty cute though.\" She let out a giggle. Serenity just looked at her and laughed. \"I think he's stuck up. Look how he came over here! Plus, he's talking to Oreo. I say that he is a jerk just like Oreo.\" She shook her head. \"Well, you are right. I mean, he IS after all, hanging out with Oreo. Basicly, all colts are jerks.\" \"Right, Moonshine. You know, I don't know what happens to yearlings. I've heard some of the yearling fillies talking about love.\" Spirited Away laughed. \"No way am I going to fall in love with...with Oreo!\" \"I know what you mean. Falling in love...that's never going to happen to me!\" \"Me neither.\" The fillies stopped looking at us and just continued with their conversation. Oreo halted and looked at them. \"Hey Black! I need to tell you something!\" \"What?\" I jogged over to my friend, wondering what he was going to tell me. \"You know what? I hear some yearling colts talking about love. You know, falling in love with a filly?\" He laughed. \"Like that's going to happen! Love's a load of horse manure!\" He stamped his hoof on the ground and just laughed so hard. \"Yeah, just a bunch of horse manure.\" I laughed along with Oreo. I don't know what happens to yearling colts, but I know it's definitely not going to happen to me! Oreo and I continued to play our game. I suddenly stopped when I heard my mother called. I looked back at her. Was it time to go already? I looked at Oreo with a look of question. \"My mother's calling, hold on.\" \"Ok. I'll be waiting.\" I galloped toward my mother, wondering why she called me. Was something wrong or was it time to go? When I arrived, I looked at my mother with a puzzled look on my face. \"What is it?\" \"Rob is coming. Time to go. You better go tell your friend.\" She gave me a gentle nudge and I whinnied to her, then trotted toward my friend. \"Hey Oreo. Just need to tell you that Rob's coming to pick me and my mother up. So...I guess I'll see you later. Bye!\" I half reared, turned, and galloped back toward mother. \"Bye,\" he called. \"See you again soon!\" Rob came and tied the lead rope to my mom's halter. I followed her. We went into the stable and to our stall. It was now about eight thirty. Mother was eating some oats. I was drinking her milk. When she was done, she looked at me with those chocolate brown eye of hers. I was already done with my meal by then. A smile warmly and gave her a kiss. \"Goodnight, mother.\" \"Goodnight my son!\" She nuzzled me and then we both fell into a deep slumber. Weeks turned into months and months turned into a full year. My training was getting better and better. It was the same with my mother. Soon, she was carrying people on her back. Jeff and Rob were riding her now! I knew what it was to be a weanling. It means when I stop drinking my mother's milk. That it when the separation began. I was moved into a different stall, one that was next to mother though (thank goodness). I started to drink water and eat oats. Man those oats were good! My relationship with Oreo was still the same. We played out in the pasture and sometimes we made fun of the fillies. Yes, those were the days. Now I was a yearling. It was time for me to start training with the saddle and bridle. I had to start to learn to carry people on my back like my mother and let me tell you, that was not a really pleasant experience! When they first tried to put all my tack on, I was scared and I started to buck and half rear. Rob was getting frustrated, but Jeff told him that you needed to be patient with horses, especially young ones. Rob soon calmed down and they continued to work with me. My training sessions were usually from thirty minutes to an hour long. As the spring time came along, something changed with Oreo and I. We started to view the fillies in a different light. Moonshine is the most beautiful filly ever, let me tell you that! Her nice smooth chestnut coat, her silky mane and tail, her flowing gait: everything about her was perfect. I looked at Oreo and whispered in his ear. \"Hey Oreo...doesn't Moonshine look a little...you know beautiful?\" \"Forget about Moonshine! Look at Spirited! She is more beautiful than the sea!\" We both sighed. Oreo looked at me and started to smirk. \"Hey...you know what? You should go over and talk to Moonshine!\" \"What! Er...me? Talk to Moonshine? NO WAY! I mean, I will look like a fool!\" I stamped my hoof on the ground. Oreo just laughed. \"Oh no you won't. Besides, don't you want to talk to her?\" He gave my a push. \"Go on!\" I gulped and thought to myself. \" I can't do it! I can't do it! Oh no...she's looking at me. Quick umm...say something, anything!\" I stopped and looked at the beautiful filly that stood before me. \"Erm...hello beaut...I mean Moonshine.\" Oh no, that was stupid. Nice going. She smiled warmly. \"Hello. So...what's your name? We never really did talk.\" \"Spirit Black...I mean Black Spirit. Yes...Black Spirit, Miss. Moonshine.\" I bowed to the chestnut beauty. \"Black Spirit. That is a beautiful name. And my! What manners you have!\" She giggled and nipped me lightly on the neck when I stood. \"Hey...\" I swished my tail and smiled. I nipped her back. \"You want to...you know, go to the river with me? Now?\" I waited for an answer. I hoped she said yes. \"Why sure, Black Spirit. I would love to. Let's go.\" She broke into a nice graceful trot. I followed her. When we were at the river, we both stopped. The river was a really beautiful place. The water was almost a crystal blue. There were birds singing. I dipped my muzzle into the cool water and took a nice drink from it. Moonshine did the same. I finished first and stared at her beautiful coat and her beautiful form. Yes...perfect. She lifted her head and looked at me in question. \"What are you staring at?\" I quickly looked away and blushed a rosy pink. \"Nothing Moonshine...nothing. It's just...\" I looked into her beautiful eyes. \"You have the most beautiful eyes and you are perfect in every way.\" I smiled at her and nickered softly, showing her my honesty. She blushed deeply and turned away. \"Why...that's the most sweetest thing anyone has ever said to me. Thank you. And you have the most handsome smile.\" \"Thank you...Moonshine.\" It was that moment I knew I had to tell her. \"Moonshine...look at me. I need to tell you something.\" She looked at me again. \"What?\" \"I-I...I love you!\" There. I said it. \"I love you very much, Moonshine.\" She wrapped her neck around mine and close her eyes hardly. \"I love you too.\" We stood in that position for what seemed like hours, but it was only a couple of minutes. We broke away from each other slowly and looked into each others eyes lovingly. Suddenly, I heard a whistle. It was a familiar whistle. My ears pricked up. It was Rob calling me. I spoke to the love of my life. \"I am afraid that I will have to go,\" I replied to her. She nodded. I knew she understood. \"Can I walk with you?\" I nodded. We started walking together toward the gate. Rob looked at me with a warm look. \"Looks like you found yourself a girlfriend there.\" He patted me, then laughed a jolly laugh. \"Looks like I'm going to have to put you two next together. Come on.\" He tied the lead rope to my halter and he tied another to her halter. \"Let's go you two.\" He clicked his tongue and we followed him into the stable. Rob did just as he said he would do. He put us next to each other. I nickered to Moonshine happily. \"I'm so happy that we are together,\" I replied. \"Me too. Now we could talk for hours and stuff.\" We started talking for what seemed like hours and hours. It was soon nine o' clock. Time to sleep. .

Wish I did, but I don't. I do, however, own Callista Santiago and anythingrnrelated to her, such as family, past, etc. x3 If Irnowned all that other stuff, then I'd be rich. And very happy. But I'm not. This is not historically correct. Frank T. Hopkinsrnnever actually met this girl, nor did he ever take part in the plot given.rnNope. It's all my overactive imagination doing the work. X3 There was a Prologue to this, but it was taken down.rnIt seems that the character that this was originally going to be in this storyrnis considered a Mary Sue. And if that person thinks that they must flame again,rnthey better damn well not give me the same crap about this chapter. And I don'trnknow if she realizes this, but most OCs are considered Mary Sues, regardless ofrnhow descriptive their story. If they have a relationship with a canonrncharacter, they are considered Mary Sues. ----- \"What do you mean that I don't have a horse to ride?rnWhat about Blaze?\" Frank Hopkins exclaimed, arms spread wide in frustration asrnhe argued with the official for the race that would be starting in naught but arnhalf hour. The race he planned to win. Since he had let Hidalgo go less than two years ago, hisrnracing skills suddenly had come to a halt. The winnings began to dwindle, andrnslowly the whiskey became his best friend again. It was only after an oldrnfriend of his, Mark Holloway, punched him one night and yelled at him to getrnhis life back, did he begin racing again. But it still wasn't the same asrnracing with 'little brother'. Hidalgornwas his reason to race. It wasn't about the money or the gloating he could do.rnIt was about being able to be out there with his horse, running a race. He had tried to move on. He had thought he had foundrna horse that could replace Hidalgo,rnnamed Jade. He was a white stallion, one of the highly bred ones that he wasrngiven by another old friend to ride for awhile saying 'he never had the time tornride the poor thing'. Some big fancy bloodline from the past, and a fieryrntemper was about what the horse was. There was a reason the horse wasn't riddenrnover, and Frank knew it wasn't because the poor owner didn't have time. It wasrnbecause the animal was too damn stubborn to slow down when running. The horsernhad to be at the front of the group no matter what, even if it meant killingrnitself in the process. One race later, Frank decided he needed a new horse. That's when he had found Blaze. The brown stallionrnwas a perfect replica of the fancy horses that you saw in children's picturernbooks. A white star on its forehead, with a black mane and tail accented thernbrown of its coat. Fast and young, but it knew when to listen to the rider. Andrnthe horse he had got cheap, from the same guy who gave him Jade. This would'vernbeen the third race with the stallion, if this hadn't happened. The black haired black mustached man blinked,rnfurrowing his brows. \"Blaze, monsieur? You mean the horse that got free--\"He wasrnquickly cut off. \"—got free!\" Frank exclaimed. \"HOW do you lose arnhorse that is that TAME?\" He growled, glaring with a cold stare at the manrnacross form him. Blaze was a very tame horse. He hadn't ever run before, butrnthen again, these men could've been complete imbeciles and spooked the animal. The man took a hesitant step backwards. \"Um, Mr.rnHopkins, monsieur, we shall get you a new horse immediately.\" He stumbledrnthrough the words, as if English was a different language than what he knew,rnand it was all because of fear. He turned, quickly leaving the small officernthat they had been talking in, glad that he could get away from the angeredrnrider. Back inside, Frank sighed, rubbing his forehead withrna hand. He needed to win this damn race. The riders around here were supposedrnto be good enough so that if you won you could get your name sounding goodrnagain. But if this was a premonition for how the race was going to turn out, hernmight as well resign his position. This wouldn't look good for him at all. Hisrncareer was already going downhill, so why doesn't he just pile on some more. A few minutes of silence later, the old wooden doorrnof the office flew open, Frank stepping out as he slipped the old cream cowboyrnhat back over his sandy hair. \"So where is this ass with my horse?\" He grumbledrnin a tired tone, voice gruff from the dust that was in the old room. His gazerntraveled from the people walking towards the stands that were set up for thernrace, to the group of four people mounted, chatting with each other with theirrnown stares at the riders warming up. There was the sound of hooves against the dry earth,rnand the incoherent mumblings of the official whom Frank had blown up atrnearlier. Frank pivoted on his heels, rubbing his forehead, deciding it was inrnhis best interest to not look up at the horse yet, until his mind had decidedrnto stop trying to picture it. Of course, it wasn't the prettiest of pictures,rneither. A short, old thing that would barely even trot, let alone gallop likernwhat was needed for the race. \"Monsieur?\" The official finally asked, a handrnplaying nervously with the gold pocket watch in his pocket, the other holdingrnthe reins to the horse. Frank lowered his hand after a few more seconds of thernuneasy silence, the only sound being the stomping of the antsy stallion. Hernheld in a sigh of relief, glad to see that the horse was at least not old, norrnout of shape. The horse could not have been more than five or sixrnyears old, though the fire in its chocolate eyes revealed the spirit of a colt.rnIts coat was a bay shade, patches of white on its rump. The black mane flew uprnas the horse shook its head in boredom, stomping a hoof against the groundrnagain. Its tail, also black, swayed back and forth, flicking away a flyrnquickly, before it fell still. Frank circled it, scratching his chin with his thumbrnas he thought it over. \"Does he have a name?\" He finally asked, eyes movingrnfrom examining the stallions legs to the official who was still standing there,rnmumbling. \"Oui, Thunder.\"rnHe said looking up from the pocket watch he had finally pulled out. Hernhad jumped slightly when Frank spoke again, thinking that the rider would gornoff on him for not bringing him a good enough horse. \"Thunder.\" Frank repeated, beginning to think itrnover again. A small smirk crossed his face, reaching his right hand out to patrnthe horse's neck. \"Well, Thunder, looks like we've got a race to compete in.\"rnHe took the reins from the shorter man, he stumbling through a 'glad you likernhim' speech. Frank waved his other hand to silence the man. He clicked hisrntongue softly, leading the horse over to saddle him up. ----- \"All right, here be the rundown. Henry, you run downrnto handle the last section. Cass, you take second to last. Justin, you take thernsecond, and I'll cover the first.\" After each name and location was called, wasrna small nod from one of the four riders Frank had spotted earlier. The speaker was an older man, the black of his hairrnbeginning to show signs of graying. His old black cowboy hat, perched on thernsaddle horn in front of him, was lifted, set on top of his messy locks. \"Ya'llrnget movin' now. You've gotta get a good head start from the racers.\" There was a nod of heads from the other three asrnthey broke up, steering their horses towards the track and nudging them intornswift canters. Two of them took the lead, horses staying in line with eachrnother. \"So, Cassie, why aren't' you out there competin'?\"rnThe first asked, a smirk crossing his face as he switched his jade gaze fromrnthe path ahead of him to the figure next to him. He was well built andrnmuscular, probably a few years younger than the person next to him. Brown locksrnin loose curls were pulled back behind him, held in place at the nape of hisrnneck. \"Ah, I dunno, Henry. Thought it might be nice to getrnto watch part of the race instead of being in the middle of it…that a badrnthing?\" It said, clearly the other rider being female. She was a pretty little thing, beneath the dust andrndirt already covering her and her clothes. Her hair was a mixture of blonde andrnbrown, being dead straight, nothing very fancy. Around her face the strands gotrnshorter as you went up, that would be left hanging if she ever pulled her hairrnback. The messy of locks was hidden under an old straw cowboy hat, a brownrnpiece of braided leather being the hatband. Her eyes were a bright green, thern'exotic' color of the trees in the rainforest. Behind them a gunshot was heard, both looking atrneach other, a grin crossing Henry's face in mock challenge. The other two inrnthe party had long since stopped in their respective positions, ready to dorntheir job of watching for cheaters in the race. Not that they usually did it.rnThe really just wanted to see who was in the lead when the riders made it torntheir spot. Henry clicked his tongue, urging the paint stallion to go faster.rnCass, on the other hand, slowed down, nearing her spot to stop. \"See you at the end, Hen.\" She called up to him,rnturning once the horse had slowed to a walk to the small patch alongside therntrack where she was stationed, waiting for the horses to fly by. ----- BANG. The shot rang out after the countdown was made, thernriders nudging their horses as they took off. Frank was among the front runners,rnThunder keeping up with the other horses. Frank grinned; beginning to havernsecond thoughts on the horse who he thought would be his downfall. So far,rnThunder obeyed him. Three fourths of the race later, Thunder began tornget antsy. He sped up, wanting to get even farther ahead of the group that theyrnalready had a good lead in front of. Frank pulled back on the reins gently,rnsaying a quickly whoa, Thunder snorting and disobeying. \"C'mon Thunder, don't do this to me now.\" He said,rnfollowed by a slur of curses as he pulled back harder on the reins. Thunderrnstopped this time, however, he quickly bucked up, sending a shocked Frankrnthrough the air, his hat flying and landing not far away. Thunder just snorted,rnshaking his head as he ran off. \"Shit!\" Frank yelled, before there was a rather sickening crunch as his headrncollided with a tree, everything quickly fading into black without warning. After Frank's yell, Callista, or Cass, as she wasrncalled, blinked, stepping out onto the track, looking towards the direction ofrnthe yell. There wasn't a horse in sight, but there was a body, with blood. Sherncursed. \"C'mon, Chase.\" She urged, trotting over towards the unconscious Frank.rnShe jumped down off the horse, kneeling next to Frank as she rolled him over,rnhe having landed face down in the dirt. \"C'mon, love.\" She said, arms reaching around underrnhis armpits and hooking together across his chest, pulling him out of the wayrnof the riders before anymore came. She clicked her tongue again, Chasernobediently following. She went back to grab his hat, managing to tie it to herrnsaddle bag. Strength was not Miss Santiago's forte; keep inrnmind, so lifting him onto the horse was a rather hard thing to do. She sighed,rnmanaging to stand him up and get her shoulder in his stomach before he fellrnforward, arm wrapping around behind his legs and getting to her feet. Afterrnstaggering a few steps she managed to balance herself somewhat, grabbingrnChase's reins and with a growling 'oof', tossing him up into the saddle, grabbingrnhim and rolling him over before he could fall off. Now, he was lying on hisrnstomach in the saddle. Cass grabbed the horn and the back of the saddle,rnflinging one leg over and managing to sit on the back of the saddle, Frankrntaking up the place where you were supposed to sit. She rested a hand on hisrnback, nudging Chase into a walk, headed back towards her ranch. At least therernshe could give him some medical treatment for his head, which was stillrnbleeding. She grabbed a dagger in its case from her boot,rnwhich she had stuck there incase needed, picking up the tan sash around herrnwaist with her other hand, cutting off the bottom of one end. She stashed awayrnthe dagger after putting it back in its sheath, applying pressure to the woundrnto at least stop the bleeding. \"Only about fifteen minutes.\" She muttered,rnkeeping the horse moving. \"Fifteen minutes.\" ----- Author Notes: The Chapter is long, I know. X.xrnSorry, I got a bit carried away with writing. Plus, I wanted to introduce Cassrnbefore the second chapter. Please R&R;, and no flames. Otherwise my flamerneating chicken will get a treat. X3[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I don't own hidalgo or Frank.nWish I did, but I don't. I do, however, own Callista Santiago andnanything related to her, such as family, past, etc. x3 If I owned allnthat other stuff, then I'd be rich. And very happy. But I'm not. Thisnis not historically correct. Frank T. Hopkins never actually met thisngirl, nor did he ever take part in the plot given. Nope. It's allnmy overactive imagination doing the work. X3 ----- ThenSun was quick to rise up over the landscape of South Dakota, castingngolden rays onto the trees, grass, and any other object within theirnpaths; pinks and reds spreading into the sky that would soon become anlight, baby blue with small balls of white drifting lazily along. Thenbirds had not even woken up from their sleep to greet the new day,nthe chirping leaving silence in the air. Occasionally, the softnbreeze would ruffle the leaves of the trees or a faint whinny fromnone of the pastures with a horse already turned out would breaknthrough. Thenlight was what awoke Frank, shining straight into his eyes throughnthe window of the room where he had been deposited. He rolled overncoming close to the edge of the king size bed, an arm slumping overnthe side dangling towards the thick off-white rug that covered thenwooden flooring of the room. A groan escaped his lips, the thoughtsnof going back to sleep soon vanishing to the pounding of his heart innhis head. Thenfallen arm was soon reached up, oblivious to the fact that he was notnin his hotel room or on the race track and instead in a house wherenhe didn't even know the owner. He was shocked to find bandagesnwrapped tightly around it, and no cowboy hat. Grumbling somethingnthat sounded like some curses, he reached a hand up to the wooden endntable, trying to find his needed accessory. Instead, his hand wrappednaround a piece of parchment that was folded in half, a loopy scrawlnof his name written on it. Franknarched a brow. Tilting his head slightly, opening it as he proppednhis torso up with his elbows, and now facing the iron headboard. Asnhe slowly read it he blinked, slowly taking in what had actuallynhappened. Younmight not remember what happened to you, but if you want answers,ncome on downstairs for breakfast and I'll explain. Itnwas really helpful, no? Sliding his legs off the bed andnsitting up, rubbing his eyes, he looked around. His gaze finally didnland on his beloved hat, along with his newly bought gun, bothnresting on an old wooden table that had some papers stacked in randomnpiles. As he walked over and picked them up, he checked to make surenthe gun was loaded, keeping himself calm even though he had no ideanwhere in the hell he was or what happened. They had to have been on anranch, and if he was brought here and patched up, wouldn't thatnmean that they meant no harm? Henopened the door, the smell of cooking bacon and eggs reaching him,nfollowing it downstairs. His eyes glanced to the wall along thenstairs long enough to spot a portrait of a young girl on the back ofna horse, sitting sidesaddle in a dress. He arched a brow, ponderingnit over. Was this their daughter? It looked old, so she must'vengrown up by now. Henturned a corner and found himself in the kitchen of the house,nradiating a mixture of smells of breakfast. He took a few more stepsnin, boots clicking against the wooden floors of the house.

You took a pretty nasty fall.\"nHer voice sounded cheerful and warm, though an edge was always as thenend of each statement that was almost a warning. She gave him a smallngrin, taking a seat in one of the wooden chairs around the table,nmotioning to the one across from her. \"Take a seat and dig in.\"nShe offered. Frankntook the offer up without a word, though a million more questionsnbegan buzzing in the back of his mind. He watched her for a momentnbefore he took a bite of toast. \"You mind telling me who in thenhell you are and why I'm here?\" He arched a brow in slightnsuspicion, before he looked to his plate and resumed eating. \"CallistanSantiago, at your service.\" Shensaid, taking a drink of water. \"Friends call me Cass.

Nothing to it.\" Henmuttered, becoming annoyed with himself when he realized what anstupid move he had done and how bad he probably looked. \"Did younfind that bastard of an animal?\" \"Nope,nit ran off before I got there.\" She rested her elbows on eithernside of her plate, her fingers intertwining under her chin. \"So,ncowboy, you got a name? Or would you prefer I call you 'cowboy'?\"nA small smirk tugged at the corners of her lips, arching a brownslightly. \"Frank.nFrank Hopkins.\" Cassnblinked, her face paling slightly, and if her hands hadn't beennunder her chin her jaw would've dropped. She was sitting acrossnfrom the best long distance racer in the world. And yet, she didn'tnrecognize him. \"You…you're Frank Hopkins?\" She asked. She wasnnot only shocked that he was here, but that he was the one who hadnbeen bucked off his horse. \"But…\" \"What?nI'm not allowed to mess up? Whoopdedo, sister, it happens. You'vendone it once or twice, I'm sure.\" He grumbled, getting rathernhostile about the topic. Cass picked up on it easily, and rolled herneyes, beginning to get annoyed. \"Coolnit, cowboy.\" She said, standing up as she dropped her fork on hernplate with a clatter, picking up the plate and empty cup and dumpingnit in the sink. Frank followed suit, before cutting in front of her,nlooking down into her eyes. It was Cass who spoke, however. \"Younand I aren't going to work.\" She said, gaze not wavering from hisnown. When she did break away, her feet carried her to the back door,nhand picking up her cowboy hat from the counter. \"I'm heading tonthe barn.

All if the guilt from hiding and all of the guilt from running had built up and suddenly there was a dam that shut in him, taking away his ability to function. There was only one thing left to do, the right thing to do. \"I already am one,\" he breathed out, looking at the ground. David could tell that he had caught Nathan by surprise as the elder man set down his gun and walked towards the younger man. At first they just sat together in silence for a few moments before Nathan broke it with the obvious question, \"You've got a kid?\" David nodded, \"A little girl.\" As the conversation continued David felt all of the tidbits the guys had ever said about religion swarming around in his head, starting to form together, even more, starting to sound believable. When he heard Nathan ask what was holding him back, he thought hard and tried to find the rope that kept him back, but it felt as though it had been cut. There was absolutely nothing holding him back, why would there be something holding you back from something so wonderful? That's exactly what he told Nathan. \"What should I do?\" David asked Nathan. He just accepted God, but where he still didn't have a concept of where to start with Amanda and Olivia. \"Pray about it,\" was Nathan's simple response. \"And then,\" David prodded. \"And then you should have the answer, but if not, keep praying.\" As the Resolution signing got closer and closer, David got even more excited. Every night he got down on his knees and prayed about Amanda and Olivia. He spent his free time thinking up ways that he could support them, ways that he might be able to grow close to his daughter. As he stood before William Barrett, David felt responsible. He knew, reciting those words, that he was responsible for the two girls that he had abandoned. He knew he needed their forgiveness and he knew that he would do whatever it took to get that. AN- I hope to expand on this, sorry that it was so short.

She had been young, naïve, and alone; a baby hadn't been a part of her plan. She'd had dreams that were already too big to include raising a child, or even carrying one to term. So she'd had an abortion. And that had chipped away at her soul for years. She'd been so proud, so scared, and so determined, and looking back she realized that she hadn't even really thought it through before she'd had it done. For two years afterward, she'd gone about her life, outwardly pretending that nothing had changed while feeling more broken than ever inside. Then her grandmother had called her up and practically begged her to attend Easter services with her. Realizing that the old woman wasn't going to be dissuaded, Kayla had given in. As a child, she'd gone to church often enough to have sat under the salvation message numerous times, but she truly heard it for the first time on that Easter. The emotional walls that she'd spent years erecting had crumbled during that service. She'd prayed – really prayed – for the first time, throwing her tattered shreds of a life at Jesus' feet and begging Him to forgive her for all she'd done against Him.

When Dylan turned on the lamp on his night stand, Jade turned off the main light and sat down on the edge of Dylan's bed with Jackson in her arms, wondering what exactly Dylan was going to come up with. Jordan curled up beside her. Though her younger brother was usually, in her opinion, a bother, tonight he had clung to her, and she found that she clung right back. Protecting him, taking care of him. Tonight he wasn't a bother, he was a brother, her brother, and he and Jackson needed her. (Excerpt from \"Because I Care,\" chapter 15, section 2) When Jade Hayes was woken up from a deep sleep, the first thought that made it through the fog of her sleep-muddled brain was surprise that she had fallen asleep at all. After all, her family's home, along with numerous others', had been burned down that very evening; thus her current sleeping accommodations – Dylan Mitchell's sleeping bag on the floor of his bedroom with the other four members of her family filling up the small space around her. Everyone who had been affected by the fires was going to be staying with the Mitchells at their house until further notice as they rebuilt their lives. The second thing that Jade noticed was what – or rather, who – had caused her to wake up. Five year old Jordan knelt on the floor beside her, looking down on her with eyes that were far too bright, considering the fact that it was just a little past midnight. \"Jade?\" he whispered softly. \"What?\" she asked, her voice sharpening with an annoyance that came far too easily when it came to this brother of hers. Her attitude towards him softened, though, when she noticed the small tremor in his voice as he asked, \"Can I sleep with you?\" She glanced at the pallet that had been made for Jordan and Jackson; it wasn't even two feet away from the sleeping bag, and Jordan always moved around a lot when he slept, which would probably mean an elbow in her back at some point during the night should she let him sleep with her. Looking a little closer at Jordan, though, she realized that the reason that his eyes were glistening wasn't energy – he looked as exhausted as she was – but, rather, tears. Of course the little boy was scared. So was she, really, and he had even less of a grip on what was going on than she did. She smiled softly up at him, hoping it looked reassuring, and quietly unzipped the blue sleeping bag. \"Sure you can.\" He smiled a little and climbed in beside her, burying his face in her chest as she zipped the sleeping bag back up. She wrapped her arms around her brother and kissed the top of his head before squirming around to get as comfortable as was possible. Yes, Jordan could be a big pain, and he was one of the greatest tests of her patience, but he was her brother, and she would help to ease him through this rocky transition as best as she could.

Derrick genuinely cares. He did then and he does now. Probably, I think that his emotions have gotten stronger with time. Adoration, infatuation, regret - I know that all of these are inside of him in connection with me. I've been told as much per my father and the letters that Derrick has written to me personally over the past four years. As for my own feelings towards him, I honestly have no idea what they are. Some days I think that maybe I return his feelings. Other days I'm just as equally sure that it was only a freshman crush on an upperclassman (or at least he would have been an upperclassman had he not been held back in his schoolwork). So, the point is, I go back and forth a lot when it comes to the nature of my feelings for Derrick Freeman. But one way or the other, I somehow ended up here at the Doherty County Jail waiting for him to be released. And that must mean something; I knew it did, and he would know it too. And then there he was, stepping into the room where I was waiting Seeing her there took me way back, back to the time before I'd spent four years in juvie. She looked the same, but different somehow, considering the four years that had passed since I had last seen her face to face. Time and hardships had stolen the naivety from Jade Hayes' face, even though the uncertainty behind her large, amber eyes seemed to have grown. When she smiled at me, it was a nervous, almost fake smile. She wasn't sure that she wanted to be here. \"Jade,\" he said in surprise after the short moment it took for him to either realize who she was or simply take her in, whichever he had been doing. I stood and smiled nervously. \"Hey.\" \"Hey,\" he grinned too, and without another word between us we walked out of that jail. I knew that the world must've seemed as bright as ever to Derrick just then, but suddenly - with him physically there beside me - life was seeming pretty rife with promise for me as well.

It just barely missed its goal as he flattened himself against the side of his and David Thomson's patrol car. Nathan Hayes really didn't know whether or not he was going to make it out of this shoot-out alive. It was becoming increasingly clear to him that it would take an act of God to get him out of here. Then things went from bad to worse. He popped up from behind the hood of the car and pulled the trigger of his gun once again – but nothing happened. Horror shot through him as he realized that he had no more ammunition. \"God, get us out of here!\" he cried, once again falling behind the shelter provided by their vehicle. In the next instant, David called out, \"I see Shane coming! Our backup is here, Nathan!\" Within the next two minutes, Nathan, David, Shane, and a couple of their coworkers, quickly got the upper hand on the criminal gang members that that they had been fighting with.

(6:26) My father died a soldier's death overseas before I was even in school. My mother was sick – the cancer came back again, and the doctor's said they didn't know if she had the strength to fight it off a third time. I barely managed to graduate from the Training Center, meaning that I barely managed to become a deputy at all. I had long resigned myself to the fact that there was no way that I was going to get the job that I had always dreamed of having as a little kid – I had wanted to become a Marine, to follow in the footsteps of the deceased father that I couldn't even remember. I wasn't even very good at the job that I had managed to get, although my partner, Adam Mitchell, and the two others that we worked with, Nathan Hayes and David Thomson, never said so. The point was my life up to that point had pretty much turned out to be one big, major, unfairly hard disappointment. At only nineteen, I, the pretty much pathetic Bobby Shaw, had been ready to give up. And not just in the way that meant I would become sullen and depressed – I was already at that point – but in a big way. Suicide. I was eighteen the first time the thought crossed my mind – the day the results of my physical told me that there was no way I would be getting into the Marines, or even the army. During the next year, the thought had kept reappearing at the particularly low points of my life. When I failed my first class at the Training Center. When Mom told me the cancer was back – and if I hadn't known that my death would've been the end of her, I really would have done it that time. But somehow I got the feeling that my life was going to start turning around when I was first introduced to Adam Mitchell. I didn't know how – and I certainly didn't expect it to happen the way it did – but I just had the feeling that life was going to start getting better for me. And it did. In Adam I found a confidant, a friend, and the father-figure that I had never before had. I told him about my father's death and my mother's cancer. He had prayed for her and for me right then and there and I had bowed my head and went along with him, though at the time I hadn't put much stock in religion of any sort, let alone the thought that there was a caring God somewhere who cared about my problems. A year later though, after an extended amount of time around the Mitchells, the Hayes, the Martinez's, and the Thomson's, I found myself believing what they said about God and Christianity. That summer I took the LORD Jesus Christ as my Savior. From there on out, my life was so much better. And it became even greater when I was able to see the day that my mother was saved as well. When she finally lost her ongoing battle with the cancer two months later, I grieved, as anyone would when they lose their parent, but I found a measure of comfort in the fact that I would see her again when I reached Heaven, and in the fact that she was already there with Jesus. Now, with the LORD and the sheriff's deputies on my side, I was no longer suicidal. I was even at peace when things came my way because I knew that between my God and my friends, I would make it through whatever might come up in my life. Another person in our four-guys-and-their-families group who has made my life so much better is Jade Hayes. Don't ask me how it happened, or how she lost her very smart mind long enough for it to happen, because I'm not really sure, but she and I began to date when she turned seventeen. And after four years of dating, we got married. She's everything to me now, odd couple that I know we make – Nathan was sure to point out numerous times while we were dating that he had never seen us as a couple coming. But it works, and it works well, if I may say so myself. I've never been happier. I'm not much for writing, but I decided that I wanted to write this down today for you while I was thinking about it, realizing how far I had come over the past eight years. I think that maybe in ten years or so I'll show it to you. I'll tell you how Jade and I laughed until we cried yesterday when she told me she was expecting you. How much my mother would have loved to meet you. By then I'll be able to tell you how Adam, Victoria, the Hayes, and everyone else reacted when we told them that you were coming. I'll be able to tell you how proud I am that you're like your mother, or how sorry I am that you got my nose. I'll be able to tell you what it felt like to sign the same Resolution that the others in our group have. I'll tell you how impatient I was to meet you as I sat here writing this. I'll tell you how very much I love you already, little child of mine.

(32:26) Hey, maybe someday I'll visit TJ or Antoine. Nathan had said that when he was waiting with Adam for their passes into the jail to see Mike Hollis and Derrick Freeman respectively. He had said it when he was with his friend, \"under the influence,\" so to speak, of another Christian man. But the thing was, now that he was alone, now that he had actually said it, and even though it was still on his mind, he really didn't want to do it. Unfortunately, God had left the matter on his heart, and, a week later, he still couldn't get away from it. So, after a week of struggling with it, he had given up, and was now walking through the jail on his way to visit TJ. It went without saying that he was nervous. \"Why am I even doing this, God?\" he prayed to himself as he sat down on his side of the glass partition in the visitor's room. He set his Bible down on the counter in front of him. He really didn't know why he had brought the Book: TJ would probably tell him to get lost as soon as he saw it. But maybe, on some off chance that the had-been gang member wouldn't… well, that would be a good thing. Nathan had no further time to dwell on the variables because a guard was currently bringing TJ in. The intimidating man sat down on the opposite side of the pane of shatterproof glass, his suspicion-filled black orbs boring into Nathan's own eyes. \"Watchya doin' here?\" TJ asked, his voice as hard as his eyes. Nathan decided to be honest with the other man. \"I told a friend that I would come see you.\" TJ smirked, asking, \"You Jesus freaks put each other up to junk like this?\" Nathan allowed a tight smile to come onto his face as he quoted, \"'Provoke unto love and to good works.'\" \"What?\" \"That's Hebrews 10:24.\" Nathan informed him. \"That's in that Book of yours, huh?\" TJ asked. Though the gangster tried to keep his expression hard, or at least neutral, Nathan thought that he might have seen a spark of real curiosity in TJ's eyes as he asked, \"So, what else is in there?\" Nathan listed off a few Bible stories and miracles before he got to the one that he knew that TJ needed to hear about the most – the story of the Crucifixion. He opened his Bible and began to read the story directly from the Gospels, choosing to look at the Word instead of the eyes of the man in front of him. During the whole time that he was reading, TJ never said a word, appearing to actually listen instead. When Nathan stood to go though, TJ asked, \"You gonna come back and see me again, or have you done enough t' make yer buddy happy?\" Nathan found himself nodding. \"Yeah, I'll come back next week, okay?\" TJ nodded tersely and watched as Nathan left the visitor's area. As Nathan stepped out of the jailhouse into the outdoors where he was once more breathing the air of free men, he was deep in thought again. He didn't know what to think about the fact that TJ wanted him to come back and visit with him again. Maybe it was a Jonah-like attitude to have, but Nathan didn't know if he actually wanted to come back. He would, because he had told TJ that he would, but did he really want to? After all, it was TJ. Would it really be worth it to take the time to extend his friendship to him, or even just to share the Gospel with a man like TJ? He knew that he wasn't the one who got to make that judgment call, so why not? Why not come back next week and spend an hour with him, just to see what happened? So, exactly one week later, Nathan was to be found walking into the same room in the same building and sitting in the same spot. But by the look on the face of the man who sat down across from him, Nathan just might not be talking to the same TJ. It couldn't be the same guy. The man that he was looking at looked like he was happy . He was even smiling . This man shared TJ's features, his voice sounded like TJ's, but surely this wasn't TJ. \"Hey, man,\" TJ offered as Nathan sat down. \"Hi,\" Nathan returned, hoping that he didn't sound as confused as he felt. And then he saw it. There, in TJ's huge hands, was a new, black Bible. Seeing what Nathan's gaze had fallen to, TJ looked down at the Bible as well. Starting to trace the glittering, gold lettering on the cover, TJ began to talk. \"You wanna know what the worst thing about bein' in this place is?\" Nathan raised his eyebrows in an inquiry of sorts. \"I got nothin' t' do… nothin' t' do but sit in my cell and think. So, when ya' left last week, that's what I did. I got back to m' cell, an' when the guard left me there by myself, I sat down on m' bunk an' I thought about what ya' had said and read t' me. For three days it wouldn't leave me alone. Then I got up the nerve up t' talk t' that preacher guy that shows up here every coupla weeks; William somebody.\" \"Barrett.\" Nathan supplied, smiling to himself. TJ nodded, too lost in his own thoughts to Nathan's changed expression. \"An' the two of us got t' talkin' 'bout what ya' said.\" Here TJ met Nathan's eyes again. \"An' it turns out that ya' were right. Jesus did die for me on that cross, an' that day when the preacher came, He saved me, too.\" Again, TJ actually smiled. \"Ya' don't mind that I asked the preacher not t' tell ya', do ya'? I wanted t' tell ya' myself.\" Nathan shook his head. \"I don't mind at all; in fact, I think that it did me better to hear it from you.\" The two men talked for a little while longer before Nathan left the jail feeling full of praise and more than a little humbled. He leaned back against the bumper of his truck and looked up at the blue sky that was hovering above the parking lot. \"God,\" he prayed. \"I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I was so doubtful of Your abilities, that I have been so prejudiced against TJ, and so unwilling to be a witness to him. Thank you for sending William to him, for saving him, and for reminding me that there isn't anyone or 'any thing too hard for' You to do a work in. In the name of Your Son, Jesus Christ. Amen.\" As Nathan slid behind the wheel of his truck, he pulled out his phone and called up his friend. \"Hello?\" the voice on the other end of the phone asked. \"Hey, it's Nathan. Man, Adam, you're never going to believe what's happened.\" Another piece for my \"Highlights\" series.

Nathan sighed and returned his gaze to his hands clasped tightly in his lap. When the silence between them became too lengthy, William added, \"And, besides, I thought that you were thrilled when TJ was saved.\" \"I was – I am.\" Nathan answered hastily, mentally scrambling for a way to explain himself. \"Then why did you ask why the Lord would save TJ?\" William inquired. Nathan flinched upon hearing how the question sounded, explaining, \"It's not really 'why would God save TJ;' it's 'why then won't He save so many others?' Like… why TJ and not Derrick?\" William say back in his recliner, eyes filling with thought as he asked, \"Why you, then, Nathan?\" Nathan's eyes snapped up to his, alarmed. \"Well, no offense, so don't take this the wrong way, but I'm kind of a lot better than TJ.\" William raised his eyebrows. \"No, you're not, and not just because you're human, either. Nathan, do you remember the young man I got a hold of days before he was beaten in to a gang?\" Again, Nathan flinched, nodding as he remembered the boy that he had been. \"Was that boy any better than TJ?\" Nathan shook his head. \"You're right; he wasn't – and Nathan? – He still isn't.\" William leaned towards him. \"If you consider where you were when you were when you were saved versus where TJ is now, I don't understand how you can have this attitude.\" \"He's in prison!\" Nathan objected. \"So is Shane.

About his family life, and the way that he grew up?\" Nathan shook his head. \"I've only visited with him twice.\" Unsurprised, William nodded. \"I didn't think he had, but I wish that he would have. From what he's told me, I think that it would change your attitude towards him.\" \"Oh yeah?\"asked Nathan, sitting back and crossing his arms over his chest. It was as if he was daring William to just try and change his mind. He looked so much like the confused, yet hard-nosed teenager that William had begun investing in all of those years ago that – even though the sight was really a little sad – the older of the two men almost smiled. Instead, William Barrett continued talking to Nathan, relaying what TJ had revealed to him. \"He grew up a lot like you did, Nathan.\" Nathan lowered his head again, not surprised, but still not wanting to hear it, nonetheless. \"He was raised by a single mother who had five kids, all of them from different men. That left TJ with two brothers, as many sisters, and him being the oldest of them all. It also means that he had to see all of those other guys that hung around his mother coming and then going, never taking any responsibility for whatever happened while they were there… never caring a bit for TJ. \"You remember what that's like, don't you, son?\" Nathan bit his lip as he stared down at his hands. Yeah, he remembered, all right. \"So, having pretty much the same background as you have, he started down the same path that you started down at seventeen – getting jumped into the Gangster Nation. The only difference between the two of you is that no one stopped him from doing it.\" Nathan blinked in surprise at William's frankness as he looked back up at the man in front of him. He felt a swell of gratitude rise up in him as he realized once again how much of a turning point the arrival of William Barrett in his life had been. \"So, you're saying that you saved me from being in TJ's shoes?\" \"No, I'm saying that God saved you – a wannabe gangster who didn't get what he thought he wanted – the same exact way that he saved TJ – a gangster who ended up getting way more than he bargained for. \"The bottom line here is, Nathan, that 'My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD.' Who are we to question what the holy and perfect, sinless God has done, especially when it comes to the salvation of His saints? Are we really going to hold such a grudge that we can't even rejoice when He does save someone? So what if the person that He chose to save seems like a questionable choice? From what I understand of the man, I'm sure that John Newton seemed like a questionable choice as well, and look what God did through him! You never know, Nathan.\" \"I know that,\" Nathan admitted. \"Then you're not going to come to me anymore with unreasonable questions based on questionable logic, right?\" William asked. Nathan smiled at the odd wording of the question as he nodded. \"Good,\" William smiled too. \"Now, how are things going with Derrick? Do you think that he's softening to the Gospel?\" \"Oh, absolutely!\" Nathan answered enthusiastically. \"He's still reading everything that I give him, and then even asking for more.\" \"That's good, you never know what God could do there, then, right?\" Nathan's grin widened as he answered, \"Right.\" This is written kind of as a sequel to \"Jeremiah.\" The verse that William quotes is Isaiah 55:8 (KJV), BTW.

(6:8) For Corporal Adam Mitchell, talking to Sergeant Higgins about the possibility of one of his guys stealing drugs was both a troubling experience and a relief. Of course he was bothered by the idea that one of his coworkers was possibly doing something like that, but it also felt good to get that burden off of his chest a little by sharing to with someone else. Yeah, he felt awful admitting that he thought the thief was one of his friends, but another part of him knew that if that was actually the case – if Nathan, Shane, or David were the thief – then justice would need to be served all the same. Even if people got hurt, and in this situation someone – probably him and some others – was bound to, he still had to do the right thing. \"I forgive you.\" It had been hard to force those words through his lips. It had been even harder to actually mean them. But as he had stared through the glass at Shane – his partner, his friend, the man he felt had somehow betrayed him and whom he had in a sense betrayed in return – he had meant every word that he said. He had meant it when he said that he forgave Shane, and he had meant it when he said that would look out for Shane's son, Tyler. Yes, Shane had done wrong, but he was still Shane, and Adam still loved him like the brother that he had never had. And it was then – sitting there opposite Shane – that the truly humbling thought hit him. Were it not for God's grace in his life, his and Shane's places could very well have been switched. Were it not for the way that God had blessed in Adam's life, it could be him on the other side of that glass. He could be the one sitting in jail, losing his freedom and his relationships with his friends and family. Adam left the jailhouse with that thought still firmly ingrained in his mind. Shane hadn't followed the commandments in God's Word, hadn't truly pursued a relationship with their Heavenly Father and look where it had gotten him. As Adam drove his truck out of the parking lot, he made himself a promise. He would pursue a relationship with his God, he would do what was good and right, he would follow the commandments of his Lord, and he would do his best to walk in his Father's footsteps.

Walter shook his head silently before admitting, \"That was our last guy.\" Frank's hand moved to massage his forehead, trying to stave off an impending headache. \"Can you think of anyone else who might work for the position?\" Walter took a minute to think before replying, \"You know I thought Robert Nelson was our best bet, and we marked him off the list last week. After this last guy, I'm not figuring on anyone.\" Frank nodded. He really couldn't blame his friend for that. After all, if you don't bet, that means you can't lose anything. He leaned back in his office chair and his gaze wondered over the employees that were making their way to the break room further down the hall. His eye was caught by the newcomer to the group of seasoned employees that were currently clustered together. Why was that man – who had been with the company less than three months – with some of his best guys? \"Hey, Walter,\" Frank nodded towards the man through the window. \"Isn't that Javier Martinez?\" Walter craned his neck to see. \"Yeah.\" \"Am I the only one who thinks it's a little weird that he's hanging out with some of our best guys?\" Before Walter could answer, Frank shrugged it off and leaned forward again to handle a piece of paperwork. \"Maybe the kid's just eager to learn from them.\" Walter shook his head. \"From what I've heard, I doubt that's it.\" \"Oh?\" Frank looked at Walter in concern. Seeing he was worried, Walter hurried to reassure him. \"No, no, that came out wrong. I doubt that it's that he wants to learn; from what people have been saying, he's doing great at his job. He's got a great work ethic so that I've seen, a good moral compass, and a wonderful attitude about his job and the rules and everything.\" Frank looked at Walter and he could tell that both men got the same idea at the same time. \"Walter,\" Frank leaned back in his chair. \"Why don't you see to it that Mr. Martinez pays us a visit tomorrow?

Truthfully, he probably was. After all, it was probably just a passing thought… one that had stuck around for the past month. And of all of the times for the thought to invade, it had done so now. The August sun was shining brightly in the sky over the Mitchell's yard, yet it was nowhere near as bright as the way David's four-year-old daughter's eyes were glittering as the two of them danced around together in the outdoors. Around the duo, Javier and Nathan were both dancing with their daughters as well, their attention completely on their children. It probably wasn't fair to Olivia that he wasn't paying as much attention to her, but he really couldn't help it. His attention was pretty much taken over by Amanda. As she laughed, his fiancée was dancing with Adam Mitchell near the lawn table, another father-daughter pair of sorts, David supposed. She looked so happy in that moment, so youthful and carefree, that David fell in love with her all over again. And thus that \"passing\" thought reared its head again. It would be so much easier – all of them being forced by their circumstances to live together with the Mitchells – if he and Amanda were already married. This time when the thought came, he allowed himself to dwell on it, to really consider it for the first time. Honestly, why couldn't they just go ahead and take that step? Why couldn't they just move up the date of the wedding and get married already? The sooner the better, so far as he was concerned. All things considered, it would be better for propriety's sake, if nothing else. David grinned to himself; they could get married next week, and that would make him the happiest man in the world. It really was a nearly ridiculous idea, but once it got in his head, it stuck. So, as the song changed from Tim McGraw's \"My Little Girl\" to John Michael Montgomery's \"I Swear,\" Olivia raced off to play and he met Adam and Amanda in the middle of the yard before stepping forward to claim a dance with Amanda, while already thinking about how to tell her about his thoughts concerning their getting married. This is the beginning of a project that I have been thinking about doing for awhile - expanding on my Promises trilogy with more stories of all sizes, from more one-shots like this one to full-blown stories like \"Side By Side.\" It would be great if you guys would tell me what you thought of the idea.

The arrest wasn't really the eye-opener, believe it or not, but what had happened a mere hour beforehand. With all of the self-aware swagger of a boy who thought he knew everything and was too cool for it all, Derrick had planted himself across from her at a cafeteria table and offered her a gift - a faux gold bracelet that had glittered under the harsh school lighting. In truth - for a minute, anyway - she had wanted to accept that bracelet. It really was pretty, and his smile had seemed so expectant. But she had turned it down, knowing that was what her parents would want, and instead she had shown him the promise ring that her father had recently given her. Maybe it was that she was seeing him through different eyes since making the agreement with father. Maybe the disdain in his eyes would have been noticeable even if the agreement hadn't been made. After all, nothing else had really changed, and that really wasn't the first time that the alarm bells should have been going off - more like the third or fourth, maybe even fifth, time - but it was the first time that she had heard them, and it changed her opinion of him for good. This changing of her opinion had come about because of his reaction to her rejection of his gift, not to mention his reaction to the ring that her father had given her. Once she had made it clear that things were not going to go the way that he had wanted them too, he had turned away, spurned, and muttered, \"Oh well, you're the one missin' out.\" After another minute of nearly terse conversation between the two of them, he had left school; Jade would learn later that he had been skipping school and unintentionally heading to the demise of his freedom that he valued so much. Jade would also learn that the bracelet had been stolen goods, another unmistakable red flag attesting to her peer's poor morals. Suddenly the bracelet - and the boy - that she had wanted so badly to claim as her own would seem repulsive to her. She would realize that she had - in a way - traded that bracelet for her promise ring, and the even greater promise that went with it. She had traded the love of a corrupt boy for the love of a caring father and an even greater Heavenly Father. She would realize that no matter how great a relationship with Derrick had sounded, a relationship with her father and her God would always be even greater, and of a greater importance. Because of Derrick, she would now always remember that she was \"of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.\" I know that the tenses are kind of all over the place in this one, sorry about that. Okay, this is based off of 1 John 4:4 out of the KJV. I hope that you guys enjoyed it! Please R it makes my day!

Nineteen year old Dylan Mitchell instantly complied, slamming the ball of his foot back down onto the floorboard instead of bouncing his leg like he had been doing. Apparently it had annoyed his partner for some reason. Although, there were days when Dylan was certain that his very presence now annoyed the man, since he had been assigned to work with Brad during his rookie year at the department. Even though the older man had become much more tolerant since his salvation in the month before Dylan became a deputy, there were still days that they got on one another's nerves. Dylan knew full well that today was one of those days. He didn't really blame Brad for being aggravated with him either; he was pretty sure that he would be aggravated with him too, if the circumstances had been reversed. Jade's due date had been the day before, but nothing had happened, so he was now officially on edge – he kept checking his cellphone for calls from his wife, and he knew that his nerves had long ago given way to just plain jitteriness. Dylan took a deep breath, admonishing himself, \"You're really over-thinking this, man.\" The shrill ring of his cellphone cut through whatever else he might have said to himself. He checked the caller ID. Kayla Hayes. His eyebrows drew together; his mother-in-law never called him when he was at work… unless… His imagination ran into overdrive as he answered his phone. \"Hi, Kayla.\" \"Dylan, you'd better get over to Phoebe Putney here pretty quick. Jade is officially in labor.\" The already rising amount of adrenaline in the young father's body skyrocketed as he asked, \"You're sure?' \"Absolutely positive. She didn't want me to call until her water broke, and I'm calling now, aren't I?\" Note to self: Kayla was stressed out as well right now. \"Alright, we're only about ten minutes away right now going the speed limit, so we'll be there in under seven.\" \"Fine,\" Kayla agreed, and then she paused. \"But let Brad drive, not you, and tell him to go carefully; we need you in here for Jade, not a broken neck.\" \"I know; we'll be careful. Talk to you soon.\" He ended the call and turned to Brad, his tone more fierce than the other man's had been only a minute ago as he ordered, \"Brad, we're going to Phoebe Putney. Now.\" Startled by his tone, Brad made the necessary U-turn and obeyed. He glanced at Dylan, asking, \"She having the baby?\" \"Yep.\" Dylan tensely stared straight ahead until Brad flipped on the lights and sped up, ordering, \"Contact the sheriff, tell him we're taking the day off, then you'd better call Hayes and Mitchell; they'll wanna be there too.\" Dylan turned slowly to look at the man at the wheel. This was not normal behavior for him. Out of the corner of his eye, Brad noticed Dylan staring and asked, \"What?\" \"Nothing,\" Dylan said, shaking his head and dialing his dad's number. \"Just… thanks.\" \"I've got three kids; I get it. Now call.\" Dylan felt something akin to genuine friendship for this man start swelling as he put the phone up to his ear. Dylan literally ran into the hospital. Nathan and David were a step behind him, his father was behind them, and Bobby Shaw and Brad were in the back of the pack. A nurse, whose nametag read \"Robyn,\" saw them and a smile tilted the corners of her lips upward. \"Are you looking for the delivery room by any chance?\" she asked. Dylan nodded quickly. \"Yes, ma'am.\" \"Alright, well, Dad will go that way and all your friends will go to the waiting room down this next hall.\" Dylan shot off in the direction that Robyn had indicated, one word that she had said sticking in his mind. Dad. This was it; within the day his daughter was going to be in his arms. \"Look who's here…\" a white-haired nurse that they had all seen before, Anna, came into the hospital room pushing a clear, plastic, hospital cradle in front of her. All of the people who were standing between the doorway and the hospital bed where Dylan and Jade sat slowly shuffled aside so that Anna could make her way to the new parents with their tiny daughter. Cries of \"awe; she's so cute!\" (from Isabel) and \"poor girl got her dad's nose\" (from Bobby) followed her as her crib was stopped in front of Dylan and Jade. When Dylan caught sight of her, she stole his breath away. Sure, he had gotten a quick glimpse before the nurses had whisked her away to clean her up, but now that she was clean, she looked like the sort of baby that people always wanted to take a million pictures of. Or at least grandmas did. And parents; definitely parents. \"So, who gets to hold her first?\" Anna asked, looking between him and Jade. Jade nodded in his direction. \"He can.\" \"Well, alright then.\" Anna took a step back from the cradle, saying, \"I've heard that you two know what you're doing, so I'll leave you to it for a little while, then come back later to talk to you. Okay?\" Jade nodded and the nurse stepped back out. Terror froze Dylan's ability to move. \"Go ahead,\" Jade prompted him again, nodding towards the plastic cradle with a tired smile. Dylan swallowed the lump of fear in his throat as he looked at the infant girl lying in front of him. She opened her mouth, plump lips forming a silent \"O.\" So tiny. So pretty. So perfect. So much a part of him. So terrifying. So very, very loved by him. He scooped her up carefully, astounded by how well she fit into nothing more than his hands, she was that small. He felt himself smile at his daughter. His daughter. \"Geez, Dylan,\" he muttered to himself under his breath. \"You're a dad now. You have a daughter. Wow…\" It hit him anew as he looked at her. He was a dad . \"Yeah,\" he started talking – quiet and cheerful – to the angel in his arms, forgetting the others crowding the room. \"And you know what? That's all your fault, Miss Emma.\" Victoria, who was standing next to him and looking over his shoulder, asked, \"What did you call her?\" \"Emma.\" Dylan answered, turning to his mom. \"Emma Joy Mitchell.\" Neither one missed the tears in the eyes of the other, but both of them smiled. Victoria winked at him, showing him that his and Jade's choice of a name really was okay with her as she said, \"Good pick, Daddy.\" Dylan sank slowly onto the edge of the hospital bed beside Jade. \"Are you okay over there?\" Amanda spoke up from across the room. He nodded, positioning himself so that Jade could see Emma too. \"Sure am.\" Amanda smiled and cocked her head to the side, looking at the trio that they made. Seeing her melancholy expression, Dylan would've bet a week's worth of pay on the fact that she was thinking of her own, much more unhappy, experiences as a teenage parent. With that thought in mind, he didn't know if he should do it or not, but he did it anyway. He leaned towards his wife and kissed her, declaring, \"I love you, Mrs. Mitchell; you know it?\" \"I do know it,\" she answered with a loving smile. He wrapped an arm around her shoulders and squeezed, loving his girl – girl s now – and how right it felt to hold them both. \"And I love you too, Emma,\" he told his new little princess with a smile. Princess Emma smiled back at him as his heart swelled with the unexplainable love that only a father could understand. Yes, the idea of raising a baby of his own scared him, but he loved her too much to care. This is the last of the \"Through the Flames\" series - I'm afraid that I decided not to add any more to the series lest it detract from the main storyline.

Amanda reached for the handle of the passenger door, but David beat her to it and extended a hand. She smiled, a little tentatively, then took him by his fingertips as she hopped into the truck. With a relieved upward turn of his lips, he shut her door and walked around to his. At least she acknowledged his helping hand this time, unlike the past… dozen? two dozen times? \"Sorry to have kept you out later than planned,\" he said. Again. \"Should have kept an eye on the time.\" \"That's why they call it a watch.\" David let out a small chuckle before it would be too awkward to attempt it. Judging by the half-smile on her face, he figured it was an appropriate move after all. He started the engine and pulled out of the parking lot. It wasn't until he'd turned onto the street that the silence broke. \"I know I've told you before, but I wanna thank you for letting me do this.\" \"What, taking me out or taking me home?\" He studied her expression, but she betrayed neither levity nor gravity. \"Uh… both, I suppose?\" \"Sure.\" \"So… when would you want to do this again?\" She turned to look at him, brows raised ever-so-slightly. As if to say, \"You expect a 'next time'?\" It looked playful enough, but…. \"I'll even take you home an hour early to make up for tonight.\" \"And show up an extra fifteen minutes early and in something other than your uniform?\" \"Hey, I tried to come as quick as I could. A rookie needed help and I had to –\" She backhanded his arm. Lightly. Playfully. \"I know, David.\" He grinned at her dancing eyes and subconsciously noted that they were soft chocolate-brown. \"Besides, Olivia seems to think I look pretty good in uniform.\" \"Maybe because you –\" She bit her tongue. Literally. \"Maybe 'cause you've got that shiny badge.\" He was pretty sure he knew what she was going to say the first time, but laughed past it with a protesting \"What?\". \"Anyway,\" she continued with a wagging finger, \"if you want these trust-building talks to really take effect, you'd better stick to the schedules you set.\" \"Fine, how about this: you and Olivia come over sometime. I'll grill up a couple steaks and we'll both know when it ends because we'll both be fully aware of her bedtime.\" One glance at her face led him to rush on, \"I mean, only if you're comfortable with it.\" \"I don't exactly cuddle with my steaks, David.\" David smiled in spite of himself. \"Well, I can make a pretty mean angel's food. Angels are apparently attracted to the stuff.\" Amanda raised her brows with something that looked like pleasant surprise and… whatever-you-call-the-expression-that-let-you-know -you-overstepped-your-bounds. \"And what exactly are you implying?\" David could have slapped himself for letting that comment slip out, but unless she displayed a truly adverse reaction, he wasn't going to feel sorry for it. Certainly not enough to keep a straight face long enough to say, \"Nothing.\" She smiled back – a beautiful smile, even if it was shrouded by suspicion –, shook her head, and watched the streets of Albany fly past her window. They drove on in silence for a few blocks before she spoke. \"One question. Why do you want to have us over? As opposed to anywhere else?\" \"It's been a while since I've been visited by angels.\" \"David!\" He quailed. \"Okay, okay. I was thinking that we've been doing this in cafés and such for a long while and was hoping that Olivia… you know, with me being her….\" He cleared his throat and started again, but the tremor didn't quite go away. \"I was hoping that maybe you and I could make it… I guess, a little more normal? For her, I mean.\" \"'Normal', huh?\" she mused. His eyes darted between her face and the road. And frankly, the road was easier to interpret. He knew his fingertips were drumming on the steering wheel. They did every time he had no other outlet for his stress, regardless of whether or not he wanted them to. She didn't answer. Whether or not she knew it, the tension was killing him. He wanted to say more. Explain himself. Even share his underlying hopes. But instead, he punched on the radio. The only part of the song he registered was the beat that his fingertips were now naturally tapping to; the rest of his mental capacities were divided between his racing thoughts and attention to the road. Only when he braked for a red light did the rest penetrate his consciousness. Something about a metaphorical cop… being in love? His heart stopped. He shot Amanda a side glance and decided she was too lost in her own thoughts to pay any attention to the music. Or at least he hoped so. Either way, the song was anything but a reflection of his thoughts. The radio belted out vocalized police sirens and Amanda turned from the window to give the offending hardware a quizzical stare. David closed his eyes and felt his ears burn. But the only thing she said was, \"Green light, David.\" His eyes flew open and he stepped on the gas. Definitely too late to shut off the radio now; he'd just have to roll with it. At least they were no more than a minute from her home. But what a torturous minute! She'd looked out her window again and was covering her mouth in… mortification? amusement? Or – this concerned him more than anything – did she suddenly feel physically sick? Whatever her thoughts, he felt her watching him from the corner of her eye. When he pulled up to the curb in front of her place, she barely even waited for him to come to a complete stop before she opened her door and jumped out. He set the truck in park and opened his door to follow – after all, if she was sick, he might be needed. He shot his hand at the radio controls. Vocalized sirens. For the whole neighbourhood to hear. His ears no longer burned: they screamed. Heat flashed through him. Amanda had almost made it to her door, shoulders definitely shaking – and he thought he heard a muffled snort, but with his ears buzzing so, he couldn't be sure of anything. He lost no time in closing his door again and hightailing it home. With the radio off. He'd barely made it home when his cell phone buzzed. \"Hello?\" \"Hey, are you coming back to drive Lisa home?\" Author's Note 2: The referenced song is Owl City's \"I'm Coming After You\".

(11:18) Lying on his side in his bed, blanketed by sheets and the inky darkness of midnight, Adam Mitchell glared at the shape on his side table that he knew to be his sleeping pills. Now that a full month had gone by since Emily's passing, he had begun to realize that he was becoming dependant on the sleep aid to get the rest that he needed. So he had decided that tonight he wouldn't use them. As it was, midnight had come and was in the process of going, yet he still couldn't go to sleep. Thoughts of Emily and all that he had lost swirled in his head, keeping him awake. He sighed and sat up, swinging his legs over the side of the bed. If he was going to awake, he might as well do something constructive with the time. He grabbed his Bible from off of the dresser, purposely not seeing the framed photo of his two children that was also on the dresser. As he padded past the bed on his way to the bedroom door, he heard Victoria stirring in her sleep. Adam froze, turning to look at her. She was such a light sleeper, and it had gotten worse since Emily's crash. He hurt as much for her as he did for himself, in some ways more for her than him, because in some ways Emily's death had hit her harder than it had him. He crept over to her side of the bed and placed a gentle kiss on her forehead before stealing out into the living room. He settled into his recliner, flipped the lamp on, and opened his Bible to the book of Job. He might as well read about someone whose life had gone worse than his was. In time, Adam lost himself in the story as he read one chapter after another. And then he stopped, finding a verse that popped out to him. Job 11:18. \"And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.\" He sat back in his seat, thinking. \"Take thy rest in safety\" \"because there is hope.\" He did have hope – he had hope of seeing Emily again. So why was he so busy dwelling on the nine years worth of memories that he had made with her here on earth when he could be looking forward to the eternity that he would one day spend with her? It was a comforting thought that brought a smile to his tired expression. He would have to share the verse and his thoughts about it with Victoria tomorrow. Knowing that he had found the verse that he needed, Adam turned the light back off and closed his Bible. Before he could even get to his feet to go back to bed, he had already fallen asleep right there in the recliner. Another \"Highlights\" drabble. I hope you enjoyed it.

As Shane sped away in the patrol car with Adam towards the hospital where Emily lay in critical condition - quite possibly on death's doorstep - this was the question that Javier asked himself. Right there, while straddling the rooftop skeleton of the Mitchells' half-built shed, Javier did the only thing that he could think to do. He prayed. He prayed for Emily, a child that he had never even met. He prayed that she would survive; that she and her family would come out of this trauma unscathed. Feeling utterly and completely helpless, Javier did the one thing that he knew he could do to help - he sent up desperate, pleading prayers to his God. But sometimes God's answer to a prayer is \"no,\" that He knows better than we do. When this happened in Emily Mitchell's case, Javier's actions didn't change. He changed his prayer to one of healing for his friend and for the man's family as they began the long process of working through their grief. A couple of days after Emily's passing, Javier was slowly walking the streets of Albany, talking to his God in his native tongue. He was confused, struggling with why God had ignored his prayers and the prayers of others and taken an innocent child off of the earth when her life - a life that had brought joy to so many people - was just beginning. Why then, had God chosen to end her life so soon, so suddenly? \" She made so many people happy, LORD. \" Javier declared, pouring his thoughts out in Spanish. \" I know that she herself was bright and happy and innocent. Why did you end someone like her? \" So she could stay that way. The thought came to Javier's mind and stayed there, crystal clear and startlingly calm and simple against his tumultuous emotions. So she could remain happy, innocent, and unmarred by pain. There's no tears in Heaven, remember? Now she can be happy forever without really knowing that there is any other way to be. \" But, God, my friends are in so much pain! Don't You understand that? \" As soon as the words were out of his mouth, more thoughts filled his mind as if they had been placed there by the LORD Himself. You know that Matthew chapter ten says that I know when every sparrow falls and even the number of hairs that are on every head. Of course I see their pain; I may have even been counting their tears. Just as you are father, I am a Father. I am their Father, and I do care for them all very much. You may grieve for them and with them as their friend, but I grieve for their pain as their Father. My grief is very much the same as Adam's. As for understanding their pain over the death of their child, don't you remember that My own - My only - Child died as well? Don't you know that I watched as My Only-Begotten Son came down from Heaven to Earth, lived a perfect life for thirty-three years, was crucified for the human race that despised Him, and rose from the dead three days later so \"that the world through Him might be saved\"? Yes, I do understand the pain and grief that they're going through right now - more than you do - but you must remember that I have a plan, a purpose in all of this. Just wait and watch; this is all in my plan for the Mitchell family. Believe Me, things will get better. Javier smiled softly, because he did believe it. Days went by, weeks, then months. He kept watching, waiting, and - above all - praying for the Mitchells. As he did so, he saw that, little by little, things did, in fact, get better for his friends. The three remaining Mitchells started sleeping again, eating, functioning, and finally, healing. They began to go entire days without crying for Emily, and then weeks. They began to truly live again. And then came the day when Adam lowered his water bottle onto the table, looked at the four men gathered around his patio table with him, said \"Alright, let me tell you why I had you all come out here today,\" and started passing out pieces of paper that had the word \"RESOLUTION\" printed across the top. Alright, I really wasn't sure if I was even going to write this one-shot, because its content feels very personal right now, but I wrote it as much for \"my friend\" as for myself, and I hope that he can get something out of it, too. As always, reviews are still appreciated. Thanks!:) ","Summary":" What could he do?

She has a slim and attractive body. Flawless skin. She stands at five feet and seven inches. Biography: Anna was always an outcast. She either had no friends or one. And what she means by friend is saying \"Hello\" when you see eachother in the hall. He grades where extremely low, and she had been beaten up a few times...On her own faults. She messed with the wrong people. For a statement she dyed her hair black and put purple, blue and yellow streaks in it. That didn't help any, although it did boost her uniqueness. But her new \"look\" made her more gothic and she was no where near that. Naturally she hand sandy brown hair, and instead of purple eyes she had hazel/green eyes. She never liked to where make-up except for some black, suttle eyliner. Her home life was okay. It could be better. Her father was cheating on her mother with the neighbor and her mom knew it, but was denying it. That was until one day she stood up to her husband. She filed the divorce baught a small \"farm\" and took Anna. Anna began school again, but it was different. Everyone there was nice and respectful. No dumb jocks, preppy cheerleaders. Just normal kids with the same interests as her. Horses.[Chapter 2] Anna Costillo stared blankly out the Ford pick-ups window with a smug expression on her face. The smaky gray farmhouse could be seen a mile up the gravel road, that had a few pot holes in it. Of course this was Anna's dream to live on a farm, but she wasn't going to show it, her mother already had to much pride and snottyness from her daughter, Anna wasn't going to change that. She looked back to her math textbook, she felt like scribbling BLAH! across the pages, but held back. A strand of her black hair fell infront of her eyes, she brushed it away as the truck jerked to a halt. She looked up and saw the three story farm house directly in front of her, to the right a rusty colored brick barn, with at least a five acre pasture behind it. On the inside she was doing backflips as she saw the small herd of horses in the paddock. She tossed her math book into her bag and jumped out of the truck, slamming the door behind her, causing three dogs to run at her. She smiled. She had picked all three out. They barked until they saw who she was and started to whine, not in fright but in happiness. The half wolf husky cross jumped on her causing her to fall back, and she laughed. \"Get off o'me Masque.\" She said pushing at the hundred pound dogs chest as the other dogs started to lick her face. Finally they scampered away and she was able to pull herself off the ground. She brushed herself off then turned back to the truck. Her mother was standing there with her hands on her hips and a victorius smile on her face. \"What?\" Anna said meekly, reaching into the half back and pulling out a bag of clothes then her backpack. \"Oh, nothing.\" Her mom replied still smiling. \"Whatever.\" Anna said giving her mom her best attempt at a weak shrug. As soon as Anna was through the door she ran up the two fights of stairs to the loft/actic that was her room. The walls where a creamy white color with sage carpet floors. Her silver metal double bed was against the far wall, underneath the window facing the barn and paddock. She sighed and dropped her bags onto the floor. She was glad the moving was over. Hearing her mom starting to make dinner in the kitchen, Anna tiptoed down the stairs and out the front door, towards the small dirt track that was to the left of the house. She had no idea how her mom had afforded this farm, but she didn't care. She was happier than she ever had been in her whole life. Their only stable hand was on one of the young thoroughbred. She leaned on the white railing and watched as they came around the 2nd turn, the stable hand slacked his hold on the reigns and the mare took off down the stretch, her muscles rippling under her skin, her nostrils flaring. The man pulled her to a stop and patted her neck, with a large smile plastered on his face. He reigned the horse around and clucked her into a trot towards the gate. Which happened to be right next to Anna. When the horse and rider came near Anna bravely spoke up. \"You two were brilliant! I wish I could ride like that...\" The man smiled more, he must be in his early twenty's. \"Why thank you...But it is truely only Belle here. She's been doing this for along time.\" \"But she's so young. she can't be more then four!\" Anna replied in slight shock, as she swung the gate open for Belle. The man once again smiled. \"You know a thing or two about these beasts don't you?\" Anna new when he refered to the horses as beasts he meant size. \"Only alittle. I've never riden one though.\" She said her tone dropping. The man dismounted and handed Anna the reigns out of no where. \"Do ya want ta ride?\" He asked and foolish smile coming to his thin lips. Anna's jaw dropped. \"Y-You'd teach me?\" She stuttered out. The man nodded. \"Only if you help with the chores,\" He started using his fingers to name off the chores. \"Mucking, sweeping, cleaning euipment, feeding, grooming, and bathing. All starting at six in the morning.\" Anna was torn. She loved sleep, but this was her dream. She stuck out her hand and her grasped it giving it a good shake. \"Im Anna.\" she said. \"Names Andrew. Nice to meet ya.\" He said in that same southern drawl.[Chapter 3] Anna brushed a strand of her sandy brown hair out of her eyes as she dropped the dirty straw into the wheelbarrow at her side. She was almost done the morning chores. This was the last stall and she heard Andrew leading some of the horses towards the barn. She steered the wheelbarrow out of the barn and dumped it in the pile of dirty straw that would be taken away after today. When she got back to the barn three horses where in the barn out of six. Two stalls where always empty. She spread clean straw on the stall floor then leaned against the pitchfork for a moment, wiping her arm across her damp forehead. She yawned and heard Andrew laugh as he put the last of the horses in their stalls. \"A little over worked are we?\" Andrew asked moving closer to her. \"Oh yea. When do I get my first lesson by the way?\" Anna asked excitement present in her voice. \"When do you want them to start?\" Andrew asked smirking at her. \"Do you have time now?\" Anna asked almost jumping up and down. Andrew nodded. \"Yeah. How about you start on Cansei. He is the calmest and most patient. Anna nodded and grabbed Cansei's halter and carefully opened his stall door. Anna slowly entered and Cansei looked at her. He was around fifteen hands high and three inches, he was coal black and had a white blaze running down his face. She slipped the green halter over his head and fastened it leading him into the aisle and clipping him in the middle of it. \"Okay. He's already been brushed so go get the saddle with his name on it, along with the bridle and blanket. Anna nodded and went into the tack room, returning with the saddle pad, saddle and bridle. Andrew showed her how to put each thing on the horse before she led Cansei out to the outdoor arena. She was wearing a cowboy hat, because she was old enough not to wear a helmet and they didn't own any so it was they best. He gave her a leg up and told her to squeeze her thighs against Cansei's sides and say walk. Soon she was doing a posting trot around the arena, with a huge smile on her face. \"Very good Anna!\" Andrew said from the middle of the arena. \"Do you want to try a canter?\" Anna smiled and nodded. \"Yes!\" Andrew came closer and said, \"Okay slide your left foot past the cinch and press lightly and cluck. It'll be a little bumpy at first but, tuck your seat under, and move your hips to his rhythm.\" Anna nodded and did what he said. Cansei immediately switched to a canter, his gate was smooth and Anna found her seat quickly, she tucked her bum under and started moving with him. They did a full circle of the arena before Anna pulled Cansei to a halt. Anna dismounted and led Cansei over to Andrew who was beaming. \"So. How'd I do?\" Anna asked smiling brightly, her legs where a little sore but she didn't care at the moment. \"You're a natural. A few more lessons and you won't need me anymore!\" Andrew said, giving her shoulder a friendly squeeze. \"Thank you!\" Anna said. \"Im going to go groom and feed him. I'll see you around.\" Anna skipped merrily off to the stable, unaware of Andrew's hungry gaze. Taking in the soft curve of her hips, and her long, lean legs. After throughly grooming Cansei and giving him a bucket of oats Anna headed to the house. She hadn't realized it, but she had been with Andrew and the horses nearly all day. It was already twenty past six in the evening. She had so much fun today. as she sat down at the kitchen table her mother beamed at her. \"What?\" Anna asked. \"I saw you riding. Your Good...Perhaps you want a horse of your own?\" Her mom replied. Anna nearly knocked over her chair when she sprung to her feet. \"Really!?! I can?\" Anna asked all at once. Her mom laughed. \"If you want to pursue this. Yes.\" Anna smiled and hugged her mom tightly. \"That would be wonderful!\" Anna said happily. \"Oh and mom...Can I dye my hair back to my natural color?\" Her mom smiled even more. \"Of course. I have a bottle of that color upstairs.\" Anna rolled over in bed to the sound of her alarm going off, strands of sandy brown hair falling in front of her eyes. She sprung out of bed and slammed her hand down on the off button. She pulled on a red checkered sleeveless button up shirt, and a pair of light wash boot cut jeans and an old pair of sneakers. Quickly putting her hair onto two braids on opposite sides of her head. She took the steps by two and landed on the main level with a quiet thump. Grabbing a piece of bread she shoved it in her mouth and walked towards the barn, only to see an unfamiliar green 1989 Chevrolet parked outside the doors. Slowly she approached it to see her mother talking to the most attractive, blonde teen boy she had ever laid eyes on. making her way over to them she eyed him curiously, her gaze sliding over his strong physique. \"Oh. Anna you're here. This is Dean. He's going to be Andrews second man.\" Heather said. Anna smiled warmly at him, and put out her hand, but her eyes where locked on his amazing golden brown eyes that made her melt on the inside. \"Hi.\" She said meekly as he shook her hand slowly. He nodded and smiled at her.

Her mid-back length dirty blond hair swayed innthe breeze as her beautiful green eyes surveyed the vast pasturenbefore her. She clutched her red shall around her body and tiptoednacross the creaky wooden porch. She peered over her shoulder at hernfamily's house, and when she found no sign of movement from inside,nshe ran across the dewy green grass to the barn. She groaned andngrunted as she struggled to push the enormous door open. As thenmorning light spilled into the musky interior of the building,nseveral of the horses stabled inside nickered and whinnied. \"Windynand Chimer, Abel and Dynus, please keep quiet.\" Anneeke tiptoednover the fusty straw in the barn isle and snatched a bridle off anhook on the far wall. A mischievous grin passed over the girl'snfull pink lips as she approached her favourite gelding's stall.n\"Chimer… c'mere my friend.\" Anneke made light kissy noisesnand coaxed the animal towards her. He dropped his large head over thenhalf door and blew warm breath onto Anneke's hair, making the girlngiggle. She offered the big grey horse a handful of oats before shenput the worn leather bridle onto his head. \"Time for some fun\"nshe whispered, tying her long white skirt into a knot at her thighs.nShe carefully led Chimer out the door of the barn, and closed itnbehind them. With one last grunt and deep breath, Anneke sprung ontonthe bulky draft's back, and sighed in content at the feeling of hisnwarm, soft hyde against her bare legs. With one last nervous glancenat her house, Anneke nudged her mount into a relaxed canter, andnsteered him far from her family's land. Chimernand Anneke walked along their usual route, which took themnapproximately seven miles from Anneke's farm, and past the \"firenhills\" as the sixteen year old took to calling them. They werenexposed to the sun for long hours a day, and all the vegetation andngrass growing in that area was dead and dried out. Anneke'snfavourite part of her daily ride was over the crest of the hill. Drynchunks of dirt and rocks tumbled down the hill under the weight ofnChimer's hooves, and Anneke always felt like she was on annadventure some where else in the world. In the desert perhaps. Thensun had still not awakened, so the air was chilly and drab. Annekenfound out that if one woke up at a particularly early hour, one'snbreath was visible in the grey air. Chimer began his descent down thencoarse side of the slope, and dropped his neck, as if the carefullyninspect each rock before he trod over it. Anneke grasped severalnstrands of the gelding's coarse black mane, and squinted her eyesnshut, hoping that Chimer would mind his lumbering hooves and arrivenat the bottom of the hill safely. The horse grunted stumbled,nprovoking a squeak from Anneke. The horse snorted as if in dismay andntrotted daintily down the rest of the way. \"Chimer!\" HissednAnneke, grasping the animal's sides with her bare legs. The horsenslowed to a walk, and ambled across the field, stopping every fewnstrides to snatch up a mouthful of long yellow grass. Anneke didn'tnmind the frequent breaks, she was far too busy looking up at the sky,nwhere the morning mist was beginning to burn off as the sun peakednover the fields. She closed her eyes in content, and savoured thenvery sound of Chimer's steady breathing and the twitter or birds.nWhen the duo was well half way across the field, a coyote spooked atnChimer's immense presence, and bounded away. The horse, notnexpecting the sudden movement, squealed and picked up a frighteningngallop. Anneke screamed and held onto the leather of the reins withnall her might. \"WHOA, CHIMER! WHOA!\" Anneke's voice rose to anshrill plead, but the horse continued its mad dash through the tallngrass, swerving at nothing and throwing a few bucks here and there.nAnneke bent low over the horses' withers, and squinted her eyesnshut, hoping the wild ride would be done soon. When Chimer finallynreturned to a graceful canter, Anneke opened her eyes, her handsnshaking in fright. \"Whoa.\" Anneke spoke softly to the gelding,nand sighed shakily when he returned to a walk. The girl took severalnmoments to regain her confidence before she realised that she did notnrecognise the field any longer. Rose hemp bushes and wild flowersnflourished in the bright green grass, and the mountains seemed to bena lot closer. \"Oh, Chimer…we're in trouble now…\" Anneke wasnabout to turn her horse around and head back to the farm before hernparents awoke, when something else caught her eye. Chimer wasninterested too; he had his ears pricked in the direction of a thicketnof bushed and coarse branches. \"Just don't get scared\" shenmumbled, allowing the horse to sniff his way to the bushed. As theynapproached, Anneke noticed a huge hill leading downwards to andifferent field, one much unlike the ones Anneke was used to seeing.nThis one was rich and green, and many brown specks were visible fromnAnneke's perch from above. She realised, with a gasp that severalnhorses were grazing below. Chimer must have noticed too, because henlet out an ear piercing whinny. \"OW! Chimer!\" Anneke slapped hernhands to her ears, but not before she heard the answering whinny fromnbelow. \"Nice going, Chimer\" she grumbled, as the line of horsesncame running towards them. It was then Anneke realised with a gasp,nthat those horses did not belong to any body…they were wild.[Chapter 2] WhennAnneke stumbled back into the house at dawn, her parents were alreadynawake and milling around the house. The girl's breath caught, andnfear gripped her throat. If her parents knew she was riding withoutnpermission… \"Anneke!nI was wondering when you were going to get inside! How long have younbeen out there for?\" \"Uhh,nsorry Mummy, I'll wash up right away.\" \"Pleasendo, we have a man who's interested in renting that room over.\" \"Oh,nalright.\" Anneke bolted up the stairs to her room, where shenslammed the door shut behind her. The familiarity of the room helpednAnneke to calm down as she dressed in a light red corseted top andnwhite cotton skirt. She picked strands of hay out of her silky blondnhair, then spritzed on a tad bit of lilac and rose scented perfume.nShe was pleased with her appearance after five minutes. \"Comingndown!\" She called, forcing herself to walk quietly and daintilyndown the stairs. When she turned into the living room, her mothernseated her at the couch, across from an attractive man with sandyncoloured hair. He wore a cowboy hat and jeans. Anneke found herselfnenticed, and he seemed equally interested in her too. \"Anneke,nthis is Mr. Frank Hopkins, Mr. Hopkins, this is our daughter,nAnneke.\" \"Hello,nAnneke.\" Mr. Hopkins' voice was coarse and soft, and it gavenAnneke the chills. \"Hullo\"nHopkins did not smile, his green eyes continued to search Anneke'snface. \"Wouldnyou look at that sky, Chimer… pure beauty.\" Anneke strokednChimer's big grey nose and inhaled the scent of horse and hay andnsummer grass. \"And I met our new border today. He's called Frank.nFrank is a strong name, right Chimer?\" Chimer nickered his reply.n\"I thought so. How old would you say he is? He's most defiantly not sixteennor eighteen either…maybe thirty?\" Anneke rambled on, the memorynof Frank's gorgeous green eyes fuelling her thoughts. \"And hisneyes Chimer…they're the color of the mountain brook! His chin isnso chiselled…it's amazing! He's amazing!\" \"Ifnyou continue gushing like that, you'll surly make your horse sick.\"nAnneke froze. That voice…that soft yet coarse voice…Frank'snvoice! \"OHnMY!\" Anneke sprung to her feet, and brushed strands of hay off ofnher dress. \"You weren't listening for long, were you?\" Annekenflushed red in pure embarrassment. \"MaybenI was… maybe I wasn't…\" Frank winked at Anneke and strokednChimer's neck. \"Nice boy you got here. Chimer, right?\" \"Well,nin Dutch he's called Klokkengelui, but Daddy encourages me to callnhim in his English name.\" \"Sonyou're Dutch then?\" Frank's eyes studied Anneke with interest. \"Mhm.\"nAnneke nodded. \"That'snneat.\" \"Notnreally. I like it in America much more. Holland wasn't verynspecial. Too crowded. Out here I have my space, which I like.\" \"Donyou ride, Anneke?\" \"Err…\"nAnneke hesitated. She wondered if Frank would tell her mother andnfather about her morning escapes. \"Youndo…\" \"Well….I'mnnot supposed to…\" Frank's eyes twinkled, and Anneke felt pridenblossom in her chest like a mountain rose. \"Inride too.\" \"Where'snyour horse?\" Frank remained silent, and Anneke instantly felt bad.n\"I'm sorry…\" \"It'snfine. I'm not exactly sure where he is.\" \"Henwas stolen?\" \"Naw.\" \"He'sndead?\" \"Nope.\" \"Younsold him?\" \"Notnexactly.\" Anneke began feeling frustrated. \"Nevernmind\" she mumbled. \"Wouldnyou take me on one of your rides?\" \"Yeah,nsure! How's tomorrow morning sound?\" \"Soundsngood.\" \"Meetnme in the barn at 3:00am. Sharp.\" \"Soundsnlike a plan.\"[Chapter 3] Annekenwas frightened as she entered the barn. Frank was already there,nlooking wide awake. \"Hullo\"nWhispered Anneke, a little tingling feeling starting in-between hernlegs. \"Hi.\"nFrank had Chimer bridled. \"I put the bridle on this boy. Is therenany one else I can ride?\" \"Err…nDynus is a work horse, not broke to ride… and Windy is not but anbaby. Abbey isn't what you'd call the ideal mount…\" \"Whynis that?\" \"She'sncrazy.\" \"I'llnride Abbey.\" \"Ok.\"nAnneke mentally slapped herself. She was so focused on how gorgeousnFrank was that she didn't even think about who he'd ride. \"Ifnyou insist. Do you want to use a saddle?\" \"Naw.\" \"Hernbridle is the small brown one with the black piping.\" Frank wasnfast. He had the little bay mare bridled before Anneke could climbnonto Chimer's back. \"You're fast\" she commented, the tinglynfeeling returning as Frank hoisted himself onto the mare's back. \"I'venbeen doing timed events for years.\" He smiled, which made Annekenmelt. \"Ok,ner, this way.\" Anneke led the way out of the barn and away from thenranch. Frank was good at keeping the antsy and spirited Abbey underncontrol. Anneke admired his smooth skill, and wished she didn'tnhave to tie her skirt at her thighs and ride whenever she pleased, sonshe too could be as good a rider as Frank. When they reached the firenhills, Anneke stopped and turned to look at Frank, who was whistlingnto himself and ignoring Abbey's attempts at rears and bucks. \"Howndo you stay so calm?\" She asked when Abbey succeeded in throwing angood buck. \"Injust do.\" Frank shrugged and smiled adorably at Anneke. \"You'rena very pretty girl.\" Anneke blushed. \"Inam not a girl, I am a woman.\" She tucked some loose strands of hairnbehind her ears. \"Inapologize.\" Frank bowed his head, then studied Anneke again. \"Hownold do you and Chimer think I am?\" \"OH!\"nAnneke giggled in surprise. \"Maybe thirty?\" \"Closenenough.\" Frank smiled weakly, then turned Abbey in a sharp circlenwhen she bucked again. Anneke flushed pink in happiness. She likednFrank… a lot. \"Sonwhere about are we headed to?\" \"Tonthe end of the field?\" Anneke pointed to the bushed bordering thenfield. \"Soundsngood.\" Frank laughed as Abbey picked up a canter. He stopped whennhe was beside Anneke. \"I'mntaller then you!\" Cried Anneke in glee. The man's head was equalnwith her shoulder. \"Maybenthat's because the horse I'm riding is 15 hands high, and your'snis 17.\" He grinned, and Anneke rolled her eyes. A bubbly andnmischievous feeling filled Anneke, and she bent down and snatchednFrank's hat off his head. His eyes widened in bewilderment, andnAnneke took off at a gallop, laughing like a maniac, Frank's hat innher dainty hand. Frank didn't miss a beat. He nudged the prancingnAbbey into a gallop, and he was quickly by her side. \"OH NO WAY!\"nAnneke laughed and dodged away from Frank's grab. The chase wentnon, until, a bouquet of pheasants burst from the grass, clucking andnflapping their wings. The sound spooked Chimer, who swerved. Annekenscreamed as she fell of the horse's side, and took Frank down withnher. \"OOF!\"nAnneke and Frank hit the ground with a THUD, and the horses continuednto gallop. 'Arenyou alright?\" Asked Frank, blinking the dust out of his eyes. \"Yeah,nyeah….you?\" Anneke replied shakily, but did not move. Frank wasnunderneath her. \"I'venbeen worse. Where can the horses go?\" \"Nonwhere. They'll stop and graze soon enough.\" Anneke groaned. \"Thatnwas quite the fall.\" Frank stirred from underneath Anneke, makingnher stomach flutter. \"Sorry…\" \"Don'tnbe.\" Frank made no effort to stand up. He just continued to lie innthe grass, Anneke on top of him. \"Inshould move\" she started sitting up, but Frank inhaled sharply, andnone of his hands flew to her waist, but he snapped it away almostninstantly. Anneke was curious. She very sneakily moved her leg overnthe special spot on Frank's pants. What she felt made thentinglyness move to her head and to her toes.[Chapter 4] Hallo, all Hallo, all!nSorry it's taken SO long to update… :P I just watched Hidalgonagain and I am newly inspired! :D (OMG Viggo Mortensen is SOOOngorgeous! Lmao you should see my facebook page, its like: Viggo this,nViggo that XD). Ahem. Enjoy the next chappie! Oh, BTW, I'mna horse person, so you may note some horsie lingo in the story. Inhave provided a little glossary for those of you non horse folk sonyou can understand what I'm saying. Afternthat incident in the grass, Frank never asked if he could join Annekenon a ride. Even two weeks later he never mentioned it. Annekenpretended to not notice, and went along with her business. One sunnynmorning, she awoke to voices downstairs. She yawned hugely and tuckednher bed messy hair out of her face and into a horse tail. She changedninto a presentable outfit and scurried downstairs, curious about thennew voice. Although, when she turned into the sitting room, and sawnFrank sitting beside a gorgeous woman, she wanted to turn right backnaround and go upstairs and pretend nothing happened. Maybe the womannwould even vanish. SNAPnOUT OF IT, ANNEKE! Shenthought to herself. Fornall you know, that's his sister. Now smarten up and be polite. Annekenswallowed the rising lump in her throat and smiled sweetly at hernparents. \"Hullo,ndear! I'd like you to meet Rukah, Mr. Hopkins' mistress.\"nAnneke's mother smiled sweetly. \"She's a real sweetheart, andnquite the rider too! You two will surly get along!\" \"M-mistress?\"nAnneke felt aversion bite at her throat and tears prickle the back ofnher eyes. She knew several other synonyms for mistress. \"What'snwrong dear? Looks as if you've just been kicked!\" \"I'mnfine, mummy.\" Anneke gulped and entered the sitting room. \"G'mornin'nmiss.\" Frank smiled and tipped his hat. \"Morning\"nshe mumbled. \"Anneke,nI'd like you to meet Rukah.\" Frank put a hand on the slendernwoman's shoulder. Rukah smiled enticingly. \"Goodnmorning Miss! Pleased to meet you.\" Rukah extended a delicate hand,nwhich Anneke shook with biting resentment. Rukah's eyes were anstellar amethyst color. Her hair was coffee brown and cut short andnfine, the longest strands dangling past her chin and jaw line. Hernskin was fair and slightly sunburnt. What puzzled Anneke most aboutnthe lady before her was her outfit. She wore worn jeans that werenfaded to a bluish tint, and bulky chocolate brown leggings that camento her knees. She had equally tattered cowboy boots the same color asnFrank's. Her shirt looked like a black corset with a white cottonnmen's shirt underneath. She had many bracelets and leather strapsnlatched to her thin wrists, and she even had a cowboy hat. Anneke wasnfull out shocked with this lady. So shocked in fact, that her mouthnhung open. Shendresses like a pirate! Shenthought. \"Pleasednto meet you too\" stuttered Anneke, her eyes searching up and downnRukah's body. From her long legs to her under average bust, to hernfeminine face. This seemed to make Rukah uncomfortable, because thenlady frowned slightly and shifted in discomfort. Servesnyou right thoughtnAnneke angrily. Dressingnlike a man earns you stares! And guess what lady? I have a biggernchest then you! HA! Annekenwas purely disgusted with herself, for behaving and thinking so low,nbut she knew deep down that she was just bitterly jealous of Rukah. \"Erm,nAnneke, I was wondering if you'd like to go riding with me today,nso we could get to know each other a bit better. I've alreadynspoken with your parents, and they think it's a lovely idea.\"nRukah smiled a pretty smile. \"Oh\"nAnneke was caught off guard. \"Um, I don't think we have enoughnhorses-\" \"That'sncovered too. Frank and I brought our horses here early this morning.\" \"Newnhorses?\" Anneke felt excited all of a sudden. \"That'snright. So whaddaya say?\" Rukah cocked her head to the side. \"Um,nOk, sounds good.\" Anneke nodded. \"When do we leave?\" \"Whenevernyou're ready.\" \"Ok,nI'm ready to leave now.\" Anneke felt happy that she'd have anchance to show Rukah that she was a great rider. But then somethingnthat felt like an electric shock prickled her stomach. \"Is Frankncoming?\" \"That'sna good question. Gee Frank, are ya commin'?\" Rukah put the tip ofnher tongue between her teeth when she grinned at Frank. The mannstudied Rukah with an expression that made Anneke's heart melt. Itnwas such a tender loving gaze, but a lingering undertone of desirenwas detectable as well. \"Inthink I'll give the two of you a chance to get to know each other.\"nHe winked at Anneke. \"Ok,nsuit yourself.\" Rukah snatched the cowboy hat off of Frank's headn(which made him yelp then grumble then grin cheekily) then put it onnher own. She ruffled Frank's hair then motioned for Anneke to standnup. Anneke got to her feet, and mentally grinned; she was taller thennRukah by a good 2 inches. \"Alrighty, missy, let's hit the dustyntrail.\" Anneke felt jealously once again, but tried to push itnaside. She followed Rukah out to the barn. Anneke rushed to open thenbarn door first and smiled in satisfaction. Although, when shenentered the barn, her jaw dropped when she saw the two new heads thatnhung over the half doors. \"OMIGOD!\"nshe cried, rushing over to the head of a beautiful buckskin. \"That'snFrank's horse. His name is Firefly. We just call him Fly.\" Rukahnruffled the animal's jet black forelock. \"And this is Roux, he'snmy baby.\" Rukah tilted her head in the direction of a stunningnappaloosa stallion. His coat was a glistening copper color, but hisnrump was snow white with lots of chocolate brown spots. His mane andntail were blond, and his nose pink. \"He'sngorgeous!\" Cried Anneke, her eyes popping at the sight of the 16hhnstud. \"Aintnhe.\" Rukah kissed his nose. \"Hownold?\" \"Ten.nI've had him since he was just a little baby.\" \"Wow…nis he a good ride?\" Rukah tilted her head back and laughed at hernquestion, making Anneke frown angrily. She hated being ridiculed. \"Henonly lets me ride him. Enough said?\" Anneke really wasn'tncatching on, but she nodded. She really didn't want to appear dumbnor unintelligent in front of Rukah. \"Sonum, yeah, this is my, er, my favourite horse, Chimer.\" Annekenstroked her gelding's nose. \"HellonMr.! Boy aren't you cute?\" Rukah scratched the horse's forelocknand the animal sighed in content. \"Ok,num, I'm going to ride bareback then.\" \"Oh,nI might as well too then.\" Rukah turned away from the chocolatenbrown western saddle dropped outside of Roux's stall and put thenmatching bridle over her shoulder. \"Ohnno, you don't have to-\" \"It'snalright; I want us to be even.\" She winked and slid the bridle overnRoux's elegant head. \"Sonis Roux pure appy?\" Anneke bridled Chimer and led him outside. \"Naw.nAppy, Arab, Mustang n' thoroughbred. But mostly appy.\" Rukahngrinned as she mounted the huge animal. \"Wow…he'sna real mix. You may as well call him a mustang.\" Anneke made a bitnof a face. All her horses were pure, or at least had a breed name;nnot appynArab mustang and thoroughbred. \"Yeah,nbut isn't he beautiful? I could pass him off as pure appy if itnweren't for his long tail and shit brick house build.\" \"Chimernis Dutch Warmblood\" Anneke proudly pat her horse's muscular neck. \"Ohnyeah, I see that. Do you ever jump him?\" \"What?nJump a horse? Are you mad ?\"nAnneke's voice rose to a shrill level. Rukah made a face. \"I'mnsane.\" She nudged Roux into a working trot and posted with hisnsturdy strides. Anneke gulped. She couldn't post. \"Inthought you rode western.\" \"Ofncourse!\" Rukah sat through a buck. \"Thennwhy are you posting?\" \"Cuznit's smoother.\" Rukah asked her mount for a canter, and henwillingly upped his pace to an upbeat and rhythmic canter. \"Are youncoming?\" Asked Rukah, looking over her shoulder. \"Yeah.nHey, wait; you're headed straight for the FENCE!\" Anneke's eyesnpopped in horror as Roux cantered straight for the wooden fence. \"InKNOW!\" She laughed as her horse soared through the air, and clearednthe fence by a good 2 feet. \"OMIGOD!\"nAnneke cantered towards the gate and swung it open. \"Are you OK?\" \"Ofncourse.\" Rukah patted her horse's neck. \"Why wouldn't I be?\" \"Becausenyou just CLEARED my FENCE!\" Anneke gawked at the lady. \"Intold you about jumping. Leaping is what it's called in England.\"nAnneke was interested now. \"Do you want to try?\" \"Well,nI'd love to, but I don't think I can clear a fence like that.\" \"We'llnstart small.\" Rukah smiled and pointed ahead of herself. \"We'llnfind a place to practice on some logs.\" X X X Annekensat on her bed, and looked out of the window. The moonlight shonenthrough the panes and decorated Anneke's floor with interestingnpatterns. For the first time in years, she felt like an insignificantnchild. Rukah was so nice and so sweet, she seemed like the kind ofngirl Frank would go for in a heartbeat, but Anneke couldn't helpnbut feel jealousy. She liked Frank, truly, and she thought that henmay have had feelings for her too, but when Rukah came along, thingsnchanged. On their ride, Anneke had asked Rukah how long she'd beennwith Frank. The answer was a glorious five years. Frank was in hisnthirties, Rukah in her twenties. Anneke, little Anneke, was in hernteens. Tears slipped down her cheeks and plopped onto her bed. Inneed to go for a walk shenthought to herself, climbing out of bed. She wore her nightdress,nwhich was embarrassingly too small and displayed quite a bit of hernthighs. It hung 7 inches from her waist, just barely covering what itnwas supposed to. Anneke thought nothing of it, as she was just goingnto see the horses. Annekenpadded through the dark house and slipped onto the front porch. Thenworn wood caressed her feet with their rough and uneven touch. WhennAnneke arrived at the barn, she noticed the door was slightly ajar. \"Hullo\"nShe cooed softly, fear making itself comfortable in her chest. \"Anneke?\"nThe girl sighed in relief at the sound of Frank's voice. \"Goodness,nyou frightened me.\" \"Whatnare you doing out so late?\" Frank emerged from the darkness of thenbarn, and blinked his dreamy green eyes at the moonlight. Anneke feltnher throat constrict. \"Incouldn't sleep. I needed to see Chimer.\" She tried to ignore hownbeautiful Frank looked in the moonlight. \"We'renin the same boat then partner.\" He smiled lopsidedly and nudged hisnhead in the direction of the barn. \"Coming in?\" He asked. \"Yeah.\"nAnneke followed him into the darkness. The interior of the barn wasnso black; Anneke couldn't see her own hand held in front of hernface. \"Frank\" she whispered. \"Yeah?\" \"Inthink I'm lost.\" She giggled when Frank clasped her hand. \"Wherendo you want to go?\" \"Anywhere.\" \"Wellnthat doesn't help much.\" Frank chuckled but tripped overnsomething. He fell to the ground and grumbled under his breath whennAnneke tumbled down beside him. \"Inhave no idea where we are\" she laughed, still clinging to Frank'snhand. \"Menneither.\" He sighed and stood up, Anneke not far behind. They stoodnin the darkness, listening to the rhythmic breathing of the horses.nAnneke felt butterflies swarm her stomach; Frank's face was not butna hand's breadth away from her own. She closed her eyes as hernbreathing grew quicker. She turned her face towards Frank's just asnhe was turning in her direction. Their noses whacked together andntheir lips brushed. \"God Anneke\" he muttered. Anneke plucked upnher courage and without much thought, grabbed Frank's shoulders andnkissed his lips. He didn't move when she pulled away, and Annekenthought she'd die of a heart attack. Her heart was thumping so hardnand so fast against her chest she wouldn't be surprised if it werento burst out and hit the wall. \"Anneke\" he said, his voice calmnand collected. \"Yes\"nshe squeaked. \"Pleasendon't.\" His voice was a sigh. Anneke felt her stomach twist in anknot then fall. \"Why?\"nShe asked automatically. She clapped her hand to her mouth, andnmentally scolded herself for asking questions without the approval ofnsanity. \"Why?nAnneke, I am with the woman I love. You are a pretty girl, but younare sixteen years old. You are a real nice kid, honestly, I like youna lot, but can't you just settle for friendship? We can ridentogether, but please, nothing more.\" Anneke felt tears well in herneyes. \"Butnthat day in the grass\" she croaked. Frank sucked in his breath, andnstopped breathing. Anneke's eyes widened. Whatndid I say? Shenwondered in alarm. \"No.\"nwas all he said. Anneke heard hay rustle as he walked through thendarkness. There was an occasional OOF! Asnhe walked into something, but then all was still. A/N:nOk, guys! What did you think? It's getting kinda \"angsty\" andnI've still got a couple surprises up my sleeve. Remember to leavenreviews!!

XD Horsienlingo that you may have encountered: Buckskin: A horse color. Their body ranged from champagne color to light orangen(like Spirit from the movie \"Spirit\"). Their manes and tails arenblack, and they have black socks, muzzle and ears. Appaloosa: Anhorse breed. They can have either a brown body with a white butt withnpolka dots or a white body with polka dots all over the place. Theyngenerally have really scrawny and short tails but they are stillnbeautiful. (I have an Appaloosa thoroughbred cross and NO his tailnis not scrawny!) Appy: Short for appaloosa. Arab: Shortnfor Arabian. And y'all know what breed that is because you watchednHidalgo. ;) Mustang: Are you joking me? You watched Hidalgo! You MUST know what a mustangnis! 16hh: horses are measured in hands (no that does not mean the span of yournhand). A 16hh horse is tall. 15hh is average. 17hh is HUGE and 14hhnis pony. Stud/Stallion: Un-gelded (AKA un-neutered) male horse. OO Forelock: the bit of mane that drapes over a horse's poll (poll is horsienterm for forehead). The human equivalent would be bangs. Thoroughbred: A horse breed. Ever seen horse racing? Those are thoroughbreds. Theynare a popular breed, but generally have a really wild and spiritedndisposition. DutchnWarmblood: A Warmblood breed (no that does not mean the horse had warmnblood itnmeans that the animal is a cross between a \"hot blooded horse\"nlike an Arabian and a \"cold blooded horse\" so like a draftnhorse). This breed has been perfected for competing in major events,nlike dressage and show jumping. BEAUTIFUL HORSES! :O Posting: When you rise and fall with the horses footfalls. Easier then itnsounds.

He had no idea what to say to this woman that he was going to go meet, and it didn't help that it was vitally important that he not mess this meeting up.

(1:1) Dylan Mitchell had begun to hate science class. After talking with his father a few times about Creation versus evolution, everything that the teacher, Mr. Locke, was telling him in this lesson just seemed so stupid. Yes, evolution was what he heard more, seeing as it was what was taught in the high school, but so what? That didn't mean that it was right. \"Okay,\" Mr. Locke looked to the back of the room towards the clock on the wall. \"We have two more minutes. Are there any quick questions about what you've heard today?\" Dylan found himself raising his hand, which he didn't generally do. Ms. Locke looked as surprised at his action as he was and called on him. \"Yes, Dylan?\" \"Yeah,\" Dylan took a deep breath before asking. \"I know that this lesson was about the evolution of man, but what about intelligent design?\" His teacher's eyebrows rose. \"I'm sorry?\" \"Well,\" he attempted to explain. \"Intelligent design is the belief that an intelligent designer – my belief being that the designer was God – created the world, and I believe that we all came from the perfect mind and plan of a perfect Creator.\" \"Yes,\" Mr. Locke nodded his balding head. \"I know what intelligent design is, but that seems like more a matter of faith then of science, don't you think?\" Dylan paused. He didn't want to pick a fight – that hadn't been his intent – but he wanted to give an honest answer and – like him and his dad had talked about – stand up for his faith. \"I think that Creation and evolution are both matters of faith, after all, I don't have proof that God spoke things into existence, which is what I believe, and you don't have proof that animals and people evolved, like half-monkeys half-people skeletons that should exist somewhere if evolution were a fact, like you believe it is. Right?\" Mr. Locke opened his mouth to answer, but the bell cut off whatever reply he might have given. Saved by the bell , Dylan thought, jumping up out of his desk chair. As he walked out of the classroom, he noticed that a few of his fellow students rolled their eyes at him. That's okay , he decided. At least it won't cost me a medal like it did Eric Liddell. And maybe somebody will decide to read up on what I was talking about. That would be cool if somebody changed their mind about evolution and Creation because of it. He left the classroom with a small smile on his face. Now he would have something to tell his dad when they went running together later in the day.

(2:7) Adam sat stretched out on his bed reading his Bible. As of yesterday, he had decided that he was going to read at least a chapter a day, which meant that today he was only on Genesis chapter two, but, hey, at least he was on track so far. He read the verses, pausing for a second after he got through reading verse six. How different the world must have been back then before the fall of man and the Flood! And when he read verse seven, it too gave him pause. \" Man became a living soul .\" … It was something to think about, that phrase. Every day people died, or more accurately their bodies did. Which meant that every day as those bodies died, their souls entered into the afterlife, be their destination Heaven or Hell, and there those souls stayed for all of eternity. Even Emily , he realized. She too was in the afterlife, in Heaven by her own profession of faith in the LORD Jesus Christ as her Savior. Her body was dead and in the ground, but her soul was very much alive with Jesus. And that meant that one day Adam would see her again. The thought was a comfort to Adam. But then came the thought: What's the point of being able to say 'hello' to her again later if I've never said 'goodbye' and let her go here on earth? He pondered this for another second and then – with his decision made – he got off the bed and grabbed his truck keys and an unopened Mark Harris CD from off of his and Victoria's dresser.

Ever sincenI can remember I loved to run. The faster the better was always mynmotto! My mother Elu often claimed that I was running as soon as Incould walk. Loved the plains where I lived. They were perfect fornrunning! They were flat, the earth was soft, and there were no holesnor ditches. The problem was that mom always called me back if I hadngone too far for her comfort. Sometimes she'd tell me that when I runnI'd either forget the way back to the herd, or just plain forget toncome back. I understood the dangers of being alone at such a youngnage. But I didn't care! I wanted the adventure; I wanted the thrillnof seeing new places. Mynfavorite time to run was on a sunny day yet, a windy day. It wouldnfeel like I was flying like the eagle overhead, free to do, as Inpleased for this was my home! Racing my friend Dakota (or as everyonencalled him Kota) was just as fun! We raced through the woods, overnditches, logs, streams; you name it we raced through it! We neverngalloped. We flew, glided through the wind, with not a single care innthe world! But because I ran more often the Kota I often beat him byna long shot! But we never cared a bit. We were friends and we knewnhow to have a good time! Often mynfather Hidalgo was leading our herd to another part of the open plainnin search for, water, food, or just better grazing grounds. Kota andnI got bored of staying close to the herd. So we often made games ofnour own. Like snaking the fillies off like we were real herdnstallions. Most of them never appreciate it one bit. Mom would scoldnme for snaking the fillies then made me apologize to their mothersnand to the fillies. One filly that I never wanted to talk to for anynreason was Liseli. She and I never got along. She was too boring andntoo \"mature\" to do anything like that! But Luyu (pronouncednLoo You) on the other hand found it fun and entertaining! Luyu wasnlike me in many ways as my mom often said. She had a free spirit andngot bored just as easily as I. I'd often take her for a romp in thenwoods with Kota sometimes. Well if he let me take her. I remembernthe nights when the wild beasts howled their hearts out. My fathernslept on those nights. He remained close to the herd incase onendecided to take out a colt, filly, or just an elderly horse. He wouldnalso walk amongst us and check the mares and see if everything wasnok. He'd pay special attention to the foals, me more than the othernfoals in the herd. If I were scared he'd stand by me and talk to menuntil I fell asleep. One night there was two glowing objects in thenwood headed towards us. My father without missing a beat rose to suchnan occasion legs stomping, teeth clashing and with one powerfulnstrike to the animal, it would be as safe as it would have been justna few moments ago! When I turned three, mynadolescence and inexperience as a stallion got the best of me. Onencolt named Tuari started to follow me almost every where I went.nAlways, constantly asking questions. Such as: Where are you going?nWhat are you doing? Can I come too? What is in the tall wood? Itndrove me crazy. I finally had enough. I kicked him, and whippednaround and nipped him on his hind haunches. Of course he made a bigndeal of it and my dad came to me with his head down, ears pinned,nnostrils flaring and a fiery red glow in is eye that I had never seenbefore. He came to snake me away from the heard. He told me a while anway from the herd that I was not to return. Although he was my dad,nand the authoritative figure in the herd I decided that it was mynturn to get a herd of my own. I turned with my head close to thenground and my tail down never to see my father, mother or Dakota, ornfor that matter Luyu! I had seen many stallions over through othersnin order to gain a herd. So that was my plan. I kept walking fornhours until I had come to a watering hole. I drank, took a few chompsnon the sweet grass and settled down for the night. But nothing keptnme from thinking about my love Luyu. I never knew what she was goingnto do. And I bet it came as a shock to her that day. That night I dreamtnthat either Kota or my father was comforting her. I hoped she wasnsafe and that we would meet again some day. Please R&R;! Inhave several other chapters but I won't post if I do not get anynreviews![Chapter 2] NOTE All of these characters are of my ownncreation. Except for Hidalgo. Hidalgo is not of my own creation. The Stallion Comes Fourth I became tired andnsettled between two tall trees for the night. I was then awakened thennext morning by the sound of dry leaves and twigs crunching andncrackling under the hoof of a strange lone stallion. He looked,nwalked, and smelled like those old stallions that they have been,nstripped of their band by younger, stronger, braver and more athleticnstallions. Like all stallions he did not leave his band without anproper fight. His mane was ratty and tangled, his shoulder raisednfrom his body due to age and weight loss. He walked with stiff legsnand dragged one behind. The smell of rotting flesh and blood wasnpresent and strong. But after the spurt of anger that my own fathernso willingly revealed to me. How was I to know if this stallion wasnfriend or foe? Although he was across the river that lay severalntrees away from me I asked him who he was, and where he was from. Henlooked at me angrily, his eyes a soft red glow, but fading fast. Henonly gave one word: Ezhno, and continued his search for food. I didnnot totally understand what this word meant. (Pronounced Ex know) I took andrink of water, and munched on grass for a wile before striking offnfor the day. I walked for what seemed like many hours. Stopping everynso often for a drink and a bite to eat. It was getting to be late innthe day when I reached the top of a hill and looked over to see whatnherds were where. Right below me was a band of mares they did notnseem to have a lead stallion. I worked my way closer to the band. Anblack fellow stepped towards me. Head raised as high as the necknwould allow ears pinned to the back of the head, and nostrilsnflaring. I stopped dead in my tracks, guessing this horse meantnbusiness! The black reared in a sign of aggression. Then it occurrednto me that this was no overly protective mare but indeed a stallion,nyoung and steadfast to defend his band. I bowed to him andncontinued on my way over the hill in search of a weak stallion or onenthat seems most vulnerable, easy to attack and kill to take commandnover his band. I crossed streams, jumped ditches, avoided gofernholes, and swam rivers but there was no telling just how long I havenbeen away from my home herd. I missed Dakota, and Luyu. I walked forna long while, when the sun was beginning to set, I stopped in a grovenof trees devoured some grass and settled down for the night. I awoke to the distantnsound of hoof beats. I was not sure where this was coming from. Inwaited a while from the shelter of low tree limbs while a figure of anmale horse drew nearer. His eyes were sunken to the back of his headnwith a glassy glow, his tail had been torn and only wisps of hairnremained. His coat was thin, ribs were showing, he walked stiff, andngingerly through the brush, passed me. I could not believe he did notnnotice me. It was time. I reared in display of aggression, nostrilsnflaring, mouth open. He turned his head towards me as my hoof landednon his nose. He let out a loud cry of pain and despair. I strucknrepeatedly over his, thighs, hips; I kicked at his abdomen. I bit atnhis rump, tearing flesh and what muscle remained on his sad carcass.nAs I reared and struck his neck, he fell. Trying hard to regain hisnstability on those twigs for legs he had. I struck him, pinning himnagainst a rock. I reared once more striking the middle of his face.nHe fell to the ground with a hard thump, never to get up. I headed back to hisnband, which is now mine! FINALLY! I have my own band! I drove themnaway from the grazing spot that they just arrived at. Turning them onntheir heels, in confusion they ran in different directions. I begannproudly circling them, snaking them together. I ran them from thenopen, to the shaded area where I had fought their last leader. I letnthem break, eat, drink were the foals can suckle from the mothers fornfood. I began checking my future mates. One mare in particular caughtnmy attention. I went to her to get aquatinted. She pinned her earsnback and flared her nostrils in aggression; I backed off and decidednto let her settle for a while. After all I did just kill her fathernand if there was any way I had to gain her trust and respect I had tonrespect her. Inrose to the top of the nearest ridge and reared in defense andnproudly neighing my claim of the world. As I descended down the hillnto my band of mares I introduced my self again to the mare who hadncast me away before. \"Inknow who you are\" she stated. \"Wellnwho am I?\" I asked. \"Younare the son of the great Hidalgo\" \"Yeahnso\" \"Don'tnyou know the greatness of your lineage?\" \"Apparentlynnot!\" She grunted at me as she walked away. Inhad to know. Here and now. How she knows my father. And how she wasnable to tell whom I was from.[Chapter 3] Indecided to follow this mare so I could learn more of my mysteriousnhistory. When she stopped I snaked her off to a private corner wherenwe could talk in private and where I can keep an eye on my herd. \"Sonwhat do you want to know?\" she stated slyly \"Anynthing and everything!\" \"Ok.nBack let's say 30 years or so ago this man named Frank Hopkins setnout on his own to stake a claim in this land. He left his town ofnSprigfield to join his great uncle in the business of cattlenranching. He had known and wanted a horse for the longest time. Andnwhen he saw your father in a clearing next to his slain mother henapproached him with some water that he so desperately needed. Hendidn't know it then he had just gained him a friend. AsnFrank turned and walked away the foal followed. This foal was yournfather. After years he started to do cross country races and he thennjoined the US Cavalry. In fact he was the one who carried the messagento Wounded Knee creek. He then proceeded to win more and more racesnuntil he was invited to a race in a far away soil. And he won thatntoo surprise, surprise. So Basically your father is THE legendarynracehorse that was never beaten. Oh by the way without him none of usnwould be in existence. I'll save that for later.\" \"Nonkeep going!\" I begged. \"Hecknno. Sorry man, I'm too tired. I'll tell you in the morning if I'mnin the mood.\" She stated bluntly as she turned abruptly and walkednaway. Instood there in awe. Still. MY father? A Champion? He never told menthis. But that would explain why he would disappear for a week orntwo. But not really. SuddenlynI hear this crack behind me. I spin on my haunches to see what isnhappening. And there in front of me is this two-legged creature. Insaw what they did to a mare one year. Tied her up, Shot her and thennmoved many others into a pen… was I going to let this happen to mynherd. HECK NO! Inshot off like a bullet snaking my \"prized mare\" onward. She letnout a horrified whiney as the others blazed on with us. I didn'tnknow what was going to happen. And there was not a darn way I wasngoing to find out. Insaw a steep hill with jagged rocks straight a head. I chose thenclearest path a led my herd up that. It was our only way out. I lednthem to a thick wood and let them rest. I went over to that mare Inwas talking to. \" Innever did get your name\" \"AndnI suppose you want it, huh?\" \"Itnwould be a nice thing to know.\" \"Mynname is Turi.\" \"Nicento meet you Turi, I'm-\" \"Inknow your Nodin\" \"Yea,nListen if you see anything other than a horse RUN, specificallyntoward Wounded Knee creek. I'm going to head off the two legged.\" \"OK.nBut why me?\" \"Younseem to have a good sense of direction and strong leadership skills.\" \"Geenthanks.\" Indid not have time to say your welcome but I know she knew it. Incarefully made it down to the valley below. I stopped and looked upnto the top. There she was looking down at me. Then she turned andnwalked away. I looked around me and started back over my steps. Andnthere was my father and a two legged on his back. I stopped andnstared my father down. Inwas mad at him for sending me away. But more upset that he never toldnme of his history. Suddenly the story what Turi told me came back!nFrank, the rides across country. Thisnman thing was Frank! Well if my father trusted him should I too? Inlooked to the top of the ridge there was Turi. My father just lookednat me and said: \"Leavenher and Follow me…\" \"But,nuh, Da-\" \"NOW!\"nHe bellowed as he took off into the woods. Inheld back, not sure I took one look back and Turi was not there. So Infollowed my father. Through the rough terrain for several hours,nkeeping my distance when we slowed you can never tell what a beingnwill do especially if you are not familiar with it. Suddenly the woodnopened to a clearing with a big box at the end of the field. Inhung back in the middle of the field amongst the tall grass making mynbest attempt to blend in and become unnoticed. Thisntwo-legged put my father into this round, fenced in area. My fathernstayed in there happily munching on the grass in there. The strangenbeing went inside and stayed there. I didn't know what to do. So Indid the only thing I thought of. I ate. I was so hungry I was justnabout ready to jump in the pen with my father! Hoursnlater the guy…(what's his face)… Uhm, anyways… Yeanhe came out with two black things in each hand. He set one downnacross the field opposite the box, and then walked calmly into thenpen with my father. Set one down there and left. I didn't noticenwhere he went. Just the fact that my father had his face in thenbucket and hadn't taken it out for a while before stopping to looknat me. So,nI made my way over to the bucket.[Chapter 4] Please note all of these charactersnin this story with the exemption of the legendary Hidalgo are of mynown creation! For a list of names and meanings pleas refer to mynprofile But as I started tonmove towards the bucket, I felt a strange wave over take me. Thisnwave of emotion was foreign to me. I stopped and looked around andnbehind me, expecting a two-legged to come from behind and donsomething to me. I decided my band needed me more, I spun on mynhaunches and high-tailed it out of there and back to my band. As Indid I heard my father scream to me, but what he said will remain anmystery to me. The wind and the leaves made hearing him impossible. When I reached a safendistance away from the two-legged's dwelling I stopped to take anlong drink and had a bit to eat. I had no idea for how long I rannbut, I could see a large group of horses in the distance. They werennot mine, well from what I could tell. I decided to have a closernlook. As I got closer to them I could see that they were horses I didnnot know. But wait! I scanned the heard of horses, and as I did therenwas a particular horse that seemed to stand out from all the rest. A mane of a glowingnwhite and red sections, the coat of a shiny pink, yet almost a rednroan in sections intermixed between bright flashy intense whitenpatches that seem to have been freshly washed. Her tail was as whitenas the clouds on a partly sunny day, thick and full as if it wasnbraided from exactly that, the clouds. There was this mare thatnlooked similar to her that I once knew from what seemed to be only anfew months from my past. As I stood in almost a trance-like state myntime of trying to recall who this heavenly mare was, was cut short. I suddenly found myselfnstanding in the direct line of fire of this enormous, no wait, angargantuan black stallion. His eyes glowed red, his ears if therenwere any were probably pinned back underneath the thick long flowingnbush thing often referred to as a mane. He was a force NOT to reckonnwith. But hey, I'm young that mare interested me I stood andnfought. BAM! His teeth sunkninto my chest, I rear out of pain and aggression. One leg strike outnand struck the square of his muzzle. Startled he stopped but just forna minuet. I spun and put my haunches to him and let the cannons firenin his direction. Apparently as I was spinning he had done the same.nOne of his trunk-like legs struck my tail head, the other clipped thenedge of my haunch. Again the cannons fired and again. This time asnmine landed on the ground I lowered my head spun on the fore and mynteeth locked onto the bulging hock tearing the first layer of skinnleaving the blood gushing. Sure he was bigger, more muscular, andnwith out a doubt more powerful than I. However I am slimmer and builtnfor speed, which means I am definitely more agile than he. His front hoof landednon my hind end, I once again clamped my teeth on one of his legs.nThis time it was his front leg, and not only did I break skin but Indo believe that I pulled at least a tendon out. He was still going atnme. He had two injured legs. I could of sworn that my bite to hisnhock would of made him un stable in the hind end and unable tonmaintain his balance when rear..oh! Once more he rears I ram my headnto his gut with teeth exposed. This, my friends hit his Alkies Heelnso to say, the weak spot on the solid mass of nothing but sheernmuscle. He toppled over wedging his already injured hind leg innbetween a split log and the suction of mud plus the weight of anboulder. He struggled to free himself, but his perilous cries andnattempts to free his leg were for nothing. I had him down and beyondnany shape to walk. I proudly ran to the mares encompassed them,nsnaked some, scoping those I wanted, they knew I was in charge. Inmade my way to the one I had become so entranced with. Not only did Inrecognize her but she recognized me! I could not believe my eyes. Itnwas her it was indeed her, Luyu! But this was neither a time nor thenplace for a reunion of any sorts if I was to keep her and the other Inhad to move them, now! I took off towards the horizon with Luyu by mynside. Just a little fartherndown and over a creek or two there was the rest of my band. At last anreunion could be had!

This fiction revolves around Tom Lefroy. It takes place after the failed elopement between Tom and Jane. Tom is currently engaged to Mary Paul. Fantasy & Responsibility Chapter One The window was encircled with frost and let in the cold January draft. Each monotonous exhale added a misty fog to the glass. Beyond the window the world seemed to lay in a timeless frozen hibernation. The nights were slowly growing longer as day continually turned to night in an endless parade of empty tomorrows. Thomas placed his shivering fingers on the frozen pane of glass. He mindlessly traced the frosty surface with his fingertips. With each successive finger wipe, an increasing view of the frigid Irish countryside was revealed. But Thomas was uninterested in the panorama on display beyond the glass. He was not enjoying the touch of the cool glass under his fingers or the soft velvet cushion on which he sat. The only thing that Thomas could feel or think about was the dull ache in his head and the sharp pain in his chest. He felt more hollow and frozen than the scene that was displayed beyond his gaze. His mind was dizzy and spinning with an endless string of pointed thoughts. Thomas felt that he was at war with the conflicting thoughts that resided in his mind. He could not sleep, read or think clearly without the pressuring influence of his heavy mind. He tried to distract himself by entertaining friends, staying out late and drinking a little more than he should. But no matter how hard he tried; he could not shake the heavy burden that sat firmly upon him. He felt as if he was occupying an increasingly smaller place, one that was constantly sandwiched between fantasy and reality. He was currently living in the dull morning light of reality, or at least trying to do so, anyway. He was trying to keep his mind focused on his duties to his job, and his family. He was trying to convince himself that he was being gallant by being the responsible one. However, Thomas had never felt less gallant or focused. He felt more as though he was horse dung that was smeared along the road by a passing parade of elephants. Every morning Thomas had to force himself to awaken and pry himself out of his warm bed. Each new dawn he had to consciously choose to face the reality that the morning light would bring, and leave behind the comfort and warmth of his dream world. A fantasy land that was occupied by a beautiful young maiden and in which love conquered all. He knew that growing up, being ethical and responsible meant that he was meant to leave his daydreams behind. However, he also didn't think that he could survive the harsh light of reality without the soft, luxurious pillow of fantasy to lull him to sleep each night.[Chapter 2] The story to follow is inspired by the film Becoming Jane. This fiction revolves around Tom Lefroy. It takes place after the failed elopement between Tom and Jane. Tom is currently engaged to Mary Paul. Fantasy & Responsibility Chapter 2 Thomas' heavy eye-lids fluttered open at the first light of dawn. He lay in bed with his eyes slightly open and listened to the soft twitter of the birds beyond his windows. He used to love listening to the optimistic song of the birds, but now he felt close to cursing them every morning. Thomas pulled his covers over his head and tried to block out the noise and sunlight. He lay for several minutes with his face buried beneath the softness of his covers. However, Thomas' hiding from the light didn't seem to stop it from being there and beckoning him to rise and join the morning. Thomas grudgingly pulled the down covers from his face, and rose slowly. He sat on the bed, and ever so slowly placed each foot upon the floor. It was as if he would be swallowed whole if his feet hit the cold wood below him. There was a soft knock upon the door, and Thomas barely had a moment to process this presence, when the door was flung open in haste. Thomas's normally docile footman entered the room carrying a cup of tea. Edmund placed the tea on the night-table with such vigor that the warm brown liquid sloshed and almost spilled in his rapidity. \"Excuse me, sir… You are to meet Miss Mary Paul this morning, sir. I trust you have not forgotten\" Edmund said hesitantly. \"Of course not!\" replied Thomas. However, Thomas had indeed forgotten his prior engagement with Miss Mary Paul. They had previously planned on finalizing the remaining wedding plans. How could he forget the wedding? Thomas had agreed to marry Miss Mary Paul. He had decided to do the noble and respectable thing by marrying a woman who could ensure his family's financial success. If he married her, he would no longer have to worry about the future of himself or his family. However, this certain future, though reliable, was becoming increasingly apparent as a future that Tom did not want for himself. Mary was a kind, beautiful, steady and generous woman who could ensure that he would be able to have a respectable, secure family. However, Thomas couldn't help but feeling this sense of lingering wonder for what else his life could be. His head was full of what ifs from his past that he could not shake. At first, Thomas thought that he would be able to manage the sacrifice of his desires, for a secure base for the benefit of his family. However, as the wedding date crept increasingly near, the more unsettled and unsure Thomas became. He was becoming alarming anxious as the days wore away between him and his eventual marriage. He felt as though he was only a whisper of the confident, intelligent, effective man he used to be. Thomas felt petrified of the idea of promising forever to Miss Mary Paul. At first, he thought it was just 'cold feet' and that he would warm to the idea over time. But, time had passed, and he was still afraid of agreeing to such a lengthy contract of convenience. And, he couldn't shake the memory of a time when promising himself to a woman forever did not invoke anxiety, but excitement, recklessness and passion. But, this was not a memory of this woman, this kind, respectable woman, but instead the woman who had captured his heart a number of years ago and had never softened her grasp. Thomas found himself longing for the days in which life-altering decisions were made on gut feeling and emotion, than a lengthy comparison of the pros and cons of a situation. Thomas' head was full of this spinning decision-making, and missed the roar of his heart leading the way.[Chapter 3] The story to follow is inspired by the film Becoming Jane. This fiction revolves around Tom Lefroy. It takes place after the failed elopement between Tom and Jane. Tom is currently engaged to Mary Paul. Fantasy & Responsibility Chapter 3 Thomas was seated in a drafty carriage. He felt the chill of the cold January morning biting down to his bones. He pulled his coat tighter around himself and crossed his arms to keep out the cold. \"Cold, damp, drafty… I can feel every bump through my bones…\" he muttered disapprovingly to himself. \"I'm in a wintry hell\". Thomas could not stop his mind from playing over and over on his disadvantaged situation. He had thought that he would have accepted his fate by now, but Thomas had not even begun to do so. He could not accept that at such a young age he would be resigning any hope of happiness that lay ahead of him. By continuing with this marriage scheme, he would be moving even further away from the woman that he truly loved. Jane. It had been years since they had parted ways, but he still could not help thinking about her. When it came to Jane, things were always bitter-sweet. He thought about her beauty, intelligence and wit. But when he did so, he could not help but remember the pain and the loss that he felt without her. Thomas' thoughts darkened as he ruminated further on his lost love. Suddenly, the old wooden carriage jolted backwards, sending Thomas out of his seat and flying clear across the compartment. Rumpled and sore, Thomas pushed himself up from the carriage floor, and looked around curiously. The carriage door creaked open, and a young man pushed his freckled face into the cab. \"Are you alright, sir?\" the youth inquired anxiously. \"Aye. Just a few bumps and bruises.\" Thomas replied reassuringly. \"It seems as though we've broken a wheel, sir,\" the young man added. Tired, cold and disgruntled, Tom slowly removed himself from the carriage compartment. He looked around carefully to survey the damage. Seeing that the wheel as beyond repair, Thomas sent his footman back to his home, while Thomas mounted the horse and rode on ahead.[Chapter 4] The story to follow is inspired by the film Becoming Jane. This fiction revolves around Tom Lefroy. It takes place after the failed elopement between Tom and Jane. Tom is currently engaged to Mary Paul. Fantasy & Responsibility Chapter Four The cold January morning turned into an even colder January afternoon. The clear blue skies had darkened, and a torrent of freezing rain splattered the ground. Thomas' previously rather grim mood had been growing increasingly despondent by the minute. Thomas had already travelled a significant length of his journey, so turning back and returning home now was impossible. He simply had to keep going and get to Miss Mary Paul's as soon as possible. As Thomas rode the wind nipped around him in great gales. He had to exert himself simply to remain upright on his horse. Thomas was frozen, exhausted and depressed. He could not maintain his concentration for long, and he soon had allowed his mind to wander a great deal. No matter how much Thomas tried to force it from his mind, he continued to find himself at an impasse. He could not marry Miss Mary Paul. It was not fair to himself, or to her. How would she feel if she knew that she was always to be second best? Thomas continued to ponder this conclusion for sometime while he tried to figure out the best way to tell a woman to whom you are engaged that, in fact, you cannot marry her. This inevitability weighed heavy on Thomas for some time. As Thomas rode though the freezing-rain and pondered his situation, he had totally lost touch with the reality of what was occurring around him. He had failed to pay attention to where he was or where he was going. Thomas found himself on a small muddy path which wound its way though a dim, deserted forest. Suddenly, Thomas realized he had no idea where he was, and began to panic a little. He searched to the left, and to the right, and discovered that neither path would take him towards the house of Mary Paul. Despondent, and discouraged, Thomas began to turn his horse around and return the way he had come.[Chapter 5] The story to follow is inspired by the film Becoming Jane. This fiction revolves around Tom Lefroy. It takes place after the failed elopement between Tom and Jane. Tom is currently engaged to Mary Paul. Fantasy & Responsibility Chapter Five Miss Mary Paul heard her soft footsteps on the cold wooden floor as she anxiously paced back and forth in front of the foggy window in the sitting room. Her pale blue muslin gown fluttered gracefully in her wake. Mary had absent-mindedly twirled her hair to the extent in which it was almost in knots. She had been occupied as such for almost two hours. Mary occasionally ceased pacing, and would wipe the foggy glass with her slender fingertips. She would put her nose to the cool windowpane, and peer expectantly through the torrent of freezing rain and down the laneway. Once she had determined that the laneway was still empty, she would resume pacing and muttering to herself. Mary was distraught. Thomas was supposed to be at her house hours ago. She could not help but allow her mind to entertain the many fates that could have befallen him. Perhaps he has fallen from his horse? Maybe bandits abducted him? Perhaps he has gotten lost? However, there was one thought, which she refused to consciously entertain, but she could still feel it lingering within her. She could not shake this cold uncomfortable feeling that he had consciously chosen not to come and see her. That he had decided not to marry her, after all. Mary tried to force this unwelcome thought from her mind. She knew that Thomas was a reliable, honorable man. He would not rescind his promise to her. At least, she didn't think so. However, she could not help but remember Thomas' behavior as late. He had been increasingly cold and distant from her. She had thought that it was just 'cold feet' regarding the approaching wedding, but the date was creeping alarmingly near, and he still did not seem to be warming to the idea. Mary had, at first, agreed to marry Thomas because her family had wanted her to do so. However, as the years wore on during their engagement, Thomas had grown on her. Mary had recently discovered that she truly did love this man. She was a practical woman, and did not need Thomas to be desperately in love with her. However, she still couldn't help but feel empty when she thought about the possibility that Thomas may not actually want to marry her. It was a chilling thought. As Mary was mulling over these distressing ideas, she heard the soft hoof-beats of a horse coming down the laneway towards the house. Mary jumped towards the window, and peered out through the foggy glass. She could see the dark outline of Thomas riding towards the house. \"He has come at last!\" she exclaimed, and ran towards the door, flinging it open wildly, and running outside into the cold icy rain.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 Mary was perched expectantly on a red silk chair. She had been staring at the solid mahogany door in front of her for at least a half hour. She felt impatient listening to the ticking of the large clock down the hallway. Tick, tick, tick. Each sound frayed her nerves and made her twitch. Mary could hear soft muffled sounds coming from behind the door. She could distinguish the two male voices but could not make out the words. Mary would have to continue to wait. She tried in vain to keep her swirling thoughts away from exploring the fear and anxiety that continued to rise inside her. She felt as if she waited one moment longer she would explode into a million separate pieces. Mary heard the voices get louder, and she heard creaky foot steps from the wooden floor in the room in front of her. She also heard the turning of a old metal door knob. Mary rose from her satin chair in expectation, as the dark wooden door in front of her opened, and two gentlemen came into the hallway. Mary looked at the men anxiously. \"He still has a fever, but I think he's through the worst part. There is hope in that. I will return in the morning.\" declared Dr. Farrell. Mary's father nodded in reply and began to walk with the doctor down the long green hallway towards the front door. Mary used this moment as an opportunity to sneak into the guest room and check on her patient. The large canopy bed was situated at the far end of the room. The doctor had closed the windows and shutters tightly to prevent bad air from coming in. Mary peered into the stuffy darkness, and walked to the bed cautiously. Mary rose her hand, and gently touched the forehead of the man in the bed. She observed that the man did, indeed, still have a fever and was still clammy to the touch. She did not think he had gotten much better, although he had been bed-ridden for two days. Mary felt the anxiety rise inside her chest again, as she worried about the fate of her dear one.[Chapter 7] The story to follow is inspired by the film Becoming Jane. This fiction revolves around Tom Lefroy. It takes place after the failed elopement between Tom and Jane. Tom is currently engaged to Mary Paul. Fantasy & Responsibility Chapter 7 Mary sat impatiently on an uncomfortable chair that was placed beside the large bed that Thomas had been lying in for days now. She couldn't eat, or sleep properly, or even read to pass the time. She couldn't stop her barrage of dark anxious thoughts. They were swirling in her head, trying to convince her that Thomas was not going to recover from this fever. That she would indeed lose her dear one and end up all alone. Mary couldn't help but shiver at the thought. She felt frustrated that there was no more that she could do, so she just sat and waited. And waited. She heard the ticking of the clock, she heard the twittering of the birds beyond the window, and the sound of rustling in the hall. She had blocked all of these distractions, and had been listening to Thomas breath. Each breath was still laboured and slow. Mary was trying to calm herself by listening to each inhale and exhale. But, it continued to overwhelm her. When Mary thought she could not take this waiting anymore, she heard him let out a painful moaning sound. Mary noticed that he was tossing and turning in the bed. What had previously been a clammy forehead was now completely drenched in sweat. Mary rose quickly to obtain a basin with cold water and a cloth. She applied the cool cloth to his burning forehead in attempt to ease this spike in his fever. Mary was muttering soft reassuring sounds to Thomas. She was hoping that he would hear her voice and know she was still there. She was hoping to ease his pain... somewhat. Mary put the cloth in the basin of cold water, and then reapplied it to Thomas' soaking skin. He let out another horrendous moan, but this time his eyes had fluttered open. Mary's arms flung out as she embraced her dear one tightly. She could feel the desperate heat of his body. She could feel each laboured breath on her cheek. She heard Thomas try to speak, so she sat up slowly. Thomas' eyes were still very glazed and he was not actually looking at her. She heard him try to speak again. She thought it sounded like 'Jane'. But, Mary could not be sure. She did not know anyone named Jane. She must have misheard him. But, he had muttered again and she knew she heard him properly this time. Mary was sure that Thomas had just told her \"I love you... Jane\". ","Summary":" The story to follow is inspired by the film Becoming Jane.

AND A COPY OF THE MOVIE HEHE PLEASE, R&R...; THIS IS SET SHORTLY AFTER THEIR FAILED ELOPEMENT IN WHICH JANE VENTURES BACK INTO TOWN AFTER HAVING BROKEN OFF THE ENGAGEMENT WITH MR, WISLEY. The house was just as she remembered it. \"Mrs. Radcliffe.\" Jane curtsied and upon her gesture being returned the older woman smiled and took her by the arm leading her to the couch. \"My dear Miss Austen! You are a sight for these sore old eyes indeed!\" Jane smiled warmly to her. \"I have brought you something; a bit of a surprise I'm afraid. I had hoped I might break a small rule of propriety and impose upon you a stay for a bit.\" Jane pulled out a tightly wrapped parcel and upon seeing its contents became perfectly entranced and did not respond to Jane immediately. \"You have learned the areas of the heart you knew not of upon your last visit I presume?\" Unruly dark hair, brilliant green eyes, and a lopsided mischievous grin flashed before Jane's eyes. \"Indeed Mrs. Radcliffe, I fear that I have.\" The older woman nodded her approval. \"Then my dear, you may stay as long as you wish with no imposition whatsoever.\" They sat quietly while Mrs. Radcliffe began to read Jane's new pride and joy, Frist Impressions. And just as suddenly as she had begun she broke the silence, setting the manuscript down carefully next to her. \"Now tell me of the rumors that have been echoing all over town! Will you visit you Mr. Lefroy while you are here dear Miss Austen?\" Jane's brows furrowed and Mrs. Radcliffe drew her own conclusions on the matter. \"Indeed, I was quite afraid of that when I saw him last.\" She shook her head and returned to her reading. Jane sighed, knowing she was being baited. She had bid Henry and Eliza never to speak of him but now that the proverbial Pandora's box was opened she could not bring herself to close it and banish the image of his beautiful countenance as she had forced herself so unsuccessfully to do these past long months. Before Jane could begin to speak it would seem Mrs. Radcliffe read her mind. \"Indeed I shall tell you all of Mr. Lefroy if you would deign take a stroll with an old lady.\" Jane smiled obligingly hoping her friend could not hear her heart skip beats as it did at the mention of his name as well as the thoughts of him that left her cheeks burning. As they wandered along the gardens in silence it was now more than Jane's cheeks that burned, her mind was alit with thoughts of her Tom. She knew she was being perfectly silly indeed. She had no claim to him, even before their failed elopement. And what a disaster that had been for them all, Jane thought. \"Oh Jane, I feel he is most unwell. He has become a top student and has gained his uncle's favors once again as he had when he was a boy.\" Jane found herself puzzled. \"It sounds as if Mr. Lefroy was no longer the Irish rogue that we knew Mrs. Radcliffe. He sounds very well indeed.\" With a heavy sigh, her friend continued. \"No Jane, he is indeed unwell. He wanders as if lost, unable to keep up his sham of profligacy, only going where he must. The two balls past he only attended because the rules of society and his uncle obliged him and even then with no dancing and little if any laughter. Even with your brother's visit, he seemed even more solemn than ever. He looks as a caged bird, desperate and longing to be freed. He is even more disheveled than before and despite mine and my husband's letters urging for visits once again, he says it is too painful.\" By now the pair had stopped Jane sinking quickly into a nearby bench to bend to the will of her knees, which only moments before were threatening to give way underneath her body. \"Oh Miss Austen, I have troubled you! You must in return tell me all, help me understand. I have heard the rumors and seeing you now I do so fear for my dear friends.\" Jane's head sunk into her waiting hands as if the news was simply too heavy for her brain to bear. And it was here, with dark falling and to a woman she had not yet taken into her confidences in a strange place, that Jane began the story of Miss Austen and Mr. Lefroy.[Chapter 2] Title: First Impressions (Part Two) Chapter 2: Confessions and Dancing Disclaimer: This story is for entertainment purposes only.

When all was told exactly as it had been, in as vivid detail as she could muster despite the blushes that accompanied the telling of their passionate kisses shared in the dark searches of their love, Mrs. Ratcliffe listened silently til all was done and a time after that as Jane cried on her shoulder. Only as she began to collect herself did the elder woman speak. \"I do believe, Miss Austen, we shall venture back. I have a manuscript to read you know.\" She smiled warmly at her young friend and taking her by the arm she worked out a plan. The next morning when Jane awoke she found a large package next to her dressing bureau. Upon opening it revealed a beautiful gown fir for a queen. There was an invitation to a ball being held that night here at one of the neighbor's homes. There was a knock at the door an the serving girl peeped in. \"Morning to you mam.\" The Irish accent was unmistakable an sent a stabbing pain through her heart. All she could muster was a half-hearted morning in return. \"I hope you fancy your dress mam. The mistress picked it out 'specially for you last night after accepting the invitation quite as soon as it came.\" \"That was very kind of her I'm sure but I must speak to her...\" Before Jane could say because she could not attend the serving girl quickly shook her head. \"No mam, she must not be disturbed for any reason were her orders this morning. Don't want me getting dismissed do ya mam?\" \"Well of course not, but..\" \"Then I will help you dress for the ball whenever you fancy it Miss.\" With a quick curtsey she was gone leaving Jane quite alone with the deafening sounds of her thoughts, hopes, and yes- fears of the possibility seeing Mr. Lefroy again after the passing months. The house was set up quite exquisitely as was expected from all the London balls but Jane was too nervous to expand on any type of mental description to be retold to Cassandra later. Her eyes went every possibly way, searching every corner, every crevice and nook for him. To a passerby it simply looked as if a shy newcomer was admiring a London home. Despite her dress, all would assume it was her first time to town. Mrs. Ratcliffe however smiled inwardly at the idea that the two could be the Romeo and Juliet of their day, a love story to be remembered and yet neither of them knew it. Her husband, not following her train of thought, leaned over to whisper, \"The cat would like the canary you just ate back my dear, and quite soon.\" She turned to him, eyes laughing. \"All that's left is a tiny yellow feather. You may take it to him if you wish Mr. Ratcliffe.\" To him, her appearance seemed a decade younger in the candle light. \"It seems Miss Austen's impromptu visit has done you much good Mrs. Ratcliffe. I dare say I see the young lady I took home on our wedding night in there.\" Normally a sensible authoress would not blush at her husband's advances, but the elderly lady who turned to give her a look of shame did. \"I do hope she enjoys herself tonight sir, she does do deserve it.\" And by 'it' she meant one Mr. Tom Lefroy. As the night wore on, Jane was requested on the dance floor some six times before Mrs. Ratcliffe urged her onto the floor with a gentle nudge. Stubbornly, she refused to speak to her partner, a handsome enough man of four and twenty years- only two years her senior. However her mind could only reverberate one thought, ' He is no Tom.' And then the dance ended quite as it should, partners parting ways. Quickly, Jane curtsied and fled back to her corner so as to observe the room and it's contents more closely. \"I dare say your flight has crushed the poor lad,\" there was a small pause here. \"and you still have not stopped considering yourself a cut higher than the company I see.\" The voice that she had so longed to hear set her heart ablaze and the one thought remained, 'Tom.' She curtsied slowly trying to form words as if going to make her leave from him when he spoke again quickly. \"Why Miss Austen, I have left you speechless. I daresay this is one for the history books, is it not?\" \"Mr. Lefroy.\" His eyes seemed to drink her in all at once as a man dying of dehydration cannot stop gulping refreshment down despite it gagging and choking him. At least that is how she described it in her letter to Cassandra. He bowed slightly to her before he spoke again. \"It be a great honor if you would stoop to honor me with the next dance.\" He offered his arm and as she took it the tingling sensation seemed to climb its way up her arm and through her whole body. They danced in silence, eyes never leaving the other. And as eyes watched the dance, one face smiled as the other began to seek out information as the to girl's departure date, hoping it would be very soon.[Chapter 3] Title: First Impressions (Part Two) Chapter 3: Tom Disclaimer: This story is for entertainment purposes only.

Another boring group of boring people with boring conversation with the same boring music and dancers. Tom was bored just thinking of it. But Mrs. Ratcliffe had written him this very morning with a request of his attendance as a personal favor to accompany her and her husband and to act as an escort to her guest. He feared a set up but his guilt at neglecting his friendship with the couple would force, propel him even, to attend tonight instead of begging off as he had originally planned. His uncle was of course pleased with news of his confirmed attendance. When the mention of the idea a match may have been found for him, his uncle promptly confirmed his own attendance. He had planned to suck Tom into a few 'accidental' business meetings. Despite his tomfoolery, his nephew was brilliant when he wanted to be and the Judge was hoping beyond hope tonight that brilliance would have a chance to shine through. When time for the ball rolled around, true to character Tom was still not ready. \"Apologies to my uncle please John. I will be along presently.\" Tom's manservant nodded and went to deliver his message while Tom finished dressing. Only a half hour past seven when he finally arrived and Mrs Ratcliffe was waiting for him near the door. \"I do apologize my friend, it seems my guest tired of waiting for her escort and is dancing with another. You must go reclaim her as soon as the music dies. She is quite the catch you know.\" And still her eyes danced in a way that Tom, nor any other, had seen in quite a while in a way that inwardly had Tom sighing. \"If she has already found an appropriate escort, my services seem to be unneeded ma'am.\" He began to turn away when she stopped him with a hand on his arm. \"This one you will want to reclaim Tom. I am completely certain of it. Hurry now the song is ending.\" She turned him in the direction of the floor and watched as his breath caught when he saw her. In a dress fit for any snobbish city lady, she was truly a vision of beauty in a way that all the other girls in attendance would envy and attempt to capture for many balls to come. He noted how distracted she looked. \"She also finished her manuscript,\" she said lowly and then gave him a little push. \"Make haste Tom!\" He needed no further encouragement. He watched as she curtsied quickly fleeing her partner for safer refuge. As she had not yet seen him he had a few moments to formulate what he would say to her and after their last meeting he knew he would need that little edge. The thoughts of the last time he had seen her made him cringe. And then something strange happened. He watched as her eyes scanned the room. Could it be? Could she truly be searching me out? And with that he felt as a young man again, his heart given wings. All worries he might not be well received were gone, filled now with only one. ' Jane.' He approached her from the side, careful to stay out of sight until he was ready. For a moment he just took her in. She was far too lovely for his own good to be sure. And then he could help himself no longer, he felt the need just to hear her voice again, to spar with her verbally and watch her eyes sparkle and dance, both knowing they'd met their true match. He leaned in close to her and kept his voice low, immensely enjoying taking her by surprise. \"I daresay,\" she jumped and then seemed to release a breath in relief as she leaned towards his voice. \"your flight has crushed the poor lad.\" She leaned even closer to him now making his heart race. \"And you still have not stopped considering yourself a cut above the company I see.\" She awarded him a small smile for his efforts as he lowered his voice even further before speaking her name. \"Miss Austen.\" For a moment neither spoke nor moved til she, always the sensible one, moved away to curtsey to him and for a moment he feared she would try to crush him as she had her other young suitor tonight by fleeing his presence. So he did the mature thing and baited her. \"Why Miss Austen, I have left you speechless. I daresay this is one for the history books, is it not?\" \"Mr. Lefroy.\" The look in her eyes said it all. He bowed slightly to her then repeated more words from their first ball together, almost begging her hand for the next dance. As the music began and they took their places across from each other, every touch seemed to vibrate their souls, every glance seemed to fill their hearts with love that could have burst through their very chests. The music was slower, giving the lovers time to savor every moment. This dance was passionate and to the pair seemed to end all too soon but to one observer, could not have ended quickly enough.[Chapter 4] Title: First Impressions (Part Two) Chapter 2: Tsk, Tsk... Disclaimer: This story is for entertainment purposes only. I do not own anything but my VERY wild imagination. Author's Note: So one of my new goals (I don't do the whole resolution thing) is to update my stories at least once a month. So at least that way I'll be writing. I do miss it so!

Hehe ¸.•¨) ¸.•¨) ¸.•¨ (¸... ¸.•..' The dance was over but he couldn't let her out of his sight. Here she was, a captivating siren and he planned to never let her out of his sight again. \"Would you fancy a stroll Miss Austen?\" Again she flashed almost a small, sad smiled. \"If you wish Mr. Lefroy.\" She took his arm and they strolled leisurely outside into the cool night air in silence. The both began to speak at the same time, each trying to break the ice they knew didn't belong between them. \"This is a bit awkward, is it not Mr. Lefroy?\" He stopped and turned to face her. \"Please let us stop this Jane. My name is Tom to you and you know this. I beg you, please disperse of the niceties.\" If his passionate response to her attempt at civil conversation took her aback she hid it well. \"As you wish Tom.\" He shot a breath out, clearly frustrated with her. \"No Jane, I seem to have forgotten it is not as I wish but as you do. If you wish to consider us as strangers then please let us keep up this charade but believe me when I say that I am unconvinced by it. You however seem perfectly happy to its upkeep despite Mrs. Ratcliffe inviting me here particularly for you!\" Seeing no end to his passionate rant she interjected as she felt she must. \"Insufferable man! Have you no decency at all? Don't you understand? Nothing is as it was! This charade as you called it was to ease your mind and transition into a new kind of relationship with me, that is not as the previous, in the public eye. Specifically the Judge who has watched you as a hawk eying its prey as you have paid attention to no one but myself.\" At that he shot her a disgusted look. \"Now hear me! That is because no one could captivate me as you do, bewitching woman!\" And her anger flared once again. \"Strong willed Mr. Lefroy taking the coward's way out and blaming the country mouse for an elephant stomping by!\" \"Are you calling me an elephant?\" This flustered her only for a moment and then the words he had said on the ill fated day that they had forgotten all they had been taught left his lips once again. \"I can fight myself no longer.\" With that he grabbed her face, pulling her to him fiercely and kissed her with such a passion that she thought she might faint, which by many a woman's description is how it ought to be. She would later describe it to Cassandra as being so much different than all the others! His emotions leaked through; his desperation, longing, and most of all his love. So many emotions conveyed in one kiss she could drown in them. When he pulled back from her he stayed close, letting their noses touch affectionately. \"My love.\" He whispered quietly and the sincerity in his voice nearly broke her heart. \"You cannot know how I have longed for you. Your voice, your touch, your smell. Your lovely laugh and your bold, daring eyes.\" Breathless she responded to him, each trying to make the other see. \"Oh Tom, I do! I do know because in this heart of hearts I have been longing for you as well since our last parting. Every moment, my sweet friend, your pain has been shared with mine as if our hearts were bonded.\" His joy was written all over his face at her confession. \"Don't you see Jane? They are! It would be a lie to say I have been bonded to you since I first laid eyes upon you but it was not very much after that that I became so. I have been and I will remain yours.\" He embraced her then, holding her close to his heart which was thundering as hers was. \"Oh my darling Jane, I told you I would ever let you go and I have not. I will not fail you.\" The voices that broke them apart were the most unwelcome noise to be sure. \"Go my dear, I shall come in after you. Perhaps no one has noticed us missing just yet.\" Laughing to herself as she stole back inside and she noticed Mrs. Ratcliffe's face she realized they had noticed. They had all noticed.[Chapter 5] Title: First Impressions (Part Two) Chapter 5: Letters Between Sisters Disclaimer: This story is for entertainment purposes only.

My Dearest Cassandra, It would appear that my friend Mrs. Ratcliffe has played matchmaker to my welcome surprise and she has united Tom and myself in what I hope will not be yet another fruitless endeavor. Oh how my heart flies at the thought of him Cassie! Ever more now so that his affections have been reconfirmed! Isn't it all just perfectly wonderful? The postman has arrived I will write telling you all on the marrow. Til then, Your Loving (if not a bit besotted) sister, Jane Darling Jane, How wonderful indeed but I fear I must be the voice of cautious reason and warn you again to be careful with your heart. It has been broken once and I don't think I could bear it again. Has he learned of your invitation to Mr. Wisley's home upon your return from London? My sense is he will not take the news well if my impressions of him are correct. Because despite the debate sister, your curiosity as to what he could possibly want will win out any excuses not to go. Mother is calling, she says she knows not what to do without you but is happy you are in higher spirits. Worry not darling sister, I have said nothing about your last letter's contents save the fact you attended a lovely ball. Always, Your loving sister, Cassandra Cassandra, Thank you for not involving mother just yet. She would have a fit and I could not bare to allow you to accept the repercussions of that, alone at least! Mrs. Ratcliffe has invited me to stay another week at the latest in her home. She sends high praises of my novel as she pours over it in her study, warming my heart to be sure dear sister. As far as Mr. Lefroy goes I have heard from him not since the ball. Despite it only being two nights ago I admit I expected him to write at once. I fear I have been confiding in Mrs. Ratcliffe while I would much rather have you to speak to. I will wait this out a few more days just to be sure. My hopes it seems are becoming depressingly low. But he confessed all to me, including current affections and I must say I confessed mine as well. Confessing them at present, however, seems shameful. Should I pursue this course? Oh Cassie how lost I feel! My moral compass that so often points due North seems to be spinning so quickly I have no hopes at sensing which direction to go. For now, it is tea time in the Ratcliffe house. Forever yours though slightly confused, Jane. Dear Jane, How unkind that you have had no word, surely one will come soon! Have you seen him about town? There would seem to have to be an explanation. Surely his feelings could not have changed in only four days. How could they if he's truly waited these months for you? I fear I have been digging potatoes all day so I will rest my hand now. Do write back again soon, I miss you so! Always yours, Cassie Cassie, How unkind indeed. There has been an explanation for all! I have indeed seen Mr. Lefroy and am happy to report dear sister that I will be leaving for home tomorrow. Fear not I will report all, I cannot bare to write to you of it all just now. All my love, Jane.[Chapter 6] Title: First Impressions (Part Two) Chapter 6: Visits: Concluded & Beginning Disclaimer: This story is for entertainment purposes only. I do not own anything but my VERY wild imagination. Author's Note: I have been updating quite a few of my fanfictions! You should go look :) \"Three days had passed since I had seen him or heard anything so I assumed the worst. Desperate, I asked Mrs. Ratcliffe to invite him for a visit, careful not to mention my prolonged presence in case the Judge might intercept our letter although I'm certain he already knew.\" \"And did he come?\" Jane nodded and tears sprinkled her eyes. \"Yes dear Cassandra, he came. He and a lady named Mary Paul.' She took a deep breath before continuing. \"The lady he is to marry.\" Cassandra gasped with the appropriate amount of shock one could feel in this sort of situation. \"I thought the engagement was broken off after your... well, you know.\" Cassandra diverted her eyes away from her sister's face. \"Yes my dear, but it seems it is back on. He avoided my gaze at all cost and would speak to me not. I fear all my hopes have been crushed again as you had warned.\" That night Cassandra held her sister as she cried once again for her beloved Mr. Lefroy. The next morning when she awoke she made a promise to herself to rid herself of the Irish rogue once and for all. She confided her self-made pact to her sister who wholeheartedly agreed to help her to keep it. Jane threw herself into her writing and chores, helping her mother and even helping her father write his sermons as he's let her, much as she had the first time the couple had come to be separated. And then she reclaimed something she had been neglecting. She ran to her room finding her letter box and took out the letter from Mr. Wisley and wrote hastily to him. Dear Mr. Wisley, Thank you for your kind invitation to your home. I apologize for the late response to you, I have had a short stay in London but as I am back now I would enjoy a special visit to hear your wonderful news that you had written about! I am in the throws of anticipation. Sincerely Yours, Miss. Jane Austen Jane sent the letter to post immediately and instructed Cassandra to start packing. \"I will speak with Father, just be ready. How scandalized will her Ladyship be if we were to beat our letter there!\" \"Oh Jane, you can be so terrible at times!\" Jane simply laughed and made haste to his study. \"Papa?\" Her voice was almost timid, as she had been since her return from London. He didn't have to guess what had put her in such a state. \"Yes dear? Come in.\" Jane entered his study and began her request. \"Mr. Wisley has written to me on Lady Gresham's behalf and they have requested a visit. I would love to take Cassandra with me for a short stay if you'd be willing to give our little excursion your blessing.\" \"Mr. Wisley you said?\" To which Jane nodded her affirmation. \"Hmmm... I suppose you have my blessing. Go now before Mrs. Austen catches wind of this please.\" Jane laughed and called for horses to be on their way. Once all was in place they loaded their small bags but Cassandra could tell. \"Sister, speak frankly with me. All is not as it should be with you.\" Jane sighed. \"No, and I fear it never truly shall be again.\" \"Is he really your one true happiness?\" Jane's eyes once again brimmed with tears. \"Yes dear, I believe that he is. And I am at a loss as to how to go about changing my own mind.\" Cassandra nodded and took her sister's hand, stroking it comfortingly. \"But as it is,\" Jane continued, \"I shall never see Mr. Lefroy again.\" Little did she know life had not finished crossing the lovers' paths just yet.[Chapter 7] Title: First Impressions (Part Two) Chapter 7: Off to Gresham's House Disclaimer: This story is for entertainment purposes only. I do not own anything but my VERY wild imagination. Author's Note: I have been updating quite a few of my fanfictions! You should go look :) \"I told you we should have waited for your letter to get here! This is worse than scandalizing her Ladyship Jane!\" Jane smiled to her sister, that one look telling her that was her plan in the first place. \"If you didn't want to come Jane, you should have just said so.\" Her sister's cross tone made Jane take a second look at her. \"And I could say the same of you.\" Before the conversation could continue a maid walked into the foyer. \"Her Ladyship has your rooms ready for you now if you'd like I can show you the way.\" Jane and Cassandra picked their bags up and moved after her. The anticipation of what was to come was weighing on Jane once again. Later that evening once the pair was settled a maid came back. \"I am looking for Miss Jane please ma'am.\" Jane smiled at her and stepped forward. \"I am Jane.\" The maid curtsied again and motioned for her to follow. Through the long, dark corridors of the home they went and finally the maid stopped and opened one side of a large double door and there in a grand library stood Mr. Wisley himself holding a single flower with a truly happy expression upon his face to which she was compelled to oblige. \"Mr. Wisley.\" She curtsied to him which he returned with a quick bow. \"I thought I might leave the boring polite conversation of dining with my aunt to tomorrow night and interest you in a quiet dinner here.\" He motioned to a table beside him set for two. \"I wasn't aware that you were bringing your sister as well, otherwise I would have prepared another setting.\" Jane smiled. \"That was very thoughtful of you sir. I'm sure she won't mind a night in some quiet reflection. After all isn't that what proper society ladies are supposed to do?\" He laughed aloud at her joke, something he had never done before but she was pleased with his reaction. He seemed different somehow than the last time they'd spoken near the river after her failed... She had sworn she wouldn't think of it so instead she instructed herself to think on the task at hand, finding out Mr. Wisley's wonderful news. As he pulled out her chair and they sat he gave her a moment to settle in before he began to speak. \"I trust your time in London was pleasant.\" The poor man, he couldn't help that he was bringing back so many unwanted memories. \"Yes sir, it was. Mrs. Ratcliffe and I have become very close in these past months.\" He nodded his approval at the match. \"Indeed I could see you both getting along quite well together.\" Jane nodded and as their course was brought in they lapsed into a companionable silence. \"So, my news. I know you are dying to hear it.\" Jane looked up and smiled brightly at him. \"Yes, I am. What is so wonderful you thought you needed to bring me all the way out to see you in person?\" Her tone was teasing but he caught the serious undertone to her voice. \"I thought a break might be nice, I wanted you to see...\" He broke off for a moment and then continued. \"I went to visit your parents again while you were away.\" Jane's interest was no longer simply piqued she was becoming suspicious. \"And?\" \"And, I have decided to employ two more household members in your home. Mainly for the outside work. That way you and your sister may devote more time to... how was it you put it? Things that proper ladies in society should be doing.\" He smiled fondly at her and it was then that she recognized that look. \"I want to make things easier for you Jane and for your family, I know how much they mean to you. I want you to accept my token of friendship and be as happy as your mother was.\" Inside Jane was boiling. The audacity to treat her and her family as a charity case... and then he continued. \"Jane, please. I only wanted to help. I have told you, and shown you what I have to offer. I have much changed since our discussion by the creek and I wanted to show you. You told me, in kinder words, that I bored you. I want to show you that I too can be interesting. I want you to know that you and I can have things in common. Won't you just give me that small chance as your friend Jane? Your friendship these past months has meant so much to me. I had hoped you would award me the same favor.\" When he was finished she sighed. \"Indeed Mr. Wisley. Thank you on behalf of my family. Your token of friendship is much appreciated by my mother I am sure.\" He smiled a half smile but nodded all the same. \"All I ask is your friendship Jane. If you decide you want something else from me, then I will be here.\" Jane nodded solemnly and they finished their dinner mostly in silence filled only with idle conversation before Jane retired back to her room, ready to tell Cassandra all. \"He couldn't possibly think that just because a certain someone is now re-engaged that I would just fall at his feet could he? How dare he insult me this way! I don't understand why it keeps playing out like this.\" Cassandra only smiled at her sister. \"He told you, it is simply a token of friendship and nothing more. Though he may mean more behind it, you have accepted his friendship and I think that right now he is simply looking for the same thing as you sister.\" Jane scoffed and turned sharply on her heel to face her sister. \"And what, pray tell might that be?\" \"Acceptance.\" ","Summary":" DISCLAIMER: I OWN NOTHING BUT MY OWN IMAGINATION!

How he wouldnmiss his owner, but how he thanked him for setting him free! Hidalgonreared up and neighed. A black colt galloping close by neighed,n\"Watch it!\" Hidalgo landed and followed the horses in thenstampede. Most of the horses around him had families and herds; wherenwas Hidalgo supposed to go? Hengalloped over a few hills as the horses swiftly parted into groupsnand disappeared. Hidalgo was all alone on top of the hill. He glancednaround; though only a minute ago the land was dotted with horses,nthey were all gone. Hensniffed the air. To his right there was a strong scent of a mare. Henlooked in that direction and sure enough there was a mare. Shenwas darkish grey with blue eyes, and she was stumbling. No wonder shenhad been left behind. Hidalgo trotted down the hill and stopped innfront of her. The mare laid back her ears and backed a few steps.n\"Leave me alone! I don't need a bachelor for help!\" Just as shensaid help she tripped over a rock and stumbled forward. The mare'snleg, the one she had been stumbling with earlier, slid forward andnshe neighed in pain. Hidalgo tried to help her up but as he nudgednher up she bared her teeth. \"I said I don't need your help!\"nHidalgo backed a step feeling a little raged. \" Well to be morencorrect, you don't want my help. But you do indeed need it. That'snfor sure.\" The mare snorted. \"Smarty-pants.\" Hidalgo ignorednthe comment. Henfollowed the grey mare as she stumbled on forward. \"Do you have anhome?\" The mare looked back and glared. \"No, and I don't wantnyours!\" Hidalgo once again ignored her bitterness. \"I'm notnoffering it. For one, I don't have a home, and second, if I didnhave one, I would simply try to help you home. But since you don'tnhave a home and I don't either, we're in pretty bad shape.\" \"Therenis no 'we'.\" The mare retorted. Hidalgo once again continued tonfollow her. Notnfar ahead the mare stumbled badly and fell down to her side. Hidalgonat once kneeled down and licked her leg. It was bleeding badly. Justnas she was about to neigh a protest Hidalgo asked, \"What happenednto you?\" The mare looked into his eyes with hurt. \"Why should Intell you?\" Hidalgo thought for a moment. \"Because I want tonhelp.\" The mare snorted again. \"You can't help!\" Hidalgonstood up. \"How much you want to bet?\" The mare looked confused.n\"Fine, you really want to know?\" Hidalgo nodded his headnanxiously. The mare sighed and looked down as she began her story. \"Well,nmy herd was rounded up by those two legs. I was really scared, I meannwho wouldn't be? Anyways, when we were captured the two legsnseparated me from my family and put me in a pen with this big whitenstallion who was really mean. He tried to…mate with me. When Inrefused and kicked and protested, the two legs got really angry. Theynpulled me out of the pen and started beating me with these longnropes. They burned when they hit my back. Then a male two legnapproached me angrily. He…took a dagger and…\" The mare couldn'tngo on. Hidalgo whickered encouragingly. The mare found the courage toncontinue, \"He cut my leg. Then they tied me to a pole. All the twonlegs got out daggers and started cutting me with them. It hurt sonbadly! I kicked and neighed and tried to bite their arms. But itndidn't help. After they cut me numerously they untied me and I fellnto the ground. The next day, when I still hadn't gotten up, one twonleg dragged me into that pen with all the other mustangs. Then I onentwo leg come and opened the gates. I did my best to run out. Now I amnhere.\" Thenmare looked up as a few tear drops fell down her face. Hidalgo feltnso bad for her. He had never met humans so mean. Except the time whennhe was in the boat and the hands started trying to hurt him with anpitch fork. Henlied down beside the mare. Since she couldn't find the strength tonget up, he decided they would have to stay where they were for thennight. The mare rested her head in the grass and peacefully munched.n\"Why do you want to help me anyways?\" Hidalgo looked at her sadnface. \"Because you could use some help. By the way, I'm Hidalgo.\"nThe mare nodded her head. \"I'm Shadow Storm.\" Hidalgo liked thenname. He began to munch on some grass himself. He looked at the sunnas it set. Storm asked him where he had come from and he told hernabout the Ocean of Fire and his life as an endurance horse. Stormnseemed very impressed. When the sky was dark and the all was quietnHidalgo finally let himself drift to sleep. A/N:nOkay this is my first Hidalgo FanFic, but I really hope you like it!nPlease Review![Chapter 2] A/N:nThanx for the reviews! Now, here is your reward, enjoy! Hidalgonwoke bright an early the next morning, but Storm was laying asleepnpeacefully. Hidalgo chuckled to himself; she needed more help thannshe could admit. To busy himself while Storm lay sleeping, Hidalgondecided to go and take a drink of water. Storm would be okay for anminute and besides, he could see her from the near-by pool. Henstrolled energetically to the pool and sunk his muzzle into the coolnwater. The sunlight shone down, making the water shimmer and sparkle.nHidalgo savored the sight for a moment before returning the nownwakening Storm. \"Oh,nso you just had to leave me, didn't you?\" she said, back in herngrumpy side. Hidalgo gave an apologetic neigh and changed thensubject. \"Well, the water is nice and cool, you should take a sip.\"nStorm shook her mane. \"I don't need you to tell me how to takencare of myself.\" With that she tried very hard to walk, with outnlimping, towards the pool. Hidalgo sighed and followed her. Afterna few minutes Storm was refreshed and the two travelers continued to,nslowly, move on. Hidalgo took the rear while Storm led the waynproudly. Hidalgo rolled his eyes teasingly at her confidence. She hadnso much spunk, and spirit, he just hoped it wouldn't betray her. Theynmoved through a field with very tall grass. The flies were almostnunbearable. Hidalgo realized his rumbling stomach. He would have tonget used to not being on a fixed feeding schedule now. Storm on thenother hand gave him a weird look when she heard his stomach. Hidalgonturned to look at one of the surrounding mountain peaks innembarrassment. Storm sighed and shook her head and continued onwards. Laternthey found and entered a forest. It was dark in places, but lighternwhere the treetops faded and let sunlight shine into the world ofndarkness. In one of the shady spots Hidalgo decided that Storm shouldnlay down and rest for a while. \"No,nI can keep going!\" she protested. Hidalgo shook his head. \"I knownyou can, but you don't need to. Your leg is still swollen-\" Stormnwas annoyed and cut him off. \"So what? I can go, I can be tough.\"nHidalgo knew he would have to be firm this time. \"No. Stay andnrest.\" Storm gave an irritated snort. \"Stay while you do what?\"nHidalgo glanced around at the darkness. \"While I make sure it'snsafe.\" Storm snorted again but let herself fall slowly to thenground. Hidalgo took a victorious breath, as he had been holding itnfor the past minute or two, and turned. He galloped out of sight. Stormngrumbled irritably. Thennshe heard rustling in the bushes behind her. She bolted up and turnednaround. A shiny black hoof stepped out, then another. Before shencould move away, a jet black stallion stood in front of her. \"What'snan injured ole mare like you doing in these parts?\" He saidnthreateningly. Storm let her grumpy tone get the best of her. \"Younbetter watch it bucko, I'm warning you…\" She realized hernmistake. He could easily take her on. \"Ornyou'll do what, huh? Bite me to death?\" He laughed shrilly. \"Indon't think so.\" The stallion stepped towards her. Storm laidnback her ears and tossed her head. \"Go away!\" Her neigh onlynpleased the eager stallion. \"But that would take the fun out ofnthis, wouldn't it?\" An evil grin appeared on his face. The curlsnof his muzzle made Storm shudder. She thought about taking a stepnback, but stopped herself. That would only let the stallion know shenwas scared and threatened by him. Justnas the stallion was taking another step towards the mare, who seemednfrozen in place, Hidalgo jumped through the underbrush. Before thenstallion could comment Hidalgo pounded his fore-hooves into his side.nThe stallion cringed below him and fell to his knees in shock. Stormnsaw her chance and effortly moved out of the way before she wasninjured or worse. Hidalgo slammed his hooves again into thenstallion's side. The blood that poured out from the gashes wasnthick and red. The stallion raised his black head defeated. But hisnmercy plea made Hidalgo madder. He slammed into him again and let outna shrill neigh. The stallion's head drooped down as he heaved andnpanted. His sides were bloody as they began to rise and fall slowernand slower. Hidalgo could see his anger was overcoming the patheticnscrap below him. He glanced at Storm who nodded wearily. Hidalgonslammed his hooves once more into the stallion. The now even bloodiernsides rose and fell, but then they did not rise again. The stallion'snhead fell to the ground with a treacherous thump. The sound echoed innHidalgo's mind. He had just killed a horse. Henturned gravely back to Storm who seemed untouched by the scene.nHidalgo knew she'd been through a lot, but he just couldn't helpnbut feel guilty. The two moved on through the forest before stoppingnagain. Hidalgo felt like getting as far away from the stallion'snbody as possible. The sight of his bloody sides and his desperatenface replayed again and again in his head. As he and Storm lay downnStorm could sense his quietness. \"Hengot what was coming to him.\" She said rather coldly. Hidalgonassumed she was right. He pushed the thoughts away as best he couldnand rested his head on the sweet grass. Beside him he could hearnStorm's peaceful breathing as she fell asleep. Why couldn't henjust forget about the stallion like she could? He was getting verynirritated with his mind. He sighed and snorted but nothing seemed tonhelp. Finally he thought he figured out what might help. Hidalgongot up and raced back towards the body. As he neared it a coldnfeeling took over his heart. He was cold even though he was sweatingnheavily by the time he reached the body. It was lying in the grass,nlike he had left it. The blood had long since dried and flies buzzednaround it. Hidalgo ignored them and began pawing at the ground besidenthe bloody mass. He pawed and pawed for hours until the ground he hadnmoved back was a hole. It was very deep and Hidalgo leapt out of thenhole and admired his work. Cautiously he nudged the bloody body untilnit rolled into the dark interior of the hole. Hidalgo let out a sighnand began pushing all the dirt back over it. Once he had placed allnthe dirt back, he began his longer journey home. Bynthe time he got back he was so tired, but the sun was just startingnto rise. He got a drink of water and walked towards the sleepingnStorm. She hadn't moved much since he had left. Hidalgo looked atnhimself. He was covered in sweat, and dirt stuck to his skin wherenhis sticky sweat coated him. He looked absolutely disgusting, so henplunged into the pool near-by until he was clean again. Then henwearily lay down beside Storm. Too bad for him, she was just wakingnup.[Chapter 3] A/N:nSRY for the huge wait! I have been busy with other stories asnwell…anyways, thanx for all the reviews and here is the nextnchappie. XD AsnStorm blinked Hidalgo made it appear as if he was just wakingnhimself. Storm looked at him with a suspicion as if she knew he hadngone back the rogue stallion's corpse. Hidalgo yawned with achingnweariness threatening to overwhelm his system any second. \"You looknlike you didn't get a wink of sleep last night.\" Storm commentednas she limped up onto her hooves. Hidalgo sighed and heaved himselfnupwards as well. \"I'm fine…just a nightmare.\" Storm nodded,nclearly wanting the whole story. But Hidalgo ignored her look ofnexpectancy and started onward slowly. He began wondering where theirnjourney would take them, though not for the first time. Would theynstumble around until they were picked off by bachelors? Or wouldnStorm die of infection and he weakness? All the bad possibilitiesnfloated through his mind and the more he thought about it the more henrealized what a slim chance they actually had. Then a feeling ofndread overtook him. Storm neighed encouragingly, as she wanted toncontinue on. \"Coming.\"nHidalgo mumbled. Storm led the way as they traveled onward. Thenthick, dark forest of shades had flattened out into a plain of sorts,nthough with more vegetation. Storm seemed to be enjoying herself asnthey strolled on. Hidalgo hadn't seen her look as happy for as longnas he had traveled with her. Just as he was beginning to see a sliverna hope Storm tripped over a rock that had seemed to have placednitself right before her. She shrieked in pain as her forelegsncollapsed onto the grassy earth beneath them. Hidalgo swerved to hisnleft and looked at her the foreleg which had been so badly injured.nIt looked worse now that she had stumbled. \"Just go on without me.nI don't want to be a burden.\" Storm choked the words out; it wasnobvious her leg was causing much pain for the poor mare. \"No…I'llntake care of you still.\" Hidalgo nickered, hoping to see hernconfidence return and that she would try to get up. Storm shook hernhead. \"Why are you even bothering to waste your time on an oldnretch like me?\" The mare seemed barely a shimmer of what her oldnself was like when Hidalgo first met her. As he pondered for thenright words her expression became more and more hopeless. Then thenwords sprang to mind. \"I bother to help you because; you don'tnhave to throw your whole life away, just because you're banged up anlittle. There is still hope for you.\" Hidalgo remembered Franknusing the phrase once before when Hidalgo himself had been injured.nHe hoped it would do the same for Storm as it had for him. Storm'sneyes glowed with thankfulness and she staggered to her hooves,nbearing the pain in ease now. Hidalgonlicked her leg until it ceased to spew out blood, then he nudged thenmare's neck encouragingly. With that he turned and continued tonstalk in the direction they were headed. He could hear Storm placingnher hooves delicately behind his own and the feeling of dread floatednaway. Daynturned into night as stars peeped through the orangey-purple sky. Thenmoon's light shone on stray stems of grass, giving a magical sensenof feeling to all living creatures. Crickets chirped, firefliesndanced through the darkening background. The sound of hoovesninterrupted the serene setting. As Storm and Hidalgo entered thenenvironment all the sites sparkled in their eyes. Storm sighednpeacefully and let herself collapse onto the moistening grass.nHidalgo laid himself beside her and watched the stars as they turnednfrom dull little specks to bright, gleaming lights. He wished he andnStorm could live here, but something about it just wasn't normal.nHe couldn't figure it out, so in frustration he quietly laid hisnhead down into the sweet grass to sleep. Thennext morning the two horses opened their eyes and starred in horror.nHidalgo knew why this place didn't feel right the night before now.nThey were surrounded by two legs with ropes. The sky was light bluenwith grey clouds of smoke in the air. Anything peaceful was just anmood-setter. It wasn't really as serene as the two legs made it.nStorm panicked and neighed in recognition. \"No, it's them!\" shenexclaimed. Hidalgo was about to ask her what she meant when a rotundntwo leg stepped in front of him. It mumbled something that didn'tnsound too nice then pulled out its long rope. Hidalgo neighed andnstamped both his forelegs in defiance. He knew he could easilynescape, but what about Storm? The huge two leg caught him off guardnand flung the rope at his painted head. Hidalgo leaped backwards thenrope missed his muzzle by an inch. But just when he thought he hadnshowed the two leg who was boss, another rope was thrown and itncaught his back hoof. He turned to see a skinnier two leg laughing.nStorm hadn't even been able to get up on the other hand. So manynropes were thrown at once at her as the two legs easily overtook thensurprised horses. Innthe midst of the two legs one stepped forward. She looked kind andnshe did not hold a rope in her hands. \"What is the meaning ofnthis?\" she asked as the two legs all looked at her. None spoke up.nShe pulled out a dagger from her pocket. Hidalgo prayed that shenwouldn't stab Storm or him as Storm had described that humans hadndone before. As the two leg got closer and closer Hidalgo could seenStorm shivering in panic and dread. He lashed out as the two legnstood before him. She bent over and picked up the rope that wasntightly holding Hidalgo's back hoof. She spoke softly and slowly,nin the soothing tone Hidalgo remembered that few humans ever usednwith horses. She cut the rope and Hidalgo's hoof was free. He tooknoff immediately, and then turned to look at Storm. The two leg wasnmoving over the to trembling mare. Hidalgo was waiting for her to cutnher loose, but instead the two leg said a few words and another twonleg hurried off. Three other two legs moved back and Hidalgo realizednthey had been in a round pen. The three two legs moved out and stoodnon the outside of the pen. The female two leg stayed, kneeled overnand gently rubbing Storm's injured foreleg. The one two leg thatnhad disappeared returned holding various herbs in his hands. Henentered the pen and handed them all to the female two leg. Shenoffered two of the herbs to Storm for her to eat. Storm sniffed themnand cautiously licked them up. As for the other herbs that the twonleg held she placed on the wound and the other two leg handed her anpiece of cloth which she tied around Storm's leg, wrapping thenherbs around it and letting them soak into the wound. Only after shenhad secured the cloth did she cut Storm loose. The mare staggered tonher hooves and glanced around. All the two legs made no move and shenslowly strolled towards the opening in the pen. Hidalgo neighed,nencouraging her to hurry. She tossed her mane and trotted out of thenpen and up the slope to Hidalgo. He touched noses with her, thennwatched the two legs disappear as they all walked away. Hidalgonglanced again at Storm. \"I never knew they could be nice.\" Stormnwhickered as she caught his gaze. The two just starred at eachothernfor a long time. Then Hidalgo uncomfortably glanced away, avertingnher gaze any longer. :W…We should get going\" he said ratherndully. Storm tossed her mane and nodded. Then Hidalgo started forwardnwith Storm trailing behind. A warm feeling entered Hidalgo's heart.nOne he had never felt before, and he liked it. He just wasn't surenwhat it meant.[Chapter 4] A/N:nFinally! Another chappie for my lucky reviewers! I finally have timenfor this story. ;) \"Wherenare we?\" Storm whinnied. Hidalgo looked at the vast, empty spacenbefore them. It was desolate and looked unforgiving. \"I'm notnsure…\" He cautiously kept on moving forward, all his instinctsnalert and ready for anything to happen. Storm followed him, every bitnas keen with her senses. She wasn't sure why, but she felt a lotnsafer with Hidalgo now than she had been the day before. He seemednmore… \"I know where we are.\" Hidalgo's grim whicker arousednStorm from her reverie. Hidalgonwasn't sure why he couldn't remember before, but suddenlynmemories of the past rushed through his mind, and he realized wherenhe was. \"We're in a desert…\" Storm sighed at thenconformation. \"That means there's no water near by…\" Hidalgonnodded agreement. \"I'm not sure if we should turn back or edgenaround the desert.\" \"Maybenwe'll luck out and find an oasis.\" Storm suggested. Hidalgo shooknhis mane. \"I don't scent any water very close though…but if wengo around the desert there's a chance that there might be a pool.\"nStorm's eyes darted to her right where a small mammal was dashingninto the distance. An idea sparked, \"Follow that animal! It'llnlead us to water!\" Hidalgo neighed agreement, \"Good thinking!\"nthen both horses took off after the small rabbit, who thought he wasnbeing chased and wasn't sure what was going on. Storm'snidea was correct. Eventually the rabbit led them around the desertnand a large watering pool greeted them. Hidalgo sunk his muzzle deepninto the coolness. Beside him Storm effortly lowered her neck andndrank the refreshing gift. After a long drink Hidalgo finally raisednhis head and moved a few paces away. His stallion instincts told himnto watch for a predator that could attack in Storm's vulnerablendrinking position. Along the horizon he could see trees. It was thenfirst vegetation he had since leaving the forest where the blacknstallion had met his doom. Henturned back around to see Storm raising her head in satisfaction,nwater drops dripping from her muzzle. He nickered to her. Storm shooknher coat and then she waded out into the pool of water and lay down.nHidalgo watched amused. He was tempted to join her, but he had tonwatch for enemies. Finally he decided they were safe enough andntrotted over into the water and pawed playfully at it. He lowered hisnheated body into the coolness and rolled. When he stepped out of thenwater he felt perfectly rejuvenated. Storm got up, shook the waternfor coat, and walked out of the pool as well. \"Inthink we should head for those trees.\" Hidalgo neighed. Stormnlooked over towards the trees and nodded, \"Alright.\" Instead ofntaking the lead like she usually did, Storm stood and waited fornHidalgo to start. He was slightly surprised but did not hesitate tonlead the way. Storm's attitude towards him had definitely changednsince their first encounter. Hidalgo liked it. Bynthe time they made it to the trees, which happened to be a forest,nthe sun was sinking below the horizon and darkness was streakingnacross the sky. The shade of the forest was cool and inviting,nproviding shelter from the dangers of night. Hidalgo cautiouslyncreeped into the forest, looking around for anything suspicious. Henhadn't caught another horse's scent, so it seemed safe enough.nStorm followed him, quite relaxed, and Hidalgo decided to deem thenforest safe. \"Thisnlooks nice enough.\" Storm nodded and lay down on the grass coverednforest ground. Hidalgo watched her, and then lowered his head so thatnhe could assume his sleeping position. He didn't dream that night,nbut it was a peaceful sleep, the one he slept. When sunlight made hisneyes flicker open Storm was gone. \"Storm?\" He gave a horse yawnnand tossed his mane lazily. He walked through the part of the forestnthey had recently come through and back out into the openness. Stormnwas drinking from the watering pool. Hidalgonsighed, relieved that nothing bad had happened. He started forwardnand then a strange scent entered his sensitive nostrils. He'd nevernsmelt this scent before. But it seemed like he should know what itnwas naturally. He shifted through his instincts, trying to classifynthis scent as hard as he could. Storm looked over at, simplynacknowledging that she noticed he was awake. Then it hit him. Hensuddenly knew what the scent was. It was coming from Storm; she wasnin heat.[Chapter 5] A/N:nDidn't think I'd update so soon? XD -/-/-/-Hidalgo-/-/-/- Thenstallion walked calmly over to the water pool and drank after dippingnhis muzzle in alertly. Storm eyed him as if expecting him to suddenlynturn on her for no reason; but Hidalgo ignored that look. Instead henlifted his head after a well deserved drink and flared his nostrils.nAnother new scent was coming from the distance, and it wasnapproaching quickly. The sound of pounding hoofbeats made the twonhorses flick their ears uneasily. Perhaps the other horses were justncoming for a drink; Hidalgo was sure he couldn't catch a herd'snscent when he and Storm found the pool. NownHidalgo could make out horses on the horizon. They were gallopingnfull speed straight towards the water pool; but Hidalgo and Stormnjust stood still, ears pricked and eyes locked on the newcomers. Therenwere only five horses Hidalgo soon discovered, and they were allnmares. He couldn't scent a stallion anywhere close; so what were anbunch of mares doing on the outskirts of a desert? Mares always had anstallion to protect them, no matter what. Hidalgo felt more confidentnknowing it was just a group of mares without a stallion. He neighed angreeting and pawed the ground beside the pool. One of the maresnreturned the greeting with a loud whinny that sounded welcoming.nStorm uncomfortably stepped back as the five new mares finally madenit to the water pool. Thenmare who had replied to Hidalgo's greeting stepped forward. Hidalgondecided she was their lead mare most likely and nickered. The marensmiled, \"What brings you to the Drinking Place?\" Hidalgo thoughtnthe reason seemed pretty obvious. \"My friend and I just travelednaround the desert yesterday. We spent the night in the forest and nownwe're thirsty.\" The mare nodded and looked longingly at thenwater. Hidalgo wanted to ask one more question before allowing themnto drink though. \"Whatnare you mares doing without a stallion?\" The mare lowered her gaze.n\"Our stallion was killed a few days ago. We had been traveling farnso that we could drink. When he died I had to keep on leading thenmares. Now we're here.\" Hidalgo glanced at Storm who faintlynnodded and he stepped aside. The mares thankfully stepped closer tonthe pool and sipped the cool water. Hidalgo and Storm walked a fewnpaces away to talk. \"Arenyou going to invite them to stay?\" Storm asked quietly. Hidalgonreplied, \"Yes. It's dangerous for them to be out on their ownnwithout a stallion.\" Storm grumbled, \"Never stopped me.\"nHidalgo rolled his eyes, \"You had me, for however short the amountnof time that was.\" Storm retorted quickly, \"I didn't want you to join me.\" Hidalgo stepped closer and looked her straightnin the eyes. \"But you let me anyways.\" Storm starred back,ntrying to think of another retort, yet at the same time transfixed innHidalgo's gaze. \"Um…\"nHidalgo turned to see the lead mare walking towards him. \"Yes?\"nThe lead mare smiled wearily from her travel. \"I was wondering ifnyou might like to lead our herd…we have no where else to go andnnothing to do with our lives.\" Hidalgo let a smile play at hisnmuzzle, \"I was about to ask you if you wanted to stay here. Sonsure, I'll lead your herd.\" The mare's smile grew wider inngratitude, \"Thank you…uh, what's your name?\" Hidalgo toldnher. The mare nodded, \"I'm Shadow.\" Hidalgo thought it suitednher dark colored coat. Shadow continued, \"And the other mares arenPetal, Sand, Willow, and Berry.\" Hidalgo noticed that Berry was anfar amount younger than the other four mares. She was a red roan withna white blaze that made her eyes seem to glow happily despite thenhardship her family had just gone through. -/-/-/-Storm-/-/-/- Eachnof the mares thanked Hidalgo for the hospitality and settled downninside the forest to graze. Hidalgo stayed out by the pool while theynrested. Storm followed the mares somewhat miserably. She edged awaynfrom them and meagerly munched on bits of grass and underbrush. Shenfelt her jealousy levels rising as the mares became more comfortablenand started talking about the Drinking Place and the forest. Now shenwould have no chance to deepen her relationship with Hidalgo. Henwould become more interested in the more cooperative mares that hadnjust arrived. He would probably make Shadow the lead mare because shenalready was the mares' lead mare and since Storm was injured. Shensighed. Her injury was causing her more trouble than she ever knew itncould. Afternthe sun had reached its highest point and started to lower againnStorm decided to leave the forest and go to get a drink. Willownpassed her on her way and gave her a smile. Storm ignored the gesturenand kept on limping. Beside the pool she easily took a long drink andnfelt herself cool off. \"Arenyou alright?\" Storm sighed, again, when she heard Hidalgo'snvoice, somewhat concerned. \"Never better.\" She replied. Hidalgoneyed her suspiciously. \"I'm serious you know.\" Storm nodded.nHidalgo stepped closer, since he was a full three horse lengths awaynfrom her, and looked at her worriedly. \"Something's botheringnyou.\" Storm rolled her eyes, \"Possibly.\" Hidalgo sighed. \"Comenone Storm, you can tell me anything.\" Storm met his gaze for thenfirst time since they had begun talking, yet no words came out of hernmouth. Hidalgo thought for a minute. \"If it's about those mares…\"nStorm quietly said, \"Sort of…\" Hidalgo smiled. \"C'mon,nthey're just a bunch of mares. No one is going to…\" he madensure she was actually listening before continuing, \"…to comenbetween us.\" Stormnwas silently amazed at how smart Hidalgo was. He really understoodnwhat was on her mind. They had gotten closer than she realized duringntheir journey. It was nice to know someone finally understood her,nsomeone who she didn't mind being around at that. \"Are you sure?\"nHidalgo nodded. \"Now come here!\" She laughed as Hidalgo huggednher neck (horse style, XD). -/-/-/-AnFew Years Later-/-/-/- Thingsnwere going smoothly with Hidalgo's new herd. Willow and Petal eachnhad yearlings with them while Sand had a small foal and Berry wasnexpecting along with Storm. Willow's yearling, Flame, was a coltnwho was already showing signs of dominance, and Petal's yearlingnwas a filly, Breeze, who was shyer than her half brother, but veryncurious about her surroundings. Flame and Breeze usually hung outntogether by the Drinking Place and munched on small grasses while thenmares were content with the shade of the forest. Sand's foal,nDrift, who was a colt, stayed near his mother since he was only a fewndays old. Onnthis particular day Berry was returning from foaling and a smallnfilly was at her side. Hidalgo appeared from out of the desert, wherenhe usually patrolled for intruders or predators. He greeted Berry'snfilly excitedly and after an inspection he found that she wasn'tnsick or injured. Berry rejoined the mares with the filly and Hidalgondecided to check on Storm; she was due to foal any day now. Henwalked over to Shadow who was busy making sure the mares werencontent. \"Where's Storm?\" He nickered. Shadow turned around andnsmiled. \"She left last night.\" Hidalgo grinned, \"So is she backnyet?\" Shadow shook her head. For an instance worry overtooknHidalgo, until he remembered how strong and outgoing Storm was andndecided she was probably alright. Unless something happened to thenfoal… Hidalgonwandered back to the water pool and decided to go and search fornStorm; just to be on the safe side. He galloped out across the desertnand stayed alert for her scent. Eventually he locked onto it andnfollowed it. It led to the right of where the forest and the poolnwere, straight into the desert. Hidalgo recognized where he was fromnhis many patrols, but he wondered how Storm knew where she was going.nThen he remembered that there was an oasis not far off, and that wasnmost likely where she had gone. He took off at an even faster pacenthan he'd used in the Ocean of Fire towards the oasis. Hisnhooves finally took him where he wanted to go and he realized thatnStorm's scent was stronger than ever. The oasis was rather empty.nIt was usually crawling with critters dying of thirst from being innthe heat too long. Hidalgo took a sip of water just because it wasnavailable and followed Storm's scent. It stopped abruptly at thenother side of the water. Hidalgo stopped, stumped. He turned aroundnand looked for Storm but saw nothing. \"Wellnlook who showed up for the party.\" Hidalgo jumped around and wasnrelieved when it was only Storm. Better than that, it was Storm andnher newborn. Hidalgo smiled excitedly. \"I was just making sure younwere okay.\" Storm sighed, thought not annoyed. \"Always worrying.\"nHidalgo quickly pointed out, \"Well you left last night and it'snthe middle of the day. I'd think you'd be home by now.\" Stormngrinned. \"Yeah…I got kinda sidetracked…this oasis is so nicenand secluded.\" The foal whinnied in a high pitch squeal and prancednforward only to stop suddenly upon seeing Hidalgo and look on innwonder. Hidalgonstepped closer and gave the foal a once-over. \"She's a perfectlynhealthy filly.\" Storm rolled her eyes. \"I would have nevernguessed.\" Hidalgo shrugged and Storm trotted on past him with thenfilly close behind. \"Well, are you coming or not?\" She neighed.nHidalgo laughed and galloped past her and the foal. Whennthe three made it back to herd Storm told Hidalgo what she had namednthe foal: Wave. Storm and Wave rejoined the mares after getting somenwater after their run, and Hidalgo took off into the desert, to runnand be free just like Frank T. Hopkins had wanted when he set Hidalgonloose. Atnthat moment Hidalgo most likely could have never felt better. He hadna family, a home, and most importantly, he was free. Free to live outnhis life however he pleased; and so far things had been going justnabout perfect. ","Summary":" Hidalgonlooked back over his shoulder one last time at Frank.

Thomson just laughed good-naturedly, and it was then that the sheriff realized that Thomson was actually 24 by now and - having been married for a few months - was now plenty old enough to have a couple of kids. \"Yeah, feels like it,\" Thomson admitted, glancing self-consciously down at his shoes. \"Nah,\" Brandon came around his desk and slapped the young man on the shoulder. \"You're doing fine with that little girl of yours, and you'll do fine with the one that's coming. You've got too big of a support system for any of them to ever let you mess up even if you tried.\" Thomson nodded, apparently encouraged as a smile tilted the corners of his mouth upwards. \"Yeah, I do.\" With that, Brandon showed the young deputy to the door of his office. Once Thomson left, the sheriff stood unobserved in one corner of the muster room as Thomson approached Brock Kelly and Bobby Shaw.

A lamp was turned on. A yawn was stifled. The phone was answered. \"You're late, mate.\" \"It was your turn to call.\" \"No, it wasn't.\" \"Whatever.\" \"Dino.\" \"I mean whatever, Ter,\" Dino groused as he kicked off his shoes. He sprawled across his suddenly too big bed. \"What's wrong?\" Terry gently inquired as he sat up in bed and looked at the clock. It read 5 am, which meant it was midnight in New York. \"I had a shitty day. \"Wanna tell me about it?\" \"I would rather you were here,\" Dino replied. He closed his eyes hoping that would ease the ache in his head. \"Migraine?\" Terry hazarded. He heard the pain in his lover's voice. In his mind's eye, he could see Dino's eyes closed and lips pressed together as the redhead fought the pain that pounded unceasingly thru his head. \"Yeah.\" \"I wish I could be there to make it go away.\" \"That's a nice thought,\" Dino murmured. They lapsed into a companionable silence. They were just content to listen to each other breathe. After a bit, Dino asked, \"Ter?\" \"Hmm?\" \"You wouldn't happen to know a Scottish engineer named Montgomery Scott?\" \"The pain meds must be kicking in,\" Terry observed with a wry chuckle. \"Not really,\" Dino retorted dryly. \"I'm just trying to think of things to keep my mind occupied so I don't put my fist through the wall.\" Terry wanted to tease the redhead, but he could hear more than just pain in his lover's voice. He heard longing and it plucked at his heartstrings. \"I miss you, too.\" \"So whose turn is it?\" Dino forced himself to get up and go into the bathroom to take the medication that would put a stop to the pain radiating through his hard head. \"Yours.\" \"I was in London last month,\" Dino reminded the brunette. \"And I had to go to Paris to keep Rollie out of trouble,\" Terry sighed. He slipped out of bed and padded into the kitchen. He snagged a bottle of water out of the refrigerator. \"It wasn't necessary,\" Dino observed. He slowly made his way from his bedroom to the kitchen hoping a glass of milk wouldn't upset his queasy stomach. He hated getting migraines, but mainly he hated being sick period. \"Rollie's a big boy.\" \"Who was on the prowl,\" Terry countered. \"Point taken,\" Dino said between sips from the milk jug. \"You better eat some crackers with that, luv.\" \"You are freaky, you know that?\" Dino replied. He pulled a box of graham crackers from the cabinet over the sink. He pulled out an opened pack and bit into a cracker. \"That's why you love me.\" \"Is it?\" Terry didn't rise to the bait. Instead, he listened to the redhead move around his small kitchen. This in turn made the brunette peckish, so he gave up the idea of returning to bed after the call was over. \"Ter?\" \"Yes?\" \"If I concede and agree it's my turn to come visit you, will you consider a change of venue?\" Dino inquired. He put away the box of crackers and tossed the empty milk jug in the trash. He slowly made his way back to his bedroom feeling the pain medication finally kick in. \"What do you have in mind?\" \"We meet halfway,' Dino suggested. \"Madeira?\" \"Madeira,\" Dino replied. \"It's been awhile and I could use some sunshine.\" Terry smiled. He liked Madeira. The people were friendly, and Dino always seemed more relaxed there. \"I'll make the arrangements and we meet in Lisbon.\" Dino yawned. \"Sounds good.\" \"Get some sleep, luv,\" Terry quietly commanded. \"Yes, sir,\" Dino said sarcastically. \"Keep sassing me and you'll be suitably punished,\" Terry warned glad that Dino couldn't see the sly grin his lips had twisted into. \"Looking forward to it,\" Dino retorted. He knew that Terry was smirking, and that was the first good thing to happen to him all day. He yawned again. \"Dino,\" Terry gently admonished. \"I'm going, I'm going,\" Dino muttered as he slid into bed pulling the covers tight around him. Terry didn't respond. He listened to the redhead's movements as the other man slipped into bed. He couldn't wait to get Dino all to himself so he could spoil the redhead.

Un petit OS sur la relation Alice/Terry. Le titre provient de la version française \"Juste pour une nuit\" de la chanson de Mariah Carey \"My all\". Bonne lecture ! Une tasse de café chaud entre les mains, Alice s'appuya contre le montant de la porte, ouverte, de la chambre d'amis. Terry s'y trouvait, dos à elle, affairé à plier ses vêtements dans sa valise. Demain, il ramènerait Peter à Alice, sain et sauf, puis il partirait. Loin. Dans les sud, pour une retraite au soleil. Ou peut-être en France. Un bruissement de tissus lui indiqua l'arrivée de la jeune femme. Les pensées brouillées par les mois de cohabitation, il ne se retourna pas. Il avait fait l'erreur du débutant. Il s'était attaché à sa cliente. Pire, il en était tombé amoureux et il irait sauver son mari au petit matin. A cette pensée, il poussa un soupir et ses épaules s'affaissèrent légèrement. Il la sentit alors s'avancer dans la pièce, tout près de lui. Elle passa une main dans son dos dans un geste de soutient mais la proximité de la jeune femme le rendait fou. Ses boucles blondes, ses iris bleus, ses courbes féminines sous ses marcels difformes… Il secoua la tête pour chasser toutes ces idées. Il allait payer le prix amer de son erreur. - Vous êtes nerveux ? demanda doucement Alice. - J'espère que tous ces mois de négociations n'auront pas été vains. - Mais il est en vie, vous l'avez dit vous-même ! - Oui. Et je vous promets de vous le ramener, Alice. Elle hocha alors la tête avant de porter délicatement le liquide bouillant à ses lèvres. - Je suis sûre que tout ira bien. J'ai confiance en vous, déclara-t-elle avec conviction. Oui, elle croyait en lui. Elle savait qu'il sauverait Peter. La force dans la voix de la jeune femme troubla Terry. La confiance qu'elle avait en lui le touchait. Emu, il en oublia ce qu'il faisait, si bien qu'il se coupa le doigt en voulant fermer sa valise. Il grogna de douleur alors qu'Alice se précipitait déjà à la salle de bain. Elle revint quelques secondes plus tard avec la trousse de premiers secours. - Il faut soigner ça ! ordonna-t-elle. Asseyez-vous ici ! Elle indiqua le lit qu'elle venait de débarrasser de la valise. - Ce n'est qu'une égratignure, protesta Terry. - Vous ne pouvez pas partir au combat avec une blessure, rétorqua fermement Alice. Ne voulant pas la fâcher, il s'assit au bord du lit tandis qu'elle fouillait dans la trousse. Armée d'un désinfectant et de sparadrap, Alice se tint debout devant lui. - Donnez-moi votre main, demanda-t-elle alors avec plus de douceur. Terry s'exécuta cette fois-ci sans broncher et glissa ses doigts dans la paume ouverte de la jeune femme. Le contact de leurs deux peaux l'électrisa, pourtant il n'en montra rien. - Ca va piquer un peu, le prévint-elle avant d'asperger le doigt blessé de désinfectant. Pendant qu'elle épongeait le liquide et le sang à l'aide de coton, Alice l'observa discrètement et sourit en voyant sa mâchoire se crisper. Il avait le regard fixé sur chacun de ses gestes, comme s'il examinait tout ce qu'elle faisait. Ses traits étaient tirés par la fatigue et le stress accumulés mais elle le trouva pourtant terriblement attirant dans la lumière tamisée de la chambre. Choquée de ses propres pensées, Alice s'empressa de couvrir le doigt de Terry d'un petit pansement puis annonça, semblant le tirer de ses rêveries : - Voilà, j'ai terminé. Elle allait lui rendre sa main lorsque les doigts de l'homme enserrèrent la sienne. Elle baissa alors des yeux interrogatifs vers lui, toujours assis sur le lit, et la façon dont il la dévisageait la dérouta. Etait-ce du désir qu'elle pouvant lire dans le fond de son regard ? Sa main toujours prisonnière, une vague de chaleur s'empara d'elle et son cœur se mit à battre plus fort. Mais que lui arrivait-il ? Pour tenter de calmer son cœur qui s'emballait, elle ferma les yeux et inspira profondément. Non, elle ne pouvait pas. Demain, Peter serait là. Demain, Terry partirait. - Alice. La voix rauque la fit frémir plus qu'elle ne l'aurait voulu. Malgré elle, elle ouvrit les yeux pour les planter dans les prunelles grises de l'homme. Incapable de faire un geste, elle le suivit simplement du regard quand il se releva, lui faisant face de toute sa hauteur. Ils restèrent ainsi un long moment sans parler, main dans la main. Puis soudain, il porta sa main libre à la joue de la jeune femme. Sous la caresse, elle ferma à nouveau les paupières, profitant de cet instant de tendresse. Elle n'avait plus connu de moments pareils depuis longtemps. Alors la main glissa sur sa nuque et il lui frôla les lèvres. Ce contact inattendu paralysa Alice, qui ne sut comment réagir. Elle sentait le souffle chaud de l'homme sur son visage et elle se surprit à attendre. Allait-il l'embrasser ? N'osant pas ouvrir les yeux pour ne pas briser cette plénitude qui s'emparait d'elle, elle sentit des lèvres se poser délicatement sur les siennes en une étreinte fragile. Ils avaient partagé tellement de choses, tellement d'émotions fortes en si peu de temps. Les sentiments qu'elle éprouvait pour lui étaient confus, mais ce dont elle était sûre c'est qu'elle tenait beaucoup à lui. Terry rompit le baiser et posa son front contre celui de la femme qu'il aimait. Il soupira en pensant qu'il lui avait donné un baiser d'adieu. Alice réalisa brutalement que si Peter revenait demain, plus jamais elle ne reverrait Terry. Il était devenu si important dans sa vie en l'espace de quelques mois qu'elle ne pouvait se résoudre à l'idée de le perdre. Une larme roula alors sur sa joue mais Terry l'effaça bien vite de son pouce. - Alice. Ne pleures pas, je t'en prie. C'est peut-être mieux ainsi, fit-il comme s'il avait lu dans ses pensées, passant naturellement au tutoiement. - Qu'en sais-tu ? rétorqua-t-elle avec fougue, les yeux noyés de larmes. - Pense à Peter. - Je pense à lui chaque seconde ! Mais toi… - Non, ne dis rien. Ne dis rien que tu pourrais regretter, dit-il en plaquant son index sur les lèvres d'Alice. Il se détourna alors et sortit de la chambre, la laissant seule et perdue. Mais Alice se reprit bien vite. Elle ne pouvait pas le laisser partir comme ça. Elle se précipita hors de la chambre pour le voir à l'autre bout du couloir. Elle l'appela, il s'arrêta net. Elle courut vers lui, il ne se retourna pas. D'un geste presque rageur, elle l'obligea à lui faire face mais resta muette devant son expression. Elle pouvait lire la souffrance dans son regard. - Ne rends pas les choses plus compliquées, Alice, la supplia-t-il presque. - Et si ce n'était pas si compliqué ? s'entêta-t-elle. Son air rebelle le fit sourire. Cette femme avait un sacré caractère et elle savait ce qu'elle voulait. Mais Terry ne se laissa pas convaincre, se forçant à garder toute sa raison. - Tout ce qu'on a vécu, Terry… dit-elle en prenant le poing fermé de l'homme dans sa main. - Laisse-moi t'oublier. - Non Terry. Emmène le souvenir de moi avec toi, et laisse-moi emmener le tien. - Alice, on ne peut pas ! - Tu préfères passer le restant de ta vie frustré, à te demander « et si » ? Terry ne répondit pas, en proie à un conflit intérieur. Elle vit sa mâchoire se contracter alors et, dans un geste tendre, elle l'effleura de ses lèvres. Dans la main d'Alice, le poing de l'homme se serra. Si elle continuait, il allait perdre la raison et toutes les bonnes résolutions qu'il avait prises en quittant la chambre. Alors qu'il se concentrait pour ne pas perdre pied, la bouche d'Alice rencontra la sienne dans un baiser timide auquel il ne répondit pas. Pourtant, sa volonté faiblissait à mesure qu'elle mettait plus d'ardeur à son baiser. Et lorsqu'elle se serra contre lui, il capitula et se laissa emporter par son désir. Il la saisit alors par la taille et l'embrassa passionnément. Quand, à bout de souffle, ils se séparèrent, Terry prit conscience de ce que son geste pouvait impliquer. Dans un dernier élan de raison, il se résolu à mettre fin à tout ça avant d'atteindre le point de non-retour. Il ouvrit la bouche pour expliquer à Alice que ce n'était pas possible mais le seul mot qu'il parvint à prononcer fut le prénom de la jeune femme. - Alice, souffla-t-il. - Viens, murmura-t-elle simplement en le prenant par la main. Ses dernières résistances l'abandonnèrent lorsqu'elle le mena à la chambre d'amis et qu'elle ferma la porte derrière lui. Seilana ","Summary":" Juste pour une nuit.

A freak accident in dry dock left him with a broken leg and unable to finish the repairs on his beloved ketch, The Music . His long fingered hands rested on the chair to steady himself since he had left his cane in the kitchen. Terry would tut at him for it, but he was tired of being encumbered by the fashionable stick of wood. He longed to be on his ketch sailing off to distant lands. He heard Terry come into the room. He felt a pair of arms slip around his waist as he was pulled back against a hard chest. A soft kiss was placed on his temple just as the breeze from the open window blew the lazy white curtains aside giving Dino the perfect view of the beach. Dino's heart swelled in his chest as he saw his ketch whole once again anchored off shore. It meant his time with Terry was ending, and although that saddened him, he was happy to have his freedom back. \"She's finished,\" Terry said \"Thank you,\" Dino said as he turned in Terry's arms and drew his mouth down for a kiss.

Dino stood on the beach watching the tide coming in yearning to be at sea again. He hated that his love of the sea hurt his lover, but Terry knew he could never be content to live on the land. The land held too many people with too many problems that he didn't have a snowflake's chance in hell of understanding let alone fixing. The sea…. The sea he understood. Her dangerous beauty called to the darkest part of his soul. She had unveiled her mysteries to him. She owned all of him except for a tiny piece that he had given to Terry years before. &/&/& Now I'm bound for the heart of the ocean I'm riding the sea in my soul In the dark and the deep She will rock me to sleep Down below... where the black waters roll Dino cupped Terry's cheek. \"I have to go.\" \"I know,\" Terry whispered. He didn't bother to hide the tears that gathered in the corners of his eyes. \"I will be back,\" Dino promised. He leaned forward and placed a soft kiss on the Australian's lips. Terry returned the kiss fighting to keep it a chaste farewell kiss. Dino gave him a watery smile and said, \"I love you.\" Terry nodded. He couldn't trust himself to say anything for fear that he would beg Dino to stay. Dino understood. He turned and walked toward the dinghy that would take him out to his ship. &/&/& I can still hear your voice on the trade winds I can still taste your tears on the foam But the lure of the tide that I'm feeling inside Will not rest till my heart finds its home Terry crumpled the letter and threw it away from himself as if the act would negate Dino's final words.

Moira was a dark haired beauty just like her mother for which Dino was eternally grateful for. She had decided to make her appearance early, and this had caused Rowie to remark in a sarcastic fashion during labor that Moira was very much her father's daughter. They had laughed about it afterwards, but Dino suspected it was a cover for Rowie's amusement at seeing him go all soft over Moira. He couldn't help himself. It was love at first sight. He sighed. Rowie opened her eyes and looked up at him. Her hazel eyes sparkling with the love she felt for him and their daughter. \"Wanna join us?\" \"Thought you would never ask,\" he teased as he walked toward the bed. Rowie smiled.

Dino stood in the middle of the jungle in his fatigues and holding his assault rifle. All around him were the sounds of explosions and screaming. He could see huge clouds of smoke and flames shooting up high in the sky. He looked up and saw the Sikorsky overhead. He smiled. Everything was going as planned. This sort of action always got him excited and worked up. His eyes darted around his surrounding looking for anything out of place. His men were stationed around the area but he knew he wouldn't actually see them, not if they were doing their jobs properly anyway. Then he heard a faint rustling sound off to his left, barely noticeable over the thundering sound of the huge helicopter overhead. He immediately dropped down to a crouch and cocked his weapon pointing it in the direction of the sound. A moment later Terry came crashing through the brush dragging someone with him. He came face to face with Dino's riffle but didn't stop. \"Not alone,\" he yelled as he darted past. It took Dino a split second to realize what Terry meant. Suddenly twenty men in camouflage came piling through the tree line all brandishing weapons. \"Oh, fuck,\" Dino yelled as he opened up and began firing, spraying the tree line with bullets as he backed away. Several of the men fell to the ground immediately, others darted back into the cover of the forest. Dino kept firing as he backed his way toward the clearing where he knew the helicopter was going to pick them up. He couldn't see where he was going but he had to keep firing or risk getting shot himself. He could hear the helicopter behind him and just kept moving in the direction of the sound. When he felt the wind generated by the big bird's propellers, he abandoned his assault and leapt into the cabin just as the thing was taking off. Down below men were firing up at the helicopter, the occasional ping of a bullet hitting metal ringing in his ears. His heart was racing as Terry pulled him further into the cabin and away from danger. He was having trouble catching his breath. He'd come just moments away from being killed, yet again. Dino smiled again. He loved his work.

I had to shift in my seat to ease the pressure on a certain part of my anatomy. She had this Miss Prim and Proper Look going on that was more of a turn on than if she had pranced around the office buck naked. The she, you ask… Rowena McGee. Rowie, for short. She has haunted my dreams and my waking hours ever since Terry had hired her as my personal assistant. She was good at her job. She was a pro when it came to the Game. In fact, my last two assignments were cake walks because she knew what I needed, when I needed it and where I needed it. It was spooky to have somebody that good at reading my thoughts working beside me on a daily basis. I was forced to toss my pen on the desk in resignation. I needed to get some air before I went and did something incredibly stupid. &/&/& I returned an hour later still conflicted and horny as hell.

I pulled her toward me joining her in her slow dance. \"How's this gonna go, Rowie?\" I asked her. \"Hard and fast or slow and easy?\" \"What makes you think I'm going to have sex with you?\" she countered. \"It's inevitable,\" I whispered in her ear as I grounded our hips together. \"I want you and you want me.\" \"I see.\" There you go, midnight promises again, yeah But they're broken by the dawn You wanna go further, faster everyday, baby But in the morning you'll be gone And I'm alone I slipped my hands under her blouse causing her breath to hitch in her throat. I cupped her breasts and teased her nipples erect through the silky fabric of her bra. \"This could be considered sexual harassment,\" she said trying to be the voice of reason even though her voice was filled with need. \"Oh…\" I breathed into the shell of her ear. \"Really? How interesting?\" I trailed wet kisses along her neck and then had blown on them to cause her to shiver. We never stopped our dance. Why save your kisses for a rainy day Baby let the moment take your heart away Have you ever needed someone so bad, yeah Have you ever wanted someone you just couldn't have Did you ever try so hard that your world just fell apart Have you ever needed someone so bad I dropped my hands to her hips again and turned her around to face me. Her green eyes had been glazed over with lust. I leaned in and took her lips in a soft, exploring kiss. I felt her arms encircle my neck and her slim hands slip into my hair.

It was an interesting mix, and Terry found that he was surprised that Dino knew half the groups he included on the CD. \"What you doing?\" Dino asked as he strolled into the room with two cold beers in his hand. \"Looking through the songs you gave me,\" Terry honestly answered. \"Surprised you, didn't I?\" \"You did. I thought your musical tastes lied mainly with Jazz and the Blues.\" \"Since meeting you, I've learned to branch out.\" Dino handed Terry one of the beers before settling in the chair next to his lover. Terry chuckled when a familiar song caught his eye. \"Do I want to know?\" \"If you were to describe me with a song, what would it be?\" Terry inquired with curiosity shining in his hazel eyes. Dino tilted his head and studied the Aussie. He ran through the catalog of songs he kept in his head like most people kept useless trivia. \"Ain't That A Kick In The Head by Dean Martin,\" he finally answered. Terry rolled his eyes. \"It had to be a Dean Martin song,\" he teased. \"Watch it, pal,\" Dino growled in warning. \"My mom loved Dino.\" \"I bet you're glad she got over her crush on Spencer Tracy,\" Terry countered not afraid of his lover's growl. Dino shuddered. \"I don't know what it is with the females in my family naming their offspring after famous people. I feel sorry for my cousin, H.\" \"H?\" \"My aunt named him Horatio after Horatio Alger,\" the redhead explained before taking a swig from his beer. \"I thought Terrence was bad,\" Terry grumbled. \"I think it's kinda sexy.\" \"You would.\" \"So what song do you have in mind for me?\" Dino asked. His curiosity had been aroused. \"TNT by AC/DC,\" Terry replied with a grin. \"Dynamite?\" Dino regarded his lover with a raised eyebrow. \"As in dynamite sex?\" \"It's always sex with you.\" \"Hello. I'm a guy,\" Dino snarked. Terry slid an arm around Dino's shoulders and drew him into a soft, exploring kiss. \"I'm well aware of that fact.\" His other hand came up and began to caress the obvious bulge in the other man's jeans.

The party upstairs was still in full swing and many of the revelers hadn't realized that the guest of honor had gone AWOL. He spotted her at the bar where a sorry excuse of a businessman was trying to pick her up. Sensing that this would be good entertainment, he sauntered into the room and over to the bar. He found a seat near Jessie and watched her at work. Jessie was tired. It was her birthday and her dear friends had thrown her a party, but all she wanted to do was crawl under a rock and forget about it. She took a sip from her glass of wine and studied the room in the long mirror behind the bar. It was a slow night, which meant the land sharks were out and about. Off to her right sat a sad looking businessman, so Jessie waited for the inevitable. \"Can I buy you a drink?\" inquired the businessman. \"I have one already,\" Jessie replied in mild rebuke. She gave the man a quick once over not terribly impressed by what she was seeing. \"Can I buy you another one?\" the businessman persisted. \"May you?\" Jessie said, correcting the man's grammar. \"May I?\" \"No,\" Jessie replied. \"Why not?\" \"Because I refuse to lower my standards to raise your self-esteem,\" Jessie said with a hint of snark in her tone. She hated being hit on, especially by married men. \"Bitch!\" the guy snapped. \"Thank you,\" Jessie said with a cool smile. \"Now, be a good boy and piss off.\" The businessman made a nasty face and then took himself off to harass another woman further down the bar. \"That wasn't very nice,\" Dino whispered in Jessie's ear. \"I'm not in the mood to be nice,\" Jessie retorted. \"Good neither am I,\" Dino countered. \"Your room?\" \"Only if I you'll let me buy you another drink,\" Dino said as he slipped onto the stool next to Jessie. \"You're on,\" Jessie told him with a warm smile.

He pulled a 45 from the pile lying next to it and slipped it onto the spindle. He may not have been able to dance with his lover at the party earlier but there was nothing to stop him from doing it now. As the record crackled to life, he held his hand out to Dino and smiled. Dino smiled back and gave Terry his hand allowing himself to be pulled to his feet and into Terry's arms. Somewhere beyond the sea Somewhere waitin' for me Terry rested his forehead against Dino's as he started leading them around the living room floor and humming the melody. He still regretted not being able to do this earlier in front of the world. My lover stands on golden sands And watches the ships that go sailin'. He locked eyes with the redhead and began singing along with the next verse making the appropriate changes to the lyrics. Somewhere beyond the sea He's there watchin' for me Dino chuckled and allowed Terry to spin him out then back in again as he listened to him sing. If I could fly like birds on high Then straight to his arms I'd go sailin'. Dino laid his head on Terry's shoulder as strong arms encircled him. They swayed to the music and as the redhead's mood lifted his smile broadened and his eyes drifted shut. It's far beyond the stars It's near beyond the moon I know beyond a doubt My heart will lead me there soon. Dino pulled back enough to gaze up into Terry's eyes. Everything he needed to know was right there. Terry leaned down and brushed his lips against the redhead's, gently at first.

The waterfall thundered below him, its misty clouds rising from the ground and covering him in a fine sheen of river water. He was standing at the abyss, both figuratively and literally.

An image of his lover flashed behind his closed lids and his world brightened just a touch as he felt the hairs at the back of his neck stand up. He smirked. Terry stood frozen in place staring at his lover. He was afraid to come any closer for fear of startling the redhead and causing him to fall. His heart was pounding in his chest. He wouldn't really do it, would he? Carefully he made a small sound but got no outward reaction from the other man. He decided to chance it. \"What are ya doin', mate?\" he asked carefully. Dino laughed. It was a harsh sound that echoed out through the canyon. \"Would ya miss me?\" he yelled back over the sound of the waterfall without changing his position. Terry took a tentative step closer. He held out a hand. \"Come back from there. Before you hurt yourself,\" he said as calmly as he was able.

Dino rolled over in bed and watched his lover for a few moments. Terry was sleeping peacefully with a small smile on his face. Dino smirked knowing that he had been the one to put that smile there just few hours before. He sighed and rolled onto his back staring at the ceiling. He wished he could be as content as Terry had been the past few weeks but he was becoming restless. It had been almost two months since their last job and sitting around the house all day with basically nothing to do but be domestic was eating at his nerves. He carefully rolled out of bed being careful not to wake Terry and groped around in the dark room for his pants. Terry reached out a few minutes later and found the bed empty. His eyes drifted open and he rolled to his side. Dino wasn't there. He sat up in bed and looked around. He knew his lover had been getting restless of late and he'd been surprised that the redhead had stuck around for as long as he had. He wandered out into the house and was surprised to find Dino sitting out on the back porch. He was certain he'd taken off again. Terry stepped out onto the porch and took a seat next to his lover. \"You're still here, mate?\" he asked. Dino looked over at him with a sad smile. \"Not for much longer,\" he said. Terry nodded. He understood his partner's restlessness and his need to be on the move but he didn't want him to leave. Or maybe he didn't want to leave him. A thought struck Terry then. \"How 'bout we go to Brazil? You and me.\" Dino's face broke into a smile. \"Really? You'd do that?\" Terry nodded. \"I'll leave contact info with the company. If they need us, they'll find us.\" Dino knew what it meant to Terry to have some down time and what it meant for him to give it for him. He was ready to take off alone again but now he wouldn't have to. \"How soon can we go?\" he asked eagerly. \"It'll take a day to arrange a flight. Day after tomorrow.

No copyright infringement is intended. ooo It wasn't so much that Dino had forgotten as it was he didn't want to remember, not that night but the preceding week. The truth of the matter was that the entire week was burned into his memory as well. He remembered being alone with Terry at the base camp. He remembered being distracted. He remembered the assault on the camp and he remembered being grabbed from behind. He remembered seeing Terry run and he remembered hearing shots fired. Then he blacked out, probably hit on the head. The next thing he knew he was gagged and hogtied, being dragged through the jungle. All he could think about was that he hoped that Terry had gotten away safely. He was deposited into a hut and left alone. He struggled to get out of his bonds but his kidnappers had done a professional job. He'd spent the night like that, his mind racing. He needed to find a way to get free. He needed to find a way to get back to Terry. He was coming to terms with a lot of things, the big one being his feelings for his friend. He had begun to realize that Dino the loner, Dino the womanizer, Dino, Mister Aloof, had fallen head over heals in love with Terry Thorne. Now he wondered if he would ever see him again. He had no idea if Terry felt the same way but he didn't care. If and when he got out of this he wouldn't keep his feelings hidden any longer. The next morning two men entered the hut and trained AKs on him. A third man came in and untied him. That's when the interrogations started and that's when Dino's training kicked into full gear; name, rank, and serial number, nothing else. It made for a fairly repetitive week and he could tell his kidnappers were getting frustrated. He'd managed to fake an injury right at the beginning giving his captors the impression that he was physically weak. His ploy had paid off eventually as the guards on his hut became more lax. By the end of the week he was being left completely alone and unguarded. This was when he'd made his move and snuck out of the camp. He'd stumbled around in the jungle for another full day before he came upon a village and was able to get word out that he was alive and safe. When Terry had shown up with the team he'd had to muster a lot of self control and not grab his friend and pull him into the nearest hut. He did manage to wait until they were back at their hotel. \"I thought you were dead,\" he heard Terry say. When he looked into the other man's eyes he saw something there that made his heart skip. \"You're not going to get rid of me that easily,\" he quipped and took Terry's hand. Before he knew what was happening, Terry had pinned him to the wall and covered his mouth with his own. Dino melted into the kiss and wrapped his arms around Terry's neck. He remembered that night, a mixture of pain and pleasure, laughter and tears. They didn't come out of their room for days and when they finally emerged, Dino was walking with a distinct limp that he blamed on his captivity but they both knew better.

Terry's head popped up. \"How long you been standin' there, mate?\" he asked. Dino smirked. \"Long enough to tell you got somthin' on your mind.\" He plopped down on the couch next to the Aussie. \"Come on. Spill it.\" \"You know what today is?\" Terry asked.

Then he saw the light go on. \"You remember now?\" Dino rested his head to the side laying it on Terry's shoulder. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I guess I sorta lost track of time.\" But that day, that whole week was burned into Terry's brain. It was not something he would ever forget. ooo The job had gone wrong in more ways than he could count. They'd been ambushed in the jungle. He'd gotten away but the kidnappers had grabbed Dino. It wasn't until he'd made it back to where the chopper was waiting that he realized the redhead wasn't following behind him. He'd gone back in a panic to search for him but all he found was an empty camp and Dino's AK laying on the ground. He knew something had happened to his friend because he would never willingly give up his weapon. They weren't lovers yet at that point but Terry knew his feelings for his friend were more than simple friendship. He'd been too afraid to say anything, not knowing if Dino felt the same and not wanting to jeopardize their friendship. But now he was terrified he'd never get the chance. His team searched and searched but as dusk fell they had to admit defeat, at least temporarily. Two days later word had come out of the jungle of a body found near the river. There was talk from the natives that it was the body of a redheaded male. Terry's heart sank as he thought of Dino lying out there dead. It was the worst night he'd ever spent, pure hell. They'd gone out to the village where the body had been found and, much to Terry's relief, it wasn't the body of his friend. Within a couple more days Dino had been located, not much worse for wear; a little tired, a little dirty, but alive. It had taken every ounce of self control Terry possessed not to pull Dino into his arms and take him right there in front of their team. But as soon as they got back to the hotel and they were alone it was a very different matter. Terry stared at the redhead. \"I thought you were dead,\" he said softly. Dino stared back and saw something in Terry's eyes. He stepped up close to him and smiled. \"You're not going to get rid of me that easily,\" he said as he took Terry's hand. Their first time was anything but gentle but it was what they both needed at the time. ooo Terry looked down at Dino's head resting on his shoulder. \"It's ok. I can understand why you wouldn't want to remember,\" he said as he slipped his arm around his lover. Dino smirked. \"Why? Because I was kidnapped or because I couldn't walk right for a week after that night.\" Terry laughed, his mood lifting. \"Want to return the favor?\" he asked as he leaned in for a kiss.

A/N: I got inspiration. Hope you peeps enjoy. In the cold winter of 2004, a man named Conrad Burns, a Montana Republican Senator, slipped a short paragraph into a spending bill. The bill was passed, and before long it was quite plain that something was wrong. Then someone read the paragraph in the law. It said that all Mustangs over ten years old, or who had been unsuccessfully put up for adoption three times, could be sold to the highest bidder. Without restriction of any kind. Before long, forty-one Mustangs had been slaughtered for their meat so that the wealthy of France, Italy, Belgium, Holland, and Japan could enjoy a \"delicacy\" – horsemeat. I was born into this world. And I had the great misfortune to be born a Mustang.[Chapter 2] A/N: Ok, chapter two for you peeps. I cried. It was dark and cold. There were loud noises all around me. Mommy told me not to worry, that it would be all right. But I could hear the terror in her voice. We were still in the trailer. It had been more than twelve hours, and I would have given anything to be back home. We didn't even know where we were or what time of day it was, except that it was freezing. We didn't have any room to move at all. We only stopped once, to pick up more horses. Three draft mares and a flea-bitten grey gelding. When the truck started up again one of the draft mares lost her balance and fell on top of me. My mommy kicked and bit her, trying to get her to move. But we were so crowded that the mare could barely step back. I managed to move forward enough to avoid any more collisions.[Chapter 3] A/N: This chapter is the whole reason I rated this story PG-13. It is graphic, as in a horse slaughter scene. I do not advise anyone under ten, or who is especially sensitive to this kind of thing, to read this. You can skip to the next chapter without missing anything important, because I will run over what you missed in the next a/n (minus anything graphic). IF SENATOR CONRAD BURNS IS READING THIS STORY I DEMAND THAT YOU READ THIS CHAPTER! (Not likely, but one can always hope.) That day dawned cold and wet. It was raining. It always rains when something bad happens to me. I was dozing as well as I could with all the horses making so much noise all around me. Quite suddenly, I heard my sire whinny. I opened my eyes in terror. Two men had thrown ropes around my sire's chestnut neck and were trying to drag him into the \"kill box\". The proud horse was not giving in. He was fighting up a storm. He reared, lunged at one of the men, kicked, bucked, and pulled every trick in the book. But it didn't help him. They dragged him into the pen and shocked him with an electric prod from behind, but no one could get near enough to kill him. Then he reared. I saw it all as if it happened in slow motion. The humans jerked the rope that was around his head. My sire's eyes were filled with more surprise than anything else as he fell, his long mane swirling around his neck and his forelegs clawing at the sky. As soon as he hit the ground I knew it was over. One of the men leapt forward with a \"stun gun\" as they call it. It's really more like a nail gun with nails roughly four or five inches long. The man shot three bolts into my sire's head. He screamed. I will never forget the way he screamed. The humans stood there, watching him, completely unmoved by his scream for release, not caring that he was in unbearable pain. They dragged his body to a machine that looked like a crane. They ignored the way he was still feebly struggling, ignored the fact that he was still very much alive and was not stunned as they pretend that all the horses are before they die. They lifted him up by a rope around his hind legs and slit his throat. It made me sick Blood was splattering all over the ground; I suddenly noticed the bodies of dozens of horses. I don't know why I never saw them before; perhaps it was because I didn't want to see. I didn't want to know. By this time all my herd mates were dead, even the pregnant one. She had been almost ready to have her foal, and they murdered her. It didn't register in my mind. But then, all humans are ruthless killers, according to mustangs. Three days after my sire died, they came after me. I was standing near my mommy, and we hadn't noticed that the other horses had slowly been pushing us closer to the kill box. I vaguely remember a man snapping at someone else, and a sharp shock from the electric prod. I bolted to the side, away from the prod and the kill box. My mommy defended me. It was all a whirl of movement. The men whipped me and my mother and the horses around us, my mommy kept coming between me and the men, and I kept trying to get away. I suddenly saw a gap in the mass of horses, a way out of that battle and a flicker of hope for me. Behind me my mother screamed. I checked in mid canter. The men had a rope around my mommy's neck, and were dragging her towards the kill box. I started to go back… \"No! Run! Get away from here!\" she yelled at me as I came forward. The ropes were slowly choking her to death. No one cared. The horses just wanted to stay alive, even in the living hell we were in, and the men just wanted us dead. They watched without pity as my mother kicked me away. They whipped a horse next to me, and it moved between me and my mother. The other horses were spooked by a trailer that had suddenly pulled into the \"driveway\" where the double decker trailers parked. They moved like a giant wave, slowly but surely pushing me away from my mother. I could still hear her screaming for me to get away. Then her scream was cut off, leaving behind a terrible silence. The trailer that had spooked the other horses was parked not far from the back fence, where I had taken refuge from the darkness of that day. I saw someone come out of the cab of the truck that was pulling the trailer. It was a tall, elderly man. He looked at us and shook his head sadly. My ears twitched as he walked closer, my head lifting a couple inches. I was terrified that this man was here to kill me. He slipped his hands through the bars of the fence and patted my neck. I couldn't move because I was boxed in. The mare next to me thrust her head at him, begging for attention. The man patted her too. He walked off and talked to one of the men for a moment, and then he came back and helped two of the men get a halter and lead rope on me and the other mare. They led us out of the paddock and into a two horse trailer. I was too upset and tired to fight… A/N – The good news is, the story gets happier from here. The bad news is, 50,000 horses are slaughtered every year in the exact same way the kill the ones in the story. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! I should not be the only one writing on this subject…(hint hint)[Chapter 4] A/N: Ok, brief summary of last chapter for those too young to read: The filly's father and mother were slaughtered. She was about to be killed, but an old guy came and took her and another mare away in his comfortable horse trailer. There, you missed nothing but gory details. Disclaimer: I do not own Kelly Clarkson's song \"Miss Independent\". I was scared. It wasn't dark or smelly or terrifying inside the trailer, but I was scared of what would happen to me. The mare next to me, a dark bay, was quiet. She seemed happy and somewhat relaxed, but I was still thrashing around, trying to get the halter off. I whinnied frantically.[Chapter 5] After a few weeks I started getting more used to humans. Raen visited me every day either before school or after it. She was an odd sort of person, really. It wasn't just the way she dressed and her growling tones. It was also how sad she always seemed. Raen was always very quiet when she came home from school. I felt sorry for her. One if the older geldings told me Raen's mother had died in a riding accident last year and her father had started drinking after that. One day he drank too much at a bar and had crashed into a tree on his way home. Raen didn't have any other family except for her grandfather, so she came to live at the ranch. Her love of horses never wavered, even after her mother died. Now it was one of her only joys in life. Raen's grandfather eventually started training me. Raen volunteered to be the first one on my back. \"Raen, are you sure you're ready for this? You've never helped start a Mustang before,\" her grandfather said tensely as Raen put on a riding helmet over her black hair. She had finally dyed it black, since she was sick of having brown highlights. The teen smiled reassuringly. \"I'll be just fine. Indi trusts me,\" she replied. It was a hot day in late September. I'm not sure where exactly the ranch is, but one of the mares told me we live in southern Illinois. I stood nervously in the middle of a round pen, waiting for something dreadful. The first thing I remember was a soft voice that I had never heard before. It took me a few minutes to realize it was Raen. \"That's it, girl, nice and easy,\" she said quietly. Then I felt a light weight as she placed one foot in the stirrup. I didn't move. Gingerly, Raen leaned on my back. When I still didn't move, she swung her right leg over my back and sat on top of me. I felt her right foot searching for the stirrup, the light contact she had with my mouth through the reins, and her weight in the comfy English saddle. She didn't actually weigh all that much, she felt something like a hundred pounds or a little over that. I snorted softly and my ears flicked back and forth from Raen to her grandfather to noises in front of me. Raen patted my neck. \"Good girl,\" she said calmly. She then turned her head and stared at her grandfather. \"See, no problem.\" I felt a light nudge from her heels and I obediently walked forward. Raen was a good rider, I'll admit. She was centered in such a way that was comfortable for both of us, and her cues were soft and subtle. It was almost like I could feel what she wanted me to do. She nudged my side again, a little harder, and I started to trot. Suddenly, I felt her weight lift off my back momentarily, then she was back in the saddle. This went on for a while, until I understood that she was rising and falling with my stride as I trotted around in a wide circle. After a while there was the lightest pull on the reins and I slowed to a halt. \"Wow, she's got a great posting trot,\" Raen said. Her grandfather nodded. Then he smiled broadly. \"Honey, I've got a surprise for you,\" he said. Raen turned her head and looked at him. \"Yeah?\" she asked. It sounded like she was trying not to get her hopes up too high, but was failing. \"Darling, you were riding before you could walk, I just think it's fair that you get your own horse. Raen, would you like to have Indi be your very own horse?\" Stunned silence. \"Of course!\" was the enthusiastic response after she got over the initial shock. It seemed to me like Raen had got her wish.

He did not lose his composure easily. This man sitting across from him, though… All things considered, Javier wanted to ream him out. Javier could understand being over the budget. He could understand not needing another set of hands on the job, and he could even understand having to fire a guy because of those things. That was – as much as it could be, anyway – okay. He just found it a little offensive that his boss was too preoccupied – not apologetic; just preoccupied – to look him in the eye as he handed him his check and told him to get off the jobsite. But Javier just bit his lip, took his check, and walked away. He hadn't liked his boss, but he needed the job so that he could provide for his family. Since he apparently couldn't keep his job, a good, solid reference would come in handy, and he wouldn't get one of those if he chewed his boss out. So, fighting to keep calm while already praying for God's help in finding a new job, Javi kept his peace and walked away from the jobsite, having no idea about the amazing, life-changing experiences, that were going to head his way, starting with building Adam Mitchell's shed… The first of four drabbles in the Exodus part of the \"Highlights\" series.

Speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward. ~ Exodus 14:15 (KJV) Javier genuinely could not believe the day that he had just had. There he had been, wandering through the middle of the street and – he would admit it – whining at God, when Adam Mitchell had called out to him, waving him over to help build his shed like he had been expecting him, even waiting for him, the whole time. Now Javi was practically dancing his way up the walk to his house. It really had been a wonderful day, the circumstances of which were legitimately reaffirming to his faith. That moment in the street, it had been like God was asking him why he had been moaning to begin with – why he hadn't just trusted Him to take care of the need of His child. Shouldn't he have known that God would have a plan in store for him? All Javier had needed to do was go forward trusting his God and accept that plan, going into the rather miraculous unknown to follow it.

He didn't want to confuse them, and he felt that they both deserved better than the possible confusion that it might cause them.

It's midnight.\" \"I was waiting up for my husband to come home;\" she said, stepping towards him and giving him the hug that she knew might lift his spirits. \"I ask you to get a gallon of milk from the store, and you repay me by breaking the car.\" \"I did get the milk,\" Javier said, holding up the container for proof. \"But I didn't break the car. The car broke down on me.\" \"And then the tow truck broke down when it was towing the car to the shop?\" Carmen said with raised eyebrows, repeating what he had told her during a phone call throughout the whole ordeal. \"Yes,\" Javier chuckled, suddenly finding the situation funny for some reason. \"This has got to be one of the worst days ever.\" \"But it's a different day now,\" Carmen repeated. \"It is, isn't it?\" Javier asked, seeing that the clock on the stove read 12:03. \"Yeah.

FYI, in chronological order, instead of by the verses, the chapters would go chapters 3,2,1,4. Enjoy!:) Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest. This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest. ~ Joshua 1:7 – 9 (KJV) David wasn't sure why the thought of marriage wouldn't leave him alone. It hadn't for the past few months, and eventually he'd decided to do something about it. Yet he had never felt so nervous as he was when he parked his truck at the French restaurant. Considering everything that he and Amanda had been through in the past – everything he'd not been there for and put her through – he felt there might still be a good chance of her turning him down, despite the fact that they'd been dating for a year since reconnecting over two years earlier. So he was shaking with his nervousness – horribly so. However, this still felt right; it still felt like something God was telling him it was time to do. It'll just take a little courage , David reminded himself, muttering a prayer and checking that the ring box was still in his suit pocket before he climbed from his truck and headed resolutely into the restaurant.[Chapter 2] And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries? And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant? ~ Joshua 5:13 – 14 (KJV) It was frequently hard for her, Amanda mused, to have the attitude that Joshua displayed in Joshua 5:14. Particularly when it came to one David Thomson. The man in question who had recently returned to her life – as a new Christian, no less – had shown a great affinity for the book of Joshua, and had encouraged her to read through it. So she was. Not for him, of course, but possibly because of him. These two verses had caught her attention, and she stopped reading to ponder them for a second. Amanda knew full well that she was a natural-born pessimist, and she tended to look at things in her life as being either in her favor or working against her. But that wasn't the right way to think about things, was it? Since she was a child of God now, even the hard things in her life would ultimately \"work together for good.\" Even the staggering things that she still wasn't sure how to take, like the return of David Thomson.[Chapter 3] I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out. And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea. And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season. ~ Joshua 24: 5 – 7 (KJV) It was amazing, David decided, what God could do with a life – how far He could remove someone from what they had once been. This first meeting with Amanda – and how well it had ultimately gone – was a perfect example of that for David. Over the past hours, while he'd been talking to her and explaining his recently-begun relationship with Christ, he had been pleasantly surprised to learn that she had become a Christian herself three years ago. After hearing about his newfound belief, Amanda had been much more receptive towards what he had to say – and just how much he wanted to get to know Olivia. They had even gone so far as to set up a day for him to get to meet her. So David had never been so happy as he was as he walked out of the coffee shop. He had spent years walking around without any sort of convictions, living a life of confusion and guilt, unsure why he even existed, but it was beginning to look like he was finally getting it together and working towards the life God wanted him to lead. With God's help and mercy, he was finally being brought out of his wanderings.[Chapter 4] And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD. ~ Joshua 24:15 (KJV) This day was adding up to be more than David had, for the longest time, dared to hope for. It had been over a solid three years in the making, and for the better half of that time David hadn't even dared to dream that things would end this well. Three years ago, he'd quoted Joshua 24:15 and signed the Resolution – an easy enough thing for a single man without a household, in the traditional sense of the word. However, he was now here, in this moment with Amanda – marrying her while Olivia watched as a part of the bridal party. And he had never been so determined to carry out the Resolution as he was in that moment. Well, there you have it! I'm really not sure when the next one in this series will be posted, or even what that story's going to be, but believe me when I say that I've got plenty more of them planned.:) ","Summary":" It's been a long time since I posted one of these, but here's the next one for you; it's four drabb"},{"Movie":"Proof of Life","Title":"Coming Home","Author":"hypergolic","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4650823","Passage":"[Chapter 1] ComingnHome – Part One LONDON There wasna loud bang as the door that led into the Red Lion was flung open andnstruck the wall, adding yet another dent to the plaster. For a momentnit looked like the stained glass that was fixed into the top half ofnthe door, depicting the Red Lion itself, reared up on hind legs,nteeth bared and threatening an invisible foe, might just have usherednin its last customer as it teetered dangerously in its frame,nthreatening to shatter into a thousand tiny pieces on the impact. Simplynknown as 'The Lion' to locals, the pub was an institution in thenLondon borough, it seemed as though no-one could remember a time whennthe pub hadn't been there, it had withstood the test of time andnhad stayed put as most of the surrounding buildings vanished; to benreplaced by fancy new high-rise office blocks; towers all polishednsteel and tinted glass that had appeared all around. The Lion wasnstuck in a bygone age and made of sturdier stuff. Over the years itnhad managed to evade the hundreds of bombs dropped by the Luftwaffenduring the Blitz, withstand World Cup finals (including onenespecially raucous one in 1966) and in more recent memory had evennmanaged to remain standing when a particularly rowdy hen party fromnEssex had descended on it. So Dino's rather strenuous entry barelynraised an eyebrow from the rest of the pub's clientele, who merelyncocked their heads in his direction, shrugged and went back to theirnpints. The flamenhaired K&R; specialist walked through the smoky atmosphere of thenpub and pulled himself onto one of the tall stools that lined thenbar. No-one quite knew where the smoke came from. The smoking ban wasnenforced here as much as any other public house throughout England,nyet somehow the smoky atmosphere lingered stubbornly. But then thenLion probably wouldn't seem quite right without that dense tobacconhaze. Seeing a new customer clearly in need of refreshment bought thenbarman hurtling down the bar at the break-neck speed of a gentlenamble. It was the one thing that Dino had never got used to aboutnEnglish pubs, it seemed that everyone that worked behind the bar hadna speed restriction imposed on them, one that forbade them to movenany faster than a snail's pace. In his opinion warm beer and slownservice were the two characteristics that defined British bars. \"Whatncan I get for you Sir?\" The barman asked when he finally reachednDino. 'Sir'nthere was a novelty, Dino thought, he hadn't been called Sir innquite a while. 'Stupid fucking asshole' now that's what he wasnused to being called. To him the term 'Sir' seemed a little outnof place and Dino stared back for a second trying to work out if thisnguy was trying to be funny. \"He'llnhave scotch, the good shit, am I right Dino?\" A voice, heavy withnan Australian accent, floated from the doorway of the pub. \"Yeah,nthe twelve year old stuff, none of that cheap crap. He's paying.\"nDino continued to face forward as he poked his thumb behind him, innthe direction of the disembodied voice. \"Cheekynbastard.\" Terry Thorne let out a quiet laugh. \"I'll have thensame mate.\" He added as the barman threw a questioning look in hisndirection. Thornenclimbed onto the stool next to the redhead already settled at the barnas the barman returned, placing two glasses down in front of them. \"Hownwould you like it Sir?\" He asked Dino. \"Straight,ndon't want nothing diluting it.\" Terrynnodded his agreement and the bartender poured a measure of ambernliquid into each glass. \"Leaventhe bottle.\" Terry said, peeling two notes off the wad of cash henpulled from his back pocket and handing them to the man behind thenbar who simply nodded, placed the bottle down in front of Terry andnwandered nonchalantly off down the bar to serve other customers whonhad suddenly materialised. Dinonreached out for the glass and downed the shot in one smooth action;ngiving a sharp hiss as he felt the strong alcohol burning a path downnhis throat. \"Dino,nif you're going to drink the stuff like that you could have orderednsome of the cheaper crap. You're meant to savour the taste of thentwelve year old stuff, not down it in one like it's a flamingnsambucca and your throat's about to catch fire.\" \"Yeah?nWell the pricier stuff doesn't give me a hangover.\" \"Bullshit.\" \"Yeahnwell, maybe not, but I'm working on the power of positive mentalnattitude,\" Dino replied sarcastically. As Dinonreplaced his glass on the bar Terry noticed the collection of cutsnand rapidly developing bruises along Dino's knuckles. \"Whatnhappened to your hand?\" \"Oh,nthis?\" Dino flexed the fingers of his right hand, \"I had andisagreement with a filing cabinet.\" \"Looksnlike the cabinet won mate. You should see a doctor.\" \"Nah.nIt'll be fine.\" Dino waved away Terry's suggestionnnonchalantly. Terrynstudied the man sitting next to him, something wasn't right but hendidn't know what. \"What's going on Dino? You shot out of thenoffice pretty quick back there.\" \"Nothing.\"nDino didn't even look at Terry when he answered, but just continuednstaring straight ahead. His answer came too soon, obviously annautomatic response over which Dino had taken no consideration. \"Don'tntry and bullshit me mate, it's not nothing; nothing doesn't makenyou try and beat up innocent filing cabinets.\" Terry'snattempt at humour fell flat. Dino didn't say anything in response,nbut merely pulled an envelope that contained a single, crumpled piecenof writing paper out of his pocket and pushed it along the barntowards Terry. Then he reached out and poured himself another shot, andouble, and once again drank it in one mouthful. Terrynglanced at the envelope, a letter addressed to Dino, well, actuallynit was addressed to 'Anthony Paldino', very few people ever gotnto find out Dino's full name and even those who knew it none ofnthem actually used it. The envelope was postmarked just over a weeknago from New York. Terry pulled the sheet of paper out of thenenvelope and unfolded it. The first thing to hit Terry was thenhandwriting; it was so neat, so elegant that it simply screamed withnfemininity. A letter from a woman that knew Dino well enough to usenhis full name was writing him a letter – that never boded well.nTerry had received his share of 'Dear John' letters in the past,nhis most memorable when he'd first joined the army and transferrednover to the UK and suddenly Terry thought he knew what was eating atnhis friend; but as the truth was revealed he realised that hencouldn't have been further off base. There werena couple of sections of the letter where the ink had been smudged, asnif droplets of water had obliterated the text in those areas. As henread the words on the page Terry realised that where the paper hadnbeen wet marked the places where the writer's tears had fallen onnthe letter and that this was no 'Dear John'. Tony, I'mnsorry to write at what is clearly a busy time for you, but there isnsomething you have to know. I have been trying to contact you fornabout a month but there's been no response from any of the numbersnI have for you either in New York or London and when I called yournoffice they said that you had taken on a contract and the companyncouldn't tell me where you were or when you'd be back. I can onlynhope that at least this letter will find its way to you when younfinally return. I don'tnreally know where to start my explanation. I suppose that it allnbegan about a month ago when Connor got sick, it wasn't too bad atnfirst but over the next few days he got a lot worse. It wasn't justna bit of a cold any more, I knew it was something more serious. Thendoctor admitted him to the hospital straight away saying that henshould have some tests done. Two days later he was diagnosed with anrare and virulent form of Leukaemia. The doctors said that they werenincredibly hopeful that they'd caught it early enough that theynmight be able to treat him with a new drug that was being developed.nI can't tell you how much I hoped and prayed that they could donsomething to help him but I think that God grew tired of me a longntime ago. The disease was further along than they'd thought. Thentreatment didn't work, he didn't get better, and last night Inheld him in my arms as he passed away. He'sngone Tony. I'venjust got back home from the hospital and I knew that this letter wasnthe first thing I needed to do, if I don't write it now I'mnafraid that I won't find the strength to write it at all and abovenall things you have a right to know. I'mnsorry that you have to be told like this; through a letter, but ifnI'm being honest I think that maybe it's better this way, I don'tnthink I could find the words to tell you what had happened even if Incould speak to you. Thenhouse is so quiet, so lonely now. It feels empty, it's not a homenany more, just an empty shell. I feel so lost and alone right now.nPlease come home Tony, I need you. Abi. Terry readnthrough the letter, which was clearly written from the heart. It wasnamazing that so few words could so clearly illustrate such desperatenheartache. When henlooked up at the redhead sitting next to him at the bar he found himnpouring yet another shot into his glass. The level of liquid in thenbottle had dropped dramatically since the bartender had set it downnin front of them and Terry wondered how much his friend had drunknwhile his attention had been concentrated on the letter. Terry putnhis hand out and forced Dino to put the bottle down, pulling it outnof his reach. \"Who'snConnor?\" Dinonpaused, looking directly into Terry's eyes, before dropping hisngaze to the smooth wooden surface of the bar. \"He'snmy son.\" \"Your…what?\"nTerry was shocked by this piece of information. He'd found out anlot about Dino over the years that they'd worked together, but he'dnnever revealed that he had a son. \"Connornis… was …my son. Abi; Abigail, was my high-schoolnsweetheart. She was the only girl who refused to call me Dino. Shencalled me by my first name; Anthony or Tony, no matter how many timesnI told her not to.\" He smiled, doubtless remembering better times.n\"We were inseparable as kids, the perfect couple in high-school andngot married the instant we graduated. Oh we thought life was going tonbe easy…what idiots.\" He gave a humourless laugh. \"So howncome…?\" Terry was confused. That had sounded like an ideal startnto a life story and yet something had obviously happened to break itnapart. \"We werenboth young and naïve. But ultimately it was my fault. I was borednwith being tied down to a wife and a nine to five mechanic job at thenlocal garage. I wanted more, I wanted excitement and adventure. Thenarmy came calling and I wanted to join up.\" He shrugged and thennthe expression on his face grew darker. \"God I was selfish. Abingave up all her hopes and dreams of being a professional dancer fornme and I was bored ? What a stupid fucking ass I was.\" Dinonfolded his arms on the hard surface in front of him and laid his headndown on his forearms. \"It's such a cop-out to say we just grewnapart. I guess we didn't grow apart at all, I tore us apart.\" \"Wherendoes Connor fit into this?\" \"We werenstill together when I joined up and you know what basic training'snlike; no extended missions meant I could get home at the weekends.nAbi called me at the training camp a few months after I signed up fornthe forces to tell me that she was pregnant. She was so happy and itnchanged things, y'know? For a wile we were like we used to be, I'dncome home from training at the weekends and we spent time getting tonknow each other again. I guess I fell in love with her all overnagain. My CO took pity on me and gave me some leave around the timenthe baby was due.\" He paused and sat up straight again. \"You werenthere when your lad was born, right Ter?\" \"Yep.\"nTerry couldn't help but smile as a stream of memories came floodingnback. \"Best day of my life.\" \"Thennyou know what a magical thing it is. I held him in my arms just afternhe was born and I knew then that there was nothing as important asnthat little life.\" Dino actually glanced down at his arms as ifnexpecting to see a newborn child nestling in the crook of his arm.n\"That was the closest I ever came to chucking it all in with thenarmy; going back to the 9-5 grind. I even went to talk to my CO aboutnit.\" He paused. \"…Then he told me that I'd been offered anplace with special ops. Said it was unheard of for anyone this freshninto an army career to get offered a place. I was thrilled andnsuddenly all thoughts of my son vanished, like that.\" He snappednhis fingers. \"Abi said she understood; that I wanted to serve myncountry. She let me walk out of the door and never said an angry wordnto me, not a single one. I wish she had in a way, because thenalternative was disappointment. I wish now that she'd yelled andnscreamed and thrown stuff at me. Told me what a selfish prick I was.nPerhaps it would have made me see the truth.\" Dino sighed beforencontinuing. \"Abi sent me pictures of him growing up and I visitednthem every time I got some leave. But he always called me 'Sir'nnot 'dad'. I wanted that more than anything else, but I didn'tnhave the right to ask anything of them, I didn't deserve it.\" \"We allnmake mistakes mate.\" Terry's mind drifted back to the last timenhe'd seen his own son and how he too had called him 'Sir'.nPerhaps that was the curse that they all had to bear. \"Yeah,nbut not quite so many as I've managed to make in my life. And nownI'm thousands of miles away in a pub in merry-old-fucking-Englandnwhile my son's body is being lowered into the ground half the worldnaway.\" He grabbed the bottle and didn't even bother pouring anshot out into his glass, instead he drank the whiskey straight fromnthe bottle. Terryngrabbed the bottle out of Dino's grasp, spilling some of the liquidndown the front of his jacket in the process. \"So whatnthe fuck are you doing here, drowning your sorrows and griping aboutnhow your life's turned to shit because of your bad choices? You'renmaking another choice right now and you're going to regret itnlater. You should be on a plane back to New York.\" \"What'snthe point? He's dead and nothing's going to change that.\" \"Did youneven read this letter Dino?\" Terry thrust Abi's letter innthe redhead's face. \"Well? Did you?\" \"Ofncourse I read it.\" Dino snarled back, he was getting angry now,nwhether as a result of the alcohol that was hitting his system ornbecause Terry's reaction had prompted his own guilt to resurface itnwasn't clear. \"Read itnagain. The last paragraph.\" Terry watched as Dino obedientlynscanned the text again, although he was fairly certain that everynsingle word of that missive had been imprinted on his mind already.n\"There's a woman that's falling apart there. You're not thenonly one who's lost a son. She needs you.\" \"No shendoesn't, she's better off without me.\" \"Dino,nsometimes you can be a complete royal prick.\" \"Thanks,nbut I'd worked that one out for myself.\" \"You cannhave moments of extreme stupidity and you're as stubborn as hellnmate, but you're not a selfish bastard at heart. Perhaps you mightnhave been once, a long time ago, but I know you're not now. Get thenfuck on a plane and show her that you've changed. Tell her thatnyou're sorry, tell her what you just told me. Just be honest withnher, she deserves that much.\" \"I don'tnknow if I can, Ter.\" \"Why thenfuck not?\" \"Because…becausenI'm scared.\" Dino caught the incredulous look Terry shot at him.n\"Oh I know, I can deal with assholes firing entire arsenals at me,ntrying to knife me, wanting to blow me up, but this; being honest,nmeeting my mistakes head-on, it scares me more than anything else innthe world. I don't know if I can face her again.\" \"I knownyou better than most people do Dino, and I know one thing above allnothers and it's that you are not a coward. Do you still love her?\" Thenquestion, tacked onto the end of Terry's reassurances, caught Dinonoff-guard and because he didn't have time to concoct a clevernresponse he answered instantly and honestly. \"Yes.\" \"Then gontell her.\" Terry pushed Dino off his barstool. \"Actually…\" henpaused, \"…perhaps you should drink some strong coffee and try andnsober up a bit first. Oh, and change your shirt; you stink like anbrewery.\"[Chapter 2] ComingnHome – Part Two NEWnYORK \"She'snnot there, son.\" A voice called out as Dino stepped back from thenfront door of the little house. He turnednand looked down the steps that led up to where he was currentlynstanding; next to the front door, the steps that after hanging aroundnfor about ten minutes he had finally managed to gather the courage tonclimb. And found an old man standing on the walkway below leaningnover the railings at the bottom. Dino hadnmanaged to charm and cajole the check-in staff at the airport to getna seat on the next available flight from Heathrow to New York, wherenhe'd grabbed a cab and given the driver an all-too-familiarnaddress, one that would be eternally engraved on his mind. As the cabnhad pulled up on the other side of the street from the ground floornresidence in one of the old red-brick buildings in Brooklyn Heights,nDino had felt a shiver run down his spine. He'd paid the fare andnclimbed out of the cab, feeling the sharp wind whipping at his face.nIt had taken him a few minutes to even build up the courage to crossnthe road, ten minutes or so of lingering at the bottom of the stairsnuntil he managed to climb up to the front door and another five tonactually knock on the door. And he'd only managed it in that timenscale because he was starting to get a few dodgy glances as if peoplenthought he was casing the place. It was stupid really, he still had ankey to the building on his keychain, he could have let himself in,nbut somehow it didn't seem the right thing to do. This wasn't hisnhome any more and he felt as though he'd be trespassing on someonenelse's life; Abi's life. \"Indaresay she's still over at Greenwood cemetery; didn't come homenlast night either.\" The old man at the bottom of the steps hadncontinued when his initial statement hadn't elicited a responsenfrom the young man at the top of the steps. Dino paused and thoughtnabout the stranger's turn of phrase, trying to place his dialogue.nWhen he did he found it almost ridiculous that in the past hours he'dntravelled all this way from Britain to the States and yet one of thenfirst people he met had an English accent. \"Thank-you.\"nDino felt like he should introduce himself, \"I'm…\" but hennever got the chance to finish as the old man cut off hisnintroduction. \"I knownwho you are kid. You think I'd be telling you she wasn't in ifnyou were some stranger?\" There was distaste and a hint of venom innhis gruff voice that told Dino the old man really did recognise him.nHe dropped his head in shame. \"What'renyou waiting here for? I'd wager she'll not be back here for angood long time, not unless someone goes and fetches her back.\" \"Greenwoodnyou said?\" \"Aye. Nondoubt the woman at the main office'll tell you which plot you'renlooking for.\" \"Thank-you.\" As Dinonjumped down the steps, starting on his way down the street on anmission to hail another cab to take him across to the cemetery, thenold man waylaid his progress by grabbing his arm in a vice-like gripnthat belied the man's senior years. \"Andnson? I'm truly sorry for your loss, he was a good lad.\" Dinonnodded, unable to find the words he wanted to say, although hendoubted that he's be able to say them even if he did have the rightnwords. \"Don'tnlet one unhappy ending stop you from trying for a happily ever after,nkid.\" There was a twinkle in the old man's eye as he released hisngrip on Dino's arm. \" Arthur ,nyou stop pestering that young man and get your hide in here, yourndinner's going cold.\" Dino looked up and found a woman's facenat the window of the house next to Abi's. \"YesnDear.\" The old man called up in response, sending a small salute innher direction and Dino saw her smile as she walked away from thenwindow shaking her head in amusement. The man turned his attentionnback towards Dino briefly. \"Happily ever afters kid, sometimes younhave to work hard at making them happen, but when you get there Inpromise you it's worth every minute.\" --------------------------------- The windnswept through the cemetery, cutting through him like a knife, butnDino shrugged off the cold, he'd experienced sub-zero temperaturesnbefore, as an army Delta operative his unit was on constant warnfooting and even the months when they weren't on active duty on thenfront lines in warzones all over the world they would conductnreadiness drills, sometimes in the desert, sometimes out on thendeserted ice plains of the Arctic. A little wind wasn't going tonget to him now. But whatnthe wind had failed to do, the sight that met his eyes as he roundedna corner in the cemetery accomplished easily; Abi . Seeing hernthere chilled him to the very core. She was standing alone at anfreshly dug graveside, her arms were wrapped tightly around her body,nher long blonde hair was being whipped around her face and up intonthe air by the fierce gale-force wind that howled around her. Had thenweather been less vicious the spot would have been picturesque. Thengrave was located near one of the cemetery's lakes, a group ofntrees overhanging the small group of headstones that littered thengrass in this section; but today offered no fine photo opportunity.nThe sky was a dull slate grey, the lake's surface whipped intonwaves topped with white peaks as the wind blew its course across thenwater but Dino didn't really notice any of this, his surroundingsnwere peripheral, all that he could see was her. He walkednup behind her until she was barely a few metres away. Dino wanted tonstep right up and fold her into his arms, to take all her pain away,nbut as with using the key to enter the house he had once shared withnthis woman, he felt as though he had lost the right to feel her innhis grip a long time ago. She didn't notice his presence until henstood directly behind her and spoke her name. \"Abi.\" She jumpedna little, surprised to find anyone near her and as she turned aroundnat the sound of his voice and now he could see the stream of tearsnthat stained her face. Her eyes were red; doubtless the result ofncrying for days on end. He wondered if she would even recognise himnafter all this time, he knew he'd aged; gained a few wrinkles, he'dnallowed his hair to grow a little longer than he used to and a couplenof grey hairs had appeared here and there. He was dressed in hisnusual casual attire of jeans, t-shirt and his old army jacket thatnhad seen him through a fair few years of active service even beforenhe'd gone into the K&R; business. The duffel that was slung overnone shoulder contained the few items of clothing that he'd managednto grab from his London flat before he caught his flight out to NewnYork. In thenmoments before she acknowledged him he took the chance to just looknat her, drinking in the sight of the only woman he'd ever trulynloved. Her skin was pale and the clothes that she wore seemed to hangnfrom her frame as though she'd lost a substantial amount of weightnrecently, but the biggest change he noticed was in her eyes. She usednto have the most startling eyes, a mixture of hazel with green andnyellow streaks that sparkled when she smiled. Her eyes alone couldnlight up an entire room and make him feel warm inside, even on thencoldest days. Now though, the sparkle was gone, replaced with a dullnhue, the streaks of green and yellow seemed to have all but vanished.nIt was as if someone had replaced her eyes with glass ones, the kindnthat were used in dolls. She starednat him for a few seconds, apparently trying to work out if he wasnreal or was simply a hallucination, before giving a heart-wrenchingnsob and crossing the distance between them, throwing her arms aroundnhis neck and holding him tightly as if she were never going to letnhim go, allowing the façade of strength that she had put up forneveryone else to crumble and fall. He dropped his duffel onto thenground as she approached and wrapped his own arms around her waist.nHe was shocked to find her shaking, not just from her crying, butnfrom the cold. Her clothes and hair were wet and Dino thought back tonwhat the old man had said about her not having been home last night.nHe wondered just how long she'd been standing out here in the rainnand freezing cold. \"Abi,nyou're freezing. You'll catch your death out here.\" \"Hopefully,\"nshe whispered. That onenword from her mouth struck fear into his heart. The woman that he hadnknown had been so full of vim and vigour; had always been sonpositive. Perhaps this one last blow to her soul had finally made herngive up on life. Dinonslipped off his army jacket, leaving him clad in the simple whitent-shirt that he wore underneath. He peeled her arms from around hisnneck briefly and put the jacket on her, wrapping the durable materialnof the too big garment around her. He rubbed his hands up and downnher arms, trying to persuade her circulation to start working harder,nbefore once again placing his arms around her and pulling her closento him. It wasnalmost as if she had been waiting for someone to come that she couldnrely on as within seconds he felt her body sag as finally exhaustionntook over and unconsciousness claimed her. He didn't like to thinknwhat might have happened if he hadn't got here in time, she couldnhave lain out here unconscious for hours, maybe days before she wasnfound. And by that time…well, he didn't want to think of whatnmight have happened, he shuddered at the very possibility. As he heldnher upright, Dino's eyes moved across to the headstone where thenname 'Connor Paldino' was inscribed in bright gold lettering thatnshone in contrast to the dark marble stone. \"I'mnsorry son, you deserved so much more than me.\" He felt the tearsnstarting to escape and roll down his cheek. \"I'll come back asnsoon as I can, but I have to look after your mom right now.\" Stillnsupporting Abi with his left arm, Dino picked up his duffel andnhooked it over his shoulder before leaning down and bringing hisnright arm behind the back of Abi's knees, scooping her up into hisnarms. ---------------------------------------- This timenhe used his key to let himself into the red brick house, balancingnthe form of the unconscious woman in his arms as he reached out tonunlock the door. As he entered the modest abode he was struck by hownlittle the place had changed. Oh there was new furniture and thenwalls had been painted a slightly different colour, but the roomsnwere arranged in the same way. The same photographs were displayed onnthe wall, now with a few notable additions of Connor as he grew up.nThe one photograph that took pride of place was a picture of thenthree of them taken just a few days after Connor had been born; itnshowed Dino with the baby huddled in the crook of his arm while hisnother arm was wrapped around Abi, who sat next to him. It was anmemory of happier times. Suddenly he pulled himself out of hisnreverie, realising that he still held Abi in his arms and that evennthough unconscious she was still shaking with cold. He walked throughninto what had once been their bedroom, but was now only hersnand laid her gently on the bed, quickly setting about pulling openndrawers to find her some dry clothes. That done, he sat down on thenbed and propped Abi up against him and paused, wondering what to do.nHe really needed to get her out of the dripping wet clothes and getnher warm and dry, but that action involved a level of intimacy thatnhe no longer qualified for. This would be much easier if she werenconscious, then at least he could merely help her. Dino nudged thenunconscious woman, but there was no response. Damn, he was goingnto have to do this on his own then . Eventually he steeled himselfnto face the consequences and removed his jacket from her followed bynher jeans and top and firmly rubbed her skin with a towel he hadnfound draped over a heater to one side of the bedroom. This had anduel effect, firstly it dried off her skin from the rainwater thatnhad soaked through the fabric of her clothing and secondly it helpednto get her circulation working a bit better again and soon he saw thenpink hue return to her skin as blood rose to the surface capillaries.nFinally he replaced her clothes with the dry set of garments he'dnfound on his hunt. He hoped that she wouldn't be too embarrassed ornpissed off with him when she woke up. He was certain that she'd seenhis point that a little embarrassment or irritation was infinitelynpreferable to hypothermia. She wasnstill unconscious as he carried her back into the lounge area, whichnseemed to be the warmest room in the house. He sat on the couch withnher on his knee, her head leaning on his chest and his arms wrappednaround her for what seemed like hours but in reality was probablynonly about ten minutes. Dino had pulled her close, holding her tight;nsharing the warmth from his body and relishing the fact that she feltnso good in his grip. Looking down at her, it was then that henrealised she still wore her wedding ring, the thin band of white goldnencircling her finger. It was plain, no stones, just a thin strip ofnprecious metal. He hadn't been able to afford anything grandiose,nalthough he had wanted to give her the world. His mind drifted to thenday they'd been and chosen it, she had said it was perfect, justnlike their relationship; no pretence, nothing to interfere with thenpure love that they had for each other. He ran his thumb lightly overnthe metal band before squeezing her tighter. It was innthose few moments that Dino realised that since he had separated fromnAbi he'd never really had a proper relationship. He'd sleptnaround and had more than his fair share of one-night stands, but he'dnnever let any woman get close to him. He'd always bade themnfarewell when the morning sun began to shine. He wondered whethernthere was something at work in his subconscious that still held on tonthe memory of the woman now in his arms, as if something inside himnhad wrapped armour around his heart and refused to let anythingnpenetrate his emotions. They were, after all still married; neithernof them ever having started divorce proceedings, so perhaps somethingnhidden deep inside his mind told him not to allow himself to becomenembroiled in another relationship for fear that he would have tonofficially end any lasting link with this beautiful woman. FinallynAbigail began to rouse and Dino felt all the muscles in her bodyntense as she found herself in someone's arms; found herself innclothes that she was certain she had not put on herself. Disorientednand not knowing where she was for a second she started to push himnaway. He held onto her a little tighter, forcing her to remain in hisnarms, worried that if she tried to stand so soon after regainingnconsciousness then she might further hurt herself. Her strugglencontinued for a few seconds and then she glanced around and found thenfamiliar surroundings of her home. As her eyes met Dino's shenrelaxed; realising she was safe. \"Hey,nDino.\" \"Hey,nAbi. How're you feeling?\" He whispered. \"Honestly?nYou don't want to know.\" \"Yes Indo.\" \"Wellnthat would make a change.\" Her response held a hint of bitterness. Dino drewnbreath to retort and then fell silent, knowing that he deserved everynbitter thought and sharp snipe that she could possibly throw at him.nHe dropped his eyes so he was looking at his own chest, ready to takenwhatever she could dish out. Shenpaused. \"I'm sorry Dino, you didn't deserve that, I'mnjust…just…\" Her voice petered out without her sentence comingnto a firm conclusion. \"Honestly? I don't really know what I amnright now; tired, confused…\" \"Justnbeing honest?\" Dino whispered. \"No, don't deny it,\" henstopped her before she could say anything in response, \"I'm sorrynAbi, I've been a completely selfish...\" \"You'renhere now though, that's what matters.\" Dinondidn't mention that if it hadn't been for Terry then he'dnprobably still be in a pub on the other side of the world. Henblushed. \"I'm only a few decades late.\" \"Younalways were a bit rubbish at time-keeping, Dino.\" She smilednweakly, a smile which grew as his head raised again and he dared tonlook her in the eye once more. Suddenly anthought poked at his brain. \"Hey, you called me Dino. You'vennever called me that before.\" He smiled at her. \"No Inguess I haven't.\" Her answering smile was somehow tinged withnsadness now. \"Abi,ncan I ask you something?\" \"Inguess.\" \"Whynwouldn't you ever call me Dino before?\" Shenthought for a moment before she answered. \"Because I wasn't innlove with the tough-guy image you wanted everyone else to see. Dinonwas this tough street-wise, smart-ass kid that everyone knew. I lovednTony; the man that was hidden underneath that image. I loved the mannwho used to sing along to the music as we danced, the man that wantednto just sit for hours and hours talking or just holding me in hisnarms. The man who promised me that he'd never hurt me. I guess Indon't know if that man still exists.\" She maintained eye contactnall the time she was speaking, and although in his shame Dinondesperately wanted to look away, he found himself completely unablento. Her honestnwords cut him to the core and once again he found his eyes fillingnwith tears. Seeing his pain caused by her honest words she bought anhand up and ran her fingers along his jaw-line, Holding his headnsteady as she gazed deep into his watery eyes which were as startlingnas the day she'd first met him. \"Ah,nthere he is. Hello Tony.\" \"I'mnso sorry Abi.\" He whispered, his voice breaking. Her fingernmoved from his jaw to his lips, silencing him as she leaned forwardnagain, resting her head back on his chest, listening to the steadynrhythm of his heart. \"No, I'mnsorry.\" He heard her whisper. \"Sorrynfor what?\" He was confused. He'd basically walked out on her andnleft her to deal with all the crap and yet she had something tonapologise for? \"FornConnor, for everything. It's my fault.\" \"No it'snnot.\" \"Inshould have believed him that first day he said he felt sick, Inshould have noticed, shouldn't have sent him to school. I shouldnhave looked after him better.\" Dino putnhis hands on her shoulders and pulled her back so he could look atnher. Now it was Abigail who found it impossible to make eye contact. \"Look atnme Ab.\" Eventually and a little hesitantly she complied. \"It'snnot your fault. No matter what we do, or how hard we try, some peoplenare just taken too early. I should have been here…for both of you.\" She shooknher head. \"All those years ago…I should have told you I loved younmore often, should have held you tighter. I should have tried to benthe woman you wanted.\" Oh God,nDino thought, she blamed herself for his stupidity. She thought shenwas the reason that he left. He needed to let her know that it wasn'tnher fault, that it was entirely his stupid, self-destructivenpersonality that ripped apart everything that they had made together,nbut when he came to speak his lips flapped open and closed and yet nonsound was forthcoming. Abi sawnhis struggle to speak and saved him finding the words. \"I missednyou Tony.\" \"Inmissed you too Ab.\" She laynher head back down on his chest, just underneath his chin and sighed.nHe felt her relax totally as once again the exhaustion of the pastnfew days claimed her and she drifted gently into sleep. Dino lay hisncheek on the top of her head and began to hum a melody that tricklednback into his mind. A song that he had first heard many years ago, anlullaby that his mother had once sung to him to soothe him in hisnrestless nights when monsters stalked his dreams. The vibrations ofnhis deep voice rumbled through his chest and further soothed her innher slumber. In turn, Dino felt himself relaxing, and despite thenstorm of thoughts assaulting his mind he found himself following Abininto sleep. --------------------------------------- It wasnDino's growling stomach that woke him. It was a loud percussionncalling for food. Dino opened his eyes and for a moment couldn'tnwork out where he was. The place was familiar and yet unfamiliar atnthe same time. Then he blinked and realised that there was a woman innhis arms and he remembered what had happened in the past twenty-fournhours. He listened to the silence that was only broken by Abi'snsoft breathing. He could tell by the pitch of her breathing that shenwas already awake and he shifted in his seat, arching his head sonthat he could look down at her. \"Whennwas the last time you ate?\" She asked him with a concerned look onnher face. Damn,nso she'd heard his stomach growling, well that was suave. \"Um,nsometime around about Tuesday I think,\" he answered after thinkingnabout the question for a few seconds. She satnback and looked at him in disbelief. \"So you haven't eaten fornwell over 24 hours?\" \"Inforgot.\" He admitted sheepishly. \"I had more important things onnmy mind.\" He reached up and moved a lock of hair out of her face,ntucking it behind her ear. Shendisentangled herself from Dino's grasp and he reluctantly let herngo as she wandered a little unsteadily at first towards the kitchen.nDino stood and followed her, ready to catch her if she fell again. \"Inhaven't got that much food in; I've been a little…um…preoccupied.nI think I can manage some pasta though.\" \"Soundsngreat, what can I do to help?\" \"Justntalk.\" This wasnwhat they used to do; he would stand at the kitchen door while shenprepared their meals and talk to her as she chopped, boiled, roastednand poached the food. He had attempted to help once or twice, but hisnefforts had never been particularly successful to the point that Abinhad actually banned him from the food preparation area entirely untilnafter the meal when he was allowed to help with the dishes. It wasnimpressive that they simply fell back into the old routines soneasily; it had been a long time since they'd shared the same homenafter all. He twistednhis neck in an attempt to get rid of the crick that had appearednafter having slept in an awkward position. In the kitchen he heardnAbi going through cupboards for various utensils and started to takena look around the cosy living room. His eyes found a familiarninsignia printed on a piece of paper and he picked it up. \"What'snthis?\" \"What'snwhat?\" Abigail stuck her head out of the kitchen to see what he wasntalking about. \"Oh, that.\" The piecenof paper that Dino had picked up was an application form; a similarnform to one that he himself had filled in many, many years ago. Thenemblem of the United States Army shone out from the corner of thenpaper, declaring it to be an application to join basic training andnselection courses. The first page was covered in boxes requesting thenapplicant's personal details, name, age, address, date of birth;nthe usual stuff. Dino read down the page, finding his son's detailsncarefully printed in the boxes. Abi walkednout of the kitchen, wiping her hands on a clean towel and took thenform from his hands, glancing lovingly over the half-completed form \"Connornwas applying to join the army, it was all he'd ever wanted to do.nEver since I can remember whenever anyone asked him what he wanted tondo when he grew up he said he wanted to be a soldier and serve hisncountry. Most kids go through phases of what they want to do whennthey grow up, most want to join the police or be a fireman, the morenadventurous plan to grow up to be like Superman, but not Connor. Fromnthe moment he could talk he knew what he wanted to do, and his wishnnever faltered, not once. I promised him that if he still wanted thensame thing, with the same amount of conviction when he was old enoughnto sign up and if he did well at school then I'd let him apply.\" \"But whynthe army? He was a clever lad, he could have done anything. He didn'tnneed to be crawling through the muck out in some Godforsaken part ofnthe world.\" \"C'monnTony, you're not stupid, can't you guess why?\" She gave him anquick smile. \"He was so proud of his dad. He wanted to be just likenyou.\" Dino's glance followed hers over to a framed photograph ofnthe two of them on the wall. Dino was in full military uniform withnAbi clinging to his side. Dinonsighed deeply. \"You never told him the truth did you?\" She wasnpuzzled and it showed clearly in her face. \"What do you mean, thentruth?\" \"That Inwas a selfish son of a…\" \"Younweren't selfish Tony…you were just following a dream.\" She cutnoff his sentence. \"No Inwasn't. I was following a stupid illusion and I was running away. Injust couldn't see it until it was too late and I couldn't turnnback. My real dream was to be here with you and Connor; to have anlife, a family, to love and be loved in return. But something in mynscrewed up head wouldn't let me be happy, it told me to go afternsomething else, that a bigger adventure lay just around the corner. Indidn't realise until it was too late that the biggest adventure Incould ever have had lay right here with you.\" Her eyesnwidened momentarily at the honesty of his words. \"It's never toonlate to turn back.\" \"But itnis too late, isn't it. I've seen and done some horrible things innmy life Abi. I've killed so many men, some out of self-defence,nsome in cold blood. You deserve someone better than me.\" He turnednaway slightly, unwilling to let her see the guilt on his face.n\"You've always deserved someone better.\" Shenrefused to let him move away, instead touching her hand to his cheeknand turning him back to face her; forcing him to look at her as shenspoke. \"But I don't want anyone better Tony, I never did.nI wanted you, flaws and all. I only ever wanted you.\" She heldnhis gaze for a few seconds before doing something that he didn'tnexpect; she carefully placed the application form back down onto thentable and stepped forward, closing the gap between them. She hookednher hand around the back of his neck and pulled him down so that hernlips could capture his in a warm embrace. Dinondidn't pull away, it felt so good to be kissing this woman again,nto hold her close and know that she was his, that despite the factnthat he had been a complete moron for the past several decades thatnshe too had refused to move on and that she was now willing to givenhim a second chance. \"So whatnnow?\" She asked as she finally broke the kiss. \"Well,nright now, I could use some food. Shenlaughed. \"You are so predictable Tony. It's either food or…\" Heninterrupted her, \"Yeah well we'll get to the 'or' bit later.\"nHe smirked and whether it was his presumptuousness or the cheeky looknon his face she couldn't help but laugh at him. \"Andnthen?\" \"Andnthen I want you to sit and tell me everything about Connor that I'venmissed, every moment, every joke, every fall, scrape, knock or smile.nI want you to tell me everything.\" \"Andnafter that?\" \"Ah,nyou're looking at the big picture right?\" \"Mmm.\"nShe looked nervous now. \"Well,\"nDino shifted his arm around her waist and pulled her close, \"someonentold me recently that it's hard work sometimes, but no matter hownmany unhappy endings have gone by, there is such a thing as happilynever after. I figured we could give it a go, what do you think?\" She pausednand then a smile took over her face. \"I think it's worth a shot.\" ","Summary":" ComingnHome – Part One LONDON There wasna loud bang as the door that led into the Red Lion was flun"},{"Movie":"Proof of Life","Title":"Four People","Author":"kaptainmad","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3170755","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: Neither the film nor the characters do belong to me. Four People Chapter One: Peter Pan I know he loves her. The way he looks at her, the way he nervously gestures as if a private moment is hidden between them. I just know. But what I don't know, is if she loves him. Dino told me a story, a while back but is compelling to look back on. It was after my rescue. He was drunk, in a bar, of course otherwise he wouldn't have told me. It was about Alice and Terry. ' Here, lets have a drink, to life, honour and the other crap. Speaking of honour there's this great story, about two people.' His eyes were unfocused, his clumsy hand movements threatening to tip his glass of gin on himself. ' We were having this get together, see?' A crooked smirk plastered over his face, 'It was about you and we were discussing this and that, and about money and god knows what when I watched Alice and Terry' I was curious and my expression must have been so funny that it struck amusement in Dino. 'Terry picked up this beer glass and took a swig from it, no sooner than he put it down, Alice took it, drinking up about half the remaining glass' Pausing for a minute to add effect, he smiled down at his empty glass of gin then turning back to Peter and said. '… it was almost as if they were married!' Giving a loud chuckle, he waved to the bartender to refill his glass yet again. It was funny, Alice hated sharing drinks, especially with someone she didn't know very well, especially if it was a scotch or beer. Even my sister noticed something, a lot of talking and private conversations sometimes a whole lot of talking as if noonewastherethoughitmighthavebeenabigcrowd. As it happened before we left Columbia, they talked as if it were the end of the world, as if they were never going to see each other again.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: Ditto, Peter Pan. Four People Chapter Two: Dino-saur Twenty years ago, I got a job at K&R;, the Kidnap and Ransom office. I mostly got it for the guns and the money the training was great. The negotiating was even better. There I met Terry. By the end, Terry and me went off to different parts of the world, me New York, and Aussie Terry, London. So in-between that time we should have at least made progress with our god forsaken jobs. That didn't happen. What happened was that Terry got married to a General's daughter, got divorced and before the divorce, a kid. Me? Nothing, absolutely nothing except supplying teams and guns for missions. Then Columbia happened. Terry had to fall for a married woman presumably Alice and to sum that all up, I saw something that I don't think I was supposed to see. ' Keep moving guys, helicopter in 13:00 hours!' I was shouting to the men. Terry had slowed behind at the garage so I went back several steps to see what was going on. I saw something that I don't think Peter would have been too happy about. Decidingly because he's married to one of the two people I saw.But what I saw was over romantic, partial infidelity and other stuff, well for me. Alice and Terry. Kissing. No surprise for Terry he's divorced, but 50 feet dive for Alice and negative five points to her marriage to Peter lasting. After that I knew it. He loved her. Probably in love with her. Now how's that to accidentally telling Peter a moment relatively small, when I was drunk?[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: Do I really have to say it again? Four People ChapternThree: Alice in Wonderland I was pretty much sobbing my heartnout then, I wouldn't have cared a bit if anyone saw me. He wasndoing what he could do. Comfort me.

When we kissed I felt I should'venpulled back but I didn't. He was so nice, so brave to go out therento save someone he hardly knew for me. Someone he loved. Then as fast as it came it ended.

I felt like my heart was breaking, he had given me so much, notnjust a kiss but someone I cared deeply about. I knew he didn'tndeserve this. Not me and Peter going away to the other side of thenworld, not never seeing me again. As I left into the car, I lookednback. Back towards him. Back towards thenperson I felt most for. Back to where I met someone, a guy namednTerry, and Australian ex-soldier who gave everything he had to me. Peter put his hand on mine and said,nas we left. ' We made it' I replied. 'We did' I had looked forward to this momentnfor so long but I felt nothing, just relief, no rush of love ornanything. Taking my eyes off Peter, I looked up and there was Terry.nStaring down at me above the cliff face like a guardian angelnwatching over me. I would never forget that moment. Never, when Ingrow old and withered, I never will. To him I was going forever, to menlike I had lost something.

Four People Chapter One: Peter Pan"},{"Movie":"Proof of Life","Title":"The Last Tango","Author":"lucymalta","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5527631","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Dino let himself quietly into the house, feeling slightly guilty. The evening before, a couple of Terry's and his old SAS friends had dropped into the office and a couple of after work drinks had turned into a raucous evening out. Both he and Terry had made the obligatory phone call telling Jackie and Gaby not to wait up. Jackie, hearing who was in town, had chuckled and said that she would see Terry when she woke up, Gaby had sounded amused and slightly relieved. Since the twins had been born Dino had become a little too over protective and was always fussing around her at home, not letting her out of his sight, at first she didn't mind, but after a year, it was getting a little too much. She hoped that a night out with the boys would sort him out a little. Dino's guilt however was not related to having a little fun with the boys – but how late he had come home. He had promised himself that he would not stay out too long, but when he had tried to leave at 1 am, Jack and Phil had teased him about becoming a house husband and dragged him and Terry off to an all-night men only bar. The sun was already up and sending long shadows across the street through the windows of the living room as he quietly took off his shoes. Just as he was about to start up the stairs, he heard a slight noise in the kitchen and froze. Though it was still quite early, he realised Gaby was awake and probably getting herself a light snack. Peeking around the door of the kitchen, he smiled softly; Gaby was humming quietly to herself, indicating that she was in a good mood. He saw her glance at the clock, shake her head and chuckle, Dino grinned to himself deciding there and then to surprise her. Watching her move around the kitchen slowly and effortlessly he took a slow deep breath. Gaby was wearing a short silk robe that he had bought for her while visiting a conference in Japan. Falling to mid thigh, Gaby wore it often, loving the feel of the soft material against her bare skin. As she turned slightly, Dino noticed that the sash around her waist was tied loosely making the robe open slightly, exposing the skin underneath. The quick glance caused Dino to inhale slightly, at the bar, his friends had tormented him by getting a voluptuous brunette to lap dance for him. His body had reacted of course, Dino loved all forms of female beauty, but he had refused to join in any of the games she had tried on him, rejecting her advances. After she had left their table the boys had teased him, saying he was becoming boring, but Dino had pointed out that what he had at home was far more attractive, physically, mentally and emotionally. Seeing Gaby reach into a higher cupboard for a bowl, he felt himself stirring as the robe rose higher, revealing the full length of Gaby's toned legs and the fact that – as usual in summer – she had slept completely nude. Gaby paused in her movements, glancing around quickly, her senses suddenly alert, but she saw nothing. Shaking her head, she returned her attention to her breakfast cereal when she was caught in a strong grip and a hand clamped roughly over her mouth. She was about to fight her way free when a heavily accented Spanish voice caused her to freeze. \"Scream and the kids will get it.\" Gaby closed her eyes, her mind screaming in panic – not for what she thought was about to happen, but for the safety of her twins . Dino, where the hell are you? The next moment her hands were tied roughly behind her back with what could only be a belt and she heard the sound of a zipper slowly descending. Fear washed over her briefly when an arm snaked around her waist, \"Damn, but you look good in the morning…\" As relief flowed through her body, she tried to turn to face her partner, but he wouldn't let her, \"Dino you bastard – you really scared me for a moment.\" \"Sorry sweetheart, but I couldn't risk you pushing me away…\" Dino's voice, deep and growling in her ear told Gaby all she needed to know. She sighed as his kisses moved through her hairline and down the side of her neck, \"As if I would do that…\" The kitchen descended into partial darkness as Dino reached out a hand and closed the blinds slightly at the same time as he gave a wicked chuckle. \"Glad to hear it…\" Pulling Gaby closer to him, her hips pulled in to his, he heard her gasp as he ran his fingers lightly across her skin, sending tremors in all directions. Kissing behind her ear, he could sense her anticipation as she felt how aroused he was in the small of her back, knowing that her eyes were closing in expectation. Not able to keep himself back any longer, he thrust himself inside her, as deeply as he could, hearing her hiss sharply in reaction to his move. Undoing the belt, he dropped it the floor, Gaby, her hands now free was able to brace herself against the kitchen unit, providing resistance to the movements he made. Catching Gaby's hips Dino held her tightly, groaning as he drove into her body, hearing her breathing becoming faster. He looped one arm around her waist to hold her even more tightly, the other beginning to move, at first tracing upwards from her waist to her breast where Dino gently pinched the nipple causing it to harden instantly. Gaby whimpered, not able to move Dino held her so tightly. Part of her was scared due to the complete lack of control that she had over the situation, but the adrenaline flowing through her body was heightening the experience. She gasped as Dino dropped his mouth to her shoulder and began slowly kissing toward the back of her neck, while one hand played with a breast and the other began to descend. While Gaby remained frozen in position, Dino exulted in the strength and power he had over her, loved the way she allowed him to dominate her – even though he knew his strength scared her at times – such as today. The whimper became a soft cry as his hand reached its lower destination and began to massage gently and he felt the shudder through her body, a corresponding shockwave passing through his own. He snarled in reaction and pushed Gaby forcibly downwards, her chest on the top of the unit, his hand between her shoulder blades preventing her from moving. The frustration that he had felt in the bar flowed through him and he used it, violently driving into Gaby until he could feel himself approaching the edge. Realising she was shaking, but not close to the edge herself brought him back to the moment and he released her so she could be a little more comfortable. Gaby hissed as the slight amount of freedom allowed her to change position slightly – causing Dino to catch her inside even more. As her body shuddered once more, she cried out, feeling herself lifting to a higher plane. Hearing her, Dino increased his efforts, attacking her body with his, begging for release for both of them. The next moment Gaby arched back into him, her body shaking and her spirit rising, carried into a plane of pure light. As she floated, she felt herself joined by another, a pair of arms gathering her to a body strong and powerful. Dino rested his head on Gaby's shoulder, he hadn't quite expected such a reaction this early in the morning, especially after a crazy night out. As his breathing returned to normal he withdrew from Gaby's body, turning her round gently. Seeing her flinch slightly as he placed his hands on her hips he sighed. \"Sorry baby, did I hurt you?\" Gaby chuckled softly, \"You were a little rough sweetheart – but I think I can cope with it.\" Dino sighed and gave her a tender kiss, \"I didn't mean it. It's just the boys...\" Gaby placed a finger on his lips and smiled, \"Its ok. You can make it up to me another time.\" Seeing the soft look in her eyes, Dino gave a rueful smile and then winked, \"How about later?\" Gaby chuckled, \"Later? And how are you going to manage that?\" Dino grinned, \"It's a Sunday, come back to bed and I'll show you…\" Wrapping his arms around her, Dino insistently began pushing Gaby backwards out of the kitchen, kissing her deeply. Gaby chuckled again, \"Maybe I should send you out with the boys more often.\" Dino returned the chuckle, and in a quick move slid an arm behind her knees, lifting her carefully and gently. Holding Gaby close, he took her into the bedroom praying that the twins would sleep a little longer.[Chapter 2] Walking into the Coffee Bar that lunch time after popping into the office, Dino grinned to see his three friends drowning their hangovers, or at least attempting to. Dragging over a nearby chair, he waved to the waiter and received a nod in return, soon delivered with a cup of hot black coffee – two sugars. Phil gave him an evil look, \"Don't you get hangovers anymore Dino – or did we drink double what you did?\" Dino gave him a self-satisfied look, \"I drank just as much as you, but I got the best hangover cure ever when I got home.\" Jack pulled a face, \"What – the Misses hit you with the frying pan to even things up?\" Dino smirked and winked suggestively at his friend, \"Better… Twice…\" Terry looked at the ceiling, \"You smug bastard Dino, I don't know what Gaby sees in you sometimes.\" He winked back at his friend, \"You too huh… There is something to be said for settling down… Not that these two would ever contemplate going there again.\" \"Damn right – Too much hassle mate.\" Phil rubbed his eyes, slowly returning to normal, he narrowed his eyes at something he could see over Dino's shoulder, \"Mind you – if she looked like that – I'd be tempted.\" Dino didn't move, knowing what Phil could see from the reflection in the mirror on the wall. Terry gave his old SAS friend an amused glance, \"Be careful what you say mate, I hear her other half is the possessive type. Wouldn't want you to get into a scrap on the first day of your holiday in New York.\" Phil rose to the bait, \"Take him with one arm behind my back.\" Dino grinned, but said nothing. The next moment Jackie walked into the Coffee shop, joining Terry and his friends. \"So, Gaby's managed to find a baby sitter for a few hours then Dino?\" Dino nodded, \"Yeah, I'm glad – gives us a chance to have a couple of quiet hours together. The girl next door is great with kids, but Gaby doesn't like to leave them too long.\" Jack chuckled, \"Never thought you'd be the type to settle down Dino – so when do we get to see this woman who tamed you?\" Dino smiled while Terry nearly choked on his coffee, \"Soon enough, she's meeting us here too.\" The next moment Phil stared, as the object of his attention came walking across the room towards them and slid her hands from Dino shoulders to his chest, giving him a soft kiss on the cheek before sitting down on the chair next to him. \"Still think you can take me Phil?\" Terry and Jack roared with laughter as Phil muttered a few words into his coffee, 'lucky bastard' was about all Gaby could hear, turning to Dino, she gave him an arch look, her lips curling slightly in amusement, \"You bragging again Honey? You really must stop doing that; it's just not fair you know.\" Dino chuckled, \"Can I help it if the woman in my life is still able to turn heads as she walks down the street even though she's had two kids?\" Pulling her chair close to his, he draped his arm around the back of her shoulders as he returned the kiss and introduced her to his friends. \"Jack, Phil… Gaby Santiago.\" Gaby gave them both a warm smile, inviting them around for dinner during their stay, Phil recovered from the wound to his pride and grinned his acceptance, \"if you can tame Dino – you must be at least a good cook.\" Gaby gave a wicked chuckle, \"Who says I tamed him? I like him just the way he is… Besides, if you speak to my brothers and a few friends – I was the one tamed – not Dino.\" The whole table laughed at her comment, Dino having at least the decency to blush a little. Jack quietened a little first, \"Santiago… The CO of my first unit was named Santiago – one hell of a guy. I wish I'd known him longer.\" Dino pulled Gaby close as her face dropped slightly, his right hand reaching for hers in comfort, she gave him a grateful look, \"Gabriel Santiago?\" as Jack nodded his answer she sighed, \"He was my father. I'm glad to know he is still remembered.\" Phil caught his breath a little staring at Gaby, \"If he was your father, that makes you…\" Dino interrupted sharply, \"Not any more Phil, her brother runs the organisation now, has done for quite a while.\" Phil apologised immediately, \"I didn't mean to give insult Dino – it's just that some thanks are in order – my cousin was rescued from a drug cartel by Gaby and her team. Thanks to her, he's back home with his family; we're in your debt Gaby – if ever there's anything I can do…\" Gaby blushed and smiled softly, \"Your thanks are enough Phil and the news that your cousin is able to carry on with his life. That is part of my past now, I have no intention of returning to it.\" Dino gave a quiet sigh of relief and his friends, noticing the concerned look on his face, changed the subject and it wasn't long before they were all laughing and joking again. However, Dino could not get rid of the chill that had descended over his body. && \"Are you ok?\" Gaby's voice pulled Dino from his thoughts and he sighed, they were taking a short walk through Central Park before returning home, but Phil's words were playing on his mind – as was Gaby's answer. \"I'm ok I guess, it's just…\" Gaby stopped and turned to face him, her hand placed softly on his cheek, instinctively knowing what he was thinking, \"Dino, Artemis is in the past, I don't need her in my life anymore. You know that.\" Dino wrapped his arms around her shoulders, \"I know, but she is still part of who you are and from time to time she pops up to say hi. I guess I'm just a little afraid…\" Gaby sighed, \"Dino, you're right – and I won't lie to you. Artemis is a part of me – she always will be, but it would take something really extreme for me to let her take over my life once more. She may pop up to say hi, but I will not give up what we have together for anything.\" Dino pulled her close holding her tightly, his forehead dropping to touch hers, the relief on his face evident. \"I know. I'm sorry.\" \"Don't be. We understand each other Dino and that's what's most important.\" She tucked her head into his chest after giving him a soft kiss, closing her eyes as she could feel his heartbeat through his skin, under her ear. For a moment they stood trapped by time, as if nothing around them moved. Dino made a swift decision – there was something that he wanted, something that he needed to do. He had been planning to wait until Gaby's birthday, but everything was so right at that moment… \"Gaby?\" She smiled, hearing the query in his voice, too comfortable to give him a verbal response, instead replying with a soft murmur, \"Mhm…\" \"Marry me…\" Gaby pulled back her eyes opening slightly in surprise, looking up into a pair of blue eyes soft and liquid, \"Did you just…?\" \"Ask you to marry me… Yes…\" For a moment she stared at him saying nothing, then Dino noticed the tears forming in her eyes as she snuggled back into his chest, a soft smile on her face. \"Yes…\" Dino grinned, dropping his lips to her forehead to give Gaby a soft kiss, he felt calmer and happier than ever. Placing his cheek on top of her head, he closed his eyes, ignoring everything around him but the woman in his arms. && 6 months later Dino sighed as he walked into the hotel room, finally he had managed to make a breakthrough in the negotiations for the hostages life. Glancing around he saw that the maid had cleaned up completely, including the twins toys that had been all over the floor when he had left that morning. As he sank slowly into the chair, his eyes closing slowly, he wished that Gaby was with him. Right now he could do with one of her shoulder massages, just to help him relax and switch off. Gaby however was with the family of the hostage in another part of the town, working with them quietly, helping the wife to remain calm and ease her stress. The twins would be with her, though not yet eighteen months old, they too played their part – albeit unconsciously. Many families of hostages would be defensive – some openly hostile, but as soon as Gaby appeared with the twins, almost all of them would change, becoming more open to his work, letting him do his job. At first he had not liked the idea of Gaby bringing the twins along, some countries were just not safe for his family, but, as Gaby pointed out, they were a team and worked best together. He refused to take her to central America and some other 'hot spots' and she accepted his decision immediately, knowing that he would be concerned about her safety which prevented him from doing his job. They were currently in Saudi Arabia, negotiating the release of a British journalist from a small Palestinian group who had wanted publicity for their cause. Dino was thankful that he had not been dealing with Hamas who were notoriously difficult to negotiate with. Picking up the phone, he called the family to speak to Gaby – if everything went to plan, the ransom money was currently being transferred into a private account and the kidnappers would release the hostage within the next six hours. If not – Alberto and his team were ready to move in and get the hostage out of the camp which was somewhere on the border between Israel and Syria. \"Hello?\" The soft Scottish accent held a tone of relief when Dino gave his name, but became puzzled when he asked for Gaby, \"Miss Santiago left about two hours ago Mr Bernadino – she said she was returning to the hotel.\" Dino frowned, it would only take 15 minutes for Gaby to travel the distance, apologizing to the journalist's wife for calling he hung up, wondering where Gaby could be. Standing up he decided to take a shower before dinner, thinking that maybe Gaby had decided to go shopping for a short time – knowing that after the hand over was complete they would be returning home. As he walked into their room he felt a cold chill travel down his spine, noticing that Gaby's brush and hair accessories were missing from the dresser. Glancing around, he saw that her suitcase was missing, as was that of the twins. Seized by panic at Gaby's disappearance, he almost missed the note stuck to the mirror. Good job Sweetheart. Must leave. Cons needs me at Home. ** Gaby stared out of the window, the twins sleeping peacefully beside her. She hoped Dino would not be too angry at her abrupt departure, but she was needed elsewhere. When she arrived at the hacienda she would call him and tell him what had happened if she could, but for the moment he needed to concentrate on the journalist and could not be distracted. Normally they would stay with the hostage until a counselor was available, but this time it would not happen, the journalist and his family would have to cope on their own for a while. There was someone who needed her more and she would not deny them help. The information she had was sketchy at best, but there was one thing apparent – she needed to get home as soon as possible. Consuella needed her help and she was not going to refuse her family. Looking down at her hands, she smiled softly at the sapphire on her finger and knew that a visit home would normally result in a lot of leg-pulling from her friends – not this time. Sighing deeply, she pulled the blanket over her shoulders knowing that she would not be able to sleep. && Dino nodded his head toward the man in the taxi and stepped forward, case in hand. Stepping into the car, he was not surprised when a sack was placed over his head and he was pushed to the seat – unable to see where he was going. Forcing himself to breathe calmly and slowly, he was able to remain still – something his captors appreciated. After a short journey, he was allowed to sit up, but in heavily accented English told not to remove the sack or he would never see the hostage again. Dino believed it – the Middle-Eastern groups were not known for their patience. Suddenly, the car stopped and he felt another man get in beside him before the car began to move again and the briefcase was pulled from his hand. He heard the locks click softly, before a voice proclaimed that all the paperwork was in order and that the funds could be moved on to their next account. After another short drive, he was bundled out of the car and the sack removed, his eyes blinking in the glare from the sun. The previous day and most of the night, he had waited impatiently for news of the journalist until he had received a call at 6am and for the last hour he had been sent all over the city before being ordered into the taxi. The voice told him to go and sit down on a nearby bench and he was surprised to see that he was in a park on the edge of Riyadh. The next moment another man, dressed in a dirty sweat suit joined him, hands bound behind his back. \"We were told not to move until we count to a hundred.\" Dino chuckled softly, \"Then we do as we're told my friend. I just hope we can get a taxi back to my hotel.\" Dino waited for five minutes to be sure they were safe and then removed the small blade he kept in his shoe. Slicing through the rope that bound the man's hands, he smiled, \"Welcome back to civilization.\" The journalist chuckled, \"Thanks, but I think I need to clean up before I go home – I smell like a camel…\" && Returning to the hotel, Dino noticed that a message had come through from Terry, 'Call me - urgent' . Dino sighed, he had spoken to Gaby a few hours earlier, just as she had arrived at the hacienda, all he knew was that she had arrived safely and was going to bed. She had asked for him to join her as soon as possible. Though her voice had seemed normal, Dino knew that something was up; his senses told him that she was worried – very worried, but he realized that she wouldn't speak about it over the phone. As the journalist took a shower he checked the time and swore to himself. It would be about two am in Argentina and Gaby was probably asleep, however, Terry might still be awake – New York was eight hours behind Riyadh making it about eleven pm. Sitting on the edge of the bed, he picked up the phone. \"Hey Terry, I'm all done here.\" His friend grinned for a moment, \"Good work mate – how's the journalist?\" \"Having a shower before I take him home. Is everything ok back there?\" Terry sighed, \"Yeah, the office is fine, look, get yourself to Argentina – Gaby left me a message for you, said it was urgent.\" \"She called me – I thought something was strange – do you know what's going on?\" \"Sort of – she couldn't say anything to you because she's not sure of the security at the hacienda.\" Dino went cold, \"Terry, what's going on?\" \"Gaby called me yesterday evening from a hotel in Buenos Aires, something's happened to the organization, I'm flying down too, she asked me to tell you to get on a flight ASAP. She'll fill us in when we get there.\" Dino swore, \"OK, let me get this man home to his family and I'll meet you there – when will you get in?\" \"Before you mate – I'm leaving in two hours, I'll wait for you at the airport.\" Putting the phone down, Dino began throwing his things into his suitcase when he paused; something Terry had said caught his attention. Since when has Gaby been concerned about security at the hacienda? ** Coming out of the arrivals lounge, it did not take long for Dino to spot Terry and Gonzalo, who were waiting near the doors. The concern on Terry's face was nothing compared to that of Gonzalo's, the former Apollo team leader was pale, his face drawn with worry. Shaking his hand, Dino followed them outside saying nothing until they were inside the car and on their way. \"Ok, so what happened?\" Gonzalo gripped the steering wheel, \"We had an operation go wrong three nights ago, Out of six men, only three are fit. Two are in our hospital suffering from serious injuries, Joachim may still not make it – he took a bullet to the chest, but is fighting.\" Dino turned pale, Joachim was now 2nd in Command of the Artemis team, behind Eduardo, Alvaro – his close friend - was in charge of the Apollo team having taken his brother's place the year before. Both were veterans of the organization having been part of Gaby's original team. \"That's five of the six accounted for. What about the last team member?\" Terry voiced Dino's question. Gonzalo's face looked troubled, looking in the mirror to see Terry's face he answered, his voice barely above a whisper. \"The last team member didn't come back – but we know he is alive. The kidnappers have him prisoner.\" Dino swore violently, \"What the hell happened?\" Gonzalo shrugged his shoulders, \"We're not quite sure, but there's something you should know – the team member that has been captured – it's Eduardo.\" Terry sank back into the seat of the car stunned, Dino turned slightly to stare out of the window, fear and anger gripping his body at the same time. He now knew why Gaby had left so abruptly from Riyadh and understood. && Walking into the hacienda, the first person he saw was Antonio looking extremely haggard. In Gaby's time he had originally run the Apollo team before stepping to one side and taking over the communications network. Now, he worked as an advisor, Gonzalo having replaced him a few months before. Dino walked over and gave him a brief hug, the older man's face showing his relief at Dino's appearance. \"How are the girls bearing up?\" Antonio sighed, \"Consuella is asleep, finally. She's a strong woman Dino – no hysterics or anything like that, but you can see that it's eating at her that Eduardo's been captured. The doctor wanted to give her something to help her sleep yesterday but couldn't.\" Terry was confused, \"Why not?\" \"Because she's 3 months pregnant…\" Dino shook his head, \"No wonder Gaby dropped everything to come here. Where is she?\" Antonio smiled softly, \"In your rooms – said she was going to take a nap now Consuella was asleep – the twins are sleeping too by the way.\" As Dino turned to walk down the corridor, he saw Antonio's face become apprehensive, \"I'm glad you're here Dino – maybe it'll stop her doing something crazy.\" Dino gave Antonio a startled look and moved quickly towards his and Gaby's rooms as Antonio took Terry to the guest quarter. Walking into their small living room, he heard a drawer closing in the bedroom and made his way there. As he went through the door he saw a sight that stopped him where he was, his blood turning to ice. Gaby was looking out of the window, a hard look on her face, not noticing that Dino had arrived so lost she was in her thoughts. He was not surprised by that, what worried him were her clothes. Normally, when they came to the hacienda, Gaby preferred linen dresses and slacks to keep the heat out in summer, switching to jeans and polo shirts in winter. At the moment she was wearing neither; her normal clothes were gone – replaced by the black fatigues T-shirt and waistcoat that she had worn as Artemis leader. ** \"Gaby?\" She turned and smiled as she saw him, before walking over to give him a soft welcoming kiss. \"I'm glad you're here. Now we can get this sorted. I didn't realize 'til we got here that something went wrong with a mission, all I knew was that Consuella needed me. The organization has been compromised. At least the hacienda is safe, Antonio did a complete security check.\" Dino's face hardened slightly, realizing Gaby's intentions, \"We? I don't think so sweetheart – you are not going to do anything but stay here.\" Gaby scowled back, \"We're talking about Eduardo Dino – I am not going to leave him in some camp…\" He interrupted her quickly, \"No, we aren't – but you are not going to be the one doing the job Gaby – you're needed here.\" She spun away from him and walked across the room, muttering under her breath, \"Damn it Dino I'm going… He's my brother.\" \"No… I'm not letting you go.\" He walked up behind her, wrapping his arms around her waist his head dropping to her shoulders. \"Your job is here Gaby, with the family – as always.\" Gaby turned, her eyes pleading with him, tears beginning to form, \"Dino, please…\" \"No.\" Dino's voice was soft, quiet but firm. \"You have to stay here; Consuella needs you more than anyone else.\" As the tears began to roll down her cheeks Dino knew he had won, \"Look, you have to stay – you know that, not only for Consuella, but the twins too.\" As she nodded her head in acquiescence he pulled her close, giving her as much comfort as he could. \"If it makes you feel better – I'll go with the team and get him out. Ok?\" Gaby sighed and nodded her head as she clung to Dino for support. A small part of her was annoyed at him for stopping her from taking part in the rescue mission, but truthfully she was relieved that she didn't need to go. It had been seven years since she had been out with the teams and though she had kept fit, it was not the same. As the sobs began to die away, Dino gently persuaded her to change out of her fatigues into something else. Then pulling her to the bed, he encouraged her to lie next to him caressing her cheek softly until she fell asleep. && Gaby awoke slowly, her eyes adjusting to the light. The sun was setting – and shining through the window, which was why she had awoken. Turning slightly, she saw that Dino had also fallen asleep, his chest rising and falling steadily. Sitting up slightly she rested her head on her hand, elbow supporting the weight and looked at him – a soft smile on her face. She wasn't surprised that he had fallen asleep, he must have been exhausted by the time he reached the hacienda, first the flight from Riyadh to Rome – then from there direct to Buenos Aires. She reached out with her other hand to gently caress his face, but pulled it back sharply not wanting to wake him just yet. As she gazed at his face in the amber light, she noticed the lines around his eyes and mouth, startled, she noticed the grey beginning to appear in his hair. She caught her breath for a moment, when had Dino started getting older? She hadn't noticed, he was always so full of life, even though there was eight years between them. Gaby sighed, she had turned forty the year before and he had gently teased her about it, she had risen to the challenge of course and the two of them had spent a half hour or so fooling around until he had given in. For a moment she felt cold, wondering if Dino should be joining the boys on tonight's operation. She hadn't asked him to do it – he had offered – no, insisted on going. She sighed, feeling guilty; would he have decided to go if she hadn't been dressed in her fatigues? For a moment she was lost in her thoughts and didn't notice that Dino was waking up. As he turned, the first thing he noticed was Gaby staring – almost straight through him, tears in her eyes. \"Hey, don't worry, we'll get him back…\" Gaby shook her head, \"It's not that… Are you sure you want to go?\" Dino sighed, \"Sweetheart – I decided to go as soon as Gonzalo told me that it was Eduardo who was captured – you don't think I'd leave his rescue to a bunch of amateurs do you? After all – we are family.\" His attempt at humour made Gaby give a weak smile, but he could see that she was still a little upset and pulled her close, \"It'll be ok, you'll see.\" Gaby buried her head into his shoulder feeling completely helpless, \"You will be careful won't you?\" Dino held her tightly, \"As careful as I can be sweetheart – I need to get your brother out in one piece remember – or Consuella will kill me.\" Gaby sighed and snuggled into his chest, happy to be able to share a quiet moment with him, she was sure the twins would be awake soon and she would definitely have her hands full then. The upside of two little ones running around was that Consuella was at least being distracted slightly by their antics. A soft knock at the door heralded Antonio, who had come to inform them that the team had started to arrive. Dino sighed and Gaby moved away, allowing him to get ready, when finished she moved close giving him a soft kiss. \"Don't be too much of a hero… The kids will be asking for their Daddy back.\" Dino smiled, \"Just make sure that they're not the only ones asking – and warm up your hands – I'll sure as hell want a massage when I get back.\" Gaby chuckled, \"Is that all? I think I can handle that.\" Dino grinned, \"I was thinking that it would be good for starters… Later… Well, we'll see.\" Giving her a deep kiss, he led Gaby out through the door and headed towards the Artemis operations room. ** Gaby smiled softly, Dino was playing with the twins – James trying to climb on his back, while Alessia squirmed beneath his tickling fingers. Watching him always made her smile, he was just as big a kid as they were. A little rough with James, but gentle with Alessia, who had very quickly learnt to wrap her father around her little finger. They had finished the team briefing and were passing the time until Dino had to leave with the team. As she watched him with their children, her thoughts became pensive. The team members that had gone with Eduardo had given a full report of what had happened and she couldn't see why the operation had been compromised. She went over and over the situation in her mind – something was wrong, but she couldn't see what it was. She swore quietly to herself, she was missing something – but what? A scream of hysterical laughter distracted her thoughts and she chuckled to see the twins on the floor between Dino's hands, trying to crawl away. Glancing at the clock she saw it was nearly time for him to leave, walking over, she knelt down giving Alessia the chance to escape when she touched Dino's shoulder. Dino grabbed both twins quickly, struggling to his feet as they giggled and squirmed to get away. Giving each a kiss on the forehead, he set them gently down on the floor of the room and grinned as they crawled away, each heading toward their favourite toys. At that moment, Maria walked in – the housekeeper had agreed to watch the twins for a short while so Gaby could go to the operations room and listen to what was going on. && Watching the team get onto the helicopter, Gaby couldn't help smiling slightly, her brother had been able to purchase the Black Hawk the year before and Antonio's younger brother was now a full member of the Artemis organisation. A hand on her shoulder made her turn slightly and she nodded at Terry, the noise from the rotor blades masking any sound. He was calm on the surface, but Gaby could tell that he was torn between staying and going. A hand lifted in farewell as the helicopter lifted and soon disappeared into the darkness, suddenly Gaby felt a moment of trepidation, reminded of her earlier disquiet. What was she missing? She caught up with Terry who had already started walking toward the communications centre. \"Would you rather be going or staying?\" Terry chuckled, \"Staying… Hanging onto the side of a helicopter while it flies over the jungles of South America doesn't have the appeal it used to – especially if people are shooting at you. Dino was always more of a dare-devil than I was.\" He pulled Gaby close and gave her a hug, \"Besides – he told me to look after you.\" Gaby gave him a shy glance, Terry was always the protective big brother when she was in New York, taking her side against Dino if he felt that his best friend was being a little unfair to his partner. Gaby was always careful not to let it happen if she could help it, sometimes Terry just liked to play Devil's Advocate. She was glad he was there though, it gave her someone to lean on, Dino was always there to fight her battles and she missed him when he was away, though with the twins she was usually busy these days. As they walked into the comms room, Antonio and Gonzalo were already in their positions, Gonzalo with a headset and microphone, Antonio sitting quietly nearby, ready with suggestions if necessary. ** \"40 minutes to drop off.\" Gaby had been surprised at how close the kidnappers camp was, just over an hour away by air it equated to about four hours by road – adding an extra hour for the bad terrain in that part of the country. Then another hour or two on foot to the camp, the team were being dropped off about half an hours hike away. Glancing at the monitors she felt proud at how far the organization had come, the most up-to-date communications system – part of which had been paid for by D&T; – and other advances had made Artemis the best K and R extraction team on the planet. As well as their own teams, Eduardo now also trained groups for other organizations, another source of income. The next 40 minutes were tense for those waiting at home, for a moment Gaby felt adrenaline beginning to burn through her system and sighed. Part of her wanted to be with the team helping to get Eduardo out, but Dino was right – she was needed here and after all, if she couldn't trust him to get her brother out, who could she trust? && The nearby speaker quietly gave the information, \"Apollo team clear of helicopter, preparing to move on.\" Gaby held her breath, the thought at the back of her mind gnawing away at her, she just couldn't shake it. Something wasn't right… && Dino paused and looked around carefully, Gaby had mentioned to him that something was bugging her and he trusted her instinct. The team had been moving quietly for almost 20 minutes and was near their target. Alvaro had become an excellent team leader through the experience gained with both Gaby and Eduardo, and was taking it slowly. Alvaro joined him, his voice giving away the concern the younger man had. \"I don't like it… It's quiet.\" Dino agreed, \"Too damn quiet. Not even the animals are stirring, I would expect an owl or something, but there's been nothing.\" && Gaby overheard Dino's comment and everything dropped into place, \"Get the helicopter back, FAST.\" Grabbing the microphone she keyed the switch, \"Dino, Alvaro get out of there – it's a trap!\" Her warning came too late, gunfire sounding over the speakers, shouts and calls from the Apollo team, keeping together, moving as a unit, defending each other as Eduardo had drilled them over and over again. ' What the fuck?' Gaby held her breath as Dino's comment was clearly heard over the air, followed by silence from his mike. Seeing the look on her face, Terry quickly moved close just in case. A few minutes later the gunfire stopped and the whole operations team could hear the sound of helicopter rotor blades. A sigh of relief went around the room, until a quick transmission was received, \"Icarus returning to base, five on board, no injuries.\" &&& Five. Five on board… The number burned through Gaby's mind, five, not six . Who was missing? Gonzalo held up his hand for silence. \"Boost the receiver, I can hear something.\" She didn't come. The boss said she would come to get her brother. Silence. then another voice. It doesn't matter, she will next time, you can be sure of it. The first, puzzled, how can you be so certain? Look who we caught… Gaby turned pale, not wanting to believe the thought that had entered her head. Turning to the radio tech. she asked a simple question. \"Whose mike is that?\" The tech dropped his head, not wishing to answer, it was Gonzalo who replied after a quick check of the display, \"Dino's…\" ** Gaby paced up and down the small briefing room, the men around her silent. Alvaro had made his report quietly and carefully, leaving nothing out. Antonio had taken over, asking a few questions, but one thing was abundantly clear – the Apollo team had walked right into a trap. Suddenly she stopped, a question coming to her mind, \"Is this what happened last time?\" Alvaro shook his head, \"No… We were on our way out with the hostage when we were caught by a couple of guards.\" She hesitated for a moment, \"and the protocol – leading up to the offer of extraction?\" Gonzalo gave her a curious look, \"Nothing out of the ordinary… We listened in as usual, for about 3 months – the negotiating team fell over themselves when we made our offer. I wasn't surprised, the kidnappers were holding out for $750,000.\" \"And at the bar? Usual routine?\" Antonio nodded, \"Very much so – apart from the fact that the negotiator asked for you instead of Carmen. Caesar chuckled when he told me.\" Gaby's eyes narrowed slightly, but she said nothing. Instead she paused for a moment her face becoming thoughtful. The men around her waited until she spoke. \"We're not going to get any answers tonight. I want everyone rested so we can meet back tomorrow and go through this one step at a time to find the answers we need.\" \"Antonio, did we receive a call about Eduardo?\" The older man nodded, \"Twenty four hours after the operation… That's when we decided to call you.\" Gaby acknowledged his reply, \"So we can assume they'll do the same for Dino… Terry, will you control the negotiations for me – I might say something that I'll regret later.\" Terry nodded, \"Thanks, we'll meet at… ten tomorrow morning. I want ideas, but we're not going anywhere just yet.\" She turned and left quickly, the members of the Apollo team and fellow Artemis colleagues slowly following –with the exception of Gonzalo and Antonio, who also stopped Terry. \"Something wrong Antonio?\" Antonio gave him a helpless look, his concern echoed by Gonzalo, \"Don't you see senor. She has been away from the teams for a long time… Yet she is able to command the whole organisation within minutes. What does that tell you?\" \"That she has the respect due to her as a former team leader…\" Gonzalo sighed, \"Perhaps… But her reaction is not what I expected. I thought she would be upset – possibly a little distraught at Dino's capture, however, apart from the shock she showed at first, Gaby has not shown us anything, no emotions at all.\" Terry was confused, \"Maybe she's just locking them away in front of us – she's not the hysterical type. What are you getting at?\" Antonio looked troubled, \"I think we need to watch her – I think she might try something after we hear the kidnapper's demands.\" && Gaby was in her room, Maria had put the twins to bed and they were sleeping soundly. Neither were fussy children and she knew they would sleep until morning. She had spent at least half an hour sitting next to them, watching over them while silent tears slid down her cheeks. Lying on the bed, she pulled Dino's pillow into her chest and buried her head into the soft yielding material. The tears soon began to flow once more, memories of the last seven years they had spent together, good and bad. She remembered Paris, the Solomons and Miami… The birth of the twins and the tenderness she had seen on his face when he had held them that first day. Further back, she remembered the secrets they had shared – opening their hearts to each other on the river bank. She cried for the emptiness now felt inside, the fear of what the kidnappers would do. It was as clear as day from the words she had overheard. Dino was not the target – neither was her brother. Eduardo had been taken as bait and Dino had walked into the trap – a trap that had been set for her… They would not be asking for a ransom… What would they do to her men…? Twenty minutes later the tears had dried out – she had nothing left. Most people would have given themselves over to exhaustion, but Gaby could not sleep. The thought of Dino and Eduardo held against their will stirred inside of her. She walked into the bathroom and washed the tears from her face, standing up she looked at herself in the mirror. Concern and fear for her loved ones had gone, taken away from her face by the tears, all that was left was pain… and anger. She glanced at the cots in the next room, her heart being torn in two. She had to think of the twins… but what would happen to Dino? Could she really ask more of the men she had worked with to go and get him out? Two of them had already suffered for her, were in the hospital as a result, was she really willing to sacrifice the lives of others? Alessia stirred in her sleep, Gaby at her side immediately. She glanced down at her daughter, seeing Dino's features on her face, the soft red hair slowly growing longer. How would her twins grow up without their father? She knew she would cope – and she had family who would help her, but it would not be the same. She hesitated, dropping a soft kiss onto two tiny foreheads, feeling the pain in her heart. Taking a deep breath Gaby made her decision, opening the drawer in the bedroom, she removed her clothes and started to get dressed.[Chapter 3] Antonio checked his watch, everyone was there with one very notable exception. Gaby. Maria had found a message that morning saying that she had gone out for an early ride – confirmed by the fact that Bianca was missing from her stable. He became concerned, Gaby was always punctual to a point where she would frown if anyone was late for something – indicating her displeasure. For her to be late today… Looking at Gonzalo and Alvaro he issued orders. \"Check the stables and the hacienda, I want to know if anyone has seen Gaby. Meet back here in fifteen minutes.\" Terry joined him as he started to walk to the range and weapons room. \"Antonio, what's going on?\" Antonio said nothing merely indicating that Terry should follow him. A few minutes later, they walked into the weapons room and began checking around, at first glance Terry could see nothing, but Antonio certainly could. \"Two M16's and eight boxes of ammunition missing, eight grenades and two smoke are also gone.\" Walking back towards the door he paused in front of the locker that had once been Gaby's. He closed his eyes for a moment before opening it. Terry inhaled sharply, where there had once been a combat bow and two full quivers of arrows there was now nothing, except a small envelope. Antonio took it out and opened it slowly. Don't come after me – somehow we have been compromised. I don't want anyone else to get hurt. Please, look after the twins… The paper dropped from Antonio's hand as the older man sunk to a bench nearby, his face a mixture of fear and panic. Terry picked up the note, his face turning pale when he saw the signature. Artemis &&& The room was quiet, which scared Terry most of all, especially considering there were six men inside. Besides himself, there was Antonio and Gonzalo, Alvaro and Esteban – Antonio's brother, the final person was 'Lolo' the senior gaucho. \"The small horse transport has gone – along with the four horses. The store room has definitely been raided, both food for the horses and the men is missing. Enough for a week.\" Antonio nodded his head and Lolo left, his duty done. \"So it seems that Gaby has decided to go in on foot as it were.\" Alvaro nodded. \"Which horses has she taken?\" Terry was surprised at the question, thinking it unimportant, but Antonio answered him. \"Bianca, Fuego, Pampeta and Diablo.\" Alvaro sighed. \"Bianca is an obvious choice – she's the only horse Dino will get on, Pampeta is Eduardo's favourite – she's not big – but surefooted. Fuego will go all day on just a small amount of food – she's probably taken him as a pack horse.\" Terry was curious, \"and Diablo?\" Antonio pulled a face, \"Bad tempered brute – kicks and bites like the devil he's named for, but in Gaby's hands he'll do anything – add to that, he's black…\" Alvaro continued, pointing at the map, \"My guess is that she'll use the transport to get the horses here and then follow this path up into the mountains. She knows exactly where the camp is.\" Esteban joined in, \"From the air, there are a couple of caves near this river, you can also see them marked on the map – but my guess is that there are a lot more, including some abandoned mines up there too. I wouldn't be surprised if she sets up a camp in one – well away from the kidnappers and uses the horses to get herself around.\" Terry shook his head. \"I can't believe that she'd go off alone like this – doesn't she trust anyone?\" Alvaro sighed, \"Of course she does, but she won't risk anyone else's lives to get Eduardo and Dino out – we had two failed rescue attempts – a couple of the guys injured because of it – she won't let it happen again. Most of us have families now.\" \"So does she…\" Antonio nodded, \"But the most important person in her family is in that camp… and she knows the twins are safe here and will be well cared for.\" Terry sighed, \"Will she do it? Can she get them out on her own?\" Gonzalo shrugged his shoulders, \"If you asked me that question ten years ago, I would say yes without hesitation, five years ago? Probably… Now? I don't know, she hasn't trained for a long time – I don't know how fit she is after having the twins…\" Antonio interrupted, \"Regardless of that, she's going in and she has a couple of things on her side. Anger – which she has always been able to control to her advantage, and surprise, I don't think they'll be expecting her.\" Terry pulled a face, \"and if she doesn't succeed?\" \"Knowing how much Dino means to her…? She'll die trying…\" ** Gaby reined in Diablo gently and checked her watch. The sun was almost at its highest point and she confirmed it was nearly midday. She had been on the move for nearly twelve hours and it was time to rest. Sending the others off to bed at about 11pm had helped her with her quickly formulated plan and she had moved fast – first colleting together what she needed and putting it in the small horse transport, which was now parked safely at the bottom of the valley. Three of the four horses had been in the paddocks around the house which meant that their disappearance would not be noticed straight away, only Bianca was stabled which had played into her hands perfectly. The message she had left behind meant that no-one would come looking for her until the time of the meeting. The other three horses were now laden down with food and other supplies, but she needed somewhere to camp where they could be kept out of sight. Knowing about the caves, she decided to check there first, but they were too open and well known. A few others nearby were too small, just as she was getting concerned she remembered the mines… The first entrance was completely blocked, but the second, thankfully was just wide enough for her to fit with the horses single file. She took them in one at a time, Fuego gave her a little trouble, not liking the darkness, but he soon came in when she took the others in first. A quick exploration revealed quite a large cavern slightly off to one side, which was dry and secure. First she saw to the horses, checking that each was securely tied with enough rope to lie down on the earth if they wished and gave them all a good feed. Then, switching off the flashlights she had used to provide some light, she opened up her sleeping bag and crawled inside, within minutes she was fast asleep. && Dino groaned, his head thumping somewhere just behind his right ear. Slowly he opened his eyes, glad to see that the light was fairly dim. \"Welcome back… You were out for a while.\" \"Jesus what the hell did I get hit with?\" The voice chuckled slightly, \"Probably a rifle butt. At least you didn't break anything.\" Dino shook the last traces of fog from his head and grinned, \"Good to see you too Ed, what happened to you?\" Eduardo pulled a face, \"I tried to break free and fell halfway down a bloody cliff – broke my leg. They set it fairly good though – so I think they want to keep me alive…\" Dino grinned at Eduardo's comment, \"You look in pretty good shape considering…\" Eduardo's face dropped, \"They're not kidnappers Dino… We were set up – even the hostage was a fake. Everyone else at the hacienda is perfectly safe – they're after Gaby.\" After a pause, Eduardo began to fill in Dino with what little information he had. How he had discovered that there were no hostages at the camp – unless he included himself. The group was small, only about two dozen people – who had been called in to guard the area. \"Who would go to all that trouble just to get their hands on Gaby?\" Eduardo shrugged his shoulders, about to answer when they heard people coming toward the hut they were in. Two men walked in, one keeping an eye on Eduardo while the other dragged Dino roughly to his feet. \"Time we got our proof of life senor…\" As Dino stumbled out into the light, he was able to take note of his surroundings – Eduardo had been right, this was not a camp of kidnappers. Apart from the hut he shared with Eduardo, there was only one other permanent building and that was made of stone. As he was dragged closer, a figure stepped out of the hut. Dino narrowed his eyes, there was no mistaking the pride on the face of the man standing in front of him, the sneer on his face showing his pleasure at Dino's predicament. \"Well, well, well. I was a little angry when I found out that Gaby had not fallen into our little trap, but your presence here explains the reason for that. It is of no matter – she will be here soon.\" Dino stared at the former dancer, \"What makes you think that Ramon, do you really think that Gaby is that stupid?\" He received a stinging backhand across his face in response before Ramon answered his query, \"Because for you and her brother's safety, she will do anything I ask.\" ** Gaby awoke slowly getting her bearings. Checking her watch she saw that it was well after sundown. Suddenly she felt cold, not from the decrease in temperature outside the mine, but fear. What the hell am I doing? I should have brought someone with me. She sighed and paused in her thoughts for a moment, remembering why she had chosen to come alone. No-one else must get hurt, no-one else's lives could be risked in this rescue. For a moment the fear resurfaced, now what do I do? She closed her eyes for a moment, images of her father, Eduardo and Dino displayed in her mind, none answered her question. She was about to give up her meditation when a woman's face appeared in front of her, blonde haired, with blue eyes like her own. Gaby smiled to herself, hello Mich … She sat quietly, remembering the discussions that she had had with the former MI5 assassin during her time in Miami a few years ago. Since then, Mich Bailey had been selected for the British team to compete at the 2012 Olympics and Gaby knew that her secret life was far behind her. The image smiled, when you have to work alone, you have to trust your senses… Build your information slowly and carefully – one false move could be your last… Play to your strengths, but be aware of your weaknesses. Don't let them bring you down. Gaby sighed, remembering what Mich had told her. Quietly she moved outside, allowing her eyes to become accustomed to the darkness. Fear once again gripped her, but she angrily pushed it to one side, not allowing it to control her. As she carefully looked around, she smiled softly, the night was her friend – always had been. Working at night was her strength, so she would use it, though she was out of practice. As she began to think, a presence started to flow through her, strengthening her resolve. Those who had taken her brother would pay; those who had taken Dino would suffer, she needed to be strong. Artemis would have the strength to see this mission through. Closing her eyes, Gaby finally released control of her spirit and embraced her alter ego completely. &&& Dino tried to keep control as another fist landed in his stomach. Fighting back would not help him or Eduardo. Gaby would already be incensed at what they had done to his face, he could feel the blood on his face drying, knowing that they had opened a cut above his eye. His lip also stung and he suspected that it was split too. Tensing himself as the guard drew back his arm for another punch, Dino was surprised to hear a female voice. \"Stop\" It was not a cry of mercy, or pity, but a strong command – a demand of obedience. Hearing it Dino became more concerned, the voice seemed familiar… \"So, you came instead of Gaby. What has happened to her? Has she become soft? Or do you control her?\" Dino felt sick, the voice dripped with sarcasm and loathing and he suddenly knew who had exposed the team. The brunette glided into his line of sight with a dancers grace and sat on the edge of the small table. He looked at her defiantly, not wanting to show any weakness, trying to ignore the fact that Carmen had kicked off a shoe and was sliding her foot slowly along Ramon's thigh. He said nothing, hoping that she would lose interest and he would be taken back to the hut, yet it was not to be. \"I told Ramon that she would not come – but he didn't listen, said that she would do anything for her family. I have been proven right. I'm so glad about that, because now we can both have what we want…\" Keeping his silence, Dino tried to ignore Carmen's moves as she slowly began to seduce the man sitting on the chair. \"My brother has always loved Gaby, worshipped the ground she walked on, but she treated him so badly. He would have given her everything, in the end, he found himself in jail because of his love for her, and it is all your fault…\" \"If you had not interfered, she would have eventually turned to him and his patience would have been rewarded. He came out of prison a broken man. I have restored him, given him back his pride.\" Dino felt a chill pass over him as he was forced to watch the woman in front of him making out with her own brother. He realized then that his greatest enemy was not Ramon, but his sister who was using her brother's obsession with Gaby to further her own twisted desires. The only thing he could not work out was the reason why. ** It was after dark when Dino was returned to the hut he shared with Eduardo, the younger man was almost asleep, but stirred when his sister's fiancé was roughly pushed inside the small room. After describing what he had seen Dino noticed a sad look crossing Eduardo's eyes. \"Carmen was one of Gaby's best friends at college, but when Gaby started being more successful, Carmen became jealous. Gaby tried to keep the friendship going, but it didn't work out. After a while anything that Gaby did, Carmen was right there too, trying to out do her.\" \"Whatever Gaby had, Carmen wanted – and because her family was well off, she generally got it.\" Dino sighed, \"If that's the case, now I know why she's happy that Gaby didn't come…\" Eduardo nodded, \"She wants you… I warn you Dino, she will do anything to get to you, or at least to get you away from Gaby.\" \"Well she can forget it, I don't want anything to do with her, she's sick… You won't believe what she just did…\" Eduardo gave Dino a haunted look, \"I can't believe we hired her, but she managed to convince me she was on the level… We didn't tell her why she was needed, just that we needed a top level Tango dancer for the club. If I'd known how twisted she really was…\" Dino moved closer to the man he counted as a brother and placed his hand on Eduardo's shoulder. \"Let it go. You did what you thought was right, and for the last six years she hasn't done anything, you weren't to know…\" Eduardo sighed, \"You're right, she was great until about 8 months ago, but even then she didn't give us any trouble. She just went a little quiet, looking back it was right about the same time Ramon was released from prison. She's been planning her revenge for a long time.\" Dino pulled a face, \"So any ideas what their plans are?\" Eduardo swallowed, \"Only what I overheard the guards saying while you were with Carmen and Ramon, I'm being held up for ransom… You're Carmen's prize.\" The red-head turned cold, \"What do you mean?\" \"They are going to ask for a small ransom to get me home – but Gaby has to deliver, they're going to trick her that then she'll be able to negotiate for your release. However, it's another trap – with you as bait to catch Gaby for Ramon. Carmen has no intention of letting you go.\" Both men fell silent, neither wanting to say anything further. && Gaby moved silently through the trees, she had left Diablo tied securely a mile or so away and cautiously moved towards her objective. The two guards she had already spotted were more concerned with what they would be paid than with keeping a watch and she was able to pass them easily. Pausing, she noticed that she was on the edge of a small clearing. Looking up, she smiled softly and quickly pulled herself into the tree. From her vantage point, she was able to use the night vision goggles she had brought with her to look around. It did not take her long to spot the hut and stone building that she guessed housed Dino and her brother – and the kidnap leaders respectively. She also spotted the tents that the guards used. Her lip curled in distaste, this group were just being paid to do a job and one job only. A short distance away she spotted two more guards having a cigarette and shook her head, security was so lax she could walk straight into the middle of the camp and they wouldn't even notice. However she paused, warily, she looked around again, it was just possible that this was another trap. Quietly she moved close to the wooden hut and listened carefully before making the quiet hoot of the Chaco owl. ** Eduardo sat up cautiously, without painkillers he was unable to sleep for long and woke several times a night, instead trying to take naps during the day. Listening carefully, he thought he was mistaken, when once again he heard the owl's call. Nudging Dino awake, he managed to tell his friend to remain silent and returned the call, \"Someone's here.\" Dino was stunned, \"Who in the hell would risk coming…\" He broke off staring at Eduardo whose face was just visible in the light of the lamp that marked the entrance to their door. He swallowed, not wanting to acknowledge the thought that had just entered his head. Eduardo gave him a wry smile, \"Well you can't deny the fact that she would do anything for you…\" Dino grimaced, \"I told her not to join the team, she has the kids to worry about…\" Eduardo sighed, in a quiet moment with his sister on an earlier visit he had found out just how much Dino meant to Gaby, how much she needed him in her life, though she loved her twins deeply. He was about to say something when a scratching noise at the back of the hut distracted him. The next moment a small package was pushed under the wall slats with a soft command. \"Eat.\" Eduardo smiled when the package revealed dried dates and biscuits; Ramon's people had only given him one meal a day, needing him to be tired and weak. The fruit and biscuits at least would keep away the hunger. Dino opened his mouth to speak, but Gaby was gone. && For two days Gaby kept to her routine, sleeping during the day and moving around at night. By then she had discovered that the mercenaries hired by Ramon were of the lowest level, untidy and disorganized. Only Carmen's information had helped them to surprise the team and now she herself was here at the camp they had no knowledge of what was happening within the organization. At night she would move carefully next to the hut and quickly pass on food to the two men inside – not able to give them much, but at least it would prevent them from becoming weak. She would disappear immediately afterwards not giving either of them the chance to speak, to ask her what was going on. Eduardo would accept her decision, she realized that, but Dino would be angry and this was not the time or the place for THAT discussion. That night, instead of moving around the area of the camp to complete her reconnaissance she returned to her temporary home at the mine. She needed water and would have to collect it in daylight or risk an accident. She also needed to see who had kidnapped the two most important men in her life – to decide what she would do. && Dino cursed silently, for the third day on the trot he had been dragged out of the hut and been bombarded by Ramon with questions about Gaby, what she liked, what she didn't like. He refused to answer any of them, which generally resulted in the ex-dancer losing his temper. However, this morning he wasn't taken into the stone building, but forced to sit on the floor outside. While he was sitting there, he heard a commotion from inside, several voices raised in anger. The next moment Raul, the 'leader' of the mercenary group paid to be guards was pushed out of the building, closely followed by Ramon. \"We should have heard something by now. They're stalling you – you promised us that we would get our money quickly – but they're not talking… You're a fool Ramon. You thought that by catching her brother and boyfriend Gaby Santiago would come crawling to you, begging for their release…\" Whatever else he had been about to say was lost as Ramon produced a pistol and shot him at close range before stepping back inside the stone building. Dino was startled and the move worried him, he guessed that Terry was probably handling the negotiations. The anger he could see on the man's face made Dino realize that the situation was going to get a whole lot worse… && Gaby froze at the sound of the gunshot, but then quickly moved into position in her tree to see what was going on. What she saw made her anger at the situation increase, quietly she returned to the ground and used the cover around her to get closer. ** Dino's skin began to crawl as Carmen walked closer to him, the smile on her face one of twisted sensuality. Three of the remaining guards had grabbed Raul's body and thrown it over the nearby cliff at her command. The others – wanting their money – had come to the camp to see what was going on and been dismayed by the turn of events – they were currently talking in hushed whispers, apart from the two that held him fast. \"Don't worry gentlemen, you'll get your money, I'll make sure of that.\" Turning slightly she demanded that one of them brought the camera from inside the building before moving to stand next to Dino. \"So Senor, you refuse to answer my brother's questions and your Australian friend refuses to let us speak to Gaby. That will change… When she sees this next picture, she'll change her mind.\" Chuckling to herself, she turned to the guards standing nearby. \"Strip him… Completely.\" && Glancing up from her position, Gaby's eyes narrowed when she identified Carmen as the woman walking around the camp, tight lipped she moved closer still when the guards started to cut away Dino's clothes. && Once removed of his clothing, Dino stood focusing on a point in the distance, stubbornly refusing to show any kind of reaction while Carmen walked around him, regarding him like the owner of a prize bull. \"Hmmm, I always wondered what Gaby found interesting in an older man like you, now I can see part of the attraction. Moving closer she whispered seductively in his ear, \"and I bet you know how to use it too…\" Dino said nothing, forcing himself to remain calm as Carmen gently ran her manicured nails slowly across his back. Around him the men began to stare wide-eyed as she removed her top, \"You will give in to me Dino – all men do… eventually…\" && Gaby paused, stunned to see Carmen slowly removing her clothes. As the woman softly kissed Dino's cheek, she reached across to the opposite arm and readied her bow – drawing an arrow from the quiver behind her back. Standing up, she slowly began to walk forward, a cruel smile crossing her lips when she realized all the guards were distracted by Carmen's performance. && Dino fought to keep his breathing slow and even, willing himself not to react to Carmen's moves. He stared into the distance not even closing his eyes as she tried to seduce him, make him react to what she was doing. After a couple of minutes she pulled back, a sneer across her face, \"So… You are going to resist, I am so glad… it gives me an excuse to try more… direct means.\" Dino's face remained impassive, but inside his nerves were screaming as Carmen's nails moved slowly down his chest, knowing that she was heading somewhere far more intimate. He was well aware that once there he would have severe problems remaining in control of his body. ** The next moment all hell let lose as Carmen screamed, pulling back from Dino, her face contorted in pain. Dino was stunned for a moment, and took a few seconds to register what had happened. The men around him had frozen in place, after initially thinking about diving for cover, many of them looking at Carmen in horror as she continued to cry with pain. It was then that he saw the black arrow through the palm of her hand. One by one they glanced up, their faces turning white as they were confronted by something they didn't expect. Dino turned slightly to his left and smiled softly at the sight that greeted him. Gaby stood, feet slightly apart, another arrow already hooked into her bow, though she had only drawn it back slightly and had not yet raised it to shooting height. The breeze that was gently blowing around the camp was playing with her hair, most of it back in a ponytail, though some had escaped to caress her face. She advanced slowly towards the group, signaling that they should move back, but said nothing until she reached Carmen. \"Don't ever touch what's mine…\" glancing toward Dino an amused smile crossed her face as she noted his physical reaction. \"Good to see you too Honey…\" && Dino chuckled and quickly availed himself of a shirt and trousers that he found in a nearby tent, and replacing his boots, though he would have to do without underwear for now. Carefully making sure he did not pass between the guards and Gaby, he unclipped the M15 which she was carrying across her back and took up a position slightly to one side. \"So gentlemen, who's next?\" Gaby's voice was ice cold and caused Dino to quickly glance at her in consternation. Immediately, the guards began begging for their lives, realizing that Gaby was completely serious in her intent. \"Leave – now… and I'll think about it. You have thirty seconds to get out of my sight or be used as target practice.\" The men needed no further persuasion – a couple grabbed canteens of water but all took themselves away as fast as they could move. \"Gaby…\" Dino's words were cut off as Ramon stepped outside, his face full of loathing. As he began to reach for his pistol Gaby released an arrow which went through the arm, causing him to cry out in agony. Dino turned toward the hut to get Eduardo, but Gaby did not move from her position, telling Carmen to join her brother. Dino felt a cold chill pass through his body when he saw the look in Gaby's eyes as she raised her bow once more. He was about to say something when Gaby began to speak. \"The two of you have made the biggest mistake of your lives… No-one will hurt any member of my family while I have the breath to protect them. Jail is too good for you. As is a quick death. Artemis protected those that were just, punished those that were not, as I am going to punish you.\" She released two arrows in quick succession before Dino could stop her, both finding their way through the chests of his captors, wounds that would lead to a slow death. Turning on her heel she called Dino to follow her, \"Let's go home, my work is done.\" && Dino followed his fiancée slowly trying to work out what was going on inside Gaby's mind. That she had taken action did not surprise him. The fact that she had come alone did. However, what concerned him most was the change in her character. Gaby had only ever killed in the course of her job – in the heat of combat – never had she removed someone from life in cold blood. However, today, he had seen her perform an act so cold blooded that it had stunned him to the core. Reaching the hut, Gaby flung open the door and smiled, \"Hey bro' time to go home.\" Seeing the makeshift splints and bandages around Eduardo's leg the smile disappeared from her face, replaced with anger. To stop her from taking further unnecessary action, Dino whispered quietly, reminding her that some of the guards might chance coming back. Her response was predictable, \"If they do, they'll regret it.\" But at the same time she moved forward to help her brother. && With Gaby taking point, they made slow progress to the place where she had left Diablo. \"Wait here, I'll be back soon.\" Dino sighed and he and Eduardo exchanged looks not quite wanting to express their feelings at that moment. Eduardo spoke first. \"What's going on Dino?\" The red-head shook his head, \"I don't know, I've never seen Gaby like this… Have you?\" Eduardo nodded, \"Once, the day we were told who had killed my father. She swore vengeance – and got it as you know – but the mood passed and she was herself again. Hopefully, when we get home she'll return to her normal self.\" \"I hope so to Eduardo, because I have to say, she scares me at the moment. I don't like what I'm seeing.\" ** Gaby returned in a short space of time, leading Pampeta and Bianca. The relief on the two men's faces clear to see when they knew they didn't have to walk home. Eduardo gritted his teeth as Dino and his sister helped him to mount Pampeta, but the little mare remained calm and stood still. Dino took a deep breath and clambered aboard Bianca. He was still wary of horses, and Bianca was still the only one he would get on, but he admitted to himself that this would be a far easier way to get home. Gaby led them slowly back to the mine where she had left Fuego munching on a food bag. Once there, she and Dino helped Eduardo to an easy position and took a good look at his leg. She grimaced and pulled a face. \"The splints have moved, the bone is going to set wrong if we don't deal with it quickly.\" Dino could only agree, in the half light of the hut, it had been difficult to see, but Eduardo's leg was bent into a bad angle and was not splinted properly. Gently Gaby removed the makeshift splints that the mercenaries had made and carefully checked her brother's leg. \"The muscle is already starting to heal, we'll have to pull the leg out to straighten it.\" Walking over to her small amount of stores, Gaby pulled out her medical kit. Able to use the horses for transport, she had been able to bring along a lot more than just gauze and plasters. Reaching in she decided to give Eduardo four strong painkillers and a couple of anti inflammatories. Dino raised an eyebrow, \"Four? Are you sure that's wise Gab?\" Gaby's face darkened in the dim light, \"I've got no choice, it's either that, or Eduardo's leg will never heal properly. He'll never be able to lead the teams again. Now are you going to help me or not?\" Dino dropped his head. Gaby's sharp tone of voice indicated a level of anger he had never seen before and it worried him. Following her to where Eduardo lay on a sleeping bag, he watched as she gave him the pills and encouraged him to get some sleep. With the cocktail of drugs in his system, Eduardo had little choice but to close his eyes. Gaby watched over him for a short time, checking his pulse every few minutes before calling Dino over. \"I don't have your strength, so you'll have to pull while I twist.\" The red-head nodded. He had been out in the field enough times to know what was needed. Carefully he caught hold of Eduardo's foot underneath the ankle and across the top of the bridge, just behind the toes. At Gaby's command, he pulled the foot slowly away, watching as Gaby started to turn the leg back into a straighter position. \"A little more Dino, and I think we're done.\" He gritted his teeth and did as she asked, seeing the perspiration on her forehead as she continued in her own task. Suddenly he felt the muscle tear slightly as the bone slid into place and heard Gaby sigh with relief. Quickly the two of them splinted the bone correctly and wrapped Eduardo in the sleeping bag to ensure he kept warm. Glancing up at Dino she pointed to another pack. \"There are two more sleeping bags there, can you get them out? I'll prepare something to eat.\" While he was doing as she asked, Dino studied his fiancée carefully. There was something about her that had definitely changed. Her actions at the camp had stunned him, though he had believed that she had done it out of pure rage, now he wasn't so sure. Quietly he whispered her name, but got no response even though he had seen her eyes flick towards him. A thought came into his mind as he finished what he was doing. \"Artemis?\" Gaby looked up, \"Yes?\" His blood turned cold as she looked at him, realizing then that the warmth and softness in her eyes had disappeared. He tried to keep his feelings to himself. \"Now what?\" \"We stay here for a day, maybe two. It depends on Eduardo, I don't want to move him too soon.\" Dino nodded, it was a good idea considering the terrain they would have to cover, unless… \"Can't you call up the helicopter and fly him out? He could get to the hospital far quicker.\" Gaby looked at him, her lip curled scornfully, \"Call them up with what? The only radio I have doesn't have the range to reach the hacienda. The rest were all locked away, and I didn't have time to look for the key.\" Dino kept the shock from showing on his face, understanding then, that not only had Gaby come alone, but that the rest of the organization had no idea of what was going on. It worried him even more. ** \"Any news?\" Terry shook his head at Antonio's question and saw the despair cross the man's face. \"We haven't heard anything from Gaby at all, and the kidnappers haven't called in twenty-four hours. Now what do we do?\" \"This is where the Artemis organization would normally step in…\" Alvaro's voice sounded bitter in its defeat. Terry and Antonio regarded him carefully, not saying anything for a moment. The younger man looked broken, all his confidence gone. The two older men exchanged looks and Terry could see the concern on Antonio's face. \"We have to give her time Alvaro, you know that.\" \"But if she needs help? How will we know? She only has a short range radio with her.\" Antonio gave the Apollo team leader a startled look and stood up, moving quickly across the room. Picking up the phone, he made a quick call to his brother. \"Get Icarus ready to fly first thing tomorrow morning…\" Motioning to the two friends, he led them to the communications area. && Late the following day, Dino watched Gaby quietly as she checked Eduardo, as far as he could tell, she hadn't slept more than a couple of hours commanding him to get some sleep. He hadn't argued with her at all, the food she had made had warmed him from inside and, wrapped in the sleeping bag, exhaustion had claimed him. At some point during the night, he had awoken from a deep sleep, hearing voices. Both were female, both different. One strong and commanding, the other softer, more gentle, both had pulled at his heart as he heard confirmation of his deepest, darkest thoughts, that once again Artemis had gained control of Gaby. He heard a quiet noise outside and turned his head slightly to listen. Standing up, he walked to the mine entrance, though he remained hidden. Stunned, he saw the Black Hawk helicopter flying a search pattern in the valley below and returned inside. \"Icarus is here.\" Gaby looked up, her eyes narrowing, \"How do you know it's them?\" \"Who else would it be? I don't know anyone this close to the mountains that owns a Black Hawk, do you?\" He bit his lip a little, realizing he'd allowed a little anger to escape. Gaby said nothing, but reached into the pack nearby and tossed him the radio. \"You know which signal to use.\" Dino sighed and returned to the mine entrance, selecting the frequency that the teams used for an emergency. Without noticing, he used her callsign. \"Icarus, this is Artemis, do you read?\" The helicopter paused in mid-air, hovering in its position and Dino heard Esteban's relieved voice. \"Artemis, this is Icarus, reading you strength 5.\" \"Artemis reports three personnel accounted for, one requiring medical evacuation.\" Esteban returned the message, informing Dino that he would return shortly with a medical crew. Walking inside, he saw Gaby regarding him through narrowed eyes. \"Well?\" \"Icarus was flying a search pattern, he's returning soon with a medical crew to take Eduardo out.\" She bristled slightly, but nodded her head, \"Good. I'll rest here for tonight and then set out first thing tomorrow morning. I can be back at the hacienda by nightfall.\" Dino paused and looked at her carefully, noting the anger that had come to the surface but said nothing. Within an hour, the helicopter returned and a medical crew checked Eduardo quickly. He had regained consciousness and was able to answer their questions. As they carried Eduardo carefully in the stretcher, Dino remained close to his friend, watching as Gaby returned to collect some of the packs that were inside. ** While Gaby was inside the mine, Eduardo grasped Dino's hand. \"Stay with her, there's something going on and if she's left alone I hate to think what might happen.\" After Eduardo was taken into the helicopter, Dino quickly helped the rest of the team put the excess equipment on board the aircraft, noting that Gaby had only kept enough for herself. He retrieved some food and equipment for himself and remained outside while the helicopter took off. Walking back inside, he had a shock as Gaby faced him with a gun. \"Gab, are you ok?\" Her eyes flickered as recognition crossed her face and she lowered the gun, \"Dino, I thought you had gone with the helicopter. You gave me a fright. Why did you stay behind? You need to get checked out too.\" Dino acknowledged her point, \"Yes, but it's only a few minor scratches, it can wait till we get back.\" Gaby came closer, her face softening slightly, \"I'd hardly call the scratch above your eye minor.\" Dino shrugged his shoulders, showing he wasn't really bothered, \"I'd rather stay with you.\" Her face became dark, \"It wasn't necessary, I can manage on my own.\" Dino became cautious as he noticed Gaby's mood change and answered her softly, \"I didn't say I stayed to help you, I just wanted to be with you. Is that a problem?\" Gaby said nothing for a moment and Dino noticed the muscle in her cheek twitch in the dim light. She turned away from him towards the packs, \"I guess not. Well, seeing as you are here, how about you get some more water?\" Dino acquiesced to her request and used the short walk to the river to collect his thoughts. He had always known that Gaby's 'Artemis' half was always around, but as their relationship had grown stronger and especially after the twins had been born, the alter ego had faded further into the background. Now however, she was back in full force. Gaby herself had said that she didn't want Artemis to return, so what had happened? It was a question that would have to wait until they returned to civilization, because he didn't think Gaby would give him an answer – even if she was able to. Arriving back, he noticed that Gaby had opened up the sleeping bags and was preparing food. In the half light he smiled softly, under any other circumstances, this would have been an enjoyable evening. He and Gaby had occasionally been camping over a long weekend, before they had any chance to have a proper holiday and he missed the closeness they had shared on those short excursions. However, the look in Gaby's eyes this evening made him back off slightly. The usual softness was gone, but at least the anger had also receded, replaced by a look of burning intensity that made him wonder what she was thinking about. He set the canteens of water next to her and retreated to the opposite side of the burner, able to watch her face in the light, but keeping a space between them, not wanting to antagonize her in any way. He watched as she put purifying tablets in one canteen and used the water from the other to half fill the saucepan in front of her. As it began to boil, he realized she was making soup and smiled as she poured the contents from the packet and began stirring the mixture. \"What flavour? Smells good.\" Gaby smiled softly, which seemed oddly out of place considering the mood she had been in, \"You should know, you always managed to guess before…\" \"Chicken then… With vegetables…\" Gaby chuckled, confusing him further. Within a few moments, the two of them were sitting cross legged from each other, eating the soup with hunks of fresh bread that the medics had brought along. The silence became more companionable and Dino was glad he had remained to keep her company. Checking the tins she had in the pack Gaby gave Dino an arch look, \"We're in luck, I managed to grab some fruit salad.\" The red-head eyed her carefully though he gave her a warm smile, something wasn't quite right. It was as if she was deliberately being soft and calm, looking more closely, he saw a flicker in her eyes and knew then that she was planning. \"What's on your mind Gab?\" She smiled, \"Nothing…\" Dino raised an eyebrow and she chuckled before moving to her sleeping bag next to him. \"Let's get some sleep shall we?\" ** Dino woke suddenly, sensing movement near him. The rest he had the day before had recharged his body and he quickly became alert. Gaby was quietly moving around using a shaded lamp to see where she was going. With a start, he noticed that all of the horses were tacked up and ready to go. \"What's going on?\" Gaby jumped, startled for a moment. \"It's soon going to be dawn, I told you that we needed to get an early start.\" Checking his watch, Dino saw that Gaby was right, dawn was only half an hour away, but he was still wary. Standing up, he walked to stand next to her. \"It must have taken you the best part of an hour to do this, if you'd allowed me to pack while you prepared the horses, we would have been ready just as quickly. What's the rush?\" Gaby's voice was sharp, \"You needed to rest.\" Dino felt his anger rising, \"and you didn't? Come on Gab, I know you've had less sleep than I have, now what is going on?\" Glancing around, his eyes narrowed as they landed on Bianca. The grey mare was saddled – but he could see a map sticking out of the saddlebag. Catching Gaby by the arm he pulled her across to the horse and pulled out the map. A quick glance at the message written there inflamed his temper further. \"You were going to leave without me…\" \"No…\" Gaby's face denied his accusation, but her eyes told a different story. Dino looked at the map, seeing that the route down to the horsebox was well marked. \"You left me a way home, but you had no intention of returning to the hacienda with me…\" Gaby said nothing for a moment, but when she spoke, her voice had an edge to it. \"I need some time to myself. Some time to think, it will only take me two days to get home on horseback.\" Dino turned cold, \"To think about what Gab… To think about us? To think about your family? What about the twins? Are you going to leave them too?\" Gaby's face changed abruptly, a tear sliding down her cheek at his harsh words. Dino sighed with relief as he saw that her softer side came to the fore. Within moments however, Artemis was back, fighting for control. Dino held Gaby tightly, knowing that she would escape him if he wasn't careful. She snarled with anger, \"Let me go Dino. I have to decide what is to happen to the organization now.\" \"No you don't, Eduardo is injured, but that won't be for long. Antonio and Gonzalo are fully capable of managing things at the moment.\" She struggled, fighting him again, but Dino held firm, trying to ignore the nails raking at his arms. Seizing a lull in her actions, he spun her around to look at him and saw the intensity burning in her eyes. He was suddenly reminded of the first evening they had spent alone together, when basic need had kicked in for both of them. Maybe it was a way out…[Chapter 4] Grasping Gaby's head tightly, his lips crashed down onto hers, deliberately bruising in their force. His other arm wrapped around her hips, pulling her so tightly to him, he could lock one leg behind hers, preventing her escape. She tore her lips away, anger burning in her eyes, yet Artemis was a creature that Dino knew well and he knew how to inflame her desire. \"Long time no see babe, did you miss me?\" His voice growled in her ear as his hands tightened in her hair. Pulling her head back, Dino kissed up her throat, nipping at the skin, hearing the sharp intake of breath at his action. He felt the adrenaline burning through his body, the challenge exciting him as he knew it would. His reaction would cause a similar one in Gaby, but he hoped it would help him to gain power, gain control over the woman he loved. Dino knew he had to be careful. While Artemis was a fighter, Gaby was not and any forceful treatment would cause her to retreat, giving her alter ego more power. Finding the line was not going to be easy. He winced as a pair of nails dug into his forearm. Artemis was still the one in charge. A pair of burning lips met his own, inviting him to take things to the next level. If it was just Gaby, he would have done so, but he was not only dealing with her, Artemis was a control freak and she had to make the first move. He responded to the kiss and began to massage the base of her spine, yet did nothing more. Kisses moved along his jaw, making him close his eyes in anticipation as they reached his ear. \"C'mon Dino, thought you wanted to play?\" He pushed his fingers into the muscles at the base of her spine, causing her to lean into him, \"I am playing…\" ** A wicked chuckle reached his ears as she began to kiss him once more, her tongue teasing his lips, but entering no further. She broke off the kiss, looking at him through lowered lashes, a look that both excited him, but warned him that Artemis was in total control. He played the next move, dropping suddenly to the floor, bringing her down next to him. Kissing the exposed neck he whispered into her ear, \"Is this what you had in mind?\" \"Not exactly,\" Gaby rolled him to his back and Dino chuckled as she leant on him, relief flowing through his body. Artemis was no longer interested in leaving. She misinterpreted the sigh and her lip curled in satisfaction before she dropped her head, teasing him with kisses that promised but did not quite deliver. Dino continued his massage, slowly but surely easing her top out of her trousers, from the look in her eyes, he knew she was aware of the move, but not threatened by it. He flicked an eyebrow suggestively upwards and smiled when Gaby's mouth twisted into an amused grin. The next moment the top came free of the trousers and his fingers touched smooth skin, slowly he closed his eyes, letting his hands drift around her back and ribs. The light contact intoxicated him and he needed to regain control of himself. Though he adored Gaby's persona, he had to admit that he liked the way Artemis challenged him, abruptly, a thought came to his mind, had he triggered Artemis' return in some way? His hesitation caused Gaby to chuckle and she moved to straddle his waist, sliding her hands under his shirt, caressing the skin on his chest. Finding a nipple, she pinched it slightly, causing Dino to sit up in reaction. Pulling off his shirt, he used the movement to wrap his arms around her and pull her close, his lips meeting hers, tongue exploring gently. He felt Gaby's hand slide through his hair and allowed himself a little satisfaction, knowing he had her full attention. He changed tactics slightly, Artemis would want him to be strong, tough, challenging, but he knew Gaby loved his strength delivered in a more tender way. He pulled off her top, but instead of challenging her by dropping to the floor and turning her on her back, he floated a line of kisses along her shoulder and up her throat. A shiver rippled across Gaby's skin as she hissed softly at the unexpected move. Reaching out, Dino caught hold of his sleeping bag and pulled it behind him before lying back, drawing Gaby slowly with him. Her eyes gleamed in the dim light, curious as to his course of action. He chuckled softly, \"Don't you remember our first night together…?\" A sensual smile spread across Gaby's mouth as she dropped her head to whisper in his ear, \"Of course, how could I ever forget…\" As their lips met once more Dino could sense the change in his partner, the anger was gone, replaced by something much more manageable – and much more intense. His lips pulled at hers and he could feel her fingers kneading the muscles across his shoulders. Rolling over, his lips began a slow journey down her body, inch by inch, knowing it would fuel Artemis' desire, but also awaken the soft sensuality Gaby had. A soft moan reached his ears as he reached her stomach, so he paused there a little, leaving a few moist kisses before blowing gently across the skin. Gaby shivered. Dino was taking his time and she loved it. Her Artemis self writhed within her, wanting more, but the old memory had triggered something that made her stay quiet. Dino chuckled, continuing his soft slow exploration. The next moment Gaby had pulled his head back to her face, eyes flashing. \"Stop fooling around Dino…\" He cursed inside, Artemis was back, he trailed his lips along her jaw, \"you're the one who wanted to play…\" She was about to answer him, when he caressed a nipple through the fabric of her bra, feeling it harden instantly under his touch. Carefully he eased the soft flesh out from the material that held it and began to suckle, seeing her eyes close in pleasure. His hands quickly found and undid the clasp at the back, diverting her attention away from the conversation. Trailing the very tip of his tongue from one nipple to the other, he heard the sigh whisper from her mouth, felt her hands kneading his back and fought himself to take his time, though he wanted to take things to the next level. Gaby's mind screamed for more, though her emotional state was completely unstable, not knowing whether to encourage Dino to continue, or fight him for control. She was alternately loving and hating what he was doing though both sides were in agreement on one thing – they did not want him to stop. For a moment, her calmer quieter self would be in control, her fingers caressing Dino's back lightly, then Artemis would take over, her back arching into Dino's body, challenging him to do more. She slid her hands slowly down his back, under the waistband of his trousers, hearing the catch in his breath. For a moment Gaby paused, it was rare that she would take the lead, preferring Dino to make the moves. She shared her love with him of course, but at first she would just wait and see what he would do, loving the way he made her feel. She could feel Artemis' cold strength flowing through her, and, contrastingly, the burning passion that her alter ego also had. She felt pity for that alter ego, without Dino's help, she would have remained a cold loveless shadow, receiving only physical relief without the emotional bond. She slowly slid her hands around to the front of his trousers, undoing the clasp and then the zip. Dino shivered at her touch and she realized just how much he had been holding back. Sliding the trousers over his hips, she chuckled when she remembered he'd not been able to find any underwear at the camp, and gently began to stroke the tender flesh that fell into her hand. Dino lifted off her body almost immediately in reaction to her move and she took full advantage, pushing him over on to his back. Lying partially on his chest, she began to devour him with soft slow kisses. First along the jaw and down the throat past his Adam's apple, though she played with it for a moment. Arriving at the centre of his chest, she hesitated, feeling Dino's fingers opening her own trousers and reaching inside. She continued slowly, noticing that he waited, increasing her own anticipation. Reaching her destination, she began to kiss softly, feeling an equally soft contact in her own intimate place. Dino shivered again, her move had surprised him a little, so like Artemis in its passion, yet with Gaby's tender touch, he found it difficult to concentrate. As Gaby increased the intensity, so did he, feeling the heat in her body rising. Gaby enveloped him slowly, her tongue massaging the ridge where he was most sensitive. Dino gasped and returned the touch, causing her to swallow, pulling him more deeply into her mouth. His whole body shuddered with the need to be part of her, to share himself with her. Removing his hand, he sat up, twisting his body to bring Gaby back down beside him. \"Playtime's over…\" He dropped his lips to hers, distracting her attention with hot kisses that invited her to join him as his hands pushed the trousers past the hips at the same time using his feet to finish undressing himself. Once free of the clothing, he eased himself into her body, at the same time burying his head into her neck, gently sucking on the skin. Gaby arched into him, hands pulling at his ass, her breathing deep. She hissed as he withdrew slightly before pushing deeper, his arms wrapped tightly around her. Locking his legs around hers, he rolled to his back and then pushed himself upright into a sitting position, feeling Gaby slide her legs behind his back. He grinned at her, seeing the returning blush on her cheeks, the Lotus was one of their favourites, able to share kisses, caresses, whatever they wished, sharing their love completely. As they rocked together Gaby shuddered, she had barely slept and was running on pure adrenaline. Her nerves, already on edge, were now being attacked from a completely different direction. Dino, weak from lack of food as well as sleep was not much better, but their love for each other lent them strength and energy. Gaby arched back a little as the sensations attacked her body, gasping at the same time. The change in position affected Dino too, and the way her head had dropped back had exposed her throat, an invitation he was unable to resist. Kissing her neck and under her jaw, he felt Gaby react again, pushing into him a little more forcefully, a moan coming from her throat. He hissed as his own body began to shudder in reply and knew that neither of them could last much longer. Gently he rolled the two of them over 'til Gaby was on her back, he smiled at her, staring into a pair of deep blue eyes that threatened to drown him. Moving his hips a little more, he gasped when she tightened against him, locking her legs behind his thighs. The eyes began to burn with the intensity that Gaby was feeling and the next moment he felt her nails in his back, causing him to cry out, partly in pleasure, partly in pain. Dino could not wait any longer, whether it was the exhaustion, or the battle of wills, he knew he could not resist Gaby's Artemis self any longer. He shuddered, hearing her wicked chuckle, \"Got You…\" He could not deny that she was right, the next moment feeling the unique pain that also came with pleasure, a release no less explosive for its gratification. He was not going to let her win though, keeping his rhythm, he drove as deeply as he could again and again, feeling her shaking underneath him, hearing her gasping his name out loud. He caught her as she came up into his arms, but did not stop pushing, holding her tightly to his body, determined to share this moment with her. His body shook with the effort he was demanding and perspiration ran down his back when suddenly he felt Gaby lifting underneath him, tears pouring out of her eyes in her own final moment of ecstasy. He paused, resting lightly on her body, their foreheads touching and dropped a tender kiss to her lips. Lifting slightly, he glanced down and grinned, the eyes no longer burning with intensity, but soft and happy. It may have been Artemis who caught him, but it was Gaby he held in this moment. Carefully he withdrew, his muscles screaming at the abuse he had just inflicted on them. Glancing around, he spotted the other sleeping bag and pulled it towards him before flicking it over the two of them. Lying on his back, he drew Gaby close, loving the way she curled into him, her head on his chest. Tenderly he caressed her arm, the movement soothing for both of them, each remaining silent. Within seconds, exhaustion claimed them. ","Summary":" Dino let himself quietly into the house, feeling slightly guilty.

For those of you that like Dino - don't worry - things are not as bad as they may seem... Enjoy Lucy Gaby stared out of the small oval window at the night-time Manhattan skyline as the plane lifted off the ground, tears streaming down her face Gaby stared out of the small oval window at the night-time Manhattan skyline as the plane lifted off the ground, tears streaming down her face. She had come to love New York and it had certainly given her new friends and a new purpose in life. Yet for all that it had done for her, she could no longer stay because the one thing that she needed more than anything else was over. Dino no longer loved her. Thinking of him set off a new round of tears, but she stayed silent, not wanting to attract the attention of the stewardess. She still couldn't work out what had happened, why things had changed so much. For two years the two of them had grown together, Gaby knowing that Dino needed time after losing Cass, not pushing him into anything, though in her own heart she knew there would never be another man in her life. Dino gave her everything she needed. Then, six months ago, things had started to go wrong, first at home, little things then bigger things. Then the problems had started in the office, until at the meeting she had had last week with Dino and Terry, he had put her down harshly for a suggestion she had made. Even Terry had been stunned at Dino's attack, not knowing what to say. The following day, Dino had left for Europe, the negotiating team out there had run into trouble and needed help. In the past, she had joined him, helping the family of the victim, talking to them, lending a shoulder to cry on where necessary. Dino had said that they were a good team, but this time, he had told her she wasn't needed. When she opened her mouth to ask why, he had angrily retorted that he didn't want her there. Once again she tried to make sense of things in her mind. What had happened to make him so angry – almost violent? What had she done? Again she tried to see into the past, to see where she had made her mistakes. Again she came up with no answers. She had tried to fit in with his life, become the woman that he wanted her to be and yet, it had all been for nothing. She had spoken to Jackie several times – one person who knew Dino well, but Jackie could not give her answers and was also mystified as to Dino's more recent behaviour, admitting that it was not like him. Pulling the blanket up around her shoulders, she continued to stare out of the window, the tears continuing to flow. She had tried so hard to fix things that she had no energy left to fight anymore, the only thing that was left was to run… Gaby had almost never run away from anything in her life. Hidden, yes, run… Apart from only one other occasion, never, it was not in her nature, but here she was running away from the place she considered home, running away from the man she loved, running to the only place that might help to heal her heart. It had been her sanctuary before, and would be again… Argentina… & Eduardo was troubled; he had received a call from Gaby to say she was on her way. Initially, he had been happy, she and Dino made a point of coming to the hacienda at least once a year, but when he picked her up from the airport and saw her face, he realized that things were different. After a quiet drive, Gaby staring out of the window, they had arrived home. Consuella had come running out to give Gaby a hug, welcoming her home. Later as they were relaxing on the sofa, she and Eduardo had spoken quietly, after Gaby had made her excuses and retired to her rooms. \"So, what's wrong? Why won't she speak to me? We've always been able to talk.\" Consuella sighed and snuggled into her husband, \"All I can get out of her is that Dino no longer loves her… and that she won't go back…\" \"Should I talk to her?\" Consuella shook her head, \"Not for now, leave her alone, she's confused and upset. She can't work out what went wrong. One thing I do know… She's heartbroken.\" Eduardo swore to himself but said nothing, when Dino and Gaby had come to visit, they were inseparable and Gaby had come in for a lot of teasing from the Artemis teams. She had softened considerably, the teams saying that she had been 'tamed' at last. Gaby had taken it all in fun and laughed, Eduardo relieved to see her so happy. Thinking for a moment, he knew Gaby would speak to him in her own time and that he shouldn't push her for answers. He resolved to make a call the following morning, Gaby wouldn't talk to him yet, but he wanted answers and he knew where he might get some… Terry Thorne. \"I'm sorry Eduardo, I really don't know what's going on.\" Terry was almost as confused as Eduardo was. He knew how much Dino loved Gaby… teased him about it… To the extent that at one point he had taken to humming the wedding march when Gaby was not around… receiving a few hand made missiles for his trouble – but it was worth it… Just to see the blush on Dino's face. Eduardo pulled a face, \"Can't you tell me anything?\" Terry sighed, \"I know it probably started about 6 months ago, but I only really started to notice when they started bringing their arguments to the office. Jackie had said that Gaby was upset about something, but she couldn't work it out.\" \"How do you mean?\" \"Something about the way Dino was treating her at home… I didn't believe it at first, but when it first happened in the office a couple of months ago, I was stunned.\" Eduardo's voice became hard, \"Treating Gaby badly…\" Terry interrupted, \"Not at all like that Eduardo, Dino would never do that to any woman… It's as if he no longer cared about how Gaby felt, like he doesn't care about her opinion any more. In the office, she just has to do her job, nothing more.\" Now Eduardo was confused, \"But Dino loved the way Gaby and he worked together – him negotiating, she working to help the family. They were a great team; he told me so, said that part of it was because they understood each other so well.\" Terry sighed, \"I have to be honest Eduardo, Dino has changed over the last few months and I don't know why. He won't talk to me except about work, it's almost as if he's pushing everyone away – Gaby most of all. That's what I found strangest of all. When Gaby first arrived, I could see how she felt about him and how careful she was not to push him into anything. She still feels the same, that I know, it's all over her face.\" \"and Dino?\" \"I don't know, after a couple of months, he let her in, Jackie and I used to meet them occasionally walking around Central Park. Dino always had his arm wrapped around her shoulders, at a gala, I heard him tell someone that he had never been so happy, that Gaby had helped him to live again.\" Terry paused, \"Eduardo, I've known Dino for a long time and I know how he felt about your sister – not just cared for her, but loved her. I was so happy for him – he hasn't had the greatest of luck with long term relationships, first his divorce, then Cass…\" \"It wasn't what he said, but what he did… Always watching out for her… Doing things – just because he knew she liked it. Walking into her office to get a file when he didn't really need it, just to have an excuse to be with her… I once teased them that I should have the wall between their offices knocked down. That way they could gaze at each other all day… You can imagine the reply I got to that one…\" Eduardo chuckled, he certainly could… Gaby couldn't help but show how much she loved the red-headed ex Delta Force officer, but during the last couple of visits he had seen personally that Dino returned that love. He sighed, before Terry's voice broke through his thoughts. \"I don't know what I can do Eduardo, I'll talk to Jackie tonight – maybe between us we can put the puzzle together, otherwise I'll have to wait until Dino gets back.\" \"He's not there?\" Terry was surprised, \"You didn't know? He left for Europe three days ago, before Gaby left for Argentina.\" Eduardo thought quickly, \"Does he know that Gaby is not in New York?\" Terry answered in the negative making Eduardo more worried, \"She's left behind his back… That's not like her… This is something much deeper than I originally thought.\" Terry agreed, but there was nothing they could do now. They had to wait for Gaby to talk, and Dino to return home… Consuella walked through the courtyard on her way to the kitchen, spring was on the way and she smiled to see the buds on the trees and plants, indicating that the coldest of the weather was over. Hearing a faint noise she stopped, realizing it was coming from near the fountain. A quick glance revealed Gaby, sitting on the bench, head in her hands. Consuella sighed, Gaby had been at the hacienda for over a week, speaking to no-one, not even Alvaro and Joachim who had been her closest friends for many years when she led the Artemis team. Consuella swallowed, she was a little in awe of Gaby, and secretly also a little afraid of her and the strength she had exhibited as Artemis leader. However, what she saw was someone who had been broken, and was now destroying herself from the inside, caught in a decreasing spiral of self pity and heartbreak. She had to stop this negativity. Taking a deep breath, she walked closer; it was time for Gaby to talk. \"Gabrielle?\" The soft voice broke into Gaby's thoughts and she sighed. She had known sooner or later that someone would come to talk to her, though she was surprised that it was Consuella. She had expected her brother, or Antonio. She shifted uncomfortably on the bench, she had little contact with women, except for the girls from the office and Jackie in New York. She had made a few friends, but none of them were that close, none of them had managed to come inside the barrier she had built to protect herself. Jackie was the closest, but even she did not know her deepest secrets, her deepest fears. As tears slowly began to slide down her face, she felt a hand reaching for hers, then a second. \"Gaby? Please, tell me what happened… I can't bear to see you like this.\" Gaby shook her head and shrugged her shoulders, not able to speak. Consuella frowned, her sister in law was locking away her feelings and soon no-one would be able to reach her. She had come across just in time… \"Come with me…\" Pulling Gaby to her feet, she led her to her room and took a few things from her drawer, \"Change – I'll be back in a moment.\" She waited until she saw Gaby begin to change – albeit somewhat mechanically, before heading to her own room to do the same. When ready, she spoke to one of the hacienda workers and gave him a message, before returning to Gaby. \"Ok, let's go.\" Gaby looked up from where she was sitting on the bed, curious, \"Go where?\" Consuella grinned, \"It is much too nice a day to stay inside, and I fancy some company.\" As they walked outside, Consuella heard a slight gasp from Gaby's throat when she saw what was in front of them. Gaby's favourite horse, Condor was tacked up and ready to go, standing next to him was Bianca… Consuella was just as good a rider as Gaby, but wanted to shock her into talking and had decided to ride the grey mare to do just that. Gaby swallowed, around the hacienda, Bianca was regarded as being Dino's horse and seeing her brought back a lot of memories. She knew that the mare was used when she and Dino weren't there… but… \"C'mon Gaby, let's go… or we won't have time for a decent ride before lunch.\" As Gaby swung onto Condor's back, Consuella gave a little smile, first she would allow Gaby time to relax, but then she would start asking questions… Gaby reined in her horse as she approached the river and sighed, Consuella had been right, it was too much of a nice day to be spent indoors. In the distance she could hear the crack of rifle fire as Eduardo put the Artemis teams through their training. Smiling sadly, she thought back to her time with the organization and the work she had done. The people they had helped, especially the refugees, still sent messages of thanks at Christmas time through a contact point in Buenos Aires. She sighed again, the teams were now closed to her – yes they were still part of who she was, but she was no longer part of them and could feel the line that had come between her and the members, even those who had been on her own team. She was quite happy about that, she had been able to move on with her life which she would never have done if Dino… The tears started again, why did everything remind her of him…? Hearing hoof beats behind her, she resisted the urge to turn – knowing that the sight of Bianca without Dino in the saddle would make her breakdown completely. Consuella quietly brought Bianca alongside Condor, saying nothing. She had deliberately held Bianca back to a steady canter, while Gaby galloped on ahead, hoping the change of scenery and atmosphere would help. Glancing across at Gaby's face she became worried, seeing the tears that were once again falling down her sister in law's face. Reaching across for Gaby's hand, she quietly asked her question, \"What happened?\" Gaby shook her head, fighting to control the helplessness she felt inside, \"I don't know…\" Consuella was confused, Gaby's answer was barely a whisper, but she couldn't understand… Surely there must have been some kind of warning that things were not going well… Climbing down from Bianca's saddle, Consuella persuaded Gaby to do the same and the two of them walked to the edge of the river bank and sat down. \"Look… Why don't we start from the beginning…? When you went to New York… Dino was happy to see you… right?\" Gaby nodded her head but still said nothing. Consuella bit her lip, she knew this was going to be hard, but now she realized how hard. She and Gaby were not really that close, though they enjoyed each other's company when Gaby had come home for a visit. How could she get Gaby to talk? & Terry walked into his apartment and sighed, the new secretary had started today, taking over the more basic of jobs while Paula had taken over Gaby's work. Apart from Jackie, Paula was probably Gaby's closest friend in New York, and while the boys were working away on negotiations often had lunch and dinner together with Jackie. A thought came to his mind, and after hanging his coat he headed for the kitchen, looking for his wife. \"I need to ask you something…\" Jackie looked up in surprise, Terry's tone of voice was serious, yet cautious too, as if he was about to ask something that he didn't really want to hear the answer to. \"What is it?\" \"When Dino and I were both away… Did Gaby always come here or meet you and Paula for dinner?\" Jackie became thoughtful for a moment, Terry had told her about Eduardo's phone call and she had been trying to think what may have happened between their friends. \"Most of the time, yes, she hated it when he was away, hated to be alone. That's why she used to go with him if it looked like a negotiation was going to take a while…\" \"Do you think she hated it enough to try and persuade him to stop…?\" Dino looked up and down the road outside the airport, where the hell was Gaby? He had managed to wrap up the negotiation the night before and left a message on the answer machine at home telling her when to pick him up, but there was no sign of her. Opening his cell he called her number, hearing it ring a couple of times before getting a recorded message, 'Out of Service'. Dino swore, Gaby had probably forgotten to charge her cell… again, she could be so dumb sometimes… He tried the house line and got the answer machine, giving a frustrated sigh, he dialed the office. A bright young voice that he didn't recognize answered the phone, confused by his request to speak to Gaby. \"I'm sorry sir, there is no-one of that name here, would you like to speak to Mr Thorne?\" Dino was about to tell the young woman off for not recognizing him, when he realized that she must be new and accepted her suggestion. A moment later, he heard Terry's voice on the end of the line. \"Jesus Terry, where the hell is Gaby? I left her a message to pick me up at the airport and there's no sign of her.\" Terry swallowed, \"Sorry Dino, I didn't realize you were on your way back, I would have arranged something… Give me 30 minutes, I'll come for you.\" Dino pulled a face, \"Sure, ok, but I still don't understand why Gaby let me down. Cass never would have done that.\" Terry put the phone down slowly, what the hell did Dino mean by that last remark? More to the point, what was he going to tell him about Gaby's decision to go to Argentina? & A short while later, Terry was returning to the office with Dino next to him, informing him about several cases that had just come up, Dino was grumbling about Gaby's non-appearance and not really listening. Terry watched him carefully, suddenly realizing how Dino's attitude must have seemed to Gaby. Not once did his partner inquire how she was, or if something was wrong, merely assuming that Gaby had made a mistake. Terry remained silent for a moment, trying to work out what he was going to say. Dino was not only his partner, but also his best friend and they had been through hell and back together. However, he could now partly understand why Gaby had left, though he still couldn't work out what had happened. Taking a deep breath, Terry decided to keep it short and simple. \"Dino, Gaby's left… She's not here.\" Dino turned slightly in his seat and narrowed his eyes, his voice dropping, becoming quieter. \"What do you mean she's left…? Where has she gone?\" Terry sighed, \"Gone home, to Argentina…\" Dino began swearing under his breath, Terry waited for the questions, waited for Dino's temper to change from anger to concern. Hoped for it to change even, then at least he would know that maybe his friend would be able to reconcile his differences with his partner, but it was not to be. If anything, Dino became even more angry, \"Great, she could have told me, or sent a message. I guess I may as well come to the office, have a look at this case you were talking about, maybe I need to go back out.\" His casual dismissal of Gaby's disappearance stunned Terry, what the hell had happened between him and Gaby to result in such a lack of feeling? More to the point, why had he and Jackie not seen what was going on, Terry fell silent, feeling guilty that he had not picked up on anything. At the office, Dino ploughed into the files on his desk, frowning at the last one which was proving to be tricky. Noticing that the file had not been updated in three days, he went through to the office next door, now occupied by Paula. \"Do you have the update for the Ortega file? It seems to be missing.\" Paula hesitated, \"I'm not sure where it is, I'm still trying to catch up with Miss Santigo's work.\" Dino turned to her, his voice cold but still polite, after all it wasn't Paula's fault that Gaby had left the office in a mess. \"Don't worry about it, I'll find it myself.\" Slowly he leafed through the e-mails that had come in, finding the updates that he needed, annoyed to see that some of them were over five days old. \"Something wrong?\" Looking up he saw Terry watching him carefully, \"Trying to find the updates for this file, Gaby is damned inconsiderate leaving like this, her office is in a mess. Cass would never have done this when she went for a break.\" Terry paused for a moment, there it was again, the reference to Cass. Dino hadn't spoken about her in years, why was he doing so now? Dino's voice distracted him from his thoughts. \"So, when is she coming back? Lucky you managed to find a temp until then.\" Terry swallowed, \"Sally isn't a temp Dino, she's coming in full time. Gaby's not coming back; she left right after you did.\" Dino straightened up and looked directly at Terry, his voice quiet but hard. \"What?\" \"She's gone home Dino, she said that she was going to stay there.\" Dino's voice turned to ice, \"Fine, if that's how she wants it…\" Turning back to the e-mails, he found one that had arrived a few hours before. Reading through it quickly he pulled a face, \"The Ortega case is not going well, I'll fly back out in a couple of days or so and see what I can do to help.\" \"Dino…\" \"What? Don't hassle me Terry… If Gaby wants to go back home and play the huntress with her brother, that's her choice. My priority at the moment is this case. I'm going home to grab some food, a change of clothes and some rest, though not necessarily in that order.\" Turning his back on Terry, he grabbed his things and walked out of the door, announcing that he would catch a cab home. Terry headed for his office and picked up his phone. & \"Cass? Why would Gaby talk about Cass?\" Jackie was confused, but when Terry told her what had happened that day, she became thoughtful. \"You know… A few months ago, she did ask me for some recipe ideas… Said that she knew Dino liked certain meals, but wasn't sure how to do them… A couple of them were things that I know Cass liked to do.\" Terry became thoughtful, \"Maybe we need to dig a little deeper… If Dino has been comparing Gaby to Cass…\" Jackie agreed, \"It would be understandable that she got upset, but would it be enough to send her running like she did? Gaby's much stronger than that, a comparison with Cass might hurt, but she knows what Dino went through, wouldn't she be able to shrug it off?\" Terry wasn't so sure, Gaby seemed tough on the outside – and then there was her work as Artemis, but… \"I don't know Jackie, over the last couple of years I've got to know Gaby pretty well. She's not as strong as she seems.\" \"Granted, if someone tried to steal her purse or something she'd be able to sort them out, but emotionally? I don't know, she's not the same as the person I originally met in Argentina 5 years ago…\" & Dino walked into the house and threw his suitcase onto the sofa before walking into the kitchen. Opening the fridge, he swore at what he saw… Nothing… The fridge was completely empty… Checking, he realized that Gaby had turned it off. The freezer next to it wasn't much better, a few steaks, frozen vegetables and a couple of pizzas, but he wanted something decent… The cupboards had the usual tinned and boxed staples, but nothing great. Taking a glass out of the cupboard, he opened another to get out a soft drink to quench his thirst, but again found nothing apart from a couple of small bottles of water. In a rage he picked up the glass and threw it against the wall… Why? Why had Gaby done this…? Cass never would have let him down like this. Turning on his heel, he grabbed his jacket and left the house, heading for Patrick's Bar, at least he knew he'd get some good food there. Walking in, Dino was greeted by a surprised Patrick, who hadn't seen him in a long while. He had bumped into Dino in the street on occasion and had accepted the reasons why Dino had stopped drinking at his bar. \"Been busy Dino? How's your lady friend?\" Dino gave him a sour look, \"Don't know, don't really care right now, can you give me something? I just got back and I'm starving.\" Patrick nodded and turned to his cook, asking for a couple of steaks. Glancing back, he saw a look on Dino's face that he hadn't seen in years and it saddened him. First Cass and now Gaby, it seemed that the man was to be plagued by bad luck when it came to settling down… He decided not to mention anything more, but offered Dino a drink, \"Beer while you're waiting?\" Dino shook his head, \"Scotch… and make it a large one.\" Dino downed the drink in one gulp, signaling to Patrick for a refill. As he finished the second, he wasn't aware that he was being watched. Sitting in a dark corner, a dark-haired woman smiled to herself. It had been a long time since the red-head had come to Patrick's and he would make a nice change to her usual marks. Rough he could be – especially after a few drinks, but he was one of only a few that could make her job enjoyable… and profitable. Dino was one who liked to keep a woman for the night. She would have to be careful though, she knew that he'd been about to get married when his fiancée had been killed and later he'd found someone new. However, the fact that he was here indicated that all was not well in that area. Seeing him take a seat at a table nearby when Patrick brought out a plate of food, she smiled and made her plans. & Gaby reined in her horse and smiled, Condor was getting old and much of his speed was gone, but he was still sure-footed and sensitive to her touch. As Consuella caught up, she chuckled slightly, \"so… are we going to begin my next counseling session?\" Consuella smiled back, \"It's good to know that my studies in psychology weren't wasted…\" She and Gaby had been riding together for a week or two and slowly she had got Gaby to talk about her life with Dino, concentrating on the good things. A few days before, Gaby had broken down when talking about the day she had realized that Dino returned her love completely – not just caring for her in his own way. \"He'd taken me up to Boston for the weekend, said we needed a short break.\" Gaby had dropped her head and tears had started sliding down her face. \"We were walking around a park when he told me how happy he was that I'd decided to stay in New York. It was when he gave me the silver locket…\" Consuella knew about the locket that Gaby always wore, but had never actually seen it close up until that day. Inside were two small pictures of Dino and Gaby, on the back, an inscription, 'Claddagh' and a heart held in two hands topped by a crown. Gaby had asked what it meant, but Dino had merely said it was an Irish custom more commonly associated with rings, but that it suited their relationship. Intrigued, Gaby had started digging to find out more to find out what the symbol meant. Finding the information that she needed more quickly than she expected, she found out that the symbol worn turned inwards signified that \"someone had captured their heart\"… Consuella sighed, \"I think we'd better start talking about what happened more recently Gaby… If we're going to fix this.\" Gaby dropped her head knowing that her sister-in-law was right. She loved Dino, wanted to be with him, but she could not go back yet. Not until she had worked out what had happened, how could she fix something when she didn't know how it had been broken…? Dino opened one eye and groaned, somewhere to his right he could hear his cell ringing, the sound echoing through his skull. He couldn't remember the last time when he had felt this bad. Opening his cell, his ears were assaulted by Terry's voice. \"Dino… Where the fk are you, I've been trying to reach you for the last two hours, the Ortega case has gone down and I need you to get over to Chechnya ASAP.\" Dino shook his head, trying to clear his mind, Terry couldn't go to Chechnya after a deal he'd worked for Luthan Risk had turned a little sour and upset the Russians. \"Ok, give me time to have a shave and a shower and I'll come in.\" \"Yeah – well you better move fast – your plane leaves in just over three hours.\" Dino could almost hear the phone slam down at the other end and winced. Sitting up, he glanced around, a feeling of disquiet coming over him – he wasn't at home, that he could tell from the colours of the room… Hotel… Why would he have ended up in a hotel? As he got to his feet a little unsteadily, he cursed all makers of whisky that he could think of and wondered how he had got where he was. He couldn't remember a damn thing. Turning slightly, he caught sight of the brunette that had obviously been lying next to him and swore to himself. As he looked, she began to wake up, as if aware of his scrutiny. \"Morning Tiger… My... weren't we energetic last night…\" \"Get your clothes and get out…\" Dino growled, throwing some notes on the bed next to her, \"I want you gone by the time I come out of the shower.\" Standing under the shower, Dino alternated between hot and cold water, in an attempt to clear his mind enough for the day ahead. Terry was going to kill him… & Dino walked into the office about an hour later, he had passed by his house, thrown the dirty laundry into the basket and put clean into his bag and continued on. Putting his suitcase down to one side he walked into Terry's office. Terry was furious, \"Took your damn time…\" \"I had to grab some stuff, couldn't go out with dirty clothes now could I. Sorry about not answering the phone earlier, I was out cold.\" Terry couldn't believe how nonchalant Dino was and snarled at him, \"Yeah and not in your own bed either from the looks of it…\" Dino bristled, \"What are you talking about…?\" \"You're a bard Dino… I asked Jackie to pop in on her way to work to wake you up as she passed by – or had you forgotten that you and Gaby had given us a key to keep an eye on things when you went away. She also saw Patrick in the street… He told her you dropped in to his place last night…\" Dino stared at his friend, he had indeed forgotten that Terry had a key and now he had been caught out. He opened his mouth to say something, but Terry wasn't finished. \"You come home from an operation swearing at everything and treating people badly yet you don't look at yourself.\" \"Over the last six months you've had arguments with a couple of the extraction team members, causing them to threaten to quit… Only the Artemis teams working overseas for us have stayed totally loyal – and that's because of Gaby…\" \"Why did you slam her for her idea…? Offering a counseling service after someone has been kidnapped is a damn good idea… and she should know… She had a private counselor – in you… Yet a couple of years later you're slamming her down like a nobody… No wonder she left you.\" Dino stood, his temper flaring, \"Don't you drag her into this…\" Terry matched his friend move for move, \"Why not Dino… She's gone running home to Argentina, crying herself to sleep at night because she doesn't know what she's done wrong to make you so damn angry and all you can think of is where your next drink or the next woman is coming from.\" \"But I didn't intend to…\" \"Go tell it to the moon Dino, I don't believe you. I used to be proud to call you my friend – and you had one hell of a woman by your side – but you've reverted back to your true colours it seems. She helped you recover from losing Cass, and this is how you treat her in return, you're a piece of st Dino… Now get out of here and on that damn plane before you screw up our business as well as your life.\" Dino was so stunned by Terry's attack that he did what he was told, grabbing his case, he jumped in a cab and headed for the airport, case file and reports under his arm. The argument between him and Terry playing over and over in his mind… Had he really pushed people away…? He couldn't think straight, his head was pounding, what he really needed was some Tylenol and a good night's sleep, but probably wouldn't get either… Dino curled up on his seat trying to rest; usually it was not a problem. Terry had once joked that he could sleep anywhere – even on a washing line if necessary. However, today he couldn't, he had managed to get a couple of Tylenol at the airport, which had made the thudding in his head abate slightly, but his mind was still spinning at Terry's anger. In the time they had known each other, the two of them had rarely argued, but recently they had grown further apart and he couldn't work out why. Had he changed? He couldn't really see it, yes, he admitted to himself, he had got rather irritable with everyone over the last few months, but that was all Gaby's fault, why had she changed so much? She was no longer the person she had been when they had first met, which wasn't a bad thing. Since coming to New York, she had softened considerably, which he had liked, but then began changing – changes he didn't like… Why did she think she needed to take Cass' place? Didn't she realize what she was doing? Sighing to himself, his mind began to wander and once again thoughts of Cass settled into his mind. Thinking of her calmed him down and somewhere over the mid-Atlantic, he began to fall asleep. & Gaby sighed, she and Consuella had just returned from one of their 'counseling sessions' and had identified a possible problem. Gaby had remembered a fierce argument she had had with Dino one evening over dinner, she had spent some time over it – trying something new that she knew Dino liked from a list of recipes Jackie had given her. The food had turned out well, but she could see that Dino was becoming increasingly annoyed as they were eating. Gaby couldn't understand what was wrong, especially as she had made the effort to be what Dino wanted her to be… It was part of the reason why she had asked for the recipes. Thinking of him no longer brought tears, but it did make her heart ache. She loved him so much, why had he pushed her away? Was there something wrong that he didn't want her to know about? Some illness that he didn't want her to worry about? Is that why he hadn't said anything to her…? She wished he had talked to her about what was troubling him. She began to wonder how he was, what he was doing. Was he ok? She knew that she could find out by calling Terry, but was afraid to call the office in case Dino answered the phone and she didn't want either Consuella or Eduardo doing it for her, though she knew they would. Sighing to herself, she continued into her room after having a quick shower, she stretched out on the couch dozing off in a few minutes, her mind trying to search for answers. & Dino scowled at the weather, why did Eastern Europe always have to be so dull? Though technically Chechnya was Asia, he still associated the country with the former USSR and thought of it as a European country. The weather seemed to reflect the problems of the country, always dark and sombre, maybe one day the sun would shine and the country would begin to solve its problems. Chechnya made him feel uncomfortable, the people here were fighting for independence – fighting for democracy, fighting for freedom… It appealed to his American self, but he disliked the way many people were trying to fulfill that dream, he knew that more peaceful ways had been tried – but that didn't mean they couldn't be tried again. Stepping out of his taxi, he ran into the hotel to stay as dry as possible, after checking in, he went to his room and threw his case on the bed. The flight he had taken had resulted him arriving in the middle of the night and the negotiating team would not be expecting him until the morning. Kicking his shoes off, he sank onto the bed, exhausted by the journey, maybe now he would get some sleep, he certainly hadn't managed to get a lot on the plane. & Terry sighed, he had just told Jackie about his argument with Dino – though not the circumstances and she was worried. \"Is it because of Gaby he's behaving like this – or something else?\" Terry shrugged his shoulders, \"I really don't know, but if it is because of Gaby, I don't think we can help… It's something that he and Gaby will have to sort out between themselves.\" Jackie looked troubled, \"But the way Dino is at the moment… He's not going to make a move to fix things…\" Terry nodded, \"I know… I'll have to call Eduardo and tell him what we've worked out… If Dino doesn't make a move – and Gaby really wants him back – she's going to have to do the work…\" Jackie pulled a face, \"Like that's going to happen… If she thinks he's not interested – she won't do it.\" Terry smiled, \"That's why I need to speak to Eduardo… Consuella has her work cut out for her, but if anyone can do it… She can.\"[Chapter 2] Dino swore. The negotiating team had done their best, but after five days, he knew that he wasn't going to get anything back for them. There was only one way this was going to go down… \"Get me the team… They're going to need to go in…\" & Dino cursed quietly to himself, the team had managed to get the information they needed to get Ortega out, but one of them had come down with some sort of viral bug and was currently introducing the contents of his stomach to the toilet in his hotel room. \"It's going to take Simone at least a week to get over this,\" the team leader had told Dino, which was why the red-head was now dressed in black and green combat fatigues and sitting in a helicopter. He had taken the decision to get Ortega out immediately, afraid that the situation would go even more pear-shaped. \"10 minutes to drop-off\" The call from the pilot set Dino's pulse racing, he hoped that he wouldn't let the team down. Granted, he was providing cover, not going in himself…. But things could always go wrong. For a fleeting moment, Dino told himself off for being a complete idiot, he was getting too damn old for this… An image of Eduardo floated into his mind, the last operation he had gone out on was to bring Gaby home… He sighed, he could do with Eduardo next to him right now… That was one person he could count on if there was trouble, this team were good – but not as good as the Artemis teams. \"Time to go…\" Dino swallowed, for the first time in his life wondering if he'd done the right thing joining this operation. Damn , when he got home, he really was going to have to sort out his life… & Dino took cover behind a wall as bullets thudded around him, swearing, he noted that the rest of the team were all doing the same thing nearby. Ortega the hostage was a quiet man in his late forties, possibly early fifties, but the look he gave Dino was not one of frustration or fear, but calm acceptance. Dino cursed, the operation had gone according to plan, until a vehicle had pulled up on the planned RV point and the team leader had had to call the helicopter to change the pick-up. The team had managed to get in and out of the camp without making a sound, but as they were making their way to the second RV shouts had been heard and they were soon running for their lives when a scout picked up the trail. Moving quickly but quietly, the team were making good time and settled in to wait for their transport home. The next moment, it came into view and Dino sighed with relief at the thought that they would soon be leaving the area. The next moment they all watched in horror as a ground to air missile screamed through the air, turning the helicopter into a ball of fire which fell to the ground barely half a mile away from their position. They didn't hang around for long, running as fast as they could the team moved away from the area, hoping to put some distance between them and the group that was following them. Now, they had to work out what they were going to do… Taking a quick look over the wall, he had to duck back when a round of bullets pinged around him. Damn… & Gaby screamed. Sitting bolt upright in bed, she shook with fear for a moment, until she realized that she must have had a nightmare and was able to calm her breathing slightly. She decided to get a drink – hoping that the short walk to the kitchen might calm her nerves. It didn't. The images in her mind had been so vivid, she had thought they were real. She was about to walk back to her room when she saw the light on in the study, curious, she went to have a look and found her brother checking over some files. \"You're up late.\" Eduardo glanced up and shrugged slightly, \"I've got used to being up at night – just like you did. It certainly appeals, quieter, easier to work.\" Narrowing his eyes, he saw how pale Gaby was, \"Are you ok? You look like you saw a ghost.\" Gaby crumpled onto the couch at the side of the room, head in her hands. Eduardo was next to her immediately, \"Sis? What's wrong?\" \"I just had a really bad dream, it was all so real, a helicopter was shot down… Oh God… Are there any teams out tonight?\" Eduardo shook his head, \"No, we're quiet at the moment… The next refugee escort is next week, everyone is taking a break. Gaby… Are you ok?\" Gaby shook her head, \"I saw a helicopter being shot down over some mountains… An extraction team was trying to get a man out… It was so real, I could even hear the shouts and gunfire… and I saw men… running… I saw…\" She stopped, her eyes opening wide, tears beginning to run down her cheeks. Eduardo wrapped his arm around her sister, feeling how cold she was, Gaby was not one to make things up, nor was she prone to having nightmares. This was something so new, so different, he knew that it had terrified her, he had to get her to talk about it – to get it out of her system. Gently he asked his question, \"What did you see…?\" Gaby sobbed, shaking her head, so Eduardo pressed her a little more. Gaby swallowed, \"I saw a man with the team… running, being chased…\" The tears came more strongly and Eduardo held her more tightly, almost scared to ask his next question. \"Who was it Gaby…? Who was the man?\" Gaby buried her head into her brother's shoulder, sobbing. \"It was Dino…\" Eduardo felt his blood turn to ice; he had spoken to Terry a few days before and knew that Dino had gone to Chechnya to try and fix a negotiation that was going wrong. Closing his eyes, he prayed that Gaby's nightmare had not been a premonition. Holding his sister tightly, he gave her what comfort he could. Terry put the phone down slowly, he had just received a call from their negotiator in Chechnya and heard about the helicopter. Their contacts were trying to find out if the team had been caught, but as yet there was no information. Putting his elbows on his desk, he dropped his head in his hands, it was always bad to lose a hostage, worse to lose a team… but to lose Dino as well… Instantly Terry regretted the words he had said before Dino left, their last conversation face to face had not been good – and any contact on the phone had been tense. A barrier had come up between them, their friendship was being tested to the limit. One thing Terry knew, it would never be the same again. He just hoped that he would have the chance to talk to Dino again, hoped that he and the team would find a way out of this mess… Oh God, what am I going to tell Gaby? & Dino sighed with relief, the team leader knew the area well and they had played cat and mouse with the group chasing them for several hours and had finally lost them after descending into a small steep sided valley. He was amazed how resilient Ortega was, the man had not panicked once, nor caused any problems, immediately doing what he had been told. Seeing Alberto beckoning to him, he walked quietly over to the commander, who was ex-Italian military and had done some special forces work for the UN before coming into K&R.; He had worked his way through the 'ranks' of the extraction teams and was a superb medic, but Dino knew that it was the least of his skills. Alberto gave Dino a concerned look and led him a little further away so the team and Ortega could not hear him. \"I'm not going to beat around the bush boss… We've managed to lose the kidnappers, but now what the hell do we do?\" \"We have three days rations each, and the nearest town is in rebel hands – we daren't risk going back there, they'll hand us right back to the kidnappers.\" Dino sighed, \"Options?\" Alberto took a map out of his pack, \"Normally I don't allow anyone on my team to carry a map, but for some reason, I left this in my gear today…. Probably just as well… Now let's have a look.\" Dino looked carefully at the map and almost swore to himself. How in the hell was he supposed to get home from here? However, as Alberto began talking about possible routes, Dino's old training clicked into gear and his mind started turning things over… & \"South?\" Dino raised an eyebrow at Alberto, \"Is it possible?\" The southern part of Chechnya was dominated by the Great Caucasus Mountains and the area was difficult to cross. Alberto sighed, \"At this time of year, yes – just. In winter you'd need a miracle to survive up here. We move in any other direction and we're at risk of being caught by the rebels. By going south, we can get into Georgia and hopefully Tblisi. The Embassy there will help us out due to the links that the Georgian government have with Europe.\" Dino was not quite convinced, \"How far?\" he asked quietly. Alberto gave him a half smile, \"According to the GPS, we're only 30 miles from the border… After that, it's about another 70 to Tblisi, but hopefully we won't need to walk all the way…\" Dino's eyes rolled into the back of his head, 30 miles, in this kind of country – they would be lucky to clear the distance in three days. \"Everyone goes on half rations. At least we don't have to worry about water… There are springs all over the place.\" As Alberto briefed the team, Dino noticed Ortega listening intently and was curious. When the team leader had finished and asked for questions, Ortega looked keen, but hesitated. \"Mr Ortega? You have a question?\" The man nodded, \"Will you be using the trail? It is a little dangerous you know.\" Alberto and Dino traded looks before the team leader answered, \"What trail? It's not marked on any local map.\" The Spaniard chuckled, \"I'm not surprised, apparently it used to be used by smugglers, but more recently, the rebels have used it on rare occasions to get people out of Chechnya and away from the military.\" Dino began to feel more hopeful, \"Do you know where it is?\" The man's smile faded, \"Not exactly, but I overheard one of the guards say that it was near the source of the Arqun river. About four hours walk from here, there are markers guiding the way.\" Dino looked around him. \"I suggest we set up a camp and start out at first light. I want to approach this trail in daylight. How long will it take to get to the border Mr Ortega?\" \"Border? I don't know, but in seven days, we can be in Shatili in Georgia…\" Dino smiled, \"Mr Ortega, would you mind joining me for dinner? I need to ask you a few things if we are going to make this trip successful.\" & Dino settled behind the cover of some bushes, carefully watching the three men lounging around about half a mile away. Alberto had sent one of his men ahead to scout out the route and see if they could get around the guards. From what he could see, the trail was little more than a goat track but the fact that it led them to a town on the opposite side of the Georgian border made it feel like a four lane highway in his mind. A slight noise made him turn and he smiled to see Alberto – a big grin on his face. \"My man has found a path – slightly higher than the trail – the two connect after about 3 kilometers. It will be enough to get around the guards.\" & Terry was getting worried, 24 hours had passed and there was still no news about the team. The negotiators could find out nothing and were preparing their things to leave. Chechnya was getting dangerous again and they would want to leave as soon as possible. Mike had grabbed all of Dino's gear and kept it with his own, just in case. \"As soon as we get word, I'll let you know Ter… but if things start getting worse, we're out of here – the team are on their own.\" Terry had agreed with Mike's words, good negotiators were harder to find than extraction teams and for the moment he could do nothing else. He sighed and decided to put off the phone call to Gaby. After all, no news was good news… right? & Dino passed his canteen to Ortega so the Spaniard could have a drink. They had been walking for about three hours and were taking a twenty minute break, while the scouts checked out the area ahead. Dino had been gratified to notice that the team kicked into to the normal modus operandi for the situation – pairing up and working together. Alberto kept himself a little separate as a good team leader should, keeping his mind on the big picture as well as the smaller one – though he would constantly check in with Dino to discuss what they should do next. As a result, Dino found himself keeping company with Ortega. The man intrigued him, most hostages were shell shocked when rescued – clinging to their rescuer – which could be dangerous. Others were silent, almost numb, and had to be physically directed because they were not capable of registering what was going on. Emilio Ortega was neither, Dino found himself studying the man carefully and revised his earlier opinion of the man's age. He was definitely over 50, but his steadfastness and stamina belied his age. \"What is it Senior Dino? I sense you have some questions…\" Dino was startled, surprised to have been read so easily by a complete stranger. \"It's nothing Mr Ortega, just relax a little, we'll be moving on shortly. If you would excuse me a moment…?\" Ortega gave a slight nod and watched carefully as Dino walked away, his face a myriad of emotions. He noticed how the rest of the team showed him respect, but he was not the team leader. Ortega was curious, trying to work out the red-heads position in the order of things. He also noticed the pain and anger in the man's eyes and wondered what the story was behind them… \"How far have we come?\" Dino and Alberto were sitting on a log side by side and had just shared a meager dinner with Ortega, who was now settling down for the night. Alberto checked his map in the minimal light that they had and compared it to his GPS. \"Believe it or not, we've done really well, nearly 15 miles. Though the trail gets steeper from here and we'll be running on less energy, it helps a lot that were not fighting our way over bad ground.\" Dino nodded and quietly moved away to settle himself down. Alberto was taking first watch and he would be taking the last. He wanted to make sure he had some sleep before then. & \"It's beautiful, isn't it?\" Dino turned slightly and acknowledged Ortega as he sat down quietly. He had noticed the older man moving quietly around the camp earlier, getting water for the rest of the team, before moving towards Dino's position. As he received the canteen of water with a grateful nod Dino almost smiled, \"I guess… But I've seen many sunrises like this and most of the following days did not end well.\" \"It doesn't mean that every morning will end badly Senor… You just have to believe that every day is a symbol of a fresh start. What you do with that day is up to you. Sometimes you have to do things that are not pleasant, but they are necessary… For the greater good…\" Pausing, the Spaniard took a good look at Dino' face, \"Something tells me you have seen more of the unpleasant side of life Senor… That can weigh heavily on a man… Sometimes at the cost of his own self-belief.\" Dino sighed, \"You sound like a philosopher Mr Ortega…\" The older man chuckled, \"Being alone as I was over the last six months gives you a lot of time to look at things… Analyse what you have done with your life…\" Dino gave him a sour look, he didn't have time for this… Yet Ortega's eyes held him to his place, almost forced him to ask the question. \"So Mr Ortega, have you done well with your life?\" Ortega smiled, \"I cannot say, I am happy, that is true, but I cannot judge. Only one being can make judgment on whether my life has been useful…\" Dino was confused, \"You reminding me of a bible story Mr Ortega?\" The Spaniard chuckled softly before turning back to the camp, \"Of course Senor… After all… I used to be a priest…\" & Dino eyed Ortega warily, finding out that he had been a priest had answered a few questions, the man's acceptance of the situation for example, but it also made him more curious. He wanted to find out more, but backed off a little, Dino was not a person who liked to be preached to… Emilio Ortega smiled softly to himself, seeing the battle going on inside of Dino. He could sense that the man needed help – though could not work out how he knew that – or if he could help. He had dangled the bait, now he just had to wait to see if Dino would bite… Dino sighed, they had been walking for three days and the team was getting tired, lack of food was depleting their energy, though thanks to the fact they were following a trail, they were better than they could have been. Water was plentiful, but he could sense that the men were tense and hoped arguments would not start to come up as they became more tired and irritable with each other. The exception was Ortega; the Spaniard was calm, almost serene. Occasionally sharing a few words with the team members, thanking them for their work, thanking them for getting him out of the camp, his presence certainly had a calming influence. They were now working their way downwards slightly and Alberto had confirmed that they were in Georgia – well, according to the GPS they were. Dino felt a little happier, but would not be satisfied until they saw signs of civilization – friendly civilization. A flicker of movement caught his eye, and he saw a rabbit sitting on his haunches. He lifted his rifle to take a shot, his mouth watering at the thought of fresh meat. \"Don't…\" Alberto's voice stopped him, \"The scout has spotted a couple of men, unless you have a quieter way of killing that rabbit, you'll broadcast our position.\" Dino swore quietly, the only weapon that was quiet enough at that range would be a bow… The thought triggered off a memory that made him smile softly. He and Gaby had joined the Gauchos on the estancia one evening – they had been bringing in the cattle from the far pastures and had asked him and Gaby to join in the hunt for some food… He caught himself, he hadn't thought of Gaby for a while and was surprised at how much the memory hurt. She had left him… behind his back… Whatever feelings she had for him must be gone for her to do that, he sighed, maybe he was destined to be alone. He did not notice Ortega watching him closely. & Terry couldn't help a smile slowly creeping across his face, \"You sure Mike?\" \"As much as I can be Terry, the rebel camp sent out a call to other factions that Ortega has been lost. They have asked for help from men experienced in the mountains to continue the search.\" \"They mentioned that he had 'help' from a six man team and want them all caught – alive. They seem to think that they can use them to negotiate a release of some people that have been imprisoned by Moscow.\" Terry sighed, \"Any ideas where the team might be?\" Mike answered in the negative, \"Sorry Ter, if I dig any more it might compromise our position – me and the guys are pulling out. Most of them are heading for Western Europe, but I'm going to hang around a little. I'll be in Tblisi if anyone needs me.\" \"Why Georgia Mike?\" The negotiator chuckled, \"From what I know about the way the rebels are organized, it was the best direction Dino and the team could take… If they can get to Tblisi, Simone and I will meet them somewhere – at least we have their passports…\" \"Who will you contact? We don't have anyone there.' \"That's easy… Ortega's Spanish… The Spanish government have a resident there – based in the Turkish Embassy.\" Thanking Mike for the information, Terry cut the line, gave a huge sigh and began to hope. \"So Mr Ortega, it seems we couldn't rescue you as well as we had hoped…\" The Spaniard gave a soft smile at Dino's words. The two men were sitting close to a small stream and had just filled the canteens of water. Both were showing the signs of exhaustion, but Dino couldn't help admiring the older man's fortitude. \"Believe me Senor, anything is better than that camp. Our rations may be limited, but at least out here I am free – even if we do not make it. Which I refuse to accept.\" Dino gave a wry smile, \"It must be nice to have a belief as strong as yours to keep you going… I have to admit mine is somewhat shaky.\" Ortega smiled, \"It is not my faith that keeps me going Senor… Yes it helps me to accept my situation, keeps me calm in the face of adversity, but it is not what keeps me fighting for my life – the will to live is something that every man has…\" Dino was intrigued, \"Oh…?\" \"Everyone has something to return home to Senor… Friends… Family… A partner…\" At his words, Emilio saw Dino's face turn dark, his eyes full of pain. Placing his hand on Dino's, he sighed, \"I am sorry, you have lost someone…\" Without thinking, Dino nodded his head, \"Cass… We were due to be married… She was killed in an accident, along with our unborn child…\" \"I am sorry for your loss Senor… It must have been recent for you to show so much pain…\" Dino was a little surprised by the man's words and shook his head, \"No… It was about seven years ago… But I still think about her everyday…\" Ortega narrowed his eyes, slightly confused. The look in Dino's eyes was not remembered pain, but recent… There was something else that was going on. \"And there has been no-one else since? Your loyalty to the memory of your partner is to be commended… I wish I could help you with your pain…\" Dino abruptly stood up and walked away, his mind in turmoil… There had been someone to help him with his pain… Gaby had helped him to heal, but never pushed, never said anything… Dear God… What had gone wrong? As the group of men continued their journey, Dino began thinking… & The next break found them looking down into a lush green valley. They would not reach it until dark, but each man gave a tired smile. Alberto grasped Ortega by the wrist and shook his hand, \"Thank you… For having faith in us.\" Emilio smiled, \"How could I not? You and your men came to get me out… It is the least I could do for that.\" Glancing around, he saw a troubled look on Dino's face. \"Something wrong Senor?\" Dino pointed further along the valley, \"I'm not sure, but we need to be careful… Smoke…\" Alberto looked up, smoke meant that people were near – but would they be friend or foe? That night, they camped among some densely growing pine trees which provided both protection from the elements and a sense of security. Knowing that they were close to civilization helped Dino to relax a little, and he slept quite well considering the conditions, but an image floating through his mind startled him awake. Looking around, he noticed that it was beginning to get light – the 'false dawn' that usually came half an hour or so before the true dawn depending on the part of the world you were in. Quietly he got up and went to relieve the scout on duty, though he still had more time to rest, he could no longer sleep. The sentry nodded his thanks and returned to the rest of the team, thankful for a little more rest. Dino however could sense that he was not alone and was not surprised when Ortega joined him, \"Early to bed, Early to rise Mr Ortega?\" The former priest chuckled, \"Old habits die hard Senor… As you well know…\" Dino dropped his head, \"So do memories…\" Emilio gave him a sharp look, the younger man seemed to be at war with himself, pain and anger flowing across his face, \"Can I help?\" \"I don't know, I don't think anyone can…\" \"How about you start from the beginning? The very beginning…\" Dino sighed, where was the beginning? He thought about the day he met Gaby, but pushed the thought to one side. No, Gaby was not the beginning, Cass… No… She's not the beginning either… Dino took a deep breath, his earliest memories began with Carol… & Emilio sighed, it had taken Dino about twenty minutes to talk about his first wife and their short life together. The red head had been burned, badly, and it was no surprise that he had taken his revenge on the women he had met later. Why did people hurt each other so much? \"So Mr Ortega, what made you leave the priesthood?\" The question made him smile, Dino had obviously found it difficult to talk about his life, not unusual for a man who had been a soldier and taken life – albeit at the orders from higher up. He chuckled, \"Can't you guess? There are those that say it is a weakness… I say that it is only a sign of weakness not to accept what the heart wishes… My faith has remained as strong as it ever was and I am delighted to say that I was able to share it with another.\" Dino stared, \"You have got to be kidding me… You gave up the priesthood… for a woman? \" \"You sound surprised Senor… I am not the first, nor will I be the last… She of course was horrified at what I had done at first, but we could not deny our feelings for each other, and I refused to lie to my parishioners. They accepted me instantly as a member of the community and the priest that took my place is now one of my best friends – though he still cannot understand why I did what I did…\" \"My wife has given me three wonderful children and she gives me so much more… Understanding, compassion… Of course we have arguments but that is the law of nature is it not… What makes us stronger is if we are able to forgive each other for our failings…\" Dino stared at him at first uncomprehending, Emilio smiled, \"Come now Senor… Surely you of all people know the power a woman has over us men… When you think about it… They are most certainly not the weaker sex…\" Dino began to chuckle… The former priest had a point. Cass and Gaby had both held him in their thrall, though for different reasons… Seeing the look on Dino's face, Emilio pushed him to continue his story… & The team paused, they had come to the location where Dino had spotted the smoke the evening before and had to be cautious. A quick scout around revealed a shepherd's shack, empty except for a wood burning stove and a shed. Alberto and Dino conferred quickly, deciding to give the area some space, just in case the shepherd was friendly to the rebels, though it would have been nice to get some information. The fact that someone was here was enough indication that there would be a small town nearby. Alberto lead the way down a well marked trail, though the team kept an eye open for other people, they would not be safe until they had reached a town of some kind. Glancing at Dino, he began to wonder what was on his boss' mind, for the last day or so, he had become detached from the rest of the team, lost in his thoughts. & Dino couldn't think straight… That evening they had once again camped under cover of the trees and finished off the last of their rations, breaking their weapons down not to frighten the locals, all of them hoping that tomorrow they would manage to reach a town or village of some kind. Talking to Ortega had made him realize that Cass still dominated his thoughts on a regular basis and everything he did always carried an unanswered query to her ghost… Am I doing the right thing…? The answers never came though and he would feel her loss more than ever… Oh God… Does Gaby know this… ? Is this the reason why she changed…? The thought hit Dino like a sledgehammer. Had he been comparing Gaby to Cass without realizing it? He couldn't tell. As his mind scanned back over the last couple of years, he couldn't see whether he had or hadn't and began to worry. Did I even love Gaby? Or had I just transferred my love for Cass into her…? It was a question he couldn't answer. & Ortega watched the emotions crossing Dino's face knowing the fight that was going on inside the man's mind… He had been there himself when it was time to choose between the woman he had fallen in love with – and the church which had not wanted to let him go. The bishop had asked him one simple question, \"Who do you love? The woman…or the Lord?\" Emilio had agonized over the answer for several hours before coming up with an answer, \"I love both, but I love Rosa more.\" The bishop had sighed and released him from the church with his blessing. Emilio hoped that Dino would also find an answer. & Dino could not find an answer, but in the afternoon of the seventh day, he and the team found a small village nestled into the foothills. Able to exchange a few things for food, the team felt better and continued down the valley, following the road. The following morning, they were able to hitch a ride from an old farmer who took them to Shatili where Ortega was able to make a call to the Spanish representative at the Turkish Embassy. That night, as they settled in for a night's rest at a hotel, Dino went searching for Ortega. The former priest looked better after a bath, a good meal and some clean clothes, closer to the diplomat that he had become after marrying the woman he loved. \"Emilio, I need your help…\" Ortega saw the helpless look on Dino's face and became worried, \"I will try… What is it?\" Dino sat down on the edge of the bed in the hotel room and dropped his head into his hands. \"I cannot see… I love them both… How can I ask Gaby to come back if I don't know if it is truly her I love…?\" Ortega pulled a face, how could he help Dino see whether it was Gaby he loved… Or if he just needed her companionship… A surrogate for the loss of Cass… an idea came to his mind. \"Lie back and close your eyes Dino… There is something I did in the camp when I felt at my lowest ebb… It gave me the strength to continue…\" Dino did as he was told, curious as to what Emilio would do. Ortega took a deep breath and willed himself to relax, he had been through the exercise himself while he was captured, and it had helped him to keep his hope for the future. He didn't know if it would help Dino. \"I want you to see images in your mind – do not put a face on the woman who has to join you in these images – just the hair and remember the blue eyes… Characteristics that they both had in common, hopefully by the end, you will know which woman resides in your heart in the present.\" \"And if it is Cass that I see…?\" Emilio sighed, \"Then it is up to you to explain the truth to Gaby… It would not be fair on her otherwise…\" Dino swallowed and fear gripped him for a moment, but he knew what Emilio said was true. Taking a deep breath, he knew he had to see the truth for himself too… \"Ok… Lets do this…\" & Emilio began carefully, \"You live in New York… Imagine a spring day – the buds on the trees, the sun brightening everywhere, you are walking in Central Park with your partner, the two of you laughing and joking, enjoying a quiet afternoon together.\" Dino gave a half smile, he had done this several times with both Cass and Gaby – it was a favourite way to spend a rare Sunday afternoon off… He was about to say something when Emilio continued. \"The scene is changing, a winter night out… To the movies, you've been watching a comedy and the two of you are still chuckling… You grab a late night meal in a quiet restaurant… There are a few other customers, but you are oblivious to them, you only have eyes for the woman sitting opposite you. Emilio shifted scenes several times, Dino had now stilled on the bed where he was lying, almost hypnotized by the man's quiet voice as it rose and fell weaving a story that held Dino in thrall. The former priest took a deep breath, though he had never needed it for himself, it was a shift to the last image that he hoped would help Dino to realize which of the two women he kept in his heart…[Chapter 3] \" Put yourself on a beach, your partner is lying beside you, and asks you to put the sun oil on her back so she doesn't burn.\" Dino's mouth stretched into a smile as he remembered doing just this, but the next moment Ortega continued, triggering another set of memories… \" You can feel the smoothness of the skin under your fingertips, soft… supple, you cannot help but tease a little, lightening your touch until you get a shiver, which also earns you an amused telling off… You continue, keeping to the job at hand but promise yourself that later… Later it will be your turn…\" \" Later becomes now… Once again you have some kind of lotion in your hands, but this one is to soothe your partners skin, she has been burnt slightly and needs your help… Gently you smooth the lotion all over her back, being careful not to apply too much pressure, not wanting to hurt her.\" \" At first she hisses as the cool lotion comes into contact with her hot skin, and almost pulls away from you, but after a few moments she stills and you sense that she is enjoying your touch.\" \" You become more focused on what you are doing without quite knowing why, and your movements change, from merely applying the lotion, you switch to a soft and gentle massage. You see a smile on her face and a soft sigh escapes her lips making you smile in return…\" Dino sighed quietly, Ortega's voice was so soft he could barely hear it, but the images in his mind were so clear he could almost feel the skin beneath his fingers. He was lost in his thoughts as Emilio's voice continued. \" You are no longer intent on merely taking away the pain of the sunburn… The feel of her skin, soft and smooth is beginning to intoxicate you and you need to show her how you feel… You drop a soft kiss onto the base of her neck and notice her mouth twitch at the corner… She knows you well… Knows what you are up to, but she does nothing…\" \" You continue your kisses slowly down her spine and hear her breathing become slower… Deeper… She is so relaxed it is as if she is going to sleep, yet you can sense that the truth is completely the opposite.\" \" You lie on your side next to her, as close as possible but not touching, lazily trailing your fingers around her body noting where she shivers at your touch.\" Dino's breath shortened a little without him realizing… How did the man know that this was one of his favourite ways of inducing a session of slow love making… \" You move again, this time trailing your kisses around her back, concentrating on those most sensitive spots you had noted earlier… She moans softly, and you know that she is going to allow you to continue, wants you to continue…\" Your fingers trail up her ribs and come into contact with the soft yielding part of her breast, resulting in a shudder across her whole body… Part of you wants to take her now, fast and hard – you know she would not mind… She would enjoy it just as much as you – the energy consumed making you both feel alive, vibrant… Yet you put the thought to one side… You want to take it slowly… You want to show her how much you love her… and that cannot be done properly unless you take your time…\" Ortega allowed himself a soft smile, he had noticed Dino's fists clench and saw that his words were having an impact on the man's mind, why else would his body react to mere words… \" Your partner is still wearing her bikini, but you are happy to see that it is one that ties at the back and sides… Slowly you undo the strings, dropping kisses on her back to keep her mind elsewhere… You hear her breathing deepen for a moment as she tries to anticipate your next move, so you keep her waiting a little more…\" \" Slowly you move your kisses from her spine around to one side, and gently roll her towards you, your kisses following a rib, moving upwards towards the soft skin of her breast… your hand reaches gently across to the other and begins to softly massage the nipple with your thumb as your mouth reaches the other… Teasing her with your tongue…\" \" You hear her breathe in sharply, see her eyes close in pleasure, feel her hands on your back as she finally responds to your move… You cannot help but harden at her touch, knowing that she needs you… wants you… Yet still you wait…\" \" Your kisses travel upwards once more, following her collar bone to her shoulder then across to her neck, offered to you as she drops back her head… As your kisses move along her jaw, you hear her voice whispering your name… almost begging you to join with her…\" Dino squirmed; the images in his mind were driving him insane… He wanted to be doing, not listening… Ortega's words were turning him on so much that if a woman had walked into the room and touched him at that instant he would have been helpless in her hands, only wanting to satisfy his need for intimate contact… \" As your lips touch, you grant her wish, slowly easing yourself inside… Taking your time, enjoying the sensations you can feel in your own body, feeling the shudder running through hers… She moans softly at your entrance and you feel her lifting underneath you… Allowing you deeper access, you take it, slowly, softly… Gently…\" \" Building a rhythm, you move together, she's asking you, begging you to lift her to a higher plane… In return you ask her to do the same for you… and she responds, willingly, giving herself to you as much as she can, holding nothing back…\" \" After a short while, you hear her whimper and know that the sensations running through her body are no longer hers to control… She moans as you drive deeper into her body… Lifts as you push harder… Her body and mind are yours, to do with as you wish…\" \" You can break her, stop where you are… Satisfy yourself and do nothing for her… But that would leave you empty inside… You have done it to others, why is she different?\" \" She is different because you love her… It is difficult for you to tell her so, but through loving her, you know she understands… How? Because she knows you as well as she knows herself… because she loves you in return…\" \" You feel her shaking beneath you… Hear her cry out as she reaches the final point, her rapture extending to you… you push a little harder wanting to join her in that moment of ecstasy… She clings to you, helping you…\" \" You too reach the final plane… exhausted by your efforts, calling her name… Her kisses restore you, return you to the earth, as your breathing returns to normal, you look deeply into her eyes, see the love that she has for you and smile…You will never forget her and how much you love her…\" Dino sat bolt upright on the bed, his eyes wide open, shaking… Emilio smiled, knowing that the red-head needed physical release and directed him to the bathroom…[Chapter 4] Thenfollowing day, the group of men split up and went their separatenways. Mike and Simone had appeared at breakfast with the team'snpersonal gear and within the hour Alberto and his men had gone. Thensix of them heading for home, they all needed a break. Dinonremained behind a little longer, spending a little time with EmilionOrtega who was leaving for home that afternoon. \"Thank you for yournhelp Mr Ortega, I appreciate what you have done for me. Can you tellnme though, the last image… Why did you go there?\" Orteganchuckled, \"The image takes us down to our most basic instincts –npassion, lust, love… Those that came before bring in friendship,ncompassion… They build and consolidate your feelings for both womenn– the last helps you to separate them – if that is possible.\" Dinonlooked directly at Ortega, \"I think I understand…\" Emilionsmiled, \"I am glad I could help… Tell me, after my little story…nDid you see a face? Did it answer your question?\" Dinonsighed and nodded slightly, \"I did… Now I have to go and dealnwith the consequences…\" &&& Terrynwas stunned at the news he received on his e-mail that morning. Dino,nthe team and Ortega had turned up in Tblisi completely out of thenblue after a trek across the mountains that had taken them the bestnpart of a week. Hencalled Jackie, not surprised when she began crying with relief tonhear that Dino and the team were ok. After a few moments her tearsneased and she began to chuckle, \"We'd better get ready, he'sngoing to be starving when he comes home after a week with barely anynfood… Marcello better be warned.\" Terrynwas about to answer when Sally contacted him on the intercom… \"Younhave an overseas call Mr Thorne… Someone asking if you still haventhe candles burning…\" Terrynchuckled at the confusion in the secretary's voice and cut the linento Jackie, promising to call her back later… \"Dino…nSo your Irish luck held out after all… You gave us quite a scare…\" Dinonchuckled, \"Nothing to do with luck… We had some help fromnupstairs… Did you know that Ortega used to be a priest?\" Terrynwas surprised by the information and said so. \"So how are you…?nYou sound ok…\" Dinonwas quiet for a few minutes, making Terry a little worried, \"I'm…ngood… Damn it… I'm sorry Ter… Being out here has made menrealize that I've been a real ass over the last few months… Inscrewed up… It won't happen again…\" Terrynsmiled, \"That's ok mate… We can sort things out when you getnback. When does your flight get in to New York, I'll pick you upnmyself…\" \"I'mnnot coming back Terry… Not yet anyway… I have a few things tonsort out first…\" Dino's voice went quiet, \"I have to work outna few things on my own… I need a couple of days to sort myselfnout…\" Terrynsighed, \"Take as long as you like Dino… Just let me know wherenyou're going… and keep in touch…\" Dinonacknowledged Terry's request and softly cut the line. Thinking tonhimself for a few moments, he called Mike and asked him to arrange anflight to the UK, where he could spend some time alone. After that henwould have to choose… Home to New York… or Argentina… Whatevernhe chose to do, he had to talk to Gaby… &&&&&&&& Gabynstepped out onto the terrace, smiling at the team members that hadncome along for the barbecue. Alvaro and Joachim were taking it innturns to spin the suckling pig that had been placed on the spit overnthe fire nearby. She knew that the gauchos had come in from thenpampas and prepared the ground oven with the beef that they had alsonbrought with them. The smell of cooking food was making her mouthnwater and thanks to Consuella, she was feeling a lot better. Hernsister in law had given her time and space to think things throughnnow they had realized that things had really started going wrongnabout six months before she had come home, but she still couldn'tnquite work out whether it was something she had done or Dino hadnsaid. Theynhad their ups and downs, yes, but six months before they had had anbitter argument over dinner and everything had gone down hill fromnthere. Gaby was still racking her brains to try and work out what thenargument had been about. Shensighed, after that particular meal she had tried to make things up tonhim, apologizing for mistakes she had made – both at home and atnwork. At first he had grudgingly accepted her apology and the tensionnbetween them had reduced for a while, but the harder she worked, thenmore irritated Dino seemed to become. Shenhad tried to talk to him, but admitted to herself that maybe shenhadn't tried hard enough. Dino had been under a lot of stress, bothnhe and Terry having to fly overseas on negotiations that hadn'tngone well… \"Pennynfor your thoughts…\" Gabynsmiled at Consuella, over the last couple of weeks the two of themnhad become very close, \"Just thinking…\" Thenlook on Gaby's face made Consuella realize what she was thinkingnabout, \"Any answers?\" Gabynshook her head… \"All I get is more questions…\" Consuellantook a deep breath, she had come to a single conclusion – afternhearing the news from Terry through Eduardo. \"Maybe Dino has thenanswers you need. You need to speak to him Gaby.\" Gabynswallowed and answered softly, \"I know… But I'm scared… Inwalked out on him Consuella, it will have hurt him, a lot… What ifnI go to New York and he doesn't want to talk to me?\" Consuellansat next to her and put her arm around Gaby's shoulders, \"Hownabout I come with you…?\" Gabynstared at her, \"But… You're afraid of flying… Would younreally come with me? I really want to sort this out… I miss him…\" Consuellannodded, \"If it will help… Of course I'll come…\" Gabyncouldn't help the tears, but they were no longer of pain and anger,nnow they were of relief… and hope. &&&& Consuellanstood quietly beside Eduardo, watching the Gauchos demonstrate theirnprowess with their boleadoras and passing on the news that she hadnpersuaded Gaby to return to New York – with company – and wasnstartled to receive a hug and kiss. \"Younmay not need to… I just wish Gaby was a little more prepared… Inthink she might get a fright this evening.\" Consuellanwas confused for a moment, when the implication of Eduardo's wordsnbegan to sink in, \"He's at the hacienda…?\" Eduardonquickly put his finger on her lips, \"Shh… No-one knows apart fromnthe two of us, Alvaro and Joachim… They just brought him down fromnBuenos Aires…\" Consuellanwas worried, \"It's too soon Eduardo… She's not ready to seenhim. She's only just accepted that she has to speak to him.\" Eduardonsighed, \"I know, but a few days ago he turned up at Caesar's,ndemanding to speak to Gaby. I managed to persuade him to wait ancouple of days, but he's not going to wait any longer.\" Consuellansighed, she hoped Dino knew what he was doing. &&& Gabynsmiled, several team members had brought their families to thenbarbecue and had already started dancing with their partners, feetntapping to the beat. She found herself slightly moving her shouldersnto the rhythm and sighed, it seemed as if a weight had lifted off hernshoulders, now that she had acknowledged the need to return to NewnYork. Shenstill felt afraid of seeing Dino again, but if Consuella did travelnwith her, it might just give her the strength she needed to do this.nLost in her thoughts, she did not notice Alvaro approaching. \"DancenGaby?\" Glancingnup she gave Alvaro a smile, \"Sorry Alvaro, I'm not in the mood…nMaybe another time…\" Alvaronfeigned mock horror, \"Help someone… Gaby's forgotten how tondance…\" Shouts accompanied his comment several in denial orndisbelief. Gabynshook her head and began to chuckle, \"Little brother, you will benthe death of me…\" Grabbingnher hand, Alvaro pulled Gaby upright, \"Then you know I won't takenno for an answer… C'mon Gaby… We haven't seen you dance fornages…\" Lookingnskywards, Gaby allowed him to drag her to the dancing area, wherenthey joined other couples. When the Tango beat started, shenhesitated, but with Alvaro fooling around, she began to laugh anlittle and stayed where she was. Afternchanging partners a few times, Gaby realized that she was beginningnto enjoy herself, she had been so down for a while she had almostnforgotten how to have fun, but the team were certainly helping her tonmake up for it now. As a feeling of warmth spread through her body,nshe felt happy to be where she was – surrounded by people she wasnproud to call family. &&& \"Challenge…nChallenge… Challenge…\" Thenchant went up a short while later, Gaby dropped her head and shooknher head, trying not to smile. It was a tradition in the family thatnsomeone would dance blindfold and try to identify their partners…nAs head of the household, Eduardo stepped forward with a small blacknbag… Insidenwere two small markers, one painted black, the other white – thenblack marker indicated that a male member of the family had to benblindfold, the white – female. Presenting the bag to Consuella,nEduardo grinned at the calls and cheers as she pulled out the whitenmarker… Gabynchuckled, but became a little wary, she was the eldest of then'family' women and including Consuella and Benito's wifenAlexia, there were now only five of them… The white marker wentnback into the bag, now it would be white for the married women, blacknfor the single. Eduardonheld the bag in front of Alvaro who reached inside and pulled out thenblack marker… Gaby swallowed, it was down to her and a cousin. Partnof her wanted to run, another was curious and wanted to see who wouldnbe selected… \"Younare the eldest Gaby… You have to choose your colour.\" Glancingnaround, Gaby sighed, everyone was watching in anticipation – shenhad taken part in the challenge several times before. Then names hadnbeen written on paper, but as there were only two of them the markersncould be used again. \"Well,nI'm dressed in white, so I guess that's what I'll choose…\" Eduardonpresented the bag to Joachim, unknown to Gaby, the white marker hadnbeen cut on one end making a point. Joachim made a play of taking hisntime, as he felt for the marker he wanted. Taking his hand, which wasnclosed around the marker, out of the bag, he made a great play ofnteasing the two girls. Gabynbegan to laugh, but quickly became silent when she saw the whitenmarker sitting on the palm of his hand… She wasn't sure if shenwanted to do this, but it was a tradition… Eduardonsmiled, and called for ten men to step forward \"As my sister hasnnot been here for a while, it is only fair that we give her a clue…nTo win the challenge, she must identify at least eight of you.\" Gabynshook her head and began to smile, Eduardo had made sure she wasn'tnunder too much pressure, though three of the men that stepped forwardnwere newcomers to the Artemis team and she didn't know them sonwell. Eduardo'snvoice brought her back from her thoughts, \"So, sis… Do you acceptnthe challenge?\" Gabyngave a soft smile, \"I do… Eight from ten?\" Eduardo nodded andnstepped forwards with the blindfold trying to hide the relief on hisnface that they had managed to draw Gaby in. Afternthe first four partners, Gaby was almost laughing out loud, she hadneasily identified them – especially Alvaro, who was deliberatelynfooling around, trying to make her laugh. Gonzalo and Antonio she hadndanced with several times before and knew their style and her brothernBenito was another easy mark. Nextnwas one of the newer members, but she realized he was much tallernthan her and broad in the shoulders so he was not so difficult. Nextncame Joachim, followed by one of her cousins, then one of the olderngauchos, whom she had known as a child and nicknamed 'Lolo'. Asnshe identified all her partners correctly, the clapping grew and thencheers became louder and the chant began again… Eduardonchuckled, \"What'll it be Gaby… Do you want to go for yournrecord?\" Gabynlaughed, she had once correctly identified 15 partners and was anlittle tempted… She had begun the day sad and thoughtful, but nownshe had started to enjoy herself, feeling her old confidencenreturning. She paused for a moment, thinking… \"Why not?\" Threenmore partners came her way and she identified them correctly,nincluding Eduardo himself. As she named him, his hand releasing hers,nanother took its place on her shoulder, slowly turning her around.nGaby was confused for a moment, but as she was led through the stepsnof a classical Tango, she realized that the person she was dancingnwith was disguising their style. Shenalmost froze as a thought went through her mind, it couldn't be…nCould it? She took a deep breath, the touch was a little firmer thannshe was used to, but the way the hand rested on her hip… That wasnso familiar, she almost pulled away, but her mystery partner spun hernin a slow half circle and pulled her close. Thenmove sent her heart racing, but with it came panic. It couldn't bentrue… She wasn't ready for this… When the arm wrapped aroundnher waist, she had no further doubts, her voice coming out as a halfnsob, \"Dino…?\" Pullingnoff the blindfold she turned slightly, not believing what she couldnsee. The look on his face was sad, but there was no anger in his eyesnwhich she had expected, just pain. She swallowed not knowing what tonsay, but she could feel the fear rising up inside, she wasn't readynfor this, wasn't ready to face him, not just yet. Dinonsaw the panic in Gaby's eyes, but the fact that she hadn't pullednaway immediately gave him hope that they could sort things out. That,nand the fact that Eduardo had told him that Gaby had accepted thenneed to return to New York. He could no longer hold back his feelingsnand softly touched his lips to her shoulder. Gaby froze in his arms,ntrying to lighten her tension Dino did something he had never done,nlifting her hand and kissing the back softly… Gabynpulled away instantly and ran… Grabbing the first horse she couldnsee, she vaulted into the saddle and disappeared into the darkness. Dinonswore, he'd been a fool, underestimated the pain Gaby must havenbeen in, he should have taken a little longer, taken her to one sidento talk first, rebuild her trust slowly, now he would never catchnher. A hand on his shoulder made him turn and he came face to facenwith Eduardo, \"Come with me Dino… I know where she's gone.\" Anfew moments later they were both on horseback, Eduardo leading himnaway from the hacienda at a steady pace. Gaby's brother saidnnothing, until they reached the river. \"Can you make out that treenover there?\" Dino nodded, \"She'll probably have left her horsenthere. Be careful, I hope you can sort things out.\" Dinoncaught Eduardo's arm, \"Thanks for helping me out, I just hopenshe'll give me a chance to explain.\" Eduardongave Dino a smile, \"You gave her a big fright Dino… But I thinknshe'll listen, if you take her easy… She does love you, you know…nThat has to count for something.\" Dinonslowly got off Bianca, reaching up to give Eduardo's hand ansqueeze; he took a deep breath, \"Wish me luck…\" Henwatched for a moment as Eduardo quietly moved back in the directionnthey had come, then turned and began to walk to the tree that Eduardonhad pointed out. &&& Gaby sat at the side of the river, sobbing quietlynto herself… She had done it again, run away from the man she loved. Would he ever understand why? Probablynnot … and she wouldn't blame him, innfact, if he left the hacienda she would probably never see him againnconsidering the way she had reacted. The kiss on her hand, shenrealised that for him it meant one thing, but for her it also broughtnback terrifying memories. Memories that had caused her worst fear tonre-surface.[Chapter 5] Dinonquietly led Bianca to the other horse which was cropping grass nearnsome smaller trees. Carefully he tied the two of them to a strongntree root to stop them running away, if Gaby spotted him, she wouldnrun again. Hopefully this would slow her down. Cautiouslynhe moved closer to the river bank watching where he was placing hisnfeet, not to give Gaby warning that he was close by. At the samentime, his eyes scanned in front of him, looking for her. Just as henwas about to swear at the darkness, the moon sailed out from behind ancloud and bathed the whole area with moonlight. Dinongasped, the moon picked out Gaby beautifully, the white linen dressngleaming in the soft light. His heart lurched, the sight enforcingnhow much he loved her… Missed her… First however, he had somendamage to undo, had to talk to her, make her understand that it wasnnot her similarities to Cass that made him love her, but thendifferences. Henmoved closer, changing the angle slightly – in the light he couldnsee the fallen log and worked his way around it. Suddenly Gaby stoodnup as if alerted by something, Dino froze and stared. The moonlightnwas shining through Gaby's dress, highlighting the shape of hernbody. Her stance reminded Dino of a deer, proud but wary, henswallowed deeply feeling the attraction spreading through his body,ndid she know how beautiful she was…? Carefullynhe began to move forward, the closer he got the more difficult it wasngoing to be. Gaby's head snapped around in his direction and henfroze again, praying that she hadn't seen him. He was just about tonmove when Gaby started to walk towards him, then stopped to sit on anlarge rock. She was much closer – so close that he could hear thenquiet sobs coming from her. Thensound cut through Dino like a knife, would he be able to make Gabynunderstand that he was sorry? Would she accept that he hadn'tnrealized that he was comparing her and Cass so much? In his despair,nhe inadvertently stepped on a broken twig. Gabynwas on her feet immediately searching for the source of the sound.nSeeing her glance up toward the horses, he knew she had spottednBianca. Quickly he tried to close the gap between them, but it wasntoo late, she was already gone. Henwas about to chase after her when he changed his mind and returned tonthe horses, she was sure to make her way in this direction. Crouchingndown, he brought all of his senses to bear on the situation, eyesnscanning for movement, ears straining to catch the slightest sound.nSlowly feeling around with his hands, he found a few pebbles andngently tossed the first to where Gaby had been sitting on the rock. Lookingnaround, he saw nothing, but tried to work out where Gaby might be ifnshe was working her way back toward him. Tossing another stone intonthe undergrowth, he spotted a slight movement and smiled, but decidednto wait. Gaby had not been the Artemis team leader for nothing andnwould be very careful. Gabynsank to her knees trying to catch her breath, she needed to think.nWas Dino behind her, or in front of her? She couldn't tell and itnthrew her slightly that he had followed her. The kiss on the shouldernthat he had given her supplied an answer to her questions, but shencouldn't believe it. For the answer to be true, something must havenchanged him since they had last been together – arguing andnfighting - but she couldn't think of anything… Ansound to her right stopped her thoughts. She froze where she was,ntrying to see something… Anything, but Dino was dressed in jeansnand a dark polo shirt and had an advantage. Another sound… closer,nGaby took a deep breath, she had to move… She wasn't ready tonface him yet, needed more time to think… If he was so angry withnher… pushed her away, why had he come here? Hope flared inside,nmaybe… just maybe he would give her a little time? Shenmoved carefully and slowly, before stopping near the tree andnrealized that the horses had been tied. Swearing inside, she knewnDino had done it to slow her down, for a brief moment she almostnsmiled, it was so like him… before the situation came back to hernand she sighed, she just needed a little space... if only for onenmore day… Lookingnaround cautiously, she could see nothing and slowly crept out of herncover… &&&& Dinonheaved a sigh of relief, Gaby was still moving, seeing her making hernway towards the horses, he froze in place. Praying that she would notntake Bianca, the only horse he had the confidence to sit on, henwaited… Just a little longer… Gabyncrouched over the tree root, feeling for the knot with her hands andnslowly working it undone… Smiling thankfully to herself she liftednthe rein and was just about to swing on to the horse when she sensednmovement behind her and was enveloped in two strong arms. Pressure on her wrist caused her to drop the rein,nbut it didn't stop her from struggling to get away from Dino whonwas holding onto her as if his life depended on it. He was carefulnnot to give Gaby room to manoeuvre as henknew then she would use her Martial Arts ability to get away. Tighteningnhis grip, he pulled her away from the horses, even though he knew henwas probably hurting her a little. A little pain now was nothing tonhow she had been hurting over the last few months and it was hisnfault. The further he moved away, the more Gaby struggled, but nownDino finally had her in his arms, he was not going to let go. Hencould feel her fingernails scraping at the back of his hand as shentried to pry his fingers off her body. Dinonlocked his grip around her and pulled her more tightly to his chestnso he could whisper in her ear, if he spoke slowly and quietly, henmight just get her to calm down a little. \"Gaby… Please…\" Thenstruggles increased for a moment before she answered him, notnshouting or crying out, but quietly and full of bitterness and pain,n\"Let me go Dino… Leave me alone…\" \"No…\" Dinonheard the half sob of frustration, as she struggled a bit more,n\"Dino… Please let me go…\" \"No…nNearly three years ago, I promised that I would always be here fornyou… That I would never let you go… I'm not going back on thatnpromise…\" Stillnstruggling, Gaby's voice dripped with bitterness and pain, \"Sonwhy did you push me away…? Why were you so angry with me…?\" Dinonsighed, \"I didn't mean to… Gaby, please can we talk about thisnwithout you fighting me?\" Gabynpaused in her struggle, dropping her head, \"I tried to talk to you…nYou shut me out…\" \"Inknow… I'm sorry… I didn't realize…\" Dino could feel thentension through Gaby's body as she struggled with herself to make andecision. \"Please Gaby… I love you… I don't want to losenyou…\" Tearsncame to Gaby's eyes; Dino had never actually expressed his love fornher verbally before… A glance or a touch, or the expression on hisnface yes, but he had never actually said anything… until now. Shensighed and stopped her fight for a moment, feeling Dino relax hisnarms, but he did not let her go. However, the feeling was different,ninstead of being constrained, she now felt secure… protected… Itnwas a moment or two before she realized that Dino was gentlyncaressing her hip with a thumb, it was something he always did whennthey were curled up together on the sofa… The memory gave her anbrief surge of optimism… Could they get through this? \"Gaby?\" Hisnvoice was soft, gentle and Gaby's heart ached at the sound of it.n\"Ok… I'm listening…\" Dinonsighed with relief and released her. Offering a hand, which she tooknslowly, he led her to the edge of the river where they could sit downnmore comfortably and took a few moments to light a small fire so theyncould see each other better. Taking a deep breath, he wondered wherento begin. Talking about his feelings was not easy for him, he hadnalways been a man of action until he went into K&R; – butnnegotiating was nothing compared with this. He needed to win Gabynback, all he had for the moment was a tentative truce… Gabynlooked at him carefully, saw the emotions flowing across his face,nnever had she seen him like this. As she watched, she saw him take andeep breath, obviously unsure where to start. \"Gaby…nmay I ask you something?\" Thenquestion took Gaby by surprise, but she nodded her head in response,ncurious to see what he wanted to know. \"Beforenme… How many men did you actually have a long term relationshipnwith…?\" Gabynwas stunned, it was not what she expected, or wanted, to hear. Shenwas about to move away, her anger beginning to rise as she thoughtnthat Dino sought to blame her for their split. Looking at his facenhowever made her stay in her place, Dino's eyes were sad, holdingnher, watching her for a reaction, almost pleading for an answer. \"Fromnthe age of 16 I had three boyfriends… Two were just the usualnteenage thing – a couple of kisses and cuddles… The third was atnuniversity for about a year, until…\" Gaby stopped abruptly, notnwanting to continue. \"Until…?\" Gabynshook her head and turned from him, Dino caught her hand, pulled hernback slowly. Seeing the fear and pain in her eyes he had an ideanabout what she didn't want to say. \"Gaby please talk to me, Indon't want to make the mistake of not listening to you again.\" Gabynreleased a soft sob, glancing up she saw the concern in his eyes. Sawnthat he realized that this was not associated with him, but that henwas still there for her. Dino remained silent waiting for an answer,nfeeling her tremble a little he turned slightly to sit opposite her,nclasping each of her hands in his. Liftingnone hand toward his lips he was startled by Gaby's terrified tonenof voice, \"Dino don't… Please.\" Thenlook of dread on her face gave him an idea… \"Gaby, why is it anproblem?\" Gabynshook her head, \"Just don't… ok…\" Releasingna hand, he placed a finger under her chin and lifted it gently,n\"Gaby… What happened…?\" Gabynbegan to sob a little more. \"I can't…\" Dino sighed andndropped his head, making her stomach turn over, he looked so sad.nGaby bit her lip, if they were going to fix this, she needed to talknto him. \"It was how it started…\" Dinonlooked up, he had barely heard what Gaby had said, so quiet was thenwhisper. \"How what started…?\" Gabyntook a deep breath, and told him about the relationship she had hadnat university. How she'd started dating a fellow student, \"Henseemed really nice, and everything was slow with him – he nevernpushed me to meet up with him, though we saw each other every day. Itnwas as if we were just really good friends more than anything else.\" Dinonremained silent, afraid to speak in case Gaby stopped talking.nAntonio had told him what he knew about the incident, but hearing itnfrom Gaby gave him another perspective. He gently squeezed her handnto encourage her to continue. \"Afternabout six months, he got more serious, which I was ok with, but itnwasn't long before he was pushing me for more… I backed off… Indidn't think we were close enough for that… I wasn't ready, Inhad never…\" The tears started to slide down Gaby's cheeks asnshe began to remember what had happened more clearly – she hadnlocked it away for so long. \"He stopped pushing so hard, so I begannto relax around him again… Then he organized a surprise party fornme… It was my 21st…nHe said we should celebrate it properly…\" Shenwent on to tell Dino how the party was held in one of the othernstudent's lodgings and how many people turned up. How much fun theynhad, and how much people were drinking… and how at about 3am mostnpeople had left. \"There was him and a few friends… Only aboutnfour or five girls…\" Gabynbegan to shake and Dino quickly pulled her close and held herntightly, understanding that he might not hear much more. His stomachnwas already sick at the thought of what he knew had happened next,nbut Gaby wasn't finished. \"Inhadn't drunk very much – I never was a drinker, but around thatntime someone spiked my drink… I remember him leading me upstairsnsaying that it was time I had my birthday present… and he and threenof his friends had something special lined up for me… He kissed thenback of my hands…\" Gabynbroke down, unable to say anymore and Dino was glad she didn't,nalready full of rage at what had been done to her at the hands ofnfour uncaring young men furious that her first time had been so roughnand full of terror. They had ruined Gaby's life completely, thoughnhe had to admit that the Artemis organization would probably not havencome into existence until Eduardo had returned… and he never wouldnhave met her under the same circumstances. Changingnposition, he wrapped his arms around her and let Gaby cry herselfnout… By telling him her story, she had renewed her trust in him.nNow he would have to do the same. &&&& Itnwas a while before Gaby stopped crying. Dino had pulled her close,nher head tucked into his neck for comfort. As she became quieter, hengently leaned his head on hers and gave her a soft kiss on thenforehead. She stiffened a little, but began to relax almostnimmediately, as she let out a sigh Dino took a deep breath, he stillnneeded some answers to confirm some thoughts he had, but first… \"Younpoor baby… If that's what happened to you your first…\" Dinonpaused, \"No wonder you became so distrustful of everyone. It's anwonder you ended up with me…\" Gabynpulled away a little, a curious expression on her face, blinking awaynthe tears in her eyes, she voiced her question, \"But I've alwaysntrusted you… Almost from the first day we met… Why would you saynthat?\" Dinongave a half smile, \"because you never really knew me Gaby… Whatnyou saw was a man broken by tragedy, a man who barely did enough tonlive. I have to admit there were times I considered ending it all,nbut I couldn't, I don't know why. Then I met you… and younhelped me to see that I needed to live again.\" \"Gaby,nmy first wife and I were very close, but when I joined the DeltanForce, she became afraid… Afraid that I would get hurt… Killedneven, but it was my job, what I had signed up to do… Looking back –nI have to admit, I enjoyed it, I felt I was making a difference, evennif it was a small one.\" \"Somenof the things I saw shocked me and over time, I began to change. Inhad to hide away my feelings, become cold otherwise I wouldn't havenbeen able to cope. Unfortunately it made me cold to everyone, slowlynI began to lose my friends, my family stopped visiting because theyndidn't like the change in my character – I can't say I blamenthem.\" \"Carolnand I started having bad fights – she wanted me to leave the Army,nI wanted to stay. In the end she threatened to walk out on me if Indidn't change my job. At the time I still loved her – I didn'tnwant her to leave, so I did as she asked…\" Gabynlistened, entranced. Dino had never spoken about his first marriagenand all Jackie had known was that the break up had not been pleasantnso she had decided never to ask him about it. \"What did you do?\" Dinongave a half chuckle, half sigh… \"I joined Luthan Risk…\"nGaby's eyes opened wide as Dino continued, \"at first Carol wasnhappy – we had a nice house in London and she liked the fact that Inwas helping people. What she didn't know was that I was also doingnthe extractions…\" Gabyngave a quiet chuckle, \"I bet that landed you in trouble when shenfound out…\" Dinongave her a soft smile, \"Yeah well… To cut a long story short, wenhad a terrible fight about it. She didn't even give me the chancento explain… When I came home after the next job, she had left… Inwas furious, the divorce came through shortly after – she gotnherself a really hot attorney and the two of them really did me over.nI was left with barely the clothes I was wearing.\" Hensmiled to himself, \"That was when Terry helped me out, as a resultnwe've been friends ever since. He was also newly divorced and thentwo of us hung out together, with one difference… Terry left thengirls alone, didn't want to get burned again… Me – I went thenopposite way, I was bitter, I wanted revenge against all women… Indid to them what Carol had done to me…\" Gabynwanted to interrupt, but Dino stopped her with a finger on her lips.n\"Gaby, at times I was no better than the four young men that hurtnyou… I would use a woman for my own needs and then drop herncompletely. If I saw her in a bar the next day, I would ignore her,nhappy to see the pain I caused.\" Gabynfound her voice, \"What changed?\" Dinonsighed, \"Terry sorted me out a bit… and I had a rough job… Innearly lost my life. It made me take a new look at things, I leftnLuthan Risk and went freelance… Then Terry left and we started upnon our own. Unfortunately I had built up a bit of a habit where thengirls were concerned though… It was a while before I broke that…\" Gabyndropped her head, \"Cass…\" Dinonnodded, \"First she was just an acquaintance at Luthan Risk, then Inmanaged to poach her from the New York office when Terry and I openednup… She was always around… Helped me out… One day I realizednthat there was something going on and I challenged her… She totallynflipped me out… After that, all I wanted was her…\" Dinonfell silent, Gaby knew the rest of the story and he didn't feelnlike talking about it again. Partly, because the memories of that daynstill hurt, but mainly because he didn't want to hurt Gaby anymorenthan he already had. But there was more that he needed to tell her,nor did he? Telling her about the girl from Patrick's bar wouldndefinitely hurt her and he didn't want to risk losing her again,nbut at the same time he wanted to be honest with Gaby or hisnconscious would never let him forget. & Dinonwas brought out of his thoughts when Gaby sighed. \"We make a rightnpair, don't we.\" Dinonreleased her slightly, sensing that she was a little uneasy withntheir close contact now that their emotions were returning to a moreneven keel, though he kept his arms loosely wrapped around hernshoulders. \"We both had a hard past Gaby. It created what we arennow, though yours was worse. I could have changed who I was at anyntime… but I didn't want to. You were trapped because of whatnhappened to you.\" Gabynshook her head to deny Dino's words, but he refused to stop. \"Gaby…nYou never had the chance to rebuild your life. You never had anothernrelationship after that first time did you?\" Gabyndropped her head, \"I was too afraid… Just a hand on the shouldernwould make me want to scream. I lost myself in my studies and mynarchery training. When I came home for a break, I told Dad whatnhappened, he was furious, but couldn't do anything more about it.\" \"Didnyou report what happened to the police at least?\" Gabynnodded, \"and I had to testify in court… I barely managed… Butnone of my friends and a female detective really helped me to getnthrough it. As soon as it was over I came home.\" Dinonwas intrigued, Gaby had never spoken about that period in her life sonnow he was hearing about it first hand. \"What did you do?\" \"Dadnencouraged me in my archery training – and taught me basic selfndefense, which started to lead into hand to hand combat. Slowly henintroduced me to the Black Angel teams, helped me to startnre-building my trust in other men… By the time I returned tonuniversity to do my Masters after the summer break, I was feeling anlot better.\" Dinonwas confused, when he had met Gaby, she had been terrified to be outnamong people not part of the organization. Seeing the look on hisnface Gaby sighed and explained further. \"Instarted my Masters and decided to extend my studies, only going homenat Christmas, Easter and during the summer.\" She smiled slightly,n\"it was a couple of years later that I met up with a verynaggressive young bull while we were out hunting.\" Dinonreturned the smile, \"and Artemis was reborn…\" Gabynsmiled shyly before her expression turned sad, \"After that, Inreturned to do my final year – I had combined a couple of courses,nmeaning my Masters took me three years… It was while I was doing mynexams at the end of the year that Mum and Dad were killed.\" Gabynfell silent, Dino noticing that she still grieved for her parents,nbut also it no longer hurt her as much as it had. \"So you took overnArtemis…\" Shenshook her head. \"No, I had promised to go and work with a friendnfor a year, first on a dig in Crete, then doing research back at thenuniversity. I didn't want to go back on my promise, though for anwhile, I wished I had.\" \"Why?\" Gaby swallowed and Dino could feel the tension building innher shoulders, \"What happened?\" Gabynsighed, she had told Dino the worst part, but this was almost as bad.n\"At the end of the year, I was getting ready to return to Argentinanwhen someone who was working with us told me that a group of studentsnfrom my original degree course were having a get together – a kindnof reunion. She persuaded me to go with her.\" \"Thenparty was good fun and I was enjoying myself, when I felt a hand onnmy shoulder.\" Gaby paused and Dino could see the remembered fear onnher face. \"When I turned around, it was my ex… I couldn'tnbelieve it… He had just got out of prison, served four years…\" \"Henteased me, said that we should get together 'for old times sake'…nI freaked out, left the party there and then. The next day I was onnthe plane home, but there was no Dad to speak to. When I arrived, thenBlack Angels had fallen apart, there were only a few left. Antonionwas keeping part of the covert side running with Caesar's help, sonI jumped in.\" \"Instarted training and working with the members that were left to buildnup the communications side, by the time we were ready to beginnoperational work, I had become too afraid to leave the hacienda.nSlowly I fixed that – getting my apartment in Buenos Aires andnworking with Caesar at the bar, it took me a long time, but withntheir help I managed, by locking away my past and developing my alternego…\" Gabynsighed and gave Dino a soft smile, \"Being Artemis made me feelnstronger, and in control of my life, but in time, she too began tontake over and I was trapped again… Until you came along…\" Dinonblushed, Gaby was now completely open to him, had shared everything,nbut there was still one thing he didn't quite understand. \"Whyndid you run Gaby? When I came home and found out that you had left,nit drove me insane.\" Gabynsighed, \"You had become so angry, I couldn't work it out. Artemisnwould have fought back, but I am no longer Artemis… Over the lastnfew years, you have helped me to rediscover myself and I don't wantnto lose that. Artemis is tough to live up to, though she is stillnaround.\" \"Younscared me Dino, and though I knew that you wouldn't hurt me, Inbecame too afraid. You helped me to defeat my past fears. I wasn'tngoing back there… So I ran…\" \"Inthought so… I'm such a damn fool…\" Gaby looked at him,nstartled, what the hell did Dino mean? She was about to ask when Dinoncontinued, \"I should have been more careful with the things Insaid.\" \"Whatndo you mean?\" Dinonbit his lip, \"Remember when you re-organised the office last year,nhow pleased Terry and I were.\" Gaby nodded, and he went on \"Donyou remember what I said?\" \"Younsaid that Cass would have done it the same way…\" Gaby wasnbaffled, Dino was obviously going somewhere with this, but where? Dinonsighed, \"I meant it as a compliment… I didn't mean to comparenyou with her…\" Gaby was mystified for a moment, couldn't worknout what he meant, \"Gaby… I realize now that on many occasions Incompared you with Cass… It wasn't my intention.\" Hernsilence encouraged him to continue, \"In certain aspects – at thenoffice for example, you and Cass are very similar and I liked whatnyou did, I still do… but it didn't mean that I wanted you to copynher, or do things the way she did all the time…\" Gabynfelt as if a veil had been lifted from her eyes… \"But the way younreacted at first… I thought…\" Confusionnflowed across her face and she stood quickly, walking to the edge ofnthe river, trying to think things through. Dino sighed and followednher, wanting to touch her, hold her in his arms, but he didn't wantnto push her too hard so he stood a little behind her, arms folded tonstop himself from making a move too soon. \"I know that now… You thought that I wantednyou to become more like Cass… because of the things I said… butnit just isn't like that. The more you copied her way of doingnthings, the more irritated I became… It's what makes youndifferent from Cass that causes me to love you… \" Dinonsaw Gaby's head turn slightly, almost looking at him over hernshoulder, waiting… Dino took a deep breath knowing that he wasn'tnout of the woods yet. However with her silence, came hope, she wasngiving him a chance to explain his behaviour. He took a step closer,nbarely an inch away, but it could have been a mile. \"Whennyou came to me in New York… I told you that I wasn't looking fornanother Cass… but you started to become her… I didn't wantnthat, I wanted you. I wanted the spirit inside of you, your sense ofnadventure, I didn't want you to change. It made me angry when younchanged too much; it was as if you were doing it on purpose, tryingnto take her place.\" Gabyndropped her head, \"and the angrier you became, the more I tried tondo things Cass' way, because I thought it's what you liked…nWhat you wanted…\" Dinonsighed and touched Gaby's cheek gently, \"Exactly, but not oncendid I ask you not to do it… I just expected you to realize that itnwas not what I wanted…\" \"Inforgot that you would be naive in that way, that you wouldn'tnunderstand, how could you? You've never been in this close anrelationship before. If only I had spoken to you, cleared things upnbefore they got worse…\" \"You mean this is all just a misunderstanding between us?\" Gabynwas furious with herself… Why hadn't she seen…? \"I am such annidiot…\" \"NonGaby… You did what you did to make me happy… Your heart was innthe right place…\" \"Maybe…nbut my brain was obviously not functioning…\" Dinonsuppressed a chuckle, \"But you thought you were doing the rightnthing… I could have asked you to stop, but I didn't…\" Gabynlet out an exasperated sigh… \"So you want to take the blame fornall this…? I could have done something, said something…\" Dinondropped his head, \"You did… but I closed you out. I wouldn'tnspeak to you. I'm sorry.\" Gabyngroaned… \"Are you going on a guilt trip…? Don't… I shouldnhave realized.\" Dinonchuckled, \"Ok... Seeing as you insist on taking part of the blame,ncan I at least ask if I'm forgiven?\" Gaby looked at him shyly andnnodded, heaving a sigh of relief he pulled her close to him, feelingnher snuggle closer, \"Thank you… I'm sorry I hurt you so much…nCan we start again?\" Gabynhesitated, she wanted to be with Dino, but now she knew what hadnhappened, she also wanted things to be right, \"I would like to, butnI cannot live with a ghost Dino… She will win every time… Inalways got the feeling that I wasn't measuring up to Cass' way,nher standards… That's why I tried so much harder.\" Dinonsighed, \"Was it that bad?\" Gaby nodded, and saw the pain crossnhis face, \"I don't mean to do it Gaby, honestly. I'll try, butnsometimes…\" Gabynput her finger on his lips, \"That's all I need to know… You trynnot to compare and I'll try not to remind you of Cass… At leastnnow, I know that you don't mean anything by it.\" Dinonsmiled softly, \"Can we make a promise… Here and now…?\" Gabyngave him a curious look, \"Go on…\" \"I'llnpromise that if something bugs me, I'll try to talk to you about itnand not assume that you'll get the hint… In return… You promisenthat you'll do things that make both of us happy… Please don'tndo things just because you know I like it that way… You have to benhappy with it too… We're strongest as equals Gaby…we alwaysnhave been.\" Gabynsmiled and closed her eyes for a moment before answering, \"I thinknI can manage that…\" Dinongrinned and pulled her to his chest, wrapping his arms around hernonce more. Gaby melted into him, glad that they had sorted thingsnout, but there was a question in her mind… \"Dino… Why did itntake you so long to realise? You normally work things out quickly –nyou always sensed when I wasn't feeling right. Consuella was aboutnto put me on a plane and drag me to New York to sort things out, shenmust have realized what had happened…\" Dinonblushed, \"At first, I was just so angry that you had left withoutnsaying anything, I didn't want to see you… ever… Then a daynafter coming home, I had to go back out. The guy who had been takennspoke to me when we got him out, made me start thinking. Then I begannto put things together…\" Gabynstopped him, \"You brought a guy out? Dinonswallowed, knowing he was in trouble and nodded his head, acceptingnGaby's telling off… \"You promised me Dino… That you wouldnnever go on another operation. That you would only do thennegotiations… What the hell were you thinking?\" Dinonbegan to chuckle, infuriating Gaby even more, \"What's so funny?\" \"You…\"nCatching her wrist as she tried to move away, Dino sat down andnpulled her down alongside him, \"You're angry with me fornsomething I promised you I wouldn't do anymore, when I thought younwere no longer part of my life.\" Gabyngave him a sheepish look, \"I guess you didn't really care whatnyou'd promised me at the time.\" Dinonnodded, \"I thought I'd lost you, didn't want to think about younnot being there when I got home. The team were a man short, so I wentnwith them to take my mind off you. I'm glad I did. By the time Ingot home, I'd sorted everything out in my mind… Knew I had toncome and find you, fix what went wrong.\" Gabynsighed, \"I'm glad you came… I'm sorry I ran – I just wasn'tnready for you to turn up out of the blue like that.\" Giving him ansideways glance she chuckled softly, \"I'm glad you remembered hownto Tango…\" Dinongrinned, \"That's not all I remember…\" Gaby gave him an archnlook, which made him chuckle \"I also remember that I need tonapologise…\" Gabynwas confused, \"You already did…\" Dinongave a wicked chuckle… \"Not properly…\" Pushing her gently tonher back, Dino gave Gaby a soft kiss, \"Now… Can I make it up tonyou for being such an ass…?\" Gabyngave him a soft smile, \"Not here…\" Dinonpaused; his lips had just been making their way along Gaby'snshoulder, causing her skin to shiver when she had spoken. \"You wantnto go back?\" Gabynchuckled, \"No… but I've got something digging in my back…\"nDino almost jumped up in concern, apologizing for not being morenattentive. Gaby became a little annoyed, \"For goodness sake –nstop apologizing… It's not like you…\" Shenstood up and began to walk away, \"Gaby…\" Dino's voicenbetrayed more than a little concern, he didn't want to upset her –nyet it looked like he already had. Gaby kept walking while Dino triednto decide whether to follow, \"Gaby… Stop… please…\" \"No…\" Dinonwas confused… Now what had he done… As he was thinking, Gabynpaused and he saw the glint in her eyes as she watched him over hernshoulder before slowly moving away. As he took a couple of stepsntoward her, he noticed that she moved a little quicker. \"Younlittle minx…\" Gabynroared with laughter as Dino picked up the pace and ran after her,nbut she was light on her feet and at first managed to keep thendistance between them. \"Gaby Santiago… You are in BIG trouble…\" Henheard her laughter come back to him, \"You have to catch me first…\"nDino swore to himself, Gaby was almost too quick for him and it wouldntake him a while, unless… Gabynglanced back, Dino was nowhere to be seen, chuckling to herself, shenknew he had taken up her challenge. Dropping to the floor, she triednto spot him, but knew she was on the higher ground and was at andisadvantage. Dinongrinned to himself, when Gaby had first come to New York, they hadnoften played games with each other, Dino realizing that it helpednGaby have a sense of control – as she usually set the challenge –nwhether it was a race to the hot-dog stand for a quick snack, or angame of cards in the evening in front of the TV. Asnshe had become more comfortable, the challenges stopped and so hadnthe games she liked to play – to tease him, it was her way ofninstigating a night of loving. Dino had taken the lead more and more,nglad that her fears were disappearing, but he suddenly realized thatnhe missed the games too. Slowlynhe began to inch forward on his stomach, seeing Gaby drop down, henbecame a little more careful, but she was still partly silhouetted,nmeaning that as long as he stayed low, she wouldn't notice him soneasily. As he got closer, she changed tactics, moving to the highestnground and stood, silhouetted by the full moon. Dinonswore quietly, if he tried to rush her, she would be ready for him,nand there was no cover for him to hide behind where she was. Watchingnher for a moment, he felt himself stirring inside as his eyesnfollowed the line of her body under the white dress, he almostnlaughed, Gaby knew exactly what she was doing and the effect shenwould have on him… Gaby smiled, scanning the ground in front of her,nshe also used her other senses, listening carefully for the slightestnnoise. She had noticed that Dino was wearing his favouritenaftershave – one that she had bought for him, when he got closer,nshe might just pick it out. But Dino was patient; he would move andnthen wait, before moving again, she had to get him moving morenquickly to have a chance of spotting him. An idea came to her mind… Dinonwatched, entranced as Gaby began to dance. Atnfirst Gaby kept her dance soft, basic, hoping to catch Dino's eye,nbut soon she began the classic Tango, her movements becoming morensensual. Dinoncaught his breath, damn… She was going to win… again… Not thatnhe minded, he began to move closer, as quietly as possible, stayingnlow. He still wasn't sure if she had spotted him or not, but henwanted to get as close as he could. Gabynsmiled, she still couldn't see Dino, but could hear a faintnmovement, so faint, she wasn't exactly sure where he was.nDeliberately, she turned a little to one side and began thenArgentinean moves, moves that she knew Dino could not resist, afternall, what was the use of setting yourself up as bait if you were notncaught? Dinonswallowed, when Gaby had turned, she had actually placed her back tonhim, though she hadn't realized it, smiling to himself, Dino movednto his feet though crouching low. Instead of trying to bring her downnto the ground, he wanted to hold her in the dance. Raisingnher hands above her head, Gaby jumped when Dino's hands snakednaround her waist. She had expected him to come from in front of her,nnot behind and Dino had more surprises in store. Instead of pullingnher around to face him, he left her where she was. Content to let onenarm remain around her waist, the other began to trace lazily aroundnher body. Across an arm and down her ribs, from her thigh, up overnher hips to her stomach and continuing to the shoulder. Thencaress was so light, so soft that Gaby trembled, she hesitated for anmoment when Dino's voice whispered in her ear, \"Don't stop…\" Slowlynthey began to move together, Gaby leaning back into Dino's chestnfeeling him tighten his grip around her waist, pulling her hipsncloser to his, she placed her right hand on his, felt his fingersnlift slightly to interlock with hers. Asnthey continued to dance her left hand searched for his, but it wasnstill moving lazily around her body and Gaby was enjoying Dino'sntouch, she realized she would have to find something else – he wasnobviously not interested in turning her around to face him just yet.nMoving slightly to one side, she dropped her head back to hisnshoulder, while her free hand dropped to his thigh and began toncaress it slowly. Dinonsmiled, dropping his lips to her offered neck, he kissed softly, atnthe same time tracing his fingertips lightly along the full length ofnher collar bone from right to left. Then a thought came into his mindnand he hesitated, he couldn't do this… Not yet. Gabynshivered and realized that Dino was holding back. What was wrong?nThis certainly wasn't like him at all. \"Dino,nwhat is it?\" Dinonswallowed… He had to tell her, couldn't not tell her. Turning hernaround, he saw the confused expression on her face, \"Gaby, I neednto tell you something…\" Gabyntook a deep breath, all thoughts emptying from her mind, her heartnfelt as though it was gripped in an icy hand. The look on Dino'snface, visible in the moonlight, said that she wasn't going to likenwhat she was about to hear. \"Thenlast two cases I went on… between them I was only home for justnover 24 hours…\" Dino paused, how could he tell her this withoutnmaking it look like an excuse? He decided to go with just the barenfacts… Gaby was smart enough to make up her own mind. \"Inhad left a message for you on our answer machine at home to pick menup, but you didn't show. I was so annoyed… Terry came for me,nsaid that you had left – initially I thought he meant that you hadncome here for a break – but then later he explained that younweren't coming back.\" Gabyndropped her head before speaking softly, \"I bet that made you evennmore upset.\" Dinonnodded, \"I couldn't see what the problem was. Thought you werenbeing… well anyway… I left the office and went home. I wasnhungry, but there was only basic food in the house… Nothing in thenfridge…\" \"Youndidn't think I was going to leave anything to go bad did you?\"nGaby's tone was becoming slightly frustrated. Dinonplaced a hand on her cheek to calm her down a little, \"I went tonget a drink and found only a small bottle of water… It reallynflipped me out, I was so mad with you I threw the glass against thenwall. Then I went to a bar to get something to eat and a drink.\" Gabynnarrowed her eyes, \"Which bar?\" Dinonswallowed, \"Patrick's…\" NownGaby was puzzled, \"But you said you didn't like the place, thatnyou never wanted to go there when we went out for something.\" \"Gaby,nI never wanted to take you to Patrick's, because it's one of thenplaces I used to go to forget about Cass…\" Gabyndropped her head, feeling a little guilty and spoke softly, \"Didnyou go there to forget about me too?\" Dinonnodded, his throat dry, not knowing what to say for a moment, butnGaby continued for him. \"How much did you drink Dino?\" Hensighed, \"A lot… I vaguely remember a bottle… Though it wasnprobably more… I'm sorry… I…\" Gabyninterrupted him and lifted her hand consolingly to his cheek, hernfinger tracing along the scar there. \"It's ok… I can't reallynblame you for that… If I'd been home…\" She gave him a softnkiss to re-enforce her forgiveness, but when Dino turned slightly shenglanced up, astonished to see a look of shame on Dino's face,n\"Dino…?\" \"Therenwere other reasons why I used to go to Patrick's Gaby… BeforenCass and I got together…\" Shenshook her head in disbelief, \"No… Oh god no Dino, please don'tntell me you…\" Seeing the look that crossed his face, she turnednand walked a few steps away, fighting to control her emotions. Thenfact that he had got drunk she accepted, understood, and forgave,nknowing what he had been through after losing Cass, but to turn tonsomeone else… Anhand on her shoulder made her flinch away \"Gaby… please… Itnwasn't my intention…\" Gabynspun to face him, furious at his words, \"Not your intention! JesusnDino…\" \"GabynI swear I didn't know what I was doing,\" his voice trembled withnremorse and Gaby could see that he meant what he said, but thatncouldn't take away the truth… \"WhennCass died… You went on a drinking binge that lasted two years Dino…nYou told me that yourself, but not once did you jump into bed withnsomeone else during that time… No matter how drunk you were… Orndid you lie to me about that?\" Dino shook his head… \"Inleave you for reasons I admit you didn't realize at the time and Inaccept that you may have thought I wasn't coming back, but it takesnyou less than 24 hours to find a replacement for your bed… and younexpect me to believe that you didn't know what you were doing…!\" Gaby'snvoice was hard, scathing and Dino winced at the sharpness of hernattack. She was right, there were times after Cass' death where henhadn't even known who he was, let alone where he lived. During thatntime, he had never slept with anyone, until Gaby had come along,nhelped him to live again. However,nthat wasn't going to make it any easier to complete the story. Hendropped his head not knowing how to continue. Part of him wished henhad not mentioned anything, that he had kept that day a secret, butnhe couldn't lie to Gaby, not if he really wanted her back. Gaby'snvoice, pained and bitter caught his attention. \"Inbet you bought her dinner too… and a few drinks.\" Dinonswallowed and shook his head, his voice quiet and hoarse, \"No… Inate alone, she brought the bottle of whisky…\" Gaby'sneyes narrowed, something strange must have happened here for a womannto have brought the drinks… After a moment, a thought popped intonher head, and she spoke quietly, \"You knew her… from before…\" Dinonnodded, guilt flowing across his face, \"Yes… I've known her forna while…\" Dino wished he could read Gaby's mind at the moment,nconflicting images crossing her face. One emotion was dominant…nPain… \"Thisnwasn't the first time you hooked up with her…\" Dino shook hisnhead and he could see the anger crossing Gaby's face once more,n\"How often…?\" \"Notnoften… Just a few times… A while ago…\" \"What'snher name?\" Dinonwas startled by the question it was so unexpected, then swallowedndeeply, knowing that Gaby would work out the rest for herself andnsteeled himself for her reaction, knowing that it was going to benhard. \"I don't really know…\" Gabynstared at him, silenced by his reply, confused by the answer. Dinoncould see her mind searching for a solution, felt the pain as shendrew to a conclusion. Gaby's voice was barely a whisper, \"Youndon't know..? How can you not know the name of a woman you sleptnwith… unless she's a…..\" Dinonclosed his eyes against the look on Gaby's face, waiting for hernhand to strike. He had seen it lift out of the corner of his eye andnwaited, accepting it… Knew he deserved it. However, nothingnhappened. He had expected Gaby to be angry, to take her anger out onnhim, fight him even, but there was nothing. Opening his eyes, he wasnstunned to see that Gaby had moved away slightly and was sinking tonthe ground, curling up into a ball sobbing like a baby. Itnwas something he had completely not expected and he had to admit,ndidn't know what to do about it. Taking a few steps closer, he toonsank to the ground. Fornthe second time in as many hours, Gaby was crying, but these were notntears caused by a distant memory of fear and bitterness. These werenfresh tears caused by pain and deception, her body curled up,nforehead on her knees, arms wrapped around her legs, hugging themntightly to her body, trying to sort out her feelings. Shenhad trusted Dino with everything, laid herself bare and open and henhad been there for her, as she knew he would be. Then, just as thenrift between them was sealed and the scar beginning to heal, he hadnripped her open once more with the tale of his infidelity. HernArtemis self screamed with anger, telling her to hit back, to strikenat Dino in retaliation at what he had done. To return the pain he hadncaused a hundred fold, but Gaby fought and rejected that route, afternall – she had left him at that time. She had no right to demand henremain true to her, but for him to do this so quickly after findingnout she had left… Did he really have any feelings for her at all?nShe might have fought him in the past, but she was no longer Artemis…nand only a few minutes before, she had been ready to show just hownmuch she loved him. Hernmind told her off… Of course Dino had feelings for her, otherwisenhe would not have come, tried to fix things. So why had he done thisnto her? Dinonsat on his knees, head bowed, wrestling with his conscious… Had hendone the right thing? Should he have stayed silent? Seeing Gaby asnshe was now destroyed him inside, he had opened a Pandora's Box andndidn't know how to close it. Glancingnup, he realized that Gaby's tears had changed, no longer heartnrending sobs, her tears had softened, but had not reduced in volume.nDino felt desperate, he had to do something… but would she acceptnhim now? Gaby'snmind was spinning, she had rejected anger as a solution, it wouldnsolve nothing – perhaps making the situation worse – if that werenpossible. As she cried, one thought rose to the surface and with it anquestion… The thought reminded her that no matter what hadnhappened, she loved Dino, could not throw him out of her life,nbecause to do so would be throwing away part of herself… Thenquestion was why…? Not why had he done what he did… He hadnalready answered that – saying he didn't know, and for somenpeculiar reason, she believed him. He knew she would be hurt by hisnstory; he probably even realized that she would not want him in hernlife any more, so why had he taken the risk? Why had he told her,ninstead of keeping quiet? Asnher mind tried to sort out the answers, she felt a pair of arms slidenaround her shoulders and stiffened slightly at Dino's touch. Thenthought of those arms holding someone else… She eliminated thenthought immediately seeing the darkness and despair that followed it,nbut could not relax. Dinonwrapped himself tightly around Gaby, pulling her sideways into hisnchest, her head under his chin, her ear next to his heart. He couldnfeel her tense up, but was relieved that she didn't pull away.nSatisfied that he couldn't hold her any tighter without causingnpain, he began to rock her gently, crooning softly as a parent wouldnto a child. Gaby'sntears intensified, but became silent. Unconsciously, Dino had caughtnher up in the very embrace used by her father when she was small andnwas hurt or upset by something. The memory caused some grief tonreturn, but it also helped her to calm down further. An image came tonher mind of her father and Dino together… Her father, laughing andnjoking, Dino, blushing… Herntears eased, yes, her father certainly would have approved of Dinonand their relationship had he still been alive… Dinonfelt Gaby shudder in his arms and realized that she had stoppedncrying. He stopped rocking and let his head drop, forehead touchingnhers gently. \"Gaby, I am so, so sorry, but I had to tell you… Incouldn't live with myself if I hadn't been totally honest withnyou. I couldn't lie to you…\" Gabynstirred, looked up into a pair of blue eyes, brimming with tears. Hisnvoice had been quiet, shaky but sincere and she knew he was tellingnthe truth. Without her asking, he had answered her questionncompletely and honestly… Pandora's box had been opened and allntheir pain had multiplied as a result, but one thing remained…nHope… Gabynlifted a hand, softly wiping away the tears… \"What happened to mynbig tough hero…?\" Dinongave a weak half smile, \"He got lost without his huntress… Forgotnhow to dance… Forgot how much he needs his partner…\" Antear slid down Gaby's cheek, \"The huntress is far away, but thendancer is nearby… Maybe we can bring both them and the hero backntogether…\" Dino nodded and held Gaby tightly, feeling her arms encircle him asnshe shifted position to get closer. Sighing, he slowly began tonrelax, knowing he had done the right thing, knowing that while thenincident would remain on Gaby's mind for a while – and probablynresurface from time to time - especially when she was angry, she wasnstill his, and would remain so. Gaby opened her eyes slowly, had she dozed off for a moment? Shenwasn't sure, one thing she was sure of was that she and Dino wouldnbe stronger as a couple after today, more understanding of each othernthan they had been in the past. She still felt hurt by his actions atnPatrick's and it would probably be a while before she couldncompletely let it go, but he had told her the truth and was notnhiding anything. That they would need to talk about other matters, Gaby was certain,nbut that could wait, they needed time... Time to recover, time forneach other, away from the office, away from everyone. With a shock,nshe realized that they had never been on holiday as a couple. Anynlong breaks had been taken here, with her family, and that she wouldnhave to rectify… immediately. \"What are you thinking about?\" Gaby hid a small smile, \"Who says I'm thinking…?\" Dino raised an eyebrow, \"I know that look on your face…\" Gaby chuckled softly, \"and you know me too damn well. I wasnthinking that maybe we should get away for a while… Just the two ofnus. Do you think Terry would agree to it?\" \"Even if he doesn't… I don't care, I think it's a greatnidea… Anywhere in particular?\" Gaby shook her head, giving a softnsmile, Dino grinned, \"Good, because I've got a couple of ideas…\" Gaby was intrigued, \"Tell me…\" Dino shook his head and spoke softly, \"No. Just let me make it ansurprise. Please sweetheart…\" \"Ok…\" Gaby raised her hand to Dino's cheek, noticing thensoftness in his eyes as she did so. Something in him had changed, shencouldn't quite put her finger on it, but she also realized that shenhad probably changed too. She was not surprised when Dino dropped hisnhead and gently kissed her forehead. It had always been his way ofnsaying 'I love you' for as long as she could remember, and itnalways made her feel good. Lifting her chin a little, she returned his kiss, softly letting hernlips touch his. Not expecting the thrill that ran through her body,nshe gasped slightly. Dino too was caught unprepared and tightened hisngrip around her body, feeling the shiver through her skin as shenreacted. Gaby pulled away and stood up quickly, scared by the involuntarynreaction that had passed through her skin. Dino stood behind her,nclose but not touching, giving her time to adjust to a new level ofnemotions. He knew that part of Gaby had always been locked away fromnhim – protecting herself. However, that was no longer true, Gabynwas completely open, easy to hurt, easy to love and would need to bencared for, but, would she turn to him… or would she do it fornherself. Gaby closed her eyes, willing herself to calm down. Instinct had toldnher to run and the adrenaline for a moment had flowed through hernbody, yet she had rejected it, she was no longer Artemis thenhuntress, working alone, protecting herself. She was Gabrielle andnhad a partner who would provide protection should she need it – andnanything else she asked for – within reason. She could sense Dino standing behind her, waiting to see what she wasngoing to do. Gaby sighed, her mind said that she should take thingsnslowly, carefully rebuild the relationship with Dino so there wouldnbe no mistakes… No misunderstandings… Her heart and body saidndifferent, she needed him… like the land needed the rain to live.nWithout him she was only half a person, he was day to her night. Her arms dropped from their folded position, her hands opening to hernsides, palms up. \"Dino…\" He was there immediately, hands placed gently in hers, bringing themnback to her body as he wrapped his arms around her. She shivered atnhis touch, wanting more. Ignoring her thoughts, Gaby went with herninstinct, her feelings, pulling Dino's arms more tightly aroundnher, inhaling deeply at the sensations she could feel. Dino was stunned, not only was Gaby accepting him back, but she wasndoing so completely, unconditionally. He had expected her to be warynof him… To set limits, at least for the moment, until she becamencomfortable again. Almost overcome with emotion, he dropped his headnto her shoulder and kissed softly. \"Thank you… for believing me…\" Gaby smiled, \"How could I not… You have done so much for me –nwhat kind of person would I be if I threw that all away just becausenthrough a grave misunderstanding you had one moment of weakness… Injust want to forget that it happened and get back to what's morenimportant… us…\" Dino shuddered with relief and hugged her tightly, burying his headnin her shoulder. Terry was right, Gaby was one hell of a woman…[Chapter 6] Gabynsighed and gave Dino time to recover from her words, she had felt himnshaking and held his arms tightly to stop him from letting her go,ncaressing them lightly with her fingers. Unconsciously the two ofnthem began to move in the steps of an unwritten dance, sensesnheightened due to the close contact. Dinonreleased one of her arms which dropped down, her hand returning tonthe thigh where it had rested earlier; his hand was free to travel onna voyage of re-discovery and Gaby exalted in his move. His touchnsofter and lighter that it had ever been, yet she could feel thenstrength of him through his fingertips, needed it, wanted it… Shenslowly moved her hand inwards around his thigh and heard the shortndeep breath that he took in reaction to her move. At the same timenhis hand floated across a breast, sending a thrill through her body. Herngrip tightened on his right hand and Dino moved his lips up her necknkissing just behind the ear. Gaby whimpered quietly, closing her eyesnin pleasure at his touch. Searching, her left hand found his belt,nhappy to feel that it was a plain one. She pulled a face innconcentration, but managed to undo it fairly easily, at the same timenfeeling the shiver that ran through his body. Innresponse, Dino undid a few buttons that ran down the front of herndress, sliding his hand under the fabric, now in contact with hernbare skin, he fought for control of himself. He needed Gaby to takencontrol, needed her to realize that this was about them… not her,nnot him, but them as a couple, as a partnership. Oncenagain Gaby hesitated, Dino had usually taken over by now, so why wasnhe holding back? His words from earlier that evening came back tonher… 'Can we start again?' Was that what he wanted? Tonrecapture how they had been when she had first gone to New York? Asnshe pondered, her hands unconsciously caressed the skin under hernhands, causing Dino to moan slightly. Suddenlynit came to her, yes, Dino did want to recapture the spontaneity ofntheir early relationship, but also she now had the confidence tonmatch what he had given her… To be his equal. She knew Dino lovednthe softer quieter Gaby – he had told her so, but now he was alsontelling her that he loved the Gaby that challenged him, mentally,nemotionally, physically… Reachingnup with her right hand she caught the back of his head and turnednhers to meet his lips, at the same time dropping her left hand insidenthe waistband of his jeans, feeling the tremor pass through his skin.nDino copied her move, and she quivered, making her hunger for more. Hernright hand gripped the back of his neck as her left released the zipnof his jeans and gently began to stroke him. She stiffened innpleasure as once again Dino duplicated what she was doing, his handndescending between her legs circling and stroking. She moaned softlynand released Dino's lips, before catching his right hand with hers,nindicating that she wanted a more tactile contact. Dinonsmiled and released the buttons at the top of her dress, sliding hisnhand inside her bra, caressing the nipple of her breast with hisnthumb. He groaned as her touch became firmer, slightly increasingnspeed, while her right hand worked at his jeans and shorts, pushingnthem over his hips on one side, before she switched hands to do thenother. \"Dino…\"nGaby's voice came as a gasp, her hands now pulling at him, \"Inneed you…\" Henneeded no further urging, he had been ready for her request, butnstill took his time, lifting the skirt of her dress and pushing hernpanties down. Grasping Gaby firmly with one hand, he guided himselfninside, thankful that Gaby was on slightly higher ground, itncertainly helped… Gabynleant forward a little, helping the two of them keep balance,ngrasping Dino's arm as he pushed deeply inside from behind. Shenmoaned loudly as he built up a rhythm, deep and strong, knowing itnwould send her into ecstasy in a very short time. Dinonclosed his eyes, he was so close to releasing himself after hernministrations that he gritted his teeth, hoping to hold on, while onenhand stroked Gaby in her most intimate of places causing her tonshudder violently. The move brought them to their knees, so strongnwas the reaction. Droppingnto the ground, Gaby found herself on her back, Dino holding herntightly after releasing the rest of the buttons on her dress, easingnhimself into her once more. She moaned as his lips gently kissed hernneck, her eyes closing as her inner nerves trembled. Dino withdrewnslightly and pushed again causing her to hiss sharply at the depth henachieved. Anfew more pushes and Gaby was shaking, almost crying out at thensensations she could feel, She had missed Dino so much, the look onnhis face when she did something he liked, his character and hisnhabits and yes, she missed the way he could make her feel. Shenshuddered, her breath coming short and fast, Dino knew he could catchnher within moments if he wished, but it would be too soon… toonshort… He pushed hard and deep, feeling Gaby rise underneath him innrapture, felt her hands encircle his neck, pulling him down… Thenkiss took his breath away and it took all his mental strength not tonfinish things there and then. He remained lying lightly on her body,nstill, the two of them joined, loving the feel of her around him,nloving the taste of her lips against his. For a moment they paused,nGaby smiling as she looked up into his eyes, \"Was there somethingnyou wanted…?\" Dinonchuckled softly, \"your turn…\" Rolling over, he pulled Gaby onntop of him. She smiled to herself, settling onto him gently, beforencontracting her muscles against him tightly, causing him to gasp. Itnwas her turn, and she was going to make the most of it. Changingnher position slightly, she was able to sit straighter, increasing thensensations Dino could feel. During their time together, she hadnlearnt that he liked a strong contact, whether fast or slow. Shenbegan slowly, hearing his breathing become deeper, the sigh comingnout of his mouth almost immediately. She pushed a little harder,ngratified by his response as he caught her hips, pulling her againstnhim. Dinongroaned, and Gaby pushed harder, faster – she was determined to getnhim first, do what he had done to her so often. It was time for hernto pay back all he had given… By giving herself… She drovenagainst him, feeling the shudder through his body, feeling ancorresponding shudder through her own. Dinongroaned again and gasped, trying to lift so he could turn Gaby overnhe found himself pinned to the ground, as she pressed her fingersninto two pressure points in his shoulders. \"Gaby…nPlease…\" \"Ohnno you don't Dino… You said it was my turn, don't you want tonenjoy what you've taught me?\" She tightened around him againnpushing harder, faster than before, smiling when he arched his backnunderneath her, overcome by the tremors coursing through his body. Gabynbegan to shake, Dino, no longer able to maintain control, dug hisnfingers into the earth, writhing beneath her, never had a woman donenthis to him before, given herself so completely. He had delighted inngiving pleasure – and on occasion taken it, but Gaby was the onlynperson who had the strength to dominate him as she had allowed him innthe past to dominate her. They truly were equal, at last. Ancry from Gaby's lips indicated that she had been able to pleasurenherself with the moves she had made against him. He caught her hipsntightly, closing his eyes as he felt himself lifting, consumed by thenfire that was Gaby. He erupted into her, the release almost painfulnin its ecstasy, crying out her name, relief that he had not lost hernas he had feared. Dino'snrelease triggered Gaby's reaction, shuddering, she dropped to hisnchest, her forehead touching his as she gasped for breath. Openingnher eyes, she saw Dino looking at her in wonderment and chuckled atnthe look on his face. \"Whatnis it…?\" \"DidnI really teach you how to do that?\" Gaby chuckled, \"and a lot more besides… I havena lot to thank you for, and I'm not only talking about this, butnother things too.\" She suddenly becamenserious, her voice becoming quiet, \"That's why I was so upset,nI thought you no longer wanted me, needed me… Cared for me.\" Dinonwrapped his arms around her, holding her as tightly as he could, hisnvoice full of emotion, \"Gaby, from now on please… No matter what,nplease understand that I love you, don't ever leave me again.\" Antear splashed onto his cheek as Gaby answered softly, \"I promisenDino… I promise…\"[Chapter 7] Gabynshivered, the night was getting chilly and though she was quitencomfortable leaning back against Dino's chest as they sat on thenground, wrapped up in a blanket they had found rolled on the back ofnher saddle, she also didn't want to get sick. Dino noticed, andnsighed softly, \"Cold?\" \"Startingnto get there… I guess we should go back.\" Dinondropped his head, \"I was hoping…\" he paused, \"I don'tnreally want to see anyone else at the moment Gaby, I just want to be…nus…\" They had been talking quietly for about an hour, with a fewntender kisses shared, slowly continuing to heal the hurt the othernhad been feeling. Gabyngave him a soft smile, \"Just because we have to go back, doesn'tnmean they have to see us…\" Dino gave her a quizzical look, makingnher chuckle. She jumped to her feet and held out her hand, \"Are youncoming or not?\" Acceptingnher hand, Dino followed as Gaby led the way to the horses. Soon shenwas leading him back to the hacienda, though by a different route tonthe one Eduardo had brought him on. After a short while, they came tonthe paddocks that were on the opposite side of the house and Gabynindicated that they should dismount. Tyingnher horse's rein to Bianca's saddle, she slapped the mare on thenrump, grinning at Dino's expression when he saw the two horses headntowards the people gathered around the barbecue. \"Jeez Gaby,nthey'll know we're back.\" Shenchuckled wickedly, \"No they won't, but Eduardo will get thenmessage… Now come on, quietly.\" Dinonfollowed her smiling to himself, Gaby's 'Artemis' self wasnalive and kicking, he hoped she would stick around. Stopping next tonwhere Gaby was waiting for him, he asked his question. \"Whatnmessage…?\" Gaby'snanswer was a deep kiss that took his breath away and stirred hisnblood, \"That we're together… and don't wish to be disturbed…\" \"Hownwill he…?\" Gabynchuckled, \"I tied my horse to yours… Not the other way around...\" Dinonwas bemused, \"and if we weren't together?\" Shenraised an eyebrow, \"I would have sent Bianca back alone…\" Quietlynthey made their way around the house, when Gaby stopped next to thenwall, \"Can you give me a boost?\" Dino was curious, but did as shenasked. The next moment, he jumped when an old rope touched his arm,n\"Come on up…\" Dinonsighed, he hadn't climbed a rope in years and this one didn'tnlook that strong, but at the moment he would follow Gaby anywhere…nFrom the top of the wall, he realized they were next to thenhacienda's courtyard. A short way along, he noticed Gaby loweringnherself down to the floor and followed suit. Just as they werenwalking down the corridor a voice came out of the darkness. \"So…nYou did come over the wall…\" Gaby and Dino jumped as Eduardonwalked out of the shadows, carrying two large plates of food andnsmiling, \"Jeez Gaby, you didn't need to do that… You are stillnmistress of this house, to come and go as you please, we werenteenagers the last time you did that.\" Seeingnthe look on Gaby's face he started to chuckle, \"Ah… I see…\"nGlancing at Dino, he could not stop the amusement playing around hisnmouth, \"I brought you some food, it would be a shame to miss out…nAfter your exertion, you may need the sustenance.\" PassingnDino the plates he chuckled, \"Mind you… If you hadn't wanted tonbe seen… All you had to do was use the gate… I had it fixed… Itndoesn't squeak anymore.\" Winking at Dino, he turned and left… Dinonfollowed Gaby to the suite of rooms they used at the hacienda whennthey visited, not believing what he had just heard. Putting down thenplates slowly on a small table he saw that Gaby was trying not tongiggle and knew that he'd been had… \"Younlittle…\" Gabynbegan to laugh, \"Sorry Dino, I couldn't resist… You were soninsistent that I don't change too much, I just let 'Artemis'nout to play a little… You know what I'm like… and what I like…\" Reachingnout, Dino caught hold of her wrist and pulled her close, his voicendropping, \"Oh yes… I learnt that you like your little games Gaby…na long time ago… and I've missed them.\" Seeing her eyesnglinting he smiled to himself, his Gaby was back in his arms, wherenshe belonged, \"As for what you like… Didn't you get enoughnearlier?\" Seeingnher pout a little he chuckled and dropped his lips to her shoulder,nstarting his kisses, at the same time pulling her toward the bedroom.nThey had a lot of time to catch up on… Epilogue Dinonglanced at his watch and swore violently, Gaby was going to kill himnif he was late this time. She had forgiven him before, knowing hownimportant his work was, but this time he would definitely be inntrouble if he didn't make it. Notneven the truth of a delayed flight from London would be a good enoughnexcuse – he had promised to be on time and where Gaby wasnconcerned, he was not going to break that promise, or any others henhad made to her for that matter. Glancingnat his watch again, he made his decision. Paying the cab driver whatnhe owed, he stepped out of the cab and glanced around the New Yorknstreets, orienting himself. Quickly he realized he was only twonblocks away from his destination, but the traffic was bumper tonbumper. Gettingna good hold of his bag, he quickly began moving, running along thenroad until he came to the next junction, he sighed when he saw therenwas no way through. Ignoring the enraged shouts of drivers, henclimbed onto the bonnet of a car and began jumping across from one tonanother, before sliding across the bonnet of another yellow cab tonreach the pavement. Anquick glance at his watch put his feet into motion and he flew alongnthe kerb, sometimes stepping into the road – mainly trying to staynon the pavement, though unable to due to the amount of people out andnabout that summer evening. A few minutes later and he had arrived at thenbuilding, the receptionist giving directions to the room where Gabynwould be waiting. The clock on the wall showed that he was late, onlynby a couple of minutes, but it could have been hours in his head. Damn... She's going to kill me… && Gabynglanced at the clock on the wall and sighed, Terry had called to saynthat Dino had caught the flight from London, but it had been delayed.nGiving her an arrival time in New York, he had passed on some earlyncongratulations before returning to the conference that he and Dinonhad been attending. Annamused smile played around her mouth… He had promised so faithfullynto be on time – he was probably going insane by now. How should shenreact to his arrival…? Relieved? Happy? Nonchalant? Or should shenbe angry and see how many excuses and ways of apologizing he wouldncome up with? Chucklingnto herself, she decided to go with mild annoyance… Enough to getnhim a little wound up – but not upset – after all it wasn't hisnfault that the plane was delayed and Dino's apologies were alwaysnworth getting… Ancommotion at the door made her turn and raise her eyebrows and shenstarted to chuckle, all thoughts of teasing him gone from her mind.nHis hair was all over the place sticking out at odd angles, makingnhim look like he'd slept in a haystack. His tie was loose and topnbutton undone and from the pinkness on his face and slightnbreathlessness, she guessed he'd been running. Givingnhim a soft smile she teased slightly, \"So… You aren't going tonlet me down after all…\" Dinongrinned back, \"I thought for a minute you'd go without me…\"nPulling her close, he kissed her gently, \"Ready?\" && Gabynopened her eyes slowly and smiled to see Dino watching her closely, anrelieved look on his face. \"Hey… You ok?\" Dinonchuckled, \"I thought I was the one supposed to ask that question,\"nleaning forward, he kissed her forehead tenderly, \"Thank you…\" \"Fornwhat?\" Dinonchuckled, \"For everything…\" Pausing, he sat up a littlenstraighter, \"Do you want to see?\" Gabynrolled her eyes at him, \"What do you think…?\" Takingna few steps away, Dino returned and placed the small bundle in hernlap before returning with the second, his face soft and full ofnemotion. Sitting next to her, his voice gave away his relief. \"Anlittle smaller as we were anticipating, but the doc was right to makenthe call and get you in early. Your blood pressure spiked againnduring the operation.\" Gabynhad discovered she was pregnant a few weeks after she and Dino hadnreturned to New York from their holiday on the Solomon Islands. Dinonhad booked the holiday after having a quick chat with Terry fromnGaby's Buenos Aires apartment, where they had gone the day afternthe Barbeque, Eduardo and Consuella understanding their need to benalone. Thentwo of them had then spent a couple of weeks on a small island, thenonly inhabitants of a small but well appointed Pacific style house.nThe first week they had lazed around, doing nothing but enjoying eachnothers company, talking about everything and nothing. Gaby filling inndetails of her childhood and telling Dino stories of her father, Dinontelling Gaby more details about his life with the Delta Force andnwhat had happened later. At one point he had almost come to tearsnafter describing how he had lost one of his best friends on annoperation. Gabynhad wrapped herself around him, encouraging him to talk, holding himntightly and Dino had responded. It had taken all Gaby's innernstrength to stay quiet and be strong for him, and afterwards he hadnthanked her for it – informing her that he had never talked aboutnthe incident to anyone else. Gaby had sighed, eased his pain with anfew quiet words, and both had remained silent for quite a whilencontent to simply be together. Thenonly thing Dino had been unable to talk about was Cass' death, butnGaby didn't push, knowing that it would be a while before he wouldntalk about it. Not because he didn't trust her, but because thenmemory was still too painful to be revisited. She knew that one daynDino would talk, and she would be there for him, always. Thensecond week they had been a little more adventurous, scuba diving andnwaterskiiing around the islands, but Gaby's favourite part was atnthe end of their holiday when they had rented a yacht for a few daysnand they were once again alone. Onntheir return home, she had at first been afraid to tell Dino that shenwas expecting after what he had been through with Cass, but a day ornso later, he had gently cornered her in the bedroom, noticing thatnshe was hiding something. Shenhad told him carefully, a little anxious about his response, but shenneedn't have worried judging by the hug he gave her afterwards andnthe way he had insisted on taking care of her when complications hadnbegun to set in. Shenstared down at the red-head in her arms and looked at the other innDino's and gave a soft chuckle, \"I should have warned you thatnwe'd have twins… You know we won't get a lot of sleep…\" Dinonsmiled, \"Won't be the first time I've been kept up all night…nThough this is a much better reason than any other.\" Asnhe spoke both babies stirred and opened their eyes, Dino smiled, \"Heynguys, meet your mom… She's kinda special you know…\" Givingnher a sideways look he continued, \"Mom… meet James Gabriel andnAlessia Grace Bernadino…\" Gaby'snhead snapped around to look at Dino, her eyes locking with his, tearsnsliding down her face. They had discussed several names and had evennagreed to think about using old family names for their children,nthough Dino had not seemed keen on the idea. For him to use hernfather's name and a diminutive of her mother's… Reachingnout her free hand, she placed it gently on Dino's cheek, unable tonsay anything for a moment, \"Thank you… for remembering them…\" Dinongently kissed the palm of her hand and smiled, \"The more I thoughtnabout it, the more I liked the idea – so I combined both ournparents' names… James and Grace were my parents' middle names –nI just played around a little…\" Gaby blinked away the tears in her eyes, \"I think it's a greatnidea… Perfect in fact…\" Looking at her son, she gave Dino anhard look, \"Just don't try and persuade him to follow in yournfootsteps ok…\" Dinonchuckled and lifted Alessia closer to her mother, \"As long as youndon't teach this one how to use a bow…\" Gabynsighed with relief, \"Deal…\" Looking at him more closely, shennoted the glint that had come into his eye, and wondered what he wasnthinking… Dinonsaw the curiosity that crossed her face and had to restrain himselfnfrom chuckling, he had one more surprise for Gaby, but it could waitna little longer… For now he wanted to enjoy his family… ","Summary":" Welcome to my third Dino story, carrying on a little after we left off last time... For those of yo"},{"Movie":"Becoming Jane","Title":"My Irishman","Author":"paperbackwriter9","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4677635","Passage":"[Chapter 1] First of all, thanknyou for clicking on my story. Okay, next… I have never read anBecoming Jane fan-fic on fan fiction before, but I decided to writenone! The beginning scenenin my chapter is taken from the movie, and therefore I do not own anynof the lines. The plot isncompletely from my own creation, and what could have been anothernending for the movie. I realize that it does not follow Jane Austen'sntrue life, but that is the point of writing a fan-fic, it's how younwant it to be. DISCLAIMER: Thenmaterial that I own consists of the plot only, the movie and actorsnand some quotes are from the movie, not mine! -- Clink. Tom sat the glass downnin front of me. A small amount of light came through the window andnsoftened the darkness in the slightly noisy room. Tom smiled softlynat me and his face only held happiness, as I was his wife-to-be. Indid not wear the same facial expression. \"How many brothers andnsisters do you have in Limerick, Tom?\" His expression wasnpuzzled by the slightly odd question, but answered simply, \"Enough.nWhy?\" I went on, \"What arenthe names of your brothers and sisters?\" \"They…\" Tomnsuddenly stopped when he saw me pull his mothers letter out slowlynfrom my pocket. \"And on whom do theyndepend?\" I asked quietly and he shifted in his seat. Tom sighed andnstared straight into my eyes. \"Your reputation is destroyed.\" Hisnpowerful stare was making me change my decision, so I stared down atnthe table. \"Your profligacy is a pitiful shame.\" I stared down atnhis mother's letter in my hand with a growing hatred. Tomnquestioned me with his eyes, and I didn't need to look at him tonsee it. \"I can earn money,\"nhe said with as much strength as he could muster. \"It will not benenough,\" I said and shook my head. \"I will rise,\" henanswered back in his persuasive tone. \"With a High CourtnJudge as your enemy? And a penniless wife? God knows how many mouthsndepending on you? My sweet, sweet friend, you will sink, and we willnall sink with you,\" I felt the tears slowly prick my eyes. \"I will…\" Tomnstarted but was interrupted by the coachman announcing that ancarriage was making its way back to Hampshire, my home county. Tom looked at thencoachman, as I sadly reached for my hat. \"No! No, Jane.\" Tom saidndesperately and grabbed my hand, and pulled it away from my hat. \"Inwill never give you up.\" He stared at me with hope in his blueneyes. \"Tom…\" \"Don't speak ornthink,\" he said quickly. \"Just love me. Do you love me?\" Thenquestion hung in the air, and he didn't move a friction of an inch. \"Yes,\" I mutterednand Tom broke out into a smile, \"But it will not be enough…nGoodbye Mr. Lefroy.\" I pulled my hand out of his easily and I feltnthe pain as I simply walked out the door and headed to the carriagenheaded for home. I felt like I was being ripped apart, and upset thatnhe was not coming after me. Painfully I made my wayninside the carriage heading for Hampshire, and looked out the smallnwindow in the back. I saw Tom walking closely behind, but as thencarriage picked up speed, his lovely face disappeared in thendistance. -- I scratched out mynwriting again and again. Five yearsnpassed and not even a single letter was sent… What was thenreason for his horrible visiting skills? The reason was that he hadngone mad and had forgotten all about his wonderful lady waiting fornhim in Hampshire – \"Jane, get a hold ofnyourself, it's been five years,\" I repeated to myself out loudnand I heard someone clear their throat from behind me. \"Jane? Are younalright?\" I turned to facenCassandra, or Cassie, my sister. She was the only good soul in thisnhorrible world of mine. Yes, she alone saved me from my utter despairnand depression during these miserable five years. \"Jane, are younalright? Do you think you are in need of some fresh air?\" Shensmiled sweetly at me and patiently waited for my reply. \"No Cassie, I'mnquite alright.\" Cassandra raised an eyebrow and I knew that shenknew I was lying. \"A walk actually sounds like a good idea,\" Inadmitted truthfully. I briefly thought about the fact that I wasnbeyond tired, but I craved fresh air like I craved seeing Tom Lefroynagain. \"Do you need me to gonwith you?\" She asked but she already knew the answer. I always toldnher no when she asked to keep me company when I took a walk throughnthe forest. Being alone helped me imagine Tom better. No matter whatnI did to distract me, my mind could not be away from the memories fornto long. \"I'll meet up withnyou later, Cassie,\" I said and lightly touched her arm. I couldnfeel her eyes on my back as I left the small parlor room. Once I wasnoutside, I filled my lungs with the clean air. As I headed to thenpath in the forest nearby, I started to day dream away. All those years ago… At first I did not feelnthe impact of Tom and I going our separate ways. The only feeling Infelt was the pride in making the right choice. But that did not lastnlong and I quickly fell into a depression after the first week backnhome. I longed to hear himncall my name or even make a joke at my expense. But that would nevernhappen, I told myself, for he had married another woman after ourn'runaway marriage' went bad. In fact, he was supposed to marry andifferent woman after his uncle found out about that horrid letter.nThat part of my life I did not wish to dwell on. On a good note, I savednmy family the humiliation of having a daughter who was eloped.nEveryone else's life benefited from mine in that way. True, I hadnthe time and the money to write my books, but it was not enough. Writing had alwaysndistracted me, but when I began to write, I pictured the story Inwould never have. The hero saving the helpless girl was not in mynfuture, only in my stories. I was incapable of even telling Cassienhow I felt, but I let her tell me her feelings. I mourned with her,nbecause her fiancé had died on an expedition, leaving my sister justnas lonely as I was. The twisted humor was that she lost her husbandnto be the same year of my tragic romance. We took this pain andnlearned to live with it in different ways. Cassie was much better atnit than me, and I was always being reminded of that. \"You shall marry myndear, do not fret,\" as my mother said and I rolled my eyes. Whonwould want to marry a girl who had almost made the choice of annelopement? My thoughts were interrupted at the sound of birds flyingnoverhead. I was exhausted and thankful I had reached the forest. Incrawled up next to the base of a very large tree, hugged my knees andncried. Even though I knew Inhad a full life ahead of me, I could not forget. After all, I wasnjust twenty-five years old. Writing was in my future and forgettingnwas a skill I needed to learn. Still, I knew I would never love a mannthe same way. I might even grow old and never find a husband. That small littlenthought made my tears run down my pale face. My worn out body andnoverly stressed mind had finally had enough. I became weak as I triednto stand, and fell to the ground. Only moments later Inwas falling into a black abyss. -- \"JANE!\" \"Jane where are you?\" \"Oh my goodness!\" I heard the noisesnbefore I could see them. It sounded like my brother and sister'snvoice, and my mothers as well. Where was I? Why couldnI not see anything? I couldn't get up tonlook around, but all I knew was that it was pitch black, and I wasnfreezing. I was frozen with fear and could not call out to get theirnattention. There I realized another thing, I was soaking wet. I must be outside…innthe forest…where I had fallen asleep or fainted. I guess I was innsuch a deep sleep, I could not feel the light rain. My heart suddenlynraced when I sensed another person near me. Since I was practicallynmute, I just moaned out. \"Jane!\" I heardnHenry yell, my favorite brother in the whole world. Actually he wasnmy favorite brother out of all six brothers. But what was Henry doingnhere? Shouldn't he be at his home with his wife, my cousin, Eliza?n\"Jane speak to me, please.\" He answered now, squatting downnbeside me. \"What is going on?\"nI asked weakly and he picked me up and yelled out, \"She's fine!\"nI wondered whoever else was out looking for me. He talked as wenwalked to the house. \"We would like tonknow,\" he said softly, \"what were you doing out here during thisnrainy night?\" My eyes were slowly adjusting to the light and Incould see that he really was worried. His blond hair was a mess, andnthe bottoms of his pants were caked with mud. \"Eliza and I came forna visit, but we had our own surprise when we got here, thank you fornthat Jane.\" He joked but I couldn't laugh, for I was starting tonshake. \"Jane? What is it? Jane?\" He struggled to walk at a fasternpace to reach the house. -- As we got closer to mynhome, I saw Cassie my mother, my father, and then I saw Eliza closenbehind. \"Jane, where did you-\" My mother was cut off by Henry asnwe got inside. \"Jane! Thank God!\"nI heard Cassie say and Eliza said something very similar. My fathernsmiled and my mother was a wreck, she was always having panicnattacks. I was still trying tonunderstand this situation. Did I faint or fall asleep? For how long? Panic spread through menand I cried out as if in a horrible pain. The look on their facesncould only be described as deathly afraid. They rushed me up to mynparent's bedroom and my mother changed me. It was not that I was innpain during this moment, but the disturbing thought that I had madenmyself so vulnerable in the forest frightened me. When I was safe undernthe warm comforter, my brother was allowed in. Instead of sayingnanything he stared at me, so I turned to my other side and waited fornhim to leave. \"It was because of him wasn't it?\" I pretended tonsnore and he sighed rather loudly. \"That is most unhealthy Jane,\"nand then his footsteps where heard in the hallway and then makingntheir way down the stairs. I heard my brothernbriefly explaining something to the rest of my family, but I tuned itnout and fell asleep. -- The coughing woke me upnand I struggled to breathe. My fear rose as I shook harder, and mynbody was forcing me to lose my meal from lunch. \"Jane!\" Cassie'snvoice was heard loudly and rang in my ears. I felt a hand on my backnand she looked at me. \"What is wrong…?\" It wasn't a questionnto be answered; it was a question that was unknown to me as well. Cassie yelled for mynmother and father, and they all agreed that I must see a doctor atnonce. -- \"Jane, you'll getnbetter,\" the doctor said and smiled. Only a half an hour before mynfather had asked Henry to fetch a doctor. During the waiting, I saidnhello to Eliza, my brother's wife. \"I've missed youncousin,\" she told me while looking as pretty as ever. \"How havenyou been?\" She asked but I did not need to answer that. Anyone innmy family could see I was a wreck since Tom Lefroy, with little hopenfor a recovery. I mumbled and shenquickly started a conversation with Cassie. Meanwhile my mothernfretted and paced nervously, and checked on me every five minutes. Inwas grateful for attention, but by now I wanted to be left alone. My sides and head achednalong with every bone in my body. This only seemed fair to me in anway, that I was destined for a horrible ending. -- Throughout the next daynI slept, read, chatted quietly with my family members, and ate smallnamounts of food. I was scared; we were all scared, I had never beennthis sick before. In fact, no one in my family had ever been thisnsick before. I couldn't sit ornstand, otherwise I would feel dizzy or unable to hold down food. Atnnight I needed several blankets and wool socks for my feet. But with all this extrantime I decided that I had somehow known I would never lead a normalnlife after what had happened with Tom. My life was somewhat thrownninto an endless pit of chaos that I could not escape from. Because this illnessnhad weakened me, I could not write very well. So I used my mind toncreate and store my ideas for future novels. I hoped one day, I couldnactually put these novels down onto paper and then I could reallynstart with the rest of my future. So there I lay, in mynparents' room, staring at the ceiling and wishing that I wasn'tncursed. Being an invalid wasnvery, very troubling for me, for two main reasons. The first reasonnbeing I could no longer take long walks in the forest, or attendndinners and parties. Except taking a long walk in the forest didn'tnsound as refreshing as it had once been. The second reason was anlittle much for me. I thought that having so much free time would bena gift for me because that meant I could write all day long. But withnall of this extra free time, I could think about things….and thatnmeant everything. Tom was the only mannthat troubled me to no end. Was there such a cure out in the world toncure me of my horrible feelings of being alone? It was true; I didnturn him away…but for a good reason, so he could support hisnfamily, and have a respectable reputation. There were too manynwhat 'ifs,' and I refused to lose my somewhat sane mind tonquestioning and doubting my choice from all those years ago. So instead of upsettingnmyself with all of these stressful thoughts, I just closed my eyesnand slept. Two much had happened in the last two days, and sleepnwould clear my head. -- Meanwhile…downstairs… \"It would do her anworld of good!\" Henry slammed his fist on the dining room table. \"Shhh, Henry, younshall wake her,\" Eliza told her husband. Mr. and Mrs. Austen didnnot argue with their son, but questioned what good it would really donfor Jane. \"Please,\" Cassandra murmured, \"we must give her anmemory.\" The words she spoke were painfully true if the doctor wasncorrect. \"I shall think,\"nMr. Austen said, his first words since the day before. \"We mustnmake the choice hoping for a good outcome. If we are wrong, it couldnsend her into a depression so great, that she shall never recover.\" No one dared to make ansound, it was dead silent. -- Okay, I hoped thenvery beginning made sense, as it came straight from the movie! Pleasenreview! I understand therenseemed to be a lot of detail in this chapter, but I need to recapnwhat happened in the movie so the rest of the story would flow well.nBut I like it so far and I shall update soon! What's thendecision that Jane's father must make? Wait for the next chapter tonsee! ~paperbackwriter9[Chapter 2] Thank you fornreviewing! Here is chapter twon=) Disclaimer: I donnot own Becoming Jane or its characters and some lines from thenmovie. And please remember,nthis is fan-fiction…not true to Jane's or Tom's real life. ******* (The firstnPOV is not Toms! It's not anyone's really. After the break it'snTom's POV) ******* Paperbackwriter9~ -- The well built boxerneyed the blue eyed man in front of him. This would be anneffortless fight , he thought and chuckled. There was no way thenman in front of him could call himself a fighter, not in his tavern. Bam! He felt the blow of thenman's fist in his stomach, and fell over onto the floor. \"Comennow, surely you have more in you. One blow could not have weakenednyou sir,\" the gentlemen spoke and pushed up his sleeves. \"Bloody fool,\" thenboxer said and spit on the ground. He threw his own punch, and wasnpunched back in his abdomen. The boxer had under estimated thengentleman, and was too tired from pervious fights to stand again. \"I thank you sir,\"nthe gentleman offered his hand and the group of onlookers laughed.nShame crept up on the boxer and he quickly left the circle andnreturned to the bar. -- \"Well that was a goodnfight sir!\" A woman put her hand on my back and smiled. The smellnof alcohol was strong and I smiled at my admirers. What would my dearnold uncle say if he could see me now? Nephew, you will never benthe gentleman I wanted. Or maybe, how dare you disgrace me? That did not matter tonme, for my uncle had died not yet a year ago. I hated the man, nonmatter how much I had depended on him for a living. Even when I madenmy own way, I still was regularly put down during his lectures. He constantly remindednme of obtaining a wife, and not a day did go by without his speeches.nThe thought of another woman was- but none of that mattered to me.nSince I'd been separated from my Jane, I tried to think of no womannin such a way. I did wonder, was she happy? Had she remarried? I didnnot linger over the subject, for it was a memory I hated. I slowly returned tonthe commotion around me and I felt lips against my neck. Quickly, Inmoved away from the drunken prostitute and took my leave. No matter how much Inwanted the company of a woman, I did not give in to any temptations.nJane's face would appear in my mind when I started to kiss one ofnthem back, and it would always stop there. When I was closer tondoor, I realized my coat was gone. Where had I put it? Cursing, Inwent back into the badly lit and rowdy bar to retrieve it. Where hadnit gone? I could not even remember what the time was when I enterednthe bar. Oh well, I could just leave. I needed to buy a new coatnanyway, and some lucky man probably already stole it. \"Tom! My favoritenmister is here.\" I turned to see Margaret. \"How are you sir?\" nShe wrapped her arm around my waist and I smiled. She was like manynwomen around here, she was a scarlet woman. \"Actually I was justnleaving, I'm sorry-\" \"Don't worry sir;nI'll get ya a drink on the house!\" She smiled and winked at menand walked merrily away. I desperately wanted to leave but I couldnnot. She was back very soonnand handed me a mug. \"So, what was it you wanted to leave so earlynfor?\" Margaret leaned in close and her cleavage was exposed. Inswallowed and question myself, why was I so nervous? \"Come now Tom,nI have not talked to ya in ages, I did miss you. What is it? Notnenjoy' the tavern anymore? Are the women to ugly for your taste?nBut that's right, you don't come here for women, just fornboxin,'\" she laughed and I forced a smile on my face. Shaking my head, Inslowly undid her hold on my waist. \"I won in the boxing fightntonight.\" \"Ah! What a shame Inmissed it. You're to good a boxer for any of 'em here! Who was itnyou beat?\" \"The English fellow,nthe one with a scar across his face.\" I began to relax again andnfell into easy conversation with her. \"He's a mighty goodnboxer, but what's this now! You defeated him even with all his famenand bragging. Yes, it was a shame I had not come sooner.\" \"Sooner? What keptnyou?\" I asked trying to make conversation, but she blushed a deepnred and I stiffened. The comfortable feeling was lost, and she leanedncloser to my ear. \"My dear Tom, whennwill ya finally require my service?\" Margaret whispered into my earnand I backed away. Jane's face flashed into my mind and I becamenrigid. \"No Margaret, like Inhad said before, I do not need anyone's service.\" \"Right,\" she saidnand disappeared into the crowd, after another man probably. I wasnstill shocked at myself. I wanted to forget Jane as soon as I could,nyet she would always appear when I had a decision regarding anothernwoman. Almost running, I leftnthe bar and walked down the street at a very fast pace. How was itnthat I still remembered the dark haired beauty with a time period ofnfive years? My love must have been strong, and the desire was just asnstrong as ever. Jane… The cold wind blew atnmy face, and it was colder still without my coat. Now I wished I hadnfound it, but trudged along. Winter was soon upon London, and thatnmeant my birthday was soon as well. Another year would pass, whichnmeant another year without Jane, and another year without love. Anger poured through menas I thought about how I was alone. I was upset with myself. For mynuncle was dead and I was unmarried, so why could I not go back andnsee her in Hampshire? The real reason was quite obvious, but I didnnot want to believe it. Truthfully, I wasnafraid that she had found another man. And I was afraid that she hadnforgotten me. I would look quite dim-witted to her, for I had notnforgotten her even with the passing years. My apartment was soonnto be seen, and I was thankful for I was starting to freeze. Why hadnI sent my driver away? Why did I even bother going to that bar in thenfirst place? To forget? I did not even drink when I was there, or usenit's…services. Pathetic was the wordnyou could describe me as. I had no woman, no hope, no love for myncareer, no family near by, no desire to even want a prostitute, nondesire to drink and now, no coat. -- Thanks for reading!nPlease review! Yes it was quitenshort, but I don't have much time during the week, and I wanted tonpost something. I think I will benswitching off between Jane and Tom's P.O.V.; it makes it much moreninteresting for me to write! Yes there was anreason I changed it to M, not just having to do with this chapter butnfuture chapters as well. I'll update againnsoon! XD --[Chapter 3] Okay, here is chapter three! Sorry for the mistake on chapter two, but I didn't change it to M and I am not going to. Disclaimer: I don't own Becoming Jane! Henrys P.O.V The idea of a carriage became absurd to me as I was thrown all about. The bumps and turns were starting to affect my stomach. Eliza would laugh at me, but I wasn't feeling quite like myself. I wondered what Eliza was doing back at my parent's home. Hopefully she was sitting with Jane, and helping my sister, Cassie, out around the house. My wishes were the only thing I could depend on now, as the carriage rolled on toward London. \"Sir, sir!\" I sat up and rubbed my eyes. \"Are we there?\" Embarrassment came to me when the man waited for me to gain my senses back. \"Yes sir, we are in front of the house.\" I was thankful that I was back at the apartment; I missed home when I was back at my parents. But if only my Eliza was here with me as well, then this trip would be much easier. I got out of the carriage and tipped the driver. I grabbed my bag and headed to my room. My wife and I lived in a good sized apartment, which was big enough for the both of us. It was very exciting to be able to go out and about in London, and I felt excited now. The servant we had opened the door and smiled. \"It's good to see you again sir, I have the bills.\" He handed me mail, and I shuffled through it. \"Not now,\" I told him and he took them away. Instead I went to lay on the couch and closed my eyes. My body was so sore from the ride, and I couldn't quite become comfortable. The sky was darkening and the busy city of London continued on with the remaining light. \"Well, as long as I'm here, I might as well go out,\" I said out loud. Taking my hat and over coat, I left the apartments and onto the streets of London. The air was not as clean as in the country, but that was the price to pay. The sounds of the carriages and the people chatting as they walked made me feel the excitement and the reason of why I lived here. \"Sir,\" the people nodded their heads and tipped their hats. I nodded back and kept walking, but I wasn't sure where to exactly. \"Owww!\" A woman suddenly screamed up ahead and I rushed to find out what had happened. Out of the corner of my eye, a man was quickly walking past the women while everyone else was gathering around her. \"He... he pushed me down!\" She cried and people searched for some kind of villain in black. I kept my eyes on the man walking down the street, with a familiar stride. It couldn't be... I pushed past the people and they yelled watch out to me and pretty soon I was past them. \"Stop! You in the green coat!\" Instead he started to walk faster and I ran to catch up with him. \"Leave me be!\" He yelled and I almost was at his heels. Same hair, same profile...it must be him...I had to try... \"It's Henry Austen!\" He stopped in his tracks and stood stiff, looking forward. Was this really possible? Could my search for Tom Lefroy only take one quick day? I had not excepted this, but was thankful my wish and been answered. I stared at the dark sky and thanked some good luck force that was working in my favor. \"Henry?\" He slowly said and turned, and I was right, it was Tom Lefroy. \"I can not believe this, what are you doing here?\" I walked closer to him and I shook his hand. The light from the lamps threw shadows onto his face, and I was taken by surprise at how different he looked. His hair was much longer, and he had not shaved for at least three days, his eyes had a funny look, and in truth, he looked horrible. \"How goes it Tom? How are you after all these years? Still living in London as a lawyer?\" \"Yes, sadly,\" he laughed and took a step back. \"I can't believe your here, standing in front of me. Why I haven't seen you since, that day.\" Tom said and his grin slowly faded. Yes, that horrible day when his uncle had forbid Tom to wed my sister. Well, that was the past and this was the present. \"Are you going to answer my question? Do you still live here?\" \"Yes, I do still live quite close to here, but I am in no shape for a visitor at this time,\" he smiled and I smiled back with relief, for after all, I was very lucky to find him in this large city. \"Why? Is it that scummy of a place?\" I laughed, trying to bring some humor into this odd situation. \"No it is in good shape, unlike me,\" his face twisted up into a bizarre expression. \"Do you have any money?\" I wanted to talk about Jane, but I needed to ask the right question. And I needed to find out if he had married. \"No, I inherited enough when my uncle died. But the apartment seems very empty with only me and the servant.\" Well, that just answered my question, he was unmarried. \"Your uncle died? I'm sorry, but how long ago?\" The idea came to me, why had he not come for Jane if his uncle had died. \"He died about three years ago, and it is quite alright, I do much better without him I think.\" But from my point of view, he was doing worse. His face showed age and he was only twenty-five, and his voice just did not have the same sound to it. So I had found my answers but something was off. What had he been doing with all the time, I thought he loved my sister. \"So, any women here that could catch my eye?\" I said and I pretended to smile, for I would do anything that would make him talk without having to ask questions. \"I thought you were married Henry,\" he smiled and I frowned, since when was my marriage a talk of the town? \"What is it that you want to know?\" Here goes nothing I thought, \"What ever happened to your love for Jane?\" His at ease expression changed when I caught him off guard. \"Why did you not come for her when your uncle had passed?\" The silence grew between us, and I waited for his answer. \"I- though- I mean, I thought she might have remarried,\" he said and looked at the ground, \"if I went to find out I would be even more devastated and I would become humiliated.\" Tom shifted back and forth and I stood there staring. \"Jane might die soon Tom,\" I said softly with dread and he had stopped the shifting. \"What was that Henry?\" \"Do you still love her?\" Please let him love her, I wished, and then my plan might work. \"I admit I still love her... she might... die? How come?\" His impatient eyes told the truth, that he did still love her even after five years. How could I say this? \"She, she um, I found her in the forest and she almost caught her death it was so cold… We are wishing for the best, but the doctor is not sure she will make it through. Tom please, come back to Hampshire with me and let her see you. Let her be happy before the time will come.\" I begged him, thinking of my poor, young sister lying in her bed, crying for Tom. \"I do not know if I could, it would be most heart breaking when she... doesn't make it.\" But I knew that he meant something else, he was scared, why I was not quite sure. \"This is a chance to see her and tell her you're still unmarried. To never feel regret because Jane will know that you loved her as she loved you, no matter the time period you were apart. Please Tom, it is only meant for the best.\" I could see my words making sense to him and he smiled. \"Henry, when do we leave?\" \"Tomorrow if possible, I miss my Eliza already.\" \"I shall prepare tonight. Thank you Henry.\" I nodded and was thankful he was coming, though it seemed unreal. \"I'm sorry to have interrupted your plans for the night Tom, where were you headed to?\" He laughed and nodded his head no. \"My plans were to go down to a bar to box. So you have not interrupted my plans at all. In fact, you saved me from destroying myself further.\" Whatever that meant made me worry, but I could do nothing at the moment. We said goodbye, and until tomorrow and I watched Tom take off and walk into the direction of his apartment. Whether this was the right thing to do, was still going to come, or haunt for the rest of my life. The scene of my sister happy again, to actually see her smile after these five years, would be well worth it. So I quickly headed back to my rooms to get ready. Then I remembered I had never needed to unpack. The next updating should be much faster because very soon I will have time to write again xD Thank you for reading! Review! ~Paperbackwriter9[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: I do not own this movie or the characters! The plot is mine though... Okay so Cassandra might seem a little out of character, but think about it, she wants her sister to be happy, and it's five years later after the movie takes place. Jane's POV My stomach churned and bile rose in my throat. \"Mama!\" I weakly called out as best I could but it was not loud enough. I pushed myself up and felt the lightheadedness make my head spin, but I no longer felt my stomach lurch. My body felt feeble but I made it back to the bed, sweaty and in pain. Was I to perish away and off this earth for ill health? I thought it would be from heartache and sadness, something more along the lines of what I read in books. My arms trembled from the weight of my body which suddenly felt heavier then it really was. As I lay down on my bed again, I closed my eyes and felt a tear slide down my face. Cassandra's POV \"Mama! Papa!\" I shouted and searched around the back of our residence. \"They are in front, speaking to Lady Gresham,\" one of our maids said, and I picked up my skirt and ran to the front of our home. Only minutes ago I had received a letter from Henry, and my heart had not stopped racing. Finally my mother and father came into view, having a chat with Lady Gresham. The lady was dressed in dark blue and was alone, which was just as good. For that meant long appointment with her nephew, Mr. Wisley. \"Ah! Here is my daughter now. Cassie? Come and pay Lady Gresham your respects,\" my father said and I curtsied. Our cousin Eliza was with them as well, and I sighed. The news I had felt best to be told without the watchful eyes of the great lady. \"Lady Gresham,\" I said and looked up at her face. She held a gloomy yet peaceful expression, which meant this chat had no time limit to it. \"Cassandra, you are quite a beauty,\" she said and tilted her head towards my mother. \"Her health has returned since the ill-fated tragedy of her husband to be?\" My mother nodded and Eliza grabbed and squeezed my hand lightly. Lady Gresham was one of my least favorite people. \"I do feel quite recovered,\" I said as best as I could without my voice showing my emotions. She made a calm, \"hmmm,\" and smiled at me largely. \"You know Cassandra, my nephew would like-\" \"Madame, I'm afraid we are going to seem very straight forward, but Cassandra and I have a very important engagement to attend to and we need to be getting ready. Excuse us,\" She smiled and pulled me along. Was Lady Gresham suggesting... No, she could not be seriously thinking that her son and I.... I banished the thoughts and silently thanked Eliza. \"Eliza, you saved me from that woman,\" I hugged her. \"Do not fuss my cousin, because you see I excused myself in a way that I may become the next talk of the town.\" \"Yes, I can hear it now. Lady Gresham is rudely humiliated by two immature girls, seeking safety from her never ending actions of marrying off her troubled nephew.\" We laughed and smiled before Eliza became serious. Now what was it that you bounded out to the front of the house to say? Nothing serious I hope?\" I whipped out the letter and held it out for her to read. \"It was sent only yesterday but Henry had a messenger ride here before him.\" Her eyes bulged out as I had expected them to and I smiled widely as well. \"Cassie! Tom... Monsieur Lefroy is coming here with my Henry, to see our Jane!\" My heart beat faster at the thought of excitement, which had been missing from this house since the 'ghost' of Jane had settled here those five years ago. \"Oh my Lord!\" Mama said and she sat down on the nearest chair and steadied herself. My father looked at my mother and then at me. I knew he was going to address the issue, but we all waited and sat there stiff and rigid. \"What has Henry done? Upsetting the harmony that this house is currently in?\" \"Harmony? Peace? Papa, Jane is upstairs, very ill, and you call that peace?\" I knew I had gone too far, and I didn't mean to shout. But this was my sister, his daughter, and I had wanted her to be cheerful for so long. How could my father be so blind to what was happening in his own household? \"Cassie,\" my mother whispered and looked sternly at me. Eliza sighed and rubbed her forehead. \"Well Cassandra,\" my father said, \"we seem to have no choice but to accept the fact that a young Tom Lefroy shall be arriving at our household, and Jane is sick in bed.\" Jane's POV The black figure walked slowly toward me. \"Jane, why did you leave?\" I didn't understand what was going on; except that I knew I could not, and should not let the black figure slip away from me. \"We could have worked it out,\" and voice said and I felt my chest tighten. Breathing became harder and I felt perspiration on my brow. My stomach leaped and my hands shook. My eyes opened. \"Just a … dream...\" I whispered trying to tell myself that was what it was, a dream. As I recovered I realize I had been wheezing and there was sweat on my forehead. \"Tom...\" I cried out into the darkness and sighed. Only hours before, Eliza had come to me smiling, and told me Henry was coming back home. I hoped whatever business he had, he had solved it, for I missed Henry and his good sense of wit. Thinking only made me feel worse, so I closed my eyes and let sleep take me away into a happier place. The warm sun woke me and I saw Cassie sitting in a chair, reading. \"Cass-\" \"Do not strain yourself Jane,\" she said with a wide smile. What was I missing? \"Eat please,\" and she rose and gave me a glass of water and a piece of plain toast. It was dry and bland and I forced myself to drink the water and keep it down. \"You look better Jane,\" she said and took my temperature with the back of her hand. I had no idea what had got into her but I smiled softly. There was a sudden loud knock on the front door and Cassie quickly jumped from my side. \"I shall be back Jane, one moment,\" and then she disappeared. What was that all about? I could only guess that she was extremely happy to see Henry, but that did not make any sense. This was completely out of character for her. Voices made their way to my room and they did not sound that cheerful as I had guessed. But the voice did not belong to Henry... My heart skipped a beat and I wished I was not quite as sick. The man came into my room and bowed, and he smiled with a flash of hope in his eyes. I did not understand why he was here, and why his expression was so pleased. Was this what Cassie was excited about? \"Hello Jane,\" John Warren said and stared into my eyes in a way that made me feel quite uncomfortable. I looked away and did not respond back. John Warren was the man who had destroyed my future with that simple letter to Tom's uncle. My life had ceased to exist because of John... Warren. \"Jane, I know that you did not call for me, but I wished to see you. I needed to see you and know that you were becoming healthier.\" I noticed Cassie in the doorway holding a some what angry, yet distressing expression. She shrugged and mouthed, 'I did not know.' I believed her, and I turned back to the annoying Mr. Warren in front of me. \"Leave me be,\" I said and his joyful smile faltered but he quickly recovered. He kneeled beside my bed and reached to grab my hand, which I pulled out of the way. \"My dearest Jane, I have been wishing for you for so long. I will and shall wait for you forever.\" I stared at the man with incredulity. How dare he stand here and tell me this, as I was lying on my sick bed? \"I love you Jane, and I fought with myself, but I had the urge to tell you in hopes that it would help lead to a speedy recovery. Jane, my hopes are that you have forgiven me after all these five years.\" My mouth hung open and Jane walked into the room. \"Mr. Warren, please, my sister is tired,\" Cassie lightly touched his arm in the hopes from him to leave. \"Jane, please, tell me you love me, that you have forgiven me as I have wished for so long.\" What was I supposed to say? I closed my mouth and stared at the man in disbelief. Why me? \"Jane?\" He asked and I unfroze, and saw he was almost begging. \"Sir, I ask you to leave now,\" Cassie said louder now and more forceful. Angry, he stood straight and looked down at me. \"You do not have to answer now my dear, but as soon as you recover, I would like an answ-\" \"No,\" I said, my first words of the new day. \"I do not love you Mr. Warren and I do not and shall not...\" I paused to catch my breathe. \"I shall not forgive you. How dare you... come and tell me...\" \"Jane,\" Cassie warned and looked at me with her motherly look. I ignored her and continued, \"How dare you come while I am sick and expect me... to answer you in this manner. Your visit… was unexpected… and some what rude. But I did answer your question, despite how rude your... behavior was.\" I finished and lay down; feeling rather well even as my head swam with dizziness and my joints ached. Mr. Warren stood there, and Cassie shrunk back with pain on her face. I understood how hard it was to lose someone you loved, but if he had truly loved me all those years ago, he would have not sent that letter. \"Good day Madame and I am very sorry to distress you with my actions.\" He turned quickly on his heels and Cassie after him. \"Well, well, Mr. Warren,\" Tom Lefroy said and Cassie jumped with surprise, and Mr. Warren babbled in disbelief. Tom's intense piercing blue eyes meet my own, and he simply smiled, I smiled back and at once, I felt happier. I'm sorry to pause it there, but I'm exhausted and it's late. Also sorry for this chapter being very late, and pretty short, but school does come before fan-fiction.... unfortunately. I shall try my best to update next weekend and I promise no excuses! Thank you for reading and please review! =)[Chapter 5] How good does it feel to be writing again! I have missed my story and thank you reviewers, you guys are awesome! Disclaimer: I do not and never will own Becoming Jane and it's wonderful characters. ~paperbackwriter9 Jane's P.O.V Quickly, Mr. Warren scrambled and left the room, barely able to say a proper hello to Tom. Henry walked in and raised his eyebrows. \"Does that odd fellow still come to call on you Jane?\" The silence in the room was strong but I could not answer Henry as I stared at Tom. \"Ye- yes,\" Cassie said and cleared her throat. \"I'll just, Jane, I-\" She stopped and looked at me and smiled. Maybe there was a sign of life on my face that she could finally see. Like a small child, she tip toed out of the room and Henry laughed and sat on a chair. Through the chaos, Tom stood there, with a small crease between his eyebrows. \"Get on with it now,\" Henry said, \"do I need to introduce you to my sister?\" \"No, I remember her quite well,\" he said and his voice was crystal clear, just like the last time I saw him. \"Hello Jane,\" and the crease disappeared and a smile came through his odd expression. \"Hello Tom,\" I said with the feeling of joy seeping out of me. Now fresh questions ran through my brain and made me feel nervous. Was he married? Why was he here? And how horrible did he think I looked? Henry cleared his throat and stood, \"Well have a nice chat, I'm off to see my Eliza,\" and with one smile and wink at me he left the room. Awkwardness settled on top of us and he sat down on the chair. I cleared my throat and he shot up and came to the bedside. \"Jane,\" his eyes were starting to fill with tears, \"I'm sorry... I should have came earlier.\" He stared down at me and looked me over and I felt embarrassed and flushed all at once. \"It is not your fault Tom,\" I whispered, \"You married and did what you had to do.\" My heart ached at the thought of freedom he had. He could bare to be in sight of me and had a wife at home in London. \"Why are you here?\" I asked in a small voice feeling my heart rip at the seams. The author in me noted this as an helpless and twisted emotion that I could use in a story, and I felt tears. Tom scoffed and looked at me with a puzzled gleam in his eye. \"To see you of course. Henry found me and told me...\" He motioned to my limp body laying on the bed. \"I love you Jane.\" My eyes spilled with tears and he sat on the bed next to me. Stroking my face, Tom whispered comforting words, \"Stop!\" I said and he dropped his hand to the bed side. \"Jane I don't understand-\" He acted as if he had missed my previous statement of him being married. How could Tom not see the shock of his presence written across my face? \"I asked you why your here... and your... married...\" It was still hard to talk and breathe all at once. \"I am not married, and my uncle passed away along time ago Jane,\" and he said this with hope in his voice, and hope returned to me. \"I have wanted you since you left me. You put so many doubts in my mind, I can not stop thinking about you! When you left me you said it was for my family, but as time went on and years passed I began to wonder if you left me because of me. Had I done something wrong? I replayed every encounter we had before that day you told me goodbye. I have not returned sooner due to the fact that I thought you did not love me, and moved on-\" Tom was still in love with me? Even after all these years my Tom had not remarried someone and I had had no reason to worry. \"Tom, if only you had come sooner, I might not of been sick-\" \"How come?\" His blue eyes were wide and I could not look away as if he was pulling me in. \"I fell asleep in the forest, because I was so upset over you. Luckily Henry found me before I froze to death,\" Tom's eyes grew with worry but all I felt was embarrassment as I admitted my story. \"If only I had indeed come sooner...\" For this next bit, I had to breathe in and out deeply. \"Tom, if I... if I die... at least I shall know that you... loved me... until the end...\" My heart felt like it was torn in two and the yearning for life made my body feel a rush of courage. \"I love you Tom, and I am sorry for... everything-\" \"Jane, you shall not die,\" and Tom took my hand and raised it to his lips, \"if you had never become sick, I might have never come because I was certainly not strong enough to come here on my own. Henry had to tell me you were sick to bring me here. You must get better Jane, we shall be together for the rest of our lives after you become healthy again.\" Tom's voice was full of confidence and hope, so much that I felt the urge to sit up. As I pushed myself up slightly higher he smiled and I did too. Now I was high enough to see out the small window and admire the outside world. The midday sun came in through the window, and made his face lovely than my dreams. Being able to touch him and know that he was real, made the past five years disappear as if they were some horrible nightmare. It was going to be winter soon enough, and the ground was beginning to harden and the leaves had fallen from their trees. Just maybe this winter was going to give me hope, instead of throwing me into my previous hibernation as last year had. \"Tom-\" A coughing fit came with his name and he called out for anyone. Henry, Cassie, Eliza, and both my mother and father came running into the small room. The need to breathe was the strongest I had felt since I first fell ill. \"Wa- ter-\" I whispered out in a raspy voice and Eliza disappeared into the kitchen. \"What should I do?\" Tom said and turned to Henry. There was fear in his voice and fear in his eyes. \"The doctor,\" Henry said and my mother said something but I could not hear as my stomach lurched and I heaved my breakfast into the waste basket besides my bed. Cassie's hand was on my back and Eliza came in with the water. \"Mama,\" Cassie said with fear, \"look,\" and as I lay down, everyone looked and became quiet. What had happened? I looked down at the waste basket and there was a small amount of blood. \"Henry, the doctor, now,\" my father whispered and Henry and Tom began leaving the room. \"Tom-\" I mumurmered and he came back quickly. Tom smiled a small smile, \"I shall return soon my love,\" and he kissed my forehead. The hopeless feeling settled into my body again. Cassie and Eliza sat down next to me as my mother paced around the room. As the three began talking, I slipped into sleep. Cassie's P.O.V The men had returned as night fell and Henry and Tom fell into the chairs with mud on their faces and weariness radiating from their bodies. Mama brought food which they had gobbled up. Eliza urged them to rest as the doctor examined Jane. Poor Tom Lefroy, Jane was worse and he had not even seen her for one good hour. My heart ached for them both, and my wishes went to Jane and her recovery. Tom persisted that he should be in the room with her, but he fell asleep on the chair outside the room before he could even lift a finger. Henry had only been able to stay awake for an hour more than Tom before he dozed off. Eliza had retired to her bed, and my mother had to pry herself from Jane's bedside due to a panic attack. Father was left with me, pacing outside the room. The doctor quietly entered into the hallway with us. His face was grave, \"I need to let out some of her blood,\" and he shook his head as he went back into the room. Father stopped moving and became silent. \"Retire to bed papa, all will be well,\" and my father shook his head no but headed up the stairs without one word. I knocked on the door and the doctor said a faint come in. He looked up at me and offered a smile, but I was unable to return it. There lay my dear Jane, bathed in candle light with sweat on her forehead, and her arm over a bowl... filled with her blood. I felt a reflex to gag, but the smile on her sleeping face made me not turn away with tears. Hopefully she was dreaming sweet dreams, with her recovery and Tom. I had not heard him enter, but the intake of air drew the doctor and my attention to Tom behind me. \"Jane,\" he said and walked up to her. \"Jane,\" his broken voice whispered again. My heart broke for him and I felt the tears rush out of my eyes, and his began to water as well. His eyes searched her almost lifeless body and he sunk to the floor. I sat trying to remember a happier time, when no one was ill and all was well. But as Tom sobbed quietly from his lack of sleep and the sadness, and Jane laying on the bed, arm dripping with blood, I could not remember such a time. Wow, what a dark cliff hanger. Surprisingly I was listening to happy songs as I wrote this, songs from Slumdog Millionaire. First off, I don't have a certain illness in mind. I'm kind of going off of what I saw in Sense and Sensibility. If you haven't watched it, it's based off of one of Jane Austen's books, and it's one of my favorites. Thanks for reading. Updates sooner as summer comes closer. =)[Chapter 6] Thank you for the reviews and for the review about this section for movies, when I made the story there was no section for Jane Austen movies. I love this chapter. And no, this is not the last one. Disclaimer: I don't own the movie and characters, just the plot. ~paperbackwriter9 Cassandra's P.O.V Day light broke through the windows of our house. Birds chirped off in the distance and the sounds of the early morning woke me from my slumber. For a moment, everything felt typical. The new day had always brought a new smell, and the sounds were the same. But then I remembered last night's events- Jane. How did I wind up in my bed? I could not remember anything but the pitiful sight of Tom sitting on the floor. Where was he? And Jane? The questions forced me out of bed and down the stairs, where I could smell the smells of breakfast time. Who was cooking? I peered my head into the small kitchen and there was mama bent over a pot. She spotted me, \"Oh Cassie, there you are, come and help,\" and she looked up at me. This gaze she had frightened me, her appearance scared me as well. My mother had strands of hair out of her bun and circles around her eyes. \"I-\" \"Cassie! There you are,\" Eliza said and I jumped. \"Go to Jane, she opened her eyes,\" and my mother stopped stirring. \"Thank the heavens!\" They both bolted out of the kitchen and for some reason I could not move. What if Jane looked worse? This is my sister. I walked to the bedroom and opened the door. Jane's P.O.V What an odd feeling to have, many faces staring down at you, piercing you with their eyes. I was to worn to be able to speak, but I forced a smile that probably did not look like one. Tom was the closest to me, and his smile was hard to understand, distressing yet joyful at once. \"Jane!\" My mother said and burst in with Eliza. She came over and kissed the top of my head. \"My baby, you can hear me?\" My mama, what a strange woman. But her odd question made me smile. \"My dear cousin, you can hear me can you not?\" Eliza said and bent over and kissed me on the head. I nodded slightly and then there was an odd silence. I did not know the reason they were standing over me. The wind blew the curtains from the open window. I smiled and felt better, a feeling I had missed. As the day wore on, I felt I could talk. Eliza, Henry, Cassie, papa, mama, and Tom were visiting me so I was never lonely in the room. Papa had recalled the events that happened before I was spitting up blood. An uncomfortable feeling washed through me during that short talk. Things were going to be all right, that much I knew. I could sit up and eat without the feeling of nausea. \"Jane,\" Tom had said to me at one hour, \"your smile is lovely,\" and I smiled for the rest of the time he was in the room. This feeling was hard to describe, but I felt whole in a way. With all my dearest family members and Tom, actually in the same house under one roof. I wanted this feeling to stay forever. And maybe now it could with Tom back. I also saw hope in Cassie's eyes as well. When she smiled, her eyes had always been somewhere else, now she was actually looking at us when she smiled. I was sure she would find another man, she was to lovely not to. The hopeful feeling was wonderful, even when the storm started. The sky turned dark quite quickly in fact, and the loud clap of thunder rumbled through the house. The last time I had been in a storm was when I had been sick. Such a long while ago. No matter, Tom was here, and not just in my imagination. He sat on the bed with me and held me, as we watched the lightening quietly out the only window in the room. I had always enjoyed rain storms. \"I love you Jane,\" he whispered into my hair. I smiled back at him. The house was fast asleep and I was safe with Tom. KNOCK KNOCK. We both jumped as there was a loud racket coming from the front door. \"One minute!\" My father yelled and I could smell the candle he lit. Tom rose and the rest of the family crept downstairs. I heard the rain as the door was opened, and an unfamiliar voice. \"Urgent,\" the mysterious man said and I was upset at only being able to sit here and listen. There was a shuffle and then the door closed. My father's voice rang throughout the house. \"It is for Mr. Lefroy,\" and I sat up higher. \"Who could it be?\" I heard Tom mutter. He walked into the room with my family behind him. \"Why I hope nobody is hurt,\" Eliza said. \"My dear who is left from his family in London?\" Eliza shot Henry a warning look but Tom paid no attention to him. He slit the letter open and pulled it out. \"Mr. Lefory, we have good news to report to you. We have found you missing wife-\" Tom stopped reading and I sat up, almost tumbling off the bed. \"Is it a mistake?\" My father asked and Eliza's eyebrows rose. No one said a word and Tom stood there reading the letter over. \"I don't understand, it is addressed to me, but I have no wife,\" and my heart settled, I believed him. There was another loud bang on the door and it took a full moment for Henry to move to answer it. People stayed where they were and Henry opened the door. \"Is Tom here?\" A woman said loudly, \"did he get the message?\" Henry walked in with a woman behind him, and I stared with confusion and anger on my face. The thin red haired girl entered the room and did not look at anyone but Tom. \"Tom!\" She said with pure joy, and then kissed him. Confused? Maybe… Wait for the next chapter and you shall see… =)[Chapter 7] Thank you for reviewing. Disclaimer: I do not own the characters, except one, and the movie and quotes from the movie or books, just the plot. ~paperbackwriter9 Jane's POV I was too confused, and upset to try to understand what had just happened. \"Tom!\" The woman said and kissed Tom… my Tom. As she stepped back, grinning at him, I took in her appearance. The girl had bright red hair, small freckles on her fair skinned face. Dark blue eyes and dimples as she was smiling at Tom and a thin body frame. Her clothes were soaked through from the rain, and then I noticed it. It was just a small black sack, but it could only mean one thing, she planned this. Tom knew this girl, and I had been lied too. My fury burst through my veins and traveled up and poured out through my mouth. \"What is going on here?\" I yelled and forced myself to sit up on the edge of the bed. \"Jane, careful,\" Cassie started to grab my arm but I waved her away. My family turned invisible as I stared at Tom's face, waiting for my answer. \"Jane,\" he started, looking from me to the girl, \"I have not idea who this is,\" and the girl frowned. \"Really Tom? You two seem to know one another quite well,\" and I stood up. \"Jane, please,\" and Tom grabbed my arm. \"Do not touch me Mr. Lefroy!\" And Tom backed up, and I began to cry. My cheeks turned red with embarrassment and I sunk to the ground, dizzy and confused. Henry came over with my mama, and picked me up onto my feet. \"Come Jane,\" Henry said, \"I shall deal with him,\" he whispered and I smiled at Henry, my favorite brother in the whole world. We walked to the door and Tom stood there, not moving, with the girl grabbing onto his arm. His face held confusion and anger, yet he seemed to want to come after me. Goodbye Tom , I thought to myself, I guess you remarried after all. Tom's POV The girl jumped at me and kissed me too fast for my mind to understand what was going on. After she backed away, I tired to understand why she was here, kissing me. I had never seen her before in my life, and yet she did remind me of someone. Red hair and freckles was the key to where she had come from, Ireland… even possibly my home town? But I had no confrontations with this woman in my life. Jane. \"What is going on here?\" Jane yelled and I become distressed at once. Who knew how I was suppose to explain what was happening if I had no idea what was happening myself. \"Jane, careful,\" Cassie told her sister and grabbed her arm but she shoved it away. This was not good. \"Jane,\" I said, keeping an eye on the other girl, \"I have not idea who this is,\" and I noticed the red haired girl frown. \"Really Tom? You two seem to know one another quite well,\" and she got up. Even though she was angry I felt proud to be in love with this strong girl, and I could not lose her trust. Suddenly I felt like I was going to explode, all due to the mysterious stranger standing next to me. \"Jane, please,\" I tried to grab her to make her see, but she yelled. \"Do not touch me Mr. Lefroy!\" And I knew just how upset she was by her using my last name. Henry went to her and whispered something I could not catch. This was not good, and as she left the room I tried to reason with her with my eyes, but she left without a look back. \"Mr. Lefroy,\" the girl said and grabbed my arm. \"How long has it been?\" I stared in disbelief at her. \"Oh, I am so hurt; you do not remember my name? He always was a joker,\" she said to Cassie and Eliza, since Jane's parents had left the room to go to her side. Who knows what they must think of me, and what they were saying… \"What is your name?\" Eliza asked with anger floating behind each word. \"Alright, since Mr. Lefroy will not tell you, I am Alaine, from Ireland, back to see my Tom.\" This was enough! \"Miss, I do not know who you are, or what you want, but you must tell me how you came to be here.\" Eliza and Cassandra looked at the girl and waited. \"Tom, you do not remember me?\" And she held a sad expression but I knew that this was some kind of trick. With my uncle gone, who else could attempt to break Jane and myself up? \"I need to retire, miss, Cassandra is it? Is there a room you can spare?\" Cassandra looked from me to the girl and being as polite and kind hearted as she is, she motioned for the girl to follow her. There was silence as Eliza and I stood in the same room. \"I do not know who to believe Mr. Lefroy, or what to believe, but now only you can fix this mess with my cousin. But may I ask one thing?\" I nodded my head, \"Do you know that girl? Is she from your hometown?\" I paused, and gained a steady voice, \"I have never seen her in my life,\" and glanced at Eliza. Her eyes searched my face and she seemed to believe me. \"Good night Mr. Lefroy,\" and she left the room. I sunk down onto a chair and put my face in my hands. Why was my relationship with Jane always being interrupted? A knock on the door made my body jump and I stood, ready for anything. It was Jane's father, Mr. Austen. \"Good evening Mr. Lefroy,\" and he motioned for me to sit. \"Good evening Sir,\" and I sat and looked at my boots. \"It seems that your guest has brought more stress to Jane, after she was so ill. Can you explain these past events to me Mr. Lefroy?\" He spoke so loud, and so well, I felt small and tiny compared to her father. I breathed in and out, \"I did not invite her to this household. I do not know the girl. I do not know for a fact, but believe that this was set up.\" \"Who would want to break off your relationship with my daughter?\" I shook my head back and forth, I did not know, maybe the fellow that had sent that note. What was his name, the son of the old woman… He cleared his throat and I looked at him. \"You may stay here and sort this out, good night Mr. Lefroy.\" I said good night sir and he left the room. This was quite a mess, and I first needed Jane on my side. I waited in the small room for about an hour or so trying to come up with a way to explain it to Jane. Just do it , I told myself and left the room and walked up the stairs to where she was now sleeping. Opening the door slightly, I tip toed into the room to see her sleeping figure facing away from the door. \"Jane?\" Her form moved slightly and I knew she was awake. She sat up and turned to me. \"Mr. Lefroy, what brings you to my room? Did you have something to say to me? Or did you want to introduce me to your wife?\" Jane rose and stood looking at me in the candle light. \"I do not know the woman Jane, you must believe me,\" and I noticed she was still in her clothes from the day time. \"Is that another lie? Or is this lie a little more truthful?\" Quickly she turned to the small writing desk in the room and shuffled through some papers. \"This,\" she held up a written on piece of parchment, \"is something I had been working on before I was ill.\" I watched her take deep breathes and began, \"We women do not forget you, so soon as you forget us ... this is our fate, rather than our merit. We cannot help ourselves. We live at home quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us ... You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions. What do you think Mr. Lefroy, is it true?\" \"I did not forget you Jane; I had not come sooner for I believed you to forget me.\" \"Am I supposed to believe this? With you living in London, and yet you tell me you did not forget me and have not had any other women at your disposal.\" \"Believe me I thought about having who ever I wanted Jane! But every time I tired to push you away, your lovely face pushed itself back into my mind. You and your presence always lingered in my thoughts, in my dreams. You destroyed me Jane!\" My body almost shook, but I felt a release of emotions that had been with me for those five years. Peace finally washed through me, and she stood staring at me, tears running silently down her red cheeks. \"Tom, I do not know what to believe at this point. To trust you would be simple, but to know the truth would be helpful,\" she wiped away her tears and turned so her back was at me. Had we wakened the house? I did not even care at this point. I walked behind her and hugged her tightly. \"Jane,\" I whispered, \"my sweet Jane, I did not have the courage to move on, even those five years ago when life looked bleak. You have been the only one I wanted. Trust me,\" and I kissed her neck. \"Tom,\" she said and pried herself out of my arms. \"When you show me proof, I shall deem you to be truthful.\" Irritation rose, but then settled, for I had got her to talk with me. My thoughts from earlier in the night drifted through my head. \"What if the man that sent the letter all those years ago, sent this girl?\" Her expressions jumped faster then lightening, and were filled with hope. \"What was his name? Mr. Wisley?\" \"No Tom, he had not sent the letters to your uncle in the fist place,\" she looked at me and I became confused. \"Is that not what you had said all those years ago?\" Her face fell and then rose. \"You never heard who had sent the letters?\" I shook my head and her face held an expression I could not explain. \"Mr. Warren sent the letters to your uncle… do you think he sent this girl?\" I was still trying to process the fact that Mr. Warren had been the reason I had not been able to marry my Jane five years ago. \"I let him just walk by. He walked right by me when I first came here! Jane why had you not mentioned this earlier! I would- I shall kill him,\" she put a hand on my arm. Jane looked into my eyes, \"Tom do not jump to conclusions. Mr. Warren might be responsible for this.\" \"Jane,\" I said and she sat on the bed, \"he saw me enter your sick room, and he had loved you from the start. He probably believed that you would come around but never had he expected me to come back for you.\" She stared at me with hope glittering in her brown eyes. I walked over to her and she looked up at me. \"I love you Jane,\" and I spoke truthfully and honestly. \"I will not let Mr. Warren, or some other good for nothing disrupt our love for each other. Please trust me, please believe me.\" Jane's POV Here he was, staring down at me, begging me to trust him, and I did. I just could not get over the fact that the girl had kissed him. Mr. Warren was probably the best guess at who would try to separate us, but what if it was not true? Could I let myself trust Tom after what I just saw? \"Jane, please say something,\" and his bright blue eyes stared down at me with hope and I was painfully aware of his distress. I guess I could give him my heart again, and I whispered yes. His lips were on mine before I could say a word. I had not felt him kiss me like this since the day I had left him and stared at him disappearing through the carriage window. His lips where on mine, and the reaction to be angry at him had disappeared. I kissed him back with the same passion and want that I had only thought I would be able to dream and write about. Tom was right here, kissing me back, and I was not sick or dreaming anymore. Who ever the mysterious girl was, and the person trying to separate us was, they were not going to be able to. We would find out who it was, and pay them a visit. Alright, so please understand, Tom is being truthful, and he never had heard that Mr. Warren had sent the letters. If you have not seen the movie, John Warren sends Tom's uncle a letter that makes the two unable to wed. Later, Mr. Warren confesses that he loves Jane, and he sent the letter, to Jane herself and she is upset (duh). Thank you for reading, next chapter soon. =)[Chapter 8] Sorry for the long update. Disclaimer: I do not own all the characters, just my ideas and plot. ~paperbackwriter9 Jane P.O.V The rain poured down, and the thunder clapped louder than any storm this month. I sat up in my bed, staring out the windows. Last night was a blur, and truthfully, I could not even remember what that girl looked like. But supposedly she was staying here as Cassie said outside my door to my mother. This was too confusing. Had someone sent her? But who would know that Tom and I had reunited after all these years? His uncle had passed away, and Mr. Warren had only seen Tom come into my room, nothing else. No one besides my family knew that Tom was here. So who was the girl? \"Jane,\" Cassie knocked on the door and I curled my knees to my chest. Truthfully I didn't want to speak to anyone, but Cassie sounded urgent. \"You can come in Cassie, please,\" and she peaked her head in. She was actually smiling and she sat down in front of me, her hand on my knee. Before she spoke, she hesitated and looked around the room. \"Last night was very strange, but-\" \"Cassie, stop, I think I need a rest from the events from last night,\" and I said it too fast. I did not want her to know that I was bothered by it, but my voice cracked. She eyed me and then nodded her head. \"Is breakfast ready?\" She shook her head no, \"Only mama, and I, and you are awake, it is still early.\" \"The storm has not woken the others?\" \"No.\" The silence was growing oddly uncomfortable and she rose and left the room. I did not want to push Cassie away, but this was my problem, not hers. Quickly I got out of my bed and dressed in a simple dark blue dress. As quietly as I could, I tip toed down the stairs and slipped on my coat. I took an umbrella and closed the door. The rain was still coming down, and I tried to hold up my dress and walked through the muddy road. Finally I came up to a small home that was on the border of entering the town. This was Mr. Warren's small home. I raised my head and knocked on the door. When no one came, I turned, but then I heard the door creak open. \"Jane? Jane Austen, do come in!\" I was happy to get out of the rain and shook off my umbrella. \"Hello Mr. Warren, I'm quite sorry for the intrusion in the early morning-\" \"It was no problem at all, I'm quite happy for it,\" he said and smiled. \"Will you not sit?\" \"Thank you,\" I said and removed my hat. The room was small but well furnished. There was a table in the corner and hallways to other rooms. \"I know that it is not grand, but I am leaving as it is,\" he said quietly, \"but if you wished me to stay…\" I looked away from the paintings, and sighed. \"Mr. Warren, I am not here to tell you that I… I do not feel the same way and I do not think I shall in the future…\" This would be harder than I thought. He held his head up, but winced and smiled like a gentleman, \"Of course Ms. Austen. Then what brings you here? Something the matter?\" \"Do you know of a girl that has come to the country, into my home, and claims she is connected to Tom Lefroy?\" I swallowed, hoping to see him make an expression that I had caught him, but he looked confused. \"I know nothing of this girl, what of it Ms. Austen?\" \"The letter that you had sent to Mr. Lefroy's uncle had come from you, in order to break up Mr. Lefroy and myself, then the girl…\" \"Are you suggesting that I sent the girl?\" \"Yes,\" and I eyed him as he eyed me back. \"Ms. Austen I did no such thing. When I left you the day you were sick, I promised myself to move on. I need to move on. I am moving to London, did I not mention that?\" He shuffled his feet nervously and I swallowed. \"So you have nothing to do with the stranger who is presently staying in my home?\" \"No, I have nothing to do with that situation. I promise you that I learned my lesson from the letter I sent. I was going to come by in the afternoon to apologize to Mr. Lefroy-\" \"If you value your life, then I would not come if I was in your place,\" and I tried not to laugh as color left his face. \"Well, thank you for the advice,\" and he rose. \"I shall get some tea.\" \"That will not be called for; I have the information that I wanted to hear. Have a pleasant trip to London sir,\" and I smiled trying not to frown. I was more lost than ever, who sent the girl? Mr. Warren bowed and I curtsied quickly. I left the home and back into the rain. I had so hoped that it was John Warren's doing, and then we could clear up the problems and move on. But it was not Mr. Warren's doing, and things were not any better. The roads were slippery and I lost my footing more than once. The information I knew was that Mr. Warren seemed to honestly not be involved. If he was truthfully moving to London, then why would he send the girl if he tried to move on and not love me? \"Oh!\" I slipped and fell backwards into the mud. All of these thoughts were impairing my vision! I was now soaked and awfully filthy. Was this worth going to get the truth from Mr. Warren? Did I want to get sick again? I stood and adjusted my hat, then looked at the hem of my dress. Just wonderful. The noise of a carriage grew louder and louder from behind me and I turned in time to see the face of Lady Gresham. The carriage stopped a short way up the road I walked to the side, not sure if I should be embarrassed or thankful. \"Ms. Austen! Are you trying to catch your death a second time!\" \"No, Lady Gresham, I was visiting… a friend,\" and I curtsied and prayed she would let me go in the carriage. \"At this hour? Well Ms. Austen, you have put me in a spot. If I do not offer you a ride, and you become ill again, you can very well blame me.\" I was not sure if she was inviting me in until she hurried me along, \"Get in!\" Once inside, I took of my hat and smiled at her, only wondering how bad my appearance truly was. \"How is your mother?\" \"She is fine thank you, how is Mr. Wisley? \"He is fine,\" she said and frowned while eyeing the hem of my dress. She was obviously still upset after I had turned her beloved nephew down, for the second time. The thoughts of that event crowded my mind. A week before I had become ill, and wandering aimlessly in the woods, Mr. Wisely had asked me once more. It was all his aunts doing I was sure, but it was harder to say no this time to such an innocent man. It was truly evil that his aunt was forcing him once again to ask for my hand in marriage. \"Ms. Austen, please forgive me, my aunt wanted me to try again. She has grown quite desperate to marry me off I'm afraid. She assumed that you would have changed your mind after the- the-\" \"The elopement? Well, I have not changed my mind. I am sorry Mr. Wisley, but I must refuse again. We are not right for each other.\" \"I know that well enough Ms. Austen.\" Yes, his aunt was always up to something, and I smiled pleasantly at her. \"Well, everyone is fine then I presume? No trouble in your home?\" \"No,\" and I eyed her, she was always assuming that my family was utterly chaotic. I would never dream of telling her about the 'guest' not unless I wanted more headaches. \"My dear, is Tom Lefroy still there?\" \"Yes, he is our guest.\" \"Guest?\" \"Yes, guest,\" and the silence grew except for the rain. Why did she stress the word guest? How did she know he was there in the first place? \"His poor uncle, died before he had any grandchildren.\" \"From who did you learn of his death?\" Lady Gresham was up to something, and I could sense it. \"The gossip is gossip, and I believe that his nephew never had any children from the gossip I heard,\" She eyed me and then turned her attention out to the window. The light that shone through showed how tired she was. Not just physically, but it was in her eyes. The way she could not accept that I had turned down her nephew and that she was not getting to my sister. I felt sympathy for her and cursed myself. Lady Gresham was a gossiper and only approved the thoughts she thought. As the carriage rolled to my house, I thanked her and climbed out. The house was stirring as I entered and saw Tom coming out from the kitchen, worried. \"Jane! Where have you been? Henry and I have been searching all over.\" \"I went to see Mr. Warren.\" \"You went? I would have gone with you…\" \"And what? Tried to get the information from him better then I could? I told him not to come over to apologize if he valued his life,\" and Tom smiled and put his hands on either arm. \"What did you find out?\" \"It is not John Warren that sent the girl, he is moving to London Tom, he said that he give up on me after I turned him down earlier when I was ill. I believe it was not his doing,\" Tom looked at me, and his hard gaze made me nervous. \"I believe it if you do,\" and I nodded. \"There you are,\" Henry said and came up to us, \"where have you been?\" I swallowed, \"At Mr. Warrens.\" \"What ever for?\" \"To prove that he was or was not involved with the girl,\" I really did not like repeating the same story to people. \"He was not involved.\" Henry sighed, \"Are you sure Jane, think of the letter...\" I went on to repeat to him about his moving to London. Then Cassie came, and Eliza, and I repeated the story until every single person knew what was happening. Mama was fanning herself in a chair and my father was looking out of the window hard. \"Where is our guest?\" Henry said, and everyone looked up at one another. In all the trouble dealing with the girl, no one thought to wake her. A knock made everyone jump and no one moved. Was this stranger at the door going to be bringing even more trouble to the household? \"I shall answer it,\" Henry said and my father shook his head no and he went to answer it. \"Yes?\" It was a messenger and people sighed, relieved it was not another guest. \"A message for Ms. Alaine Cleary, urgent,\" and the messenger turned to look at the brewing storm. \"One moment,\" and Cassie rose and headed up the stairs to wake the guest. It was at least three minutes later when the both of them walked down into the parlor. I wanted nothing to do with the girl and refused to meet her gaze. \"Are you Ms. Cleary?\" \"I am.\" \"Message for you,\" and he handed her a letter, tightly rolled and left without a word. \"How odd, who is it from?\" My mother asked and Eliza held my arm tightly. I looked up to see the her red hair free and curly, and a green dress she wore, making her look truly beautiful and Irish, just like she said. I envied her for a moment, until I pulled myself together and watched the pink drain from her cheeks as she read the letter. \"I must leave,\" and she looked up at my family. She was still a stranger to us, but her eyes were filled with worry and I wanted to know what was going on. \"I shall pack my things at once,\" and she headed to the stairs. How odd. I rose and followed her. \"Jane,\" Cassie grabbed my arm. I looked at Cassie and then she let go. I followed her to the guest room and entered. The small bag was open and she put her few dresses inside and I cleared my throat. \"Who are you?\" I asked bluntly, and she looked down. \"This is my home, and my family you have intruded on, causing stress to everyone. I have the right to know who you are, and what you want.\" Still no answer. \"Do you truly know Mr. Lefroy? Who sent you?\" At that she looked up at me. \"I can not say,\" her voice was quiet and yet now I knew what I thought all along, she was sent her. \"Ms. Austen, I did- my reasons-\" She sighed and closed the bag. \"Good day, thank you for the guest room.\" She walked out and down the stairs quickly. I heard the door shut and I closed my eyes, still in the room. I felt his hands on my shoulders and then wrap around my waist. \"We should just forget this odd event love,\" and he kissed my neck. In my whole life, this was the oddest event that had happened, ever. That night, after explaining what I had asked the girl over dinner to my family, we laughed and shook it off. While the candles burned, and the storm rumbled on, we sat around reading, sewing, and other time consuming things. It had been a while since I could laugh with my family, and it was quite nice. The candles were finally burning down, and it was time for bed, and goodness knows I needed sleep. \"Tom, I shall make up the guest room for you,\" and he kissed my hand. \"We do not need to see this,\" Henry said, sounding drunk. Henry, I heard Eliza warn him and he laughed. \"I am not drunk, just trying to lighten the mood.\" I rolled my eyes and went to the guest room to make the bed for Tom. After setting the candle on the desk and changing the sheets, I sat on the desk for a moment. I was going to personally scrub those sheets and forget that girl was ever here. The candle burned out, and I had not even noticed it was running low. Due to the clouds blocking the moon, it was very dark in the room. \"Where is that candle,\" and I found it, and knocked it over. Hot wax hit my hand and made a puddle on the desk. \"Ouch!\" I said and got off the chair and bent down to find the candle. Had it rolled under the desk? I reached for it, and found something else. A piece of paper, that's what I thought it was. I headed to my room, where I had lit a candle already and held it up. It was a piece of paper. In fact, it was the letter that was addressed to a Ms. Alaine Cleary. I almost burned the letter, as I stared at it. Maybe now my questions would be solved. The whole evening trying to forget the strange event disappeared, and I flipped it over, and began to read. Thank you for reading! I know exactly how my story is going to work out. =] Please review. Until next time![Chapter 9] Wow, I love this story. Hehe =) Thank you my reviewers! Disclaimer: Don't own, just my plot and characters. This story is very opposite from what really happened, so please remember this is a fan-fic! ~paperbackwriter9 Alaine Cleary It has come to my awareness that you have not fulfilled the agreement that we had created. Please pack your things and visit me as soon as you have received and read this letter through. We must discuss the money that was given to yourself, due to my belief that you have not earned it. Understand Ms. Cleary that if you do not come to see me at once, I shall still collect my money. If you do not return to your household, I shall still collect the same amount I have paid you from your family's own wages. I advise you to not take my warnings lightly. You have not seemed to disrupt the relationship between Tom Lefroy and Jane Austen; therefore you are being dismissed from her home. The letter was not signed. I placed my hand over my stomach and breathed in sharply. It was one thing to suspect someone was trying to separate us, but another to see the plans written out on paper. What was so wrong about Tom and I being together? I walked to the window and placed my hand on the cool glass. Well, no one would force us apart. At that thought, anger spread through me. We had been through too much to be forced apart once more. The pounding in my head was painful, so I placed my head against the cool glass window. The rain still fell, and puddles surrounding the trees had grown larger. At least there was no thunder and lightening. If I was to ever lose Tom again, I could almost see myself lying face down in the puddle. That thought brought shivers running down my spine. \"Goodnight Tom!\" I heard someone shout and I left the window and waited for him to come into the guest bedroom. I heard footsteps on the stairs and then a voice. \"Jane? Are you still in there?\" \"Come in Tom,\" and he slowly entered the room. \"Jane, what is the matter?\" \"You're drunk,\" I said looking at him. \"I swear I'm not, even smell my breathe. Not a trace on me,\" and he walked over to me. It was true; there was no scent of alcohol anywhere. \"See?\" And he smiled and lifted my chin, \"What is the matter?\" \"Tom,\" I whispered out and felt the tears behind my eyes start to form. \"I can not believe it,\" and I looked at the floor. \"What is it love?\" His face held concern, and I could not imagine what he would do when he read the letter. I held it up without a word, and he hesitated. \"Go on, read it. It is the same letter that the messenger delivered to the girl that left.\" He grabbed it out of my hands and I watched his eyes move quickly over the words. When he finished, he looked up at me. \"Jane, this is- it is true. Someone is trying to break us away from one another.\" Then the tears fell from my eyes. Not just because of the letter, but because of everything. I had not had one moment to rest in a very long time. Before I was sick I had been heart broken, then deathly ill, then Tom came, and the strange girl, and now this letter. I had not had a chance to write! How I missed my pen and paper and my stories. \"Oh Jane, I will not let anyone split us. We will ignore this. We shall be unbreakable,\" and he pulled me to him. For all the time Tom was here, in my home, I had not had a moment with him that was not clouded with worries or doubts. \"I love you Jane.\" \"I love you Tom,\" and he kissed me lightly. \"What if we went somewhere?\" \"Where?\" \"To my apartment in London?\" \"Tom, what will people say? We are not married,\" and he sighed and I looked up at him. His blue eyes stared ahead and I sighed as well. \"What if we traveled with Henry and Eliza, we could all get away from the country and to the exciting city of London,\" he looked at me and smiled. It was a good idea, \"I have no money to spend,\" and painfully enough that was too true. \"I have money for the both of us,\" he said and smiled. \"And my parents? What will they say?\" \"You are old enough to travel with your brother, and cousin, and future husband by yourself, is you not?\" \"Of course I- future husband?\" My heart started to beat and he went down slowly onto one knee. I could not believe this! Tom smiled and kissed my hand, \"I am just as nervous as you are, and this is sudden, but Jane, my Jane, I love you… will you marry me?\" \"Oh Tom! Yes!\" I smiled and shouted and he rose and kissed me. \"This is not the most romantic place, but I could not wait any longer. And Jane, you shall see that no one will ever separate us,\" and he kissed me again. The place did not matter to me at all, but the fact that I was now engaged to Tom Lefroy! Thoughts of the letter disappeared quickly from my mind, as I was in his strong arms. Jane Lefroy… sounded nice. The door opened and my family entered. They were just outside the door, listening in to the proposal. \"I told them my plans while you where up here,\" Tom admitted and each member of my family smiled. Mama came over to me and kissed my hand, \"My Jane is getting married, finally,\" and she had tears in her eyes. My father told me how much I deserved this happiness. Eliza and Henry offered their congratulations and Cassie hugged me and cried. When everyone had settled and the moon was now fully round and bright, we all readied for bed and I kissed Tom again for the hundredth time that night. I took the letter from my pocket, and he took it from me. \"Tonight, dream happy things. Jane, I love you,\" and he kissed my forehead lightly. But as I lay in bed, I could not think of anything but the word finally. How many times had I imagined being married to him? I was so close with the elopement, but to actually be out in the open and able to marry him and feel no regret about anything. Too many thoughts clouded my head, so I rose and lit a candle and pulled out a story I had been working on. It was called, First Impressions , and I loved it to death. I sat at my table, and wrote, wrote until my hand cramped. Picking up the paper, I read over the idea I had wrote down. It was about Elizabeth's sister Jane finally being proposed to by Mr. Bingley. The girls, and their mother were listening outside of the door and Elizabeth felt happiness for her sister Jane. I stared at the words and laughed loudly out loud. For once, I felt happy. The sun rose and the light wind blew the curtains around my window. Quietly and silently I rose and looked out the window. There was no rain for once, like there had been for the entire week. How lovely! I changed into a soft red dress and headed down the stairs, and saw that my parents had decided to over sleep this Tuesday morning. Cassie was awake and sewing an old dress of hers in the kitchen, and the Eliza seemed to be reading and talking to Henry about important matters. Tom was no where to be seen and I sighed. \"Cousin! Come here,\" Eliza said and I walked into the parlor. \"Good morning,\" I said and Henry yawned loudly. \"Henry,\" Eliza said and frowned at him. \"Excuse me sister, I'm afraid I'm not aloud to yawn,\" and he smiled and Eliza rolled her eyes. \"If you'll excuse me,\" and he bowed to me and winked. I sat over by Eliza and helped with some sewing she had on the chair. \"Why is he in such a happy mood?\" \"We are returning to London. We have been away long enough, and Henry is anxious to depart. I am as well, and I hear that you and your fiancé are also going to London.\" I think that is wonderful Jane! We shall go out and have quality time to spend-\" \"It is not yet finalized, I have not told mama, or papa,\" and she eyed me. \"You are old enough to be on your own, I am sure they shall understand,\" and she smiled and returned to her book. When I did not move, she looked up. \"Go own Jane,\" and she lifted her eyebrows. Sighing, I stood and walked to see if my mama had woken. Before I reached the stairs, the door opened and Tom walked inside with his hands behind his back. \"Good morning my darling,\" and I laughed. \"Darling? I am not ready for-\" and he pulled out a bouquet of flowers. \"Oh Tom, their lovely,\" and I took them. \"Have you told you mother about the plans?\" \"No-\" \"Jane,\" he sighed. \"I was on my way when you came in,\" and he sighed. I left him standing there and walked up to see my mother. She was walking down the hall when I was at the top of the stairs. \"I woke late, so much excitement last night,\" she said tucking her hair up. As she headed down the stair case, and I followed after quickly. \"My stomach is rumbling, I hope there is tea,\" she said to herself. \"Mama,\" and I followed her into the kitchen. \"Your wedding must be planned well, for we shall not waste money on dresses that will just go to waste. How excited everyone shall be! I wonder if…\" \"Mama-\" \"Oh Jane, you have made me so happy. Mr. Lefroy can afford things well enough-\" \"Mama!\" I yelled and she turned to look at me. \"Yes Jane?\" I breathed in and the out, \"I am going to go with Eliza, Henry, and Tom to London for a short while, to distract and forget about the events dealing with that stranger that had come.\" My mother eyed me, and then did something I did not expect. She hugged me. \"Is that a yes mama?\" \"Jane, you are old enough, and engaged. You should go if you want to,\" and she smiled at me. \"I am so proud of you,\" and I shook my head. \"For what?\" \"Everything,\" and I smiled. Even with the sun out, the wind had picked up, and I pulled my hat tight on my head. The carriage Tom had sent for was here, and the sun had risen a short time ago. Cassie had woke up with us, and I begged her to come along. \"I will only be a burden,\" and she pulled the blanket around her shoulders tighter. I was sad for my sister, wanting her to feel the same love that I felt. It truly pained me to leave her and know that I was engaged, and her fiancé had sadly died. \"This is a wonderful chance at happiness for you, and you deserve it so much. Do not fret over your sister.\" Mama hugged me tightly, and my father sighed and spoke, \"I can not believe you found someone who is worthy for you my sweet Jane,\" and that unexpectedly brought tears into my eyes. \"We must go now I'm afraid,\" Henry said and kissed my mother on the cheek and shook hands with my father. A noise brought our attention to the road. It was a carriage and it was headed towards our house. Tom squeezed my hand and I hoped that this was not other scheme of someone's. I then recognized it as Lady Gresham's carriage, what could she want? As it pulled up, she leaned out the window. \"Why Lady Gresham, what brings you here?\" My mother asked her and she eyed me and Tom. \"I heard by word of mouth that these two are engaged?\" It was a strange pause, and no one said anything. \"My congratulations,\" and I eyed her. Did she really mean that? Had she come to our house just to see if it was true that I was engaged? \"Thank you,\" Tom said and Eliza walked forward. \"We are so happy that they are together. Lovely isn't it? That after all these years, they loved one another.\" If I could yell at Eliza, I would. What was she thinking? \"Hmm, yes, quite lovely. I must be going, good morning,\" and the carriage left. \"How strange,\" my father said and no one moved for a moment. \"We really must be on our way,\" Tom said and I turned to Cassie. She hugged me, \"Do not think of Lady Gresham. She will not longer be able to use her poor nephew to woo you.\" And at those words, I almost jumped. What if Lady Gresham really did send the letter, and the girl? \"Jane? The carriage?\" And gave Tom my hand and I went and sat inside away from the wind. \"Goodbye!\" We yelled as the carriage left for the busy city of London, and I smiled at Cassie who shrunk in the distance. My mother and father had left to go inside, and she stood there, all alone and I almost stopped the driver to go and get her. Please , I wished, may Cassie find someone to love. I love this, I must admit. The other chapters are all planned out and I can not wait to post again soon! Thank you reading and reviewing, it means so much! Some of the 'events' that Jane went through in the chapter I had her write about in her book First Impressions , also known as Pride and Prejudice , she changed the title when she published the book.[Chapter 10] Hope everyone's summer is going well. =) Disclaimer: I do not own, just my plot. ~paperbackwriter9 It has been three lengthy weeks in London. And I am home sick. The first week had taken my breathe away, with the plays we attended and the dances and restaurants. It was truly heaven to be able to be with Tom and feel care free. To also be with my brother Henry and Eliza was all the better. Yet as I enjoyed the dancing and food, I ached to think my poor Cassie was at home, helping mama. So even though I had caught up on my writing and stories with all the free time I had here, I wanted… needed to go back. The problem was I did not know how to tell Tom. His apartment was lovely, but we never had a chance to lounge around. For Tom was busy with his work, and I wanted to be able to write when I could. The conversations we did have consisted of London, our plans, and childhoods. Henry and Eliza fit into the busy London life perfectly, and at times I felt quite out of place. Today, the sky was clear and the people were just as busy as ever, and I stared out the window in the dining room. I shall only visit for a week , I told myself. Tom can spare me one week. Just then I heard the front door open and Tom's voice call out. \"Jane?\" Quickly I lay my pen down and hurried down the steps and into his arms, where he hugged me. \"What a day Jane, work was exhausting… How was your day my love?\" \"It was wonderful; I have almost completed my book. A few areas need touching up, but I think it is almost finished,\" and he smiled and looked at me. \"I think I shall help you find a publisher,\" and my eyes lit up brightly. \"Do you mean that?\" \"I had always planned to,\" and he smiled and kissed me, and it was not quite a soft kiss. He hugged me and I hugged him back, forcing myself to say what I needed to say. I broke the hug and backed a way a foot, and then looked up at him. \"Jane? What is it?\" Tom was too good at sensing problems, and things I needed to say. It was the only thing that bothered me sometimes, but now he was interested, and I needed to tell him. \"I need to see my sister. I miss her and my home, I'm sorry Tom, but please? Only for a week,\" and when I finished he laughed. \"Why of course, I could and would not hold you back from seeing them. You need to only say when, and the carriage will be ready,\" and I smiled and hugged him. He looked at me after a moment, \"I can not go with you,\" and my face fell, \"I have work that must be finished, but I shall still be here when you return,\" and I laughed softly. \"Tomorrow I would like to leave, the earlier I leave, the faster I will return to you,\" and I kissed him, and he kissed me. As the scenery changed from busy carriage and horse filled streets to quiet hills, and the forests, it was relaxing. Staying in London was exciting and quick paced, but as I stared out at the open space and could see the beautiful stars, I realized how home sick I truly was. The carriage rolled on and I leaned back, seeing dark shapes and finally drifted to sleep. \"Miss? Miss Austen-\" I opened my eyes and looked for Tom, only to remember I was headed back home. I felt an overwhelming sadness, but I told myself I would be with him again soon. \"Yes?\" I answered and looked at Tom's driver. \"We have arrived Miss Austen,\" and he smiled and opened the door fully. The light made its way inside and I saw my home. My smile grew and I saw mama come outside, only to shout for papa and Cassie. The driver helped me out and placed the two bags I brought next to me. I stretched and then I saw Cassie run out with a smile bigger then mine. So I ran to her and hugged her. \"Jane! Oh how I have missed you,\" and then mama and papa were next to me too. \"Jane, are you here for a visit?\" Of course that was the question my mother would ask first. \"Yes, I was home sick,\" and I hugged her, \"are you not happy to see me?\" \"Yes my Jane, how we have all missed you,\" and my father kissed my forehead. \"You know your mother; she just wanted to make sure the wedding was still on. \"Of course it is! When I return I am going with Eliza to get fitted for a dress.\" I saw Cassie sigh but the smile was still on her face, and I did not say anything. My father cleared his throat, \"The house has been quiet without you, even with the changes-\" My mother quickly elbowed my father. He looked at her and she cleared her throat, and put on a smile. \"Come inside Jane, you must be starving,\" my mother took my arm and I looked at Jane. She read my face easily enough and looked away from me. What was going on? What changes? As we entered the house I saw flowers and the curtains were fully open. Much different from when I had left only three weeks ago. I felt a change with my family, and the house, but I could not put a finger on what it was. \"Let us eat!\" My father said and I agreed, for I was starving. After I changed and freshened up, we sat in the dining room and ate a full dinner. I described to my father the details of city life, and to my sister and mother, the details of the plays and balls, and shops. \"Your dress must be absolutely stunning, you deserve it,\" Cassie said and placed her hand over mine. \"I would like to help with the wedding, but I can not,\" she said. It struck me that it was odd that she did not want to help, but I thought nothing off it until my mother gave Cassie a look. \"What is it?\" I asked and the silence was filled with my mother staring my father down and Cassie shifting in her chair. \"Nothing at all dear,\" and my mother ate a bite of the cake that was for dessert. \"So how are Henry and Eliza? Well?\" \"Yes, they have been showing me the whole city, and the best places to dine. Eliza has been showing me the best places to purchase a wedding cake, and the dress. I am so excited, so Cassie you must try to visit me and help.\" \"I shall try,\" and she smiled softly. \"Why would you not? Do you have pervious plans?\" My mother cleared her throat as Cassie opened her mouth to speak. \"What is it that you're hiding Mama?\" I asked and stared at her this time with a pleading. \"Your mother is trying to hide the e-\" My father stopped as my mother stood up. \"Excuse me, Jane,\" and I stared at Cassie and papa. What was it? But they looked down and away from me. I followed her into the kitchen and helped her clean the plates. \"Mama, please I want to only help. Is it money? Tom would be more then happy to help, he has told me so himself,\" and she scrubbed the dish harder. \"I am apart of this family! I have the right to now what is wrong!\" I yelled and she stopped. \"Cassie is engaged,\" and then she looked at the dishes, but stopped cleaning them. \"What?\" I barely asked. I had not left but three weeks ago, and she was engaged? Did she love him? Who was the him? \"Mama, who is it?\" I whispered and waited for her to speak. As she turned to me, she smiled slightly. \"Mr. Wisely,\" and she looked at me. ?! \"It happened soon after you left. Cassie was helping-\" \"How in the world does Mr. Wisely deserve Cassie! She is the most kind, thoughtful creature and heart broken at that. This must be because she still misses-\" I could not say his name, after her fiancée's death; I could not say it for the fear of Cassie bursting into tears. But this was not right, they did not go together, or match. I was no match maker, but it clearly was not a good fit! \"Jane! This does not concern you, be happy for her, that is the most you can do. You have been lucky and found someone who truly loves you, so do not think you have the right to tell her who she can not marry,\" and my mother's eyes watered. \"Mama,\" I said softer, \"you do not want this either?\" It was not a question, but more of a statement. She rubbed her eyes and starting cleaning again. \"This is not open for decision, and I am happy for my daughter-\" \"Then why did you want to keep it a secret from me?\" I felt hurt, helplessness, and sadness all due to the news, missing Tom, and my family wanting to keep something extremely important from me. My mother placed down the dishes and walked out of the kitchen. She talked quietly and I followed her. \"Because, this is what I knew what would take place. You would go and convince Cassie to break it off. Can you imagine what people would say after that? After you denied him, and then the almost elopement, do you know what the town would say if they did not wed?\" \"So the whole town knows already? When did he ask for her hand?\" I was still in shock. I had planned to come back and visit and disappear from the busy London streets, and this is the news I come home to hear. My mother stopped by the stairs and seemed to look around if Cassie was listening in. \"It only happened three days ago, and they became close about four days after you left. Please Jane, my nerves, I need to rest,\" she placed her hand on her forehead. \"Mama-\" But it was no use arguing with her. I needed to speak to Cassie, and found out how this all took place. Did she love him? Did he make her happy? I admit I was too quick to judge that they did not match together. But this was my dear sister, who had suffered a lose so great, that her heart was and I still guessed, broken. I only wanted Cassie to find someone to love again, with the same kind of passion that Tom and I shared, that she had once shared. But did she love him? I looked in the dining room but saw no one. So I headed to the stairs and heard my father and mother discussing something. I looked in Cassie's room, and sure enough she was there, sitting looking out the window. Knocking, I pushed the door open wider and she jumped. A tear rolled down her cheek. \"Oh Jane, come in, I was only day dreaming, well it is the night but-\" She talked and laughed, but I could sense the sadness behind her jumbled words. I sit on the bed across from her she looked at me, with no false smiles. \"Cassie-\" \"How I miss him Jane, it hurts, horribly,\" and she started to sob, and my heart ached for her. \"I assume, no I know, mama told you the news. It is true,\" and I could not speak. \"It is good for the family, good for me,\" she stared up at me trying to plead for a good answer. \"It-\" I cleared my throat, \"it is wonderful,\" and I folded my hands on my lap. How I wish I could say what I truly thought but that would make things worse. Her smiled grew a slight amount and she sat on the bed next to me. \"Tell me how it happened,\" I said calmly. She smiled and I felt my heart crack for her as I looked at that smile. She would never share that smile with someone she truly loved, like how Tom and I do. Stop. I told myself, maybe there was love between them after all. So I turned to her to listen to the story that would be changing her life, and mine. I am so excited to write the next chapter! =) Thank you for reading and reviewing! It means A LOT. And yes, this is very different from her real life, but again it is a fan/fic(:[Chapter 11] So here is chapter 11! Yes, it is short. Disclaimer: I do not own the movie, but the plot is mine, and so are my characters. Paperbackwriter9~ \"It was after you had left that I took a walk through the forest. I came across Mr. Wisely and had a short chat about the weather, and your journey to London. It was nothing to me until a few days later I heard through mama that he was ill. Since I had just talked to him, I wanted to be kind enough to wish him well. The conversations we had carried on and on. I found myself smiling, and he asked me to come back since I had made his dreary day so much more uplifting.\" I nodded my head and watched her blush. \"After he was not ill, we took walks and talked for hours. I must admit it is not passionate love, but it is a companionate love that will keep me happy and comfortable,\" she looked at me with fear almost. I was not sure of her love for him. I could not put it into my mind that she could marry someone without experiencing any overwhelming feelings of true happiness. \"Cassie, do you truly love him?\" I stressed the word truly. \"I realize I do not share the kind of love that you have made clear is the only type you'll accept. But I do not want to end up alone in my old age, and I am already getting older every day. You have someone too turn to, and yet you can not be happy for me,\" I felt an argument on the raise and I tried to speak softly. \"Your happiness is what I am questioning Cassie,\" and she stood up and walked to the window. The sky was clear and moonlight shone through the glass. \"You should not judge me Jane,\" she whispered and I had to strain my ears to understand. Was she upset? Her back was facing me and I did not want to move closer for fear of an argument. \"I have found someone that will grow old with me, and support me.\" \"But is it love?\" I said a bit too strongly and she turned with tears in her eyes. \"It is what it is, now leave the room. Please.\" I all wanted to do was find words to comfort her, and I had already managed to fail at that. I did not want to yell at her, but I wanted her to do the right thing. If Cassie's marriage to Mr. Wisely was going to truly be planned, I did not want Cassie to feel trapped. Even as I stood there facing my sister, and my best friend, I could not say what I was thinking aloud. I could not show her truly what she was doing to herself, because it would be hurtful more then helpful. The whole situation was not what I had wanted to come home to deal with, and now it seems I had made it worse. \"Cassie, I do not want to return to London on a bad note,\" and she stood and stepped around me. \"Please Jane, Tom is missing you,\" and she eyed me and then left the room. I stood there and felt horrible. I was with the man I loved, and poor Cassie had lost her only love, only to now be in a situation of friendship with the man she was engaged to. Tears rolled down my face as I stood there. It was heart breaking to be helpless and watch my sister start her whole life with someone she did not love like she once had. And I did nothing, because I was afraid to. In the early morning I said my goodbyes to mama and papa and Cassie even though she did not respond. As I looked back from my carriage I saw my mother waving and my father smiling, and my sister staring at the ground. When they were out of sight I sighed, and suddenly felt overheated and overwhelmed. I placed my head in my hands and sighed. I felt the tears but they did not fall. If Cassie was brave enough to put herself and her future life through this, I would be brave enough too. If only I had left without a fight in my presence. And those words I thought made my tears fall. No. I knocked on the front of the carriage and told the driver to make a stop at the Mr. Wisely's residence. This was not going to happen without a word from him. I wanted to hear him say that he loved her, no matter what type of love that might be. I needed to be able to return to London with something. As the carriage rode over bumps and holes, I stared out and felt powerful. Maybe it was the thoughts or what I was about to ask. I realized I had not been asked to call on his home, but it did not matter. My sister came before anything, and this was important to me. The driver must have thought I was mad, and he watched as I left the carriage and knocked on the doors of the house. After a moment or two, Mr. Wisely himself answered the door. \"Jane? What brings you here? I was just leaving myself,\" and he smiled. When I did not return his smile, his face fell. \"Have you heard the news? Are you upset by it? I can assure you I will take very good care of your sister.\" \"Do you love her Mr. Wisely; do you absolutely mean what you have just told me?\" I must appear mad; I thought and laughed at myself inside my head. But Mr. Wisely did not laugh at me, in fact he took a big breathe and sighed. \"Cassie is beautiful, and lovely, and kind, and smart. She would make anyone a perfect wife, and I am just glad that I had a chance to win her heart. Yes, I do love her Jane, I swear by it.\" I believed him. Of all the things I could say about Mr. Wisely, honesty was at the top of the list. So I half smiled, and we walked down to my carriage in silence. \"Allow me,\" and he opened the door. \"Are you returning to London so soon?\" \"Yes, sadly I am.\" \"Well I'm sure Cassie was happy for your visit,\" and I felt guilty as he said it. \"I do hope she was,\" and just as I was going to say goodbye, I thought of something. \"Mr. Wisely, I have an odd question to ask, but have you ever had an Irish visitor stop by your home?\" \"That is an odd question, but I believe the answer is no. May I ask what brought you to ask that question? I looked at him and was very sure he wasn't lying, so I told him, \"Awhile ago we had a woman come to our house, when Tom was staying there, and she claimed to know him. I thought it was Mr. Warren who had sent her. And after an encounter I had had with your mother, I had wondered if you had heard anything about the strange event.\" He stared thoughtfully at the scenery behind us, and shook his head. \"Are you suggesting that my mother had sent her?\" \"I am simply trying to figure out who sent her, and I am not accusing you due to any other event that has taken place,\" and I crossed my fingers, hoping he would say that it was his mother and that I could return to London and tell Tom we had nothing to worry about. Instead he shrugged his shoulders and looked at me sadly. \"I am sorry Ms. Austen; I can offer you no help for this strange situation. If my mother had anything to do with it, I am truly embarrassed, but I have heard nothing from her. I wish I could help, and I will keep on the look out for information,\" and he smiled. I walked to the carriage, and he opened the door and offered his hand. \"Thank you for everything Mr. Wisely, truly. You are a kind soul, and I shall be excited to return for the wedding, whenever the date may be.\" \"We shall defiantly write to you beforehand,\" and we said our goodbyes. The carriage took off and headed back for London, and the mysterious visitor situation continued on. My excuse for the long update is one you have probably heard before. So I am not going to say anything except I am sorry for the wait, but the story will be finished, trust me on that. I love this story too much to let it sit unfinished. Thank you for reading and reviewing, you guys are awesome!![Chapter 12] At last I have updated! I am so happy to be back on track! I hope everyone's holidays went well, and 2010? I can not believe it! Disclaimer: I do not own Becoming Jane, just my characters and my plot. ~paperbackwriter9 At last I was back in London. The city life around me was up and moving, unlike back at home in the country. I was in quite a bad mood from Cassie's engagement news. Was I the one at fault for her not speaking to me? I had just offered my opinion and worries about the marriage she was entering into. But I could not be sad for long, for as soon as the carriage rolled to the front of the apartment. Tom was walking outside, and turned and smiled. Pushing the door quickly open, my thoughts about Cassie soon disappeared and I ran into his arms. Such a feeling it was, to be able to know that Tom was mine forever. It was not a dream that I would awake from on my sick bed, but reality. \"I had missed you my love,\" and he smiled and kissed me softly. We strolled slowly back into the apartment after the driver handed me my few bags. It was calming and I missed the smell that it had; a smell of books, and ink, and home. It was very refreshing to be back, and sadly it was already more relaxing then when I had went to relax at home. \"So my dear, how was the visit? It was shorter then I realized.\" \"There was a dilemma,\" I sighed and sat down on the chair in the sitting room. \"Trouble? Nothing too serious I hope,\" he said and frowned. \"No, but… but Tom, Cassie is engaged!\" My voice rose and heartache rushed through me again. How could Cassie marry a man whom she did not love and need! \"To whom?\" He asked with laughter and curiosity, \"Only you Jane would be upset at the fact she is engaged.\" \"Mr. Wisely,\" I said quietly and he stopped the laughter. \"Oh Jane, do not be upset, I am sure there is a good reason behind all of it,\" and he sat down next to me and curled his arms around me. I felt protected and safe, and I smiled, burying my face into his sleeve. I murmured that I did not want to think about it and he nodded. \"We do not need to discuss it. But I must say, I was very lonely without you,\" and I looked up and he smiled down at me. His lips came into contact with mine, and I felt the strength he possessed as he pulled me closer to him. His hand was carefully on the back of my neck, and I felt myself tingle with delight as my thoughts about everything disappeared. It was pure joy to be with him and have him safe next to me. Tom suddenly pulled away and picked me up from the seat into his arms. \"Tom!\" I yelled and laughed. \"I love you Jane,\" and my laughter died down as I looked at him was emotions pouring through me. \"I love you Tom Lefroy,\" and he smiled. It had been planned that tomorrow morning I was going to go shop for a wedding dress, and find a gift to send to Cassie in hopes to make up, and for the engagement. I truly hoped that it would work, but I had doubts. Eliza had called earlier and we had planned it out, yet I could not sleep. With candles lit and in a room to myself, I took out my book, titled First Impressions. It was in need of something, and I stared at the pages waiting for the thoughts to run through my tired mind. My character Elizabeth and her friend Charlotte were on this page, and as I read I did not like it. Then an idea came to me, and it was simple and perfect for the rest of the scene that I was working on. I wrote how Elizabeth was frustrated with her friend Charlotte for marrying someone she did not love. It was the perfect scene and it was quite easy to write as I imagined herself and Cassie. With the energy I had spent in writing furiously, I put the book back into the drawer and would reread it tomorrow. I hoped it sounded as good as it did at the present moment. Yawning, I crept up and into my room, blindly finding the bed, and sleeping. \"Wake up my love,\" and I slowly opened my eyes. Tom's face was peering down into my own and I smiled and then came to realization. \"Tom! I am not yet dressed!\" I sat up and looked around the room. \"It was quite hard to not to ignore you, with waking up to see you in my bed,\" and he laughed, pointing around his room. \"I am so embarrassed,\" but then I was not as I looked at the smile that rested upon his face, and we laughed quietly. He kissed me and then left me to get dressed in my room, and I quickly hurried. I had overslept and Eliza was to be here quite soon, and I had not yet eaten breakfast. A red dress would due today, and my hair was easily pulled back into a bun with dark brown curls around my face. After I had tainted my lips a pale pink, and pinched my cheeks for a bit of color, I was satisfied and I slipped on my shoes and grabbed the coat and hat, and then went back for my gloves and a scarf. The cold wind would be furious today, and I did not want to get sick. As I walked down the stairs, to the dining room for breakfast, Tom sat there reading the paper. \"You look prettier than ever my dear,\" and he smiled. \"What is it Tom?\" And he feigned a hurt expression. \"Robert, do you believe she thinks so little of me?\" He said to the cook, and Robert smiled. \"I believe you are up to something as well sir,\" and he laughed and I smiled, and touched his hand. \"What is it Tom?\" \"Henry,\" he swallowed, \"Henry as asked me to accompany him to the bar tonight for a small brawl, just for some winnings and the glory of fighting once again.\" \"Tom? I did not know you still boxed. What if you get injured?\" \"Truthfully Jane, I still boxed, the last time was just before I came to see you,\" and he wiped his mouth and stood up, and pushed the chair in. He kissed my head and stood above me. \"It is nothing too serious, just a short fight and small winnings.\" \"If you get hurt-\" Tom stood up tall and smiled, \"I shall not get hurt my love,\" and there was a knock on the door, and Tom left to get it. \"It is Eliza!\" He shouted and she came into the room, with a smile on her face. \"Good morning my cousin, I have found a wonderful to store to try our luck at,\" and I smiled and chewed at the same time. When I swallowed I motioned to Tom. \"He is going to the bar to fight this afternoon, and this appears to be Henry's idea. I shall kill him… you realize this?\" Eliza laughed and placed a hand on Tom's shoulder. \"I believe that sounds like Henry, but they are adults now, they can take care of themselves. Now I will leave to wait in the front while you two say your goodbyes,\" and she winked. Tom came and hugged me, \"Have fun, and be safe,\" he kissed my forehead. \"You must be safe Tom! If I come back to you bleeding, I shall never forgive myself for letting you go. \"Of course I will be safe,\" and I gathered my purse, and went to Eliza. The weather was cold against our faces, and the wind cut through our coats. With my gloved hand, I kept my hat firmly on my head. The people walking looked the same as we did, with red noses and flushed cheeks. \"This is the bridal store Jane,\" and I was thankful to be getting out of the chilly London air. There were many elegant dresses and I wrinkled my nose at them. They were too costly and used to much fabric and bright colors. Tom had been generous when he told me to spend how ever much I wanted, but I had been all for wearing my nicest gown, as tradition. \"Just look at this fabric Jane,\" Eliza said with wide eyes. I could tell who was going to enjoy the day, but I did admit, everything was beautiful, but it was not quite what I had wanted. \"This is too much Eliza,\" and she sighed. \"If only you would understand the beauty in the plan and care for a wedding. You and Tom are finally going to be man and wife and you do not even mind how you will appear,\" she motioned to a dark green dress and I nodded my head no, and held up my change purse and shook it. \"Oh Jane, it is your wedding day. Spend the money without a care! Everything shall be alright.\" \"Eliza, that is not true! But the money could be saved, and well spent for another aspect of the wedding. I have mama's old wedding dress which she sent early during my stay in London. I did not tell anyone, for I knew you would have a fit,\" I smiled and she sighed once more. \"Well then we shall go back and have you try it on, but first, the gift for Cassie.\" I had forgotten all about it, and was not sure what to send to her. \"Eliza, I am lost on what to send,\" and she smiled. \"I know just the thing. What about a dress she can wear for your wedding? Something graceful that shows her that you want her to be there with all your heart.\" It was a good idea, but yet… \"It sounds like we are buying her forgiveness.\" \"You do want her there?\" \"With all my heart,\" and I sighed, looking out the store front window understanding Eliza's point. \"Then we must search for an ideal dress, and then go home to try on your mothers.\" It was a good idea, and I suddenly looked at the dresses and pictured my sister wearing one and feeling like a queen, and hoped she would forgive me. We spent hours looking through three stores in total. Eliza tried many on herself, and forced me to try some on, just to make sure I did not want to change my mind and buy a dress. But I loved my mother's dress, and the thought of saving the money. The sky grew gloomy and I knew that we must start to hurry for the walk home would be quite brisk. Then I saw a dress, dark blue in color, stick out slightly. I took it and held it up to me, picturing Cassie wearing it. The blue would make her eyes glisten, and the lovely white lace ribbon that would go underneath the bosom, with another thicker ribbon around the waist. \"Eliza! Eliza, come, look at this dress, I think it is just the thing for Cassie,\" and I held it up. Her eyes scanned over the dress and she stood picturing it on Cassandra. \"It would be perfect for her figure, and the color is wonderful,\" and just like that, the dress was bought, and I had hope. The blustery weather was blowing harder then earlier in the day, and I tied the ribbon of my hat tighter. \"Hold on tight,\" Eliza said as I grabbed her arm. We walked under the soft glow of the lamp lights and shivered. The few people walking along were rushing and holding their caps to their heads. \"Quicker Jane! I can not feel my toes!\" And we rushed as best we could, with the wind cutting through us like a knife. Finally we came around the turn and there was the apartment house. We almost ran as we came to the door and knocked several times. When Tom's man came to the door, I was surprised it was not Tom himself. \"Oh Ms. Austen, Henry has been looking for you all through the day. I myself was here to be in charge if you returned.\" We stepped inside and I untied and took off my hat, with a puzzled expression on my face. \"What is the matter?\" \"Oh Ms. Austen, it is horrible news,\" and Eliza took of her hat, and stood waiting for him to continue. \"Get on with it before we die from curiosity,\" she said and began to take off her coat. \"Shush Eliza; there are appropriate ways to go about asking-\" \"Mr. Lefroy was attacked at the nearby tavern tonight, after he had finished a round of boxing,\" and I stood there, waiting for the joke to finish. \"Jane?\" Eliza asked and I stared ahead. I felt the blood in my body rush to my freezing fingers and toes, and the sting of returning to a warm temperature in my hands and feet, as well as my nose. \"Where is he?\" I asked softly but frantically. Eliza tried to turn me to face her, and then she stopped. \"Where is my Henry?\" \"He is safe and with the master, down at the hospital,\" and she turned to me. \"Jane we must go at once, call a horse and carriage sir!\" He left and, and she put her hat back on and took my hat out of my hands and tied it onto my head. \"Jane! What is the matter with you? Tom was attacked!\" Tom's man came back into the room and he held a crumpled piece of paper. \"I am sorry Ms. Austen, but I believe the messenger told me a detailed description of what I have just said. He had said the Mr. Lefroy was stabbed, stabbed by a man claiming to be shouting that Mr. Lefroy had stolen something very important to him.\" My heart seemed to beat faster and louder in my ears. I dropped the box with Cassie's dress and I sunk to the floor. \"Jane! We must go visit him! Please do not faint!\" And she picked me up and I was frozen in fear. I had warned him that he should not have gone out tonight. I had sensed something was wrong. But who would have hurt my poor Tom? Was this the work of the culprit who was desperately trying to separate Tom and myself? Now the person responsible might be using violence? \"Madame! The carriage is here!\" Suddenly fear engulfed me and I looked around at the darkness outside the front door and into the city, wondering if there was someone watching me at this very moment. Fear filled my body so quickly, that I unfroze and rushed to the carriage that had pulled up to the doorway. I needed to be by Tom's side, I needed to feel safe. Yay! I updated. Thank you to all my readers and reviewers! It means so much, it really does! Another update during the month of January, I hope, and shall try my very best! =) *Women did not wear white wedding dresses until 1840 when Queen Victoria first wore it. The usually wore their best dress, so they would be able to wear it more than once.*[Chapter 13] Hey guys! Thanks for reading! The ride to the hospital was one I would never forget. My heart was pounding as if trying to escape my chest. Eliza held my hand and repeated words over and over but I did not listen. I jumped to the worse conclusions imaginable, and sat frozen with fear. The hospital that we pulled up to was one of the best in London. As we stepped inside, the smell of sickness hung in the air and I felt ready to lose the contents of my stomach. \"Jane, this way,\" Eliza pulled me along and at the entrance there was Henry. \"HENRY!\" Eliza shouted and rushed over to embrace him. \"Come with me, Tom is doing just fine,\" Henry said and leaned down to me wrapping his arms around both Eliza and I. We walked through the hallways feeling the air weigh heavy upon us. When we entered the small dark room, I saw him lying there with eyes closed. I was relieved that he was still here, that he hadn't left me alone. \"Tom,\" I whispered and sat at his side. The hair on his forehead was down with sweat, and spots of dirt made him look miserable. His shirt was caked with blood and grime, and his right leg was wrapped in a white fabric. I took my handkerchief and gently blotted his forehead. The stab was right in his thigh, and I looked at it closely seeing that the blood had stopped gushing and turned some of the white fabric brown. Dirty linens were in a basket near the bed, and most were dark with his dried blood. \"Tom,\" I said again with my voice sounding shaky, hoping that he could hear me. Tom's eyes slowly rolled open and he looked up at me with half a smile. \"You were right,\" he murmured. \"I should not have gone to the tavern,\" he coughed as he laughed. \"No, Tom, no, this is not your fault.\" I looked up at Eliza. Henry sat down on a wooden chair. \"Jane, they gave him medicine to briefly ease the pain. The wound is deep but should heal just fine with a scar. At least that's what the doc said,\" and Henry motioned to the jar with pills. A knock on the door made us turn our heads and a policeman was standing in the doorway. \"I'm hear to take details,\" and Henry gave his account. \"We were at the boxing tavern down the way, when Tom decided to pick a fight with a man. There was laughing and betting, but suddenly a commotion when Tom beat the man. Everyone went to congratulate Tom but he fell to the ground in pain. Women started to scream because there was blood soaking the ground. There was a man who ran off wearing dark clothing and a cap trying to cover his face.\" Henry watched the policeman write down details and nodded when he repeated the scene. It made me stomach feel uneasy and Eliza stood beside me holding my hand. \"We shall let any of you know if we catch him,\" and the man sighed. \"Right before the man stabbed me I heard him say that I stole something important that belonged to him,\" Tom said. \"Oh?\" The policemen said. \"Now Tom think, have you ever stolen in your life?\" Henry said and paced. \"Nothing,\" he mumbled. \"What about your life at court working for your uncle?\" Eliza offered and again it was a no. The candle flickered and the idea of this whole thing left us with little to say. Then it hit me. Hard in the stomach like I had just been punched. I made a small scream and they all looked at me. Tom reached for my hand and asked what was wrong. \"I think I know,\" I looked into his eyes. \"You didn't steal anything because it was already yours.\" His eyes widened with confusion and then became angry. \"Can we be let in on the secret?\" The policeman asked and we turned to him. \"John Warren.\" I mumbled and he wrote down the name. \"He's here in London, and he promised he was not pursuing me any longer. But he saw Tom was back in town.\" \"He must have sent that Irish girl,\" Henry said, now worked up. \"And he lied to you Jane because he knew he'd do all he could to get his way sometime or another,\" Eliza said. The policeman nodded and said that they were going to look for the man and let us know right away and left the room. The tears that had been waiting to come out started to flow. Tom grabbed my hand and pulled me closer down to him. \"I won't let him get away with this. I will do all that it takes to stop him, to find him,\" and his icy blue eyes were fixed on my face. He was incredibly handsome and I felt very lucky in that moment. I didn't want to have to worry about trying to find John Warren, I just wanted to be happily married and safe with Tom. I wanted my sister to have a loving husband, and I wanted my parents to be happy that their children were successful. I wanted my books to be published and bring happiness to young women. I just wanted what I wanted. It became very clear to me that I was tired of having to fight and love. TOM P.O.V. The pain in my leg had faded slowly with the help of the medicine, but was forgotten when Jane had arrived. Her lovely shining face was hovering over my bedside. My thoughts had been focused on her as I was lying in the bed being wrapped up. Henry had called for a policeman and I had waited for my love to arrive. Now that the police had been notified about who we believed it was, I wanted to hurt the man that threatened my life. If it were not for my leg I would have already been on the hunt for him. Not once, but three times John had decided to break up my fiancé and I. This was the last straw, and I was going to let him know. Jane looked down at me and I gazed at her beauty with the need to protect her from harm. Pale skin, soft features, her dark beautiful curls had been down for once and hung about her face in such a lovely manor. I wanted to take her in my arms and hold her, and touch her, and make love to her. But she wanted to wait until we had been married. Naturally I agreed, because I wanted her to be happy. The temptation was growing, this need for her, but I had not said a word. Henry and Eliza were still in the room and I did not want to cause a scene. This medicine was working to suppress pain but I think it was also messing with my head. \"Tom?\" The doctor said and came into the room. \"We can release you now as long as you have someone to take care of you.\" Jane nodded and the doctor told her what she had to do. \"Luckily the wound is not that deep and there should be no problem with recovery.\" \"Thank you,\" I told the doctor and we prepared to return home. As the four of us sat in the carriage, I felt more than a bit of tension. \"This is serious Tom,\" Henry said and I continued to stare out the window. \"He actually attacked you. Was it just to stab you? Or worse?\" \"Henry,\" Eliza nodded toward Jane. \"No, it is important cousin,\" Jane said and sighed. \"I'm afraid to sleep tonight,\" and I grabbed her hand. \"No one is going to come into my home and hurt you. Henry, Eliza, you are welcome to stay the night,\" I offered. \"We shall,\" Eliza said. Once home Henry helped me inside and I sat on the sofa trying to be as manly as I could. This had been an eventful night, and I was happy that I had been able to return back home. Jane sat down next to me and I held her hand. \"My dear,\" how are you?\" She sighed and moved herself closer to me. \"I shall live,\" and she looked at me with tired eyes. \"Of course,\" I said and kissed her hand.[Chapter 14] Hey guys! How are things going? Here is the next chapter! Btw, does anyone know who Cillian Murphy is? What a gorgeous Irish man. Haha, now onto the story! Jane POV The ground was so icy and wet and I could barely open my eyes. Blood dripped down onto the front of my frock and I didn't care. There was Tom, standing in front of me, and I ran to him. Each step I took only separated us further and I screamed out with frustration. \"TOM!\" It was no use, he couldn't hear me and then suddenly I was standing right in front of him. He smiled as blood dripped down his forehead, and I reached up to touch it. But his skin was cold and smooth like glass. Suddenly he burst into millions of little shards and I covered my face. Was I dreaming? I couldn't make sense of anything. If this was a dream then I needed to get out but I was trapped. I held up my hand and it was slowly blowing away like dust. \"Wake up cousin!\" Eliza's voice rang out above me and I opened one eye. \"You're tossing and turning, bound to wake up everyone.\" She stood there in her nightdress holding a flickering candle. I looked around to realize I'd fallen asleep on the couch. \"Its almost dawn, might as well rise,\" she said helping me sit up. \"Eliza, I had the most curious dream.\" \"Did it solve anything?\" \"Solve anything?\" \"This mess with John Warren,\" I looked at her and sighed. \"It's to early for that,\" and I hugged my knees closer to my body. \"Well come on then, you need to change your clothing. It seems that you fell asleep in last nights attire,\" and she had a faint smile. We left to go to our rooms and change, as the men of the house slept. Once we finished getting ready, I met Eliza downstairs at the dining table and the cook brought us a simple breakfast. \"Early for the house to be awake,\" the cook said. I smiled faintly at Robert and nodded. We sat eating in silence when a knock on the door made us uneasy. Robert came back with a letter on a tiny silver platter. \"I feel quite like a man of the house,\" Eliza laughed and took the white envelope off the plate. Eliza looked at it and opened it and I watched her eyes skim over the words. \"It's from Cassie, addressed to us,\" she shrugged and looked up at me. \"It's for their wedding day, and they are inviting us to join them for their… day of happiness,\" she handed me the letter and I read it quickly. \"It's to be next month, back home,\" I told Eliza and she nodded. The rest of the meal was mostly the sound of the silverware on the dishes and the clink of the glasses. \"I'm going to check on Tom,\" and excused myself. \"Why good morning dear sister,\" Henry said as he entered the doorway. \"Don't make a fuss, Tom is coming down to eat.\" \"But-\" \"He can take his pills like the big boy he is,\" and chuckled. \"Dear Robert, what is todays menu?\" \"Eggs and toast with ham, jam if you like, and of course tea and bread sir. Freshly made for yourself and the master. The first batch was for the ladies.\" \"Excellent.\" He sat next to Eliza and kissed her hand gracefully. \"Good morning lovely,\" and Eliza smiled. Tom walked in with a limp and I rushed to his side. \"Good morning champ,\" Henry said as I helped him sit. Robert came out with more food and Eliza and I sat back down as if there was urgent news to discuss. \"How are you my dear,\" Tom said with a smile. It seemed like I was the only one who was dwelling on yesterday's activities. I nodded and he turned to his breakfast. \"Here Henry, a letter from our sister. Her engagement,\" I said in a dreary tone. Henry took the letter and chewed rather loudly as he read it. \"Ah yes, Eliza mentioned our sister was engaged to that bore.\" \"Stop it Henry,\" Eliza warned. \"He proved that he loved her,\" I mumbled, bringing up a glass of water to my lips. \"How so?\" Tom said and looked over at me with his brilliant blue eyes. I paused and then said, \"I paid him a visit on my way back to London,\" Henry chuckled and Eliza just seemed to roll her eyes. \"A personal Jane Austen visit?\" Henry laughed and I tried my best to give him an upset stare. \"Jane if they are engaged then Cassie has her head on her shoulders. It's a grand opportunity for her. There are so few men left in the country,\" he said holding his fork up to his mouth imitating a woman's voice. \"You sound drunk,\" Tom said and Henry ignored him. \"I'm not convinced Cassie loves him,\" I sighed knowing that Henry would not understand my idea of love. Eliza looked up at me and offered a smile, \"Look at its benefits. He is rich to be sure, good land and household, plus a title with worth. Can you not be happy for her?\" I shook my head and she sighed, \"She will learn to love him, Jane,\" she spoke in a motherly tone. \"I believe she may learn to regret it,\" and Tom placed his hand on my own. I decided to stop chatting and stayed silent for the rest of the meal. Once everyone was finished we took seats in the living room, Eliza reading, Henry going over some investments with Tom, and I writing. There was a good amount of light coming into the room and I wrote down a scene I'd been thinking of. The room was quiet with mama lying on the sofa humming a tune. Mary sat in her lonely chair knitting, while Jane sat with her book. \"Look its him! He's come!\" Kitty shouted looking out the window. \"It's Mr. Bingley! With what's his name, the pompous one from before.\" \" Mr. Darcy? Oh my goodness!\" I stopped when Tom sat next to me. \"How are you, love?\" I looked at his leg and he sighed. \"Please, don't worry over me.\" \"How can I not? That man is still out there. I will not rest until he is behind bars!\" I grabbed Tom's hand. \"Or dead,\" Henry said and Eliza tried to ignore her husbands remark but shifted her eyes. \"No, I want him to live behind bars for the rest of his sorry life,\" Tom chuckled and held my hand. \"My dear we are not even sure it is him.\" But I looked at him and I knew that he was unsure. That he wanted to believe it was John Warren as much as I did. \"Though the description seems to fit,\" and he rubbed his leg gently. \"I can't even protect you as well with this damn injury.\" \"Don't,\" I said and grabbed his hand. \"It shall be okay,\" and he smiled, giving me a kiss. Henry coughed on purpose and sat down next to us. \"How romantic,\" he said and batted his eye lashes. I yelled at him to stop acting childish. \"I'm your brother, it is what I do. We shall go after the man and fight him if we must.\" Eliza stood and folded her hands, \"I need some fresh air, Jane?\" I nodded and stood taking her arm. \"We shall only go around the street, no farther.\" Tom held my other hand and kissed it. \"It will be safe,\" Eliza said and we grabbed our coats. The air was fresh and felt wonderful against my face. I had been overheated with the fury boiling under my skin at the idea of Mr. Warren being the one to blame. We held onto each other's arms and walked to the tiny dress shop down the street. Despite it's size it was a favorite of Eliza's and I stayed quiet as she browsed through the latest fashions. \"This one?\" She said as a lady in the store held up a soft red gown with a lace bodice. There was no one else in the shop since it was still quite early. I nodded and she smiled with excitement. \"I'm going to try it on,\" and the lady helped her back into the fitting room. I stood and put down my small purse on the chair, and browsed at hats of different shapes. Some with feathers, some the latest American fashion. Maybe I should buy one for the wedding… I peered down to look at the prices and felt a small gush of wind blow against me. I thought nothing of it and continued to look at the marvelous hats on display. There was a funny one with a huge feather out the top. Wrapped with a pink bow and even had a little fake bird resting on the brim. \"Eliza, look at this!\" I laughed and walked to the fitting room. She stepped out and twirled in her dress. \"It looks wonderful, does it not?\" I nodded my head and smiled. \"You are beautiful cousin,\" and she laughed. \"Here is just the hat to go with it,\" and she giggled louder. \"Is that really what we ladies are wearing today?\" She went to change out of the dress. \"Let's go home or the men might worry.\" I agreed and sat back on my chair, grabbing my bag. As we walked back home we enjoyed the day feeling some peace after last night. We entered the home and heard Tom and Henry talking loudly with other men. Robert took our coats, \"It's for some investments or work,\" he said and I nodded. Eliza left to the drawing room, and I decided to finish my scene for my book. \"Oh Miss Austen? You've dropped a letter from your bag,\" and he handed it to me. A letter? I grabbed it and saw there was no address. Dear Miss Austen, I'm afraid that you know who I am. My plans seemed to have failed though know you are meant to be my wife. I will assure you I shall fix this. If I cannot have you, then Tom will not have you. You have destroyed my life. Tell your friends that I am waiting at the pub. They are sure to know which one. This will be settled once and for all. JW It was him! He's gone mad! I felt faint and weak, and Robert rushed to get Tom. When did he put this in my bag? My blood chilled and I felt violated. He was so close to me. I could not hold on any longer. The room was spinning and I knew I should have eaten more at breakfast. Tom's voice was above me shouting and Henry was somewhere yelling as well. \"Jane!\" \"I'm going to find him now. He must be around here!\" \"No,\" I mumbled, but I couldn't say anything for my mouth felt too dry. Then it was extremely quiet. \"They left Jane!\" Eliza said in a frantic voice. \"They've gone after him!\" ","Summary":" First of all, thanknyou for clicking on my story.

They were when he thought of his father the most, fondly remembering the man who had taught him what had proved to be an invaluable skill and the days during which he had done so. Those had been good times, simpler times when he had been an innocent, happy little kid growing up in Mexico. And surrounded by the skeleton of the Mitchells' shed, alone while Adam Mitchell was out eating lunch with some friends, was a great place to remember those times. Javier smiled, remembering the man who had generally possessed the patience of a saint when dealing with his three sons. As a child, Javier had been an endless chatterbox. It had been his father who had taught him to embrace the calming silence of a day like today instead of trying to add noise to it. The elder Martinez had helped him realize that it was days like today that was the best for spending a day in quiet meditation and maybe even singing, drawing a little bit closer to the God that they both loved. It was his father who had taught him the value of working hard, earning your keep or your paycheck, and giving yourself a real reason to sleep well at night. After a day of hard work, it hadn't taken Javier long to figure out that it was hard to keep your eyes open. And as a teenager that had meant that he hadn't been able to get into trouble like some of his friends had been getting into. At the time, he hadn't really appreciated his father for what he had been trying to teach his son, but now, looking back, he loved him all the more for it.

(5:13) Carmen Martinez smiled as her husband walked into the kitchen after taking his shower. \"Can I have my kiss now?\" he asked with raised eyebrows. She gladly obliged him and when he sat down to eat, Carmen slid into the chair across from him. She bit absently on her thumbnail, watching him. \"What is it?\" Javier asked in concern, seeing her worried gaze. She sighed. \"Nothing really. I... I'm sorry that we fought this morning. And I'm sorry that I doubted that you would find work. And I doubted God, too, I suppose.\" Javi took her hand from across the table. \"It is alright, Carmen, I have already forgiven and forgotten. I felt the same way, but God came through for us, just like he always does. And God forgives us too, you know that. There's no need to worry anymore about it. Everything is good right now, so let's just have a peaceful evening together, since the children are already in bed. How does that sound?\" \"Wonderful,\" Carmen decided. \"Good.\" Javier squeezed her hand and Carmen grinned.

Now if you don't, no dessert after supper, am I clear?\" Marcos skidded to a walk. \"Si, Mama.\" Carmen took a deep breath. \"Good.\" Then she headed into the schoolroom to check on Isabel, who had been having trouble with a reading page the last time Carmen had looked in on her. \"How are you doing in here?\" Carmen asked, leaning over her five-year old's-desk. \"I don't get it!\" Isabel exclaimed impatiently. \"The words don't make sense. It's too hard to learn to read English!\" Carmen crouched beside the desk, settling in for the long haul. \"Why don't you read the words aloud to me?\" Carmen suggested. \"Maybe it will be easier that way.\" \"B-a-t.\" Isabel sounded out slowly. \"B-a-i-t.\" Isabel's eyebrows scrunched together. \"Bay-I-t? What is that?\" \"No,\" Carmen corrected gently. \"The 'I' doesn't make a sound.\" \"So it's like 'bat'?\" \"No, not quite.\" Carmen patiently explained the phonics of the word to her daughter once again. The eyes of both mother and daughter lit up when Isabel triumphantly declared, \"It's 'bait'! I get it now!\" \"Good job, Isabel!\" Carmen declared, giving her a high-five. It was the sparkle in her daughter's eye when she got it that made the work of teaching her children worth the struggle, even though it sometimes required a bottomless well of patience to do it.

She stood shakily to her feet, putting the phone back in its cradle. \" Gracias, Dios .\" She whispered one more time. A smile found its way onto her face, and she doubted that it would ever leave. Right now felt so much different from last night, even from three minutes ago. The fifth chapter of an eleven-chapter endeavor centered around eleven verses in 1 Thessalonians.

Sensing something was amiss, Isabel asked, \"What's wrong, Mommy?\" Carmen bit her lip and looked to Javi for an explanation for the children. Javier took a deep breath and calmly explained to the duo, in terms that they would understand, the situation with Mr. Tyson and the ultimatum that he'd given to their father. Then he said softly, \"Your mama and I would like you to pray with us about it before you both go off to bed. Isabel and Marcos nodded solemnly and the four of them bowed their heads. One by one, all four of them led in prayer, and then Carmen took the two to bed. When she reentered the living room, Javier was on his knees, having resumed praying. With an inaudible sigh, Carmen slid to her knees beside him and took his hand, bowing her head once again. They passed the long night earnestly pleading with their God.

Like the kids, she was growing tired of the fare, but with Javi's work being so hit and miss, it was all that they could afford. \"Isabel, Marcos, time for lunch!\" Carmen called the two of them to the table. Both of them set up whining as soon as they saw what was on the plates. \"I don't want rice and beans again!\" Isabel complained. \"I know, but it is what we have and it is what I put on your plates, so you eat that or you don't eat. Alright?\" Isabel huffed and sat in her chair. Marcos began to dig right in. \"Marcos,\" Carmen reminded. \"Have we prayed over the food yet?\" \"I don't want to thank God for more rice and beans.\" Marcos stated. \"Well then, thank God that you have food at all. If rice and beans is what He wants to give us, then rice and beans is what we thank Him for.\" Now it was Marcos' turn to sigh as the three of them joined hands around the table and closed their eyes.

(5:19) As she leaned against the kitchen counter, Carmen Martinez was struggling, really struggling, to understand. After all that they had already been put through in immigrating to the United States, why would God allow Javier to lose his job – again? Javi had even liked doing the construction work, she knew he had. It had been an okay job money-wise too. So why had God taken it from her husband? They were faithful attendants to the church of which they were members. Javier was a marvelous husband and father. She tried her best as a wife and mother. For being as young as they were, the children were reasonably well-behaved. They tithed of what little money that had. They prayed, they even homeschooled their children so that they could get a Godly foundation in their lives. So why had God taken Javi's job once again? Was she actually supposed to believe one more time that the next job Javi got was going to hold something better for their family? She sighed. Maybe it was true this time around, but sometimes it was really hard to believe that – believing that God would take care of them, that He had a better plan for her family. Was she really supposed to believe that when they barely had any gas in the car and she had next to nothing to feed the kids? In moments like these, the truth was sometimes, especially on days like this one, it was hard not to let the difficulties in her life \"quench… the Spirit\" that she had been given by her LORD. But then again, maybe this time – just maybe – something good would come of all of this. She had to believe so. The eighth chapter of an eleven-chapter endeavor centered around eleven verses in 1 Thessalonians. Reviews make my day; thanks!:)[Chapter 9] Despise not the prophesyings. (5:20) Lunch break was over; it was time to go back to work. Feeling a little depressed, Javier laid aside his Bible, which he had been reading as he ate. He loved God's Word, but some things in it were simply disheartening. Prophesies about the end times – about times that seemed startlingly close to the ones that they were living in today. Javier didn't particularly want to think about those hard times that would come – harder times then even he had ever even known – if not for him, then for his children. He didn't particularly want them to have to go through the things that the Bible talked about. But then again, wasn't that what his job was? To teach them, to get them ready to meet the LORD, so that they wouldn't have to suffer those things? Wasn't that why they all four had a family devotion every night? Wasn't that why he and Carmen had taught the children how to pray? Wasn't that why Isabel and Marcos were being homeschooled for now, so that they could get that good, Godly foundation that they needed? A smile tilted his lips upward as he went back to his job. Maybe he just needed to trust God to move in his children's lives and in the lives of those around the world, and wait and see what happened. The ninth chapter of an eleven-chapter endeavor centered around eleven verses in 1 Thessalonians. Reviews make my day; thanks!:)[Chapter 10] Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. (5:21) Javier blinked in confusion as he watched Adam Mitchell get back in his truck and drive away again. The man must have an appetite as big as an elephant's if he was still hungry! Shrugging off Adam's strange exit, Javier turned back to the work at hand. He wondered, though, what on earth the odd conversation that he'd just had was about. First the other man had gotten out of his truck, a cop's expression firmly in place, and then he had started quizzing him about his name, the job that they were doing together on the shed, and even his kidneys. And just as soon as he had come, he had left, off to get more food. Regardless, though, Javier had meant what he said when he had told Adam how important this job was to him and his family. And apparently whatever Adam had wanted to figure out he had gotten settled. Javier shrugged again. Good for him, he decided, picking up a level. The tenth chapter of an eleven-chapter endeavor centered around eleven verses in 1 Thessalonians. Reviews make my day; thanks!:)[Chapter 11] Abstain from all appearance of evil. (5:22) Maybe it's not wrong; it just looks that way! Carmen's anxious words played through Javier's head for the hundredth time as he tossed and turned in bed. He massaged his forehead and sat up, giving up on the idea of going to sleep. He threw the blankets off and stood up beside the bed, grabbing his Bible off of the nightstand. He made his way into the dining room, flipped on the light over the table, and sat down. He flipped his Bible open and began to read at random. He was so tired though that the words and verses blurred into each other. Until he came to one verse in particular. Abstain from all appearance of evil. The verse jumped vividly off of the page. It was a blunt answer to Carmen's one hope, and admittedly Javier's as well. But something told him that it was really just a confirmation of the answer that he already knew he would give to Mr. Tyson. He would \"abstain from all appearance of evil\" even if it meant that he would lose his job, because in the end, no matter what, that would be better for him and for his family. And then, with his decision consciously made, he could finally go to sleep and be at peace about it all.

However I do own Gem, Honey, and Zeke ECT. Inlook forward to my morning feeding today. I look anxiously out of mynstall. I hear a faint whistling in the distance and it grows loudernand louder until I see a thin man come into the barn lugging a heavynbale of hay. I whinny in delight to the sight of fresh alfalfa hay. nA few whinnies then followed mine. The man's name was David; henthen set the bale down in the corner of the barn. He slowly raisednhimself rubbing his back and wiping the glistening sweat off hisnbalding head. David then cut the strings off the green bale of hay,nand pulls them from the bale. David pulls a flake of hay off thenbale and opens my stall door. He greets me with a soft gentle pet onnmy muzzle. I swiveled my head around his body and reached for thenhay, but he moves the hay out of my reach. David raises his hand andnclucks for me to move. I back up and he sets the hay in my feeder. nOut of the corner of my eye I watch him feed the rest of the horses. nAfter I finish my hay I look around. The mare in the next stall, anbeautiful strawberry roan, greets me with a soft gentle nicker. Innicker back replying to her greeting. I hear footsteps and poke mynhead out of my stall and look to see David, here to give me my worknout. Davidnis the owner of the River Ranch Stables known for their championnjumping horses.

I whinnied in excitement because I wasnready for a good long jumping coarse. \"WhoanGem, I can tell you're excited for your morning workout.\" Althoughnmy full name is Zones Golden Gem everyone called me Gem for short. Davidngently pulled the nose of the halter around my face and brought upnthe detached piece of the halter and brought it around the back of mynears. He latched the two pieces together on the hole that fit mostncomfortable. David led me out of my stall and into the crossties. nDavid then latched the right crosstie and then walked behind me tonlatch the other side. He opened the box, which held curies, smallnbrushes, big brushes, face brushes, soft brushes and stiff brushes. nDavid grabbed a curry and started swiftly brushing me. I love David;nhe is the best owner any horse could ask for! He didn't let thengrooming staff brush me unless he had to let the grooming staff brushnme. I was his personal horse. He always talks to me as he brushesnmy dapple-gray coat, or he would whistle to me.

As henfinished with the curry he grabbed a brush and ran it quickly acrossnmy coat. He the grabbed a hoof pick and loudly clucked for me tonpick up my front left hoof. He quickly picked the rest of my hoovesnthen he pulled out of his coat pocket a few baby carrots. He heldnhis hand out just so I couldn't reach. Then he brought his handncloser and laughed, as he likes to tease me. I crunched on thencarrots. Then he set a purple pad upon my back. David grabbed anblack jumping saddle out of a wooden box made special to protect thisnbeautiful saddle. He then set the saddle on top of the purple pad onnmy back.

He perked up and let out a loud whinny that echoednthrough the barn. \"What'snyour name? I replied Zones Golden Gem. You can call me Gem.\" Henreplied, \"You can call me Zeke.\" \"Okay\"nI replied trying not to sound to anxious. Mynrider got my attention back when he clucked and urged me into thencanter. I had a smooth steady gait. He directed me to a jump, whichnI executed perfectly. I could not get my mind off the new stallion. nHe was gorgeous! He seemed nice. I wanted to get to know himnbetter. I snapped out of my daydream and got ready for another jump.n I jumped it and landed gasping for air. My rider then pulled me downnto a walk for the cool down. Inwalked for about 10 minutes and then David dismounted and rubbed menon the nose and said \"Good work Gem.\" Henled me to the crossties once again and un-tacked me and brushed mynsweaty coat until it shined. He gave me a few carrots a prt on thennose and guided me to my stall. By now everyone was up and aboutnfrom now on you will hear hoof beats, dropping of brushes, rustlingnof hay, and all noise you could think of that would happen in a barn.n I was still thinking of the new horse. I didn't see him. Inwondered if he was going to stay here or not. They day grew longernuntil the orange-golden sunset outside shown through the stalls. Onenof the stable hands walked through for one last checkup beforennightfall. He scratched me on the nose and left the barn. The nightnair was cold and damp, for it started to rain. I awoke to andistressed neigh from one of the stalls. I looked to see Honey annold brood mare. She was one of the finest jumpers we had. But shenwas 19 and had hock problems from jumping. I didn't see anythingnwrong, but I sensed she was in pain. It was dawn and the stable handnwas not here yet to clean stalls. I was worried because I knewnsomething was wrong. I neighed to her \"what is wrong Honey?\" nShe only answered in a painful neigh and then she sighed… Hinthis is my first time on fan fic and this is my first story. I knownit doesn't have anything to do with Hidalgo yet but I am going tonwork it in there. I am only 11 so sorry for spelling errors ect. nThank you for reading my fan fic! I dedicate this story to my horsesnMickey and Jake the best horses ever![Chapter 2] Intried to comfort her all I could but she was in such a terrible pain.nI didn't know what wasnwrong and I couldn't figure it out. Then it dawned on me. She isna brood mare and she has been looking a little stout lately. She wasngoing to have a foal! I was overjoyed for my friend! \"It will benokay Honey,\" I said soothingly \"Hownare you doing?\" \"How is the baby coming along?\" She answerednin relief \"Fine now\" I arced my neck to see through her stall. Insaw a beautiful tri colored paint! \"Oh Honey she is beautiful!\" n\"David will be pleased that it is a filly this time!\" I said allnin a jumble. For I was very amazed for I had never seen a foal beingnborn! Honey answered quite happily \"I know everyone will benpleased!\" \"Oh honey I'm so glad your alright!\" I saidnrelieved. Then I heard Bobs voice talking to Paul. I said to Honeyn\"Finally! They're coming! \"They will be in for a surprise thisnmorning!' I said to Honey. The two men walked in laughing andnjoking around with each other. Paulnsaid suddenly \"Oh my gosh! Bobnsaid worriedly \"What is the matter Paul?\" Paulnraised his eyebrows and said \"Honey must have foaled not even annhour ago because the foal is still wet and is lying on the ground.\" Bobnlooked into the stall exited. \"Bob go get some hay for the mare\"nPaul said orderly. Thentwo men fed all of us. I was expecting David soon to see the foal. nAnd soon enough here comes David to see his prize foal. Honey hadnsuch a good pedigree and couldn't function like she used to so allnshe was used for was brood mare to produce champion foals. David'snface lit up with delight when he saw the tri colored filly. \"OhnHoney she is beautiful\" David said delightfully. I could see henwas glad it was a filly and a bonus that it was a tri colored paint. nThis is his first tri colored paint of his own. He gave Honey ancarrot and gave her a long rub up and down her nose. I whinniednimpatiently for my turn. Then feeling ashamed of myself knowing itnwas Honeys moment with David. David came to me and said \"Okay, okay I'm coming I'm coming.\" Henrubbed me on the nose and gave me a carrot also. \"Are you readynfor your exercise Gem?\" He said lovingly. Inbit at the stall impatiently for my owner to unlatch the door. Hencaught me and led me to the crossties. He groomed me fit for a show.n He tacked me up and led me to the arena. He mounted on me andnclucked for me to go. I loved my exercises. I cantered calm andncollected ready for my jump ahead. He slowed me down counting mynstrides to the jump. I jumped lazily and barely made it over thenjump. Davidnsaid, \"That will just not do.\" Hencircled me back around to the first jump and urged me to a fasternpace. I then jumped it more exited like a jumping horse should looknlike. Hensaid, \"That is better.\" Wenthen finished the coarse that had nine jumps and walked out. Thisnday I was happy for my cool down. We were working extra hard becausenthere was a big show coming up and we were to travel to Tennessee fornthe worldwide show. Since we lived in Maryland it was quite a drive.n This show in Tennessee will be my first big show. He brushed mynlathered body and fed me apple slices. He walked me to my stall andngave me one last pet. As he was walking away Bob came up and startednto talk to David and I over heard. \"HeynDavid can I talk to you for a minute?\" Bob asked \"Wellnsure Bob what do you need?\" David said questioningly \"Younknow that new horse Zeke?\" Bob said \"Wellnyeah Christy Alice used my indoor to work him, what about him?\"nDavid replied \"Anman named Kyle Sanders came up to me and asked if we were boarding atnout stables\" Bob said \"Didnyou tell him we would be more then welcome if he boarded here?\"nDavid asked \"YesnI did and he brought in Zeke that stallion Christy was working,\"nBob said \"Well what is wrong with that?\" David questioned \"Wellnnothing naturally, but I looked into Zeke's pedigree which was verynhard to find and traced Zeke back to Hidalgo the famous brown andnwhite paint.\" Bob continued \"Hidalgonis Zeke's Grandfather, that is why Zeke has the coloring he does.\" \"WownBob good work, if we could get our hands on the son of Hidalgon(Zeke's Father) we could train him and be known worldwide!\" Davidnsaid exited \"BobnI need you to do some serious searching okay?\" \"Yesnboss right away!\" If Indidn't know any better I think I could hear the greed in David'snvoice. That didn't seem like David at all! Maybe David isn'tnthe person I thought he was! I was so appalled when the men left,nbut I thought that Zeke would probably enjoy seeing his father. Inwoke up early in the morning and right away looked to see the newnfoal. The filly and the mother were sleeping peacefully in thencorner of the box stall. A few hours pasted and I was finishing upnmy hay that Bob gave to me shortly after I woke up. Bob and Davidnwere coming down the barn isle with grain buckets in there arms. nThey said: \"HeynDavid I got some more background on Zeke and I got a few pages on hisnfather.\" Bob said cheerfully \"Goodnwork Bob.\" Inwatched Bob hand the papers over to David and David skimmed overnthem. \"nSo Zeke's Fathers name is Ohio Peppy Bar, and Zeke's registerednname is Zeke's old Peppy Bar.\" David said softly to himself \"Sonwhat is Hidalgo's registered name?\" David questioned \"Itncouldn't be recovered sir.\" Bob said slowly \"Andnall these horses do is long distance racing.\" David said madly \"Thisnwon't do at all.\" David kept repeating Inwas so furious that David would act like this! I was so mad I kickednmy stall. Bob and David looked at me startled a bit by the suddennnoise I made. \"Bob go get Paul and tell him to call Christy Alice,nher number is on the wall and to tell her that she needs to come andnwork Gem today that I will pay her.\" \"And when you get back Inwant you to brush Gem until she shines!\" He said sternly \"I amngoing to do more research seeing you can't follow simpleninstructions!\" David stormed off out of the barn and into his home.n A few minutes later, Bob came back to catch me and brush me fornChristy Alice. He grabbed my halter off the door and swung the stallndoor open. We both were mad! I reared up; you don't want to messnwith a mare on the verge! \"Whoa Gem, it's alright.\" Bob saidnsoothingly I still fought Bob every step, making him work to get mento the crossties. He finally dragged me to the crossties and got menhooked up. I kicked and kicked. I wasn't used to anyone but Davidnto catch me and groom me. I just wanted to go to David and kick himnin the face and snap him back to reality, and to stop being songreedy. That was what was wrong with him he was money greedy! Thenonly thing he was thinking about was getting Zeke's father! Ifnyou have any idea's please contact me! Go through fanfiction or Inwon't read the e-mail. Thanknyou for reading Chapter 2. Please review! Thank you[Chapter 3] Christy came to the barn right away. By the time she got here I was brushed my hooves were picked and the saddle was tightened to ride. Christy walked me to the indoor, mounted on my back and clucked for me to walk. I was very down and grumpy. I was choppy and off balanced today. We cantered for a while then David came into the indoor. \"Christy I got it from here, I will still pay you.\" \"Okay but she seems off today.\" \"That's alright I will cheer her up.\" Christy dismounted and David mounted on my back. He kicked me to go and then I started to gallop trying desperately to throw him to the dirt. I bucked and reared like a wild bronco! He pulled my head around so hard I got a shooting pain from my shoulder to my head. My neck got it the worst. He kicked my but until I couldn't spin around anymore. He said \"What is the matter with you Gem?\" Only if I could talk! I thought in my head He kicked me hard in the sides because he still had a touch of anger in him. I tried harder to move and walk better because I didn't want to get beaten again, even though I kind of deserved it. I cantered faster then usual and he had to keep slowing me down. He got off me and said \"I'm probably not going to take you to the big show in Tennessee if you're going to perform so poorly.\" I was mad at David but I wanted to go to the show so badly I told myself I would act better then usual, even though in my heart and in my mind I wanted to kick the crap out of him! I experienced many different feelings . I felt mad because I didn't like how David has been acting but I felt sadness and sorrow for Zeke because he doesn't know what is going on and he doesn't know how desperately David wants to get his father for all the wrong reasons. But most of all I felt guilt, I couldn't tell Zeke even if I could because it would break his heart to know that David wants to get his father for money. I didn't know what I was going to do. And on top of all that I have to suck up to David just so I could go to the big show. Right when I thought that in my head I repeated it. I was greedy, I don't have to suck up to David but I am because I want to go to the big show in Tennessee that made me even greedier then David! Right when I thought that I pulled back on David as he was leading me. In my head I thought Zeke I'm sorry I can't tell you about what David is planning to do but at least I won't be greedy with him! I pulled back in a jerk and jerked the rains right out of his hands. I galloped the other direction looking for and opening to run out of. I saw a tiny opening where David was standing; it would be a tight squeeze but I was willing to try it. I galloped full speed right in David's direction, I pushed on harder and David bailed out of the way seeing he was not going to be able to stop me. I charged through the opening and I looked down to see cement I tried my hardest to stop before the cement but I was too late. I skidded on the cement and couldn't hold my balance and went tumbling on my side. Shooting pains went up on down my front left leg, and a burning sensation on my left side. I lie there in pain, thinking to myself \"Why would I do this?\" \"This isn't worth it!\" David came rushing to my aid. It was like he was his old self again, the loving caring person that would do anything for his horses. I missed that David, I was happy a moment to see him so loving towards me. He rushed to the barn phone and dialed a number. I assumed the vet because I was in no condition to travel. He talked loving words and stroked my right side that was not injured. \"It's going to be alright Gem.\" He said lovingly \"What got into you Gem?\" He questioned He ran and got some treats and fed them to me trying to comfort me. Ten minutes later the vet arrived at our barn. She didn't want to get me up right away incase of any broken bones. \"Can I assist in any way Dr.Patty?\" David questioned to the vet. \"Well there is one thing, do you have running water in your barn?\" The vet questioned \"Yes I will get some water right away!\" David said I was in terrible pain. My left foreleg felt like it was on fire! And shooting pains went up and down it with the fire. The Doctor touched my left foreleg and I neighed for that leg was in excruciating pain. As David returned with the water she told him what she had just discovered. She went to her truck and pulled out a bunch of supplies. She put on a lead suit as did David and she put this big machine by my injured leg. It took pictures of my leg and she put the X-Ray Machine down. She said I had a broken leg and had to have surgery. As I heard the news I thought, \"How am I going to go to the show?\" \"What am I going to do now that I have a broken leg?\" All these questions popped into my head. To Be Continued… Sorry for the short chapter. I am still trying to think of how my story is going to go. Please contact me thru fan fic for your ideas I need some ideas for the story! I am running out of good ones. Thx please review![Chapter 4] I dedicate this story to Kals Gal that is my only reader other then my sister. Thx for your support Kals Gal! As I was thinking a sharp object got stuck through my skin and injected a liquid. I slowly started to get sleepy. I got so drowsy I…had…to…put…my…head…down. Hmmm…. A snotty mare hissed. The mare's name is Star's Big Bucks. Other people call her Star but because I hated her so I called her Big Butt mocking her name. (Story being told by Star from now on) \"She's out like a light\" David remarked \"Now we will have to move her manually.\" The doctor said \"Okay I will help you.\" David said \"1,2,3 up\" The two people counted then groaned at her heavy weight \"We are going to take her to the truck and set her in it okay?\" \"Yup\" David said \"And drop her.\" Said the vet And she went down like a sack of potatoes. The car zoomed off with David and Dr. Patty in it. They arrived at the vet's clinic and once again carried the heavy horse inside the building and set her down on a large tall table made out of steel and covered with a sheet because it was sanitary for the other horses who also had to use this table for there operations. \"Now what we are going to have to do is a long incision on her leg and we will have to put staples in her bones to connect the bone. If the bone is too broken up in the leg we will have to remove the shattered parts but the hard thing about that is we will have to be careful because if we're not we could harm the legs tendon and that will be another big problem.\" \"Lets just hope that the leg isn't to banged up.\" You are going to have to leave; I have people to assist me in the prosejer. \"Okay I will be waiting for your call in the barn.\" David said and then left. To Be Continued... I know this chapter is REALLY REALLY short but I wanted to focus on the surgery then get to the story again, plus I don't have a lot of great idea's so PLEASE send me some good ideas. I appreciate all your help Kal's Gal![Chapter 5] David said and then left after returning, David paced and pacednaround the barn, murmuring words you couldn't understand. 3nhours later Davidnwas sitting in a chair in the barn his head tilted back and his mouthnslightly opened for he was asleep. The phone rang and he jerked hisnhead up, he rubbed the back of his head for a moment and stood up. nHe walked sleepily to the phone and answered it. \"Hello\"nDavid said in his telephone voice \"Yesnmay I speak to David this is Dr.Patty\" The vet said \"Younare speaking to him,\" David said \"Younmay come to the clinic now, all of her legs are fine just a few minorncuts and skids the other leg that was clearly broken is in goodnshape it was a clean broken bone.\" \"There were no shatterednpieces.\" The vet continued \"Wenstapled the bone together and her left side had bad abrasions to thenskin.\" Dr. Patty continued with more news \"Thenleft side was so bad it cut right through to her backbone so we willnhave to keep her here for a few weeks to heal that so she doesn'tnhurt her back.\" \"She was a very lucky horse because she couldnhave broken her back very easily, she landed just so that she didn'tnbreak her back.\" Dr. Patty said \"Inwill be there in a few minutes to see her.\" David said (Storynbeing told by Gem) Ohnno! If I stay here for that long will I miss the show in Tennessee? nI didn't know when it was coming up so I had no idea if I was goingnto miss it or not. David arrived at the clinic and he came to menright away. He said, \"How long will it be again?\" \"Itnwill be about three weeks.\" Dr. Patty said sympathetically \"Wellndo you think she will be in shape to perform?\" David questioned \"Wellnit will be about 3 weeks before she will be able to load in a trailernand be exercised.\" \"So you could probably be cantering in about anlittle bit over a month.\" Dr Patty explained \"Ohnwonderful! David exclaimed \"Arenyou looking forward to something?\" Dr. patty asked \"YesnI was looking forward to taking her to a show in Tennessee.\" Davidnsaid \"Itnwill be in the middle of next month and I wanted to take her to thenshow.\" David was explaining \"nDo you think that her mobility will be the same?\" David asked \"Ohnyes she will be her normal self.\" Dr. Patty answered \"Inam so happy that she will be alright by the time to go to the show!\"nDavid Exclaimed \"Inthink you should be happier that your horse is alright.\" Dr. Pattynsaid with disappointment in her voice \"Ohnyou are right, I guess I got all caught up in the show that I wasnhoping to take Gem.\" David said blushing \"NownI think that you should get home and get a little rest and come backntomorrow to see Gem, she will be fine in the staff and my care.\"nDr. Patty said \"OhnI believe you I think you will take great care of her.\" David said Davidngave me a rub on the nose and left the clinic. As he opened the doornI let out a gentle nicker. Insaid, \"I'm sorry David, I didn't mean to charge at you.\" Indon't know how but somehow I think he knew what I said. He came tonme and rubbed my face again and left. I heard his old pick up trucknstart up and it's old engine pulse on and off until it warmed upnand he sped off to the barn that I missed so. I missed my box stall,nI miss the hoof beats going across the isle and most of all I missednmy friends. I couldn't see Honey's baby for a month! I willnmiss the most crucial part of the filly's life. As the days turnedninto weeks and the weeks turned into a month I was jigging around innmy stall at the clinic. I overheard that David was going to pick menup this afternoon and I couldn't wait to see him. My leg was anlittle stiff but with exercise I was it will get back to normal. Incould support my own weight and I got put on a special diet to helpnthe healing process. The scabbing on my left side was starting tonpeel off, there was going to be a good sized scar on my side but allnI was thinking about was seeing David at the moment. David arrivednat the clinic in half an hour. I let out a loud whinny greeting him.n He said \"GemnI am glad to see you too!\" Henopened the stall door and attached a lead to the halter that wasnalready fastened on my elegant head. He led me out of the stall andnDr. Patty opened the door to go outside. But before she opened thendoor she gave me a pat on the forehead and said I hope those scabsnfall off soon. When she opened the door the sun blinded me for anmoment until my eyes adjusted to the bright sunlight. Dr. Pattynopened the trailer door and I loaded up like a natural. David wasnsurprised because I hadn't been in a trailer for a month. We drovenfor about 20 minutes then we slowed down until we were stopped andnDavid's truck turned off. He backed me out of the trailer and lednme to the barn. As I walked in all of the horses neighed in delight.n The only one who knew was Big Butt and I'm sure that she didn'tntell anyone what had happened. I was put in my stall that had freshnhay and water waiting for me. Soon after I was done I got put outnwith all the mares in the pasture. All day I had mares coming up tonme asking what had happened. I told the story to every one of themnthat came up to me. And each one of them were astonished that Insurvived. I munched on grass until the blue sky started to turnnorange and red. Bob came out to gather all of the mares. He gave anloud whistle and all mares stopped what they were doing and broughtnup their heads to see what the noise was. When the mares saw it wasnBob they all trotted to him. Bob opened up the gate to the barn andnall the mares trotted into their stalls. This was a daily routine sonevery mare knew her stall. Bob fed every horse in the barn and left.n It was nightfall so the crickets were chirping and the stars werenshowing. I asked Honey who was in front of my stall, \"Whatnhappened to the paint stallion Zeke?\" I asked \"Wellnthere was a rift between David and Zeke because Zeke didn'tncooperate with the jumping.\" Honey continued with more \"SonDavid said he didn't want Zeke anymore and put him in the paper tonsell.\" \"Guessnhow much he wants for Zeke.\" Honey questioned me \"WellnI guess $2,500?\" I asked \"Trynadding another zero on that.\" Honey said \"WHAT!nHe wants 25,000 for Zeke!\" \"Yesnhe fudged it and said Zeke was the son of Hidalgo so he could getnmore money for him.\" Honey said \"Atnthat moment I couldn't believe it again! David is such a liar!\" Insaid \"Inknow and another thing David got his hands on the real son of Hidalgonand he is being shipped here from Australia.\" Honey said \"Andnanother reason he is charging so much for Zeke is that he is payingn100,000 dollars for Hidalgo's son.\" Honey said \"Nonway!\" I said \"Way.\"nHoney said back to me \"Indon't know the son of Hidalgo's name is but I do know David isnpaying some big doe for this horse.\" Honey said \"Wellnhe is going to have to be shipped over the sea then he will have tonbe hauled for a long ways to get here.\" I said to Honey Instepped back into my stall and kept thinking about all I just heard. A/N:nI am running out of ideas. Thx for reading please Review! Thx again![Chapter 6] Insoon fell asleep, my head tucked away by my barrel. You could barelynsee me because my dapple-gray coat blended in with the Black sky withnthe white stars making a gray affect on me. I woke up and it wasnbright outside. I perked up and looked into Honey's stall. Thenfilly looked like a different horse. She was so big, way bigger thennI remembered her to be. For the last time I saw her she was justnborn, her tiny hooves and her fluffy short mane and tail. I wasnwaiting and waiting for my work out with David but he never showednand never showed and it was becoming afternoon. I heard a strangenhorse neigh. I poked my head out of my stall to see what all thencommotion was. A strange huge trailer pulled into the River Ranchndriveway. I suspected the son of Hidalgo. I then became sickenednagain, remembering what Honey had said to me the other night. But Inwas curious what he looked like and what his name was. Then Davidncame out of the house to greet the person and thank him for the longndrive that he drove. I heard them talking this is what they said; \"HeynChuck I want to thank you for taking Ezra all this way for me.\" n\"Here is your pay.\" David said Davidnhanded Chuck a huge wad of cash EZRA!nThat is a mare's name! And sure enough they backed out a Buckskinnpaint mare. I couldn't believe my eyes! I thought Honey said thatnit was the SON of Hidalgo not the DAUGHTER of Hidalgo. She was builtnlike a Brick house, her mussels very distinct and big. Her coat wasnshiny and beautiful. Her white was as clean as you could get it. nThe Buckskin color was very bold and creamy, and what made it allnwere her black stockings. Her butt was huge! I envied her, so verynmuch. And I was afraid that she would take my place because Davidnwas so close to her already even though she just got here. Henstroked her as he would to me. He handed the man a check, but now Indidn't know if I would believe Honey on how much he paid for her. nI thought about Zeke then, I wondered if he was sold or not. Inwondered where he was staying. I wondered if he was staying here. Inwanted to talk to him so much. I didn't know him very well but Inthought he was sweet in a way. I then saw Chuck go with the hugentrailer behind his truck. David came through our barn with the marennext to him. He looked happy and proud leading the muscular marenbedside him. And wouldn't you know it, he put the mare to thenright of my stall. He turned her around in the stall and let her go.n He shut the door behind him. And rubbed Ezra on the nose and leftnthe barn not even acknowledging that I was here. I was so mad! Inlooked over in here stall, she must have been 16 2\"! Hello shensaid when she caught me staring at her. ´\"Hi\" I said innreply. \"Whatnis your name?\" Ezra asked me \"Inam Zones Golden Gem, but you came call me Gem.\" I replied \"Inam Ezra's flight of gold because I am a golden color, you can callnme Ezra though.\" She said very sweetly \"Okay,nI think we could be good friends\" I said trying my hardest to soundnlike I meant the last part. But then I thought in my head that shenis nice and she never did anything to me so why should I be mean tonher? I shouldn't I thought, I can't be mean to her even though Inwas a little jealous. But jealous of what I thought in my head? Inam mad at David again and I don't know my feelings anymore. Davidnis pulling me along, making me feel like I can't feel! I wishednthat someone, anyone could understand me. Feel the way that I havenbeen feeling. But I don't think I am going to fine that person. Inknow that I love David, but then again if you love someone shouldn'tnyou be happy to see that person? And lately I haven't been happynto see him. Then when I was thinking about everything Ezra said \"Younlook a little troubled, do you need help with anything?\" \"Well,nye… no, I don't know I just have a lot on my mind lately.\" Insaid stupidly \"Wellnif you need someone to talk to you could talk to me.\" Ezra saidnsympathetically \"Inreally don't want to bore you with all this crap that has been onnmy mind.\" I said hoping she would say no you could talk to me,nbecause I really needed someone to talk to. \"Indon't care you can tell me, I know that I just got here and all butnI really haven't talked to anyone but you.\" Ezra said \"Well,nyou know I got in a big accident and I just got here from the vetnyesterday and now David has a new favorite and I don't know what tondo and I like someone but they are going away but I haven't reallyntalked to him and I don't know anything anymore and \"Whoa,nwhoa hold on you have an lot on your mind.\" Ezra said \"OhnI am sorry tell me about yourself.\" I said a little embarrassednbecause I trailed on like a lunatic. \"Ohnno it's alright I just wanted you to slow down a little because Incouldn't understand you.\" Ezra said \"WellnI would like to know a little about you anyway.\" I said \"Younwant to know a little about me?\" Ezra questioned \"Yeah\"nI said exited \"Ifnyou really want to know.\" She said (Storynbeing told by Ezra) Thencolor of my mother is buckskin and as you know my father was thenfamous Hidalgo. I got weaned from my mother and the next day after Inwas weaned I was shipped off to buyers because they were paying a lotnof money for me. After I got to my new home I was so scared! When Indidn't know what to do they whipped me and I got more confused andnthen they whipped me again. I was at that place for about one year. nThe people who hurt me got sent away for animal abuse, and then I gotnsent to a place where they didn't care about me at all. They rarelynfed me and I was in a huge pasture with about sixty horses so when wengot fed there was barely anything for me to even chew on, I was therenfor about 6 months then I just got sent here. I am right now almostntwo. I am happy I can talk to someone about all that I went through. \"OhnI am so sorry Ezra!\" I said shocked that anyone could do that to anhorse! (Storynbeing told by Gem) Insaid that I was sleepy but I really wasn't I was just trying tonavoid an awkward situation. So Inbacked up in my stall and pretended to fall asleep and eventuallyndid. I woke up in the middle of the night and looked around to seenif anyone was awake. When I poked my head out I heard Psstt…Psstt…na little louder. I looked over to the right and I saw Ezra was thenperson trying to get my attention. In my head I said CRAP! I didn'tnwant to talk to her now because I didn't know what to say to hernafter knowing what had happened to her. \"Yesnwhat do you need?\" I said in a whisper \"Injust saw you were awake and was wondering what was going on.\" Ezransaid \"Wellnnot much I was just seeing if anyone else was awake.\" I said \"WellnI am awake.\" Ezra replied \"YeahnI see you are.\" I said not really knowing what I should talk about. \"Ifnyou don't mind how old are you?\" Ezra questioned \"Indon't mind at all I am three years old.\" I answered \"Ohnreally you seem younger.\" Ezra said \"Ohnhow sweet of you to say that!\" I said surprised \"WellnI should get to sleep before the sun comes up.\" Ezra said to me \"OkaynI will try to do the same.\" I said \"Okayngood night Gem\" Ezra said \"Goodnnight Ezra\" I replied Thxnfor reading my story! Please review![Chapter 7] I woke up early in the morning. Although it was early there was still hustle and bustle throughout the barn. It was about daybreak when I was done eating and was all settled down. I was especially sore this morning my side hurts so badly! I flexed my head around to see the left side of my barrel. When I looked there was yellow goop all around and on my scraped side. It looked like the scabs were reopening because there was an infection under them. That is why my side and back hurts so much! I was going to wait for David to help me, I knew he was going to come and check on me this morning. I waited a few minutes and finally David came to me. He opened the stall door and said \"How are you doing this morning Gem?\" He rubbed my head and walked over to my left side. \"Oh my gosh!\" \"What happened here?\" He examined the puss on my side. He then said \"I will be right back girl.\" I waited a few minutes and then saw David coming out of the tack room with a bunch of things in his arms. \"Here we go\" David said when he neared to me. \"This may sting\" David said A clear liquid that was cold got poured on my left side all over. It burned and stung so I kept moving my butt away from the cold liquid. \"Easy girl easy it will be over soon.\" I waited and finally he was done with that cold liquid he called alcohol. He then took a white cloth that was wet and pulled the entire puss away and threw the gross towels out. He put more alcohol on and that was the part I didn't like and moved away like last time. But he kept on squirting it on me until I stood still. He then stroked me and left. I thought. \"What about my work out?\" \"I thought I was going to get a work out!\" But then about ten minutes later I had to eat my words because David was coming back for me. He grabbed my halter and caught me. He brushed my right side good and brushed around my reopened scabs and picked all four feet. He then put the lunge line on my halter and led me to the outdoor arena. As we walked out there the sky was clear blue sky not a cloud in it. It was warm around 75 degrees. We got to the out door arena and he started to lunge me on the lunge line. We walked for a good 15 minutes in the circle but he would reverse me every once in a while. After that He asked for a trot. I trotted very stiff. I felt like I couldn't move like I used to. After I trotted for 15 minutes I felt a little better. I could move almost like I used to but my left fore leg was starting to hurt after half an hour. So I started to limp a little but tried to keep pushing on. Pains started to go up my fore leg until David noticed and slowed me back down to the walk. That felt better. As David was exercising me Bob came up to him. Bob said \"How is she doing David?\" \"She is doing fine.\" David replied \"The doctor told me that the rehabilitation will take about a few weeks then we will be able to canter her.\" David continued to talk to Bob \"And Dr. Patty said that she should be herself and jumping by the show in Tennessee.\" \"I was hoping I could take her to that show.\" David finished I just walked around feeling happy that I was getting some attention from my owner that I loved and hated and didn't know how I felt about him but I knew that I did love David some where in my heart. He looked at my butt and I swung it around so I was facing David. He unhooked the lunge line rope and hooked on the regular lead rope and led me to the cross ties. He brushed me clean and led me to my stall and backed me in it. \"You did a good job Gem.\" He stroked me on the shoulder and closed the door with a boom. The barn was eerily silent; I was wondering why the barn was so silent. Ten minutes went by and not a foot stepped into the barn. I looked at Ezra and said \"Do you know what is going on Ezra?\" \"No I don't, do you think it is weirdly silent too?\" \"Well I don't think that anyone got hurt, did you hear that someone got hurt?\" \"OH! I almost forgot, I heard from Honey that Star got taken in to the clinic because she coliced this morning in the pasture.\" \"Really, Big Butt deserved it!\" \"Big Butt! That is hilarious!\" \"Oh she is a rotten pile of horse manure!\" Ezra was still laughing from Big Butt and her she only added to her laughter when I said that. \"What do you have against her?\" Ezra said when she calmed down \"Well when I was a filly just three weeks old I was exploring the pasture and saw her with a group of fillies and got the courage to go over there and talk to them. Although I was thinking of talking to them for the past week so this was a big deal when I finally got the courage up to talk to them. I walked over there and I was so nervous that when I got close enough for them to see me they busted out laughing and I got close enough to ask them what they were laughing about Big Butt stepped a hoof forward and said we are laughing at you! I was almost in tears when I said in a high sheepish voice why are you laughing at me? She walked even closer to me and laughed even louder and said girls tell her why we are laughing at her all of the other fillies said that I walked funny and I was weird looking. Right when she said that I bursted into tears and ran away to my mom. About a month later I got up the courage to go to them again. I walked to them and Big Butt said what do you think you are doing here crane legs! I said first of all Big Butt (that was how the name Big Butt was born) don't call me crane legs Big Butt interrupted and who is stopping me! I wasn't done finishing Big Butt! You are a stuck up filly that thinks you are cool and you are just a bully! I think I made my point! As I was walking away all the fillies that were around her followed me, the fillies were Honey who you know is a very good friend of mine, Co Co and Brown Sugar. They are my very good friends. Then I heard some foot steps and hoof beats on the ground the first thing I've heard in half an hour I poked my head out of my stall and opened my eyes widely \"Oh my gosh, Ezra look!\" I hope you like this chapter! I know sudden ending but I want people to be on the edge of their computer chair! LoL please review![Chapter 8] A/N nI am going to try to make this chapter a long one because I know hownmuch viewers like long chapters. I hope you like it! \"Ezranlook!\" I said \"Looknat what?\" Ezra questioned \"Thisnhorse that is coming thru!\" \"Ohnmy god!\" Ezra said slowly and astonishingly \"Whatnis the matter Ezra?\" \"Oh,na… nothing I'll tell you later.\" \"Thatnis Zeke!\" Gem sighed a romantic sigh \"Ohnyour stallion friend!\" \"SHHHH…nhe's not my stallion friend!\" \"Ohnlet me clarify, you wish he was your stallion friend. Haaaa!\" \"Shutnup!\" \"HinZeke\" Gem said \"HinGem they decided not to sell me and I am going to stay here!\" \"Reallynthat is great!\" \"Yeah,nI am going to stay in the stall next to yours!\" \"That'sngood, we could catch up on things.\" Stupid,nStupid, Stupid! Rightnwhen Zeke got put into his stall David came to give me a light worknout. NonNo, No! I thought in my head. But I was right David came and gotnme out of my stall. David groomed me and picked my hooves and we wentnto the out door arena to lunge again. Inwalked and trotted for a while then we were done and are going to thenbarn again. I didn't care much for my workouts because they werenthe same boring thing every day. But I still liked that David wasnstill going to take me to the show, I wanted to go to that show sonbad. The thing that was on my mind this workout was that they werengoing to keep Zeke. David was done brushing me and we were going tonmy stall. Right when I got put in my stall Zeke was getting takennout for his workout. Missed him by a hair! I said in mynhead. I was going to take a bite of hay when Ezra started to talk tonme. She said \"Gemnyou know how I was acting kind of weird when Zeke came through.\" \"YeahnI remember.\" \"Well…nthe truth is…\" \"Spitnit out Ezra you know you can tell me anything.\" \"Okay,nZeke is my son.\" \"Holdnon\" Gem said \"Inguess I never really thought of it but Zeke is your son, youncan't be two or three years old!\" \"Howncould I be so stupid, how could I have not figured it out myself!\" \"Inwas going to tell you but I lied about my age, I am six years old.\" \"Inhad Zeke when I was five years and a few months.\" \"Whynwould you have to lie about your age Ezra?\" \"Well,nI wanted you to like me and to think of me as a friend not like anmother figure or anything, I'm sorry\" \"Thatnis alright Ezra, I still think you are a cool mare!\" \"ThanksnGem\" \"Sonwho is the father of Zeke?\" \"Thenstallion's name is Peanut, he had no relation to Hidalgo of coarsenand he was the same color as me.\" \"Thatnis kind of weird that he still got the color of Hidalgo even thoughnboth of his parents were the same color.\" AsnEzra and I were talking David was walking back with Zeke. \"HinZeke, how was your workout with David?\" \"Itnwas good, but I am not being trained by David anymore, I am beingntrained by a man named Jack.\" \"Henis a long distance racer and he is going to train me and run racesnwith me, unlike my grandfather I'm not going to go to the ArabiannDesert or anything I am just going to race locally.\" \"Thatnis cool you can do what you want to do, and don't have to be forcednto jump!\" \"Yeah,nI am glad of that!\" \"Well,nnice seeing you!\" Anothernstupid thing! Inbacked into my stall and started to munch on hay. Then all of ansudden Big Butt came to mind I wondered if she really coliced. Instill think that if she did colic she deserved it. So I asked Honey \"Younheard that Big Butt got hurt?\" \"Yeahnthis morning she coliced.\" \"Huh,noh well she deserved it.\" \"YeahnI think she did too.\" Inlooked around and it was starting to get dark. I looked at Zeke andnthen backed into my stall and fell asleep. Inwoke up to Bob looking me right in the face. I opened my eyes andnthey adjusted and I was startled and jerked my head and backed up. \"Whoangirl!\" \"Indidn't know you were afraid of my face, that is an insult!\" Hensaid sarcastically. He chuckled and rubbed me on the face. \"Itnis about time, there is hay and water fresh in your stall.\" Inwas really a mess and had to just stand for a minute and digestneverything that just happened. I looked around and Zeke wasn't innhis stall, where did he go? Inquestioned myself, I looked to the other side and Ezra was there andnawake, \"Hownare you Ezra?\" \"Good,nif your wondering where Zeke is he went out for his workout already.\" Inlooked out of my stall anxiously searching for David. I whinniednwhen I saw David come out of his little neat house, but he wasnwalking with something I saw it was a brown package. He walked intonthe barn isle and stopped to rest the ob-long shaped package on hisnknee, standing at a funny stance. He ripped the box edges away fromnthe tape and un-folded the sides, He took out a… but Bob saidnsomething and right when he was about to take it out he rested itnback into its secure position and turned around quickly and ran tonBob's aid. I looked and saw Bob directing a trailer into outndriveway. I watched until the trailer halted and the trailers backndoor swung open and Big Butt backed out. \"WellnI'll be.\" Insaid accidentally out loud. \"HeynHoney, Big Butts back.\" \"Huh,nI guess she lived!\" BignButt came through the isle and backed into her stall. I thennremembered the package that David had in his arms. I wondered if henwas going to come back with it, I really wanted to know what he gotnin the mail. I thought I saw a horse symbol on the package and if Inwas correct the package was from State Line Tack, a horse website youncan buy all kinds of horse items on. He also got a catalogue fromnthem through the mail. Anfew hours passed of silence and dusk settled on the little horsenbarn. I grew tired and backed into the darkness of my stall and fellninto a deep slumber. I rested for hours and woke up around 5:00 a.m.nthe stable boy had just arrived to clean our stalls and give us ournmorning feeding. I stepped to the font of my stall and peered intonHoneys stall. Honey was dozing off with her hind leg cocked and hernfoul was curled up in the corner next to her fast asleep. Honey wasnstill aware I could tell because as a noise echoed through the barnnher ears flicked back and forth to assure there was no danger to harmnher filly. Her filly was almost two months old and was as sweet asncould be. The little foul yawned gracefully then shut her mouth andnre situated her small head into a different position. After thenstable boy finished feeding everybody, I ate and waited a few hoursnfor my workout. I longed for something new in my workouts. It hasnbeen long enough and I think I should be able to have a rider on now.n David came and gently rubbed my forehead and caught me with my samenblue nylon halter. He was done brushing me and brought out my samenpurple pad and my beautiful jumping saddle out of the special madenwooden box and set them both in the right order on my back. I was sonhappy I jigged around when David was trying to put my saddle on. \"WhoanGem, I see you are happy we are going to start riding again.\" Inwas happy! After he put the saddle on and tightened the girth tightnenough to ride he brought out that ob-long shaped box out of the tacknroom and carefully took something out of it. It was rapped withnbubble rap. He took the bubble rap off and the object was ancompletely new Black bridle. The leather is new and pliable I was sonexited! I wondered if I was going to go to the show in Tennesseenwith this new bridle that matched my saddle perfectly. H took thenhalter off my face and stood by my left side and caressed my neck tonmake sure I wouldn't run away. But I was happy and wasn't goingnto do that. I opened my mouth and the silver colored bit slid up tonthe back of my teeth and rested in the blank spot of gum. He pullednup the strap under my cheek and fastened it tight. Then he fastenednthe strap under my muzzle. I loved the feel of this bridle. So newnand comfortable! We walked into the indoor and David mounted on mynback. I performed at top quality. I wanted to show David I was goodnto ride. I was happy and content and could do this forever. But allngod things must come to an end. All we did today was walk and trotnbut I was still happy. He walked me to the crossties and un-tackednme and took my beautiful bridle off. He quickly put the halter onnand fastened it. I got brushed and my feet were checked once more. nI got put back in my stall and Zeke was there now. I turned to Ezra. \"HeynEzra, are you awake?\" \"Yes,nwhat do you need Gem?\" \"Oh…nothing…..\" \"Therenis something I have to tell you, that I may have not told you when wenmet…\" \"WhatnEzra?\" \"Well,nIt is secretive and I lied to you… again.\" \"What?\" A/N:n I know this was kind of a weak cliffhanger but I don't have goodnIdeas and I tell all reviewers of my story PLEASE send some ideasnthat you would like me to put in my story because I really don'tnknow where I am going with this so far, please help me out this is mynfirst story on Fanfic. Thank you please review! And I guess I didn'tnreally hold my promise this chapter wasn't very long![Chapter 9] A/N:nHey, I didn't really get any reviews on that last chapter so Inthink this one might be a little short because I am running a littlenshort on ideas. Well I'll give er a go anyways! I hope you like! Inlooked at Ezra astonished \"Whatndo you mean you lied to me…again?\" \"Well,nI may not have lied really, I left out a part.\" \"Oh,nwell fill me in then.\" \"Well,nI really didn't lie that was a bad choice of words on my part.\" \"Itnis a little embarrassing and no one knows about it, not even David.\" \"Tellnme already Ezra!\" I said impatiently \"Wellnwhen I was back at my old barn I got put with a stallion for awhile,nand I…I…have a foal Gem!\" \"What!nthat is great Ezra!\" I said so happily \"Donyou know you have a champion foal in your stomach!\" \"Inam not as happy as you\" \"Whynnot Ezra?\" \"WellnI really didn't want or expect a foal.\" Ezra said a little guilty \"Nonone knew I had a foal in my stomach when David bought me, I didn'tneven know.\" \"Oh,nwell I guess that I kind of understand that you weren't reallynexpecting it but what's done is done and you can't take it backnnow, so you will have to have the foal and life will still go on.\"nI said as if I was older then Ezra \"Thanksnfor still wanting to be my friend and thank you for all yournsupport.\" \"Inwill be supporting you the whole time till the birth!\" \"Thanknyou so much Gem!\" Innuzzled Ezra on the cheek and backed into my stall waiting for Davidnto come. I was very hyper because the show in Tennessee was the daynafter tomorrow! I knew I was going to have a light but strenuousnworkout. David came rushing to me I didn't know why he was in suchna hurry. Instead of taking me to the crossties he brought me to thenwash stall as started to brush me hard and fast and then brought outnthe hose to wash me. I thought in my head why is he washing me? Inthought we were going to have a nice workout then I could be put backninto stall! But that didn't happen. I got bathed until Inshined then David led me outside and let me graze as I dried. AfternI was dried enough he put my show sheet on and let me out in thenpasture. I watched him load up the back of the truck with suppliesnlike brushes and saddles and he also loaded up the dressing room withntack and show apparel. He was working hard and fast and when he wasndone he went into the house and came out with bottled water and foodnin a cooler. Then I heard him shout to Bob \"Thenshow got moved back an hour so I need to get going in about 30nminutes and that isn't a lot of time for me and my daughter to getnready for the show.\" David said with the sun directly on hisnbaldhead sweat dripping down. \"Inalso need you to grab Whiskers my daughters horse and bath and groomnhim and make sure you get his white spots very clean!\" \"Inalso need you when you are done with Whiskers to put his sheet on andnload him in the trailer.\" \"ThennI need you to call Pat and tell him he needs to get down here rightnaway and catch Nickel and bath him and groom him and put his sheet onnand load him, then I will load Gem in the trailer and we will be offnto Tennessee!\" You got all that? David questioned \"Yesnsir, it will be done within the half hour!\" Bob said with a lowndeep voice Inwatched as everyone scurried around getting this and getting that andnloading him and doing this. I ate a few last bites then I heardnDavid coming to catch me. \"Herenis our big day Gem.\" \"Inknow I trained you well.\" Innuzzled his chest and walked along his side to the trailer. I stoodnnext to Whiskers, David's daughter's horse Emily. Emily stood onnthe wheel of the trailer and rubbed all out noses and ran to thentruck and got in. Emily was twelve years old, she did show jumpingnlike her Dad but her Mom died when she was eight years old. She wasnhappy with her Father though she missed her Mother very much. Shenwas a bouncy little kid with long blonde hair and only about fivenfeet tall. She was short but she knew her stuff about show jumpingnand knew a great deal about horses. I suddenly felt the trailer movenwith a slight soft jolt. I had to regain my balance then I was fine.n Almost the whole way I talked to Whiskers but I ate hay the rest ofnthe time. It was going to be a two-day trip. Every hour or so Davidnwould stop and lunge up in an open area so we could stretch our legsnand refill out hay nets. Finally we got to the show. I couldn'tnexplain all I saw, Horses we everywhere! You couldn't throw an oatnwithout hitting one. There was commotion all around, people goingninto classes with their horses and people coming out of classes, itnwas so hectic! But I loved it! This is what I was born to do! Ingot put in a big box stall with fresh hay and water. I got put nextnto Whiskers because David knew that we got along next to each other. nI was happy that I would be able to talk to someone I liked andnshared interests in. I couldn't wait; my class was tomorrow atn9:00a.m. And I was hyper! But with all the commotion time flew andnbefore I knew it, it was morning and almost time for my class. nWhiskers and I got taken out of out stalls at the same time. Davidnbrushed me for at least twenty minutes and I got my hooves cleanednand polished with a black polish that stood out on my dapple-grayncoat. My gray tail and mane got brushed out so well you could run anfine-toothed comb through it without hitting a single knot. My facenwas brushed to perfection and baby powder was put on the whitenmarkings on my face. Last minute sheers were run on my bottom and topnlip to cut off all of the stray hairs left on my face. My forelocknwas smooth and shiny. My white fluffy English show pad was put uponnmy back then my Black English jumping saddle was sat on top of that. nI was exited and rearing to go! David then took out the new Blacknbridle that he had bought on the Internet and put the bit in mynmouth. I closed my eyes as he slid the leather piece behind my earsnand fastened all the buckles. He mounted on my back and rode me tonthe warm up ring. I walked calm and collected trying to looknperfect. I extended to a long floating trot and held my same pace asnlong as my owner asked. I loved my job and I was honored to be atnthis show. Finally my class was up and I walked to the starting gatenand waited for the people to open it. I was the first one in thenring but I had to wait as everyone gathered in a strait line ofnhorses and riders, the best of the best of horses and champion ridersnknown for their expertise in horse jumping were here and I have tonshow all of them I am just as good if not better! I was actually verynnervous I wanted to do my best in this show. The first part of mynclass was the jumping then I was to do a normal walk-trot-canter atnthe end of the class. They called my name and my riders name and wenwere the first to go when I felt my rider slide his right foot backnand touch my side gently and lean forward. I went from the walknstrait to the canter and collected myself readying for the firstnjump. The jump was made of big white barrels laid on their side; Inhad never seen barrels on there side before. But I got ready for thenjump with no fears anyway. I arced my neck and curled my front legsntogether and pushed off with my powerful haunches, I jumped it and onnthe landing the jump was so high that my butt was higher then my headnbut I held my balance the whole way and as I landed on the ground Incollected myself once more to my beautiful long canter as if I didn'tnhave any extra force making me go faster, even though I had a greatndeal of it. I cantered the pattern and turned a sharp corner Davidnslowing me back down so I wouldn't collapse on the turn. I came upnto a jump with painted rails; I once again curled my forelegsntogether as one and executed the jump with such gracefulness. Inexecuted the last three with such ease, as I cantered back to thenrail that would soon be the line up I swung my butt around to startnthe line that would follow after me. After all of the horses jumpednthe jumping coarse and were in the line up the announcer announced Walknyour horses please walk! My rider touched my sides with hisnheel and we begun to walk. After we walked for a short amount ofntime the announcer announced Trotnyour horses please trot! The announcer bellowed Mynrider gently tapped my sides with his heels and leaned a tad bitnforward and that was my cue to move up one gait. We were tracking tonthe left so my rider rose when my right leg extended forward. Mynhead was tilted in an elegant look, and gave a collected feel of thenhorse, and my legs floated with ease. Then the announcer called out Canternyour horses please canter! As my rider heard that his rightnleg moved back a little bit and touched my side as well leaningnforward. I then knew that meant canter. I calmed myself and led offnwith my left foreleg with my powerful haunches collecting themselvesnbehind me. I felt very calm and peaceful even though there werenpeople shouting and cheering off the sidelines. As I heard thenannouncer say Walknyour horses please walk! Infelt my rider change seat position and relaxed deep into the saddlenand I walked to that cue. When the announcer called out to reversenDavid turned me around in a circle and continued at a walk. The samenthing happened but instead of cantering on the left lead and risingnto my right foreleg it was reversed. My class was over and all of thenhorses lined up facing the judge that held her arms out showing thenexhibitors which way to face. I stood still and waited for my turnnto back up. The judge stepped in front of me and asked David \"Couldnyou please back your horse?\" Davidnlooked behind him which will earn him extra brownie points becausenwhen you are on your horse you should always make sure you won'tnback into anyone before you actually back up so David looked behindnhim then leaned forward slightly which was totally unnoticeable tonthe eye but I could feel his seat position changed then he lightlynpulled the reins that I felt on the bit and backed up (Just so storynreaders know this all happens at once not in steps like I explain Injust want to be detailed in my chapters and I just want people tonknow all this happens in one second) \"ThanknYou\" the judge said briefly and walked to the next person. Afterneveryone in the line up backed up for the judge the placings werencalled off. First Place goes to… Zones Golden Gem and ridernDavid Jones Whennthey called off David's name and my name David cantered me to thengate where we received our first place trophy. David dismountednright away and rubbed me all over for a job well done. I got walkednto the truck and trailer; first he let me take a long cool drink ofnwater then he tied me to the trailer and took my tack off and brushednmy sweaty body and gave me new hay in my hay net. I settled down atenmy hay and waited, as the sky grew dark. And Emily came back withnWhiskers and a first place trophy in her hand. She was so happy! Shentook care of her horse and loaded him in the trailer. David was notnfar behind her to load me in the trailer. Finally we arrived at ournbarn. I got put in my stall immediately and I fell asleep just asnquickly. A/N:nWhat do you think guys? I hope you like that my chapter was a littlenlonger then what I usually make them. Do you think I was detailednenough? How did you like the show part of my chapter? Was thatndetailed enough? Do you think it had enough action? What do younthink of Ezra's secret? Please review! Thank you for reading mynchapter![Chapter 10] I know it took me long enough to write another chapter right? Sorry I have been really busy but I am going to try to post more often. I would love all of the reviewer's ideas for how my story goes. I want to warn everyone that there is a scary but not too explicate killing scene so please squeamish people do not read that scene. I hope you like this chapter! I groggily opened my eyes. They had let me sleep in today because of my hard workout yesterday. There was fresh water and hay in my stall already, I was happy to see that. As I was munching on my hay I heard David talking to a strange man, a man I have never seen before. They were talking about hauling instructions. But whom were they hauling? I looked over to Honey's stall to ask her because she was the gossip mare of the barn; she was bound to know what was going on. Honey wasn't in her stall. No, could it be honey that is going to be hauled somewhere else? I looked around the barn frantically, not my best friend, who has always been there for me…always until now. When I looked into her stall the shavings were all bloody. I listened to David carefully hoping to understand what had happened. This is what David was saying: \"I came out immediately when one of the stable hands came rushing to my house door. He said that Honey had been slaughtered right in her stall.\" I looked at the truck that was parked a ways up. I made out the words \"Mink Ranch\" Now I understood, the mink ranch is a place where the pick up any dead animal or a animal that had to be put down and fed the carcass to the mink. It was an awful thing I thought. I listened as David said more about what happened \"So I came out and it was true, Honey one of my best brood mares was slaughtered in her stall. It was a bloody mess. Her throat was cut and there was an X mark on her left shoulder. I don't know what it means but I am sure scared for all of my prize horses.\" \"I have seen another case like this with an X on the shoulder I didn't understand it\" the truck driver said \"Well I have to clean up the barn, Good Bye.\" David said \"I am sorry for your loss, if you are anything like me my horses are like family to me.\" The truck driver stated \"Yes I do.\" David replied So at that the truck driver drove off with my best friend in it. I cried, Honey was such a good friend and I didn't even get to say goodbye. A tear ran down my face followed by more. I couldn't control it. As I was crying I thought, what am I going to do, there is someone out there and I have no protection. What is the person that did this to Honey comes back. How come I didn't hear Honey? It's like he was so quiet about it and, This makes no sense! She would have kicked and screamed, that makes no sense at all. And he couldn't have slaughtered her then brung her back to her stall. I am so confused! I just feel like I want to back into a corner and be safe forever. I dreaded the thought of the night that was to come hours away. I stood in my stall motionless, I felt like I was a floating nothing like this I felt as the hours passed. No thought passed through my brain until I looked outside and the sun had set. Did David not care about his horses? I looked into the big-bricked house that was lit up with many lights like a Christmas tree. I saw Emily sitting looking out the window, in my direction. I looked closer and studied her small delicate face. She was crying, I assumed for the horse that she had started out on when she was young. Just gone with no goodbye, sorrow, grief and anxiety filled the barn. Every horse feared there lives tonight and every night. It was pitch-black now and my eyes were opened wide. I looked over into the house again and Emily's room light was on and she was looking out the window with heavy eyes. David walked into her room and spoke to her. Telling her soothing words I am guessing. He slowly laid her down into her bed and he light turned off. I kept my eyes open wide; I heard a twig break in the driveway. I spun myself around in the direction of the noise and waited. My heart was pounding the speed of light and my sides heaved because of my breathing. Then all of a sudden a raccoon ran across the path. I let my guard down a little but still skimmed over the barn every second. My eyes slowly started to close then I sprung them back open. You can't fall asleep Gem. You have to watch over the barn! I thought in my head. My eyes slowly closed once more a few minutes later then I woke up in the morning. What happened! I fell asleep again! I looked around frantically I looked at the driveway and the Mink Ranch truck sat out there at the end of the driveway. NO! If I had only stayed up later I would have caught him! Who got slaughtered! I looked into each stall and I didn't see any stall that was… I saw a spot of red in the corner of my eye and looked down a bloodstain was in my stall! Who… OH NO! I hope you liked this chapter I know it is short but I just quickly whipped it up. And sorry I didn't put the killing scene in this one but it will be in the next chapter. I know Honey dying was sad but I have a whole bunch of ideas now so please review! Thank you for reading![Chapter 11] A/N: I hope you liked the last chapter and once again the killing scene is in this chapter but it isn't horribly bad. I hope you like this one! I looked at the bloodstain then I examined my body, I had nothing no cuts or bruises then I peered into the stall to my right and the stall shavings were soaked with blood! There was so much blood it started to run in my stall. Who was in my stall last… Ezra. NO! It isn't Ezra it can't be! Tears were running down my face. It can't be her it just can't. My voice was crackly and stuffy. It felt like I died inside. She was my friend, the only one who really listened to me. My heart was in my throat a hollow sad heart that I thought could never be repaired. In my head I repeated one line over and over again. \"It can't be her it just can't\" I backed into a corner in my stall. My face was stained with salty tears. I felt like nothing. The same feeling ran through my body of when Honey died. \"I saw what happened\" an anonymous voice behind me stated. \"What?\" I turned around to see Spit Fire a new horse David had bought a few weeks ago. \"What are you talking about.\" I said shielding my face away from him hoping he wouldn't see the tears.\" \"Do you want the entire story Gem?\" \"It is a horrible thing and I don't know if you would want to hear it.\" Spit fire said \"Tell me Spit Fire I need to know the whole thing.\" I said quickly \"This is how it started: Paul the stable hand came through with grain and gave everyone grain. David told Paul to give me the Athlete grain so I could perform better the next day and it would help my joints. Paul gave me the regular Strategy grain so I didn't eat it. And I saw you started getting sleepy and I wasn't getting tired at all. Did you notice any different taste to your grain Gem?\" \"No I didn't notice any difference.\" I replied \"Well I think Paul put something in all the horses grain to make them tired. So they wouldn't wake up when he was slaughtering his next victim!\" Spit Fire said dramatically which didn't help matters at all \"Oh my gosh, you are…are right.\" \"How could Paul do this!\" \"Tell me what you saw, did you see anything?\" I said rather quickly \"I was just getting there I tried to wake you up but you wouldn't move so I tried to wake up Ezra and she didn't move so I watched and waited and Paul came in the barn with a machete in his right hand he opened Ezra's stall abruptly and raised the machete high in the air and with all his strength he blasted it down through Ezra's neck like a hot knife through butter, then her carved an X on Ezra's shoulder then he started to slice her into pieces for his amusement I guess. He is a sick sick man. And I am sorry you lost your best friend.\" Spit Fire stated It seemed like Spit Fire had no emotion but I examined his face and a tear ran down his strawberry roan coat. I cried right in front of him I wasn't ashamed, if a stallion will cry right in front of a mare he has courage any other stallion I know would hide his face and be ashamed. I couldn't believe just like that Ezra is, gone. I turned around and looked out of my stall the mink ranch truck was driving away once again with my best friend in the back of it. David came in by me and held a treat to my face I couldn't eat at a time like this so I pushed my face into his chest and held it there taking in the moment of being safe and content. David always made me feel better now what? Who am I going to talk to when I need it or someone to get the best gossip from and most of all where am I going to get another best friend like Ezra and Honey? The day moved like molasses I felt useless and sad. Then something happened that had only happened that once before. Spit Fire said \"Hey Gem ah… um… how are you doing?\" I turned around and looked at him with a weird look. \"You want to know how I am doing?\" I said astonished \"Um yeah what is wrong with that?\" Spit Fire said \"Nothing I just thought, well never mind I am doing alright.\" I said \"Well, um yeah that is good.\" \"That is good right?\" Spit Fire said \"Yeah it is good.\" I said giggling at the end and then turned around. Wow I didn't think I would ever even smile again! Then it seemed like Spit Fire made everything okay and he seemed to be the only thing on my mind. A/N: I hoped you liked this one! Lots of drama huh? I know my slaughter scene really crapped out, I was hoping to have something scary in my story but it didn't work. But now you have to see what happens! EW Yay so much idea's! I can't wait to post again![Chapter 12] A/N: If you didn't see my post in the review page I decided to start back up on fanfic! It has been 2 years and I think this post is well overdue xD lol so I hope you like this chapter! More killing scenes you ask? Read and find out! I was standing relaxed with my back foot cocked and I thought where is Zeke? So much drama has been going on in the barn I forgot about Zeke! I haven't seen him since before the show! I turned around and asked Spit Fire \"Where is Zeke?\" I asked \"Oh a huh what?\" Gem didn't notice that Spit Fire had been dozing off \"What happened to Zeke?\" \"Oh David knew that Zeke enjoyed long distance running more then jumping like Hidalgo so David sold him to the trainer that had been training Zeke because they were bonding so well. \"I almost forgot but he told Honey something to tell you but Honey died before she could tell you.\" Spit Fire explained I will never know what Zeke wanted to tell me it died with Honey. I looked over and looked at Honeys foal she was big enough to be weaned and I wondered. Does Honey's baby know what Zeke said? \"Excuse me uh…\" I just had noticed I didn't know the name of Honey's baby \"Sorry I don't know your name, you see I was a friend of your mom.\" I said sweetly \"You knew my mom?\" The foal asked \"Yes I did we were good friends, what is your name sweetie?\" I asked \"I am Painted Dove but you can call me Dove, and your name?\" Dove asked (A/N: Just so there is no mistake Dove like the bird and Dove like she dove into the water it is spelled the same way so I mean Dove the bird) I just loved her little foal voice! It was so cute! \"I am Zones Golden Gem, you can call me Gem.\" I said \"Well Hi Gem!\" she said \"I actually had a question for you Dove.\" \"Shoot\" Dove said \"Did your mom by chance tell you something that a friend of mine told her to tell me?\" I asked \"No I don't think so.\" \"Oh\" I said disappointed \"Nice to meet you\" Gem said \"Nice to meet you too\" Dove said back I turned around very disappointed I really wanted to know what he wanted to tell me but I will never know because he is gone. I sat in my stall depressed and without hope. I wondered if he wanted to tell me he loved me or if he liked someone else or if he just wanted to say good bye but it really boiled down to curiosity. I wish I could see him one last time but he could be in Iraq for all I know! Zeke's POV I was standing in my stall. Waiting for Jack to come and get me. I wonder if Honey remembered to tell Gem that I will miss her very much and that we would be having a baby. Well it is a big thing. She would have told her. Zeke's attention was directed towards the door when he heard the door handle jiggle. Sure enough Jack came thru with a red halter in his hands. \"Hey boy, how have you been?\" Jack said softly This is Jacks first horse he has bought on his own. It was exciting for him. He put the halter over Zeke's nose and led him out of his stall. He tied him up and brushed his sleek coat until it gleamed. \"We are going to start out on the trails so you are used to riding around without a fence around you. Then we can start on our gallop and stamina.\" I am so excited to start out on the trails. I haven't been able to ride where I want without any limits or boundaries. He put on a heavy foreign saddle on my back. It was long and had a…a stick looking thing in the front. He called it a \"western\" saddle and it was quite a bit heavier. The girth was not a girth anymore… it is now called a cinch. Hmm… this is interesting. Jack walked Zeke outside into the warm sunlight. It was refreshing and reminded him of his mother; warm and bright and loving. He couldn't wait to see Ezra again. Jack mounted his back and they started on a trail through the woods. There were hills so big he had to gallop as hard as he could to get up it and on the way down there was no way stopping him. He was going to fast he couldn't stop himself! He had to swim through water. Which Jack had a challenge to get him to do. What if it swallows me and I never come back? What if something in their try's to eat me?? Zeke thought as he stood in front of the lake. \"Come on boy!\" \"You can do this!\" Jack urged Finally I decided if I get eaten it is your fault! Not mine. So I went through the water and came out alive. We circled around and went back to the barn. Galloping most of the way. I just miss Gem. Zeke thought. She is going to have my foal and I am not going to be there. A/N: I know this is kind of a short chapter but it is just something to start concluding my story. I hope you guys liked it! I know childish story kind of but I started when I was 11. –shrugs- what can ya do? Lol please review xD haven't gotten one in a while!

Some memories, though, remain so sharp that they could have happened yesterday. Others have even grown sharper with time. Those are the ones that I want to tell you about. It's a hard story, both to tell and to hear, but it is being repeated so frequently in our nation today that I feel it needs to be told. I want to warn others before they head down the road that I was on. After all, not many stories like mine have as happy an ending as mine does. Tiny prologue, I know, but please tell me what you think and stay tuned for the next chapter! I'll probably post chapters of this in between chapters of my Criminal Minds/iCarly crossover, When Things Happen. Thanks!:)[Chapter 2] I've always placed the beginning of the story at my sixteenth birthday. Now, let the record show, I was already anything but the golden child at this point. I had a boyfriend of which my mother did not approve – he's currently serving time for all sorts of theft, drug, and domestic violence related charges. I had let my grades slide to a nearly dangerous degree, and to top it all off, I was doing drugs. The only thing that I was addicted to at that time, though, was the nicotine that I got through smoking, not that I support that at all anymore. Here's the thing, for their sixteenth birthdays, most girls want cars, shopping sprees, etc. I was not one of those girls. Me? I just wanted to see my dad again. Of course, this is what I had wished for on every birthday since he had left my mother and I, which meant for the past eight years. I was turning sixteen this year, though, and that was a big deal, right? I was determined that this year was going to be the year that he finally came to see me again. My mother had tried long and hard to prepare me for the worst – or the inevitable, however you care to think about it, since it's the same thing in this case – but I was fiercely loyal. It can be easy to be loyal to someone you haven't seen in half of your life and have chosen to remember up to that point as being tantamount to a superhero. If you want to remain loyal to them, that is. And I did want to, desperately, foolishly so. It was a crushing blow when he didn't show up that day for my party, or at all. He couldn't even be bothered to call me, it seemed. My self-esteem hit rock bottom that night. I had stayed awake late, just knowing that he was going to call me. It was my sixteenth birthday, after all; he just had to contact me today. I can still remember as clear as day rolling over in my bed and checking the time on my alarm clock. My eyes focused on the glaring numbers just in time for me to see them turn from 11:59 pm to 12:00 am. And that was when it first hit me just how little he now cared for me. I was heartbroken. In fully acknowledging what I had truly known for a very long time, I felt deeply hurt - wounded, abandoned, and even betrayed by the man that I had wanted so badly to be able to trust, believe in, and count on to somehow manage to be there for me. It was then that I realized that for the past eight years, he hadn't been there for me, not once, and the only thing that I could count on from him was disappointment. But I knew of someone who wouldn't disappoint me, someone who I thought at the time really loved me. My boyfriend. So without another thought, I snuck out of the house and stumbled a couple of streets down to his place. I knocked softly on his bedroom window, shivering because of the light drizzle coming down and crying because of an entirely different reason. He didn't seem too happy to have had me interrupt his beauty sleep, but he let me in nonetheless. It was only once I was inside, away from the rain, that he noticed that I was crying. \"What's wrong, babe?\" he had asked, pulling me close. I had breathed deeply, taking in his scent of nicotine and cheap, knock-off cologne, then coughed and made a fruitless attempt at wiping my eyes before I spilled out my story from in between my sobs. I told him how my father hadn't called, had probably forgotten my birthday entirely, and didn't even love me. Here my boyfriend, Matthew, had seen a chance to score some points and make another go at what he had been after for awhile. \"But I love you,\" Matthew had reassured me tenderly. \"I just wish that you'd let me show you how much.\" I had kissed boys before - after all, it seemed like everyone kissed when they were in a relationship, so that made it okay, right? - but I had never let it go beyond that first base with any boy before. That night, though, I had been too exhausted, emotionally, mentally, and physically, to fight him on it, and I just let it happen. The story gets better, I promise! Please tell me what you think and stay tuned for the next chapter! Thanks! I'll probably post chapters of this in between chapters of my Criminal Minds/iCarly crossover, \"When Things Happen,\" or at least that's the plan, even if I seem to have developed a bad habit of not sticking to it.:)[Chapter 3] Matthew and I didn't last long after that, but that was okay, I knew that there were plenty of other fish in the sea. I learned quickly that giving myself away physically often got me more attention and longer relationships then when I hadn't been willing to do so. I didn't let myself pay any attention to the fact that the type of guys my new tactics got me were more often than not of an indecent sort. And this was the attitude with which I approached my freshman year at Valdosta State University and my fellow student, athlete David Thomson. Everyone on the school campus at least knew who he was, although before the party that changed both of our lives forever I couldn't have told you whether or not he knew my name or if I was just another one of the cheerleaders to him. But by the morning following the party, he knew me in ways that had nothing to do with my moniker. I don't remember much about that night exactly – like I said before, alcohol has a way of helping with that, and I was definitely drunk – but I do remember the lights. Someone had managed to find a strobe light and string it up, adding to the already wild atmosphere. Because of the lights, David was bathed in a blue glow of sorts when he approached me. I can't really recall what he said to me or how it happened exactly, and I probably wouldn't want to even if I could remember. All I know for absolute certain about that night with him is that it did happen, and it changed both of our lives forever. The story gets better, I promise! Please tell me what you think and stay tuned for the next chapter! Thanks! And, you know what? For the record, I think that we all might as well abolish the plan that I had for updates.:)[Chapter 4] For weeks after that night, I didn't think a thing in the world about it. I summed up my sudden, frequent bouts of vomiting up to an extra-log-lasting flu bug and other obvious signs of my condition up to the stress and hectic lifestyle of college living, and I went on my way. Two months into my \"flu bug\" though, my college roommate, Kasey, was worried for me. Knowing my reputation with boys as she did, she saw my sickness for the pregnancy that it was and gave me an ultimatum: I took a pregnancy test on my own, or she dragged me to the nearest OB/GYN. I decided to save ourselves the gas money and doctor's bills and take the test, which I had already convinced myself was going to be negative even before I took it. But it wasn't negative. It was positive. A tiny, pink plus sign that was going to ruin my life, or so I thought. And even though my thoughts and emotions had been well and truly scrambled during those minutes that I had sat on the bathroom floor frozen by shock, I can still remember having the most irrational thought at that moment. The plus sign didn't match the rest of the bathroom. The tile floor had been white. The sink had been white. The toilet, shower, and shower curtain had all been white. Even the socks that I had been wearing and the test that I had been holding were white. But that little, pink plus sign just threw everything off. The story gets better, I promise! Please tell me what you think and stay tuned for the next chapter! Thanks! And, you know what? For the record, I think that I can say that most of these chapters are going to be drabble-sized.:)[Chapter 5] Kasey is as blunt and sensible as anyone ever was, yet she cares about her friends deeply too. I think that this knowledge of her personality was part of what made me dread telling her the outcome of the test. But as I sat there on the cold, hard bathroom floor and stared at that little, pink symbol, I knew that she was just on the other side of the closed door, waiting for the information that I didn't want to give her. I had realized then that there would be no getting anything around her. So I had thrown away the test, grappled my way onto my feet, and opened the bathroom door, walking straight past Kasey to flop face-down onto my bed. \"So?\" she'd asked anxiously. I had mumbled the answer into my pillow, knowing that she wouldn't be able to understand what I was saying. Blunt as ever, she had guessed, \"You're pregnant?\" Still unable to make myself look at my friend's face, I had turned onto my back, pulled the pillow over my head, and nodded. Up until then I had been numb, like I was in a fog, but with that admission came the lifting of the fog. I had begun to cry, and then sob outright, as I realized what I had gotten myself into. Kasey had held me close in a long, almost motherly hug and whispered reassurances to me as if I were a child. Once we were both sure that I was cried out for then, Kasey had released mea and I had crawled under the covers of my bed and pulled them over my head, ready to hide from the world until this especially difficult problem went away. Kasey had stayed sitting on the edge of my bed and silence had prevailed for a few minutes before she had asked crisply, \"So, who's dying, you or the baby?\" At this disturbing question, I had flung the covers back from off of my face and sat up, asking, \"What?\" She had repeated the question, then explained carefully, \"You're going to have to give something up, Amanda, whether it's your plans that you have f0r college… or your baby's life. I'll help you any way that I can, but I don't know that it's feasible to continue all of the courses that you have going and raise a baby. That's just too much for anyone to deal with, even with help.\" I had thought about this for a long minute before deciding, \"I don't need to make a decision just yet. I need to talk to David first.\" \"David?\" Kasey had asked with a raised eyebrow. \"Who's he?\" \"You know, David Thomson. The athlete guy.\" Kasey had put her head in her hands. \"He's the father?\" I'd nodded, made even more nervous about the situation because of Kasey's despairing expression. \"Do you want me to come with you?\" she'd asked. I'd shaken my head and swung my legs around off of the bed, standing up and grabbing my shoes. \"I'll be fine.\" And I had been naive enough to believe what I'd said. As I had walked across campus, Kasey's words had kept playing through my head. So, who's dying, you or the baby? You're going to have to give something up, Amanda, whether it's your plans that you have f0r college… or your baby's life. The way that she'd said it had made it seem like getting an abortion would be committing a murder, and though I knew nothing else at that point, I knew that I couldn't become a murderer. I knew that the baby would be born. The story gets better, I promise! Please tell me what you think and stay tuned for the next chapter! Thanks! And, you know what? For the record, I think that I can say that most of these chapters are going to be drabble-sized (under 500 words).:)[Chapter 6] When I had arrived at the door of David's dorm room, I was shaking I was so nervous. After all, I didn't really know anything about this guy. I did not know the father of my child. I had taken a deep breath to fortify myself and then knocked on the door. David's roommate, I would learn later that his name was John, had opened the door. \"Hey…\" I could tell that he was trying to place me, but we had never met before, so he was out of luck. Eventually he settled for asking, \"Do you need something?\" \"Is David here? I need to talk to him.\" I had been surprised at the steadiness of my own voice; after all, I was falling apart on the inside. \"Yeah, sure.\" John had motioned me inside, calling out, \"David, there's a cheerleader here to see you.\" I had wondered for a split second how he had known that I was a cheerleader, then I had remembered that I had put my hair up using the ribbons that the cheerleaders were given as a part of their uniform. David had peered around the corner to see who his visitor was. Recognition had flared in his eyes and he'd given John a look that had asked him to leave. I had swallowed nervously as John had tipped an imaginary hat to me and said \"I guess I'll leave you kids to it\" as he'd backed out the door. The door had closed soundly behind him, loud in the suddenly silent apartment. The silence itself had become deafening to me in the few seconds before David had leaned casually against the doorway and offered, \"Make yourself comfortable. You're… Miranda, right? From one of the parties?\" I had dropped onto the edge of a nearby sofa, correcting, \"Amanda.\" \"Right.\" David had nodded and sat down on the opposite end of the couch. \"To what do I owe the pleasure of the repeated presence of a pretty girl?\" If the situation had been different, I would have considered his eloquence funny, but nothing would have been funny at that moment. \"Don't get too happy about a pretty girl too quickly.\" I had said softly. \"Why not?\" David had asked, his eyebrows rising as he moved closer to me on the couch. Suddenly feeling self-conscious alongside being nervous, I had moved away, keeping the distance between us the same as it had been before. \"Because you already got this pretty girl pregnant.\" \"What?\" he'd asked, brows creasing in confusion like he didn't understand what I'd meant. \"I'm pregnant.\" I'd repeated, keeping my gaze locked on my clenched hands. \"You're the father.\" \"What?\" he'd whispered again. \"Are you sure?\" \"That I'm pregnant or that you're dad, 'cause the answer is yes to both questions.\" Silence had reigned for a few seconds after my moment of snappishness, but then David had demanded, \"Then just get rid of it.\" It actually took me a second to realize what he meant, and when I did, my \"no!\" slid off of my tongue before it ran through my startled brain. This answer actually made him look at me for the first time since I'd told him. \"What do you mean 'no'?\" His tone had changed to something darker, but I was already too much of a mess to realize it. \"I mean no. I won't do it. I'm not getting an abortion.\" \"Why on earth not? You'll recover from it, I'm sure.\" \"I'm not worried about me,\" I'd tried to explain it to him. \"I don't want to hurt the baby.\" \"How do you know that it's a baby?\" Then I had noticed the change in him, the way that he'd growled the question meant that I couldn't miss it even if I had wanted to. And I did want to. Just like with my father years ago, I realized then, that I had desperately wanted him to make everything okay. I had wanted him to promise to take care of me, of us – me and the baby. But I also realized that, just like with my father, he would do no such thing. Even so, I had tried to explain my thoughts to him. \"Well, I don't know for sure that it is or isn't, but if it is, I don't want to be the one to kill a child. So, no, I just can't.\" \"Yes, you can.\" He was mad now, and it wasn't a request. It was a demand, an irate one at that. \"No,\" I had repeated softly, scrambling to think of ways to calm him down. But it had been too late. Red, green, and blue. I remember that those were the exact colors of the stars that had exploded in my vision when I fell off of the couch – when David had hit me. He and I had both frozen – him still on the couch, me on my hands and knees crab-style on the floor – and stared at each other for a long moment. I had gotten the impression that he was just as surprised as I was at the way he had lashed out. Surprisingly, I had won our little staring contest. He had blinked first, and then surged off of the couch and towards the door, saying stiffly over his shoulder, \"Lock the door behind you when you leave.\" And then he had slammed the door behind himself, leaving me alone with his baby growing inside of me. I say that the chapters are going to be drabble-length and then what? The next two chapters aren't. Anyway, we're halfway done with this story! The story gets better, I promise! You'll get a ray of sunshine in the next chapter. Please tell me what you think and stay tuned for the next chapter! Thanks![Chapter 7] Unable to stand being in his dorm room for one moment longer, I had left as soon as I could see through my tears and pain. I had considered going back to my own dorm room, but there was no way that I could have let Kasey see the black eye that I knew was forming. She would have hunted David down and tried to kill him. Although her rage probably would have made up for it, she is smaller than I am, and I hadn't wanted to find out what he would have done to her had she tried to hurt him. So I had left campus instead. I had gone on foot, not knowing where I was going, just that I needed to move. I had ended up in a cathedral of all places. The building had been huge, empty, and eerily quiet. I had slid into the back pew, as silent as my surroundings. During the times that I had gone to church before my father left my mother and I – after his departure, I had refused to attend – church had seemed like a happy place. At that moment though, alone in the cathedral, the silence had just seemed dark and oppressive. So I had broken that silence, letting the sound of my soft sobbing echo around me. The tears had only made my eye hurt worse, but I had continued crying for awhile until I once again felt like I had no more tears left in me. And that's when I had noticed the tract. It had been forgotten by someone and left in the pew near where I had been seated, a simple, unassuming little piece of green paper folded in thirds and bearing the declaration \"Jesus Loves Even Me (and YOU!)\" But in the half an hour that had followed, that tract had been the tool that God had used to change my life irrevocably and give me \"the peace of God, which passeth all understanding.\" And against all odds, I had left that cathedral with my mind made up, a smile on my lips, and an absolutely unforgettable peace in my heart. Finally, the drabble-sized chapter that I've been promising you! And that ray of sunshine, too! Please tell me what you think and stay tuned for the next chapter! Thanks!:)[Chapter 8] But just because I had been saved, that didn't mean that all of my problems had magically vanished. Quite the opposite, actually; they had just been getting started. After my first trimester, my morning sickness had disappeared, thankfully, and – so long as I kept my distance from David Thomson – my life had seemed to almost return to normal for the next three months. As long as I had chosen my outfits carefully, I was blessed in that I stayed skinny enough that you couldn't even have told that I was pregnant. During the final three months though, my life had began to fall apart. At that point, I could no longer hide my condition, and my cheerleading coach had kicked me off of the squad for the safety of my unborn baby girl. While I had understood the necessity and logic of her action, I had still cried about it a little that evening, immature and selfish as those tears had been. But that had been nothing when compared to what other people had done and said to me, behind my back at least. And David had been the worst of them all. I can still to this day remember the first time that I heard him tell someone that – contrary to the rumors that had been floating around – he was not responsible for my getting pregnant. That he wasn't his own baby's dad. Oh, how much I had cried that day! I had even locked Kasey out of our dorm room until she had managed to pick the lock in her desperation to reach me. She had even been afraid for a little while that I had become suicidal. By my way of thinking though, killing me killed the child inside of me, and I hadn't been about to give David the satisfaction of doing that. So my being suicidal had not been the case. It had just been that, just like in the situation with my father, it had taken a single, crushing blow for me to realize just how little he had cared. Even though I had long resigned myself to the fact that he hadn't cared for me, and probably never would, some part of me had always kept on hoping that maybe he would be there for his daughter's sake and be a part of her life. But his declaration – the first of many similar ones – had proven even that hope to be an impossibility. It was during that time that I realized that chances were it was only going to be me and my daughter, unless God intervened. Another drabble-sized chapter, like I've been promising you! Please tell me what you think and stay tuned for the next chapter! Thanks!:)[Chapter 9] After that, out of sheer necessity, if not outright self-preservation, I had learned to not only give a wide berth to David, but to faze him out when he hadn't been able to help being nearby. At that time, it had made both of our lives easier if we pretended that the other didn't even exist. So, on the day that I had the baby, it hadn't even crossed my mind on more than one occasion that it might be a good idea to pass the information on to David. And the one time that I had thought about it, I had decided not to. Instead, I had decided to concentrate on my newborn daughter, whom I had named Olivia. \"Olivia\" is the Italian version of the name \"Olive,\" and by my way of thinking, the olive leaf in the Biblical account of the Flood in Noah's day was a symbol of new beginnings. I had truly wanted to believe that Olivia's birth would mean a fresh start for us both, and in some ways, it was. The first time that she had been out in my arms, I really hadn't cared about anything besides her. That moment is still one of my most precious memories. I remember that her warmth had startled me, oddly enough. For all of the hard, judgmental names, looks and cold shoulders that I had gotten because of her existence, Olivia herself had been very soft, warm, and fragile. Essentially, just a normal baby, although to me she had been and still is one of the best things in my life. It was just me, her, and God against the world, but from that first time that I had held her in my arms, I had known beyond a shadow of a doubt that I would do whatever it took to raise her as well as I could. Another drabble-sized chapter, this one being another ray of sunshine. And we're now three-fourths of the way through the story, so keep your eyes peeled for the next chapter! Reviews make my day, BTW. Thanks!:)[Chapter 10] I had just never expected reconciling with David Thomson to be a part of that plan. But there I had been, sitting at my kitchen table almost five years later with a letter and a check both from David in my hands. If the contents of the letter had been any indication, he had sounded sincere enough for this to be a real attempt from him to reconnect with me. And goodness knew that I understood how the grace of God could change a person's life and outlook. But the question that had remained was: Was I willing to meet with him again after so many years? After all, it wasn't like my previous conversations with the man had gone well by anyone's standards. My eyebrows had drawn together of their own accord when I had read the words \"I have begun to pray for you and Olivia.\" The David Thomson that I had known would not have prayed under any circumstances, let alone done so for me and the daughter that he had never even met. But it had hit me then that he did apparently want to meet Olivia, to re-earn my trust. It hadn't seemed real. The thought had crossed my mind that the body of the letter had been typed, so maybe it was fake. But it is his signature that I remember so clearly. Don't ask me how, but I had known that his signature was legitimate; it hadn't been forged. This had actually been happening, and it had been real. I had sighed then, knowing that I would at least meet him again, as he'd asked, because it might actually turn out that having him in mine and Olivia's lives – or at least primarily Olivia's, and mine by default – could be what was best for her. Beyond that, I hadn't had any idea. For the second time in my life, I never would have guessed that meeting with him would have the ultimate ending that it did. Another drabble-sized chapter, this one (kind of) being another ray of sunshine. And we're now five-sixths of the way through the story, so keep your eyes peeled for the next chapter! Reviews make my day, BTW. Thanks!:)[Chapter 11] I had been prepared for practically anything when I had walked into that coffee shop just a week later to meet with David. I had been prepared for anything except for what I had actually gotten, that is. Nearly everything that I had remembered about David up to that meeting had been cold, cruel, and emotionless. But during that evening, over coffee that he had insisted on paying for, I had seen almost too many emotions in him to name. Humility that had both stunned me and forced me to reevaluate my opinion of him. Pain that had resembled my own in ways that I hadn't cared to think him capable of. Sadness that had spoken of him having as much trouble with our united past as I did, if not for reasons other than my own. A self-loathing that had matched – if not been greater then – my own feelings about him. And the most surprising thing of all – the thing that I had noticed then and still recall so clearly even now – had been that all of those emotions had been utterly sincere. I had felt myself beginning to once again trust him a little even then. And, despite the misgivings that had still remained at that point, I had let him not only into Olivia's life, but also back into my own life. Another drabble-sized chapter, this one (kind of) being another ray of sunshine. And we've now only got one more chapter left in the story, so keep your eyes peeled for the final chapter! Reviews make my day, BTW. Thanks!:)[Chapter 12] Looking back, I'm so glad that I did let him back in. Because it was that day – even all of those terrible, hard days before, really – that had led to today. Today was my wedding day. I had never, not even in my wildest dreams, thought that this day would come. Not because I was getting married, but because of who I was marrying. It had taken three years of learning to trust him again. Three years of praying as hard as I ever had, and then fighting God and my own emotions on the answer that I received. But we were here now. And as I stepped out to the edge of the aisle, I realized that what I saw was another memory that was going to be branded into my mind for awhile. Not that I minded. My daughter was walking ahead of me down the aisle, spreading rose petals as she went, and heading towards my fiancé, soon to be husband, both of whom were grinning like mad. Taking stock of my own facial muscles, I realized that I was doing the same thing. That was okay, though. I was getting married; I was supposed to be smiling like crazy right now. At the front of the aisle now, I reached for David's hand, and he wrapped his fingers around mine. At that moment, everything came into the sharpest focus. A clock at the back of the church chimed the hour. The light played in David's sandy hair, streaking it golden. Dark red roses decorating the church contrasted against the backdrop of the plain, white walls. At that moment, he looked as full of life as I felt. His eyes sparkled like the brightest stars. I don't think that I had ever felt a peace like this in my life. He looked right at me as he repeated his vows, letting me see that he meant every word that he said. The chilliness of his ring felt good in my hand as I slid it onto his finger. His was the neatest signature that I had ever seen as he signed our marriage certificate. And the way that he kissed me once we were finally alone in our house later that night conveyed more emotion then his eyes ever could have. And I was blissfully happy. Another drabble-sized chapter, this one being another ray of sunshine, which I find is a good note to end a story on. Okay, up next is either a Courageous one-shot or another chapter of When Things Happen. Reviews make my day, BTW. Thanks!:) ","Summary":" Mostly my memories of my teenage years are a fuzzy blur at best, if they hadn't been stolen away en"},{"Movie":"Courageous","Title":"The Mission","Author":"Kathryn Claire O'Connor","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9140950","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. ~ 1 Timothy 4:12 (KJV) When I look back now at my fifteenth year, I can see that my life did not really begin until my little sister's life had ended. Most days, I think that maybe Emily's death was necessary for the events that took place. Some days I think maybe not. As it is, she died, and, as well as one ever can after four years, from what I've seen, I have moved on. But even that wasn't a possibility until the day that Dad suggested we begin memorizing Bible verses together. I was in a good mood that afternoon because the two of us had just come back from a run. When he asked me to come into his office, saying that he wanted to show me something, I went without a second thought. He presented me with a list of Scripture passages and the idea for memorizing them. When he pointed out John 3:3 on the list, I commented that while I had always heard the verse, I had never really understood it. And so we talked for an hour while he explained the Gospel story to me. And then and there in that room of my home, my father and I got down on our knees in prayer and I accepted Christ as my Lord and Saviour. It was an hour that changed my life forever. The second event, also second in importance, came a couple of months later. At the young age of fifteen, I began to feel the Lord calling me to preach. Very unusual at that age, I know - believe me, I used that excuse a lot in my struggle with it - but it was what it was. Although I couldn't bring myself to discuss it with my parents, I began to share my struggle with this conviction with my pastor, Jonathan Rodgers. The more I talked with him, studied the Bible, and prayed, the more that I became convinced that this was God's calling for me. And the more I fought against it. I was a very introverted guy. I didn't have a lot of friends, I wasn't always very sociable, and, most difficult of all to get over, I hated talking in front of crowds. Surely God couldn't use me as a preacher! But He not only could, He did. And this is how. Present day, spring, Sunday morning Dylan Mitchell slowed his run to a clipped jog as he made his way through Albany, getting his run in at dawn, before church. The past weekend he had been much more at peace since surrendering to the ministry at some point late Friday night. The one thing that still harped on his conscience, though, was that he had yet to tell his parents anything whatsoever about this turning point in his life. He planned to try and pull Pastor Rodgers aside and tell him about his decision at church later today though. And maybe talk to him about something else. Ever since he had started feeling the Lord pulling him towards the ministry, he had began to notice the young adults, teenagers, and children in Albany, in his school. He had begun to feel a calling towards them especially, to be a witness to his peers. To make a place, a mission, really, for them. He felt that this was his special mission from God, and he had accepted it. And he thought that maybe Pastor Rodgers could help him find a place to start his mission. Later that evening \"Pastor?\" Dylan sidled up to Pastor Rodgers when he noticed that the man was no longer occupied with one of his church members. \"Dylan,\" Pastor Rodgers shook his hand. \"How are you?\" \"Better, actually. Since Friday night.\" Pastor Rodgers raised his eyebrows in curiosity. \"Friday night?\" Dylan glanced self-consciously around to see who was watching. \"Yeah.\" The pastor noted his discomfort and tilted his head towards the exit from the auditorium. \"Let's go talk somewhere else.\" Dylan nodded and the two made their way out of the sanctuary. Once they were alone, walking side by side down a quiet hallway, Pastor Rodgers inquired, \"Now, do you want to tell me what happened Friday night?\" \"I gave up.\" Dylan answered simply. \"I quit arguing with God and He won. I surrendered to the ministry.\" \"I knew you would.\" Pastor Rodgers admitted with a thoughtful smile. \"Now I want to show you something.\" He turned a corner and led Dylan down a dark corridor that Dylan had never before noticed. \"Did you know that this church has a basement?\" \"No.\" Dylan replied in confusion. The pastor nodded and opened the door at the end of the hallway. \"The church is essentially two levels, but the below-ground level has never been finished. It's just roughed in. Cool during the winter and hot in summer, so nobody uses it. It's been forgotten, really. But if you want to use any of this space for anything, feel free. Maybe just run it by me first.\" Dylan froze, thoughts flying to the mission he wanted to have, and asked in amazement, \"Are you serious?\" \"Yes. God called you to preach, and me to give this space to you. If you want it for anything.\" \"Yes.\" Dylan said instantly. \"Yes! Thank you, Lord!\" \"I take it that you have a plan for this place?\" Pastor Rodgers asked with a smile. Dylan nodded. \"Something like that. I want to start a mission for the young people around here.\" The older man raised his eyebrows. \"That's a lofty goal.\" \"I know, Pastor Rodgers, but-\" \"Call me Jon.\" Dylan nodded. \"-Jon, but it's what I'm being called to do. And that you're just handing all of this space over to me, that's the sign that I needed.\" Jon nodded. \"I guess that I can understand that. But I really should get back upstairs now.\" \"Sure. Do you mind if I stay down here and look around for a little bit longer?\" \"Nah, go ahead. And, hey, the outdoor entrance to this basement is always left unlocked if you want to get in during the week. But the door at the stairwell is generally kept locked, so you wouldn't be able to get into the upper level.\" \"Okay. Thanks.\" Jon headed back up the stairs and Dylan started wandering around, awed at what God had just put in his lap. Only a work of the Lord could have made a sane man like Jonathan Rodgers hand this amount of space over to a fifteen year old boy. But Dylan got the feeling that even this great miracle was only going to be the beginning. All of the plumbing and electricity worked, even if it was a little worn down from not being used. But that was nothing that couldn't easily be fixed. The only thing that was unfinished was the walls. Some hadn't had drywall applied, so insulation was clearly seen, others had drywall, but no paint or wallpaper. The floors were all only concrete. But to Dylan, no place had ever been more beautiful. He smiled as he went through the place, cataloging what every room was or could become. Two bathrooms, a kitchenette, a room that was big enough to work as a small sanctuary, and a half a dozen rooms that could be either offices or classrooms. It was everything that he had wanted, and so much more than he had even dared to dream about. Even as the thought crossed his mind, two Scripture verses were on it's heels. Philippians 4:19 - But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. - and Ephesians 3:20 - Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us. A few minutes more of exploring, and Dylan decided that he had better make his way back upstairs before his parents started looking for him. So he hurried up the stairs and opened the door at the top of the stairwell. And crashed straight into Tyler Fuller and Jade Hayes. Sorry if the writing seems not up to my usual standards somehow. It kinda feels like it to me for some reason. And I know that it's an unusual plot, but please, if you review, no flames. I hope that you enjoy this story! Thanks, guys (and girls)!:)[Chapter 2] \"Sorry.\" he gasped. \"It's fine.\" Jade said. Tyler added, \"We've been looking for you. Your parents are wondering where you are.\" Dylan nodded and turned to go back to the auditorium, stopping when Tyler asked, \"What were you doing down there?\" \"Nothing.\" The lie slipped far too easily off of Dylan's tongue and he couldn't help but flinch. \"I didn't even know that this place had a basement.\" Jade said. \"Pastor Rodgers said that it's been forgotten.\" Dylan replied. Jade asked with raised eyebrows, \"He showed it to you?\" \"Yeah.\" \"What for?\" Dylan took a deep breath, deciding to tell the truth. \"I want to use it as a mission of sorts for kids and young adults.\" \"You mean like a church? Underneath another church?\" Jade asked. He nodded. \"Wait a sec.\" Tyler demanded. \"You're going to run it?\" Dylan answered slowly, \"Yeah.\" \"You're going to run - as in pastor - a church?\" Tyler asked. Dylan nodded. \"But it's just a mission, not a church. I'm not, like, ordained or anything.\" \"So...\" Jade asked slowly, \"You've been called to preach?\" \"Yep. Just don't tell my parents; they don't know anything about any of it.\" \"Wow.\" Tyler said. \"Can we see your mission?\" Jade asked curiously. Dylan shrugged. \"Yeah, sure, but there's nothing to see, really, not yet. It needs fixed up a little.\" \"We could help you with that.\" she offered. \"Or at least I would if I could.\" \"Me too.\" Tyler volunteered. \"Really? Thanks, guys. Come on, let me show you what we've got to work with then. You can go on down, but first I need to check in with my parents.\" They parted ways and Dylan found his parents, asking Adam, \"Can I go finish my conversation with Jade and Tyler?\" \"Yeah, sure. Just be back up in a quarter of an hour.\" Dylan nodded. \"Yes, sir.\" Then he darted back out of the auditorium and into the basement. \"This place is kind of cool.\" Tyler said when he saw Dylan. \"It won't need that much work, I don't think.\" \"Maybe you could talk to Javier about helping out.\" Jade suggested. Dylan shook his head. \"I don't want to get any more adults involved yet.\" Jade frowned at him, but didn't say anything. Dylan was grateful; after all, he already knew that the secretiveness was wrong. \"So, what do you want to be what down here?\" Tyler asked. Dylan pointed to the biggest room off of the hallway. \"That's going to be the sanctuary.\" He started down the hallway with the other two trailing behind him. \"There's two bathrooms beside that, and the kitchenette is across the hall. The others are just classrooms, I guess.\" \"One of them will need to be your office, if you're going to be in charge of this place.\" Tyler pointed out. \"I'm not 'in charge of this place,' God is.\" Dylan corrected. \"Well, you'll still need an office.\" Jade said. Dylan shrugged. \"We can figure that out later, I guess. Just having it is enough for today.\" \"What is 'it's' name?\" Jade queried. \"It's name?\" Dylan repeated. \"Of course.\" \"Yeah,\" Tyler added. \"Every church has a name.\" Dylan shrugged again. \"Something 'Baptist Mission,' I guess.\" \"Another something for another day?\" Jade guessed. \"Yeah.\" Dylan smiled, realizing that this place, his adventure, had just become Tyler and Jade's adventure as well. \"Are you sure that we can do this?\" Tyler asked. \"I think that it's a good idea.\" Jade said. \"And besides,\" Dylan added, grin only widening. \"' I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. '\" Tyler smirked. \"You really are a preacher, aren't you?\" Dylan nodded, looking around at his surroundings. \"I feel like it.\" \"So,\" Jade said. \"We should probably get back upstairs. Do you want to meet down here Wednesday after church and talk about it some more?\" The boys agreed. Jade grinned at them. \"It's a date.\" Monday evening wasn't really an enjoyable part of the week for Dylan, because that was the day that his fellow student and English tutor, Hannah Carson, came over to help him out with his homework. He didn't enjoy the lessons, but he had to admit that her tutoring had helped him get his grades up. Hannah was a nice enough girl, but the rumor around school was that she had trouble at home; her father was an alcoholic. But with her easy smile, generally extroverted personality, and put-together looks, you would never know it. Not that Dylan should have been noticing her looks - though with jet black hair, big brown eyes, and a slim frame, she was very pretty. She was an unbeliever, and that made her not a possibility for Dylan. She already had a boyfriend anyway. And her twin brother, Leon, was a force to be reckoned with, something that Dylan had summed up to having to protect his mother and sister from their father. It was a sad situation, and Dylan vaguely wondered, while Hannah was packing up her things after their tutoring session, if there was anything that he could do to help her. \"So, Hannah, how have you been?\" he asked conversationally. She looked up from stuffing her backpack with papers, before averting her eyes. \"Fine.\" Lying. \"Is it anything that I could help you with?\" he asked. Hannah laughed dryly. \"No, not hardly.\" \"I know someone who can help you.\" She looked up at him with panic in her eyes. \"How? Can you tell already?\" \"What?\" he asked in confusion. Seeing that he didn't know about whatever it was that she was talking about, she calmed down, saying. \"Nothing.\" And then it seemed to dawn on her what he had said. \"Wait a second, if you don't know what I'm going through, then how can you know someone who can help me with it?\" \"Because I know God.\" Another dry laugh escaped her. \"Believe me, God really doesn't want anything to do with me right now.\" she sighed. \"And before long, you won't either.\" \"And how do you know that?\" She shook her head with a wry smile on her lips, by now standing in the open doorway of the Mitchells' house. \"Just believe me. You'll figure it out soon enough.\" Not giving him a chance to respond, she walked down the walkway and left the property. Dylan sighed. Lord, whatever's going on in her life, help her. And the rest of her family. It seems like they really need you. Sorry if the writing seems not up to my usual standards somehow. It kinda feels like it to me for some reason. And I know that it's an unusual plot, but please, if you review, no flames. I hope that you enjoy this story! Thanks, guys (and girls)!:)[Chapter 3] Dylan noticed on Tuesday morning that some of his fellow students were giving him odd looks. He couldn't figure out why until one of his few close friends, Jeremy Rivers, came up to him in the hallway and asked, \"Why have people started saying today that you're a preacher?\" The question made Dylan pause before he closed his locker door and answered, \"Because I am. I guess. I've been called to preach anyway. And I sort of have a mission, only it's not open yet.\" \"What sort of mission?\" \"A small church is what I mean when I say 'mission.'\" Dylan exclaimed. Jeremy whistled, looking like he didn't know whether to be impressed or laugh, although he was obviously still skeptical. \"You have a church?\" \"Sort of. I will once some friends and I get the place fixed up.\" \"Tell me when it's open. I may just have to come over and check out you and that 'mission.'\" Dylan nodded as Jeremy walked away. \"I'll do that.\" This was a conversation that Dylan repeated at least six more times throughout the remainder of the day. Leon and Hannah Carson had even asked him about it. Walking home from school, Dylan was trying very hard not to be upset with Tyler and Jade. They were the only people he had told besides Pastor Rogers, and he trusted him to keep the information to himself until Dylan said it was okay to do differently. So Jade and/or Tyler had to have slipped up to someone. Dylan grabbed his cellphone out of his pocket, intent on calling Tyler and giving him a piece of his mind. But he didn't, not yet. It wouldn't do any good to call someone when he was angry. Realizing this, he jammed his phone back into his pocket and burst into a run, letting the wind against his face carry away his anger. As it turned out, he didn't call either one of them. Knowing that he needed the time to cool down, he decided to give it a day and talk to them on Wednesday night in the basement. Wednesday morning, he was half dreading going to school. He didn't want to be the main story again. Problem was, he wasn't. Hannah's boyfriend, Danny, was. For reasons no one seemed to know, he had committed suicide sometime after school the day before. Dylan hesitantly approached Leon during lunch, since Hannah hadn't come to school that day, and asked, \"Is there anything that I can do to help?\" \"No.\" Leon sighed. \"Not unless you can bring him back to Hannah from the dead.\" Dylan shook his head. Leon and Dylan slid into a table as Leon continued, keeping his eyes on the tray in front of him, \"I never really liked him, you know. I shouldn't say that about a dead guy, probably, but I didn't. Danny, he… didn't treat her like she deserved to be treated. He didn't hurt her or anything; he just… didn't treat her as well as she should be treated. But Hannah didn't see it. She loved him anyway. Too much, I guess.\" \"What?\" Dylan asked. \"Huh?\" \"What do you mean 'too much'?\" \"Oh,\" Leon looked away. \"It's nothing. Just forget that I said anything, okay?\" Dylan nodded uncomfortably. \"Okay. And if there is ever anything that I can do, for any of you, just tell me, alright?\" Leon nodded before changing the subject, asking Dylan about the mission. That night, Dylan slipped out of the sanctuary as soon as he could and headed down to the basement where he was joined a couple of minutes later by Jade and Tyler. \"So, where do we start?\" Tyler asked. \"How about with who leaked to my school that I was a preacher?\" Dylan asked. Jade looked at him in confusion, stating, \"I didn't tell anyone.\" Dylan nodded at Jade and looked at Tyler. He had figured as much. \"I told a few of my friends.\" Tyler admitted. \"But no one that goes to Westover High.\" And then the thought dawned on him, \"A few of the people I told have siblings that go there though.\" \"Then that explains that.\" Dylan said, shoving his hands into his pockets. \"Are you upset?\" Tyler asked, looking mostly confused and a little concerned. Dylan sighed. \"No. I just wasn't expecting it. But a few of the kids from school said that they'd come to the opening service. Mostly out of curiosity, I guess, but they still said that they'd be here.\" He stretched a smile across his face and aimed it at the worried twelve-year-old. \"So I guess that it all worked out okay.\" \"Good.\" Tyler grinned. \"So what else do we need to work on?\" Jade broke in and asked. \"A name needs to be a priority.\" Dylan admitted. \"Everyone has asked what it is, and I've had to tell them that it doesn't have one.\" \"Same here.\" Tyler said. \"So what about the usual stuff? You know 'grace', 'faith,' 'Bible' and all that?\" Dylan shook his head. \"No. I want something different, something definitely not usual.\" \"Like what?\" Jade asked. Dylan shrugged. \"I thought about something hymn-based, but I don't have any specific ideas.\" \"Then we think about it until we come up with something.\" \"But work on other things in the mean time.\" Tyler added. \"Of course.\" Jade answered. \"So what else needs worked on?\" The list that Dylan had mentally racked up was a little daunting, but he knew that they could do it. All things through Christ , he reminded himself as he began to list what all lay before them. Thursday morning brought yet another piece of news to Dylan through the school grapevine. Hannah was in the hospital, and Leon was nowhere to be found, so Dylan didn't know why. He didn't know anything except for that she was apparently sick, and he was worried for his friend. As soon as he had left the school campus that evening, he called Hannah's cellphone. No answer. He drummed his fingertips against his leg, sighing heavily. \"C'mon, Hannah, what's going on with you?\" He put his phone back in his pocket, allowing his imagination some space to go to town. And that's when her earlier comment came back to him: Can you tell already? Was whatever was bothering her terminal ? \"God, I know that You know what's going on right now, even if I don't. And I know that You know what it is that Hannah and her family need. I bring them to You. Please, help them. And show me what I can do, if anything.\" Dylan tried one more time to get a hold of her, and when he was sent straight to voicemail, he broke into a run again, letting a steady stream of prayers filter through his mind. It was calming. Sorry if the writing seems not up to my usual standards somehow. It kinda feels like it to me for some reason. And I know that it's an unusual plot, but please, if you review, no flames. I hope that you enjoy this story! Thanks, guys (and girls)!:)[Chapter 4] Leon was back at school on Friday, but it wasn't until school was over and they were leaving the premises that Dylan was able to catch up to him. \"Hey,\" he greeted Hannah's twin. Leon glanced at him out of the corner of his eye as they walked along the sidewalk. \"Hey.\" \"So, uh… what's up with Hannah?\" \"None of your business.\" Leon answered so quickly that Dylan knew it wasn't the first time that he'd given that answer today. \"She's not, like, sick, is she?\" Leon sighed, scuffed the toe of his tennis shoe against the cracked cement, seemingly coming to a decision. \"If I tell you, you do not, under any circumstances, tell anyone without mine or Hannah's express permission. No one. Are we clear?\" Dylan nodded, brows creasing with concern at the other boy's nearly fierce tone. \"Of course.\" Leon sighed again, keeping his eyes on the ground as he told Dylan. \"Hannah… she was carrying a baby.\" \"Pregnant?\" Dylan repeated, letting that news sink in. He hadn't seen that coming, not even with all of the scenarios that he had thought up since the day before. But it made sense. The panic in her eyes when she had asked, Can you tell already? \"Danny's baby.\" Leon growled, obviously angry with their recently deceased peer. \"That's why he killed himself. Hannah told him that she didn't want to kill the baby. He figured out that she wasn't going to change her mind and he couldn't handle it. So instead of the baby dying that day, Danny did.\" The boys walked for a few minutes in silence, Dylan being stunned beyond words. \"Wait a second,\" he said after a minute. \"Hannah was carrying a baby?\" \"Yeah. She got so upset when she found out about Danny, and was so upset for so long, I guess, that she couldn't physically handle it. She miscarried Wednesday night.\" \"Oh man,\" Dylan said softly. \"I… I don't know what to say.\" Leon shrugged, having yet to look up from the ground in front of him. \"How is she?\" Leon scoffed, every word he said as hard as stone now. \"She just lost a baby. Her child died , Dylan. How do you think that she's doing?\" Dylan flinched. \"How are you doing?\" he asked after pausing for a second. \"Outside of wanting to strangle the life out of Danny, just fine.\" \"If it helps, he's already dead.\" \"Yeah, I know. That's the problem. If that stupid jerk hadn't committed suicide, Hannah wouldn't have miscarried! She would still be fine and my niece or nephew would still be alive! He killed that baby!\" That was a stretch, Dylan knew, but he also understood the need to have someone to blame. Danny was obviously the easiest target. \"I'm so sorry, Leon.\" Leon looked at him out of the corner of his eye, eyes hard. \"Aren't you supposed to ask if there's anything you can do, since you're a preacher and everything?\" \"Maybe.\" Dylan answered with a shrug. \"But I know that it doesn't seem like it right now, does it?\" Leon kicked at the sidewalk, lowering his eyes again. \"You know,\" Dylan continued thoughtfully, \"There's a verse that says that it's actually better for those that were never born. I'm not sure where it's at, Ecclesiastes, I think.\" \" Do not talk to me about God right now.\" Leon ordered sharply. Dylan swallowed. Was I this angry when Emily died? \"But it's right.\" He said hesitantly. \"The younger one is when they die, the less they have to go through while on earth. And, considering that, doesn't it seem like it would be best to die like Hannah's baby? Before they know anything beside warmth and safety?\" Leon didn't answer at first, but Dylan could tell that he was thinking about what he'd said. \"Only the good die young, huh?\" Recognizing the title of a song, Dylan allowed a grin to twitch at the corners of his mouth as he nodded. \"Something like that, yeah.\" For the first time in a while, Leon looked Dylan in the eye, asking, \"Do you think, could you… come see Hannah? Maybe tell her what you just told me? I don't know if it'll help or not, but it's something. I know it's a lot to ask, but you kind of, I don't know,… you get it.\" Dylan nodded. \"Sure, I guess.\" He bit his lip. \"I could try, anyway.\" \"Thanks, man.\" Leon said with a ghost of a smile. Another minute of almost companionable silence passed between the two of them before Dylan asked hesitantly, \"Do you mind if I… It's just, if you want someone who understands what Hannah's going through, my mom… would understand her feelings better than I would. Do you think that it would be okay if I tell my parents and see if my mom can come with me?\" Leon considered this as Dylan added, \"They really do like Hannah, and I know that they'd be willing to do what they could to help you all out.\" \"Alright.\" Leon agreed. Dylan allowed himself a little smile as the two boys stopped at the place where they parted ways to go to their own houses. \"Alright.\" \"Thanks.\" \"No problem.\" A final nod of his head and Leon started down his road. \"And, hey,\" Dylan added, \"Just so you know, I'm praying for you and your family.\" Leon smirked skeptically back at Dylan as he walked away. Sorry if the writing seems not up to my usual standards somehow. It kinda feels like it to me for some reason. Sorry that this chapter is on the shorter side. And I know that it's an unusual plot, but please, if you review, no flames. I hope that you enjoy this story! Thanks, guys (and girls)!:)[Chapter 5] Dylan drummed his fingers against the steering wheel of the car as he drove Victoria and himself home from the hospital after seeing Hannah. \"Thanks for letting me drive.\" He said just to fill up the silence between them. Victoria tried to smile. \"You're welcome. You only have a few more hours left to drive before you can try for your license, right?\" Dylan nodded. Silence reigned for a long minute before he added, \"And thanks for coming, Mom. I know it was hard, so thanks a lot.\" \"I'm glad that I could help someone else.\" \"Do you think that we really helped, though?\" Dylan asked. \"Yeah, I do.\" Victoria answered after a moment's thought. \"Mrs. Carson thanked me for coming. I kind of think that she needed a mom to talk to, too, today.\" \"That's what you were doing in the hallway, then, when I was talking to Hannah and Leon in her room?\" Victoria nodded. \"Did I tell you that Hannah agreed to come to church once she gets out of the hospital?\" \"That's only the third time that you have.\" Victoria said with a smile. After a minute in silence, she said, \"You referencing all of those Scriptures kind of surprised me. I hadn't realized that you'd been getting into the Word that much more.\" \"Well, when Leon asked me to come talk to Hannah, I did a quick study before we left the house. But other than that, I downloaded an electronic Bible recording onto my iPod, and if I'm running alone, I listen to it then.\" His mother smiled lovingly at him. Catching her look out of the corner of his eye, he glanced at her, asking innocently, \"What?\" \"I'm just really proud of you, Dylan. You've matured a lot in the past few months, and I'm just really proud of you.\" He grinned, but the joy was short-lived as the thought crossed his mind that he was still withholding the call to preach and the mission from her and his dad. And then and there he almost told her. But he didn't. Dylan slid into bed later that night, mind whirling with the day's events. \"Thank you, Lord,\" he whispered into the darkness. \"For softening Hannah towards you. And help Leon with his anger towards the situation. And help their parents as well.\" He continued praying, mentioning the other things and people on his prayer list After his \"amen\" he burrowed down under his covers, which he quickly kicked off because of the humid Georgia heat. Flipping onto his back and lacing his hands together behind his head, Dylan stared out at the stars shining outside his window. It was funny, he thought, how the death of the baby – whom Hannah had named Casey – had garnered two completely opposite reactions from Hannah and Leon. Second to Danny, Leon was obviously angry with God. However, at the hospital, Hannah had been more receptive then ever when Dylan and Victoria had presented her with the salvation story. Maybe this would be what it took for her to bring herself to the Throne of Grace. He could only hope, hope and pray. Saturday morning, Dylan was up at a record breaking hour and biking two and a half miles across town. Armed with his backpack full of a couple of his father's tools, some of his mom's cleaning products, a can of WD-40, some roller paint brushes, and a tarp, he was on his way to the mission. His plan for today was to meet Tyler and Jade there and get all the appliances in working order if at all possible. In opening the outside door to the basement, he found his first project in the painful protest that the door made. He shrugged off his back pack and took out the WD-40, spraying the door's hinges with it. Swinging the door back and forth a few times, he grinned at its silence and his small success. Now it was time to really get started. Nothing really needed repaired, per se; mostly it all just needed to be cleaned up and coerced into moving easily. As best as he could with what supplies he had brought with him, Dylan scrubbed away the rust and grime from sinks, toilets, and the kitchenette's stove. He smirked, wondering what his mother would think if she could see him now, since didn't bother to clean his own bedroom anywhere near as well as what he was doing here. When he was finishing up with the last thing, dusting, a couple of hours later, he heard footsteps coming down the hallway from the direction of the outdoor entrance. He paused before hearing Tyler call out, \"Dylan, are you here?\" \"Kitchen!\" Dylan called in reply. Tyler appeared in the doorway, toting two cans of paint. \"What's this,\" he joked, \"Dylan Mitchell is cleaning?\" \"I was. You got here just in time to see me put it all away. Not as much needed done as I thought was going to, so I'm pretty much through. It's about time you got here.\" \"Yeah. But, hey, Mom and I picked up Jade and then we went to Walmart and picked up some paint before she brought us here. So we have a good excuse.\" \"And four gallons of paint.\" Jade declared, carrying two into the room and setting them on the kitchen counter. \"Well,\" Dylan decided. \"In that case you have great timing.\" \"Where do you want to start painting then?\" Jade asked. Dylan pointed across the hallway. \"The sanctuary needs to be done first.\" Jade nodded and picked the cans back up, heading in that direction with Tyler as Dylan dug the paint brushes and tarp out of his backpack. Spreading the tarp out on the ground, Dylan asked Tyler, \"How did you explain wanting to buy paint to your mom?\" \"She didn't ask too many questions since Jade and I paid for it ourselves. We just said that we were buying it for church.\" \"I guess that's true.\" Dylan agreed before opening a can of paint and starting in on the wall with the white paint. He then changed the subject, asking, \"Have either one of you thought of any names for this place?\" \"You mentioned a hymn theme, right?\" Jade asked. \"Yeah. But that's still as far as I've been able to get, unless we just want to pull a name out of the hymnbook.\" \"No.\" Jade said. \"There's got to be a point to what we choose.\" \"Isaac Watts wrote a lot of hymns, didn't he?\" Tyler asked. \"'Watts Baptist Mission.'\" Dylan tried out the name. \"That just sounds weird.\" \"Philip P. Bliss is in the hymnbook a lot.\" Tyler offered. Again, Dylan shook his head. The two boys began to toss ideas back and forth while Jade worked in silence, running through ideas in her own mind. At length, Jade, who had been crouching on the floor and painting the bottom of the wall, leaned back on her heels and suggested, \"What about 'Newton-Crosby'?\" The boys blinked at her as if they had forgotten that she was there. \"Newton-Crosby Baptist Mission?\" Dylan asked, turning back to his work. \"Where'd you get a name like that?\" \"Well, John Newton, the guy who wrote 'Amazing Grace',was a seaman before he was saved. He worked on a slave ship and had a really immoral lifestyle before God got a hold of him. His life was so messed up that he was somebody that you wouldn't think God could use, but then Newton was saved and went on to write one of the best hymns ever. \"Fanny Crosby was blind. She was also someone that you would think couldn't make a big difference, especially since she was a blind woman in the 1800s. But she wrote over nine thousand hymns, a lot of which we still sing today. \"The point to the name being, I guess, that God can use whoever he wants, regardless of your past or physical impairment,\" Dylan smiled at her when she added, \"or even your age. He can use me and He can use you, or whoever else He sends into this place in the future.\" Dylan looked at Tyler for his opinion. Both of the boys were grinning. Dylan nodded, \"Well then, Newton-Crosby it is.\" Sorry if the writing seems not up to my usual standards somehow. It kinda feels like it to me for some reason. And I know that it's an unusual plot (and now an unusually named mission), but please, if you review, no flames. I hope that you enjoy this story! Thanks, guys (and girls)!:)[Chapter 6] Sunday night during church, Dylan had gotten a phone call. Hours later as he got ready to crawl into bed, he had forgotten about the call and subsequent message that had been left on the phone. But the cell caught his eye as he turned to flip off his bedside lamp and he picked it up, checking the caller ID. It was from a number that he didn't have in his phone, but he decided to listen to it anyway. \"Hey, Dylan, it's Leon Carson. Listen, I have a total Hail Mary to ask to ask of you. My family knows pretty much no preachers, but Hannah wants to have a small ceremony sort of thing for Casey at the gravesite tomorrow after school with just our family and her best friend, so four or five people. Do you think that you could come and read the Bible or something? Hannah said that you're the only preacher type person that she's comfortable with letting do that, so… yeah. \"Call me back as soon as possible, thanks.\" Dylan fell back against the wall, needing something to hold him up, because all of the muscles supporting him had just failed him. His first instinct was to go talk to his dad about it, but he realized almost instantly that that wasn't an option, and it was a realization that helped absolutely nothing about his frame of mind. Should he call Pastor Rogers? But he had promised Leon not to tell anyone without his or Hannah's permission. Dylan sighed. Then he realized the obvious option – pray. So he did. He prayed like he had never prayed before in his life. And then, coming to a conclusion, he took his Bible from off of his nightstand and began to study. \"Alright, God,\" he breathed. \"If you want me to go this route with my life, let's go.\" Monday morning, Dylan told his mom that he had a really important get together with some of his friends after school, a remark that she had accepted with minimal comment. Choosing to ride his bike the three miles to school, he called Leon and informed him that he would be able to make it to the gravesite. Then he left a message on Pastor Rogers' phone, asking him to \"just pray for me today.\" He himself made it through the school day doing just that. Never before could he have ever said that he had prayed \"without ceasing,\" but that day he came closer to it than he had ever been. As soon as school was over for the day, Dylan met up with Leon and Gemma Yee, Hannah's best friend, as they left school. \"Do you want a ride to the cemetery?\"Leon asked. \"Mom's right over there.\" He pointed to a silver car. Seeing that it was a five-seater with three people already inside, Dylan shook his head. \"Nah. Not possible; and I already brought my bike, so I'll bike over, if that's okay.\" \"Yeah, that's fine.\" Leon said, following Gemma to the car. Dylan hurried to his bike and took off towards the Crown Hill Cemetery, still praying in his head the whole way. An hour later, Dylan was still giddy with relief as he biked through Albany, not really paying any attention to where he was going. He had survived the forty or so minutes at the cemetery. And gotten through his part of it quite well, if he did say so himself. It had been nerve-racking, speaking in front of other people – he couldn't quite think of it as preaching – even if it had been only Gemma and the four Carsons – Doug, Liz, Leon, and Hannah. \"Thank You, Lord!\" he called out as he turned onto Champagne Lane. He was turning off of Doncaster Drive and onto Whispering Pines Road before he realized where he was heading – the church, which by now was very much in sight. He parked his bike beside the church and went inside the main entrance, before finding his way to Pastor Roger's office. He knocked on the half-closed door. \"Come in.\" Jon beckoned. Dylan stepped into the office as Jon looked up from his Bible. \"Dylan, how are you, son?\" \"Wonderful.\" \"I've been praying for you today.\" Dylan grinned. \"I know.\" Jon gestured to a seat for Dylan and moved to sit in the other one, the same place that he had counseled Adam only a few months previous. \"I take it that things went well, then?\" \"Yeah, they did.\" Dylan nodded eagerly, grinning from ear to ear. \"I can really do this, Jon. With God's help, of course, but I can survive it.\" \"Maybe you had better backpedal a little.\" Jon suggested. \"You can do what?\" \"Preach.\" Jon raised his eyebrows, asking, \"And how did you become suddenly so sure of that?\" Dylan took a deep breath, before explaining, \"A girl in my school recently miscarried a baby, and she and her brother asked me to say a few words at a small graveside service today. I only left about ten minutes ago, actually, so it's probably awful that I'm happy, but… that was exactly what I needed, and I didn't even know it until I had actually done it.\" Jon nodded thoughtfully. \"Well, I'm glad that you've made your peace with that, Dylan.\" \"And me and a couple of other kids came by the mission yesterday and fixed up the mission a little. Got the appliances working, cleaned up the place a little, and painted the sanctuary.\" \"I thought that I smelled paint in the upstairs near there yesterday.\" \"Oh, and we came up with a name for the place, too.\" Jon grinned at the excitement of the young man before him and raised his eyebrows in inquiry. \"Newton-Crosby Baptist Mission.\" \"Oh? Why that name? Isn't it a bit unusual?\" \"Exactly. After John Newton and Fanny Crosby.\" Jon nodded. When he paused for a second, Dylan's smiled faded because he knew what question was coming up next. \"And… have you shared any of this with your parents yet?\" \"No,\" Dylan glanced down at his hands. \"Not yet.\" \"But you will soon?\" Jon pressed. Dylan bit the inside of his lip uncertainly. \"Eventually.\" He flinched when Jon sighed at his response. \"I just… I need time to get everything on its feet first.\" \"Do you think that Adam and Victoria wouldn't help you with that?\" \"No,\" Dylan looked up quickly. \"I know that they would, it's just… I need to do this without them. To prove to myself that I can handle it, you know?\" Jon nodded, but Dylan could tell that he was still unhappy with the answer. \"Do it soon, please, for yourself as much as anyone else. If I know the human conscience, their not knowing is bothering you as much as it's bothering me.\" \"Yeah.\" Dylan admitted uncomfortably. \"Hey,\" Jon knocked his knuckles against the arm of his chair, changing the subject. \"I think that you might like to know that I put something down in the mission for you. I thought maybe you could use it, and it's just been rolled up in a corner of my attic.\" \"What is it?\" Dylan asked curiously. \"A big piece of carpet. It was going to go in my living room a long while back, but when Maryanne saw that much red, she decided that she didn't like it, so we got something else. The piece downstairs has never been used, so it's all yours. It's pretty big, so it might be enough to cover the sanctuary.\" Dylan gaped. \"Are you sure that you want it to be used down there.\" \"Sure,\" Jon nodded. \"Like I said, I have no use for it.\" \"Wow, thanks.\" Dylan said, grinning. \"Do you mind if I go check it out?\" \"It's yours, so whatever you want.\" \"Thanks!\" Dylan said again, darting out of the office and down to the basement. Another prayer answered, and this being one that he hadn't even thought to pray yet. He laughed a little with the glee of it all as he skidded to a stop in the sanctuary, which was empty except for a huge roll of red carpet sitting at one edge of the room. He went over and tried to unroll it, but it wasn't going to budge with only him behind it. Oh well, at least it was here and – like Dylan and the rest of Newton-Crosby – waiting for use in the house of God. Longest chapter so far! Sorry if the writing seems not up to my usual standards somehow. It kinda feels like it to me for some reason. And I know that it's an unusual plot (and now an unusually named mission), but please, if you review, no flames. I hope that you enjoy this story! Thanks, guys (and girls)!:)[Chapter 7] On his way back home from Newtown-Crosby, Dylan called Tyler and asked him if they could meet up at the mission after school the next day. The sooner they could get the carpet put in, the better, he reasoned. And so the two of them met up the following day and laid the carpet in the sanctuary. Jade came in while they were working, bearing more things that they could use to fix the place up. So they turned Tuesday evening into a spontaneous workday, getting a lot done. They agreed to do the same thing Wednesday, telling their parents that they were going to go straight to the church from school and that they'd meet them there when they came for church. \"You know?\" Jade turned around to look at the sanctuary as she picked up her backpack Wednesday evening and prepared to go upstairs to Sherwood Baptist Church. \"This room looks ready for Opening Day.\" Tyler nodded. \"You're right, it does. What do you think, Dylan?\" They were right, he realized, gripping one of the fifteen folding chairs that they had set out earlier in the day. They could hold a service in this room tomorrow night if they wanted to. He thought about it for a second longer - the bathrooms were ready. The kitchenette and classrooms still needed a little more work, but overall they could start up the mission whenever they wanted. The idea both terrified and exhilarated him. \"I think it's looking really great.\" he answered. After another minute, the three made their way upstairs. \"Dylan,\" Adam called him over instantly and he was instantly thrilled to see Hannah and Leon standing with his parents. \"Hannah! Hi. It's so nice to see you here. I was hoping that you'd come. And Leon too. Even better.\" Hannah smiled uncertainly at him, obviously uncomfortable, and possibly a little awed at all of the people wandering around as they waited for the service to begin. \"Hi.\" \"I was brought here against my will.\" Leon declared, looking like he was only half joking. Dylan sighed in mock exasperation. \"I told Dad to quit duct taping people to the top of the truck, but why should he listen to me?\" His parents laughed and even the Carson twins smiled. After the church service, Dylan slipped back down into the Newton-Crosby sanctuary for a few minutes and kneeled in front of one of the chairs in prayer, asking God if it was His will that they open the mission so soon. He raised his head and stood, then wandered through Newton-Crosby, seeing how far the place had come. And he knew the answer. It was time. \"I thought that I'd find you down here.\" Dylan jumped and spun around in one rapid motion, suddenly facing Jon Rodgers. He had been so caught up in his thoughts that he hadn't heard the other man come down the staircase. \"I apologize if I scared you.\" Jon looked around. \"This place looks really nice. You and your friends have cleaned it up quite well. Do you know when you're going to start holding services here?\" Dylan swallowed with difficulty as his panic abated. \"If it's alright, I'd like to tell some kids at school that I'm going to hold a special opening service here tomorrow night.\" Jon nodded. \"So long as I can come hear you preach.\" \"Of course you can, if you really want to.\" \"Tomorrow then.\" Dylan took a deep breath. \"Tomorrow.\" The next evening, Dylan slipped out of the house under the guise of going for a run, hoping that neither one of his parents cared to notice that he was wearing his backpack. He grabbed his bike instead of running, and made it to Newton-Crosby Baptist Mission in under fifteen minutes. He smiled to see the sign that he, Tyler, and Jade had nailed beside the outdoor entrance earlier that day. Newton-Crosby Baptist Mission it declared in bold blue letters. Going inside, he ducked into the room that he had chosen as his office and changed out of his running clothes before heading for the sanctuary where Jon and Tyler was gathered with a few others. Jade came in a minute later with three of her friends. As he went around greeting everyone and feeling more like a preacher than he ever had before, Dylan took stock of who had showed up. Besides himself, Jade, Tyler, and Jon, there was Hannah, Leon, and their mother, Liz, with Hannah's best friend, Gemma. The three friends that Jade had brought with her were Lisa, CeCe, and a young man named Derrick Freeman. Tyler had brought a classmate named Ryan. Dylan's friends Jeremy Waters and Billy Reeves came as well. During the final couple of minutes before the service began, Dylan receded to a distant corner of the sanctuary, fighting something akin to a panic attack. \"If you do half as well as you did at Casey's grave, you'll do fine.\" Dylan jumped for the second time in as many days before turning to face Hannah Carson. He tried to look less nervous then he was when he said, \"Thanks for the vote of confidence.\" \"But you don't believe me.\" Hannah decided with an almost wry smile. He shrugged. \"I didn't say that.\" \"You didn't have to, you're sweating bullets.\" Dylan cringed. \"Am I that obvious?\" Hannah's answering grin said more than words would have. Her expression became more thoughtful as she asked, \"Aren't Christian's supposed to – I don't know – pray or something right about now, when they're worried? Because – I remember from my grandma – she used to say before she died that worrying was, like, a sin, or something.\" She cocked her head to look at him curiously. \"Is that right?\" Dylan smiled softly, feeling a little chastened. \"Yeah, it is. Thanks for the reminder, Hannah.\" \"Anytime, preacher.\" Hannah replied with a grin. Just then, Jade caught Dylan's eye and tapped on her watch. Turning to see who he was looking at, Hannah gave Dylan an encouraging smile. Before finding her seat between Leon and her mother she whispered to him, \"You can do it, I've seen you preach, remember?\" \"Thanks.\" With that, Dylan stepped up to the front of the room, since they didn't have anything resembling a pulpit yet. Showtime, God. Do me a favor and steal my show. Sorry if the writing seems not up to my usual standards somehow. It kinda feels like it to me for some reason. And I know that it's an unusual plot (and now an unusually named mission), but please, if you review, no flames. I hope that you enjoy this story! Thanks, guys (and girls)!:)[Chapter 8] Dylan sat cross-legged on his bed the next evening, mulling over an idea that he had gotten earlier in the day when his father and the other men were signing their copies of the Resolution. At the get-together, he had pulled Jade and Tyler aside and discussed it with them, and now he sat with a notebook in his lap and his Bible at his side. The subjects that he wanted to write for weren't necessarily going to be found in the Bible, but it couldn't hurt to look. He decided that he would tackle the subject of temperance and drugs first, since he knew that it was in the Bible and this was the one that seemed to be a bigger deal for teens then the other subject that he was considering – driving habits. Resolutions or pledges or something of the like about those two seemed like a good thing for teenagers to have. So he figured that he'd try to write them. Sunday morning, he was thrilled to see that Hannah and Leon had come to the church service with Liz once again in tow. They had been at the second service at Newton-Crosby too, on Saturday. He walked over to them, knocking his shoulder lightly against Hannah's. \"Four days in church in one week, huh?\" Hannah grinned. \"An all-time record, I guarantee.\" \"Well, I hope that you don't get burned out it. Hopefully none of you do.\" Leon rolled his eyes. Catching her brother's action, Hannah jabbed him in the ribs before informing Dylan, \"He really doesn't mind. It's kind of grown on both of us, I think.\" She tried to smile as she added, \"It's kind of nice to know that \"Somebody cares.\" Dylan smiled sadly in return as he nodded. \"He does care for you – for all of humanity. Very much so.\" Hannah just shook her head as her eyes became glassy and she looked away. Leon and Liz slipped away to find seats. \"Are you okay?\" Dylan asked her, even though it was painfully obvious that she wasn't. She nodded once again anyway, taking a deep breath to regain control of her emotions. \"Everything is still just really fresh sometimes, you know?\" Dylan agreed, because he really did understand, but he found himself at a loss for words. God, give me something to say to her. \"You know, God understands even better than I do. His only child died, too.\" The words came out of his mouth at the same time as they streaked across his mind. Hannah's expression pinched with thought as she considered the remark. After a second, she smiled slightly at him. \"Thanks, Dylan, good answer.\" Dylan smiled and went to find his seat before the service began. Thanks, God. Good answer. Back at his house later that night, Dylan got a phone call. He snatched up the cellphone, noting that it was Hannah calling, before he answered. \"Yes, ma'am?\" \"I am not a 'ma'am',\" she answered pertly. Her next words took Dylan totally by surprise. \"But I am a child of the King.\" Dylan sat up straight as an arrow, eyes widening. \"Say that again?\" She laughed and he could hear the happiness in her voice as she declared, \"The Lord saved me, Dylan, just less than an hour ago.\" Dylan jumped up from the couch, whooping loudly. He heard Hannah burst into a fit of giggles as his parents hurried in from where they had been talking down the hall. Finally he had something that he felt he could share with them! \"Son?\" Adam asked, already grinning but still looking a little wary at Dylan's uncharacteristic exuberance. \"Is that your mom and dad?\" Hannah asked. \"Do you mind if I tell them? Could you put me on speakerphone?\" \"Sure, yeah. I bet they'll be almost as excited for you as I am.\" Tuesday evening after the service, Dylan could tell that something was bothering Leon. As other people wandered around the mission talking to one another, Leon just sat where he was, staring forward or at his hands; he hadn't moved since the service had ended. Eventually, Dylan made his way over and sat down beside his friend. He waited for a few seconds before Leon asked hesitantly while still looking at his hands, \"This thing that happened to Hannah? Is it going to last?\" \"Last how?\" \"I don't know, it's just, when it happened – when she was saved – she was, like, crazy happy. And I didn't understand – she's my twin and I can almost always understand her – but I didn't understand this, how she could be so happy – not between Danny and Casey and Dad's alcohol problems – but she was. And I didn't think that it would last. I mean, it was nice and everything, but I figured that it would go away in twenty-four hours or less, but it didn't. It hasn't.\" He paused before coming to the conclusion, \"And it's not really going to, is it?\" \"I sincerely hope not.\" Dylan answered. \"So, this thing that happened, it's really real?\" Dylan nodded. \"It is.\" \"But what is ' it '? It's salvation, I know you've said that, but what does that even mean? And whatever it is…\" His voice dropped to a whisper, \"Can I have it too?\" \"You can; anyone can. You just have to ask the Lord for it, and believe that He'll give it to you.\" \"That really is all that there is to it?\" Dylan nodded the affirmative. \"That really is all that there is to it.\" \"I want to.\" Leon admitted, still keeping his gaze locked on his hands. Dylan shrugged. \"Then go ahead and just do it.\" \"Just do it?\" \"Just do it. It's kind of like asking your parent for a gift.\" Leon smirked. \"My mom or my dad?\" \"Your mom, definitely your mom.\" Leon bowed his head as Dylan continued, \"Just… ask believing, and He'll give it to you. He'll save you.\" Leon looked up and met Dylan's gaze, smiling like Dylan had never seen him do. \"He just did.\" Sorry that this took so long to post! And sorry if the writing seems not up to my usual standards somehow. It kinda feels like it to me for some reason. And I know that it's an unusual plot (and now an unusually named mission), but please, if you review, no flames. I hope that you enjoy this story! Thanks, guys (and girls)!:)[Chapter 9] The following Saturday was the day that Dylan planned to present the two pledges that he had written to his rag-tag congregation. He looked out over the small crowd, noting that the usual people were in attendance – Jade, Tyler, Hannah, Leon, Mrs. Carson, Gemma, and Jon Rodgers – along with about ten other people from either Dylan's, Jade's, or Tyler's school who either came off and on or showed up only this once, curious to see and hear a fifteen year old boy preach. After he had brought the message, Dylan announced, \"There is one more thing that I would like for each of you to carefully consider, especially if you're still a teenager, as I see most of you are. Over the past week, I have done some research and written these two pledges.\" Dylan held them up for display. \"One is on the subject of safe driving habits; I call it 'Emily's Pledge', after my younger sister who died earlier this year in a car crash. The other one is concerning temperance and drug abstinence, which I've named 'The Hollis Pledge,'\" Dylan inhaled softly. \"after the man who drove into the vehicle that my sister was in while he was under the influence of both drugs and alcohol. I would be more than happy to assist anyone of you who would like to sign either one or both of the pledges, and if you have any further questions once you read the pledges, I'll be glad to answer those too.\" He closed the service with a prayer. About ten minutes after the service had ended, Jade, Leon, and Hannah approached Dylan and asked if they could discuss a couple of ideas that they had with him. \"Sure.\" Dylan shrugged and led them down the mission hallway, to the opposite end of the building and into his office. Once they had settled he asked cheerfully, \"What's up?\" Leon looked at the girls and motioned to Dylan, saying, \"Ladies first.\" Jade looked to Hannah, so Hannah took that as her cue, and, taking a deep breath, started in. \"Jade and I both got the same idea when you presented the pledges just now. You were right in thinking that drugs and such are a big temptation for kids in high school…\" \"I know; I go to the same school that you do, remember?\" Hannah nodded, continuing on undeterred. \"And a lot of high school kids have bad driving habits, so those were good things to have pledges on.\" She paused. \"But there's another big temptation that you forgot.\" Dylan cocked his head to the side. \"Oh? What's that?\" \"Um…\" Hannah blushed. \"What about the other kind of abstinence – the kind that's not related to drugs? That's a problem for a lot of kids, a lot of good kids even, those that maybe don't want it to be a problem, but they feel like they're the only ones who feel that way, so they give in to peer pressure anyway. I think that it would be a good thing to have a pledge or something for that, something where kids can see that other kids feel the same way that they do about it.\" She shrugged. \"It's just an idea that Jade and I came up with.\" Dylan considered this, sitting on the top of his recently acquired desk with his hand propping his chin up and his legs swinging slightly back and forth. \"And it's a good idea, too. I really didn't think about that, even though I probably should have. Give me a couple of days to pray about it, and then we can talk about it again on Tuesday, if that's okay with you two.\" Hannah and Jade both nodded their assent, so Dylan turned to Leon, who then shared his own idea. \"What do you think about me creating a YouTube channel for the mission?\" Leon asked. \"It's easy to do and I was thinking that once I get that done, I could record some of the messages that you preach – like on my phone or something – and put them on the channel. It might turn out to be a good outreach, along with the fact that it's easy and free. So, perfect for us.\" Dylan opened his mouth to agree – since it really was a good idea – but then another thought came to mind, a thought that he voiced aloud without thinking. \"What if the wrong person sees me preaching?\" \"'The wrong person'?\" Leon repeated in confusion. Behind the Carson twins, Jade sighed angrily and rolled her eyes. Dylan's gaze skittered away from the frustrated teen's and the thought crossed his mind to wonder if it was that same guardedly disapproving look from Nathan that had driven David to Christ at the gun range. Hannah asked, \"Can there ever really be a 'wrong person' when it comes to hearing the Gospel?\" \"He means his parents,\" Jade clarified, frustration clear in everything about her at the moment. Hannah asked him skeptically, \"You still haven't told them yet?\" Dylan shook his head, looking her in the eyes for only a moment before focusing on his hands once again. He hated what he had seen in her eyes – hated himself for giving her, all of them really, a reason to doubt him, and thereby, the Word that he brought to them and the rest of the ragtag Newton-Crosby congregation. \"I just need a little more time.\" He said softly. Jade pointed out sharply, \"That's what you told Pastor Rodgers weeks ago, Dylan. When are you going to tell them? If you don't soon, I wouldn't be surprised if Pastor Rodgers tells them or tells us that we can't use this place anymore. Or both!\" She asked, her tone sharpening increasingly, \"Is that what you want?\" \"No, of course not!\" Jade reigned in her tone, saying softly, \"Then I suggest you tell them before long.\" Dylan sighed and nodded. \"I know. And I will. It's just, I…\" \"Need a little more time. I know. I just don't want to see everything that we've done here go down the drain because our pastor is a liar.\" Dylan flinched. Hannah spoke up softly, explaining, \"Dylan, for a lot of kids, this is the only place that they feel comfortable at that also gives them Biblical truths. And they don't deserve to lose that, they need this place.\" She whispered, \"So do I.\" \"And me.\" Leon admitted. Jade added the closing argument, \"We've gone too far to have to turn around now; don't make us go back to having nothing.\" Dylan nodded, now too ashamed to look any of them in the eye. \"Promise?\" Hannah asked softly. Another nod. \"I'll tell them as soon as I can get the three of us sat down together, when an opportunity presents itself. I promise.\" Hannah smiled gratefully, and Dylan managed to return the smile half-heartedly. Sorry if the writing seems not up to my usual standards somehow. It kinda feels like it to me for some reason. And I know that it's an unusual plot (and now an unusually named mission), but please, if you review, no flames. I hope that you enjoy this story! Thanks, guys (and girls)!:)[Chapter 10] However, Shane's arrest on the following Monday threw even Dylan's best intentions and efforts out the window. Now was not the time to spring something else on his parents, he knew, especially not his father. The week after the arrest, Adam went about doing what he had to do, looking like he had lost his best friend – which, in a sense, he had. Dylan didn't know what he could do to help him, so he settled for not adding some other big thing to what his dad had to think about. He decided that he would wait until the dust settled concerning Shane before he told his parents about the mission. Just over a week after Shane's arrest, on a Tuesday night, Dylan presented the third pledge to his congregation. Jade had come up with the idea of christening this one \"The Goliath Pledge.\" Her reasoning was that drugs and sex were two of the main giants that high school kids had to fight. Dylan thought that it might have more to do with her father's partner's own battle with it, but he knew better than to say so to her. Later that evening, after the service had ended and everyone else had gone home, Dylan stepped over to where he had tacked the three pledges to a bulletin board on the wall and he surveyed the names listed on each piece of paper. His name had been first on Emily's pledge. Somehow, Leon had managed to get to The Hollis pledge before Dylan, a fact that Dylan secretly loved, seeing as Leon and Hannah's father was a drunk. And that very evening, Jade and Hannah had signed first, side by side on Goliath. He tilted his head, staring at the signatures of those two girls. For Hannah to sign that pledge at all spoke volumes concerning how far she had come in the past weeks. That the girls had signed side by side instead of one under the other seemed like a promise to each other to help keep the other on the straight and narrow. He shrugged; maybe he was reading too far into something that wasn't even there. After all, Hannah and Jade were so different in so many ways. Jade was sharp and temperamental. Hannah was much mellower, more mature even. Especially after everything that had gone on with Casey, along with her salvation. He considered it almost strange that they were as close as they were; he hadn't expected them to become such good friends. But then… he hadn't expected to become as close to Hannah as he was, either. He grinned as the thought crossed his mind. The term \"girlfriend\" seemed odd to apply to any girl, but Dylan figured that if he was asked outright about his relationship with Hannah, he would probably use it. He had to admit though; it was a relationship that had snuck up on them while neither one of them had been looking for it. She had been a big moral support after the almost-argument that they had all had the day that he had presented the first two pledges. She had asked him Monday at their tutoring session if there was something that he wanted to talk about. Apparently she had sensed that something was wrong. She had proved to be a good listening ear, and at the end of their talk, as she was getting ready to leave, Dylan had quietly asked her if she wanted to go out and \"grab some burgers or something\" before the church service on Tuesday. \"Like on a date?\" she had asked, eyes widening a little. He had stammered out an \"I guess so,\" and she had agreed with a grin. He had showed her to the door, and, once he was sure that she was out of hearing range, he had startled his parents once again with a loud \"YES!\" They had peeked around the corner, and when he had surveyed the scene, Adam had mustered up something of a smile and commented with raised eyebrows, \"That girl makes you do strange things, son. Have you noticed that?\" Dylan had just grinned. Adam had shaken his head and Victoria had laughed outright. A week later, he still couldn't help but grin like a fool when he thought of that date. The next Sunday was Father's Day, and Dylan knew that his father was nervous over the speech that he was supposed to give that day. Although he couldn't quite bring himself to say so to his parents, Dylan knew how he felt. Dylan listened with interest as Adam spoke to the father's of the large Sherwood congregation, but he wasn't prepared for it when he heard his father say, suddenly as if he was speaking straight to Dylan, \"Who will pray for and bless my children to boldly pursue whatever God calls them to do? I am their father, I will!\" And Dylan knew, now beyond a shadow of a doubt, that Adam would do just that. He snuck a look at his mother, sitting at his side, and he knew that she, too, would support and help him in every way that she could. But first he had to tell them about everything – being called to preach, and starting up and running The Newton-Crosby Mission. Or maybe… maybe he would just show them. Tuesday evening, before he left the house for his habitual \"run,\" – which in this case meant a church service at Newton-Crosby – Dylan stood around the kitchen counter with his unsuspecting parents and after taking a deep breath, requested, \"Would you guys mind coming with me somewhere?\" \"Both of us?\" Victoria asked, looking up from her magazine with mild surprise. Dylan nodded nervously. \"Yeah. If you can both come, that would be really great.\" \"Don't you usually go for a run in about an hour or so?\" Adam asked. Dylan swallowed. \"About that… I haven't actually been running.\" \"Well,\" Adam asked. \"What have you been doing?\" \"That's what I wanted to show you. It's nothing bad, I promise. But it's… it's become really important to a lot of people. Including me. And I really want to share it with you. Please come?\" Seeing his earnest expression, Victoria shut her magazine and hopped off the barstool as Adam nodded and said, \"Of course, buddy.\" Dylan grinned and took another deep breath. \"Alright then. Here we go.\" I had convinced myself that I wasn't going to take this road with Dylan and Hannah, but the way that I have parts of the later chapters in my head required it and those chapters are refusing to be redone so that they don't require it. So, sorry if I sprung that on you without warning. This story should only have two or three more chapters to it if things work out how I want them to, by the way. Sorry if the writing seems not up to my usual standards somehow. It kinda feels like it to me for some reason. And I know that it's an unusual plot (and now an unusually named mission), but please, if you review, no flames. I hope that you enjoy this story! Thanks, guys (and girls)!:)[Chapter 11] \"The church?\" Adam asked with curious confusion as Dylan instructed him to pull the car into the parking lot. \"Yeah, kind of.\" Dylan answered, butterflies exploding in his stomach. \"What do you mean by 'kind of'?\" Victoria asked. Glancing back at him through the rearview mirror. \"Well, actually, what I wanted to show you is kind of the underworld of the church. Adam raised his eyebrows. \"'Underworld,' huh?\" Dylan nodded. \"Although some of the kids like to call it the underworld or the catacombs, it's formally known as The Newton-Crosby Baptist Mission.\" \"The do what?\" Despite himself and his nerves, Dylan grinned at his father. \"The Newton-Crosby Baptist Mission. After John Newton and Fanny Crosby. Jade Hayes came up with the name.\" \"They let a kid name a church?\" Victoria asked, sounding surprised. \"As he led them through Sherwood and up to the indoor entrance to the mission, Dylan didn't know whether he should laugh or cry at her comment, so he chose not to respond at all to what had sounded like a rhetorical question anyway. Instead, he opened the door and led his parents down the stairwell. \"Has this place always been here?\" Adam asked curiously as he and Victoria surveyed their unfamiliar surroundings. Dylan shrugged. \"I guess so. Until a couple of months ago, though, it was only a basement, kind of in bad shape. It really wasn't used for much of anything. Here,\" Dylan nodded in the appropriate direction. \"The sanctuary is that room over there.\" Adam and Victoria wandered into the unimposing, simple room and Dylan followed them, trying all the while to quell his nerves. When Dylan saw that Adam noticed the trio of pledges on the wall, he shoved his hands in his jeans' pockets and made his way over to stand by his father before he could be called over. Adam looked him in the eye, confusion and maybe a little bit of what Dylan would identify as pain in his stare as he wordlessly asked for an explanation concerning the names of the first two pledges. \"I wrote them.\" Dylan confessed. \"All three of them, actually. I had some help on the last one from Jade and Hannah, though.\" Adam looked impressed, turning to look more closely at them. \"Really? These look like something a preacher would cook up for the tees in his congregation.\" \"Yeah, well.\" Dylan took another deep breath – he had stopped counting how many he had taken since backing out of the driveway at the house – and looked at the floor, scuffing the toe of his shoe against the deep red carpet. \"Teenagers and kids make up the majority of this congregation, so that would be the right assumption.\" \"Maybe the writing just runs in the family.\" Victoria suggested with a grin as she came over to stand beside her husband. \"Maybe so.\" Dylan agreed with a small smile in her direction. \"Next up: the kitchen is across the hall, if you want to see it There really isn't physically that much to this place, just so you know. But I do still spend a lot of time here.\" \"Why?\" Victoria asked. \"I mean, it seems like a great place – I don't see that your father and I will have any problem with it – so I'm just curious as to why so much time here.\" Dylan took another deep breath and answered, eyes averted, \"I'll show you in a couple of minutes, if that's alright.\" Both of his parents looked at him strangely, but they agreed anyway, seeing his growing discomfort. So Dylan quickly showed them the kitchenette and the classrooms before he stopped before the last door, the only one that was usually even partially closed. Adam noticed first. \"Son, why is your name on the door?\" It was simply a piece of paper that Hannah had taped to the door, but it did the job just the same as any plaque would have. \"Because, I, um,\" God, help me out here! \"I'm kind of the pastor here. Of sorts. I'm not ordained.\" Another deep breath. \"But for the past few months, I've felt called to preach. So, a couple of months ago, I started this place with the help of Jon Rodgers, Jade, and Tyler. And then Hannah and Leon just recently got more involved too. I'm sorry that I didn't tell you before now – really, really sorry that I didn't.\" Seeing their stun-gunned expressions, Dylan suggested, \"Why don't we go back to the sanctuary? There's enough seats in there for all of us. I can explain more in there before the service starts.\" \"'Service'?\" Adam repeated. Dylan nodded. \"One service on Tuesday nights and two on Saturdays.\" \"So… you're going to preach tonight?\" Adam asked as they walked back into the sanctuary. \"Yep.\" Dylan answered with a sigh. \"Well,\" Adam sat down in a folding chair beside Victoria and across from Dylan. \"I can't say that I appreciate being lied to, and I'm still not sure why you didn't just tell your mother and me about all of this, but…\" Adam looked around at the mission. \"I will say that I'm proud of you for taking this on.\" Dylan blinked in surprise. He hadn't expected that last part, not yet anyway. \"Thanks.\" He smiled a little. \"That means a lot.\" Adam smiled back at him. \"Hey, Dylan!\" All three of the Mitchells jumped in surprise when someone called from down the hallway, having just come in through the outdoor entrance. \"We're in the sanctuary, Leon.\" Dylan called back. \"We come bearing good equipment, and great girlfriends.\" Hannah's voice floated to the Mitchells as she came into the sanctuary ahead of her brother. But Dylan still didn't miss the protective look that flashed through Leon's eyes as he entered the room at Hannah's use of the word \"girlfriend.\" It had recently become apparent that Leon didn't know what to think of Hannah's employ of the label any more than Dylan did. Then Dylan's attention was caught by the video camera that Hannah held and the camera stand that Leon was toting. \"What's that for?\" \"Uh, Dylan,\" Hannah caught his eye worriedly, and only then did Dylan remember that his parents were next to him. \"Should we come back later?\" \"Nah,\" Adam answered for his son. \"You're fine. I think that we're done talking about it for now.\" He nodded towards Leon. \"Is this your brother?\" \"Yes, sir.\" Leon shifted the stand to one arm and stepped forward to shake Adam's hand. \"Nice to meet you.\" \"Nice to meet you too.\" \"What's the video stuff for?\" Dylan asked. \"The YouTube channel that you guys talked me into, I guess?\" \"Exactly.\" Hannah replied. \"Where'd you get it?\" Dylan asked, taking the camera off of her hands and examining it. Leon answered with a smile, \"I saw it at a yard sale yesterday for twenty bucks. I told the woman that it was for a church and she gave it to me for a quarter of the price.\" \"Cool.\" \"It feels like we're ready to really start going places now, doesn't it?\" Leon asked. \"Yeah,\" Dylan grinned a little over his shoulder, looking back at his parents. \"Yeah, it does.\" There should only be one more chapter left to this story, possibly two. Sorry if the writing seems not up to my usual standards somehow. It kinda feels like it to me for some reason. And I know that it's an unusual plot (and now an unusually named mission), but please, if you review, no flames. I hope that you enjoy this story! Thanks, guys (and girls)! Also, if you feel like checking it out, I recently put a poll up on my page to decide what story to work on after this one is finished.:)[Chapter 12] \"So,\" Dylan made his way over to where Jade and the Carson twins were talking quietly together after the service. \"Are you guys happier with me now that you've seen my parents here?\" \"Yes.\" Leon answered. Jade smiled at him. \"Oh, absolutely.\" \"Hannah?\" Dylan asked when she didn't reply. \"I'll tell you later,\" she answered, slipping away from the group to go talk to Gemma. Dylan looked after her in confusion before turning to Leon in hopes of getting a reason for her giving him such an odd reply. Her brother only shrugged. Dylan shook his head to clear his thoughts before he brought up what was on his mind. \"Anyway, I had a thought a few minutes ago.\" \"Those are always dangerous.\" Leon broke in. Dylan smirked before continuing on undeterred, \" Anyway , what do you think of inviting the Resolution guys and their families to come to church a little earlier than usual tomorrow, and then we can show them this place before the Sherwood service?\" The question had been largely directed at Jade, and she was the one who answered it, admitting, \"I was going to suggest it if you didn't.\" Dylan smiled, adding a quick nod. \"Glad to see that we're all on the same page again.\" \"That makes two of us.\" Jade agreed. Leon declared, \"Hannah and I make four.\" \"Hey, Dylan, wait up!\" Hannah called out to him as he was on his way towards his parents' truck later on. He stopped in the parking lot, which now contained only two vehicles – the Mitchells' and the Carson's – and waited for her to catch up with him. \"Yeah?\" \"I never told you what I thought of you telling everybody about the mission.\" \"No, you didn't.\" He slipped an arm carefully around her shoulders. \"So, what do you think.\" She surprised him, popping up on her tiptoes to kiss him quickly on the cheek before whispering in his ear, \"I'm very happy.\" He smiled down at her. \"Me, too.\" He paused, giving her shoulders a gentle squeeze. \"Me, too.\" Wednesday evening, Dylan shifted nervously from foot to foot as he watched the Martinez family pull into the church parking lot. Everyone else was already at the church. He swallowed nervously; there would be no backing out now. Hannah slid up to his side, the same way that she had on his first time preaching at Newton-Crosby. \"Everything is gonna be fine, Dylan, you'll see.\" \"You hope.\" Dylan replied, feeling jittery. \"No,\" Hannah corrected, eyebrows rising slightly. \"I pray. Do you?\" Dylan laughed. \"You have no idea how much.\" \"Then as long as you believe that our God answers the prayers of His children, everything will turn out just fine.\" \"What if His answer is 'I have problems for you to go through'?\" \"Then he has problems for us to go through, and we would go through those problems for a reason. Besides, you're just speaking hypothetically, anyway.\" \"You wanna know what I think?\" he asked. \"What do you think?\" \"I think that maybe you should've been the preacher instead of me.\" Hannah only laughed as Adam and Victoria led the group up to the two teenagers. \"Ready, Dylan?\" Jade asked. Dylan smiled beyond his nervousness. \"Absolutely.\" He turned on his heel, taking Hannah's hand in his as he went towards the church with the others following behind the two of them. \"Ladies and gentlemen, please keep your arms and legs inside of the machine at all times. Thank you!\" Hannah looked at him, giving him the sort of look that would have accompanied her slapping her forehead good-naturedly had they been around less people. That nervous? , she mouthed. He nodded, the movement almost unnoticeable it was so minute. Breathe, she reminded. And pray , he added silently. She smiled at that as they led their group to the outside entrance of the mission and then inside of said mission. The expected question – \"What is this place?\" – came from Nathan. \"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I welcome you to the Newton-Crosby Baptist Mission.\" Dylan turned and addressed his \"tour group\" as he led them towards the sanctuary. \"It was founded two months ago by Tyler Fuller, Jade Hayes, and Dylan Mitchell, who just so happens to be the pastor.\" Startled expressions instantly combined with those of confusion, shock, and downright disbelief and criticism. None of the reactions surprised the young preacher, though. He continued on, \"Recently we've added the Carson twins to our core group, Leon-\" Here Dylan gestured into one of the classrooms, where Leon was currently sitting, working with the recording of the previous night's message on the computer. Leon looked up from his work and smiled, waving a little and saying \"hi\" before turning his attention back to his task. \"-And, of course,\" Dylan said, \"The lovely pastor's wife of sorts, Hannah.\" Hannah blushed as Leon called out to him from the classroom that they had by now advanced past, \"I object!\" Dylan grinned, rolled his eyes, and was relieved to see some of the others in the group doing the same, loosening up as well. It looked like this might turn out alright after all. But it ended up turning out even better than he had even dreamed it would when, come the Saturday morning service, the entire group returned to attend the service and hear him preach. As he looked out over the crowd that had gathered in the Newton-Crosby Baptist Mission, Dylan couldn't help but wonder if this was what it felt like for a runner when his race, his mission, was complete and he knew that he had done a good job. But it wasn't even comparable, really, he realized. After all, his mission had only just begun. Okay, this story is now over, and - per my poll - I am going to be writing a companion piece to my Criminal Minds three-shot \"Care\" as my next project. Said piece will most likely be entitled, \"Handle With Care.\" As it is, I know that The Mission kind of turned out to be pretty much one big ball of fluff, but I hope that you guys liked it anyway! Reviews always equal love and are still better then candy (and usually less fattening, too)! My poll is now officially closed (at least for a while) if you want to check out the results, it's still on my page. Thanks for reading this story!

Disclaimer: I only own the horsesnand people I make up. Chapter One: Desert Sun My name is Desert Sun. I come from a long line of wildnmustangs. Actually, my father wasn't so wild for a portion of hisnlife. His name was Hidalgo, and he was a strong, striking paint, thenhorse who shared a joint leadership of our herd, along with mynmother, a bright bay mare named Ember. I was the first of my father's foals. nI was a paint paint like my father, but with golden palomino patchesninstead of dark sorrel, like Hidalgo. The sun would make my coatnalmost glow, like the desert sun, hence my name. I am a Mustang. And this is my story. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I was born in early spring, in a rockynmountain area, a day's treck away from my herd. Ember was a quiet,nprivate mare, the kind who didn't want her foal to be born in frontnof all the herd. Plus, she had experience. I was her fifth foal,nher first to be born to Hidalgo. The stallion had acquired five ofnhis six mares last year, so all five were heavy with foal. Before she came to Hidalgo, Embernbelonged to a harsh stallion, who didn't treat his mares right. Innfact, my mother's first foal was born in the open, and the littlenfilly's own father murdered her. That's why Ember didn't trustnstallions. I remember the place I was actuallynborn in very faintly. It was in a cave, with nothing, not even batsninside. I remember it being cold on my delicate, rubbery babynhooves, and slippery. But Ember was wise. She knew that neithernstallions nor heat could get to me in here. We were to stay here my first night,nthen be off, back to the herd, for it was never good for a mare whonjust foaled to be alone. As strong as Ember was, even shencouldn't fight off a rogue stallion. There were three differrent types ofnstallion that I knew off. Bachelors, who were relatively harmless tonstrong stallions like my father, band stallions, the ones with anfamily, like Hidalgo, and rogues. Rogues were like bachelors, ornwere former band stallions, who were murderous and would attack anynhorse in sight. Boulder was a rogue. I saw the steel gray stallion on mynvery first day of life. He came trotting up to the cave, snortingnbecause he had smelled Ember's journey here. She backed mye up as far as we couldngo, hoping that he couldn't smell us at this angle. Thankfully, he couldn't and trottednaway. Boulder was a leggy, strong stallion. nI thought that my father could take him on, but not many othernstallions could. He would kill a foal like me if hencould. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The next morning, Ember roused me mynnudging my shoulder sharply, snorting. It was time to go home, backnto the herd. The journey would be a bit hard for anyoung foal like me, but I endured it. Many horses had treaded thisnpath, and I could smell Boulder's own scent, mixed with the muskynscent of rogues. I wrinkled my nose in disgust, and followed Ember. She stopped very rarely on the trip toneat a bit of grass and let me nurse, but it was so rare that I wasnalmost always hungry that day. Every now and then, she would snort atnsomething or prick her ears at it, showing me things that were new tonmy world. I knew that Ember was very wise, fornshe was the lead mare of my father's herd. Lead mares are thensmartest and strongest in the herd, with the most knoweledge. Evennthough Ember wasn't the oldest, she was the wisest mare in the herd. My ears pricked with interest as wenneared the herd late that night. They were grazing, maybe someneating, and my father was gazing out into the night, ever vigilant. Ember gave a long whinny to announcenthat we were nearing, and trotted happily down. I followed, excitednthat I would meet my herd for the first time. Hidalgo pranced up, running his muzzlenacross Ember's body, making sure she was all right. He then turnednto me. All he could see was my head, because Ember was shielding mynbody. Two legs say I have a nice head, like an 'Arab', but isngolden, with a blaze like my mother, and a two-toned forelock. Hidalgo gently reached down and touchednhis nose to mine. He was a huge, strong stallion, and I look a lotnlike him. I am Hidalgo's son. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A week after I was born, one marendisappeared like my mother had. When she came back, there was ansturdy dun filly at her side, who's only marking was a snip at thenend of her muzzle. The bossy filly's name was Queenie, mynhalf-sister. Once she loosened up a bit, Queenie was fun to playnwith, but she rarely did. But a couple days after Queenie camenMudslide. The plump dark brown colt was mischeivous and, well,nslightly foolish, but for the next few months, none of the othernmares were due to foal, so he and Queenie were my playmates. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- When I was three weeks old, Queenie,nMudslide and I were wandering around when we came upon a horridnsight. A dead horse. He held the scent of a bachelor, and Incould see two pinpricks where a rattler had bitten him. Mudslide andnQueenie were nervously squealing, but I was silent. Still, ournmothers and Hidalgo came over. Hidalgo walked over to me, and noddedntoward the corpse. My father was teaching me a lesson. Only the strong live in our world. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well? My first Hidalgo fic... Rnand R! El[Chapter 2] Descendants:nDesert Sun Summary: The first in a series ofnfics about the lives of Hidalgo's descendants. Hidalgo's first foal,na colt named Desert Sun, is a gorgeous palomino pinto, and very wild.n But can Sun's spirit survive the perils of the wild? And even morendangerous, humans? Disclaimer: I only own the horsesnand people I make up. Chapter Two: Losing andnGaining I watched Red Rock, the newest foal innthe herd, with suspicion. The colt was ill-tempered, and I didn'tnlike him one bit, not to mention that Queenie was spending all of herntime with him, completely snubbing Mudslide and I. Red Rock was a sorrel with a white manenand tail, not a common color. If he had been a bit lighter, with anbit more of a gold color to him, he would have been a palomino, butnthe sorrel tone was obvious. Mudslide stamped at the ground, tossingnhis stubby foal mane. We were a month old now, and our manes andntails were still fluffy and not at all like the adult horses'. Hidalgo was nervously walking around,nhis head bobbing up and down. Sage, a low-ranking mare, had gone offnto foal four days ago, and still wasn't back. I understood hisnworry. Sometimes, when a mare went off to foal, she got stolen bynanother stallion. Not only did this happen, but when the foal wasnborn, the already high mortality rate went through the roof. When anfoal that isn't theirs is born, stallions may kill them. Even my own father may do that. You could call it the mustang law. nSurvival of the fittest. The stallion would want his own foals tonlive, and the outsider foal, in his eyes, didn't deserve to live. I dropped my head and nibbled a bit atnthe grass, then tossed my head up, snorting with disgust. Foals likenme often sampled grass and water, but weren't weaned till around sixnto eight months, if our mothers were in foal. If she wasn't,nshe might nurse us till we were yearlings. I had seen my father agitated, chasingnsome of the mares, and I could tell that most, if not all, would benin foal for next year, including the new mare. A shy scent hit my nostrils, and Inimmediatly recognized Sage. Turning, my heart sank when I saw thenfoal at her side. It was a little filly... an albino. Her skin wasnbaby pink, her eyes were glassy, and her coat was a pristine white. nAlbinos, with their sensitive skin, often don't make it pastnfoalhood. They sunburn easily, and skin cancer is a constant threat.n Plus, their pale coats are a beacon to any predators. As Hidalgo herded Sage back, I couldntell that the mare had had a hard foaling. Sweat was still clingingnto her coat, making it hard, her eyes were tired, her gait wasnstrange... The albino's name was Whinny, for hernincessant calling to other horses, and she was the outcast. Red Rocknand Queenie refused to be around her, and she shied away from me, fornI was the most dominant foal in the herd. Dominant foals are strongnand big. They have good senses. When they're colts, they usuallynhave the most potential of being a band stallion. Red Rock had the same potential, evennat such a young age. That worried me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- When I was two months old, I noticednsomething different about Mudslide. He was weak. And was gettingnthinner, because of constant bouts of diarrhoea. His mother could donnothing about it. His eyes were dull, and his dark brown coat wasnlosing it's glossy sheen. He was limping every now and then, justnout of weakness, and I had a bad feeling that he wouldn't get better. One day, I found him rolling around onnthe ground, squealing in pain. I tossed my head and whinnied. He was colicking. Colic is a strange ailment. It'snactually mainly a description of stomach pain, that can be fatal, ornjust a stomach ache. In Mudslide's case, I was pretty surenthat it wasn't a stomach ache. The herd gathered aoung nervously, eyesnwatching. Finally, eyes wide and rolling, Mudslide drew a final,nshaky breath. A long spasm ran through his body, and he wasndead.(a/n: To tell people who don't know, Mudslide had Strongylosis. nHe was infested by a type of red worm called Strongylus Vulgaris .n This is a fatal condition if not treated, and horses can get it justnby grazing. The symptoms are: Diarrhoea, loss of condition, colic,nand anemia. Just so that any horse owners know) My best friend was dead. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Not far away from us was another band,nled by Cardinal, a red roan stallion, and his lead mare, Dusty. I had been a bit sad ever sincenMudslide's death. Queenie seemed to not really even acknoweldge it,nwhich I thought was cruel. Mudslide had been her best friend, andnall she did was hang around with Red Rock, and kick and nip at poornWhinny. Finally, one day I heard soft hoofbeatsncoming up, and a sweet scent came. Turning, I saw one of Cardinal'sndaughters. She was a silver dapple, with knee-high stockings on eachnleg, as well as a white mane and tail. Her eyes were extremelynunusual, a pale sky blue. I was pretty sure that she was a monthnyounger than me It was not unheard of that lonely foalsnfrom different herds played together. Cardinal only had three mares,nand the only other mare that had been pregnant had given birth to anstillborn, so this filly had no playmates. Slowly, she touched her nose to mine,nand we breathed in each other's scent, as is custom with horses. Her name was Summer Sky. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I galloped at Sky's side, joyful at thenfeeling of the wind around me. She gave a high, happy whinny. Over the past few days, Sky and I hadnbecome very close. We played many foal games together, and she wasnfun-loving. Our fathers were rivals, but theyndidn't mind terribly. At the time, they weren't being too aggresive. Who knew that in losing a friend, Inwould gain an even closer one? Queenie and Red Rock hated Sky, andnWhinny was simply too timid to do anything about making friends. Out of breath, we slowed to a halt andnstood, side by side. She turned and nibbled at my withers, engagingnin mutual grooming, a bonding past time for horses. I copied her,nand time passed. Desert Sun and Summer Sky. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- To be honest, I think that a foalnis the cutest thing in the world, tied with puppies. But this storynwill follow Sun's story till he's around five or six years old, justnto tell you guys.[Chapter 3] Chapter Three: Weaning and Winter When I was around six months old,nsomething strange happened. At that time, I had no idea what weaningnwas, and didn't even know that Ember was pregnant again. Red Rocknand Whinny were still too young too wean, but Queenie was the rightnage. I was the first to experience it. On anhot September day, I was feeling hungry after a race with Summer Sky.n Ember was grazing nearby. She didn't look any different, for hernpregnancy wasn't showing yet. Blowing through my nostrils, I walkednover to her side and dipped my head low... A sharp nip on my flank brought me tonjerk my head up. Ember was glaring at me. I tossed my head angrilynat her, wondering why she did that, and lowered my head again. Once again, a nip, this time sharper,nand accompanied by a snort of anger. This time, I was a bit slower,nbut that was the final straw for Ember. She simply bit me, drawing antiny bit of blood. I backed a few steps, giving a highnwhinny. Why was my mother doing this to me? I looked into Ember'sneyes, and I saw anger there, but it was with sadness as well. Shenblinked her amberish eyes at me, and lowered her head again. I crept up behind her-I was hungry!-,nmaking sure not to make a sound. But Ember, being the skilled horsenshe is, knew I was there. This time, she cocked a leg. Surely ,nI thought, She wouldn't kick me. But this time, as I got closer, Embernraised the leg and thudded me soundly in the chest. I tossed my headnand squealed. Not because of anger. I had been a bit ofntrouble. Not of pain. The kick had taken the breath out of me, butnhadn't been painful at all. It was a squeal of sadness. Somethingnwas wrong with the strong bond that a mare and her foal have. I still attempted again and again thatnday, and I still got a few kicks, and nips as well. Every now andnthen, I would glance at my father or the other mares for help, butnthey only looked on, as if interested. Finally, a few hours later, I gave upnfor the day. Slowly, tired, not without a few bruises, I layndown.(a/n: I know, I know, horses sleep standing up. But actually,nfoals can until they're too big, and adults can occasionally) My coat was soaked with sweat, and Inwas terribly hungry. A soft nicker came, and I felt breath on mynmane. Summer Sky lay down beside me, and layed her head on my back. nI nibbled at the grass, not really liking its taste much. But at least I had Summer Sky. Shenwould always be there. So I thought. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It took nearly a week to get me fullynweaned, but I finally gave up. Around that time, Queenie began hernweaning. I watched as she did the same thing as I had, only evennworse. It was a sad sight, but I couldn't help feeling like she wasnfinally getting some sort of punishment for being so ill-temperedntoward Summer Sky and I. I knew that I wasn't completelynunlinked to my mother. I would need her until I was ten months old. nBut I realized that, in weaning, part of the bond we shared was beingnloosened. I felt terribly sorry for Summer Sky, who would be weanednin a month. Time passed. I knew that soon enough,nwinter would come. And when it did, it depened on the weather if mynherd stayed here or left. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- When I was seven months old, somethingnstrange happened. Red Rock disobeyed the hiarchy. I calmly grazed, used to the grass bynnow, even liking it. That's when I got a sharp nip at my heels. nWhirling around, I found five month old Red Rock, who had anmischeivous look on his face. Deciding to give him some slack, Inresumed grazing without even a snort. Again, I was nipped. Again,nand again, and again. Until I had had it. With a whinny of anger, I began chasingnhim at a full gallop, my ears laced back with fury. Red Rock, with ansqueal, galloped away, and behind his mother. I snorted at him. This colt would bentrouble. I knew it. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As the months past, it grew colder. Myncoat began thickening, as did the coats of every other horse. Then, one day, in early December, itncame. My first snow. I was looking kind of scrappy in mynwinter coat, but Summer Sky, who was trotting over to me, looked likena silver cloud. I looked up into the clouds, when a snowflake fell,nand landed right on my muzzle. Snorting, I shook my head at the bitterncold. Sky nickered in amusement, and I felt embarrassed. I turned my head to see Hidalgonwatching us, a fond look on his face. But that look was mixed withnworry. Sometimes, herds move to better grounds in the fall, innpreparation for winter, but I could see that he hadn't anticipatednmuch snow. That was the biggest mistake he evernmade. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- About a week later, that little showernhad turned into a full blown blizzard. I closed my eyes for a momentnat the sleet that was hitting my face. Ember, though at nine months,nI wasn't all that close to her, sidled up to protect me, her stomachnnow noticebaly larger. Poor Whinny's delicate skin was beingntorn by the harsh weather, and Red Rock and Queenie still didnnothing. Summer Sky wasn't doing all that wellneither, and I had to choose a foal to help. Whinny, who was in my own herd, was mynown half-sister, or Summer Sky, my best friend. You can guess who I chose. I trudged through the snow and pressednmy side close up against Sky, who was shivering pitifully, her whiteneyeslashes frozen. I nickered and nuzzled the side of her head, notnlooking at Whinny, who's own mother's winter coat hadn't developednwell enough to help any horse but herself. I looked around and saw Queenie and RednRock side by side like Sky and I. They were feebly nibbling at thenfrozen grass below, which really didn't help much.My mother was mynfather's favorite mare, so he was close up to her. Finally, that night, Sky nuzzled me innthanks, and walked over to her mother. Little did I know, that maynbe the last time I ever saw her. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Early in the morning, my father herdednus all together, and Ember took the lead. We began walking up andnout of the valley, and I knew we were leaving for the winter. Inlooked down to see Sky with her herd, sleeping. I may never see her again . --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aw, poor Sun... I would like tonmake it clear that the next story in this series will be called,n'Painted Freedom' so please don't take that name, any reviewers,nsince it'll obviously be the name of a horse...[Chapter 4] Hey, just wanted to let it benknown that I have all of the horses in the future of this seriesnplanned out, and let me tell you something: This is gonna be a LONGnseries. Chapter Four: Whinny I had no idea where we were going. Thenonly horses who may were my parents, and to be honest, I'm not evennsure if they did. I was lonely. Ember was busy leadingnthe herd, Hidalgo was at the back, nipping at stragglers(a/n: I HATEnit when people always assume that stallions always run at the head ofnthe herd like they do in movies...), and of course, the other foalsnwere never around to play. Foals were kept in the middle of thenherd, since all of us were old enough to be away from our mothers'nsides at all times. I was constantly worried for poornWhinny. She would never make it through, I thought. She was so weaknand tiny... But time passed, and she stayednalive... Barely. To keep myself entertained, I kept mynthoughts on Summer Sky. I hoped that she was alright. I wished thatnI had time to say goodbye. What had she thought when she found thatnI was gone? Was she worried, was she sad, or angry... But thenscariest thing to think of was: Maybe she was glad. I didn't know why, I just knew that itnwould affect me a lot if she felt that way. Surely she wouldnnever... But maybe... No! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Time passed, and we trudged on. nWhinny's condition worsened. She was coughing, breathing hard, justnnot responding to her mother trying to stroke her with her tongue... And finally, one night, I decided thatnI couldn't ignore her. The wind was blowing, and snow wasnfalling. Red Rock and Queenie were, once again, huddled up together,nand once again, Whinny was alone. I walked over to her and nickered. Shenlooked up with her glassy eyes, fear mixed with curiosity andnfriendliness. My heart filled with sympathy. Poor filly. Sevennmonths old, and still no friends. I sidled up to her, knowing thatnthis may help a bit. Whinny snorted, then sighed. She was shivering, just in the cold. Ansoft nicker came from behind me, and I looked up and saw my father, anlook of pride on his face. I was helping a horse who needed it. Inwas making him proud. The night went on, and Whinny grewnweaker. I knew that my attempts were futile... ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I woke the next morning, and foundnthat Whinny had collapsed in the snow, dead. I stared at her, andnthen heard soft crunching behind me. There was Sage. I felt so bad. The look on her face asnshe nosed her filly, that sadness... I had failed. But a muzzlenrubbed against my ear, and I knew my father was proud. Sage mourned for the rest of thenmorning, and finally, Hidalgo couldn't let her anymore. He nippednher to get her to move, but she whirled around to bite him, anger onnher face. He laced his ears back, and after much 'persuasion' Sagenwas back into the herd. But I knew that she was still mourning. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Time passed, and we went on. I thinknthat my sire finally had an idea about where we were going, so thatnassured us all. Finally, after a month of traveling, wencame upon it. A little valley that was safe from the harsh weather. nA place for the herd to stay. I watched as Ember visibly seemed tonlight up at the sight of this. Her stomach was swollen with a foalnsoon to be born in a couple months. I hoped that we wouldn't have to donthis next year. In our land, winter storms like that were rare. As I galloped down to the lush grass, Insaw Queenie and Red Rock grooming each other. And then, my gazenturned to Sage, who's head was low as she walked down. My heartnburned with anger. Those two... if they had just helped me... maybenWhinny would have lived... In my rage, I ran up and sank my teethninto Queenie's withers. The dun filly squealed in pain, and Red Rocknturned to try to kick me. I twisted out of his range, and looked himnstraight in the eyes. Horses communicate a lot with body language,nbut with their eyes as well. \"You can't fight me,\" Hisneyes said, \"Our father may punish you.\" I lashed my tail-which was no longernfluffy and foalish- in anger. \"Yes,\" My eyesnhissed, \"But one day, when we are older, I can promise younthis. I will make you pay for your ill deeds.\" But he simply whinnied in laughter andnturned back to Queenie. I turned, snorting, and found my fatherngazing at me. There was that pride in his eyes. He didn't like RednRock much either, something that was strange. I realized that there something I wasndetermined to do. I am Desert Sun. I will follow in my father'snhoofprints. I shall be great. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I don't know why, but I just LOVEnDesert Sun. Summer Sky too, poor Whinny as well...[Chapter 5] Descendants:nDesert Sun Summary: The first in a series ofnfics about the lives of Hidalgo's descendants. Hidalgo's first foal,na colt named Desert Sun, is a gorgeous palomino pinto, and very wild.n But can Sun's spirit survive the perils of the wild? And even morendangerous, humans? Disclaimer: I only own the horsesnand people I make up. Chapter Five: Reunion I lifted my head and tossed my mane. Anfew days ago, I became a yearling. I was no longer foalish-lookingnat all. But kind of awkward and adolescent. Queenie was a yearlingnas well, but Red Rock was still a foal, something I just loved to rubnin. I trotted over to him and looked him innthe eye.(a/n: Red Rock will be bold , and Desert Sun'll be boldnitalics ) Hello, youngster. Don't call me that. Too bad, little colt Well... where's your beloved mother?n If she dies, my mother'll surely be lead mare. I felt a shiver run down my spine. She's off foaling, you know that. That's what you want to think. Just at that moment, a familar highnwhinny came, and I whirled around on my heels. There was Ember, anlittle bay filly at her side. I raced up to meet her, my eyes shiningnat the thought of her return. She had taken longer than she had withnme. I just... I just wished that she hadnbeen able to foal in my homeplace. That's right. We still weren't home,nand it was March. I was desperate to see Summer Sky. But shovingnaway homesick thoughts, I turned back to the little foal. Her name was Brighty. Brighty. My sister. But when I camento explore her, I felt a sharp nip, and turned to find Ember's teethnbared at me. A mother is very protective of her foal, especiallynaround young colts like me. I swished my tail at her and resumedngrazing. Maybe, since there had been three foals born by now, wenwould move on. Maybe would go back to the homeplace... ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- One month later... Finally! We were heading back to thenhomeplace! I felt so much better now that the journey was in thenSpring, and I was a yearling. There was many an April shower comingndown, but they were light. And I had made a friend! Yes, I was very fond of my littlensister, Brighty. She was sweet, and always idolizing me, copyingneverything I did. But I couldn't focus on the poor thing,nfor all my thoughts were on... Summer Sky. Now that it wasn't in a winter storm,nthe journey took half the time, only two weeks, and I squealed innexcitement when the homeplace came into sight. I saw Cardinal's herd. And I saw a little silver dot grazing. Suddenly, it didn't matter if I wasnseparated from the herd. Giving a high whinny, I charged at fullnspeed down to the homeplace, her sweet scent flooding my senses. Atnmy second whinny, she raised her head and whinnied back, gallopingntoward me. Excitedly nickering, we nuzzled eachnother and breathed in each other's scent. Hidalgo gave me anreprimanding nip, but that was it. I struck at the ground, and sawnRed Rock glaring jealously at me. Summer Sky was no longer the foal I hadnbeen used to, but a gangly yearling like me. Her mane, tail, andnstockings were still pristine, though, and her eyes were, as always,nthe same color as the sky. Finally, we had a reunion. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Another month later, it was now May,nand Red Rock was a yearling as well. I was glaring at him. He wasnnipping and pestering my two-month-old sister, and I didn't like it. nEmber was grazing and didn't see it yet, but I did. With a shreik, I ran at him and strucknat him with hooves like flint. Angrily, Red Rock wheeled and kicked,nbut I twisted my body so that he missed. I sank my teeth into hisnflank and drew blood. Red Rock's eyes were blazing as henstruck me with a hoof, and I knew that this wasn't normal yearling'snplay for him either. Brighty was looking on, a look of horror on hernface, as I pounded Red Rock's side with a hoof. But before we got very far, Hidalgoncame between, snorting and shoving us away from each other. Red Rock clacked his teeth togethernlike a foal, but I arrogantly whirled around and loped away. Mynheart sank as I saw Summer Sky, who seemed to have watched the wholenthing. What would she think? Apparently, she thought it was anmagnificent and brave performance, for she excitedly pranced and gavena little buck, congratulating me. Oh, how good it was to be home. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I grazed contentedly as the sun set. nHow I loved the life of a mustang. It was so wild... so wonderful. nI had heard stories of horses that willingly obeyes two legs. nMy father had been one of them. Though, then again, in his heart, henhad always been wild. The thought of being tame... it scared andnsurprised me. What kind of horse would want to givenup their freedom? That's when I met Blue and saw the twonlegs for the first time in my life.[Chapter 6] I had to add in anton of dialogue to make this chapter clear. I hope you don't mind,nit's just that this is personification, so it was kinda needed. Chapter Six: Blue and the TwonLegs It happened on a hot July day as Skynand I were grooming each other. A strange scent came to us. It wasnof a fully-grown male horse, but not a stallion. And it was mixednwith the scent of... two legs . Sky jerked her head and pricked hernears. Her pure white tail swished back and forth in agitation. Inwished that we hadn't strayed from the herd... That's when a good-natured snortnreached our ears, and an elderly horse lumbered up to us. The horsenin front of us was probably in his twenties, and all black except forna gray face and a small patch of white on his withers. He was innsurprisingly good shape, but something was wrong. He wore a strange, lumpy thing on hisnback, and a ropish contraption was twisted around his head. Butnworst of all was a cruel-looking metal bar in his mouth, which madenhim foam a bit. He gazed at us in a mystified way, andnSky and I stared. Finally, his eyes told all. (a/n: The gelding is bold, Sun is bold italics , and Sky is italics ) So. It is true. What's true? Ssh, Sun, he's probably one of thosentwo leg pets! I am not a pet! And you two are- I ignored him and stomped a foot,nlooking at Sky. You mean one of those... smugnlittle things that lets two legs onto their backs? Yes. Isn't he strange looking? nWith all that stuff on him, and how fat he is! Think about whatnwould happen if we were that plump? Cougars would probably eat us fornbreakfast! Wait, The two leg pet saidncrossly, Can I say something? We nodded. Oh, and what do you mean by 'it isntrue'? About you. What? Wild nags. Range rats. All right, I had it with this strangenand rude horse. I charged at him and reared, almost ready to plungendown on him, when Sky ran over. Stop. He obviously has no ettiquete Me? Have no ettiquete, told this byna little rang rat! Well. This time, I wheeled and kicked him,nbiting and drawing blood. The horse squealed. I brought my facenclose to his. That's how we 'range rats' fight.n And you insulted Summer Sky. That doesn't go by without punishmentnwhen you're around me. OK, OK! I'll tell you what's goingnon. Fine. Now. My name is Blue. I've lived withnhumans all my life- Humans? What's a... human? You know! Er... no, I don't. Fine. Those creatures who wearnthing like skins a lot, and have the fire-sticks? Ah. You mean two legs. I guess. Anyway, I have lived withnthem all my life, and have heard stories of wild horses. Like yountwo. Living on your own. Stupid, if you ask me. I snorted. Tell me this, two leg pet. Havenyou ever felt freedom? Run by yourself, not enclosed, find your ownnfood, have a band and foals? Silence. I didn't think so. Look, I'm sorry if I was rude. I'mnjust kind of worried. A rabbit spooked me, and I threw my human, sonI've lost him! I had to hold back a snort, and Skyncouldn't. A rabbit spooked you? Please. You mean, they don't faze younyoungsters? Try being chased by coyotes,nstalked by cougars, and murdered by rogues. Sun, what if we take him back tonyour herd for a while? Just a while... Why not yours? You know that Cardinal doesn't takenin strays... What's a 'herd'? This'll take a while. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Now, I instructed Blue, Keep your head low, eyes down, answer what he asks, and make itnclear that you're a 'gelding' not a stallion. Whatever a gelding is. Oh, and do the same with Ember,nSun's mother. Why? Respect! Honor as well...nHaven't you ever heard of the Mustang Law? What is the 'band leader''s namenanyway? And yours', as a matter of fact! My name is Desert Sun, this isnSummer Sky, and my father's name is Hidalgo. Wait! Hidalgo, the horse who wonnthe Ocean of Fire? Yes! Now, stay away from thenother two yearlings, Red Rock and Queenie. They'll hate you. I watched as the herd milled around tonlook at Blue. I looked away from Ember's questioning gaze. Hidalgo pranced up and sniffed Bluenover, circling him. The gelding obeyes my orders, and finally, thenverdict was in. Blue could stay. For a while. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- On Blue's third day here, somethingnhappened. I heard a strange whooping noise as Ingrazed with Sky, and looked around to see where it was coming from. My father suddenly gave a stallion'snbugle and began to drop his head low, snaking the herd together. nCardinal was doing the same. I was about to obey the call, when Insaw Blue running towards the noise. Blue! I think I heard my human's voice! Sighing in frustration, I gallopednafter him. Sun! He's just an old two leg pet,nnot worth it! Sky, what if they're not hisnhumans? They may hurt him! I won't let another horse die likenMudslide or Whinny! Fine, but I'm going with you! I heard her hoofbeats behind me. Partnof me wanted to tell her to go back, but part of me rejoiced that shenwanted to protect me... Blue ran to the top of the hill, and wenfollowed. And found a gruesome sight. A blanket appaloosa two year old fillynwas being chased by two legs on their pets. The two legs were doingntheir version of whinnies and whirling ropes over their heads. The poor filly was desperately tryingnto run away, but one fast bay was hot on her heels. Sweat hadngathered on her withers, and the pets were frothing at the mouth. It all happened so strangely. A rope was tossed around the filly'snneck. She was jerked back and brought to the ground, still trying tonrun. More ropes were tossed around her body till she was a heavingnmess. No. No! I reared up silently, surpressing anwhinny to keep us safe. Sky was trembling all over. But there was anproblem. Blue looked at us calmly. What's wrong? I stared. That! They just... hurt thatnfilly! No they didn't. Maybe some minorninjuries, but it's a wild horse round up. I've been in many. His face suddenly lit up. My human! And he just ran off. Without even anthank you. I shall never become Blue. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I hope that was a look into annold fashioned roundup by another mustang's POV. Hope it was thoughtnprovoking. R and R![Chapter 7] Inwould like to make it clear that the name of the sequel of this booknshall be changed to- Painted Freedom: Great Spirit Horse Chapter Seven:nMy World Collapses I remember thenSpring in which I turned two years old clearly. The way I knew itnwas different was by the way Hidalgo watched me so closely, the way Inhad the urge to drive Red Rock away. Brighty was now anyearling, and much less gangly than I had been, still more petite. Inwatched her as she drank from the creek. That's when I heard anstallion's whinny behind me. Whirling around, Infound Hidalgo glaring at me for some unknown reason. He then lacednhis ears back and charged. Not sure what to do, I stood my ground,nand got a hard blow to the shoulder. This, unlike Ember's kicks, was painful. Now angry by mynfather's assualt, I fought back by striking at him with a hoof andnhitting his chest. I was then stunned by myself. That had been anvery disrespectful move... But Hidalgo simplyndug his teeth into my neck, and I knew that this wasn't a battle Incould win. Quickly, I wheeled around and began to run. I heardnHidalgo chasing after me. A thought came. nOnce again, I had been unable to say goodbye to Summer Sky, and thisntime, she would probably be stolen by a band stallion before I sawnher again. All two year olds, I later realized, including thenfillies, are cast out of the herd to keep inbreeding away. That'snwhat my father was doing. But as I gallopednaway from the homeplace, away from the herd, I felt awful. I wouldnprobably never see Ember again, never Hidalgo, never Brighty. Never Summer Sky. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My father didn'tnstray far from the herd, in fear that they would get stolen. But Inknew not to go back. If I did... there was a chance that I would benkilled in the next battle. But I felt so...nvulnerable without the herd. I was sure what had happened to thenappaloosa filly would happen to me, now. I didn't have anyone. Manynstallions set out to find bachelor bands, but I wanted, no, needed to find Summer Sky. But after threenweeks on my own, I wondered... I lowered my head tontake a drink from the river. This was the first source of water Inhad seen in two days, so I was greedy. That's when I heard thenfamilar snort behind me... Queenie! I whirled around tonfind the dun filly standing there. She, at first, seemed surprisednthat it was me, but then rejoiced as well. I didn't see Red Rocknanywhere, so I was guessing that they were separated. Because ofnthis, we acted like when we were friends again, as if nothing hadnever happened. But there was still a rift... She wasn't SummernSky. As Queenie and Intraveled together, it wasn't like we were a band. No, we were halfnsiblings, close friends. I still felt too young to actually be anreal band stallion. I one day looked inna pond at my reflection. I had changed from a gangly yearling, to anstill adolscent, but more powerful, two year old colt. This was sonstrange, being on my own with only Queenie as a companion. I had always thoughtnthat if it came down to it, Sky would have been my companion forntraveling. Who knew that it would be a horse who was once the bestnfriend of my worst enemy? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I had a feeling thatnthe partnership between Queenie and I wouldn't last long. She was antwo year old filly, prime game to a stallion. The only thing thatnreally topped that was a three year old, for they're in betterncondition to breed. Too bad she didn'tnrealize it. I woke in thenmorning to her squeals, and turned to see her being snaked away bynRam, the flea bitten gray stallion. I gave Queenie a look. Shenshould have been more wise. I was not about to fight anothernstallion yet. Not for her, atnleast. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My nostrils flarednat the scent of two legs. This was not good at all. But as Incarefully went to see what was going on, I discovered a differentnkind of two leg. He had a boardish thing on, and a tablet with manyndifferent colors on in. He was simplyndipping a thing that was like a miniature tail in the colors, andnmarking the board! What a foolish little two leg, I snortednto myself, To fiddle with things like that, and put himself inndanger. Suddenly, the twonleg looked around his board and saw me. He gasped in awe, and busilynput down the board and got a new one, beginning the process all overnagain. I realized that this plump little man couldn't hurt me, andnstood there, watching him, for a while. Finally, afternaround an hour, the man turned the board around to show me hisnfinished product. It was... me! The man had made a marking of me! nI couldn't help myself from nickering a him good-naturedly. Thisndidn't seem to be the kind of two leg that makes things collapse, butna good kind. As the days draggednon, I hung around him. He called me 'Sandy' a name I didn't reallynlike, but was alright with, since I knew my own. Once I had hungnaround the two leg for a week and a half, he suddenly began tonwalking toward me. In his hand was a loop of rope. I should have beennmore suspicious. \"Ssh, it's allnright, Sandy,\" He said in a low voice. I stood still. Till henbegan to put the rope around my neck, that is. I reared up,nsquealing, and struck out with my forehooves. The two leg coverednhis face with his hands, and yelled. \"No,nSandy!\" But it was too late. He had angered me too much. nBut I really didn't mean to hit him. I was just out of control, andnone of my hooves hit him square in the head. Without anothernsound, he fell to the ground, still. Slowly, I sniffed him. Bloodntrickled from a gash in his forehead. He was dead. I had killed. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Four cowboys lopedntheir horses through the night, looking for the artist who had beennmissing for such a long time. He had been staying at their ranch, sonthey felt it was their repsonsibility. \"Look!\"nOne hissed suddenly, pointing. A large shape stood in the night overna lump. As they looked a bit closer, they saw that the lump was thenartist, dead. And as the moonlightnwas shed, they saw a magnificent young mustang, eyes wide, staring atnthem. \"A killer. Younknow what you have to do withnkillers.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Chapter 8] Chapter Eight: Splash I froze as my eyes fell on the four shadowy figures. Two legs, on top of their pets. Oh no... I stamped a back hoof on agitation. Maybe they hadn't seen me... One said something in a growly voice that reminded me of a coyote, his eyes glued onto me. And slowly, he raised a fire-stick. Before he could even shoot, I ran. The sounds of the pet's hooves sounded behind me. But all I could think about was: I had killed. A two leg. Two legs were the most feared predator among mustangs. They killed easily with their fire-sticks, and took away our freedom. They controlled the pets... everything. I heard one pet getting closer to me. That's when I turned my head. My eyes widened with disbelief. It was the appaloosa filly.(a/n: Sun will be bold italics, the filly bold ) You're the colt! Yes... I am. She tossed her black mane. I'll create a distraction, you run. Whatever you do, RUN. And with that, she squealed and halted, skidding to a stop, dirt being kicked up by her hooves. The two leg, who apparently didn't have a good hold, was tossed off. They'll be distracted, and these two leg-bred pets have weaker hooves. Now! But- Don't worry about me, just get away! With one last look at her, I went on. I could hear the two legs' cries of anger, and the pets squealing. But I did not hear the appaloosa. I hoped she was all right. Desperately. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The next morning, I had found a more woody area. I was kind of nervous, since it was harder for me to see predators in this dense cover. But my hearing was good, as was my sense of smell. Which was why I smelled the scent of horse. And heard that rustling sound. Carefully, I stepped deeper into the woods, and found none other than the appaloosa! Part of those ropes on her head were twisted around the branches of a tree, and she was caught. I pranced over and began to tug on the ropes with my teeth. She gave a snort of surprise, but pitched in till she was freed. Thank you, She snorted. I never thought I'd see you again. Me neither. I'm Desert Sun. The two legs called me Freckles, but my given name is Splash. Thank you. Thank you. You risked a lot. Yes, but I can't let another horse be stolen from the range. Especially not you. You're a free spirit. Her ears suddenly pricked up. You're Hidalgo's son, aren't you? I dipped my head. Yes. I was just cast out of my herd. You know. Ah, yes. So you're a loner? Need a companion? Yes. I'm looking for a friend of mine. Splash eyed me. A filly, huh? Well, yes... Look, Sun, you need to get into a bachelor band first. I haven't seen any, so you'll have to settle for me. I nodded, then saw something horrifying. On Splash's shoulder was an ugly burn, where all the hair was gone, in a strange shape. It's called a brand. That way, the two legs'll be able to know that I'm theirs. They burn it onto you. Brutes. I flinched at the thought of being burned so badly...(a/n: Some people still use the old-fashioned kind. I hate it, and my neighbor bought a gelding that already had it. Freeze brand is the way to go!) Splash lifted a hoof, and I saw a strange metal thing nailed onto it. These are 'shoes'. They are nailed onto your hooves. It doesn't hurt, but it isn't at all pleasant, being restrained like that... I couldn't see how anything the two legs did could be pleasant. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I watched as Splash drank from a pond. She then brought her head up and shook it, turning to me. Splash, how did the two legs capture you? Well... you saw it... No, how did they find you? Oh, Sun, it was awful. They found my band-I hadn't been cast out yet- and began to chase all of the yearlings and two year olds. My sire tried to snake us away to safety, but it was too late. They had cut me away from the others, and I was all alone. Then.. well, that was it. Two legs are terrible creatures. Yes. Some of them. But think of your father. I flinched. I preferred not to talk of my father's past... His two leg was kind. He even set him free. Don't trust most of them, though. Most want to take away our freedom. Forever. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Splash and I roamed together for the next few weeks, until I heard the whooping of two legs. Splash looked off into the distance, and turned to me sadly. They're after me. I have to go back. What? If I don't they catch both of us. And... I'm not letting you be caught. Splash, please don't! She nickered and nuzzled me. I let him ride me. I'm no better than any of the pets. Yes you are! You're a mustang! She looked me sadly in the eye. Goodbye, Desert Sun. And then wheeled around to let them catch her. To give up her freedom. Splash was doing an honorable thing, but at the same time, she had admitted to not being truly wild anymore. She would go back to the plush life of being a pet, going against the Mustang Law... I knew I was also saying goodbye to Splash's freedom. Goodbye, Splash. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Who has been your favorite original character so far? Tell me in your reviews![Chapter 9] Chapter Nine: Summer Sky I lifted my head and tossed myntwo-toned mane. Ever since Splash had been recaptured, I had beennliving alone, unable to find a bachelor band. Not an easy life. Fornhorses, there's safety in numbers, and we also just like the company. I had never spent a year alone. But I did. Yes, I was now three years old,nstronger than before, and getting closer to being a fully grownnstallion. Under a year is a foal. A male foal is a colt, a femalenis a filly. A year old is a yearling, still, colt and filly apply. nOver a year, up until four years old, is a colt or a filly, and anfour year old or older male is a stallion, a female a mare. I shivered my skin as a fly landed onnmy back and bit me, drawing blood. Swishing my tail, I easilynflicked it off. My life hadn't been so bad in the pastnyear. Food didn't go scarce often, only a few times, there were nontwo legs, and the only rogue I ran into didn't see me. But it was so lonely. I suddenly caught the scent of anothernhorse. All I could register was it was female. The scent was toonfaint to tell what age and what health, but it smelled strangelynfamilar... Eager for company, I began to trot innthe direction of the scent. I didn't smell any other horses withnher, so I began to track the female. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It was my second day of tracking. Whatnwas so familar about that female's scent! I suddenly heard a twig crack, and Inwhirled around. There he was, another colt, my age. But not anyncolt. Red Rock. I flicked my tail irritably at him. Henwas obviously tracking the same female. His snorted at me andncontinued on. But no. This time, I was going to chase him off. Indidn't have to abide by herd rules. I was a loner. Red Rock, like me, had matured since Inhad last seen him. He wasn't as tall as me, but was nearly asnmuscular, stocky, and still had that same mean look in his eyes. I charged at him, then pulled up. No,ncharging wasn't the right approach. I changed my attack by wheelingnaround and kicking out with both of my hind legs. They caught himnsquarely in the flank. With a squeal, Red Rock sank his teethninto my back. I simply gave a little buck, and he was off. Now I laid my ears back and began tonchase him away. Red Rock obviously sensed that I was too much of anchallenge for him, and he began to gallop off a full speed. I snorted in satisfaction, and began mynsearch again. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Three more days past before I came intonother contact with horses. But it wasn't the female. I found ansmalle band. I flea-bitten gray stallion eyed me warningly. It tooknme a moment, but I recognized him. Ram, the stallion who stolenQueenie. I struck at the ground. Like Red Rock,nhe was more of a stocky horse, and I was taller than him. But Inwasn't looking for a fight. Ram had experience. I had barely any. He had a band of three mares. I alsonspotted a couple of yearlings, and I looked for just Queenie, wantingnto see how my half-sister was doing. A familar snort reached my ears, and andun emerged out of the band. Queenie. But she looked muchndifferent. There was a dip in her back, and her stomach was largenwith baby fat she hadn't lost. Yes, there was a young colt at hernside. Three is much too young to have a foal. Queenie would nevernget fit again. Nickering goodbye to her, I walked off. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Finally, the next afternoon, I knewnthat the female was close. Very close. I finally saw her off, a fewnhundred yards away. She was silver. She was Summer Sky. That's how I knew the scent! Giving anhigh whinny, I loped toward the lone filly. When she lifted her headnand tossed her head, I skidded to a halt. She had changed from an awkwardnadolscent to a beautiful filly. The silver on her coat was likenstorm clouds, her mane, tail, and stockings were like snow, and herneyes were still the color of the sky. At first, she looked cautious, like shendidn't recognize me, but then, she nickered excitedly and beganncantering up to meet me. As we snorted excitedly, we touchednnoses, and scanned how we were doing. She didn't look like she hadnhad any major injuries or illness since I last saw her, which pleasednme greatly, and she seemed very happy to see me, which, in a way, wasneven better... Desert Sun! You're OK! Summer Sky... I'm happy to seenyou again. I hope you are too... Of course! You're still my bestnfriend, and always will be!(a/n: Forgot to say, my horse is here,nAngel's her name... I am now a horse-owning girl! YAYNESS!) I led her through the area. She hadn'tnbeen there long, and she needed a guide. How have you been all this time? Wennever even got to say goodbye... Well, I saw Red Rock a few daysnago, as ill-tempered as ever... No surprise there. Well, I also saw Queenie. Shenhas a mate, a stallion named Ram, and a foal. Poor thing, much too young... Yes. But when I was two, I wasnfriends with this mare Splash for a while... she was that appaloosanwe saw when we were yearlings... Oh... really? Was that...njealousy? I pressed my head against the side of hers. Don't worry. It was just anfriendship. She's not you. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AW! This is NOT the end, there'sna lot more to come... R and R![Chapter 10] This chapter is dedicated to mynloyal reviewer, PhantomFan07 Chapter Ten: The Bachelors I pricked my ears, trying to figure outnwhat was going on, what I was hearing. The last two weeks had been bliss. nSummer Sky and I had roamed together, and for some reason, there hadnbeen no problems! It was as if everything was right in the worldnwhen she was around. But something was wrong today. Sun? Yes? Are those... hoofbeats? Insniffed the air, wondering what was around. Oh no. A stallion. Sky, run. Why? There's a stallionnaround, now run! We immediately went from standing tongalloping. I could tell that we were going fast, for I could feelnthe wind in my mane, and hear my hoofbeats thundering over thenground. But when I looked back, I found anbright bay chasing us. Sky, I'm going to stop and fightnhim, you go on. What? Summer Sky, listen tonme- No! He might kill you! Yes, but he may also kill you,nand then I'd never forgive myself. Now. She gave me one last pleading glance,nand galloped on. I skidded to a halt and faced the stallion. He was a bit taller than me, but morenrangy than muscular. I wasn't sure if I could take him or not. But I had to. For Summer Sky. Well. Just a colt. This'll beneasier than I thought. I lashed out at me. and I dodgednnimbly, kicking out with my hind legs and catching him at the jaw. Not quite. He bit my flank, and I squealed. So it went on. I really can't remember much of thatnbattle. I mean, I've been in worse by now. But my most vivid memorynwas the end. I turned and reared, striking him rightnin the chest, like my mother had hit me two and a half years ago. nThe rogue stared at me, and then turned around. I whinniedntriumphantly and began to chase him off. I had won my first real battle. Little did I know... 000 It was him again. The rogue, only fivendays after our battle. This time, Sky stayed behind. This time, I doubted I would win. Trust me, I tried. I dodged and hit,nbit and kicked, but it was no good. The rogue finally drove me off this time. And I watched him take Summer Sky withnhim. 000 I lipped listlissly at the water. nThere seemed to be no point. I hadn't been able to save Sky. Mynwounds still ached, and I really didn't care. I deserved them. But at the watering hole, I smelled thenscent of other stallions. Four of them. A bachelor band. It couldn't be! I had searched for onenall year and couldn't find one! But I looked into the water, and sawnthe reflection of four stallions. Wheeling, I saw them. Tumbleweed, thenyoungest, was a tiny dun two year old. Fox, a four year old, wasndark brown, and reminded me of Mudslide. Sonny, a colt my age, was ansorrel pinto with a white stomach, three stockings and one sock, andna bald faced marking. He had one blue eye and one brown eye. Andnthen there was Zephyr. Zephyr was a striking horse. He hadnwall eyes, and was rangy with a white body and sorrel head. He wasnaround five years old, and the the leader of the band. I tossed my head, watching them as theyncircled me. I saw a friendly spark in Sonny's eyes, but it lookednlike Zephyr was ruthless, and Tumbleweed and Fox were too afraid tonnot do exactly what he did. But after a long moment, Zephyrnsquealed an initiation squeal. The others squealed as well. I wasnin the herd. But that didn't mean that Zephyr likednme. 000 R and R![Chapter 11] Chapter Eleven: Missing So I went on with the bachelor herd. nBut something was missing. Summer Sky. Sonny and I got along fine. Zephyrnstill seemed to hate me, stare at me, anger in his eyes. The twonothers, Thistle and Tumbleweed, were friendly, but followed Zephyrnlike little foals. They were torn between being my friend, and beingnstiff and cold to me. I lipped at the water in a small lakenwe had found. Soon, herds would be here with band stallions, and wencould either flee or fight for a herd. A herd that, if we won, we wouldnfight over ourselves. A herd that Zephyr would surely win. Raisingmy head, I almost couldn'tnbeleive my eyes at what-or who-I saw coming down the hill towards us. My home herd. All of them. Hidalgo, nipping at thenstragglers. Ember, leading them. My sister, almost ready to leaventhem. Quickly, I jerked my head to Zephyr andnthe others, wondering what they were thinking. Sonny seemedninterested for a moment, then went back to drinking. He knew that henwasn't strong enough to win against my father. Tumbleweed andnThistle were looking toward Zephyr, waiting for the signal. And Zephyr himself? He looked greedy. Ready to fight, hisneyes feasting on the mares and fillies. I stamped a hoof innirritation. Who did he think he was? Just five years old, andnthinking he could take on a horse twice his age! My father didn't seem concerned at allnabout us. He didn't even notice me, just kept the mares going. ButnEmber did. She stopped straight in her tracks whennher eyes settled on me. I was her son. Her first foal with Hidalgo.n And I had only been gone a year. She knew who I was. All of the herd skidded to a halt innconfusion. A few yearlings strayed, but Hidalgo quickly snaked themnback, lowering his head in that familiar motion. The bright bay mare seemed unsure ofnwhat to do. Come meet me, or lead the herd away? Just act like Inwas any bachelor and ignore me? Hidalgo loped up to her, wanting to seenwhat was going on. Then he saw me. He stood still, studyingnhow his son had matured. I could have been imagining it, but I thinknI saw a flicker of pride in his eyes. But then, he saw Zephyr. Hidalgo didn't observe Zephyr as annopponent, but a cocky colt. Not a full grown stallion, which Zephyrnwas. Gently, he nudged Ember to move on, and went back to hisnposition in the back of the herd. After a moment, Ember began to lopendown the hill again, the herd following her. I felt a terrible sensenof longing to belong with them again. Sky was gone. I needednsomeone... As the mares, yearlings, a few two yearnolds, and foals began to drink, Hidalgo kept an eye on us, every nownand then taking a drink himself. Zephyr began to prance up toward anfilly-my sister. Angrily, I charged up to him, my earsnlaid back, teeth bared. I was faster and less bulky than Zephyr, sonI made it to her first, standing in front of her, protecting her. I felt another horse at my side, andnturned my head to see my father, helping me. His eyes met mine for anmoment, definitely showing pride this time. Zephyr sized us up for a moment beforendeciding that both of us was too much to handle. He then trottednoff, acting as if he never wanted the filly anyway. My father thankfully touched his muzzlento mine for a moment before chasing my sister back to the herd. Shaking my head, I walked back to thenothers. Tumbleweed and Thistle seemed shocked that I would defy thenleader of their little bachelor band. Sonny seemed impressed. I didn't care about anything. I was alone. xxx I knew that I was leaving myselfnvulnerable to predators, lying down like that. Listless, in front ofnthe lake. Evening was settling. The home herd had left hours ago. nNow the other bachelors were getting restless. Zephyr, without a glance toward me,nbegan to trot up the hill, Tumbleweed and Thistle close behind him. nBut Sonny, a bit nervous, stayed for a moment. He nosed me, tryingnto get me to stand, but I just stayed in my position. Finally, he had no choice but to leave. I didn't fall asleep. Which I'mnthankful for. Cougars could do a lot to a horse. Far off, I heard ancoyote howling. That's when it came. A mother cougar, with her twonhalf-grown cubs, prowled to the edge of the lake, lapping up waternwith her pink tongue. The cubs seemed hesitant, for they had seennme, where she hadn't. Noticing this, she lifted her head and openednher mouth, tasting the air. This time, she knew that I was there. One cougar usually can't kill a horsenaround my age. Most of the time, they go for foals and yearlings. nBut this time, there were three, even if two were inexperienced. Indidn't know my chances against a full grown cat and two adolescents,nso I decided to get the heck out of there. Quickly, silently, I got to my hoovesnand stared at them, meeting eyes with the mother. She didn't drinknanymore. Not a good sign. Carefully, I began to inch away,nbacking up, not turning my back on them. It wouldn't take her longnto run over to me. And if the cubs didn't help, truly, there hadnbeen some deaths of fully grown horses, stronger than me, dying atnthe claws of a cougar. The cougars were still. Once I had backed up enough, I took ansharp turn, wheeling around. My nostrils were flared, and I gallopednat fully speed. I heard a low growl behind me, and the pitter-patternof paws behind me. No. I skidded to a halt and turned to seenwhere they were. But they were no where to be seen. My earsnswiveled my ears to hear them. Nothing. But wait. Looking up, I saw a shadow slip throughnthe bushes on a ridge. I was trapped. Backing up some more, therenwas a splash, and I realized that there was a pond behind me. \"Murr... OW!\" One of thencubs sprang forward, claws outstretched. I dodged him easily, and henwent into the pond. Now was my time. I sped off, kicking up dust behind menas I galloped. I had gotten away from three cougarsnwithout a scratch. Now to find that bachelor band that hadndeserted me. xxx I picked up their scent the nextnmorning. I began loping to them, ready to meet them up again. nSonny, Tumbleweed, Thistle. My enemy, Zephyr. I saw them off in the distance, littlendots. I swished my tail irritably. All of them had left me. If wenwere a band, then the cougars wouldn't have done anything. Throwing my head up, I gave a highnwhinny, loping towards them. Sonny was the first to raise his headnand neigh back, trotting up. Zephyr seemed angry that I was stillnalive, and Tumbleweed and Thistle looked torn. Sonny nickered, his eyes shining withnrelief. Zephyr seemed stunned. I walked up to him, looking him innthe eye. I'm tougher than you think. We'll see. He looked threatening. But I wasn'tnafraid. How could I be afraid of a horse like him? Zephyr lookednstrong, but deep down, he was nothing, just for show. Horses like mynfather, Summer Sky, Sonny, were true mustangs. Not Zephyr. A mustang meant being free. Zephyrnwanted everyone to be under his command. He reminded me of Red Rock. Red Rock. Yet another enemy. xxx I snapped my head up. That scent... Twolegs. One, actually. As the others ran off,nI stayed. The Twoleg was on a horse, a dark brown horse. He hadnhair that was a bit darker than straw. His skin was tanned, and henhad a kind face. His blue eyes reminded me achingly of Summer Sky,nfor they were the exact same color as hers. Slowly, the Twoleg halted his mount andnslipped down, carfully walking up to me. My body tensed up. Butnluckily, he seemed nothing like the ones with the fire sticks. The Twoleg seemed to recognize me, andnI realized something. My father had lived with a Twoleg... was thisnone it? xxx R and R, lovelies![Chapter 12] Chapter Twelve: Birdy I watched the Twoleg with careful eyes. You think you're going to catch me, fool ? I thought. Not a chance. I carefully stepped closer to him though. Something drew me to him. Maybe it was because he reminded me of a horse. He smelled like us. His mane was a straw-color, kind of palomino. His eyes... I didn't dare look at them, for they were the exact shade of Summer Sky's. But his eyes showed something. Like he knew me. Though my coat color was different, I knew I owed a lot of my conformation to my father, so maybe this Twoleg did recognize me... I wandered over to where Queenie and Mudslide were listening to my father tell stories of his old life. \"My Twoleg's name was Frank Hopkins,\" Hidalgo snorted softly, looking up at the evening sky. \"Or Blue Child. I called him Brother, most of the time. He didn't speak our language, but he understood. For he was like a brother to me. He was more Mustang than Twoleg sometimes...\" I listened, ears pricked. Ember had told me of Twolegs herself. She said that when they weren't bothering you, they weren't much use, and when they were bothering you, they were terribly cruel. She spoke of her mother being captured by them when she was a yearling. I didn't want that. And yet, my father spoke of such a strong bond with this 'Blue Child'. Something was going on that I didn't understand... but I would try to. Blue Child. The eyes spoke for him. This was the Twoleg my father had trusted... Slowly, I took a few more steps, then halted. I wasn't sure of what to do. This was a hard choice... he had ropes on his saddle. I'm pretty sure that they weren't for captures, but every one of my instincts was telling me to flee. He suddenly said something in his language. I had no idea what the words were, but they were soft, and had a pleading tone to them. I tossed my creamy mane nervously, and began to walk closer, my nostrils flared. The horse he was riding looked excited, but stood still. Blue Child seemed to be a very kind Twoleg, but he was still a Twoleg. I didn't want that kind of life. I watched as his hand reached out to touch me. I wanted to take my head up and move away, but at the same time, I didn't. Finally, Blue Child's fingers knotted themselves in my mane. Just for a moment. I knew that, for him, it was like connecting to my father. And in a way, it was the same for me. I then heard the commanding whinny of Zephyr, and knew it was time to go. Gently, I lifted my head so that his hand was free. I met Blue Child's eyes that were so familiar... so painful... one last time, and then began to lope off. xxx When a bachelor stallion is around five, he really doesn't care what mare he has, most of the time, as long as it was a mare. I could tell Zephyr would do that. It was like he was desperate to prove something. To prove he could get a mare, no matter what age. It was a cool Autumn day when Birdy first came in. I lifted my head from grazing at the excited snorting of Zephyr. In the distance, I saw a mare. Very old, dusty brown, she was very skinny, her ribs jutting out. She had to be twenty-six or so. And Zephyr was as excited as a two year old. I rolled my eyes and returned to my grazing. But the others, even Sonny, were as excited as he was. What was going on? \"You,\" Sonny declared, staring at the bored look on my face. \"Must have gotten too attatched.\" \"What?\" I asked. Now I wasn't just bored-but confused. Not a good combination. Sonny simply rolled his eyes and walked over to get a better view of the old mare. \"What?\" I repeated, following him. The old mare was getting closer now. Her eyesight must not have been good. Most mares prefer to stay away from bachelors. Seeing this display from the others, I really can't blame them. Zephyr began to slowly trot closer to her, trying to look friendly. I narrowed my eyes and got closer to the others. This would be interesting. Personally, I was going for the poor old mare. And, of course, Zephyr isn't exactly my favorite horse. But seeing her, I knew that it could be obey or die. Literally. And if it came to that... She had a tough face, but it spoke of beauty in her younger years. I could tell that her mousy brown coat used to be a rich chocolate brown, and had a luster it was now missing. \"Hello,\" Zephyr nickered to her pleasantly. She snorted wordlessly and turned her back. Zephyr crept closer, and she whirled, snapping her teeth in his face. \"Stay away, youngster.\" That was pretty much pointless. Zephyr was not going to be staying away any time soon. As the mare avoided him, he got more and more annoyed, until he suddenly sank his teeth into her neck. The mare uttered a squeal of pain, and I couldn't take it anymore. \"Zephyr. Enough.\" I walked forward and stood in front of the mare. Anger and shock entered Zephyr's eyes. This certainly defied proper etiquette in the horse world... Finally, Zephyr shook his mane and began to walk off. \"Wasn't worth it, anyway.\" I shook my mane and turned to the mare. \"Are you all right?\" \"Nice manners for a colt nowadays,\" The mare snorted gruffly. \"They're usually brutes like that one.\" She inclined her head toward Zephyr. I nodded. \"What's your name, anyway?\" She asked. \"Desert Sun,\" I answered, beginning to warm up to her. \"And yours?\" \"Birdy,\" She snorted, giving nothing else. \"You look familiar.\" \"Maybe you've heard of my sire,\" I reasoned. \"Hidalgo. You know, the one who used to live with a Twoleg?\" \"He won the Ocean of Fire!\" Birdy whinnied, now realizing who I was talking about. But there was something in her eyes. Sadness. \"He's a good stallion,\" Birdy nickered. \"Well, it should be time for me to go... I've been without a band for a few months now-\" \"Wait,\" I offered. \"Why don't you stay with us? I'll make sure the others don't bother you.\" \"No,\" Birdy said, stamping a hoof. \"Desert Sun, you seem like a nice horse, with manners, but I do not trust those others. Especially that one you call Zephyr.\" I swished my tail angrily. This was not going as planned. Mares like Birdy, mares that old, needed to be under protection, not wandering around aimlessly. \"Please stay,\" I begged. \"If Zephyr's leading the band, don't you think that SOMEONE needs to be wise enough?\" Flattery worked with Birdy. She was silent for a moment before answering. \"If you're that desperate, Desert Sun-\" \"Just call me Sun,\" I corrected her. xxx Zephyr, though he grumbled grumpily about it, had no reason to not let Birdy into the herd. There was nothing that really went against it. Sonny, Tumbleweed and Thistle didn't really know what to think about having a know-it-all old mare around us, but gradually, I think she grew on them, as she did with me. But despite her confidence, there was no doubt that Birdy was an elderly horse. She had hooves that easily became bruised and tender, and she coughed often. I worried about her. I watched her as she slept last night. Her breathing came in labored intakes, even though she was completely out. A familiar voice came from behind me. \"Sun, you know it won't be too long before she joins the stars...\" I stamped a hoof stubbornly. \"Sonny,\" I replied sharply. \"First of all, we don't really need to think of that. Second, how do you know?\" \"She's sick, Sun,\" The young stallion sighed. \"A blind foal could see that.\" I closed my eyes. I was not losing anyone else. xxx The scent of Twolegs reached my nostrils. Multiple Twolegs. Most of the scents I did not recognize, but one I did, achingly... Blue Child. I raised my head more sharply, inhaling deeply. There was fear in his scent, worry... I could not smell his mount nearby. First priority-the herd. \"All of you,\" I gave a high whinny, turned to them. \"Run, now!\" Birdy's eyes were confused, and Zephyr's smoldered with anger. \"I'm the head stallion, so-\" \"Go!\" With one last long comtemptuous glance at me, he began to turn, Sonny and the others following him. But Birdy stayed. \"It's Twolegs, isn't it?\" She asked hoarsely. \"No, Sun, you can't!\" I stretched out my neck and touched noses with the old mare. \"Don't worry. I'll be fine.\" Without another word, I swung around and began loping towards the place where the scent was coming from. I came to a rise, a bluff, and halted, peeking over to see Blue Child, and his mount, a gelding named General, were tied. Blue Child had a dirty rag stuffed into his mouth so that he couldn't speak. Carefully, I let out a soft whinny, after making sure none of his captors were present. I delicately lifted my hooves one by one as I crept down, making sure even the grass didn't crunch under my feet. I carefully slipped my teeth at an angle so that Blue Child's binds were in my jaw, and gave them a sharp tug with all my might. Snap! Giving a satisfied nicker, I watched as Blue Child took the gag off, and grinned at me. I then walked over to General, and kicked his weakly secured post hard enough for it to fall over. Blue Child tiptoed to his pet and mounted. After a moment of quick thinking, my gut told me to gallop alongside them. Good thing I did. For just as Blue Child was dismounting to say good-bye to me, I turned my head to see four Twolegs on their pets charging toward us. Blue Child's enemies. xxx R and R, please! I'm going to start writing chapters for the story about Desert Sun's foal soon... though I won't tell you whether it'll be with Summer Sky, though...[Chapter 13] ChapternThirteen: Thrill of the Chase Great. Tossingnmy mane in exasperation, I gave Blue Child a glare. I had tongo save the dumb Twoleg. Just had to. Any horse with sense wouldnhave just let him be killed. But noooo. I had to help him out. Stupid. \"Sorry,\"nBlue Child muttered, swinging onto General. But the gelding was toonscared, and I knew that he wouldn't be fast enough to make it. Givingnan exasperated snort, I quickly sidled up to General and shot BluenChild the familiar look. His eyes widened in surprise, but he jumpednonto my back. I winced, but started up. Holdnon, Blue Child. Mynhooves beat the ground rythmically, and I could feel his handsngripping my mane. I wasn't used to this weight, and I knew that Incouldn't make it far. A horse actually used to it and fast might,nbut I didn't know how to situate things. Inhad to find a safe place for Blue Child. Wait... Inknew of a Twoleg place. These Twolegs rode horseback, but not likenthe pale ones did. They were kind, and respected the horse. Thenmost a horse wore there was a blanket on its back. BluenChild was like them. ButnI had a feeling that these pale Twolegs wouldn't be welcome there. Inhad to get rid of them, just long enough for Blue Child to escape. Angrove of trees came into my view. Perfect. Twolegsnand their pets weren't skilled enough to gallop through deep forests.n But a mustang, a wild horse who was born there, could. Likenme. Inpicked up my pace and galloped toward the trees. One wrong move, andnI could ram into a trunk and be dead. The world around me becamenshadows, and I could feel Blue Child tighten his grip on my mane. nThe other Twolegs' shouts could be heard out there. Injumped nimbly over a rotten log. That wasn't hard. But the forestnwas thickening. Water from puddles soaked the feathers on my heels. nTurning my head, I breathed a quick sigh of relief that the Twolegsnweren't behind us. Finally,nafter swerving around many trees, it was as if I saw the light at thenend of a tunnel, and was able to race out of the grove. Butnit wouldn't be long before the Twolegs were behind us again. Forcednto halt because of exhaustion, I stood, my sides heaving up and down.n Oh... the splitting pain of running so fast and so quickly for sonlong shot through me, as if my ribs were all breaking apart, my lungsntorn... ButnI had to go on. Indidn't have to gallop as fast, but still plenty swift. Finally, Inbegan to hear the voices of the kind Twolegs, and see their home. nTheir strange shelters, 'teepees' were set up, and fires werenburning. \"Younmight want to stop now,\" Blue Child muttered. Oops. Mynfault. Incould see what he was saying. I was going so fast, that I couldn'tnstop in time. This would be ugly. Ornwould it? The Twolegs could see us, and were running, trying tonget out of my way, when I simply stopped running. Well,ntried to. Because,nit turns out, you skid a bit when you do that. Finally,na few strong Twolegs put their arms around my neck and stopped me. nBlue Child swung down, and looked into my eyes. \"Thanks.\" Innickered, and touched my muzzle to his hand. He smiled. \"Good-bye,nbrother.\" Inbobbed my head up and down, then veered, galloping at full speed. Thatnwas the last time I ever saw Blue Child. xxx Injerked my head up from where I had been grazing. \"Theren'e is!\" Wonderful. Inhad to find the bachelors and Birdy; there was safety in numbers. Insped up and began to gallop, but the group was close behind me. Therenwas only one move I could think of. Suddenlynwheeling and turning back to them, I gave the Twolegs a surprise. nTheir eyes widened as I began to gallop in circles around their band,ndizzying themm confusing them. One tried to rope me, but missed by anyard. Finally, I stopped and began to run off. Andnyou know what? Theynwere too confused to follow. xxx \"Incan't believe it!\" Birdy squealed, trotting up. \"You madenit!\" \"Inmade it,\" I nickered, but was looking Zephyr in the eye. Henlooked just as surprised as he had when I escaped the cougars. Sonnyntrotted up, surprise in his eyes. \"Thatnwas close,\" He said. \"And foolish. But very brave.\" \"Verynbrave,\" Birdy agreed. The mousy brown mare's eyes were shining. \"No,\"nZephyr snorted. \"I don't see it that way. In fact, I thinknthat Sun's position should be lowered.\" \"You'renwrong!\" Sonny exclaimed. Inlooked Zephyr in the eye. There was only one thing I could do. \"Inchallenge you to a battle, Zephyr,\" I whinnied, stamping thenground with a hoof. Hisneyes showed more disbelief. \"You!\"nHe cried. \"A four year old against a six year old?\" \"Itndoesn't matter the age,\" I pointed out coolly. \"It mattersnthe skill. Of which you have none, it seems.\" \"Thennwhy am I the head stallion here?\" \"I'venwatched your technique,\" I began, walking toward him. \"Younintimidate before you actually fight. You bluff. Well. That time'snover.\" Inreared up, teeth bared, and struck out at him. Zephyr rose to meetnthe challenge, but I avoided him by twisting my body so that I wasndown on my forelegs and kicking out. I heard the satisfactory soundnof my hoof connecting with Zephyr's chest. Withna squeal, and sank his teeth into my neck. I twisted away, bloodnspraying from the wound, and head-butted him. Zephyr, stunned by thenforce of ny attack, stumbled a few steps backwards. Now,nmy father taught me some very important things about fighting when Inwas with the Home Herd. And one of the most important things was: Nevernlet yourself fall. Thisnleft you weak, defenseless to attackers. Exposing the vulnerablenparts of you. AllnI had to do was make Zephyr fall down. Inrose up on my hind legs again and battered Zephyr's back with mynforehooves. He blew through his nostrils, and took a hold of mynnose, trying to drag my face to the dirt. Notngonna happen. Rammingnthe side of my face against his, I forced him to let go. It was timenfor my final move. Inturned sharply and kicked Zephyr right in the face. The sound of hisnscream made me wince, but he fell to the ground. Hencould no longer fight. Standingnover him, I looked him in the eye. I was the lead stallion now. Inled the bachelors. Birdy and Sonny suddenly began to whinny inncongratulations. The old mare trotted up to me and touched her nosento mine. Zephyrnstruggled to his hooves and stared at me, hate in his eyes. I lacednmy ears back in response, bared my teeth, and began to gallop at him,nimitating what my father had done two years ago. Zephyr could nonlonger stay here after all he had done. Innresponse, he did nothing but run away. \"Coward,\"nI snorted, slowing to a halt as Birdy walked up to me. \"Yes,\"nShe agreed. \"No you can find her.\" Mynears pricked, and I turned to the old mare. \"Find who?\" Birdy'sneyes glowed with amusement. \" Her . Don't try to tell menyou haven't been looking for a mare, Desert Sun. And not just anynmare. One in particular .\" Instruck at the ground. \"I've given up on Summer Sky, Birdy.\" \"SummernSky?\" Birdy repeated. \"You mean, 'Summer Sky'?\" \"Yes,\"nI nickered, not sure of what she was talking about. \"Inmet that young mare!\" Birdy whinnied. \"Two years ago. Anfilly then. Nice. Sweet. Had good manners, like you. We traveledntogether for a few months before we went our separatenways.\" \"Really?\" I asked. \"That's...ninteresting.\" Itnwas. Summer Sky and Birdy had known each other? \"Don'tngive up that easy,\" Birdy said as she turned to go graze. \"Incan tell she's special to you.\" xxx Thenstench of death filled my nostrils. It made me want to run away. nBut I had to investigate. It was my duty. Asnthe others slept-it was late in the night-I walked toward the scent,nwanting to find out what was going on. Itnwasn't too far away. He wasn't too far away. Therenwas a cougar bite on the back of his neck. Something must've scarednthe cat off, or else it would still be there. The mess was ugly. AndnI couldn't help thinking, as I stared at the dead horse... PoornZephyr. xxx Rnand R![Chapter 14] Chapter Fourteen: Fly Away I trotted ahead of my herd, scoping the area for any predators. None that I could see or smell. Hearing my high safety whinny, Sonny, Tumbleweed, Thistle and Birdy trotted forward. Pride swelled my heart. I was the head stallion now. It was a tough job, but worth it. Tumbleweed and Thistle gave me the same awed looks they had given Zephyr before, and even Birdy treated me with new respect. Birdy, panting slightly from the strenuous non-stop moving we had done for a few hours. But she was breathing harder than normally needed. I nosed her. \"You all right?\" \"Fine,\" She snorted, then moved along. \"This has not been one of her better days,\" Sonny muttered, sidling up to me. I bobbed my head in agreement. Lately, it seemed like none of Birdy's days were her 'better days'. I tried to console myself with the thought that it was a fact of life that old horses die. Birdy was twenty-six... Still. She had become a close friend of mine. Not as close as Summer Sky, but close. Birdy was wise and didn't give up. A good mare. A strange scent that I didn't recognize tickled my nostrils, and I winced. Something was different about it... That's when I knew why it was so different. A small herd of a stallion and three mares walked uphill. I noticed there were also two yearlings in the herd, and each mare had a foal. And I knew one of those mares. A dun with a snip, and yet not as slender as she had been before, now rounded from having a foal. My eyes widened in amazement as she lumbered up(being in foal had not treated her well). Queenie! I struck at the ground, startled. Memories came flooding back, of when Ram had stolen her. Well, not really stolen her, she was just my companion, my half-sister. We shared the same sire! I turned my head to gauge my band's reactions. Sonny, Tumbleweed and Thistle looked just as any stallion would-interested. But Birdy had noticed my startled reaction to seeing the herd. She walked up to my side. \"Who are they?\" She asked curiously. \"The dun is my half-sister, Queenie,\" I nickered. \"We have the same sire.\" For some reason, hearing that Queenie and were both Hidalgo's foals seemed to cause Birdy to be very quiet. I scanned her face. Her eyes. The mousy brown mare seemed stunned. \"What's wrong?\" I snorted. \"Nothing...\" I heard a high, excited, confused whinny. \"Desert Sun?\" Queenie had called my name. This was not good. Ram whirled his head to see Queenie's face, then looked at me. His eyes narrowed suspiciously. I could tell that he was searching his memory for who I was. I had changed a lot since being a two-year-old colt who had barely lived on his own for long. He neighed anxiously to his lead mare, a bulky roan. She spotted why he was looking nervous, and turned, leading the rest of the small herd away. At first, Queenie didn't obey, watching me, looking ready for me to answer, but Ram nipped her sharply, and she turned, her foal at her side. Her foal. It seemed like I had not noticed her foal until now. A well-fed colt, the same flea-bitten gray color as his sire. As the herd wandered off, Ram turned back to me. He was taking a risk. As the band was leaving, another stallion could go and steal them. Steal them... None of the mares were really that beautiful-they hadn't kept in shape. But then again, a mare was a mare. Before I could try though, it was Thistle. My eyes widened as the little dun colt-he was only three years old-sped off as fast as he could after the mares as Ram stared at me. I have to give it to him, he was galloping hard enough to beat the stallion. Ram, stunned, gave a squeal of surprise and rage as Thistle whipped past him, and galloped down the bluff after him. I felt powerless-Thistle was my herdmate, but there was nothing I could do... it wasn't my battle. A few seconds later, Thistle was, amazingly, back, and herding a mare and her foal uphill. Of course, it wasn't just any mare. It was Queenie. I didn't know what to think. Have Queenie with an inexperienced stallion, or a terribly bossy one? Her colt, a weanling, was galloping as fast as he could. But Ram was hot on their heels. Now excited, Sonny and Tumbleweed were whinnying in encouragment, giving bucks and half-rears. Birdy was simply wide-eyed, obviously surprised Thistle had made it that far in his plan. \"Idiot,\" She snorted, could not keep a note of motherly worry out of her voice. Ram, ears laced back, raked his teeth down Thistle's back, leaving long tears, but that didn't stop Thistle. Queenie and her foal didn't know what to do; I think it was partly the fact that Queenie wanted to visit with me that kept her going in order of this younger stallion. Finally, realizing that he couldn't go on any longer, Thistle turned to meet Ram's attack. I winced. This would not be good. Visions of a fierce battle went through my head... Ram would win. I knew it. The stallion sank his teeth into Thistle's face, and the colt gave a squeal, veering and kicking out, but missing. All he had done was play with the other stallions in the band. \"He doesn't have a chance,\" I snorted. \"Not one,\" Birdy agreed. \"I think he can do it,\" Kind Sonny said. But even this was half-hearted. We watched as Thistle and Ram danced, kicking, squealing, biting, striking... 'til finally, as predicted, Thistle got his sense back and gave up. He was covered in bruises. Long scratched ripped at his skin. Even his hooves seemed sore as he walked tenderly back toward us, head bowed. I watched as Queenie was chased back with her foal by Ram. She turned her head and gave one last sorrowful whinny. I shuddered. That was the last time I ever saw my sister. I don't know what happened to her. Maybe she died unnaturally, maybe she'll die in her sleep of old age. Maybe her son would become a great stallion, maybe he would be killed by cougars... I don't know. \"Poor thing,\" Birdy sighed, her eyes on Queenie. But something made me suspicious. Was Birdy linked to us more than I thought? xxx I lipped at the grass thoughtfully that evening, thinking of Queenie. Maybe I should have done more. Was I a coward for not acting? Birdy walked over to my side. \"You're thinking of your half-sister,\" She guessed. I paused, worried. What would she think? \"Yes.\" \"That's natural,\" Birdy nickered. \"You grew up together.\" \"I just wish I could have done something...\" I sighed. Birdy snorted. \"What could you have done? You're a strong stallion, Sun, and you might have been able to take her back... but what would come of it? She's young, she wouldn't want to just hang around like I do... You'd have to hand her over to one of the others, and though their nice youngsters, even that Sonny isn't ready.\" \"True.\" Birdy nosed me. \"Letting her go was the best you could do,\" She soothed. \"Besides, you wouldn't want a little colt running around and bothering you, would you?\" I whinnied with laughter. \"True again.\" xxx A few days passed. It was a hot summer afternoon when I noticed that Birdy was coughing even more than usual. She was stumbling every now and then, and I pricked my ears, wondering... \"Are you all right?\" I asked, sidling up to her. \"Fine,\" She coughed. \"I just-\" But she collapsed, her body writhing with hacking coughs. Fear pierced through my heart. This couldn't be happening. \"Sun!\" Birdy choked out. \"Don't just stand there! You'll get seperated from the band...\" Sonny stepped up beside me. \"Sun,\" He murmured. \"It's over. You need to just-\" \"No!\" I lunged at him, teeth bared, and he was barely able to avoid me. His odd eyes were sad. \"Please catch up soon. I can't lead this herd.\" He turned and loped off. I bent my head low so I was near Birdy, looking into her eyes. \"Birdy,\" I begged my friend. \"Please-\" \"Sun,\" She sighed. \"I'm an old mare. There's nothing more for me.\" \"There's plenty,\" I protested. \"You're very wise, and-\" \"As wise as I may be,\" She snorted, still able to make her tone dry. \"A band of bachelors doesn't need an old mare around.\" Her eyes were glazing, and her voice was becoming faint. The mare's sides were shuddering as they rose up and down. It seemed to take her more strength than ever to breathe. \"But before I die,\" She whispered. \"I need to tell you something.\" \"What?\" I asked nervously. \"Desert Sun,\" Birdy murmured. \"Eleven years ago... eleven years ago I gave birth to my last foal. A healthy colt. Something about him told me he was special. He was a handsome thing, a sorrel pinto with dark eyes... he looked a lot like... you.\" I froze. \"Birdy-\" \"Ssh,\" She croaked. \"I named him Justice. We were so close... but when he was around four months old, we were separated in a stampede... he was renamed Hidalgo by a kind Twoleg who took him in... and made him a legend.\" My eyes widened. \"Birdy? You're my-\" \"Grandmother?\" She gave a feeble laugh. \"Yes. I just wish... I wish I could have known you... better.\" Her eyes suddenly closed. \"Birdy!\" I cried. \"No!\" But it was too late. Birdy sighed, and was still. I closed my eyes, brushig my muzzle along her side. \"Goodbye, Birdy,\" I nickered. \"Fly away. Fly away home.\" xxx Awww... anyway, here's a semi sneak-peek of Painted Freedom: Great Spirit Horse, my next Hidalgo fic...

I have. Follow me on my journey of weaving the imaginary tale of a life that could have been. My story begins in the long lonely hours at Steveton after the failed elopement. Our Jane is trying to comfort herself with the knowledge that she did the honorable thing by releasing him. Her family and friends are trying to comfort the shell of the lively girl they once knew. How will Jane write of the heart when her own is sorely broken? Will lost love hold her back? Is it really lost? Follow along as what was once thought lost is found again in the guise of a hasty letter. After all, Jane received the title of \"The Lady of Letters\" for a reason. That reason is just more interesting than you think One The slow, melodic strain of a familiar tune drifted through her head. It was the same song she and Tom had danced to at Lady Gresham's ball. It had been many months since that night but the memories were still as fresh as ever. As she walked slowly along her path through the wood she thought back to that night. The way his eyes had met hers in the dance was a moment she would never forget. The late afternoon sun flitted across the trees lightly, illuminating something here and hiding other things there. The weather was mild and the breeze pleasing but it affected Jane little. This place that had once been a beautiful sanctuary for her was now only a palpable reminder of him. Tentatively she reached out and touched the rough bark of the tree he had pushed her hastily against the day he had come back to her. Her fingers stung from touching such a physical reminder of that day, of that intimate embrace. It seemed to hold his essence, kept his heartbeat. For it certainly did not belong to her. She had hurt and disappointed him. No matter how it pained her, she knew it had been the right decision. Jane was no longer a sentimental young girl. She had loved as violently as any heart could dare. The feelings she shared with Tom were not the silly infatuation of youth, but a strong mature affection. Loving another in that way was rare and seemed to require a heavy payment. Jane had indeed paid with her happiness in exchange for his and his families. She told herself once again that it was noble, as she wiped the tears from her cheeks and headed towards home. \"You should not go there so often,\" Cassandra said as she walked through the door. Her sister's voice was soft with concern, but try as she might Jane could not rally her spirits enough to reassure her. Instead she offered Cassie a small smile before heading to the kitchen in search of some employment. She didn't want to think any longer. Without a strong will to check them, her thoughts would be with him constantly. She would wonder endlessly where he was and what he was doing. Was he content? Did he ever think on her? \"Back from your walk already?\" Mrs. Austen asked her daughter from behind a large pot of stew. It was still unusual for her to witness Jane enter the kitchen with the intent to be of service. Jane had always despised housework and shirked it whenever she could in favor of reading or working on her stories. Since the unfortunate incident Mrs. Austen had not seen her daughter so dedicated to her chores. \"My energy was not what it usually is today.\" Jane explained. Her mother gave her a knowing look before handing her an apron from the rack. Jane took it, grateful for her mother's tact at present. The whole of her family in fact, had been very generous in their treatment of her and her ill spirits. She had put them all in a difficult situation, yet they offered no censure or condescension. In the weeks following her failed elopement the family strayed little into society; Jane even less. This was a strain to Mrs. Austen who was by nature a social creature. With Lady Gresham's disapproval of Jane and the impossibility of meeting the Lefroy's without awkwardness for any forcible time, their engagements had been limited. Jane was sure that her family had no doubt heard news of Tom, considering word spread quickly in Hampshire, but she bid them never to tell her. For had it not been Henry and Eliza who brought the news of his engagement and subsequent visit to the area? Jane had decided she never wanted to hear news like that again, especially from those she loved. \"Dinner is nearly ready child,\" her mother spoke softly. \"Why don't you go and rest for a while, maybe write for a bit?\" \"Mum,\" Jane replied giving her mother a resigned look, which Mrs. Austen pointedly ignored. Jane shuffled a few bowls around needlessly before giving up and retiring to her room. \"Would that I could,\" she spoke to herself while looking down upon her folio. Her hand ached for her pen, but she was at a loss for words. She had tried to write a few times since the incident but every time the words flowed, they were about Tom. As beautiful as the descriptions of him were that she conjured, she would not disgrace herself by keeping them. Every line went to the fire. While Jane wanted to destroy all that reminded her of her lost love, Cassandra held ever thing of Roberts close to her heart. When she was sure of being left alone for a few hours she would take out his letters and read them over. Cassie was never one for public displays, so when Jane would hear her sister's soft cries she made sure to never disturb her. It had been Cassandra's great influence and tender friendship that Jane relied upon most. Whenever she felt a fit of great sorrow coming on she would think of Cassie and her modest grieving. It seemed that Jane had finally learned to hold her tongue, and her emotions in check. Feeling tired from her walk and heavy thoughts she lay across her bed. Closing her eyes she hummed a tune to herself before drifting into a deep slumber. She dreamt of being lost in a dark wood, and all the terror that would supply. Tossing and turning she called out in her sleep for what she did not know. \"Jane,\" a faraway voice called. \"Wake up.\" Her eyelids fluttered open and she saw the concerned face of her sister. Cassandra had rushed urgently to Jane's side when she heard her cries and almost forgot about the letter she had brought up with her. \"Are you alright?\" She asked sincerely, touching her forehead to check for fever. Thankfully she was not over warm. Jane sat up and smoothed her hair back. \"A bad dream that is all,\" she said. \"Well in that case I shall give you what I came in search of you for originally.\" Jane wondered what she was getting at. \"Smith came in with the evening post a few minutes ago and it contained something for you.\" Cassandra held the square letter out to her. How odd it was for her to receive something in the evening post. She hoped it was not urgent news of some calamity. She turned the letter over in her hand and saw that it was indeed addressed to a Miss. Jane Austen. The sender was a Mr. L. Thomas. Jane did not know this name at all and wondered if it could be some sort of mistake. \"Do you know who this is from? She asked her sister. \"Not a clue. Why don't you open it and find out,\" she suggested. The wax seal broke easily seeing as how the letter was put together in a dodgy way. The addresser must have been in some hurry. Jane's heart stopped as she began to read the words. My dearest Jane, This letter must come to you as quite a shock but I could contain myself no longer. How long has it been since I last beheld your beautiful form? I have not accepted your goodbye. I cannot, will not. You must know that I am a man of my word. When I swore to you that I would not give you up I meant it. I never shall. Even if you only live in my memories from this day forward I will be true. Tell me you think of me. Tom It was a good thing Jane happened to be sitting on her bed. Because in spite of her never being prone to theatrics the contents of the mysterious letter so astonished that she nearly fainted. Cassandra watched, as her sister's face became shocked and excited. This letter began to worry her. \"My dear Jane what is it?\" She asked in haste. The answer was the farthest thing from what she was expecting. \"Tom.\" Jane replied.[Chapter 2] Two Jane could feel her breath leave her as she read his words, and they were his no doubt. What was this? She wondered looking at the letter in her hands. What did this mean? \"My dear Jane what is it?\" She heard Cassie ask beside her and knew she must speak. But what to say? She could barely form her thoughts let alone communicate them to another. \"Tom\" She gave the only answer she could. How that name rolled from her tongue easily. Even though she had not spoken it since the day she left him at the carriage house. \"What do you mean?\" Cassandra asked, unsure of the connection between the mysterious letter and Mr. Lefroy. \"The letter,\" Jane spoke in a breathy whisper. \"He has written to me.\" Cassandra was all astonishment. Was this good news? She wondered. \"Have his circumstances changed? Is that why he has written?\" Jane was wondering the same thing. She began to reread the letter, slower this time. He had addressed her as dearest; she felt her heart flutter at the remembrance of hearing herself thus called by him once before. The body of his letter was determined and very passionate. Much like himself. Jane wanted to give some reassurance to her sister but would need a deal of time to right herself and her feelings. But time for reflection was not to be had. \"Jane, Cassie,\" They heard their mother call. \"Come down, dinner is ready.\" Jane gave her sister a look of panic. She could not bear the thought of the others hearing of this. At least not yet, it would be too much in one evening. Sensing her sisters fears as well as she would her own Cassandra moved quickly to comfort. \"We need not speak of it. I told no one of the letter before bringing it, for which I am now extremely grateful.\" She took the letter from Jane's hands and folded it quickly before sliding it into a drawer. \"We must go down to dinner or else we raise suspicions. Are you well enough to attempt it?\" Jane gave a thankful look to her sister and nodded in agreement. Downstairs in the dining room Mr. and Mrs. Austen were already seated next to one another, as was their usual custom in the privacy of their home. As the number of their children suggested; theirs was a happy and felicitous marriage. But their situation in life had become a great strain. Things were worse now that Jane had turned down her great suitor and poor Richards' untimely demise. It could have been the pressing financial strain that allowed them both to turn a blind eye to the escapades of Henry and Eliza. For they knew their son was a sensible man and Eliza was sincere in her affections. Her fortune would also supply for his needs quite well. They just needed to get them to the church. Cassandra and Jane went down to diner wearing forced smiles. The former took on the occupation of guiding the conversation so as to draw unnecessary attention away from Jane, who was very thankful for her sister's interference. Jane felt her stomach contract as she stared at her plate in despondency. The need to run and read his words again fought with her sense of prudence. She couldn't very well run out of the room like a spoilt child. Though she could stomach no food she meticulously sliced and quartered her meat and sipped her wine intermittently. \"What has you looking so ill?\" Mrs. Austen questioned when she perceived her daughters countenance. She was used to seeing her Jane in less than lively spirits but at the moment she looked quite grave. When she did not immediately answer, her father began to wonder as well. \"Are you unwell Jane?\" \"Jane is feeling rather tired,\" Cassandra answered for her. \"I can account for her having not slept well last night. Where is Henry?\" She asked once again trying to divert her parent's conversation. Her camaraderie with Jane could afford nothing less. \"Oh Jane,\" her mother clucked. \"You must go to bed as soon as you finish your meal.\" Eliza reading the room as she was want to do, and realizing that for some reason Jane was not in the mood to talk, turned and answered Cassandra. \"My little pug, you see, had gotten away from me when I was walking earlier this evening.\" Though the case was true, her attention, as well as Henry's had been occupied too long, giving the little animal a chance to wander far. Poor Henry was now, for the cause of love, scouring the immediate countryside in search of the pet. The rest of the meal passed with little conversation and even that was mild and unassuming. Jane thought of the letter constantly and was thankful for her mother's insistence that she retire to her bed. She walked quickly up the stairs, and after closing the door of her room, went straight to the drawer that held the letter. She unfolded it and read the words again. So he still loves me , she thought. She could well believe it; her love was still the same. Though as far as she could tell nothing had changed. His uncle was not likely to alter his position on their union. His exclamations of devotion pleased her none the less. He must not be engaged to another then. With a finger she touched the letter and traced the words. His hands had been here. Before her sister or good sense caught up with her she pulled out pen and paper. Refusing to meditate on her words she let them flow freely onto the page. Dear Tom, I am sorry, my dear friend that my word couldn't last as long as yours. When you asked me if I was sure on that fateful morning my answer was truthful. Do you despise me for being inconstant in my opinion? I must assure you again that is was with the greatest intentions and love for yourself, which I could but see no other way. I shall think of you always and fondly. Yours in affection though not in life, ~Jane As soon as her name was signed she jumped up from her seat and paced the room. Could she send it? Would she? Cassandra wondered the same when she entered the room and saw Jane's writing supplies out on the table. \"You will reply?\" She asked. Jane looked up at her but quickly continued her pacing. \"Yes,\" she began. \"No, oh I don't know Cassie.\" Jane was in a mood, wringing her hands, and rubbing her eyes. She stopped her pacing suddenly and gave her sister a wild look. \"Tell me what I should do?\" She begged Cassie. At present she could not make the decision for herself. For her feelings were flying this way and that, almost hysterical, she could not trust herself. Being the calm and reasonable creature that she was, Cassandra took her agitated sister by the hand and led her to the bed. Once they were both settled and comfortable, she gave the best advice she could. \"Was he writing to inform you of his attentions being possible?\" \"No,\" Jane spoke sadly. \"The material circumstances have not changed. But neither have his feelings.\" \"Jane, please do not take offense, but have you considered a secret engagement? Could you two not wait some years, until his Uncle may be prevailed upon or his circumstances in the world become greater?\" \"Cassie,\" Jane spoke quite astonished. \"You surprise me with your talk of secrets. Is that your council?\" It seemed so far out of her sisters usual opinions. But Cassandra meant what she proposed. Having lived through the loss of her own love, she would support her sister in her own. That early morning when she chanced upon Jane in the act of fleeing she was at first appalled. But when Jane asked if she would consider the same thing, an elopement, if it meant that she could be with Richard; nothing had ever rung more true. \"Others have done it. If neither of you wants to sever the connection then why not wait. What is there to lose? For Mr. Lefroy, I'm sure is under no pressure from his Uncle to marry, seeing how the old man is unmarried himself. Materially Jane, it would be wise for you or even I to marry, but I doubt either of us will ever have the inclination.\" Jane took every one of her sister's words into consideration. Her heart screamed yes but her mind was less sure. Why could things not be simple? You fall in love then get married, why should that be so hard? \"Why must life be so complicated for us?\" Jane moaned falling back onto the bed. \"I wish I could tell you. The world is not a fair place I fear.\" Cassandra laid down next to her sister like they used to when they were children. She stroked her hair in a comforting way. \"At least we will always have each other.\" Jane whispered. \"Yes we will. But Jane, you have not lost Tom. Not entirely.\" \"No, not entirely.\" Jane conceded. \"But can it work? Would it be worth it for either of us to pine away for something that may never happen?\" \"You are pining now Jane, and according to that letter, he is as well.\" \"So I should send my reply?\" Jane asked one more time. Cassandra wouldn't answer. She knew Jane needed to make this decision on her own. Giving her a penetrating look she asked \"Should you?\" \"Yes,\" Jane spoke quickly. \"I think I should.\"[Chapter 3] Three He jolted upright in his bed. His skin was hot and sweat had dampened his bed clothes. It was the dream again. The same one that had plagued him for months on end. Almost every night she would come to him. Telling him in his ear that she no longer loved him. That she had never loved him because he was wholly unworthy of any love at all. He never saw her face in the dreams but felt her presence and heard her voice; giving rise to every self-doubt he secretly harbored. Routinely, he got from his bed and went to wash. He noted that his reflection in the mirror was even worse than yesterday. The pain and frustration of losing Jane coupled with the poor sleep he had been getting made him look ten years older. He laughed bitterly when he thought about how far he now was from the preening and prancing of which she had previously accused him. No, he was not that young man anymore. The realities of life, which he had been so studiously avoiding in his philandering, had finally caught up to him. It weighed heavily, like a brick on his chest. Never was he able to get a deep breath or ease the aching. He had tried no doubt. After his Uncle had refused to consent to his marrying Jane he had tried to revert back into old habits; tried to hide his feelings away with vice. But she would not be repressed in his memory. She was with him as he walked to the court house every morning. She was with him as he spent every night alone. He dressed in his black coat, as was his usual, and gathered his books. Only half a term left of sitting with the other apprentices before he could take his own entry level position. Any menial law work would be better than sitting under his Uncle day in and day out. He had developed a quiet hatred for the old man that left his insides feeling bitter. Being the first to arrive, which was also normal for him now, he pulled out his notebook and waited. Allowing his thoughts to drift to Jane as they usually did. What would she be doing now? Writing perhaps or entertaining her family with some wild story. The thoughts almost brought a smile to his lips. But he was forced out of his silent reverie by William nudging his side. \"Wool gathering again Tom?\" He spoke far louder than necessary with his breath still smelling of his breakfast. He gave William Stout the same disinterested look he did every day. Unfortunately it had yet to impress upon him Tom's desire to be left alone. Every day the young man tried to make conversation and every day Tom did his best to ignore him. \"I hear we are actually going to get an interesting case to watch this morning. Apparently first up is a man, who they say murdered his own father so he could inherit sooner. George says the evidence is spotty but I say it'll be interesting all the same.\" William droned on and Tom tuned him out. The judge soon entered in all his usual pomp. Months of practice enabled Tom to resist rolling his eyes. But no matter his own feeling on his Uncles prejudices the man was undoubtedly an excellent judge. The poor bastard up first was lucky to have him and not one of the others. His uncle had a general inclination towards those of the land class. The day wore on and Tom studiously took down the judiciary notes, and spoke to the other men when absolutely necessary. The gossip amongst the other apprentices, and if Tom was honest, a wide range of people from his former social circle, was that the Miss Waxford had broken his heart, left him shamed and in all regards singularly put out. He would never bother to correct them. The ill-conceived engagement was swiftly ended when her family heard of his failed elopement. Obviously, and for that Tom was forever grateful. Explaining the situation to the judge was punishment enough. The thought of having to explain to the poor girl that he had used her, gave him the chills. There was no end apparently, in his mistakes. Since then he had promised himself that he would be the only party to suffer from his folly. Once again alone in his rooms his eyes immediately fell to the pen and paper that sat in disarray on his desk. He hadn't dared to touch the things since he wrote that letter to her in a fit of midnight madness. The dreams had been particularly bad last week and he finally broke down, needing to reach out to her for reassurance. For some reason his heart needed to hear of her love for him in order to keep beating. Knowing the hour for dinner was approaching he forbade himself from thinking on it any longer. He knew that her reaction to the letter wouldn't be good. It was wrong of him to send it and put her in the uncomfortable situation. But what is done, is done. He allowed himself a quick drink before heading down to his daily trial. Dinner with the old man was something he couldn't weasel his way out of. It was also the most trying time of the day. Perhaps that was why he had been getting steadily thinner. Food was much less appetizing when swallowed with heaping doses of recrimination. \"Nephew,\" he acknowledged him before taking his customary seat at the head of the table. Tom didn't respond knowing that his conversation wasn't required yet. They both finished the meal in silence. The food was bland in Tom's mouth but the setting was even worse. The weight of the depression he had slipped into was heavier tonight. \"I have good news Thomas,\" his uncle spoke breaking the delicate silence they had nurtured all these months. He couldn't remember the last time they had an actual conversation in this room. Unwillingly his eyes moved to the chair Jane had sat in on her one visit. She had looked so beautiful in the soft candle light standing up to the old man in her own unique way. God, how he just missed her. \"About?\" he asked. Tom couldn't bring himself to soften the sarcastic tone of his question. His Uncle noticed and fixed him with a glare. But surprisingly didn't comment. \"You have,\" he began in a reluctant voice, \"managed to bring your performance up considerably in your studies.\" Tom knew that he must have hated to give his insolent nephew anything that even remotely resembled praise. \"Thank you Uncle.\" \"No don't thank me yet.\" He said with a way of his hand. \"That was not my news.\" Both men took a long drink of their wine. Tom couldn't find it within himself to wonder what his Uncle would say next. \"In light of your – better performance, I am now able, without appearing partial, to keep you on as my personal apprentice. You are no doubt surprised, I am equally surprised as well. I did not think you would ever prove yourself worthy. But I am not so set in my ways that I cannot be proved wrong, even when the likelihood was so very slim.\" Tom didn't say anything for a long time. He just stared at his faint reflection in the highly polished wood of the table. This was not what he wanted to hear. It was not what he wanted in life. He wondered if it mattered though. He had given up the hope of ever being truly happy. That would be impossible without his Jane. But the one consolation he had was his continued responsibility to his family. Working directly under the High Court Judge would recommend him much more earnestly then he could on his own. He would no doubt, rise faster and the money would be far superior. It was exactly what someone in his career would wish for. His rational, sound mind could not deny any of these things. His feelings were less obliging though. He hated that man. Wanted continually to run, get as far away from the one person who had held him under their thumb. Tom resented being controlled. Could he continue one in the same way? He asked himself. Now was not the time for introspection though. He would have to answer before his silence was taken for disrespect which would inevitably lead to a row. \"That is most generous of you Uncle.\" \"I know,\" the old man drawled seeming to require a more specific response from his quite nephew. \"I would be honored for the position.\" Tom lied through his teeth but knew that anything less would be considered unacceptable to his Uncle. \"At the end of your reviews you will begin immediately with my office. Of course you will continue to live here at Bond Street. That is unless you have any more romantic notions of marriage.\" The old man sneered the word. Tom felt his anger begin to boil. He was mocking him, wanting to get a rise, but he would not give him the pleasure. \"No,\" he responded coolly despite his irritation. \"Of course not.\" Tom had stormed back to his rooms in such a state that the lone servant he meet in the hall immediately stopped what they were doing and went back the way they had come. Brandy in hand he paced back and forth in his room. The familiar frustration pulsing through his veins making him jumpy. He would find a way to resign himself, he had to. Unless he could think of a way to get out of the old man's offer. \"There is no use,\" he groaned before refilling his glass. He wouldn't mind getting abhorrently drunk tonight. He didn't usually indulge to such excess but the time seemed right. After an hour or so of drinking and brooding he was feeling the effect. Another glass and he would be ready to fall into his bed. Undressing down to his pants and shirttails he went to extinguish the candles. Before he could vanquish himself to the darkness there was a low knock at his door. \"What do you want,\" he growled as he wretched the door open. The poor serving girl shrunk back at his tone. He was too far gone in his dark mood to care. \"Sir, you...you...\" she stuttered, \"forgot your post.\" She thrust the letters at him before dipping a low curtsy and hurrying away. He shook his head as he closed the door and retreated back into the almost dark room. He took the letters to the one candle still lit and fingered through them quickly. A letter from his mother that could wait until tomorrow and a few general invitations to some gathering or other. His vision was getting blurry and he swayed a little on his feet. The spirits taking a stronger hold. He put the last one, a small thing closer to the light to read the address. His heart instantly stopped when he saw the feminine script. He tore the letter open, daring to hope that it was what he thought it could be. He quickly glanced over the text before settling on the name of the sender. \"Jane\" he declared into to the darkness before sinking back onto his bed and allowing himself to fall into a fitful sleep.[Chapter 4] Four The air still held its early morning crispness as Jane and Cassandra set off on the familiar walk to Overton. They kept a leisurely pace down the lane, past the giant yew tree and through the little village of Steventon. They were both avid walkers and took the opportunity to visit the small shops and friends they had in the area as often as they could. Although recent circumstances being what they were, they had neglected this walk for some time. This morning though, the usual pleasure of the experience was heightened, for Jane especially. Of course the excuse for the trip had been to pick up some odds and ends they knew their mother needed, but in actuality it was the post that called to them. Knowing it would be hard to keep anyone else from noticing Jane's letters from Mr. Lefroy, they decided to head out early to get the mail themselves. Hopefully avoiding any uncomfortable questions. They narrowly managed to avoid Eliza this morning but only because she seemed to need more sleep than the others. Cassandra and Jane both loved their cousin but she seemed in some way spiteful of Jane's misfortunes. She would not be a part of this new development. Jane was pleasantly surprised to find she was enjoying the errand. A smile graced her full lips for more than just the prospect of a letter from Tom. It had been ages since she felt free enough to enjoy herself outside of the home. She had timed this trip for the exact amount of days it would take for her letter to reach him and for his to follow, if he wrote back within a day. As foolish as she knew it was, she believed he would. \"It's a beautiful morning isn't it?\" Cassandra asked her in a wistful tone. \"Yes,\" Jane replied quietly. There was little need for conversation and they both enjoyed the pleasure of companionable silence. Cassandra watched her sister's face for any signs of discomfort. Jane was proud and wouldn't allow others to see it, but she knew that it was hard for her to ignore the stares and comments about her failed attachment. Church had been tense but not altogether uncomfortable. This outing would be different though. It was likely they would see and make conversation with the people they had both been studiously avoiding. It was time though, to get on with it. They couldn't hide forever. Loping her arm though her sisters she decided that if Jane could smile, so could she. A smile, a few waves, and a simple good morning were all the attentions that had so far been required of her. Jane could feel the relief radiating out of her sister as they made their way through Overton unencumbered. There were people about but the early hour was in their favor. Of the people they had seen none had been of their particular acquaintance. Jane could feel herself getting almost giddy as they walked up to the Lamppost Inn. A particularly tired looking older gentleman kindly held the door for them as they entered. She wished she had held her breath when she passed his raised arm. By the look Cassandra gave her she knew her sister was thinking the same thing. The Lamppost was the closet Inn outside of Basingstoke and served many a purpose for the surrounding villagers. The most important to Jane at the moment was that they collected the post before it was sent farther out. In the dim light she could see that there were a few lonely looking travelers eating at the rough wooden tables with a serving girl flitting between them quite gracefully, depositing plates of food and mugs of ale. At the scent Jane's stomach lurched. She had been too excited to eat any breakfast this morning. Now she wished she had at least grabbed something small to tide her over. \"Can I help you?\" The sisters turned to the large woman who had called out to them. She was sitting behind a long dingy counter that ran the length of the room. \"Yes you can,\" Jane said walking over to her. \"Were here to pick up the post.\" She tried to sound determined even though she had never done this before. She gave the woman what she attempted to be a friendly smile; it went unreturned. \"Name?\" the woman asked in sharp tones. \"Austen,\" Jane and Cassandra answered at the same time. The woman gave them both a shrewd look. \"We always send a rider out with your letters and now you're picking them up here. Is this going to be a permanent change?\" \"No,\" Jane said quickly but then on further thought continued. \"Unless someone comes in the morning to collect them please continue to have them sent on.\" \"I'll make a note of it. One minute please.\" The woman ducked down and seemed to be looking for something. Jane could feel her heart sputter with anticipation. But what if it wasn't there? Her anticipation quickly turned to dread but then just as quickly went back to excitement. \"Ah, here we are.\" The woman said coming up with a short stake of letters. Cassandra watched her sister squirm and fidget as the proprietor's wife looked for their mail. If she didn't know better shed think her sister was in a snit. Jane's rushed words and harsh expression were no doubt the reason for the woman's own curt behavior. What her poor Jane must be feeling. The smile she tried to give earlier was almost laughable. As the women held the letters out Jane didn't move. She just stood their staring at them. Cassandra quickly grabbed a coin from her purse and laid it on the counter. \"Thank you,\" she said taking the letters. The woman nodded before going back to her work. \"Let's go,\" she said softly, taking her sister arm and leading her out of the Inn. Jane followed obediently until the bright morning light hit her eyes and she squinted with the contrast from the dark Inn. It was enough to wake her from her self-imposed stupor. Turning quickly to her sister she reached out for the letters, but quickly thought better of it and dropped her hand. \"You look.\" She said closing her eyes and taking a deep steadying breath. Part of her knew she would laugh at her behavior later on, at the moment though she was content to act like a silly over emotional girl. She opened her eyes to her sisters smiling face. It couldn't be bad news then. Without a word Cassandra handed her the small square of parchment. For a minute she allowed herself to run her fingers along the paper and admire her name written in his strong script. How could receiving a letter be so pleasurable? She hadn't even read it yet. At that thought she looked around and remembered they were standing on a busy street and no doubt attracting the attention of the local gossips. She tucked the letter safely away in her purse. She would just have to wait until they got home to read it. \"Come on Cassie,\" she said taking her arm and turning immediately back the way they came. Cassandra didn't argue but instantly knew that they would be walking much faster home then they did coming. Cassandra kept up with her sisters determined strides even though she was feeling winded. Jane was in a hurry to get home and read her letter. She couldn't begrudge her that. They were almost home when they turned onto the lane that led through Steventon and saw something that was destined to hold them up. Mrs. and Miss Smith were standing outside their cottage saying their hellos to anyone passing by. Why had she not thought of them? Jane knew they came out every morning in search of company, and yet she had forgotten that they would most likely run into them on their way back home. \"There will be no avoiding it now,\" Cassandra whispered, \"they've seen us.\" \"We shall just have to be polite and do our best to extricate ourselves before dinner time.\" Jane replied jokingly to her sister. Cassandra was right, there was nothing to be done about it now. \"Ah,\" Miss Smith called out, \"if it isn't the Miss Austen's. How wonderful to see you this morning. I was just saying to mama that it had been many weeks since we've had your company. No illnesses I hope?\" \"Oh but of course not,\" she continued not waiting for an answer. \"I would have heard from Mr. Jenson if anyone of our acquaintance was unwell. He comes quite regular you know, to see mama. But don't trouble yourselves with worry she is quite healthy.\" \"That is good to hear. Your garden is looking lovely.\" Cassandra said by way of a diversion before Miss. Smith could continue. \"Oh yes. But come and see the roses.\" She said before walking to the side of the cottage leaving her mother to stand and stare at seemingly nothing. Cassandra and Jane followed knowing this was a regular occurrence. Mrs. Smith was practically blind and almost deaf. Unfortunately neither Jane nor Cassandras compliments to her garden could distract her for long. \"Oh what am I prattling on about now, you must come in and take tea with us.\" Miss Smith said exactly what Jane was hoping she wouldn't. \"Do not you think so Mama?\" She called loudly. \"We would not wish to impose on you. We were not expected.\" Jane rushed trying to avoid accepting the invitation. Which was in the end, futile. After much fussing from Miss Smith and many pointed glances between Jane and Cassandra they were all seated in the small sitting room of the Smith's cottage drinking their tea and making conversation. Jane let Cassandra carry most of the formal conversation topics while she tried to keep herself from eating more cakes than was proper for an afternoon tea. Once again she wished she had taken breakfast. Her purse, which contained Tom's letter, sat squarely in her lap. She tried her best but couldn't help staring at it. It felt as if it would burn a hole through her skirts. Drifting from the conversation she found her self-wondering what he had written. She tried to picture him writing it. Would he be serious and passionate as his fist letter suggested? Or was he more composed when he wrote this? The romantic part of her hoped it was the former. She wanted him to be just as affected as she was. \"Jane,\" she heard someone call her name and was instantly brought out of her daydreams. \"Forgive me, I'm feeling a bit tired this morning.\" She tried to explain. \"Are you sure you are not unwell? You look rather flushed.\" Miss Smith asked with concern written on her face. \"Should I get you a glass of wine?\" \"No thank you, I am fine. It has been a while since I took such a long walk. I fear I have overexerted myself.\" Miss Smith set her cup down and peered at her in a strange way. Jane knew that whatever she was going to say next, she wouldn't like. \"I have to tell you Miss Austen, you are very brave. Very brave indeed, showing such a strong face after the – incident. Mama and I knew that young man must have used you very ill indeed. And anyone who would look down on you because of it is not worth your time. Your true friends will stand by you, do not worry about that.\" Jane could feel her face going white with those words. This was not something she wanted, or even expected to hear. Although it was better than the snide remarks she knew would eventually come her way, this somehow seemed worse. Because in the eyes of the neighborhood spinster she saw pity. Jane felt anger and embarrassment in equal measure. \"That is very kind of you to say but I'm sure neither Jane nor I have any comment on that account.\" Cassandra said coolly. She knew she needed to get Jane out of there. Miss Smith meant well but the condescension was too much to bear at the moment. Miss Smith had the decency to look rebuked and kept quiet. Cassandra knew from experience though that it wouldn't last long. \"Thank you so much for having us, but I fear I must get Jane home now. She is excessively tired at the moment. Please feel free to return the call when you are available.\" Jane and Cassandra stood quickly and made their goodbyes to the women. \"Feel better dear. Call for Mr. Jenson if you have need.\" They heard Miss Smith call out to them as they walked toward home. Neither of them turned to look though. Jane was incredibly thankful that her sister had gotten them out of there so quickly but wasn't ready to put words to her gratitude yet. She was lost in the maelstrom of her emotions. To be so happy at the prospect of reading the letter from Tom and then to be humiliated with the reminder of their foolish actions was more than she could process. By God she loved him, but her throat burned with the embarrassment of having been pitied by that insufferable woman. She had a foreboding feeling of dread as the stopped and stood at the gate of her home. Could continuing her relationship with Tom bring anything other than ruin? For a minute she didn't know. \"Go read your letter.\" Cassie said softly in her ear before leading her over the makeshift bench by the road. \"I'll see you inside.\" She said before turning towards the house. Jane sat there very still for a minute before taking out the letter and studying it again. She shook her heard in confusion before opening it to read. Dearest Jane, How I wish I had the command of words as you do. I do not think my meager attempt to describe the feelings I had when I received your letter would do your descriptive sensibilities justice. Let me just say that it was an experience I sincerely hope is repeated. Honestly, I had been angry and disappointed with myself for writing to you in the first place. If I were a better man with stronger convictions I would leave you be. But I am selfish; as you well know by now. At present you will find that my thoughts have been only of my own misery. You and your own good nature are much better off without my interference. Yet, as I said before, I cannot - will not - let you go. I may be corruptible and disillusioned but I am constant. My one virtue you could say. Let that be my defense in what I am selfishly going to ask of you. Wait for me Jane, please. I have not even begun to think practically, but I know myself and I will wait for you until the end. But know that I would not begrudge you if you choose not to honor my request. I know how much I am asking of you. Write to me again; let me know your thoughts as I wish you to know mine. I will go uncertain of my fate until I hear from you again. Tom And with his words her confusion was gone. Their love could never be anything other than right, other than perfect.[Chapter 5] Five Dearest Tom, I received your letter this morning and I have only now had the opportunity to sit and pen this response; it is well after midnight. I know you shall not be surprised, shrewd and observing as you are, when I tell you that our most beloved Henry has finally mustered the courage to make his intentions towards Eliza known to his family. I know what you are thinking and I agree. It took him long enough. Of course mother and father are in a bit of an uproar. I do suppose though that they are not as surprised as they seem. You would have to be deaf, dumb, and blind to not see their attachment to each other. Poor George has been asking me for weeks now when they would marry. I confess I am impatient for that day as well. The removal of the two most, how shall I say it, expensive members of the household will bring much relief to my father. We shall all benefit from their union, and in more ways than one. Cassandra and I firmly believe that things at Steventon will settle into a peaceful familial environment when the passionate and, dare I say, indecorous, lovers are removed from the confines of this house. Father will once again have the quiet he needs for his sermons and mother will have much less to plague her nerves. Although it may leave her feeling bereft of excitement. Especially since she has come to admit defeat in the prospect of marrying off her daughters. She doesn't seem to be able to bring herself to hope that Cassandra will ever forget Mr. Fowl and my inability to marry anyone is quite fixed in her mind. I am happy of it. Ever since the horrors of the great lady, whose name we both know but shall not speak, and the insufferable Mr. Warren, I feel incapable of handling any addresses to myself with any more grace than one would show a lame animal. Somedays I imagine I should like a gun. So I could put them out of their misguided romantic misery. I cannot deny that I am thankful that my charms were enough to attract your attention but if one more man declares his love me for me I will pull my hair out while screaming a litany of improper words. But back to your letter. I fear, dear friend, that when you praise my descriptive sensibilities you are under a misapprehension. I suffer from an overindulgence of adjectives. Which as any good writer knows is often as crippling to the expression of true feelings than that of a lacking prose. Honest sentiments are often best conveyed with poignant brevity. Although I must confess it is a skill which I do not possess; as you will no doubt become painfully aware of now that you have received my letters. I could of course go on and on about the subject of myself and my many talents, or as the case is in this letter; the lack thereof, but it will only be to delay writing the inevitable. I have thought for many hours on how I would word my response to your question. Alas wit and flowery words fail me and I can only answer yes. Yes I shall wait for you, my only love, until the day comes that we can be together. Because as you so aptly put it once before, 'what value will there be in life if we are not together'? So let my answer be the end to all your talk of selfishness and self-recriminations. For if you are selfish than so am I; and selfishness must always be forgiven, for there is no hope of a cure. Yours with unending love, Jane[Chapter 6] Six Jane, How is it you so easily know my mind? You are completely correct in my response to the news of Henry's engagement. It is about time. I had wondered how long it would take for Madam de Feuillide to make an honest man out of him. Tell me, has he secured his captaincy? It is nice to hear that they will be happy. I know it is quite morose of me to comment, but someone should be. Not that I am completely miserable anymore. Reading your letters has not only soothed my poor pathetic heart but they have become quite entertaining. Your description on how you would like to reject your numerous suitors was... enlightening. Rest assured my love that when we are married, and if we aren't completely decrepit and infirm at such a point, you shall have your gun. If only to save myself the unpleasant task of chasing off your wayward paramours. You will probably chastise me greatly for saying this but I had the most delightful image of your pretty little mouth forming words you shouldn't be allowed to know. Terrible of me I know, but I must stay true to my character. I will not take offense if you were to write me back with the most scaling insult to my poor character. Actually I would quite enjoy it. You see there is little else to occupy my thoughts but you these days. I have had the great misfortune to fall into my Uncles good graces, which for the life of me I can't imagine how I managed it. The result of said misfortune is that I am forced to spend more time with him than any sensible person would allow. He has taken me under his proverbial wing and I am now working in his office under his most officious care. Pity me my love. Enough though of my omnipresent woes; how is your writing? Does anything your working on have a pretentious Irishman of dubious intent wreaking havoc upon the unsuspecting country populous? If not then I am deeply disappointed. I might not be good for much but even I know that I would be good literary fodder. Your stories must have a devilishly handsome rake. Jane, how I miss you. Reading your letters has been like a sweet torture. I love to read your words but they leave me longing to hear your voice. I am not sure that I am adequately explaining myself. I would say that I pine for you but that is far too prosaic for me. I hope you get the gist of what I'm trying to convey in regards to my feelings. Part of me is elated at your answer. That little yes meant more to me than you will ever know. Yet the more sensible part of me is constantly aware that I may be holding you to a fools promise. What if things do not change? Can I live with myself if I make you wait year after year before you can claim your place by my side? This whole situation is very frustrating. Although until a few short weeks ago it was even worse. At least I am secure in your love and affection. How quickly I forget that it has been given to me so undeservedly. You must forgive my depressing correspondence this time. I fear that I am not well suited for waiting. Patience has never been one of my virtues. Yet I hope that like my selfishness it can be forgiven. Because I fear that when the waiting is for something as cherished as you, I shall never be patient. Yours, Tom P.S. I hope you realize that I expect an immediate response to the following question. What happened with that imbecile Warren?[Chapter 7] Seven My Dear Tom, I see that you have not lost any of your wickedness. Not even in light of your present good behavior. I'm glad of it. Although I am practically scandalized by the inner workings of your mind, well almost anyway. But if you are very good I may oblige you at some point in the future. Rest assured Mr. Lefroy that while I probably shouldn't know any number of words I am more than apt at pronouncing them. One of the best things about having you back in my life, even if it is only partially, is the ability to allow my own wicked nature an outlet. Poor Cassandra has to put up with my foul moods and temper more than she should and my sardonic sense of humor is by far too much for her. But you my friend seem to have the constitution necessary to be a companion to one such as myself. Do you consider yourself lucky? I most certainly do; a husband who will provide me a gun, how scandalous! Well, on to the more serious topics of conversation. I am sorry that you are not enjoying your employment at present. If it is any conciliation I have not written much since my last trip to London. Your excuse though is far more tangible than mine. The dour Judge must be a very difficult person to work with, especially considering you live with him as well. You are brilliant though Tom, and I don't pay the compliment lightly. I have every confidence that you will work the situation to the best of your ability. You must also have the same faith in me. I confess that my hiatus from my writing has come to an end but I am almost afraid to continue. I find myself in a more complex mental and emotional state; I almost don't know how to channel it. My only hope is that I will be able to bring a greater depth and maturity to my work that I will admit had been lacking before. Cross your fingers and I will let you know. Unfortunately I do not have any Irish rouges at present in my latest story. But before you begin to feel too put out I will say that there is a character who shares a fair amount a personality traits with yourself. Whether they are the good or bad will be for you to decide when you eventually read it. I think you would enjoy it though. Things here have been busier than usual with preparations for the wedding. Henry and Eliza have elected to have father marry them here at Steventon. We were all rather surprised that Eliza didn't want something more refined. Everyone's spirits are higher with such an exciting event on the horizon. Mine might be a little less enthusiastic, but let us keep that between ourselves. Henry did purchase his captaincy and after the wedding they will be traveling to Plymouth for his first station. I cannot imagine my cousin aboard a frigate but we all do strange things for love. There has also been talk of letting some fashionable accommodations in town for the season, so we shall see. I so wish you would be able to attend but I know it is quite impossible. The waiting is hard on me as well. I just take care to remind myself daily to be thankful to have your love. It very well may be a few years before we can settle together but I am certain you are worth the wait. Finally though we get to your persistent question. What of Mr. Warren? You will have to forgive me for mentioning the situation so offhandedly in my last letter. I had quite forgotten that you did not know the details of that event and how disastrous it was for us both. Let me try and explain. Apparently our timid and soft spoken Mr. Warren had been quite in love with me for some time. Terrible, I know. Somehow I seemed to have mistaken his feelings of friendship and never once did I ever entertain the idea that he may have any intentions towards me. Mr. Warren had not been at all happy with our attachment and when presented with the information of our travel to London he took actions that had far reaching consequences. You will no longer be in any doubt of who wrote the Judge that day. I did not have this information until after our failed elopement. Like you I had been under the assumption that the letter had come from or on behalf of Mr. Wisely. Now we come to the particular event. The afternoon that I returned home after parting from you at the post station, I was not more than two minutes in the house before Mr. Warren found me. My family had been out looking for me and we were alone. He finally saw his opening and took it. He proceeded to profess his undying love for me and offer me his hand. I believe my last letter gave you an indication on how I felt at that moment. After refusing him as politely as I was able under the circumstances I made to extricate myself from his company. It was then that it suddenly dawned on me. He was the one who wrote the judge. I don't know if you will believe it but I almost struck him. Some days I still wish I had. So that my dearest, is the account of the Warren situation. It was most likely one of the worst days of my life. But now I can look back on it with a little humor. It may have been the most frustrating and uncomfortable proposal I have ever received but at least it was ripe with irony. Which I can appreciate in all things. Now that I have finally finished that account I must adieu. All my love, Jane[Chapter 8] Eight There are certain days designed by God for weddings. Late summer mornings flooded with pale yellow light. A soft breeze carrying the scent of hundreds of flowers handpicked and arranged to compliment the bride. Eliza was a vision in ivory silk and cascading brunette curls. She had always been beautiful but today she was glorious. Henry was as dashing as ever in his vibrant red regimentals. The pews were packed full and all eyes were drawn to where the bride and groom stood flanked by Jane and Cassandra as the requisite maids. Jane clasped her hands in front of her as the organ music came to a close and her father started the ceremony. She had been to more than her fair share of weddings and contented herself with admiring the general splendor of the day. The words were always the same and her father's voice seemed to tune out into a gentle hum. Her thoughts drifted inevitably to Tom but she knew that she had to keep her feelings in check today, there was too much riding on her performance. Friends and neighbors were all gathered for Henry and Eliza's wedding. It would be the first occasion that she was in company with most of them in months. She would need to be the Jane they all knew before Tom, happy and carefree. The time to hide from their distasteful judgments had passed. It was on her now to prove to them all that she was the same and therefor deserved the same treatment. Taking a quick glance across the church she knew it would be easier said than done. If she was being honest with herself though only one family really mattered; the Lefroy's. They had been in close company for years and the loss of friendship was a hardship for both families. The situation being what it was, a temporary separation seemed unavoidable. The thought of sitting down to tea with his aunt while she had nothing on her mind but the ladies nephew had seemed daunting. It was avoided for as long as possible. Now was judgment day. Jane smiled at her own maudlin line of thinking. It wasn't really appropriate given the present circumstance. Her brother was getting married for heaven's sake. She should endeavor to be more pleasant. She reigned in her wandering attention in just in time to see Henry take his bride up into a passionate kiss. Cassandras reproachful expression caught her eye and she chocked back a laugh. Typical. She would have to remember to add that little tid-bit in her next letter. Tom would not doubt find humor in it. The procession from the church to the wedding luncheon was a swirling mass of music, flowers and well wishes. Jane easily lost herself in the celebratory mood was feeling quite contented. Cassandra was having a more difficult time. She was too good to acknowledge her feelings for what they were. Instead she pushed the deep sadness aside and dwelt on the wonder of the couples love. They were fortunate indeed to not only have found one another but to have attained the status of marriage. Something she knew she would never have within her sights again. It was those thoughts that threatened to keep the joy from her face. She was truly and sincerely happy for her brother. No amount of regret on her part could dim the delight she felt when she looked upon the happy couple. The pain of her loss would always be with her so she endeavored to enjoy herself the only way she knew how. \"Henry is a demonstrative man but did he really need to make such a spectacle?\" She spoke low into Jane's ear before turning back to her plate. Her sister's lips turned up into a smirk and she knew she had bated Jane into what would prove to be a most entertaining conversation. \"The kiss. Well I can't say I was surprised. But did you see the look on Miss Smiths face? I do believe between Henry and myself we will completely scandalize the family.\" \"At least he's finally married.\" Cassandra quipped mimicking Miss Smiths affected accent. Jane couldn't hold back her laugh so she tried to quickly disguise it as a cough. \"You are quite humorous today.\" She said pointedly to her sister. \"I might even venture to say your acting as bad as me.\" Jane was pleased to see Cassie in such good humor. She knew the wedding couldn't have been easy for her to experience. Her own memories of Tom were bitter sweet today. How much worse would Cassandra's be for her own lost love? As in most things of late they stuck close to each other. Each sister knowing what the other was feeling and trying to buoy the other with kind words and actions. Humor seemed to be the balm for the day so they allowed their banter to flow readily throughout the meal. Keeping their comments restricted to those of the party of little consequence and vehemently ignoring the task before them. The table was full and Mrs. Lefroy was seated at the opposite end of where the Austen family sat. The cake had been cut and passed and the guests were rising to see the couple off. Jane and Cassandra stood arm in arm as Henry and Eliza made their way the waiting carriage. Instead of throwing flower petals they stood quietly by, memorizing the last blissful images of the morning. As the carriage pulled away Jane's nerves reared their ugly head. Her stomach churned and her head began to ache. She wasn't exactly sure when it happened but apparently she had become quite the coward. Mr. and Mrs. Lefroy began to make their way over to the two young women. Mrs. Lefroy decided not to acknowledge Jane's obvious nervous tension and greeted her warmly. \"It was a lovely wedding. We were so glad to have been included among the guests.\" \"We were just happy you could join us.\" Cassandra replied steering the conversation with social pleasantries. \"How have you ladies been this season? We haven't seen much of either of you. I hope that will soon change. \"We have been well, have we not Jane?\" \"We have.\" Jane answered. \"I hope we shall see more of you as well Mrs. Lefroy.\" The two woman looked at each other in silent acknowledgment of things past and acceptance of friendship to come. Jane had been so worried that Mrs. Lefoy would hold her responsible for everything that happen with Tom. But it seemed the older woman was willing to look past that and continue their acquaintance in spite of the interlude with her nephew. The information made Jane feel as if a weight had been lifted from her shoulders. \"Whenever you ladies and your mother are available next week I hope you will take the time to call. Lucy and I would enjoy catching up with you all. \"That is very kind of you. We will certainly pay the call.\" Jane gave her a winning smile as a thanks which was returned just as warmly. Shortly after that the Lefroys drifted away and Jane made easy conversation with the rest of the guests. Most people were as polite as ever with the exception of a few colder greetings. In retrospect though Jane considered the whole event to be a success. \"How do you feel now that it's finally over?\" Cassandra asked her as they retired to their room. The day had been long and tiring with many pent up emotions. But there was a feeling of satisfaction that seemed to settle over the whole house. \"It is a relief,\" she said settling herself onto the soft mattress. \"To finally put myself out among people again. No more pretending.\" She said while slowly removing the pins from her hair. \"Of course I'm thrilled too that Henry is finally married and settled. One less thing for us to worry about.\" \"I think I understand exactly what you are saying. It is my hope that things can begin to return to normal.\" \"It's mine as well. Not that I don't enjoy the Smiths company,\" she said ruefully. \"But even you, sweet Cassie, have to admit that it would be beneficial to widen our circle of society to something more like it used to be.\" Cassandra just smiled at her sister and settled into bed, hoping to find sleep quickly. She knew Jane had received a letter today but hadn't had the chance to read it. She would give her as much privacy as possible, so closed her eyes and willed her body to relax. Maybe she would dream of Robert tonight. Once Cassandra's breathing evened and slowed, Jane knew it was safe to take out her letter. She had read previous letters in front of her sister but after the long day, she wanted to enjoy Tom's words in solitude, without anyone aware of her expressions and mannerisms. Slipping her finger under the wax seal she broke it swiftly and silently unfolded the letter. She was instantly disappointed to see that the page contained only a few lines. A disheartening number of words compared to his usual correspondence. Though her irritation instantly turned to excitement as she read. Jane, Forgive me for this hasty letter but my time is not my own at present. All I can say at the moment is that in a weeks' time I should be able to write again in a longer and more detailed account of my days. But hold out a little longer, for the next letter should have great news. I love you my dear, Tom What could this great news be? Knowing Tom it could mean any number of things. Once again Jane resigned herself to waiting. Patience was something she was beginning to have in abundance.[Chapter 9] Nine Any names you did not already recognize are my creations. I will say though that they are meant to be a sort of caricature of some of the characters in Jane's stories. It's my attempt to show some possible sources of inspiration. William Stout was a simple, congenial man. He had tried on many occasions to befriend the reclusive Tom Lefroy. No matter how cordial or easy he was in manner the other young man never seemed to notice. Every attempt to draw him into conversation had failed and at length William had decided it was no longer worth his time. For Tom Lefroy seemed to be a hopeless case, he had few friends and even less humor. Or at least that was what William believed until he heard an unmistakably jolly laugh coming from his neighbor. He looked over the see the man in question holding a letter and shaking with laughter. \"You all right there?\" he asked. Almost afraid Tom would snap at him for asking. He didn't seem to notice William had said anything for a moment. Then suddenly he looked up with shining eyes and said \"Yes. Everything is exactly right.\" Before turning back to his letter. Tom knew he must have looked ridiculous but couldn't bring himself to care. She was just so...Jane. He didn't know how else to describe it. He couldn't imagine anyone sending him a letter so to the point. He could envision her frowning at his hastily penned letter from last week. Of course Jane would have had to remind him that she would be waiting for his explanation. He couldn't help the laughter that escaped him with her words. My Dear, It better be great. Love, Jane Short, to the point, and completely Jane. It made his day, no it made his week. She was no doubt annoyed with him, but it would have to wait. He didn't want to tell her his news until it was all settled. It was also the truth that his time was not his own. The work with his uncle was tedious and time consuming. He was accustomed to it though and managed with little trouble. The real constraint to his time was the work he was doing on the side with Kensington. They had worked together on a case recently and found that their personalities were well suited for partnership. Kensington had been doing law consultation for hire in his spare time. It didn't make much money but they thought that between the two of them they had the tenants for a working business. Their plans gave him reason to hope for the future. A future where he could be dependent on himself. These lofty dreams required work though. Which is why he was exhausted enough to laugh loudly while surrounded by his colleagues. No doubt poor William was still reeling from his uncharacteristic outburst. He muttered a hasty 'excuse me' before returning to his work. He would need to skive out early from the office today and didn't want to leave any cause for the Judge to rail about. There would be no work left upon his desk. The tavern was well lit and nicely appointed. Tom wasn't completely pleased that they were having such an important gathering in a local tavern but their options were limited. He could not expect Kensington to entertain them in his humble dwelling and having their meeting under the Judges roof would be madness. So they would make do with what was available to them. He spoke quickly to the serving girl and procured a clean table closest to the fire where he sat to wait however impatiently for his comrade to appear. He resisted ordering a drink and instead occupied himself with rehearsing his notes and straightening his jacket. Smoothing out the dark green wool he smiled knowingly. It wasn't the velvet he previously preferred but the color was just as rich. Idly he wondered if Jane would like it. Frank Kensington was a tall man who was as lean and gangly as a newborn colt. Watching him walk would inevitably put you off from wanting to know him. But his warm and friendly nature quickly overrode that instinctual response. His unimpressive looks carefully disguised his keen mind. The subterfuge was something Tom recognized and admired. Both men were very alike in that way. Neither were really what they presented to the world. Tom had to admit that it was enjoyable to have a friend again. \"Fancy meeting you here.\" Kensington quipped while folding himself, quite ungracefully, into the short backed wooden chair. \"Small town.\" Tom couldn't help bantering with him. \"Ha, right you are old man. So any last words before we sell our souls?\" Kensington asked in a joking manner but with a hint of truth. It was a good approximation of what they were about to do. If this deal went through, both theirs lives would be intrinsically tied to this plan. Tom folded his hands behind his head in a brutish display of confidence. It was a gesture he had used frequently since childhood. He mulled over the thought of last words for a minute then decided against uttering any. Last words were for endings; tonight, he hoped, would be about beginnings. \"We won't settle for anything longer than a three month turn over.\" Tom had been walking the fine line between persistent and pushy for the last hour of negotiations. Kensington had been approached by one Mr. Charles Barnes attorney, about the sale of his rather profitable business. Mr. Barnes had no children was a confirmed bachelor for all of his sixty years. His partner had passed away last year and he complained constantly of being too old to carry on running the firm on his own. So rather than tracking down some obscure relative to inherit all his hard work he devised a plan to overturn ownership and retire profitably in Surrey of all places. Neither Tom nor Frank had the capital to purchase the firm out right, but that's what this meeting had been for. They were fairly confident, that between the two of them, they could negotiate something with the man. \"And I say six months is more than reasonable.\" The old man was driving a hard bargain. \"Why don't we meet in the middle and saw four and a half?\" Kensington, the softer voice of reason said. \"If that's the only condition left to agree on I have no problem accepting four and a half.\" Tom conceded. \"So what do you say Barnes? We have a deal?\" Both younger men stared at the older from across the table. There was a slight twitch in his left eye but other than that his face was unreadable. For a few minutes none of the party spoke a word and Tom began to worry that they had pushed their luck too far. But eventually the older man's face seemed to soften and his lips twitched up into a sad excuse for a smile. \"I still think you're asking for too many concessions but I like you both. Let's just get this over and done with. I'd like to be out of this god forsaken city by next summer.\" \"You most certainly shall. If you are available we could write the contract up and have it ready to sign by the end of the week.\" Bolstered by the agreement they had reached Tom quickly tied up all the loose ends and spoke the required pleasantries. I wouldn't do to have their new business associate think they were completely bereft of manners. Even if said manners weren't obviously present during the previous hour. \"I look forward to working with you gentlemen, but now I fear I must retire. These late hours are not kind to my aged constitution.\" \"Certainly sir,\" Tom said taking the man's hand in a firm yet clammy handshake. \"I think congratulations are in order,\" he said after Kensington had made his goodbyes and Mr. Barnes was safely out of earshot. Giving his trademark lopsided smile, Kensington took a deep flourishing bow. \"Your congratulations are most heartily accepted.\" He gave the shorter man a solid slap on the back before propelling him towards the bar. \"This calls for a least a few drinks, if not a barrel.\" Tom fixed him with a glare before his friend quickly allied his fears. \"Do not worry so Lefroy. I shan't keep you out passed your bed time.\" \"How kind.\" Tom responded but without any real sarcasm. He rather felt like a drink himself. He had been diligently keeping sober over the last few months, since Jane had come back into his life. Tonight would be an exception to the rule though. For as much as he knew it would be irresponsible to write to her when he was spirited, he couldn't pass up the opportunity to celebrate the one thing he'd manage to accomplish that might bring him closer to her. It was some time later that he stood pacing his rooms, pen in hand but mind empty of the right words. He was almost too excited to explain himself on paper. All he had managed to convey so far was a sparse retelling of facts. She would not appreciate that. Especially not after his last disappointing letter to her. He grabbed at his hair in frustration with himself. This would not do. Resigned to the fact that wearing a hole in his floor wouldn't be any assistance to his current dilemma, he sank heavily into the warm leather armchair that sat closet the hearth. Having one last idea he closed his eyes and imaged Jane in this very room with him. He imaged her a chair to match his own as they sat quietly before the fire enjoying each other's company. He stared openly at her in his imagination, appreciating the way the soft light from the fire made her eyes dark and her hair shine. The shadows that ebbed and flowed across her pale skin would highlight the hollow of her throat and the soft curve of her collarbones. His dream Jane would give him a mischievous smile, as if she knew exactly what he had been thinking. God how he loved her. The woman was a lesson in dichotomy; equal parts innocence and temptation, all wrapped up in a soft and warm package, and decorated with a captivating wit. In other words designed to be almost irresistible to one Tom Lefroy. A traitorous voice in the back of his mind questioned why he would have resist her. After all it was his imagination, what was to stop his dream self from reaching out, pulling her into his lap, digging his fingers deep into her silky hair and claiming her mouth in a kiss. \"Hell!\" He said loudly, jerking upright in his chair, eyes wide open, trying to adjust to the light. He must have been indulging in that train of thought longer than he intended. Maybe he should put off writing until tomorrow. Heaven knows he couldn't afford to let his thoughts drift that way twice in one night. He might just wake up and find himself on the road to Hampshire with every intention of stealing her away, and then where would they be.[Chapter 10] Ten Tom, I realize that I just sent my little missive two days ago, but I couldn't keep from writing again. I do want to know what your news is, desperately in fact, but I am confident that you will inform me as soon as you are able. I hope you didn't take my note the wrong way. So as a sign of good faith I decided that I could write to you again instead of waiting for your response. It's perfectly sensible, is it not? Besides, I knew you would be waiting on pins and needles for a detailed description of the wedding. Men often pretend to think little of these things but you by dear must enjoy it. Yes, I am laughing at you. You must forgive me though because at the moment of writing this, I'm in quite a happy mood. I shall tell you why in a moment. First I shall regale you with all the boring little details of the wedding between your two favorite people. Starting with the weather, which was perfection. Nary a cloud in the sky and it was not too hot. The bride was everything lovely in ivory satin and lace from Paris. Everyone was in raptures over it, although it was a little low cut for my personal taste. It's a wonder how she gets away with it. Our groom was as dashing as ever. The red regimentals are quite complimentary with his fair coloring. It convinced me to insist that Cassandra wear more red. I of course cannot manage the color. I had the unfortunate luck to be born with dark hair. The ceremony was in my father's traditional economical style and was performed with as much elegance as could be expected in a country chapel. There had been speculation that the bride would not be quite satisfied with the arrangements, but if that was the case you would never know it. Eliza was luminescent in her happiness. The luncheon was comfortable and the food quite delicious. There was more variety of dishes than I suspect was really necessary but not one guest went away not proclaiming high praise of the meal. Now though I shall get into the more interesting news, the guests. Needless to say everyone that was invited did indeed attend. It was the perfect opportunity to reacquaint myself with some of the families that I had seen little of since the story of our running away was passed around. You must be proud of me though because I behaved myself very well and even succeeded in swaying a few of the more difficult guests back into my favor. The most promising part of the day was when I spoke with your aunt, Mrs. Lefroy. The meeting took place with only the best possible outcome being the result. You cannot know how pleased I was at that. All prejudice or derision was put aside, and though not quite the same, the warmth with which she greeted me left me in no doubt of her continuing affections. We are slated to have them over for tea Thursday next. I know it's not much but renewing the friendly relations with your family can only be a boon to our situation. Now back to why I'm in such a jolly mood. I don't know if the feelings will translate but I have had the most spectacular, creative, inspirational, romantic, prolific, and intense writing session. I dare say session is not quite the right word, for it lasted two whole days and nights. The novel I began in London is finally coming together and I must admit I am very pleased with my progress. I cannot wait to share it with you. I should finish this letter though. Two nights of little to no sleep has left me quite exhausted. Please hurry and try to write again. I miss reading something new. All my love, Jane[Chapter 11] Eleven Jane, I do not even know where to start with this letter. There is so much I yearn to convey, to explain. I wish we were together, so you could see my excitement and I could read the expression in your eyes. Of course that is not the only reason I wish we were together corporeally. But I do not think I should expound on that count. Firstly, I am happy that Henry and Eliza's wedding was such a success, and that you enjoyed yourself. I do not believe you could ever comprehend the grief I feel when I think on what you have suffered because of me. Continue, my dear, to enjoy the society of those around you. No one could possibly remember my rakish ways when met with your charm and vivacity. You are above reproach. My aunt is a level headed woman who no doubt still has as much affection for you as ever. It pleases me to know that you will be renewing the relationship with my family. They, like everyone else, is better for knowing you. I shall enjoy picturing you in the familiar rooms of the lodge once again. The library in particular. Sometimes I shudder to think of the flirtatious things I said to you there. I could never seem to control my tongue when in your presence. Do you know that I cannot enter a library, or even a room housing a small collection of books, without recalling our conversation that day? No doubt you recognize how difficult a condition this is. Not only does my position of employment require me to frequent book containing establishments but it also requires that I look respectable and present. The inevitable wool gathering this condition triggers is quite embarrassing. But enjoyable none the less. While I am on the subject of books and their influence on my 'senses', perhaps I should congratulate you on the progress you have made with your own. Is it wrong of me to anticipate being able to read it? Or shall I never be forgiven for calling your work accomplished? I have lately been working on my own accomplishments. No secret to you of course, but I had no plans to continue working for my Uncle indefinitely. For reasons both of his personality, as well as the direction it would have taken me professionally. So I am happy to report that my situation has just recently changed. Let me give you the story. A Mr. Burnes of Grace Church Street has been running a very successful law firm for the past thirty years. His partner recently passed away and he is without any immediate family. Which leads us to the particulars. He had no desire to leave his business to an unknown relative so he sought out a friend of mine to consider a transfer of ownership. I do not recall if I have written to you of Frank Kensington. He is a fellow attorney and we seem singularly suited to one another. He is a charming fellow, but quick witted, with quite the sense of humor. I have observed more than once that you would find him amusing. You would also find the old Mr. Burnes amusing as well, but for quite different reasons. Being the connoisseur of human folly that you are. Kensington and I have arranged with him to take over his business within the next few months. Mr. Burnes will continue to be a silent partner in this endeavor since neither Kensington nor I have the means to purchase out right. This will give us a chance to build up our reputation and client list. It is not much right now but it is a start. I will be dependent on myself. Jane, that makes me so satisfied. The only thing missing is you. Soon, my love. Think of me, dear one, for tomorrow I speak to my uncle. I have little hope that my news will be well received. I am determined to keep his favor though. How, I am not sure, but I shall think of something. I do not need him as my enemy. At the risk of sounding sentimental I will close this letter with all the assurances of my love and affection. I miss you. Yours always, - Tom P.S. Contrary to your previous statement I find it quite fortunate that you were born with dark hair. I believe it to be my favorite feature of yours.[Chapter 12] Twelve \"Shall we enjoy ourselves this evening or stay in staunch disdain of the company\"? \"Jane,\" Cassandra scolded, \"Do not say such things! You know perfectly well that we shall enjoy our evening at Lefroy lodge, even you stubborn one.\" Jane scowled at her well-tempered sister and watched as she meticulously brushed out her soft golden hair. She was not feeling generous tonight. Whether it was nerves or just a general inclination towards aggravation, she did not know. What she did know was that they were to have dinner with the Lefroys and the party would include the Smiths. Mrs. and Miss Smith were manageable enough in private, but in company they possessed the singular ability to say just the thing to ruin an evening. Jane had no doubt it would be used at her expense. Or even worse, at Cassandras. She chose her attire without much care and dressed at a leisurely pace they really could not afford. Cassandra made no move to rush her though. She knew the sting her sister's words could hold when she was in a mood. Cassandra had no desire to be on the receiving end of a Jane diatribe. She felt no ill will toward her sister though. Intimidating though she may have been at present, she knew it was coming from an insecure place. The two sisters moved about their room in a practiced economy that spoke of many nights like this one. Here in this small, warm room, they were safe, sheltered from the outside world. A world that neither had fully re-entered after heartbreak. Jane escaping into her writing and Cassandra into household work. Jane's fingers itched to hold her pen once more. She had done little else but write for days on end. Maybe the forceful removal from her characters was to blame for her foul mood. She was deeply involved in the maelstrom of emotions between Elizabeth and Darcy at present. But they were to dinner and it would be impolitic to allow her thoughts to remain so engaged in her written world. So with careful deliberation she froze the story in her mind, letting it hold for the time being. Seeing her sister struggle to clasp her necklace in front of the mirror, in the same fashion she had done many times before, pulled Jane out of her selfishness. With light fingers she brushed her sisters hand out of the way and fastened the pearls, adjusting them so they lay just so. Cassandra leaned back slightly into her sister's warmth and moved to reassure with words. \"I dare say you shall find the evening quite amiable if you apply yourself.\" \"And how do you suggest I apply myself?\" Jane asked with a wry smile on her lips. \"You know very well what I suggest. Watch, mimic, laugh, all the little things you have always done before. Continue to be you, Jane.\" She spoke quickly and with a sense of urgency Jane wasn't expecting. Although she should have expected it. Cassie was always chastising her in the most efficient ways. \"You're right, of course.\" She said restraining herself from making lite of her sisters words. \"Of course,\" Cassandra replied, earning a short yet sweet peal of laughter from her sister. The quiet family of four stood as one when the dark lacquered carriage pulled up in front of the main gate. It was early evening and the light was fading out into a gray haze. They were certainly a sight. Mr. and Mrs. Austen standing close with arms all tangled in between; Jane and Cassandra still as stones, standing at attention. Had there ever been such an odd party? The elders more happy and affectionate than the young. But so was the way of life in that small part of Hampshire. Jane felt a tight pinch as she ascended the front steps of Lefroy Lodge. \"Jane\" she heard her sister hiss sharply in her ear. She turned and gave Cassie an inquisitive look. What could she be on about? \"You wore the dress with the hole,\" she explained in a low whisper. It took Jane only a few seconds to understand what her sister was saying. \"Oh no,\" she breathed looking down at the train of her dress. The hole was obvious to the observer. 'This is exactly what I get for not paying attention,' she internally berated herself. Her first dinner at the Lefroy's and she was showing up looking like a beggar. Well, she corrected, not quite a beggar. But at least bedraggled, like she could care less for their opinion. Which was so far from the truth that it was comical. 'Oh irony', she thought to herself 'my friend, you are never far.' Jane spent most of the evening angling her body in such a way as to hide the offending hole in the lower portion of her skirt. It was not the most efficacious tactic but standing by the fire, as if cold, seemed to allow her to stay in one place. Therefore covered, however momentarily. \"I hear you're to go to town this winter, Miss. Lefroy?\" Jane asked Lucy politely in an attempt to make conversation. The girl had been staring at her most of the evening and the meal had not even been served yet. Jane knew it was not out of malice, more likely just a morbid curiosity. It must be hard for the young and romantic to look upon those who had been so failed in it. Jane reckoned she was Lucy's walking nightmare. \"Uh..yes we plan to stay on until new year.\" \"And are you looking forward to it? I imagine you will attend many balls and assemblies.\" That as all Jane needed to say to get the girl speaking freely. She listened on more or less for the better part of an hour. It was tedious but by far the lesser evil. While she had to endure endless chatter on bonnets and dances, the rest of her poor family were being regaled by the Smiths. She turned her attention back to Lucy again and gave her a winning smile. 'Oh yes', she thought, 'you are certainly preferable.' It had not been much longer when Mrs. Lefroy called the guests into the dining room. Jane held back hoping to be at the rear of the party to best conceal her dress. Sensing her dilemma, Cassandra walked up and stood close to her sister's side, concealing Jane's dress with her own. \"What were you and Miss Lefroy speaking of for all that time?\" \"Oh the usual. Shops and parties, the latest fashion, and beau of course. It is not often I have someone with which I can converse on such enthralling topics. I dare say my evening has already been made.\" Jane spoke in her most effected accent. \"I am happy for you sister.\" Cassandra replied with a mischievous glint in her eye. \"I do not believe we've had such a fine meal the whole season, have we not mother?\" Miss Smith spoke and gestured loudly in her praise to the lady of the house. Mrs. Lefroy nodded her acknowledgment of the compliment, but as one who knew the other lady well, kept silent. It was a good thing too because Miss Smith did not contain her raptures to the meal alone. Jane was seated comfortably between Cassandra and Mrs. Smith, who unlike her daughter, was absolutely silent this evening. The old women was also most likely deaf, which made her a most agreeable dinner companion in Jane's estimation. Her daughter though had continued on about everything on Gods good earth. Some points of her conversation were so ridiculous that not only did Jane share amused looks with her sister and father, but Mrs. Lefroy was even smirking at her in amusement. \"Generosity itself, was it not mother, for you to send your carriage to us Mr. Lefroy.\" \"Now, now. I don't want to hear any more on the subject. The generosity is all yours for agreeing to dine with us. It was only proper that we sent for you.\" Mr. Lefroy was everything gracious with his words but they were an obvious attempt to quiet the woman. Jane watched as his wife reached out and laid a hand on his forearm which seemed to settle him. Jane felt a pang in her chest. They were always small and hardly noticeable, but the intimate gestures between lovers had the most profound effect on her. The little things were what she grieved for the most about Tom. Would she be able to sooth him with a touch, or calm him with a look? Their separation seemed so long that she could hardly say anymore. The worst was that she feared she was losing the exact color of his eyes, or the shape of his lips when he smiled her special smile. Could she even recall the melodic tone of his voice? And just like that her thoughts seemed to somehow conjure his name into the air. \"- your nephew Thomas. I am sure he will be glad of your company for the season. Is he well?\" The conversation had veered towards the Lefroys plans to winter in London. Miss Smith had then remembered that their nephew resided there, and of course inquired after him. Completely unaware of what she had said, Miss Smith scanned the shocked faces of the others. Who's, incidentally, all seemed to be trained on Jane's face. For a long minute no one uttered a word. Still stung by hearing his name spoken aloud Jane stared wordlessly at her plate. She could not, would not, allow herself to appear so altered by the mention of his name. Taking a deep breath, she steeled herself against the pain and lifted her eyes to the party. She was expecting the stares of a room full of people who felt pity for her. What she found was surprising. Of course most were looking at her with a mixture of wary sympathy, but one gaze gave her unexpected strength. Mrs. Lefroy was looking at her with calm assurances written plainly on her face. There was no pity or nervous agitation in her eyes, and with all the dignity the situation called for, she answered. \"I believe my nephew is tolerably well.\" She said holding Jane's gaze. \"One thing I am looking forward to is the roads. It is always preferable to traverse snow covered roads when they are stone. None of that mucky business in London. I dare say last year we were snowed in at the Lodge for three straight weeks.\" And just like that the conversation was once again diverted, and once again, Jane could breath. As she lay in her bed that night images of Tom kept invading her mind. She had been so careful to distract herself from thinking of him when she was in his family's house. But once he had been spoken of the memories poured back in. Now as she lay here in the silent darkness she could not shake the images that plagues her. Most insidious were the images of his smirking at her in the library. Oh how he had baited her. He had stirred her mind and her heart that day. Infuriating her, yet at the same time entrapping her. At the memory of the words he spoke she felt herself flush red in the darkness. Huffing softly with frustration she rolled over determined to think on it no more. It was mid-morning, yet Mrs. Austen was the only one of the household awake, besides the servants. She did not begrudge them their lie in. It had been a late evening the night before and she planned to enjoy the solitude. It gave her the time to consider her daughters and what she would do. They had received a letter last week from Edward. His wife was expecting again and having a difficult time with it. He had requested either of his sisters company for his wife. The question was, who she would send, or if she should send both. Each one needed the change, something to pull them out of their self-imposed confinements. Mrs. Austen knew with certainty that no amount of time would alter the set of either daughter's heart, or mind. The questioned remained though of what was to be done. Poor Cassandra, her beautiful name sake daughter. There was nothing anyone could do to rectify the loss. The only solution she could offer for that daughter would be occupation. The more difficult of the two was always Jane. Would the solution for Cassandra work for Jane as well? Not that Jane needed anything else to occupy her time. The girl had been holed up in her room, writing away like a royal scribe. Mrs. Austen smiled to herself the same way she did when she first realized Jane was writing again. Ever since she was a little girl Jane had had ink stained fingers constantly. Of course, as her mother she had scolded and complained about the ink stains, but she was positively heartbroken when they were no longer there. The stains were back though. She was quite certain she knew why too. Of course those girls thought she knew nothing about the letters. How quickly daughters forget that their mothers were once in their shoes. Mrs. Austen was resigned to continue the charade. 'What will be, will be' she thought to herself. Hopefully that young man would come through yet. Taking a long drink of her tea she picked up the letter from Edward again. She would speak to the girls this afternoon. A trip to the coast would do them both good. Or so she hoped.[Chapter 13] Thirteen My Dear Mr. Lefroy, I feel I must address you in a more formal manner after receiving the contents of your last letter. A business man are you? Please, take my teasing in stride. I must admit I am exceedingly proud of you. I had no inclination that your news would be in any way what is was. I am relieved on more than one count. I have all manner of questions for you but do not know where to start. Mostly I would want to know that you are happy. Are you? Can you see yourself being satisfied with this endeavor? I would also like to inquire about the prospect of our future. Do not answer though, at least not yet. I anticipate yet fear the truth. You said soon and so I shall hold fast to your words. Things have been quite interesting for myself as well. Though not to the same degree. We dined this week at Lefroy lodge and had the added company of the Smiths. Do not you envy me? Though not for much longer I am sure. I heard that your aunt and uncle are to visit you when they adjourn to London for the winter. Your cousin, I believe, was in particular raptures to see you. The feeling is mutual no doubt for I know how you enjoyed her performance at the pianoforte. I dare say you shall all make a lovely party for the holidays. I am not jealous, well, maybe a little. I am off on my own journey though. Not as glamorous as Christmas in London but cheerful none the less. Cassandra and I are headed to the coast to visit my brother Edward and his wife. We heard from him not long ago that my sister in law is doing poorly and he requested our company. Mother said he desired us both, but I believe he desired Cassandra more, if only for her nursing ability. I am quite useless in that area I'm afraid. None the less I am going. I shall enjoy seeing my brother and a change of scenery will do me good. I plan on spending a good deal of time revising First Impressions. Which, if you are curious, is the title of the novel I have been working on. And, despite your previous teasing of my 'accomplished' abilities, I shall let you read it, eventually. My only concern with this scheme is that I fear we shall not be able to exchange letters for some time. It would be exceedingly difficult to keep them secret. A harsh reality, I know. Though as unfortunate as the truth is, it might be beneficial for both parties. You must concentrate on your work, and I on my story. If you could see me writing this now you would know by the sadness in my eyes that I am trying to be positive, yet failing. I do not wish to write to you of the harshness of my feelings. The longing and loneliness, I fear, you know just as well as I. Some days I wonder if I shall ever see your face again. Forgive my maudlin thoughts, I cannot seem to hold them back tonight. I wish you to know that I love and miss you. I pray you understand my reasoning behind the break in our contact, it is in no way preferable to myself. I shall always be waiting, never doubt. Cassandra and I are set to leave in two weeks' time, which should allow you to reply to this letter at least. We will be returning to Steventon sometime after New Year. May the time go quickly. Yours forever, - Jane[Chapter 14] Fourteen Dear Jane, Thank you for the considerate retelling of your evening at Lefroy lodge. Can you not relay information in your letters without teasing me? You are wrong, and you very well know it, in assuming that I will be happy for my cousins company. Not that I would ever be intentionally neglectful. No, I cannot lie to you. I will neglect her as often as I am able when my family is in town. Do not deny that you find her infatuation and my inherent revulsion at her attentions amusing. I shall endure though, and you shall be sorry to have missed the opportunity to laugh at me. So you are going to visit your brother then. And in doing so traveling even farther away from me. Your maudlin thoughts seem to have influenced my own. It appears we shall also have our only means of communication severed for some time. God... Jane, I do not know what to write. I feel myself utterly selfish and ignorant but, it is not enough. It is by far more than I deserve yet not enough. Not even close. My heart refuses to make way for my mind. A mind which understands that we cannot be together now, understands that I cannot see you, touch you. But Jane, you must know, it is killing me. Now the prospect of going weeks without your sweet words, scrawled across paper that was once touched by your hands, hurts. I am not even ashamed to tell you that I smell the parchment, believing incredulously that some part of your scent still lingers there. I have tried to keep the violent longing from invading my letters but it is becoming increasingly difficult. I dream of you, every night. Waking alone every morning, accursed, with nothing but your letters to smooth me. And now I shall be forced to live without those. Forgive me my melodramatic flair. It cannot be helped. I know you will read these words and think I have taken leave of my senses. Maybe I have. As freely as I gave away my heart, my mind seems impatient to run off and join it. I fear I shall be a broken hearted and senseless man until you are with me. To save me from myself. I am trying though. Everything I do at present is with our future in mind. I promised you soon, and soon it shall be. I have no time line at this moment to give validity to that claim, just an overwhelming need for it to be so. I shall do my best to move heaven and earth for you. Pleasantries are not within me at present to share but I do understand your request. It is more than reasonable and I acquiesce as graciously as a man in my position could be expected. Enjoy the time away. I say that most sincerely. I shall be waiting to hear word from you again. As always, I am yours heart and soul, -Tom[Chapter 15] Fifteen AN: Just a couple of things to note; 1. Edwards Wife was named Elizabeth but in my story she is going by Beth. 2. Edward was formally adopted by the Austen's cousins the Knights but I wasn't sure if his surname was Knight so I kept it Austen in the story. Jane allowed the rhythmic sway of the coach to lull her into a state a semi sleep. Not quite awake yet present enough that she could enjoy listening in on the other passenger's conversation. She didn't feel bad about it, not really. And they were quite humorous. Apparently Jane and Cassandra were in the presence of a very disgruntled mother whose son had severely disappointed all her hopes. The young man in question, and young only if thirty could be considered so, had refused to marry his cousin and thus was traveling home with a terribly angry mother. More than once Jane had to disguise a laugh as a yawn. The journey from Steventon to Edwards house at the coast was quite long, almost unbearably so. Yet, she consoled herself, at least there was sufficient entertainment. The countryside swiftly flew by and the sky darkened as they made way. Cassandra seemed to content herself with enjoying the scenery and once the other passengers had stopped being interesting, Jane pulled out her battered copy of The Monk. But the familiar text did not hold her attention for long. By and by she found herself imagining another girl, younger than her, setting out for a journey, for an adventure. She would have to write this down, it had the makings of a good story. They changed horses at the dinner hour and Jane and Cassandra enjoyed a surprisingly decent meal at the local tavern before they were off again. Now it was well into the night and Jane was the only passenger still awake. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on how you looked at it, the entertaining familial pairs journey had ended some time ago. They were replaced with a grieved looking old man who smelled vaguely of manure. His company was much less enjoyable as he snored rather loudly. Cassandra seemed to have found a solution in covering her bonnet and head with her wrap. Jane thought she looked rather silly, but she was sleeping peacefully so Jane would not laugh. The dark solitude was rather eerie and the only thing to be heard was the turning of the wheels and the pattering of horse hooves in the night. Oddly enough she felt rather safe. Cocooned somehow in anonymity. No one could touch her in this moment. She let her thoughts drift to her characters and she silently contemplated all the trouble they had been causing. No matter what she imagined she could not get the proud Mr. Darcy and the prejudiced Miss Bennet to cooperate. She loved them and all their complexities and would not change them for anything. First Impressions needed quite a lot of revisions though, not to mention an ending of some sort. Happy endings were always preferable. She felt like a curious magician molding and shaping things unseen. She wondered if this was how her father felt when writing his sermons. Searching for the right words to impart Gods guidance into the hearts of men. Jane did not fool herself into thinking her own writing was as lofty as that, yet, in her heart she knew with the certainty that a religious man must, that her words were important. Yet pride was a sin she easily feel into, which brought her thoughts full circle around to Mr. Darcy again. A subject she pondered until feel into an uncomfortable yet deep sleep. Jane and Cassandra woke in the early hours of morning and watched the sun slowly rise over the town in which they would spend the next several weeks, both looking forward to the comfort and diversion extended family could bring. The mornings in her brother's house were never quiet. It was not a great deal, yet, with the incessant bustling of her sister in law and nieces and nephews that ran wild; in those early mornings she missed her home severely. On one hand the busy enigmatic atmosphere of a growing family was a decent distraction from thinking of Tom, but it was also a distraction from her work. Jane had taken to working late into the night when all was finally still. Alas late nights did not always lead to late mornings. Jane found herself imbuing more than her customary amount of tea with her breakfast. It was these exact circumstances that brought Jane and Cassandra to their rooms on a particularly beautiful day. A day in which both would usually prefer to be out of doors. Both sisters were begging headaches in spite of the pleasant offerings of the outdoors and were presently hiding in their personal sanctuary of sisterly affection. \"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.' what do you think?\" Jane rolled her shoulders in an attempt to loosen the painful knots that had taken residence. She had spent too many hours in her chair instead of her bed and was feeling the effects. There was nothing to be done about it now. When the words came she dutifully gave herself over to the muse and paid the consequences without complaint. \"I've told you once already by your request, I like it.\" Cassandra was doing her level best to be a help to her sister. Jane had always used Cassie as an unofficial editor. Often reading whole chapters aloud so that he sister could give her opinion on the characters and wording. \"I fear it pretentious.\" \"It is not.\" \"Are you sure?\" Jane questioned again, the end of her pen firmly lodged between her lips in a typically indecisive gesture. \"I am sure.\" \"I know what you are thinking.\" She said while getting up and beginning to pace the room. \"But this is the most important line in the whole novel. First lines are elemental, Cassie, not to be underestimated. I have this feeling, this premonition almost. I must get this right.\" Cassandra could see that her sister's passion was palpable and she believed ever word. It gave her the inclination to address the one question she had about the story. \"I do have one thought though.\" \"Yes?\" Jane said, finally settling herself back onto the bed. \"I understand where you are going with the story, but truly Jane, must you make Mr. Darcy such an insufferable ass?\" The shocked look on Jane's face in response was enough to send Cassandra into a fit a laughter bringing her very amused sister with her. Neither was able to calm themselves for many long minutes. \"Oh Cassie, I do not think I have laughed like that in a long time.\" \"Nor I, but I was serious about your hero.\" Cassandra told her truthfully, all the while with an arm still wrapped around her waist from the laughter. \"I know you were. Yet, even your highly valued opinion shall not move me, or Mr. Darcy. There is a reason.\" \"A reason for his being proud and disagreeable?\" \"There is always a reason.\" Jane's suspicious smile made Cassandra wonder what exactly she was thinking but did not ask. \"Where are you going?\" Jane paused in the doorway at the question. \"Walking.\" \"You wish to be alone.\" It wasn't a question, not really. Cassandra could read Jane's face, she knew. Jane nodded in recognition. \"Do not stay out too long. I fear the weather harsh for a pleasure stroll.\" \"I will not be long Cassie. I need just enough fresh air to clear my mind.\" Of course she didn't qualify just how much time that would take. The long solitary walks along the wet sand were, by estimation, the best part of her visit. When she was alone it wasn't strange to spend an hour thinking up imaginary conversations between her and Tom. She would speculate on what he was doing at certain times and what his answer might be to certain questions she wished to ask. These moments were her escape in their little world of happiness. And no matter how long the days seemed to drag in their separation she knew that their world would not falter. As the weeks wore on the frost settled over the coastal home, and excursions to the outdoors were few. The days were short and mostly gloomy, settling as a fog into the household. The smells of holiday cooking lingered in every room and piqued in Jane a bitter sweet sadness. She missed him, in such a tangible way. The separation was painful, yet, there was a pleasure in missing him. Like he was hers to miss. These peculiar thoughts were the reason for her small odd smiles. \"What are you working on?\" Her sister in law asked one afternoon. Beth was not quite well, and took to her room most days now. Today though, she said she felt livelier. Jane could see the color in her cheeks. She was happy for her health. Even if it meant her sister in laws often tiresome conversation. \"I am copying the first few chapters of my novel to send home to my parents for Christmas.\" \"How lovely,\" she gushed. \"Your parents, no doubt, consider themselves very fortunate to have a writer in the family. I think it must be very nice indeed to always have some new entertainment that is exclusive to your particular circle of acquaintance. I do hope you will let us read it.\" Beth could always be counted on to praise whatever she had written. Whether it be striking prose, or a laundry list. Jane knew herself, and had to admit that she wasn't immune to flattery. So long as it was taken in small doses, and equally spaced, if not judiciously given. She might not be desirous of her critical opinion, but it was always nice to have your talents enjoyed. \"It really is not ready yet Beth.\" Jane was expecting to have to talk her way around that statement but was given a reprieve. For she seemed quite content to ignore the refusal and instead focused her attentions on the much greater slight that was plaguing her. Beth had heard it straight from Mrs. Forester that the Wharton's were to be traveling over the Holidays thus abandoning the previously agreed upon Christmas meal with the Austen's. A letter from the Wharton's was received the next day explaining the situation in great detail and causing Beth a fit of indignation that far surpassed anything Jane had even seen in her own mother. \"I still cannot abide it Jane. How the Wharton's could call themselves friends of ours and disappoint us so. Do they not know the respect that should at least be shown you, Edward's sisters, with a proper evening introduction?\" Jane sighed inwardly and gently placed her pen upon the table top; resigned to the task of placating her sister in law. It would not have felt like such a burden if she didn't need to spend the time working. Jane knew very well that she could send Tom nothing for Christmas, not matter how she wished to. Yet she believed that her dedication to her writing was a compliment to him as well. She so wanted him to be proud of her. Not just proud, but enraptured, enthralled, enchanted... With a swift shake of her head she interrupted her own wayward thoughts and turned her attention back to Beth. No wonder she found her own writing flouncy. Christmas morning dawned cold and overcast but Jane and Cassandra did not notice the weathers gloomy prediction. They sat close together on Cassie's bed, reading the latest letter from home that they had saved for three days in expectation for this very moment. Their mother's gentle and affectionate words soothed what little homesickness they did feel, and the mundane gossip was enough to raise their spirits after the dreadfully dull Christmas meal of last night. Cassandra pushed a few a Jane's wayward curls behind her ear and gave her a swift kiss on the cheek. \"Merry Christmas Jane.\" Her words holding all the gratitude and affection for the sister who had stuck by her over the trials both had so recently faced. Jane regarded her thoughtfully for a moment. She felt a hopefulness well up in her breast at the lightness in Cassandras eyes. It was something she feared quite gone. Yet despite hardship it was returning. A lazy smile slowly slide across her face. \"It's not completely terrible is it?\" Cassandra had no trouble following her humor and smiled in return. \"Not completely,\" she agreed. Breakfast was a rushed affair with the children squirming in their seats. Jane felt some of their excitement transfer to her even though she knew nothing she really desired would be gifted her today. How would you gift a person anyway? She stifled a very unladylike laugh at the imagining of her Tom wearing a bow upon his head. They quickly adjourned to the drawing room where the maidservant passed around nicely wrapped bundles. Fanny was resplendently happy with jewelry Edward had purchased for her and the children were busy chasing the tiny dog around the room. And didn't the poor creature look ridiculous in his bow and ribbons. Mr. and Mrs. Austen had thoughtfully sent Jane and Cassandra nothing more than a little extra for their expenses. The last package to be opened was from Henry and Eliza. Not surprisingly Jane and Cassandra both received a measure of silk from Eliza. And from Henry; books for Cassandra, and Jane received extra parchment and a very handsome set of new pens. Jane was so busy admiring them that she did not notice the letter that had fallen out of her new stack of paper. Her very inquisitive nephew missed nothing and swooped down upon the piece of paper and holding it aloft questioned loudly about what it was. Jane snatched it quickly out of his hand with a friendly smile. \"Well, it appears to be a letter.\" She drawled thinking it strange that Henry would have enclosed a sealed letter in her gift. All is clear though when she reads the address. Jane knows her face goes pale and her hand wavers ever so slightly. So many questions plague her. They had agreed not to exchange letters while she was not at home. How did his letter manage its way into Henry's package? Was there something wrong? She had little time to ponder her own questions though because presently every face in the room was looking at her expectantly. Whatever would she say?[Chapter 16] Sixteen \"Is Eliza sending you secret notes again?\" Casandra exclaimed. Jane looked up sharply in confusion, the letter clutched far too tightly in her hand. Cassie quickly stood and put her arm around Jane, grabbing the letter from her tight fist. \"She is,\" Cassie said loudly pretending to read the inscription on the paper. Jane still seemed utterly confused but by the looks on the rest of the family Cassandras lie seemed to be working. \"Cousin Eliza sends you secret letters Jane?\" Edward asked. Ignoring his wife's overly interested expression. Beth began craning her neck to try and get a better look at the letter that was now in Cassandra possession. Jane shook her head as if to clear a fog before giving her sister an imploring look. Jane willed her eyes to convey to Cassie her need to get out of this room and the present situation. \"You know Eliza,\" Cassandra prevaricated, \"always with the little intrigues. Most likely she just intends to complain about our dear Henry.\" \"Well that's the French for you,\" Beth cooed. Losing interest in the now not so mysterious letter. \"Thank you for the gifts everyone, but I think I'm going to lie down for a while. I'm suddenly over tired,\" Jane mumbled while rushing from the room. Cassandra stared after her wondering if Jane would need her company or if she was better left alone. Perhaps she should stay here and do her best to divert suspicion from Jane's odd behavior. But suddenly her worry was for naught. A loud wailing could be heard coming from behind the chaise lounge. \"Mother, the puppy's bitten me!\" Jane whipped the door to her bedchamber closed as fast as she could. Showing no care for the noise it made or the shelves it rattled. She had almost been obligated to relate the circumstances of her correspondence with Tom. She should be nervous, fearful even. Yet the only emotion she could feel was a desperate urgency to read that letter. Her mind was in a fit trying to ignore her worst imaginings as to why a letter from Tom was in her Christmas package from Henry. Had something terrible happened? She threw the letter down onto her bed and began to pace, willing her mind to calm. After a few minutes she felt sufficiently settled and sat down to read. Dearest Jane, I feel it is in my best interest to open this letter by asking you to endeavor to be less cross with me than I am sure you currently are. At this moment I can picture the little crease on your brow that you always get when I have said or done something to frustrate you. Considering that I have been doing just that the majority of our acquaintance, I should tell you that I am quite familiar with this expression of yours. And I am convinced this unexpected letter has more than frustrated you. Owning to my knowledge of your distaste in being left out of a scheme I will explain myself at once. I happened upon your brother quite unexpectedly on Oxford Street this morning. It would seem that the newlyweds are in town for the season. Which you must know, of course. I cannot say he greeted me warmly but I pressed my luck and begged an hour of his time. Henry was most gracious in allowing me to explain my abhorrent actions over the past year, though he did chastise me quite appropriately as any loving brother would. I hope that you will forgive me for taking your brother into my confidence without your leave. It was something I felt compelled to do. I must tell you Jane that something you said to me on the day our initial hopes were dashed has been weighing heavy on my conscience. When I told you that I depended entirely upon my uncle, you looked at me with complete confidence and said that you relied on me. Those words have haunted me all these months. I had foolishly thought I knew what the burden of responsibility felt like. I have sacrificed some momentary comfort to provide for my family. Yet when I looked into your beautifully sincere eyes, gazing at me with hope and confidence, I felt fear. Not just for the impossible monetary bind my uncle had placed me in, but a deep fear of my own inability to be the kind of man that one such as you should ever depend upon. How could I, imposter that I am, ever endeavor to deserve such a gift? But endeavor I have, Jane these past months have been a revelation. My duty is to my family, and will always be. Yet, I cannot be beholden, not to my Uncle or any other. The independence my new path has won me is something I never understood I needed until I had it. Now the only thing missing is you. Forgive me, my dearest I am rambling. And all I have written may seem far too forthcoming to be considered proper. Yet I find myself without any shame. You are my other half, the better part of my soul. And how can I truly know myself if you do not know me? This passion that is welling up in my chest has no other outlet but you. Your name is a litany that pulses through my veins and nothing but complete and utter intimacy with you will fulfill me, body and soul. Maybe I write this way because your brother has agreed to enclose this letter in his packages to you and your family, and have only a few short minutes to get it into his hands. Or perhaps I have finally taken leave of my senses after one to many beatings to my head. But, I remain your Tom, deficient in propriety as ever. At least you can never accuse me of inconsistency. Captain Austen is now informed of my intentions toward you and our plans to one day marry. I have also informed him of my circumstances, which though better than before, are still not what a marriage requires. Please do not worry, Henry will be discrete with his knowledge. I cannot guarantee he will not have a multitude of opinions to ply you with. But he is your brother and I leave the telling off to you my dear. Though he has graciously agreed to be a secure channel for us to continue to exchange letters. So please write to me. I wish to know how you are faring and every little detail you condescend to share with me. Happy Christmas my Love, Yours always, Tom As she refolded the letter and tucked it safely into her folio she could only think of how much she loved Thomas Lefroy.[Chapter 17] Seventeen He had expected to see shock. To be swiftly followed by anger, rage, and a thoroughly hyperbolic speech on the failing of his character. In the days leading up to the confrontation with the Judge, Tom had gone over each and every possible outcome. Hoping to be as prepared as possible. What he was wholly unprepared for was his uncle's silence. For the first few moments he was convinced that this was the proverbial calm before the storm. Yet as the minutes ticked away without so much as a sound from the old man, Tom began to sweat. He could feel the moisture on his back, making him want to squirm in his seat. Fidgeting was a sign of weakness, as his father had taught him, so he would ignore the sensation. \"You are determined,\" his uncle's voice broke the strained silence forcefully. \"I am.\" The judge stood, and Tom mirrored his action. Both staring at the other with a dining table and years of frustration between them. \"If you do this thing, if you chose to leave my protection and patronage then I will no longer support you. I will not favor you in your profession nor will I offer my experience or advice. From this day on you will be a stranger to me. And should this venture fail I shall not take you back into my home or my pocketbook. You will live or die entirely on your own ambition.\" \"I understand,\" Tom said quickly. \"All I ask is that you not oppose me, that you do nothing to purposefully hinder my success Uncle. No matter how I've angered you.\" His uncle looked incredulous. \"I have no reason to conspire to see you fail nephew; no doubt you can accomplish that entirely on your own.\" And with that the old man drained his wine glass and stalked from the room. Tom fell back into his chair with a dazed expression on his face. He had finally done it, he was free. Tom had never had much of a mind for numbers. He was a damn fine lawyer but Kensington was the one who ran their books and kept Tom appraised of their profits, or occasionally the lack there of. He rubbed his eyes fiercely as he tried to make sense of the piles of papers covering his desk. It was past midnight but he was determined to formulate a plan that he could stand behind. He needed to work out a rough estimate on when he could conceivably marry. So here he sat alone in his dimly lit office working the numbers, over and over again. How much would he need to set aside to continue helping his parents? Could he afford to engage a house in this part of London large enough to accommodate Jane as well as himself? What if they had children right away, how much would that cost? Feeling discouraged he picked up her letter to read it for the hundredth time since receiving it this morning. My dearest Tom, Despite your best efforts, I am cross with you. Quite cross actually. But I fear it is not for the reason you think. It is not because you made me look ridiculous in front of my family by surprising me with that letter, or for speaking so candidly to Henry. I am cross because your letter was too perfect, too inspiring, and dare I say titillating to be absorbed with the knowledge that I still do not know when I will get to see your face again. Words like that inspire me to physical demonstrations of my feelings, and I cannot touch you. So my love, I am cross with you for making me love you so fiercely. It is hardly fair. But I shall endeavor to forgive you. Life for me has been quiet these past weeks. Not so much in the sense of volume, for my nieces and nephews provide adequate audible stimulation, but quiet in spirit. My day to day activities have been simple and rewarding. First Impressions is coming along nicely. I am actually exceedingly proud of it. I sent a few chapters to my parents for Christmas but I've yet to hear their opinion. I am sure it will be much more complimentary than the work warrants, but such is the way with family. If Henry is obliging I might be persuaded to send you a copy through him. I admit I am quite desirous of your sincere opinion. And I know you would never flatter me undeservedly. You neglected to tell me how you enjoyed your holidays in your last letter. I was expecting a detailed retelling of every scintillating conversation you shared with your dear cousin. Did she play all your favorites on the pianoforte? You must tell me everything for laughing at you is one of my greatest pleasures. I must cut this letter short though. For I promised to help the children build a fort in the library while their father is out. You are welcome to imagine me crawling around under tables and laugh to your hearts content. All my love, Jane P.S. We must devise some scheme to meet each other in London on my trip home from the coast. I expect some ideas in your next letter. With renewed spirits he dove back into his planning. He could hardly wait for the day when he could spend every day and every night with that woman.[Chapter 18] Eighteen Jane My darling girl, You will hopefully be pleased to know that I have in fact been scheming. You could also call it planning but scheming sounds much more devious, does it not? I have been hard at work making plans for us my love. And not just for a clandestine meeting in London. Have I piqued your interest? Two years. Can you wait that long dearest Jane? If everything continues the way I hope, we could conceivably marry in two years' time. I know it is not exactly soon, but it is manageable. I have begun to tell myself that in a mere seven hundred and thirty odd days I can take you home with me and never let you leave. It also means at least a hundred more letters from your hand that I shall get to enjoy. Which is no small consolation in my opinion. I challenge you to find any two lovers who have ever know each other as well as we do after all these months of correspondence. There are particulars I would like to discuss with you about our future. Such as where you would like to live. But all of that should be covered in person, do not you think? I have spoken to your ever helpful brother and he has agreed to assist me in securing a day for us to spend together in London. Think of what you would like to do my love, because I shall be in a mood to give you the moon should you request it. Yours always, Tom[Chapter 19] Nineteen Jane's long time difficulties with sleep were intimately known to those of her family and the small household they kept. No one, servants or family alike, would be disturbed by the occasional bump and hum in the night at Steventon, common place as they were. Her brother's home was altogether a different story. The sumptuous bedclothes and smoldering fire did little to ease Jane into respite. Her agitation and excitement for tomorrow's journey left her even more restless than her usual state. She could think of nothing but Tom. Since wandering the halls and library were most assuredly out of the question she had fixed her mind on writing. Yet the clock had long since chimed midnight and her page was as empty and clean as it was many hours ago when she sat at the small side table. The pen in her hand hung limply over her raised knees as she drifted into a dream like state. How would he look to her after so long? She had morosely mulled over the possibility that she didn't truly remember his smile, or the way the corners of his eyes crinkled when she said something contrary, as she so often did to vex him. And if she felt this way, did Tom feel the same. Would he have forgotten details of her personage that he held dear? It was half past four when she resolutely lay herself down with strict instructions that she would not dwell on the unknowns. Soon enough none of her imagining would matter in the least. She would away to London in a few short hours and they would soon be together again. The fact that their time together was limited and not as of yet a permanent arrangement didn't deter the peaceful smile that spread across her tired face. Any few moments in his presence would be cherished, they would be enough for two years. The soft rap at the door did little to rouse Jane from the deep sleep her late hours had finally plunged her into. She was so lost to the conscious world that Cassandra had to shake her into rousing. The sight she was presented with when Jane realized it was morning caused her long suffering sister to stifle a guffaw. Jane shot out of bed like a cat dropped into a bucket. Hair and bedclothes flying, she dove for her case beside the bed, furiously searching for something through the dresses, hats, and underclothes. \"Jane,\" Cassandra exclaimed. Already dreading the work it would take to set her things back to rights. \"Whatever are you doing?\" As if startled to find herself with company Jane swung around, practically tripping over a discarded chemise. She stared at her sister for a moment with eyes wide and mouth agape. \"Where are my pens and paper?\" she asked returning to scramble through her nearly empty traveling case. Giving no thought to her sisters amused expression. \"Did you look on the table beside the fire?\" Cassandra asked with all sweet innocence, knowing full well she had not. As both the objects of her fervent search were sitting quite unmolested on the small round table where she had left them the night before. \"Of course,\" she began to gripe when the idea suddenly stole over her. She scrambled up from the floor and without so much as a thank you to her sister, threw herself into the chair and began to scribble something furiously onto her page. Having enough prior experience and knowledge of her sister's sometimes queer attitudes, Cassandra set herself to the task of collecting the victims of Janes fit with her traveling case. The underclothes and shawls were easy enough to fold and repack. But there was nothing to be done for the dresses that were now hopelessly creased. Poor Jane would have nothing suitable to change into upon their arrival in London. She would have to hope that the state of her attire didn't deteriorate too much upon the journey. Cassandra would make sure she was placed furthest inside the couch to avoid excess dust. After a period of time, once things were set to rights, Cassandra laid a gentle hand on Jane's shoulder. As expected, Jane jumped almost imperceptibly, but put the pen down and stretched out her arms. \"What was that about?\" Cassandra asked as she began to finger comb Jane's hair. \"That, my dear sister, was a pivotal scene for first impressions.\" Jane yawned and leaned her head back into her sister's capable hands. She was ever so tired and wished only to drift back into slumber. And she very well may have, lost as she was to the familiar sensations of someone dressing her hair. \"Your hair is utterly impossible this morning Jane. I do wish you would take more care. Especially when you know you have very good reason to want it looking presentable today.\" Cassandra pulled her hands back quickly as Jane whipped her head around, unsteady on her chair. \"Friday,' she began in a whisper. \"I'm not ready!\" She jumped up and behind the dressing curtain to begin her morning ablutions with haste. \"I've laid out your traveling dress and bonnet for you on the bed.\" \"You are too good to me Cass,\" Jane called from behind the screen. \"Of course I am,\" she replied heading for the door. The morning meal had been laid out especially earlier this morning in the front parlor for the ease of those traveling. They had a long day ahead of them, eight hours traveling by coach with a scant hour of refreshment when the horses needed to be changed. A good meal was important for their comfort. Or at least that was what Casandra had tried to convince her of. But Jane was determined that they should not chance missing their ride. After all it was she who had jeopardized their time table with her disordered morning. So she was happy to forgo eating to be on their way. She was in such high spirits that she felt no hunger, so it was no trouble to her in the moment. Yet now, hours away from their next stop, her stomach protested loudly; drawing the attention of her sister, who had until that point been engrossed in a book detailing the flora and fauna of Devonshire. A pastime Jane shared no affinity for and was quite indifferent to her sister's interest. Besides she was far too excited to find any pleasure in reading. Which for her was quite nearly sacrilegious. But Tom did have a way of making her troublesome, or more so than came naturally. \"You were right.\" \"About what?\" Cassandra asked without even looking up from her book. \"Breakfast of course. I should have eaten. Now I'm hungry as well as anxious. And did I mention tired? Because I'm that as well.\" \"Here,\" Cassandra said handing her an apple she magically pulled from somewhere about her person before going back to her book. Knowing she was dismissed, Jane decided her best course of action would be to close her eyes and hope that sleep would find her. Never one much taken by vanity, even she could admit that she hoped some rest would have a positive effect upon her complexion. Which was looking quite harried due to the deprivation of adequate sleep. Slouching quite unbecomingly she silently thanked her eldest brother's generosity for their private travel accommodations, closed her eyes, and fell asleep still holding her apple. Blessedly the journey passed with little to delay them. Jane was refreshed from her nap and positively bouncing in her seat with excitement as the lights of the greater city came into view. The journey slowed to what felt like a stop as they hit the outskirts of town. London traffic was well known to all, yet Jane felt it was quite a personal blow. Such was her anticipation. Another hour passed, in which Jane tried valiantly to convince Cassandra that walking would indeed get them their faster before they pulled up in front of the fashionable town home Henry and Eliza had taken for the season. Jane's attention was caught by the glow of the lamplights as she stood poised at the bottom of the steps. Somehow all the fates had conspired in her favor and she was here. Here in London, and soon with Tom. Suddenly it all felt like a dream, too good to be real, to be true. She was broken from her trance by her sister's gloved hand reaching for her. \"Come on you,\" she said. And pulling her along the sisters made their way into the house. For a moment they stood alone in an empty foyer while their cases were whisked away with no more than a nod in acknowledgement. Just then their delightfully disheveled brother turned the corner with a wide smile. \"Henry,\" Jane cried, rushing to embrace him with all the gameness of a younger sister. Jane inhaled deeply, relishing the familiar comfort of her brother's affection. \"Let me breath Jane,\" he laughed breathily. \"And let me get a look at the two of you.\" Henry chuffed her chin before bestowing a brotherly kiss upon Cassandra's cheek. \"So you've made it then,\" he started. He made a slow circle around them pretending to look very closely for what they did not know. Seeming to find their persons to his satisfaction he stood once again in front of them. \"And I see no worse for the wear. I was quite expecting to find one or rather both of you harried into old age and infirmity after so long with those devils.\" \"Devils!\" Jane and Cassandra asked in unison. Henry's face was serious and gave nothing away. \"The children of course,\" he scoffed. Earning a playful slap from Cassandra. \"They are angels and you love them just as well as we do.\" \"Of course I do, and should never say otherwise. Now let me show you to your rooms. My dear wife has happily informed me that there is not a moment to lose. Her dinner shall start at exactly half past eight and not a minute later.\" \"And just where is our dear cousin?\" Jane asked as they followed Henry up the grand staircase. \"Finishing touches, and that's all I will say on that score.\" The sisters gave him a suspicious look but all he did was smile. How very like Henry, Jane thought to herself. \"Here we are,\" Henry explained while throwing the door open. \"I know neither of you are opposed to sharing. And Eliza and I are just down the hall. If you need something just listen for the yapping. Pug is in a right state this evening, not found of company you see.\" \"Don't let you wife hear you,\" Jane called, already heading to unpack. \"I'm sure were just fine Henry. We will be with you both shortly.\" Cassandra almost had the door closed when they heard Henry call out. \"Hurry up Jane. You wouldn't want to keep our old friend waiting.\" Jane froze with the blue muslin in her hand, and deciding it was far to creased to wear anyway, chucked it at the door. \"Cassie, help me do something about this dress.\" Their scant hour, to Jane, seemed to at once drag and fly by. Cassandra was a miracle worker and had her descending the steps looking far more presentable than she did upon arrival. Though Jane was thankful, it did little to ease her nerves. Her heart was flying wildly in her chest and she gripped the banister with shaking fingers. This was it, she told herself. She would see him any moment. Had he arrived? Suddenly her excitement got the best of her and she rushed down the rest of the stairs in a very unladylike fashion. She went to call out to Cassandra to hurry up when she was distracted by raised voices coming from the side parlor. The doors were slightly ajar and she stepped closer, curios about the occupants and their apparent disagreement. \"I swear to you Kensington, the next time I lay eyes on that blaggard,\" She recognized the angry tone in her brother's voice and felt true concern for the gentleman he must have been addressing. Henry was such a genial fellow that whoever had offended him so must have erred egregiously. She was standing right outside the doors now and would certainly be discovered any moment. \"Please do not judge him so harshly,\" an unusual tall man pleaded with him. \"I don't know why he is not here himself tonight. All I know is that after some mysterious message he took his leave of me suddenly and begged my help in explaining his absence.\" \"Yet you have delivered no explanation, nothing I can bring to my sister to soften this blow.\" \"Henry,\" Jane looked to him as the import of his words began to coalesce in her mind. \"What is going on?\" She asked as an eerie calm began to settle over her. He hardly needed to answer, his very expression told her all she needed to know. Tom was not here. He wasn't coming. He had disappointed her again. \"Why?\" Is all that came to mind to ask. Her thoughts were swimming with the possible answers to that question. \"I don't know Jane.\" Henry had gone from angry to comforting in an instant. He took her hand gently though she felt little relief. \"Is he alright?\" \"I believe so.\" The tall man answered her. \"He received an urgent message, I believe from the Judge. He was agitated but otherwise fine. He sent me to make his apologies.\" \"I see.\" Her tone was curt and she looked at nothing but the floor beneath her feet. Feelings of grief welled up from within her and she felt as though she was back in the breakfast room of the LeFroy town home. How was it that she was thrown over again, after everything they had said to each other? What of the promises that were made? Loath as she was to think ill of him, this was a truth she could not deny. He had been once again faced with a choice. And once again it was not her. Determined to bear this disappointment gracefully she took her leave of the company. She ignored Eliza calling to her. Truthfully she had not even noticed her appearance. Even her sisters offer to accompany her was rebuffed. Jane intended to be alone for the tears that were sure to fall any moment. With quick steps she hurried back the way she had come only minutes before, this time with an altogether different reason for her haste. Once safely ensconced behind the closed bedroom door she allowed herself to feel. She sat down heavily upon the coverlet and allowed the tears to make silent tracks down her cheeks as she made a decision. This would be the last time she would cry over Tom LeFroy. Thus infused with a firm purpose she walked resolutely over to her case to retrieve paper and pen. She would write to him, one last time.[Chapter 20] Twenty[Chapter 21] Twenty-one My dearest Tom, I do not know how this letter will find you. I confess to hoping it finds you ill with grief over our missed opportunity. But I am afraid that is most likely far from the case. There are times I am sure no two souls have ever been so connected as we. And yet, I am once again left bereft of your presence. You have given no explanation for this and I find myself indifferent to any possible reason you could have. You asked me to wait Tom, and wait I did. I would have waited forever if you had requested. But to be thrown over, again, because of your circumstances is too much. I was afraid of just this predicament when you rekindled our acquaintance with your first letter. Our union was not meant to be, and yet I allowed you to convince me otherwise. It is clear now. And I am sorry my friend, but I cannot continue on like this any longer. Please do not write to me again. In any case I shall not receive your letters should you chose to ignore my request. Goodbye, Jane[Chapter 22] Twenty-two Mr. Austen, much like his daughter, enjoyed a bit of the ridiculous. People were an inexhaustible source of study and entertainment. His chosen profession in the clergy had afforded him with a lifetimes worth of study. Thus people had become very predictable to him. His life, though it had its share of difficulties, had become predictable as well. He prided himself on being such a man as to be unflappable. Yet as he entered his small library intent on a quiet hour of reflection, the sight that awaited him came as a shock. Mr. Austen was at rather a loss for words as he stared at the figure of the young man who had caused such an uproar in his family. What could he possibly be doing here? And who thought it was a good idea to let him in without a word? Mr. Austen's ire was up and it afforded him very little patience. Yet as he looked into the young man's face he saw only trepidation, and in spite of his own inclinations felt he must hear him out. Gathering himself together he gestured, with as much good nature as he could reasonably be expected to have, to the chair opposite his desk. \"You had better sit down then.\" Loath as he was to admit it, the young man's story touched him in a way he would not have expected. The bitterness of a father soon began to give way to keenly felt compassion. He had certainly erred, egregiously so, in many respects. But as Tom spoke of his upbringing in Limerick and the family he held so dear, Mr. Austen began to find forgiveness in his heart. Had he himself not brought about some degree of suffering to those he loved? Had he not chosen love time and again over practicality? He sympathized with the great burden a man may face when his heart and his duty are not aligned. And Tom had made something of himself. Even before this untimely death, which so enabled him to be here today. \"So you must see Sir,\" Tom continued quite unaware of the older man's growing sympathies for him. \"I felt that to go to her in London and neglect the uncertain fate of my Uncle would have been a disservice to both Jane and my family. At the time I had just a learned of his stroke and had to rush to his side.\" At this point Tom could no longer remain still. He began to pace the small library, growing more agitated by the minute. \"For two days and two nights my Uncle was teetering on the precipice. I felt it was my duty as his only family available to remain at his side, whatever we had thought of each other.\" \"And then with his death there was an endless list of things that must be set to rights. Not to mention my own affairs that could not be neglected.\" Taking great care to appear calmer than he was he made eye contact with Jane's father. \"I thought I was doing what was right,\" he confessed. \"I was wrong. And now I fear I have lost her forever just when I am finally able to...\" he broke off, slumping back into the chair. \"I have ruined everything.\" Tom's posture was all but defeated, with his head in his hands. \"I do not believe it is as bad as all that.\" Mr. Austen came out from around his desk and laid a fatherly hand on Toms shoulder. \"I don't claim to have any certain understanding of my daughter's heart. But I do know her character. She would never begrudge you an honest mistake if you only explained yourself to her.\" \"Thank you for your understanding,\" Tom said sincerely. \"When I received her letter I knew I had best make my apologies in person. I just pray she will give me the chance to explain.\" \"Of that I have no,\" Mr. Austen began but was interrupted by a soft rap at the door. \"Excuse me a minute Tom.\" Mr. Austen opened the door to Cassandra's nervous expression. \"I'm sorry for interrupting you, I didn't know you had company. But I'm worried about Jane. She went for a walk two hours ago and still hasn't returned and I fear it is far too cold for her be out so long.\" \"Where did she go?\" Tom asked before Mr. Austen had the chance to utter a word. Concern suddenly coursing through him. When Cassandra saw who her father's company was she was all astonishment. \"Mr. LeFroy!\" she exclaimed. \"Whatever are you doing here?\" Tom knew he should explain himself but did not know where to begin. He just needed to find Jane, especially if she was in distress. \"Let's not worry about that now,\" Mr. Austen interrupted. \"Cassandra dear, where did Jane run off to then?\" It was a great testament to her concern for her sister that Cassandra was able to put her shock aside and answer her father. \"I thought she was just going be taking a turn around the house. But I went to find her and she wasn't anywhere to be seen. I imagine she's taken one of her longer walks.\" \"In February?\" Tom was incredulous. At his tone Cassandra fixed him with such a look as to make him hold his tongue. He had obviously said the wrong thing. \"She has been distressed as of late.\" Try as she might Cassandra could not keep the censure out of her voice. How the man who had caused her sister so much heartache could be standing in their home she did not know. But her father was right, it didn't matter right now. \"We need to find her, and soon. I hate to cause any undue worry but I am concerned.\" Mr. Austen and Tom both felt Cassandras worry and compounded it with their own. \"Do you have any idea where she might have gone?\" Her father asked. \"She wanted to be alone. That much I am sure of. But which of her usual walks, I don't know.\" Mr. Austen turned to address Tom. \"I hope your wearing comfortable shoes, My daughter is quite the walker and we have our work cut out for us. I will head towards Overton and you can take the path through the wood.\" Having experienced heartbreak in summer and now in winter, Jane concluded that it was far superior to be thrown over when the weather was fine. The last few days had been particularly torturous. Mostly because the weather had confined her to the small rooms of the family home. Much as she had missed it, the familiar walls felt stifling to her now. She felt like she was suffocating and desperately needed fresh air. When she had awoken, it was with an unbridled desire to be out of doors. Weather be dammed. It had been her intention, as she had informed Cassandra, to take a few turns around the house and garden. Yet after she had taken a great many deep breaths of cold air the idea struck her. And once it had taken hold she could not help herself. Jane knew that going to that very spot in Selbourne was asking for trouble. It held so many memories. Memories so sweet, and yet, they would bring her great pain. Jane tried to scold herself for such masochism, but her heart was not in the reproach. She needed to do this, needed to say goodbye. The ritual would be her one last indulgence. She would savor the memories, allow herself to grieve, then put them away safely behind her. Jane knew that she could not continue to live her life in the fantasy of what may have been. That was for her characters, for her novels. As she rounded the bend in the trail so familiar to her she reached out with gloved hands to feel the sturdy strength of the trees. They who had witnessed her follies and yet would never speak a word of them. She would entrust them with her tears now as she had many times before as a child. Coming upon the very tree so well known to her she paused. Removing her gloves she laid her hands against its bark and dropped her head, allowing the memories of their last passionate embrace to flow over her. Feelings so strong, that at the time she was sure she would drown in them. He had always done that to her. How silly she had been in her original opinion of him. It was so clear now how he had inspired such a reaction in her. This was the kind of love she had always dreamed of. The kind of love that she would give to her heroines. She had lost that love but she would never regret it. Having never loved him was as unthinkable to her as not breathing. She slid slowly down to her knees before settling her back against the sturdy oak. It was terribly cold but she was determined to stay where she was until the overwhelming sadness had ebbed. How wretched she must look now, all alone in the woods, taking comfort from a tree. The image she knew she presented was just absurd enough to bring a smile to her face. When he saw her sitting quietly at the base of a tree he knew that his panic over her safety had been for naught. His Jane was many things, wonderful things, but a damsel in distress she was not. Yet his fear of her rejection was still a very real. So even though every fiber of his being was pulsing with the need to go to her he stopped. This was his third chance. It would also be his last, and how fitting that they had been brought together here. Each time he had met her in these woods before had been a great turning point in his life. Many their first chance meeting here had played through his mind. At times he was astonished at his own previous behavior. But she had enchanted him. Jane upon a walk was far and above any other lady at a fashionable London party. How she bated and beguiled him. Their second meeting here had been all the more momentous. He remembered well the need to be understood by the one he loved most in the world. And so he had come here to search her out. Wanting to assuage some small portion of the guilt, shame, and hopelessness he had felt. Of course he should have known that even a scant moment of time in her presence would overwhelm all his defenses. What were duty and honor when faced with the opportunity of the love of one such as her? Tom lost all sense when he looked into her eyes and he understood that now. So he tarried for a few minutes longer to gather his thoughts. If she could no longer love him he would have to find the wherewithal to walk away. Though Mr. Austen had given him some cause to hope and he must try. Slowly he stepped out of his concealment and took a few measured steps in her direction. Still she did not notice him so he decided to call out to her. \"I have heard there is much to see upon a walk,\" he began inching ever closer to where she sat. \"But so far all I have observed is the tendency to green above and brown below.\" At this he raised his eyes to her uncertain if his fate. \"Tom?\" She asked utterly confused by his sudden appearance and scrambled to her feet. Jane could hardly believe the sight before her. How could he materialize out of thin air just when she was telling herself to let go? There was no way to make sense of the scene unfolding around her so Jane did what she did best. \"I have come to say goodbye to you Mr. LeFroy. How magnanimous of you to make the trip out to this desolate country to oblige me.\" Tom felt each one of her words as a blow, and yet there was something unspoken. There was something in her eyes or maybe it was the slight upturning at the corner of her mouth. It was enough to draw him in a little closer. She had taken his bait and now they were sparing. \"As ever, your wish is my command Miss Austen,\" he answered in his most pleasing voice before sweeping a dramatic bow to her. Her delicate bowed lips pursed at his display and he stifled a laugh. He continued his steady measured steps until he was close enough to touch her. But he held himself back from reaching for her. She would have to come to him if this was going to conclude in his favor. So he fixed his face into his most bland expression and waited. Jane did not know whether to kiss him or slap him. She was infuriated with his nonchalance. How could he just stand there looking back at her like there was nothing so great between them? As the seconds ticked by locked in his gaze she began to struggle with her own disability to find the words. Jane believed there must be a perfect combination of words to reach him. He had to know what he had done to her, how he had hurt her. And yet all her gifts of eloquence had deserted her. \"I do not know what to say.\" Tom was baffled by her confession. He was sure that this had never happened to her before. \"Well I have more than enough to say for the both of us. But,\" he dropped off and bent down to retrieve her discarded gloves placing them carefully in a pocket. \"But what?\" Jane asked. Eager to understand some part of what was happening. He didn't answer her, at least not in words. Instead he reached out and took her hands in his frowning slightly upon the contact. Offended at sight of his expression she began to pull her hands back but he held them tighter. \"Your hands are cold,\" he said before bringing her left palm to his lips. His kiss was gentle and shockingly warm. It felt like snuffing out a candle. Before she could even catalog the sensation he was kissing the other, plunging her into the feelings all over again. Jane suddenly felt like she had imbued far too much wine and was leaning ever so much closer to him until their foreheads touched. Neither wanted to break the spell of the moment for many long minutes. After a time Tom knew it was up to him to bring her clarity. She knew nothing of how or even why he was here with her. Deciding her hands were finally warmer he let them go in favor of cradling her face. \"Can you ever forgive me Jane?\" He whispered knowing she would hear all he meant her to. \"I have forgiven you a great many things already Thomas LeFroy. But if you are here because you once again have changed your mind and wish to elope my answer will be no.\" Tom couldn't help but smile when that eyebrow that he loved so much inched its way up her brow. \"I have so much that I need you to know, to understand Jane. But most important of all is that I had no intention of not meeting you in London.\" At his mention of it her posture changed and her shoulders stiffened. He had no notion of losing her so he stroked his hands gradually down her neck, lingering on her shoulders before wrapping around her arms. \"Jane my uncle has died. The night of our intended dinner I was called away from my office with an urgent message that my uncle had suffered a stroke. My presence was of course required.\" \"Why,\" she began but stopped herself and began to pull out of his embrace. \"Why didn't you say anything? A letter or a message. Why did you let me go on like this?\" The spell had been broken and she took several steps back from him. Tom felt each inch like a knife to his gut. He knew nothing but that he couldn't let her retreat from him, not completely. \"I was wrong, so wrong Jane. My own fears kept me from reaching out to you until things had been settled.\" Tom could tell by her expression that she did not find his explanations sufficient. \"Common courtesy Tom; you could have sent a note explaining your absence.\" \"You are completely right, but instead I chose to keep my own erroneous council.\" \"It was a horrible decision then. Do you comprehend the situation you forced upon me? Do you have any idea what I thought, what I felt?\" Each ounce of anger and despair was seeping from her as she squared off against him. Her hands ached from clenching her fists so tight and her face felt hot. \"I cannot do his anymore Tom. It is too much to ask of me. I cannot be dragged here and there by your ever changing circumstances.\" Her anguish broke his heart and he desired nothing so much as the ability to mitigate that pain. But there was nothing he could do other than tell her how he felt. To tell her what he was most troubled to admit to another. \"I was happy Jane, happy. Can you believe that? My uncle was on his death bed and my only thoughts were of the freedom his passing would afford me. His death meant the life I had been dreaming of. It is all I thought about and I was ashamed of myself for it.\" Jane's righteous angry fled then as swiftly as it had come. For the first time it was she who reached out. Taking his hand into hers once more. She looked up into his face and urged him to unburden himself. \"What are you trying to say Tom?\" And so she listened patiently as he told her all. Not just the story of the past weeks but months of his actions were laid out for her. She had thought she knew, thought she understood him. Yet he was far more than she had known. The things he had done both noble and not were part of him. And as much as she had previously believed she had accepted his past, it wasn't until now, when she saw what he had made of himself, that she was truly able to accept him. \"I wish you would not judge yourself so harshly. For my sake at least.\" Her brought her closer and kissed her forehead before letting her go and taking a step back. \"I had this idea, Jane.\" He squared himself in a way she had seen him do many times before, almost as if he was setting himself to some herculean task. \"Once it became clear that my uncle would not recover, that I would be inheriting far sooner than he or I ever expected, I imagined this grand reunion. I would have everything settled, my uncle's affairs and then my own. I would come to your home, ask to speak with your father, then when I had his blessing I would ask you.\" \"Ask me what?\" The words slipped out before she could even attempt to hold them back. \"What I wish I had been able to from the beginning.\" He stood in front of her now, closer than before. She could feel the heat coming off of his body. Or maybe it was just hers, she didn't know. \"Miss Austen I have to tell you that I have come to love you, most ardently.

","Summary":" Introduction Have you ever wondered what would have become of Jane Austen and her writing if she ha"},{"Movie":"Hidalgo","Title":"Worlds of Sun and Shadows THE SEQUEL!","Author":"Island Breeze","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2075476","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Concealednin shadows cast by the mid-day sun, the gentleman observed thentouching scene along the ship's railing, the close embrace, and thentender exchange of kisses between the cowboy and the daughter ofnSheik bin Riyadh. The Englishman smiled to himself, so she was onnboard the ship. He had not seen her for parts of two days and hadnbegun to wonder if she had embarked in Liverpool. Careful to remainnunnoticed, the man shielded his face by spreading open a newspapernthat had been tucked under his arm, all the while keeping an eye onnthe couple. As he feigned interest in one of the columns, he pridednhimself on his patience. It was his patience that enabled him tonunobtrusively tag Frank Hopkins the last two days. He hadnperiodically followed the cowboy around the ship without arousing hisnsuspicion. He had even spoken briefly with Mr. Hopkins, politenconversation about the sailing, the weather, and he had purposefullynrefrained from asking Mr. Hopkins if he was traveling alone. Thengentleman glanced up over the top edge of the paper. The couple wasnsmiling and talking with one another. Yes, just be patient, he toldnhimself, this was by no means the last day of the voyage, and if henwas careful, if he timed it properly, he would find an opportunity tonspeak with bin Riyadh's beautiful daughter, without frighteningnher. No, he must not scare her; persuade her, entice her, yes. Hennoticed how Mr. Hopkins eyes were locked onto hers. He would have tonseduce her in such a way, that his offer would be more appealing thannthe promise shining in Mr. Hopkins eyes. He glanced over the cornernof the newspaper again. Mr. Hopkins was taking her by the handnmoving from the railing to walk in the opposite direction along thendeck. The Englishman's eyes targeted the rough rider who wasntalking and smiling at the young woman as he led her away. Patience,nhe reminded himself, he would have his time to speak with her, andnwhen he did, the cowboy would not be present.[Chapter 2] Innher cabin, the soft glow from the lamp made the golden embroideryntwinkle and sparkle on Jazira's damask robe, overlaying her thinnlinen dress. Tonight, her hair had a brilliant sheen, her skin anradiant luster. As she briefly glimpsed her reflection in the mirrornshe was not impressed with her appearance, but her dark eyes danced. nFrank had determined, with her acceptance, to speak with the ship'sncaptain after dinner, about marrying them on route to America. nJazira thought about her father and sadness touched the corners ofnher mouth momentarily. Then she smiled, this was a special evening. nShe searched for and found her reticule, stowed under the bed, andnpressed her fingers along the lining. When she located the hard lumpnhidden inside she gingerly tore open the seam and nimbly untied thenknot that held the object in place. When her hands were free of thenbag, she stood up and held the large gold signet ring in her hands. nThe gleaming gold took on a life of it's own in the light. Jaziranreflected--this was the first time she had removed her father'snring from it's hiding place since she had left Arabia over twonyears ago. She slipped the heavy ring over her thumb, and regrettingnher slender hands, she deftly tied it on with a bit of cloth. Jaziranheld her hand up for observation, and was infused with a warmth andnaffection for her father. As her thoughts turned to Frank once more,nher cheeks flushed and she was suddenly anxious to see him. Jaziranleft her cabin to find Frank's and upon reaching it, confidentlynknocked on the door. There was no answer. She knocked again, stillnno answer. Bewildered, she looked around the ship's decks but didnnot see him. It occurred to her that he must naturally be in thencargo hold, checking on his mustang. She smiled with assurance andnheaded below deck, totally unaware of the heads that turned as theyncaught sight of her exotic beauty. Afterndescending several flights of steps, Jazira came into the well litncargo hold, and the stalls where the horses were kept. At the momentnit appeared that they were unattended, and that she was the onlynperson down there. She walked over to Storyteller, who approachednher and nickered. Jazira stood on the bottom ledge of the stall fornadditional height and leaned over to rub the mare between the ears,nasking gently, \"Where'snyour master? Do you know where he has gone off to? Did he tell younwhere he was going? Did he?\" Thenlarge horse, in the stall next to the mustang, whinnied fornattention, and Jazira looked over at the Arabian stallion with ansmile. The stallion tossed his head, and as he did so, Jazira'snsmile disappeared, alarm registered in her eyes. There was somethingnfamiliar about this stallion, in his eyes, and the marking underneathnhis right eye, the patch at the far corner of his mouth. Thenfeatures would be hardly discernible to anyone not familiar withnthose peculiar trademarks, to someone who had not seen them before,nto someone who had not been taught the importance of those markings. nJazira's heart was pounding rapidly. She quickly stepped from thenledge of the mustang's stall and scrambled over to the stallion,nimmediately stepping up along that ledge for a better look. Wasnthere a mark along the belly by the right foreleg? Now, the light innthe cargo hold was not bright enough, the stallion was standing toonclose to her, and then the voice interrupted, \"Excusenme, young lady, may I help you in some way?\" Thenrefined British accent caused Jazira to look up too sharply and losenher balance. She teetered and landed on the floor awkwardly to hernembarrassment. The handsome Englishman came to her and gripped hernelbow as if to steady her and replied, \"Indidn't mean to startle you. Are you all right?\" Jazirancouldn't stop the guilty look that betrayed her feelings as shenanswered, \"Yes, thank you.\" ThenEnglishman smiled at her downcast eyes, her distracted manner andnsaid, \"That's fine. Has my stallion been bothering your horse?\" Jaziranlooked up at the friendly face, whose trim dark brown hair was justnslightly graying along the edges while the mustache remained dark. nShe gained more self possession and answered, \"No,nhe just wanted some attention.\" ThenEnglishman quipped, \"Well, I'll have to learn his secret if itngains him the attention of so lovely a young woman as yourself.\" Hennoticed Jazira's eyes fell away from his, and careful not to makenher uncomfortable, he stepped around her and went to the stallionnwithout saying anything else. Patience, he told himself. He hadnnoticed the signet ring she was wearing tonight. He could use that,nif she didn't turn around and ask, \"MaynI ask, your stallion is so striking, so remarkable to see in thisnpart of the world, where did you find him?\" ThenEnglishman turned from the stallion to face Jazira and repliedngently, \"I think the daughter of Sheik bin Riyadh knows thenanswer.\"[Chapter 3] Asnhe closely watched the young woman's face, the Englishman knew hisntactic, of placing his stallion in the stall next to Mr. Hopkinsnmare, had worked. She had been startled seeing that equine relic ofnher past. So much so, he knew that instead of fearing him, shenwanted him to explain the connection. Now her dark eyes gazed at himnin astonishment as she asked, \"How.n. .how do you know me?\" Henstood directly in front of her and answered honestly, \"I don'tnknow you, not really. My name is Theodore Lawrence. I saw your namenon the ship's passenger list, Jazira bin Riyadh. And then. . .\"nhe reached out for her right hand and indicated the large ring on hernthumb, \"I recognized the ring, it's your father's.\" Mr.nLawrence gently shook Jazira's hand as he added, \"I did know him,nSheik bin Riyadh.\" Hencould see the questions in her eyes, but she simply asked withnsadness fringing her voice, \"How is it that you knew my father?\" Mr.nLawrence waited until she looked into his eyes, then answered with anquestion of his own, \"Let me ask you, how did you recognize mynArabian?\" Jaziranlooked from Mr. Lawrence to the stallion, a copy of which she hadnseen drawn in detail in her family's breeding book. She replied,n\"He is the son of Al-Altair.\" She looked back at Mr. Lawrencenwho was waiting expectantly for what she might reveal, but she onlynadded, \"One of the sons of Al-Altair.\" Mr.nLawrence said with pride, \"Al-Altair, a stallion never defeated innthe Great Race.\" Hentore his eyes away from Jazira and looked back at the stallionnexplaining, \"He was a gift from your father.\" But he glanced atnher once more saying, \"I was sorry to hear of his death.\" Hensaw the troubled expression in Jazira's downcast eyes and said,n\"You are not aware of it, for you have no reason to be aware of it,nbut I am Britain's Minister of Foreign Affairs. Your father isnwell known in my circle.\" He paused then continued, \"But I metnyour father long ago, before I held any public office. In fact I wasnthe youngest officer placed at an Arab outpost, along thenHadhramaut.\" He looked at Jazira who was peeping at him from thenthick veil of her eyelashes, and asked, \"Do you know the story?\" nHowever, before she could reply he related, \"It was the dry season,nthe British, we, were protecting the wells and cisterns already innexistence, and me and my men were digging a new well after findingnevidence of an underground spring, I was overseeing the work. Yournfather was camping nearby. He was a most hospitable man, and evennthough his water supply was low for him and his family, his house,nlet alone his stock, he shared what he had with us. But it tooknlonger than any of us expected before we tapped into the spring. Onennight, as often happens, there was a razzia, a sudden raid, on hisncamp. I had seen the raiders coming, they were not from any localntribe that I knew. I gathered my men and we went to fight alongsidenyour father and brothers. I believe one of his sons was killed thatnnight. Somehow his mother found out and she came outside her tent,nright into the middle of the battle. I'll never forget that sight,nshe was pregnant. I was afraid she would be killed and I went tonher, shielded her, protected her, until she was safely back insidenthe tent. The next day, when my men went back to digging the well,nwe found water. Your father was so grateful for our help, fornprotecting his unborn child, his son, and for the water, that he gavenme a colt from Al-Altair.\" Thenstory concluded, Mr. Lawrence was disturbed to find tears shimmeringnin Jazira's eyes. But, she knew what Mr. Lawrence did not. Shenhad been that unborn child, and she had just learned that her fathernhad sacrificed what was sacred to him, for her, even before she wasnborn.[Chapter 4] Franknlooked at the brass clock on the wall of the Captain's office. Henhad been conversing with the Captain for forty-five minutes and henknew Jazira would be looking for him. At one point during thenconversation, he boldly stood up suggesting he needed to find hisntraveling companion and he did not want her to wonder where he was,nbut the Captain simply waved the problem away and called one of thenpursers into the office ordering the young man to find Mr. Hopkinsn\"companion\" and to tell her his whereabouts. Frank frowned, butnout of respect and because of the Captain's congeniality henresigned himself to this arrangement. However, Frank had little hopenof the purser's carrying out the Captain's order as he saw himnwalk in the opposite direction to assist a young woman and her smallnchild. Franknconsidered that either the Captain had an insatiable curiosity or henwas purposefully trying to stall him for some reason. The questionsnseemed endless, putting Frank's nerves on edge. Adding to that, hencouldn't suppress the tiny suspicion that had burrowed in his mindnas the interview drug on, to his obvious displeasure. Frank feltnthat something had fallen out of rhythm, this lengthy conversationndidn't make sense. Anxious to get out of the office that seemed tonsuffocate him, Frank interrupted the Captain as he abruptly stood upnsaying, \"I'mnsorry sir, but I've really got to be going. It's just not politento keep a lady waiting.\" ThenCaptain's last word evaporated in the warm air of their closenquarters, and some of the friendliness in his smile disappeared asnwell. He stood up and politely put out his hand to the cowboy. Hisncompliment sounded more like a complaint as he said, \"Andnyou have such an exquisite traveling companion, Mr. Hopkins. She hasndrawn much attention from our passengers, this voyage.\" Franknleveled a hard look at the Captain. There was something darknunderlying his remark. As he shook the Captain's hand, he tried tondraw him out by saying, \"Inhope to make her my wife during this trip.\" ThenCaptain replied slowly, \"I see. . .and you would like me to marrynyou? . . .Naturally, I'll have to hear what the young womannthinks, before I give you an answer.\" Franknwas aware of that feeling once more, like he was being forestalled. nHe looked the Captain in the eye and said, \"We'll try to find younafter dinner this evening. Then she can speak with you, herself.\" ThenCaptain looked away from Frank and cleared his throat saying, \"Yes,nwell, I will be dining with an important British officer thisnevening. We will be talking at some length, I assure you.\" Frank'snjaw hardened, \"Well, we'll just find you later then.\" ThenCaptain's reply was cagey, \"Perhaps you will. Good evening, Mr.nHopkins. I don't want to detain you from meeting your attractivencompanion any longer.\" Franknsquinted in disdain as he turned to leave saying, \"Good evening,nsir.\" AsnFrank shut the door behind him, the Captain turned and looked at thenclock on the wall. Franknfelt the immediate relief of the refreshing ocean breeze as henquickly walked along the deck, his boots echoing against thenhardwood. He only glimpsed the stunning sunset a moment, hoping tonfind Jazira and share it with her, before it faded into the night. nHe went down several flights of steps until he reached the corridornwhere Jazira's cabin was located. He knocked on Room 327, butnthere was no answer. He called out her name through the barrier ofnthe door, but all was quiet. Perhaps she had already gone up to seenthe sunset, but after thoroughly searching the decks he looked in thenlibrary and the parlor, before deciding she might be in the cargonhold with the horses. The blazing colors had already faded from thensky as Frank rounded a corner to reach the steps, and saw the youngnlivery man, who was supposed to be in charge of the horses, flirtingnwith a lady's maid. A scene that would normally have been amusingnto Frank, now irritated him. He descended the steps into the wellnlit cargo hold, the faint sound of voices meeting him first. As hencleared the bulkhead, he saw Jazira, her back was to him. Standingnvery close to her was a handsome, well dressed gentleman, holding hernright hand in his saying devoutly, \".n. .you can see why, I feel. . .that meeting you. . .on board thisnship, was no mere accident.\" Franknfroze.[Chapter 5] Mr.nLawrence broke his intense gaze into Jazira's eyes and looked upnover her head to see Frank Hopkins standing tall and erect on thenlast step into the cargo hold. The cowboy's position wasndefensive, his shoulders squared, his right hand clinched into anfist, the eyes dark and foreboding under the brim of his Stetson. nMr. Lawrence looked back down at Jazira, her face revealing she wasnstill absorbed in what they had just finished discussing. Henreleased her hand, and smoothly reached inside his jacket taking outnhis pocket watch. He looked at the time and with complete gallantrynsaid, \"Inapologize for keeping you so long, it appears you have a previousnengagement, which I seem to have interrupted.\" Stillndistracted, Jazira followed Mr. Lawrence's glance and as she turnednaround and saw Frank, she came back to reality. Frank tried to forcena smile, and make his fist open up as she turned to look at him. Hentried to crush the question that kept repeating itself over and overnin his head, 'What's going on here?' WhennJazira's eyes met his, her face broke into a happy smile thatnreached into her eyes. It was beautiful enough to pull Frank downnfrom that last step, with a cautious smile of his own. Mr.nLawrence stole a quick glimpse of the two of them and said just asnquickly, \"I'll say good evening then.\" Jazirandidn't see the gracious dip of his head as he stepped by, her eyesnwere on Frank as he approached them, his blue eyes fastened on tonhers. Mr. Lawrence said dartingly, \"Good evening, sir.\" He attemptednto proceed towards the steps, but Frank arrested him by steppingnpartially in his way and saying with deliberate politeness whilenextending his hand, \"I'mnsorry, I don't believe I know you.\" Mr.nLawrence reminded himself that Jazira was observing him, and thoughnhis eyes challenged Frank's, his voice was friendly as he shooknFrank's hand replying, \"No, you're quite right. I met you onenday up on deck, however that does not qualify as an acquaintance doesnit? My name is Theodore Lawrence.\" Franknquickly tracked his memory and recalled a brief, ordinarynconversation with the man. He also recalled feeling like thenEnglishman had been following him, but had attributed the sensationnto his concern for Jazira at the time. Mr. Lawrence noted the doubtnand suspicion in Frank's eyes as he said with gravity meant tonleave an impression, \"Frank Hopkins.\" Mr.nLawrence tilted his head to the side saying, \"A pleasure, Mr.nHopkins.\" He couldn't resist a daring look at Jazira who wasnwarily watching them both. He held the look a meaningful momentnlonger as he said, \"Madam.\" Hentook the liberty of giving Mr. Hopkins a dubious smile and thennexited up the steps. Frank'snhead turned partially over his shoulder, his jaw was clinched and henstared into Mr. Lawrence's vacant spot for a second, collecting hisnthoughts. When he looked up he saw Jazira also deep in thought. Herndark eyes were troubled, her left arm tightly encircling her waistnand supporting her right arm, the slender hand plucking at her bottomnlip in consternation. Studying her demeanor, Frank walked over tonher. Suddenly she seemed very vulnerable. He placed his hands onnher upper arms, and when she didn't look at him, he felt hisnadrenaline kick in, and his heart beat faster. A surge of protectivenpower swept throughout his being, but it was not to be released, notnyet. Henasked firmly, \"Are you okay? What's happened?\" Hisnblue eyes were rock solid and waiting for her when she looked up atnhim. So much flashed so rapidly across the sable darkness of herneyes, Frank could not absorb it all. Jazira felt his strength, hisndesire to understand, and it sent panic through her. She impetuouslynthrew herself into his arms, against his chest, wrapping her armsnaround him, clinging desperately to him as she said fervently, \"Frank,nI love you! I love you so much!\" Franknheld her so tightly, Jazira's toes barely touched the floor. Yet,nas closely as he wrapped himself around her, his instincts told himnhe was about to lose her. He didn't know how, or why, or to what. nFear sliced through his heart with deliberate precision and pain. Henreached up and put his hands on either side of Jazira's head andngently pulled her back. His look lingered on her full lips for ansecond, and then he leaned down. He hoped the intense kiss wouldnhold back the growing fear inside of him, hold off that shadownlurking in their future. At first, the power behind the kiss scarednJazira, but momentarily she returned his kiss fully. So why did henfeel as if he were losing her?[Chapter 6] Thendazzling dining room titillated with the sound of pleasant, lightnvoices and the clink of silverware on china. Frank and Jazira stoodnuncomfortably on the threshold, waiting for the attendant to directnthem to a table. They were quite a spectacle as they waited, thencowboy with his deep tan and rugged good looks, the foreign womannwith her dark beauty and exotic dress. The volume of conversation,ngenerated within the room, dropped a decibel into dramatic whispersnand exclamations. In an exclusive and distant corner of the diningnroom, the Captain interrupted Mr. Lawrence and pointed in thendirection of the young couple. Mr. Lawrence dropped his train ofnthought and focused his attention on Frank and Jazira. He studiednthe young woman in particular. Her head was turned away from Mr.nHopkins, and she looked unhappy. Mr. Lawrence's eyes narrowed, henglanced at Mr. Hopkins whose eyes scanned the room for the absentnattendant. The cowboy placed a hand on Jazira's back and it seemednto startle her. When she looked up at him, he nodded in thendirection of the approaching host. Franknfelt Jazira jump when he touched her and went cold inside. As soonnas they had separated from one another in the cargo hold he hadnsubtly felt Jazira withdrawing from him. Thenattendant reached them with large menus in hand, and a broad smile onnhis face. This unusual, but attractive couple put him in thenspotlight, \"Antable for two, sir?\" Franknreplied, \"Yes.\" Thenhost turned his smile on the lovely young woman whose beauty was onlynheightened by the sadness in her eyes. He extended a gloved hand innthe direction of the full room saying eagerly, \"Thisnway please.\" Franknplaced his hand on Jazira's back once more, indicating for her tonstep in front of him. As she did, Frank looked around the room, atnthe eyes trained on them, and considered that perhaps Jazira was justnnervous. He was about to look ahead at the table the attendant hadnchosen for them, when something out of the corner of his eye grabbednhis attention. He looked back in that direction, across the numerousntables, the many faces, until he saw him, the man who had been in thencargo hold with Jazira, Mr. Lawrence. And who was sitting with him? nNo one other than the Captain. Frank felt his back arch, his bloodnblaze and across that distance his eyes branded the two men as his tonbe dealt with later. ThenCaptain felt the sting of that look and cleared his throat, glancingnat Mr. Lawrence for support, but Mr. Lawrence appeared to be onlynamused. \"Herenyou are sir,\" the attendant pulled the chair out a little farthernhoping to get Frank's attention. He succeeded and Frank seatednhimself. After being handed menus, Jazira disappeared behind hers. nFrank chose not to look at his, keeping his hands clasped over it, henlooked across the room once more for the two men in the corner. nHowever, seated he was unable to see them. Frank bit his upper lipnand looked back at Jazira and waited. There was a sudden stir amongnthe other diners but it did not distract Frank. He felt like anneternity passed in the silence between the two of them, and finallynhe broke it saying gravely, \"Jazira.n. .\" Shenput the menu down and looked him resolutely in the eye sayingnsympathetically, \"I know, you want to know what happened with Mr.nLawrence.\" Franknbreathed relief, his eyes appealing to hers with his need to know. nHe gave a single, dramatic nod and said earnestly, \"Yes.\" Jaziranbegan to speak when a waiter asked for their selections. He thennspoke at length about Madame de la Roche who was about to sing anfamous operatic piece. Frank felt his frustration reach boilingntemperature and curtly sent the uniform away with their orders. Henturned back to Jazira, the menus now gone with the retreating waiter.n She took one look at the fully charged expression on Frank's facenand laughed. She tried to smother it by placing a hand over hernmouth, but the sound rippled beyond and away from her. It wasntotally unexpected and surprised Frank whose eyebrows shot up, but itnwas a wonderful sound after all that tension, and soon Jazira had himngrinning, and even chuckling. Couples nearby looked over at them tonsee what was so amusing. After a moment, Jazira's laughternsubsided and though she still smiled across the table at Frank, thensomberness returned to her eyes. Frank reached across the table andntook her hand. Jazira breathed deeply then began in a soft voicenwhich Frank leaned forward in order to catch every word. She said, \"Indo not want to lose this. . .not any of it.\" Franknasked quietly, but with firmness, \"Why, why do you think you'rengoing to lose this, do you mean me?\" Hisnthumb made a gentle stoke across the back of her hand. Jazira lookednat their entwined hands and then back into Frank's eyes, answering,n\"Yes.\" Innthe brief pause, an announcement was being made in the background,nthey both ignored it. Jazira continued, \"There is something I havento do, and I know you will hate me for it.\" Frankngave her an incredulous look, and challenged her, \"Hate you? Howncould I ever hate you?\" Thensound of light applause filled the room even as Jazira said, \"BecausenI'm going back to Arabia.\" Jaziranfelt Frank release her hand. She saw the impact of her words on hisnface, in his stunned expression. The force of what she said made himnsit back in his seat, speechless. Jazira's eyes filled with tears. Innthe background Madame de la Roche began to sing.[Chapter 7] The passengers in the dining room were absorbed in the aria, the rich soprano voice filling the respectful silence. Jazira looked at her empty hand which Frank had just released and willed away the tears in her eyes. She swallowed and summoned her courage as Frank stared at the edge of the table in disbelief. Jazira leaned forward, the candle light flickering across her distraught face. There was a pleading note in her voice as she said, \"Frank. . .\" When the blue eyes devoid of feeling looked into hers, she faltered for only a moment, then began with purpose, \"The Arabian in the stall next to your mustang belongs to Mr. Lawrence.\" At the mention of that name Frank's hard jaw shifted and a dangerous light flashed across his eyes. Jazira continued, \"I went to down there to look for you. . .I had looked all over the ship. I couldn't find you anywhere. . .\" She paused and Frank's eyes dodged hers, but he stubbornly offered no explanation. She picked up the story, \"I recognized the stallion. He once belonged to my father.\" Frank was surprised and looked at her compassionately, but her eyes now avoided his as she continued, \"Mr. Lawrence came in, and I asked him how he had known my father. We talked and I asked him had he been to Arabia lately.\" Jazira glanced up to see Frank listening intently. She said dramatically, \"Frank, he is the British Minister of Foreign Affairs.\" Franks lips pursed together, his eyes took on a haughty expression, and he turned his head sharply to the right with a grunt. Jazira continued resolutely, \"Mr. Lawrence told me that he was working to find a way to contact a young English woman in Najd.\" Frank noticed that Jazira's tone became more enthusiastic as she related the account with growing personal interest. \"Her father was a British officer, and the family had camped at the edge of his outpost along the Asir. The young English girl was seventeen years old, very beautiful, and she captured the attention of a young Arab man, Amid al-Rashid. One day she disappeared, and no one knows if the English girl went by choice or if she was taken by force.\" Jazira was caught up in the story and she looked shyly up at Frank whose face had softened, his eyes fastened on the vivid expression on Jazira's face. Encouraged she continued, \"Recently Mr. Lawrence's office in London discovered which city the English girl is living in, but they have yet to find a way to contact her. The British protectorate does not extend that far, and relations over there are tense.\" Jazira interrupted her own story and looked directly at Frank, \"Women in my world are treated far differently than those in the West. We have no choices. Men, outsiders, especially foreigners are not allowed into the sanctum. If the English girl was taken by force, there is no one who can hear her to help her, if she was went by choice, perhaps her choice is different now. But her father needs to know.\" Jazira added in an emphatic whisper, \"I need to know.\" As Madame de la Roche's fine soprano rose an octave higher, Frank leaned forward, his hands clasped together on the table nearly touching Jazira's slender hands. Jazira's voice took on a decisive note that contrasted to the enchanting melody in the background, \"I told Mr. Lawrence I would help him, and the English girl's father. Although, I believe they are one in the same. I will go into the city where they know her to be and make the necessary contact for them, but more importantly, for her. And if she wishes, she can escape, like I did.\" Frank's head was pounding with pressure and his voice was louder than he meant for it to be as he exclaimed, \"Jazira, you don't even know the woman!\" Jazira replied with solidity, \"I may not know her, but I know her plight.\" Frank saw the conviction on her face, her stubborn will. He recognized it because he understood it, but he didn't agree with it, or with her. Guests at nearby tables turned to look at them. Frank's voice dropped to a urgent whisper, \"Yes, but you can't just walk into Arabia anymore, Princess.\" He put deliberate emphasis on the last word and Jazira's eye narrowed as she retorted, \"There is no reason for Prince Bin al-Reeh to know I will be in Arabia, he will have no cause to look for me.\" Frank's eyes were distressed as he thought to himself, 'hunt for you' would be more precise. Instead he reminded her dramatically, \"And who would have thought anyone would recognize you on this ship? Your chances of being discovered at an Arab port like Aden or Jordan is not something I want to gamble with, and I am no gambler.\" Jazira balked, \"It is not your gamble, Frank Hopkins. It's my life, my choice.\" It was a simple statement but it carried the note of finality. Frank's spirit was roused and he said in rejoinder, \"We were going to speak to the Captain tonight about sharing our lives and our choices.\" Jazira's cheeks flamed, her eyes lowered, \"That is why I have already told Mr. Lawrence that I will help him in Arabia. It was my choice.\" She softened the impact by explaining, \"I couldn't have that responsibility unfulfilled hanging over my head on such a special night, such an important night in my life.\" Frank was thinking quickly for some way to reach her, to reason her out of her decision, to make her see things differently, but she said, \"No amount of personal happiness is worth a person's life.\" The words resonated in Frank. He said earnestly, \"It's your life I'm concerned about. You're gambling with your very life.\" He recalled the scene in the cargo hold, Mr. Lawrence's last words to her, and he added in a final effort to dissuade her, \"Mr. Lawrence is right when he said meeting you on this ship was no mere accident. Something more is going on here, he's not told you the whole story, Jazira. I tell you, that man is hiding something. Do you want to risk your life for someone who cannot even tell you the truth?\" Jazira looked at Frank in disbelief, feeling like his accusations mocked her, and as an attempt to control her as she had been in her past. Her dark eyes flashed and she challenged him, \"Are you saying that I don't know what I'm doing?\" Frank regretted the words that slipped out of his wounded heart as soon as they were out of his mouth, \"Well, do you?\" Jazira stood up, even as Madame de la Roche reached the crescendo of her operatta, and said with fire in her voice, \"If you question my judgment so much, it's a wonder you asked me to marry you at all.\" She spun away in a blaze of crimson, gold silk, and ebony hair and weaved her way through the room and it's occupants. Frank stood up immediately and called after her, \"Jazira!\" His voice was drowned in applause for the performance.[Chapter 8] Thenserver was confused as he delivered food to a table with nonoccupants. He looked around the dining room which seemed to move ennmasse, shrugged his shoulders, and returned to the kitchen. Thencrowd also prevented Frank from catching up with Jazira who seemed tonvanish from the room. He looked over the heads of the throng as henmaneuvered towards the exit, but was halted by a steady stream ofnmusic lovers trying to reach the soprano. Frank looked around as henwaited, his eyes almost magnetically drawn to that exclusive andndistant corner of the room where Mr. Lawrence was standing andnreceiving his top hat from the attendant who then bowed to him andnthe Captain. Frank thought to himself, that he might well be thenMinister of Foreign Affairs, but that man had some questions tonanswer, and there was no time like the present. Finally there was anbreak in the traffic and Frank reached the doorway. He lookednoutside along the deck in vain, Jazira was no where in sight. Franknre-entered the room and loosely grasped the attendant's arm as henwas about to direct a young family to their table, \"Excusenme, is there another exit to this room?\" Thenattendant freed his arm and said with a hint of aggravation, \"Therenis an exit through the service corridor.\" He premeditated Frank'snnext question and answered, \"It's to your right.\" Frankngrinned, \"Thanks.\" Henpushed his hat more firmly onto his head and found the hallway. Thenservice corridor was long and narrow, but well lit by the lamps alongnthe wall. Frank estimated the size of the dining room and chose thendoor that fit the measure. He leaned against the wall, his hat lownover his eyes, his arms folded across his chest and waited. nPresently he heard voices approaching the door from the other side,nthen it opened and he heard a familiar English accent, \".n. .so all the men in my family carry the initials T.E. I'mnTheodore Elliot, as you already know, and my son is Thomas EdwardnLawrence, but his friends in school simply call him T.E.\" \"Yes,nbut will the lad carry on the tradition when he has children of hisnown?\" came the hearty reply from the familiar voice of the Captain. \"Onlyntime will tell, for who can dictate. . .\"and the words stopped asnMr. Lawrence looked up as he rounded the door to see the intimidatingncowboy waiting for him. When Mr. Lawrence stopped, the Captainnpushed his head around the diplomat to see what was wrong. Frankndidn't move a muscle as his eyes looked from one to the other ofnthe men. The Captain's voice dropped to a hard whisper, \"Donyou want me to get 'the boys', Ted?\" Mr.nLawrence studied Frank a moment but said, \"No, no Captain, don'tndisturb them. This was bound to happen sooner or later.\" Then hensaid more to Frank than the Captain, \"I should have surmised thatnwhen Riyadh left the table so quickly, I would be paid such a visit.\" ThenCaptain seemed to consider calling 'the boys' anyway, butnfollowed the lead of Mr. Lawrence. Mr. Lawrence looked directly atnFrank, seemingly armored to the threatening expression cloudingnFrank's eyes. He asked with a depreciating grin, \"Whyndid your lady friend leave in such a hurry, Mr. Hopkins?\" Frank'snblue eyes were as cold as ice, his voice deadly calm, \"Let'snanswer my questions first.\" Mr.nLawrence scrutinized Frank who leaned against the wall. The cowboynwas taut, like a cocked firearm, ready to pull the trigger at anyntime. The confidence, the control, and the attitude won Mr.nLawrence's respect and he asked, \"Wherenwould you like to have this little discussion, Mr. Hopkins?\" Franknanswered, \"How about that little corner you liked so well earliernthis evening?\" ThenCaptain looked from Mr. Lawrence to Frank and back to Mr. Lawrence,nwith doubt as to the wisdom of Mr. Lawrence's choice. Personally,nhe would liked to have had Frank locked up for threatening a Britishndiplomat, but how would you explain locking a man up for his lethalneyes?[Chapter 9] Thencorner table where Frank had spotted Mr. Lawrence and the Captainnearlier looked much different from this perspective. It seemed morenlike an alcove suited to confidential conversation and with a view ofnthe entire dining room. As he sat down, Frank noticed the droppednceiling and the dim chandelier that added to the privacy. A waitednapproached Mr. Lawrence before he could be seated and bowednmechanically saying, \"Mr.nLawrence, sir, may I get you something to drink, sir?\" Mr.nLawrence handed the servant his hat and sat down formally ordering,n\"Gin over ice, Mr. Hopkins?\" Franknreplied briskly without interest, \"Whiskey.\" Thenwaiter asked Mr. Lawrence, \"Will there be anything else, sir?\" Mr.nLawrence looked at Frank who impatiently bided his time and replied,n\"No, that is all.\" \"Veryngood sir,\" and the uniform disappeared. Franknglanced over at the table he and Jazira had been sitting at earliernand decided that from the clear dead center view of it, they had notnbeen led there by chance. He looked at Mr. Lawrence and wonderednjust what amount of subterfuge was he capable of. Mr. Lawrencenwatched him and was not embarrassed when Frank suddenly turned tonface him asking, \"Howndid you know she was on board?\" Mr.nLawrence gave him a languid smile and responded, \"I am a Ministernof Foreign Affairs. Therefore, it's my business to be aware of thenaffairs of foreigners.\" Frankncut his eyes at him and raised an eyebrow debating, \"You don'tnknow the whereabouts of all foreigners, so why her? How did you knownshe was on this ship?\" His eyes challenged Mr. Lawrence, as henrepeated with a touch of mockery, \"After all, as you said, 'meetingnyou on board this ship is no mere accident.'\" Thenserver brought the drinks, and tried to secretly slip Mr. Lawrence annote, but Frank's eyes had seen enough playing cards slip out of anshirt sleeve's cuff not to miss the folded paper that slid out fromnthe server's. To Frank's surprise, Mr. Lawrence held it up fornhim to see, then opened it and said aloud, \"ThenCaptain is reminding me, his constabulary on this ship are postednoutside the dining room should you attempt to molest me in any way.\" Franknappreciated the humor with which Mr. Lawrence treated the messagenfrom the over zealous Captain. The diplomat added with his dry voicenand a lopsided grin, \"So, you've been warned Mr. Hopkins.\" Franknnodded with a quick smirk of his own. Mr. Lawrence dismissed thenyoung man, \"That's all, thank you.\" Then he took a drink ofnhis gin, noting that Frank merely held his glass between his hands;nhe had a single purpose--the answers to his questions. Mr.nLawrence resumed, \"Well, I could tell you, Mr. Hopkins, that I sawnMiss Riyadh's name on the ship's passenger list. . .\" Franknknew more was coming but interrupted roughly, \"Why, is that whatnyou told her?\" Mr.nLawrence ignored the question and continued, \"I could say that Inrecognized her father's signet ring.\" Frank's look of surprisendid not escape Mr. Lawrence and he taunted, \"She was wearing itnthis evening. Did you not notice it, Mr. Hopkins? The sheik'snring is quite unique. You must ask her to show it to you sometime.\" Frankntilted his head back, inhaling deeply and finding the exact spot onnthe side of that prominent nose looking down at him where he couldnplace a right hook. Mr. Lawrence however, moved on to the nextnpoint, \"Or, I could tell you that two friends you made during yournsojourn in England contacted my office.\" Henpaused to let the words register as he took a swallow of his gin,npurposely rattling the ice saying, \"You're asking yourself, 'whatnfriends?' Well, they are actually my friends, but you met them innEngland. They told me you would be in Liverpool, likely to depart onnthe next ship back for America, with the noble daughter of Sheik binnRiyadh.\" Frank'snface was grim as he looked from his whiskey to Mr. Lawrence and saidnthickly, \"Lord Wellingham and Major Davenport.\" AsnMr. Lawrence spoke, Frank took a drink, \"Yes, the very men. I'venknown them both for years.\" Franknlooked straight at Mr. Lawrence and asked abruptly, \"Is it true,nthe story about your daughter?\" Franknnoticed the surprise that flashed across Mr. Lawrence's passivenface. Then the Englishman asked in some disbelief, \"So, shenfigured it out. That's what she told you, that it is my daughternwho is missing?\" Franknreflected on Jazira's words at the dinner table and said, \"Yep.\" Mr.nLawrence shook his head with a slight smile. Frank detected thentraces of sadness in his eyes, which immediately hardened once morenas he said, \"Andnthat's why I've asked Miss Riyadh for her assistance, which wasnno doubt your next question. She's intelligent, she's intuitive,nshe's well bred, she's well educated, she's Arabic yet shenspeaks English, she's got heart, and she's beautiful.\" Franknspoke intensely, \"It may be of no concern to you, but it willnaffect your purpose in sending Jazira back to Arabia. She has anprice on her head.\" Mr.nLawrence checked his mental dossier on the sheik's daughter andnreplied, \"Are you speaking of Prince Bin al-Reeh and the failednmarriage, or I should say the bride that ran away? It's beennseveral years ago. It was all concerning that horse, anyway.\" Franknsaid stubbornly, \"The fact is she's not safe there. You cannwound a man's pride deeply enough and he won't ever forget it.\" Mr.nLawrence seemed to consider Frank's point of view and repliedncarelessly, \"She'll be protected. It certainly wouldn't be innmy best interests if she were harmed in any way. She's perfect forngetting the information we need out of Najd.\" Someonenwith a background other than Frank's would not have caught it,nwould not have picked up on the \"we\", but he had been used in thenpast, he was aware of ulterior motives and hidden agendas. Mr.nLawrence drank the rest of his gin as Frank contended, \"I'venworked with people like you before, and one thing experience hasntaught me is that you never get the whole story. What else is goingnon in Najd? What are you really using Jazira for?\" Mr.nLawrence's eyes grew dark, his face suddenly cast in shadow as hensaid quietly, \"If that's true, that you have worked in officialncapacity before, then you know you will never hear the whole story,nnot from anyone, and not from me. If you're concerned aboutnRiyadh's safety, then I suggest you come to Arabia as well. Ofncourse, I cannot guarantee for your safety in the least.\"[Chapter 10] Withnthe night sky wrapping around the ship, Frank felt as though he werencut off from the rest of the world. Passing through the intermittentnstreams of light shining from the lamps along the outside wall andnthe ship's railing, he walked slowly along the deck, deep innthought, his hands in his pockets. The refreshing ocean breezenlifted the lapels of his leather jacket and the damp hair lyingnacross his forehead under his Stetson, cooling his ruddy cheeks as henthought about his intense conversation with Mr. Lawrence. Thenintimate scene he had walked in on in the cargo hold popped into hisnmind again. Mr. Lawrence had been standing close to Jazira, holdingnher hand. He had heard Jazira's explanation, he had the storynfurther detailed by Mr. Lawrence, but under it all there was stillnthe feeling of rejection. Frank stopped walking and propped himselfnup against the railing, finally leaning down and resting his elbowsnalong the top of it. Jazira had agreed with him that he should speaknto the Captain, she had wanted to get married, yet she chose tonreturn to Arabia with Mr. Lawrence. The thought still stung him,nthough he had lived with it now for the past several hours. Hendragged his hand across his face, wishing he could wipe away the painnin his heart so easily. No amount of explanation could take awaynthat hurt. Sullen he considered that he didn't have to go tonArabia with them, this was Jazira's mission, after all, Mr.nLawrence would be looking out for her. Jazira could go back home tonArabia, apparently that's what she wanted, and he could go backnhome to America, he could track the mustangs, find Hidalgo, start hisnranch. . .Yeah, he had choices too. Franknstood up and stretched, then resumed walking to his cabin. A deepnfrown had set in when he reached the door to his room and pulled thenkey out of his pocket. He opened the door only to be welcomed bynmelancholy darkness. Keeping the door propped open with his rightnhip, he found the lamp with light coming through from the corridor. nWhen light finally diffused the darkness, he let the door close andnlooked up, startled to see a crimson, gold and ebony form curled upnin the low wing back chair in the corner of his room. His frownndisappeared, he cocked his head to one side, his lips parted as heninhaled deeply. He gazed at her for a full minute, compassionnflooding his heart. She had been waiting for him and had fallennasleep in that uncomfortable chair. How much he loved her! It wasncrazy to think of going back to America without her. He only wantednthat ranch if she was on it with him. He had left her once before,nthinking it would be easy to cross an ocean and a country, live withnhis Indian brothers, make peace with his past and go on without her. nHe had been wrong. Frank tossed the key onto his bed and walked overnto Jazira. Her face was buried in the crook of her arm. Franknsmiled and ran his hand gently over the ebony hair that spilled overnher shoulder. He positioned himself so that he would be the firstnthing she saw when she opened her eyes, and sat back on his heels. nHe squeezed her shoulder. She jumped and raising her head, openednher eyes to find Frank grinning at her. She blinked once and thennremembered. A stricken look came over her face and she sat upnquickly saying, \"Frank,nI'm sorry. Everything came out wrong this evening. I can'tnexplain it, but this is just something that I have to do. I know younsaid before that you couldn't hate me, but I understand if. . .if.n. .\" Jazirancouldn't speak as Frank's hand reached up and cupped her sleepy,nworried face. His thumb traced the outline of her lips as he saidnsoftly, \"Riding away into the setting of the sun isn't going tondo me a bit of good, if you're aren't there. I'm going withnyou!\"[Chapter 11] Mr.nLawrence was pleased when after several more days at sea, the shipnthat had sailed from Liverpool finally docked in the New York harbor,nand there had been no further attempts by Frank or Jazira to speaknwith the Captain about marrying them. The last thing Mr. Lawrencenneeded to complicate matters in Najd were newlyweds. Besides, henknew his young Arabian agent, who he planned to use to get Jaziraninside the city of al-Rashid and into the court of the women, wouldnbe less than pleased to be working with a woman of his own race whonhad chosen to marry a foreigner. No, after hearing Major Davenportnrelate how beautiful the sheik's daughter was, Mr. Lawrence knewnshe would be the perfect choice for Hasani, a handsome young man thenBritish had befriended and found useful in their affairs with Arabnprovinces. Hasani was now a displaced person, and he needed ancompanion if he was going to continue working with the British. Ofncourse, Jazira didn't know about Hasani and Mr. Lawrence planned tonwait until they were on the ship to Arabia before going into furtherndetail about what would be required of her once they reached Najd. nIn an effort to further cement her cooperation, when he saw Jazirannuzzling his stallion in the cargo hold one evening as they nearednthe New York harbor, Mr. Lawrence told her that the stallion wouldnbecome hers if she found his daughter in al-Rashid. Mr. Lawrencenadmitted to himself there were not many moments in his line of worknthat gave him a sense of pride, but the way Jazira's face lit upnwith her brilliant smile, when he made the offer of his Arabian innexchange for locating his daughter, would be a moment he would nevernforget. She was such a winning creature, it was no wonder FranknHopkins was drawn to her. Mr. Hopkins, however, was a differentnmatter. When he met Frank earlier, after their discussion in thendining room, he asked the cowboy if he had decided to go on to Arabianwith them, half expecting him to say no. However, he was faced withna new dilemma when Frank, observing his reaction closely, eagerlynagreed to join them on the trip. It would be disaster if Hasani metnFrank Hopkins, the entire mission would be compromised. Mr. Lawrencenknew he had vast resources at hand once they reached Aden to keepnFrank away from Jazira and Hasani. On the other hand, if for somenunforeseeable reason, Jazira no longer wanted to cooperate, Mr.nLawrence could always use Frank as leverage, so there was thatnadvantage. Meanwhile, he had the long trip to Arabia to divine anplan for keeping Jazira and Frank apart from one another. Oncenthey were in the New York harbor, Mr. Lawrence left the ship to booknpassage for Jazira and himself on the next ship bound for Arabia. nFrank followed to make his own similar arrangements. Jazira stoodnalong the thoroughfare waiting, the mustang and stallion held by anattendant a few feet away. In the busy harbor, a place accustomed toninternational travelers, Jazira's exotic dress did not attractnmuch attention. It was her first time setting foot in America, yetnshe felt relaxed and comfortable among the bustling crowd, observingneverything and everyone around her. Her eyes only rested briefly onnthe interesting Eastern man in the Western dress of an Englishman. nHe stood at a large flat surfaced podium going over his books with anmonocle over one eye. Then Jazira's attention focused on anothernperson that caught her eye. Thengentleman at the podium, Rasmussen, had felt that someone in thencrowd was looking directly at him, and he raised his head from hisnwork. His eyes immediately found the enchanting young woman innexquisite Arabian dress. He stared at her appreciatively for anmoment, then called out to his busy assistant nearby, \"Bertholdt!\" Whennthe man came to his side, Rasmussen directed, \"Find out who thatnyoung woman is, and if she need any assistance. In particular, findnout her name.\" AsnBertholdt walked away, Rasmussen continued to stare, there wasnsomething indefinably familiar about this young woman, although itnwas obvious this was her first time in this harbor, and in thisncountry. Of more interest, was the great ring on the young woman'snthumb. It was not a ring made for a woman. There was something evennmore familiar about that piece of jewelry. Rasmussen noticed thatnshe purposely glanced off to the right. He turned his head to seenwhat had caught her attention, even as Bertholdt reached her side. nWhat Rasmussen saw, astounded him and solved as well as added to thenmystery. Immediately he recognized the Minister of Foreign Affairs,nand he also recognized the cowboy walking alongside of him. nRasmussen would always remember Frank Hopkins, and the merchant'snsmile grew wider. So, the enchanting young woman his assistant wasnspeaking with was none other than Sheik bin Riyadh's daughter. Bertholdtnconfirmed this assumption, saying, \"She says her name is Jazira binnRiyadh and that this is her first time in America, and that she hasncompanions taking care of her passage to Arabia.\" Rasmussennwas not just a merchant by trade, he was also a merchant at heart. nSo, the sheik's daughter was returning to Arabia after a wellnpublicized two year absence. Surely, there had to be a profit madenin delivering that kind of news to the right people. Prince binnAl-Reeh would certainly be glad to pay for such information. nRasmussen couldn't understand though, how Mr. Lawrence played intonthe scheme of things, and that, he knew, was where the big profitnlay. Change was in the air.[Chapter 12] Thisntime aboard the City of Paris , sailing to Arabia, Frank feltnlike he was in his own skin. It seemed he was spending more time atnsea these days than on dry land. Nothing more had been said aboutnmarriage, Frank and Jazira's first fight had reminded them of thenvast differences between them. There was definite attraction on bothnsides, and they shared fundamental feelings about life, but theirnbackgrounds and cultures were gulfs they now saw the need to bridge. nDuring the voyage, they shared breakfast together and walked the shipnsharing their personal histories and in general learning one another.n Frank had never shared so much of himself with another person. nThere were things he told Jazira he had never told anyone else, nonone had been that interested, not even Chief Eagle Horn. There werenhumorous details of his life, his adventures with Buffalo Bill Codynthat entertained her, and Frank liked making her laugh out loud sonfreely that she forgot trying to stifle the musical sound. However,non one occasion he related a story that involved a careless accident,na result of his over drinking. Instead of laughing as he hadnintended for her to do, her eyes shined with emotion as she placed antender hand along his weathered cheek and looked deeply into his eyesnsaying with pain on her face, \"Oh,nHok'shel'ato.\" Innthat moment Frank was completely vulnerable as he felt the concernnand love flow from Jazira through him. Somehow, though, Mr. Lawrencenalways seemed to be lurking in the background. It was obvious thentwo men did not have much use for one another and Frank would usuallyngo off to exercise his mustang when he saw Mr. Lawrence approaching. Onensuch day during the voyage, Frank left Jazira in a lounge chair,nreading a book as he went down to the cargo hold to check on hisnhorse. Frank had not been gone long when Jazira was joined by anyoung man who chose, out of several empty deck chairs, the one besidenher. Jazira looked up from her book, to see if she recognized thenyoung man, but did not. He immediately looked at her, flashed anwide, friendly smile and put out a hand to introduce himself. Jaziranshyly responded to the stranger, who inexplicably pulled up hisnchair, moving so close to her own that Jazira's eyes showed alarm. nShe did not want to seem rude and leave as the young man was in thenmiddle of pleasant conversation. He did not say anything out of thenway, so she remained. His conversation was so animated that it drewnthe attention of passersby. Jazira wanted to return to her book, butnthe young man discussed a variety of subjects, and he talked at suchnlength that Jazira finally relaxed and grew accustomed to hisnpresence. Eventually, she began to respond to his remarks, whichnseemed to excite him further. Indeed, by all appearances he wasnquite interested, even absorbed, in her, which was the way it wasndesigned to look when Frank finally came in search for her. When thencowboy rounded the corner, he could sense a buzz of excitement fromnother passengers he greeted along the way. But he saw the embodimentnof enthusiasm when he caught sight of the good looking young mannsitting askew in a deck chair pulled very close to Jazira's. Henwas leaning in towards her, completely focused on her. Jazira hadncrowded herself into the furthers part of her own chair to creatensome distance between them, and while she was not captivated by him,nshe was smiling. Frank had never considered himself a jealous man,nbut then his heart had never been so involved with any one. Heatnflooded through his body, he felt his heart pounding in his chest asnhe noted the flirtatious movements of the young man's head, hands,nand even his dark eyes. Frank squinted across the distance, this wasnno gentleman, just a fast young man using his charm on Jazira. Andnit was about to stop. Frank tugged on his belt and strode forward,nhis boots making confident contact with the polished hardwood on thendeck. Jazira heard him coming and twisted around in her chair tonlook up and welcome him with a smile, but Frank's eyes werenunreasonably threatening, she thought, and he refused to look at her.n He only saw the young man who continued talking though he had lostnJazira's attention. Frank stood commandingly over him and saidngruffly, \"Jazira,nis he bothering you? Because this chair. . .\"and Frank put hisnboot on the side of it and pushed it back with a loud scuff, \"isntoo close to yours, and if he could see, this young man would noticenhow uncomfortable you are have to sit on the edge of yours.\" Thenyoung man was startled by the sudden use of force and his face showednit. Jazira felt responsible and stood up taking Frank by the elbowncalmly entreating, \"No, Frank, it's all right. He just wanted tontalk.\" Thenyoung man was regaining his balance as Frank's eyes narrowed and hensaid with a bite of sarcasm, \"Yeah, sure.\" Thenyoung man looked up with a sly, saucy grin as he stood up and said tonJazira, \"It's been a pleasure. I wasn't aware that I had madenyou uncomfortable, but I certainly seem to have made younuncomfortable, now. Good day.\" Hensmiled and went so far as to wink at her, causing Frank to take anstep towards him, but for Jazira's restraining hand, he may notnhave walked away so easily. Frank's temperature had not cooled offnmuch when he turned to Jazira who was trying to understand what hadnjust taken place. She said, \"Frank,nI don't see what there is to be so upset about.\" Franknbreathed deeply and looked to over his shoulder to see that the youngnman had disappeared. He reminded himself he was not angry withnJazira and that in her world she had not been allowed muchninteraction with men. Perhaps it was time for a lesson. He saidnpatiently, \"I'llnshow you.\" He took several steps away from her and asked, \"Cannyou hear me?\" Jaziranwas perplexed, \"Yes.\" Franknsmiled, \"Right, so from the distance you can hear me, but it'snnot good for conversation unless you want everyone to hear you. So,nI step closer.\" Hentook a big step and closed some of the space, \"And now, you cannhear me even better, but is this a comfortable distance to you?\" \"No,\"ncame Jazira's answer. Franknwas grinning now, \"That's right, there can be too manyndistractions with this distance between us. So I step again.\" Jaziransmiled up at him, \"Yes, this is right, that is comfortable.\" Frankndidn't say anything, he only nodded, then he took another stepntowards her, and stood very close in front of her . He noticed hernbreathing quickened, her eyelids fluttered, as she looked past hisnhard chest into his blue eyes, her cheeks turned a delightful shadenof pink. He could almost sense the delicious tingles of her skin. nFrank waited a moment then said softly, \"Andnthis is the distance for intimate conversation.\" He paused asnJazira seemed to be counting the buttons on his shirt. Then henadded, breaking the spell, \"And that is how close that guy appearednto be to you.\" Jazira'snhead shot up and she contradicted, \"No, it wasn't!\" Franknfelt frustration that she wanted to defend him, and challenged, \"Thennwhy were you sitting so far back in your chair?\" Jazirantried to reason, \"Frank, there was nothing intimate about it, henwas just talking, he talked about everything.\" \"Maybennot on your part, but there was on his, trust me, I know . . .\" Asnthe little spat erupted, further down the deck, Mr. Lawrence lookednon with a smile. If he timed it right, Frank Hopkins would leave onna bad note when he walked up to them. Mr. Lawrence saw Jazira'snhands go to her hips, and made his move.[Chapter 13] Jaziranbit her bottom lip as she tried to meekly listen to Frank argue hisnpoint about presumptuous and assuming young men and how they shouldnbe dealt with. Movement caught her attention from the corner of herneye, and she looked over her shoulder to see Mr. Lawrence approachingnthem, with a warm smile, so unlike Frank's present mood. Franknfollowed Jazira's glance in that direction and when he saw thendiplomat, he cut his words off in mid sentence, flipped his head backnand huffed, saying under his breath, \"Great.\" Jazirangave Frank a warning look as he rolled his eyes and gritted hisnteeth. He put his hands on his own lean hips saying caustically,n\"When you're done with. . .with Mr. Lawrence of Arabia, you cannfind me in my room.\" He looked with disdain at the man and addednsourly, \"Or the bar.\" Jaziranturned on him sharply, \"Frank!\" Mr.nLawrence reached her just as Frank walked out of ear shot. He saidnquite serenely, \"Good afternoon. It seems that I never get anchance to speak with Mr. Hopkins. I hope I am not the reason he runsnaway from you.\" Jaziranwas still looking at the invisible trail that Frank left, feelingnuneasy, she hardly comprehended Mr. Lawrence's insinuation. Shenanswered with distraction, \"Oh,nno, it is just that. . .he has other things that need to be attendednto.\" Mr.nLawrence said suavely, \"I see. He seems a little hot tempered.\" Jaziranlooked at him wondering what had given him that impression andnreplied defensively, \"No, Frank is not hot tempered. He isnconfident and strong, but he is not easily provoked.\" Mr.nLawrence felt as though he were losing ground and proceeded withncaution, \"I am glad to hear it. I just happened to be coming alongnwhen I observed that little scene with that nice looking gentleman. .n.I just. . .I don't know. . .I thought perhaps Mr. Hopkins was anlittle. . .\" He seemed to be searching for the right word, andnJazira looked at him with some expectation, but she did not supplynwhat he wanted. Finally, after tapping his forefinger against hisnchin he added, \"Unreasonable. Perhaps, over reacting.\" Jazira'snvoice was quiet, she looked down at her hands, her eyes troubled,n\"You did?\" Shenreflected that she had felt the same way when Frank walked up on hernearlier. Mr. Lawrence spoke in a confiding tone, \"I just thoughtnhe came it a bit too strong. After all, it appeared that the youngnman was just talking to you. . .I mean. . .\" suddenly Mr.nLawrence's voice got stern, \"he didn't say anything or donanything. . .\" \"No,nno,\" Jazira reassured. Mr.nLawrence sounded relieved, \"I didn't think so. You seemed to benenjoying his company. And who can blame the young fellow for wantingnto talk with such a captivating young woman. I fear, that isnsomething Mr. Hopkins will just have to get accustomed to.\" Jazira'snhead dipped even lower in embarrassment, her cheeks were flaming. nDuring their brief conversations throughout their voyage, she hadncome to respect Mr. Lawrence without his use of praise or flattery. Mr.nLawrence resumed, \"I suppose, however, that it is good to know hownMr. Hopkins will respond in these type of situations. I came to findnyou this afternoon to tell you more about how we plan to get youninside al-Rashid. Since I cannot seem to speak with Mr. Hopkinsnmyself, I will leave it up to you as to when or how you will explainnthe arrangement to him.\" Jaziranwas focused on Mr. Lawrence as he detailed, \"As you know, youncannot simply move into al-Rashid as a single woman, even if you arenSheik bin Riyadh's daughter. Nor can you go with a Englishnentourage, or an American cowboy. The best, most direct way tonintroduce you to Rashid society without arousing suspicion, is fornyou to enter the city as a new bride, coming to reside with yournhusband. Now, there is a young man, who is a friend of mine, who hasnbeen very helpful to me. He is Arabic, and he is the one who told menthat my daughter was in the city. He took up residence in Rashidnsome months ago, but as a man, even an Arab man, he has no access tonthe women's quarters. When we arrive in Aden, I will send anmessenger ahead of us. Hasani will meet up with us in the Najd. Youndo not have to fear for your safety. Me and my men will benmasquerading as Bedouin just beyond the city, once you are safelyninside. You will be able to see our tents from the rooftops.\" Mr.nLawrence watched Jazira's reaction. There was a look of anxiety onnher face as she considered his plan. It made sense, and bespoke ofnhis knowledge of foreign affairs. After some thought, Jazira askednwisely, \"Thenmarriage is just a ruse to get me inside the city?\" Mr.nLawrence replied, \"Correct.\" Thennshe quizzed, \"Does Hasani know that as well?\" Mr.nLawrence gave a brief smile and answered without looking at her,n\"Hasani is used to adapting to whatever role he is required tonplay.\" He looked directly at Jazira, \"I think you will get onnwell together.\" Jaziranonly thought of Frank, where would he be, and how was she going tonexplain this new development to him?[Chapter 14] Overnthe Arabian Sea the night sky sparkled with hundreds of glitteringnstars. Appreciating their beauty, Jazira looked up at the familiarnsky once more before entering the stair well leading to the cargonhold. Earlier she had met Frank and both of them had used the excusenof being too tired, so they had skipped dinner. Jazira'snconscience smote her, tired she was not. Her neck literally achednwith the burden Mr. Lawrence had placed on her shoulders, and hernmind spun ways to explain this new plan of his to Frank. The starsnwere an inviting sight to behold. They reminded her that this day,nwhen it was over, would take it's place in her past along with allnthe others. How often she used to sit and look up at the stars withnher father. She missed him, she missed his counsel. He wouldncertainly lecture her now, about her headstrong will, her defiantnspirit; it always sounded more harsh than he intended. The Sheik hadnbeen their to smooth out the hard roads in life, to prevent her fromnbeing too near sighted, always reminding her to think about thenfuture, her future. Now that Jazira had her freedom, she appreciatednthe security of having boundaries in life. Since leaving England,nshe was directing her own course, her own life, making her ownnchoices. It was frightening to think that time was her only measurento determine if she had chosen wisely. Suddenly, on this ship fullnof people, Jazira felt all alone. She entered the stair well. SincenMr. Lawrence had promised her the stallion, the son of the greatnAl-Altair, it was Jazira's evening ritual to give the horse a goodngoing over with the curry comb. As she descended the steps annelderly gentleman passed her on his way up saying politely, \"Goodnevening.\" Jaziranreturned the kindness. As she turned the corner she stoppednabruptly. The stallion was standing in the middle of the alleyway,nFrank was bent over, briskly brushing the Arabian's immense frontnquarter flank. Apparently, he had not been tired either. Jaziranstepped forward, silently. As Frank stretched toward the horse'snforeleg, he caught sight of the leather sandals peeping out fromnunder the hem of the olive green and golden skirt. He stopped andnstood up. His undershirt, the only shirt he had on, was open at thenneck, the sleeves rolled up to the elbows. The sheen of prespirationngave his skin a healthy glow. A bead of sweat escaped his brow andntrickled down the side of his face. Something inarticulate had hungnbetween them all evening, and Frank noticed the crease on Jazira'snforehead, the worry generated in the back of her eyes. The fact thatnshe remained unusually quiet, even as she was now, only provednsomething was troubling her. But, she had not told him what wasnwrong, and he would not force it out, she would have to come out withnit on her own. Frank did feel for her, however. Whatever thentrouble was, it was obviously a heavy burden to bear. Soncompassionately he started the conversation, \"Hi,nit seems like neither one of us was as tired as we thought we were.\" Frankngave Jazira a quick, encouraging smile and bent back down to hisnwork. Jazira responded hesitantly, \"No,nI guess we weren't.\" Franknfound refuge in his work. There was a barrel standing along thenopposite wall and Jazira walked over and sat down on it. Leaningnback against the wall, she silently watched Frank work. She couldnsee the pull of his muscles through his shirt, the power in his armsnmeasuring out the right amount of pressure in his strokes with thenbrush. There was something fortifying watching a man at work. nJazira sighed. Frank heard her and as he continued working hendecided how he could best help her. When he finally finished withnthe stallion, he slapped him on the rump and said, \"Therenyou go, partner. As good as new.\" He led the Arabian back intonthe stall and shut the gate, sliding the bolt home. Jaziranfelt like her opportunity was slipping away and spoke tensely,n\"Frank, there's something I need to tell you.\" Thatnkind of statement was the stuff his nightmares were made of, he wasnglad his back was to her. He closed his eyes a second, gatheringnhimself together before he turned around to face her. From where henstood he said gently, \"No,nJazira, not tonight. There is something I would like to say to you,nthough.\" Thenlook of relief that flashed across her face did not escape hisnnotice. Frank began, \"There was a time when I got involved innsomething much bigger than me. I was trying to do something good fornmyself, and there was a point when I said it was 'too late to turnnback now'. I already had too much involved, and too much at stake.n But it turned out to be one of the best things to happen in my life.nIt did change me, for the good.\" Jaziranlovingly smiled at him, she knew he was speaking about the GreatnRace. Frank stepped towards her and continued, \"And there was antime when I believed I should give it all up, I should quit, that Inwasn't worth the achievement of what I had set out to do, tonaccomplish. But then you told me, Jazira, blood is not morenimportant than will. You've used your will, deciding to help Mr.nLawrence. I understand that. But, I just want to remind you. .n.\"Frank stepped forward again, now very close to Jazira. From hernperch on the barrel she looked up into his eyes, and he lookednserenely down into hers, saying conclusively, \"It's your will,nnot mine, not his, that controls your future. Just remember that.\" Henplaced a reassuring hand on her shoulder and coaxed her into thencircle of his arm to exit the cargo hold together. She leaned intonhim, her head resting against his chest as they walked side by side. nShe whispered, \"Thanknyou.\"[Chapter 15] It was midday when the City of Paris docked at the Aden wharf. Jazira felt an intense mixture of sadness and excitement as she stepped on the deck to meet Frank and Mr. Lawrence who were waiting for her. The usually spacious deck was filling up quickly as passengers scrambled about, ready to disembark. None of the three spoke for a moment as the noise around them peaked in discussions about packages, cabins, keys, luggage, transportation, and destinations. Jazira looked at the familiar harbor, the native people, the camels standing along the dock for hire. She had only been away over two years, but it already seemed like a lifetime ago. The last time she had seen Aden was when she had desperately bartered her passage to England with the Davenports. Jazira was returning to her home a different woman, a woman making her own choices. Frank watched the varied emotions that played across her face and touched her arm saying warmly, \"Hey, are you okay?\" Jazira came out of her reverie and answered a little doubtfully, \"Yes, I'm fine.\" Mr. Lawrence cut a look at them and leaned towards her counseling, \"We had best stay close together, or we'll have a devil of a time getting off this ship. It looks like the disembarking will be a general crush. Everyone will probably make a mad dash for it when the ramp is ready.\" Mr. Lawrence glanced up at Frank who asked, \"Where are you going from there?\" Mr. Lawrence's face showed some surprise. He glimpsed at Jazira whose face remained passive, and after a pause he replied, \"Well, I will need to check in with my office here in Aden. Jazira will need to accompany me. After that we will procure some lodging for the evening, which should not present a problem. Then Miss Riyadh will no doubt want to get some shopping done to obtain a suitable wardrobe.\" He stopped unsure of how much to give away, then continued, \"Of course, as you know my dear, it will mean purdah for you once more.\" Jazira unusually quiet simply nodded. Frank asked gruffly, \"Purdah, what's that?\" Jazira looked up at him and explained, \"It's the tradition of secluding women from the public view.\" Frank looked deep into her eyes saying, \"That's one tradition I never cared for.\" The sadness in Jazira's eyes changed to a mischievous twinkle as Frank's eyes seemed to challenge her. Mr. Lawrence broke their thoughts saying, \"Tomorrow morning we shall be on our way to the Najd and to al-Rashid. Are you intending to follow us, Mr. Hopkins?\" Frank answered, \"That's my intention.\" Mr. Lawrence authoritatively held onto the lapel of his jacket with his thumb and forefinger saying, \"Of course you know . . .\" Frank knew what was coming and interrupted, \"Yeah, I know.\" Jazira looked at them both wishing she knew what that exchange meant. When the ramp was finally in place, the mass exodus began. Mr. Lawrence turned and looked back over Frank and Jazira's heads before moving forward with the crowd. Jazira asked, \"What is it? What's wrong?\" Mr. Lawrence looked down at her with a smile, \"Nothing, nothing. . .I thought I had forgotten something, but I believe I remembered it after all.\" He put his hand against Jazira's back ushering her in front of him in the slow procession. Frank was annoyed that Mr. Lawrence now stood between him and Jazira as one individual rudely pushed his way by her unintentionally elbowing her in the ribs. Frank shouted out over the noise, \"Hey!\" Mr. Lawrence said nothing. It was their opportunity to board the ramp when a sudden shift in traffic on deck separated Frank from Mr. Lawrence and Jazira. Jazira looked over her shoulder to see that Frank was no longer with them and she grabbed Mr. Lawrence's arm anxiously, \"Wait!\" Swept along in the crowd, they were pushed forward, Mr. Lawrence saying, \"Don't worry, we'll meet him on the wharf.\" He quickly turned and gestured the same message to Frank, still hemmed in on deck. Frank couldn't explain why he suddenly felt suspicious, as Mr. Lawrence's hand on Jazira's shoulder guided her down the gangplank. Frank watched them steadily reach the dock and Mr. Lawrence call an attendant to his side. Jazira was looking up at him apprehensively. Frank decided that now was not the time to be reticent, and tipping his hat he maneuvered through the crowd offering his apologies. Halfway down the long ramp, Frank noticed Mr. Lawrence tipping the attendant for bringing both the stallion and the mustang down the ramp for luggage and livestock. Perhaps he had misjudged the man. \"Hello there,\" greeted a friendly voice at Frank's side. Frank looked at the older man, recognizing him from the cargo hold. He had repeatedly run into the kind gentleman on a number of occasions during the voyage as he came down to look after his horse. Frank gave a nod and returned, \"Howdy.\" As the traffic stalled once more, the older gentleman nodded in Jazira's direction and asked, \"Is that the young lady I saw you with the other night?\" Frank squinted at him but responded, \"Yes.\" The older man smiled and said, \" She has influential friends.\" Frank admired the man's vision, but simply asked, \"So, you know him too?\" \"I'm a historian, a professor you could say, it's in my line to know little tidbits like who Theodore Lawrence is. Of course, it's plain to see, he is no friend of yours.\" Frank made no comment as they began moving once again. He saw an opening to exit and said to the man, \"Nice talking to you.\" The older man responded, \"Same to you, young man.\" Then with a note of warning that caught Frank's attention he added, \"And watch yourself.\" Frank now working his way through the crowd looked back at the professor who was looking intently at Jazira. When Frank finally joined them on the dock, he took his mustang from Jazira as she said, \"I was beginning to think you might be stuck up there permanently.\" Frank grinned, \"Me and you both, princess.\" Mr. Lawrence, after looking around, finally asked, \"Are we ready to go then? Jazira, why don't you ride the stallion? That way there will be less of a chance of you being separated from me. . .from us.\" Jazira answered, \"Of course, but you forget, I know my way around here.\" Mr. Lawrence gave her his hand to help her up and said distractedly, \"Yes, yes, but please humor me, dear, in this instance. It's so crowded right now.\" Frank's jaw hardened and he cocked his head to the side. Jazira glanced at him momentarily, but then did as Mr. Lawrence bid and climbed on top of the stallion. Mr. Lawrence went to the Arabian's head and took up the lead rope. As he watched the proceedings with some misgivings, someone tapped Frank on the shoulder. He turned around to see it was and in the moment that it took him to recognize the good looking young man who had cornered Jazira on deck during the voyage, he completely missed seeing the upper cut as it connected with his jaw, immediately followed by a right hook that landed Frank on the Aden dock.[Chapter 16] Mr. Lawrence spoke in such a low tone that with all the noise along the busy street, Jazira had to lean forward in her saddle in order to hear him. As he led the stallion along the passageway, she barely caught his question, \"Did you explain to Mr. Hopkins, how you are getting into al-Rashid, as a new bride?\" Jazira answered still leaning forward, \"I told Frank that I would have the protection of a guardian. That is accurate enough.\" Mr. Lawrence looked up at her with a knowing gleam in his eyes and with simple admiration, \"Clever.\" Jazira didn't like the look of familiarity that Mr. Lawrence bestowed upon her and she sat up, her cheeks hot. With a feeling of guilt, she turned to look back at Frank, to suddenly realize he was not behind them anymore. She instantly pulled up on the reins even as Mr. Lawrence led the stallion forward. The horse took several steps backward and whinnied. Jazira shouted to Mr. Lawrence, \"Stop! Frank. . .I don't see Frank, he's gone! We must have gotten separated!\" Mr. Lawrence came up and stood at Jazira's side, looking back towards the harbor. Jazira was about to turn the stallion around saying, \"We must turn back and find him.\" Mr. Lawrence placed a restraining hand on his stallion's flank responding, \"No, I don't think he got separated from us. The important thing is to reach my office and get you off the streets and out of sight.\" He then looked up at her adding with regret, \"I should have told you to wear the veil before we got off the ship.\" Jazira heard the anxious tenor of his voice and asked, \"Why?\" \"Because on the ship, I felt as if we were being followed. Once we were on the dock I was almost certain of it. I think that perhaps Mr. Hopkins has purposely stayed behind to discover who is following us. Most importantly for us, for you, and for Mr. Hopkins, is to get inside and out of sight for a few hours.\" Mr. Lawrence moved quickly and took up the lead rope once more and hurried towards his office. Jazira would have found Mr. Lawrence's explanation hard to believe, if she had not experienced that same feeling, of being watched, herself. However, as she craned her neck to look back at the wharf, what concerned her now was the fact that she didn't see Frank, anywhere. On the dock, Frank gingerly raised up, telling himself that if he had not been taken by surprise he would never have been knocked off his feet in the first place. \"Easy, easy does it young man,\" came a kindly voice along with a supporting hand. The more Frank moved the more pain he felt. He refused to groan with the throbbing pain in his head, the dull ache in his stomach, and the jabbing pain in his back. He grimaced instead. The kind voice spoke again, \"That fellow did a thorough job. I suppose it's safe to assume, that he was not a friend of yours either.\" Frank sat up, keeping his eyes closed as his head seemed to spin. He said lightly, but with a slurred voice, \"Guess. . .I wasn't watching. . .myself.\" The man said, \"I noticed you didn't get much help, from anyone.\" Frank opened his eyes trying to discern through the blur if Jazira was in sight. He replied, \"I take care of myself.\" Trying to summon more strength than he felt, Frank pushed himself up into a standing position with the older man's aid. Frank looked at him and saw that it was the professor. The professor steadied Frank saying, \"I imagine that you intend to look after that young lady as well.\" Frank gave a weak nod, but his words rang true, \"That's right.\" As his eyes swept across the people moving around them, the professor said with quiet emphasis, \"Then I think you should know that she is being followed.\" Frank forced his eyes to remain open, and his mind to focus as he asked with alarm, \"What? What do you mean?\" \"Just that, your friend is being followed by an Arab man. I first noticed him on the ship, then on the dock, he was lingering around while I was talking with you on the ramp. And again, just now, when your friend was being led away by Mr. Lawrence, the man was like a shadow hanging behind them and out of sight.\" Frank saw that an attendant was holding onto his and the professor's horses. Frank reached towards him saying, \"I've got to find her.\" The professor asked with concern, \"Are you able to ride? Do you know where you are going?\" Frank answered licking his lips and finding dried blood on them, \"No.\" The professor consulted his fob watch saying, \"Well, I think I may know my way around here a little better than you. Why don't I come along?\" Frank put a foot in the stirrup and replied, \"I'd appreciate it. Thank you kindly.\"[Chapter 17] Franknwas already in his saddle, his eyes skimming the moving throng ofnpeople along the harbor for any sight of Jazira or Mr. Lawrence. Thenprofessor climbed onto his quarter horse asking, \"Donyou know where they were headed?\" Franknanswered, \"He said he had to check in with his office, before theynfound lodging for the night.\" Thenprofessor proved to be an attentive listener and as they put theirnhorses into motion, commented, \"You said, 'they', am I tonassume that you are not included in their plans?\" Franknuncomfortably adjusted his seat in the saddle, unsure of how tonanswer that question. But the facts were, he had not promised, norndid he owe, Mr. Lawrence anything, and Frank could certainly use anfriend, so he answered, \"I'mnhere to look after Jazira. She's not safe here and Mr. Lawrencenhas his own agenda--he's only looking out for his own interests. nWhen she's done what he's asked, he'll be through with her.\" Bothnmen scanned the crowd as they slowly made their way through it tonenter the streets of Aden. The professor remarked, \"Yournfriend, what is her name? Jazira? She's willing to make quite ansacrifice, with her own safety being at risk.\" Franknlooked over at the professor and said with pride, \"She was willingnto do it for me.\" Thenprofessor thought a moment and said, \"I can see, though, how thatnwould put you at odds with Mr. Lawrence. I don't know exactly whatnhe is using Jazira for, but I happen to know he plays a deep hand,neven though the stakes are high.\" Frank slowed his mustang evennmore, giving the professor a questioning look, to which he got thisnresponse, \"The, what shall I call it, errand? The errand, yournfriend may be sent on, may be only a pretense, I don't know. I donknow however, as a historian, that there is evidence of politicalnchange about to occur in some regions of Arabia. That is why I havencome back to this land, I want to see history in the making, I amnafter all, a old and learned man.\" Feelingnoverwhelmed, Frank decided to confide in the older man, \"Mr.nLawrence told Jazira his daughter was taken captive and now lives inna place called Rashid. Do you know if that is true?\" Thenprofessor replied, \"I know that Mr. Lawrence has a fourteen yearnold son, named Thomas Edward, who is already in the university. Andnthat he has a daughter who has been missing for several years innArabia.\" Franknwas humbly surprised, \"So, it's true! Jazira was right!\" Thenprofessor was perplexed and exclaimed suddenly, \"Of course! Thatnmakes sense! That explains everything!\" Franknlooked at the professor with one eyebrow arched, waiting for annexplanation. He was not disappointed. The older man spoke withnexcitement, \"Don'tnyou see? Mr. Lawrence knows there is going to be action in Rashid. nThere is movement in the north, rumors of a Abdul Ibn Saud makingnplans, gathering men to his cause. Mr. Lawrence must know thatnRashid is on the Saud's map for conquest. And he wants hisndaughter out of there, which means it won't be long before Saudnmoves out.\" Franknwas not caught up in the politics, but he wondered if Jazira knew allnthe details. He had never longed to see her so much, and he felt annew respect for her, she was doing something noble, at great risk tonher own life. Frank looked at the mud brick building with anbrilliant red canopy serving as a porch, realizing they had passednthis street once before. He asked the professor who was still deepnin thought, \"Hey,nI thought you said you knew where you were going?\" Thenprofessor woke up and smiled, knowing they had passed the street Mr.nLawrence's office was on long ago, but he had been determined tonget this story out of Frank and he had succeeded. Aloud however, thenprofessor apologized, \"I'mnsorry. I am easily distracted when it comes to my work. Yes, well,nlet me see. . .yes, we have passed by here once before haven't we? nCome, I will show you the street where you can find your young ladynand Mr. Lawrence. And might I add, that since Mr. Lawrence does notnseem willing to include you in his plans for getting to Rashid, thennI will be most glad to accompany you. I think we can be of greatnhelp to one another.\" Franknsaid honestly, \"Perhaps, but we've passed all these placesnbefore! That can't be happening on the way to Rashid. But onenthing at a time, professor. Right now, I am only concerned aboutnfinding Jazira, and finding out who is following her and why.\"[Chapter 18] Thenapartment Mr. Lawrence's office was in, looked like all the otherndwellings in Aden from the outside, but once beyond the door it wasndistinctly British. The furniture, the calendar, the clock, thenmaps, the pictures were all European, all cold formality. The clerknhad even offered Jazira tea, which she refused. All her attentionnwas focused on the entrance and the street just outside, as she hopednwith her entire being for Frank to walk through that door. Seated onna hard chair, waiting for Mr. Lawrence as he talked to an officer whononce looked in her direction but whose voice was too low for her tonhear, Jazira couldn't stop the suspicious thoughts that ran throughnher mind. Had Mr. Lawrence somehow prevented Frank from followingnthem? At the wharf she had been subconsciously aware that they werenbeing followed, was that Mr. Lawrence's doing? Had someone really been following Frank? Her mind took up the idea. If this was annasty trick on Mr. Lawrence's part, it was working, for that threatnhad been the excuse for keeping her inside and out of sight. Howncould Frank possibly find them. Worse still, what if he were hurt? nWho would help him? The longer she sat, anxiously waiting for Frank,nthe more desperate she became. Without warning, like a shot, Jaziranstood up and crossed the room to the door, threw it open and walkedninto the street, peering down the alley for any sign of her cowboy. nIn that instant, Mr. Lawrence and the officer rushed outside andnsurrounded her. She tried to look past them, but they literallynlifted her off her feet and brought her back into the office. It allnhappened so quickly that the scene only drew minimal attention fromnnatives moving along the street, but as Mr. Lawrence closed the door,nhe saw a man standing alongside the building across the alley,npartially concealed by the shadow of the porch canopy. Mr. Lawrencenwas only able to glimpse the face, but immediately recognized it asnthe same man who had followed them from the ship. He turned to hisnofficer and said, \"He'snout there. He saw her.\" Thenofficer asked, \"The man from the ship?\" Mr.nLawrence ordered, \"Get one of your men to ride into Rashid to findnHasani, tell him to meet us at the camp the day after tomorrow. Sendnanother to get our Bedouin camp set up outside of Rashid.\" Thenofficer left to carry out his orders. Mr. Lawrence turned to Jazira.n He noted the suspicion in her eyes, the worry that sat in their darkncorners. He remained silent a moment, the clock ticking loudly innthe background. He made his voice kind as he put a hand on her arm, 'Indon't think you need to worry about Mr. Hopkins, Jazira. He seemsnlike a man well able to take care of himself. . .and you too for thatnmatter. That's why he's here in Arabia, you know. He doesn'tnthink that I will do a good enough job of looking out for you.\" nMr. Lawrence found a gracious smile and added, \"But you don'tnhave to prove him to be right, so soon.\" Jaziranlooked up at him and entreated, \"Why did he get separated from us? nI've promised to help you and I will, but I cannot move, I will notnbe able to do a thing until I know that Frank is all right. I simplyncannot go on, until I know. Look . . .\" Shenunfolded her hands and held them up before him, trembling. Mr.nLawrence looked at her with appreciation, but reflected that he hadnhis own affairs to look after. He steadied her asking, \"Jazira,ndo you know who would be following you? He was on the ship, so henmust have sailed out of New York with us.\" Jaziranfolded her arms once more across her waist and answered, \"No.\" Mr.nLawrence asked, \"Did you talk with anyone in New York, other thannMr. Hopkins and myself?\" \"No.n. .no one except a gentleman with the shipping line. He was fromnAmerica.\" \"Andnwhat did he say?\" Mr. Lawrence quizzed. \"Hensaid he was a clerk and asked if I needed any assistance purchasingntickets to Arabia.\" Mr.nLawrence mulled this over trying to piece the puzzle together. nSuddenly the door swung open and Frank Hopkins filled the door frame.[Chapter 19] Impossible!n Was Mr. Lawrence's first thought when he saw Frank, whose jaw wasnred and swelling and a dark blue bruise beginning to shade hisnprominent left cheekbone, standing in the doorway. Mr. Lawrence wasnstill contemplating how Mr. Hopkins had been able to find them asnJazira rushed to the cowboy's side asking with concern, \"Frank,nyour face! What happened? Are you all right?\" Franknglanced over to Mr. Lawrence, aware that the man was not particularlynglad to see him and responded, \"I'm fine, just met up with thenwrong person, that's all.\" Jaziranlooked back at Mr. Lawrence with suspicion, but he was distracted bynthe sudden realization there was someone standing silently behind ofnFrank. Frank followed his gaze and said, \"Andnthen I met this man. . .\" Frank stepped aside to let the professorninto the room. Mr. Lawrence stared at him a moment trying tonunderstand why that face looked so familiar. Jazira looked at thenolder man in wonder then said happily, \"Yes,nI passed you one evening on the ship. We spoke.\" Thenprofessor put out a polite hand and said, \"I am very impressed thatnyou would remember such a slight occurrence. I am very pleased tonmeet you once again. Thanks to my young friend here, I know who younare, but let me introduce myself. . .\"and he paused and lookedntauntingly at Mr. Lawrence. Then looking at Jazira once more said,n\"I am William Ward.\" \"ProfessornWard\" breathed Mr. Lawrence, his face unable to hide his completendiscomfort. ProfessornWard smiled and extended a d hand to the diplomat saying, \"Good tonsee you again, Lawrence.\" Mr.nLawrence shook the hand reluctantly, causing the professor's eyesnto shine with more humor as he amended, \"Or should I saynfortuitous?\" Jaziranwas content to be embraced in the crook of Frank's arm as they bothnwatched the scene unfold. Mr.nLawrence questioned, \"Fortuitous for Mr. Hopkins, or for you?\" Thenprofessor stretched his arms out in front of him answered broadly,n\"For both of us, of course.\" Mr.nLawrence ended the game saying, \"Well, we were just on our way outnto find lodging for the evening.\" ProfessornWard broke in, \"Excellent! Mr. Hopkins and I will go along withnyou.\" Mr.nLawrence proved true to form replying, \"I believe Mr. Hopkins knowsnthe conditions of his involvement with official affairs.\" Jaziranlooked up at Frank asking softly, \"Conditions?\" ProfessornWard maintained his jovial smile as he said with great implication,n\"Of course, I don't make history, I just write it.\" Mr.nLawrence turned red and sputtered, \"Naturally, for you it isndifferent. You are British and. . .\" ProfessornWard interrupted and spread a gallant hand out in the direction ofnFrank saying, \"And perhaps I forgot to mention, Mr. Hopkins and Inare traveling together. Isn't that so, Mr. Hopkins?\" Franknwinked, \"It's a sure thing.\" Mr.nLawrence muttered something inaudible under his breath then saidnscornfully, \"Well, won't that be jolly good fun, to be allncrammed into the same room together?\" ProfessornWard turned and looked at Frank who was grinning at Jazira who smilednshyly up at him. The Professor smiled to himself and said, \"Inthink we will manage.\" Mr.nLawrence felt his control of the situation swiftly slipping from hisngrasp. Seeing Frank and Jazira in an embrace, flirting with onenanother, this late into his mission had not been in Mr. Lawrence'snagenda. The situation had to be remedied and quickly or the wholenoperation could fail. He would simply have to try another approach,nphysical separation was only one method, and one that apparently wasnnot working. An idea came into his head, something the nimble mindednProfessor could find no fault with, and yet it would serve Mr.nLawrence's interests. With a noticeable difference in his voice,nMr. Lawrence spoke up, \"Rightnthen, Professor, I will let you and Mr. Hopkins go along with thenclerk here and find suitable accommodations. Miss Riyadh and myselfnhave some business to conduct in the marketplace before we leave fornNajd.\" Franknwas alert right away, his playful manner vanished, and he looked overnto Professor Ward whose experienced eyes showed their doubt as hensaid, \"Wenfind no fault with that, provided we meet one another after ournventures are completed.\" Mr.nLawrence now smiled as he said smoothly, \"Of course, let's meetnback at the office before the evening call to prayer.\" Thenspirit in Jazira's eyes suddenly dampened and Frank unconsciouslynpulled her closer to him even as he realized there was nothing hencould challenge in Mr. Lawrence's proposal. ProfessornWard said after a pause, \"Very well.\" Mr.nLawrence clapped his hands together in finality, \"Agreed! Then wenbest be going, Miss Riyadh.\" Mr.nLawrence picked up his hat and stood impatiently at the door, asnJazira looked up at Frank with sadness in her eyes. There wasnsomething else in their ebony darkness, was it regret? But there wasnnot enough time for Frank to decipher it. Mr. Lawrence opened thendoor in an effort to speed thing up. Jazira took a step away fromnFrank and whispered fervently, \"Inlove you,\" as she moved towards Mr. Lawrence. There was somethingnshe was trying to tell him, it was in her eyes, what was it? Shenhad to turn and look at Mr. Lawrence who pointed suggestively at hernface. Jazira frowned and took the linen sash from around her waistnand wrapped it traditionally around her head then draped it acrossnthe lower portion of her face. She glanced back at Frank even as Mr.nLawrence took her by the elbow. He checked the street for caution'snsake. The man who had been following them earlier was no longer innsight. Mr. Lawrence then ushered Jazira into the street and shut thendoor behind him. As the door closed Frank's hands were on his hipsnas he said dramatically, \"Indon't trust that man.\" ProfessornWard stared at the plank door and said with dreadful calmness, \"Norndo I.\"[Chapter 20] Itnwas an easy agreement between Frank and Professor Ward, that theynshould obtain lodging as quickly as possible and then try to find Mr.nLawrence and Jazira in the marketplace. Mr. Lawrence's clerknaccompanied them, addressing several different proprietors, whosenapartments were already loaned out. It ended much the way Mr.nLawrence had predicted. After ascending a very narrow flight of mudnbrick steps adjoining one of the buildings they were shown a one roomndwelling with a small window too diminutive to allow fresh air andntoo high up to reach. The room had collected the heat from the daynand everyone mopped their faces. The young clerk spoke in Arabic tonthe proprietor and then turned to the men saying, \"Thisnis available for tonight only. He says he has family coming. Adennis very busy this time of year. This will no doubt be the bestnquarters we find available.\" Franknspoke up, \"We'll take it!\" Thenclerk turned to the eager proprietor and as he handed him severalncoins, the young man gestured towards the bare floor and then pointednto a corner of the room. The proprietor shook his head, causing thenclerk to hand him another coin. Then the man grinned and nodded. nThe clerk turned back to the men explaining, \"Well,nit is all arranged. You came out better than I expected you to. Henis going to provide some rugs and pillows for the floor for you tonsleep on, and he is going to partition off a corner of the room fornthe young lady traveling with Mr. Lawrence.\" Frankncorrected mildly, \"Traveling with us, the young lady is travelingnwith us.\" Thenclerk looked at the professor who said, \"If we want to see thenmarketplace, we should get started on our way. Thank you for yournhelp young man. If we see Mr. Lawrence in the market we will tellnhim how quickly you were able to make arrangements for all of us, andnhow economically too. Do you happen to know what direction he wasnheaded in?\" Thenclerk answered apologetically, \"No, I don't. But may I suggest,nthe market will be extremely busy this time of day, why not leavenyour horses at Mr. Lawrence's office. If I remember correctly, younare to meet him back there anyway.\" Afterntying up their horses in the courtyard beyond Mr. Lawrence'snoffice, Frank and Professor Ward walked towards the marketplace. Asnthey walked along the street Frank brought up a subject that had beennchurning in his mind, \"Younsaid earlier that you noticed Jazira was being followed, and bynsomeone who had been on the ship, did you mean he had been on thenship throughout the voyage, or that he came on board when we dockednin Aden?\" ProfessornWard smiled at the intelligent question and replied, \"I wasnwondering if you had remembered. As a professor I am used to payingnattention to detail. Did you notice Mr. Lawrence not only made yournyoung lady friend veil herself, but he checked the street as if henexpected someone to be standing outside the door?\" \"Younmean, he is aware she is being followed?\" Frank questioned. \"Well,nhe has a military background. He would have been trained to be verynalert to his surroundings. So I would say, yes, he is aware of it. nIn a city full of veiled women she will not be easy to find now. Thenonly mistake Mr. Lawrence has made, is that he is with her. Afternall, I believe that is the only way we will find her, is by spottingnhim first. But let me ask you, who would be looking for her?\" Frank'snforehead creased in worry as he responded, \"From New York? FromnEngland? No one that I am aware of, although there are people herenwho could make trouble for Jazira, if they knew she had returned tonArabia.\" ProfessornWard was quite serious as he remarked, \"Well, my friend FranknHopkins, I think you can assume that is exactly what will takenplace.\" Frankndid not reply as they rounded a corner onto the crowded thoroughfarenof the bustling market. There were stalls selling herbs, spices,nchicken, fish, breads, vegetables, bags of rice, coffee, nuts, honey,noils, brightly colored robes, ghutras, iquals, abbayas, carpets, andnrugs. For a moment the two men absorbed the sights and the noisynhaggling as they walked along, but as they passed stalls sellingnpottery, copper, brass, and jewelry Professor Ward began tellingnFrank of the superior quality of these Arabic treasures and theirntrue worth. They lingered at a stall where gold jewelry wasnperfectly positioned over black silk to catch the eyes and attentionnof passersby. Professor Ward dated some of the pieces telling Franknseveral deserved to be in a museum rather than sold on a commonnstreet. Frank found it all very interesting but as the professorntalked history, Frank's eyes darted along the alleyway looking fornany sign of Jazira or Mr. Lawrence. At last he was rewarded when hencaught sight of the English hat entering a building some distancendown the street. Fixing that position in mind, Frank walked awaynfrom the professor who realizing he had lost his audience followedncalling out, \"Mr.nHopkins, I don't think it is wise to get separated.\" Whennhe caught up with Frank, Frank was standing outside of annestablishment where a sign hung from a stave over the door, thenwriting in Arabic. Professor Ward joined him, his face flushed fromnhis brisk walk. He looked up at the sign and read it to himself thennturned to Frank, \"Arenyou sure you saw them go in here?\" Franknglanced at the Professor noting the perplexed expression in the oldernman's eyes. Then he glanced along the face of the building, allnthe other doors however had a porch of some form and he answerednfirmly, \"I'mnsure. This is the only one with a sign like this. Why, what is it?\" Thenprofessor scratched his head and looked reluctantly at Frank withndismay on his face, causing Frank to take a step towards the door. nProfessor War put out a restraining hand saying, \"Look!n Let me pop my head in, just to be certain, then I will explain whatntype of business this is, I promise.\" Franknwas becoming anxious with the professor's suspenseful manner, butnthe professor did just as he said and after poking his head in thenestablishment, he then quietly shut the door and walked back tonFrank. Professor Ward's eyes were downcast and the usually readynsmile was gone as he rubbed his chin. Frank uneasily shifted hisnweight. Finally the professor looked up and said with somenconfusion, \"Younwere right. I saw Mr. Lawrence sitting in the courtyard just beyondnthat door.\" He paused and shook his head as he continued, \"Incan't explain it, all I can do is tell you that this is antraditional business. I say traditional because it is the traditionnthat when a young woman is to become a bride, she often will have anwoman skilled in the ancient practice of body art, paint intricatendesigns on her skin. Naturally, it is temporary, the ink comes fromna medicinal plant. If you have never seen it before, the artistry isnquite astounding. . .\" Thenprofessor rambled on hoping his voice would have a calming affect asnhe noticed Frank's body stiffen, his jaw tighten, and his eyesnharden. Frank only heard the drone of the professor's voice, hisnmouth was suddenly very dry. He passed his tongue over his lips asnhe stared at that door. However, the professor's next words hitnhome when he said matter of factly, \"Traditionally,nit is the only time, that I am aware of, in which a young woman willnhave this service performed.\" Franknturned on his heels and walked away down the winding alleyway. Thenprofessor knew better than to follow him.[Chapter 21] \"Inwant to see her!\" he demanded in Arabic. \"No!n It is forbidden!\" replied the veiled but insistent shop keeper,nher little jeweled slipper stamping the ground for emphasis. \"IfnI do not see her, there is no sale!\" Mr. Lawrence stubbornlynresponded. Thenshop keeper's eyes narrowed furiously at him, then her eyes dartednaround, the street was not as busy as it had been before. Her eyesnsnapped back to the man and as she walked towards the little tent shenbarked, \"The English!\" Mr.nLawrence smirked then waited with arms crossed until the tent flapnparted and a vision of loveliness stood demurely away from him. Hisnarms fell to his side as he was enchanted by Jazira in her bridalnfinery. She was dressed in golden Damascus brocade embroidered withna twisting ruby floral pattern that enhanced her dark skin and ebonynhair, which was adorned with a headdress of tulle fitted with a bandnof dangling small coins that jingled in the light breeze. The sheernveil which covered her face only drew more attention to it, as wellnas the intriguing artwork that sinuously snaked in unique patternsndown either side of her neck, disappearing into the crepe collar ofnher dress. The artistry reappeared on the back of her hands whichnappeared even more feminine under the ruffled crepe cuffs of hernsleeves. Jazira refused to look at him, her head turned to the side,nshe looked at the ground and then at the shop attendant whonreappeared to face Mr. Lawrence. The Englishman however, could notnfind his voice for a moment then shook himself and said gruffly, \"Wrapnit up, it's perfect!\" AndnJazira's perfect, he thought as he turned away from the tent tonwait on the street. Perfect, for Hasani, of course. He could stillnsee her slender waist, encircled by the golden filigree ornamentsnthat jingled with even her slightest movement. Hasani would benthanking him, this visit to Arabia, and his loyalty to England wouldnbe secure. Thensun was beginning it's descent to meld with the horizon when thencall to prayer echoed throughout the marketplace and all of Aden. nMr. Lawrence's arms were full of carefully wrapped packages as henand Jazira walked in silence towards his office. It was time tondrive the wedge between Frank and Jazira for good, especially sincenProfessor Ward had wrangled up a spot in Mr. Lawrence's own caravannfor the cowboy to get to Najd. And while Mr. Lawrence did not mindnscuffing up his reputation in the Aden marketplace with a little shopnattendant, he did not want his name besmirched in the annals ofnEnglish history. Enough of the bridal artwork was visible onnJazira's neck and hands to cause Mr. Hopkins to ask what it allnmeant. Male instinct told Mr. Lawrence, Jazira would not be able tonfudge off another half truth. He could envision the whole scene andnwhatever version he foresaw, they all ended with Frank Hopkinsnleaving after discovering that his \"intended\" had opted to \"actnas a wife\" to another man, a man from her home territory, and thatnshe had kept it a secret from him. Why it was enough to drive anynman away. He smiled. Thenguilt Jazira felt was more oppressive than the veil covering hernface. It came crashing down on her as she dressed in her nativenbridal fashion. The dress she had dreamed of growing up, became annightmare when she put it on, because it was not for the man shenloved. The rest of the day she beat herself, why had she not toldnFrank the whole truth about her ticket into Rashid as the \"bride\"nof an Arab man, in league with the British. The body art thatntraveled sloped down her neck, over her shoulders and down her armsnwere mostly covered up by her thobe. But the back of her hands werenclearly visible. It was still very possible that Frank would notnnotice it, but after realizing how the whole truth would sound tonFrank now, how it would hurt him now, made Jazira's heart ache. nThe only way she could amend things to some extent was to tell Franknthe whole horrible business before he had a chance to ask her. Shenhurried down the street to Mr. Lawrence's office. When she reachednthe door and opened it, she saw Professor Ward and the same youngnclerk standing before a map on the wall in conversation. She smilednand looked around the room, Frank was not there. She looked back tonsee Professor Ward glancing at her and then at Mr. Lawrence as henwalked into the office and shut the door. The clerk came and removednthe packages from his arms. Jazira asked with concern, \"Wherenis Frank?\" Thenclerk stopped in mid stride then resumed walking out of the room andninto another. The Professor studied her a minute before answeringnwithout smiling, \"Inwouldn't know young lady, he separated earlier in the afternoon.\" Mr.nLawrence asked, \"You mean, he's not with you?\" ProfessornWard's expression showed what he thought of that question, which hendid not answer. Jazira sensed accusation in Professor Ward's looknand tone and she asked earnestly, \"Didnhe say where he was going?\" \"Morenimportantly, did either of you find lodging this afternoon?\"ninterjected Mr. Lawrence. ButnProfessor Ward only answered Jazira, with some bite in his voice,n\"No, he didn't say. We were standing outside of the bridalnartist's establishment, he had seen Mr. Lawrence going inside andnhe asked what type of shop it was, and I of course, told him thentruth.\" Jaziranfelt as though she had stabbed in heart, and she clutched her chest. nMr. Lawrence on the other hand found it decidedly hard to keep fromnclapping his hands together jubilantly, things were working outnbetter than he had planned. Excess energy must have shown on hisnface since Professor Ward was looking intently at him. Fortunatelynthe clerk re-entered the office saying, \"Somendinner is being served in the courtyard. There is roast meat, ricenand coffee. Perhaps not up to your taste, Miss, but adequatelynfilling.\" Thenclerk led the way in direction of the courtyard, and Mr. Lawrencenextended an arm inviting Jazira to pass in front of him. When thendoor swung open, Jazira felt relief upon seeing Frank's mustangnstill tied up near her stallion. Wherever he was he had not gone sonvery far away. . . Ornso she had thought. Tucked away from the sight of Mr. Lawrence andnProfessor Ward in the curtained corner of the one room apartment,nthere had still been no sign of Frank and it had been dark now fornseveral hours. Jazira felt hopelessly detached from hernsurroundings, and from the world itself. Little mattered to her,nincluding the mission she had sacrificed too much for. She would seenit through, of course, she was a woman of her word, but suddenly itnand everything else had lost it's shine. As she lay in hernsleeveless shift curled up under a thin woolen blanket on the largenpillow mat, she felt entirely alone, much like she had when hernfather passed away. The dull ache was reborn and now multiplied. nShe could lay on this mat for an eternity, she could sleep for anneternity, it hardly mattered now. Frank was gone. She had notntrusted him, perhaps he would have understood about the \"marriage\",nbut even now she doubted it. Frank didn't understand her need tonhelp Mr. Lawrence's daughter, it was like rescuing herself. It wasnmaking her own choices, of coming back to Arabia as a free woman, thenway she had been created. Only now, what did it matter? What wasnfreedom without love? She had never hungered for freedom until shenmet Frank. She had dreamed of it, wanted it, but never before hadnshe craved it, worked for it, sacrificed for it, fought for it. Thenbelief that Frank Hopkins could love her, did love her, made freedomnimportant and necessary. Her mind repeated--Frank is gone. Jazirandidn't cry, she couldn't, she was too numb. And despite thenbright moonlight that had found it's way into her corner of thenroom through that impossible window, she drifted into a nightmarishnsleep.[Chapter 22] Henhad not planned to stay there as long as he had, perched on the flatnroof under the enormous disk of the moon getting a new perspective ofnAden and of life. There had been much to consider after he hadnwalked away from the professor in the marketplace. He needed to benalone, to lick his wounds, and he appreciated now that his lack ofnArabic had prevented him from further danger, the only thing he couldnfind to drink was coffee, and he drank an abundance of it, rehashingnthe entirety of his relationship with Jazira. It all lead him to onenconclusion, there had been no problem, no gulf that could not benbridged between Jazira and himself, until Mr. Lawrence entered theirnlives. It had all started in the cargo hold on that passage tonAmerica and from that point forward there had been trouble betweennthe two of them, and Frank saw something else too. He had a knacknfor sensing his own faults, and it served him well once more. Whynhad he not treated or courted Jazira as he would have an Americannwoman? He had argued that she wouldn't have wanted that formalntreatment, but all the same, Frank knew he had not even tried, he hadntaken her affection for granted. And after their first disagreement,nhe had dropped the subject of marriage altogether. Of course thatnwas still his vision--Jazira, the ranch in Missouri. So, what was henwaiting for? With caffeine induced reflection, he realized he wasnwaiting for her to leave him, because what was there to stay for? nFortunately an image popped into his mind. There he was in the GreatnRace, on Hidalgo, at the starting line, looking for a reason to keepnpushing on, an image to carry with him to the end of the race or thenend of his life, wherever it took him. He had looked over hisnshoulder, and there she was, believing in him even when he did notnbelieve in himself. And she had seen him previously at one of hisnlowest points, his weakest self, and still she believed in him. Shentruly saw him, when others did not. So why, when he was so close tonhaving that one person in his life for good, why had he purposefullynbacked away? He had followed her to Arabia, but he had abandoned thenidea of a committed relationship at the first sign of trouble. Henhad never sealed an engagement with her. No woman who was loved,ndeserved less. Not to mention, he really didn't understand what hensaw at the bridal artist shop. He had reacted merely on assumption. nFrank drained another cup of coffee and reviewed the facts. They allnconclusively pointed to the fact that Jazira loved hm, and he lovednher, and they needed to be together for the rest of their lives. AndnFrank needed to do something about it, to make that possible. Henhad wandered back through the marketplace, but without findingnJazira, the professor, or Mr. Lawrence. As he passed along,nobserving the overly meek native women gave Frank a new appreciationnfor the strong willed woman that was Jazira. When the call to prayernechoed around him, Frank was struck with an idea, and he followednthat instead of meeting up with the group at Mr. Lawrence's office.n It was time he took control of his circumstances. Itnwas dark when Frank reached the office to find it deserted for thenevening. He walked to the building where they had found lodgingnearlier in the day, but completely unsettled due to all the coffeenearlier in the day, he climbed up to the roof to gather his thoughtsnbefore joining everyone else. The roof gave him the solace of annArabian night, and enabled him to see his course clearly. Finally,nhe was ready. He stood up, felt his shirt pocket, smiled, andnlowered himself carefully off the roof and onto the top step leadingndown to the door separating him from Jazira and the others. He triednthe lever, glad it was unlocked, perhaps they had been expecting him,nand stepped into the still, dark room. Frank was aware that Mr.nLawrence sat up from his corner of the room, not realizing that hisncowboy hat had saved him from getting shot. There was movement fromnthe professor as well, but Frank never saw that the historian had hisnweapon out as well, only aimed at the other man. Only that curtainedncorner mattered to Frank, he knew that was where Jazira lay. Innseveral long strides he reached the linen drape, pulled it back andnstepped inside it's enclosure. Lying at his feet, Jazira wasncurled up in a blanket, in a shaft of moonlight. Frank's lipsnparted, he took a deep breath then dropped to his knees beside her. nHer hair concealed her face from his view and he gingerly placed anhand on her shoulder. She stirred and he leaned close to hernwhispering hoarsely, \"Jazira.\" Evennin her drowsiness there was excitement in her voice, \"Frank?\" nThe blanket was off immediately and she raised up, her dark hairntumbling over his shoulders and bare arms. Frank had never seen sonmuch of her skin before, and his eyes were drawn to the designsntrailing down her shoulders and arms, the path up to her neck. Henfelt his skin tingle. She looked at him as they both sat up andnfaced one another. She exclaimed in a whisper, \"Frank! You'renhere! I thought. . .I didn't know what had happened. . .\" Shensaw his eyes on her shoulders and arms and rushed on, \"I was goingnto tell you, I should have told you earlier, but I was scared. I wasnscared it would make us grow further apart from one another, whennalready we were. . .\" Franknwas listening, but it was Jazira who stopped speaking and took hisnface in her hands and kissed him. Frank collected her in his armsnand then remembered. He pulled back a moment. Worry tracked acrossnJazira's eyes and Frank said, \"It'snnot you or me that's doing it--dividing us, pulling us apart, it'snhim, it's Mr. Lawrence.\" Jaziranwas taken aback and she whispered urgently, \"What? I don'tnunderstand?\" Frankntook her hands in his and replied just as at once, \"Trust me. Worknwith him, help him, find his daughter, but. . .don't trust him.\" nHe took from his shirt pocket, the ring purchased earlier from thenmarketplace and slid it on her finger saying, \"I don't know whatnhis plans are for you and . . .\" \"Hasani,\"nJazira supplied and explained, \"That is the only plausible way Incan enter the city and join the circle of women there, is to go asnhis bride. It is in name only, nothing more.\" Realizationnwashed over Frank, providing a little relief. He held her hand,nadmiring the ring on her finger. However, her eyes were still lockednon his trying to interpret his feelings, as his eyes met hers again,nFrank said, \"InnAmerica a ring like this, worn on this hand, on this fingernrepresents two people who belong to one another. Will you wearnmine?\" Jaziranlooked at her hand quickly then back at Frank asking, \"This is hownit is done in America?\" She felt a chill of excitement andnshivered. Frank'sneyes traveled from her hand up her bare arm and he reached his strongnyet gentle hand to her shoulder and asked as he gazed at the delicatenartwork on her skin, \"You'rencold?\" Hencouldn't have been further off the mark, Jazira thought and shenreplied breathlessly, \"No. . .\" And recognizing she had notnanswered his previous question amended, \"I mean, yes, I will wearnthe ring, it will never leave my finger, but. . .no, I'm not cold.\" Franknmesmerized by the design on her skin, traced it with his forefinger,nsaying in a daze, \"Cold in Arabia? It was a crazy question.\" Thenmagic between them shattered with Mr. Lawrence's voice, \"Jazira,nwe have an early start in the morning. You'll need your rest.\" \"Leaventhem alone,\" grumbled the professor from the other corner of thenroom. Franknand Jazira grinned at one another, but Frank's hand dropped to hisnside as he said, \"Inwon't be traveling with you to the Najd. Someone has beennfollowing you, the professor saw him. So, I'm going to hang backnand keep a low profile. Maybe there'll be a way to flush him out. nBut don't worry, I won't be far away.\" Jazirannodded, already feeling insecure just knowing Frank would not be withnher on the trip. Frank added looking through the curtain where Mr.nLawrence was bedded down, \"Besides,nwe wouldn't have a moment together anyway, with him around. I'llnbe more useful this way. Trust me.\" Jazirantook his hands, \"I do.\" Franknnodded, pulled her to him, kissed her warmly, then stood up to leave.n Jazira self consciously pulled the blanket around her once more,nthen stood up and embraced Frank saying wistfully, \"Incan't wait until this is all over, and we can go home.\" Franknwhispered in her ear, \"That's makes two of us, Princess.\"[Chapter 23] Going home, that was the image Frank Hopkins carried in his mind as he traveled across the lonely desert sands to Najid with only his shadow riding beside him across the constantly shifting landscape. Frank had spun the picture with such detail that he could see it as clearly as he could see the trailing footpaths of his companions, the Professor, Mr. Lawrence, and Jazira, who had traveled ahead of him hours earlier. Their tracks had become so familiar they had become a single print, parts of a whole pattern in the sand, and the seemingly endless continuity allowed Frank▓s mind the freedom to formulate with even greater clarity the sum reason of why he and Jazira were back in Arabia. How they had become involved with Mr. Lawrence, why the Professor had engaged himself so readily to their meager band, and above all else, Frank▓s own unsettling sensations that deeper, darker forces were at work. Ever since returning to Arabia, Frank was consumed with a dreadful sense of foreboding, it was a feeling unique only to one other time in his life, a day that had taken years to redefine and rehabilitate from, the day he had delivered that fateful telegram, the day that had ended with his people being massacred. All the whiskey in the world could never wash away the memory of that day, nor the memory Frank had, the very same sensation he could not ignore now, that death hung in the air, like those heavy morning fogs that hover close to the ground fighting to relinquish one breath of space to the sun. ","Summary":" Concealednin shadows cast by the mid-day sun, the gentleman observed thentouching scene along the s"},{"Movie":"Becoming Jane","Title":"Becoming Jane:  A Love Lost and Found","Author":"Jamesyboy'sStarGazer","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6732080","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hello, as I have stated in my profile page, my story, \"Becoming Jane: A Love Lost and Found\" is a continuation of the movie which is one of my favourites. For those who have watched the movie, you know how they depict Jane and Tom as being ...a bit \"older\" at the end when they meet each other again. However in reality, Jane died in July of 1817 at the age of 41 and was fell sick with the illness which eventually ended her life in the spring of 1816 and would not have been well enough to be taking in recitals with Henry and Eliza during that time, so in my own mind she would not, could not have been older than 39 years old had they really met again for the last time. I am trying to keep my story as close to reality as possible, so for that reason, Tom and Jane are 39 years old when they meet at the end of the movie/beginning of my story. Also, I usually write my stories in the 3rd person point of view, but I decided that I really wanted to write this story from not just one, but two points of view, both Tom's and Jane'. As they are both in most chapters and scenes together, there will be an overlapping or repetition of dialogue in Tom's POV. I have tried to keep it down, but it's not always easy to and I felt it would not sound right if I left out all of their dialogue in his part, so please bear with it but make sure that you do read Tom's POV, even if you choose to skim over the repeted dialouge. Thanks and I hope you enjoy! Sue[Chapter 2] LONDON (Summer, 1815) CHAPTER 1: (Jane) I recognized him the moment my eyes chanced to fall upon him, as he stood at the entrance way of the building where Henry, Eliza and myself had been enjoying a recital by a famous lady of the opera before he turned and quickly left. Yes, even if it had been 17 years since I had left him standing outside the Inn where we had waited for a stage to continue us on our journey-and subsequently parted ways-while I caught the very next stagecoach back home, I would know him anywhere, my beloved Tom. I wondered at that moment that he had turned away to leave if he had seen me...seen me noticing him. Was that why he left? And in such a hurry? I was rendered speechless by the realization that he was there! What was he doing in London? Why wasn't he in Ireland? I couldn't help but wonder. We ourselves were in London regarding the printing of my book \"Emma\" and the reprinting of \"Mansfield Park\", which was now taken care of. I glanced quickly at both Eliza and Henry who also apparently had noticed Tom for they too looked at one another and then at myself. Before I found my voice and could say anything, Henry had left us...I knew instantly that he was going after Tom. \"I'll never forgive him..\" I remarked to Eliza in a low voice. \"Of course you will. We always forgive him for everything.\" she replied. It wasn't long before I saw my brother return to us with Tom. \"Jane...\" he said. \"An old friend...\" So many emotions had run through me during this entire time upon first seeing Tom, from the blissful happiness I had felt when we first met and the time we had spent together, to the pain of having to part from him, to the elation I was feeling at seeing him again, to the...fear of inevitably being parted from him...again. I didn't want to go through that all over again. I hardly knew what to say. Looking up at Tom now, he was still as handsome as he ever was...even moreso if that was at all possible. I felt...confused. Why should we meet NOW? After all of these years? Why at all? I would have probably been better off remaining ignorant of his being there in London. These were the thoughts that were running through my mind as Eliza and myself bowed to Tom in acknowledgement and he returned the bow. \"My daughter...Miss Lefroy.\" Tom now introduced us to a young girl either in her early teens or very near, was my guess. How was it that I hadn't even noticed her? She was lovely, I thought feeling rather envious that she was not mine and Tom's daughter, but the product of the love between Tom and another... But then I knew...had known from our good friend and neighbour whom I adored, Mrs. Anne Lefroy, Tom's aunt and whom he had stayed with when we first met, that Tom now had 7 children. I had never, ever asked her for any information regarding Tom after we had parted, as it too painful for me. And I know that she spared me any news of him as much as she could, knowing how painful our inevitable break up had been for me. However, news has a way of slipping out and over the years I had learned of both Tom's marriage and his eventual seven children. In thinking about all of this, I had missed part of what young Miss Lefroy had been asking of me, but I had caught the gist of it. She was asking if I would do a reading.. \"Jane!\" suddenly Tom's voice spoke out rather abruptly. I stared at him momentarily stunned, at first thinking that he had been addressing me, but then a sudden realization dawned on me that it was his daughter he was talking to. I continued to stare at Tom and he looked back at me. Did I dare hope that he had actually named his daughter after me? But then, the name 'Jane' is a very common name. I didn't want to assume that of him...and his wife...YET... Henry was explaining the situation to young Miss Lefroy about me wanting to remain anonymous when suddenly, I felt the urge to do whatever I could to please Tom...but most especially, his daughter. \"I will for my new friend if she wishes it. Come sit by me.\" And with that, I took her hand into mine and lead into the next room, placing her beside myself as we sat down, I opened the book and began to read... I concentrated as best as I could, but my mind would not let me forget the fact that Tom was there...listening to me. At one point, the memory of another reading I had done...another one which Tom had also been at...quickly I brought my thoughts back to the present lest I lose myself in the past and stumble over a passage. When I finished my reading, I closed the book, laid my hands upon it and only then did I allow myself to look up at Tom again, curious to see if was able to stay awake this time. What I saw was Tom gazing right back at me with a hint of a smile on his lips and clapping along with the audience, this time with genuine sincerity which took my breath away. While he was clapping, I couldn't help but notice his wedding ring. I allowed myself a small smile in return. (Tom) They say that you never forget your first REAL love... No one was more shocked than myself when walking down the street in London towards my carriage after enjoying a lunch with my eldest daughter Jane, I happened to see them. I was so surprised that I literally stopped in my tracks and stared at them wondering if I were dreaming. I don't know if I can describe the range of emotions I felt in those first seconds I saw her...I had learned from my Aunt Anne Lefroy that she had never married...and ever since...I had wondered about that. Did I dare even think or believe that the reason she never married was because...because of me? But how could I be so arrogant and selfish to assume that...surely there had been other men for her...? They continued coming towards us and eventually, we would all meet..what would I say, after all of these years, I wondered...I say \"they\" but my eyes were really only fixed upon one and only one in particular. No matter how much time had passed, I knew I would never forget her...could never forget her no matter how many years would pass...no matter how old we would grow.. I prepared myself for the inevitable reunion when the three of them made an abrupt turn and walked towards one of the buildings. They hadn't even seen me...without even thinking, I pulled my eldest daughter along with me towards the very building I had seen them enter. \"Where are we going father?\" She asked me. Where were we going? Good question as I hadn't a clue as to what was in that building Henry, Eliza and Jane had just entered, but we were about to find out as I felt compelled to follow. \"A surprise.\" I replied \"What kind of surprise?\" \"Well if I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise now would it?\" This reply helped her to hold her tongue. We climbed the stairs and went into the building but didn't go very far inside. We were soon to find out that there was a singing recital going on. I found us two seats near the doorway but I didn't really listen to the music. I gave my full attention to searching amongst the audience faces for Jane's. At last I spotter her. But I knew she would never notice me, where she was and where we were. I was in agony. I longed, practically willed her to just glance over my way...but she never did. When at last the recital was over and my daughter Jane and I stood up, I had momentarily taken my eyes off of where Jane, Henry and Eliza had been sitting. I looked back to find that they too had also stood up and I momentarily lost sight of them. I moved towards where they had been and then...I saw them again much to my relief. I noticed a young woman also approaching the trio, so I stopped where I was and strained to hear her...something about if she was the Jane Austen, author of Pride and Prejudice. My aunt Anne had also informed me of Jane's book Pride and Prejudice and of it's success. I won't lie, I had quietly swelled with pride for her when I had learned of that...Jane, and her accomplishment with her book. In fact, once I knew about the book, I had to go and buy it...for my oldest daughter of course...was my excuse. I actually had planned to read it myself. And without my family ever finding out...I did just that. And what I read...rather astounded me... But I was not thinking about that just now and when I heard Henry tell the young woman that Jane was trying to remain anonymous. Those words hit me just then. Things had changed in 17 years. Jane could now claim to be an author...a bit of a famous one at that. To the point that people off of the street-in a manner of speaking-recognized her. And Henry was there to shield her from her \"fans\". That's how famous she was becoming. And I was sure it was just the beginning for her. What then, was I doing there...now...after all of these years. She had moved on with her life, doing exactly what she had said she would do, making a living by her pen. She didn't need me...I also realized that I was suddenly afraid...afraid of rejection... As my daughter Jane and I had been standing by door when I came to this decision, I looked back over at Jane one last time before leaving her forever. I just wanted to take a mental picture of her with me when I left this time, for good. But something happened that I did not count on. This time she saw me...just as I was ready to leave, Jane happened to look over at me. At first I was rooted to the spot, but I knew if I was going to leave, I had to do it now, because perhaps she hadn't seen me after all. You know, like when you look at someone or something but don't actually see it? I thought that it was possible that she hadn't really seen me after all. I quickly turned and left the building with my daughter, hurried down the stairs and back onto the sidewalk heading towards our goal in the first place, before I had seen Henry, Eliza and Jane, which was my carriage to take us back over to my law office and abode. Then...I heard it... \"Lefroy!\" It was un-mistakenly, Henry's voice. \"Lefroy! WAIT!\" He called out again. \"Father, someone is calling you! Don't you hear him? He wants you to stop!\" Jane stopped here and I had no choice but to stop as well. I knew I had to allow Henry to catch up with us. \"Lefroy!\" Henry cried out once more as he approached us. Turning, I smiled. \"Henry..it's been a long time.\" \"Indeed it has!\" He agreed with a grin. \"This is my eldest daughter, Miss Jane Lefroy. Jane...this is an old friend...Mr. Henry Austen...\" I introduced the two. My daughter curtsied politely while Henry politely took her hand and smiled at her. \"And there are a couple more old friends whom I am sure would also love to see you...and meet your charming young daughter.\" Henry said giving me a small wink. I understood that wink. Something told me that I should protest...make an excuse...but...I couldn't. Truthfully, I didn't want to. Something had awakened in me...come alive again when I first saw her. I needed to see her...no, I had already seen her, I needed to talk to her again as well. I only realized in that moment, just how much I wanted to talk to her again. I allowed Henry to lead us back into the building from which we had just vacated and easily lead us over to where Eliza and Jane were waiting.. \"Jane...an old friend..\" Was how Henry re-introduced us. Jane and Eliza bowed politely and I returned it. \"My daughter, Miss Lefroy.\" I now introduced the three females. My daughter, having managed to put together \"Henry Austen\" and Henry's addressing his sister, \"Jane\" had come up with the right combination. \"Your Miss Jane Austen?\" she asked eagerly. \"Would you do a reading for us?\" \"Jane!\" I admonished her lightly for having spoken without being spoken too or requested to. I didn't want them to think I had raised my daughter to have bad manners. I noticed now how Jane had looked at me rather surprised. It was true...I had encouraged my wife to name our first born girl \"Jane\" although I had never told her why...that Jane was still very strongly in my heart at the time. After all, we had almost been married. The day she left me and returned home by stagecoach had been very painful for me and had remained a painful memory, even after I had married. Eventually however, time did have a way of alleviating the pain. After Jane had left me, I had returned home and hastily married the woman I had been engaged to before I had returned to Jane. Our first child was born before we celebrated our first wedding anniversary, it was a boy. I had found myself really hoping for a girl so that she could be called Jane. I won't say that I was disappointed that I had a son, every man wants a son, every man wants his first born child to be a son. I love my son...was very proud of my son. But my heart would not let go of the idea of having a girl that we could name Jane. I would have to wait for just over two years before I would have the daughter I wanted and as another Jane was still very much in my heart when she was born, I still insisted on naming her Jane. She had to be named \"Jane\" for this way, I would be able to lose myself in my love for another \"Jane\"...one who would never leave me...one who would always be a part of me and my life...my daughter. And thankfully, my wife held no objections with the name for her own mother was named Jane, Lady Jane Paul. It goes without saying that she was quite pleased that I had insisted on our daughter also being named Jane...and I allowed my wife to believe that we had named her after her mother. I understood why Jane had left...I knew she was hurting as much as I was, but we both also knew deep down that life for us would have been very difficult had we gone ahead with the marriage. Suddenly Jane spoke..it was the first I had heard her voice in a very long time. What she said, touched my heart considerably. \"I will for my new friend if she wishes it. Come sit by me.\" She then took my daughter by the hand and lead her into the next room, placing her beside herself and after they were seated, Jane opened the book and began to read... This time, Jane had my full attention as I hung onto every word she spoke. I was mesmerized by the soft, flowing cadence of her voice. She could go on forever and I would never tire of listening to her..all too soon she came to the end, closed her book and gently placed her hands upon it. Slowly she looked up at me and I looked down at her..I couldn't help but smile. I realized that the audience was clapping and I too joined in. She smiled back at me. I couldn't let her go now. Not this time.[Chapter 3] CHAPTER 2: (Jane) People now began to approach me, complimenting me on both my reading and my \"Pride and Prejudice\" book, breaking the eye contact that had been held between Tom and myself, thus separating us. I stood up to politely address my \"well-wishers\" who kept me fairly busy for awhile as I didn't want to appear rude or impolite and leave anybody out. But because of this, I was unable to keep my eye on Tom. When there was finally a lull in the people who had surrounded me, I glanced about to see that Tom and his daughter were no longer around. So they had left then. A wave of bitter disappointment came over and threatened to envelope me, but I stubbornly pushed it away. I would not allow it to happen. After all, Tom is a married man...a married man with a family. If it hadn't been for Henry going after him and bringing him back...if I hadn't even noticed him at the entrance way of the building to begin with...I stopped my thoughts right here and once again brought them back to the present. I noticed the over all crowd in the room was beginning to thin and people had stopped coming up to me. It was now that I realized as I scanned the remaining faces in the room that Henry and Eliza were also missing. At least, they weren't where I could see them. I know they wouldn't have left without me. Moving about the room, I suddenly spotted them and started going towards them. As I approached my heart skipped a beat as I now saw that Tom had not left after all, but had been visiting with Henry and Eliza whilst they waited for me. I didn't realize that I had stopped walking upon noticing him, but apparently, I had. I felt rooted to the spot, my emotions coming to a head once again. I both desperately wanted to talk with Tom...BUT...I knew if I did that I would regret it because even after all of these years my feelings for him were there as strong as they ever were. Of that, there is no doubt as I now realized since first seeing him. And if it had been wrong of us to try and \"elope\", then it was even worse that I should have these feelings for him when he was married...married AND had a family-I find I am constantly reminding myself of. NO...I should NOT talk to him at all then... But suddenly the four of them, seeing that I was no longer engaged, moved towards me. I had no choice now, I would have to face him, talk with him. \"Jane, at last you are free!\" my brother Henry called out. Before I could make a reply, Henry went on. \"It might interest you to know dear sister, that our Mr. Lefroy has become quite a successful lawyer.\" Actually, I had known that...one of those \"news items\" that floated around our area, courtesy of our friends, the Lefroys. But because I knew the situation between us had not changed and could not go any further, I started to steel any feelings I had for him, against him. I also had some pride and I refused to let him believe that I knew of this, lest he came to the wrong conclusion that I would always ask after him to his aunt and uncle. (Surely though, Anne wouldn't allow him to believe that?). I opened my eyes wide as I feigned my surprise. \"How wonderful for you Mr. Lefroy!\" I thought that Tom almost seemed embarrassed by my statement. \"I think the two of you have some catching up to do. Eliza and myself will take charge of your young Jane Tom, while you visit. That is...if it is alright with you Tom...oh and of course Miss Lefroy.\" This time my surprise was genuine...I was too surprised to say anything at first and when I finally thought I could, it was already agreed upon by the rest and the three of them started walking away. I shot daggers from my eyes into the retreating backs of my brother and sister-in-law cousin. How DARE they leave me alone with Tom! They should know better! \"Miss Austen...\" I heard Tom's voice address me very gently. I felt a surge of emotions. Then even more quietly, \"Jane...\" I closed my eyes, swallowed and finally turned around to face Tom alone. (Tom) A throng of people started converging upon Jane after she had finished her reading, breaking our 'connection'. I elected to quietly move out of the way and took my daughter Jane with me. Henry and Eliza had also done the same thing. Henry beckoned for us to join them and we obeyed. As soon as we reached them, Eliza immediately took Jane under her wing and moved slightly away from us, engaging my daughter in conversation. I had the feeling that Henry had asked Eliza to keep Jane occupied so that he could talk to me. I was about to find out that I wasn't wrong. \"I sense that you still have feelings for my sister, Lefroy.\" he said in a low voice and not in an overly kind tone. I didn't deny it. \"And I could see that she still very much has feelings for you.\" he continued when I didn't answer. \"I thought that enough time would have passed. I thought the two of you would have liked to meet each other again after all of these years as friends. But perhaps it was wrong of me to have gone after you and bring you back here after all. I don't know what kind of game you are playing with my sister Lefroy, but it's not right that you encourage her when you yourself are unavailable!\" I stood tall, looked Henry straight in his eyes and replied firmly. \"I assure you Mr. Austen, that I play NO game with your sister. I will not lie and deny my feelings for her. And I can only HOPE and PRAY that you are right about her feelings for me!\" I could tell that my reply had taken Henry by surprise as he said nothing, so I took advantage of his silence to fill him in on the situation I was currently in... When I had finished, Henry said more calmly, \"Tom...I hope you can forgive me. I just...well you never saw what your break up did to Jane. I had never seen her so down before. She was not herself for such a long time. Oh, she put up a brave front for everyone and most especially in public, but we...her family could tell. It took her a long time to get over you and come back around to being herself again. I just want to protect her...to make sure that she doesn't go through that again.\" My heart ached for my Jane at those words. As painful as it was for myself as well, at least I had been able to lose myself in my marriage...the birth of my first child and then my second one, my \"long awaited\" daughter (and the rest that followed) and my career. In comparison, Jane had had...nothing. No one, outside her family and friends that is. \"Of course Henry. I completely understand that.\" I agreed. I now ventured to ask. \"Did...did she have any other suitors?\" \"Yes...\" Henry replied, \"Eventually there were a couple more, one even looked promising, but nothing ever came of them.\" I didn't know what to say to that. Henry called Eliza and Jane back over to us now. Quietly, Henry took Eliza aside and spoke in a low tone to her. I knew he was explaining things to her. Once he had finished, she came back over to me, with both hands reaching out for mine. I held mine out and allowed her to place hers in my hands. \"Tom...\" was all she said and then taking me by surprise, she placed a gentle kiss upon one of my cheeks, then smiled at me. \"So tell us about yourself Tom. Did you ever pass the bar?\" Henry was now asking me. I filled them in on what had transpired since I last saw them...how I had not only passed the bar but had started a practice as a lawyer in Ireland where I had become quite successful. They both expressed their pleasure in my success. As we had been talking, I noticed Jane coming towards us and then abruptly stop. She seemed no longer be occupied with fans. Henry had also noticed her about the same time I did. I dearly wanted the chance to talk with her alone. I wondered when I would get that chance. \"Jane, at last you are free!\" Henry called to her. \"It might interest you to know dear sister, that our Mr. Lefroy has become quite a successful lawyer.\" Even though it was true, for some reason, Henry's words rather embarrassed me. Maybe because it made me sound arrogant or something. But also, as successful career-wise as I was, it wasn't everything to me and I didn't want Jane to think that it was. Then when Jane spoke up, \"How wonderful for you Mr. Lefroy!\" That didn't help my embarrassment. Suddenly I heard Henry say \"I think the two of you have some catching up to do. Eliza and myself will take charge of your young Jane Tom, while you visit. That is...if it is alright with you Tom...oh and of course Miss Lefroy.\" It was as if he had read my mind...but after our own little talk, he knew that Jane and I needed to talk. I threw him a look of gratitude while I agreed that it was fine with me. And my daughter, I immediately replied for her. Jane seemed shocked by this suggestion, almost...angry that Henry and Eliza were leaving her with me. Finally alone, I quickly I stepped closer to her and addressed her as gently as I could, \"Miss Austen...\" and then I practically whispered, \"Jane...\" Slowly, she turned to face me...[Chapter 4] CHAPTER 3: (Jane) \"Mr. Lefroy...\" I said perhaps a little too quickly but I did so on purpose before Tom could utter another word lest our conversation become more \"intimate\", beyond the customary greetings. \"And how is your family? Your parents and brothers and sisters? They are all well, I hope?\" Tom seemed to be taken by surprise by the directness of my words for he briefly hesitated in replying. \"They are very well, I thank you. My parents have been gone for a little while now.\" I felt myself blush slightly at the mention of his parents as of course I knew this already, being that Anne Lefroy is Tom's father's sister-in-law. Clearly, Mr. Lefroy's presence had flustered me somewhat. But I quickly squashed any further embarrassment to myself and acted as though this was the first time I had heard of it. After all, I told myself...it was the first time I had heard it from Tom himself. \"Oh...I am so sorry.\" I replied sincerely. Tom shook his head slighty. \"They both had good, fulfilling lives and got to see their grandchildren born.\" The word \"grandchildren\" kept me in check. I took a deep breath and jumped in to ask the inevitable. \"And...how is your own family? Your...wife?\" There. I had finally said it. Outloud. To Tom. The words, \"Your wife.\" I was puzzled when Tom didn't reply right away. \"My children are...quite well, thank you...\" He finally answered. Here Tom paused again before going on. \"My wife...\" He began in a quiet voice. \"My wife...she is no longer living.\" I stared at Tom uncomprehending. I'm sure I had misunderstood him. \"I'm sorry?\" I asked frowning. \"My wife died not long after our last child was born...\" I don't know why I reacted the way I did to news of the fate that befell Tom's wife as it was not uncommon for women to die in childbirth. Our own family certainly had not been immune as three out of my six brothers, James, Edward and Charles all lost their first wives to childbirth. I still remember the words \"What a burden to women chidbirth is\" I had said to my sister Cassandra once after losing yet another sister-in-law to it. But upon hearing the news of Tom's wife, I suddenly felt the need to sit down. I moved distractedly towards the nearest chair. \"Jane? Are you alright?\" Tom was there I realized, helping me. He gently guided and then sat me down in the chair and then sat himself down beside me. \"My wife...her name was Mary...she was with our 8th child. But it was difficult for her that last time, unlike any of the others. The birthing came on too fast and too soon and was especially difficult for her. The baby did not survive.\" I felt myself gasp at these words. \"Mary survived the actual birthing but it took too much out of her. She never fully recovered from it. And while she was still lying-in** she caught an infection which claimed her life.\" he finished. Both of my hands had moved to cover my mouth as I listened to Tom tell me about his poor wife. It seemed ages before I was able to answer him, myself. \"Oh...Tom...\" I finally managed. \"I am...so sorry. Really, I am.\" I didn't know what else to say. But one thing entered my mind just now...how was it that THIS piece of news never reached me? I wondered.. \"Thank you...\" he replied soberly. \"She was a good woman. A good wife, a wonderful mother. Very devoted to all of us.\" \"To be sure..\" I replied sincerely. Then before I could stop myself, \"When did...?\" I stopped myself here, thinking that perhaps this was a question I shouldn't be asking. \"About a year and a half, now.\" He replied without any preamble. \"And how are you coping? With seven children and no mother to look after them?\" I couldn't help but ask this of him. A hint of a smile reached Tom's lips. \"My family. As I had helped them at one time..\" -I knew exactly of the time he meant. Tom would send his family money as he earned it from his uncle while he studied law - \"..they have been helping me with my children.\" \"That is really wonderful of them Tom.\" I smiled at him. \"Jane...\" I could tell that the talk about about to get 'intimate' but I had no chance to prevent it for he went on immediately, most likely before I could stop him this time, \"When Mary and myself married, I was not in love with her at the time as I had rushed into marrying her to escape the pain of losing you. Despite that fact, she was in love with me and knew that I did not feel the same way for her as she did for me. But she never gave up on me and eventually, I did fall in love with her. I really did...do love her. She was very sweet, gentle, kind and a wonderful, devoted wife and mother. But I never forgot you. Could never forget you. I will always love her. But as much as I tried to deny it to myself for the past 17 years, I never stopped loving you. I knew that the moment I laid eyes on you again today.\" I now stared at Tom in shock, then stood up as I replied. \"That is not possible.\" I replied stoutly. \"It is not possible to love two people at the same time.\" I finished with stubborn logic. \"Ah...but it is.\" Tom countered me. \"I wouldn't have believed it either had I not experienced it for myself. I had stifled my feelings for you for 17 years Jane. I thought they had gone. Until I saw you again...today. The moment I saw you, those feelings came rushing back 100 fold. Like I had been gone back in time...like we had never parted, like those 17 years had never happened yet. And I came to realize that the reason I could say that I love you both is because I love each of you in a different way because you are both very different from each other. I already told you what my wife was like, but I have always loved and admired your courage, your spirit, your spontaneity and independence. You challenge me Jane, keep me in check. I like that about you.\" I hardly knew what to say to this now...and while I was mulling over Tom's words, trying to make sense of them, wondering if it really was possible, he said something else...something that also made me feel like I had gone back in time...like we had never parted, like those 17 years had never happened...he echoed the very words he had said to me that had set us off on a journey that should have happened, but never did...\"Come away with me, Jane...\" he spoke softly. **Lying-in-an 18-19th Century English term for \"recovering\" after giving birth. The new mother would stay in bed for days/weeks after having a baby. Quite opposite of how things are done today. ;-D (Tom) There were a few things that I had hoped to talk with Jane about but there was one thing that had to come first and foremost. As soon as she turned to face me, I was prepared to start this talk in particular with her but before I could, she cut me off right at the start. \"Mr. Lefroy...\" She started a bit quickly, \"And how is your family? Your parents and brothers and sisters? They are all well, I hope?\" Taken by surprise, I could only hesitate before giving her the customary answer she was awaiting. I knew that she had cut me off on purpose. I realized that she didn't want our talk to become too personal. But that was exactly what it was going to become. I had to tell her...she had to know, she had to understand about my situation. I was a bit amused that she had asked about my parents because surely she knew about them, being neighbours and friends of my father's brother and wife, Anne. But now I wondered how long it would be before she would ask about my own family and wife...she would have to...eventually, I would think. I would wait and if she didn't bring it up soon, I would, one way or another. As it turned out, I didn't have to wait long after all. \"And...how is your own family? Your...wife?\" Jane seemed to have a bit of a struggle with asking about my wife. And even though I had more or less been expecting her to ask...been wanting her to so that I could finally tell her what had happened, I found it was still hard to start it off. I hesitated, first telling her about my children. Then...I moved on from there... Jane seemed unbelieving of me when I first said that Mary was no longer living. And when I said how she had died not long after our last child was born she almost looked ill. It gave me a bit of start to see her sway slightly. \"Jane? Are you alright?\" I asked genuinely concerned. Worried about her health, I made a grab for her lest she should fall into a faint, helped her to the nearest chair, sat her down and sat down beside her before I continued on with my story.. Throughout the course of my explanation about my current situation, I noticed that Jane went from being shocked to genuinely upset. I was touched by this as I knew how hard it must be for her to have to sit and listen to me talk about my late wife. However I was not going to hold anything back. If this was to be our only chance to talk, then I would leave nothing out as I wanted to clear the air between us. But I sincerely hoped that this would NOT be our only time together... While I was telling Jane how I had married Mary when I did not love her, I had this sudden thought of how ironic that was, considering that Jane herself did not believe in \"marrying without affection\". And I had done just that. Married without affection...and because of Jane. However, as I ended up telling Jane, in time, I had grown to love the woman I married. But I had never forgotten Jane. That was true. I thought I had moved on with my life when in reality all I had done was hid myself in my marriage, children and career...and I had only just discovered that, this very day only a little while earlier when I first saw her again in the flesh. Jane had always been there, in the back of my mind, buried deep in my heart where no one else could reach her, except me...and only when I allowed her to. Which was now. \"It is not possible to love two people at the same time.\" Jane now objected to my statement of being able to love two people at the same time. Some how, I was not surprised that Jane would say this. This was my Jane all over again. She always spoke what was on her mind to either defend or try and prove her point. Ah...but it is.\" I countered her, quite enjoying the knowledge that this part of Jane had not changed. I went on. \"I wouldn't have believed it either had I not experienced it for myself. I had stifled my feelings for you for 17 years Jane. I thought they had gone. Until I saw you again...today. The moment I saw you, those feelings came rushing back 100 fold. Like I had been gone back in time...like we had never parted, like those 17 years had never happened yet. And I came to realize that the reason I could say that I love you both is because I love each of you in a different way because you are both very different from each other. I already told you what my wife was like, but I have always loved and admired your courage, your spirit, your spontaneity and independence. You challenge me Jane, keep me in check. I like that about you.\" It was true. And already she was challenging me, with her belief that a person could not love two people at the same time. I was ready for the challenge. And I would be ready for many more. I only hoped that there would be more. After all of this time we had been apart, I welcomed them...looked forward to them. I had already talked to Henry and Eliza about this earlier while we had been waiting for Jane and while she seemed to be thinking over my last words to her, I took the opportunity to softly say, \"Come away with me Jane...\" ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Mary Lefroy dying from infection after their 8th baby was born is completely fictional, but their son Benjamin who died in infancy two years before their last daughter, Mary Elizabeth was born \"represents\" their 8th child in the chapter you just read and in this story, as opposed to their 7th child in reality. As well Mary Elizabeth and the younger Lefroy children after Anne Lefroy will (have to) be portrayed as being a little bit older (by about a year-ish) in this story. From Wikipedia: Tom Lefroy's children Tom Lefroy married Mary Paul on 16 March 1799 in north Wales [6]. From their marriage, they had seven children as listed in the Visitation of Ireland[9]: Anthony Lefroy (21 March 1800 11 January 1890), subsequently MP for his father's old seat of Dublin University. Jane Christmas Lefroy (24 June 1802 3 August 1896) Anne Lefroy (25 April 1804 24 February 1885) Thomas Paul Lefroy (31 December 1806 29 January 1891; wrote Memoir of Chief Justice Lefroy, published in 1871) The Very Rev. Jeffry Lefroy (25 March 1809 10 December 1885) George Thomson Lefroy (26 May 1811 19 March 1890) Mary Elizabeth Lefroy (19 December 1817 23 January 1890) Another son (Benjamin, born March 25, 1815) died in infancy. Tom Lefroy s daughters never married.[Chapter 5] I would like to take this moment to thank each and every one of you who have taken the time to stop by and read my story. Every time I look at the story stats and see the hits/visitors for it go up, it really encourges me to keep on with it! I really have been enjoying writing this story and sharing it with you and I can promise you that at this point, there is still plenty of Tom and Jane to come! ;-D Thank you! ;-D CHAPTER 4: (Jane) I looked at Tom unable to utter a word. Had I heard him correctly? Was he proposing that we...\"go away\" together again? He couldn't have said what I thought he had said... \"I have already invited Henry and Eliza to stay at my place here in London for the duration of your trip. And..perhaps you could even stay a little longer than you had originally planned. They have already accepted. We only await your decision.\" Tom now explained. I found myself able to breathe again. Admittedly, I was a bit relieved that he wasn't asking that I go away with him again for I honestly didn't know how I should have reacted to such an idea especially being that we had only been in each other's company for a very short time since we saw each other last. \"They don't want to stay without you.\" Tom added in a quiet voice. It was now that I realized...Tom had a place here in London? What had happened to Ireland? I wondered. \"I'm sure your place is full enough with your children.\" I objected. \"My children stay with my family in Ireland, Jane. It would be impossible for me to work and look after my family at home.\" \"But your daughter is here.\" I pointed out. \"Jane is my eldest daughter and I allow her to stay with me in London from time to time.\" He explained. \"What about a governess? Surely you could afford one.\" I persisted, more out of curiosity than anything. \"My family offered first and personally I would rather have my children looked after by family.\" I nodded my head in agreement. I could not blame him there, as even our own family has helped to look after my brothers children after they had lost their mothers and wives, until they got back on their feet again. \"And they are close by to their mother's family as well by living there. I have no wish to take them away from their mother's family.\" Again, I acknowledged this with a nod of my head. \"Please Jane...it's been a long time. I would really like for us to get to know one another again.\" Tom pleaded with me. But I was hesitant. At this stage in my life, did I want to go through another painful love affair? And with Tom again? Especially as it's obvious that I am not over him. Wouldn't it be better to make the break now? Yes, he had proclaimed his love for me...and his wife was no longer living. And he must no longer be needed to support his family as he had a family of his own to support and his siblings would be adults themselves now. But...what of his uncle? The one who had forbade our union? And other family members? I'm still a 'poor clergyman's daughter', beneath the Lefroy's standards, perhaps even more-so now that Tom had become a successful lawyer. THAT has not changed, so no matter how we might feel about each other, I could not see how there could be anything more between us than a friendship. And...am I ready to become 'just friends' with Tom Lefroy, the first man to whom I had really fallen in love with? I looked at Tom now...I could see the beseeching look in his eyes...the same one he gave to me when he had come across myself and my brother George on a walk when he was back visiting family shortly after I had found out about his engagement...the same look when I left him part way through our \"elopement\" journey. \"No!\" I suddenly recalled that particular moment, his exclamation full of emotion when I had stood up to leave...he had grabbed my hand to try to prevent me from leaving him. Both of these memories came rushing back to me, bringing on fresh pain. But perhaps it was because of those memories that I felt an urgency to change them, as I could not seem to forget them. (Especially as the person who was part of those memories was standing before me again now). Looking at Tom, I found that I couldn't reject him after all. And I felt a desire to change the look in his eyes. \"Please Jane...\" he repeated quietly, still pleading with me. \"Alright.\" I finally gave my consent. \"I must be completely mad! But then...perhaps I deserve it.\" I added to myself as I accepted whatever fate had in store for me for agreeing to his invitation. But the instant change it brought to Tom's eyes and face made me feel like maybe...MAYBE it was the right decision after all. A lot HAD changed in 17 years, most especially for Tom of course. And after all, why shouldn't we be friends? I tried to convince myself. At least we can...I can TRY and be friends with him. We wouldn't have to stay long and at the end of our stay, I will either learn to be friends with him, or perhaps I will be able to part from him in a more positive way this time...a way that will not hurt. \"Come...\" Tom said then with a smile on his lips. \"Let us find the others and tell them of the good news.\" I walked towards Tom and as I did, he fell in step beside me as we went to search for Henry, Eliza and Young Jane. We eventually came upon them in another part of the building, admiring some of the artwork on display. Apparently, the building was also an art gallery. As Henry spotted us walking towards them, he called, \"I see you have convinced my sister to join us for a visit at your place Lefroy. I can tell by the look on your face.\" He teased Tom with a grin of his own to which I felt myself blush slightly. \"I suggest we be on our way if you three are done looking at the art.\" Tom replied purposely ignoring Henry's remark. \"Of course we must go to the Inn of which we have been staying and collect our bags first.\" Eliza reminded everyone. \"I will take you over there myself in my carriage before we carry on to my place then.\" Tom offered firmly. \"I would like to ride with Miss Austen.\" Young Jane now dared to say, rather shyly. I noticed her looking at me with a shy smile on her face. I returned the smile and replied. \"And I would be honoured to ride with you, Miss Lefroy.\" To which Young Jane blushed with pleasure. \"And you must sit next to me.\" I insisted. This would serve two purposes, to make Miss Lefroy happy and to keep Mr. Lefroy from being able to sit next to me. The five of us left the building together and followed Tom to his carriage where, once he had helped me in and we were all seated, I noticed that, even though I was able to prevent him from sitting next to me, he was able to arrange it where he and I ended up sitting opposite each other. As Tom sat down, he gave me what I interpreted as a coy smile. (Tom) I don't know why those particular words came out. I hadn't intended to say them, they just...came out. I wondered if Jane had noticed? I saw her looking at me in a way that told me that she too had not forgotten. It wasn't that I wouldn't have wanted exactly that...for her to come away with me again, and this time, the ending would be different. It would be a different ending that would provide a new beginning for us. However, I knew that we needed to take the time to get to know one another again. To become comfortable with each other again. I also realized that because of how our break up had affected Jane, from what Henry had told me earlier, that I could not..should not rush Jane into anything like that again. As well, a lot had changed in 17 years and we weren't the young, carefree people we had been. I couldn't just take off on a whim like I could back then. I had a family and a career that I had to think about if I wanted to be able to marry Jane and give her a comfortable place in which to live and a comfortable lifestyle, something I was able to give her this time, something I was unable to give her the last time. And as long as I didn't do anthing to cause it to mess up. As eager as I was to make this come true for us, I also had my head together more this time than the last time. If I wanted to make it work for sure this time, I would have to be patient. Quickly I explained to Jane what I had in mind. To have the three of them, Henry, Eliza and Jane all stay at my place for the rest of their visit and perhaps even longer, if they wished. I know that is what I wished for, an extended visit. I knew that Jane would never stay without Henry and Eliza and of course it was out of the question to ask a single lady to stay with a widowed man who was not a relative or an employee. At this stage of my life, I knew better than to risk my reputation as a well-respected lawyer and citizen. As Henry and Eliza had already agreed to this arrangement as long as Jane would, I only needed to receive Jane's acceptance. \"They don't want to stay without you.\" I said to her in a quiet voice. I held my breath as I waited for her reply. I could see that a battle was waging within herself regarding my invitation, unsure of what she should do about it. I could tell by what she said next that I was right. \"I'm sure your place is full enough with your children.\" She replied. I was sure she was using the idea of my children as an excuse to turn me down. \"My children stay with my family in Ireland, Jane. It would be impossible for me to work and look after my family at home.\" I countered her quickly. \"But your daughter is here.\" She pointed out stubbornly. Ah, here is my Jane once again. \"Jane is my eldest daughter and I allow her to stay with me in London from time to time.\" I replied patiently. \"What about a governess? Surely you could afford one.\" She was being persistent now, I almost wondered if she was doing this to avoid giving me an answer to my invitation. \"My family offered first and personally I would rather have my children looked after by family.\" I answered her steadily. This at least seemed to stop the flow of her questions. I took advantage of her silence as I begged her, \"Please Jane...it's been a long time. I would really like for us to get to know one another again.\" Jane continued to be silent. She seemed to be giving it a lot of thought. I was afraid of breaking that silence, lest it should push her in the opposite direction of what I was hoping for. But as much as I tried, I couldn't be silent. It seemed like she was taking forever to make up her mind...and I wanted her to come stay with me so much that finally I had to say something again. \"Please Jane...\" I stopped here, biting my tongue to say anything further lest it push her over the edge...and the wrong edge at that. When finally after what felt like an eternity and she agreed, I cannot even describe the emotions that ran through me then. Relief, joy, elation...those words just didn't seem to do justice to the way it made me feel when she finally consented. Feeling almost light headed but happy, I said smiling at her, \"Come..let us find the others and tell them of the good news.\" I waited for Jane to come towards me and then I fell in step with her as she did. We walked side by side companionably through the building until we found the others looking at some of the artwork that was on display. Upon noticing us, Henry said with a grin on his face, \"I see you have convinced my sister to join us for a visit at your place Lefroy. I can tell by the look on your face.\" I was never bothered by Henry's teasing of me and as I was quite happy, I chose to ignore him suggesting that we leave for my place, as I was quite anxious to have them all settled there as soon as possible. Eliza reminded us that they needed to retrieve their bags from their rooms as they would no longer be staying at the Inn. I offered to drive them over and then back to my place. \"I would like to ride with Miss Austen.\" My daughter now said shyly. She had loved Jane's book Pride and Prejudice and I could tell that she was becoming a bit \"smitten\" with the real Miss Austen. For the second time that day, Jane touched my heart when she replied to my daughter in a kind and gentle manner, \"And I would be honoured to ride with you, Miss Lefroy. And you must sit beside me.\" The last part of her statement rather amused me because I had the feeling that it was a ploy so that I would not be able to sit next to her. I hid my smile as I helped both Jane and my daughter into the carriage arranging it so that I would be sitting across from Miss Austen instead as she had made sure that I would not be able to sit beside her. I cast Jane a bit of a triumphant smile as I sat down and faced her.[Chapter 6] CHAPTER 5: Jane's POV: Obviously, Mr. Lefroy saw right through my little 'scheme' to keep us separated and had schemed himself to have us facing each other in the carriage instead. I sat up straight and tall as I realized this, wishing to punish him somehow for it. But the only thing I could come up with was to ignore him throughout our ride. I could not, however block out his, Henry's and Eliza's small talk. And I would not ignore any remarks either Henry or Eliza...or young Jane would say to me. That should show him my intentions. I admit that I felt a bit smug at my decision to make him pay. I listened in on their conversations but I refused to participate in any part that Tom was involved in. As it wasn't too far to the Inn, this part of our ride was short and soon the three of us alighted from Tom's carriage to retrieve our bags from our rooms while Tom and his daughter held the carriage until our return. Once we had accomplished this task and returned to Tom and young Jane, I decided that this time, I would not try to manipulate our seating arrangement again. However, I still refused to talk with Mr. Lefroy as I was rather enjoying punishing him. It would not last long as I was about to find out. Once we were under way to Tom's place, he spoke up, \"I have inherited my uncle's old place and office.\" These words took me by surprise, causing me to gasp inwards. The last time...indeed the one and only time I had ever been to Tom's uncle's place was that fateful time when Tom's plan was to introduce me to his uncle in order to make a positive impression upon him in regards to me so that he would continue to be in his uncle's favour and we could marry...it was also the time that John Warren had sent his horrid letter to Tom's uncle thereby giving no chance of a union between Tom and myself. I never forgave John for that and refused to lay eyes on him since learning the truth about his poisoned letter. I...we...my family that is, never saw John Warren again after he departed from our house where he more or less confessed to his being the author and sender of said letter, the day I arrived back home from my \"elopement\" journey. Even now, being reminded of that time, I burn with anger at the injustice of it all. If it hadn't been for that letter, Tom's uncle may very well have more open to the idea of a marriage between us. \"My uncle left me his old place and office here in London after he passed away shortly after my wife Mary passed.\" Tom was now saying. \"So that is why you are here...in London.\" The words came rushing out before I could stop them, but the punishment that I bestowed upon him had already completely vanished from my mind. Tom gazed at me as I spoke these words to him. I thought I detected a slight smile on his face as he answered, \"Yes. I continued on with my practice in Ireland after Mary died, but it was a hard time for me. And when I learned that uncle had left his place for me in London, I decided that perhaps it the time was right to take the opportunity to expand my practice and see how well I could do in London as I had been doing very well in Ireland.\" \"But your family...\" \"I go in between both places. I spend time both here and in Ireland with them.\" \"That is a lot of travelling.\" I pointed out. \"Yes...it is.\" Tom admitted. \"But I have the time to do it. My family is very important to me and I would never abandon them. But I need my career as well. My idea is to get this London practice established under my uncle's name and have another reputable lawyer or two to work from it. Then my plan is to spend more time back in Ireland and eventually live there on a permanent basis again.\" We had now pulled up to a vaguely familiar building and the carriage came to a full stop. \"Here we are...again.\" Tom remarked who got out first and held his hand up to help me down from the carriage. I barely touched his hand as I got down. As I stood there waiting for everyone else to alight from the carriage, I gazed up at the building, the memories of it rushing back to me. All of those years ago, another time when Henry, Eliza and myself had stayed here last. And here we were, as Tom had said, \"again\". The only difference this time was that Tom was entering the house with us instead of waiting on the other side of the door along with his uncle...and there was no longer an uncle on the other side awaiting for our arrival. At least this time, the visit should be less tense then, I thought to myself, more casual...I hoped. If anything, it would be different this time, of that there was no doubt. Tom opened the door and we were greeted by one of his servants who took our hats and wraps for us. I looked about the place to see that it had changed very little from when his uncle had lived there, but then as Tom now explained he wasn't here in the house part a lot of the time, unless Jane was there visiting, but spent much of his time in his office working or in the courtroom as well as what he referred to as his country home in Ireland. \"Country home?\" I repeated, puzzled. \"Yes...it is where my children live and are being raised as I didn't want them to be raised in London. And my wife..their mother, God rest her soul, wouldn't have either. As I mentioned to you earlier Miss Austen, Mary's own family is from Ireland I didn't want to take my children away from her family, nor my own for that matter.\" \"Of course.\" I agreed. \"I get up there as often as I can and stay for weeks at a time for I want my children to know their father.\" \"You are a wonderful father Tom.\" Eliza now put in. \"Anyone can tell that just by observing your Jane here, she is lovely. And no matter how many miles may separate you from your family at this time, one can tell that you are very devoted to your children. Your country home must be lovely indeed.\" Tom followed up this compliment by another surprising statement. \"I wish for you all see it one day. When I'm on leave from here next, perhaps.\" I didn't know how to respond to such an invitation myself. But my brother did. \"Are you giving us another invitation Lefroy?\" He asked with a grin. \"I believe I am!\" Tom smiled back at Henry and then looking at me, who could still think of no reply, continued softly, \"It would be my pleasure. I would be honoured for you to meet my family.\" \"And we would be delighted of course, Tom.\" Eliza replied. \"Then we must make some arrangements of getting or keeping in touch with one another for it.\" Henry stated firmly. \"Do you have an idea of about when you might leave next?\" \"Not at least for a couple of months.\" was Tom's reply. That would put us into...October or November of the year.\" Henry said thoughtfully. \"Yes...I am always at home for Christmas of course. Perhaps you would even care to stay long enough and join myself and my family for the holiday season?\" Tom's face brightened once again with this idea. \"We would be the ones who would be honoured Tom, to both meet and spend Christmas with you and your family.\" Was Eliza's reply. \"Then it is settled, yes?\" Tom asked, once again looking hopefully at me with askance in his eyes while I was even more dumbfounded at the idea of spending Christmas with him...and in his home in Ireland, not knowing how I should be feeling about all of this. When I had agreed to stay at Tom's with Henry and Eliza, I had not seen it go any further than this visit...my head fairly whirled about with all that had transpired over the past several hours. What had started out as an innocent outing in London with Eliza and Henry had turned into something that had far exceeded my fondest of dreams. And...my feelings...I couldn't deny it. What Tom offered...I wanted... I wanted it very much. But my pride...or perhaps it's just my plain stubborn side was not going to allow Tom to know just how much I wanted this...I took my time accepting his invitation, pretending to think about it very hard even though my mind was already made up...\"Yes...\" I finally agreed in a composed manner. Tom's POV: I noticed during our ride that Jane didn't seem to be paying any attention to me. Indeed, she didn't say very much at all, but only made small replies or the odd comment here and there when required to by Henry, Eliza and even my daughter. Again, I had to keep my smile hidden as I came to realize that she was punishing me for our seating arrangement. Life would never, could never be dull with Jane, I had always known that. Once we reached the Inn, all three of the Austens alighted while Jane and myself stayed with the carriage until their return. I had gotten out of the carriage myself as a gentleman always does when there are ladies present. Jane had slid over to the side of the carriage where Jane had been sitting. I felt her hand upon my arm. \"Father?\" She addressed me now. \"Yes, child?\" \"Thank you for the lovely surprise.\" she said with a smile. \"Surprise?\" I asked frowning. \"What surprise?\" \"Miss Austen, of course! You had said there was a surprise, remember?\" Of course...with all that had happened in the past little while, I had completely forgotten that I had said to Jane when I was in pursuit of Henry, Eliza and Jane earlier that day as to where we were going, \"It's a surprise.\" Little did I realize at the time that things were going to get this far...farther than I had dared hoped for when we were first there. \"I didn't know that you knew Miss Austen.\" She now said. \"Why didn't you say when you had bought me the Pride and Prejudice book?\" I looked at my daughter now, trying to think of a good answer that was not a lie. \"Because Jane...it was a long time ago when I knew Miss Austen. Long before Pride and Prejudice. I couldn't be sure that she would even remember me. I took a chance coming in here today where I knew they...where she was. But...I wanted to try. Again, I didn't know that she would remember and I didn't want you to be disappointed.\" \"Who could ever forget you father?\" Jane looked at me affectionately. \"But she didn't forget you. And I am not at all disappointed. I wouldn't have been even if she hadn't remembered you. It was lovely that you would have tried for me. And thank you for inviting her to stay with us.\" She smiled happily as she replied. I smiled back at her, lovingly. \"I'm very happy that it all worked out, child.\" It didn't take the three long to collect their bags and soon we were on our way again, with the same seating arrangements and Jane still continuing to ignore me. As I knew our destination might come as a surprise to my guests, I thought that I had better say something about it as soon as possible so as to prepare them. Without any preamble, not long after we started off, I told them, \"I have inherited my uncle's old place and office.\" I noticed that this news brought a reaction from Jane, even though she did not say anything right away. She looked at me as soon as the words were out, but I could almost see that she was taking a trip back into the past.. \"My uncle left me his old place and office here in London after he passed away shortly after my wife Mary passed.\" I now added. \"So that is why you are here...in London.\" She now ventured to say. Apparently, my punishment was over with...for now anyway. A small smile got away on me as I looked at her and replied seriously, hoping that she didn't think I had noticed her silence towards me. \"Yes. I continued on with my practice in Ireland after Mary died, but it was a hard time for me. And when I learned that uncle had left his place for me in London, I decided that perhaps it the time was right to take the opportunity to expand my practice and see how well I could do in London as I had been doing very well in Ireland.\" From there we carried on an amicable conversation, me explaining the situation about my work, what I had planned on doing with my uncle's office and abode as well as my family situation. When we arrived at what had become my place, both Henry and myself alighted first from the carriage and I held my hand up to help Jane down. I noticed that she barely touched it as she got out, clearly wanting to show me that she was still independent. I noticed her looking the building over and I was sure that more memories must be playing through her mind. I opened up the door and one of my servants was there to take our wraps and hats. I knew that the first thing they would notice was that not much had changed so I quickly explained that unless Jane was visiting me, I didn't spend much time there as I was usually working in my office or I was in the courtroom or in Ireland. I had used the term \"country home\" without even thinking about it which brought another reaction from Jane. \"Country home?\" She repeated. I explained to her that my children were being raised there as I didn't want them to be raised in London and I knew that Mary wouldn't have either. This brought up another subject which, I had hoped upon meeting Jane again was going to happen, that they should all come to Ireland sometime to stay with me and meet my family. That Jane and I would marry, was not a question to myself. I was convinced of it the moment we were able to talk in private after her reading. But I was sure that this idea had most likely not even entered Jane's mind and I had to keep reminding myself that I must take my time with her which is why I knew that the idea of having all three of them visit me in Ireland was the best way to go about getting Jane to agree to it. And then as I knew it would be later fall before I would be back there again, the idea of Christmas came to my mind and the very thought of spending Christmas with Jane and my family was suddenly one thing that I wanted very much to have happen. It had to...a thought came to my mind just then...a very happy thought...something I would do at Christmas while Jane was there...she had to say \"yes\" to this...she just had to...she seemed to be taking her time with her reply...but then after what seemed like eons, she gave me her reply, \"Yes...\" very quietly.[Chapter 7] CHAPTER 6: Jane's POV: Tom's face light up again, the way it had before when I had agreed to stay at his place here in London, after I finally gave him my reply in the positive for Christmas at his place in Ireland. I will not deny that this made me feel very happy...something I thought I would never get the chance to feel again with Tom. I thought that had passed a long time ago... However, I was still not about to let on how this arrangement was making me feel. I was happy that Tom was so visibly happy about the idea...and I was happy that he had asked us to join him for Christmas...happy that it was what Tom wanted. But I must keep myself in check. Perhaps I was too hasty in my reply to him after all...because...again...where could this all lead to but another painful departure between us...yet...maybe not. Maybe, like I had told myself earlier, we COULD just carry on as friends. Perhaps with time spent together, that is exactly what would happen. I couldn't...didn't really want to change my mind about it now anyway. The time spent here with Tom might show how things would go, could go between the two of us in the future. This entire conversation had taken place while we were wandering through the house. We came upon one of the sitting rooms and Tom stepped aside allowing the rest of us to enter so that we could all sit down and be comfortable. I noticed a pianoforte at the opposite end of the room and moved towards it. This was something new...I would have remembered it. \"That wasn't here before.\" I remarked pointing to it. \"No, it wasn't.\" Tom answered quietly following me over to it. I stretched out my hand upon reaching it and ran my hands gently over the keys. \"I bought it for Jane.\" Tom told us, as he now stood beside me. I looked at him. I detected a double meaning in his voice and eyes. He had bought it for Jane...and for me? Jane had been following us the entire time and I now turned towards her with a smile and addressed her. \"You play?\" \"Some...\" she replied. \"Then you should play for us.\" I encouraged her. Young Jane blushed at the attention. \"Oh..I don't know that I could.\" \"You play just fine, Jane.\" Tom agreed. \"You should play what you know best for our guests, especially as Miss Austen has asked you so nicely.\" Jane knew she had no choice but to obey her father. She came over to the piano, sat down and drew a bit of a breath before she started to play. She played us a couple of pieces which, I had to agree, she played just fine for her age. I was impressed as was the her small audience. When she had finished, we applauded as she stood up and politely curtsied to us. \"And now, Miss Austen should play for us.\" Tom stated firmly, taking me off of my guard. I gaped at him and I swear if eyes could twinkle, his were at that moment. \"Do you play too Miss Austen?\" Jane looked at me, her face bright with this knowledge. \"Well yes, dearest...\" I replied using the affectionate term \"dearest\" without even thinking. Cassandra and I often use that term for our own young nieces and nephews. \"I do play...some.\" \"My sister is actually fairly accomplished in the pianoforte.\" Henry now took it upon himself to help throw me into a situation that I had not expected to be in. I looked over at him and shot him a withering look. If I had not been with both Henry and Tom since our departure from the art gallery building, I would have sworn that the two them had planned this. Honestly! The pair of them! \"Would you play for us to then?\" Jane pleaded. I would have thought that Tom would have admonished Jane for begging, but as he was obviously on her side, he stayed his tongue in that regard. \"Please Jane. You do play very well.\" Now it was Eliza who spoke up. Now I was the one without a choice but to play for them. I made my way over to the piano, sat down and after a moment of silence, I let my fingers take over the keys...and everything and everyone vanished from the room from the moment I started playing. I was startled back to the present by the applause when I had finished. \"Oh you do play beautifully Miss Austen.\" Jane sighed. \"Perhaps you could teach me how to play more like you while you are here?\" \"Jane..\" This time Tom decided to step in. But by this time I had my wits about me again. \"Of course, Miss Lefroy.\" I countered him, not thinking straight off about what I might be getting myself into. \"I will be happy to sit down with you and help you the best I can.\" In all honesty, I had no idea how I would fair teaching a young girl how to play as I had never actually taught anyone before...but I had already made my promise and I would do my best. I hoped I could teach her well enough to satisfy both her and her father. \"Oh, thank you Miss Austen!\" \"Jane, I think it's time for you to go upstairs and get yourself ready for dinner.\" Tom told his young daughter who happily bowed to us before she left the room. Once she was out of the room, Tom turned to the rest of us and said, \"Mary's passing has been very hard on Jane. She misses her mother very much, they were very close. And it is made even more difficult by her age as she is getting to the age where she needs her mother. My sisters who are helping to raise my family have done a wonderful job, but it's not the same. It's one of the reasons why I allow her to stay with me in London sometimes. So that we can spend some time alone together. As her mother can't be there for her, at least I can, her father.\" As I looked at Tom, my heart filled with sympathy for Jane...and admiration for Tom. Now he looked at me as if to address me solely and said in a soft but serious voice. \"I believe my daughter has become quite attached to you Jane.\" Tom's POV: For the second time that day, Jane's reply brought exuberant joy to me. I confess that I didn't know how well the idea of having the three of them for Christmas in Ireland would go over with Jane, I was afraid that I might be pushing my luck with it. But once the idea had come to my mind, I couldn't let it go. I was both relieved and ecstatic that she had accepted it. Now as we moved about the house, I guided my guests towards one of the sitting rooms where would could converse in comfort. My daughter Jane was still amongst us, following. I had been observing her with interest, her interaction with the elder Jane. I had realized earlier on that she seemed to be becoming a bit \"smitten\" with Jane, but as I continued to watch, I could see the fondness continue to grow... Upon entering the sitting room, Jane noticed the pianoforte at the opposite end of the room and wandered over to it. I followed her. As she gently stroked the keys with her fingers, I told her in a meaningful way, \"I bought it for Jane.\" She looked at me in a way that told me she understood what I was saying. I had bought it for my daughter so that she would be able to continue with her practicing whenever she was visiting me. But...I did have another Jane in mind when I bought it for I knew that Jane also played. At the time I bought it, as outrageous as it was, I did picture my Jane playing it and I knew I had to buy it. Jane was now encouraging my daughter to play and I agreed that she must. She knew that she had to obey me. I admit that I am rather proud of her piano-playing and wanted to show her off a bit. I watched the elder Jane as she watched my daughter play. She seemed to be taking an interest in Jane which pleased me very much. I could also tell that she was impressed with her playing as well. \"And now, Miss Austen should play for us.\" I had had it in my mind all along that Jane would play for us if they stayed at my place. I was going to make that image of her playing my pianoforte come true. I also knew that I had to catch her off guard so that it would leave her no chance to get out of it. This enthralled my daughter even more to find out that Miss Austen could play the piano as well. \"Do you play too Miss Austen?\" She asked. \"Well yes, dearest...I do play...some.\" Was her reply. I was quick to pick up on Jane's term of affection for my daughter, calling her \"dearest\"...my two Janes were growing closer, I felt...A small, inaudible sigh of contentment escaped me at this thought. \"Would you play for us to then?\" Jane now was begging. Normally, I would never allow my children to beg someone for something as Jane did just then, but I purposely let it go this time as I wanted the same thing. And thanks to both Henry and Eliza who also encouraged Jane to play for us, I got my wish as Jane knew that she should not refuse the request that all of us wanted. She sat down at the piano and didn't play for several seconds..but when she did, I found that I was as lost in the music she played as I had been in her voice when she had read for us...and like the reading, her music came to an end much too soon. \"Oh you do play beautifully Miss Austen.\" I heard Jane say. \"Perhaps you could teach me how to play more like you while you are here?\" Now I thought perhaps my daughter was asking too much of Jane. \"Jane..\" I used my warning voice. But the elder Jane jumped right in, \"Of course, Miss Lefroy. I will be happy to sit down with you and help you the best I can.\" I admit that Jane's readiness to help my daughter with the piano surprised me...but in a pleasant way as the image of the two of them sitting at the piano making music together came to my mind and warmed my heart considerably. \"Jane, I think it's time for you to go upstairs and get yourself ready for dinner.\" I now told her. I could tell that she was very happy with the way things were going with \"Miss Austen\". I was too. She politely bowed to everyone and left the room. Even though we had been completely alone at the art gallery when we first started talking, Jane and myself, I still did not feel right talking about certain things there. But now that we were in the privacy of my own home and once Jane had left us, I felt I could talk about those issues I felt were more private...more sensitive. I turned to my guests and told them, \"Mary's passing has been very hard on Jane. She misses her mother very much, they were very close. And it is made even more difficult by her age as she is getting to the age where she needs her mother. My sisters who are helping to raise my family have done a wonderful job, but it's not the same. It's one of the reasons why I allow her to stay with me in London sometimes. So that we can spend some time alone together. As her mother can't be there for her, at least I can, her father.\" I noticed Jane's eyes fill with sympathy at my words. The look in her eyes is what made me want to say what I said next...I really wanted her to realize the impression her presence seemed to be having on my daughter. Even though I realized that Eliza and Henry were still in the room, I addressed my next words strictly to her. \"I believe my daughter has become quite attached to you Jane.\"[Chapter 8] CHAPTER 7: Jane's POV: What Tom had said astounded me. Surely...he was mistaken? I didn't know how to respond to that. \"I am so sorry for your loss Tom...\" I repeated my earlier condolences. \"The loss of your wife, Jane's mother, your children's mother. Your Jane is truly a delightful girl.\" I replied honestly. And she was. I confess that I couldn't help but like her. \"Thank you Jane. I...\" Here Tom was interrupted by one of his servants, a medium built man with thin, graying hair. \"Sir, dinner is ready to be served if you and your guests are also ready.\" \"Thank you Berkley.\" Tom replied. \"Now would be fine. Has Miss Lefroy come down?\" \"At the moment, she is still upstairs with Anna. Do you wish for me to check on their progress?\" \"Please do Berkley as I wish for my daughter to join us. We will proceed to the dining area while we await her. And Berkley, Miss Lefroy will be taking all of her meals with us while our guests are here.\" \"Very good, sir.\" Berkley bowed slightly before leaving the room. Now standing up himself, Tom turned to us and said, \"Come...\" indicating that it was time for us to quit the room. He waited for me by the door way and when I reached him, he offered me his arm. \"Miss Austen?\" He said quietly with a slight bow. As independent as I am, I knew it was bad manners to refuse a gentleman's arm when offered, so I bowed slightly back and ever so lightly placed my hand upon his arm. With Henry and Eliza following us, he led us to the dining area, a room I had not soon forgotten about...the room where in the past, we had shared a few pleasant meals with Tom's uncle before his uncle had received \"the letter\". It was the very room where Tom had started to try and tell his uncle of our intentions to marry...the room where upon reading said letter, his uncle started to abuse both Tom and myself. Even though Henry and Eliza and myself had been sitting outside the room, we could still hear plainly the damaging words that came from his mouth. It was the room where, after Tom's uncle had stormed out after his rant, I had entered to find out why his uncle had behaved in the way he had. It was also the room where Tom confessed to me that he had to do what he had to, for his family. At that time I had no idea just how much they had depended upon him and I felt that he was using his family as an excuse to not marry me. That as his uncle was so against a union between us, that he had in a sense, sided with his uncle. And because of that, it was the last time I had set foot in that place, the first time I had left Tom...\"Goodbye Mr. Lefroy.\" I had said to him that day, feeling more deeply hurt by his refusal to stand by me, the one he was supposedly fond of enough to propose marriage to, despite all of the odds against us, than his uncle's abusive words about me... As we approached the entrance of the room, I stopped. It had not been changed either. I felt Tom's free hand cover the one that was on his arm. \"Are you alright?\" He bent down slightly towards me to ask of me gently. I looked up at him. I could see the sympathy in his eyes. Of course he would not have forgotten either. I straightened my back, stood tall and replied. \"Yes, thank you. I'll be fine.\" We proceeded into the room where Tom placed us all. He of course took the seat at the head of the table now and placed me on his right. Oh his left he placed Henry and beside him of course was Eliza. Young Jane came into the room just as we had all sat. Tom stood up and escorted his daughter to the seat beside me. Upon returning to his own chair, dinner was subsequently served where we engaged in small talk, but it was Henry and Tom who did much of the talking, catching up with each other as they hadn't had the chance to yet, while Eliza and myself listened on, putting in a comment here and there. As much as I enjoyed the delicious dinner, and aside from the odd comment I contributed to Tom and Henry's conversation, I almost didn't even notice the wonderful food as I couldn't help but go over all that had transpired that day. It was almost like it was a dream and I was sure I would wake up and find myself back at home with Cassandra and our mother... It was after our main courses had been served and been eaten that a lull in the conversation had happened when Tom's daughter spoke. \"Father? May I please speak?\" She asked pleasantly. Tom looked at his daughter and nodded his approval. \"Yes Jane, you may. What do you wish to say?\" \"If Mr., Mrs. and Miss Austen are to spend Christmas with us in Ireland...couldn't we please have a ball whilst they are there?\" If I had been eating, I'm sure I would have choked on my food at her words just then. It was also probably a good thing that I held no cutlery in my hand for I'm sure I would have dropped it. Tom and I quickly glanced at each other and then away. Tom looked back at his daughter. \"A ball?\" He managed to get out. The suggestion of a ball brought back yet more memories...two very prominent memories to be exact. The first one being, where at a ball shortly after Tom had arrived to stay at his Aunt Anne and Uncle George Lefroy's, I had abused him to Eliza and Henry, while unbeknownst to myself, he had been listening. I was mortified that he should have heard me but my pride refused to let him see that I was. It was then that he said that he would be honoured to have next dance with me. He danced very well but our conversation during the dance was...shall we say...rather \"competitive\", each of us trying to upstage the other. The second ball however was an entirely different story. We had become more amicable towards each other by this time and I looked forward to his being there, looked forward to more dancing with him. I barely managed to keep my disappointment in check when I did not see him in the ballroom, nor anywhere else I was able to look in the house. I was positive that I had seen him in the window upstairs as we alighted from our carriage. Of course, by this time, Mr. Wisley had made his proposal of marriage to me and everyone was certain I would accept him. Perhaps word of that had reached Tom, I remember thinking at the time, perhaps that was why he had not shown himself to me...but he had to know, that I would never, could never marry Mr. Wisley. Somehow I had to let him know that...I had to let him know that I could never, would never marry without affection and that was why, no matter how much money Mr. Wisley may have, I could never marry him. I found myself back in the ballroom that night, bearing my disappointment. When Mr. Wisley asked me to dance again, I did my duty and stood up with him, but my heart was just not into dancing...not if Tom wasn't there...not if I wouldn't get the chance to dance with Tom... And then...suddenly...he was there...he was there and dancing with me...almost as if it were a dream...I was never more surprised. This time, neither of us spoke. There didn't seem to be a need to. But we also could not seem to stop looking at each other...my heart quickening each time we looked into each others eyes...it was if we two were the only ones in the room...the only ones dancing...that was when my heart knew for sure... \"Yes... a Christmas Ball.\" Jane was saying now, bringing me back to the present. \"Please father, we have not had one since mother...\" here her voice trailed off, perhaps it was too sad for her to talk about her mother...or perhaps she was worried about how her father might react to her bringing up her mother, his wife. Or perhaps she was worried that her father might berate her for begging. This caught my attention. I admit that the idea of Tom having something to do with the idea of having a Christmas Ball had crossed my mind, but when I looked at Tom again, really looked at him this time, I knew by the startled look on his face that he was completely innocent of it. I was immediately ashamed of my thoughts. As much as Tom might have a hand in certain things, he would never put his own child up to such a scheme, of that there was no doubt and I knew that. This was real. I now turned to Jane and addressed her myself. \"I think a Christmas Ball is a splendid idea myself. If your father approves, of course.\" Jane's face brightened at my reply and both of us now looked at Tom, awaiting his decision. I think he felt that there could only be one answer and once he recovered from his initial shock of his daughter's idea, \"Then a Christmas Ball we shall have.\" He promised with a smile which he beamed at first Jane and then myself which caused me to wonder if he too were remembering... Jane was fairly bursting with happiness at her father's promise. \"Thank you, father!\" I found it hard for me not to smile at her enthusiasm. \"Dessert, coffee and tea will be served in the sitting room, Mr. Lefroy.\" Berkley now came into the dining area to announce. \"Thank you, Berkley.\" Tom dismissed him and then stood up, indicating that we retire back to the sitting room. As Jane was with us this time, I reached for her hand to take in mine so that we could walk back to the sitting room together. Tom, I noticed this time, did not offer his arm, most likely because of Jane, I thought which was what I was sort of counting on. However I could tell by the look on his face that he was just as pleased to see me walking with Jane as he would be walking with my hand on his arm. Once again, Henry and Eliza followed while Tom brought up the rear. Back in the sitting room, the evening was passed with more casual conversation as we enjoyed the lovely light desserts and hot beverages. Eventually Jane and myself took turns playing a little more on the pianoforte again with encouragement from the other three, Jane seemingly having become more accustomed to her small audience. When it was time for her to retire for the night, she addressed Tom, \"Father, I wish to ask Miss Austen a favour before I leave for the night.\" \"If it's alright with Miss Austen.\" Tom nodded his approval. \"Or course dearest, what is it you wish to ask?\" I addressed Jane. Almost shyly again Jane asked, \"Would you please read for me once more?\" I couldn't help but smile at the child. \"Of course. I would be happy to. You go and pick out what you would like for me to read and I shall read it for you.\" Jane fairly skipped off to retrieve a book and was not long in coming back to me. As I was sat upon a small settee, I patted the place beside myself, indicating that she sit beside me again while I read. She opened the book and found the spot where she wanted me to start and I thus began. I had no idea how long I should read but as it was time for Jane to go to bed, I decided I should keep it short. If I went on too long, I was sure that Tom would stop me. The passage turned out to be longer than I thought and as it was so interesting that I had lost myself in it and had forgotten all about the time myself, but no one stopped me. When I finished, I looked up and realized that I must have read for too long. \"Oh, I do apologize.\" I said earnestly. \"I'm afraid I read for too long. Look at the child. Why she is almost asleep.\" For Jane was resting quite comfortably against me and just at that moment had yawned. \"It's alright Jane,\" Tom addressed me as he smiled. \"I think we can overlook this as it was a treat for all of us once again.\" I felt myself blush as his words. Anna, who was the maid who looked after Jane, had been sitting outside the room in the hall awaiting to take her young charge and get her ready for her bed. \"You may come and take Jane up to bed with you now Anna.\" Tom said and Anna appeared, ready to do her job. \"Come along Miss...\" she said gently taking Jane away from my side. \"Say good night to our guests like a good girl Jane.\" Tom instructed her. \"Good night Mr and Mrs. Austen.\" She murmured in a sleepy voice. \"Good night Miss Austen.\" \"Good night, dear one.\" I smiled at her affectionately. \"Good night, Father.\" \"Good night, my love. Sleep well.\" After Jane had left with Anna, the four of us started into another conversation for a bit until both Henry and Eliza declared that they too were ready to retire. It seemed like a good idea to myself as well and I got up when they did, ready to make my own way up to my room. I allowed them to leave the room before myself, but when I did, Tom said almost immediately after their departure, \"Jane...\" \"Mr. Lefroy...\" I said, for the second time that day, cutting him off before he could get intimate with me, knowing that is exactly where he was going now that we were alone once again. \"Tom...please Jane, call me Tom...I would prefer it. At least when it's just the two of us.\" \"Please...\" I started off more gently this time, purposely not saying his name at all this time, refusing to give him the satisfaction of me calling him Tom. \"It's been a...a lot has happened today and I find that I am quite overwhelmed at the moment and I just wish to retire to my own room for some alone time.\" I watched as I saw Tom's face fall slightly. I felt a bit guilty for being the cause of this, but I really needed some time and space now...to think... But then Tom nodded his head slightly as if in agreement, \"Of course. As you wish. Allow me to show you to your room at least. Your bags have already been placed there.\" I could think of no reason to not allow Tom this, so we ascended the stairs together where he directed me to the very room I was in the last time.. \"I hope it is alright that you should stay in the same room as the last time.\" \"It's fine..\" I replied, not really surprised at this. Another thought struck me just then...or rather, a memory. This was the very room where I started on my Pride and Prejudice book...only I had called it \"First Impressions\" then. At least in this room there was one happy memory I thought to myself. \"Good night then Jane..\" Tom turned to go towards his own room. \"Tom...?\" I asked quietly. \"Yes?\" He turned back. \"I wish to write a letter to my sister Cassandra to let her know of the change in our plans. Is there still pen and paper in the room do you know?\" \"I haven't actually been in that room for quite some time. Do you wish me to check?\" Tom offered. I stepped aside and allowed him to enter the room. He went over to the writing desk and checked through the cabinets and drawers, eventually finding everything I would need including an envelope and sealing wax. \"Thank you, Tom.\" I said sincerely with a smile on my face. \"You're welcome. And now I bid you a good night. Good night Jane...\" \"Good night Tom.\" I said as he closed the door on his way out. I first got myself ready for bed before I sat down and started my letter to my sister. \"My dearest Cassandra: You will never guess where I am writing you this letter from...nor what has all happened to me in the course of less than a day... Tom's POV: My words to Jane seemed to have put her at a loss for her own words I realized, for she repeated herself. \"I am so sorry for your loss Tom...The loss of your wife, Jane's mother, your children's mother. Your Jane is truly a delightful girl.\" I could tell that Jane was being sincere when she said that my daughter is truly delightful. For myself, it was a most wonderful sight to see and to know how well my daughter and the elder Jane were getting along. I was about to continue on with how things had been with my daughter upon the death of her mother, but I was interrupted by my servant, Berkley about dinner being served. It would have to wait for another time then. I summoned my guests to join me in the dining area for our evening meal. I purposely awaited for Jane by the door and held out my arm for her to take as she came by, \"Miss Austen?\" I said quietly and with a slight bow. I knew that she was too well bred to refuse to take my arm, knowing that such an act would generally be frowned upon. Lightly, she placed her hand upon my arm and we lead the way to the dining area. I knew as soon as Jane had come to a stop at the doorway of the dining room, what was going through her mind. I felt for her. For me, being here over time had helped to ease the pain of that time when she was here last but it was the first time she had been there since she had left after my uncle's uncalled for actions. \"Are you alright?\" I asked her, sympathetically wishing I could somehow ease her own pain...erase those memories from her mind. \"Yes..I'll be fine.\" She tried to assure me. I understood what she really meant. I had already had it planned out in my mind that Jane was to sit on my right and my daughter would sit beside her. As soon as I finished placing everyone, our meal was served and Henry engaged me in conversation, wishing to catch up with me as we had had no chance to do so yet. It was a conversation that I thoroughly enjoyed for I had always liked Henry's friendship. Finally after we had eaten our fill and there was a bit of a lull in Henry's and my conversation, my daughter turned to ask permission to speak which I allowed. \"If Mr., Mrs. and Miss Austen are to spend Christmas with us in Ireland...couldn't we please have a ball whilst they are there?\" Quickly I looked at the elder Jane whom I saw was also looking at me. Just as quickly, we both looked away, I looked back at my daughter. \"A ball?\" I just barely got out. The request my daughter had just asked for astounded me...the balls at which Jane and I had danced together at came rushing back to me. The first one, I remember watching her dance with Wisley who had inadvertently stepped on her foot. I admit now that I was not very kind, as I tried to hide my laughter...not so much at Jane, but at Wisley and his attempt to dance. My real reason for laughing at the poor fool was that I was jealous...jealous to see him dancing with her. But when that incident happened and I could see that Jane was not impressed with Mr. Wisley, I took it upon myself to search her out and ask her for the next dance. I came upon her, Henry and Eliza talking, she had not seen me yet, but I could hear plainly her abuse of me. I could have been angry with her, but I wasn't for I knew that she was right. I deserved every word she had said about me. I believe that moment was the first moment I realized that Jane was different from any other person of the fairer sex that I had ever known.. At last Henry brought me to her attention...she knew I had heard everything she had said, but instead of turning it into an awkward situation, I took it upon myself to relieve the awkwardness and told her that I would be honoured if she would dance with me next. She accepted and we soon found ourselves facing each other on the dance floor. I felt that we danced well together, but our conversation was one that was...unique. It was during this particular conversation that I discovered Jane's true character which was everything that I had grown to love about her...that she was spirited, independent, and a challenge. By the second ball, we had become more friendly towards one another, but something had happened in-between the two balls...I had learned from my aunt Anne that Mr. Wisley had proposed marriage to Jane. Everyone who had learned of it had expected that because of her situation, she had surely accepted his offer by now...and he had the kind of money that I could not compete with at the time...it was because of this that I could not face her at first, at the second ball. I watched from a room upstairs and had seen her arrive, but I didn't have the heart to go and meet her. But a little later on, when I was with my aunt Anne and young cousin, Lucy had said, \"She should accept him at once.\" I realized that meant that Jane had not in fact accepted Wisley's proposal as of yet. Hope surged into my chest at that moment and I left them to go and find Jane. I saw her on the dance floor with Wisley getting ready for the next dance. I quickly found myself a partner and we joined in. I could only hope that our position in the dance line would mean that her and I would eventually end up together. Luck was on my side. Suddenly we were there together, dancing again. There seemed to be no need for any words between the two of us this time, but I could not take my eyes off of her for very long either...she looked so lovely that night... \"Yes... a Christmas Ball.\" Jane was saying now, bringing me back to the present. \"Please father, we have not had one since mother...\" Here in mid sentence she stopped her flow of words but only she knew why. Before I could say anything, the elder Jane turned to my daughter and said, \"I think a Christmas Ball is a splendid idea myself. If your father approves, of course.\" Trust Jane, I thought to myself, with a bit of smile tugging at the corners of my lips. \"Then a Christmas Ball we shall have.\" I vowed. To dance with Jane again...was indeed a very wonderful thought...and this time, like everything else, it would be different for us. I had to admit that I liked the idea of the Christmas Ball myself. And apparently, so did the elder Jane. \"Thank you, father!\" Jane gushed happily. Before I could reply, Berkley was there announcing the dessert and hot beverages would be served back in the sitting room. I replied to him, dismissing him and gestured for everyone to join me in back in the sitting room. Jane I noticed, grabbed my daughter's hand...I felt she had done that on purpose to perhaps keep me from escorting her back to the sitting room. That was fine with me, I was happy enough with how everything was going. There would be plenty of opportunities to escort Jane. The first part of the evening was spent pleasantly enough with more conversation and music played on the pianoforte between my two Janes. In between there was our lovely light desserts along with coffee and tea to sample and enjoy. When I knew it was time for Jane's bed time, she asked if she might ask a favour of Miss Austen. When I gave her my permission, she asked Jane if she would read for her once more. Jane replied that she would be happy to and told Jane to bring back whatever she wanted her to read. When she came back, Jane patted the empty place beside herself indicating for Jane to sit down beside her and began to read. This time, I merely enjoyed watching my daughter and Jane sit comfortably and companionably side by side. Even though I knew that time was getting on, I decided not to interrupt the two of them but allowed Jane to continue on with her reading as I wouldn't have changed the image of the two of them sitting there together for the world. Even when it was becoming obvious that my daughter was getting sleepy and started leaning more heavily against Jane...my heart was fairly brimming over as I watched the two of them together. Finally Jane realized that she had read for too long and apologized for it. I told her not to worry about it as it had been a treat for all of us. I called Jane's maid Anna in to take her up to bed and gently reminded Jane to say good night to everyone which she obediently did. The four of us continued on with a little more conversation when both Henry and Eliza informed me that they too were ready for their bed. Ah...I had been waiting for this...more time to be alone with Jane. There was more I wished to talk with her about in private. \"Jane...\" I started, but for the second time that day, she cut me off. \"Mr. Lefroy...\" \"Tom...please Jane, call me Tom...I would prefer it. At least when it's just the two of us.\" I begged of her. I wanted her to call me Tom all of the time in fact, but at least we could start with it being all of the time in private. \"Please...It's been a...a lot has happened today and I find that I am quite overwhelmed at the moment and I just wish to retire to my own room for some alone time.\" She told me in a gentle tone. I will not say that I was not disappointed...I was. But I also understood how after a day like today, she would feel just like that. I knew I should honour her request. And tomorrow was another day. She and I WOULD have our chance for some more private talks. I was going to make sure that happened. \"Of course. As you wish. Allow me to show you to your room at least. Your bags have already been placed there.\" I agreed. Jane did allow me this much. I had put her in the same room as the last time. I had hoped that would be okay with her. \"I hope it is alright that you should stay in the same room as the last time.\" \"It's fine..\" Was her reply. She seemed genuinely fine with it. I opened her door, the candles already having been lit by Anna, knowing that we too would be coming soon to bed. \"Good night then Jane..\" I said turning to go towards my own room. Suddenly I heard a quiet, \"Tom...?\" \"Yes?\" I turned back a little eagerly. \"I wish to write a letter to my sister Cassandra to let her know of the change in our plans. Is there still pen and paper in the room do you know?\" \"I haven't actually been in that room for quite some time. Do you wish me to check?\" I offered. Jane stepped aside and allowed me to enter the room where I went over to the writing desk and checked through the cabinets and drawers and eventually found everything she should need for her letter. \"Thank you, Tom.\" She said appreciatively with a smile on her face. \"You're welcome. And now I bid you a good night. Good night Jane...\" \"Good night Tom.\" She said as I closed the door after I quitted her room.[Chapter 9] Once again, I would like to thank everyone who has been reading my story!

I would treasure each and every one of of them and promise that I would respond to them. ;-D Thank you once again! You are awesome! CHAPTER 8: Jane: I didn't know where at first when I awoke the next morning, I had really had fully expected to wake up at my home in Chawton with Mama and Cassandra. I must have been trying to convince myself that the previous day had all been a dream, during the night. Then when I was more awake, I sat up and looked about my room and first thought perhaps I had gone back in time of about 17 years... I got up out of bed and as I did, I noticed the letter I had written to Cassandra the night before on the writing table. I had not yet sealed the envelope so I picked it up, took it out and read what I had written, sitting back down on the bed as I did, finally coming to terms with the truth. I could no longer deny it. I was here, in London with Tom Lefroy at his place. It was at this time that I heard voices from below and hastened myself to get dressed. When I felt myself presentable enough, I placed my letter back in it's already addressed envelope, sealed it and brought it with me downstairs. Tom happened to be standing not too far from the staircase and he looked up when he heard me as I descended. \"Good morning, Miss Austen.\" He smiled as he greeted me with a slight bow. I was surprised to hear Tom being so formal with me again as he had been so insistent that I call him \"Tom\" the night before..at least in private. But perhaps this wasn't private enough then. That suited me fine. \"I hope you slept well?\" He went on. \"Good morning, Mr. Lefroy. Yes, thank you. I slept quite well.\" I answered him returning his bow. Tom now looked down at my hand and noticing the letter he called, \"Berkley!\" who appeared at his side almost instantly. \"Yes sir?\" \"Miss Austen has a letter ready that she wishes to send to her sister. Please take care of it immediately.\" \"Right away, sir.\" I handed my letter to Berkley who bowed to me upon receiving it. \"Thank you Berkley.\" I said graciously. He bowed again before leaving us. Tom held out his arm to escort me back to the dining area where the others were already up and awaiting breakfast. On our way, I couldn't help but ask of Tom as I had been curious. \"Mr. Lefroy...\" \"Yes, Miss Austen?\" \"What about your work?\" Wouldn't he have to work while we were there? \"Whenever Jane visits I always take some time off so that I can be with her.\" Was his reply. \"Of course.\" I should have thought of that. \"I still do have to do some work while she is here from time to time as I cannot neglect it the entire time.\" \"No, I imagine not.\" We had arrived back at the dining area where I exchanged morning greetings with the other three as Tom seated me in the same place as the previous night. It was obvious that we were all to have the same seating at the table for the duration of our visit. Breakfast was a pleasant affair as we all engaged in small talk and Jane listened in. I had wondered if Tom had any plans for his unexpected company or if we would just let things happen as they may. After breakfast, we all stood up to leave the room but just as Tom was about to escort me out, Jane had come up to him. I felt that she wanted to tell or ask him something in private so I left the room and followed Henry and Eliza. It was only a matter of a couple of minutes when both Tom and Jane came up from behind me. \"Miss Austen...\" he addressed me. I stopped and turned. \"Yes, Mr. Lefroy?\" \"I hope you won't find it an inconvenience but my daughter has reminded me of your promise to help her to play the piano. Would it be alright if you give her a small lesson right now?\" I had forgotten all about my promise...well, now was as good a time as any to see how I would fare there. A bit wary, but determined, I replied. \"Of course. Come Miss Lefroy, let us see what we can do, shall we?\" Once again, I took the delighted child's hand into mine and we proceeded to the sitting room. Thankfully, the others politely stayed away from the room, for I certainly did not need an audience for my first piano teaching. I'm sure I would have failed miserably if they had stayed. Before they left us, Tom found us another seat and placed it at the piano. Jane and myself now took our seats. I asked her to show me how much she knew and then I in turn played a small piece for her. During the course of our lesson, I came to realize that Jane was a very good student. She listened well and seemed not only eager to learn, but she was quick to learn as well. I was very impressed with how much she was able to pick up by the end of our lesson. Our lesson ended when Tom came in, giving us applause, slightly startling both of us. \"That will do for one day. You've done very well.\" He said, including both of us in his words. We both stood up and bowed slightly to Tom. Jane then left the room and I turned to Tom. \"Your Jane is a wonderful student.\" I told him honestly. \"She is both eager to learn, and quick to learn.\" \"I think her teacher may have something to do with it.\" He replied gently with a smile. I was feeling quite happy with how well I had done with the lesson but I felt my face get hot at his praise, something I seemed to be doing a lot lately I noted, which caused me become a bit flustered and a bit defensive. \"Oh no, she truly is gifted.\" I countered firmly, wishing to take the attention away from myself on this matter. Perhaps Tom had sensed my awkwardness for he said no more about it. \"Where have Henry and Eliza got to?\" I now asked quickly, taking the opportunity to get away from the topic. \"It is such a fine morning that I took them out back into the garden.\" There was a garden here? I didn't recall one from the last time. But then we had been so busy and...our stay didn't actually last as long as we thought..or hoped it would.. I looked at Tom questioningly. \"Being in the city it's not a big one of course, but there is one back there none the less.\" \"Oh, I should like very much to see it.\" I enthused, where upon, Tom held out his arm for me once again and I took it without even thinking this time. \"Then see it, you shall.\" Tom was right, it was a small garden, but a fine garden with the flowers a couple of trees. Henry and Eliza were even seated at a small white table with four matching chairs. We joined my brother and sister in law. \"This is lovely Tom.\" I replied using his first name without even thinking as I looked around the garden in delight. \"I do enjoy being out of doors whenever possible. I suppose it's because I have always lived in the country near small places and have spent a lot of time out of doors.\" \"Plus you wanted to keep up with your brothers. You always were a bit of a..pardon the term, Tom... but 'Tom-boy', Jane.\" Henry teased me and then also slyly gave me a small wink. I took that to mean that \"Tom-boy\" was supposed to have a double meaning. \"Henry, really.\" Eliza reprimanded him lightly. \"Oh, don't worry about him, my dear cousin.\" I replied gaily. I felt in such good spirits just then, that even Henry's teasing couldn't embarrass me. \"After all Eliza dear, you must remember when Cassandra and I would dress Henry up so that he could have a part in our plays while we were growing up.\" To this, Eliza smiled and nodded he head. \"Ah yes...I do recall that now.\" \"And in fact, he insisted on being in our plays no matter what part he had to take, even if that meant playing the part of a female. I don't recall him protesting at all about being made up to be a girl. Do you Eliza?\" \"No, I confess that I don't.\" She replied with sincerity to which I threw her a grateful look. Apparently, our conversation caught Mr. Lefroy's attention for now he said, \"What pray is this all about? Please do fill me in!\" He insisted, which lead to a jovial discussion of the Austen family's activities whilst we were growing up, putting on plays for our parents and other family members. Henry himself, laughing at his own antics during those days of old. As our conversation of that time in our lives drew to an end, Tom changed the subject and made a suggestion, \"As it looks to be another fine day, perhaps we can all take the carriage after lunch this afternoon over to the park nearby and enjoy the afternoon by having a walk.\" \"I would enjoy that.\" I'm sure my face brightened at his idea. It would be wonderful to be out on such a day. I think I was beginning to feel the need to get out and be able to walk about. Tom definitely seemed pleased to make me happy. Suddenly another memory came to my mind...a...I don't know if \"happy\" would be the correct word, but definitely a \"funny\" one. It would be the second time that Mr. Lefroy and myself would meet, the next day, after my reading. I was out enjoying a walk when I happened to hear a noise in the brush to my right and saw that Mr. Lefroy had also decided to go for a walk. Only...for some reason I could not fathom, he had somehow gotten off of the path and was beating around in the brush not too far away from me. As I had overheard his unkind words in regards to my reading the day before, he was the last person I had wished to talk to, so I kept myself as quiet and out of sight as was possible as I continued on so as not to bring any attention to myself. At one point, I noticed that he had slipped...or perhaps he had tripped and had fallen. I confess that I was meanly glad of this, thought that he deserved it in fact and I would have even laughed out loud at him had I not been trying to keep from his noticing me. However, luck was not on my side and he would spot me. \"Miss! Miss! Miss!\" He had called out trying to get my attention. I had tried in vain to ignore him, but as he kept on calling out to me-and I also didn't want to appear as rude as himself-I gave in, replied as politely as I would allow myself to him and tried to be on my way, but he refused to let me get away that easily... \"Jane? You have such a smile on your face.\" Eliza's voice brought me back to the present. Did I? I was undoubtedly smiling at the memory, but I couldn't tell them that, so I quickly but firmly answered, \"I am smiling at the anticipation of our afternoon walk in the park.\" Tom: I closed Jane's door and thoughtfully made my way back to my own room. I had to admit that I was suddenly feeling a bit overwhelmed at the day's events myself..but it was a feeling that I would gladly take. Everything had gone so well, better than I had thought it would if I am to be honest I couldn't help but think as I got myself ready for bed. But once in bed, I couldn't fall asleep right away. I couldn't help but think...what if I had missed seeing them, only by a few mere minutes or seconds? What if I hadn't decided to take Jane out for lunch today? What if I hadn't followed them? What if they hadn't spotted me? What if Henry hadn't come after me? What if...? These were the kinds of thoughts that were going through my mind. If anything had happened in any other way, or at any other time, I would never have seen Henry, Eliza and Jane at all. I would never have known that they were even in London and they would not be here at my place now. I couldn't help but believe that fate had a hand in this. THIS was meant to be...Jane and I...we had been given the miracle of a second chance. THIS time it was going to happen. THIS time, there was nothing to stand in our way. With this happy thought, I finally drifted off to sleep, also aware of the fact that my beloved Jane slept in a room only a few mere feet away from myself.. The next morning as I awoke before my guests, I aroused myself from my bed and dressed so as to be already for them for when they should come down. Anna had seen to my daughter Jane who was also already up, ready to meet our company. I met her downstairs and we exchanged our good morning greetings. I also decided to see about the breakfast meal. I had just finished consulting with the cook in the kitchen when Henry and Eliza appeared downstairs. We too exchanged our good mornings, then I told them and my daughter to please be seated in the dining area and enjoy some coffee or tea while we awaited Jane and our breakfast. I promised to join them momentarily. I wasn't standing too far away from the stairs when I heard a noise on the stairs. I looked up to see that Jane was also up and about now. I smiled up at her and greeted her, this time reverting back to the formal address. I had been thinking that perhaps I had been a bit too cocky last night in pleading with her to use my first name. I was thinking that perhaps I shouldn't be pushing the \"first name\" idea on her, so I once again addressed her as \"Miss Austen\". I decided that I would follow where she would lead in that direction. After our exchanges were out of the way, I noticed the envelope in her hand and remembered that she had wished to write to her sister the night before. I immediately called for Berkley to take care the letter for Jane and then offering my arm to her, we started towards the dining area. On the way, Jane had asked me about my work. I understood that she was asking if I would need to work while they were there. I explained that whenever Jane was visiting, I took some time away from work so I could spend it with her. Upon arriving at the dining area where Jane exchanged her morning greetings with the other three, I sat her down at the same place as the night before, wanting to make it clear that that was to be her place for every meal at my place for as long as she was there. We enjoyed a lovely breakfast filled with more enjoyable conversation shared between the four of us. After we had eaten our fill, I gestured that we remove ourselves from the room. I admit that as my guests were unexpected, I hadn't any plans as to what we should do to entertain ourselves, but at that moment, my daughter pulled me aside and asked of me quietly. \"Do you think it would be okay if Miss Austen helps me with the piano now, father?\" Ah, now here was something. After all, Jane had promised and as there was nothing else planned for the time, it might be an idea. I now called out to Jane. \"I hope you won't find it an inconvenience but my daughter has reminded me of your promise to help her to play the piano. Would it be alright if you give her a small lesson right now?\" She looked just slightly surprised...she may have forgotten about her promise. But I knew Jane well enough to know that she would never go back on a promise. She didn't disappoint me. \"Of course. Come Miss Lefroy, let us see what we can do, shall we?\" She replied, taking my daughter by the hand and led her into the sitting room where the pianoforte was. I realized then that they would need another chair and went to fetch one for them. I watched them sit down together at the piano, and then politely retreated from the room. I figured that they wouldn't need an audience to distract them from the lesson as much as I would have loved to have listened in. It was then that I thought of showing Henry and Eliza the small, but lovely garden out back while my two Janes were busy at their lesson. They readily agreed and I lead the way out back. \"Why this is delightful, Tom!\" Eliza exclaimed looking around my garden. \"It is small, but as it's usually only myself or myself and Jane, there is no need for it to be bigger.\" I replied. \"There is a small table and some chairs where we can sit down at and visit some more.\" I said as I lead the way over to the table and chair set, where we all sat down, this time Henry and myself engaging in an amicable discussion about politics. I had not told them yet, but I was considering becoming part of the Parliament back in Ireland once I was re-settled there and I was interested in Henry's view points. I also encouraged Eliza to partake in the conversation, which she did occasionally. I found it quite interesting to talk with Henry about politics and the time had passed swiftly. I had hoped for that so that I could call my two Janes away from their music lesson. When Henry and I had discussed it as far as we could for the time being, I told Henry and Eliza that I would go and fetch Jane from the lesson ask her to join us. I could hear music playing on the piano when I entered the house and moved towards the sitting room. I couldn't help but just stand in the doorway and watch the two of them sitting companionably side by side at the piano, making music together, as I had pictured in my mind the previous day when my daughter Jane had asked if \"Miss Austen\" would teach her to play like herself. I allowed them to finish the song and as much as I would have loved to have just stayed there and let them continue on, I knew that Henry and Eliza would wonder at what was taking us so long...so regrettably, I clapped my hands in appreciation (and to let them know that I was there) and told them that was enough for one day and that they had done very well. My two girls stood up and we all bowed slightly to one another and then my daughter left the room giving us a few moments alone. Jane turned to me and praised my daughter's playing. \"Your Jane is a wonderful student. She is both eager to learn, and quick to learn.\" \"I think her teacher may have something to do with it.\" I replied honestly with a smile. \"Oh no, she truly is gifted.\" Jane said blushing a bit. I could tell that my words had embarrassed her and as I did not wish to make her any more uncomfortable, I didn't say anymore. Jane took this opportunity to ask where Henry and Eliza were. I explained that they were in garden in the back of the building. I noticed the puzzled expression on her face and realized that she hadn't even known that we had one. Of course...the last time I was never really given the chance to show it to her... \"Being in the city it's not a big one of course, but there is one back there none the less.\" I explained. \"Oh, I should like very much to see it.\" She eagerly told me. I of course was more than happy to show it to her. I held out my arm and was pleasantly surprised that she should take it without any hesitation this time. \"Then see it, you shall.\" I remarked as I lead the way. Once outside, we went straight over to where Henry and Eliza were sitting. \"This is lovely Tom.\" She remarked after I sat her down. I was happy to hear her use my first name this time. \"I do enjoy being out of doors whenever possible. I suppose it's because I have always lived in the country near small places and have spent a lot of time out of doors.\" She carried on. I had known that...when I was visiting my aunt Anne and uncle George Lefroy near their place, I came to see for myself how the people living in the country enjoyed being out of doors. They also liked to walk a lot...something I was not at all accustomed to at the time. But I came to appreciate the value of the outdoors and exercise while I was there. Perhaps this was even a bit of Jane's influence on me. It was also the reason why I had decided to buy a country home in Ireland, not too far outside of Limerick so that I would still be close to my work but would have a big garden with plenty of space in which to enjoy the country. And it proved to be a good thing to have for my children as well. I could see how it also benefited them. Thinking about this gave me an idea... While I had been thinking, I had barely caught what seemed like Henry teasing Jane, but Jane, as usual was quick to tease him back with a statement that caught my attention. \"And in fact, he insisted on being in our plays no matter what part he had to take, even if that meant playing the part of a female. I don't recall him protesting at all about being made up to be a girl. Do you Eliza?\" \"What pray is this about? Please do fill me in!\" I exclaimed with interest. I had never heard about the young Austen children and their play. I listened with interest and laughed good naturedly along with them. It was the most I had heard Jane laugh in quite some time... When this particular conversation seemed to be coming to an end, I brought up my idea to the rest of them. \"As it looks to be another fine day, perhaps we can all take the carriage after lunch this afternoon over to the park nearby and enjoy the afternoon by having a walk.\" Jane's face fairly glowed with this idea which pleased me to no end. \"I would enjoy that.\" she assured me with a smile. I smiled back at her. I was glad that I was doing some things right again in regards to her. The Austen children really did spend their time putting on plays for their family/friends. (What else do you do back in the days long before electricity and all of the technology of today!). Tom Lefroy did become a member of Parliament in Ireland, along with his successful career as a lawyer. ADDITIONAL NOTES:[Chapter 10] CHAPTER 9: Jane's POV: Young Jane came out to join us at about this time. As there were no other chairs, Tom elected to go back into the house and brought another one out. Once we were all seated, Tom asked of his daughter. \"What do you think about having a walk in the park this afternoon, Jane?\" \"That would be wonderful father, I should like that very much! Oh and father...\" \"Yes, my love?\" \"Perhaps we might have pic-nic there? Like we do at home sometimes when we take our tea out of doors in the garden?\" Tom looked at Jane. \"Hmmm...\" He appeared to be in thought as if contemplating this, but I noticed that \"twinkle\" in his eyes and the upward tug at the corner of his lips. Watching the two of them together since meeting them yesterday, I could see just how much he loved his daughter. Again, I couldn't help but feel just a bit jealous of the fact that Jane was not Tom's and my daughter, but Tom's and Mary's even though I was honestly sorry for her demise. \"I think we might be able to manage that!\" Tom finally agreed, although I knew he was all for the idea, the second that Jane had brought it up. \"Oh thank you father!\" So thanks to young Jane, it appeared that we had some plans for the afternoon. It did indeed sound pleasant, the idea walking in the park and then having our tea in the form of a pic-nic there. A thought suddenly occurred to me how much Jane and myself seemed to be alike. How very odd, I thought...but in a good way. I did like to think that we were alike, Tom's daughter Jane and myself. I smiled at this thought. If she couldn't be my daughter, perhaps it was just as good that we were alike in personality. After some more casual conversation, we eventually arose from our places and went back inside to do as we pleased while Tom said he would notify his staff of our plans to have tea in the park that afternoon. I wandered about the house a little bit and came across a small library which doubled as Tom's office, I was pretty sure as there was a work desk in the room as well. I couldn't help myself, I went in to have a look at what kinds of books Mr. Lefroy (both uncle and nephew) had lining the shelves, as I was curious. I expected that for the most part, they would be law books, but perhaps there were others as well. I placed my hand upon their bindings and gently ran my finger tips along the titles as I read them, losing myself in what I was doing. As I expected, a lot of the books were about law but not all of them. I started coming across some titles that were works of fiction as well. These ones interested me. I took a book out of it's place here and there to thumb through it to see if I could see what it was about, to see if it might interest me to read it some day. I have no idea how long I had been doing this when Tom's voice startled me out of my activity. \"Have you found anything of interest, Miss Austen?\" I fairly jumped out of my skin at Tom's voice. \"Mr. Lefroy!\" I exclaimed, startled, turning to face him. Suddenly, I felt ashamed. I had not asked him permission to be in this room. I lowered my eyes from his gaze, blushing once again, then cautiously I looked up at him again. He was leaning against the door jamb with half a smile on his face. \"Oh...I...am...I do...\" I started off stammering a bit. \"Please forgive my intrusion Mr. Lefroy, I do apologize. I had noticed the books in this room and I just couldn't help myself. I had to come in and see what titles you have. I apologize for not asking for your permission first.\" I bowed slightly. Tom now came towards me still smiling. \"No need to ask permission, Miss Austen.\" He said softly. \"You are always welcome in my library at any time.\" \"But it is your office...your work room.\" I protested. \"And I am not working in it at the present. Even if I was working, I want you to know that you are still welcome to come and look.\" I didn't know what to say to his kindness. \"Have you found anything that interests you?\" He now asked of me. \"There are a couple of books that have caught my interest, yes.\" I admitted. \"Then you must take them with you and read them while you are here. And in fact, as we will be getting together for Christmas, you are welcome to keep them if you have not finished with them by the time you leave for home. You can return them to me upon your visit to Ireland.\" \"Oh Tom, I couldn't...\" I objected, forgetting once again to be formal in my surprise. \"Of course you must.\" He countered me firmly. \"I insist.\" As I couldn't think of any objections to his offer, I accepted. \"This is really very generous of you Tom. I do thank you.\" I said sincerely. \"You are most welcome of course.\" He replied. There was a moment of silence when Tom spoke up again. \"Jane...?\" \"Yes?\" \"I have read your book 'Pride and Prejudice'.\" Now I gaped at him open mouthed in amazement. Never in the world had I ever even dreamed that Tom Lefroy might read a book such as 'Pride and Prejudice'. \"You have?\" I asked rather weakly. \"Yes. And I will say that I thought it was very well written. I thoroughly enjoyed it.\" Gathering my wits somewhat, I returned with maybe just a bit of sauce, \"It's no Tom Jones...\" recalling the time that he had caught me in his aunt's library (after I had spotted him reading a book in the same library) going over her books. He had picked out a book by Tom Jones for me to read as he felt that my \"horizons needed to be widened.\" Upon reading it, I would have to say that the author's book did indeed \"widen my horizons\" somewhat. Tom actually chuckled at these words before replying, \"No...and I would hope not as you are not Tom Jones.\" I received the compliment with a silent bow of acknowledgment. \"I found one character in particular quite interesting...\" I found myself holding my breath...I had the feeling... \"Your Mr. Darcy...\" I knew it... \"He's an interesting character. He seems rather...shall I say, familiar to me.\" There was that twinkle in his eyes again, I noticed. \"Jane...I don't want to sound arrogant, but...I have been wondering since I read it. Is Mr. Darcy...\" Tom stopped here as he seemed to be searching for the right words. \"Did you...\" Another pause. \"Is Mr. Darcy...supposed to be...me, by any chance?\" There it was. I had got the idea for \"Pride and Prejudice\" when I was here last and had started writing it even, only I had called it 'First Impressions' at the time. And as I continued to write the story afterwards, I confess that I didn't realize it at the time I was writing it, but I did notice afterwards when I had re-read it that the way I introduced Mr. Darcy in my book did indeed resemble my first impression of Tom Lefroy. I couldn't deny it then, that Tom had been a bit of an influence on my Mr. Darcy. But I could not change my character, in fact I didn't want to change him...I never, ever dreamed that Tom Lefroy would ever read it, thereby picking up on that fact. Of course I also never, ever dreamed that I would be in Tom Lefroy's library 17 years after we had parted, actually discussing my book with him. But I wasn't about to let him know that. Once again, my foolish pride kicked in and I replied. \"If there is any resemblance between yourself and Mr. Darcy, Mr Lefroy it is strictly coincidental.\" I said with full confidence, holding my head high. \"I see...\" He replied with a rather amused expression on his face. I wondered about that... \"Well if you have picked out a book or two, perhaps you are ready to leave the library. You are welcome to take the books upstairs to your room if you wish and then if you are ready, we shall leave for our walk and pic-nic in the park.\" I was quite relieved when Tom suggested that we leave the library and get ready to leave for our afternoon outing. I gladly accepted his arm as he escorted me to the bottom of the stairs where I rushed up to put my book selection on the table in my room for later reading and then to freshen myself up. Tom's POV: I was thoroughly enjoying our visit in my garden when my daughter came out to join us. As there was only four chairs I had go into the house bring out another. I sat my her between Jane and myself and then asked her what she thought about taking a walk in the park with us in the afternoon. As I knew she would be, she quite enthused about the idea. Then she came up with another idea, that I also liked. To have our afternoon tea in the park, like we have done on occasion back in Ireland. It was something that Mary had started with the children when they were younger. On as many of the nice days during summer that we would have, Mary would insist on having our tea outside with the children. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to join them in all of those nice days as I would be at work for some of them, but I did partake in as many as I could. It had become a bit of a family tradition for us and I enjoyed them as much as the rest of my family. After our tea we would encourage the children to play games and I would join in with them. As there always seemed to be at least one child that was too young to join in our fun and games, Mary was happy enough to sit on the blanket taking care of the infant while watching the rest of us, me being just as much of a child as my own children. I enjoyed being able to act as carefree as a youngster during that time with them and my children also seemed to love it when I was \"one of them\". I was in complete agreement with the idea of a pic-nic and in fact, I already knew the ideal spot in which we should have it as I have taken many walks in that park myself whenever I am in London and am in need of taking a break from my work. I found that taking a nice slow walk helps me to relax. It helps to clear my head of my work or I would even take a walk just to think... With Jane there, I was feeling very happy and even rather giddy so I couldn't help myself when I teased my young Jane a bit by trying to pretend that I had to seriously think this idea over while before telling her that we should be able to manage it. Over the years since Jane's birth, I had come to realize (especially lately) that she was suitably named as she reminded me of another Jane. Something, when I had insisted upon the name for her, I never thought was possible. But my logical side tells me that the reason for that is because Jane Austen and myself are also so similar in some ways that my daughter likely inherited that part from me. However, that other part of me (some might refer to it as the \"romantic side\") likes to believe that she is very much like the elder Jane in personality more than myself... After we had exhausted our conversation out in the garden, I decided that I had better inform my staff and particularly the cook of our plans to have our tea in the park so that a suitable basket of food could be made up for it. We all of us entered the house and I told the others to do as they pleased while I talked to my staff. I was a little while in consulting with the cook about food (whom I sure thought I was a bit off about the pic-nic idea as I had never done this before) before I went on to search out Berkley (who also gave me a bit of a look but being the good, loyal servant he is, asked no questions and went straight to the task when I assigned him) to find a basket or hamper of some sort for the food as well as a couple of blankets for us to sit upon and eat in the park. Once this was accomplished, there was nothing more for me to do so I decided to go to my office when I stopped suddenly at the doorway, seeing that Jane was in there browsing through my bookshelf. It reminded me of another time when I came across her in my aunt's library... Not really wishing to disturb her or the moment, I just stood leaning in the doorway and allowed her to continue to look. I couldn't help but smile as I watched her. She was so attentive at what she was doing...what she was looking for...but I couldn't stand there and stare at her forever either. After several minutes, I felt like I was invading her privacy and I knew I either had to leave quietly or say something. \"Have you found anything of interest, Miss Austen?\" I found myself saying instead of leaving her in peace. Obviously, I had startled her when I didn't mean to. I felt a bit guilty for it when she turned to me and was blushing and then started to stammer in her surprise. But then she found her voice and apologized for not asking for my permission to be in that room. I assured that she did not need to ask me for permission, that she was welcome in my library at any time. Even if I was working. I was touched that she seemed a bit overwhelmed by this so I quickly asked if she had found anything of interest to which she replied in the positive. \"There are a couple of books that have caught my interest, yes.\" she admitted. \"Then you must take them with you and read them while you are here. And in fact, as we will be getting together for Christmas, you are welcome to keep them if you have not finished with them by the time you leave for home. You can return them to me upon your visit to Ireland.\" \"Oh Tom, I couldn't...\" she protested, catching me by surprise this time by using my first name. \"Of course you must.\" I countered firmly. \"I insist.\" Jane seemed to be trying to think of ways in which she should object to my offer, but then she finally accepted. \"This is really very generous of you Tom. I do thank you.\" Was her response. I knew it was heartfelt. \"You are most welcome of course.\" I replied just as genuine. Here we both fell silent for several seconds. Being in the library, it had made me think of her own book 'Pride and Prejudice' and something I had found rather fascinating when I had read it...and I had wondered about it ever since. Now that I had her alone, I had to ask...I HAD to know... \"Jane...?\" I now ventured to ask. \"Yes?\" \"I have read your book 'Pride and Prejudice'.\" Jane stared at me open mouthed in astonishment. \"You have?\" she asked rather feebly. \"Yes. And I will say that I thought it was very well written. I thoroughly enjoyed it.\" I told her in all my honesty. \"It's no Tom Jones...\" She returned more firmly having gotten her wits back, with a statement that took me off my guard this time. I couldn't help but chuckle at the memory..\"No...and I would hope not as you are not Tom Jones.\" I told her kindly. As Jane remained silent, but gave me a bow in acknowledgement, I decided to jump right into what I had been wanting to know since I read the book.. \"I found one character in particular quite interesting...Your Mr. Darcy...He's an interesting character. He seems rather...shall I say, familiar to me.\" Once I started, I found that it was suddenly hard to go on and ask her as I realized that I might sound rather egotistical. But I had started, so I had to continue...besides...I really still wanted to know. I had wanted to know for too long now. \"Jane...I don't want to sound arrogant, but...I have been wondering since I read it. Is Mr. Darcy...\" I stopped as I tried to think of the best way to say this. \"Did you...\" I paused again searching for the right words. \"Is Mr. Darcy...supposed to be...me, by any chance?\" I watched Jane closely as she worked out in her mind what I had just asked of her...she seemed to be either thinking really hard or perhaps fighting within herself as to how she should answer me. Finally came her reply which, I must say, wasn't all that surprising as knowing her the way I do, I kind of had the feeling that she might answer in the way she did. \"If there is any resemblance between yourself and Mr. Darcy, Mr. Lefroy it is strictly coincidental.\" She said with just a bit too much self-assuredness which lead me to believe that I was right. Mr. Darcy WAS me... But as I didn't wish to push her (once again) I dropped the subject. Ah...back to being formal again, I noted quite amused. \"I see...Well if you have picked out a book or two, perhaps you are ready to leave the library. You are welcome to take the books upstairs to your room if you wish and then if you are ready, we shall leave for our walk and pic-nic in the park.\" I continued and then offered her my arm again which she took rather quickly as we quitted the library together. I left her at the bottom of the stairs and watched her ascend them rather quickly to her room. I couldn't help but smile up at her disappearing form.[Chapter 11] The first part of this story is drawing near it's end so you will notice in this chapter that I have skipped ahead in time around the middle of it. ;-D As I was writing this chapter, I started to realize just how long it was becoming and decided instead of there being one big long chapter, I would give Jane and Tom a chapter of their own. Thank you once again to those who have added my BJ story to their Favourite Story List/Story Alert! Those actions say more to me than words ever could! ;-D CHAPTER 10: Jane: Even though I was ready, I purposely took my time and then waited in my room until I heard Henry and Eliza's voices so that I wouldn't be alone with Tom again. I wasn't afraid of being alone with him, I just felt a bit unsettled at the fact that he had read Pride and Prejudice and had seen right through Mr. Darcy's character. I didn't want to have to face him about that and discuss it with him right now...or ever if at all possible. I could only hope that he wouldn't bring it up to me again. I cautiously stepped out of my room, looked around and then made my way to the stairs as I knew that Henry and Eliza were already downstairs and descended them. \"Ah, there you are Jane.\" Henry said upon seeing me coming down. \"We were beginning to wonder about you. Tom told us that you found some books to read. We thought perhaps you had gotten lost in reading one of them.\" \"Not yet.\" I replied quickly. \"But I hope to tonight.\" Apparently, the carriage was already laden with our pic-nic essentials-thanks to Tom, Henry and Berkley who had packed it up while I was in my room \"getting ready\". We all set off then, a rather merry group for the short ride over to the park. Once we were there and all out of the carriage, we were all needed to help bring everything. Tom had told us on the way that he knew of the exact spot where we should have our pic-nic, so when we were all ready, we set off following Tom. He took us to a spot off the beaten track where there were plenty of trees for shade yet, we could be in the sun if we wanted. There was also a small brook bubbling nearby. We spread out the blankets, putting half in the shade and half in the sun. The two hampers were set down and Eliza and myself along with Jane's help emptied the contents in the middle of the blankets. We picked out our spots where we were going to sit and then started helping ourselves and each other to the food and drink and merry talk. It turned out to be an absolutely splendid idea, having our tea on a pic-nic like this...I was thoroughly enjoying myself. My good spirits from earlier on in Tom's garden returned to me and I had practically forgotten about the incident in the library. After we had eaten our fill for the time being, Eliza, Jane and myself started putting everything back in the hampers so that nothing would happen to any left over food that we might want to have as the afternoon wore on. It was while we were doing this that I saw Henry stretching out to lie down on his back. I happen to looked over at Tom and noticed that he decided to take Henry's idea as he too stretched out, only on his side instead of his back, supporting his head with his hand. I had never seen him look so casual in this way before. We had been fairly formal with each other since meeting the day before. There was something about this casualness of Tom's that made me notice him even more...it was when he caught me looking at him, that I realized I had been gazing at him. He smiled at me and smiling back faintly, I brought myself back to my task. Something was stirring in me once again..or perhaps it had continued to stir since the first moment I had spotted Tom. My mind was suddenly full. I didn't know what to do...what I should be thinking...how I should be feeling...things were going very well between us and I couldn't deny that I was enjoying my time in London with young Jane, Henry and Eliza...and of course Tom. I was starting to find that it was getting harder to keep my feelings from surfacing...I had been trying so hard to keep them squashed down deep inside myself so that I would not have to face them. But this was getting harder and harder to do...and Tom...was not helping me in that regard either. \"You know...\" Henry suddenly spoke up. \"It's too bad we don't have enough people to play a game of cricket.\" \"Do you play cricket?\" Young Jane asked Henry now. As everything was casual, Jane knew she was allowed to speak a little more freely amongst us. \"I've been known to play a game or two in my life\" He replied smiling at Jane. \"How about you young Jane? Have you ever played?\" \"Girls don't play cricket, you're teasing me.\" She replied with a grin. \"Oh, that is where you are quite wrong, Miss...just asked my sister.\" He said nodding to me. There he goes again, I thought to myself. Jane now turned to me in astonishment. \"YOU play cricket Miss Austen?\" \"Only when I was younger Miss Lefroy, because as my brother once said, I...well myself and my dear sister Cassandra only had brothers to play with while we were growing up. They would put on plays with us, but only if Cassandra and myself would agree to play cricket with them.\" \"Oh come on Jane. You enjoyed it! You were good at it too, don't deny it!\" Henry persisted with a grin, while I shot him an irate look. That was when Tom decided that he had to jump into this conversation as well. He sat himself up and said, \"Ah, but you didn't only play it when you were younger Miss Austen...don't you remember a certain game you willingly joined in...oh...about 17 years ago?\" \"You were there father?\" Jane now asked Tom, wide-eyed. \"I was not only there, we were playing together.\" He told her. \"You played cricket with Miss Austen?\" Okay...THAT was it...time to settle this matter. \"Oh I'm afraid that your father has it wrong, Miss Lefroy...your father didn't play WITH me...\" I answered rather sweetly. Jane gave me a puzzled look. \"He played AGAINST me...\" Jane continued to gape at me, so I leaned down close to her ear and said, none too quietly for I wanted Tom to hear, \"And you know what? I BEAT him too.\" I made sure I spoke very clearly too. At these last words, she literally gasped. \"You beat my father? At cricket?\" \"And quite handily, if I may say.\" I couldn't resist adding on, throwing Tom a bit of a self-satisfied smirk. \"It's too bad that we can't have that re-match.\" Tom remarked now, with a bit of a teasing smile on his lips. \"I'm sure I could still take you in a re-match, Mr. Lefroy.\" I replied feeling rather cocky. \"Well perhaps one day, we will have to have that re-match.\" He returned good naturedly. \"But as we can't do that today, I have an idea. I had promised a walk in the park but as we can't all walk together and leave our things here, I suggest that we take everything back to the carriage and send it back home. Then we can have our walk in the park and walk back home from here. It's not that far, I have done it myself. And when we get back home, we can replenish ourselves with some more of our pic-nic food. In fact, maybe we can sort of continue on with the pic-nic idea and enjoy it in the garden. We should take advantage of the good day while we have it.\" As everyone was in agreement with this idea and after we had all decided that we had relaxed enough, we gathered everything up and headed back to the carriage with our pic-nic essentials and loaded it in. Tom spoke to his driver about our plans after which he left with the carriage and headed back to Tom's place. Tom then took his daughter's hand and without even thinking, I took her other hand and we three lead the way, Henry and Eliza following us. It was quite pleasant, the five of us strolling leisurely along in the park, Tom taking us to various parts that he knew about from his own time spent walking about in it. We admired the nature that the park had to offer us in the way of the various plant life as well as wildlife. Even though we seemed to spend a fair amount of time in it, it still came to an end all too soon for myself and we were once again out into the busy-ness of the city. \"I can see why you would want to spend some of your time in the park Tom, where it's so much more quiet and peaceful.\" I addressed him once we had left it. \"Yes...I admit that I have become quite attached to more quiet, peaceful surroundings. If it wasn't for my work, I would not be in the city at all now. But that is where I have no choice. However, I am glad that I have a country home in Ireland where I can return to after I have finished my work for the day, at least.\" Was his reply to me which I agreed with. We carried on and eventually reached his home to which we were all rather glad to be back at by this point as we were hot, tired and a bit dusty from having to walk beside the city streets. We all went to freshen ourselves up once again and then met outside in the garden to \"replenish ourselves\" with more food and drink as Tom had suggested we do which was gratefully accepted by us all. That night, just before retiring to my bedchamber, I found myself going back out into Tom's garden as it was still lovely out. It seemed to be drawing me to it...but I discovered that I desired to be alone with my feelings and thoughts for a few minutes too and I felt that my room wouldn't suffice this time. The moon was out and I found myself staring up at it. I found it rather odd how another memory crept into my mind at this point...but I squashed it as quickly as it surfaced...I wouldn't...I couldn't... After a little, I was just thinking about going back in to my bed when I heard him. \"Jane...\" He approached me quietly, almost as if cautiously. He stopped beside me, looked at me (I was still gazing up at the moon, but I could tell that he was looking at me out of the corner of my eye), then followed my look. \"It's beautiful, isn't it...\" He stated, didn't ask. \"Yes...\" was all I said in agreement with him. \"It reminds me of another night...another time...\" He began. I felt my heart quicken a bit at the mention of that night...WAS that the night he was thinking of? I wondered.. \"You must forgive me Jane, I look back at that time very fondly of course, but also some anger. If it hadn't been for Wisley and hi...\" \"Mr. Wisley is an honourable man! We are friends still!\" I was quick to cut Tom off. He didn't know! Of course! Tom didn't know that Mr. Wisley was NOT the person who had sent the letter to his uncle! How could he know? I must straighten this out immediately. Tom started at me in shock. \"You and Wisley? Are...friends? Jane? But...how...?\" I held up my hand to Tom and explained. \"It wasn't Mr. Wisley who sent that letter...nor even his aunt.\" I heard Tom gasp. \"But...who then...\" I sighed and replied, \"It was John Warren.\" Tom had a puzzled look on his face. \"John...Warren?\" He repeated. He didn't remember him? \"He is...I mean WAS an old friend of my family's...he came back with you and Henry when you came out to stay with your Aunt and Uncle.\" Tom was thoughtful for a few more seconds before he finally remembered. \"Ah...yes.\" He replied. \"But...why would he write such a horrible letter?\" Again, I sighed before explaining. \"Because...John was jealous of you, Tom..\" \"Jealous? But why?\" \"When I came home after leaving you, John was at our place. Not long after my arrival back home, he proposed marriage to me. It didn't occur to me right away, but within seconds of his proposal, it dawned on me. It was then that I accused him of writing the letter and...he didn't deny it...instead he said that I must have realized how much he had always loved me...I was so angry that I almost struck him myself. He left our house right afterwards and we've not seen nor heard from him since.\" \"And good riddance!\" Tom exclaimed passionately. I couldn't help myself...I had to smile at Tom who smiled back when he looked at me again and said gently. \"But look...here we are again after all.\" Henry, Eliza and myself spent a couple of more enjoyable weeks in London with Tom and Jane before we decided we must be getting back home, especially as we would be spending more than a couple of weeks in Ireland soon, as it was further away from us than London. I was glad that nothing further really happened between Tom and myself during that time. There were days Tom had to work but the three of us took it upon ourselves to entertain young Jane for which I knew Tom was grateful. On our last night there, just before retiring to my bedchamber for one last time, I found myself going back out into Tom's garden as it had been another lovely day and I wanted to take one last ramble in it by myself before leaving...I also found that I needed to be alone with my thoughts as I realized how much I was going to miss being here...something at one time I never would have found myself actually believing. I walked down the path, stopped and stood at the same place as I had the last time, but there was no moon this time. I realized that I felt...content and even happy being here, although I wasn't sure that I should be allowed to feel this way... After a peaceful interlude, and much like that second night in London, Tom's voice broke my reverie. \"Jane?\" He called out to me as he approached and then stopped when he reached me. \"I've really enjoyed having you here.\" He said but before I could reply, he went on. \"And so has Jane. I've watched the two of you together...and I've been observing her. I told you before how hard Mary's death was on her. But I never had the chance to tell you more. After Mary died, Jane, being the oldest daughter took it upon herself to be a 'mother' to her younger brothers and sisters, even though my own sisters have been there to help raise them. Jane had always helped Mary with the younger children and I think that after Mary passed away, Jane felt that she should be the one to continue on being their mother as Mary couldn't anymore.\" I looked at Tom in sympathy for his daughter who should be enjoying the kind of life a girl of 13 years should be...not being a mother and raising her own siblings. \"THAT is why I have her come to London with me sometimes. To get her away from the children for awhile and what she seems to feel she HAS to do. To give her some time to BE the girl her age should be...to NOT be a parent. She's become...so serious at home...not like a child anymore. I miss her being her age. She's growing up so fast as it is, that I can hardly bear to watch her like this. She'll be an adult soon enough...\" He said, his voice becoming a bit emotional as he explained the situation to me. \"I realize that it's not unusual for girls her age to help raise the family...or even actually raise a family when the mother had died, but in some cases, they don't have a choice...Jane does. Her aunts are there, but she refuses to sit by and let them do the job of her mother. It breaks my heart to see her in this way...\" I nodded at Tom my eyes getting a little misty at what he was telling me. \"I have been watching you and Jane...she is more like the Jane I knew before her mother died...with you.\" He continued in a soft voice. That did it...my eyes were becoming more moist now.. \"I am SO glad that you agreed to come to Ireland for Christmas. That time of year has been a very hard time for us, particularly for the children, as much as we try to keep it as festive as we can.\" \"Of course, Tom.\" I finally managed to get out, my own voice full of emotion in my understanding. \"And now...if I might ask it of you...could you please go up and see Jane...she is upset that you will be leaving tomorrow.\" \"Oh..of course...I would be happy to talk with her.\" I agreed. I turned away to leave when Tom suddenly said in a soft voice, \"I'll miss you Jane...when you go home again...\" I had stopped momentarily when I heard these words...my heart skipped a beat, but I had no idea how I should respond to that, so I allowed Tom a slight bow in acknowledgement so that he would know I had heard him and then left him to go up to Jane's room. Outside her bedroom door, I knocked gently and then announced myself asking if it would be alright if I could come in. I entered upon receiving an affirmative response from her. I went to her bed and sat down upon it. I could see that her cheeks were wet. My heart went out to her. \"Oh dearest...what is this about?\" I asked of her gently taking the handkerchief she had been using and wiped at the tears on her face. \"You are leaving tomorrow...I don't want you to go..\" Jane told me straight out. \"I'll miss you.\" \"And I shall miss you too!\" I exclaimed honestly. I really was going to miss her...I had become quite attached to her myself, although as with my feelings for Tom, I had been trying my best to squash them. I couldn't get too attached...I shouldn't...then I thought about Jane...it was even worse that she should become attached to me, perhaps...but I knew that it was too late already. \"Really?\" She replied \"Of course I shall! BUT...\" I told her firmly but kindly. \"We must NOT think of this as a sad parting, but a happy ending as we have shared some good times together. AND...we will be getting together at Christmas too don't forget. And your father promised us a Christmas Ball.\" I watched Jane's face light up as I reminded her of this. \"So yes, we may have to part for a bit now, but think of it in this way. The more days that pass while we are apart, the closer each passing day brings when we will be together again.\" \"I like that thought.\" The young girl told me. \"Good.\" I smiled at her. \"Now...come...sit up for a moment.\" I gently requested her. \"This is what I want you to do for me while we are apart. I want you to practice your piano playing (they had a piano at home in Ireland as well, I had found out) and those songs I taught you, for when I return for Christmas, I will expect you to be able to play them for me. Do you think you shall?\" \"Oh yes, Miss Austen.\" She replied happily. \"Good. I know I can trust you to do as you are told and as you say. Also...\" another idea had come into my head..\"When I return for Christmas, what you and I could do is learn to play some songs together...some duets.\" I heard a gasp at this but I went on, \"And...maybe even some Christmas songs that you and I could play for your family. Would you like that?\" \"Oh Miss Austen, I would love that! I promise I will practice a lot!\" \"I know you will dearest.\" I replied softly. \"One last thing...if you would like, when I return home I shall write you a letter.\" \"Really?\" Jane replied almost unbelieving. \"Really. I do promise to write to you.\" \"Would you like a letter from me?\" Jane now asked. \"I would not only like one, I expect one from you.\" I couldn't help but smile at her. \"Oh, I will write one for you Miss Austen! And..thank you!\" \"You are very welcome. But now it is time for you to get some sleep. But first, I would very much like it if I could give you a good night hug.\" Jane looked at me in surprise, but then put her arms around my neck while I encircled her body with my own arms. \"Good night dearest. Pleasant dreams.\" I said softly. \"Good night Miss Austen..\" She responded, happy again before she got back down into her bed and I covered her with blankets. I blew out her candle and left the room, closing the door behind myself. I was about ready to go to my own room when I noticed Tom just arriving at his own door. He turned to me and beckoned me over to him. \"How is she?\" He spoke in a low voice. \"I believe she will be fine now, Tom.\" I replied. \"How can I thank you Jane..\" He said. \"The trick is to give her some things to do to keep her busy and give her some things to look forward to.\" I explained to him. \"Thank you...very much...\" He repeated sincerely. \"You're welcome of course.\" We both stood there in silence for a few seconds before I finally said, \"Well...I should be on my way to bed as well. Good night Tom.\" \"Good night Jane.\" The next day, Jane accompanied Tom and us three to meet the stage which would take us home and upon our inevitable departure, I hugged Jane and told her, \"Now remember what I told you last night...this is NOT a sad goodbye, but a happy parting for we will see each other soon again. Each day will bring us closer to being together again. And don't forget to practice your piano and you can expect a letter from me very soon.\" I promised. \"See you soon, Mr. Austen, Mrs. Austen...\" She turned to me now, \"..Miss Austen...and thank you for..everything.\" \"See you soon Miss Lefroy and thank you for everything.\" I told her with a smile. \"Miss Austen?\" Jane addressed me. \"Yes?\" Suddenly she seemed shy. \"What is it child?\" I encouraged her. \"I was wondering...if you would...could you call me Jane? Instead of Miss Lefroy?\" I was somewhat surprised by this, but I think I understood why. It had something to with what Tom had alluded to the night before...how she was more like herself when I was around. Being referred to as \"Miss Lefroy\", even though is a customary title for the eldest daughter, it also suggests that she is not a child, but older. By being referred to as \"Jane\", it suggests that she is still young enough to be a child...not a responsible parent that she felt she must become in place of her mother. I smiled down at her and said in a gentle tone. \"If it is what you wish, I shall be honoured to call you Jane.\" \"Thank you Miss Austen.\" Jane beamed. \"You're very welcome..Jane.\" Tom and Henry shook hands and Eliza held Tom's hands in her own and gave him a small kiss on the cheek. When it was my turn, Tom and I slightly bowed to one another. \"See you in a couple of months, Jane..\" He said giving me a smile. I returned the smile and said, \"See you...Tom.\" These were our parting words and gesture this time which was better than the last one...knowing that this time we would see each other again... Henry and Eliza now boarded the stagecoach, then Tom helped me up and I joined them. \"I shall meet you in Limerick at the end of November, then.\" Tom said to us after I was seated and the door had been closed. As soon as the stage was starting to leave, we all called out friendly \"see you soons\" to one another and to Jane I indicated to be happy that we will be together and that there was plenty to look forward to. Lastly, I looked at Tom who was looking back at me with a look that I had come to notice a lot of during the course of our visit...it was a look that I would take back home with me...but I was afraid to let my heart and mind accept that look for how I interpreted it...[Chapter 12] CHAPTER 11: Tom: While Jane was up in her room, I called upon Henry and Berkley to help load up the carriage with our food and blankets that was now ready. We were finished loading before she appeared so we waited for her at the bottom of the stairs. She wasn't much longer and we were soon off, our joviality from the morning in the garden seeming to continue on in the carriage. During our ride, I told them about one of my favourite spots that I go to when I take my walks in the park. Once we arrived and had all alighted, everyone pitched in to bring something as we were all needed to carry something. I then lead the way over to a place where there were plenty of trees for shade and a nearby brook. It was one of the places I loved to come to for various reasons...whenever I am working on a particularly puzzling case or just feel like some solitude. As we had two big blankets, we placed them so that half would be in the shade and the other half in the sun. Eliza, Jane and my daughter then opened up the hampers and spread out the food and contents on the blankets where upon, once this one done, we all helped ourselves to it, continuing our lighted-hearted conversations. I couldn't but glance over at Jane quite a bit during this time as I love watching her when she looked so contented, happy and being animated. I had noticed Henry lying down on his back once we had filled ourselves to contentment. It looked like a good idea, stretching out after a fill of good food, so I followed suit, only I stayed propped up on my side. At this point, the women folk took charge and started putting everything away for the time. It was while they were clearing up, that I noticed Jane was looking at me...really looking at me as if for the first time...or the first time in a long time at least. I couldn't help myself, I smiled at her. I realized that I must have taken her a bit by surprise as she seemed a bit stricken at first (I'm assuming because I had seen her looking at me), but did me the honour of returning my smile with a rather wan one of her own, then quickly returned to her work. It was here that Henry brought up the idea of cricket. I have to admit I had no idea why he should think of cricket just now, what might have triggered the idea, but I was a bit amused. He had caught the attention of my daughter though and now that she knew she was allowed to be more casual here with us, she asked him about it which turned into a conversation about girls and cricket. Now...I was a bit suspicious of Henry bringing up cricket...I hadn't forgotten that friendly game we men were playing when I was staying at my Aunt Anne's and Uncle George's...the families of those involved in the game had come out to watch us. My team was doing quite well against Henry's when suddenly, while I was pitching, Jane had strolled rather determinedly up to the pitch with bat in hand. I remember hearing Henry yell out to me to take it easy on her. As she had taken myself (and everyone else by surprise), I couldn't resist teasing her just a bit and kept moving back as if intending to throw a very hard ball towards her, but in the end, I jogged back to the pitch slowly and threw her a gentle ball to which on her very first try, she connected with it and sent it sailing into the trees. I couldn't believe my eyes as she started running back and forth while I finally found my feet and took off to retrieve the ball... I couldn't help but smile at this memory. That was another moment when I realized that Jane was different from any other woman I had ever come to know. She had shown me her spirit and independence that I so admired of her once again. I think maybe that might have even been when I started to really fall for her although at the time I was not about to let her know...I could be just as stubborn in that way as she was back then, I suddenly realized... I was brought back to the present by Jane saying that she only played cricket when she was younger, with her brothers. Ahhh...I was not about to let her get away with this. I sat up and in a friendly voice, I reminded her that she had quite willingly joined us in a game 'only' 17 years earlier. Apparently, the idea of Jane and myself playing cricket together fascinated my daughter. But Jane was not about to let me off quite so easily either as she then told my daughter in no uncertain terms that we had actually played opposite one another and that she had beat me and threw me a triumphant look as she said so. The knowledge of this took my daughter by complete surprise who couldn't believe that Jane had beaten me at cricket. Because of these two, I couldn't resist throwing a cricket re-match challenge out there, wondering if Jane would take me up on it. She did...sort of, by saying that she could beat me in a re-match any day. So I said that we would have to have a re-match one day then. (And I would not forget her words, little would she know...). As we had decided to go along with Jane's idea of the pic-nic in the park, I realized that it would kind of pose a problem for all of us talking our walk together. I would have loved to have walked alone with Jane, just the two of us, but I also knew better than to push her in that direction just yet. I could have 'coerced' her into it, by pointing out the truth of the situation, that we would have to take our walks separately so that someone could stay with our hampers and blankets. But I knew that Jane would prefer it if we could all walk together so I came up with the solution that we put everything back in the carriage and send it home. Then we could all take a leisurely stroll through the park and walk home from there as it wasn't really that far. I figured that it shouldn't pose a problem for anyone the walk home, as I knew that the Jane, Henry and Eliza, would have taken further walks at times at their home in the country. When we decided that we were ready for our walk, we gathered everything up and took it back to the carriage. I explained to my driver what our plans were and told him he could take everything back home and that we would be along eventually. After I dismissed him, I took my daughter Jane's hand into mine and noticed how Jane took hold of her other hand. It was a gesture that pleased me, but I made no comment about it. We set off with Henry and Eliza following us. We took our time in the park but eventually, we came back out to the city street where we walked a bit faster as of course it was not as enjoyable to walk along as the park was. We were grateful to return to my place so that we could re-freshen ourselves and then we all met up in the garden again after where we could conclude our pic-nic. That night after we adults decided it was time to retire for the evening, I went around the house to make my rotutine last minute check on everything when I happened to notice that Jane had slipped out of the house and was wandering in my garden. Perhaps it was wrong of me but I couldn't help myself...I watched her from one of the windows inside. She stopped at the far edge of the garden and just stood there, the full moon shining down upon casting somewhat of a silhouette upon her body. I realized that she had gone out there to spend some time alone but I stayed where I was...I was transfixed...there was something about watching her when she didn't realize I was present... Eventually, I brought myself back around as it had been hard to find some time alone with her, between my daughter and Henry and Eliza and I didn't want to pass up any chances. So I waited until I hoped I had given her enough time for herself before I myself stepped out. I was cautious to approach her as I was still unsure of my timing. \"Jane..?\" I asked cautiously. It was here when another memory flashed through my mind...of another night from the past and along with it...happiness...and then pain and anger. It took me by surprise. I had something completely different in mind to talk to her about but when I saw Jane standing in the moonlight and then approached her, the memory of me finding her in Wisley's garden at their ball on my last night there and our talk and how I had offered a way for us to be together...all we needed to do was impress (and ultimately convince) my uncle...here I stopped the memory and brought myself back to the present. I had been looking at her while this was playing through my mind, but she didn't look back at me, so I followed her gaze up to the moon. \"It's beautiful, isn't it...\" I said, my former talk completely gone from my mind. \"Yes...\" she agreed. \"It reminds me of another night...another time...\" I couldn't help myself, now that the memory had come forth so vivid. I had to get it out. \"You must forgive me Jane, I look back at that time very fondly of course, but also some anger. If it hadn't been for Wisley and hi...\" I was surprised when Jane cut me off and rather quickly to say. \"Mr. Wisley is an honourable man! We are friends still!\" I stared at Jane in complete shock. HOW could Jane be FRIENDS with that...that...jealous fiend after he had intentionally hurt us by his actions! \"You and Wisley? Are...friends? Jane? But...how...?\" I managed to get out. Jane now explained to me that, what I had believed all of these years, was not true after all. She gave me another name...John...Warren? I puzzled over the name for several seconds. He was the one wrote the letter? The name...sounded a bit familiar, but I couldn't quite place it. Jane came to my rescue when she realized that I was having trouble recognizing the name. \"He is...I mean WAS an old friend of my family's...he came back with you and Henry when you came out to stay with your Aunt and Uncle.\" It took only a few more seconds before it finally registered with me. Henry had introduced me to him when we were in London. I had referred to him as a \"sour faced little virgin\" to Henry at the time...and then Henry and I decided wordlessly that the 'sour faced little virgin' was most likely lacking as far as \"women\" was concerned and was in desperate need for some \"attention\" that would surely take that \"sour\" look off of his face. When I look back at that time in my life, I am not proud. If I were to have an excuse for my rather randy behaviour, it would be that I had to become the sole provider for my family which was rather large, having 11 siblings altogether and the pressure fell on me to help them out. I was the sixth child but the first born son so it was up to me to help provide for my family. My uncle was good enough to give me the opportunity to pay me an allowance (some of which I would send to my family) while I studied law under him. I appreciated that he would do this for me and I know now that I had become rather cocky with the idea of living in London and being paid while I studied. I was still young with the big city at my fingertips and lving with only an uncle whom I discovered was easily fooled if I wanted to go out with whom I called at the time, my \"friends\". These \"friends\", I ended up meeting were other young men who showed me what they had referred to as \"the good life\" that \"every young man should enjoy while he could\". It ended up becoming my own lifestyle for awhile because it allowed me to escape from having to become the provider of my family, something I wasn't ready to deal with yet, but I had no choice...I had been forced in to. This was my way of rebelling against it, I could say. This was also why I didn't want my daughter to have to \"grow up\" so quickly...because I had to and it had been a negative experince for me...It was during this time that I had also met Henry...the one and only one of that group whom I stayed friends with. It was this time in my life when I met John Warren... And when I met Jane, that was when everything started to change for me. I realized that I no longer wanted that kind of life for myself. That there could be a better life, one that I would rather enjoy... Bringing myself back to the present, I can see now that trying to introduce John Warren to that kind of lifestyle was a mistake...a costly mistake that both Jane and myself ended up paying for...but...it still made no sense to me...why would John Warren send the letter? Did he hate me so much for doing that to him? But then he definitely did come off as being very straight-laced. He most likely would have thought that Henry and myself were trying to corrupt him. But still...was that why he wrote that letter? And why was it aimed at only me? Did Henry receive one too? It still didn't make much sense to me so I questioned Jane about it who explained that John Warren was jealous of me because he had always loved her. Oh..now at least it was starting to make sense. When Jane said how she almost struck him herself when she found out and said that they had not seen John since, I couldn't help but be amused but outloud I exclaimed passionately, \"And good riddance!\" I was happy to see Jane smile at me when I said this so I smiled back and went on, \"But look...here we are again after all.\" Because after all...as much as I believe that Jane and I were meant to be together, perhaps in some way John had done us a favour all of those years ago. There is no guarantee that my uncle would have allowed our union. We will never know. And if he hadn't allowed it, without it, life undoubtedly would have been very difficult for us had we gotten married anyway...both of our families may not have had anything to do with us. We would have been on our own. And I don't know how I could have not continued to provide from my own family. As much as I rebelled against having to be their provider, I also loved them dearly and would not...could not have left them to fend for themselves. And then...there are my children...I love my children. And I wouldn't give them up for the world. Even though Jane and I had been cheated all of those years ago, we have been given a second chance. A better one...one where we no longer need anyone's blessing or help. We could easily be together now. The next couple of weeks fairly flew by when Henry announced that as much as they had enjoyed their stay in London, they really had to think about going home. I couldn't believe that the time had come already when we must part ways once more. My heart had dropped a bit when he told me of their impending departure, but I reminded myself that we would all be together in a matter of a couple of months...and if all went well at Christmas...but I stopped my thinking there, for I was didn't want to jinx what might happen in the future. I just had to keep myself positive. The night before they were to leave, Anna came to me after putting my daughter to bed. \"Mr. Lefroy...I think you had better go up and see Miss Lefroy...\" She started. I was instantly alert. \"What's the matter? Has she taken ill?\" I asked suddenly concerned. \"No no, she's not ill...but she is upset. I think she might need you.\" \"Thanks Anna, I'll go and see her straight away.\" I left her and rushed up to Jane's room where she was already in bed, but it was plain she was, as Anna had said, upset. I walked over to her bed and sat down on it. \"Hey love...Anna said you are upset. What's wrong?\" I asked softly-I had an inkling of what might be wrong-gently placing my hand on her cheek. \"Oh father...Miss Austen...she leaves us tomorrow! I...I don't want her to go!\" Here Jane actually started sobbing. As I held my arms out to her, she sat up and threw herself at me. I encircled her body with my arms and held her close to me. \"I know. I don't want her to go either.\" I confessed to her. I now pulled her away from myself so that I could look at her face while I spoke. \"We have had a good time while they were here, haven't we.\" I stated rather than asked. \"Yes..\" Jane agreed quietly. \"And we'll see them again..for Christmas.\" \"I know...but it seems like such a long time from now. And...what if...what if something happens where they can't come? What if they change their minds?\" She kind of had a point there...things COULD happen...but...they HAD to come. Suddenly I felt as desperate at Jane about their visit to Ireland. But there was one thing I was certain of and I reassured Jane about this now. \"They won't change their minds, love. Of that, I am very sure of. If something happens...well, we'll just have to wait and see first IF anything does happen. They can always postpone their trip. It doesn't mean that they can't ever come to Ireland and visit us.\" Jane was quiet as she thought about this. I could tell she still wasn't overly happy, she wanted more assurance from me about that, as did I. But I didn't know what else to offer her in that way, because things COULD happen...one just didn't know. \"We MUST be positive about this Jane. We must think positive that it will all work out.\" I told her firmly, as I took her hands into mine. \"Okay?\" She nodded and gave a small, \"Okay..\" back to me. \"Good. Now settle back down love and try to get some sleep.\" Somehow I doubted that she would be able to get a good night's sleep, I wasn't sure I would be able to either...I kissed her goodnight and made ready to leave her room when an idea came to me. \"Would you like it if Miss Austen came and said good night to you Jane?\" I asked before I blew out her candle. She seemed to brighten a bit at this and replied, \"Oh please father..I would like that very much, yes.\" I nodded my head and giving her a smile, I said, \"Okay...I'll go and find her.\" and left the room in search of her. She wasn't in her room as her door was open and there was no candle burning, so I went back downstairs to check the other rooms. I was puzzled when I didn't find her..until it dawned on me to check the garden. She liked to wander in it just before retiring for the night sometimes if it was warm enough. As there was no moon, it was harder to see out back so I opened the door and looked around. I spotted her in her usual spot and strolled out to meet her. \"Jane?\" I called out as I approached as I approached her. It was somehow easier to say exactly how I was feeling in that moment, in the darker setting. \"I've really enjoyed having you here. And so has Jane. I've watched the two of you together...and I've been observing her.\" It was true. I had purposely been watching the two of them interact together as I was hoping that they would get along well. They had seemed to hit it off from the moment they met and I was truly grateful for that. I now went on to further explain to Jane about how my daughter Jane had reacted to her mother's death. I was getting a bit emotional recounting it for her because it really did pain me to see my daughter who had been so fun loving, carefree and happy become this serious, matured girl practically over night. I could see that Jane too was getting emotional as I spoke, which touched me deeply. I made sure to let her know how very happy I was that they were going to be spending Christmas in Ireland with us and the past couple of Christmas's had been hard on the children. \"Of course Tom.\" She agreed quietly. It was here that I asked her if she would mind seeing to Jane as she was upset at her leaving the next day, which she readily agreed to. As she turned to leave, the words \"I'll miss you Jane...when you go home again...\" came out of my mouth before I could stop them. She stopped and then gave me a slight bow in acknowledgement. I knew I couldn't expect anything more from her upon my bold statement. Unbeknownst to Jane, I followed her up to Jane's room and watched and listened from the shadows in the hall to their conversation. I felt a lump start to form in my throat when Jane suggested that they might learn and then play a duet at Christmas for my family...and then the promise of exchanging letters. While I was watching the two of them, another memory rushed into my head. Not about Jane this time, but about my daughter and her mother. Only this time, in my memory, the roles were reversed. It was my daughter who was sitting on the bed comforting her mother...when Mary lay weak on the birthing bed...and ultimately, her death bed. I frowned slightly at the memory. Suddenly, I realized something...Jane had never cried when Mary died. She never cried at home, not at the funeral...not afterwards...not that I was ever aware of at least. As I stood there in the shadows, I also realized that Jane knew...she had known Mary was dying. She had already started becoming the 'mother' while Mary lay dying... Jane asking my daughter for a good night hug brought me around. It was a beautiful scene that was playing out before me as I watched the two of them hug for the first time. My two Janes said their good nights to one another and then the elder Jane blew out the candle and started walking towards the door. I quickly brushed the tears that had threatened to wet my cheeks away from the corner of my eyes and started for my own room. I heard Jane shut my daughter's door, so I turned around and asked how she was doing so that it would appear I had just arrived at my own door. \"How is she?\" I asked in a low voice. \"I believe she will be fine now, Tom.\" Was Jane's reply. \"How can I thank you Jane..\" I said, my emotions still a bit high from watching and hearing the two of them. \"The trick is to give her some things to do to keep her busy and give her some things to look forward to.\" She explained to me. \"Thank you...very much...\" My gratitude was very heartfelt. \"You're welcome of course.\" We both stood there in silence for a few seconds before Jane finally said, \"Well...I should be on my way to bed as well. Good night Tom.\" \"Good night Jane.\" I couldn't think of anything to keep her from going to bed, my own mind and heart was suddenly full. The next morning arrived all too soon for me, knowing that Jane, Henry and Eliza were leaving. But I wanted to keep my daughter's sprits up about their inevitable departure so I acted as light-heartedly as possible. The two of us accompanied them to the stage where Jane took it upon herself to hug my daughter and remind her to not be sad about their parting but be happy that we would all be together soon. She also reminded her that she expected her to keep up with her practice on the pianoforte and to expect a letter from her soon. I was surprised when my daughter asked Jane if she would call her by her first name instead of her 'title name' of Miss Lefroy. But it told me something...that Jane was comfortable with the idea of Miss Austen being a...\"mother figure\" to her which I will not deny, is was something I had been hoping for. I was also thrilled that Jane was \"honoured\" to call her Jane if it is what she wished. Henry and myself shook hands, while Eliza placed a kiss on my cheek. Jane and myself merely bowed politely to one another. \"See you in a couple of months, Jane..\" I said smiling at her. \"See you...Tom.\" She returned my parting and smile. It was all we said to one another as all that was in my heart at the moment had already been said the night before...that I had enjoyed her being here with us and that I would miss her while she was gone. Henry and Eliza were already on the stage and Jane allowed me to help her up onto it this time. \"I shall meet you in Limerick at the end of November, then.\" I said to them after closing the door and before the stage started leaving. As it did, we all called out friendly \"see you soons\" one last time. Jane and my daughter exchanged one last gesture, then lastly, Jane and I looked at each other until the stage disappeared around a corner and out of our sight. I put my arm around Jane as we watched it disappear, then both of us silently made our way back to my carriage which would take us back to a rather empty and quiet house. To help take the sting out of the notable silence and emptiness, I would have Jane practice her piano. And I would get both of us out of the house as much as I possibly could as we waited for the months that separated us all to pass us by until we would all be together again. End of Part of 1 Starting with Part 2, as much as I do love writing from Tom's Point of View as well, you will (most likely) be seeing less of his. The reason being that I think it will be even more repititious than the first part was if I continue to do from his POV as well as Jane's and that would just end up being a little bit (more?) monotonous. There will still be some POV from him where I deem it necessary/important for the reader to understand some things, just not (nearly) as much as there was in the first part. At this point, all I can really say we'll have to wait and see what ends up happening, but be prepared for seeing less of Tom's POV in the second part. -D The reasons why he was in the first part as much as he was, was because: 1). To establish his thoughts and feelings about Jane 2). So that I could show how I interpreted those certain scenes from the movie I used in Part 1 from his POV and 3). To help the readers understand certain things from his own life, such as the naming of his own daughter Jane, how the picnic idea came about and a fair few of those other little tidbits that were mentioned along the way. I would not have been able to show those things without having him bring it up in conversation somewhere with Jane-or with someone else who would bring it up later to Jane at some point-if I had written it in only Jane's POV and I felt that these were important to the story. ;-D[Chapter 13] I purposely held off posting this chapter a couple of days as my kids have their Teacher's Convention this week which means that starting tomorrow, they have four days off and I am not sure how it will work out for me being able to get on the computer to write and post. (I SO need to get my own portable lappy or even just a word processor so that if this computer is being used, I can still at least continue to write. ;-D ). This chapter is not the beginning of \"Part 2\" but more of an \"Interval\" between Part 1 (London) and Part 2 (Ireland) and is only the one chapter. ;-D CHAWTON (Summer 1815) CHAPTER 11: Jane: I didn't speak very much on the way back home as I found my mind wandering over the events of the past couple of weeks. Henry and Eliza seemed to realize this and although I would add my own comment from time to time when I happened to catch something they were talking about, they didn't otherwise try to engage me in their conversation for which I was grateful. The further away we got from the London, the heavier my heart seemed to become although I had definitely taken away some fond memories of our visit with Tom and Jane. As well, it did help me some knowing that we would be going to Ireland for Christmas. I couldn't help but think what mama would say to the idea of three of her family members going so far away at Christmas time. Somehow I didn't think it would be favourable, but at least I wasn't going alone. She would definitely have forbidden me that of course, not that the idea of going by myself is even an option. I was sure that Henry and Eliza would be able to convince her to let us go and without much (with any luck, ANY) fight from her. I would leave it up to them then. That was most likely the best thing I should do as I'm sure if I were the one to bring it up to her, it would be met with a lot of resistance. When we finally pulled up at home, no surprises, my sister Cassandra was already outside awaiting our arrival. One good thing about coming home was seeing Cassandra again. I had missed her terribly. I fairly jumped from the carriage, ran over to her and threw my arms around her. \"Oh Cass! How I have missed you!\" I exclaimed in all honesty. As much as I adored Eliza, I was looking forward to being able to talk with my sister about some things...as I was sure she would be wanting to do as well. And after all, Eliza and myself never really had the chance to talk amongst ourselves while in London anyway. Here, Cassandra and myself could go for walks and talk everything out without raising any suspicions. And we would also be able to talk at night in our bedchamber. \"And I you, of course dearest Jane.\" was her reply to me. She greeted both Henry and Eliza as well as they were to stay at our place and rest before carrying on to their own place. In the meantime, I grabbed my bag as Cassandra came back over to me. We linked arms and walked in this manner towards our house together. We met our mother just inside the door, who had been on her way out to greet us as well. As we hugged, mama greeted me without any preamble, \"What's this Cassandra said about you staying at Mr. Tom Lefroy's place in London?\" Ah, I had wondered how mama would feel about that considering how she and my father had felt about Tom when they had noticed that we seemed to be becoming close all of those years ago...and then of course neither of them had been very pleased that he and I had started to run away together. As we entered the house together, I put my bag down and took off my bonnet. I turned to look my mother straight in the eye when I spoke. \"It's true mama...we ended up meeting up with Mr. Lefroy and one of his daughters in London, where all of us happened to be attending a recital one afternoon and he invited the three of us to stay at his place for the duration of our trip.\" \"But you were to return home before now.\" She pointed out. \"Yes, that is true mama.\" Henry now spoke up quickly. \"But once we were settled at Tom's place, he encouraged us to stay longer and visit with him as it had been many years since we had seen each other last.\" \"His oldest daughter was visiting him in London as well, which is how she came to be there.\" Eliza put in as we all made our way to the sitting room. Cassandra had filled our mother in with as much information-with the exception of the more personal things of course-as I had given her myself in that one letter I had sent to her for now mama said. \"I find it a bit odd that Anne never mentioned the passing of Mr. Tom Lefroy's wife before...nor even of his starting up a law practice in London.\" \"Anne and I had a silent agreement that she would not talk about Tom to me, mama...remember?\" \"But those Lefroys had no trouble staying quiet about how successful a lawyer he had become.\" She returned resentfully. \"I think we can forgive them for being proud of him for his accomplishments, mama.\" I countered. \"Oh how they liked to brag about how well he had married too!\" Mama sniffed. \"In marrying him, it makes one wonder about her.\" \"Mama!\" I spoke a bit sharply, oddly enough, feeling the need to defend poor Mary. \"Do not speak ill of the dead! Tom spoke very well of Mrs. Tom Lefroy. She was a very kind, loving and devoted wife and mother.\" \"I wonder that he deserved such a fine woman then.\" Mama shot back spitefully. \"Mama! Tom Lefroy deserved as fine a woman as she was, as much as you feel your own sons would!\" I fired right back. I could tell that nothing had changed with her. But then, I didn't really expect it to. She had had it in for Tom from the moment we all first met...and even before Tom and I had left together. \"Tom is a fine man.\" I carried on, determined to defend Tom as well. \"You should have seen what a wonderful father he is with his daughter. If he is like that with one of his children I expect that he is like that with all of them.\" Suddenly mama did something unexpected. She stopped arguing with me. \"You are right Jane.\" She sighed, surprising a bit deflated now. \"I shouldn't be so hard on Tom. He has done very well for himself and no one should take that away from him, least of all me.\" I was taken aback by this sudden change in my mother's attitude. It left me speechless so I acknowledged her with a slight bow of my head. All at once, I felt quite fatigued and excused myself to go upstairs, unpack and re-freshen after our trip. I had already unpacked and was just sitting on my bed staring out of the window when Cassandra knocked and entered the room. She came over to the bed and sat down beside me and put her arms gently around my neck. \"It's so good to have you home again Jane.\" She told me in her soft voice. I smiled and said, \"It's good to be home again, Cass.\" \"Is it? Really?\" she asked me. In my astonishment, I turned to see that she was completely serious when she asked that. \"Of course Cass! I missed you!\" I insisted. \"Jane...\" Cassandra now took my hands into her own. \"You must forgive our mother. She...she was actually quite upset for you about what had ended up happening between you and Tom.\" \"You mean she was upset WITH me for what had happened between myself and Tom.\" \"At first...of course both mama and papa, God rest his soul, were upset about that. This all came out when I told her that you were staying with Tom in London. She told me that...after we had learned of Tom's marriage, she never wanted you to know this, but she was upset because she knew how much you were suffering about everything. We all knew. She was also upset to hear that Tom had married \"well\". \"He had to marry well Cassandra...it was the only way he was able to continue to provide for his parents and siblings at the time.\" I explained. \"He could only rely on his uncle's allowance for so long.\" \"I know...\" Cassandra replied softly. \"But don't forget that mama herself married \"down\". She knew what they really meant about Tom marrying well, that we Austens were not good enough for him...or them. The Lefroys.\" \"We weren't...and probably still aren't, Cass. We never can be...will be good enough for them. We may as well face it.\" \"Nonsense! Would you like me to re-read the letter you sent from there? Jane...it's obvious that Tom still has feelings for you. I could tell when I read that letter. He invited you to stay at his place. He invited you back for Christmas! You even told me that he said he had never forgotten you. That...he still loved you.\" Perhaps I shouldn't have gotten so carried away and told Cassandra that, how Tom had said that he still loved me, I now lamented. Perhaps I had been too quick to tell her that. \"That all seems so long ago and far away now that I am back home Cass. What if he didn't mean it?\" \"Didn't mean it? He would not have invited you to go to Ireland and spend Christmas with him and his family if he didn't mean it!\" She insisted. \"But...what if it's like we have already said...what about his family Cass? They never thought we were good enough for him and I doubt that has changed.\" \"But obviously Tom doesn't think like rest of the Lefroy's, Jane...not George, Anne nor his uncle anyway, and he is the one and only one who should count.\" \"But it DID count when his uncle was alive.\" I countered obstinately. \"It's a different situation now, Jane. His uncle is no longer living and Tom is no longer depending his uncle and being depended upon by his family...except his children now of course. And he is much more well off now than he was at that time in his life.\" Cassandra reminded me. \"I know you still have feelings for him as well. I could easily read that by the way you wrote your letter to me. WHY must you be so stubborn about this?\" I stood up and walked over to the window and stared out for several seconds before I turned to my sister, tears gathering in the corners of my eyes and threatening to fall. \"Because I am so afraid of going through the pain of losing him again. I'm afraid of my feelings for him because of what I went through the last time. We didn't get together last time...what if something happens this time too? Maybe it will turn out that it just wasn't meant for us to be together.\" Cassandra stood up and came over to me, then embraced me with a smile. \"And maybe...just maybe, you were meant to have a second chance with a certain Irish friend of yours by the name of Mr. Tom Lefroy.\" \"I am so afraid to hope for that Cassandra.\" \"Oh dearest Jane...let me tell you that I am not at all afraid to hope. I am quite confident about it myself.\" She let me go then, went over to her dresser and searched around in one of the drawers for several seconds before she produced an envelope. Still smiling, she handed it to me and said, \"Perhaps you should read what you have written Jane. You may see things differently if you do. Here...you hang onto it and read it when you are ready to.\" Cassandra held my letter out and hugged me once again. Taking the letter in my hand, I said, \"Maybe I don't deserve to have Tom...to be with him and...be happy with him. If anyone deserves that kind of happiness, it's you Cassandra.\" \"There is no way of bringing back loved ones from the dead.\" She replied with a bit of emotion in her voice for her own long dead fiance , Robert Fowle. ** \"You love him still.\" I stated softly, sad for her to still be in love with the man you were going to marry years ago, but one whom she never did get the chance to marry and could never now...a man who had been dead for 17 years. \"I do...I always will. I have no desire in my heart to love any other except Robert even though he is gone from me. But what keeps me going is that I truly believe that we will be together again.\" She answered. I understood what she meant. \"But you...you do have a chance...and you do deserve this happiness Jane. I believe that it was meant to be.\" I didn't know how to reply to that as I was unsure if I believed that as much as she did. I looked down at the letter in my hand and then exclaimed, \"Oh my! I almost forgot! I promised to write young Jane a letter when I got home!\" I was glad for the distraction. \"What is young Jane like?\" Cassandra now asked of me. \"Aside from what you told me of her in that letter. Surely you came to know her a little better over the past couple of weeks.\" I smiled as I filled my sister in on what I thought of young Miss Lefroy. But this time I also added what Tom had told me about her the night before. \"Oh, the poor dear!\" Cassandra exclaimed sorrowfully when I finished. \"She sounds lovely. From what you have said about her, I should like to meet her myself one day. I hope that will be possible.\" I smiled at Cassandra but didn't answer as I wasn't sure how...or if I even dare answer that one. I found a quill, ink and paper and sat down at my desk and started writing my promised letter to Jane so that I would be able to send it off in the morning and Cassandra left me to my task. Dearest Jane: We all have arrived safely back home and as hard as it was to have to part from you this morning, I admit that I was very glad to see and be with my dear sister Cassandra again. I have told my sister all about you and you know what she told me? That she hopes that one day you and she shall be able to meet. I also hope that might happen one day as she is as dear to me as you have become to me and I do believe that you and Cassandra would get along splendidly... I did wonder if I was right in saying that I hope that she and Cass might be able to meet one day as I have no idea how possible that would be, but I had written that as I wanted to make her feel better for our parting of the ways. There wasn't too much more I could say as we had just arrived home from seeing them, so I filled it in as best as I could with an account of our journey and that my family was well. It was a rather short letter but I had promised her a letter and I do not go back on my promises. I did end it with greetings to her father and hoping that they were both well. I re-read it, put it in it's envelope, sealed it and took it downstairs with me so that it would not be forgotten the next day. Henry and Eliza were to stay for dinner but would leave right afterwards and I knew that we had to bring up Christmas in Ireland while they were there so I took Henry aside and told him that if we were to take Tom up on his offer, that he would have to be the one to bring it up to mama. He agreed with me and told me that he would take care of it. I was starting to feel a bit anxious that Henry still hadn't brought it up while we were eating dinner. I kept trying to catch his eye at the dinner table to signal him that time was running out. Finally, he saw me and returned my desperate gesture with a slight nod of his head, which told me that he understood me. I relaxed somewhat then. But it wasn't until our dessert when he finally brought it up. \"Mama...\" he began. \"Tom has been very generous and invited myself, Eliza and Jane to spend Christmas with him and his family.\" He paused here only momentarily. \"At his home in Ireland.\" He finished off. I quickly looked over at my mother who had a stricken look on her face. I really couldn't say that I blamed her. \"What?\" She fairly whispered. \"My family does not wish to spend Christmas with their mama?\" \"It is not that we do not wish to spend Christmas with you of course.\" Eliza now tried to comfort our mother. \"But we felt that as Tom has made us this offer, we may not get another chance.\" \"And of course you will still have some of your family, mama.\" Cassandra now added. \"I think you should let them go, as Eliza just pointed out, they may never get another chance.\" I threw Cassandra a grateful look for her input. She smiled and gave me a slight wink in return. \"Besides...we have already accepted Tom's offer mama. We can not really go back on it now.\" Henry pointed out. This angered my mother greatly. She got up from the table and flounced out of the room without a word to any of us. Henry stood up and said to the rest of us, \"I'll go talk to her...don't worry...\" The three of us waited in a rather subdued manner, none of us hungry anymore for our dessert. It seemed like forever but it was only 10 or 15 minutes later when both my mother and Henry re-entered the room, mama on Henry's arm looking much more composed than when she had left. He sat her back down in her chair and then returned to his own. \"Of course you must go to Ireland for Christmas.\" She now said with astonishing calmness. She even looked over at me and smiled...a genuine smile. I smiled somewhat weakly back, puzzled. I knew that Henry had the power to influence my mother, but now I couldn't help but wonder exactly what he DID say to her to convince her...I must ask him... When Henry and Eliza made ready to leave, I once again took Henry aside and asked him. \"What exactly DID you say to mama to convince her to let us go?\" Henry smiled at me and replied with just two words. \"The truth.\" The truth? The truth about what? Now I was even more puzzled than ever. But I could not question Henry on it any further right now as they were ready to leave and everyone had gathered around to see them off. How frustrating! This wasn't the end, there was still plenty of time for me to find out WHAT Henry had said to mama... In the weeks that followed, Cassandra and myself took numerous walks together. Sometimes we talked about Tom, sometimes we talked about anything but Tom. I treasured these times with my sister. There were times when I really needed her to convince me that what had happened with Tom in London had been real for as time went on, it really did start to feel like just a dream. Was Tom really back in my life? I was still afraid to believe it myself... One day, a letter arrived back from Jane. I smiled when I saw it on the table just inside the door and opened it up fairly quickly...and just as quickly, I sat down, the smile on my face turning to astonishment. I read..and re-read the letter before jumping up and yelling out, \"Cassandra! Cassandra! Where are you? Come quickly!\" Cassandra ran to where I was, \"What is it? What is wrong?\" But instead of talking I just handed her the letter to let her read for herself. She never would have believed me if I had told her anyway. She needed to read it for herself. Like myself, she too had to sit down, \"But...I don't understand!\" She exclaimed looking up at me frowning. \"I think I do.\" I replied. \"When I wrote my letter to young Jane I had told her about you and how you had said you wished to meet her one day. She must have told Tom who has now extended his offer of having you come with us! Oh Cass! Isn't it splendid? We shall be able to spend Christmas together in Ireland! I am so happy! Of course you must come!\" \"But what about our mother, Jane? I cannot leave her alone over Christmas.\" Objected my sensible sister. Of course she was right. My heart dropped a bit as I realized this...I had really wanted her to come with us. Then, \"We must call upon Henry and Eliza. Henry will know what to do. And he can also talk to mama again about it.\" I was determined that my sister should come with us. \"You do want to come with us, don't you Cass?\" I pleaded with her. \"How could I not want to spend Christmas with my sister in Ireland.\" She said with a smile. I was overjoyed. \"We must take this to Henry as soon as possible for we should not wait too long before replying.\" I knew I would be able to rely on Henry who was indeed able to convince our mother to let Cassandra join us. It was agreed upon and eventually arranged that our mother would spend the time away with one of our other brothers and his family. I sent off my reply to let the Irish Lefroy house-hold know that there would be one other guest for Christmas, my sister. As for myself, I still needed to find out what Henry had said to our mother to convince us to go in the first place... **Robert Fowle- Was the name they gave Cassandra's fiance in the movie \"Becoming Jane\" and according to the book \" Cassandra and Jane \", she really was engaged but his name was \"Tom Fowle\" which made me wonder if they changed his name in the movie in order to not have two Tom's, maybe to make it less confusing. As I have based my story on the movie, I decided to keep his name as \"Robert\". ;-D[Chapter 14] My apologies! I realized too late that I had put \"Chapter 11\" for my last Chapter (Chawton), but it really is Chapter 12. (Ooops...). So here we begin our \"Ireland Adventure\". This will be a little more tricky because this is where my imagination will REALLY come into play as aside from names and dates of birth, I know nothing about the Lefroy children nor Tom Lefroy's siblings. Most of this next part will be completely fictional and based on my ideas, but I hope you will still enjoy it. I had said at the end of Chapter 11-the REAL Chapter 11-that you will most likely see less of Tom's POV from now on, but he will be in the next couple of chapters at least as I needed to have his POV to introduce his own children, his sisters and how the Lefroy house-hold is generally run on a daily basis. Hopefully it will all meet with your approval! ;-D FYI: Tom Lefroy's siblings Tom Lefroy was born of the Irish Lefroys, descendants of a Huguenot Lefroy who migrated to England in the 16th century[7], hence the French sounding name (the family head being a Lord L'Offroy). In 1765, Tom's father (Anthony Peter Lefroy) was secretly married to Ann Gardner in Limerick (Ireland). Five girls were born without Benjamin Langlois (Tom's great uncle and his family's benefactor) knowing it (Radovici mentioned five, but Cranfield mentioned four; it is possible that one of Tom's elder sisters died in infancy). Thomas Langlois Lefroy was the sixth child, also the first son. The list of Tom's siblings (including him) is as follows[8]: 1. unnamed fifth elder sister (actual birth order unknown other than being older than Thomas) 2. Lucy (1 January 1768 – May 1853) 3. Phoebe (15 April 1770 – 5 December 1839) 4. Catherine (18 September 1771 – 3 September 1805) 5. Sarah (18 March 1773 – 1836) 6. Thomas Langlois (8 January 1776 – 4 May 1869) 7. Anthony (19 October 1777 – 7 September 1857) Anthony's son (Thomas Edward Preston Lefroy, 1815–1887) later married Anna Jemima Lefroy (1815–1855, daughter of Anna Austen Lefroy) on 9 September 1846 8. Elizabeth (17 April 1780 – 22 July 1867) 9. Benjamin (5 May 1782 – ?) 10. Christopher (26 June 1784 – 14 February 1805) 11. Anne (26 January 1786 – ?) 12. Henry (5 May 1789 – 29 January 1876) IRELAND (FALL/WINTER 1815) CHAPTER 13 Jane: By the time we were to leave for Ireland, I still hadn't learned what \"the truth\" was that Henry had told our mother that convinced her to let us spend Christmas in Ireland with Tom and his family. When I did finally have the chance to ask him, all he would say was \"You needn't worry yourself about it dear sister...you will understand soon enough.\" and would not budge from that answer no matter how often I pestered him about it. And knowing my brother the way I did, I had the feeling that he actually enjoyed watching my frustration over it. Once I realized that, I did my best to show him that I no longer cared about it and stopped bringing it up at all altogether. Of course it was still constantly at the back of my mind... The morning we set out for Ireland was a cool and crisp. We took mama with us as we were to drop her off at my oldest brother's James's place. We had left early enough to allow us some time to visit James and his family for awhile as well as in case any inclement weather should delayed us along our way being that winter was on the doorstep. As it turned out, our journey passed uneventfully and we even arrived in Limerick a little ahead of schedule. In order to pass some time while we waited for Tom to pick us up, Henry suggested we go into the Inn where the stage had left us and get something to drink. We wouldn't have anything to eat as Tom had promised that there would be food for us as soon as we arrived at his place. Cassandra and myself followed Henry and Eliza inside the quaint eating room of the Inn where we were soon sat and waited upon. I cannot tell say how truly happy I was that I had my sister with us this time. Although I wouldn't admit this to myself, deep down inside, I think the idea of having Cass with me was so that she would...or could serve as a \"buffer\" between Tom and myself...to prevent him...or maybe myself from getting too close... We were in the middle of enjoying our beverages when he appeared, as suddenly and almost as unexpectedly as he had at the last ball we had danced at. He had come up from behind where I was sitting so the other three had the advantage over me and happened to spot him first. \"Tom!\" Henry exclaimed so suddenly that it took me by surprise. He stood up while Eliza and Cassandra looked towards Tom. I was the last to turn my head and look up at him, my pulse quickening maddeningly as I did so. Henry now went over to Tom and shook his hand. \"So you've made it, on that long journey.\" Tom remarked to him with a smile, then turned to the rest of us, addressing us each in turn. \"Mrs. Austen...\" he first addressed Eliza who acknowledged him in return and then gave his attention to Cassandra, \"Miss Austen...it is a pleasure to have you join us.\" He said with a slight bow to which Cassandra returned it with genuine sincerity, \"I thank you for your invitation, Mr. Lefroy. It was most kind of you to include me.\" \"You are most welcome, Miss Austen. I hope you will find your stay to be an enjoyable one.\" \"I am sure that I will.\" Cassandra assured Tom and they both bowed simultaneously. Now he focused on me, \"Jane...\" he greeted me gently with another bow which I of course returned with a bow of my own. \"Mr. Lefroy..\" It was strange how after the time we had spent in London together that I had suddenly become rather shy in his presence. But then some time had passed since then...I told myself. \"Would you care to have something to drink before we carry on to your place Tom?\" Henry now asked him. \"I am not in need of any drink at this time, thank you Henry, but I will sit down and join you while you finish yours. But please do not rush because of myself. We have plenty of time.\" As the table was meant for four people, an extra chair had to be sought out and was placed at the corner between Henry and myself for Tom...and whereupon Tom and Henry engaged in a light conversation about our trip. At one point, I noticed Cassandra looking at me with a slight smile on her lips. I knew that she was trying to let me know that she was pleased with what she had observed in regards to Tom. I offered her a slight smile in return to let her know that I understood. As we only had drinks, it didn't take us long to finish them and soon we were on our way out to Tom's carriage. He held the door open as he and Henry helped the three of us woman up into it before entering the carriage themselves. As like in London, Tom and I were facing each other again but it was Tom and Henry who continued to do the talking. As well along the way, Tom pointed out various points of interest to us. I was glad that I wasn't expected to contribute to the conversation as I have to admit that I was starting to feel a little bit anxious about the idea of meeting his children. Jane of course I already knew, but I still felt nervous about the idea of Tom's other children who had lost a beloved mother. Our own family is no stranger to large families with a lot of children as our two of brothers have large families of their own, but this was different, not being family, not knowing them at all as we had never met before...with the exception of Jane. I was looking forward to seeing Jane again, but I wondered what the rest of them would be like... It seemed like it was all too soon when Tom announced that we were approaching his place. I couldn't help but look out the window of the stage coach door as we became closer and closer to it. I admit that I had also been curious as to what to expect for a house of Tom's, being the successful lawyer that he is. When we finally arrived at his place, I stared in amazement. The garden at the front of the house was, although not huge nor spectacular like Mr. Wisley's aunt, Lady Gresham's, it was lovely enough, in my view. And the house...again, not as big or grand as Lady Gresham's but big enough none the less and very quaint. Before I could stop it, I found myself thinking that I was pleased that it was a size that I was comfortable with...I could tell right away that had I not stated that Cassandra and myself were to share a room, that the house was definitely big enough that we could have each easily had our own room, but still, I was glad that we I had made sure to let them know that we were to share. We now pulled up in front of the attractive home and the carriage came to as stop. Both Henry and Tom alighted in order to help us down. I was so taken by the scenery of the house and garden around me, that I don't even know if it was Tom or Henry who had helped me out of the carriage. \"Welcome to my \" Irish country home\". Tom now said once we were all down and then lead us up the stairs towards the front door of his home where at any moment now, I would see Jane again and meet the rest of his family... Tom: My place in London had become too quiet after Jane, Henry and Eliza had left and I knew that Jane was feeling down about their departure. I remembered Jane's advice and did whatever I could to keep my daughter busy and kept reminding her that every day that passed brought us that much closer to when we would see our friends again. I also reminded her about keeping up with the piano songs that \"Miss Austen\" had taught her to play and I took her out of the house more often than I normally would have. But I admit, I also needed to keep myself occupied and get out of the house as much as she did. When Jane's first letter arrived, the look on my daughter's face was one of pure joy. Jane hadn't said too much in her letter but it was what she had said in it, about her telling her sister about Jane that once again touched my heart. \"Oh father! Just think! Miss Austen has told her sister about me! And that she would like to meet me one day! Do you think it's possible that might happen?\" She asked me. In my own mind Jane was going to become a permanent part of my life and my children's lives hopefully not too long after I see her next, so naturally there wasn't a doubt in my mind that the two would meet, but of course I couldn't say any of this to my daughter. But...it did make me think... \"I have an idea Jane. What do you think about inviting Miss Austen's sister to join us for Christmas?\" I suggested this knowing how close the Austen sisters were and knew that Jane would be thrilled with the idea of her sister being invited to come along. \"Really father?\" Jane's eyes were wide with happiness. \"Really.\" I assured her. \"I think...that was be splendid of course!\" \"Well then my love...why don't you write Miss Austen back and tell her that the invitation for Christmas has been extended to include her sister Miss Cassandra Austen.\" \"Oh I will, right away father! And..thank you!\" She smiled up at me. I smiled back at Jane, pleased to see her smile genuinely again as she had not smiled very much since the Austen's had left. She had relished practicing her piano for she was determined to be playing as well as Jane played when she would join us in Ireland and she could show her how much she had practiced. But that only lasted for so long. There were still a lot of hours to fill in a single day. When Jane had her letter ready, we had it sent off as soon as we could. There would be another reply come to us eventually, Jane letting us know that her sister had accepted the offer. I could tell by the way she had written that she was delighted to have her sister asked. And my daughter was equally excited. This bit of news seemed to help Jane get through the rest of her time spent with me in London and when she finally had to leave me for home again, she seemed quite content. I promised that I should be home myself in a month's time. With Jane gone back home to Ireland and me on my own again, I threw myself wholeheartedly back into my work... It was the eve before the Austen's were to arrive when I asked my sisters Sarah and Phoebe who have been helping me to raise my family, to collect my children as I wished to speak to them in private. I had them brought to my study and gathered them around me for our special talk. Even though my children are good children, no one is perfect and they ARE children after all. Mary and myself never believed in raising them by a firm hand and under a strict regime. We both also believed that they needed to have daily outdoor physical exercise through play, both girls and boys, both the young ones-when they were old enough of course-and the older ones. Unfortunately, weather in Ireland does play a part and can keep them indoors for days at a time, so we converted some of our rooms into what we call \"play rooms\" and we even have a room large enough for us to play our more physical games in. I know for a fact that some people-including some relatives-frown upon our ways of bringing up our children and live in fear that they will all grow up to be as wild as jungle animals, but I have noticed myself that if anything, our children are quite happy and very well behaved as they are given the chance to exercise their energy in a positive way every day. But despite this, I admit that I was still a bit anxious as I really wanted to make a good impression on Jane in regards to my children so I still felt the need to talk to them about our guests. I took my littlest one, Mary (because of Mary's passing I was grateful that we had named one of our daughters after their mother) who will turn four shortly before Christmas and sat her upon my knee while I spoke seriously, but lovingly to the rest of my children about the arrival of our guests. \"You know that I love each and every one of you.\" I started off with. \"I have gathered you all together because all of you know that we are expecting guests who are very special to me. And it is my hope that they will become to special to you all in time as well.\" I looked over and smiled at my daughter Jane who gave me a smile in return. Upon my return home I had noticed that she had gone right back where she had left off, being a mother to her siblings...\"They will be arriving around tea time tomorrow afternoon and they will be both tired and hungry after such a long, tiring journey. I know you are all very curious and eager to meet them and you shall of course for they will be staying here for at least a month, possibly even a little longer. However just for tomorrow afternoon, I would like it if you could leave myself and our guests to get re-acquainted and give them some quiet time to recover from their travelling when they arrive before being introduced. This means that you must stay upstairs in your rooms for awhile and I would like you to take your tea up there as well.\" Not surprising, this was met with a bit of opposition in the form of groans and \"Father, do we have to?\" \"Yes...for this one time, you do.\" I replied gently, but firmly. They know when I use that tone of voice that I am serious. \"For me please as like I said, I would like to give our guests some quiet time to recover after they have arrived. There will be plenty of time for you to meet them and get to know them, like I have also told you. You may all play together after your tea, but you must do it upstairs in any of your rooms. I wish to introduce our company to your Aunts first too, so Anthony, Jane..\" I now addressed my two oldest children. \"You will both be in charge of helping Anna out with your younger siblings for as long as your aunts are engaged with me and our company. After a suitable amount of time has passed, I will send for you all to meet with them. And I know I don't have to tell you this when we have company, but I expect you all to be on your best behaviour when you meet them.\" \"Yes, father.\" Jane was the first to reply. I knew that she would do anything for me but most especially when it came to Miss Jane Austen. \"We will help with the younger ones and we will all be well behaved.\" She promised me. I knew she wanted to impress Jane as much as I did. I smiled affectionately at Jane. \"I know you will...I know you all will.\" I ended giving each of the a smile. \"And now...\" I stood up transferring Mary into my arms. \"I think it's time for bed for some of you. Who wants to read to us tonight?\" \"Please may I father?\" Jane asked. Jane usually did most of the reading, but Anne also did her share of the duty. The boys tended to let the girls do it, although I would make both Anthony and Thomas read as well as I felt it was important for them and when I thought they hadn't offered to do it in quite some time. And soon now, I would start to make Jeffry and George read as well. Mary would be waiting for a couple or so years yet. This was something that I had started when the oldest of our children were quite young but getting old enough to first be read to and then as they became older, I insisted that they start to do their share of reading, Jane of course being the inspiration for it all. Mary had quite approved of the idea herself and it became another family tradition for us, having a family reading before the youngest ones bedtime. We felt it was important to spend this time as a family together, every night. \"Alright then Jane.\" I agreed and we all headed off to the library where Jane found the book and where we left off while the rest of the family got comfortable, on chairs, settees and even the floor, wherever they chose to that would allow their imaginations run free while listening. Mary chose to stay snuggled up to me on my lap which is where she usually sat for our readings. Normally I too get caught up in the story, but tonight I could not concentrate on it at all, knowing that I would see Jane tomorrow... As I feel that Jane Austen was a \"woman before her time\" with her writing, I also like to believe that Tom Lefroy was a \"man before his time\" which is why I have made him a father who believes in \"unconventional child rearing-for the early 19th century at least! ;-D Apparently, the stage had arrived a bit earlier than expected, but I would have been unable to get away from my work any earlier as it was. I noticed them as soon as I went inside the Inn where I said I would meet them. They were all seated having a drink, engaged in conversation. Henry was the first to see me. \"Tom!\" He exclaimed, stood up, came over and shook my hand. \"So you've made it, on that long journey.\" I stated, glad to see they had arrived...and safely. Now that they were there, we knew that nothing had ended up preventing them from their Christmas visit to Ireland. Turning to the ladies, I now acknowledged Eliza, Miss Cassandra Austen-I was glad that I had thought to invite her along after Jane had shared the contents of Miss Jane Austen's letter with me-and finally Jane. We didn't say anything else, there didn't seem to be a need to say anything more. I thought it funny that I should almost feel...awkward in her presence. Perhaps it was because of the amount of time that passed since seeing each other last. But also...I think it was because, even though I had talked with my children the night before and I had complete confidence they would not let me down, I still felt a bit anxious about them all meeting. Most likely because I wanted it to go over very well. And I did wonder about how Jane would feel about taking on seven children...no...actually, I don't like to put it that way. She wouldn't be \"taking on\" seven children...Anna would of course still be their nursery maid as she had been since Anthony was born. And I still expected my sisters to continue to help raise them as they had been doing. I didn't expect Jane to replace their mother...or even to become their mother. I'm sure that it would be an overwhelming idea for herself to be taking over that role. No, things would go on as they have been, but Jane would be a part of our family. After they had finished their drinks and we were all on my carriage, Jane and I sat across from each other again, this time not because it had been \"planned\" for it to happen that way. It just happened on it's own this time. However, Henry and myself carried the conversation and I pointed out various landmarks that I thought they might be interested in noting on our way. As my house is not that far out of Limerick, it did not take us very long to reach it and soon I announced that we were approaching it. I noticed that Jane moved to look out of the window from her seat, I assume to look at my house. I couldn't help but wonder what she would think of it. Once the carriage had stopped in front, both Henry and I alighted and he helped Eliza down while I helped first Cassandra and then Jane down who seemed to me to be captivated by her surroundings. I really was hoping that I was reading her correctly and that she was liking what she was seeing as it would become her future home...although she did not know it yet. I lead the group up the front of our stairs and saying, \"Welcome to my \" Irish country home\". As I felt that Jane Austen was a \"woman before her time\" with her writing, I like to believe that Tom Lefroy was also a \"man before his time\" which is why I decided to write him as a father with \"unconventional child rearing\" ideas. ;-D[Chapter 15] Once again, I have decided to post Jane's and Tom's POV's as two separate Chapters so this one is only Jane's POV. -D CHAPTER 14: Jane: Tom opened his door and stepped aside to allow us to enter. I couldn't help but look about in admiration. It was a place that gave the feeling of being a \"home\". Not the stuffiness or stiffness of say Lady Gresham's place that fairly reeked of it. One was afraid of doing the slightest wrong thing in a place like that. But then, I had to remind myself, her place was not a place that had seen children as she had none herself...or if it had seen any, it hadn't not for many, many years. The Lefroy place on the other hand had seven children which I'm sure helped to keep their place from becoming too stiff and formal. Yet... oddly enough there was an air of elegance about the place as well. I found that I liked this feeling of it being \"homey\". I now realized that one of the servants was wishing to take my coat and bonnet which I kindly gave up. I also noticed that Berkley, whom we had met in London was there to greet us as well as two females whom, although I couldn't be too sure about, I did wonder if they were Tom's sisters as they were not dressed in servant's uniforms. And they did bear some resemblance to the Lefroys. Berkley, Tom had told us when we were in London, always accompanied him whenever he went to London and Anna would always go with Jane whenever she stayed with Tom in London. \"My sisters, Miss Phoebe Lefroy and Miss Sarah Lefroy.\" Tom now introduced the two ladies whom I had assumed correctly to be his sisters. The one called Sarah I thought looked the most like Tom whereas Phoebe although did share some similar traits with her brother, did not look quite as much like him as Sarah did. I didn't know for sure how old either sister was, but it was easy enough to tell that Sarah was the younger one, closer to Tom's and my own age I would guess, while Phoebe was the older sister. \"Mr. Henry Austen, his wife Mrs. Eliza Austen and Mr. Austen's sisters, Miss Cassandra Austen and Miss Jane Austen.\" Tom now finished off the introductions. We all bowed in acknowledgement to one another. \"And of course you met Berkley in London,\" He now addressed us. \"With the exception of Miss Cassandra Austen. Berkley, please make sure that our guests bags are put in their correct rooms.\" \"Very good sir.\" Berkley agreed and left us to carry out his duty. \"Let us now adjourn to the dining room for our tea\" We followed Tom through the entrance hall and eventually into another room where a big dining table was already laden with candles, food and drink. As like in London, Tom sat us all down in the same places he had sat us in London, this time with Cassandra beside myself and his sisters across from each other, Sarah beside Cassandra and Phoebe beside Eliza. From the size of the table, it was clear that the Lefroy's all took their meals together. Which is something that I just realized. Where WERE the children? I hadn't seen nor even heard a peep from them since arriving. And there were no other places set for them at the table. I wondered if I should ask Tom about this. Surely...they ARE here? Tom wouldn't have sent them off to his wife's family...would he have? I thought the idea was for us all to meet... \"And where is the rest of your family Tom? I thought we might be meeting them when we came in the door.\" It was Eliza who asked. \"They are all taking their tea upstairs with Anna, the nursery maid whom you met in London.\" Tom replied. \"I have asked them to give our guests the chance to recover from your long trip.\" I had to admit that I was a bit amazed at how quiet it seemed in a house that had seven children. Even if it was a big house and they were all upstairs, I thought I might expect to hear some activity of some sort from them. \"They are so quiet!\" Eliza voiced my exact opinion. \"For the most part, they are quite well behaved children, although as you are to stay for at least a month, you are sure to witness some falling out with them here and there.\" Tom said with a smile. \"Well, they are children after all.\" I was surprised to hear myself say, defending the brood I had yet to meet. Those were the first words I had spoken since acknowledging Tom at the Inn after he had arrived. \"Yes...they are.\" Tom replied appreciatively in a gentle voice. \"You will meet them in a little while, I just wanted to give you all the chance to rest and refresh first.\" \"It was very thoughtful of you Tom.\" Eliza said. \"Miss Austen...\" Tom's sister Sarah now spoke up. Both Cassandra and myself looked towards her. \"I hope you don't mind, but I wish to tell you how fond I am of your writing. And that it is an honour to have you with us.\" \"Oh please...you must call me Jane.\" I told her right off at the start. Being that Cassandra was there with us this time, I was more than happy to relinquish the title that really belonged to her, as she is eldest of us two. \"And the honour is all mine...ours. To be able to spend this time getting to know Mr. Lefroy's family.\" I finished off my reply. My reply seemed to please her she returned my reply with a rather pretty smile of her own. I couldn't help but smile back. I had the feeling that I would like Sarah. I wasn't sure about Phoebe yet. \"Tom has told us that you knew each other quite a few years back.\" Miss Phoebe now said. \"Yes.\" Henry was the one to reply this time. \"Tom and myself met first while he was living in London and studying law and I was studying at Oxford. He met my sisters when he came out to visit your other family members who are also friends and neighbours of our family, George and Anne Lefroy.\" \"Of course. Tom did mention that.\" Phoebe replied. \"It is a shame that you fell out of touch with each other when he moved back here.\" Sarah now said while Tom and I shared a quick glance. It was obvious that Tom's sisters did not know of our...\"history\" which perhaps is a good thing. \"Yes..\" Tom agreed. \"But we here together now.\" He smiled looking at me again. I gave him a small smile in return. The conversation continued to be an amicable one throughout our tea. \"I should like to see the rest of your lovely home Tom.\" Eliza said when we were finished. \"We are sure to have plenty of time for that.\" Henry said. \"If you wish to freshen yourselves up a bit, I can show you to your rooms right now.\" Tom told us. \"And then we can all meet up in the sitting room and visit a bit more before I call for the children.\" This being agreed upon, we all stood up to file out of the room, Tom first showing us the sitting room he wanted us to join him (and where Sarah and Phoebe left us) in once we were ready, then proceeded towards the grand curving staircase that lead us upstairs. With Cassandra and myself bringing up the rear behind Henry and Eliza, once we were upstairs I thought I detected a slight noise to the right of myself. I turned my head ever so slightly to notice that a door to one of the rooms was slightly ajar. From my position I couldn't really see too much, but I was pretty sure that our movements were being followed by more than one pair of curious young eyes. This was confirmed when I heard whispers behind our backs as we passed by. I bit down on my bottom lip to prevent myself from smiling. I didn't want to bring any attention to the young Lefroy's so I pretended that I hadn't noticed them at all. Then I heard the door click shut softly along with a low muffled voice. Most likely Anna berating the children for sneaking a look. Oddly enough, their behaviour made me feel somewhat more relaxed about meeting them. Finally we arrived at our rooms, near the end of the hall. Henry and Eliza's room was beside ours and Tom's it turns out was across the hall and a little further down, right at the end of the hallway. \"Miss Austen...Jane...\" He bowed slightly as he left us, Cassandra and myself returned it before entering our room. Once inside, I breathed a sigh of relief. \"And so...\" I said as I fell down onto our bed. \"Here we are.\" \"What a lovely room!\" Cassandra exclaimed looking around the clean, bright, airy room. It was bigger than any of the ones in the houses that we had grown up in of course. And although not overly huge, it was roomy enough. There was even a fireplace with a small fire crackling merrily, keeping the room warm. There was most likely a fireplace in every room in this place...or...most of the rooms at least. \"It is nice...isn't it?\" I agreed with her, also taking note of it. I went over to the window to look out, but it was already getting too dark to really be able to see outside anymore. Cassandra was now at the basin which was placed upon a stand beside the bureau and was pouring some water into it so that we could wash our faces. Once we had done this, she turned to me and took my hands into hers and remarked. \"Tom is as charming as ever.\" She said. \"But this time...it is right.\" She finished off seriously. \"Oh Cass...\" I didn't know what else to say. I had been hoping that she would act as a buffer between us, not as a 'catalyst'. \"You deserve this chance to be happy Jane. Don't deny yourself it.\" I could only give her a bit of a watery smile in response. \"Come dearest sister...let us not keep our host waiting too long.\" \"I am so glad that you are with me this time Cass.\" I told her whole-heartedly. Arm in arm, we quit our room together and met up with Henry and Eliza at the bottom of the stairs where we all made our way to the sitting room that Tom had shown us before and we all four of us descended upon it. When Tom had shown us this room, we hadn't really seen the inside of it so upon entering, I looked around it in delight as it was as homey and elegant as what I had seen of his place so far. I was impressed. As we went further in, I happened to notice a portrait that hung on one of the walls. You wouldn't notice it until you are fully inside. Captivated, I went over to it. Without even being told, I was pretty sure I knew who it was a picture of. \"My wife...Mary.\" Tom announced, coming up beside me. I had guessed correctly. \"She was lovely Tom.\" I said in all honesty. She really had been quite an attractive lady. Her hair was a lighter brown colour than Tom's, and there were dainty little ringlets that softly framed a sweet, kind looking face with rather large, grey-blue eyes making her almost seem child-like...sweet and innocent. Which couldn't help me from wondering how old she had been in it. I could see why Tom had fallen in love with her but surprised that it hadn't happened sooner for him. And as Mary had been so attractive, what did Tom see in me then? I could also see that young Jane looked quite a bit like her mother. Tom now gestured that we all get comfortable and I found Sarah joining me on one of the settees whereas, like in the dining room, Phoebe was sitting beside Cassandra. Tom and Eliza were of course together on another settee. Tom sat in alone in one of the chairs. \"Tom has told us that we are to have a Christmas Ball in your honour.\" Sarah addressed me. I looked at her first in astonishment and then fired a look at Tom who quickly obliged us with an explanation. \"Not in Jane's honour.\" He corrected her quickly. \"In honour of the Christmas Season and in honour of all of our guests.\" \"It was actually young Miss Lefroy who suggested it when were staying at Mr. Lefroy's in London.\" I said hoping to make it even more clear that it was not to be a ball in honour of myself. \"Have you settled on a date?\" Eliza asked. \"23rd of December.\" Tom replied. \"And Tom has invited some of the most prominent people in Ireland!\" Sarah exclaimed. \"Only people I know through my work.\" Tom seemed to be trying to downplay his sister's enthusiasm. \"Some I have worked with and some I have represented in the past.\" \"And there will be more of our family for you to meet as well, Jane!\" Sarah now turned to me, her eyes dancing with delight. She was obviously excited by the idea of this ball. Then I realized...more Lefroys? Tom's other brothers and sisters of course. That could be interesting. \"It will all be very splendid, I'm sure.\" I replied with a smile at Sarah. \"How people will talk about it for a time afterwards!\" Sarah went on. \"And how Miss Jane Austen was in attendance as well!\" \"Sarah!\" Tom exclaimed a bit sharply. \"This is not to be a ball about Jane. She is not here to showcase herself. She is here as my...our guest and it should not be interpreted as anything more than that.\" I threw Tom a grateful look but also noticed that Sarah now looked a bit deflated from her excitement only a moment before. I smiled warmly at her and said placing one of my hands gently upon hers, \"I am flattered that you wish for me to be the \"main attraction\" for your brother's ball, but he is right. I get more than enough attention at home and I really just wish to spend the holidays in a \"quiet\"...unobserved manner. I have come to meet and get to know all you, not to have the people of Ireland get to know me. I hope you understand, dear.\" Sarah looked at me and smiled back a rather shy smile. \"Of course. Please forgive me for allowing my eagerness to get the better of me.\" \"There is nothing to forgive.\" I assured her gently but kindly. \"I know you mean well.\" Our conversations continued for awhile in a amicable and at times a somewhat jovial manner as we reconnected with one another again and got to know Tom's two sisters. After awhile Tom finally made the announcement. Standing up, he said, \"If I am to introduce my children before our dinner, then it is time that I send for them.\" \"Would you like that Sarah and myself bring them down, Tom?\" Phoebe asked. \"Yes, if you wouldn't mind, that would be good of you Phoebe. Make sure that they are presentable before you bring them down of course.\" \"Of course.\" Both sisters stood up and quit the room together while we four remained in the room awaiting for the Lefroy brood to make their appearance..[Chapter 16] CHAPTER 15: Tom: I paid close attention to Jane especially as I opened the door for my guests and stepped aside to allow them to enter my home. Of course I was most interested in her reaction to it and I hoped that she would not be disappointed. And she did not disappoint me either. I felt that I had assumed correctly when I had noticed that she had been observing the outside of my home and she now seemed to be quite captivated with the inside of it as well. One of my servants along with Berkley and my two sisters were there to greet us as had been arranged prior to my departure that day. \"My sisters, Miss Phoebe Lefroy and Miss Sarah Lefroy.\" I announced after everyone's coats and hats had been removed and taken away by my servant. Although both sisters are older than me, Sarah is the closest in not only age to myself but personality as well. We had always been close and I knew that she and Jane would be more likely to connect than our older sister Phoebe. Not to say anything against my older sister, she had just always been more of the more mature, serious type along with our oldest sister Lucy whom she is closest to (both Phoebe and Lucy being amongst those relatives who had originally disapproved of Mary's and my way of raising our children. It was Phoebe who had been the first to assume the \"motherly\" duties when Mary had passed. I was pretty sure that her intentions were to change the ways of our child-rearing in order to make sure that our children would not grow up to be wild. But after living with us for sometime, even she had to admit that our way seems to be working for our children). Sarah and myself on the other hand are more \"young at heart\" along with the rest of our younger brothers and sisters (Sarah tends to join in with our children in their daily physical play and activities, whereas Phoebe leaves that part of their daily routine up to Sarah and myself if I'm available). As Jane is more like myself in such ways, it stood to reason that she and Sarah would get along. Also, Sarah had been quite thrilled that \"Miss Jane Austen, authoress\" had been invited to spend the holiday season with us, being another avid reader of hers along with my daughter Jane. That made three of us who have been quite excited about Christmas this year. Although Phoebe is able to keep herself in check better and would never really come out and express it, I believe that she too liked the idea. \"Mr. Henry Austen, his wife Mrs. Eliza Austen and Mr. Austen's sisters, Miss Cassandra Austen and Miss Jane Austen.\" I continued, finishing off the introductions. I \"re-introduced\" Berkley to the three who already knew him and then to Miss Cassandra Austen whom of course hadn't met him yet, then dismissed him by giving him the task of putting everyone's bags in their rooms while I suggested that we all go to the dining room for our tea and lead the way. I was happy that to this point, I had not heard my children. Anna, Jane and Anthony were doing a good job of keeping the younger ones happy and occupied. I breathed a small, in audible sigh of relief. As I felt pretty sure that Sarah and Jane would get along (and because Sarah was such a fan of Jane's), I purposely sat them on the same side of the table. Of course I would put Jane's sister beside herself and Sarah beside her while I sat Phoebe opposite Sarah and beside Eliza. Naturally I realized that the subject of my children would arise as I had not told my guests that they would not be meeting them directly upon arrival. Eliza was the first the speak about their absence. \"And where is the rest of your family Tom? I thought we might be meeting them when we came in the door.\" she asked. \"They are all taking their tea upstairs with Anna, the nursery maid whom you met in London. I have asked them to give our guests the chance to recover from your long trip.\" I now explained to them. \"They are so quiet!\" Eliza exclaimed. \"For the most part, they are quite well behaved children, although as you are to stay for at least a month, you are sure to witness some falling out with them here and there.\" I replied with a smile knowing that with all children, no matter how good they generally are, that good behaviour isn't constant, my own included. \"Well, they are children after all.\" Jane pleasantly surprised me with her candid statement. I gazed at her and still smiling, \"Yes...they are.\" I agreed gently, happy to know that she seemed to understand this even though she had no children of her own. \"You will meet them in a little while, I just wanted to give you all the chance to rest and refresh first.\" \"It was very thoughtful of you Tom.\" Eliza assured me. My sister Sarah finally had the chance to say what I know she had been wanting to say since knowing that Jane would be coming to visit us. \"Miss Austen...\" She now spoke up. \"I hope you don't mind, but I wish to tell you how fond I am of your writing. And that it is an honour to have you with us.\" I was delighted when Jane insisted that Sarah be less formal with her and call her \"Jane\" instead of \"Miss Austen\" and then saw the two of them smile at each other. Sarah, I could tell was just as enamoured with Jane as my young Jane had been upon first meeting her and continues to be. I could also tell that Jane's return smile was a genuine one. I was very pleased. My older sister Phoebe now spoke up for the first time. She had been holding back, observing our guests which is natural for her. \"Tom has told us that you knew each other quite a few years back.\" To which Henry gave the reply this time. \"Yes. Tom and myself met first while he was living in London and studying law and I was studying at Oxford. He met my sisters when he came out to visit your other family members who are also friends and neighbours of our family, George and Anne Lefroy.\" \"Of course. Tom did mention that.\" Phoebe replied. \"It is a shame that you fell out of touch with each other when he moved back here.\" Sarah added while I glanced quickly at Jane to see her looking back at myself. I had never told my sisters...indeed my family about how Jane and myself had really met...what had really happened between us. It had been too painful for me to talk about. As well, I didn't see the sense in dredging up the past when, especially after everything and at the time, that's all it was... a past. And a past that could never, would never come to light again I was so sure of at the time. How I was glad I was wrong about that now. And even when I knew that Jane would be spending Christmas with us, even though it still stirred up painful memories, I didn't enlighten them then either. Let us begin with some new, fresh, happier memories was my thought. \"Yes..\" Tom agreed. \"But we here together now.\" I smiled at Jane once again who returned it with a small smile of her own. Our conversations continued on in a light-hearted manner after this and after we had finished our tea but were still conversing Eliza had mentioned how she wished to see the rest of the house. I would be only too happy to give my company a tour of my place (I admit that I was quite eager to 'show it off' to Jane especially of course) but I felt it would be best to wait until a bit later on after they had met my children. Henry helped me out by saying that there would be plenty of time in which to see it during their stay. I now suggested that if they wished to freshen up that I could show them to their rooms right now. It was agreed upon and I lead the way out of the dining room, stopping by the sitting room I wished for them all to join me in once they were ready. Sarah and Phoebe went in to await myself and our guests while I continued to lead the way back to the staircase and up the stairs. Being right outside the doors I knew my children were in, I was even more acutely aware of their presence and did notice the slight crack in the doorway of one of the rooms as we passed. On the one hand I was slightly mortified that Anna, Anthony and Jane hadn't been more watchful of whomever was peeking out, but at the same time, I didn't think that anyone else would notice as the door was just ever so slightly ajar. They are children after all I reminded myself of Jane's own words and decided that it was best to carry on as if I hadn't even noticed them instead of bringing them to everyone's attention. Having reached this decision, I even felt a bit amused by their actions. They were just being themselves, curious and no harm was being done after all. Then I had a thought...and perhaps it was just wishful thinking on my own part, but somehow, I could see Jane also being amused by their actions if she realized that we were being watched. I continued on down the hallway with my guests, showing each of them to their rooms and pointing out that my own room was the last room on their left, right at the end of the hallway and left them to refresh themselves while I myself went back down to the sitting room to await for them. On my way back to the staircase I noticed that the door to one of the children's rooms was no longer open but I could hear a muffled voice. I couldn't help but smile as I realized that Anna was speaking to the children about their naughtiness. I made my way back to the sitting room where Sarah not surprising, was the first to pounce on me. \"This is so exciting Tom! And Miss Austen...Jane...is delightful. They all are.\" \"I'm glad you approve, dear sister.\" I smiled at her, that never being a concern of mine that the Austen's would meet with disapproval from my sisters. Well, Sarah anyway. But I really never thought that Phoebe would disapprove either. Although I think that Eliza had intrigued her more, being that she had been married to a wealthy French man at one time who had met his fate with the guillotine because he had been opposed to all of the changes the French revolutionary government had brought in. \"They are indeed lovely Tom.\" Phoebe now voiced her own opinion. I also felt that Phoebe might have more in common with Cassandra as well being that they were both more a bit more reserved. When the Austens rejoined us, I took further note of Jane's reaction to the sitting room. Once again, she seemed pleased. Almost immediately upon her entrance she walked over to a portrait of Mary that was hanging on one of the walls and went right over to it. I followed her. \"My wife...Mary.\" I told her quietly. \"She was lovely Tom.\" I knew her reply was genuine. I was touched. But as Mary had without a doubt been beautiful, and there was no denying that if Jane and Mary stood side by side, that Mary's beauty would stand out. But Jane was just as beautiful...only in a different way. Whereas Mary's beauty was physical and was noticed straight away, Jane's beauty did not stand out like Mary's did. It had to be found. It is almost as if Jane herself was able to hold it back from everyone in order to challenge people...to dare people-men in particular of course-to find it for themselves (something I would not at all find surprising about Jane). I had found it. Not quite right away...but almost. And once I had found it, she even surpassed Mary in her beauty...at least as far as I was concerned. That, added to her spirit, independence and spontaneity only enhanced her true beauty to me. Which was one of the reasons why I had returned to her even after becoming engaged to Mary in the first place. Mary was not Jane. And I could not seem to take that step toward marrying her without at least seeing Jane one last time. To give us one last chance to be together...to see if Jane felt anything for me at all. Especially now that surely she must know I was engaged. If I could discover that she still had feelings for me...and if my own feelings were as strong as they had been for Jane (which I never had a doubt I would find that they would be) I didn't care then. We would take our chances even if that meant that we had to run away together...to be completely on our own and do everything for ourselves with NO help from our families who would surely disown us if we did... Bringing myself back to the present, I gestured for everyone to take a seat so that we could enjoy our \"reaquaintance\" in comfort. Sarah watched to see where Jane would sit and sat down beside her immediately. \"Tom has told us that we are to have a Christmas Ball in your honour.\" Sarah started off addressing Jane straight away. I had seen Jane look at me with a rather stricken look on her face and quickly corrected my sister. \"Not in Jane's honour. In honour of the Christmas Season and in honour of all of our guests.\" Jane then went on to explain how it was my daughter who had come up with the idea when we were all together in London and Eliza asked if I had settled on a date for it. Sarah then went on to say that I had invited some of the most prominent people in Ireland which I wish she hadn't done. I once again corrected that statement by saying that they were mostly people I knew through my work one way or another. I didn't want Jane to think that I had purposely gone out and invited people of \"high society\" because of her for I knew she would disapprove of that as well. Sarah now told Jane how more of our family members would be here. I hoped that Jane wouldn't be overwhelmed by meeting so many Lefroys at one time. Then to my dismay, I heard Sarah say. \"How people will talk about it for a time afterwards! And how Miss Jane Austen was in attendance as well!\" \"Sarah!\" I admonished her in my shock. \"This is not to be a ball about Jane. She is not here to showcase herself. She is here as my...our guest and it should not be interpreted as anything more than that.\" I saw Jane's look at me and was horrified that Sarah should come to the conclusion that Jane was here as some sort of exhibit. I knew that Jane would never approve of such a thing. I love my sister Sarah dearly but she does tend to be a bit of a \"romantic\" and have her head in the clouds at times and can get carried away with certain situations as she was with the idea of our authoress friend being in attendance along with other members of the upper class. I was truly grateful when Jane had noticed Sarah's crestfallen look and took it upon herself to make my sister feel better by explaining that she was flattered by her enthusiasm of her presence but that she wished to enjoy a \"quiet\" Christmas where she wished to get to know all of us. After the two had made \"amends\" (so to speak), we resumed our conversations which became more light-hearted and enjoyable. When I felt that enough time had passed I stood up and announced that it would be a good time for my guests and my children to be introduced to one another. Phoebe offered for her and Sarah to go and retrieve them which they did, while I sat back down with my company and awaited for Jane and my children to meet each other at last. Now that the \"introductions\" of the Lefroy Family/house-hold are nearly over with, some more \"interesting\" times are on the way, so be sure to stay \" 'tooned \"! ;-D[Chapter 17] CHAPTER 16: Jane: We did our best to engage in small talk while we waited for the Lefroy children to make their entrance. I admit that I was a bit amused as Tom suddenly almost seemed to be a little bit nervous and I'll assume nervous about the idea of us meeting his children. This also seemed to make feel somewhat more calm about meeting them. As they seemed to be taking longer than I had anticipated they would, I thought that they probably had to make some minor \"repairs\" and \"adjustments\" to some of the children in which to make them \"presentable\". Eventually however, I started hearing a noise that suggested that several pairs of feet were first coming down stairs and then walking towards the room we were in. Miss Phoebe was in the lead, the first to enter the room upon their arrival. \"Tom...\" she addressed him, as he quickly stood up and went over to the doorway. Phoebe moved aside and allowed the children to enter, Sarah and Anna bringing up the rear. Once they were all in, the three females quietly, quickly and efficiently moved the children to the center of where we were all sitting and lined them up, facing us. Now Tom stepped towards them and addressed us all. \"Children, these are our guests, Mr. Austen, Mrs. Austen, Miss Cassandra Austen and Miss Jane Austen.\" He gestured to each of us in turn as we each bowed in turn to our names. The children gave us their customary greeting bow, even the littlest one. Tom now introduced his children, one by one, standing behind each one of them as he named them off so we would know who was who. \"This my oldest, Mr. Anthony Lefroy...and of course with the exception of Miss Cassandra Austen, you have met Miss Jane Lefroy...Anne...Thomas...Jeffry...George...and Mary.\" As I briefly studied each child it was easy to see that some of them took more after Tom while others took more after Mary in their looks. We smiled at each of them in turn although I could feel that we were being sized up by Tom's children. Not in a rude way, just more out of curiosity than anything. When it had come to Jane's turn, she and I shared a look and a knowing smile. It was lovely to see her again. I hoped that we would get the chance to talk without all of the children around. I wanted to see how she was doing. I also wanted to know if she had been able to practice her piano as much as she had promised me. There was plenty of time for us to practice our duet and some Christmas songs together at least. \"Father, may I speak please?\" asked the girl standing next to Jane. If I was remembering correctly, her name was Anne. \"Yes Anne what is it you wish to say?\" Tom gave her his permission. \"I wish to ask Miss Austen a question.\" \"Miss Cassandra Austen or Miss Jane Austen?\" \"Miss Jane Austen please.\" \"Miss Austen?\" Tom addressed me now and I nodded my head to let him know that it was alright with me for her to ask me her question, then he turned back to Anne. \"Go ahead then.\" \"Miss Austen, Jane says you are a famous writer. Do you write children's stories too?\" \"First off...children...\" I said including all of the children in my address. \"It is our pleasure to meet you. But you must not call me Miss Austen as that is the title that belongs to my sister...\" I gestured towards Cassandra \"...and especially as we are both present. Perhaps in order for it to not be so confusing amongst us with two Miss Austens and two Janes...\" I smiled at Jane when I said this and she returned it. \"You could refer to me as...oh...how about Miss Jane. Do you think that would that be suitable for everyone?\" There was a general nodding of heads so I continued, \"And in answer to your question...Anne...\" I now turned my attention to Anne and with another smile at her, I replied, \"Yes, your sister is correct in that I am writer.\" I left out the famous part on purpose. \"However, I admit that I have not tried to write children's stories. But perhaps one day I will have to try it and see if I am able to accomplish it well enough so that it meets the approval of young children.\" My answer seemed to please Anne. \"What's it like to be famous?\" Now one of the younger boys, I forgot his name already...how was I to remember all of them, I wondered...spoke without permission. \"Jeffry!\" Tom admonished him in his surprise. Oh right. That's what his name was...Jeffry. \"It's alright Tom. He's just being curious.\" I assured him. I turned to the one called Jeffry and said, \"You know, I don't like to think of myself as being famous. And really it's not all that different than not being famous. You just find that more people seem to know you, than you know people. I do not live any differently than if I wasn't famous.\" \"Why did you become famous then?\" He went on with a puzzled look on his face. \"Manners Jeffry!\" Tom exclaimed in a tone that was low, but firm. I held up my hand to Tom to indicate that I was fine with this question. But I had to keep my smile hidden from the young boy's question as I thought about how it was best to answer him and in a way he would understand. \"I didn't choose to become famous...Jeffry. I like to write. I enjoy writing stories and people like to read some of my stories. And people tell other people about them and soon a whole bunch of people know about my stories and read them. That's how I became...\"famous\" although I personally prefer the word \"known\" to \"famous\". \"Children, that is enough for now. I realize that you probably have a lot of questions to ask Miss Jane, but there is going to be plenty of time for you to ask your questions, you need not ask them all tonight in one sitting.\" Tom intercepted his children firmly before anymore questions could be asked. \"Before our dinner, I am going to take our guests on a tour of our house and you are to stay with Anna and your aunts. You may do as you please while you wait for dinner, as long as it is within reason. Mind you listen to Anna and your aunts.\" Tom gestured for us to leave the room and we followed him. \"I apologize for Jeffry. He is my inquisitive child.\" Tom explained to us once we were in the main entrance. \"Not at all Tom, do not concern yourself about it. I honestly did not mind.\" I replied smiling at the recent memory. We went from room to room on the main floor where Tom showed us to drawing rooms, sitting rooms, a room that he referred to as both his office and study, the library which was much bigger than the one in London. I was glad of the time we would be spending here in Ireland for I knew that this library would be one of the rooms I would be spending some time in. \"You are welcome to come and go from this library as you please, Jane, you needn't ask my permission. \" Tom informed me without me having said a word to him, obviously remembering our London visit. \"Nor any of you. You are all free to come and go as you please from my library and you may help yourselves to any of the books in here that interest you, for as long as you are in Ireland.\" He finished off including the rest of the Austen's in his offer. We came to another drawing room, this one had a piano in it and before I could say anything Tom said, \"We call this room our music room. Jane took your advice to heart and has done quite a lot of practicing since we saw you last. I'm sure you will be quite pleased at her progress.\" \"I am sure that I will be.\" I replied firmly. I was looking forward to hearing her. Eventually we came across quite a large and oddly quite empty room and which at first Tom referred to the \"running room\". \"Running room?\" I looked at Tom with a puzzled expression on my face. \"What a strange name for a room!\" Tom chuckled at my expression and said. \"It doesn't really have name, it goes by a few different names actually...\"running room\" is one, \"games room\" is another, \"activity room\"...It is really a ballroom and where the dancing will take place for our Christmas Ball, but it's other use is mainly for the children to exercise their energy on days when the weather is too foul to go outside and play.\" He now explained his and Mary's belief of bringing up their children in this manner, through physical play and activity. \"You actually allow your children to run in this room?\" Eliza seemed a bit shocked at the idea. I couldn't say that I blamed her...the idea of seven children running in this elegant room. But it did explain it's emptiness at least. \"It's more for playing physical games than just running around in it.\" Tom further explained to us. \"You will understand more when you see it being used for that. We have a few smaller rooms upstairs, one is the \"school room\" that is used for the children's studies of course and a couple of other rooms that we call \"play rooms\" that are used for their more leisure activities.\" It was all a very interesting concept, these rooms that were used specifically for the children and their play. \"I know of some people who object to this kind of upbringing, even some of my own family as well as Mary's but we have found that it actually seems to benefit the children more as for the most part, they are all happy, very healthy and quite bright.\" I couldn't object to it myself remembering how much time we had also spent outside \"trying to keep up with our brothers\" as Henry had put it once. It certainly hadn't hurt us any. As Tom was speaking these words, I couldn't help but think and in fact found myself saying out loud, \"I might be interested in taking part at times as well.\" Tom's face brightened when I said these words. \"I'm sure the children would enjoy having you join in. And Sarah as well.\" He seemed pleased with my suggestion. Then he went on. \"Phoebe is one of my family members who was against this idea until she came to live with us after Mary's passing. I'm sure she had intended to put a stop to it, but found it to be more helpful than harmful after all. However, she would never participate in such activities. That is part of Sarah's daily duties with the children. She is like myself and quite relishes in them as much as they do. I also join in when I am at home. Phoebe teaches the younger ones in their schooling along with Sarah and Jane now also helps them with the youngest ones. Anthony will be starting school in Limerick next half term after Christmas as he has now become of age.\" \"Is he interested in studying the law like yourself, Tom?\" Henry asked. \"He seems to be more into politics.\" Tom replied. \"Still very respectable.\" Eliza stated. \"Let us carry on then shall we?\" Tom now said. \"As it is already close to dinner, I suggest that we continue on with the upstairs part of our tour after we have eaten if that suits everyone?\" We all agreed and Tom sought out Berkley who told him that dinner would be served immediately if we wished to take our places in the dining room. The children were already being ushered in to the table. We followed them in and as soon as we were all sat, Tom looked over at his oldest son. \"Anthony, would you please lead us in the blessing tonight?\" \"Yes, father.\" Anthony immediately began the meal blessing as we all bowed our heads... Now that we had met the children, I started to pay particular attention to the interaction between Tom and his family. Of course I had watched Tom and Jane quite a bit in London and now I was interested in observing all of them together. During the dinner meal, the children were all very well behaved and ate their food in silence, although it was very possible that they had been listening to our conversation. From the little I had seen of all of them, they did seem to obey Tom quite well and were certainly not unruly. But then as Tom had said earlier, as we were to be here into the New Year, we were very likely to see some wayward behaviour from them here and there. That of course was to be expected. I think that it would be more disconcerting if they were to turn out to be perfect children who got along perfectly all of the time. After we had finished our meal, Tom announced, \"While we are waiting for our dessert in the drawing room, I will show our guests the rest of the house. Phoebe, Sarah and Anna, you may take the children into the drawing room and have your dessert.\" Henry, Eliza, Cassandra and myself rose from our chairs as Tom did and once again, he lead the way out of the room and towards the staircase again and up the stairs. He showed us the various rooms upstairs, his sisters room and Anna's room (none of which he opened, he merely pointed them out which one belonged to whom)-all of which were right beside the children's rooms-even with all of the rooms upstairs, the three girls shared one big room-as did the boys. But we were soon to find out why. It was as Tom had mentioned earlier about the \"play rooms\". They were easily meant to be bedchambers but instead, one of them was used as a \"school room\" which had tables and chairs, writing paper, tablets and of course books all neatly put away for the day. By contrast, the other rooms were not neat at all which surprised even me. These rooms were clearly used as the actual play rooms that Tom had mentioned and which had a variety of toys, games, books scattered throughout it. \"These rooms only gets picked up once a day and the children are all expected to do it before our nightly reading.\" Tom explained of the mess inside. Naturally, this caught my attention. \"Reading?\" \"Yes...it's something I started when Anthony was old enough to be read to, although Jane was still too small. Mary or myself would read to Anthony...and Jane as well you could say, before their bed. As Anthony and Jane learned to read, we encouraged them to start reading and now the older children as well as myself do the reading.\" \"I think that's wonderful Tom.\" I told him, amazed. I was starting to like how Tom was raising his children. \"I'm glad it meets with your approval.\" He said softly with a smile. Then something else caught my attention. Tom's words, \"...it was something I started with Anthony..\" This was..HIS idea then? Tom now brought us back to the top of staircase and lead us back down. I had noticed at least one other room that he had never shown us, at the opposite end of the hallway, but I suspected it was just a spare room of no real significance. OR...a thought suddenly struck me...maybe it was a room of Mary's that he did not wish to disturb. I couldn't blame him there and I promised myself that I would not ask him about it. I understood that he did not show it to us because of personal reasons and it was not in our right to know if he did not wish it. I respected him for that. Tom lead us into the drawing room which held the piano, I noticed. I did wonder if he had chosen this room for that purpose or if they always took their dessert in this room. By the time we had arrived, the children had apparently finished with their own desserts and almost as soon as we were in the room, Phoebe, Sarah and Anna had gathered the children and left it. \"'Play time' for the day is over. It's time to straighten up their rooms.\" Tom explained with a smile when we looked at him in askance. Just like clock-work, they knew their duties. \"Amazing!\" Eliza exclaimed as dessert and beverages were served to us. \"I have never heard or seen such a way of bringing up a family before Tom. I admit that unless I had only heard but hadn't witnessed it for myself I don't know if I could have believed that this \"modern\" way of child rearing could actually work, but it certainly seems to be working at least for yours!\" \"Thank you Eliza. We...I think it is too. But I also think it helps to make sure that we...I am involved with them. I don't know if it would work as well if the parents aren't willing to participate in at least some of the activities with them whenever they can.\" I too thought much like Eliza...not that I had much experience in child-raising aside from my own brother's families, but I was beginning to think that this idea might a good one to try for at least some of their own children. But then I wondered if it was too late for them anyway. They would most likely never believe in it either. \"Jane has been quite eager to play for you so that you will be able to hear how she has come along, Jane. But for now, she wishes for only yourself to be present when she does. I thought that sometime tomorrow you and she could sit down and you could listen to her.\" Tom now addressed me. \"Of course Tom. I would be more than happy to.\" I returned. We carried on with casual conversation until the children returned to the drawing room. \"And now who is to read to us tonight?\" Tom said looking at his children with that familiar twinkle in his eye. \"Ah...Mr. Lefroy...might I read tonight? Please...it would be my pleasure.\" I quickly asked while everyone, including the children stared at me in their surprise. It was an idea that had come into my mind when Tom had told us about their nightly reading. I thought it might be one way for his children and myself to ease into getting to know one another. His face lit up with pleasure. \"It would be our honour...Jane. I thought instead of moving into the library that we could stay in here this time. Jane, you go and get the book that we have been reading and bring it back here please.\" I myself sat down on the floor and said, \"Children why don't you gather round me...\" I encouraged them. They all looked towards their father who smiled and gave them a nod of his head in the affirmative. Tom obviously did not object to my idea of my sitting on the floor and having the children sit around me, but nor had I really expected that he would considering his own unconventional ways in which he was raising this family. After they were all seated on the floor near me, with the exception of little Mary who went over to Tom instead, I went on. \"...and while we wait for Jane you to tell me what the story is about that you have been reading.\" \"Anthony, why don't you fill Miss Jane in on the story.\" Tom instructed his oldest son. which he obliged. Jane came back into the room while Anthony was just finishing up and Jane handed me the book. Most of the children were more or less in front of me, but she quickly took up a spot beside me. \"Thank you, Jane. Now, if you would kindly show me where you left off last please and where I should read until, we can get started.\" \"We usually read a chapter a night, Miss..Jane.\" Jane informed me. \"Unless the chapter is unusually short, then we might read a little more. Or if the chapter is unusually long, then we might shorten it. But we keep our readings shorter because of the younger children.\" \"I see.\" I replied. \"That is a very wise idea, keeping the younger children in mind for your readings.\" I went through the chapter with Jane to see how long it was and we both came to the agreement that it would do. \"A chapter it shall be then.\" And I started in on their nightly reading... After I had finished the chapter, the younger children, Mary, George, Jeffry were taken up to bed while the older four were allowed to stay in the room for awhile as we continued on with our visit. Eventually, they went up to their rooms and soon afterwards, we four travelers declared that it was time for us to retire as well. Tom took up the rear and followed us up to our rooms and as Cassandra and myself paused at our door to bid everyone a good night, Tom said, \"Jane...there is something I wish to show you before you retire to your room for the night. Please, it will only take a few minutes. I promise not to keep you long.\" I looked at Cassandra who gave me a smile and nodded her head slightly before saying good night to Tom and entering our bedchamber. After the door was closed on us, he held out his free arm and puzzled, I took it. \"And how has Jane been doing?\" I now asked Tom wishing to hide my baffled expression from him as he lead me away from our room. \"She has reverted back to playing the mother to her younger brothers and sisters.\" He told me a bit sadly. \"But I am hoping now that you are here, that will change. It was easier for her to be more herself in London as her siblings weren't there of course. It may be harder here with them all around, but I am still hopeful that having you here will allow her be that 13 year old girl again.\" I looked at Tom who was looking back and at me and replied whole-heartedly. \"I hope so too. I will do whatever it is that I can to help her.\" Tom smiled down at me. No words were needed. Suddenly, he stopped and it was now that I realized that he had taken me down to the opposite end of the hallway and in my surprised I noticed that we were stopped outside the door of the room he had not shown us earlier. He was obviously about to show me what lay in that room, behind that door...[Chapter 18] In this chapter, I have gone back and forth between Jane and Tom a little bit...;-D CHAPTER 17: Jane: For some reason, my heart started to quicken as Tom reached out to open the door. Without words at first, he stepped inside, set the candelabra he had been holding in his other hand down on a bureau just inside the door, then stepped aside so that I could enter. \"This room...Jane...is yours.\" He said as I entered the room and quickly looked about it. I gasped in bewilderment. \"Excuse me? What do you mean, Tom?\" \"I thought that as you are going to be here for at least a month that perhaps you would like a room exclusively for yourself in which to do your writing...if you ever feel the urge to do so while you are here. I don't want you to think that you cannot write while you are vesting here.\" I was beyond speechless. I certainly wasn't expecting such a gesture. \"Tom...\" I answered when I finally found my voice again. \"I...I don't know what to say. This is...what a lovely gesture...such a wonderful surprise!\" \"Come in...take a look around. Of course you will see it better tomorrow by natural daylight, but I couldn't wait until tomorrow to show it to you.\" He lead the way further inside and showed me over to a desk that already had writing paper, a quill and inkwell sitting on it. I could see that the desk was set right beneath a window. And in fact, not just one. but two, I now noticed further. There were two windows...corner windows at right angles from one another. \"The view is quite picturesque from here during the day. It looks out onto our garden and of course the fields and hills beyond. And when the sun is shining, you have sun in this room all day as one window faces west and the other south. I thought the view perhaps might be provide some inspiration for your writing as well.\" Tom explained. \"Not that you need any...\" He added with a slight smile. I didn't know how to reply to all of this. The thought that Tom had put into it...I looked around and noticed that there was a small fireplace and also a settee in the room. \"A settee in which you could just relax if you wanted or needed to...perhaps if you need to take some thinking time for whatever story you are working on...it's yours Jane, to do whatever you want to in it. But my original idea was for you to have this room while you are here, where you could do your writing. But it is yours.\" Feeling a bit emotional, I put my hand to my mouth and looked around the cozy, charming little room and as I did, I actually pictured myself at the desk writing. The feeling that gave me...my heart was fairly bursting. \"And the children KNOW that this room is strictly forbidden to them. They know that they are NOT to come into this room and they are NOT to disturb you in here.\" Tom now said quite firmly. A sound that I could not interpret escaped my throat at that moment. \"And neither am I...\" Tom finished off more softly this time. I looked at him to see him gazing back at me with his half smile and that twinkle in his eye. \"Oh Tom...it would be alright.\" I assured him in a voice that was full of emotion. \"You needn't be so strict with the children about this room either, I'm sure.\" \"As long as the children don't bother you while you are trying to write.\" He insisted. \"So this room meets with your approval?\" He now asked. \"Oh yes, it more than meets my approval Tom! I thank you! It is so quaint and charming! I am sure that it must be even moreso in the daylight. I cannot wait to see it tomorrow and also to see what that view looks like that you brag about.\" I told him finally finding my wits again. \"We shall check it out more tomorrow again then.\" Tom promised. \"I really wanted to show it to you first without anyone else around. But it is yours to come and go from as you please.\" With that, Tom picked up the candelabra, offered his arm to me once again which I took and we left the room together. Our return walk was a bit quiet as my mind was full. He left me at my door where we bid each other goodnight and he carried on towards his own room. I shouldn't have, but I couldn't help but watch his back for only a few seconds. But as I didn't want him to catch me watching him, I forced myself to look away and quickly entered my room as soon as he reached his own. Cassandra was still awake as we hadn't been gone very long. Propping herself on her elbow, she watched me from the bed while I prepared myself for the night. \"And...? Are you allowed to tell me what it was Mr. Lefroy wanted to show you, Jane?\" She asked in a low voice so that Henry and Eliza would not hear us talking as they were in the room next to us. She was undoubtedly full of curiosity as I too would have been. But I held off saying anything until I was joined my sister in the bed. Then I said: \"He...gave me a room.\" I couldn't resist teasing her just a bit. \"He...gave you a...what?\" \"A room. Do you recall noticing a door at the opposite end of this hallway that he did not show us when he was showing us around?\" Cassandra nodded her head. \"That room. A room for me in which to do my writing in whilst we are here if I wish to.\" I explained. \"Oh!\" Cassandra exclaimed as surprised as I had been. \"I think that is very thoughtful of Mr. Lefroy. What is the room like?\" \"It is very cozy and very quaint. It has two windows at the corner of the house, one that faces south and one that faces west which lets in a lot of sunshine on sunny days. Of course I am curious to see what it is like by daylight, but it could only be even moreso by daylight than it was by candlelight.\" \"I should say so.\" Cassandra agreed. \"I would like to see it for myself as well.\" \"Of course you should. As I always want your input with my stories, you must see it. It'll be perfect, Cass as it has not only a writing desk, but a settee as well. You will also have a place in which to sit while we discuss my stories. In fact, we would both be able to sit upon it while discussing. I will show it to you tomorrow.\" I promised as I sat up and leaned over to blow out the candle. \"Tom says that the view from there is quite picturesque as well.\" I finished off. \"Jane...\" Cassandra started as I nestled down beneath the covers. \"I couldn't help but watch Tom tonight...I noticed that he in turn couldn't keep his eyes off of you. And when you were down on the floor reading to the children...Jane...he really does love you. I could tell by the look in his eyes whenever he looked at your and the look on his face. He truly adores you.\" I was at a loss for this that my sister had just disclosed to me. \"And one more thing...I noticed that he no longer wears a wedding ring...\" She said. In my letter to Cassandra when we were still in London at Tom's, I had made sure to tell her that he still wore his wedding ring. I admit that I had noticed that myself. It was one of the first things I had noticed upon seeing him again at the Inn, that his ring finger was now bereft of the ring. After a several seconds of silence all I could think of to say was, \"Good night Cass...\" \"Good night Jane.\" I swear I could her a smile in her voice as she spoke those words. Tom: After leaving Jane at her bedroom door, I myself went in to get ready for the night and while doing so, I mulled everything over. I admit that earlier on, I had begun to feel a bit apprehensive again about Jane and my children finally meeting one another as of course I really wanted them to like each other. A lot was riding on their initial introduction. I did my best to keep my nervousness from surfacing but I had found it difficult to concentrate on the conversation the other three were engaged in while we were waiting for my offspring to make their appearance. It hadn't helped my nerves any that my sisters seemed to be taking longer with the children than I had anticipated... But in the end, now a few hours later, I can breathe easy and say that I was very pleased with how everything went off tonight. With the exception of Jeffry...but that seems to be his nature and Jane didn't seemed to be put off by it. And perhaps it wasn't a negative thing either. Perhaps it was just as well that Jane discover the true nature of all of my children right from the start. That didn't mean that I was going to allow them \"run wild\"-not that they would, or that I would allow them to on any normal given day-but maybe I could relax a bit now and just let \"nature take it's course\" with them, especially as the initial introductions to one another were now over and done with. When Jane had said that she might like to join in with the children during some of their daily physical activities...of course I was elated and my elation grew when she had asked if she could read to the children tonight. When I saw her actually sat down on the floor and asked the children to gather around her...how that made me feel...she truly was meant to be a part of this family, I thought...and in fact, by her action and reactions to everything (so far), I felt that she was already part of this family. She seemed to be fitting right in with us and she hadn't even needed to be here for very long or get used to our ways. She seemed to connect straight away with them and it all. I really wanted to know what my children were thinking of \"Miss Jane\", but I also thought they should have the chance to spend a little more time with her before I asked them. The room...that idea had come to me while the three of them had been staying with Jane and myself in London and after I had invited them to spend Christmas at my place. The room had been a spare room that hadn't seen very much use as it is the smallest of the rest of the bedchambers. Years ago, Mary had insisted that it be turned into a bit of a sanctuary for myself if I ever felt the need for some peace, solace or thinking when the days were too cold, or too wet to be able to do so out of doors, or at night during the winter, as she knew that I sometimes liked to take walks about our place. She knew that I both liked and needed to be on my own from time to time, for the exact reasons already stated, but most especially when dealing with work. And the view...I had found it to be quite tranquil. I discovered that it could be quite relaxing just simply sitting and gazing out the windows at it... Mary had fixed it up a bit herself to make it more pleasant for me. As it is at the opposite end of the hallway from where the rest of the family sleep and where the children do their studies and play, this worked out very well. But then in London...I had had an inspiration...if Jane were to come and stay with us and for any length of time, she might want to carry on with her writing and I felt that this room would suit that purpose perfectly. As I had been going between London and Ireland for work, I found that I hadn't been using the room as much anyway and was willing to give up the room for this particular purpose. There were other rooms in the house in which I could retreat to if I found the desire to, even my own bedchamber could suffice for I was the soul occupant of it...for the time being. And even afterwards, as she would have the \"writing room\" as I had been referring to it to myself, I could still use the bedchamber for that purpose. The more I had thought about letting Jane use that room for her writing, the more I liked it and the more I was going to make it happen...or at least offer it to her. When I came back home, I found and purchased a small, elegant writing desk that would fit perfectly in the room (there hadn't been one until I thought to make it into a writing room for Jane as Mary refused to let the room become a second study or office for myself. She insisted that it remain a sanctuary and would not allow anything connected with my work in the room). I then had a couple of the maids give it a good going over until I was satisfied with it. I stood just inside of it one day after it was all ready and looked around. I could easily imagine Jane sitting at the desk bent over working diligently on her next greatest novel...I had smiled at the image I had conjured up... It was true what I told Jane tonight, I could not wait to show it to her. And I did want us to be alone when I did. As I didn't know how much of a chance I would get to do that with everyone around during the waking hours, I thought I had better take advantage and show it to her while everyone else was getting ready for bed. I could tell that she was both surprised and delighted with the room which touched my heart. Little did she know at this moment that the room was meant to be hers permanently and not only for a month...I went to sleep with my heart brimming. Jane: I felt a little bit like a young girl again, waking up to the excitement of it being Christmas morning as I had the intention of showing Cassandra the room that Tom had shown me the previous night, before our breakfast. I was quite eager to see it in all of it's glory during the day. \"Cassandra! Wake up!\" I pounced playfully on my sister who had still been asleep...until I assaulted her. \"I want to show you that room before we have to go down for breakfast. Let us hurry and make ourselves ready!\" I urged her. After I knew she was awake, I myself got out of bed, but before getting ready, I went over to the window to have a look outside to see what kind of a day it was starting off to be. I was a bit disappointed that there was no sun, but at least it wasn't raining...or snowing either. Still it was daylight and it should be bright enough to see the room, moreso than it had been the night before. Cassandra laughed at my enthusiasm and finally managed to arouse herself from bed and then almost as quickly as myself-I know she hurried for my sake, she wouldn't normally be quite this fast-she also got ready. Peeking out of our room, a quick glance in both directions of the hall told me that no one was about yet. Unless Tom was already downstairs. I could hear some noises coming from the children's rooms but I was not surprised that they should be up and most likely Phoebe, Sarah and Anna were busy getting them all ready for breakfast. I beckoned for Cassandra to follow me and together, we made our way quickly, but quietly down the hallway to the opposite end and stopped in front of the door. With anticipation, I opened the door and I urged Cassandra to step inside so that I could close it. For some reason I couldn't fathom, I didn't want anyone to know that we were in here. After I showed it to Cassandra, I wouldn't be quite so concerned about that, but for now, I just wanted it to be something that her and I share. Tom was true to his word. The room was even more delightful in the daylight. Even with no sun, the room was bright and rather cheery. How wonderful that even on the greyest of days the room would always have a cheerfulness to it, I thought to myself happily. I now noticed some little knickknacks about the room that suggested a woman's touch which helped to add to the charm and quaintness of the room. I wondered if they had belonged to Mary...I also noticed that there was a matching ottoman to the settee in the room that I had somehow missed the night before. \"This is lovely, Jane!\" Cassandra exclaimed as she looked about the room herself. \"Isn't it though?\" I replied as I fairly skipped over to the windows so that I could take a look at the landscape. Once again Tom was true to his word. Of course we had noticed the scenery on our ride over from Limerick but it could not compare with seeing it from the second story of Tom's place which showed off the fact that it was surrounded by rolling fields and hills and also cutting across the Lefroy land was part of the River Shannon that one could see winding it's way south west. How perfectly marvelous it must be in the summer to have the river so close by, I thought with a bit of envy that we wouldn't be here in the summer to enjoy the river in all of it's glory as well. Cassandra came over and joined me just then. \"Oh!\" she exclaimed as much enthralled with the view as I was. \"Tom must have really put a lot of thought into this Jane.\" She told me in a gentle tone, putting her arm around my waist as we both continued to gaze out of the window. I couldn't disagree with her. \"Imagine what all of this must look like on a sunny day!\" I exclaimed laughing lightly. \"Both the room and the view! But come Cass! Let us try out that settee together as if we were actually working on a story!\" I pulled her away from the window, over to and then down onto the settee with me. We both fell onto it laughing like giddy young lasses in love for the first time. Then I moved the ottoman in between us so that we could both place our feet upon it. \"This is all so wonderful!\" I exclaimed passionately. \"You look so happy here Jane, happy to be here.\" Cassandra smiled over at me. That stopped me cold. The wound within that for some reason refused to fully heal and disappear prevented me from becoming too involved with the whole idea of being a permanent residence of this wonderful Irish Lefroy place. I sat up suddenly and said seriously. \"But we must not lose ourselves Cass...we are only here for a month.\" \"Maybe more...\" Cassandra answered almost slyly, I thought. \"We might be here for more than the month, Jane. It is possible...\" \"No matter what the length of time Cass, it will all come crashing to an end.\" I reminded her stubbornly and none too subtly. Cassandra now sat up and once again put her arm around my shoulders this time. \"Then let's not think about the end Jane.\" She told me softly. \"We have just arrived. We've plenty of time. Let's just enjoy whatever time it is that we do have here and not think about the end, shall we?\" I looked over at Cassandra who seemed to be begging me with her eyes to agree with her. She was right really. We DID just arrive and I didn't want to think about the end already. \"We shall.\" I vowed with a smile. Tom: As was normal (aside from the cook and servants) I was the first one awake the next morning, made myself ready and went downstairs to consult the cook about breakfast. Once this was taken care of I went into my study that also doubled as my work office to look over some notes on the latest case I had taken on which was only just getting under way. It had worked out quite well as being so early on in the proceeding, I was able to bring my work home for the most part while I had company and work on it here, but I would still have to go into Limerick on occasion in order to confer with my client from time to time. I knew from past experience that because of the time of year, the actual court proceedings would be held off until the first part of January. I had of course, made the Austen's aware of my work situation during their visit. I decided to go over my notes now in order to give Anna and my sister's their chance to get my children ready for the day. My guests I would let sleep for as long as they liked as it would have been a long travel day for them the day before and they might appreciate the need for some extra rest. For this reason, I was on full alert for my children as I wanted to make sure that they did not make noise as they left their rooms and came down for breakfast. After a suitable amount of time had passed, I left my study and went upstairs to check on them. It would be a good chance for me to let them know that I was proud of how they had behaved the day before, without anyone being around...and...I admit it, I thought perhaps if I was to go and see them before they came downstairs that maybe they would share with me any of their thoughts of feelings of \"Miss Jane\" without me having to ask them. As I arrived at the top of the stairs, I could see that the Austen sister's door was now opened which puzzled me slightly. Even though I had been in my study, I was sure that they hadn't come downstairs for I'm sure I would have seen and heard them if they had. A thought occurred to me just then and before checking on my offspring, I went down the hall towards the room I had shown to Jane the night before. The door was closed but I could hear voices inside of it plainly enough. Jane and Cassandra were inside. I admit that I was a little disappointed that Jane had chosen to not wait for me to show her the room again during the day as I had wanted to see her reaction to it for myself. But I also knew that Jane and her sister are very close and I can't say that I am surprised that Jane had wanted to show it to Cassandra straight away. That in itself told me how happy she was with it. But that didn't stop me from wishing she had waited. I meant to turn away and head back down the hall when I heard Jane laugh and say: \"Imagine what all of this must look like on a sunny day! Both the room and the view! But come Cass! Let us try out that settee as if we were actually working on a story!\" I heard them move about the room and I could only assume, settle themselves on the settee. \"This is all so wonderful!\" Jane now said. \"You look so happy here Jane, happy to be here.\" I heard Cassandra's voice. My ears perked up at this and I was rooted to the spot even though it was wrong of me to be eavesdropping on their conversation. I won't deny that I was glad I had been there as my heart surged with those words. \"But we must not lose ourselves Cass...we are only here for a month.\" These words of Jane's made me shake my head and barely whisper, \" No, Jane! You will be here for longer!\" \"Maybe more...We might be here for more than the month, Jane. It is possible...\" I was grateful for Cassandra. \"No matter what the length of time Cass, it will all come crashing to an end.\" Jane now sounded sad to me. I shook my head and once again spoke in a bare whisper, \"No, Jane...it won't...not this time.\" \"Then let's not think about the end Jane. We have only just arrived. We've plenty of time. Let's just enjoy whatever time it is that we do have here and not think about the end, shall we?\" To these words I nodded my head vigorously like a fool. \"We shall.\" At least Jane sounded more positive about that. \"Dearest Jane!\" I cried silently as I gently laid one open hand upon the door.. \"It's yours! All of this is to be yours! I promise you!\" After hearing this part of their conversation, I had to wonder how long I would be able to hold off...suddenly what I had in mind seemed too far away...and I found myself doing all I could to hold myself back from going in and talking to Jane right at this very moment...but I had to. I had to hold off for now. It would be difficult I knew, but it had to wait. With a quiet sigh, I reluctantly pulled myself away from the door (as I didn't want to be caught standing there) and headed back towards my children's rooms to see how they were coming along. As I was walking away, I realized something...perhaps it had been better that I wasn't with Jane when she saw the room this morning because somehow, even though I'm sure it would have been obvious at how pleased she was with the room, she would not have been forthcoming by saying anything else as she had been when talking with her sister. Perhaps I could even go so far as to say that even though she had just arrived, she was already feeling...\"at home\" here. I smiled as I made my way down the hall, almost feeling a bit of a spring in my step as I did so. It was a rare thing I did, going into my children's rooms before breakfast as I would be getting myself ready for work a lot of mornings, but occasionally when I didn't have to go into work, or I had some time, I would surprise them with a pre-breakfast visit. \"Good morning, children!\" I announced cheerfully as I first knocked to announce my presence, then entered and closed the door behind me. I was greeted by several \"Father!\"'s and \"Good morning!\"'s and within moments I was surrounded by my children who looked like they were all ready go down to their breakfast. \"G' morning, Father!\" Little Mary cried out in her nearly 4 year old way ran up to me and into my arms that I held open for her as soon as I saw her running towards me. \"Good morning, dear one.\" I picked her up and kissed her on the cheek. \"And how are all of you doing this fine morning?\" I asked which was met with a chorus of \"Good and fine's\". I really should try and come into their rooms more often in the mornings, I suddenly thought. It really is a lovely way to start the day off like this, in this more casual manner with my children. \"I wanted to let you all know how very proud I am of you all for yesterday, you were very well behaved with our company.\" I beamed at them. \"Even Jeffry?\" George asked. I couldn't help but chuckle. \"Even Jeffry. He wasn't really being bad, just curious. Although...\" I now became more serious so that they would know I meant business and made sure that I made eye contact with each one of them as I spoke \"...it's always a good thing to try and remember your manners around company. I know it's not always easy, but I expect you to at least try.\" \"Yes, Father.\" was the general murmur of agreement. \"Father, I like them. I like how Miss Jane talks.\" Mary was the first to say something. \"Oh you do, do you? Do you mean, you liked it when Miss Jane was reading to us last night?\" I asked, delighted that someone had said something to start this conversation off. \"Yes!\" Mary replied happily. \"I liked that she sat down on the floor with us while she was reading.\" Thomas put in. \"Like...she was one of us.\" I noticed that most of the children nodded at this. Now that I had the opening I had been hoping for, I asked, \"Do you all find...our company...\" I had wanted to say Miss Jane but I also didn't think it was wise to single her out just yet. \"...acceptable then? I do realize they only just arrived yesterday and you haven't had much chance to get to know them, nor them you, but so far, there is no objection to them?\" To which there was a general shaking of heads, \"No..\" \"Good. I thought you might like them.\" I breathed an inaudible sigh of relief. \"As it looks like you are already for breakfast, why don't we all go down together, then. As our guests have had a long day yesterday, they may not be up and about yet this morning and we should allow them to rest. So we must be quiet on our way downstairs so as not to disturb them please! Okay then? Everyone understands that?\" When they all agreed, we made ready and left the room, me in front with Anna, Phoebe and Sarah following my brood and descended the staircase in a fairly decently quiet manner. Jane: Cassandra and I lingered and relaxed in \"my room\" for only a little while longer before we decided that we had better arouse ourselves and join the land of the living before our host began to wonder about us. Reluctantly, I slowly closed the door after we had both stepped out and we made our way towards the staircase. I confess that I now was feeling a little bit guilty about showing the room to Cassandra as now I remembered how Tom had said that \"we\" would check out the room today. But he had told me that it was my room to come and go as I pleased, and...I had so wanted to show it to Cassandra...I hoped he would understand and wouldn't mind that I had gone ahead. I would have to let him know. On our way back down the hall, I heard voices...or rather a voice coming from Tom's children's rooms and stopped. \"Cass!\" I whispered and she stopped by my side. \"Shhh...I think that's Tom in there.\" I had only meant to pause long enough to satisfy my curiosity. I think he must have only just entered the room for I could hear the children greeting him. Judging from the joyful surprise in children's voices, I could only suspect that Tom didn't often make an appearance in their rooms first thing in the morning, I thought it was lovely. But now I couldn't help myself, I wanted to hear how Tom interacted with his family without the presence of guests being around and I was not disappointed. It was as I had thought Tom would be with his family. Then I was treated to an unexpected surprise. It seemed that I...or I should say all of us really had \"passed the test\". Cassandra and I glanced at each other and smiled. Just then we heard Tom make the announcement that they would all go downstairs together and as Cassandra and I didn't think we would have time to beat them down the stairs we fairly flew back down to our room so that we wouldn't be caught and then waited for several minutes before leaving our room and heading down to join the Lefroy family for breakfast. Note to 'word fodder': You called it m'dear, about the room! Good guessing there! -D[Chapter 19] I've had a busy week (well past couple of weeks, really) but I'm hoping that after this weekend, things will start slowing down to more of a \"normal dull roar\" agan, lol. ;-D CHAPTER 18: Jane: We all met up at the breakfast table, with the exception of Henry and Eliza who had not made an appearance yet. \"Good morning Miss Austen...Jane..\" Tom stood up and greeted us and then sat us down. \"I hope you both slept well?\" \"Good morning, we did yes, thank you, Mr. Lefroy, very well.\" Cassandra answered for both of us. \"Good morning, Mr. Lefroy...Miss Lefroy, Sarah..\" I added my own greetings and then, \"Good morning children.\" with a smile at them. My greetings were returned by all including the children, although a bit more quietly as they seemed to be taken a bit by surprise that I had addressed them. While we were waiting for Henry and Eliza to show up, I decided it might be best to bring up the subject of Cassandra's and my earlier roaming. \"Mr. Lefroy...\" I now turned to Tom. \"Yes, Jane?\" \"I have a bit of a confession to make.\" \"Oh?\" \"Yes...I'm afraid that I was a bit impatient and could not wait to show Cassandra the lovely room you had shown me last night. You see, Cassandra helps me with my writing by giving me her input and we discuss certain aspects of the stories, mostly to do with the characters and in a sense I feel that it would be just as much hers as mine in that respect. I hope you understand that I really wanted to be able to show it to her on my own and we did so this morning before coming downstairs.\" Tom gazed at me for a couple of seconds before breaking into a smile and said, \"Of course, Jane. It is like I told you last night that the room is yours to come and go as you please. I trust you still found it as acceptable this morning as you did last night?\" \"Oh yes, Tom! Even more so if that is at all possible. All is as you told me last night and the view is splendid.\" \"It certainly is a lovely room Tom.\" Cassandra now added. \"I'm happy you approve.\" Tom replied to both of still smiling, but then he turned his focus to me and his eyes told me so much more than his words. I had to look away before I started blushing under his gaze. \"What is this you need Tom's approval for Jane?\" As usual, Henry just happened to be entering the room at a most convenient time. Not soon enough to know what we were talking about but in time to be curious about what we had been talking about. \"I hope my youngest sister has at least been behaving herself, Tom?\" He now addressed Tom with a bit of a grin. Oh how Henry could not resist teasing me and more so, I had noticed in particular when we were in London, in Tom's presence too! \"Really Henry!\" Eliza tried to chastise him. \"Leave poor Jane alone for once!\" \"Jane has been a perfect guest.\" Tom answered Henry firmly...which did make me blush somewhat. In order to take the attention away from myself, I now asked of Tom. \"When would be an appropriate time in which I will be able to listen to Jane play, Tom?\" \"Probably this afternoon when her studies are done. Unless Sarah and Phoebe can spare her from helping with the younger children's studies for a little while, this morning. Sarah? Phoebe? Would it be alright if Jane does a little playing for our guest this morning? Perhaps right after breakfast even and while the rest of the children are starting their own studies.\" Tom suggested. \"I'm sure that would be fine Tom.\" Phoebe agreed. \"Jane can always do her studies right after.\" \"Yes, that won't be a problem Tom.\" Sarah added her own input. \"Good. Then you may take Miss Jane with you to the music room when are finished with your breakfast and have been excused, Jane. But now it is time to for us to eat, please let us bow and give thanks.\" This time was Tom who said the blessing.. Throughout the morning meal, I watched young Jane as closely as I was able to without making it look obvious and sort of saw what Tom had been referring to about her looking after her younger siblings. It was she who made sure that they were eating and were quiet and minding their manners at the table and likewise it was Jane that the younger ones addressed if they needed or wanted anything. But she also might be like that at meal times when all of the adults are together, so that her aunts would be free to converse with the rest of us without any disturbance. I really couldn't be sure. One thing, I was starting to form somewhat of a theory about Jane of my own based on my memories of her in London and the little I have seen of her thus far in her own home. I finally found myself alone with Jane after we had finished a pleasant breakfast meal and had been excused. She lead me through the main entrance way and towards the music room, the room that held the piano. After we entered I went to close the door and then thought I should ask Jane if she thought it would be alright that I did so. After her affirmative reply, I went ahead and did so, then joined her at the piano. \"Which would you like me to play first Miss Aus...excuse me...Miss Jane?\" she asked of me politely. \"Oh it doesn't matter to me dearest, I should like to hear all that you have been practicing. You start where you want and play through all of them in whichever order.\" After which I left her sitting at the piano and sat down in one of the chairs closest to her. What I heard amazed me...she had been good when I heard her in London, but she really had come quite far since then. I was more than impressed as she played song after song for me. When at last she finished, I couldn't help but clap as I stood up and went over to her. \"That was wonderful Jane! I can tell you worked very hard and diligently since I saw you in London last. You play beautifully!\" An idea came into my head just then. \"You know...we cannot...should not hide this talent of yours.\" She looked at me questioningly. \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean that...maybe you should have a bit of recital.\" Jane gasped at this, just as another idea came into my head. \"Wait...the Christmas Ball. You should play at the Christmas Ball!\" \"Oh...I don't know that I should...\" Jane replied then I could see her practically biting her tongue and blush for I'm sure she felt she shouldn't contradict me. I became thoughtful. I really thought she should do this. \"You wouldn't have to actually make it like a recital...but what you could do is just play the piano when there is a break from the dancing...while people are milling about, visiting and when they are eating. It would be more like...background music. And...if it would make you feel any better, I could sit with you at the piano.\" Jane didn't say anything at first, I could tell that she was thinking about it. Finally she said, \"Miss Jane...I will do it that way if...\" she stopped here. \"Yes?\" I encouraged her. \"If...would you play a duet with me first?\" She finally blurted out. Now I was the surprised one. But...it was a good idea. Perhaps it would settle her nerves somewhat if we were to do a duet. \"That is a fine idea, I accept.\" I told her with a smile. \"But...we should ask your father for his permission first to do this of course.\" Jane looked visibly relieved at my answer as she agreed with me. \"And then...we shall have to pick out a piece that we both like and get to practicing it.\" With this, we both left the music room to go in search of Tom whom we found in his study. He first looked up and then stood up as we entered. \"I trust the piano playing went well?\" He asked of us. \"Oh quite well...very well indeed! In fact...that is why we have come...\" I replied. Tom looked at me in askance. \"Yes?\" \"I could tell that Jane has put a lot of hard work and effort into her practicing over the past few months. She plays beautifully. And it was my idea that her talent on the piano should be shown.\" \"In what way?\" Tom now wore a slight frown on his face. \"At first I was thinking of a recital, but then I thought perhaps it would be better if she were to play a little bit at the Christmas Ball. Sort of background music when there is a break in the dancing. While people are visiting and eating. That way, she won't be..\"on display\", but could still be heard enough. We would like your permission for her to do so.\" \"And you think you would like to do this Jane?\" Tom asked his daughter. \"Yes Father, I think I should...I think I should like to try.\" \"I have promised Jane that I will sit with her while she plays if she likes and she and I will also play a duet which of course we will need to take the time to learn.\" Tom took a few minutes to think this over before answering, \"Then you have my permission. We will have to arrange a time for the two of you to learn your song as well as continue practice for Jane.\" Now he smiled at us both. He seemed to be genuinely pleased with this idea. \"She has been practicing in the afternoons after all of her schooling and activities are done for the day.\" Tom went on. \"If it would be alright, we could continue on with the same time. We may need a little extra time for our duet, although Jane has become so good at the other songs I have taught her, she won't need to really practice them as much, as long as she keeps up on them.\" \"Very well. Jane you may return to your studies now.\" Tom instructed. Jane bowed slightly to us and left the room. \"Thank you Tom, I really think this will be a good thing for Jane. You may not like the idea of putting her out in front of everyone like a show piece, but this way, she can show her talent without having to become the main focus of everyone's attention. She was reluctant to do it that way anyway, which is why I switched from the idea of a recital to having her play at the Christmas Ball. And now in hindsight, I believe the Christmas Ball would be the better idea of the two for Jane anyway, to not put her directly onto a stage in front of everyone, straight away.\" \"You read both myself and my daughter very well Jane and I appreciate it. You are correct in that I do not like the idea of her nor any of my children to be exposed while they are still children in this way. I want them to have as normal a childhood as is possible. There will be plenty of time when they are adults to take that route in life if they wish it.\" \"And I both agree and respect your wishes about that Tom. I also think this is good for Jane's social skills.\" Tom frowned at me. \"In what way do you mean Jane?\" \"Forgive me Tom, but I feel that Jane has perhaps...\"stifled\" herself in that respect. Whether on purpose or subconsciously, I do not know. But I think that she feels caught between wanting to be more sociable yet feeling more comfortable just being amongst her siblings. She will be reaching that age where she should be wanting to go to balls...\" I noticed Tom's expression of mixed emotions as I said this, so I proceeded quickly, \"Not in hopes of getting a husband...at least not yet, but for fun. For the experience. Balls are a part of life...and society. They play a big role in helping develop social skills. You don't want Jane to become the mother of her siblings...this is one way in which she can start to become the young lady she is not that long in becoming and should. I believe that Jane both desires to be a part of society yet she also fears it, so she uses the excuse that her brother's and sister's need her to be their mother in order to avoid it. And by playing at the Christmas Ball, it could be a start for her with both becoming more comfortable in society and overcoming the fear part of it.\" Tom was silent for several minutes while he mulled over my analysis of his daughter. Then in a quiet voice, \"She was definitely more sociable when Mary was alive...\" He admitted softly. My heart went out to Jane...and Tom, really. \"Then you have my full support of this idea of yours, Jane.\" He agreed once again even more firmly than he had before. \"Thank you Tom, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.\" I flashed him a smile. \"Thank you Jane...for being so observant. And...everything.\" He smiled back at me. \"If you will excuse me then, I will leave you to your work now.\" I bowed slightly, with every intention of leaving the room. Tom: While Jane had been giving me her own thoughts on my oldest daughter, a funny notion was also starting to creep into my own mind...an idea that shocked me...and even shook me to my core... When Mary was alive, everything was of course, normal with my family. But after her death...as I had told Jane, I had noticed my own daughter changing...becoming more serious and more like a mother to her younger siblings. But when Jane pointed out how she seemed to be more comfortable with mothering her own siblings than to be out in society like a young girl should...I couldn't help but wonder...was I in part or maybe even fully to blame for that? Had I, after Mary's death and seeing how Jane reacted, been too protective of her? Had I sheltered her too much to try and keep her from as much of the pain as possible? With Mary gone...had I...the idea was almost too much for me to bear...but...I forced myself to...with Mary gone...had I, in some subconscious way, wanted to somehow keep Jane from growing up so that one day, she too wouldn't leave me? And because of that, had I been the one who kept her so well protected? TOO well protected? Was I the one who had actually been \"stifling\" Jane's social skills so that she was starting to fear society and not wish to be a part of it? Again...so that she wouldn't leave me? I suddenly felt ill. \"Tom?\" I heard a voice come from out of the recesses of my mind. \"Tom! Are you alright?\" I looked up as I followed the direction of where the voice was coming from and realized that Jane had not left the room yet after all, her expression having turned to one of genuine concern as she quickly made her way over to me. \"Tom! You've gone deathly white! Are you ill? Let me fetch you some water, you stay put.\" Unable to speak, I pointed a slightly shaky finger to my water and glasses to Jane who very quickly and efficiently poured some, brought it over to me for which I took very gratefully some and gulped it down my suddenly dry throat, Jane dropping down onto her knees before me while I drank. \"Tom...\" Jane finally spoke after several seconds of watching me closely, sounding a bit relieved and even had a bit of a smile playing on her lips. \"There...you've got some colour back in your face now at least. Do you think you are ill or coming down with something perhaps?\" \"No...\" I was touched by her concern for me and replied in a bit of a shaky voice. \"Jane...\" I gulped as I spoke, \"I have to ask you something...I need your opinion...\" \"Of course Tom...what is it?\" Jane asked gently, looking up into my face, still on her knees before me. Taking a deep breath, in a quiet, subdued voice, I disclosed Jane the conclusion I had just discovered about myself to her. \"Oh Tom...\" Jane started off when I had finished. \"I think that you were...are just being a protective father of his daughter after she had lost her mother...and as you should. She is the oldest daughter after all and you said yourself how close she and her mother were. You saw the changes her mother's death brought on...it concerned you, I am sure. Perhaps you were being a little over protective, but I think you were acting in a fairly normal manner. However, you are going to have to \"let her go\" you do realize. You will have to accept the fact that one day there could very well be another man in her life who will take over from you and you will have to let her go.\" After confessing my new found fear to Jane, I started feeling much better. And after listening to her, I knew she was right. \"I know.\" I agreed finally smiling weakly down at her. My \"crisis\" seemingly over, Jane now stood up and returned the smile. \"It's funny how it seems to be the fathers who have a harder time letting their daughters go. Mothers cannot wait to get their daughters out into society in order to find a suitable husband, preferably one well off, but fathers seem content to keep their daughters at home...at least until a man they feel is good enough for their daughter is found. At least in some cases. Perhaps not all, but in some.\" I allowed a small chuckle to escape, thinking that she sounded quite right in her what she said. \"Thank you, Jane.\" I said quietly. \"You're welcome Tom, of course. And now...I feel I can leave you to your work.\" I nodded my head slightly, wishing I had a reason to keep her in my study for just a little while longer, but as I couldn't, I had to let her go. Gazing after her retreating form, I was still seeing her on her knees at the my feet and looking up at me with genuine concern both in her beautiful deep brown eyes and on her lovely face...Jane was not making it easy for me to have to wait... Jane: I left the room with one place in mind to go...his library. On the way there, I thought back to our little talk and Tom's \"episode\" which seemed to be the result of \"shock\". It had given me such a fright to see him go so deathly white in the matter of just seconds. He had looked fine when I was set to leave his office in the first place, but when his face had turned colour so drastically and so suddenly, it really gave my heart a turn. I was glad that I had been there and was able to help him overcome it. \"Poor Tom.\" I thought to myself. \"He too is feeling the consequences of his wife's death with his own children.\" That idea though, was more proof to me how much he loved his family, how devoted he was to them. Even with a houseful of help between his sisters and servants, he was still feeling that it was not easy emotionally to bring up his children without their mother. This thought saddened me somewhat. \"I must do whatever I can to help him out while I am here.\" I decided firmly. One thing, I was glad to see that in some ways, Tom was a lot like my own father with his children, being very kind, gentle and loving with them. I loved my father, he had always been encouraging of my writing. For that I will be forever grateful. And with that thought, I found myself in his library where I spent the rest of the morning, looking over his books and even finding some that were appealing to me. I only took one for now though and thought how that lovely room Tom had given to me would also be a nice place in which to read in. Which reminded me...I should seek out Cassandra...although I was sure she would be with Henry and Eliza. I looked around the library and decided that I would sit and read for a bit in here first... I hadn't realized the time when suddenly Cassandra had entered the library. \"There you are, Jane!\" Her voice startled me out of my reading. \"It is time for our lunch!\" \"Already?\" I asked, surprised that the morning was almost gone. \"Yes! Is there where you hid yourself after you listened to Jane play?\" She asked. \"Afterwards, we had a talk with Tom.\" I then filled her in on how I felt that Jane should play at the Christmas ball and how we had taken the idea to Tom. I left out the part about Tom having become briefly ill as I didn't think it was my right to tell her something that I felt was more personal for Tom. \"I apologize. I was thinking of looking for you, but I had wanted to check out Tom's library and when I found this book I had only meant to read a bit of it, but became intrigued by it. What have you been doing this morning?\" \"Henry, Eliza and myself have been keeping ourselves occupied in the sitting room that we were in last night. I thought I should write to mama and let her know that we have arrived safely.\" \"That was good of you Cassandra. I'm sure that she will be wanting to hear from us.\" I felt a bit guilty as that idea hadn't even occurred to myself. \"They sent me to find you, Jane so we really should make our way to the dining room.\" \"Yes, of course.\" I stood up and with my book, we left the library. As we passed the staircase, I told Cassandra that I should take the book I had found upstairs to our room. I told her that she could carry on to the dining room without me, but she said she would wait. I promised only to be a moment and flew up the stairs as quickly as I could, then returned to her in good time where we joined the rest in the dining room. All were there already. I felt guilty for having held them up. \"I do apologize for keeping you all waiting.\" I said straight away. \"I went into your library Mr. Lefroy where I found a book and had only intended on reading a little bit, but found myself so immersed that the time slipped away on me.\" Tom had stood up when we entered the dining room and answered while he seated us, \"Do not worry about it Jane. I am happy to hear that you have found some reading material that interests you.\" Once we were all seated, the blessing said, and we had started in on the food, Tom spoke to his children..and to his sisters. \"As there has been no snow or rain today..and the clouds are starting to break apart a bit, I think taking a walk might be would be an idea.\" I noticed that his children seemed to like the idea of being able to get outside for their faces seemed to brighten at the mention of it. I also liked it. I had been hoping for the chance to have a walk on his land. \"Oh, I should very much like to take a walk on your grounds, Mr. Lefroy. Would it be alright if I join the children when they go on their walk? Perhaps they can show me around a bit. I should also like to see the river that runs across your land.\" \"I am sure the children wouldn't object to you joining us, Jane.\" Tom smiled at me. Us? I first thought. Oh yes...Tom had told us that he sometimes will take part in the children's activities whenever he is able to. Looking at Tom's offspring, I could see that they were once again taken by surprise a little bit by my request. \"Oh please do join us, Jane!\" Sarah now added in delight. \"It would be so lovely to have you.\" \"Thank you Sarah. I am already looking forward to seeing more of this splendid place.\" As we continued on with our meal and conversations, I could tell that Tom would look at me from time to time. I'm sure he was pleased that I had asked to join them. It was true, I was looking forward to the outing. At the allotted time, Tom went around and gathered us all. As it turned out, Henry, Eliza and Cassandra had all decided to come along as well. Tom's children had already been gathered and were already in their outer-wear by the time we met them at the door. \"To save us time.\" Tom explained with a bit of a twinkle in his eye. \"Instead of having all of us trying to get into everything at once.\" I couldn't help but smile at that. We were all one fairly big group that headed outside into what had become more of a sunny day, making the colours in the scene before us even more vivid. Once we were down the stairs and away from the house, the children seemed more at ease and almost at once, Anthony and the boys ran a little ways from the group and started at what looked to me like they were chasing each other, but soon I realized that Anthony was actually chasing all of them, each of the younger ones trying to protect themselves by either hiding behind another or even playfully pushing another into Anthony's path. \"Play fairly, Anthony!\" Tom called after them. \"Don't forget that you are bigger than they!\" I saw Anthony nod his head towards his father to let him know that he had heard him and understood, then slowed his running so as not to easily overtake his younger brothers. We all had stopped to watch the boys play who were now not only running but laughing as they tried to keep away from Anthony. I could see that Anthony was pretending to not be able to catch them but finally he caught the youngest, George. Then Anne couldn't seem to keep still any longer and she too ran and joined in the game. \"Come on Jane! \"You join us too!\" Anthony called out. At first I thought he was talking to me, until young Jane answered him. \"Not right now, Anthony.\" I wondered if the reason why Jane had decided to not join in had something to do with her age...maybe she was starting to become that young woman... We all watched and laughed at the five of them laughing and running. As we continued to watch, I started to see that once Anthony caught one, the one caught would team up with Anthony and also start to give chase on the rest. One by one, the boys were all caught which left only had Anne left whom I could see that having a bit of a harder time than the boys running in her dress. It was unfair to her, I thought, her being a girl, in a dress and having four boys after her. I couldn't help myself, I ran to where she was as I wanted to help Anne even though I was sure that Anthony at least was playing as fairly as he could. Anne was older than the older three boys, but it still wasn't fair, I didn't think. I found myself getting caught up in the game, keeping Anne out of the reach of all of the boys and laughing as I did so, enjoying myself as much as the children. I was so caught up in having to keep an eye on all of the boys and keep Anne out of their way, that I jumped out of my skin when I suddenly felt hands clamp gently down on my own shoulders and simultaneously heard a soft \"Got you!\" right by my ear. I whirled around to see that it was Tom who had \"got\" me. I was so surprised that I could not say a word at first as I looked up into his laughing blue eyes. Realizing that it had been his hands that had been on my shoulders sent a tingling sensation surging through my body that I had not felt in 17 years...of course we had done the customary touching whenever he helped me either in or out of the carriage back in London (I didn't even know if it had been he or Henry who had helped me out of the carriage here at his home in Ireland, but I had a strong suspicion...) and whenever he had escorted me, but this time it was different...it was the same feeling I had felt whenever Tom and I had touched me during our...\"courtship\" 17 years ago...a sensation hard to describe. After I had left him all of those years ago, I had worked hard on making myself forget how it had made me feel every time we had touched during that time...and now...I almost believe that this time, that \"tingling\" feeling might have even become stronger now... When I was able to finally pull myself away from him and found my wits again, I said lightly, \"Mr. Lefroy...it is obvious that you do not play fairly yourself.\" \"I don't? And how so?\" He asked. \"It is young Mr. Lefroy and the young boys who are giving chase, not yourself.\" I pointed out. Tom's smile widened as he said, \"Ah, but Miss Austen, you were not playing fairly either then as you were not part of the game when they started playing. You jumped into it nearly at the end of the game.\" \"Only to help Anne as I didn't think it was fair to have four boys against one girl who has a harder time running in a dress than a boy would in trousers. I was merely evening the odds a little bit for her.\" \"I see...\" Tom replied thoughtfully. \"And you yourself jumped into the game at the end siding with the boys which once again lessened the odds I was trying to make for Anne.\" \"I did not join in to side with the boys though, Miss Austen.\" \"Oh?\" \"No.\" He replied, those eyes of his, now seemed to be sparkling. \"I was hoping to engage in a little game with you.\" Now I was so surprised I couldn't think of what to say at first. Then finally after a few seconds, \"Then you still were not playing fairly Mr. Lefroy as I did not know that you had started a game with me.\" I objected. Tom first gazed at me with his half smile then bowed slightly in acknowledgement of my words and said, \"You are right of course Miss Austen, I had not informed you of my intent. It was not fair of me.\" \"Mr. Lefroy...\"I found myself unable to resist adding, \"Had I known you were playing, I perhaps could have given chase after you.\" As soon as I spoke, I realized what those words could mean and wished them back immediately. Tom expression became one of amusement at my words. \"Yes...I guess you could have...if you had wanted to.\" I detected the double meaning behind his answer...I had hoped he wouldn't come to the same conclusion I had as soon as I had spoken them, but, it appeared he had after all. However, he didn't go on about it and perhaps he did it keep me from further embarrassment. If so, I had to be grateful to him for it. \"But as I caught you we are on the same side now, so you can't give chase to me now.\" He finished. During our exchange the boys had caught Anne thus ending the game-or so I would assume-so I took advantage of it as a way out of my own situation with Tom. \"As everyone has been caught, I should like to go and see the river now, if that is alright with you Mr. Lefroy.\" Still wearing an amused expression, Tom replied, \"That is fine with me Miss Austen, lead the way children, but mind you are careful down there, you know the rules regarding the riverbanks, especially when the ground is wet!\" He ended rather sternly, clearly to make certain they remembered the dangers of a slippery riverbank. \"Anthony, Jane I want you to both of you keep a good, firm watch of your younger siblings down there!\" He added before a chorus of 'Yes, Father\"'s were heard as they all acknowledged their father's warning, then ran off towards the river ahead of the rest of us. Only little Mary stayed with us now holding onto her father's hand, Tom not allowing his youngest daughter to go off with her brother's and sister's to the river. I couldn't say that I blamed him there. \"Will they really be alright without an adult down there to supervise them?\" Eliza asked, surprised. \"They'll be fine.\" Tom replied full of confidence. \"They have grown up here and have learned early on about the dangers of the riverbank...as well as that any misbehaviour of any kind by the river will be strictly dealt with. As we are right behind them, we will be there momentarily ourselves.\" As we started off to follow the children, to my surprise I felt little Mary's mittened hand reach up and try to take my own into hers. I looked down into the sweet face and smiled at her realizing with a profound tenderness in my heart that this little thing most likely couldn't even remember her mother...and never would. Although, I had no doubt in my mind that Tom would make sure that she knew about her mother. I took the little hand into my own and when I looked up again, I noticed Tom was gazing at me with that expression that I still refused to allow my heart and mind accept in the way I wanted to interpret it... It was lovely down by the river, I had noticed that there were trees scattered here and there along the river bank on either side. One day before we left, I knew I would have to take a walk along this river, in either direction and see where it would take me. But for now, I couldn't concentrate on it fully as I was doing all I could do to keep my mind from wandering back to Tom and our exchanges since coming outside this afternoon...[Chapter 20] Chapter 19: Jane: The days were slipping by pleasantly enough, in the mornings while the children were at their studies, Cassandra and myself would quite often find ourselves in the \"writing room\" working this time on a story we agreed to call, \" The Elliots\" , or in Tom's library reading or spending time with Henry and Eliza, both of them being interested in my next writing project as well. We included them in on it and let them help us out with their own opinions. The afternoons I spent a fair amount of them joining in with the children, Sarah and Tom with their physical activities. We went outside as often as we possibly could but of course there were days when we had to use the big room on the main level. I could see that the children preferred to be outdoors during this time as they were limited inside, even in this big empty room...and they knew to be more careful in it. However, we still managed to play a variation of the chasing game I had joined in on that first afternoon, and other games such as Blind Mans Bluff where Tom volunteered to be the Blind Man trying to \"find\" us all, everyone breathless and laughing by the end. After the physical part of our day, is when Jane and myself went to the music room and worked our both her solo piano pieces-which, because she had done so much practicing after we had left London, didn't really need a lot of work done on them-and the piece we decided we would do as our duet at the Christmas Ball. As Jane didn't need to practice as much on her solo pieces I decided to start her playing some Christmas music which I had promised her we would play just for her family and which we could play on Christmas Eve and/or Christmas Day. It was during this time that I found out about her unusual middle name, \"Christmas\". One would assume that she must have been born on or very near Christmas, but I learned that her birthday is June 24th, which is exactly 6 months before Christmas Eve Day and Christmas was her mother Mary's favourite holiday. To round out the day and evening, there was tea, dinner and the nightly reading which, I would sometimes read..or Jane, or Anne...or a little less often, one of the older boys...and even Tom would do his share as well. It was during one of these nights that I found little Mary coming over to me, much to my surprise and make herself comfortable in my lap. I caught Tom's expression when this had happened the first time...it was unmistakable...I had to look away because I still was having a hard time wanting to accept the look on his face...in his eyes. The children too seemed to be becoming more comfortable with me around and whenever I read, instead of lining up rather rigidly in front of me, they gathered more closely around me in more of a casual semi circle. After one of Jane's and my piano practices, Tom met us outside the door of the music room. \"I wish to speak to Miss Jane for a moment, please.\" He addressed his daughter who left the room quickly. \"Jane...\" he spoke as he entered the room. \"I hope it's not too much to ask of you, but it seems that Anne has now become interested in learning to play the piano and wishes that you could teach her as well. I said that I would have to ask you but that she must respect your decision.\" \"Oh Tom...I...I could...I have never taught anyone right from the beginning, but...I suppose I could try. However, as Jane and myself must keep on practicing until the Christmas Ball...I wonder if she would mind waiting until after it before starting in on her own lessons? I will be more than happy to try then, but for now, I don't know that I have enough time. I hope that is alright.\" \"That is fine Jane, I understand. I will explain it to Anne who will have to be patient.\" \"I do hope she will understand Tom.\" \"I'm sure she will. I think she will be happy to know that you will give her some lessons. And now...\" Tom offered me his arm which I took. \"It is time for our tea.\" With the days passing in a this manner, I was finding it quite easy to \"fit in\" and become used to the daily ritual of the Lefroy house-hold...and in fact finding myself quite enjoying it...which was the double edged sword. As like in London, I knew I would have to depart from this one day, which saddened me. But as Cassandra had also told me, that morning I had showed her the room that Tom had \"given\" me, to not think about the end, but to enjoy the days there. I had to continue to just take each day as they came and enjoy them all to the fullest and NOT think about the day that will come that will take us...me away from here. And there was still so much that was to happen with the Christmas Ball and Christmas itself which were both fast approaching... I awoke on December 16th, the day of my birth to a delightful but rare sunny winter day in Ireland. As birthdays are generally quietly observed and only my family, that is Cassandra, Henry and Eliza, are the only ones here who would know about it, I did not expect anything special and that was fine with me. If I enjoyed the day, that was all that I wanted of it, I didn't require anything more. And as I had been enjoying our visit on the whole, there was no reason to believe that today should be any different. \"Happy birthday, sister dear!\" Cassandra greeted me with a smile as soon as she was awake. \"Hush Cass!\" I teased her with a smile. Cassandra knew that I would not like it if my birthday were ever found out by the Lefroy house-hold and most especially by Tom. But I could not resist teasing her a bit when she had greeted me, even though I knew she was being quiet. She laughed lightly at me and I joined in. I could already feel that it was going to be a pleasant day. I had previously made Henry and Eliza promise that they were NOT to say anything about it being my birthday, they were not to bring it up out loud to anyone. Even though Henry can be a tease at times, he knows enough not to push me and this time he did realize that I was being completely serious when I said that I did not want anyone outside of our family to know about today. Even Cassandra and Eliza had sided with me against Henry for which I was truly grateful. I knew then that he would not break that promise, so I felt I could go about the day without any worries about my birthday being found out. Plus, it was little Mary's 4th birthday in only 3 days and I felt the focus should be on her, not myself. And indeed the day passed on as pleasantly as it always had, but as the sun was shining that morning, I could found I could not stay in the writing room...nor even the library. I had to be outside in the sun. \"Cass!\" I exclaimed suddenly, causing my sister to jump slightly. Even though it was lovely in the writing room with the sun shining in, I was restless. \"Let us you and me go and take a walk by the river this morning instead of writing. I cannot seem to concentrate on it anyway and I think a walk would do me some good in my thinking of it. And in fact, I won't think about it for awhile. Perhaps what I need is a break from it.\" \"Of course Jane. That sounds like a fine idea. I think I could use a walk as well.\" Cassandra agreed. \"The break will do us both some good.\" It wouldn't be the first time that I had taken a walk down by the river, although there had not been very many days since arriving in which I could take a pleasant walk, but I had managed to get a couple of walks in, none the less. And today, as it was sunny, I was going to take full advantage of it. We made ourselves ready, let Henry and Eliza know what we were doing and checked the time to give us an idea of how long we should be, then left. I fairly skipped down the stairs and towards the direction of the river, Cassandra having to walk quickly in order to keep up with me. \"Slow down Jane! We have a plenty of time!\" She begged me to which I did. She was right. I shouldn't hurry such a lovely walk. I did as she asked and slowed down. We continued our walk amicably towards the river and then once we had arrived, followed it some ways down, through the Lefroy property, over a couple of hillocks and passed trees and bushes. We came to rest at a spot that had become one of my favourites along the river. I liked that it lay between two hillocks and a huge tree was right on the riverbank, hanging over the river. I could imagine how lovely it must be in the summer here. I liked it because I felt it could be a place of refuge if I ever wanted to come here on my own sometime...if I ever needed a place in which I wanted or needed to be on my own to think as no one would be able to see me here unless they were looking for me. I suddenly stopped myself with my thinking here. I really shouldn't be allowing myself to think of such fanciful ideas when I wasn't always going to be here. I realized that it had been wrong of me to think of this lovely spot as my own special place on Tom's property... But then it was my birthday, I told myself stubbornly. If no other day, I should come here today and allow myself to think of it as my place and enjoy it for a short time with my sister, which we did. I linked my arm with hers and we laughed and talked of anything but \"The Elliots\" and of Tom. We talked of things that we would normally talk of at home. We talked of our mother and wondered how our brother James and his family were managing with our mother. I almost started to feel guilty about that, but then I reminded myself that Cass and myself had always lived with and had been looking after our mother. We were entitled to have our time away from her as well. After a bit of time, we reluctantly started to make our way back to Tom's house. The rest of the day passed by as normally as it always does and by our own bedtime, I had spent my birthday enjoying the day, which is all I wanted. As I went to follow my sister out of the library and to our room, I felt a hand gently touch my shoulder. \"Jane...I wish to speak with you for a moment if I might.\" Tom voice said softly. I nodded to Cassandra to go ahead, I would be upstairs shortly, then Tom did something unexpected...he shut the door behind Cassandra. \"Jane...I have something I wish to ask of you.\" He started off as he turned towards me. He seemed to be having a hard time finding the right words in which to begin. He paced the room a little bit first before, \"Jane...the Christmas Ball is only a week away...and...I wish for...that is...I would like it if you...I would really like for you to be by my side when greeting our guests as they arrive.\" He finally got out. I stared at Tom in astonishment. I had not expected this. \"Not as \"Jane Austen, Authoress\", I want to stress that.\" He continued quickly. He knew me too well. I had been about to object to his offer for that very reason. This is when I noticed that he had stopped pacing and had stood right in front of me. He took a deep breath before he resumed. \"But as my fianc e...\" Now I really was dumbfounded. I couldn't speak. I needed to sit. Tom seemed to realize this and as he had done in London, he gently guided me to a settee, sat me down and then sat down beside me. Now that he had it out in the open, Tom seemed to find it easier to speak himself. \"I cannot hold this in any longer Jane...I told you back in London that I never stopped loving you. That was true then and is still true. If anything, spending the time that we have together, both in London and here, I have come to love you even more since that day in London if that is at all possible. I have been observing you with Jane first in London and now here again in Ireland. Not only with Jane but with my other children as well and you seem to...\"belong\" here with all of us. I've been both watching my children and talking with them...my children adore you Jane...I adore you...I want you by my side...always...as my wife...as Mrs. Tom Lefroy.\" I thought I was still at a loss for words, but somehow I managed to get them out, although it sounded like my voice was coming from another part of the room as it sounded far away. \"But what of your family, Mr. Lefroy...I...I mean...your uncle...\" I found my mouth felt a bit dry as I spoke. \"Who is no longer alive, don't forget Jane. And even if he were, I have not depended upon him for nearly 17 years. After Mary and myself married, I no longer needed his help. And I now have established myself as a lawyer here, Jane. People come to me when needing a lawyer or legal advice. I do not depend upon anyone but myself.\" \"But...the Lefroys, Tom...they never were in favour of a union between you and me.\" I tried to point out. Tom frowned. \"I don't understand who you mean?\" \"If your uncle did not approve then surely there are others in your family who would not either.\" \"My uncle was not a Lefroy, Jane...he was a Langlois, on my mother's side. He was in fact my mother's uncle...my great uncle.\" But I remained obstinate. \"But still...Tom...he was a blood relative of yours.\" \"Jane...you never met any of other Lefroys aside from my Aunt Anne and Uncle George. I believe that my parents would have liked you had they lived to meet you. I also firmly believe that my brothers and my sisters whom you haven't met but will at the Christmas Ball will also like you. But even if they didn't, it wouldn't matter to me because I love you and I want to marry you...and there isn't ANYTHING that ANYONE can do to stop us this time. I can finally provide for both of us Jane, give you the life you deserve. The life I WANT to give you...the one I could not give you 17 years ago, but can now. Please. Let me Jane...\" Tom looked at me so imploringly it almost hurt my heart to look at him...yet, I could hardly look away. I wanted...oh yes, I wanted what he offered, but I was still so afraid... I felt Tom's hands gently take mine in his, a gesture that both astonished me and started to melt that part of my heart that had been trying so hard for so long to keep Tom away from reaching it. \"I understand that you are afraid because of what happened the last time...\" He said very quietly. That did it, I now felt tears gather in my eyes but I would do my best to not make them fall...they couldn't... \"Jane...do you believe in fate?\" Tom asked of me, gently. But he didn't wait for an answer for he went on. \"I do. I truly believe that we had been given a second chance the moment we saw each other last summer in London. After we had our chance to talk privately, I knew right at that moment that I was going to ask you to marry me. It was part of the reason why I had invited you to stay with me there. I was not going to let you go and let you walk out of my life again after that...I could not. I felt that it was meant to be for us. I no longer was being depended upon, I am a successful lawyer who relies solely on myself. I could provide for you...and I was...am still in love with you. I feel that you are too. You have not told me so in words, but you have in actions. You need not have accepted my offer to stay at my place in London nor come all this way for Christmas...yet...you did. That tells me something.\" Tom stopped here to catch his breath. \"Do you remember Jane...17 years ago when you asked me at my uncle's in London if you could really have all of this? I asked you what you meant and you said, \"You..\" meaning me and a life with me. And during Wisley's Ball in the garden, I told you that I was yours heart and soul. I still am Jane. I always have been and I always will be.\" As Tom had been speaking these words a lump was starting to form in my throat and finally the tears that I had been trying to blink away started to roll down my cheeks. I was mortified at myself that I had been unable to stop them. \"Oh Jane...\" Tom whispered. I now felt his hands gently cup my face and his thumbs gently wipe at the tears on my cheeks, a gentle, caring gesture which caused them to fall a bit faster. \"Dearest Jane...\" He repeated still whispering...this time I felt something very lightly touching the top of my forehead... Then he brought his face level with mine and looked me right in the eye. I now allowed myself to see the love in them. With the feel of Tom's soft touch on my face wiping at my tears, with what I hesitate to interpret as a very light kiss on my forehead, with the obvious look of love in his eyes...I was lost to him once again. My heart was once again stolen by Tom Lefroy. \"I love you\" Tom continued as if he felt he had to make sure that I understood his love for me. \"I believe I have always loved you...from the beginning of time. And shall always love you even after our bones have turned to dust beneath the earth's surface. For eternity Jane, I shall love you.\" Looking into Tom's eyes, I now noticed that Tom's eyes had also become damp with emotion as he said these words to me. Then he started to fumble around in his pockets, searching...for a handkerchief for me...or perhaps for even himself, or for both of us I assumed. Finally, his hands locating what they had been looking for, he produced it front of me...my mind for some reason unable to register what it was...what it wasn't, was a handkerchief. Tom opened a small box, then I gasped. \"Please say you will marry me Jane...and make me the happiest man alive.\" It was a beautiful, elegant, dainty gold ring with a simple, tiny, sparkling diamond in it's center. \"Tom...it's...perfect...\" I was managed to whisper, unbelieving. Perfect was almost an understatement in my mind. It was lovely. Beautiful. Stunning. Exquisite. I didn't know if I deserved such a fine piece of jewelry. \"I actually bought it while I was still in London and after Jane had gone back home...\" I stared at Tom. He had bought this ring last summer? \"As I already told you, I knew after we had our first talk in London that I was going to ask you to marry me. Then after you had spent a couple of weeks at my place there, there was not a doubt in my mind. I would have asked you in London to marry me but I knew that you needed time Jane. I knew that I could not...should not rush you about it. That's in part why I asked you to come to Ireland for Christmas. And in fact, I was going to propose to you on Christmas Day but I found that I could wait no longer. I know today is your birthday...\" He finished off softly. My expression must have looked like one of pure amazement, but I couldn't speak. \"Henry told me...\" Henry told him? I was going to kill Henry! He promised! \"BUT...that was before he told me that you did not want anyone here to know.\" Tom went on quickly. \"After you had told him that you didn't want anyone to know about your birthday, he quickly came to me and made sure that I knew that. And I have kept that promise Jane. But when I found out that today was your birthday and I didn't think I could wait until Christmas Day before I proposed to you, I decided that your birthday would be the perfect time to ask you.\" I guess then I couldn't fault Henry...and Tom hadn't said anything to anyone else... \"Please Jane...\" Tom pleaded with me, still holding the ring up in his fingers. \"Please say you will become my wife...\"[Chapter 21] This past week or so turned out to be busier than I thought it would again, hence it taking a bit longer for me to get this chapter posted! Just so you know, I DO know exactly where I am going with this story but sometimes I don't find the time to get it typed up within a week, but I will continue to try and get at least one chapter up per week. Have patience if it happens to take me a bit longer some weeks than others..it IS coming, lol! ;-D I just want to take this time once again to say thanks to all of you who have and continue to support me and my \"Becoming Jane\" story! And to say \"Welcome\" to those who have just joined it! Your support means a lot to me! THANK YOU! Chapter 20: Jane: I looked at the ring, then I looked at Tom. So many emotions were running through me once again. I wanted to say yes, I really did. I did my best to clear my head because I wanted to think about this before I gave him my answer. In hopes that it would help me in that way, I stood up and moved about the room, Tom looking after me all the while. \"Do you love me Jane?\" Tom now asked. It was a question so unexpected that I came to a sudden stop in my pacing and turned to face him. Did I love him? After months...no...years of telling myself that I was over him, after everything that had happened when we met up in London...after his sweet, loving, caring, gentle gestures tonight, there was no doubt that I did. Still did. I had never stopped loving him... Now he got up and came over to where I was standing. His expression was one of complete seriousness. \"Can you look me straight in the eye and tell me that you don't love me, Jane? That you don't feel anything for me?\" This statement surprised me even more. \"If you can...then...this will be the end of it. I will have to let you go...\" Tom's eyes started to look damp again, this time it would be because of sadness...of that I have no doubt. \"No...no Tom. I cannot look you straight in the eye and tell you I don't love you.\" I admitted. Tom's whole expression changed quite drastically at my words. Almost like the sun breaking out after days of grey skies. \"I do...I do love you. I won't deny it to myself any longer. But...Tom. Before I accept your ring...there are some things we should talk about first.\" \"Of course, by all means. Anything.\" His relief was quite visible on his face and in his voice as he eagerly agreed. \"What is it you wish to talk about?\" \"First off...my writing...\" \"What about it?\" \"If I marry you, I am not going to give up my writing.\" \"I never ever dreamed that you would and I would never make you give it up.\" Tom frowned slightly in puzzlement as he replied to this. \"Of course you are going to continue to write. That room upstairs...that is yours, I gave it to you so that from now on you would have a place in which you could continue to do your writing.\" \"What about Mrs. Radcliffe?\" \"Who?\" \"Mrs. Radcliffe...the authoress you introduced me to 17 years ago. You knew her husband.\" \"What about her?\" I took a deep breath. \"When I visited her, I asked her how people felt about her, a woman being an writer of the kind of stories that she wrote...and...she said that she seemed to be respected and accepted by people but that...that it was her husband who seemed to have lost the respect of some people. That people were having a hard time accepting that a man's wife was making money at writing. That she shouldn't have to write books and make money when she has a husband to provide for her.\" \"I see...and you are worried that the same thing might happen with us? To me? If we marry and you continue to write?\" I nodded my head slightly. \"Yes.\" \"Let me tell you something about the Radcliffe's and their situation, Jane. When they married, neither one came from a well off family. Neither were poor, but neither were really very wealthy either. Mr. Radcliffe wanted to become a lawyer, but it costs money to study law. Money that they could not easily afford. Mrs. Radcliffe had always written, strictly as a hobby. She knew how much her husband wanted to become a lawyer, so she offered to try selling her writing to newspapers in hopes to make some money and save it for his education. Neither really expect very much to come of it, but her stories did get published in the papers and then much to their surprise, she was notified by a publishing company who was interested in publishing her writing into books. Of course they realized that this would mean more money for them and Mr. Radcliffe would be able to get his degree in law. What they didn't foresee once he graduated was that not many people would have much faith in a lawyer who's wife was earning the income in their house. He practices, but he doesn't get the clientele he deserves. He's a good lawyer, as good as they come. But because it was Mrs. Radcliffe who was providing for them at one time, people get the impression that he is not good enough.\" \"But that is so sad! And quite unfair!\" I exclaimed a bit angry at the prejudice of society but also feeling sorry for both Mr. and Mrs. Radcliffe. It should not be this way. He should be able to do be the lawyer he wants to be and make a success of it and she should be able to write for everyone's enjoyment. \"Yes, it is. It is very unfair, but you can't change the way society in general thinks. Anyway Jane, the point is, that is not how it is for you and me. You are already an established writer and I am already an established, successful lawyer. We will not be dependant upon any earnings from your writings. It won't matter that you are a writer, Jane. I promise you.\" \"I believe you. I didn't know the circumstances surrounding the Radcliffe's situation.\" I admitted. \"Of course not. How could you? For obvious reasons, it is never talked about. They continue to keep a very low profile life.\" I nodded my head in understanding. Another thought had come to me while we had been talking about the subject of writing. \"To continue on with this subject then, Tom...as, with your blessing, I am to continue on with my writing if we were to marry, another thing has occurred to me. I would not want to change my name...at least not for anything I publish. As you said so yourself, I have established myself as a writer and as I have only written under my own name of \"Jane Austen\", I think it would be wise to keep my name as such...again for any published writings I may have in future as...your wife.\" I was finding it rather odd to say the words, \"..your wife\" and most especially to Tom. Not that it wasn't pleasant...just...very foreign to me at the moment. But I hope that foreign feeling wouldn't last for too long. \"I wouldn't expect anything else, Jane. I have no objection for you to continue to use \"Jane Austen\" as your pen name at all.\" Tom smiled at me. \"Then Tom...there is the matter of children.\" \"Children?\" Tom asked with a surprised look on his face. \"Yes. Tom...I don't want to have any children. Please, hear me out before you say anything in protest. First off, you already have seven children whom I have become very fond of. I really have become quite attached to them. And even though I realize I can still bear children, at this stage of my life, I do not wish to have any...and for various reasons. I feel that I am getting too old to start having a family for one. For another, my sister Cassandra once pointed out to me how I have a distaste for lying-in. She is right, Tom. It WOULD drive me mad to have to lay about for who knows how many weeks after giving birth. I really would have no patience for it. But lastly and possibly the most important reason...it frightens me Tom. Not the babies or children, I have enough nieces and nephews in my family, but the birthing. I have lost three sister's in laws to it and you have lost a wife. It is very common for women to die in child birth and I would be afraid that after all that of this time, you and I would finally get together, I would end up in the family way almost straight away only to have it end in death for me while giving birth, thus separating us once and for all. It might sound rather funny when I put it this way, but that would be our luck, wouldn't it Tom.\" I almost expected to hear a laugh from Tom...or at least a chuckle when I said that last sentence. But as I heard nothing, I looked at Tom to see him gazing at me with the most serious expression on his face that I think I have ever seen on him. There was not even the slightest hint of amusement on his face nor even in his eyes. \"Of course you are right Jane.\" I heard him agreeing with me softly. \"I don't want to take the chance of losing you now after all of this either.\" I breathed a sigh of relief, then went on to finish off the matter, \"Perhaps it is selfish of me to think in this way, but I would not want to leave you with a newly born baby Tom if the baby were to survive but I also do not like the idea of not getting the chance to see my own child grow up.\" \"I completely understand Jane. You need not explain it to me.\" He assured me. Of course I shouldn't need to, I suddenly thought. Mary had left him with seven children after all... After a moment of silence, Tom spoke up again, \"But Jane...staying on the subject of not having children...please...forgive me...but...I must ask you this...the intimate part of our relationship...\" Tom's voice trailed off here as I felt the heat rush up into my face. His words astonished me to the point that I could not speak. There was nothing I could think of to say to his bold statement. \"Jane...that part of a relationship...\" He started of very gently. \"It doesn't have to be only about...children...and having a family.\" Now I was really having trouble thinking... \"It is also about being in love...and expressing that love you have for one another...in a physical manner...\" He stopped here. Aha! This did make me think of something to say in reply...finally. I drew myself up tall, \"Then by your own definition Mr. Lefroy, you have \"been in love\" with several women and all around the same time, if my memory serves me correctly.\" I was unable to resist this rather wicked reply, referring to that one time just before he and I had met. I was aware enough about his \"loose behaviour\" previous to our introduction to know what kind of man he had been. \"I am not proud of that time in my life Jane.\" He answered quite seriously again, his face very serious...but I thought I could still detect a faint twinkle in his eye. \"I offer you no excuse other than I was a very foolish young man who was rebelling against the pressures of having to be the sole provider of my large family. Something I was not ready for. But you changed me Jane...you changed my ways and my thinking. You made me realize that there was something better for me.\" That reply...I had not expected...I could sympathize with him having to deal with the pressure of having to help provide for his family. I could understand that from his point of view. But that I had been the one who had changed his ways...that was unexpected. I had not realized that. \"And yes...what I had done back then...that was not love. It is not an act of love when you are not in love with the person.\" Tom finished off. \"I will never force you Jane, I love you and respect you too much to do that to you. But I hope in time you will become comfortable with the idea of...the intimate part of love. If you are concerned that a child might be the result of it, let me assure you that it doesn't have to happen...there are ways to prevent it.\" I was truly grateful for Tom's words. As he had proposed to me only moments earlier I hadn't even had the chance to think about it until Tom boldly brought it up. Now I was suddenly aware of how unsure I would feel about the conjugal part of our marriage. I had no experience in that at all. And I think because of that, I would feel more concerned with disappointing Tom in that way. But as he said those words to me, I felt more assured that it would be alright. When the time came. After all, Tom knew that I wouldn't have the experience. He would understand. And...I would never admit this to anyone else except myself of course, but...I was curious...a brief memory of when Cassandra became engaged to Robert came to me at this point...I confess that I had been teasing her mercilessly about this very thing and had practically begged her to tell me all about \"conjugal duties\" when they happened so that when I got married I could decide if would want to undertake them myself...I also won't deny that I was relieved that he knew how to prevent a child coming from it...as well as relieved that he agreed that we did not need to have any (more) children... Quickly, I thought I had better bring myself out of this train of thought. \"What of your practice in London, Tom?\" I now asked out of curiosity, wondering how long he would have to be going back and forth. Would he be spending months at a time after we married, away from home still? Would I be expected to accompany him there or would I stay here? \"After everyone left London and I knew that I was going to propose to you, I looked hard and diligently until I was able to find someone to take over so that I would be able to live here permanently in Ireland again. With you and my family. I'm free to be here all of the time now Jane.\" \"That is wonderful that you were able to find someone so quickly, Tom.\" \"I did look hard though. I never gave up until I found whom I'm sure is the right person.\" He smiled. \"Tom...I do have one more thing I would like to ask...if it's not too personal.\" \"I'll try to answer it.\" \"In London...you were still wearing your wedding ring...\" Tom looked at me, took a deep breath and then replied. \"Yes...\" he started off quietly. \"I did. You see Jane, after Mary died, there was only one other lady for me...and I never thought I would ever see her again. So...I kept my ring on to show everyone that I was 'unavailable'. It was the easiest way to deal with it. My wife was dead and if I couldn't have you, I wanted no one else. I was not...am not interested in anyone else...\" his voice trailed off here momentarily. I felt my eyes get damp again. \"You may have noticed that I no longer wear the ring. I took it off as soon as I came back to Ireland in hopes that another one would replace it.\" There was a few seconds of silence as I didn't know how to respond to his words. \"Do you accept my offer Jane?\" He now asked. There was one last thing I had to say...gathering my composure once again, I straightened my back and said, \"There is just one more thing Mr. Lefroy...if I accept your proposal I want you to understand that I will NOT change for you. I will still be as independent, as stubborn, as spirited and as challenging as I ever was. Maybe even more so.\" NOW was he still willing to marry me? His reaction to my statement would tell me... And...it did. Even more than I had expected it would. For to my genuine amazement, Tom laughed. He didn't chuckle, he laughed out loud at this and before I could ask him what he found so amusing, he said. \"My dearest Jane of all Janes! You had better not change at all for I would not want to marry you if you did change as you would not be the Jane I fell in love with! I not only expect you to NOT change, I wish for you to NEVER change at all! I love you just the way you are Jane, for you and all of your wonderful traits.\" Now I was at a complete loss for words. When I could speak, all I could say in a subdued and rather shaky voice was, \"Then...I accept...\" Looking at me with a most beautiful smile on his face, Tom held up the ring again and this time, without even hardly thinking, I held my left hand out and allowed him to slip it on, feeling the coolness of it against my finger. I gazed down at the most beautiful piece of jewelry I had ever owned, thinking that it couldn't possibly be my hand that was now bearing that ring. I felt Tom gently lifting my chin, making me look into his blue eyes. I could see the happiness not only in his smile, but in his eyes as well. It was hard for me to believe that I was the reason for such happiness. As for myself, it suddenly occurred to me that after all of these years of trying to forget Tom, of forgetting that he existed, that my heart had ever loved him...that I was now free to feel what I HAD felt all of those years ago...and the way I still do. That I was free to love Tom the way I had, the way I wanted to, the way I was capable of. It was almost incomprehensible to me. \"Have you been happy here? With me?\" Tom asked me. I had been...but I could only nod the affirmative. \"Then I promise I will always try to make you happy Jane...I want you to be happy here.\" \"I'm sure I will be happy here with you...and your family Tom...\" I managed to say softly, overcome with emotion as I was. That's when it happened. The first time in 17 years when we had kissed in Wisleys' garden during their ball and after Tom had come back and forced a kiss on me after I had learned that he had become engaged. The first one had been sweet, the second one, not so much as I had been hurt and bewildered by his action...and angry that he dare to do such a thing while he was betrothed to another... But this one had to be the sweetest one of them all that also sent sensations surging through my body like no other touch of Tom's had ever done. It left me quite breathless...And afterwards, as Tom gently put his arms around me I melted into them where we stayed just like that, neither talking, just enjoying each other without words... Tom: As time had gone on and I could tell every day that Jane and my family were getting along splendidly much to my delight of course and seemed to be getting more fond of each as well, she was making it harder for me to keep me waiting on the one important question I had planned on asking her since I had first seen her in London. I had Christmas Day originally picked out in which to ask, but suddenly it seemed too far away. I honestly didn't think I could wait that long. The first afternoon after the Austen's had arrived when Jane had joined in to help Anne avoid being caught against the boys, I was thrilled to see her become involved with the game and my children and so quickly! She seemed to be enjoying the game as much as the children had been. After several minutes of just watching her, I was finally unable to restrain myself from joining in and purposely set out to \"catch\" her. And not because of the game. I knew that I was not following the rules by doing so, but I was unable to resist the temptation. I admit that I had done it partly in fun and to get her attention, but also perhaps because I knew that she would find objection to it. When Jane had started joining in pretty much all of our physical activities and gaining my children's friendship was when I felt that Christmas was just too far away. I had to ask her as soon as possible. Since inviting the Austen's to our place for Christmas, I had pictured Jane by my side greeting guests as they arrived at our Christmas Ball. I realized that Jane would not have wanted to be introduced as \"Jane Austen, Authoress\", so I would have introduced her as \"Jane Austen, a good friend of mine\" or \"...a good friend of the family.\" But when I knew that I could no longer wait until Christmas Day, the idea of being able to introduce her as \"my fianc e\", was another idea that took hold of me and would not let go. Henry, whom I had confided in back in London once again helped me out when I had explained my situation to him. He let me know when Jane's birthday was which settled it. I was going to propose to her on her birthday. Knowing it was her birthday, the idea of at least having a special dinner and desserts that day I didn't think would be out of the question, but then Henry rushed to me one day not long before it and explained how Jane had made him, Eliza and Cassandra PROMISE not to tell ANYONE about her birthday. That she wished to spend it in a nice, quiet, normal manner. She did not want any special treatment or attention whatsoever. Somehow, this did not surprise me about Jane, although I admit I was a bit disappointed that she did not wish to celebrate it with us knowing about it. But, if that was how she wished to spend her birthday, then I would do as she wished. The day would pass as quiet and as normal as it always did. However...I WOULD have something special for her after all that night... I was not at all surprised that Jane should have some objections to our marriage. I realized that she would also have some fears about it, especially considering what had happened 17 years ago. This prompted an emotional speech from myself explaining to Jane EXACTLY how I had been feeling about her since I we had first met in London. It was clear that Jane was also becoming emotional which I took to heart. I had been fully prepared for her objections and questions as well as some of her conditions of our marriage. However I admit that I was still taken aback when she brought up the idea of having children. Of course once she explained her fears to me, I completely understood where she was coming from. There is always a risk of death with childbirth. As Jane had pointed out, she could die with her first lying-in and she was not willing to take that risk. As much as I would love for Jane to bear at least one child of mine, I had to agree with her. It was not a risk I was willing to take either after finding each other again and getting together at last after all of these years. When the time came, I would make sure that we would not have to worry about it... But I also understood that Jane, never being married might feel a bit awkward about that part of our marriage. I was completely honest with her when I had said that I would never force her as I know too well that the common thought of men in regards to the conjugal part of a marriage is that it is a man's right to take his wife whenever he wants to, no matter if their wives want it or not, no matter how they feel. I have come to feel and believe differently about that matter myself. I have learned over the years the difference between taking a woman when she wants it and when she doesn't. I far prefer it when she does. I vowed to myself that I would be kind, gentle, patient and understanding with her when I \"show\" her how sweet and beautiful physical love can be... When Jane finally accepted my proposal and I could finally slip the \"long awaited\" ring on her finger, the feeling I had was one of pure elation. I felt I was in my right then, to do what I had been longing to do at least since I had seen her in London. And that was to kiss her sweetly, gently and lovingly. I thought I knew what to expect I would feel when I kissed her after all of these years, but what I did end up feeling went above and beyond that...it was indescribable. Any words I could think of would not do it justice. And then to have her allow me to hold her like she did afterwards left me unable to speak. But words did not seem necessary as we stayed like that just enjoying being with each other...[Chapter 22] CHAPTER 21: Jane: \"Tom...?\" I was finally the one who broke the silence, but I wanted to know...\"Have you have a date in mind? In which we should get married?\" The whole idea seemed like a dream to me. \"How about right now?\" Came Tom's surprise reply. \"NOW?\" Was my more than astonished reply. \"Why not? Jane if I could find a clergyman who would be willing to make a house call at this hour of night and for a wedding, I would not hesitate.\" Tom told me in a tone of uncertain terms. Then with a bit of a chuckle he said, \"I would wake up the whole household for it in fact! But...\" here he became a bit serious as he went on with a bit of a sigh. \"As that is impossible, I will have to settle for as soon as possible. I really should and would like to speak to my children about this first. And my sisters of course. And I expect that you would probably want your mother to be here for it...\" This time it was me who laughed. \"What?\" Tom asked with puzzled smile on his own face. \"What did I say?\" \"You do not know my mother.\" I started off explaining. \"Yes, of course she would dearly love to be here for the wedding...she would want to see with her own eyes my getting married. Otherwise, she might have a hard time believing it. Yet...on the other hand she would want me to get married as soon as possible before anything should happen to prevent it. As Cassandra, Henry and Eliza are all here to witness it, I am sure that it would be enough to convince her of it's validity.\" \"And how do you feel about it? Would you want to wait until your mother can be notified and give her the chance to get here for it?\" I saw the eagerness in Tom's eyes and realized that the eagerness was in hopes that we would not have to wait for my mother...but I knew he was too kind to express his feelings. He would do what I wanted. \"No, it is not necessary, Tom. I expect that my mother might be a little angry or disappointed at first, but once she realizes that it has happened, she will be grateful.\" \"Perhaps we should visit her after we are married...or have her here for a visit. To make up for it.\" Tom suggested. \"We can consider one or the other of the ideas.\" I agreed vaguely as I didn't know if I liked either one of them but I had to agree with Tom that we should most definitely do one of them to make up to her for it. \"As we won't be getting married tonight, have you another date in mind, Tom?\" I asked returning to the original question. \"How about Christmas Day as that was the day I had intended on proposing to you on...or even Christmas Eve? I would marry you in the next few days but as the Christmas Ball is only a week away, I do not know if it is a good idea to introduce you to my friends and colleagues as my wife when no one else knows of this. And as I said, I would like to speak to my children first and let them get used to the idea.\" Christmas Day? Or...Christmas Eve? I thought to myself. I suppose there wasn't any real reason why it couldn't happen then. I kind of liked the idea of Christmas Eve myself. \"Perhaps Christmas Eve...\" I said out loud thoughtfully and noticed Tom's face brighten at my reply. \"If it's not too much being that it would be the day after the Christmas Ball...\" \"Then Christmas Eve it shall be.\" Tom beamed. \"We can make it work.\" \"Tom, I do not wish for a big, fancy wedding. Just something small, simple and quick is good with just Cassandra, Henry, Eliza and your family as guests would be enough.\" \"You and I think very similarly Jane, for I have no wish to have a big, fancy wedding either. We could even have it right here in the house. I know of some of the clergyman in Limerick who might be free for Christmas Eve. I will ask them tomorrow.\" \"And I should write to my mother straight away as she should know as soon as possible.\" \"You write your letter to your mother Jane and I will take it to Limerick tomorrow and have it sent out to her the quickest way possible.\" \"Thank you Tom.\" We both fell silent for only a few minutes longer when I thought perhaps we should be getting up to our own beds now. Tom agreed and taking a candelabra, he put out the rest of the candles in the room while I waited for him. I took his arm and we both ascended the stairs silently together. At my door, Tom stole a quick goodnight kiss from me before heading off to his own room...a room that in a week's time, I would start sharing with him... I quickly put that thought out of my mind and as quietly as I could, slipped into mine and Cassandra's room and still as quietly, made myself ready for bed and crawled in. I was not surprised that sleep would not come easily for me with all that had transpired between Tom and myself after everyone else had gone to bed. My fingers from my right hand softly caressed the ring that now adorned the fourth finger on my left hand. \"You've finally made it to bed, Jane.\" Cassandra's soft sleepy voice coming out of nowhere startled me. \"What is it he wished to talk to you about that took so long?\" I was in a quandary...on the one hand I wanted to tell Cassandra straight away about it, but on the other...I wanted to keep it to myself just a little bit longer...and if I told her now, we might both be up all hours of the night talking...yet...if I didn't, she might be upset that I didn't tell her as soon as I got into bed... \"I promise I will tell you first thing in the morning Cass as we are both very tired right now and should get some sleep.\" I finally decided to reply, telling myself that I would explain why I didn't tell her straight off in the morning. My sister is quite sensible after all and I am sure that she will understand. I heard my sister yawn and agreed before turning over and falling back to asleep. I knew it would still be awhile before I would be able to do the same... The next morning, I found that I must have fallen asleep at some point, but I haven't any idea as to when that would have been. I found I was still quite tired, but I felt I should get up when my sister did which was almost at the same time that I did. In trying to wake myself up further, I stretched my arms out from under the blankets and then brought my hands to my face and rubbed my still sleepy eyes. \"Jane!\" I heard Cassandra exclaim as I did so. \"What is it?\" I asked, quickly sitting up, startled, to see Cassandra's eyes wide with...surprise? Shock? \"What is it Cassandra? What? Oh do tell me, you are giving me such a fright!\" Instead of talking, she just pointed to me...I looked her questioningly and then looked at myself. What was she pointing at? As I moved my hands, I realized that she was moving her eyes and finger along with them. I looked down at my hands. The ring. I quickly covered it and looked up at Cassandra who looked at me in the same instant. \"So that's what took you so long! Jane! Is it really true? Are you and Tom...engaged then?\" I nodded my head, while she said, \"You must tell me all about it at once then!\" she encouraged me, which I did. Truth to be told, I was glad to be able to share it with my sister now. She also seemed to understand why I hadn't brought it up to her last night. When I was done recalling it for her, she threw her arms around me and said, \"I am so happy for you Jane! And I am very happy that you accepted his proposal. I really am as it is right this time.\" \"We must tell mama straight away of course.\" I said a matter of factly. \"Tom said that he would take the letter into Limerick with him today and have it sent out in the quickest way possible.\" \"Jane...perhaps I should write the letter to mama...\" I looked at her questioningly. \"But why, Cass?\" \"You know what mama is like Jane, she might believe it more if it came from myself.\" I looked at my sister...she did have a point. It is not that my mother doesn't trust me, but if I were to tell her, she would demand to hear it from Cassandra...and possibly Henry and Eliza as well before she believed it. However if Cassandra were to write the letter, mama might be more inclined to believe it straight off. \"Alright, you may write the letter Cassandra as you are no doubt right about our mother. But it must be ready as soon as possible so that Tom can take it into Limerick with him. I do not know when he wishes to leave, but we should have it ready soon so we do not keep him waiting on it.\" \"We should keep it brief then.\" Cassandra said decidedly. \"And you may help me write it if you wish to Jane.\" \"I am sure that you will do a fine job Cassandra. If we are to keep it brief, there really isn't very many ways in which we can say that I am engaged to Mr. Lefroy...\" I let my voice trail off here before Cassandra and I looked at each other and laughed, then embraced each other once again. We decided to make ourselves ready for the day, but it was after we were ready that we realized that there was nothing to write our letter with or on in our bedchamber. We would have to use my 'writing room' in order to write the letter so we stepped out of our room and were already walking down the hall towards it when Henry and Eliza also emerged from there room. \"And where are you heading off to my sisters?\" Henry inquired, it was obvious that we were not heading downstairs. We stopped and turned around. Henry and Eliza didn't know of the news yet. I felt cornered. It's not that I didn't wish to tell my brother and sister-in-law cousin about the news, I just didn't know if I wanted to tell them right at that moment. And then..there were the children. Their rooms were right there. Tom had wanted to talk to them about it first and because of that, I didn't want them to overhear anything. Not knowing what else I could do, I beckoned Henry and Eliza to follow us into the writing room and closed the door behind us. Before I could say anything, Henry spoke up. \"So Tom has proposed to you at last, Jane!\" I looked at my brother who was grinning, wide-eyed in my shock. HOW could he possibly know? \"You wear a ring on your finger.\" He went on still grinning. Oh...the ring. Yet, I was still surprised at how quickly he had noticed. \"Tom told me in London how he was planning on proposing to you on Christmas Day here in Ireland after we accepted his invitation to spend the holiday here, Jane.\" He now further explained. Henry KNEW? \"But he made me promise not to say a word to anyone. He wanted to consult with me...ask me if I was okay with it and if he thought that everyone in the family would approve. Of course I gave him my blessings. Jane...this was \"the truth\" I told our mother. The truth that I said you would know soon enough about...about WHY our mother allowed us to come here for Christmas. It was the only thing I could think of to get mama to agree to letting us come here at this time of year. I had to tell her of Tom's intentions...that he was going to propose to you. I had to make her promise not to tell you or anyone else either as you did not yet of course and I had promised Tom. Of course she also approves of Tom's proposal.\" Our mother also KNEW? My thoughts drifted back to the day we had arrived in Chawton from London. Now mama's actions after talking with Henry made sense to me. Her smile and her readiness to allow us to spend Christmas in Ireland. Of course I wasn't angry with Tom for talking to Henry either. He had done this in order to get the approval of my family first. He had wanted to go about his proposal in an honest, more honourable way than the last time. He could not be and should not be faulted for that. After our talk the night before, Tom must not have known that Henry had told our mother of his intention. Indeed, why should Henry have told him when he had promised not to tell anyone? Tom needn't know that mama was against our coming here until Henry had spoken to her. When I could find my voice again, I said, \"Henry...Cassandra, Eliza...please promise me...you are NOT to say a word about this when anyone else in the house is present. Tom wishes to speak to his children first about it, so please do not say anything about it in their presence until we know he has spoken to them about it. He also would like to speak to his sisters as well of course. As of this moment, I do not know when he will address any of them although I would think as soon as possible.\" \"Have you set a date then?\" Eliza wanted to know. \"Tom wants to get married as soon as we possibly can. He suggested Christmas Day...or Christmas Eve. I think we will marry here on Christmas Eve with only our families who are here in attendance. Neither of us wish for a big, fancy wedding. We agreed on a quick, quiet, simple ceremony.\" \"I don't know that our mother will approve of you not marrying in a church, Jane.\" Cassandra said with a bit of warning in her voice. \"After all papa was a clergyman...\" \"Yes, I expect that you are right about that Cass..but need we tell her of ALL of the details? She only needs to know that we are married and that it was small, quick, quiet and simple. She needn't know WHERE..does she?\" \"What if she asks?\" my sister persisted. \"Then we tell her the truth of course. But by then, she may not care, Cassandra. And if she does, there really isn't anything we..or she can do about it. We ARE going to be married by a clergyman, so will it really matter that we do not have it in a church? It may be hard to find a church not in use during Christmas.\" I pointed out in return. That seemed to settle the matter as there were no more questions on the subject. \"As there doesn't seem to be anything more to talk about on this matter, perhaps we should write the note to our mother to let her know that it is all settled then. Henry and Eliza you may go down to breakfast and please let Tom know that Cassandra and I are just writing up a quick note to let our mother know of the wedding plans.\" I suggested. But before they left the room, Eliza approached me and then embraced me. \"I think it is absolutely splendid how the two of you have found each other again.\" She told me. \"It is no secret that at one time, we all disapproved of Tom. But he has proven himself to be worthy of you Jane.\" Eliza assured me. \"Indeed he has.\" Henry echoed his wife. I smiled at them all, happy with the knowledge that this time, our union was meeting with approval. Tom: It was true...I wanted for Jane and myself to get married as quickly as possibly and if I could have, I would have married Jane right then and there, right on the spot. I felt that we had had to wait long enough and I was not willing to wait any longer. But of course it was impossible to get married right then and there...and I really did want to talk to my children first even though by this point, I was sure that my marriage to Jane would be met by approval. But it was important to me that I tell them of it first. And I did also need to inform my sisters as well. There could be no doubt that Sarah would be thrilled. I did not doubt that Phoebe would also approve, but she would be more \"quiet\" about it than Sarah would be of course. Now the date was set for Christmas Eve and I could not be happier, I was sure. I was looking quite forward to being able to talk to my children and sisters about our forthcoming union. And finally...I would be able to speak more openly and freely of my love and affection for Jane. I would no longer have to hide it from anyone...especially from her. Because of this, I was not able to resist stealing a goodnight kiss from her when I left her at her bedroom door... The next morning I happen to wake up early enough so I decided that I should speak with my children before breakfast. It worked out well as this was something I did not wish to delay. I made myself ready as quickly as possible and went down the hall to their rooms and knocked first before entering. As I was a bit earlier than I had been on other mornings, I noticed that they were not quite ready yet. \"Father!\" cried Anne who was the first to see me. \"You have come before breakfast again! But we are not ready yet.\" \"It is alright Anne.\" I chuckled as I reassured her. \"I have come a little early because there is something important that I need to tell you...all of you...your aunts included.\" \"Do you wish to speak to us now, or should we finish getting ready first?\" Jane had also made an appearance. \"You may get finish getting ready first.\" I replied as I took a seat in one of the chairs. \"I will wait for you.\" \"Is it something we did Father?\" George asked somberly. \"No.\" I assured him with a smile. \"You did nothing wrong.\" \"Is it a surprise Father?\" Anne asked a little hopefully. My lips twitched slightly as I tried to hide a smile at Anne's eagerness. I hesitated before I answered this question. \"Well...I guess it could be..\" \"For us?\" Anne carried on. \"For all of us. But that is enough questions from all of you. Make yourselves ready first please and be quick about it!\" I addressed my children as a whole, gently but firmly. \"Tom, is everything really alright?\" Phoebe now came over to me full of concern. \"Yes, everything is quite alright. And will be even better shortly.\" Phoebe threw me a puzzled look before heading off to see if any of the children needed her further assistance. I couldn't keep the smile off of my lips this time. Once any of them were ready, they would come over and join me while we waited for the rest and very shortly, all of my offspring and my sisters were ready...and awaiting for me to begin. Taking a deep breath, I started, \"I have been watching all of you these past couple of weeks. And unless I am completely mistaken in my thinking, I do believe that you have become rather fond of our guests...Miss Jane in particular.\" There was a general nod of heads in answer to this much to my relief of course. \"I am very happy to know that as Miss Jane has told me herself that she has become fond of all of you as well.\" \"What are you getting at Tom?\" My sister Sarah now asked, very curious. As there was no other way to put it, I decided to jump right in. \"As you know, Miss Jane and myself have known each other for quite some time now. And since meeting up with her again, I have also found that I too have become quite fond of her myself and...last night I asked her to marry me...and she accepted. I want you to know straight off children that I loved your mother...and Miss Jane will not replace your mother. No one can nor will ever replace your mother, but I would like very much for her to be a part of our family and I also hope that you would like it if she were to become a part of our family too.\" There was silence for a few seconds which were to be expected. Then, \"Oh father, is it true? Miss Jane will be living here with us? Always?\" Of course it was my own daughter Jane who had spoken up first. \"Yes, it is quite true, Jane. How do the rest of you feel about Miss Jane becoming a part of this family?\" Now that someone had spoken up, the rest of my brood started to voice their opinions as well and I was very pleased to see that the general feeling was that they approved of it. Jane came over to me and happily embraced me. \"This IS wonderful news Tom!\" exclaimed Sarah whose face was lit up with pleasure, then she too came over and hugged me. Both hers and of course Jane's reactions did not come as a surprise to me at all. I was unsure how the rest would react, but I was delighted to see that my children seemed to be happy with it. Not one of them objected to it. \"Have you set a date yet?\" Sarah now asked. \"Christmas Eve.\" I replied. \"So soon?\" This was from Phoebe who seemed almost..shocked. \"I want to us to be married as soon as possible. I didn't see any reason to wait.\" I replied firmly. \"And neither did Jane.\" \"I think getting married on Christmas Eve is the perfect Christmas gift.\" Jane sighed. \"I think so too.\" Sarah agreed. \"I wouldn't want anything else for Christmas.\" Jane said softly. Her statement touched my heart. I looked at my oldest daughter lovingly and said gently. \"You mean that don't you, love.\" Jane nodded her head which made my eyes a little misty as I smiled at her. Bringing myself back to everyone else, I decided to fill them in a little more with the details. \"We are not going to have a big ceremony. Just a nice, small, quiet, simple ceremony right here in the house with only our families present. And that is all.\" \"Will Santa Claus be there too?\" Mary wanted to know now. I couldn't help but laugh. \"Santa Claus is going to be a very busy man that night don't forget Mary, but he is also a very wise man. He seems to know a lot. I'm sure he will know about it even if he can't be there. Listen children, I don't wish to hold up breakfast and our guests any longer, so why don't we make our way down to the dining room. But please...remember your manners...you are not to bring this subject up at the table.\" I said in my warning voice. There was a murmur of agreement and I made myself ready to leave with my family when I heard, \"Sarah...please take the children downstairs. I wish to speak with Tom alone for a few minutes.\" Phoebe said. I looked at her in surprise wondering what she would want to talk to me about. Sarah and I shared a puzzled look and then I nodded my head slightly towards her telling her that she could go ahead, which she did. But before she did, she said rather pointedly. \"I really am very happy for you Tom...you and Jane. It is really wonderful.\" I noticed that she quickly looked at Phoebe when she was done, then back to me again with an encouraging smile, then left the room with the younger Lefroy's, shutting the door behind them. I turned to my older sister, still puzzled. \"Miss Jane is...a very lovely person, Tom.\" Phoebe started off. \"I'm glad you approve..\" I replied still baffled. \"But...what about poor Mary?\" Was her next surprising statement. Mary? My poor, dear wife has been in the ground for two years! \"My wife has been dead for two years now Phoebe...\" I reminded my sister in a gentle voice. \"But don't you think this is all a bit sudden, Tom?\" Sudden? Jane and I had known each other longer than I had known Mary! \"Tom...as the oldest member of our family...I do not know if I can approve of this union between you and Miss...Jane.\" Now I was furious. \"Phoebe...\" I said in a low voice, keeping as calm as I possibly could. \"You may be the oldest, but I am the oldest male. And I am not a child. I have been married once already and have my own family. I am quite capable of making my own decisions.\" \"But Mary...\" \"Who is dead Phoebe, and I am not.\" I stated a little more loudly in my passion. I heard Phoebe gasped at my words. Suddenly, I started to understand. Even though Phoebe had not agreed with Mary's and my ways of child rearing, she had always liked Mary...she had also liked that by marrying Mary, I had married well. And there was something else too...Phoebe had not known about mine and Jane's early relationship. \"Phoebe...there is something you need to know...\" I started off more calmly once again. \"First, I loved Mary. I really did. She gave me seven beautiful children whom I love deeply and would never wish back. But...I have known Jane for longer than I had known Mary...and...what you don't know is that...Jane and I had been in love ourselves. Again, before I had even met Mary. And we were going to be married...\" Once again, Phoebe gasped at my words. I quickly explained everything to her about how Jane and I had met and what had happened between us... \"So you see Phoebe...it was my idea to run away together and get married. But once Jane understood that by doing so, it would ruin me and my reputation...and that I would no longer be able to support you...my family...it was she who left me. She could not go through with it. She refused to let that happen.\" There was silence while Phoebe took in all that I had just disclosed to her. When a few minutes had passed, I went on. \"I do love Jane, Phoebe. Mary has been gone for two years now and Jane and I have found each other again. I am happy with her. The children adore her. She has brought back happiness to this house. Not only for myself, but for the children as well. Do you really want to take that away from all of us?\" For the first time since I started in on my explanation of everything, Phoebe acknowledged what I was saying by shaking her head slowly and they by saying, \"No...of course not.\" \"I can provide for all of us now in a way that I could not when we first met. I really want this Phoebe...I want to marry Jane. And...I am going to. With or without your blessing...but I would rather have it.\" \"I am sorry Tom...I do apologize. I didn't know about you and Jane. I did think you were rushing into things a bit too quickly with her. It was truly...very admirable of her to leave you so that your reputation would be spared and you could continue to provide for us. But why Tom...why did you not tell us of your courtship with Miss Austen?\" \"Because...it had ended painfully...for both of us.\" I told Phoebe in a quiet voice that was full of emotion. \"And I did not wish to bring up a painful past...something that at the time, I thought was in the past and would never, could never again come to light.\" \"I am...so sorry Tom. I can tell by the look on your face and the sound of your voice how painful that time was for you. And that also tells me how much in love you were with Jane at one time...and that you seem to have found that love again.\" I smiled at Phoebe. \"I have Phoebe. I really have. I have...been so happy since being with Jane again. I also want you to know that nothing is really going to change. You and Sarah will still be in charge of the children's daily studies. The only thing that will be different is Jane will be living here permanently and as my wife. But I want everything else to go on as it has since you came here to help me with my family. Or...since Jane arrived anyway as I expect that she will still partake in some of the physical activities with the children as she seems to enjoy doing so with them.\" Phoebe did something unexpected then. She put her arms around me and hugged me. I slowly drew my own arms around my sister and returned the gesture. \"You have my blessing...\" She promised me in a whisper. \"Thank you...\" I whispered back.[Chapter 23] Chapter 22: Jane: Cassandra quickly and efficiently wrote up a lovely and convincing letter to our mother confirming my engagement to Mr. Lefroy. As she did so, I came to realize that it was right that she be the one to write it as I know I could not have done one any better myself. She signed and then sealed it in an envelope that she was now addressing, then handed it to me to give to Tom before we left the room to join the rest. I hoped we hadn't kept them waiting too long for us. As it turned out, everyone else had all converged at the bottom of the staircase. Tom looked up at us as we descended, smiling. He then quickly turned to Anna, Phoebe and Sarah and said something to them. They nodded their heads and lead the children away towards the dining room. Not long after we reached the bottom of the stairs, Phoebe and Sarah were already on their way back. \"I have spoken to my sisters and my children about our engagement.\" Tom told us. \"And Henry and Eliza have already told us that they know about it as well.\" \"Jane, I am so very happy for you both!\" Sarah exclaimed as she came over and embraced me. \"Thank you, Sarah.\" I smiled at my soon to be sister in law. \"And as the eldest of the family in Tom's household, it is both a pleasure and an honour to welcome you to the Lefroy family.\" Phoebe now also added as she too stepped forward. \"Thank you Phoebe.\" In the weeks since our arrival, Phoebe and myself and Cassandra had all taken to referring to each other by our first names. \"I really appreciate it.\" My gratitude was genuine. I now remembered the letter in my hand and gave it over to Tom who put it in a pocket inside his suit jacket. We all now made our way toward the dining room where this time as Tom's fianc e, I was on his arm and it was both of us who lead the way. After enjoying a pleasant breakfast, Tom left for Limerick promising me with a goodbye kiss that he would get my letter sent out to mama in the quickest possible way. He also promised to be back as soon as he possibly could. I was glad that during Tom's absence our time was spent in the usual way as I still felt like my engagement to Tom was not real. I had to keep glancing at my hand that now bore the engagement ring to assure myself that it was indeed true. \"It's a lovely ring...\" Cassandra told me with a smile when she caught me looking at it one of those times. I blushed at her words but couldn't keep the smile off of my face. \"Jane..what will you do for a wedding dress?\" Cassandra now asked. \"It is a good thing I thought to bring both of my ball gowns. I shall wear one for the ball and one for the wedding.\" I replied thoughtfully. \"Are you sure that is a good idea?\" \"Why not Cass? For one thing, I am getting married in my older years. I am not the \"young blushing bride\". And after all Tom is marrying me, not the dress.\" \"I expect you are right. There is no real need to wear a traditional white gown for the wedding.\" \"And that'll be one less thing to worry about. Especially as it's only a week away.\" I returned, smiling. The reality of our engagement did slowly start to sink in over the next few days but with that reality came another...my sister. By marrying Tom and living with him and his family in Ireland, that meant that Cassandra and myself would be separated. I did not relish that idea at all and one day I let her know. \"I do not wish for you to leave me Cass.\" I told her sadly. \"When Tom and myself marry...\" \"I do not wish for it either Jane.\" Cassandra was just as somber as I was. \"Then...stay!\" I exclaimed with sudden inspiration. \"You know I can't Jane. What about our mother? You know she can't stay with James's family for the rest of her life. It would not be fair to either of them.\" I knew she was right about that. I felt defeated but only momentarily as another idea took a hold of me. \"Henry and Eliza!\" \"What?\" Cassandra asked with a slight frown puckering her forehead. \"Henry and Eliza are going back to England at the beginning of the New Year. They have no family, they can take mama in!\" \"Don't you think that you should ask them first before you presume it of them Jane?\" Cassandra cautioned me. \"Of course I'll ask them. I am sure they will not object.\" \"Hmmm...\" Was all that Cassandra would say. But if I knew my brother, I would be able to convince him. \"It will be splendid Cass, having you live here with us.\" I gushed happily. \"You had better be asking Tom first as well while you are asking Henry and Eliza.\" Cassandra still seemed doubtful. \"Of course, of course.\" I waved it away. I was more than positive that Tom would not object to Cassandra living here with us. And fully confident of that, I would ask him first and then I would talk to Henry and Eliza, telling them that Tom had agreed. I was already working out in my mind what I would say to Henry... At the first opportunity I had, I confronted Tom about it. I found him in his office. \"Tom...?\" I announced myself quietly as I knocked softly on his door and entered the room. He looked up from his work and smiled when he saw me. \"Yes, Jane?\" I suddenly felt guilty for taking him from his work. \"I am sorry to bother you, I promise this will only take a moment of your time.\" \"It is quite alright Jane. What is it you wish?\" \"As you know...Henry, Eliza and...\" I paused here slightly before going on. \"...my sister will be leaving us at the beginning of the new year.\" \"Yes...?\" I licked my lips before proceeding. \"It's just that...\" A pause. \"...well...\" Another pause. \"...it's just that...\" Suddenly Tom's hand went up in a gesture to stop me from continuing. \"Please Tom...\" I wanted to be able to go on. But he stood up and came over to me. Taking my hands into his and looking me straight in the eye, he said, \"You wish for your sister to stay...\" he stated gently. I looked at him in amazement, unable to think of anything to say in reply. \"I know that you are your sister are very close, Jane. I also realize that once they leave here you will no family living near you. Of course Cassandra must stay here. I wouldn't have it any other way for you.\" I must have been holding my breath a bit while Tom was speaking for I found myself breathing again. And with that, came my ability to speak. \"Oh thank you, Tom! Thank you!\" Tom now brought my hands up to his lips, where he gently kissed them, still looking at me all the while. \"Of course Jane. I would do anything to ensure your happiness here with me...with us.\" \"Oh Tom...\" I fairly melted at his touch and his words. \"I'm sure I would be happy here with you...it's just...\" \"I have my family here and you have none of yours. It is only fair of course and we've plenty of room for your sister.\" Tom now gently caressed my cheek...I closed my eyes at his touch... \"Oh! Excuse me!\" Sarah's voice startled both of us as we broke apart quickly and looked at her. She looked as embarrassed as I felt. \"I did not mean to intrude. Forgive me.\" She bowed and turned to leave the room. \"You must wish to speak to Tom.\" I now told her kindly. \"Do not leave Sarah, I will go now.\" \"I am sorry...\" she apologized again. \"Do not concern yourself about it any longer, Sarah.\" I reassured her with a smile as I approached her on my way out. \"Thank you, Jane.\" Her reply was heart-felt. \"Of course.\" I walked passed her, turned and bowed slightly before quitting the room. \"What is it you wish to speak to me about Sarah?\" I heard Tom ask as I was closing the door. \"A letter has come for you from my Aunt Anne Lefroy.\" I meant to leave but as I knew Anne, her being mentioned intrigued me and I couldn't help but wonder if everything was alright with the George Lefroy's. Naturally, I was concerned for them. I heard the sound of an envelope being torn open. I knew I should leave as I'm sure that Tom would let me know if there was anything I should know about but...I couldn't seem to tear myself away either. Finally after several minutes of silence, I heard something I had not expected...at all. Tom...speaking in a most angry voice. \"This is an outrage!\" he exclaimed furiously. \"Tom! What is it?\" The concern in Sarah's voice was obvious. \"Apparently...my Aunt Anne has found out about my engagement to Jane and forbids it!\" At these words, I felt like I had been suddenly thrown back in time to 17 1/2 years ago to when I was standing outside of Tom's great-uncle's dining room, listening to him hurl his abuse at both of us. \"What?\" Came Sarah's shocked voice in a low tone. But I was too numb with my own shock that I just barely heard her...and I didn't hear anything else that was said after that even though I was too dumbfounded to even move. I was even too stunned to feel...but that was the first sense to return to me and all I could feel was pain...a pain that stabbed my heart and tore it's way throughout my body. Without even knowing or understanding how, I flew from my position outside of Tom's office door and blindly ran towards the staircase, tears starting to sting the corners of my eyes. I vaguely heard someone-Cassandra, I think-calling my name but I didn't stop. I continued up the stairs and until I reached our room where as soon as I was inside, I went over to the wardrobe, threw open the doors, dug out both Cassandra's and my bags and threw them on the bed. I next started grabbing our clothes out of the wardrobe and throwing them on the bed as well...and none to gently. \"Jane? Jane!\" Cassandra had now entered the room. \"Jane what is it? What has happened that has gotten you so upset?\" I didn't stop my activity as I answered my sister. \"We're leaving Cassandra and as soon as possible. Henry and Eliza can come with us if they wish to and are able to get themselves ready, but you and I are leaving as soon as we can.\" \"Whatever are you talking about, Jane? You and Tom...oh do STOP this Jane and talk to me! Please dearest! Tell me what happened?\" Cassandra begged me. I felt her grab my arms to prevent me from continuing on with \"packing\" our belongings. \"Stop it, Jane! Talk to me! Please!\" Cassandra now placed her hands on my face forcing me to look at her and sat us both down on the bed. \"Talk to me Jane...please.\" She repeated more gently this time. I had to gulp before speaking. \"Sarah brought a letter to Tom and I overheard him. His uncle has forbade our union.\" I whispered in a confused state. \"Again.\" I noticed Cassandra's baffled expression. \"What?\" she exclaimed. \"Tom's uncle has forbade our union...just as he did before.\" I repeated. \"I...I think you are confused dearest...Tom's uncle is dead...\" She reminded me gently. I closed my eyes and shook my head slightly in hopes to clear my mind. \"No...\" I suddenly said slowly as realization dawned on me.\" \"Not his uncle...his aunt.\" \"His aunt?\" Cassandra questioned, still puzzled. \"Yes...his aunt...Anne...Anne Lefroy...\" I finished dully. I heard Cassandra gasp at the information I had just revealed. \"Anne Lefroy!\" She exclaimed in a low, shocked tone. We lapsed into silence for a few minutes before Cassandra spoke up again. \"But how would she know of your engagement already?\" she wondered. I had wondered about that as well but only briefly. \"Our mother Cass...remember...Henry admitted that he had told her in order to give us permission to come here over Christmas. I can very well imagine our mother not being able to wait to 'share the news' with Anne Lefroy after putting up with Anne practically flaunting Tom's marriage to Mary and their family...not to mention his success in our faces for all of those years.\" I could see by the look in my sister's eyes and face that she agreed with me in this. \"It's over Cass...again.\" With these words, I couldn't stop the tears that had been threatening to fall. But I was glad that I was with my sister. I didn't mind crying on her shoulder. She had always been a great comfort to me. \"I am so sorry dearest Jane...but I am not entirely convinced that Tom believes it's over.\" \"It IS!\" I exclaimed furiously. And with that, I jumped up and continued on with our 'packing up'. \"Jane...\" Cassandra also stood up. 'You need to talk with Tom...\" \"NO!\" I replied stubbornly. \"I should have known that this was going to happen again. It just wasn't meant to be for Tom and myself.\" \"Jane...\" Cassandra started. \"No...\" I cut her off again. \"I know you mean well Cass but please don't. Just do me a favour and tell Henry and Eliza about what has happened and of our plans to leave as immediately as possible. They can stay if they wish or they can come with us, if they want to and are able to get ready quick enough.\" My sister looked at me with what I interpreted as pity, embraced me and then left the room. It was after she left that I sat down on the bed and finally allowed myself a good cry...the one that had been building up inside of myself since hearing the news outside of Tom's office door... I don't know how long it was before I heard Henry's knock on the door but I dried my eyes and blew my nose before allowing him to enter. I didn't want him to see just how upset I was. I know how concerned he was for me the last time this had happened and I didn't want to worry him again. Standing up straight and tall and feeling a bit more calm and composed, I said, \"Come in.\" When the door opened, I took a surprised step backward as the person who entered was not Henry...nor Eliza...nor even Cassandra. It was Tom.[Chapter 24] CHAPTER 23: Tom: When Jane had come to talk to me about wanting her sister to live here, I had already decided in my own mind that I would tell her that her sister would be welcome to stay on with us after we had married if they wished and if they were able to make arrangements for their mother's living accommodations. Because Jane had started off by stating how her family would be leaving her at the start of the new year, I had assumed correctly that she had wished to ask that of me. I would do whatever I could to make sure that Jane was happy here. I have no doubt that our love would be enough, but sometimes things outside of love and marriage are needed just as much and I know how important Cassandra is to Jane. I regretted that Sarah happened to enter the room just at the moment that she had, but I told myself that Jane and myself would have plenty of time for such moments. Jane seemed to think so as well as she kindly assured my sister about her intrusion. \"What is it you wish to speak to me about Sarah?\" \"A letter has come for you from my Aunt Anne Lefroy.\" She said as she handed me an envelope. Puzzled as to what my Aunt Anne would be writing me about as I rarely hear from them personally, I took the envelope, opened it, took out the letter and read it...what I read infuriated me! \"This is an outrage!\" I exploded. \"Tom! What is it?\" Sarah sounded frightened. \"Apparently...my Aunt Anne has found out about my engagement to Jane and forbids it!\" I was furious! \"What?\" Sarah exclaimed in her shock. I was so blinded with rage at my aunt's letter that I immediately crumpled it into a ball and threw it forcefully into the fireplace where it caught on fire almost instantly. \"I'm sorry Tom...\" Sarah tried to console me. \"Who does she think she is? What does she think gives her the right to interfere in MY life and tell me what I can and can't do with it!\" I continued to rant. Sarah came over to me and embraced me which did help to calm me down somewhat. Anyway, it didn't matter. Anne Lefroy could \"talk\" all she wanted, but she had NO hold over me and my life and what I chose to do with it whatsoever. \"What I can't figure out is...\" I said to Sarah in a composed voice. \"...how Anne found out about our engagement. Surely the letter hasn't reached Jane's mother yet...had it? Or...if it had, it would have only just reached there...and being that she is staying at James's place, she wouldn't have gone out of her way to visit Anne and George to tell them of the news...would she have?\" I pondered all of this. \"I do not know Tom. That is a wonder.\" Was Sarah's reply. \"Are you going to tell Jane?\" She now asked me. I shook my head. \"There is no need to upset her with it. Our aunt can talk all she wants to but this wedding and marriage IS going ahead as planned whether she likes it or not. There is nothing she can do to prevent it.\" I smiled down at Sarah who returned it. \"I'm glad.\" she said. At that moment, Cassandra knocked and entered the room, out of breath. \"Forgive me Tom...Sarah...\" She bowed quickly and we returned it. But instantly, I was alerted to her behaviour. Something had happened... \"What is it?\" I went over to her. \"It is Jane? Has something happened to Jane?\" \"Yes...I'm afraid so Tom.\" I felt my heart drop at her words. \"What happened? Tell me quickly!\" \"Jane overheard you talking about the letter you received from your Aunt Anne Lefroy. She is very upset. She believes your relationship is over Tom and is in fact packing right now to leave Ireland as soon as possible.\" \"WHAT?\" I gasped in shock. \"No! She can't!\" I could not and would not let this happen. I fairly flew out of my office, towards the stairs which I ascended quickly taking two of them at a time and didn't stop until I had reached Jane and Cassandra's room. The door was shut and as much as I didn't want to waste time in knocking, I did so out of respect. I thought she was taking too long in allowing me to enter and I was just about to do so uninvited, but just as my hand was on the handle to turn it, I heard her say come in. She obviously had not been expecting me, as she looked very surprised at seeing me and took a step backward. Then, very quickly, she turned her back on me and continued to do what Cassandra had said she was doing...packing up their clothes. \"Jane...\" I said gently, stepping into the room. No reply from Jane and she didn't stop her packing. \"Jane...\" I spoke a little more loudly this time as I continued to advance towards her. Still no change. \"Jane, stop it. Stop this right now.\" I was nearly upon her as I spoke these words, but she kept on, as if she couldn't hear me at all. Quickly, I wrapped my arms around her waist pinning her arms to her sides in order to stop her. \"Stop...stop Jane. Please...stop now.\" I spoke gently but firmly into her hair. \"Let me go Tom...\" She spoke in a surprisingly harsh but low voice. I realized that the harshness wasn't meant for me personally though. 'No. No Jane. I will not let you go. After you did your reading after the recital in London, I vowed that I would not let you go this time and I meant it.\" I felt her body relax somewhat in my arms. I loosened my grip on her but not much. However I needn't have worried for she did not even try to escape from my hold of her. Instead she said in a whisper. \"It's no use Tom...it is as I have feared. Your family does not approve of you marrying me...we may as well face it...it was never meant to be...you and me.\" I turned Jane around so that she faced me. I lifted her chin with my fingers so that she would have to look at me. I saw the way they shone with unshed tears. But I also noticed that they were a bit red...obviously from an earlier weeping. My heart ached for her. Gently placing my hands on either side of her face, I spoke softly but firmly. \"I know you heard what my Aunt Anne wrote Jane but she has no right to tell me how to run my life. She has no hold over me whatsoever like my uncle did before. She can say all she wants to, but it won't and doesn't change a thing, Jane.\" I could see that she was struggling with a battle within herself. \"I promise you that Jane. NOTHING has changed. Our marriage WILL happen.\" I silently pleaded with her to believe my words. \"I...I thought...\" Jane gulped. \"I thought she was my friend!\" she finally managed to get out. I looked at her with a puzzled expression. \"I've been thinking about things while packing Tom...and some things started to fall into place.\" \"Like what?\" \"Like how she never mentioned to my family that Mary had died...that you had a law practice in London...and...Tom! Henry, Eliza and myself have been to London several times over the years regarding my books! Your Aunt Anne knew about our London trips but never told us about you being there!\" I took in what Jane was trying to tell me. \"Don't you see Tom? If Henry had known about your practice in London, I'm sure he would have tried to get a hold of you whenever we were there! But...we knew nothing of it!\" Now it was starting to dawn on me too...\"And my aunt never told me of your visits to London either...\" I said slowly. Jane and I looked at each other at the same moment with realization. \"She's been keeping us apart all of these years...and on purpose!\" I said vehemently. \"Why...if I hadn't spotted you three going into the recital that day...\" The very thought sent a cold chill through my heart. If I hadn't spotted them...we might very well NOT even be here together, right now, right this minute...my hands when automatically to my mouth with the realization of this. \"We may never have met up again...we might still be living our lives as we had been...\" Jane put into words my own thoughts. \"And I thought that she was being \"kind\"...being the friend I thought she was by NOT talking about you to me because she knew how painful our break up was...\" Jane sat down on the bed as she spoke these last words. I sat down beside her. \"She was more than happy to keep anything from me about you...EXCEPT...your marriage to Mary...and your success as a lawyer...\" I put my arms around Jane in comfort and gently kissed her cheek. \"It is as I have said Jane, there is nothing she can do to keep me from marrying you. And I very much want to.\" Jane didn't reply but I could hear sounds that she indicated that she had become a bit weepy at my words. I was still livid with my aunt however. \"My aunt seems to have forgotten that my own background was not one of wealth...\" I reminded Jane. \"And you know...Anne really has no right to talk herself when she wasn't all that wealthy before she married my uncle George. And I think it's high time that someone put her back in her place.\" \"Oh no, Tom!\" Jane looked up at me with a horrified expression on her face. \"Please don't! I'm sure it will just make things worse for us!\" But I was determined. \"Jane, Anne deserves to have the truth thrown right back in her face. I somehow doubt that my uncle George knows anything about her keeping us apart. I believe she did this all of her own accord. I am going to write her a personal letter and REMIND her of just where she herself came from BEFORE she married into the Lefroy family. As I have already said, she has NO hold over me. I am an adult with my own family and am free to do as I please.\" \"Tom...I don't know if this is a good idea. Perhaps it would be better if we just ignored her.\" \"Not this time Jane. She went too far. I will write her that personal letter and that will be the end of it. As I said, I doubt that my uncle George is even aware of any of this and as such, she certainly cannot and will not bring this up to him. Or anyone. Of that I have complete confidence.\" Jane looked at me, but didn't reply. \"It's going to be alright Jane, I promise you.\" I vowed. \"And now...please put away your clothes, Miss Austen as you are not going anywhere. Not without me anyway.\" I told her with a gentle smile. I was delighted to see her smile back at me. \"What is puzzling me is how she found out about our engagement so quickly!\" I now wondered out loud to Jane. \"I think I may know.\" Jane surprised me with her reply. I looked at her while she explained what had happened when they were back home in Chawton and how her mother had been angry that they wanted to leave her alone for Christmas but that Henry had taken her aside and explained that I had planned to propose to Jane. \"Henry swore her not to tell anyone, and I confess that I was quite amazed at her turnabout in regards to us coming here for Christmas that day. I know my brother can be very persuasive when it comes to my mother, but I had to admit that I wasn't expecting such a quick turn around. Henry only told me about this after you had proposed to me.\" Jane finished off her explanation. \"I haven't a doubt in my mind that my mother couldn't wait to let Anne know about our upcoming engagement, after having put up with years of her flaunting your marriage to Mary and your successes in our faces. I'm sorry Tom, it's all my mother's fault.\" Now it was all starting to make sense. \"Nonsense Jane. At least not entirely. My aunt was also to blame. She could have kept quiet about my life, but now I believe that she intentionally threw myself and Mary and my career in your faces. Perhaps your mother could have waited to tell Anne the news, but in all honesty, I can't really say that I blame her either.\" \"I'm not so sure my mother deserves your kindness and understanding, Tom.\" Jane smiled at me, but I could tell she was grateful. \"Of course she does, Jane. After all, she is obviously very happy about our marriage. I can't fault her for that.\" We both gave a small laugh at this. \"And now, I am off to write that letter and you have some...'unpacking' to do, I believe.\" I leaned in to give her a quick kiss before standing up and leaving the room to write that letter that my aunt deserved. Jane: It was a shock to see Tom standing at my bedroom door instead of Henry and I knew straight away that Cassandra was responsible for his being there. I should be angry at her but I was in such a state of hurt confusion over Anne Lefroy and her letter that what Cassandra had done was nothing in comparison. Taken by surprise, I was at a loss for words and found myself turning my back on him to quickly resume my packing up task. I did hear Tom call my name not once but several times...I did hear him tell me to stop what I was doing, but the more he tried to tell me to stop, the more I was determined to carry on. After all, what was the use of it all...it was happening all over again, just like it had 17 1/2 years ago. The sooner I could be out and away from Tom, the sooner I could get over my pain and begin healing...again...at least, I hoped I would heal this time. I didn't know what I would do about Anne Lefroy once I returned home though. I definitely never wanted to lay eyes on her ever again... It was here when I felt Tom's arms encircle my body making it impossible for me to continue on with my task. \"Let me go Tom...\" I said surprised at the rather savage sound in my own voice. It wasn't against Tom...it was because I was hurting so much inside...I hoped he knew that it wasn't him my harshness was directed at. But Tom continued to hold fast. \"'No. No Jane. I will not let you go. After you did your reading after the recital in London, I vowed that I would not let you go this time and I meant it.\" At these words I relaxed my body, giving into him. But I could only whisper that it was useless...that this wasn't meant to be, him and I... At my words he turned me around to face him. He gently lifted my chin up so that I had no choice but to look into his blue eyes as he assured me that his Aunt's letter meant nothing...that she could do nothing to prevent us from marrying. That she had no hold over him. I wanted so much to believe him, but I was also so afraid to. It was too coincidental that this should happen to us AGAIN... It was here that bared my heart about Anne Lefroy to Tom...and where I had drawn some conclusions about her...oddly, I found by opening up to Tom that I was actually calming down and my head was clearing somewhat. It was appalling what we had discovered about her between the two of us. I couldn't believe that I had trusted this woman and for all of these years. But Tom was still there...by my side...comforting me and reassuring me over and over that no matter what Anne did...we were still going to be married. That he still wanted to marry me. The more we talked it out, the better I was starting to feel towards everything. I admit that I was concerned when Tom vowed that he was going to \"throw the truth\" right back in his aunt's face. I felt that it could lead to nothing good especially for us, but Tom was determined to set his aunt straight. I had to trust him. I had no choice. Then he disclosed to me that his aunt had also not come from a very wealthy background. Another thing about Anne I had never known. But then why would she admit that to me...especially now that I realized what kind of a person she really was. Of course she would never let on that she too had come from a poorer family. By the time we had finished sorting everything out, I was feeling much better. I couldn't help but smile when Tom told me that I had some unpacking to do as I wasn't going anywhere...without him. I didn't want to go anywhere...and I certainly didn't want to go anywhere without him. And even though my mother can cause me grief at times, I was truly grateful how kind and understanding Tom was in regards to her because she really wasn't completely innocent in this herself. Tom gave me a quick kiss before he left the room leaving me to \"unpack\" our belongings. I sat on the bed for only a few moments after he had left, smiling at his retreating form. There was no doubt in my mind that I was a very lucky woman to have Tom. Indeed. Tom: Back in my office, I did not delay and intentionally used stationary from my law office with my name at the top of it in hopes to show my aunt that this letter should be taken very seriously by her. Dear Anne: (I decided right then and there that I would not even honour Anne by addressing her as my aunt, I was still so very angry with her. In fact, I was very tempted to address her as \"Mrs. Lefroy\" but I didn't even want to honour her by addressing her with a surname we both shared). I refuse to thank you for your letter concerning my engagement and marriage to Miss Jane Austen as I feel you have over-stepped your boundary by forbidding us to marry. I do not understand what makes you believe that you have the right to interfere in my life and tell me what I can and cannot do. If I were your son, then there would be no question of your interference. But as I am only your nephew, perhaps you care to explain it to me because after all you are a \"Lefroy\" by marriage only, not by blood. And even as a \"Lefroy\" by marriage, you do not deem it necessary to stay in touch with me at any other time, so why the sudden interest in me and my life now? I am an adult who has already been married and with a family of my own. And as you apparently like to keep pointing out to others, I am a successful lawyer so I am sure then that I am quite capable of making my own decisions regarding my own life. My sisters and my children have all taken a genuine liking to Miss Austen and I feel that as she is to become a part of MY immediate family that they should be the ones whom I should take into consideration with this marriage and no one else. I would also like to remind you of something that perhaps you have forgotten yourself during the years of marriage to my uncle George...Jane is not the only one to have come from a humble background...I did as well myself...and you also came from a somewhat of a humble background before you married my uncle George. And because of that fact, again I cannot understand why you feel you need to try and interfere with my marriage to Miss Austen, who in my own opinion, should no longer even be considered \"humble\" as she can claim to be a famous authoress. As a lawyer, I advise you to not abuse Mrs. George Austen in any way in retaliation for this letter as she is not the one at fault and any abuse on your part will only reflect negatively upon yourself. Thomas Lefroy I also decided that I would end my letter very stiffly and formally to show my aunt that I meant business. I read and re-read my letter to my aunt and completely satisfied with it, I folded it and put it into an envelope which I now addressed, sealed it shut and sought out Berkley to take care of it immediately. According to the book \"Cassandra and Jane\", Jane believed that Mrs. Anne Lefroy did play a part in keeping herself and Tom apart which is why I decided to bring it into this story.[Chapter 25] The next two chapters are a bit shorter as I originally I was thinking of making it one longer chapter but then decided that to make them into two shorter chapters instead. ;-D I am \"reposting\" the following information about Tom Lefroy's siblings, just FYI. ;-D 1). unnamed fifth elder sister (actual birth order unknown other than being older than Thomas) 2). Lucy (1 January 1768 – May 1853) 3). Phoebe (15 April 1770 – 5 December 1839) 4). Catherine (18 September 1771 – 3 September 1805) 5). Sarah (18 March 1773 – 1836) 6). Thomas Langlois (8 January 1776 – 4 May 1869) 7). Anthony (19 October 1777 – 7 September 1857) Anthony's son (Thomas Edward Preston Lefroy, 1815–1887) later married Anna Jemima Lefroy (1815–1855, daughter of Anna Austen Lefroy) on 9 September 1846 8). Elizabeth (17 April 1780 – 22 July 1867) 9). Benjamin (5 May 1782 – ?) 10). Christopher (26 June 1784 – 14 February 1805) 11). Anne (26 January 1786 – ?) 12). Henry (5 May 1789 – 29 January 1876) CHAPTER 24: Jane: During the week before the ball, Tom seemingly spared no expense and went all out with Christmas decorations for the house and for the ball. The result being that the house was now very merry and festive looking. He also got a hold of his siblings to let them know of our engagement, all of whom apparently were eager to meet me. I admit that it was all a bit overwhelming with everything seeming to happen all at once, but then a ball was a good place in which to meet several people at the same time. After the incident with Tom's aunt Anne, it was settled that Cassandra would stay on with us after we married and Henry and Eliza would take mama under their wing when they returned to England. Tom had been able to secure a clergyman for our wedding for Christmas Eve that day he had gone into Limerick. A young man who was not attached at the moment had readily agreed to come out to Tom's place on Christmas Eve to perform the ceremony for us. Tom had also invited him to stay and join us in a celebratory meal with us afterwards. The day of the ball, Tom's siblings all decided that it would be a good idea to arrive earlier in the day before the ball was to start in order to meet their brother's fianc e and they all arrived at various times throughout the day. I admit that I am glad that I already knew some of them, there being so many in the Lefroy family as that would leave less of them to get to know. Tom had done his best telling me a bit about some of his brothers and sisters ahead of time...I already knew by this stage that he had an older sister, Catherine who had died 10 years before. Lucy the oldest, was closest to Phoebe growing up and even though Phoebe had been living with Tom and helping to raise his children, the two sisters remained close. They were very much alike in their thinking. Anthony who was not much younger than Tom, was also the male in the family whom Tom was closest to. His wife had had a baby boy not that long ago whom they named Thomas. The resemblance between the two brothers took me by surprise as they looked quite a bit alike. I was also to find out that their similarities did not end with their looks. Elizabeth was a very sweet and gentle girl, perhaps a lot like the sister Catherine whom was no longer alive. Ben and Christopher were a little more like their older sisters Lucy and Phoebe in that they seemed to take more of a serious attitude, but were still very genial nonetheless. Anne, the youngest sister and Henry the youngest brother were both youthful and more like Tom and Sarah. I found it interesting that Tom's brother Henry and my own brother Henry were quite similar in that they were both spirited and \"playful\". These siblings were all married had of course come with their spouses. I confess that I was a bit nervous at the idea of meeting so many siblings but once the introductions were under way and eventually over with, I found them all to be quite delightful in their own way and was finally able to relax myself. I was grateful that I had time to meet and get to know them a little bit before the other guests started arriving for the ball, although I realized that it would be easier meeting Tom's friends and colleagues than meeting his family. The night of the Christmas Ball was finally upon us when I found myself by Tom's side greeting our guests...it felt odd for me to be thinking in terms of \"our\"... Tom's sisters and daughter's, even little Mary were all dressed up as fine as they could be. Jane was really becoming a lovely young woman now which made me wonder about young men at the ball... And Tom...was so handsome in his own attire that I really hoped that I looked as well as Cassandra and Eliza had said I did. Both Sarah and Phoebe complimented me as well as Tom's daughters. But it was Tom's expression on his face when he first saw me that really told me what I wondered. He didn't even have to say a word as I felt myself blush under his gaze. \"You look absolutely stunning, my love..\" He bent down slightly as he spoke in a low voice when he saw me in my ball gown. I tingled all over. \"You look very handsome yourself, Tom.\" I managed to get out rather weakly, but honestly. The happiness in Tom's voice was unmistakable as he introduced me as his fianc e...which I admit sent a tingle through me as well. Not surprising, every one of the guests looked at us in surprise at this introduction, but each of them also congratulated us and wished us the very best. When he was asked if the date was set, Tom's reply was \"It is to be a private ceremony with family only, right here tomorrow night.\" By the time all of the guests had arrived I almost felt worn out with all of it already. But when the music and dancing started and Tom and I had our first dance together since all of those years ago, I seemed to have my second wind... I danced with Tom's brothers and he their wives. But it was when I saw Tom dancing with his daughter Jane that something stirred in my heart. There was something quite endearing watching father and daughter dance together... As Tom and Jane had danced together Anthony, Tom's son, felt it was right to ask me to dance and smiling, I accepted... I was quite ready for a break when the meal was announced. I sought out Jane to let her know that we would wait until most people were sitting and eating before starting in on our own music. The piano had been moved to more of a central location so that it was not the center of attention, but could still be heard well enough. I offered to get Jane some food before our performance, but the poor girl claimed that she was too nervous to think about eating. I put my arm around her shoulders in comfort and with a smile I told her that I had every confidence that she would do just fine. Once again I promised that I would stay with her while she played her solos. As it was, I stayed with her right from that moment. When I felt the time was right, I pulled Jane over to the piano and together we sat down. With another encouraging smile at her, we started to play... I could tell that once we had started playing, that Jane started to relax somewhat. Although some people did continue to talk, some also stopped their conversations to listen. Some even made their way over to us. I hoped this would not make Jane nervous again... After we finished our duet, I suggested quietly to Jane that she start right in with another song which she obeyed. It seemed to work for her as she continued on in this manner, making her way through song after song. She continued to appear relaxed and played exceptionally well. She could not have done any better, I am sure. When she was finished she looked over at me and then in surprise to find that people had gathered around to listen to her. Immediately she blushed when people started applauding her, but I could see that she was pleased. She stood up and bowed politely, then went over to Tom who was also right there with such a look of pride on his face. I went over and joined them, hearing Tom say, \"You played just beautifully, Jane.\" \"Thank you, Father.\" Jane managed to get out in a barely audible voice. Now people started to surround Tom and Jane, complimenting Jane on her talent. Smiling, I hung back and let them enjoy the praise. But Tom would not have that for he called my name and beckoned me to join him and Jane. \"This is whom you should be complimenting. It was Jane's idea to have my daughter play for you tonight and it was also Jane who taught my daughter to play.\" All eyes turned on myself before I could deny it. \"Of course I cannot take credit for Miss Lefroy's talent.\" I protested quickly. \"It was Miss Lefroy who worked very hard and diligently to better herself. She deservers full credit. I can only be credited for helping her.\" At this point some of the younger people came up to Jane and asked her to join their group. I could see that she was pleased to be asked but still a little unsure of herself and possibly how she should answer. She looked at Tom who looked me. I gave him the slightest nod and he in turn gave a nod of approval which she returned with a delighted smile of her own and quite happily went off with them. The people who had been surrounding us also started to dispersed somewhat so Tom took the opportunity to say in a low voice, \"You were right about letting her do this Jane. I am very glad that you thought of it...and that I allowed it.\" \"It is good for building up her self-confidence and self-esteem. It already seems to be working.\" Tom turned to me with a serious expression on his face. \"I am truly grateful to you for this...\" The rest of the evening passed by fairly quickly between music, dancing, food and conversation. As Tom said when the last of the guests left, the Christmas Ball had been a success all around and admitted to being very happy that he had held the event. When everyone had gone, Tom and myself bade the children goodnight-with the exception of the younger three, Mary, George and Jeffry who had already been taken up to their rooms when they became too sleepy to stay up any longer. Cassandra, Henry and Eliza also decided it was time to retire. I thought it a good idea myself being that the next day was to be our wedding day. I found myself still unable to believe it was really, finally going to happen... I went around with Tom making a last check of things before ascending the stairs to our rooms. At my door, we stopped. \"By this time tomorrow night, you will be Mrs. Tom Lefroy.\" Tom reminded me in a low voice, but with a smile of pure happiness on his lips. I didn't know what to say, so I simply nodded and smiled back. Then Tom gave me a sweet, loving good night kiss before heading down to his own room...the room that I suddenly realized I would start sharing with him the following night...and for every night for the rest of our lives. With this thought in mind, I slowly entered for what would be the last time I would share with my sister and one of the last times I could call it \"our\" bedchamber. I took my time getting ready for bed and thing finally I blew out the candle on the nightstand and climbed into the bed beside Cassandra who wasn't asleep yet. \"It was a lovely ball.\" Her voice came out of the darkness. I smiled. \"It was. You enjoyed yourself?\" I asked her. \"Very much so. Tom has a lovely family. And some very nice friends as well.\" Was her reply. \"You and Jane played remarkably!\" She added. \"Jane was remarkable, wasn't she?\" I agreed. Suddenly, I reached out for my sister and held onto her. \"This is our last night together in this room Cass, the last time we will ever share a room.\" \"It is. I will miss you, but it is time for you to move on Jane. On to that other part of your life that has kept both you and Tom waiting.\" My eyes misted a bit at her words. \"Thanks to Tom though Jane, I will always be here in this house with you.\" \"And for that I am grateful.\" I replied softly and I hugged my sister.[Chapter 26] CHAPTER 25 Jane: Because of the late night before, everyone rose a bit late the next day. The day of my marriage to Tom, I suddenly thought with a bit of a jolt after I had woken up. Here it was, December 23rd and aside from the letter from Tom's aunt Anne Lefroy, nothing had stopped us from our wedding...yet. (My heart still continued to be in some doubt that the marriage would happen). One thing, his family-brothers and sisters that is-did seem to approve of me and best to my knowledge, didn't object to our union. I stayed in bed for as long as I dared to, wanting to savour these last moments that Cassandra and I would have sharing a room. Throughout the week since Tom's proposal, we made some arrangements for the wedding. One of those was an idea I had come up with. \"Do you think the children would like to be part of the ceremony?\" I had asked Tom not long after he proposed to me. He looked back at me in surprise at my question. I had already said without question that Cassandra would stand up for me. And Henry even volunteered to \"give me\" to Tom. \"I don't know.\" He had admitted. \"Why don't we ask them?\" And we did just that, before our reading that night. \"Miss Jane brought up an idea to me this afternoon.\" He addressed his children, which gained everyone's attention. \"How would you like to be part of our wedding ceremony?\" Not surprising, the girls first gasped but then quickly gave their affirmatives with obvious delight. The boys were a little less enthusiastic. \"How would you want us to be a part of the ceremony, father?\" Anthony asked. \"The girls would be attendants for Miss Jane, walking ahead of her to where myself and the clergyman would be waiting, while you boys would be my attendants, waiting alongside with me. As you are my oldest Anthony, I was thinking...I would be honoured if you would stand up for me.\" Tom explained. Anthony raised his eyebrows at this, in surprise I'll assume, but then he smiled at his father as he replied softly, \"Of course, I would be honoured to do so, father.\" To which Tom returned his smile. \"And how about you younger boys? Will you stand up there with your brother and sisters as well? For me and Miss Jane?\" Thomas, George and Jeffry all looked at one another at first as everyone else looked at them. I believe that it was because their other siblings were all going to be part of the ceremony that they too decided that they did not want to be left out. It really only took a moment longer for Thomas to agree to be part of it and then both George and Jeffry also agreed to it as well. And now the day was upon us. As we had only a week in which to prepare for it, we didn't worry about special wedding clothes. It was decided that we would wear our best clothes that had not been worn at the ball the previous evening. The only thing that really needed to be done was to move my clothes and personal items into Tom's room. I brought out my bag, set it on the bed and slowly put my belongings into it. Tom had instructed me before that once I was finished, I was to leave my bag outside his bedchamber door and it would be taken care of. Other than that, there wasn't really anything that we needed to do with any preparations so the day was spent rather leisurely which was fine with me. Tom had invited his brothers and sisters to the wedding which they accepted and like the day before for the ball, had all arrived at various times during the afternoon. At least this time, I was more familiar with them. I was rather enjoying the afternoon which was spent visiting with both Tom's family and my own that I almost forgot that it was our wedding day. We had decided on a 7:00 start to the ceremony which was to be followed by a celebratory meal that all of the guests were of course invited to stay for as well. Tom's staff had set up chairs in the ball room where the wedding would take place. The clergyman, a Mr. Palmer, arrived in plenty of time before the wedding. He did not show up only to do the ceremony and then leave. He arrived early on and sat down with us, with the obvious intention of getting to know who he was marrying. I liked how he made the effort to get to know Tom and myself. Before I knew it, the girls were all encouraging me to go upstairs and start to get myself ready. I was almost thinking that they were more enthusiastic about this than I was as they all seemed to be quite eager to get started on their own dress and appearance. I couldn't help but smile at them. I didn't understand it myself about the rush to do so as there wasn't much I needed to do but put on my other ball dress, but I humoured them and allowed them to take me upstairs to my-soon to be only Cassandra's-room. At least Cassandra came with me while Tom's daughters went to their own room to get ready with the help of Anna, Sarah and Phoebe. I admit that it was kind of nice to just sit and visit with Cassandra as her still unmarried sister, one last time. We talked over old times, about the dreams we once shared and what the future might hold for us yet. When at last we knew we couldn't...or shouldn't hold off any longer, Cassandra and I got into our own dresses. After helping me to redo my hair, my sister scrutinized me, fixing a piece of hair here or straightening my dress there...until she was satisfied with the outcome herself. Standing back, she said looking me over, \"Tom is a very lucky man, Jane.\" \"I think I'm the lucky one, Cass.\" \"You are both lucky then.\" She said firmly. There came a knock at the door just then, \"Are you ready in there?\" It was Sarah's voice. Cassandra and I looked at each other and then embraced. \"I love you Cass.\" I whispered to her. \"Thank you for everything.\" Again, I felt my eyes go misty as I said these words, feeling like I was going away from her forever. \"And I love you, Jane. I am not going anywhere. I will always be here for you.\" She promised me as if she could read my mind. Breaking our embrace, she took my hand and said, \"Let us go towards your new life.\" She then opened the door to Sarah and Tom's daughters whom, once again looked as fine as they had for the ball the previous evening. \"You look lovely Jane...\" Sarah smiled at me. \"Thank you Sarah, you look lovely as well. As do you girls.\" I returned smiling at each of them. \"Tom really has such a beautiful family.\" I was rewarded with beaming smiles all around. \"Phoebe has gone down to see if everyone else is ready to start. She will let us know when we can proceed downstairs.\" Sarah now informed us. Phoebe returned maybe 10 minutes later and with Henry to let us know that everything was ready. Under the direction of their aunts, Tom's daughters proceeded Cassandra and myself with Henry...first was little Mary, followed by Anne and then Jane towards the stairs and then down. Before Cassandra walked ahead of me, she quickly hugged me one last time. \"This is it!\" She whispered into my ear, then quickly took my hands into hers, giving them a gentle squeeze. Then with an encouraging smile she started after Jane. Henry held out his arm for me to take saying, \"Eliza and myself are truly happy for both you and Tom, Jane. You really do belong together and we are delighted that you have found each other again. Tom has more than proved his worth and I am both proud and honoured to escort you to your soon-to-be husband.\" Once again those tears gathered in the corners of my eyes at Henry's words. I blinked them back as I kissed my brother on the cheek and then smiled at him. \"Are you ready to start this chapter of your life, so to speak, then Jane?\" He asked me gently and without any teasing. \"I am.\" I replied as I nodded, then we too made our way to the stairs then down, on to the ballroom, towards my husband-to-be and my life as the second Mrs. Tom Lefroy... All eyes turned towards us as we entered the ballroom-I was glad that Henry was there with me. It was surreal to me as we walked between where the chairs had been placed in the soft glow of the candle-light and made our way to Tom and his sons who were all looking so handsome. When my eyes met Tom's, each become locked into the others until I was face to face with Tom. Henry kissed my cheek then taking my hand, reached out for Tom's then placed Tom's had over mine and lastly, Henry placed his own hand over both of ours. \"I speak for all of the Austen family when I say that we trust you to look after our Jane Tom, as she deserves to be.\" For the first time in a long time, I saw that Henry was completely serious as he spoke these words to Tom. There was not one single hint of humour or amusement in his voice or his face. Looking directly into Henry's eyes and speaking with equal seriousness Tom replied firmly, \"I will. You know I will.\" Henry and Tom bowed slightly to one another, then Henry left us to join Eliza who was of course already seated. And there amidst Tom's family both children and siblings alike and my own family...in the soft glow of candle-light and Christmas decor, Tom and I said our vows, pledging our love to one another \"til death do us part.\" At these words, I remembered other words...words that Tom had said to me on the night he proposed to me. \"...shall always love you even after our bones have turned to dust beneath the earth's surface. For eternity Jane, I shall love you.\" These words along with the emotions I had been feeling already because of the wedding were enough to cause a couple of tears to fall, but I smiled through them at Tom as he kissed me...after which our families gathered around us giving us congratulatory hugs, kisses and handshakes along with good wishes for a long, healthy, happy life together. Our families stood around visiting with one another while we took care of the legal part of our marriage. I finally felt like I could relax as everyone made their way to the dining room where Tom's...I mean, \"our\" staff had laid a splendid table of food for us to enjoy. Once we were all seated the atmosphere and conversation become more relaxed and casual...I would even say jovial, as we all enjoyed the \"bridal feast\". Because it was Christmas Eve, everyone decided to leave not long after they had finished their meal, once again congratulating us as they said their good-byes. As it was Christmas Eve as well as our wedding night, we had a special family gathering before retiring for the night. We did not read this night, instead we sat around and visited in a light hearted manner, discussing the ball, the wedding as well as Christmas. The girls expressed their enthusiasm for being included in the wedding while the younger boys, although wouldn't admit it as easily as the girls, admitted that they felt rather \"grown up\" being a part of this special ceremony and standing up front with their father. After we had exhausted our conversations and it was unanimously decided that it was time to go to bed, each of the girls came over and kissed me before leaving for their room. The younger boys chose to embrace me in a hug instead. But Anthony bowed to me and I returned it with a smile as I did not object to this. I understood that he was at an age where he was practically a young man and not too far off being independent. I respected his decision to acknowledge me with just a bow. Tom and I said our good nights to Henry and Eliza and lastly to Cassandra, who with a pang in my heart would be sleeping in what had been our room alone for the first time. Not that Cassandra and myself had never been parted, of course we had...both of us would go visiting different people at different times. And then there were the times I would travel to London with Henry and Eliza about my books. But this was different because we both knew it would be forever. But I held onto the fact that at least Cassandra wouldn't be leaving when Henry and Eliza left. She would remain here with us and for that I was once again grateful to Tom for understanding. Finally...it was just Tom and myself as we made Tom's usual rounds of the house before ascending upstairs to...\"our\" room. It was a large room of course, bigger than the one that Cassandra and I shared. Aside from the usual, the bed and chest of drawers, there was a trunk at the foot of the bed, a night stand on either side of the bed, two comfortable looking chairs, and a dresser with a mirror on it where there was a pitcher and washbasin which was partially hidden by an attractive folding screen. Smiling at me, he encircled my waist with his arms and said, \"Finally...here we are Jane...Mrs. Lefroy. Together at last.\" He bent down and we shared our first kiss as husband and wife... After a few minutes of just enjoying the moment, Tom pointed to the folding screen in which I could get changed into my nightgown behind. I had to assume that Tom was also changing, so I made sure to take my time as I admit that I was not ready to catch Tom half way through changing. After I had changed, I moved over to the dresser with the mirror and washbasin, let my hair down and started brushing it. As I had been purposely taking my time, I was sure that Tom should be changed himself by now and cautiously, I turned around and peered out from the screen and noticed that Tom who was now sitting on the bed had indeed changed. Breathing a bit more easily, I moved out slowly from behind the screen. As soon as Tom noticed me, he stood up, watching me. Feeling rather awkward, I made my way towards him, stopping just a few feet in front of him. He had a bit of a peculiar look on his face. \"What is it?\" I asked him, suddenly afraid that he maybe had changed his mind about marrying me after all. \"It's just...I have never seen you with your hair down before..\" he told me gently as he gazed at my hair and my face. \"It's beautiful...you are beautiful...\" I felt myself blush as his words, but I was pleased. As he advanced towards me, I suddenly felt slightly afraid again...afraid of what I didn't know and what he knew all too well...Without thinking, I held up one of my hands. \"Tom...this is all so new to me...please...forgive me...please can we hold off...on that for tonight?\" Tom stopped and looked a bit surprised at my words, but then reaching for my hands and taking them into his own he looked right into my eyes and said, \"I promised you that I would not force you Jane and I meant that.\" He paused for a moment here. \"But do you object to your husband holding his new wife on the night of their wedding?\" I shook my head at this, \"No...of course I've no objections...\" I replied softly. Smiling, Tom took my hands and lead me over to the bed, helped me in and after blowing out the candle on his side, took me in his arms. And we stayed like that through our first night together as husband and wife.[Chapter 27] WOW! I am BLOWN AWAY by the amount of Hits and Visitors total from the month of June! By far the most active month to date! And even today, SO early on in July, the numbers are amazing already! I thank each and every one of you for stopping by, taking the time and reading my Becoming Jane story that I have really enjoyed writing! ;-D CHAPTER 26 Jane: As it happened, we all...that is, Cassandra, Tom and myself decided it would be best if we accompanied Henry and Eliza back to Chawton. This would take care of a few of things. First, we could visit with mama as she couldn't be at our wedding-the word \"appease\" my mother also come to my mind-second, we could help with getting mama settled in with Henry and Eliza and third, Cassandra and myself could collect the rest of our personal belongings to bring back to Ireland with us. It was me who had thought it best to visit mama in England as opposed to having her come to Ireland for a visit as once she was at our place, who knew how long she would remain at our place. As much as I did love my mother, one thing I knew I was not ready for...or perhaps more appropriately, I knew that the Lefroys were not ready for weeks or even perhaps months with my mother. Not yet. And as Tom was due to be in court soon with his current client, we would only be able to stay for a week which suited me fine. That was a couple of months ago and now of course we had been back home and settled. I was delighted with the fact that, true to Tom's word, our daily life carried on as it had been from when Cassandra, Henry, Eliza and myself first arrived in Ireland before Christmas. Tom had reassured me that his children were not to become my responsibility, that our life would resume as it had been, after we were married. I must be honest and say that this was a bit of a relief for me as I do not know how well I would deal with seven children (and who were not mine nor any of my own families flesh and blood) bestowed upon me all at once. Or I should say , six children as Anthony was now settled at school in Limerick although he did come home on the weekends. I have no doubt that Jane would have been a great help to me with her younger brothers and sisters but all the same, I was glad for Tom keeping things as they were. As the days and weeks slipped pleasantly into spring, I found myself becoming fatigued easily. Along with the fatigue, I also started noticing a bit of pain in my left arm. I would find myself having to stretch it in hopes to help relieve some of the pain. But as I didn't really feel ill, I put the fatigue down to some minor common illness that comes with early spring that only time would heal and the pain as rheumatism as I wasn't that young anymore. I realized I wasn't feeling 100% but I really wasn't feeling very ill either so I didn't think it necessary to concern Tom and Cassandra about it. And the rheumatism...well, I definitely did not believe that I needed to concern my husband nor my sister about that. Although I did realize that if the pain didn't subside I probably would have to go to the apothecary and get something for it, so I would have to bring it up eventually. But not right away. I was sad to note that I did start to find it hard to continue participating with the children in their daily physical exercises and for that I was truly sorry. But I told myself that I would be able to rejoin them after the illness passed. I could only hope that with the rheumatism, I would have better days that would allow me to participate with them. One morning I awoke to find Tom smiling down as he stood over me, already dressed for work. I usually awoke when he did, but I assumed that he must have to be at his offices early for some reason, although he must have neglected to tell me as I didn't recall him saying anything to me about it. Or perhaps he had just been summoned this very morning on some sort of an emergency. \"Do you have an early appointment you forgot to tell me about Tom?\" I chastised him lightly. \"No Jane...I am leaving for work on time.\" Instantly, I sat up in bed, alert. \"What time is it?\" I cried out. \"It is half past eight.\" \"Half past eight! Tom! Why didn't you wake me up when you woke up? You always do!\" \"But I did!\" Tom protested. \"Don't you remember? You did wake up but you looked so tired. You must have not slept very well the night before. You fell back to sleep while I was dressing so I decided to leave you be. I informed the children, your sister and the staff that they are to let you sleep for as long as you need and that you are to have your breakfast when you wish it.\" I sat there not knowing what to say. I don't recall waking up at all... \"Anyway my love I must be off. I will see you later.\" Unconcerned, Tom leaned down and kissed me goodbye. I barely noticed it as I felt a bit baffled... Another day not too long after this incident, I felt that the illness must be passing as I felt a little more energetic and as the sun was shining, I was desperate to get out for a walk, so I summoned Cassandra that morning while the children were doing their studies, to take a walk down to the river with me. Not long after we started on our walk, Cassandra habitually took my left arm which caught me by surprise and made me wince from the pain of it. This gesture caused Cassandra to stop suddenly in her tracks which of course made me stop. She broke away and turned to face me with what looked to be a look of fright on her face. \"Cass? What is it?\" \"You're in pain...\" She replied. \"Well...yes.\" I admitted to her. \"Just a little ache really, Cass. Rheumatism, I expect. All of this damp spring air has aggravated it.\" \"But Jane...what of Eliza's mother our Aunt Philla? You tire so easily of late and now you are in pain. Aunt Philla fell ill with similar symptoms...she died from them, Jane! You know that!\" Despite my discomfort, I laughed. \"Dearest Cassandra! It's hardly the same thing at all!\" But my sister did not laugh nor even smile as I said this. Her expression didn't change. She continued to look serious. I tried to reassure her again. \"It's just rheumatism, Cass!\" Still hoping to at least put a smile on her face or make her feel more at ease, I went on. \"It's a good thing I am right-handed otherwise I would have to get you to do my writing for me!\" \"And I would Jane...if you needed me to write for you, I would. I hope you know that.\" Was Cassandra's reply, but still without a hint of humour in her face or words. Stopping my own laughter and smile, inwardly, I gritted my teeth against the pain in my arm as I lifted both of my arms to cup my sister's face in my hands. \"It's JUST rheumatism...\" I stated firmly, looking straight into my sisters eyes. \"What about the fatigue you have also been experiencing, Jane?\" Cassandra went on quietly, obviously not ready or willing to end this conversation just yet. \"It's just a spring time illness Cassandra which is already going away.\" \"How can you be sure?\" She persisted. \"Because I have felt better today. To the point of wanting to take this walk with you.\" I understood my sister's concern for my well being as had I been in her place I have no doubt that I would act exactly as she was acting now. I couldn't begrudge her that but I also wanted to make it clear that she had nothing to worry about. And now as Cassandra studied my face for several seconds-I returned the gaze unflinching as I did so-before softening her look and finally giving me her gentle smile. \"Alright then.\" She said. But her eyes betrayed her face and words. I knew she still doubted me but I decided to let it go as I knew the only thing that would convince her would be my getting completely healthy again. As far as I was concerned, she wouldn't have to wait for very long. In the meantime something else had come to my attention... Tom: I was rather surprised to find it was Cassandra who entered my study one afternoon, after she had knocked and I gave her permission to enter. \"Cassandra!\" I exclaimed, standing up and bowing to her. \"Tom...\" she returned the bow. \"What may I help you with?\" I asked, puzzled about her visit. \"It's Jane...I am very concerned for her health.\" Instantly, I was alert and felt the start of an unpleasant feeling in the pit of my stomach. \"What do you mean?\" I asked gesturing for her to sit down in the chair across from my desk, which she did. I also sat back down. \"Surely you have noticed how easily tired out she becomes these days, Tom.\" \"Yes...\" I admitted \"And...she's in pain too!\" \"Pain?\" \"Her arm. Her left arm.\" \"I admit that I have noticed her discomfort as well and I have brought it up to her. She claims it is rheumatism.\" There had been some nights in our bed lately when I noticed that Jane would be in obvious discomfort and would change her position in order to get more comfortable. After a couple of nights noticing this, I finally brought it up to Jane who told me firmly that it was nothing to worry about as it was most likely some rheumatism in her left arm. I didn't question her as it sounded reasonable to myself... \"Yes...she does.\" Cassandra agreed. \"You do not believe her?\" \"I WANT to believe her Tom, I really do as the alternative is just too horrible!\" \"What do you mean by that?\" Now she was scaring me and the feeling in the pit of my stomach grew just a little bit more unpleasant. \"My aunt Philla...who is...was Eliza's mother had developed similar symptoms which lead to an illness and ultimately claimed her life Tom...\" Cassandra finished off quietly. I sat back in my chair, stunned into momentary silence with this piece of information. \"No...\" I managed to whisper, my heart chilled with what Cassandra had just told me. \"I was with her, my aunt Philla and Eliza near the end. It was dreadful Tom. She suffered greatly before she died.\" Cassandra's voice which was starting to get a bit emotional trailed off here. I couldn't think of anything to say as I took all of this in. \"I don't want to lose my sister, Tom! I can't lose Jane! And especially this way!\" The tears now started flowing down Cassandra's face as she spoke. \"It's too horrible of a way to die! I couldn't bear to see her suffer so!\" Finally, I found my voice again and said aloud, \"I couldn't bear to lose your sister...my wife either, Cassandra.\" I told her gently, but firmly. Although I was shaken by what Cassandra had just disclosed to me, I knew I had to be strong. Strong for her...for Jane...for my family and for myself. I had to clear my head and think. \"Cassandra...\" I finally spoke up again and looking Jane's sister directly in the eye, I said in earnest, \"I promised your brother the night that we got married that I would take care of Jane and of course I meant that. I have the means to provide her with ANY medical care she may need. Doctors, medicine, even hospitals if it were to come to that. I WILL provide for whatever care or help or treatments she may require. THAT, I PROMISE you. Jane WILL get the best care I can give her.\" Cassandra looked at me, a fresh set of tears gathering at the corner of her eyes, but this time I realized that they were good tears. \"Oh Tom...how can we ever thank you?\" \"Of course there is no need to Cassandra. I love Jane at least as much as you do and I would do ANYTHING in my power to ensure her health. I am very glad that you came to me about your concerns of Jane's health. For now, you and I shall keep a very close eye on Jane and we will keep each other informed of any changes in Jane's condition both good or bad...but especially of course if she seems to be getting worse.\" \"Thank you again Tom. I do feel better having shared this burden with you.\" \"Of course Cassandra.\" I stood up as Cassandra did. \"One thing\" she said before taking her leave. \"Jane did say she is feeling less tired today. We took a walk down by the river this morning. It was her idea as she wanted to.\" \"Perhaps then we have no cause to worry after all.\" I replied feeling a bit of a relief at these words. \"I hope you are right Tom.\" \"As do I. Where is Jane right now?\" \"Reading in the library.\" I nodded my head, then Cassandra and myself bowed in acknowledgement to each other before she quit the room leaving me to think about all she had disclosed to me. After a few minutes of this, I found myself making my way to the library where I stopped just at the entrance where Jane would not notice me and looked in at my wife who was intent on the book she was currently reading. I couldn't help but think as I watched her...would God who had been so kind as to allow us to find each other again and become husband wife after all of these years also be so cruel as to take Jane away? That thought only made me bound and determined that Jane would NOT succumb to this dreadful illness, if she indeed did have it. Not if I could help it. Just so you know, I am leaving on holidays for a week, VERY early this Friday morning (July 8th) until the following Friday(July 15th VERY late), so of course there will be no new chapters for about ten days to two weeks from today. However, I have been working on the next chapter and SHOULD be able to post it soon after I get back. Take care and thanks again for your support! It means a LOT to me! ;-D[Chapter 28] Chapter 27: Jane: As time went on, the fatigue continued on and off. There were better days and there were worse days. We finally attributed it to my not being able to get comfortable enough during the nights to get a decent sleep because of the pain in my left arm that had not lessened any. Finally after starting to get beyond patience with it, I allowed Tom to purchase some medicines from the apothecary in Limerick for the pain in my left arm. It came in the form of bitter powders that had to be mixed in with water which I had to drink. And a new thing...at least for people. Liniment oil. That one I admit I felt a bit skeptical about as I knew that liniment was intended to help heal horses. Tom assured me (who had been assured by the apothecary) that people were now starting to try it out on their own aches and pains and with positive results. He begged me to at least try it, as in his words, \"It couldn't do any harm and it may actually help. It may help you to sleep through the night without pain.\" He had said. I had to admit that those words alone made me feel that I should at least try it. To have a good night's rest again would be very welcome indeed. Every night and every morning right after we awoke, Tom gently, attentively and lovingly rubbed the oil on my arm. The effect was that it really did seem to work and I was at long last blessed with better night's rest. However, the fatigue seemed to remain with me after all, although not as bad as it had been at times. It did seem to be easing a bit with my being able to sleep better at nights once again. With my ailments finally seeming to ease with the help of these medicines, I found myself enjoying more of a daily routine once again. I wanted to get back into the children's physical activities again but Tom wouldn't hear of it. \"Give yourself some more time.\" He pleaded with me. \"Give your body the time to make sure that you are really healthy again.\" And perhaps he was right as there was something still not quite right...although I didn't feel ill, I also knew that I was not 100%...and there was still this other thing that was more of a cause of concern for me than anything else. I knew I wouldn't be able to keep it secret for very long, but I was in two minds as to whom I should talk to about it. Of course I should tell my husband...Tom...but I wasn't ready to. I felt more comfortable in confiding in my sister first. The idea of bringing this up to her was going through my mind as Cassandra and myself were coming back home during one of our walks in April. \"Jane...\" Cassandra stopped me just outside of the house. I looked at her questioningly. \"You seem...preoccupied lately dearest...and especially today, on our walk. Are you unwell again?\" The look on Cassandra's face showed me how very concerned she was again for my health. Immediately, I put her fears to rest. \"No indeed, dear sister. My symptoms still seem to be easing.\" The look of relief on her face was unmistakable. But I knew that this was an excellent opportunity for me to let her know of my other concern. \"But...there is something...\" Almost at once, Cassandra's face clouded over with concern once again. \"What? What is it, Jane?\" She whispered. Suddenly I had a hard time getting the words out. I felt like if I said them, admitted to it, then it would be true. And I didn't want that... \"Jane! Please...tell me! You've got to tell me!\" Cassandra was getting frantic and I knew I had to ease her anxiety. I also knew that I couldn't go back and not tell her now. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath and...said it. \"I think...I think I'm with child Cass...\" I spoke the words in a barely audible voice. The silence that followed was deafening, so I opened my eyes and looked at Cassandra who was looking back at me in utter amazement. \"What?\" she exclaimed, still in a whisper. \"When? How? I mean...\" Instantly she blushed at her last two words, obviously not wanting nor needing the details. \"I mean...I thought you and Tom...were trying to...\" \"Prevent it from happening.\" I interrupted her impatiently. \"Yes...we were. But I also know there are always risks as there is only one sure way of preventing it from happening, Cass...\" \"Are you sure Jane?\" \"As I have never been with child before, I cannot be certain...but that one sign...you know...I haven't had it...for a little while.\" \"Have you been feeling ill?\" \"No...thank goodness, no. But we both know Cass that not all woman necessarily become ill.\" \"But isn't this good Jane? I mean, it explains your fatigue doesn't it? I know that has not gone away completely even with the help of the liniment easing your pain so you can sleep at night. And it's better than the other possibility...that dreadful illness that Aunt Philla died from.\" My sister was clearly more happy about this news than I was. \"How do we know that this isn't going to kill me anyway, Cass?\" I replied bitterly. \"How do we know that it will, Jane?\" \"Oh Cass! You have said yourself that being a mother isn't for me!\" \"I have seen you with Tom's children, Jane...I think I...we both underestimated you there.\" She replied gently. \"But I didn't give birth to any of them! I'm scared, Cass...we both know it's too common for women to die in childbirth. Tom and I have only just got back together...oh it's too awful! I always knew it was too good to be true, Tom and myself!\" I couldn't help it. The tears started falling. \"Nonsense, Jane!\" Cassandra spoke up more firm that I think I had ever heard her. \"This wasn't supposed to happen!\" \"You...you aren't angry with Tom...about this...I hope.\" I sighed and said quietly. \"No...of course not. As I told you, I know the risks. I am...confused...conflicted, however. I...I need some time alone. To think.\" And with that, putting one hand over my mouth, and brushing the tears that were now streaming down faster with my other, I turned and fled from Cassandra and ran to my favourite place down by the river. Tom: I cannot express my great relief that Jane seems to be responding to the medicines for the pain in her arm I had insisted upon purchasing for her. Of course she did still seem to be fatigued at times, but I didn't think it was as bad as it had been before she started taking the powders and liniment. It was while I was at my office in Limerick one afternoon that thought came to me out of nowhere. A thought so crystal clear, I don't know why it hadn't occurred to me before. I admit that there had been something nagging at the back of my mind of late and with this thought, I now know what it was. But this idea also shocked me so that I was unable to think about work or anything else. And because of that, I chose to leave and go home early even though I was at a loss as to what the best thing to do was once I got there. I hoped that the ride home would help to clear my mind somewhat. I discovered however, that the trip back home, did nothing to help me. \"Where is Mistress Jane?\" I demanded of Berkley as soon as I was in the door. \"Mistress Jane is out taking her daily walk with Miss Austen.\" Berkley answered me quickly and efficiently. \"Thank you, Berkley.\" I replied a little more relaxed. I gave Berkley my coat and hat and went off in search of my children to learn that they were still engaged in their physical activities. Normally I would join in with them, even part way through. But this time, I decided to not even let them know that I was home early. I needed some time to think. Instead of going to my study, I found myself in the drawing room nearest the door that Jane and Cassandra would enter upon their return from their walk. I took a chair near one of the windows which I knew I would be able to see them arrive back from, all the while trying to think of ways to bring up my thoughts to Jane. It wasn't really very long before I noticed Jane and Cassandra at first at a distance and gradually getting closer as they walked towards the house. Before they reached the steps to the door however, I saw Cassandra stop Jane. Surprised by this move, I found myself leaning forward in the chair and then I stood up and walked over to the window, keeping my presence concealed from them, watching them all the while. At first Cassandra looked upset as did Jane...but then I saw Cassandra's face brighten somewhat...but Jane's...did not. I frowned, wondering what they could be talking about. It was when Jane put a hand to her mouth and then brush her face with the other that I realized that...she was weeping! And then...when she turned abruptly away and ran in the opposite direction of the house...that was when I felt my heart turn to lead because that was when I knew, that she knew...I stood there at the window with my head now pressed against the cool glass, watching her quickly retreating back in agony. \"Jane!\" I cried silently, desperately wanting to be able reach her...to tell her it would be okay. I hardly even realized that Cassandra was now entering the house, but even without turning around, I somehow sensed that she was just outside the door to this room. \"She knows...doesn't she..\" Before she even said anything, I stated rather than asked, again without even turning around. \"Knows...what?\" Cassandra asked cautiously. \"About...the child. She knows she is with child.\" I replied. I heard Cassandra gasp slightly at my words. I turned around to see her looking at me in sheer astonishment. Before she could ask her obvious question, I explained. \"Mary eight of my children, Cassandra. I came to know the signs sometimes better than Mary did. Sometimes I knew she was with child before she knew. Or at least before she would tell me.\" I paused here for just a moment. \"It didn't occur to me until this afternoon because...because we had been using precautions...\" It was rather awkward having to bring up Jane's and my details about our intimacy to her sister, but I needed to make her understand how I had also reached the conclusion about the child. \"...and then with her arm being in pain, well, that's not a symptom of being in the family way of course. But something kept nagging the back of my mind and I knew not what. And after the medicines seemed to help the pain in her arm, but she still was fatigued, I remembered...for some reason, I remembered this afternoon how Mary used to become quite fatigued when she was with child early on. She tired easily. Some days she would sleep late...or go to bed early at night...or needed a nap after lunch. Much like what has been happening with Jane.\" Cassandra nodded slowly, affirming my guess when she realized that I was finished speaking. \"God, how she must hate me!\" I exclaimed in a low voice, my heart in pain. \"I PROMISED her that this would not happen. I know how much she fears it! And she is right to!\" \"Oh no!\" Cassandra now rushed up to me. \"No Tom, let me assure you that Jane does not hate you. She knows the risks. She knows that...that this can happen.\" I saw that Cassandra was also feeling awkward with this intimate part of the conversation. \"She is...she is feeling...confused right now however. She just needs some time...some time to think. She will come around, I'm sure.\" I admit that my heart felt a bit lighter at Cassandra's words, assuring me that Jane did NOT hate me after all. \"This has to be better news than her having that dreadful disease though, don't you think, Tom?\" Cassandra searched my face, trying to show me that this did not have to be a hopeless situation. \"Yes...I would like to think so.\" I finally agreed with a small smile. \"What should I do about Jane?\" \"Maybe let her approach you about it Tom. She needs to think about it first. Let her be the one to bring it up to you.\" Again, I nodded my head, gratefully. Cassandra was no doubt right that I should let Jane think about it first and then come to me. Jane: Although I still felt confused, my walk did seem to help me feel somewhat better about the predicament I now found myself in. I knew I had to come to terms with it and accept it. There was nothing that I could be done about it. I also needed to talk to Tom and let him know... Of course there was no real chance to talk to him until we were in our bedchamber for the night...and even then, I found it difficult to bring up to him. Once he blew out the candle, I felt a bit of courage come with the darkness. \"Tom...\" I began. \"Yes my love?\" Silence. I could hear Tom move and I knew he was turning over onto his side to face me. \"Jane? What is it, love?\" He asked me gently. I then felt his hand gently rub the arm nearest him. I had to speak now...there would be no \"forever holding my peace\" in this case. This was not something that I could hide for long. Closing my eyes, I took a deep breath and jumped in. \"I...I think...I think I may be with child.\" Silence again. And then. \"I kind of guessed.\" Were Tom's surprising words. My eyes popped open wide and I turned to face him in the dark. \"What?\" I whispered, astounded. \"Just today. This afternoon actually. Something had been nagging at me...and then I finally remembered. I remembered how tired Mary used to become each time she was with child.\" I didn't...couldn't speak for several seconds. \"I know how it frightens you, dearest Jane.\" Here I felt Tom's hands and arms reach out to hold me. \"Yes...\" I whispered. \"Very much so.\" I felt the tears start to gather in the corners of my eyes. Pulling me even closer to himself, Tom said, \"I promise you Jane, that you will have the best doctor from Limerick here along with a mid-wife. I will do ANYTHING I can to keep you safe.\" He vowed as he gently kissed the side of my face. Even though I felt reassured by my husband's words, the tears still fell. \"We will get through this my love. I promise you.\" I held onto Tom's body and his words. Several minutes later, I felt Tom leave me and get out of bed. He re-lit the candle on his side, picked it up and left the room, leaving me to puzzle over what he was doing. I wouldn't have to wait too long it turned out as he returned with something in his hands. \"What is that?\" The question came out before I could stop it. I knew perfectly well what it was. Tom smiled and said coming over to me and placing it on the floor on my side of the bed, \"A bucket, Jane. Just in case. You don't want to be caught at some unearthly suddenly hour needing it.\" I groaned. I hoped I would NEVER need it and I told him so. Tom laughed as he replied. \"I hope you won't either my love, but when Mary started getting the sickness with Anthony, this bucket was by her side of the bed pretty much throughout our marriage until...\" His voice trailed off here. \"Poor Mary! Was she very sick?\" I asked curiously and sympathizing with her. \"It came and went. Some days were better than others and it was different with each child. But she accepted it, she knew that it was part of being with child.\" Just as I knew I should accept it too, I thought grimly. Well, there wasn't anything to be done about it, I guess I would have to do the same. I would just try to not think about it...until the time came. Maybe I would be one of those lucky women who never got sick. I hoped so. I wish I could remember if mama ever mentioned that she was sick when she was with one of us. Being one of the youngest of my siblings, I would never remember. And mama would never have spoken about this to me unless I had been at home when Tom and I had become engaged. We never did have this talk. I guess I could only find out on my own. I do take some comfort in the fact that Tom is taking care of me as much as he can in that respect. Having been through this with Mary, he was quite learned in this...much more than myself of course. Tom now made his way around to his side of the bed, crawled in, blew out the candle and then pulled me to his body once again, kissing my forehead. A couple of weeks later, I discovered that I no longer needed to worry. But oddly enough, this just caused even more ambiguous feeling on my part. I was in my writing room on the morning of my discovery when Cassandra came into the room. \"Jane! Whatever is wrong?\" She came over to where I was sitting, on the settee with my knees drawn up under my chin, my eyes red with the tears that were still streaming down my face and a damp tissue in my hand. Immediately, she sat down beside me. \"What is it dearest?\" she asked, concerned. \"There is no child after all, Cass.\" I managed to get out, albeit rather shakily. She frowned at me slightly. \"No child?\" I shook my head slowly. \"I started feeling a little bit ill in the night and I thought it was the onset of the sickness that women can get. I was never physically ill...but this morning after I got out of bed...I saw that my monthly womanly duty had returned.\" I sighed. \"It was that which had made me feel ill.\" \"And...you are crying because...you are...relieved?\" Cassandra asked confused. Again, I shook my head slowly. \"Oh...Jane...\" My sister embraced me. Through my sobs, I explained, \"Once I had accepted this child as my fate, I started to develop some maternal feelings towards it. I can't really explain it Cass, but it's something that I never thought I ever would feel. And it was the most wonderful feeling...and Tom...every night since telling Tom, he would gently lay his hand upon my stomach...I feel such a sense of loss, Cass! Even though there never was a child! And now...now...I wish there was one...\" This started my tears flowing afresh. \"Oh, dearest...\" Cassandra held me while I wept. \"Maybe this was is for the best after all then, Jane. Perhaps that is what God is telling you.\" \"No...\" I said firmly, looking up at my sister. \"I don't believe that. If God was trying to tell me that, then WHY would he have given me such strong feelings for it? Why would I be upset now, if this was for the best? If it was for the best, I believe I would feel relief instead, but I don't!\" At my words, Cassandra didn't say anything, she looked like she was at a loss for words. \"And now...I have to tell Tom.\" I went on quietly. \"He also loved this child. He'll be so disappointed...\" I trailed off here without finishing off what I was really thinking, \"...in me.\" \"I'm sure he will be disappointed Jane, but not in you. He won't love you any less.\" Cassandra replied, seeming to understand the words I had not spoken. The two of us sat there for awhile, Cassandra being the wonderful, patient older sister that she is, quietly holding onto me, as there was nothing else to really say and it was obvious that we would not be doing any writing today. With Tom at work, I had the day in which to get used to the idea of there being no child and to think about how I would tell him... Tom: I cannot describe how very relieved I was that Jane was not angry with me, nor did she despise me for what had happened. And as much as I know that there is a risk with childbirth, I also cannot help but feel what a true miracle this child of ours is. I am beyond delight that Jane seems to have accepted this fate of ours and I daresay even seems to be looking forward to becoming a mother to our own. I had promised Jane that I would do anything and everything that I can to ensure a safe delivery. It is all I can do. Otherwise, it is out of our hands and we can only hope and pray that God wouldn't be so cruel... I came home one afternoon to find...nothing unusual really, except Jane. She seemed to be...preoccupied about something. I wanted to approach her about it but with my family about there was no real opportunity to do so. As the afternoon turned into evening, it suddenly occurred to me that sadness about Jane which did give me cause to wonder...which eventually turned to alarm as I recalled Cassandra's story about Eliza's mother's fatal illness and I wondered if the symptoms had returned. I had to find out as soon as possible! I wouldn't be given the chance to talk to Jane until we were in our bedchamber for the night. I let her change first and I changed as well into my night clothes, then waited sitting on our bed while she brushed out her hair. Once she was finished and came over, I stood up and reached out and took her hands in mine. \"I sense that something is troubling you Jane.\" I spoke up gently without any preamble. She started, surprised by my statement before sitting down on the bed. I sat down beside her, still holding her hands in mine. She looked down at the bed for a few seconds before starting to speak, still not looking at me. \"Tom...there is something you need to know.\" She said quietly. I swallowed, a dreadful feeling starting to creep into the pit of my stomach. I didn't like the sounds of this...I could already tell it wasn't going to be good news. Then I had seen the sadness in Jane... \"What I am about to say, is very hard Tom...\" \"Go on...\" I encouraged her barely managing to get the words out myself. \"This morning I discovered...there is no child after all, Tom.\" She whispered the words. I had trouble comprehending at first as this was not something I had expected at all. No child? I was unable to speak myself for several seconds while my mind processed the meaning of the words. \"I'm so sorry Tom! I know how much you wanted this child.\" Now Jane looked up at me and I saw tears on her cheeks. I took the back of my hand and gently wiped them away. \"Yes...I did.\" I admitted to her gently. \"But you need not apologize Jane. We thought wrong.\" I will not deny that this news was a bit of a blow to me. But I also had to think of Jane. At least her life would no longer be in jeopardy. \"Dearest Jane...you needn't weep for me any longer.\" I consoled her. She did stop, but with a different reaction than what I was expecting. \"I am not weeping for you!\" She shot out taking me by surprise. \"I mean...of course I am. But not only for you...for myself as well...\" She finished in a more subdued voice. I knew she had grown to accept the child but I hadn't realized that feelings for it might have become as deep as mine. \"Once I accepted this child, I did want it, no matter what the risks to myself were. And when I discovered there is to be no child after all...well...I can't even begin to describe the sense of loss I felt.\" Once again, I was taken by complete surprise by Jane's words. \"Are you saying that you wish to have a child now, Jane?\" I ventured to ask her. Jane stood up quickly at my question and started pacing around. \"No...yes! I don't know! When I had no choice in the matter, that was one thing. But now that I do...it still frightens me...and I also feel like if I say 'yes' that I am knowingly and willingly signing my own death warrant. Yet...the feeling I had when I thought I was...that too was indescribable.\" I could see just how conflicted my dear Jane was about all of this. I was silent for just a few seconds will I thought about the situation. \"Jane...\" I stood up and went over to her. Taking her hands into mine once again and looking into her eyes I spoke gently. \"What we could do is let 'nature take it's course'.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" Jane asked looking puzzled. \"We could stop preventing it from happening, but also NOT 'TRY' too hard to make it happen. We would just go about our life in a normal way as we have been. If it happens, it was meant to be. If it doesn't happen, then it wasn't meant to be. Does this sound reasonable to you?\" Jane was silent while she mulled over this idea, then slowly she looked up at me and slowly nodded her head in agreement.[Chapter 29] CHAPTER 28: Jane: In the coming days I found myself feeling better, seemingly getting over my fatigue. I was pretty sure by then that it had been nothing more than one of those early spring time illnesses like I had told Cassandra. As we were heading into summer, we carried on the family traditions started by Tom and Mary, the nightly readings and the pic-nics on the property on the nicer days. I was delighted that I was now able to join in on these pic-nic games that I wouldn't have been able to had my illness continued... It was later summer...or early fall when once again I made a certain discovery that one time had terrified me. But because of what had happened the last time, I decided to keep it to myself until I was a little more sure. By October, I could no longer deny it and this time, it was my husband whom I told first and not my sister. \"Are you sure Jane?\" Was Tom's initial reaction. \"This time I kept quiet about it for a few weeks until I could be a little more certain. And this time...there have been other changes...physical changes that I did not experience the last time, Tom. And...\" I paused here for a moment. \"I feel sure this time. I know that is not really much of a basis to go by, but I didn't want to keep it from you any longer.\" Tom's face lit up with obvious delight. He took my hands into his own and kissed both of them. \"And...how have you been feeling?\" \"So far, I feel fine, Tom.. A little tired at times, but not like last spring.\" \"Good. I am glad to hear it.\" He smiled gently down at me. Then his smile disappeared and was replaced by a slight frown. \"Does it still frighten you?\" \"I won't deny that it does, yes.\" I told him honestly. I needed and wanted all of the support I could get from him. \"But the feeling of joy in my heart does out-weigh it.\" Tom's face continued to look serious as he vowed firmly. \"I promise you Jane, that we will get through this...you will get through this. I will do whatever I can to keep you from any harm.\" \"I know you will dearest. You have told me so before and your words are a great comfort to me. They ease my mind.\" Tom embraced me then and held tightly onto me. \"I cannot describe the feeling you will experience when you hold our baby in your arms for the very first time.\" This statement of Tom's made me pull away just enough to be able to look up into his eyes. \"Did you hold your children?\" I asked in my genuine surprise, as it was commonly regarded that the mother and females of the children do the majority of their nurturing. \"I know it is common practice for the mother and females to attend to them, but when I first saw Anthony after he was born and each one after him, I could not resist. There was such an innocence about them. A beautiful innocence. And right then and there, I made the decision that as a father can not bond with his children in the same way as their mother can, I would bond with my children in whatever way I could. I held each one of my children whenever I could, for as long as I could for I knew that I would not be able to do so for long. They would grow up and quickly. I wanted my children to learn who their father was right from the beginning...by my touch, my smell and the sound of my voice. It will be the same for this child of ours.\" Tom's words brought tears to my eyes. It made me wonder if my father ever held any of his children. Regardless, even if he didn't, I knew that he loved all of us all the same. But the image of Tom holding his children as babes...our child, was the most beautiful I had ever had...I hoped I would be able to see it for myself... That night, Tom once again brought out the bucket and placed it on the floor on my side of the bed. \"I hope you will never need to use this my love.\" He said with his charming lopsided smile. \"I hope not either Tom.\" I replied rather wryly. Tom wanted to tell everyone straight away about the newest member of the Lefroy family who should be, if we had made our calculations correctly, making it's appearance sometime in the following spring. I hadn't even told Cassandra about it when Tom gathered everyone together the next day, the children, his sisters and Cassandra. \"Everyone, Mistress Jane and I have a very blessed announcement to make.\" He started off. I could hear the pride in his voice as he spoke. I was sitting beside him while he addressed everyone. \"Sometime next spring, we think maybe sometime in the month of May, there will be another Lefroy child. A brother or sister for you children.\" There was very tiny moment of silence before the girls all expressed their delight at the thought of a new baby in the house. The boys were a little more subdued about it, but seemed to accept the news in their own ways. I suspected that this was because it was more of a \"female thing\" having babies that the boys didn't really seem as enthusiastic or interested, but as long as they didn't object to another sibling, I was fine with their own reactions as I understood them. Both Phoebe and Sarah came over and hugged both of us while Cassandra hung back as they did so. When everything started to resume back to normal activities, Cassandra came over to me. \"You seem to be happier about it this time than the last time, Jane.\" She said to me. \"The last time it was not supposed to have happened at all...and it hadn't. It was a complete surprise...no, shock. But you knew how I felt when I discovered there was no child Cass, it was then that everything changed for me. Afterwards, Tom suggested \"letting nature take it's course\" and if it did or didn't happen, then that it was or wasn't meant to be. I am happy, although admittedly, not really very much less scared...or worried. But Tom has assured me of having the best of medical care he can provide to see me through it.\" Cassandra embraced me and replied, \"Then if you are happy about this, then we all should be.\" When we broke apart, we had noticed that all of the children and their aunts had left the room. With the exception of Jane. She had looked very happy at the announcement, so I was surprised to see that she now had a worried look on her face. Or was it a frightened look? No...the word \"haunted\" came to my mind. Of course...she lost her own mother to childbirth. \"Jane...dearest, are you alright?\" I asked going over to her. She didn't or couldn't reply, but she did embrace me. \"Oh my dear. It's going to be alright.\" I tried to reassure her. \"I don't want to lose you too.\" She managed to choke out. \"Oh dearest. Your father has promised to have all of the medical care I will need. Your father told me once that because your mother had given birth to seven healthy children without any trouble, that they were unprepared for what ended up happening the last time. And because of that, your father wants to make sure that it doesn't happen again.\" I realized here that no matter how much it still frightened me, I must not show it for Jane's sake. I must be strong for her. \"Are you sure?\" She now dared to look at me. \"Of course, I'm sure. If it would make you feel better, you should go and speak with him about it.\" \"I might do that yet.\" I nodded and smiled encouragingly at her. She gave me a rather watery smile back, but I could see that she seemed to be feeling a bit more calm about the situation. Watching her leave, I suddenly felt a bit concerned...I hoped that we had made the right decision for Jane's sake as well... Tom: I was more than ecstatic when Jane told me about the expected child. Of course now that it was a reality, all sorts of concerns entered my mind. For both Jane and the child. I wanted desperately to make sure that they both survived. As much as I hated to, I felt it would be best to forbid Jane to continue on with any of the children's physical play for both hers and the child's sake, effective immediately. She could of course still take daily walks with Cassandra as long as she didn't exert herself. I would also take Cassandra aside and make her promise to keep Jane from overdoing it. I already knew that Cassandra would agree to this. For each new child expected in family, Mary and myself had always gathered our family together to tell them of the news. This child would be no exception. As in the past, my children were quite accepting of their newest sibling. But if there was one thing I hadn't counted on, it was my daughter Jane. She had looked just as thrilled as her sisters had when I had announced it, so I was surprised when she turned up outside the door to my study shortly afterwards, her demeanor seeming to have changed, although I didn't know why at that moment. \"Come in.\" I responded automatically when I heard the knock. \"Jane!\" I exclaimed in surprise when I saw that it was my daughter. I stood up as she walked in and I indicated the chair across from myself. She sat down and I followed suit. \"Father...\" she began. \"Please...forgive me, but...do you think having a child is wise?\" I gaped at my daughter in shock at her question. \"What do you mean my dear? I thought you were happy when I made the announcement.\" \"I was...\" she replied slowly. I frowned at her as she spoke. \"But...?\" I encouraged her. \"It's how we lost mother...\" she spoke in a quiet voice. Of course. How selfish of me to forget how much Jane had been affected by Mary's death. \"I don't want to lose Mistress Jane too!\" I got up and came around to Jane's side of my desk and embraced her. \"Dear heart...what happened to your mother...we were not at all prepared for. She had given birth to seven healthy children without any trouble. We never expected that anything would go wrong the last time. And because of that, I will have the best doctor in attendance for Mistress Jane.\" \"Mistress Jane did tell me that already. About what happened with mother...and that you would make sure it doesn't happen again.\" \"And she is right, Jane. I will make sure that every precaution possible is taken with the birthing of this child. Please Jane...I do not wish for you to concern yourself about this. I know that is a lot to ask as you are nearly a woman yourself and you have already started to understand about this part of life. But I would rather you kept, good, happy positive thoughts about all of this.\" An idea suddenly came to my mind. An idea that would make Jane feel useful and would hopefully help to stop her from thinking about the birthing too much. Especially so early on. \"What you could do is anything to help keep Mistress Jane happy and comfortable. There may come a time when she does not feel well at times, just like what happened with your mother if you recall when she was with your youngest siblings. It would be a great help to both myself and especially to her if you could do anything to help keep her happy and comfortable. I am sure I can depend upon you for that.\" \"Of course you can father.\" Jane seemed to like this idea. \"And I know that Mistress Jane will really appreciate it as well. I'm sure she would enjoy spending some quiet time with you.\" Jane beamed at me before standing up and leaving the room. I sat back down at my desk and continued on with my work, feeling good about the idea I had just given to Jane. It would hopefully help both of the out during this time, I thought to myself satisfied. Jane: As it had been bothering me all day, I brought it up to Tom later than night when we were in bed. \"I hope we have made the right decision regarding \"letting nature take it's course\" Tom. After the initial announcement and everyone had left, Jane seemed very concerned over it. I haven't a doubt because of what happened with her own mother. She told me in her own words that she didn't want to lose me too. She was upset Tom.\" \"I know...\" Tom replied. \"She did come to see me as well. She said that you had told her to talk to me about it. I reassured her as much as I possibly could. She does love the idea of their being another sibling in the family, but there is no doubt that she is also very concerned.\" \"She seemed to be better after I reassured her with what you told me yourself. Do you think you were also able to convince her?\" \"I think so...I hope so. The problem is that Jane is now old enough to know better. She can't be \"fooled\" so to speak. We can only convince her as much as we convince ourselves.\" \"Oh I hope we have done the right thing after all, Tom.\" I fretted. \"Even though I am not Jane's mother and have no intention of replacing Mary for her, I do not wish to put her through a similar scenario that she went through with her own mother. I am now more concerned for her than I am myself.\" \"Shhh...\" Tom reached for me and held onto me, making me feel better, more calm. \"We cannot do anything about it now, but I can do anything and everything I need to this time that I did not even think I needed to do for Mary. I will search for the best doctor in Limerick and have a consultation with him or perhaps even several consultations over the next few months and get all of the advice he can offer and his word that he will be here when the time comes.\" Tom promised me. Just as he had promised, Tom set off the very next day and was able to find one of the best doctors in Limerick who agreed to take me as his patient. He reminded me a bit of Tom in that he was a young doctor who was more of a \"modern\" thinker and doer. The first consultation we had and ones to follow also helped to relieve myself (as well as Tom, I'm sure) of our child birthing concerns. Of course he did also remind us that there can be no guarantees, but that over the next few months he would devote his time to studying birthing deaths and ways in which they can be prevented. One night, I was awoken by a horrible sensation...I leaned over and my hand sought desperately for the bucket which I found just in time. I was only barely aware that someone who could only be Tom of course, had grabbed onto my hair and was holding it out of the way for me, simultaneously rubbing my back. I had the vague notion that he undoubtedly had done this for Mary numerous times. \"I'm sorry Tom.\" I whispered weakly when at last I fell back onto my pillow. Apparently, I was not to be amongst those lucky women after all. \"You are apologizing for being ill?\" I could almost hear the smile in his voice. \"You can hardly help it my dear.\" \"I did wake you up. \" As I was speaking, he lit the candle on his side of the bed, got up, brought over the water pitcher and a glass and set it down on night table on my side of the bed. He poured me a glass of water and handed it to me saying, with that smile on his face that I had pictured in the dark. \"Don't be silly, my love. I am here for you, just like I was there for all of my other children.\" These words brought tears to my eyes. I was finding out more and more about what kind of a man, both family-wise and husband-wise, Tom really was. I was more than lucky to have him.[Chapter 30] Chapter 29 Jane: Now that my condition was a definite one, I was strictly forbidden by Tom to participate in any of the physical activities with the children. \"I am not willing to take any chances with you or our child, Jane.\" He told me firmly. Then added more gently, \"Humour me love. I know that you do not like to be left out of it, but it won't last forever.\" I admit that I hated not being able to join in once again, but I knew he was right. Besides, now that the illness had taken a hold of me, I wasn't always feeling up to it. I was not only physically ill, but I found myself lacking energy as well at times. I lamented that, but perhaps if I were feeling good I would find it more difficult to not to be able to join in. I had to keep reminding myself of Tom's words that this would not last forever. I could only forge ahead and hope that this part of my condition would end sooner than later... Tom: I felt bad for Jane when she started becoming ill. I really had hoped that she wouldn't get the sickness because I knew that she had no patience for such things and it would be unbearable for her. I could only hope now that it wouldn't last for long nor that it would be constant. Even though she soldiered on with it and never complained, I still felt guilty watching her. When I had learned of her condition, I forbade her to participate in the children's activities as I was concerned for both her and our child. But since the sickness started, one could tell that she would not have been able to anyway. She looked not only ill, but forlorn as well. For days I wished that there was something I could do for her. Then one day it suddenly came to me. Of course! I fairly flew to the kitchen to seek out my head cook Katie who had been with our family since Mary and I were first married. \"Katie!\" I called rather breathlessly as I entered the kitchen. \"Sir?\" Was her surprise reply to my bursting into the room at an unusual time of day. \"Katie...I need you to make up a batch of your broth that you used to make for Mistress Mary for whenever she was ill with child and for the rest of the family whenever we fall ill with stomach ailments. As you must know by now, Mrs. Lefroy has also started becoming ill now that she is with child. Please make some up as quickly as possible. You have my leave if you need to purchase anything in which to make it with. Or send someone to get it for you if you can start without. The sooner you can make this up, I would be truly grateful to you. As would Mrs. Lefroy I am sure.\" \"Right away, sir. I believe I may have all I need but I will look over my stock and send someone to fetch anything I will need.\" \"Thank you Katie, you are a godsend.\" I then left the kitchen and task in Katie's capable hands and walked back to my own study feeling much relieved that by days end, Jane should be feeling better. At least I hoped so. Jane: Tom came up to our room late one afternoon when I was feeling particularly ill and I had gone up to our room around tea time to rest...and as I didn't feel that I could stomach anything just then. He came in carrying a tray with a bowl of something that was steaming on it. I sat up on our bed when he entered the room. \"If that is food Tom, please take it away as I do not want anything right now. I came upstairs so that I would be away from food and the smell of it.\" Tom smiled at me as he sat down by me on the bed. \"But this you must at least try Jane. It is a special broth that Katie used to make for Mary whenever she was ill with child. We have each taken some whenever we have been sick and even I can vouch that it really does seem to help settle the stomach. Please love...at least try it.\" He pleaded with me gently. As much as I doubted that something as simple as a broth would settle my stomach, I had to try it. I would try anything at this point... Tom picked up the spoon and started spoon feeding the broth to me... At first I gagged a little bit at the smell of it but I forced the first few spoonfuls down slowly anyway...and...after that, I had to admit that it really did seem to help me. I was starting to feel a bit better, I thought. I was surprised when Tom announced that I had finished the bowl. \"Perhaps you would like some more?\" He asked me with a smile on his lips. \"Perhaps...and...perhaps with some bread to go with it?\" I asked hopefully, happy that my appetite seemed to have returned with the help of the broth. Tom laughed as he stood up. \"And something to drink as well. I would be delighted to bring you anything you wish to eat my dear.\" He bowed slightly. \"Thank you Tom...and thank Katie for me as well, please.\" \"Of course.\" He quit the room then, obviously as happy as I was feeling. I was not only grateful for Katie's special broth, but also for the company that Jane started keeping with me during this time whenever she was able to. It did help me to keep myself occupied in any way. She had started keeping me company not long before the sickness started. But it was while I was feeling ill when I appreciated her the most. If I was feeling particularly ill enough to keep to my bed, she would read softly to me while I lay down with my eyes closed and let the words take me away from the dreadful feeling. When she was finished, I always reached for her hand and smiled at her while I held hers in mine. I realized that she was happy to be doing this for me. On the days when I felt well enough, I encouraged Jane to play some piano while I listened. And once I started taking Katie's broth and ultimately feeling better, I would even sit down and play a little with her. Of course there was also Cassandra's and my walks which we continued to take as long as I felt up to it, albeit a bit more leisurely...and we didn't go as far as we used to, but we would again one day. All of these activities really did help me to get through what I refer to as the worst time of my condition, the early stages. One day I ventured to ask my sister something that I had been thinking about for awhile. \"Cassandra...\" I started, \"I would like you to be in the room with me when my time comes.\" I decided to come straight out with it. Not surprising, really, Cassandra looked at me in shock. \"What? But Jane! You KNOW that only married women are allowed in the room with the mother! Even if I were allowed, I am not so sure that I would be suitable. Perhaps our mother would be a better idea.\" She finished, looking at me hopefully. \"No, not our mother, Cass...\" I said gently, taking her hands into my own. \"Please Cassandra...I know it's not common practice to have a single woman in the room, but you are my sister. The one who has always been able to comfort me. I am sure I will need a great deal of your comfort on that day. I have already asked the doctor about you being with me and he is fine with it. I dearly wish that Tom could be in there with me but we all know that the only men allowed in are those who are practiced in medicine.\" I was pleading with her now. Cassandra sighed. \"You don't have to witness the birthing if that is what you are concerned about Cass...\" I quickly added, believing that this may be what was troubling her most. I couldn't say that I blamed her, as I am not so sure that I would want to witness a birth never having had anything to do with one before. \"I just want you in there to hold my hand or hands and speak encouraging words to me, helping to keep me focused. Cassandra...we are equal in this...neither of us has ever witnessed a birthing nor ever given birth before. Please do me this one great favour.\" \"Of course I will, Jane.\" Cassandra finally agreed much to my relief and joy. As time passed, the sickness seemed to abate and even though just to make sure, I would still take Katie's broth from to time, I was also beginning to notice that I did not need to take it all of time which was a blessing in itself to me. I was starting to become heavier with child and I knew it would only be a matter of time before I would be confined to the upstairs. As it was, Tom was already begging me to stay upstairs, but I would not hear of it. \"You know how much I hate the thought of being apart from everything and everyone Tom...I will be confined to the upstairs and our room soon enough. As long as I am capable of walking, I want to be able to go downstairs.\" \"But Jane dearest love, it is the stairs that are my concern now. They can be a hazard especially now. What if something was to happen to you while you were either going up or down?\" But I remained obstinate in this case. \"Then I shall have someone accompany me every time I use them. I am sure that Cassandra wouldn't object.\" Tom didn't look too happy with my suggestion, but he also knew he wouldn't be able to change my mind. I felt a twinge of guilt so I gently promised him, \"I will use the stairs as little as possible. I promise.\" Tom's expression also softened somewhat, but I could still see the worry in his eyes. I embraced him to show him that I loved him for his concern. Not surprising, it wasn't only Cassandra who helped me whenever I needed to use the stairs, Tom was also there to help me as often as he could which, knowing that he was concerned enough to want me to avoid using the stairs altogether and stay upstairs told me that he respected my decision, even if he couldn't completely agree with it. I did understand Tom's concern, but Tom also understood my need to have at least some human contact with people and activity each and every day for as long as I possibly could. Because of this, our compromise worked for us. \"Have you any ideas of what you would like to name the child?\" I asked Tom after we had settled into our bed one night. \"No, I haven't really.\" He admitted to me. \"Have you?\" \"Well...I was thinking that if it's girl, I would like to call her \"Cassandra\". \"After your mother.\" Tom stated rather than asked. \"No! Not after my mother!\" I exclaimed. \"After my sister. It is a bit of a shame that they do share the same name as I have always been closer to my sister than my mother, but in this case, it is my sister and only my sister that I am thinking of. But our child would be \"Cassie\" for short. However, I feel if this child is a girl, I should do my daughterly duty and have something of my mother in there so I was thinking of \"Leigh\", L-E-I-G-H as that was my mother's last name before she married my father. And I also would like to include your mother's name and the way she spelled it, without an \"e\". Cassandra Leigh Ann. If you approve of course.\" \"Cassandra Leigh Ann Lefroy...\" Tom repeated thoughtfully. \"That is really thoughtful of you to want to include my mother's name.\" \"Of course Tom. She would be her granddaughter. Does the name meet with your approval?\" \"I think it is lovely name for a girl. Our daughter.\" \"I do have an idea for it if it's a boy as well. As there are so many repeated names between our two families, there is one male name that hasn't been used for first name in either of our immediate families. Your father's first name was Anthony, but you already have a son named Anthony, so I thought of his second name, Peter. I was thinking, Peter for the first name and then I had initially thought of George-after my father. But then I thought, even though this would be a second name, as you already have a son and I have a brother named George, perhaps we could use the name Austen instead and in that way he could still be named for my father. Lastly, I would like to include the name Henry-after my brother whom I adore...and of course you also have a brother Henry although I do realize that you are closer to your brother Anthony but as I said, that is already the name of your first son, and as it should be. But I know that you are fond of my brother Henry as well. So Peter Austen Henry Lefroy if it is a boy.\" \"Austen...that is different. I like it because it is different. I think it is wonderful of you to want to include my parents in on the name no matter if it is a boy or a girl. But we could name him Austen Peter Henry Lefroy just as easily.\" \"No..a son's first name should be after his father or his father's side of the family.\" I insisted. \"Then I cannot object to it. Both names suit me fine.\" Was Tom's reply before he embraced me and kissed me. The \"BIG DAY\" draws near...;-D[Chapter 31] Chapter 30 Jane: Time continued to move towards spring and the day of our child's birth. With both Cassandra's and Tom's help, I was managing to spend every day on the main floor with the family and for this I was truly grateful. As much as Tom had wanted me to start staying upstairs earlier on, I could tell that he knew he had made the right choice by accepting my decision to not start confining me so early. Even he knew that I was happier and therefore was more patient than I might have otherwise been. I had it explained to me by the doctor what signs to expect that would tell me that our child was on it's way. I had admitted to Tom afterwards that I did not like the possibility of some sort of fluid...or \"water\" coming out of my body whenever the child decided it was time to be born. I didn't like that it could happen at any given time and that there would be no warning before it did. Having a lot of nieces and nephews, I was not completely in the dark about the basics of the birthing process, but as this was my first time, it was different than just being the sister-in-law of the expectant mother. Tom had laughed when I had mentioned not liking the fluid part, telling me that this was one of the reasons why women started staying in their rooms when the time grew nearer. So that this sort of thing wouldn't happen anywhere but \"where it was supposed to.\" In the birthing room and bed. I had to admit that it was a good point. Perhaps then, I really will have to consider staying in my room sooner than I wanted to, but I still planned on leaving that for as long as I dared. There came a night when I was awoken by tiny constant pains in my abdomen. I had also been told by the doctor to expect this and if I were to start experiencing this particular thing, that there was a very good chance that the baby was on it's way and this is when Tom should send for him. As they didn't seem too bothersome to begin with, I didn't wake Tom. I could be wrong about them and I didn't want to rush Tom away and bring out the doctor if I am mistaken. I decided to leave things and see if anything came from them. Throughout the night though, the pains would not let me rest very much. They seemed to get a little more intense although still nothing I felt was unmanageable. Still, I felt I should at least warn Tom. But before I did, I made a second discovery...now I was sure I should tell Tom. \"Tom...\" I came back into our room and came upon him getting dressed the next morning. \"Yes, love?\" \"Some pains in my abdomen kept me awake last night.\" Tom stopped dressing and stared at me. \"And this morning...there was a little blood...\" Instantly, he became mobile. \"Then I must send for the doctor and midwife at once.\" He said matter of factly. He finished getting dressed quickly and got ready to leave the room to put things into motion. Just as he reached the door, he turned to me and with an encouraging smile said only two words, \"It's time.\" Then he kissed me. I followed him out into the hallway and the stairs where he turned once again to me. \"Under NO circumstances are you to use these stairs today Jane.\" I knew he meant business by the tone of his voice. A tone he very rarely uses when he's talking to me. \"You are to get into the birthing bed and STAY THERE. And I expect to see you in that bed when I return. I will send Cassandra up with a tray of food for your breakfast, if you feel like eating. I won't be long. I will send someone for the midwife, but I prefer to get the doctor myself, especially if he cannot be found at home.\" Those words gave me a bit of a fright. I didn't like the idea of the doctor not being in the room with me like he had promised. \"Why wouldn't he be at home?\" I asked Tom. \"Because he's a doctor, Jane...he could be out on a house call.\" Oh. Right. I hadn't thought of that. I must have looked worried for Tom now said, \"Don't worry Jane, he has promised to let his footman know of his whereabouts whenever he needs to make a house call, in case we need him. He has also promised that he would make himself available to us as soon as we need him. He will have another doctor take over for him if he is in the middle of a house call. As I have said, I will go myself and get him. I would feel better if I did.\" Tom's words made me feel better. He kissed me once more before saying firmly-although I detected that twinkle in his eye as he said, \"Bed. Now.\" Then he quickly descended the stairs while I made my way back to our room. This time I didn't have a problem with obeying Tom's orders to stay upstairs. It was fine with me as I hadn't leaked any of that 'fluid' yet and I didn't want to take any chances on that happening anywhere except \"where it was supposed to.\" I did what Tom bade me to do and went back to our room, only I didn't get into the 'birthing bed' that was set up for \"my time\" just yet, but I did sit on it while I waited for Cassandra to appear with food. I was hungry enough to eat at least. The onset of birthing hadn't stopped my appetite. I didn't have to wait very long for Cassandra to arrive with my breakfast tray. She looked a bit flustered when she entered my room. \"Tom says it's time.\" She said. \"Apparently so.\" I replied. \"He has been through this more often than I have.\" \"Why aren't you in bed, Jane?\" \"I don't think I need to get in quite yet Cass. I do not believe that I am that far along. However, if I am then I have had child birthing all wrong. It is not all that bad.\" I could tell by Cassandra's expression that I couldn't possibly be far enough along yet. Even though Cassandra had never married, when she was engaged to Robert Fowle, I knew that my mother had had \"the talk\" with her and in that respect, Cassandra did know a little more about what I am going through than I do myself. But not having actually gone through it herself, Cassandra still didn't believe that she was the right one to tell me about it. Perhaps she is right as she really wouldn't be able to answer any questions I might have. \"Tom said that you are to be in bed.\" \"Not yet Cass, there'll be plenty of that to come. I promise that I will go to bed as soon as I start feeling worse.\" \"Tom will be angry to find you still up and about.\" She tried to coax me. \"I don't think he will.\" I replied knowing my husband better than she. \"Well then eat your breakfast at any rate.\" Cassandra said in a rather resigned voice. Smiling at her, I gladly accepted the food and ate it. Tom: As soon as I reached the bottom of the stairs I wasted no time in seeking out my most trusted footman-next to Berkley of course-and sent him on his way to fetch Mrs. Charlotte Humphries, the midwife while I myself made ready to go into Limerick to fetch Dr. Knight. I quickly explained to my sisters that Jane's time had come and that there would be no lessons for the children and that I would be taking them to Anthony's after I returned with the doctor. I rode horseback this time for I wanted to make better time than I would if I took the carriage. Having been through this several times with Mary, and it being Jane`s first time, I was certain that there was plenty of time, but I admit that I would feel better having the doctor there as soon as possible. I was sure Jane felt the same way. I was happy to find when I reached his place of residence that he had not quite left for the day for his office. I gave him a brief description of what stage Jane was at with the birthing, then he took a quick inventory of the contents of his bag, went in search of a couple of items, added them to his bag and then we were on our way. I had expected him to ride in his carriage but as soon as he learned that I was on horseback, he opted to travel in the same fashion. I explained to him that I needed to quickly stop by my own office and let them know what was happening. As the doctor knew where we lived, he offered to go ahead and I promised to catch up with him very soon. I caught up with the Dr. Knight about half way to my home and we rode the rest of the way together. At my place, the footman whom I had sent for the Mrs. Humphries was still at the horse barn taking care of his horse so I put him in charge of taking care of our horses as well. Inside the house I lead the doctor upstairs and to our room where I found Jane and not really surprising to me, sitting on the birthing bed beside Cassandra. Any trace of a breakfast had already been cleared away and the midwife Charlotte was bustling around making sure that everything was ready. I did not admonish Jane for disobeying me...as long as she was in the room, that was good with me. \"Have you checked our patient yet, Mrs. Humphries?\" Dr. Knight asked getting right down to the business. \"I only arrived here myself not 10 minutes ago sir. I haven't had the chance to. And I knew you were on your way so I thought it might be best to leave it to you as I'm sure that you would like to know for yourself how far along she is.\" \"Thank you Mrs. Humphries, you thought correctly. I do wish to check for myself.\" Dr. Knight now turned to me but I knew immediately that I had to leave the room. \"Now would be a good time for me to take the children over to my brother Anthony's.\" I informed them. \"I won't be long there, I will return as soon as possible.\" I went over to Jane and taking her hands in mine, I smiled at her and spoke in what I hoped was an encouraging tone. \"When we see each other next, there will be another little Lefroy to be welcomed in the family.\" Then I kissed her on the forehead, gave each of her hands a gentle squeeze, then left the room. Truth to be told, I hated leaving Jane. I really wished that I could be in the room with her. It would somehow make me feel better, but of course aside from a doctor, it is unheard of for any male to be in the same room with a woman who is giving birth, even if that man is her husband. I sighed as I descended the stairs and went in search of my sisters and children so that I could take them to my brother's as was pre-arranged. I would have to think of ways to keep myself occupied during the next several hours which suddenly loomed long and very empty before me. While my sisters Phoebe and Sarah were getting the children ready, Jane took me aside and said, \"I want to stay here with you father.\" I looked at Jane in surprise. I didn't know that this would be a good idea and I told her so. \"I do not think that would be wise Jane.\" I told her gently but firmly. \"Why not father?\" \"Because...child birthing is...is not easy. There is pain...and...\" I was flustered as I really didn't know how much I should tell her about this. After all, this was something that should be discussed with one of the women in the family and when she is a bit older, I thought. But more importantly...her own mother dying as a result of child birth. This was my biggest worry as far as Jane was concerned and her wanting to stay but I didn't know if I should even bring it up. \"I know. But I want to be here anyway. With you.\" she finished softly. The first thing I realized was that she said that she \"knew\". About child birthing? How was it that she knew? Then the rest of what she said sank in, \"I want to be here anyway. With you.\" Against my better judgement, my heart softened towards my daughter at these words. \"Are you sure?\" I asked her. I couldn't help but selfishly think that maybe it would help me to have her at home with me. And my sisters would also be here. Perhaps it would be alright. She nodded her head firmly while she replied, \"Yes, I am sure.\" I took several seconds to think about it before giving her my reply. \"Very well then. But please at least accompany me to take your brothers and sisters to your uncle's. The baby is still a fair ways off of making it's entrance and there is nothing that either of us can do here so we may as well be doing something.\" This she agreed to do and we were soon off. As I was feeling anxious about Jane, we didn't stay for long at my brother's place. So with a firm, \"I expect you children to behave yourselves and to help your aunt and uncle out. I will come and collect you as soon as I am able to.\" to my children and nods of affirmation them as well as a \"We will be fine, I'm sure.\" from Anthony's wife, Jane and myself were off for home. Jane: I wasn't so sure that I liked the invasive way in which Dr. Knight had to 'check' on how far along I was with the baby, but I tolerated it as I really wasn't in any position to argue the matter. And as Mrs. Humphries didn't seem horrified by it herself, I felt that it must be how it is done. Time kept moving forward and the pains seemed to be getting a little worse and would come at more regular intervals but they didn't seem to go beyond that. It was at the point when I was starting to get impatient and was just wanting it to be over with. Even Dr. Knight seemed to start looking a bit concerned that things didn't seem to be moving along fast enough for his liking so he said that he could help speed things up a bit. Unfortunately, this meant he had to get invasive with me again...but this time when he did...I felt it...the \"water\" that I had been worried about \"leaking\" out anywhere but \"where it was supposed to\". And to my surprise, it was more than just a 'leak'...but I had no time to think about it now as directly following this, I learned that my sister was right...I had been nowhere near being \"verfy far along\" in my birthing earlier on...that was nothing compared to what I was starting to feel now...\"Dear God,\" I prayed silently, admittedly starting to feel a bit afraid, \"Please help me...\" Tom: It was easy at first for Jane and myself to keep ourselves occupied, but as the time wore on throughout the day, it started becoming a bit more difficult. What was troubling me the most hours later was that I heard no sound coming from the room upstairs. Shouldn't Jane be in those latter stages of birthing by now? Surely Mary would have been at this point, even with Anthony? Of course that was 17 years ago now and being that he was our first born and it was a completely new experience for me...I was perhaps thinking or remembering wrong? Lunch had been a rather enjoyable meal with just the four of us and afterwards I even retreated to my office to do some work. But as time went on, I was starting to become a bit concerned. As there were only the four of us in the house, I felt that I could leave the door to my study open as it would be quiet enough. I wanted it open in hopes to start hearing more sounds coming from above... But as the afternoon crept towards tea time, it was still quiet upstairs...too quiet. I found myself no longer able to concentrate on work so I gave up and made my way to the staircase where I stood for several seconds just looking up towards our room. It took all of my will power to not just run up the stairs and demand to know what was happening. And when I finally moved, it was to pace around in the area of the staircase instead. \"Tom? Tea is ready.\" Phoebe suddenly was calling to me. I glanced one last time upwards before making my way back to the dining room and my seat at the table. I tried to eat, but I found that I could not. My mind was preoccupied with what...or perhaps more accurately, what was NOT happening. \"Father?\" Jane interrupted my thoughts. \"Yes?\" \"What is taking so long?\" I looked over at Jane and now noticed that she too had not been eating. For her sake, I had to shake off my own anxiety and not show my own fears to her. \"First babies always take a long time, Jane.\" I told her with what I hoped was a convincing tone and smile. \"And Mistress Jane is a bit older than most women are when they have their first children. Don't worry Jane, Dr. Knight is a good doctor.\" I added quickly and then in further hopes to show that I was not concerned, I started eating and hoped that she would too. She looked back at me and finally followed my example and began to eat. After tea, I once again retreated to my office but I didn't even try to work. I closed the door this time as it was worse listening to the silence. I just sat at my desk, unable to stop sad thoughts from entering my mind. I didn't think that I would ever be able to forgive myself if anything happened to Jane. It is true that in the end she made the final decision to \"let nature take it's course\" but it was my idea to begin with. And perhaps I should have been more discouraging about it...I closed my eyes and slumped forward on my desk, resting my head in my hands... I don't know how long I had been sitting like that for when I felt Jane's arms gently cradle my head in an embrace. I looked up her but couldn't think of anything to say. I was supposed to be strong for her...not show that I was worried... \"Dr. Knight will take care of Mistress Jane, father.\" she told me gently but firmly. It took me several seconds but I finally gave her a nod of my head and a small smile.[Chapter 32] I had full intentions of posting this chapter last week, but then \"everything\" had to happen at once. First, we had issues with our PC and connecting to the internet and then while we were getting sorted what to do about that, we had a family medical emergency in which we had to go away for a few days. But everything is in working order again. ;-D Also, this was going to be a longer chapter, but I thought it was getting to be too long, so I decided to end it where I did. The good news is that I am already almost done the next chapter so you shouldn't have to wait very long at all for the next one! -D Chapter 31: Jane: There is something wrong...I know there is. I know that giving birth is supposed to be painful but this is beyond painful...this...this is excruciating! This is death. And this is how I know that something is wrong. It can't be this painful! I must be sweating because I am vaguely aware of my sister gently patting my face with a cool, damp cloth from time to time. My body is shaking. And as much as I try, I cannot stifle my cries of anguish. Cries that I am sure become screams. \"Take my hands into yours Jane!\" I barely hear Cassandra tell me. \"Hold onto them and squeeze them as much as you can, whenever you feel the pain!\" I am not sure that I actually do what Cassandra tells me to do, but I know I try to. Finally, I am ready to give up. I can no longer do this. It is too much for me and I am too tired. I just want to go to sleep. But there is one thing that I want...one last thing. \"Cassandra!\" I rasp out in a hoarse voice. \"Cass...listen to me...I know...I know that I am dying...\" I see her brow pucker into a frown and shake her head at me. \"No...no Jane, you are not dying dearest...\" \"You needn't try and keep this from me, Cass!\" I breathe heavily just as another wave of pain racks my body. When it comes down enough I continue. \"I don't know how much time I have Cass...\" I'm borne away on pain once more...then continue once again. \"But I need for you to do me a favour! I need to see Tom!\" Followed by more pain along with tears this time. \"Please! You must get Tom and bring him to me!\" I have to pause once more as the pain continues to rip through my body. \"Please Cass! I want to be able to say goodbye to him..\" I barely manage to get the last words out. The next wave seems to last longer and I feel like I am on the verge of fainting or perhaps something much worse, but I am determined to keep myself alive until I see Tom. \"Please...Cassandra...for me...\" I whisper in a shaky voice. I see her turn to towards the doctor whom, even though my sight is a bit out of focus, I see nod his head at her, only once. And then she is gone... Mrs. Humphries quickly takes her place and pats my face with the damp, cool cloth and takes my hands into hers. But she also did something different. Every time I feel the pain, she places something...I'm not sure what..it was made of some sort of material I thought, and tells me \"Bite down on this whenever you feel the pain and push while doing so!\" Then she went on. \"Now what is this nonsense about you dying?\" She says in what I thought was a rather brusque manner. \"You are doing no such thing except having a baby.\" But I knew better although I had not the energy to argue with her. It was at that moment that I had a thought that was so crystal clear that I understood. Of course Mrs. Humphries was going to tell me that. They need me to stay alive so that I could deliver this child. In this moment I recall telling Tom that I did not want to leave him with a newborn baby. But now my maternal instincts kick in and even though I would not be around, I would fight for this child of Tom's to live. He loves this child after all. And he or she would have a loving home with a loving father and be surrounded by loving siblings. Tom would have the help of his sisters. And mine. As I am certain that Cassandra would not leave...at least not so soon... Now that my mind was made up, I was determined that this baby should live, even if I would not be able to watch it grow up. The thought saddened me, but Tom also loves this child and the thought of this Lefroy child being welcomed and brought up in the Thomas Lefroy household cheered me to the point of me being determined enough to bring it into this world as it will be the last thing I will be able to do for it... Tom: \"What is that?\" Jane suddenly said, breaking away from me, her brow puckering slightly. \"What is what?\" I asked, puzzled. She cocked her head slightly. Then, \"That! Don't you hear it?\" More alert now, I listened as well. Then I heard it...was it? Could it be? I fairly ran from my office and towards the staircase with Jane following closely behind and calling after me. \"Father! What is it?\" I didn't answer her straight away as I wanted to be sure for myself. But by the time I reached the staircase, I was no longer in doubt. With a smile of genuine relief on my face I said. \"It is Mistress Jane giving birth!\" Jane looked confused and said, \"But she sounds like she is in a lot of pain...\" \"Yes...she would be love. I did tell you that there is a lot of pain with childbirth.\" \"But how can you be so happy about it father? It sounds like it must be dreadful!\" \"I know it does, yes. I know that this will sound odd Jane, but hearing Mistress Jane in pain is a better sign than the silence we heard for the better part of the day. It means that the baby should be born soon and then the pain will end for Mistress Jane.\" It also means that Jane is alive, I told myself, but dared not speak these words aloud to Jane. I noticed that Jane still did not look entirely convinced so I told her gently, \"This is perfectly normal dearest. More normal than the earlier silence. It was the same with your own mother Jane, with each of you children. And the first child is usually the hardest and takes the longest. But it should be ending soon now.\" \"I do believe you, father, I just don't like hearing her.\" \"Which is why children are always sent away when a baby is being born. So they aren't frightened by the sounds of the pain of birth coming from their mother. \" Jane nodded her understanding at this so I continued. \"I don't like it either, but knowing the circumstances and that this is perfectly normal...and having been through it with your mother several times, I have come to expect it. Besides...it would be worse for me to be away from the house during this time, than hearing her anguished cries as strange as I am sure you must find this to be.\" \"Of course. I do understand you wanting to be near.\" I embraced my daughter and as I was much relieved, I decided to ask if she wished to engage in a game of cards with myself and her aunts. Surprised by this request, her eyes brightened and she readily agreed. My sisters agreed, also happy of the distraction and we four gathered in one of the drawing rooms where cards were always played. There was some debate as to which game we would play while I was looking for the cards, but once I had found them and shuffled them, the matter had been decided. We played a couple of rounds of one game and were about half way through another round of a different game when Cassandra flew into the room looking weary but anxious. Immediately, I stood up. \"The baby has been born!\" I exclaimed, happy, delighted and relieved all at once. But my hopes were instantly dashed when she slowly shook her head. \"No, but Jane calls for you Tom. She wishes you to be with her.\" This stunned me as I had not expected such a thing. I frowned, momentarily unable to register this in my brain. Cassandra now came over to me and the next words she spoke made my heart turn to lead and drop down into the very pit of my stomach. Speaking in a very low voice as I was the only one who was meant to hear these words, she said, \"Jane believes that she is dying, Tom...\" I looked at her in shock. Unable to form the question I wanted to ask, Cassandra went on, \"The doctor told me that you should come.\" Swallowing hard, I mechanically started following Cassandra. \"What is it? What has happened to Mistress Jane?\" It was Jane who had cried out. We both stopped and turned towards the other three, my sisters also looking askance. Cassandra and myself looked at one another before Cassandra replied, \"Mistress Jane is frightened, dearest. She has never given birth before and is somewhat afraid of what is happening to her. She has asked for your father to be with her and the doctor has agreed.\" Jane nodded but said nothing, as did my sisters. We left the room then and reaching the stairs I ascended two at a time and then ran down the hall towards our room where Jane was and entered without knocking, knowing full well that would not be expected of me in this situation. At once I saw one reason why men who weren't doctors weren't permitted to be in the same room with a woman giving birth, just by noticing the position of Jane on the birthing bed. It was hardly a position that a woman would wish to be seen in by a man...except perhaps if he were a doctor. I quickly averted my look to Jane's face and raced towards her, not taking my eyes off of it. \"Jane! Jane dearest, I'm here!\" I sat down on the bed and cupped her damp face with my hands. Through what I took to be tears which was mixed with perspiration on her face, she opened her eyes and smiled faintly up at me. \"Tom...\" she said barely audible. \"You came...\" \"Of course I did, my love.\" \"Tom...you may as well know that I am dying, but I promise that I will live long enough for this child to be born...but understand that I have begun to get so tired...so very tired...\" \"No Jane, no. You are NOT dying. You hear me? I promised that I would get you through this and I won't go back on my promise! I won't let you!\" \"But I'm so tired Tom...and it hurts...too much! There is something wrong, I know there is! I can't do this anymore...it's too much for me...\" She had been weeping quietly when she started talking but was fading by the end of her sentence. \"Jane? Jane! Stay with me!\" I begged her, my own tears starting to form. Just then she had a moment of the pain that we had been hearing from her for awhile. \"I can't do this anymore Tom!\" She repeated, crying in her anguish. \"Yes, you can Jane! You can! I know you can!\" I looked at the doctor who nodded his approval of my encouraging her which gave me an idea which I hoped would help Jane. Turning back to Jane, I said. \"Listen to me Jane. ...do you love me?\" \"Of course I do...\" \"And I love you, very much. And I believe in you and me. I believe in us. Do you believe in us, Jane? If you do, then say it. Say the words. Say it with me, I believe in us, I believe in us!\" I could see that she was trying...or trying to say something. I continued. \"Say it Jane! You can do it! I know you can! Say it with me! I believe in us!\" I kept repeating this while she went through another painful session. \"I...believe...\" it came out in a whisper at first but by the time the pain had intensified, she had become louder. \"I believe...I believe...I BELIEVE! IN US!\" \"Yes Jane! That's it! You can do this too! I know you can!\" It was just at this moment when I noticed that the doctor had come over to where I was and motioned that he needed to speak with me. Once again, my heart turned to lead as all of the worst thoughts entered my mind. I allowed Mrs. Humphries to take over for me for the moment. \"Something is wrong...\" I stated with fear in my heart. Dr. Knight nodded. \"It's Jane...\" I added barely able to say it. Jane had been right... \"It's the baby. Mrs. Lefroy has been in labour for too long and I fear that the baby will not be able to survive much longer. Mrs. Lefroy is exhausted and much too weak to be able to push the baby out naturally.\" It was not Jane but the baby...although I was relieved about Jane, I of course felt sad about the baby. \"However, I might be able to help get the baby out, but I will need to make a little bit of an incision. \"Cut?\" I asked not really liking the sounds of it. \"You need to cut Jane?\" Dr. Knight nodded. \"Just a little bit. Just enough. She will also need to be stitched up after she has cleaned. As soon as the baby is born, Mrs. Humphries can take care of the baby and I will immediately clean Mrs. Lefroy and stitch her. I will put her under so she doesn't feel anything. She won't need too much as she is already so exhausted. And she should start nursing as soon as she can anyway. But time is of the essence now. I must act now in order to get the baby out. The quicker and sooner, the better.\" I nodded my head numbly, giving the doctor my approval. \"Tom!\" I heard Jane cry out to me. \"Where are you?\" I quickly went back to Jane and took her hands into my own. \"I m here my love. I m right here. I promise.\" \"Don't leave me, Tom...promise you won't leave me...\" Jane said as she began to go under. \"I'll be right here with you Jane when you wake up.\" Even after Jane was put under, I stayed where I was, with Jane and continued to hold her hands, cup her face and caress her cheeks from time to time. In one sense, it seemed like a long time but in another sense it only seemed like minutes when I heard it. A small cry of a baby. I closed my eyes and rested them against Jane's hands which I was still holding and gave thanks to the Lord.[Chapter 33] Chapter 32 Tom: \"It's a girl, Mr. Lefroy! And with a good set of lungs on her already!\" Mrs. Humphries announced gaily. Little Cassie, I thought to myself. I thought it rather interesting how at the moment of hearing that the baby was a girl, that my mind drifted back to when Anthony was first born and I had hoped for a girl...and then when Jane was born how ecstatic I was to finally have my daughter...and now...here I was 19 years later, in the same room with Jane while she gave birth to our daughter. It didn't matter to me whether we had a boy or a girl. I already had four boys. And now, I had four girls. I was thrilled no matter what. \"And Jane? How is she?\" I now ventured to look towards the Dr. Knight who was still working on Jane while I asked my question. \"I think she should be alright, Mr. Lefroy. I am being very meticulous and careful, making sure that I do not miss a thing.\" My relief was immense. \"I would like to go and inform my family of the blessed news. And I would like to bring my children back home as well. I promised that I would be here for Jane when she awoke. Do you think I have time to get them?\" \"How long will it take you?\" Dr. Knight asked me. \"I can make it in less than an hour. I will be as quick as I possibly can.\" \"Then you have time. By all means, do go.\" The doctor smiled at me. Before I stood up, I kissed Jane on the forehead and whispered my promise of being there when she awoke. \"Do you wish to have a look at your daughter before you leave Mr. Lefroy?\" Mrs. Humphries asked me. She had cleaned the baby and had just finished swaddling her in some blankets. \"Of course..\" I replied gently. I walked over to where she stood with the baby. \"Oh!\" Was my initial reaction when I looked at her for to me, she looked just like Jane. \"She's beautiful...\" I whispered. \"Isn't she though?\" Mrs. Humphries gushed. \"She really is lovely Tom..\" Cassandra added happily, also looking quite relieved that the whole ordeal was over with. \"I must tell my family.\" I now said with a smile on my face. \"I will return as soon as I can.\" And with that I left the room, ran down the stairs and sought out Jane and my sisters who were all sitting in one of the drawing rooms. \"It's a girl!\" I practically burst with pride. \"And she looks just like Mistress Jane!\" I couldn't help but add. The three had stood up as I entered the room. \"And what about Mistress Jane?\" My daughter asked cautiously. \"The doctor says that she should be fine. She was exhausted and he needed to do a little minor surgery on her to help get the baby out, but they are both doing fine.\" Suddenly with this announcement, I felt overwhelmed with everything myself as I had gone through a lot of emotions throughout the course of the day and I found that I could not hold back my own tears. My hands went to my face as Jane came over to me and embraced me and I noticed, wept with me. But they were tears of happiness on both of our parts. Then both Phoebe and Sarah came over and joined us as well. After several minutes, I got myself together and explained that I was going to collect the children and bring them home and Jane offered to go with me. As I had promised Jane that I would be there when she awoke, we only stopped long enough at Anthony s to give the news and pick up the children, then we were on our way back home again. \"Can we see the baby when we get home, Father?\" Anne asked eagerly along the way. \"Not tonight, love. It is late and Mistress Jane is exhausted with giving birth. I promise that you will see her tomorrow for a few minutes. But once we are home, you are to go VERY quietly up to your rooms and make yourselves ready for bed.\" \"Alright, Father.\" Anne replied a bit deflated by my answer. Back at home, I left my children in the care of their aunts and hurried back upstairs to find that Jane had been moved onto our bed and the birthing bed already dismantled. I also saw that Dr. Knight had finished his work with Jane and Jane herself was still asleep. Both Mrs. Humphries and Cassandra were still in the room, attending the baby. \"I believe that it went well.\" Dr. Knight came over and told me as soon as he saw me. \"I did everything exactly how I wanted to and there weren t any complications. However, if you have a spare settee, I will remain here over night and keep checking on Mrs. Lefroy to make sure that she does not catch infection from the surgery. And I will come on a daily basis and keep checking on her until I am satisfied with her healing process.\" \"We have a plenty of room, you needn t use a settee. And your undivided attention towards Jane is more than greatly appreciated.\" I assured him, shaking his hand, feeling more and more relieved with each of his words. I showed him to one of the spare rooms and then returned to my own bedroom. As Mrs. Humphries and Cassandra were still in there, I sat down in one of the chairs and collected my thoughts. Now that it was over with, I couldn't help but think about being in the same room with Jane while she was giving birth. Even though it had been rather worrisome to have to see Jane go through all she did, I would not have missed being in there for the birth of our daughter for anything. I almost wished that I had been in with Mary for all of my children. All of this made me wonder if there would ever come a time when fathers would be allowed in the room with their wives while they were giving birth. Then I smiled to myself. Probably not. At least it most likely would not be something that would happen for quite a some time. Maybe in the future one day. I thought I was very lucky indeed to have been a part of it. Jane: I awoke feeling rather groggy and...quite sore, I realized. The soreness confirmed one thing...I hadn't died after all. And then my eyes settled on the one sight I had hoped to see. A most beautiful sight...Tom holding an infant. Our baby, my mind acknowledged. \"Hello, dear little one.\" I heard Tom speaking in a gentle tone to the baby, which warmed my heart and made me smile. \"Welcome to the Lefroy family.\" I must have made some sort of noise for Tom looked over at me, smiled and then came over. \"Meet your daughter Jane...our daughter.\" He said softly and then sitting on the bed he held her out so that I could see her. Just looking at her filled my heart to the brim. \"She's beautiful...\" I whispered. \"She is...and I think she looks just like her mother.\" Tom smiled, so happy and proud. \"Oh you must be mistaken surely, then.\" I managed to smile still feeling weak. \"I am sure that I am not.\" Tom smiled back. Then looking at our little Cassie, continued, still smiling \"May you be as strong, spirited, independent and stubborn as your mother. Every reason I fell in love with her. For only a man who admires you for these qualities will be worthy of you.\" Then he kissed her forehead. Not to be outdone , I added, \"And may you be as sweet, gentle, compassionate, loving and understanding as your father.\" With this, Tom leaned towards me and kissed my forehead. \"Now that our new mother is awake, it would be a good time to get this little babe taken care of by her mother.\" Mrs. Humphries now said. \"Then I should go and let you do so, but I will be back in a little while.\" Tom said, then with a last smile and kiss, he gave the baby up to Cassandra while Mrs. Humphries sat me up. I moaned with the pain of after birth and realized something in that moment. I may have despised the idea of having to be confined after giving birth, but considering how sore I felt, I knew now that I wouldn t want to be going anywhere too soon after all. Of course I do hope that my body will recover quickly so that I can get back to doing all that I love doing and being active again, but until then, I feel quite content to be expected to stay put. Later on, after Tom was ready for bed, he leaned over the infant cradle that the other Lefroy children had had when they were born, that sat on the floor on my side of the bed and gently stroked little Cassie s sleeping head. Without warning, the tears started to fall down my face. When Tom noticed, he asked me with a face full of concern if I was alright. \"I couldn t help thinking of my mother.\" I admitted. \"You wish she was here?\" \"No! Not that...it s just that...as soon as we were weaned, our mother sent each of us away until we reached what she called, a civilized age. Civilized! We were children!\" I noticed Tom frowning slightly in puzzlement when I said this. I continued. \"As I was the second youngest, I would only know about this happening with my youngest brother Charles, but being young myself, I didn t question it of course, believing it to be quite normal. However, in later years, Cassandra and I talked more about it. And now, looking at little Cassie...I just cannot understand my mother doing this to us when we were so young! How could she so easily give us up for 2 or 3 years? I did not go back home until my brother Charles was born and he was born four years after myself! Did she not love us? I could never do that to Cassie!\" I now wept more and Tom embraced me, letting me cry it out. \"Oh my love...I m sure that your mother did love you. You did say that she had married beneath her, so she came from a wealthier family where perhaps in her own family situation, they had hired help for herself and her own siblings. But in your own family situation, she knew that she couldn t afford to hire help so instead, sent you away for a little while.\" \"You are always so good about defending my mother Tom. But even if I were in that situation, I would not, could not send my children away from home like that! And for a few years too! It is not right!\" I continued to berate my mother and her method of early child-rearing. \"I understand my dear, and I do agree with you. I could never have sent any of our children away for a few years either if we had not had money to hire someone to look after them either. That never would have been Mary s and my way. And it is not the way everyone does things, but perhaps it was right for your mother. After all, you all turned out to be a fine family.\" \"I suppose. But I have to admit that I have wondered if that was the reason why my mother and myself always seem to be at war with one another. Because perhaps I had always felt like she had abandoned me...or us and I resented her for that.\" Tom shook his head. \"Or maybe you are just too different from each other. OR...too much alike in some ways even. I do not know myself Jane, but you are each the way you are, your relationship is the way it is, for whatever the reasons are.\" \"I am not my mother. I won t abandon my daughter. And I never would.\" I said with feeling. \"I know you won t and I know you wouldn't.\" Tom assured me with a smile. \"Now, perhaps we should get us some sleep before our newest little member decides it is time to wake us up and have something to eat.\" I smiled back at Tom and let him help to settle me back down in our bed. I knew then, that everything would be alright. Dr. Knight came to examine me on a daily basis for awhile to make sure that I was not catching an infection from his minor surgery. At one point, he removed the stitching when he saw that I was healed enough. Even though it was only about a month after little Cassie was born, I was starting to get my usual restless feeling. I was not as sore as I had been, so I also knew that I was healing. One morning, when I could hardly stand it anymore, I cautiously swung my legs out of bed and stood up. Still cautiously, I moved my legs and started walking about the room. It felt so good to be up and about! I was hardly even sore anymore, I was delighted to know. I knew that Tom would feel that it was too soon for me to be up and about already so I kept this my secret and would only get up and walk about the room at certain times and of course when no one was around. But eventually, even this started becoming boring for me. One day I got up and walked over to the window. It was such a beautiful day out that I couldn't bear to be away from the window so I stayed there longer than I had meant to. \"JANE!\" Tom s voice came out of nowhere, causing me to jump out of my skin. \"What are you doing out of bed?\" \"Oh Tom! I m fine! It is just that I am so restless! I can hardly stand to be in bed anymore! And in all honesty, I feel better getting up and walking around. I really do.\" \"Jane...I just want you to be careful! You are still recovering and I don t want anything to happen to you.\" \"Tom...I just told you that I actually feel better walking around. Really, I do. Please...at least let me walk around the room a bit. I promise you I won t leave it just yet. It s just that I am so restless. I need to do something.\" \"How about your writing? I will bring your paper, pen and ink in here if you wish.\" Well, that was something anyway so I agreed. \"And tell Cassandra to come here too, please. I will want her to help me as she always does.\" Tom smiled and this time I caught that twinkle in his eyes as he nodded his head, then left the room to do this for me. I sighed, but had to resign myself to keeping confined for a bit longer. At least Tom had agreed to let me walk about the room and it was a good idea of his to bring my writing supplies to the room. That along with books that I had been reading would all help to pass the time. No matter how careful Tom thought I should still be, I knew that I was going to be fine. Everything was going to be fine from now on. Epilogue: I enter my writing room for the first time one morning since giving birth to Cassie to find it to be gloriously sun filled. While waiting for Cassandra to join me, I set Tom s and my daughter who is sleeping in her carry-cot on the floor beside my writing desk. Sometimes I still can t believe that I survived that one thing that I had dreaded so much and because of it, Tom and myself are still here together. I smile as I look out of the window at the sunny, green hills and sparkling water of the River Shannon. The sun meant an afternoon pic-nic out on our property, one of the traditions that Tom and Mary had started up and one that Tom and myself had agreed that we would keep up as long as the children were around...that along with the nightly reading. Tom had finally allowed me to start going downstairs every day for a little while now and today, I was finally going to be able to be outside with the family this afternoon, although for a little while longer, I would have to be content with sitting and taking care of Cassie while I watched even though my body was feeling fully recovered from giving birth. But after all Tom (and myself!) had been through with the birthing, I felt I could obey him for a little while yet. But soon...soon, my sister Cassandra would be minding her little name-sake while I participated with the family, until little Cassie needed me. My sister had already agreed with this. Right now, I sigh with contentment as I remember Tom saying the night he proposed to me that I belong here...I do. I belong here with Tom and his family. I belong here with all of them. And now with our Cassie, the family...OUR family! Our family was complete. I was home. And I was happy. And I know that Tom is happy as well for he tells me everyday in his own special way. THE END (OR perhaps it's just the beginning of more Lefroy Family adventures...;-D)[Chapter 34] AFTERWORD & ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS AFTERWORD One of the hardest things about writing for me is ending a story. I always fall so much in love with both the characters and the story that bringing it to a close is always so sad for me as well as hard. I would rather go on and on, but if I do, the story may never have an ending and I do not like having \"loose ends\" and leaving people-including myself!-hanging. And unfortunately, all good things must come to an end but I really enjoyed and loved bringing Tom and Jane back to life again and sharing my story of their \"reunion\" with you. One thing that helps me to end a story is by \"keeping it open\". In other words, if I come up with any new ideas for Tom, Jane and the Lefroy Family, I will most definitely share them with you right here in Fan Fiction because there could very well be some adventures to write about regarding the Lefroys. But this was as far as I had intended to go with them for now, with all of the Lefroy Family being healthy and happy. When I first came up with my \"Becoming Jane\" story and started writing it, I had planned on keeping it as close to reality as possible right down to her death. I wasn't even going to have them get married and I certainly did not even dream of them having a child together at the beginning. But then as I continued to write about them, I found myself getting too attached to them (as I always do). And because I am such a sap, I realized that it would be too hard for me to write or maybe I should say, RE-write a sad ending. Plus, why should I re-write their sad ending when I really don't have to? Why not go for it and give them a happy ending...or beginning as I prefer to think of it, as this is FANTASY and FICTION after all! So why NOT give Tom and Jane the life in fantasy/fiction that they never could, never would (but SHOULD in my opinion) have in reality. It was the least I (felt) I could do for them, especially as I had brought them as far as I had with their getting together for Christmas in Ireland. There were several different ways I could have gone with this story but I chose to go the way that I did. I could have written that Tom's children were un-accepting of Jane and his marriage to her, but I didn't wish to write it that way as this was to be mostly focused on Tom and Jane and their story of how I pictured them ending up together. There has been much speculation as to what Jane Austen really died from and because of that, I like to believe that there is definitely the possibility that had the circumstances been different, had she and Tom Lefroy really met later in her life as the movie \"Becoming Jane\" depicts, that perhaps her life could have been prolonged. For example, if her illness and death had been diet-related, maybe moving away to Ireland with Tom and therefore a change in her diet could have prevented her \"premature\" death. Or perhaps if she had fallen ill at Tom's place in Ireland, Tom's money could have provided her with the treatments, medicines, doctors or hospital care she needed in order to be cured of it. Sadly, we will never know if any of this could have prolonged her life. But I do like to believe that it was possible. According to the book \"Cassandra and Jane\" by Jill Pitkeathly written in 2004, Jane would mention Tom Lefroy to her sister Cassandra from time to time years after Tom and Jane parted ways. Some of what she would say to Cassandra OR write in letters to her sister about Tom makes me believe that she still was 'fond' of him. And according to Wikipedia, Tom Lefroy went to England to pay his respects when he learned of Jane's death. Maybe it's just wishful thinking on my part, but I like to believe that they both still had feelings for each other, even years later. No disrespect meant to the real Mrs. Tom Lefroy, Mary Paul Lefroy, but I also like to believe that Tom and Jane \"found each other\" again in spirit. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 1). The movie Becoming Jane-which of course without, this story would not, could not be possible. 2). The book \"Cassandra and Jane\" by Jill Pitkeathly (2004). From which I found invaluable information regarding the REAL Jane Austen, her life and her family and even tidbits about the era and incorporated as much as I could and as best as I could into my story. 3). Wikipedia-Mostly for the information on Tom Lefroy's family, both his siblings and his own children. 4). My own imagination. Where would a writer be without it? And of course I acknowledge the readers one last time. Thank you all once again for taking the time to stop by and read...and thanks to those of you who added me/my story to your Favourite Author/Favourite Story/Alerts Lists and to those for leaving reviews. Because all of you, you have made my first experience writing for Fan Fiction truly fun and positive. I have really enjoyed writing for the Fan Fiction site and look forward to writing more for you in the future. ;-D -Sue ","Summary":" Hello, as I have stated in my profile page, my story, \"Becoming Jane: A Love Lost and Found\" is a"},{"Movie":"Becoming Jane","Title":"I Remember Love","Author":"jakeline","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3906925","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I Remember Love A BecomingrnJane -story By:rnjakeline Summary: Thernstory begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have metrnagain.

Now theyrncame bubbling up to the surface again. Once again she beganrnquestioning her actions and choices of that dreadful day all thosernyears ago. The look on his face when she left, it had broken herrnheart. It was for the best, she had thought then. She had to be thernsensible one. But had it been the right decision? He was now married,rnhad been so for quite some time, and lived happily in Ireland with arnlarge family and had a fine law career. Life had been good to him.rnShe had been following his progress in secrecy. Not that her own lifernhad turned out bad. She led a small life, valuable but small. She wasrna rather successful author. Her latest novel had been published thernyear before and now she found it hard to remain anonymous. There hadrnbeen a time when she had doubted her writing abilities. It had been arnChristmas holiday many years ago, and a certain gentleman fromrnIreland had entered her home, taking her by storm and changed herrnlife forever. He had interrupted a social gathering in herrnhome. Bursting in late just as Jane had started reading a piecerndedicated to her sister Cassandra. His uncle of course introducedrnhim, but Thomas Lefroy had not even had the decency to apologize forrnthe intrusion. He just bowed and glanced around the room, feelingrnrather superior she imagined, but even then there had been a glimpsernof interest in his blue eyes as they landed on her for a short periodrnof time. Her heart skipped a beat. Piercing blue met dark hazel. As she finished herrnreading, she noticed that he had been sleeping! Oh, how that hadrnvexed her. That was not the end of it! She overheard him talk to JohnrnWarren about her reading. \"Well,rnexcessively charming, I thought,\" Mr. Warren said as he gave ThomasrnLefroy a cup of wine. \"Well,rnaccomplished enough, perhaps,\" returned Lefroy and continued: \"butrna metropolitan mind may be less susceptible to extended, juvenilernself-regard.\" Jane Austen, who unfortunately had heard all of it,rnhurried up to her room, ripping her papers to shreds and finallyrnthrowing them on the fire. Snobbish,rnself absorbed, disagreeable man! Shernthought to herself. Juvenilernself-regard, indeed! She sought throughrnher case of writings and diaries. Read through a few pieces, notrnreally sure what to look for and sighed. Well, it was obvious he didrnnot understand her irony at all. She did not need to concern herselfrnwith him. He was absolutely not worth the effort. Little had she known howrnthis Irish rogue would come to affect the rest of her life. -xxx- Hernhad not been expecting to see her there. Painful memories camernrushing back. He knew she had seen him, butrnhad still tried to make himself scarce after the concert, but alas,rnthere came her brother, Henry, rushing after him. \"Yournhave to come and say hello!\" Henry insisted. \"She has seen you;rnit is quite the polite thing to do.\" Thomas Lefroy found himselfrnand his daughter standing in front of Jane Austen and her cousinrnbefore long. \"Jane, an old friend. Laternas ever,\" said Henry. \"MadamernLe Comtesse, Miss Austen.\" Tom bowed, asrndid the ladies. \"Mr.rnLefroy,\" said Jane quietly, looking at him with sad hazel eyes,rneyes that had once beamed at him with warmth, happiness and most ofrnall with love. \"Pleasernallow me to introduce to you your most avid of admirers, my daughter,rnMiss Lefroy,\" said Tom and nodded towardsrnthe young lady by his side. \"MissrnAusten, what a pleasure to meet you. Will you read for us thisrnevening?\" asked his daughter innocently. \"Ah,rnwell, you see, my sister never reads. Otherwise, how else is shernsupposed to remain anonymous?\" Henry saidrnto her. \"But…\"rnMiss Lefroy started, but was interrupted by her father's warningrnvoice. \"Jane.\"rnThe look on Jane's face as he called his daughter Jane was hard tornbear. Shock, surprise and sorrow, all emotions played over herrndelicate face. \"Irnwill make an exception if my new friend wishes it,\" said JanernAusten after recovering from the surprise over the name he had chosenrnfor his eldest daughter. \"Come, sit by me,\"rnthe authoress said and took his daughter by the arm and walkedrntowards a sofa. Thomas Lefroy suddenly remembered another reading.rnMany years ago. A reading he had thought rather tedious. He had notrnknown her then. Not as he would come to know her over the weeks torncome. The first, and perhaps truest, love of his life. We were young and dreams were new And every word we said was true Any mountain we could climb You made me feel alive The first time in my life December 1795 Hernhad stumbled upon her in the forest the day after that dreadfulrnreading. He had been persuaded to take a walk rather than accompanyrnhis uncle for a shooting, since it seemed he knewrnnot how to handle a gun. It was a fine day but he did not quite seernthe beautiful simplicity of the greens around him. He was beating offrnbushes and stray greens with his cane. Then he caught a glimpse ofrnsomething blue down on the trail. It was the girl from the reading.rnMiss, Miss… what was her name? He could not for the life of himrnremember her name. \"Miss!\"rnhe called out. \"Miss!\" No response. \"Um... Miss!\" He hurriedrntowards her. \"Miss!\" He saw that she had noticed his struggles tornget her attention, but she seemed intended not to make this easy forrnhim. \"Miss! I…\" He took a wrong step and found himself on thernground. He got up as fast as he could and glanced towards her. Arnlittle smile seemed to play on her lips. Ah,rnat least she is amused! He thought tornhimself. \"Miss? Miss?\" Why cannot Irnremember her name? \"Miss…\" He wasrnclose to the trail now. \"MissrnAusten.\" Finally she turned to him. \"Mr.rnLefroy,\" said he and took off his hat and bowed. \"Yes,rnI know,\" returned Miss Austen with a curtsey, \"but I am alone.\"rnShe started walking again \"Exceptrnfor me.\" \"Exactly.\"rnShe continued walking away from him. \"Oh, come! What rules of conduct apply in this rural situation? Wernhave been introduced, have we not?\" he said and was now rightrnbehind her on the trail. \"What value is there in an introduction when yourncannot even remember my name?\" She turned to him and he realizedrnthat she was not impressed by him at all. \"Indeed, can barely stayrnawake in my presence.\" He began to wonder what rumours hadrnproceeded him. What have I done to makernher dislike me? He suspected that hisrnyoung cousin Lucy had been talking widely about his reputation. Lucyrnwas infatuated. But then again, that was not uncommon around him. Butrnwhy was not Miss Austen? \"Madam,\" he said and turned away fromrnher. \"These scruples must seem very provincial to a gentleman with suchrnelevated airs, but I do not devise these rules. I am merely obligedrnto obey them.\" She made a mocking curtsey and turned once againrnaway from him. \"I have been told there is much to see upon arnwalk but all I've detected so far is a general tendency to greenrnabove and brown below.\" He did not wantrnto let her off that easily. \"Yes, well, others have detected more. It is celebrated.\" Shernturned to him. \"There's even a book about Selborne Wood.\" \"Oh.\" He bowed again making her curtsey again,rnand she turned to leave him once more. \"A novel, perhaps?\" Shernstopped and turned. \"Novels?\" Her tonernof voice made him dread the continuation of a speech that wasrninevitable to come.\"Beingrnpoor, insipid things, read by mere women, even, God forbid, writtenrnby mere women?\" She was agitated. Whyrncan't I keep my mouth shut? Or do I want to be lectured? Why is shernfascinating me? He thought and then hernrealized why she did not like him. \"I see, we're talking of your reading,\" he said with a smirk.rnHe had touched a nerve. \"As if the writing of women did not display therngreatest powers of mind, knowledge of human nature, the liveliestrneffusions of wit and humour and the best-chosen language imaginable?\"rnshe blurted out and her eyes were shootingrnsparks, her cheeks reddening. Beautiful . \"Was I deficient in rapture?\" He found himselfrnenjoying the banter with her, this country girl with the dark eyes. \"In consciousness.\" \"It was…\" He walked towards her, tryingrnto think of what to say. He had to be honest. \"It wasrnaccomplished.\" She nodded, indignant, and turned from him again.rnThen hesitated, and turned back. \"It was ironic.\" She smiled at him and walked off. Wasrnit? He called after her: \"And you arernsure I've not offended you?\" \"Not at all,\" she cried back as she hurriedrndown the path away from him. Chuckling he turned and walked the otherrnway. It might be an interesting holidayrnafter all. -xxx- Yes, I remember love so beautiful Now I know my heart is breakable But I remember love, the true meaning of I remember, I remember – love April 1814 Now,rnthere she was again, back in his life. Hernhad not seen her since that day all those years ago when she left himrnat the inn. He knew how difficult a decision that must had been forrnher. And for him not to follow her and make her stay was the hardestrnthing he had ever done. Of course his life had turned out just as hisrnuncle, the judge, had wanted. He was successful in his career and hernhad fathered quite the family. He suddenly realized that his daughterrnhad been trying to tell him something. \"Papa?\"rnshe looked at him puzzled. She had not seen her father like thisrnbefore. \"Yes,rndear?\" He turned his blue eyes towards her. \"Irnjust wanted to thank you for introducing me to Miss Austen,\" saidrnshe. \"Itrnwas the least I could do. I know how you admire her work.\" \"Howrndo you know her?\" \"Irnknew the family a very long time ago,\" he answered in a voice thatrndid not invite to further discussion about their acquaintance. He wasrnnot yet prepared to answer questions about that time in his life evenrnthough it had been quite some time. He just was not sure of how hisrnfamily would react. How his wife in particular would react if shernknew his connection to Miss Jane Austen and that Christmas Holiday inrnHampshire. Hisrndaughter knew better than to press the subject. He would tell herrnabout his acquaintance to Jane Austen in due time. Her father had arnlook in his eyes that she had never before seen. He looked veryrndistant. She wondered what Jane Austen meant to him. He had said thatrnhe knew her family a long time ago, but how come he had not mentionedrnit to her before? He knew how she loved her novels and had read thernover and over. She wanted to know everything about the famousrnauthoress. There was something more to this, more than what herrnfather told her. She was quite determined to find out what he was notrntelling her. -TBC- Reviewsrnare most welcome![Chapter 2] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again.

Part 2: In which they ponder on their past Though the years have come and gone And by now we've both moved on I admit that there are nights When I wonder why Why we said goodbye April 1814 \"Fancy meeting Mr. Lefroy at the opera,\" said her brother Henry at breakfast the next day. \"I shall never forgive you for putting me in that situation,\" returned Jane. \"But, still I am glad to have met him and his daughter.\" Jane put on a brave face though her heart was aching and her head filled with bittersweet memories. Once again Thomas Lefroy had managed to turn her life upside down. \"And he named his daughter Jane,\" Henry said and winked at Jane. Henry still had his boyish charm and had never stopped jesting with his sister. He knew that his old friend had behaved very badly towards her and that her heart was still healing from it. \"Mmm,\" was all that Jane could offer as response. When she heard Tom call his daughter Jane at the opera she had been startled and her soul filled with sadness. That could have been her daughter. \"Henry, dearest,\" said his wife and put a hand over his when she saw that he wanted to continue on the subject. Eliza knew how this affected her poor cousin. Jane looked very pale, and did not seem to have slept much during the night. Jane had been lying awake most of the night thinking of things that happened the night before and of course what had happened almost twenty years before. She had been haunted by memories form the past. She had not allowed herself to reflect on it for quite some time now. Though their story was in some ways entwined in her novels, she would never admit that to anyone but herself. He had implied that her horizons needed to be widened and that was exactly what he had done. December 1795 She had been dreading the assembly ball. It was not that she did not like to dance but Jane knew that Mr. Wisley, Lady Gresham's nephew, had taken a keen interest in her and she supposed she would be obligated to at least one dance with him. She did not look forward to that. She had not the smallest interest of encourage him in his pursuit of her hand in marriage. He was wealthy for sure but Jane Austen was determined not marry for anything other than the deepest affection. No matter what her dear mamma said. When they arrived at the Basingstoke Assembly, Jane found herself looking for the arrogant Irish gentleman from the other day. There was something about him that intrigued her. The way he had spoken to her in the forest. He was a handsome man with piercing blue eyes that seemed to look straight into her soul. Too bad his manners did not match his looks. She found herself a bit disappointed when she did not see him anywhere. Mr. Wisley was there and his aunt. Jane shrugged at the sight of the two. She tried to hide from Mr. Wisley when she saw that he was moving towards them when the caller announced the next dance. \"May I have the honour?\" said her brother Henry and held out a hand towards their cousin Eliza de Feullide. \"How kind, cousin,\" replied Eliza with an inviting smile and took his hand and left Jane alone just as Mr. Wisley found his way to them. \"Miss Austen,\" he said with a bow. \"Mr. Wisley,\" Jane answered with a curtsey though her eyes wandered about the room in search for a way out. \"May I have the pleasure of this next dance?\" And since Jane could not find any way out of it she had no choice but to accept. Mr. Wisley was not a great dancer. She suspected he did his best, but it was not enough for her to enjoy it. They had not done many turns before he stepped on her foot by mistake. Jane cried out in pain and almost fell over. \"Oh! I am mortified. I practised, but it won't stick,\" cried Mr. Wisley, looking embarrassed and chocked. Jane tried to smile reassuringly as she glanced around the ball room. Her eyes suddenly landed on Mr. Lefroy who was standing with his cousin and aunt on the balcony above. He was looking down at her with a content smirk on his face. He seemed to find some pleasure in her misfortune. Jane clenched her teeth. Oh, no, Mr. Lefroy. I am not afraid of you! You will not have that satisfaction. I will not be intimidated by you! She turned to Mr. Wisley again with a forced smile and finished the dance. Jane went in search of her brother and cousin after the humiliating dance and found them upstairs at the same balcony where Mr. Lefroy had been standing. Henry, Eliza and Lucy Lefroy were looking down at the dancing crowd. \"Ah, sister,\" Henry said and turned to her. \"What do you make of Mr. Lefroy?\" asked her cousin as she saw Mr. Lefroy making his way through the dancing couples. \"We're honoured by his presence,\" returned Jane with a smirk. \"You think?\" Eliza looked at her with questioning eyes. \"He does, with his preening, prancing, Irish-cum-Bond-Street airs.\" Jane sipped on her wine. \"Jane,\" said her brother with a warning tone of voice, Mr. Lefroy was after all a friend of his. \"Well, I call it very high indeed, refusing to dance when there are so few gentlemen.\" She motioned her hand towards the amount of ladies in want of a partner. \"Henry, are all your friends so disagreeable?\" \"Jane,\" her brother tried to make her aware of the fact that the gentleman they were talking about was making his way towards them and was in earshot. \"Where exactly in Ireland does he come from, anyway?\" asked Jane. \"Limerick, Miss Austen,\" a voice came from behind her. Jane was startled and she turned with flushed cheeks towards Mr. Thomas Lefroy who was standing right behind her. He said: \"I would regard it as a mark of extreme favour if you would stoop to honour me with this next dance.\" With her brother and cousin giggling at her behind her she had no choice but to accept. \"Being the first to dance with me, madam, I feel it only fair to inform you that you carry the standard for Hampshire hospitality,\" he said as the music started. \"Ah, then your country reputation depends on my report,\" Jane answered. \"This, by the way, is called a country dance, after the French, contredanse, \" she returned next time their paths crossed, she felt the need to let him know that she was cultivated and educated. \"Not because it is exhibited at an uncouth rural assembly with glutinous pies, execrable Madeira and truly anarchic dancing.\" She found that the Irish rogue actually was quite the dancer, much to her surprise. His hand in hers sent tingling sensations up her arm, his scent as they twirled chest to chest. Keep your head straight, Jane , she said to herself. He is a most insufferable man. \"You judge the company severely, madam.\" \"I was describing what you'd be thinking.\" She had to remain unaffected by him. His dashing looks have no impact on me. \"Allow me to think for myself,\" returned he with a frown. \"Gives me leave to do the same, sir, and come to a different conclusion. Will you give so much to a woman?\" \"It must depend on the woman and what she thinks of me.\" \"But you are above being pleased.\" She was sure she had him figured out. \"And I think that you, miss, what was it?\" He was teasing her. \"Austen. Mr...?\" \"Lefroy. I think that you, Miss Austen, consider yourself a cut above the company.\" \"Me?\" She looked at him incredulously. \"You, ma'am, secretly.\" He smiled at her, bowed and left her puzzled. She tried to remain unaffected by him, but found herself once more standing up with him to dance, much to her family's surprise and Mr. Wisley and his aunt's dismay. \"How many times did you stand up with that gentleman, Jane?\" asked her mother as they were leaving for home. \"Was it twice?\" asked Lucy who envied Jane for dancing with her cousin. \"Twice would have been partial. Thrice would have been absolutely...\" her brother Henry begun. And Lucy continued: \"Flagrant.\" \"Careful, Jane, Lucy is right. Mr. Lefroy does have a reputation,\" Henry remarked. \"Presumably as the most disagreeable man I have ever met,\" said Jane and ended the discussion about her partiality towards Mr. Lefroy. She had no intentions on showing that she was finding him interesting. None what so ever. -xxx- Tom Lefroy had actually enjoyed himself despite the rural society. He realised that they were not impressed by his town manners. Miss Jane Austen especially seemed to dislike him. He supposed he had not been at his best behaviour towards her or anybody else for that matter. Judge Langlois had considered it as punishment for his young nephew's wild lifestyle and neglect of studies to make him go to his relations in Hampshire. Tom had been horrified. His relatives lived in the country! What good would come of being stuck in the country for a Christmas Holiday? Well, now he knew. A certain young dark eyed lady named Jane. Tom smiled to himself. Jane challenged him with her sharp tongue and witty intellect. He had been quick to judge her but then again so had she. He had heard her describing him as being up on high horses because he did dance though gentleman was scarce. Oh, you think you have me figured out, Miss Austen. But I will prove you wrong! April 1814 Looking back, he was rather thankful towards his uncle, Judge Langlois, for making him go to Hampshire that holiday, it had changed his life for the better. To his uncles satisfaction he had become a top student, but only after an unsuccessful attempt to make his uncle approve of him marrying a well educated lady with no fortune. He knew his daughter would eventually ask more questions about his connection with Jane Austen. Especially since he had not mentioned her to his family. He wondered how his wife would react to the news about her husband knowing one of her favourite authoresses. They had never talked about his time in Hampshire. She knew nothing about his relationship with Jane; then again, she knew almost nothing about his life prior to their engagement. She had never asked about his past. Maybe it was a self preservation thing, there are things a wife does not want to know about her husband. He wondered if she knew that there had been someone else in his life at the time of their engagement. She had never asked what he had done when he had gone to his relations in Hampshire just after their engagement or why the journey had ended so abruptly. He had to see Jane again before he went back to Ireland, just one last time and that would be the end of it. Just to explain, to remember and to be near her once more. A piece of his heart would always belong to her. -TBC- Reviews are most welcome![Chapter 3] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again.

Part 3: In which they think of what could have been ' Cause I remember love so beautiful Now I know my heart is breakable But I remember love, the true meaning of I remember, I remember - love April 1814 Jane was torn between the urge to see him again and the sensible side of her that said that she had to let him be. There was no use in her going to him again. He was not hers anymore. He had not been hers since she left him at the inn that day in May 1797. She wondered what would have happened if John Warren had not sent that letter to Judge Langlois. Had he given his consent then? She remembered that awful day when she sat outside his study at Cork Street. Tom had been asking for his uncle's consent to marry her, but just as he began his speech, his uncle had read a letter sent from Steventon. The judge was outraged and called Tom a 'love-sick whelp' and her a 'penniless little husband-hunter'. If the letter had not been sent, would the judge have found her eligible? Probably not. He had other plans for his nephew. He had made it quite clear, that Jane was in no way a suitable wife for Tom Lefroy. At that time they had not known who the sender was. Jane had found out after the almost elopement the year after. She had detested John Warren since that day and had not been able to stay for long in his presence. He had said it was because he had always loved her. John Warren had robbed her of her one chance of happiness. Jane had been devastated, but in time she had reconciled with her destiny: to put down in words how wonderful life could be with triumphant, happy endings and brilliant marriages. Her writing was the one thing that had improved. Meeting Tom again had made her think of an idea for a new novel. A couple who had been broken apart meet again ten years later... -xxx- Tom Lefroy pondered on what would have happened if he had stuck by her and gone against is uncle. How would they have lived? Jane's argument for not proceed with the elopement was that their love would destroy his family and destroy itself because of that. She could not have that on her conscience. Neither could he, and that was the major reason to why he did not make a harder effort to make her stay when she left the inn. He took a sheet of paper from the stack and began writing a letter. Dear Miss... \"Papa?\" His daughter came into his study. \"Are you working?\" \"No, dear, I am just writing a letter,\" he answered, put down his pen and turned his attention towards his daughter. \"I was considering a walk and was wondering if you would care to join me?\" \"That would be lovely,\" said he. He needed to clear his head that was filled with images of a Miss Jane Austen. Her sad dark eyes haunted him. He had noticed that her left hand was still without a ring. She never married . He followed his daughter outside, but still his mind was somewhere else. \"Papa?\" \"Hmm?\" \"Deep in thought again?\" asked his daughter with a faint smile. He had that distant look in his eyes again. \"I am sorry, I'm not very good company, am I?\" \"At the moment, no,\" smiled his daughter. \"I am terribly sorry, Jane,\" said he with an apologetic smile. \"So, what do you have planned for us this evening?\" \"We have been invited to dine with the Jefferson's.\" \"Splendid,\" her father said. \"Who were you writing to earlier?\" \"Oh… nobody.\" How could he tell his daughter he was writing to Jane Austen? A note asking her to allow him to visit. \"Is there any possibility for us to visit Jane Austen again, papa?\" Tom's heart skipped a beat at the sound of her name. Is she reading my mind? \"Why?\" He looked at her intensely. \"I just wanted to…\" \"Jane, we cannot impose on Miss Austen's privacy like that,\" Tom cut her off. \"But…\" \"No, Jane!\" he said more harshly than intended, he had to see her alone. Without anyone else around he could speak with her as they used to. \"I am sorry, sir,\" she said quietly. Her father had never been talking to her in that tone of voice. Something was not right between her father and Miss Austen. But what? What had happened that made him not want to see her? Why would he not tell her? -xxx- Jane wondered if his wife was with him in town. If she was she should have been with them at the opera, of course. Jane could not help but feel slightly hopeful. For once in her life she had to follow her heart in pursuit of her own happiness. Come what may! Mr. Tom Lefroy, I am yours, heart and soul. Jane felt like she was 20 again. \"Would you care for a walk, cousin?\" Eliza asked. \"Hmm?\" Jane looked up. \"You have been staring at the same page in that book for the last hour, cousin,\" Eliza remarked. \"Maybe a walk would do some good?\" \"Yes, you are right, Eliza. A walk would do fine.\" Jane rose. \"Is Tom in your thoughts again?\" \"I am afraid so.\" Jane blushed. \"I feel like… Oh, I do not know.\" Jane hesitated. Would Eliza approve of her meeting Tom again on her own? \"You still love him?\" It was more of a statement than a question. \"Is it that obvious? I just wish... I would so much... I would like to meet him again. Just to talk, to understand.\" \"I know, but is it wise?\" \"No, probably not.\" Jane looked miserable. \"I am a grown woman! I should not feel like a love-sick-puppy!\" Eliza put a hand on her arm. \"Come; let us take that walk.\" -xxx- \"Is not that Miss Austen over there?\" Jane Lefroy pointed towards two ladies on the other side of the road. Her father glanced over. \"I believe it is,\" he answered. His cheeks reddened and his eyes began to sparkle. Jane noticed it and wondered what it meant. Although she was young she was a clever girl. She was now certain there had been something between her father and the authoress in the past. She noted that Miss Austen and her sister in law had spotted them and was now discussing something. Miss Austen looked flushed and almost bewildered. They seemed to come to a conclusion and came walking towards her and her father. \"Mr. Lefroy, Miss Lefroy.\" The ladies curtseyed. \"Miss Austen, Madame le Comtesse.\" Her father bowed and Jane curtseyed. She was eager to talk to Miss Austen, but she bit her tongue not to. \"Enjoying the fine weather?\" \"Indeed,\" answered Eliza. Miss Austen remained silent. Jane studied Miss Austen and her father closely. Their eyes had locked in a gaze that said more than a thousand words. She had never seen her father look like that at her mother. He looked young again. She really needed to know what had happened. But who could she ask? Who would have the knowledge? Not her mother she was sure she knew nothing about her father's past with Miss Austen. Asking her father or Miss Austen themselves was out of the question. That only left Miss Austen's brother and his wife. But when was she ever going to have the opportunity to speak with them? And would they choose to answer her questions? -TBC-[Chapter 4] I Remember Love A BecomingrnJane -story By:rnjakeline Summary:rnThe story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom havernmet again.

I have tried and I cannot live this lie. What value will there be in life if wernare not together? \" Thernwords echoed in her head as she woke up the next day. The dream hadrnbeen so vivid. She had been back in the forest again, back with Tom,rnin his arms. She had just learned about his engagement. He had comernto offer an explanation in form of a letter, but ended up suggestingrnan elopement instead. She had agreed of course, she wanted to be with him. Nothing else mattered. Shernsighed. The walk the day before had not made her situation anyrneasier. He had been very attentive towards her, but still she knew hernwas married. She did not dare say anything of her feelings. Hisrndaughter was lovely as ever and very talkative. They had been invitedrnto dine with them and another family this evening, and Jane did not know whether to lookrnforward to it or not. She was still unsure whether his wife was withrnhim in London. The subject had not come up. They had talked aboutrneverything but their families and their past. -xxx- AsrnJane Lefroy hung up her father's coatrnafter their morning walk his pocket book fell out and a letter fellrnto the floor. The letter looked as if had been stacked in there forrnages. It had obviously never been read since the sealing wax wasrnstill intact. It was addressed to Miss Jane Austen, Steventon,rnHampshire. Jane gasped for air; the sender was her father. Janernquickly put the letter aside and the pocket-book in the coat againrnand hurried off. She did not dare show her father what she hadrnfound. She only hoped she would be able to put the letter back beforernhe noticed it was missing. Now all she had to do was open the letterrnwithout leaving a mark. She could not believe what she was about torndo. She needed to know the truth. She took a sharp knife and a candlernfrom the kitchen. She used the lit candle to warm up the waxrncarefully and ever so gently pry the seal open with the knife withoutrnit breaking even though the wax seal was old and hard. She thankedrnthe vast amounts of novels she had read. Aprilrn1797 , Ashe Myrnd earest Jane, Byrnnow the news of my engagement must have reached your ears. I ca nnotrnbegin to imagine how this affects you. We have not spoken since thatrnawful day in August last year. I behaved very ill indeed. I beg ofrnyou to forgive me. I knew not what to do. Irnwrite you this letter in an attempt to explain myself. I know it isrnnot enough when thinking of how I have behaved towards you. Please,rnJane, please forgive me! First; you know I am dependent on my uncle's money. If not for my own sakernthen for my family's sake. I am the eldest son and they are quiterndependent on me. I have to marry someone my uncle approves of. Myrnfamily cannot manage without my contribution. You have to understand. Secondly;rnI can never support you without my uncle's consent. He will cut mernoff and I will stand on my own. How will we live without money? Nowrnyou might scorn me for disposing of myself without affection, but Irnhave to for the sake of my family and their survival. How you mustrnthink of me. I, who mocked you for marrying without affection, is nowrnabout to do the same. No, not entirely without affection. She is arnsweet girl. You would like her if you were to meet her. Irnam to blame for the pain you now must feel. Oh, my dear Jane, I do not see any other way… Yours,rnaffectionate as ever, TomrnLefroy Therngirl he was mentioning was of course her mother. Jane Lefroy knew notrnwhat to think. What had happened since the letter had not reached itrnrecipient and still lay in her father's pocket-book? She had foundrnproof of her father's history with Miss Austen but now she knew notrnwhat to do with the knowledge. Her head was filled up with questions,rnbut who could she ask? How much of this did her mother know? Thernletter was dated after their engagement and clearly suggested thatrnher father had ended things with Miss Austen in favour of her mother.rnBut the letter had never been read by anyone else than herself.rnJane felt confused. Her parents had obviously married, but that wasrntwo years later. She had never heard of anything of why it was such arnlong engagement. This might be the reason why. She really needed tornspeak with someone. -xxx- JanernAusten took extra care when getting ready that night. She wanted tornlook her absolute best. If she was to meet Mrs. Thomas Lefroy shernwanted to look dashing while doing it. She pulled her hair back in arnstyle that she used to have when she was young. She had not worn herrnhair like that since her father died. It still suited her and madernher look younger than her 38 years. She tried to remain calm and notrnto be too excited. But the gaze she had shared with Tom yesterday hadrngiven her hope. Maybe he still felt something after all these years.rnShe was so happy to spend some time in his presence. \"Arernyou ready, sister?\" Henry asked as he entered her room. \"Yes,rnbrother, as ready as I ever will be!\" Her eyes were glittering andrnher cheeks were glowing. \"Yourrncarriage awaits milady,\" Henry made a mocking bow. She giggled arnlittle and followed him outside. -xxx- \"Everythingrnset for dinner?\" he asked his daughter as the clock drew nearerrnseven and their guest were about to arrive. \"Yes,rnpapa,\" answered she with a small smile. \"Are you looking forwardrnto tonight?\" she asked, still smiling. \"Yes,rnof course, to dine with friends is always a pleasure,\" said he andrnreturned the smile. He wondered what she was getting at. She wasrnlooking at him suspiciously and seemed to analyse his expression.rn\"Will you play for us tonight?\" \"If yournwish it.\" \"Ofrncourse, you do it so well,\" said he. \"Irnhave heard that Miss Austen is quite the musician.\" \"Shernwas. Why?\" \"Sherncould play for us,\" said his daughter. \"She is probably much morernproficient than me.\" \"Irnsuppose if you ask her she probably would.\" \"Oh,rnI would love to hear her play,\" cried his daughter. The doorbell rangrnand ended the discussion regarding Miss Austen's musicalrncapability. He wondered where his daughter was going with all thesernquestions regarding Jane. He was a bit worried. Theirrnguests arrived. The dinner was excellent.rnHis daughter had planned everything herself since her mother wasrnabsent. He was very proud of her. She was his guardian angel and hisrnfavourite. -xxx- Janernfound Tom Lefroy charming as ever. He had not changed. He was stillrnhandsome though with a more distinguished air, his hair was turningrngrey but his eyes were still radiant. Jane herself had grown quieterrnand did not say much. When his daughter asked her to play thernpianoforte she could not refuse. She enjoyed playing and singing andrnwas considered a proficient musician. \"Yournplay so well, Miss Austen,\" said Jane Lefroy as she had finished. \"Yournare too kind,\" replied Jane. \"I do not play as much these days.\" \"Myrnfather said you were very good. And he is always right.\" \"Didrnhe?\" Jane blushed a little and turned her dark eyes towards Tom.rnHer eyes sparkled. \"He is very kind.\" \"Didrnyou know my father well, Miss Austen?\" asked Miss Lefroyrninnocently. Jane's cheeks became redder. \"Wellrnenough, I suppose,\" she said after a few moments hesitation. \"Itrnwas a very long time ago and we were very young.\" \"Didrnyou meet my mother?\" \"No,rnI am sorry to say I did not. How is your mother? In good health Irnhope?\" It was hard to ask about her so called rival, but she knewrnshe had to. Miss Lefroy's questions were starting to bother her. \"Thernbest, ma'am,\" answered Miss Lefroy and smiled as if she knewrnsomething Jane did not. \"Andrnyour brothers and sisters?\" \"Ohrnthey are all well, thank you! All five of them.\" \"Whatrnare you two ladies talking about?\" Tom came and interrupted theirrndiscussion. \"Oh,rnnothing,\" answered his daughter lightly. \"Irnenquired of your family, Mr Lefroy,\" said Jane quietly and Tom'srnface darkened a little. \"I see,rnthey are all well as I am sure my daughter informed you.\" \"Yesrnshe did,\" answered Jane, and wondered why he sounded so defensive,rnas if he did not wish to speak of his family with her. Miss Lefroyrnlooked as if she wanted to say something, but kept quiet and movedrnover towards Mr Austen and his wife instead, leaving her and Tomrnalone by the pianoforte. \"Irntrust you have enjoyed your evening?\" asked he. \"Yes,rnthank you, very,\" she answered. -xxx- Janernwatched her father and Miss Austen intensely the evening through. Shernwas sure there still was some affection between them. Sherndeliberately left them by the pianoforte just to see how they behavedrnwhen left to themselves. Also she wanted to take the opportunity torntalk with Mr Austen and his wife about her father's relationshiprnwith Miss Austen. She began with Mrs Austen since Mr Austen wasrnplaying cards with the other couple in the company. \"Arernyou enjoying your evening, Madame le Comtesse?\" she used the samerntitle her father had. \"Please,rndo call me Eliza,\" she answered and smiled. \"And yes, it is arnsplendid evening.\" \"Irnbelieve you also knew my father from his time in Hampshire?\" saidrnJane. \"Yes,rnthat is true. A very long time ago,\" answered Eliza. \"He was arncharming young man.\" \"He isrnthe best father a girl could ever wish for.\" \"I amrnsure.\" \"Werernyou close?\" \"Notrnreally, no,\" answered Eliza evasively. \"We saw each other at somernsocial events. Your father was an excellent dancer.\" \"AndrnMiss Austen? Was she close to my father?\" Jane tried not to soundrntoo eager. She saw that Eliza had trouble finding an answer to herrnrather direct question about their relationship. \"Irnbelieve they shared the same passion for novels and used to discussrnthem intensely,\" she finally said. Arnclever woman, she does not say too much. \"Myrnfather is a great reader. He has read her novels, so have I and myrnmother on his recommendation.\" \"Irnam glad.\" Eliza looked uncertain as to how to handle herrnquestions. \"You ask a lot of questions.\" \"Paparnnever speaks of that time in his life. I just wanted to know morernabout him. And of course about Miss Austen.\" \"Irnsee,\" said Eliza with a small smile. \"MissrnAusten never married?\" \"No,\"rnshe said and then continued: \"Not because she was without offers,rnbut she was determined not to marry for anything but the deepestrnaffection. And that man never came.\" \"Irntoo would want to marry for love,\" said Jane. \"Lovernis wanted, but one cannot live on it,\" said Eliza quietly andrnglanced over at her father and Miss Austen who seemed deep inrnconversation. -TBC- Reviewsrnare most welcome[Chapter 5] I Remember Love A BecomingrnJane -story By:rnjakeline Summary:rnThe story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom havernmet again.

He realised how much their relationship andrnthe end of that relationship had wounded her. Her eyes were notrnglittering as they used to, it was as if a veil was shading them andrnhe could not read them as he used to. She looked so fragile andrnvulnerable. He felt a sudden urge to just fold her tightly in hisrnarms and tell her that everything would be alright. Hernwanted to talk to her about what had happened. Why she left him thatrnday at the inn. Why she did not give their love a proper chance. Deeprninside he knew why, but still, he wanted to hear the words from herrnlips. He wanted her to tell him that she had done it for him, for hisrnfamily. Arnhard knock on the front door interrupted his thoughts. Shortly arnservant entered with a letter on a silver tray. \"MrrnLefroy, sir,\" said he and bowed. Tom tookrnit and his face turned pale as he saw who the sender was. \"Papa,rnwhat is it?\" cried his daughter with a worried face. Tom waved herrnoff and opened the letter.

We must leave for Ireland at once!\" \"Ohrnpapa!\" cried his daughter. \"She will be alright, right?\" Shernlooked worriedly around in search for reassurance. \"Wernhave to leave at once, dear.\" Tom couldrnnot tell her something he did not know. He was worried. He turned tornthe rest of the company: \"I am sorry that this evening must come tornan end. And in this manner. Please accept my deepest apologies, but Irnmust rush to my wife's side.\" He looked at them with sorrowfulrneyes. When his eyes landed on Jane he tried to lock eye contact withrnher but she was examining her hands, unwilling to meet his gaze. \"Ofrncourse,\" mumbled Jane and the others. \"Fetchrnthe carriages,\" called Tom to a maid who happened to enter the roomrnjust then. The maid curtseyed and left again. \"Irnhope it is nothing serious,\" said Jane to Tom as they said theirrngoodbyes. \"Irnam afraid it is rather unknown at this point. The letter clearlyrnstated that she had taken very ill, indeed.\" \"Please,rnif you can spare the time, let me know how she is doing,\" Jane saidrnsilently. \"Irnthank you for your concern, Miss Austen. I will let you know as soonrnas I know anything.\" He squeezed her hand hard. \"MrrnLefroy, Miss Lefroy.\" Jane Austen, her brother and his wife leftrntogether with the other couple. -xxx- JanernAusten feared the worst when no letter came for two weeks after Tom'srnhasty departure. They were about to leave town the day after and shernhad just begun packing her trunks when a knock on the front doorrninterrupted her. Soon after her brother came to her room with arnletter in his hand. Jane shone up. \"Arnletter for you, sister,\" said he and handed it over. \"But notrnfrom whom you hope.\" Jane took the letter and as she turned it tornopen it she saw that the sender was Jane Lefroy. \"Arnword, at last,\" said she and tried to hide her disappointment thatrnthe sender was the daughter and not the father. The letter wasrnwritten in a beautiful hand, though a bit childish rounded letters. Limerick,rnMay 1814 DearrnMiss Austen, Irnam sorry for the late word, but my mother has been very ill indeed.rnMy father sends his apologies for not writing this letter himself. Hernhas hardly left my dear mamma's side since we arrived home. She isrnstill in a critical state and the doctors do not know what is makingrnher ill. They still fear for her life. I have been charged withrntaking care of everything else seeing as I am the eldest daughter. Itrnis hard on my younger siblings, but I try to stay happy and positivernin front of them. It pains me to see my father so distressed. I dornnot know what I would do if she left us. Our family would berndevastated. Irndo not how to ask you this delicately. But I need to know about yourrnpast with my father. You must think I am out of my place in askingrnyou this, but I hav e found somethingrnthat suggests that you were quite close to him once. I beg of you tornanswer truthfully even though it must seem awkward. I have to knowrnthe truth. My father is too preoccupied with my mother's illness tornbe bothered with my questions. And frankly, I do not trust him torntell me the truth. He is always so protective of me. It is ratherrntiresome sometimes. Someonerncomes; I must end this letter. I amrnwanted by my mother's side. I hope you will send me an answerrnshortly. Yoursrntruthfully, JanernLefroy Janernread the letter several times before actually understanding what MissrnLefroy was asking for. She frowned. Whatrnhas she found that points to my relationship with her father? Janernwas puzzled and unsure as to how to answer Miss Lefroy's ratherrnfrank question. Jane knew not what to do. She was truly sorry to hearrnthe bad news about Mrs Lefroy and even more sorry to hear about Tom'srndistress. The weight on his shoulders must be great indeed. Poor MissrnLefroy to be left to run the family on her own. She was so youngrnstill. No daughter should need to do that so early in life. Shouldrnshe answer Miss Lefroy's letter truthfully without consenting herrnfather? After dwelling on memories of from their past Jane decided tornask her cousin for advice. -xxx- \"Didrnyou send the letter to Miss Austen?\" her father asked a few daysrnafter she had sent the letter with post. \"Yes,rnpapa.\" \"Anyrnreply?\" Her father's voice sounded hopeful. He needed to think ofrnsomething other than his poor wife. \"Not asrnyet. But it takes a few days to reach her. I just hope she has notrnleft London.\" Her father smiled. \"I amrnglad that you like her.\" Jane looked at him with a puzzled smile.rnIt was almost s if he was asking for her approval of Miss Austen. \"Shernis a very kind person,\" she answered evasively. \"I do admirernher.\" She looked at him earnestly. \"Is mamma any better?\" \"Stillrnno improvement I am afraid,\" her father looked concerned. \"Jane,rnwe must consider the possibility…\" his voice was caught in hisrnthroat and his eyes filled with tears. He tried to blink the tearsrnaway, but in vain. A tear trickled down his cheek. She put a hand onrnhis arm. Her father suddenly looked so vulnerable and she felt likernas if she was the adult and he was the child. She wiped the tearrnaway. \"Please,rndo not say the words. Mamma will be fine!\" Jane put on a cheerfulrnface. \"Jane,rnwe have to be prepared if the worst happens.\" He took her handsrnbetween his. Jane did not want to listen to that speech. She rose. \"Irnneed some air,\" said she. Her father rose as to accompany her out.rn\"Alone.\" She looked at him with begging eyes. Irncannot talk about this now. I need to be alone. Tearsrnwere burning in her eyes and her vision was blurred. She had kept herrnfeelings locked inside for so long and they threatened to suffocaternher. She ran from the house to the nearby shrubbery where she knewrnshe was not going to be seen by anyone. Everybody was depending onrnher now that her mother was ill. A young girl can only take so much.rnWhen she was sure she all alone and nobody could see her she sank tornthe ground and buried her face in her hands and let her tears finallyrnflow free.

Her motherrnwas stirring; she had been falling in and out of consciousness forrnsome time now. Mrs Lefroy's eyelids fluttered and dark eyes, glossyrnfrom fever, tried to focus on Jane's face. \"How are you feelingrntoday, mamma?\" Jane asked anxiously. \"Oh,rnmy dear Jane,\" came the weak response. \"I dornbelieve I am feeling a bit better today.\" Jane helped her to a siprnof water. \"Paparnhad to leave for court,\" Jane told her mother. \"Ofrncourse…\" her mother looked weary from talking. \"I am sorry forrnputting you through all this.\" \"Hush,rndo not say that,\" said Jane and took her hand. \"Itrnis not your fault you are ill.\" \"I knowrnyou are strong, Jane, you have that after you father.\" Her motherrncoughed. \"But do not take all this upon yourself.\" Her motherrnlooked at her with worried eyes. \"I canrntake care of myself, mamma,\" replied Jane. \"Yes,rnthat is what I fear.

You have to believe thatrnyou can beat this!\" Jane's cheeks turned red with emotion. \"Irnwill not hear you speak like that! You shall conquer this! I willrnleave you now. You need to rest.\" Jane quitted her mother's roomrnin haste. She felt like she was the only one who believed her mammarnwould recover. If she does not thinkrnherself that she will recover, she never will. Janernregretted her heated outburst as soon as she came to her senses. Itrnwas just too much. She felt alone since her father had left. Shernregretted that she had been avoiding him since their last talk. Deeprninside she knew she had to prepare for the worst. She also had to bernstrong for her brothers and sisters who did not seem to understandrnthe full extent of their mother's illness. -xxx- JanernAusten sat by her writing table unable to write down one single wordrnon paper to Tom Lefroy. Writers block was something she seldom hadrnexperienced, if ever. But to write a letter to a former close friendrnand almost lover questioning his daughter's assumptions was not anrneasy task. Even for an authoress. Herrnthoughts wandered back through time, back to a time when she thoughtrnhe was the man she would spend the rest of her life with. Januaryrn1796 \"Irnhave learned of Mr. Wisley's marriage proposal. Myrncongratulations,\" he said as he found herrnby the pond to where she had escaped after being repremanded by LadyrnGresham. She turned to him with sad eyes. \"Isrnthere an alternative for a well-educated young woman of smallrnfortune?\" Jane asked hoping for Tom tornprovide her with a way out. \"Howrncan you have him? Even with his thousands and his houses, how canrnyou, of all people, dispose of yourself without affection?\"rnHe did not even look at her. His voice was cold. \"Howrncan I dispose of myself with it? You are leaving tomorrow.\"rnShe gazed at him, and then moved closer. Her blood rushed in herrnbody, he was so close. The emotions his presence woke in her was bothrnmaking her afraid and giving her courage to do something she hadrnalways wanted to. Jane leaned even closer and kissed him on the lips.rnHe was startled at first, but then eagerly kissed her back. His handsrncradled her face. They broke free and gazed at each other, bothrnastonished by her action. \"Did I do thatrnwell?\" She asked after a while. \"Very,rnvery well,\" answered Tom with a smile. Hernfondled her chin, not wanting to let the moment end, gazing deep inrnto her eyes. \"Irnwanted, just once, to do it well,\" saidrnJane. They were interrupted by some gentlemen coming towards thernpond. Tom took her hand and took her with him deeper into thernshadows. Hernsaid as he tugged her along: \"I havernno money, no property. I am entirely dependent upon that bizarre oldrnlunatic, my uncle. I cannot yet offer marriage. But you must knowrnwhat I feel. Jane, I'm yours. Gah, I'm yours, heart and soul.rnMuch good that is. Much good that is.\"rnJane could hardly believe what she was hearing. He felt the same. Hernloved her! Her heart sang with joy. \"Letrnme decide that,\" said she with a smilernand took his hands. The gentlemen by the pond seemed to be followingrnthem and they went even deeper into the shrubberies. \"Whatrnwill we do?\" Tom asked. \"Whatrnwe must,\" breathed Jane and kissed hisrnhand. Mayrn1814 Thernmemory of the kiss still made her blush. Her forwardness to dornsomething like that still astonished her. Shernhad believed that everything would end well. That his uncle wouldrnapprove of her, but he had not. Tears swelled in her dark hazel eyesrnby the memory, but she wiped them away irritatingly. Irnam a grown woman, for heaven's sake! I am not the foolish, naive girl I wasrnthen! She finally put the pen to thernpaper. Chawton,rnMay 1814 Myrndearest Tom, Itrnpains me to hear that your wife is still unwell. I hope by the timernof the arrival of this letter she will have recovered. Wernleft town a few days ago and are now back in our little cottage inrnChawton. We left as soon as my latest novel was published. Yourrndaughter's letter was lucky to still find me in town. I hope she isrnwell. I was a little surprised, and to be honest slightlyrndisappointed when she was the one who sent the letter and not you, MrrnLefroy. Is not that common courtesy among friends, to keep theirrnpromises to one another? Yourrndaughter asked me a rather blunt question. Irndo not know how to answer it, not without consulting you. Miss Lefroyrnseems to think she has found some evidence that point to us beingrnclose once. Now she begs for the truth from me. She does not thinkrnyou will tell her the truth. Irncannot for the life of me understand what she means. I have notrnwritten to you and as far as I know you never sent me any letters. Irndo not know how to answer her question. How do you tell the daughterrnof a man you once thought would be your husband that you were oncernalmost engaged to her father? Tell me, Mr Lefroy, what shall I do?rnWhat can she have found? Withrnthis letter I also send you my latest novel for your daughter. I hopernit will bring her some relief during this testing time in your lives.rnPlease send her my regards and let her know that I am praying for yournall. Yoursrnaffectionately, JanernAusten Shernconsidered signing it with 'Yours, asrnalways' , but quickly changed herrnmind. If the letter was read by the wrong eyes... Jane sighed and putrnthe pen down. There, it was done. She just hoped for him to answerrnher quickly. She reached for her novel MansfieldrnPark , and wrote a dedication for MissrnLefroy inside. To Miss Jane Lefroy, in arntime of need every heroine needs to dream herself away. Yoursrntruthfully, a Lady (JA). She sealed thernletter and wrapped it and the novel in paper and wrote the addressrncarefully. -TBC- Reviews are most welcome[Chapter 7] I Remember Love A BecomingrnJane -story By:rnjakeline Summary:rnThe story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom havernmet again.

Partrn7: In which the Lefroys starts tornface the facts Mayrn1814 Beingrnaway from his home for only a short time made Tom Lefroy even morerndistressed. But he had been away from thernBar too long, though he could do much from home, his reports had beenrndelayed as of late due to his wife's illness. The gentlemen aroundrnhim recognised his distress and sent him home as soon as it wasrnpossible. He was of no help to them in this state. Tomrnwas afraid of not being at home, should the worst happen. He wantedrnto be by his wife's side at all times. As he finally came home hernrushed inside hoping to find his wife fully recovered. But thernphysician greeted him instead. \"Irnam terribly sorry to tell you this, Mr Lefroy, but she is notrnimproving,\" said a distraught MrrnBarrington when he met Tom. \"I have done everything in my power torncure her. There is really nothing more I can do for your wife.\"rnThat was not what Tom had been expecting to hear.\"There isrnabsolutely nothing you can do for her?\" Tom looked hopefully at thernphysician. \"Irnam afraid it is just a matter of time now. She is rarely conscious,rnshe cannot rest calmly. But she has been asking for you, sir. Callingrnyour name time after time.\" It pained Tom to hear of his wife'srndistress. He wanted to run to her room immediately but hurriedrnfootsteps behind him made him hesitate. \"Ofrncourse,\" said Tom. He caught a glimpse of his daughter's hurriedrnfigure at the corner of his eye. She was hurrying away from them. \"Irnshall see her after I speak to my daughter.\" \"MightrnI add that we are truly blessed that none of the children has beenrninfected.\" The physician looked slightly relieved. \"Irnsuppose we are, Mr Barrington,\" replied Tom. \"Veryrnwell then, I will let Mrs Lefroy know that you will attend to herrnshortly,\" said Mr Barrington with a bow and hurried back to hisrnpatient's side. Tomrntried to catch up with his fleeing daughter. He suspected that shernhad overheard his discussion with Mr Barrington. He found her at lastrnhalf hidden in one of shrubberies outside. She was kneeling on therngreen grass with her head buried in her hands. Tom heard herrnsmothered sobs and his heart were struck with a pang of guilt. \"Myrndearest Jane,\" he whispered and kneeled beside her, stroking herrnhair out of her face. \"Oh,rnpapa!\" cried she and threw herself in his waiting embrace.rnHe held her tightly against his chest and gently rubbed her back. \"Isrnthere absolutely no hope for mamma's recovery?\" she murmuredrnagainst his chest. \"I amrnafraid the physician has done everything in his human power. It is inrnGod's hands now.\" \"Irnhave behaved so very ill,\" cried Jane. \"Irnam sure you have done nothing wrong, Jane,\" he assured her, unsurernas to what she was referring to. \"No,rnpapa, I have done something terribly wrong,\" she cried and lookedrnup into his blue eyes. \"I found something and I read it, though itrnwas not for me to read.\" \"Jane,rnwhat is it?\" Tom looked at his daughter with puzzled eyes. Whatrnon earth is she talking about? My sweet Jane has never done anythingrnwrong in her life. \"I toornashamed to tell you, papa.\" Jane looked down at her entwined hands.rnTom could see that she was truly distressed. \"Whatrnever it is I am sure it is not as bad asrnyou think it is, Jane.\" \"Oh,rnbut it is bad indeed, papa!\" Jane hid her face in her hands again.rnHer cheeks were turning red with shame. \"Wouldrnnot you feel better if you just told me what it is, Jane?\" he askedrnand took her cheek in his hand and forced her to look at him. \"Irncannot, papa,\" cried Jane with tearsrnflowing down her cheeks. \"I have been a very wicked daughterrnindeed.\" She rose and ran off before Tom could stop her. What onrnearth was she talking about? Jane was a most obliging girl and neverrndid any harm or mischief. -xxx- Inrnher room Jane Lefroy was pacing around, anxious. She had to tell herrnfather, she realised that. She wanted him to hear it from her and notrnfrom Miss Austen. She had no hopes in Miss Austen's secrecy. Janerncould not ask that of her, and she had not urged her to keep thernmatter to herself either. But how would it look? She had been pryingrnaround among his personal belongings. She was so ashamed of what shernhad done. Her curiosity had driven her too far that time when shernfound the letter. Why had not she just put it back in his coat andrnforgotten about it? Janerncould not forget how altered in spirit her father had been when theyrnwere abroad. Now he looked rather unwell, of course due to herrnmother's illness, Jane realised that, but still the way he was whenrnin London, that was a side of him she had never before seen. Janerncould not help but think that he had behaved so differently in Londonrnthan she was used to at home. Especially around a certain authoress,rnshe must admit. A quietrnknock on her door brought her back to her senses. She wiped her wetrncheeks and tried to look as happy as she could. \"Yes?\"rnShe called and one of the maids entered. \"MrsrnLefroy wishes to see you, Miss,\" said she with a curtsey. \"Thankrnyou, Millie, I shall be there shortly.\" She checked her face in herrnmirror before she left her room. She didn't want any signs of tearsrnto be showing when seeing her mother. She went to her mother's roomrnand found her whole family gathered by her mother's bed. Shernglanced anxiously at her father to see if something was amiss. But hernjust looked deep in thought and very grave indeed. Her mother wasrnstirring in the bed and looked even paler than she had done the dayrnbefore. Jane smiled faintly at her as she sat down on her bed andrntook the damp cloth to pat her forehead with. \"Oh,rndear me, you are all here,\" her mother whispered when seeing herrnwhole family gathered around her bed. Sherntried to sit up against the head of the bed, but was too weak to bernable to do it without help. Jane and her father helped her to sit uprnand propped the pillows up behind her mother's back. \"Yes,rnmy dear,\" said her father and sat down on the other side of the bedrnand took her hand. \"We are all here as requested by you, dearrnMary.\" The younger children climbed up in the bed to hear whatrntheir mother was going to say. \"Irnwant you all to listen very carefully,\" said Mrs Lefroy quietly. \"Irnam going to be honest with all of you. You all know that I am veryrnill.\" She paused and was overpowered by a coughing spell. Janernhelped her to take a sip of water and the wiped her damp forehead. \"Dornnot exert yourself, you need every strength to recover,\" criedrnJane. \"Thernphysician tells me it is only a matter of time, my dear Jane, it isrnall in God's hands now,\" her mother whispered. The youngestrnchildren started whimpering and weeping. Jane herself found it hardrnnot to cry, but remained composed though tears formed in her eyes andrnslowly ran down her cheeks. Her father held her mother's hand andrnlooked down on her with great pain written on his face. It dawned onrnJane; she was probably going to be motherless very soon. -xxx- \"Arnpackage for you, sir,\" a servant said as Tom went past the frontrndoor. \"I just picked it up at the post, sir.\" \"Thankrnyou, Jones,\" answered Tom and took the parcel. He recognised thernhandwriting as Jane Austen's and wondered a bit about the parcel.rnHe retired to his study before opening it. It included her latestrnnovel and a letter addressed to him. He opened the novel and found anrninscription for Jane in it so he set it aside. He could read it afterrnshe was done with it. Tom opened the letter and read it with growingrnanxiety and utter astonishment. Was this the wickedness his daughterrnhad mentioned when he came home from town? He as well as Miss Austenrnwondered what she had meant. He suddenly realised what Jane must havernmeant, and went to fetch his pocket-book. The letter looked as itrnalways had. It did not seem to have been tampered with and unread asrnalways. He had to speak with his daughter about all this. Thernpast had caught up with him and in all his worry about his wife'srncondition warm, loving feelings towards the authoress overpowered himrnmomentarily. The way she had refused him at the inn… May,rn1797 Thernpost had stopped for refreshments and watering of the horses. Tomrnseated Jane at a table by a window and went to fetch drinks. Theyrnwere going to be man and wife very soon. His heart was filled withrnjoy and love for her. She was his! As herngave her a glass of wine she took a deep sip and then gazed up at himrnwith sad dark eyes, looking very distressed. He suddenly felt likernsomething was amiss. \"Howrnmany brothers and sisters do you have in Limerick, Tom?\"rnasked she quietly. \"Enough.rnWhy?\" he asked. Why this sudden interestrnin his family? \"Whatrnare the names of you brothers and sisters?\"rnshe asked, with an intensive gaze. \"They...\"rnHe saw his own pocket-book in her hands and a letter, which hernrecognised as one from his mother. \"Onrnwhom do they depend?\" she asked and Tomrnsighed. His heart was filled with pain when he realised that she hadrnsecond thoughts. It was true that his family depended on him, but hernwas sure he could make it work. \"Yourrnreputation is destroyed. Your profligacy is a beautiful sham.\"rnShe ushered the letter forward to him so he could read it. \"Irncan earn money.\" \"Itrnwill not be enough.\" \"Irnwill rise.\" He was sure he would be ablernto provide for them. Why could not she believe in him? Why was notrntheir love enough? \"Withrna High Court Judge as your enemy? And a penniless wife? God knows howrnmany mouths depending on you? My sweet, sweet friend, you will sink,rnand we will all sink with you.\" \"Irnwill...\" Hernwas cut off by a coachman: \"HampshirernFlyer. Hampshire Flyer's leaving in five minutes.\"rnJane took her bonnet and prepared to leave him. He took hold of herrnhand. \"No!rnNo, Jane. I will never give you up.\" Hernwould not survive if she was not in his life. \"Tom…\"rnshe started. \"Don'trnspeak or think. Just love me. Do you love me?\"rnHe loosened his grip of her hand and looked straight into her darkrnhazel eyes. \"Yes,\"rnreplied she. He felt relieved for a moment, but she continued; \"Butrnif our love destroys your family, it will destroy itself.\"rnIn a way he knew she was right. He had once chosen his family abovernhis love for her. But that was his choice, not hers. \"No.\" \"In arnlong, slow degradation of guilt and regret and blame.\" \"Thatrnis nonsense.\" Tom would not listen to reason. \"Truth.\"rnShe smiled faintly. \"Made from contradiction. But it must come withrna smile. Or else I shall count it as false and we shall have had nornlove at all.\" He let go of her hand. He could not bear to hear her,rndid not want to hear her. \"Please,\"rnhe begged with tears in his blue eyes. But Jane rose decidedly. \"Goodbye,\"rnsaid she and walked out, not once looking back. He knew not what torndo. His heart was crushed. He rose and went outside. He knew she wasrnright; his family was going to suffer the consequences of theirrnmarriage and so would they. Hernwatched as the coach went past him, strained himself not to rushrnafter it and stop it. He saw her sad face in the window. He was leftrnstanding in the middle of the road, his heart aching for her, as therncoach drove out of the village. That was the hardest choice he hadrnever made, letting her go. May,rn1814 TomrnLefroy realised that he had to tell all to his wife before it was toornlate. She had the right to know about hisrnpast with Miss Austen and what had happened just after theirrnengagement. Though she had never asked he was certain that she knewrnthat there had been someone in his life at the time. But his dearrnMary had never asked him about it. He loved her for accepting him asrnhe was and loving him unconditionally. Now the truth had to be said.rnEverything needed to be set straight. But first he had to see to hisrndaughter. -TBC- As always your reviews is what keeps me going![Chapter 8] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again.

Author's note: Many thanks to my friends who have encouraged me to write and to the ladies of the Becoming Jane Fansite. I also want to thank you for the lovely reviews! Part 8: In which they play show and tell May, 1814 Jane Austen had never been waiting for a letter with such anxiety. Her writing had been put on hold and she did not seem to be able to do anything but pace around. Her mother and sister looked at her great despair with wonder but did not dare ask what the matter was. They had not seen her quite like this before. Her usual walks were taken in deep reflexion and quietness and she seemed to prefer to be left alone with her thoughts. She had not told them what had happened in London and who she had met. \"Jane, dearest, would you care for some tea?\" asked her mother one afternoon. Jane who had been doing some needle work looked up, startled by not being alone. \"Yes, mamma, that would be nice,\" she answered with a small smile. The maid soon came in with a tray of refreshments. \"Is there something you want to tell me, dear?\" Her mother gazed on her with an encouraging smile. \"Well, mamma,\" Jane hesitated. What would her mother think? She had never warmed to Tom Lefroy and to tell her that he was back in her life. No, that was out of the question. Cassandra might understand her, but not her mother. \"Nothing, mamma,\" she finally said. Her mother had never warmed to the idea of her daughter marrying an Irish scoundrel with a reputation. Jane was sure she would not appreciate her being acquainted with the man who almost cost her daughter her reputation. Even if he now was a respected judge. And married, Jane reminded herself. If her mother found out that she was in danger of falling in as much love with him again she would surly lock her up and throw away the key. Even though Jane was now nearing the age of 40. No, the only one besides Henry and Eliza that could know was Cassandra. Since Henry and Eliza had left she needed someone to confide in. \"So, you have not told me about London yet, Jane,\" her mother said innocently. Jane felt her cheeks turn red. \"It was lovely, mamma,\" was all she could offer as reply. At least it was an honest answer. Jane felt like Marianne Dashwood waiting for a letter from Willoughby. Still no letter came for her. She feared the worst. His wife's death must be the only reason why he would not reply to her letter. -xxx- \"Jane, dear,\" Tom Lefroy called softly as he knocked on the door to his daughter's room. He heard a muffled 'come in' and he entered. He had brought the novel Miss Austen had sent her. His daughter was laying on her bed with her nose in one of her many books. \"What are you reading?\" She looked up at him with eyes red with tears. \"Sense and Sensibility,\" replied she. \"Ah, a very good choice. You have another one here.\" He held out the book he had been carrying behind his back. \"Miss Austen sent it for you.\" \"You opened it?\" Jane looked astonished. \"It was addressed to me, including this novel and a letter.\" Jane's face turned red. \"Care to explain what you wrote in your letter to Miss Austen?\" he asked demandingly. Tears prickled in her eyes and she looked down. \"I just... Oh papa, what have I done?\" \"I do not know. Why do not you tell me?\" He sat down on the bed next to her. She looked up at him with large blue sad eyes. \"I accidently came across an old letter from you to Miss Austen.\" She looked down again; her cheeks were turning a deeper shade of red. Tom had thought as much. \"And?\" he urged her to continue. \"And, since I noticed the way you were looking at her in London I just had to open it!\" she blurted out with hot red face and tears in her eyes. He could see that she regretted her action. \"Jane, that was not for you to read. How did you open it without me seeing it was tampered with?\" Tom felt confused, when he had checked the letter it looked unopened. \"I have read many stories about prying men. I just used a knife and a candle,\" she smiled faintly. \"I see, so you read it. Though it was addressed to Miss Austen?\" \"Yes, I am so sorry papa! I just wanted to know how you know her! You do not tell me anything.\" \"I do not see why that would be of any interest to you.\" Tom felt his face grow hot as he spoke. \"My past is not of your concern.\" \"Does mamma know?\" Jane looked at him intensely. \"No, I have not told her. Not yet anyway. But I will.\" Tom was going to see his dying wife afterwards. \"So you and Miss Austen were romantically involved?\" \"I am not going to discuss this matter with my daughter!\" \"Why not, papa? I have already read the letter. I know what happened.\" \"No, you do not know, Jane,\" Tom sighed. How come his daughter was so curious all of a sudden? \"And I am not going to tell you until you are old enough to understand.\" He rose. \"Miss Austen was good enough to write a dedication for you in the novel. Though you do not deserve it.\" He was very cross with her, but even more cross with himself. He left Jane to ponder on her action and went to see his wife. -xxx- Jane had never felt so ashamed of herself in her eleven year old life. She had never gone against her parents will, never talked back. She did not like the fact that everybody still treated her like a little girl that should not concern herself with adult things. It was all very vexing. Why could not her father just admit that he and Miss Austen had been connected once? Was he afraid of what she might think? Jane opened the novel Miss Austen had sent her and read the inscription. To Miss Jane Lefroy, in a time of need every heroine needs to dream herself away. Yours truthfully, a Lady (JA). She smiled softly to the remark of her being a heroine. At least Miss Austen was not very cross with her. Maybe she understood her want to know about her father's past. She took the book and lay down on the bed again and started reading. ' About thirty years ago Miss Maria Ward, of Huntingdon, with only seven thousand pounds, had the good luck to captivate Sir Thomas Bertram, of Mansfield Park, in the county of Northampton, and to be thereby raised to the rank of a baronet's lady, with all the comforts and consequences of an handsome house and large income. ' -xxx- \"Is she conscious?\" Tom asked Mr. Barrington as he met him outside his wife's room. \"At the moment, yes,\" the physician answered. \"You should probably say your goodbyes soon.\" \"Yes, you are right,\" Tom said with pain shooting through his heart. He opened the door and went inside. The curtains were not parted and the room rested in gloomy dusk and only one candle by her bed offered any light. The fire was just glowing faintly. He went to the fire and put some logs on it to make it enflame again. The air felt musty and he went for the windows to let some light and fresh air in. As he drew the curtains he heard his wife stir in bed. The May sun fell on her pale face and she slowly opened her eyes. Tom opened a window and then turned to the bed and smiled at Mary. \"Good day my dearest,\" he said softly. \"My love,\" she whispered just as softly and smiled. Tom walked over and sat down at her side and took her hand in his. It felt so small and fragile, almost breakable. \"How are you feeling today, my love?\" he asked. \"As before. Nothing more, nothing less.\" \"There is something I must tell you, dear Mary,\" said he and looked down at her with the softest blue eyes. \"I must tell you about my past before it is too late.\" He looked at her urgently. \"I do not need to know about your past, my dearest Tom,\" his wife smiled at him. \"All I need to know is that you love me and will take care of our children after I am dead.\" \"I do love you, but you already know that, Mary. But this is something else. Something I have never told you.\" \"I know you had a reputation when I met you, dear,\" Mary said. \"I loved you too much to care. And I like to think I have managed to straighten you out pretty well.\" She giggled softly. \"Yes, my dear. But that is not what I want to tell you,\" Tom looked at her with begging eyes. \"I need to tell you about what happened just before we met, in Hampshire. About who I...\" Tom trailed off. He had trouble with finding the right words. How do you tell your wife about a woman you loved before her? \"Go on, dear,\" Mary urged. \"I have to tell you about who I was with before, and somewhat during, our first years together,\" Tom finally said. He looked down at her and their eyes locked. He was sure she would forgive him, and hopefully she would understand why he had not told her sooner. \"I knew that there was someone else at the time, Tom. A girl knows those things. But you chose me. That is all I need to know. You do not have to tell my about the other love of your life.\" Mary coughed. I am going to lose her. I am going to be a widower. \"I need to tell you this, Mary. Please do not interrupt me or I will not have the nerve.\" His wife smiled up at him, recognising his distress and urgent need of getting this of his chest. She did not speak another word until he had gotten it all out. The whole story was now out. From the first meeting at Steventon till the elopement and now the recently encounter in London. Mary lay silent for a while. \"Please say something,\" he begged when he was finished. \"That was not what I was expected,\" she finally said. \"I cannot believe you never told me you are acquainted with one of my favourite authoresses.\" She looked almost offended. \"How does a man tell his wife about his relationship to another woman?\" \"True. I cannot believe you were so afraid of telling me. I cannot believe you did not trust me enough to tell me!\" Mary started coughing violently. Tom reached for the glass of water by her bed and helped her to a sip. She finally stopped coughing and lay gasping for air for a while before she was able to breathe normally again. \"How could I tell?\" Tom looked at her sincerely. \"Do you still love her?\" Tom was startled by the question. \"Please, answer the question,\" his wife whispered with quivering voice. He had to tell her how he felt for Miss Austen or the whole idea of him telling everything was lost. \"In a way, yes,\" he said truthfully, \"but not like I loved her then. And most definitely not as I love you.\" She let out a sigh. \"I have never really stopped loving her.\" He looked at her with sincere eyes. There, it was said. \"I see. Do you think she still loves you?\" \"I do not know, Mary,\" cried Tom. \"How does one know these things? And why is my wife inquiring of the feelings of another?\" \"Tom, I am dying,\" she said as a matter of factly. \"I am merely thinking of how you will manage without me.\" \"I will never marry again!\" Tom exclaimed heatedly. He could not believe what his wife was saying. \"Tom, you cannot manage on your own.\" \"I am not listening to this,\" cried Tom and rose from the bed and went over to the window and gazed out on the pretty lawns outside, breathing in the fresh air that was coming from the open window. He tried to comprehend what his wife was saying. How can she encourage me to take Miss Austen as my wife after she was gone? \"I would not blame you for taking another wife after I am gone. You will have my blessing. It is better for the children to have a woman around. I do not want you to be left alone for the rest of your life, my dear. You deserve better.\" \"Mary, will you stop talking like that?\" Tom swung around with heated face. \"I will not marry Miss Austen!\" He marched out of the room and left Mary with a dumbfounded look on her face. -TBC- As always, reviews make me write faster! ;)[Chapter 9] I Remember Love A BecomingrnJane -story By:rnjakeline Summary:rnThe story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom havernmet again.

How did yournlike her? I know how much you admire her writing.\" Jane did notrnknow what to say. She did not want to sound too appreciative of MissrnAusten in case her mother did not think too kindly of her. \"She isrna lovely lady,\" was all Jane could say. \"Is shernpretty at all?\" \"Mamma!\"rnexclaimed Jane, wondering why her mother asked about Miss Austen allrnof a sudden. \"Howrndid your father act around her?\" Her mother pressed on the subject.rnJane was astonished. \"I dornnot know…\" Jane hesitated. \"Did you argue over Miss Austen,rnmamma?\" \"I didrnnot argue, your father did. He did not like my suggestion.\" Herrnmother started coughing. \"What suggestion?\" \"Aboutrnhim taking Miss Austen as his wife after I am dead.\" Jane looked atrnher mother with wide eyes in utter astonishment. \"What?\"rncried Jane. \"Butrnhe said he will not marry her, or marry at all again after I am gone.rnHe is a very headstrong man. You take after him so much, Jane. Yournknow he listens to you. Maybe you can talk some sense into him. Hernneeds a woman by his side.\" \"But,rnmamma!\" Jane looked horrified. She couldrnnot think of her father marry again. \"I will take care of papa.\" \"Myrndear, Jane, I do not wish you to grow up without female guidance. Butrnnow he says he will not have her. The woman he nearly eloped withrnwhen he was engaged to me!\" Her mother's cheeks turned slightlyrnredder. She coughed yet again. \"Please,rnmamma,\" begged Jane, \"do not get yourself aggravated over this.rnPapa will never love another woman as he has loved you.\" \"Yournare your father's daughter, Jane.\" Her mother sighed, admittingrndefeat. \"Very well, I will not press the subject further. But tellrnme this, Jane; honestly, do you think he still has affectionaternfeelings for Miss Austen?\" She looked sincerely at her daughter. \"Irnonly think of his survival.\" \"I dornnot know, but he seemed a different person around her. How does onernknow if a person is in love?\" Jane asked hesitatingly. \"He chosernyou, mamma.\" \"Irnknow he did and he will be lost without me. But Miss Austen might bernthe perfect match for him. He loved her first. She was the firstrnwoman to capture his affections.\" \"Whatrnhappened between them? Papa will not tell me.\" \"Really,rnthat is not my place to tell you, but I do know that he did love herrnvery much and that she broke his heart.\" \"Irnthought he left her. She watched papa with such sorrowful eyes whenrnwe were in London. I do think she still cares deeply for him.\" \"Promisernme one thing, dear child, never to marry without affection!\" \"Oh,rnmamma! I am determined, as many of Miss Austen's heroines, only tornlet the deepest affection bring me to the altar.\" She hugged herrnmother tightly. -xxx- TomrnLefroy did not return to the house before the sun had set. Still hernhad not found an answer to his wife's wishes. His feelings towardsrnMiss Austen were not as they once had been. Now something inside himrnbegan stirring, a dormant feeling of long lost love. He had not letrnhimself to think about her much since they came back from London. Hernthought of how she had behaved towards him in London, very ladylikernwith a quiet pleasantness towards him and his daughter. There wasrnsomething in her eyes that made him wonder if the old feelings ofrnaffection still lingered in her heart. He could not help but thinkrnthat she might still care for him. Perhaps even love him. Asrnhe returned inside he decided to write Miss Austen a reply on herrnkind letter. He found himself in want of a friend. Limerick,rnlate May 1814 DearrnMiss Jane Austen. Thankrnyou for you kind concern regarding my wife. I am sorry to inform yournthat she is still unwell and there is very little chance of recoveryrnmy physician tells me. He has done everything in his power to curernher, but without result. Irnfind myself in want of a friend. I hope I may still consider you myrnfriend though our ways did not part in the best of ways. It was sornnice to see you again in London. I hope you are still in good health? Asrnfor the letter my daughter sent you, I do believe I must sayrnsomething about that. I cannot tell you what to do, that isrncompletely your own choice. I have not told her anything more thanrnshe has read in the letter she found. A letter I wrote to you beforernthe elopement, but never gave to you. She is most regretful of herrnactions and sends her most sincere apologies for the agony this mustrnhave caused you. I know she also is very thankful for the novel yournso kindly sent her. Irnfind myself on the verge of being a widower, my children motherless.rnI do not know how I will manage without my sweet ,rnloving wife. Mary is sure I will not survive without a woman by myrnside.

Yours,rnaffectionately, as always, TomrnLefroy -xxx- JanernAusten found herself being blessed with two letters on the same day.rnWhen she took them in her hand one of them made her smile with eagerrnanticipation and the other frown and her stomach curl up in a tightrnknot. One letter was from Mr Lefroy and the other from his wife, MrsrnMary Lefroy. She did not know which to begin with. \"Sister?\"rncalled her sister Cassandra from the other room. \"Yes,rnCassandra?\" Jane took the letters and joined her sister in therndrawing room. \"Anyrnletters?\" \"Onlyrnfor me,\" Jane said quietly. \"Anyrnnews from Henry or Eliza?\" Cassandra enquired. \"No,rnnot yet.\" Jane sat down on next to her sister. \"Was itrnsomething you needed me for?\" \"Yes,rnyou have looked so distraught lately, Jane. Are you sure nothing isrnthe matter?\" \"I amrnfine, Cassie,\" Jane smiled. \"Irnam your sister, Jane. I can read you likernan open book.\" Cassandra looked at her. \"What happened inrnLondon?\" Jane sighed; she knew she could not keep this from herrnsister. Cassandra was right; she had always been able to tell ifrnsomething was amiss. \"I metrnTom,\" she said quietly. \"Mr TomrnLefroy?\" asked Cassandra with widened eyes. \"Yes.\" \"Whyrnhave not you told me this sooner?\" \"Therernis not much to tell, really. His wife got ill and he left in a hurry.rnHe has a lovely daughter named Jane!\" Jane's cheeks had startedrnglowing. The mentioning of his name still made her stomach flutterrnand she thought of the letter he had sent, and then there was thernletter from his wife. \"I got a letter from him and his wife today.\"rnShe showed Cassandra the letters. \"Onernfrom each of them?\" \"Yes, Irnwonder what they will tell me.\" \"Openrnthem!\" urged her sister. Jane did as she was told and opened Tom'srnletter first. \"Hisrnwife is very ill indeed,\" she breathed. Her hearted skipped a beat.rn\"No hope of recovery.\" \"Andrnwhat does his wife write?\" Jane opened the other letter and read itrnquietly.

Irndo not wish to leave my husband and children behind, but God has madernthat decision for me. I cannot alter my faith. All I can wish for nowrnis for someone care for my family that I leave behind.

She handed over the letter to Cassandra who readrnit with growing concern. \"Whatrncould she mean?\" \"Herrndying wish is to meet me and let her knowrnthat I will care for Tom after she is gone.\" Jane met Cassandra'srnpuzzled eyes. \"She is a most extraordinary woman.\" -TBC- Your reviews makes my day![Chapter 10] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again.

It is what makes me continue writing! Part 10: In which Miss Austen takes a trip June, 1814 \"Surely you will marry again when mamma dies?\" Jane asked innocently at dinner one night. Tom looked over at her, startled by the question. \"I love your mother too much to take another wife,\" he replied. Jane Austen's sad dark eyes flickered before his eyes. They had been haunting him day and night since his wife's proposal. \"But I will need female guidance, mamma says,\" Jane insisted. \"We will of course send for a governess,\" he replied. Miss Austen would be the perfect guide for any young girl, well educated and talented. \"Mamma says you are too headstrong for your own good,\" Jane remarked. Tom smiled; it was as he was hearing his dear Mary. \"Your mother is a very good, generous sort of woman. How could I find someone as good as her?\" \"Miss Austen would do just fine.\" Tom's eyes widened. The nerve of the child! \"Jane,\" he said with a harsh tone in his voice. \"Leave Miss Austen out of this conversation.\" \"I would so much like her to be my new mother,\" Jane said with pouting lips. She is as headstrong as me! \"That is enough, young lady!\" Why where the women of his family so eager to marry him off with Miss Austen? \"But, papa!\" \"I said enough!\" Tom rose. \"Is it because she broke your heart?\" Tom looked at her with a grim face. \"What do you know about love?\" \"I know what I have read in her novels,\" she said stubbornly. \"What has happened with you lately, Jane? Where is my sweet obliging daughter? Hm? The one who did as she was told?\" Jane looked silently down at her plate. He could see her burning cheeks. \"I am going to lose my mother,\" she whispered. \"How will I manage without her?\" She glanced up at him. He could see tears glittering in her eyes. \"I like Miss Austen. Mamma says she would do you good.\" \"I will go speak with your mother this instance.\" Tom hurried out of the dining room. Thoughts of Jane Austen as his wife was following him. Thoughts he had not let himself think of since she left him at the inn. -xxx- Jane Austen had still not made up her mind. One part of her urged her to go to Limerick as fast as she possibly could, but the other said to leave the family alone. What if Mrs Lefroy passed away before she arrived? It was not an easy trip to make, even though the weather had been fine the last week. It was not an easy decision to make. Had the invitation come from Tom she would not hesitate, nevertheless, it was a dying woman's wish to see her. It was Mrs Lefroy's wish for Jane to care for Tom after she was gone. Jane wanted to take care of him and his family. But did he feel the same? Could he love her again, after all that they had been through in the past? -xxx- \"You did what?\" Tom exclaimed when his wife told him about her bold decision to send Miss Austen a letter. \"You will never admit that you need help.\" \"That is not your decision to make!\" Tom was angry with her. \"You loved her once, and you still harbour feelings for her. You loved her enough to be willing to throw you reputation away! My dear Tom, such feelings do not die away easily. It is my wish to know that you will be in good caring hands.\" \"And if Miss Austen will not come?\" \"She will come. It is my dying wish to meet her. If she cares at all for you, she will come.\" Tom looked down at his wife with soft, loving eyes and once again he was filled with astonishment for this selfless being who only thought of others before herself. \"My dear Mary, what will I do without you?\" \"Marry Miss Austen!\" A coy smile played on her lips. He lay himself down on the bed next to her. His hands caressed her pale cheeks. \"I love you, Mary, I cannot...\" \"Shush, my dear,\" she put a finger on his lips to hinder him from utter the words again. -xxx- \"So, Jane, have you decided what to do?\" Cassandra asked two days after the letters from Ireland had come. \"I am throwing conventions out the window and have decided to go. It is Mrs Lefroy's dying wish after all.\" Jane smiled slightly, she had surprised herself by coming to the conclusion that it would be very impolite of her not to accept the invitation from a dying woman who so clearly loved her husband enough to invite an old romance. \"I am all astonishment!\" Cassandra said with a smile in her sweet face. \"No, you are not,\" Jane corrected. \"You knew I would go.\" \"Yes, when it comes to Tom you have always done what your heart has told you.\" \"I have to go pack my trunk. I have to leave in an hour to catch the post.\" Jane smiled like a young girl and her eyes were glittering again and her cheeks rosy. \"You have no objections then, for me going?\" Jane turned to her sister. \"I cannot stop you. I would have done the same if it was Robert,\" Cassandra replied quietly. \"My dearest sister,\" Jane rushed to her side. Cassandra had never recovered from the loss of her husband to be. She hugged her tightly. \"What would I do without you?\" Jane hurried to her room to gather her things. Cassandra helped her. \"What will mother say?\" Cassandra asked quietly. \"I do not know, Cassie, and frankly. I think I am too old to care.\" As soon as she was done she went to her mother in the drawing room. \"Mamma, I am leaving.\" Her mother looked up from her needle work with a puzzled look on her face. \"Jane? Where are you going?\" \"To Ireland! I have been invited to stay with Mrs Lefroy, she is very ill and has requested that I meet her before she leaves this earth.\" \"Lefroy?\" Her mother tasted the name, trying to remember why it sounded familiar. \"No!\" she cried when she remembered the Irish rogue that had almost taken her Jane from her. \"Yes, mamma, it is her dying wish. I cannot deny any of my admirers their dying wish,\" Jane said firmly. Cassandra went to her mother's side. \"Let Jane go, you cannot make her stay,\" she said quietly. \"I must go,\" Jane cried as the bell struck noon. \"I will write as soon as I have arrived,\" she promised as she put her bonnet on and her coat. \"Good day!\" She left her mother and sister in a state of bewilderment. \"Do not worry, mamma, you know Jane must go her own way,\" Cassandra said as the front door closed after her sister. She admired her courage, to go through such a journey on her own, just to be near the man she loved. -xxx- \"I have received word from Miss Austen,\" Mary said to her husband a few days later. \"We shall be expecting her at the end of this week.\" She smiled triumphantly. \"I just hope I will stay alive until then! I long to meet her.\" Tom made no answer. The thought of Jane coming to his home as a guest of his beloved wife was both alarming and exhilarating. \"Jane is also longing to see her again. She really enjoyed her acquaintance in London. She talks very warmly about her,\" his wife chattered on. \"You seem in remarkable high spirits today, my dear,\" Tom commented lightly. \"I am!\" she chirped, but was soon caught in a coughing fit. \"Only a few more days,\" she said to herself. \"Then I can leave this world knowing that Tom will have a good woman by his side.\" She breathed deeply to keep her coughing at bay. \"What's that, my dear?\" Tom asked. \"Nothing.\" Tom stood by the windows looking out on the grounds surrounding their house. He spotted Jane in the garden coming up from the little wilderness at the end of garden with a book in her hand. One of Jane Austen's he imagined. \"Do I need to meet Miss Austen somewhere? Did she say?\" he asked. \"I will send Jones to fetch her. After all, she is my guest.\" \"Mary, are you sure this is wise?\" \"I do believe you are a bit nervous, my dear?\" Mary winked at him. \"I am not!\" But to tell the truth he was. This was not like meeting her in London. She was a guest in his home. Invited by his wife. -xxx- Jane Austen was exhausted from being on the road and water for several days. She was glad to find she was now only half a day's trip from Limerick. The near proximity to Tom was taking its toll. She was fluttered and nervous. She had no idea of what was expected of her when she arrived. She hoped she could of use in their time of need. The post had stopped for refreshments and she took the time to freshen up, wash the road dust away. She wanted to look her best when she met the woman who had married the man of her dreams. She looked at her reflection in the mirror and wondered why she was doing this. Why had she rushed off to Limerick in such haste? Just to be near Tom? Was she chasing a dream? Mrs Lefroy's death was apparently imminent but Jane did not dare hope for a future with Tom. Jane ordered a glass of port wine at the inn to calm her nerves. She had not felt this nervous before, but now there was only hours till she would be in his house breathing the same air as him, meeting his dying wife and the rest of his family. What would they think of her? Would they think her an intruder, even though their mother had invited her personally? And Miss Lefroy with her curious nature and searching eyes, what would she think? \"Passengers to Limerick, please make your way to the carriage!\" A coachman shouted out. Jane rose on shaky legs. It was time. She could not turn back now. -TBC- Your review makes my day![Chapter 11] I Remember Love A BecomingnJane -story By:njakeline Summary:nThe story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom havenmet again.

Part 11: In which they find that oldnfeelings die hard June,n1814 TomnLefroy stood by the window facing the frontngarden as the carriage coming up the road and turning in on thenpebbled drive. His stomach fluttered and he drew a deep breath. Hendid not know what to expect. He did not know what Miss Austen wasnexpecting. Her reply to his wife's invitation had been very kindnand amiable. She was a good natured woman that cared for othersnbefore herself. Miss Austen and Mary were much alike in that sense. Hencould see her bonnet covered head in the open carriage. He wonderednhow the other children would take to her. Jane was beside herselfnwith excitement to meet her again. Thoughnshe had been hesitant at the first thought of her mother'snsuggestion. Not only was she a avid admirer of her writing, but alsonlonged to discuss literature with Miss Austen. She had also uttered anwant to personally apologise for the letter with inquiries regardingnhis and Miss Austen's past. His wife seemed to hang on a sheernthread of life just to be able to meet Miss Austen. He was amazed bynhis wife's selflessness again. Thencarriage stopped and Jones helped Miss Austen out of the carriage.nShe glanced around, taking in the gardensnand houses. She suddenly looked up at him, as if she had felt hisngazes. Their gazes locked. Tom's heart skipped a beat. She lookednvery well indeed. A bit flushed maybe. He left the window and hurriedndown stairs to greet her. -xxx- JanenAusten exhaled. She was finally there. And in one piece. The manornlooked very well kept and the gardens lovely. She looked up at thenhouse and meet Tom's eyes through a window. A small smile played onnhis lips. She wondered what he thought of her for coming rushing on andying woman's whim. When she looked back up again he hadndisappeared from the window just as he had at done at Lady Gresham'snball. She realised she was going to meet all of his children and notnonly Miss Lefroy. She suddenly wondered what she had been thinking,ncoming here. \"MissnAusten!\" Jane Lefroy came running out of the front door with angreeting smile on her face. Her father came behind her, stillnsmiling. He looked truly happy to see hernmuch to Jane's surprise. She would have thought she would be morentimid after her bold actions. Miss Lefroy took her hands and draggednher inside. \"Mamma is longing to meet you, Miss Austen!\" \"Jane,nplease let Miss Austen settle in before you whisk her away to seenMary,\" Tom said. \"Ring the bell for tea, Jane.\" Jane Austennsmiled thankfully at Tom. She felt like she could sleep for a wholenday straight. Though she felt like she was no more than twenty shenhad to admit that she was not. \"Willnyou come and meet mamma now, Miss Austen?\" Jane Lefroy asked afternthe tea was had. She was obviously very eager for her to meet MrsnLefroy. \"Come,nJane, Miss Austen must be taken to her room first and left tonunpack,\" Tom said. \"But,npapa!\" his daughter cried. \"Tomorrow,nJane, there is a day tomorrow you know. Miss Austen is exhausted.\"nIndeed she was. Jane felt as if she could fall asleep right there,nsitting upright. \"Please follow Miss Austen to her room, Jane.\" \"Fine,npapa,\" his daughter answered sulkily. \"Miss Austen, if younplease.\" Miss Lefroy left the room and Jane followed. \"Itnis a lovely house,\" Jane said as they went up the staircase. \"Yes,nit is,\" Miss Lefroy answered lightly. She suddenly turned. \"I amnso sorry for writing you that awful letter! I cannot begin to thinknwhat you must think of me! You have been nothing but nice to me!\"nHer cheeks were burning hot. \"MissnLefroy, it is fine,\" Jane replied, smiling encouragingly. \"Do notnworry yourself about that. No harm was done.\" \"Papansays he does not recognise me anymore. Perhaps I have read too manynnovels.\" \"Inam sure you have not. You are a sensible girl, perhaps a bit curiousnfor your own good. But you have a good heart and I am sure you meannwell. Now, Miss Lefroy, show me to my room.\" She took Miss Lefroynunder the arm. \"Inalso want to thank you for MansfieldnPark, Miss Austen. A most delightfulnnovel!\" \"Younare too kind.\" \"Well,nhere we are then,\" Miss Lefroy said and stopped outside a door. Shenopened it and Jane found herself in a small but lovely room. \"Yournwindows face the back garden. Papa thoughtnyou would like it.\" By the windows stood a small table and chair tonsit at while gazing out at the horizon. Jane smiled, an excellentnplace for her to sit and write. \"It isnlovely indeed.\" \"I willnleave you to it then, Miss Austen. If there is anything you need donnot hesitate to ring for Millie.\" Miss Lefroy left Jane to unpack. -xxx- Thenfact that Jane Austen was in his house made Tom Lefroy sleep very illnindeed. He was still surprised that she had agreed to come. His wifencould be rather persuasive when she had put her mind to something. Henwondered if Jane knew why his wife had asked her to come. His wifenhad not entirely told him what she had written in the letter othernthan she wanted to meet the famous authoress. Tomnhad not slept more than an hour when the rays of the June sun hit hisnface trough the curtains. He decided to take a walk in the finenweather, enjoy the silence while it lasted. The morning air was crispnand the green grass was covered in dew. He breathed in the cool freshnair and turned his face to the sun and closed his eyes, enjoying thenwarmth on his face. It was mornings like these when he feltninvincible. It had been a very long time since he had felt thisnserene. It felt like a problems faded away and that everything wasngoing to be fine. He felt complete happiness at that moment. -xxx- JanenAusten was surprised to find Tom up and about when she rose early thennext morning. The sun was just up and she stood by her windows gazingnout at the gardens when she saw his figure walking down the lawn.nSuddenly he stopped and turned his face to the sun and just stoodnthere. He looked very peaceful as he stood there. She dressed quicklynto join him. She wanted to speak with him alone before facing hisnwife. -xxx- The soundnof a branch creaking under a shoe behind him brought him back to thenpresent. Startled he swung around and found Miss Jane Austen makingnher way towards him. He went to meet her. \"Younare up very early, Mr Lefroy,\" she remarked and took the arm henoffered. \"Inmight say the same about you, Miss Austen,\" he replied with ansmile. \"Ah,nyes, well I could not let this beautiful morning go to waste now,ncould I?\" \"Ofncourse.\" They continued their stroll in silence for a while,nenjoying the fine morning and each other's company. \"Therenwas a time when I thought you did not care for walks, Mr Lefroy,\"nJane said with a small smile on her lips. He looked over at her.nBeautiful in the morning sun, with hair barely kissed with grey. \"True,\"nsaid he. He remembered the time she was referring to. \"Ah well,nthis is not the Selborne Wood, but it will have to do. It is not asncelebrated.\" He gestured towards a gathering of trees ahead. Shenlaughed softly. \"So, donI get to meet Mrs Lefroy today?\" she asked. \"Inbelieve you will have no choice. She has been looking forward to meetnyou, hardly spoken of little else.\" The remark made her blushnslightly. \"She isna remarkable woman, Mr Lefroy.\" \"Ohncome, we are well enough acquainted to be calling each other by ournChristian names, are we not?\" \"Notnas well as we used to, my friend,\" she answered quietly. Henrealised he had missed her company, missed the banter from the oldndays. That was something he and Mary never had. She always took hisnside in matters. Seldom spoke against him. She liked everything henliked. Most of the time anyway. She was not as passionate as MissnAusten, or at least not as passionate as Miss Austen had been whennshe was young. Thencontinued their walk amongst the trees. Tom felt rejuvenated. Thendark thoughts that had been occupying his head lately had gone away,nat least for now. Miss Austen had a soothing air around her, likenbalm for his soul. -xxx- JanenLefroy was astounded to see her father and Jane Austen strolling innthe park and at that hour. Her father rarely rose before eight whennhe was home. It must be the weathe r.nIt was truly delightful. They looked deep in conversation, and shenwondered what they were talking about. They had been very close once;nmaybe they could find that again. Jane was still half undecided onnthe matter of her father marrying again. But if he was to marry againnshe would like it to Miss Austen. Miss Austen was really one of hernfavourite people in the world. She could not think of anyone elsenbetter suited to marry her father. He liked novels and she was annovelist. Janenthought of joining them on their walk but decided against it. She didnnot want to impose on their private conversation. -xxx- \"Didnyou know your wife sent me the letter?\" Jane suddenly asked. \"Maryntold me after she had sent the letter,\" he replied, sounding amazednby his wife's conduct. \"Do younknow what she asks of me?\" She looked at him intensely. Tom lookednaway not wanting to meet her queering eyes. Not sure if he could hidenthe feelings that was rummaging through his body. He had realisednthat he still loved her. Had always loved her, never stopped lovingnher in a way. \"Yes,\"nhe finally replied. \"Jane, I…\" \"Tom,ndo not…\" Jane cut in. Her face was flushed, she looked away. \"I…\"nShe could not find the words to say anything. She did not what to saynanymore. She wished that everything was as they used to. Before henmarried, before they grew old and before she left him at the inn thatnMay-day all those years ago. They had to be sensible now, even thoughnhis wife had stated that she wanted Jane to take care of her husbandnwhen she was gone. Jane let go of Tom's arm and left him. Hurriedlynshe walked up to the house again, her vision blurred with tears. Hernbody betrayed her. -TBC- Your reviewnmakes my day![Chapter 12] I Remember Love A BecomingnJane -story By:njakeline Summary:nThe story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom havenmet again.

Her brothers and sister satnquietly and ate, but from time to time they glancednat the newcomer. Jane watched her father and Miss Austen closely.nMiss Austen still looked very sad, almost as if she had recentlyncried. She noticed that Miss Austen kept stealing glances of hernfather and that he gazed on her as often as he thought no one wasnlooking. There was so much longing in the gazes that Jane was surenthat her mother's scheme would succeed. She had to tell her mothernabout what she had observed. She would be very pleased indeed. \"MissnAusten, you must ask papa to show you our library. I am sure you willnfind many books to your liking,\" Jane said. Her father lookednsearchingly at her, to see what scheme she was up to now. Janenconcentrated on her youngest sibling instead of meeting her father'sneyes, helping George to another piece of bread. \"Ofncourse, I would be delighted to see your library, if you could sparenthe time, Mr Lefroy,\" Miss Austen said with blushing cheeks. Hernfather's face had also gone slightly redder. Jane looked from MissnAusten to her father and back again. They were both looking a bitnembarrassed as if they both had thought of something from their past.nTheir gazes locked and they shared a most private smile. \"Incan take you on the grand tour as soon as we have finishednbreakfast,\" her father said. \"Thatnwould be very nice of you,\" replied Miss Austen.

Miss Austen grew a deeper shade of red, her fatherndropped his chin and the rest of the Lefroy children, except youngnGeorge who was still occupied with his piece of bread, stared atnJeffry with eyes wide open in bewilderment. Jeffry had no clue as tonwhat he had done wrong. \"Anthonynand Jane,\" her father said quietly when he had regained hisncomposure. \"Please take your brothers and sister to the nursery.\"nThey obeyed immediately without a word andnushered their younger siblings out of the room with haste. -xxx- JanenAusten was a bit hesitant to join the family for breakfast but foundnthat she really had no choice but to join them. All of Tom'snchildren were seated around the big table. She must admit that shenwas a bit intimidated by them. They did seem very quiet and wellnbehaved children, but there were so many of them. Anthony was theneldest, then Miss Jane, Anne, Thomas, Jeffry and little Georgensitting between Miss Lefroy and Anthony. The children were seatednthree at each side of the long table leaving the ends to her and Tom.nIt felt as if she was imposing on their mother's place at thentable. She could not help herself but to think of what it would benlike to be mistress of this house, the mother of these children. Thenchildren stole glances of her from time to time when they thought shendid not see. WhennMiss Lefroy mentioned the library she recalled another library. Thenone at Ashe to where she had fled that one time and found that Tomnhad too. Her cheeks grew as she recallednTom reciting Mr. White's NaturalnHistory . She had been rather surprisednto see him with a book in his hand. She smiled at the memory, lookingnup at Tom. \"Arenyou going to be our new mamma?\" Jeffry, the second youngest,nsuddenly asked out of the blue. Jane felt her cheeks turn even reddernand she knew not where to look. She glanced over at Tom who sat withnopen mouth, unable to speak. Finally Tom asked the eldest to takentheir siblings to the nursery and they obeyed without a word. Janenlooked down at her hands, unable to utter a word. \"Younhave to excuse Jeffry, he does not know of what he speaks,\" Tomnsaid, apologetically. \"No,nthat is fine. He is so young.\" \"Wenhave been open with the children. They all know that their mother isngoing to leave them very soon.\" Jane looked up at him, meeting hisnblue, piercing eyes. \"Tom,nI…\" she started, but lost her nerve. \"What?nJane?\" he urged her to continue. \"Isnthat what your wife wants? For me to take care of you and yournchildren when she is gone?\" \"Younwill have to ask her that yourself,\" Tom replied. \"Maybenit is time we pay the mistress of the house a visit. I know she hasnbeen asking for you several times.\" He stood up and motioned fornher to follow him. \"Whatnabout the library?\" Jane was not ready to meet Mrs Lefroy yet. \"All inndue time, first I'd like you to meet the reason to why you arenhere.\" -xxx- Hencould see that Jane Austen was equallynshocked by his son's blunt question as the rest them. Tom did notnunderstand from where that question came from. Wherendid that notion come from? Had thenservants been speaking about Miss Austen's presence in terms of himntaking her as his new wife? Something must have made the boy thinknthat Miss Austen could be his new mother. But no one other than henand his wife, and perhaps Jane, knew about why Mary had invited MissnAusten. Henled Miss Austen to his wife's room in silence. Bothnwere still shocked about what had happened in the breakfast room. Henknocked softly on the door to Mary's room and a muffled 'come in'ncame from the other side. He opened the door and ushered Miss Austennin before himself. \"Mary,nmay I present Miss Austen?\" said Tom as he and Jane stood beforenher bed. Mary looked remarkably well this morning and he felt proud. \"MissnAusten, how delightful!\" Mary rose as far as she could manage onnher own holding out her right hand for Miss Austen to take. MissnAusten took a step forward with a small smile in her face. The twonwomen studied each other with curiosity. Tom watched them, the twonwomen who both had a piece of his heart. \"MrsnLefroy,\" said Jane and took her hand and then sat down in the chairnnext to the bed. \"Inam so pleased that you decided to come,\" said Mary withna bright smile that Tom had not seen for a long time. He was strucknby the difference in appearance by the two women. They looked likenday and night, Jane with her dark hair and dark eyes while his wifenwas fair with blond hair and blue eyes. Suddenlynhe felt a flutter of hope in his stomach, Mary looked almost healthy.nThe coulour was back on her cheeks and her eyes were clear as thensunny day outside. Maybe God would spare her after all. Tom smiled tonhimself. \"Whatnare you smiling about?\" demanded his wife to know. \"Oh,nnothing. I will leave you two ladies alone to get acquainted,\" hensaid and left the room. He suddenly realised that if Mary recoverednthat would mean that he once again would have to give up his love fornJane. His heart and mind was torn in two. He felt utterly confused bynall this. -xxx- JanenAusten looked at the woman who Tom had married. She did not look verynill, in fact she looked rather healthy. \"I amnso sorry that we did not meet under happier circumstances,\" Marynsaid with a soft smile. \"So amnI,\" Jane replied not sure what else to say. If Mrs Lefroy had notnbeen ill they would probably not have met at all. \"You have a verynlovely home.\" \"Thanknyou, Miss Austen. Have Tom shown you our library yet? It is hisnmasterpiece. He takes such pride in filling it with books.\" \"No,nnot yet.\" Both women grew silent looking down at her hands or outnthe window. \"I have met you children. They are so well behaved. Younmust be very proud, Mrs Lefroy.\" \"Oh,nplease, call me Mary,\" Mary smiled andnJane nodded in consent. \"MissnJane in particular, a very clever young girl,\" Jane said. \"Shentakes after her father. She is so like Tom,\" Mary replied. \"Sameninterest in books.\" \"Insee,\" Jane said. She thought of all the lively discussions she andnTom had had about different novels and authors in the past. Shenrecalled the time in London where they had met Mrs Radcliffe. Herncheeks turned red. She did not meet Mary's gaze, her eyes wouldnbetray the feelings that had once again filled her heart. \"Younstill love Tom,\" Mary said, as a matter of factly. Jane's facengrew even redder, her cheeks were burning. She forced herself to meetnMary's gaze. \"I do,\"nshe whispered. Mary nodded. \"Inam glad.\" Jane could not understand this woman. She took everythingnwith such calm. Jane was not sure how she would have acted in Mary'snplace. She sure would not bear it with such equanimity. \"I...\"nJane found no words. \"Donnot worry. I just want to make sure Tom...\" Mary started coughing.nJane quickly rose to help her to a sip of water. \"I do not havenmuch time left,\" Mary panted. \"Anyone can see that Tom still hasnfeelings for you. His and our children's well being is all I carenabout right now.\" \"Howncan you be so calm and unselfish?\" Janenlooked at her, unbelievingly. Mrs Lefroy was truly a remarkablenwoman. \"Inhave reconciled with my fate. I am ready to meet our Lord. There isnnothing I can do to change my fate. My time has come. I just want tonmake sure that my loved ones are happy. And if I can change the fatenof two people I love and care for, I can die happy. I cannot help butnthink that I stole him from you, even if our marriage was a dealnbetween his uncle and my father. I cared for him. I must admit that Infound myself quite easily persuaded to marry him.\" Mary coughednagain, but continued, \"You gave him up to save him and his familynfrom poverty. For that I admire you. That must have been a very hardnchoice to make. To chose between love and the survival of relationsnyou had never met.\" Mary was interrupted by another coughing fitnand sweat started prickling her forehead. Jane took the cloth thatnlay in a bowl with water and wiped Mary's forehead. \"Younshould rest,\" she said. Mary nodded in agreement, the colour hadngone from her cheeks and she looked very pale. Jane could see how illnshe really was. She felt truly sorry for the other woman. Such fatenfor someone that was still quite young. \"I will come see younlater.\" Mary closed her eyes and drifted off in slumber. Janenquitted the room silently and retired to her room to write tonCassandra as promised. She had been too tired to write the nightnbefore. -TBC-[Chapter 13] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again.

Disclaimer: I do not own Jane Austen, Tom Lefroy or any other character in this story. Facts are taken from the Becoming Jane Fansite. Author's note: Again, thank you, my dear readers, for your words of encouragement! I cannot begin to tell you how happy it makes me to hear that my writing is to your liking. Part 13: In which Miss Austen finds that she can only do so much Jane Lefroy was still shocked by her brother's question. She did not know what to do. Her father and Miss Austen had been lost for words. She stayed with her siblings in the nursery occupying herself and the others with reading to them. She enjoyed reading out loud; her father had always said that she had a pleasant voice to listen to. Perhaps she should visit her mother later and read to her for an hour from Mansfield Park . She had really enjoyed that novel. Anthony rose and started pacing the room. He was too restless to sit still. He never enjoyed their time in the nursery and would much rather be outside, playing with the dogs or riding his horse. \"Anthony, please sit still or be gone!\" cried Jane after watching him anxiously for a while. \"You are making me nervous with your fiddling!\" \"I am just so confused. Who is this Miss Austen, and why has mamma invited her here?\" Anthony asked. \"She is an old friend of papa's,\" Jane answered. \"And mamma is an admirer of her books, as am I. Papa and I met her in London.\" \"Is she really to be our new mother?\" Anthony asked quietly so that Jane was the only one that heard him. \"I do not know. But mamma believes that papa needs someone to look after him,\" replied Jane equally quiet. \"She said that?\" Anthony looked surprised. He was two years Jane's senior but Jane was the one who knew what went on in the house. He kept his business outside the house. \"Yes,\" whispered Jane. \"But we do not even know Miss Austen.\" \"Papa does. And mamma will meet her, or she has already. If you were to read one of her novels you would know what Miss Austen is like. She is a very kind and talented woman.\" Jane felt like she had to defend her mother's decision to invite Miss Austen. \"Bah, female writers!\" \"Anthony!\" cried Jane. \"I thought papa had raised you better! Everybody reads Miss Austen.\" \"Female writers are for female readers.\" Anthony's eyes twinkled with mischief. Jane realised he was only teasing her. \"Anthony, why do you always mock me?\" she scolded. \"I most certainly do not,\" he answered indignantly but his face turned into a bright smile. \"You should be nice to me. Remember it is your birthday soon!\" \"Oh, go and ride your horse or something!\" Jane cried and tossed the book she was holding at him. He ducked and ran out of the room chuckling. Jane sighed and shook her head. Boys . -xxx- Jane Austen sat by the little table in her room and gazed out over the garden and the rolling hills beyond. She could still not believe that she was there, in his house because his wife had asked her to come. Her meeting with Mary had made Jane guess Mary's dying wish. She wanted Jane to fill her place as wife and mother and not just be here though the grieving time. The thought of becoming Mrs Jane Lefroy sent shivers down her spine and brought a flutter to her stomach. There was nobody left to stand in their way now. No bizarre uncle to have his last word. She wondered what her mother would say to the idea of her marrying the Irishman who almost ruined her reputation once. She did not really care. It was her life. She tried to write down her feelings on paper in the letter to Cassandra but found it hard to write of her own feelings. This was not fiction, not imagination, this was happening to her! Her heart was filled with uncontrollable joy and most of all with love. Mrs Jane Lefroy , it had a nice ring to it. Limerick, June 1814, My dearest Cassandra I hope you are as well as when I left for nearly a week ago. I am well, the journey was long but I arrived here in one piece. Exhausted after being on the road for days I could barely stay awake to take tea. I met Mrs Lefroy today. She did not look as ill as I would have thought. It is now clear what her intentions were for bringing me here. She wants me to take her place. I do not what to say about that. It is very sad that such an extraordinary woman should leave this life before her time. She is truly amazing. All she thinks of is her family and their survival after she is gone. I cannot believe how calm she is about all this. I admire her immensely. I do not know how I would react in her shoes. But I would not have invited an old lady friend of my husband's! Especially since she knows our whole story. I have met the children also. There are several! Six all and all. The youngest, George, has just recently turned three. Apparently Miss Jane Lefroy is about to turn twelve in a week! Fancy that. I do hope Mrs Lefroy has not left us by then. To think I would be in charge of six children, what an intimidating thought! I do so want to know what the children thinks of my presence, but I dare not ask. Little Jeffry, the second youngest, asked me if I was to be their new mother at breakfast. I did not know how to respond. I, who seldom is without words! What do you say to a question like that? Of course, they, Tom and his wife, have been very honest with the children, letting them know that their mother is to leave this life. But Tom looked as surprised by the question as I. I do not know whether Tom still has feelings for me. And as you know, my dear sister, I will not marry for anything other than the deepest affections. You know me. I must admit I am in danger of falling as deeply in love with him as I ever was. I cannot deny these feelings. I have tried to keep them hidden but I cannot control them any longer. I beg of you, sister, just to tell mamma that I am fine and that the journey went well. Do not tell her of my feelings towards Tom. Please destroy this letter as soon as you have read it. I do not wish for anyone else to read it. Yours affectionately, Jane Jane put down her pen and sighed. While writing the letter the feelings she had denied for so long took control over her. She gazed out over the pretty garden, which was just starting to bloom, and saw the eldest of the Lefroy children playing with one of the dogs on the lawn. She wrote the address on the letter and sealed it. She could use some air. She left her room and looked for a servant who could see to that the letter reached the post. She soon found Jones on the ground floor. \"Could you please see to that this letter gets to the post, Jones?\" she asked him. \"Of course, Miss Austen,\" he bowed and took the letter. She went outside to once again enjoy the fine June day. She found Anthony where she had seen him from the window. \"Hello, there, Anthony, is it?\" she said when coming close to him and the black and white pointer. \"Miss Austen,\" he bowed. \"Yes, I am Anthony.\" \"And who is this?\" She bent down to pat the dog. \"This is Bessie.\" Anthony smiled. \"Our most beloved dog.\" \"I see.\" Jane must admit that she knew very little of dogs, but the eyes looked kind and the dog seemed happy enough. \"She had a litter a few weeks ago. Would you like to see her puppies?\" Anthony asked. \"They are in the stable for now.\" He gestured towards another building that was half hidden behind the main house. \"Yes, I would love to,\" Jane said. This was a good way to get to know the boy a little bit more. She had noticed his glances at her at breakfast and could not quite figure out how he felt towards her. She followed him as he led the way to the stables with the dog around them. -xxx- \"So, my dear, now that you have met the woman you so eagerly wants me to spend the rest of my life with. How do you like her?\" Tom asked his wife later that afternoon. He was standing by the window overlooking the gardens and studied his eldest son leading Miss Austen off somewhere. \"I like her very much, Tom. I can see why you would love her. She is a very amiable woman,\" replied his wife. \"You should have known her when she was young.\" He turned to her. \"She still loves you, you know,\" Mary said with a small smile playing on her lips. Tom felt his heart flutter at the remark. \"So?\" he said nonchalantly. \"That does not mean I will marry her.\" \"My dear, sweet Thomas,\" said his wife. \"Why will you not do this one thing I ask of you?\" \"Mary, did you know how remarkably well you looked this morning?\" He changed the subject. \"I felt very well, indeed, but then the coughing and fever came back.\" He looked at her pale cheeks that only this morning had been rosy. \"Miss Austen could not believe what I asked of her. She would scarcely admit to still loving you in fright of making me uncomfortable.\" \"Why do you torment me with this? Mary…\" he said, with begging eyes. \"You know I cannot…\" \"Thomas Langlois Lefroy, I will not hear another word about this,\" Mary said with all the force she could muster. \"It will be as I have said.\" She started coughing and he ran to her side. \"Forgive me, dearest, I did not mean to upset you!\" He cradled her face with soft hands. \"But what will the children say? They do not even know Miss Austen.\" \"There will be plenty of time for them to get to know one another during the years to come.\" Tom sighed. There was no use in arguing with her. \"We shall see. I will not marry someone my children do not approve of.\" \"Jane thinks the world of Miss Austen,\" remarked Mary. \"Jane is not the only one who has a say in this, my dear,\" said Tom. Mary's eyelids slipped down and her body went limp. \"No, Mary!\" He feared he had lost her in the middle of this silly argument. \"I will not let you go, Mary!\" \"I am still here, my love,\" she whispered. \"I will not leave you yet.\" -xxx- Jane Lefroy found her brother and Miss Austen by the puppies in the stables. Miss Austen was sitting with one in her lap. Jane was surprised to see this quite celebrated authoress being so down to earth. She was also happy to see Anthony spending time with Miss Austen. He did not seem that happy with her presence before. But now, there he was, showing the puppies to Miss Austen. If that was not a token of appreciation, Jane knew not what was. At least not when it came to Anthony. \"Jane!\" Anthony looked up form the puppies and smiled at his sister. \"Anthony, I thought I might find you here. Miss Austen, are not these the loveliest of creatures you have ever seen?\" Jane kneeled besides Miss Austen and took one of the puppies in her hands with the outmost of care. \"Yes, they are quite lovely.\" Miss Austen patted the little one she had on her lap. Jane held her puppy up to her face as to breathe in its scent. \"They are so soft,\" Jane mused with her nose in its fur. Anthony laughed at her. \"You should have that one for your birthday!\" Anthony said and Jane almost dropped the puppy with surprise. \"Really? Anthony? For me?\" \"Yes, sister, it is yours if you want it.\" Anthony's face lit up as he saw how happy that made her. Jane was beside herself with happiness. \"What will you call it, Jane?\" Miss Austen asked. Jane looked to see what gender it was, and found that it was indeed a little boy. \"I think I shall call him…\" she pondered for a while, thinking of suitable names for a little male dog. \"What do you think of Edmund?\" She looked up at Miss Austen for her approval of using one of her heroes' names. Miss Austen reached over and patted the dog. \"I think that name will suit him very well, Miss Austen.\" She smiled at Jane. \"Oh, I have to go tell mamma and papa about my gift!\" She put the puppy down gently before running off in search of her father. -xxx- \"That was very sweet of you, Anthony,\" said Jane Austen to him as they watched Miss Lefroy run off to tell the good news to the rest of the family. \"She loves puppies, Miss Austen, and frankly, I have not found any other suitable gift for her since you sent her your latest novel,\" Anthony said. \"Ah, well, I thought she needed something else to think of,\" Jane answered. \"She takes a great deal upon herself, my sister does, Miss Austen.\" \"So I have gathered.\" \"I do not know why my mother has asked you to come here, and I am not sure if I approve of her action, not at this time anyway. But I can see that you have some good influence over my sister, and in some way over my father.\" Anthony looked at her sincerely. \"I have come here because your mother requested me,\" Jane replied, looking equally sincere. \"I do not wish to take your mother's place. I cannot take your mother's place. But as an old close friend of your father's I might be of some help to ease the burden on him, and your sister, and perhaps even on you.\" \"Do not pretend to know what I am going through,\" he suddenly blurted with tears in his eyes. He looked away, equally embarrassed by his tears as by his words. \"I lost my father. I was not as young as you, but he was taken from us before his time,\" Jane said. She did not know how to comfort him. To comfort a young man was beyond her feeble powers. \"I am sorry, Miss Austen. I did not mean…\" his voice was caught in his throat. \"Do not worry, Anthony. It must be hard on you. Being the eldest.\" \"Jane is the one that takes care of everyone else, not me. I hide out here or in the woods. I cannot bear to see my brothers' and sisters' distress. I have not even been to my mother's room for a week. I cannot bear to look at her.\" \"Well, then I suggest you go and visit your mother now, before it is too late,\" Jane said, sensibly. \"She would want to see you before it is too late.\" She rose and so did he. He took her hand. \"Thank you, Miss Austen. I was wrong to judge you before I got to know you. Jane said you were a kind woman.\" She squeezed his hand. He walked off hastily and left her with the puppies. \"I have proven to be of some help at least,\" she said to herself. -TBC-[Chapter 14] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again.

Thank you for all your encouragement! Part14: In which Miss Austen and Mr Lefroy takes tea in the library June, 1814 \"Mamma!\" Jane exclaimed happily as she opened the door to her mother's chamber. \"I have the most wonderful news!\" As she looked over at her mother's bed she saw her father sitting there, looking teary eyed and she froze. She eyed her mother, she looked very pale and very, very still. \"Mamma?\" she whispered with quivering voice. \"Yes, dear?\" came her mother's weak voice and she stirred slightly in her bed. \"Oh, Lord! I thought you…\" Jane could not continue. She threw herself on her mother's bed and made herself comfortable next to her mother. \"No, dear, not yet. I have some business to settle with your father before I leave,\" her mother tried to sound as happy as ever. \"What was the news you wanted to tell me?\" \"It does not matter now,\" Jane whispered and hugged her mother as if it were the last time. \"Tell me,\" her mother patted her head, trying to comfort her. A hesitated knock on the door prevented Jane from continuing. Anthony stuck his head in and peeked at them. \"Are you awake, mamma?\" He came in and sat on the other side of the bed. \"I am sorry I have not visited for while. But I have been busy, looking after Bessie's litter and so.\" \"That is alright, child,\" their mother said with a faint smile. She turned to her husband. \"Maybe you could go and fetch Anne, Jeffry, George and Thomas as well? I would like to see all my children.\" Their father nodded in consent and left the room. \"I gave Jane one of the puppies from Bessie's litter for her birthday,\" Anthony said. \"I am sure she has told you already?\" \"Yes, well, no, I was just about to,\" Jane said with a small smile, peeking up at her mother. She realised that she best be sitting up when the rest of the children came in. The younger children would want to curl up against their mother. \"That is so sweet of you Anthony,\" their mother said appreciatively. \"You will have to help Jane with the training, of course.\" \"Why, of course, mamma!\" \"You will need other things to concentrate on when I am gone,\" she said. Jane felt the tears burn in her eyes and she hugged her mother tightly again before sitting up straight. Anthony took their mother's hands. \"We will do what we must,\" he said. \"Well then, do tell me what you think of Miss Austen!\" Their mother's eyes gleamed with excitement. \"I do not wish to speak of Miss Austen now, mamma!\" Anthony exclaimed. \"There is so much else to talk about! I do not see what all the fuzz is about when it comes to Miss Austen!\" \"Anthony!\" cried Jane who did not want her mother to get anxious. \"It is quite alright, Jane,\" her mother said. \"So you do not like her then?\" Anthony shrugged his shoulders. \"She is fine, I guess. But why is she here? Is she really going to marry papa when you are gone?\" \"Well, I do not know. I would want him to consider her, that is all,\" Mary said. \"He will not marry her if you do not approve. That is why I wanted all my children here to tell me how you like her.\" \"But she has only been here one day,\" Jane objected. \"And Anthony and I are really the only ones who have spent time with her alone.\" \"True,\" acknowledged their mother. \"The trouble is that I do not have that much time left. All I want to know is that you do not dislike her and that you might consider to get closer acquainted with her.\" \"Fine,\" Anthony said. \"I can honestly tell you that I do not dislike her. She seems very kind and was very nice to me. But I do not know her well enough to say anything more than that.\" His mother rewarded him with a small smile. Jane knew that their mother would have her way in the end. -xxx- Jane Austen took one last look at the puppies before turning back to the main house. Since she had not been shown around she walked around in search of a door that would lead to the library. She soon came past a door that was slightly ajar and when she peeked inside she found the four younger children in there. They boys were busy with playing on the floor and Anne was drawing something. \"Hello there,\" Jane said and pushed the door open. Four sets of blue eyes looked up at her. \"God afternoon, Miss Austen,\" said Anne Lefroy, who was the eldest in the room. The boys nodded slightly and went back to playing on the floor. Jane saw that they were building with wooden blocks. They were all very shy children. The eldest two spoke for all of them, Jane suspected. \"What are you drawing?\" Jane asked and sat down next to Anne. \"Oh nothing special,\" Anne replied and looked embarrassed, putting her hands over the drawing. Jane caught a glimpse of a meadow sprinkled with flowers. \"Ah, it is a secret?\" Jane said with a knowing smile. Anne nodded shyly. \"Perhaps for your mother?\" Anne nodded again. \"My sister is very fond of drawing too but I prefer the pianoforte myself. I will leave you to it then. I am sure your mother will be happy to get a nice picture from you.\" The boys were very busy with their building so Jane was just about to leave the children alone when Tom entered the room. \"Miss Austen?\" he said with a surprised look on his face. \"Mr Lefroy,\" she curtseyed. \"I was looking for the library but…\" She did not know what else to say. \"The door was open.\" \"No, do not worry, Miss Austen. It is quite all right. The children will have to get used to your presence.\" He smiled. \"But right now they are wanted by their mother's side. Come along children!\" He ushered them out of the door and then turned to Jane again. \"The library is on the other side of the entrance hall, the last door in that hallway.\" \"Thank you,\" she said and curtseyed. He bowed and left. She left the nursery and went down the hall to the library. The library was spacious and decorated with dark wooden panels, green curtains and stuffed armchairs for reading. It was filled with books, but it was clear that the work was an ongoing progress. She suspected it would be a life's work to fill the library. She walked around amongst the book shelves, drawing in the musty smell of old books and leather. This was his books, selected by him. She let her hand trail a row of books, her fingers caressing the leather bindings. She studied the titles, she found Byron, Shakespeare, herself and Fielding among others. She smiled. Tom's favourite The History or Tom Jones a Foundling by Henry Fielding, or had been when they first met, stood there. He had persuaded her to read it as to 'widen her horizons', as he had put it. She took the novel and skimmed through the well read pages. She had not approved of the novel back then, and to be honest she had never given it another try. She sat down in the leather armchair and started reading it again, recalling how shocked she had been the first time she read it. Now, almost twenty years later she was not as easily shocked. She soon forgot where she was and lost track of time. -xxx- Tom Lefroy returned to his wife's room with the rest of the children. \"Here they all are, my dear,\" he said as he led his children in. Mary looked a bit better now, not as pale as she had when he left the room last. Tom placed himself by the door. \"Thank you, Tom. I want all my children here. Come, come!\" She made room for them in the bed. Jane had placed herself on one of the chairs next to her mother's bed. Anthony sat on the other side. Anne handed her mother a sheet of paper with a drawing on. \"Oh, thank you, Anne dear. What a lovely picture!\" Anne sat down on the bed. \"Miss Austen's sister is also fond of drawing, Miss Austen said,\" Anne whispered. \"Is she now? Have you met Miss Austen?\" \"Yes, just now,\" Anne said shyly. \"How do you like her?\" Mary eyed the children. \"She is very nice, she says she plays the pianoforte,\" Anne said. The boys kept quiet. \"She is a very good musician,\" Jane added. \"She played for us in London.\" \"And you boys? How do you like Miss Austen?\" She looked at her younger sons. They were sitting at the end of the bed and looking at everything else but their mother. They shrugged their shoulders. \"Are you really going to leave us, mamma?\" Thomas asked. \"I am afraid I am, my dears,\" Mary replied. \"Who will look after us?\" asked Anne. Tom exchanged a quick glance with his wife. \"I am of course,\" Tom said. The children looked at him with large eyes. \"But who will be our mamma?\" Jeffry asked. \"I will still be your mother. Only not here, but I will look down on you from heaven, to make sure everything is all right.\" Mary coughed slightly. Tom was glad she didn't mention Miss Austen. That would only make things more complicated and harder for the younger children to comprehend. \"I will look after you,\" Jane said. \"Perhaps with a little help from a certain lady.\" Tom shot her a warning glance. He did not want to have another incident as the one at the breakfast table. If the children were to get to know Miss Austen it would be because they wanted to, not because their parents made them. He did not want them to be forced into accepting her. He was quite sure they would like her. One thing he was certain of was that nothing should be done to encourage Miss Austen until Mary had passed away. He already felt unfaithful as it was, just thinking of Miss Austen. The whole situation was tearing him apart. His emotions were playing tricks with his mind and he found it hard to think sensibly. He left his children and wife alone for the time being. He would say his good byes later. This time was for their children. He decided to take his tea in the library where he hoped to find Miss Austen. \"Millie,\" he stopped the maid who was coming down the hall. \"I will take my tea in the library as soon as you can manage it.\" \"Yes, sir,\" she curtseyed and turned to go to the kitchen. \"Oh, and Millie?\" \"Yes, sir?\" She turned back to him. \"Please include a cup for Miss Austen as well?\" \"Of course, sir.\" The girl left him. He found Miss Austen sitting in his favourite reading armchair. Her head rested against the back of the armchair and the book she was holding was slowly leaving her grasp. Her eyes were closed and her dark lashes rested against her pale cheeks. She had dozed off. He was wondering what she had been reading and he crept closer, as silent as he could, not to wake her. He was a bit surprised to find that the book she had been reading was Tom Jones . He smiled as he recalled how he had suggested that she needed to read that book. He still remembered her shocked look when he recited Mr. White's Natural History . But who could blame her? It was most disturbing to read about a mating ritual, especially out loud to a young woman. He studied her for a while. She looked very peaceful. He heard the door open behind him, he turned and found Millie coming in with a tray of refreshments. He gestured to her to keep quiet. \"Here you go, sir,\" she whispered and out the tray down carefully at the table in front of him. Tom sat down in the armchair opposite the one Miss Austen was slumbering in, wondering whether he should wake her up or let her sleep. It had been a long day and she had been up for quite a while. She had been travelling a great distant on his wife's demand of course she would be exhausted. But the tea was getting cold. Tom cleared his throat to see if that would wake her up. No reaction. He hawked a bit louder, but still nothing. He coughed quite loud, but she was still far away in dreaming. \"Miss Austen?\" he whispered. He rose and walked over to her and put a hand on her shoulder. \"Miss Austen?\" Still no response. He shook her shoulder gently. Her eyelids fluttered and soon a pair of beautiful hazel eyes looked up at him, looking very dazed and confused as if unsure where she was. Her cheeks turned red as she realised that she had fallen asleep. \"Mr Lefroy,\" she said and sat up properly, straightening her appearance. \"Is it common conduct to fall a sleep in other people's libraries in Hampshire?\" he asked with an amused smile. She blinked up at him, trying to understand what he was saying. \"Or is Fielding not as interesting anymore?\" \"I…\" she stammered. \"Oh come, Jane, no harm done. Do not fret yourself. You have had a long week. No one ever comes in here apart from me and sometimes Jane.\" \"I see.\" She averted her eyes. She smoothed out invisible creases on her dress. She looked really uncomfortable. \"Well, how about some tea?\" Tom said briskly as to lighten up the awkwardness and gestured towards the table with refreshments. Miss Austen smiled slightly. \"Yes, why not?\" \"How do you find my library then, Jane?\" \"I like it very much, Mr Lefroy,\" she answered and Tom frowned. \"I thought we had agreed on calling each other by our Christian names?\" \"Of course, Tom,\" Jane said and blushed even more. He handed her a cup of tea, their fingers accidentally brushed against each other. A jolt went through his body. He took his hand away as soon as he could without dropping the cup. \"Thank you.\" Jane gazed up into his eyes, she must have felt it too. Tom sat down in the leather armchair on the other side of the table. On safe distance, he could not trust himself around her. \"So, tell me Jane. How do you find Tom Jones now?\" \"Still flawed. But I think I have seen more of the world now not to be as shocked I was then.\" She smiled. \"And how do you like the mistress of the house, now that you have met her?\" he studied her intensely. \"She is a very amiable woman. Remarkably unselfish. You did well, Tom,\" she said. \"You could not have found more suitable wife.\" \"Yes, I have been blessed indeed,\" he smiled. She took a sip of her tea and looked down. He wondered if she was thinking the same as he. Jane Austen would probably not have been a suitable wife for a man in his position in the past. Not then perhaps, but what about now? -TBC-[Chapter 15] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again.

Author's note: Once again I'd like to thank you for all your kind reviews. It means the world to me! Part 15: In which Miss Austen takes ill Jane Austen felt confused as she opened her eyes. At first she did not know where she was. She had heard her name being called from far away followed by someone shaking her shoulder. She then realised she had fallen asleep in Tom's library. She looked up right into his radiant blue eyes. He had an amused look on his face and asked if it was common conduct to fall asleep in other people's libraries in Hampshire. She felt utterly ashamed. But he was being a gentleman about it and poured her a nice cup of tea and talked about other matters. Her fingers still tingled from his touch. The contact of their fingertips had sent a jolt through her body and she was sure he had felt it too. Her body shivered and she barely knew where to look. To have tea with him in his library felt so intimate. It was obviously his pride and joy, apart from his children of course. \"And how do you like the mistress of the house, now that you have met her?\" She felt his eyes on her. The question startled her. \"She is a very amiable woman. Remarkably unselfish. You did well, Tom,\" she said sincerely. \"You could not have found more suitable wife.\" I would not have been as suitable . A penniless authoress would have stopped his career. She saw that now. \"Yes, I have been blessed indeed,\" he smiled. She took a sip of her tea and looked down. Jane was struck with envy. All this could have been hers. She could have been mistress of this house. But then again, their life would not have turned out like this. Not with a high court judge as their enemy. That was what she had realised that day at the inn. She would have brought ruin, not only to herself and him, but also to his family. But what about now? So much had changed since then. He was now a wealthy independent man and she was an independent woman. Who knew what the future might bring. \"Yes, quite,\" she mumbled. She found it hard to meet his gaze. She was afraid of what emotions her eyes might show him. The accidental touch of his fingertips had awakened feelings in her that she had not experienced in years. It was quite improper to long for another woman's man, even if she had given her blessing. Mary Lefroy was not gone yet and before she did nothing could happen. And even after her passing she could not be sure of what would happen. Tom might not feel the same as her, even if Mary seemed to think so. Then there were the six children. Tom would not do anything without their approval, of that she was certain. -xxx- Being this close to Jane Austen did not make things any easier for Tom Lefroy. He was even more confused now than he had been before. Why did I have to have tea with her in the library? It would have been so much safer to take tea in the drawing room where the servants where close by all the time. There was no turning back now, however. He should have thought of it before he made Millie serve his tea in the library. Nevertheless, they were old friends and should be able to interact as rational people. They were not star-eyed youngsters anymore. Yet all he could think of at present was how it had felt to have her in his arms. He feared he was becoming the love-sick whelp his uncle had once accused him of being. Then Mary's pale face flickered before his eyes and he was brought back to his senses. As long as she was with them he was to stay as far away as he possibly could from Miss Jane Austen. \"There is really no hope for Mrs Lefroy?\" Jane asked all of a sudden. \"No, none I am told by my physician. He does not know what else to do now but ease her pain and coughing.\" \"But she seemed fine this morning.\" \"She has her ups and downs, I suppose. Sometimes I wonder if she is clinging on to life just to have her way before she leaves,\" Tom smiled vacantly. \"I see,\" Jane mumbled. He had to admit that he had hoped for a miracle in secret. She had looked so well this morning. But he realised it was only one of her good days. Tom took a sip of his tea that was now nearly cold. He frowned. \"I cannot promise you anything,\" he said silently. \"I am sorry, what?\" Jane looked up at him with a puzzled face. \"After Mary is gone. I cannot tell you what will happen. I cannot promise you anything.\" He looked into her eyes. Wanting her to understand how torn he was. \"I know.\" She looked down at her hands that were vacantly playing with some invisible creases in her dress. \"I am not asking anything of you, Tom. I am a grown woman. I am quite capable of taking care of myself.\" \"I am sure...\" \"You must not think I came here in search of something other than being a friend in this time of need,\" cried she before he could finish the sentence. \"Now, if you will excuse me.\" She rose and looked straight into his eyes. He could see the tears that threatened to fill her eyes. \"Of course,\" he said and rose as well. \"I have a terrible headache. God day, Mr Lefroy!\" She hurried out of the library before he could do anything to stop her. Tom sat and looked after her long after the door had closed behind her well built figure. He was sure he had seen a tear slipping down her cheek. Jane Austen did not come down for dinner that night. Tom had his dinner in solitude since the children had already eaten. Tom spent of his time wondering why Jane had become so upset. Surely she must understand my dilemma and the situation I am caught in? -xxx- Jane Austen really did have a headache and she was lying in bed in hope of the throbbing to stop. Tom had been considerate enough not to let anyone disturb her other than sending Millie up with a bowl of soup and a glass of good strong wine. She relived the time spent with Tom in the library. Her body had still not recovered completely after the accidental touch. Jane questioned her decision to come rushing to Tom's side. What was I thinking? Did I really think he would throw himself in my open arms? \"I should not have come,\" she whispered to the dark room. Jane made a decision then and there to leave Limerick as soon as Mary Lefroy's funeral was done. After the funeral there was not really any call for her presence anymore. She did not want to force herself upon anyone and she could not really impose on their privacy during the grieving period. Jane did not feel any better the day after and therefore stayed in her room. She did not dare meet Tom now anyway. That would probably make her change her mind again. She told the maid to tell her master that she was still experiencing a fierce headache and that she would not join them today. -xxx- Jane Lefroy and her siblings had spent most of the evening in her mother's chamber the night before. Speaking of this and that, small and large matters of life. They had been allowed to have their supper by her bed. Jane still found it hard to believe that her mother really was dying. She seemed to be as healthy as ever, as happy as she had always been and so full of life. Of course it showed after a while that she was really not well. She grew paler and weaker by the hour they spent in there. The commotion was wearing her out. Jane only met her father very briefly that night as he took her and her sibling's place by their mother's side. The younger children had fallen asleep and their mother was soon following their example. She thought he looked very absentminded and she wondered what he had been up to while they were in with their mother. Probably shut up in his study or library. Jane did not dare ask before she went up to her room. Jane had slept ill that night. Her head was filled with worries about the future and especially what was going to happen after their mother had died. Her father did not seem to warm to the idea of marrying Miss Austen. Jane thought it was a very good solution. She was sure he still had feelings for Miss Austen. She had seen the way he was looking at her when he thought no one was watching. She was quite certain her mother would have her way in the end. Jane Lefroy was sad to hear that Miss Austen was feeling ill. She had not seen her since the morning before and really wanted to speak to her, but her father forbid her to visit Miss Austen in her room. She saw how concerned and worried he looked and did as she was told. -xxx- When Miss Austen still kept to her room after two days Tom thought it best to consult his physician Mr Barrington. Millie had told him that she had not touched the food she had brought up for her and that Miss Austen looked very pale indeed. She had complained over a severe headache and on top of that a sore throat. Tom would not have it any other way than to let Mr Barrington tend to her. Regardless of what ever Miss Austen might say of a mere cold. Miss Austen had assured Millie that she would be back on her feet in a day or two. Tom was afraid she had caught whatever infection it was that made Mary ill. He would not have that on his conscience. His wife was also rapidly becoming worse. She had had two good days just as Miss Austen arrived but was now rarely conscious. He could see her languish away before his eyes. The children were not allowed in her chamber any more since he wanted them to remember their mother as a healthy woman full of life. He was very relieved when Mr Barrington came to the conclusion that Miss Austen just had a cold and nothing else. She would be up and about in no time. Tom was so relieved to hear the news that he hurried to her room without thinking. He just had to see her. \"Miss Austen,\" he said as he knocked on the door to her chamber. \"Yes,\" came her rather hoarse response. \"May I come in?\" \"Yes, of course.\" He entered and found that she was sitting up in bed. She was still looking rather pale. \"How are you feeling? Mr Barrington assured me it was only a cold,\" he said with a bright smile. \"I told the maid that,\" she said with a shadow of a smile on her face. \"My throat is still a bit sore though. But the headache is gone.\" \"Shall I ring for tea? A nice cup of tea with honey might do wonders,\" he said and ringed the bell for Millie. \"Yes, thank you, that is very kind of you.\" Millie came before long with a tray filled with different biscuits, a tea pot and a jar of honey. \"I thought you might be hungry, Miss,\" she said with a curtsey and left the room. \"She is a keeper,\" Jane smiled. Tom watched her with great amusement as she ate biscuit after biscuit. -xxx- For the first time since she left Tom in the library Jane Austen felt hungry. She let Tom help her out of bed and to the table by the window where Millie and put the refreshments. She took a biscuit and ate with great appetite. \"I really was hungry. I have not eaten since our tea in the library,\" she said and suddenly blushed as she remembered how she had left the library in a hurry. \"I am so sorry for being a burden to you.\" \"No, think nothing of it, Jane!\" he objected. \"You are under my roof now and quite in my hands.\" Jane blushed even more of the thought of being in his hands. \"Send my regards to Mr Barrington and thank him for me. But as I said, it was a mere cold.\" She offered him a smile. \"One cannot be too sure,\" replied Tom. \"I was worried you had...\" his voice was caught in his throat. \"You thought I had gotten the same illness as your wife,\" Jane finished for him. He nodded silently. She took a sip of her tea. The honey was soothing the soreness in her throat almost instantly. She gazed vacantly out of the window and over the garden. She would miss this when she left. -TBC-[Chapter 16] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again.

Disclaimer: I do not own Jane Austen, Tom Lefroy or any other character in this story. Facts are taken from the Becoming Jane Fansite. Author's note: Looking back I realise that I should have let Miss Austen be ill a while longer, but I am not that wicked. Happy Easter, my dear readers. This is my gift to you! Part 16: In which Mr Lefroy has a revelation but Miss Austen is lost in the rain \"Miss Austen has not been here to visit me since her second day here,\" said his wife to Tom when he visited her after making sure Miss Austen was feeling better. \"No, she has been ill,\" he replied. \"Nothing serious, I hope?\" Mary asked with a worried face. \"No, just a cold,\" he assured her. \"She will probably visit you as soon as she feels it appropriate.\" \"I would so like to see her before I go,\" she said weakly. Her condition was getting worse every minute now. There was no way to deny what was coming any longer. Tom was going to lose his wife and it was only a matter of days before it happened. He was glad that the children had been with her that last good day. That was a great memory for them. \"I will see to it, my dear,\" Tom promised. \"Could you bring me a pen and paper?\" Mary asked. \"What for?\" \"I want to write down something for the children and for you. My last will and testament.\" \"Mary, dear, there is no need for that, is it?\" Tom looked at his wife with pain written all over his face. \"I want to, Tom. I need to get some things down on paper,\" Mary replied. \"I want my children to have something of me left. Not just the memories. \" \"Do you want me to fetch someone who can help you with this?\" \"I think I can manage on my own. But if I find it difficult I will send for help myself,\" Mary said. \"I will send Millie with what you need,\" Tom said and quitted the room after one last look at his wife's pale face. He once again wondered how he should manage without her in his life. How their children would take to growing up without a mother. What was to become of them all? -xxx- Mr Barrington had advised her to remain in bed for at least another day but when the next morning dawned Jane Austen felt as if she was bursting with energy. To remain motionless in bed was not an option. The day that was wakening outside looked as promising as her first morning in the house. The morning she had spent with Tom. Jane smiled to herself. She was already dressed when Millie came in with her breakfast. \"Good morning, Miss Austen,\" Millie said and put the tray down at the table. \"I am glad to see you up and about.\" \"Thank you, Millie. I am feeling quite well this morning,\" Jane answered with a smile. \"I am sure my master will be happy to hear of your improvement. He looked so worried the other day.\" Millie's face turned red as she realised that she had spoke more than was appropriate for a young maid. \"I am sorry, Miss. I should not have said that.\" \"That is quite alright,\" Jane said reassuringly. \"How is your mistress?\" \"Not well at all, I am afraid, Miss,\" Millie replied with a worried look on her face. \"I am so worried about the poor, poor children. To be motherless at such a young age.\" Millie shook her blond head. \"I am sure Mr Lefroy will do what he think is the best for them,\" Jane said. \"Yes, of course, Miss,\" Millie said, again realising she had stepped out of her place. \"If there is nothing else, I will leave you now, before I say something else that I am not supposed to, Miss.\" Millie curtseyed and left Jane alone with her breakfast. She was very hungry and ate the porridge with great appetite. She drank her tea and wondered what she was going to do next. She could not stay in her room with such a nice day outside to be enjoyed. After finishing everything eatable on the tray she hastily took a decicion and went downstairs for a walk. Jane descended the stairs and found the house quiet. The family was nowhere to be seen and she exited the house hastily in case anyone was going to try to stop her. She had no intentions to be sent back to bed. She could not bear another day in her room. Once again she drew in the fresh June-air and felt it fill her lunges. She felt alive. She strolled slowly down to the little wilderness and gathering of trees where Tom and she had walked the other day. She admired the gardens and stopped to smell some roses as she came past them. She could easily imagine herself living there, being the mistress of the house and care for this garden. She had to remind herself of that once the funeral was over she was not going to be there anymore. She sighed. She was once again going to give up the love of her life. She would be sorry to leave this beautiful serene place. She would be sorry to leave the family, but she did not see any other way. Jane could not stay there without hurting herself. Her heart was heavy and tears started to slowly flow down her cheeks. She was so tired of being sensible but she did not see how this would turn out in her favour. The only one who could make her change her mind was Tom. She would only stay if he asked her to himself. -xxx- \"Have you seen Miss Austen?\" Tom asked when he met Millie outside of Miss Austen's room. \"No, sir. Is she not in her room?\" Millie asked. \"No, it seems as if she is not. She is not answering when I knocked.\" \"Maybe she is asleep,\" Millie suggested. \"But she was up and dressed when I brought Miss Austen breakfast this morning, sir.\" \"I thought Mr Barrington had ordered her to stay in bed for at least one more day,\" Tom said with a concerned face. \"Miss Austen said she felt much better. And she did look quite well, sir.\" Tom felt relieved, even though Mr Barrington had assured him that it was nothing other than a mere cold Miss Austen had caught, he had been worried sick. Millie must have seen his relieved look. \"I should have told master sooner but I have not had the time, sir.\" She made an apologetic curtsey. \"It is good that I found out now, Millie. Thank you.\" \"Maybe she has gone to the library or outside?\" Millie suggested. \"You are probably right, Millie,\" Tom said and shot her a thankful smile, wondering why he had not thought of that himself. Tom hurried down to the library but found it empty. He felt a sudden urge to see her. He had not seen her at all since yesterday and now he was beginning to feel slightly worried. If she had gone out on her own, anything could have happened. She could have overestimated her strength and fallen down somewhere. He cursed himself for not asking Millie what Miss Austen was wearing. He had no idea of what he was looking for. He did not even want to think of what could have happened to her. He exited the house in haste, looking around wildly to see if he could see something that resembled Miss Austen. He stopped Jones who was coming from the stables. \"Jones! Have you seen Miss Austen?\" \"No, sir, I have not,\" the man answered. \"Damn it!\" Tom cursed and hurried on. He knew she was fond of long walks but she had just been ill. He gazed out over the garden and suddenly right at the bottom he saw something red flicker in the breeze. He prayed for it not to be Miss Austen. He ran as fast as he thought fit for a man of his age and situation in life. He did not want to draw too much attention to himself. He reached the red cloth he had seen and found that it was her shawl. He picked it up and looked around very anxiously to find the owner. \"Miss Austen?\" he called out, but there was no answer. Where could she be? She did not know the terrain and it could be traitorous to one who had not walked there before. He was almost beside himself with worry. Where is she? Then it dawned on him. He loved her. The revelation struck with full power and he nearly laughed out loud. He had been a fool to fight his feelings for so long. Mary had been right. If he could not have Mary then who else would be most suitable to be his companion for the rest of his life but Miss Austen? -xxx- Jane Austen wandered aimlessly onward, out of the boundaries of the garden and on to the field beyond. Tears blurred her vision and she barely knew where she was putting her feet. She dried her tears with her hands, but there was no end to them. Her shawl had fallen somewhere along the walk, but the day was warm and she did not really care. She just wanted to be away from the prying eyes of others with her sorrow. After a while she realised she was lost. She looked around and did not see any familiar sites only acres of acres of rolling hills. No houses, no people, nothing. She felt she had exerted herself too soon after her illness and she sank to the ground. Everything felt hopeless in that moment. The tears started flowing again. -xxx- Tom Lefroy was really worried now. He had thought he would find her on the field just beyond his garden but she was nowhere in sight. Suddenly the sun was gone and he looked up at the sky and saw dark clouds gathering on the horizon. He had to find her before the rain came. \"Miss Austen,\" he called again of the top of his lunges. \"Jane?\" He twirled around looking for her but the field was empty. I cannot lose her too! How far could one woman who had just been ill walk? He started running again, calling her name repeatedly as he went. He did not even know where to look for her. The sky was really darkening fast now and he could smell the humid scent of rain from far away. Tom regretted that he had not asked Jones to come with him in search of Miss Austen, but there was no time to lose in returning to the house to fetch the man now. He had to find her before it was too late. He wanted to tell her how wrong he had been and how much he still loved her. -xxx- Jane Austen gazed up at the sky and found it dark and threatening. She realised she had to find her way back to the house. She rose just as the first raindrops fell on her head. It started as a soft and sweet summer rain but soon it hit with full power. She could hear the thunder gathering force from beyond the hills and she was starting to feel frightened. Her dress was completely soaked and she started to shiver. She looked around trying to find her way in the rain. Since she had not been paying much attention to where she was going she was completely lost. She knew her best shot was to keep moving towards what she thought was the right way. It was raining hard now, making it even harder to see any familiar sights. Jane had to admit that she would not be able to find her way in this weather and started searching for shelter. She remembered vaguely that she had seen a gathering of trees somewhere that would probably shield her from the worst rain. But in what direction? She twirled around in the rain looking for the trees, but saw nothing but grey rain. The thunder came closer and closer and the sky was lit up by lightening. Trees were not safe in a thunderstorm, Jane knew that much. What was she to do? -TBC- Happy Easter, my dear readers.

This story has taken a few turns that even I did not plan… But perhaps two or three more are to be expected, if the story decides to stay the way I have planned it. Part 17: In which Mr Lefroy comes to the rescue and Miss Austen finds her way home Tom Lefroy was completely beside himself with worry. He still had not found Miss Austen and the rain kept on falling, more heavily by the minute. The thunder was moving closer and the sky was lit up by lightening more often than not. She did not know her way. How far could she have gone? How long had she been walking? Tom had no idea. What had she been thinking, taking off like that, with out a word to anyone? Tom was completely soaked but he kept on going. He could not stop now. He vacantly wondered if Jones would be clever enough to follow his master when he saw the rain. He really hoped so. He continued calling her name but still did not get any answer. Not much was heard over the thunderstorm and rain. What was he to do? How could she have been so stupid? Headstrong foolish woman. Tom continued on into the next field. He thought he saw some movement about a hundred yards away and hurried over there, but found that he had been mistaken. He was all alone on the field. He was near frantic now. He had to find her. He turned around in utter bewilderment, almost knocking himself over. \"Jane!\" he called out again with a voice filled with distress. -xxx- Jane Austen was walking in circles. She could not find her way but kept on going in hope of stumble on the right way. She did not know for how long she had been walking that made it even harder for her to find her way. More than once she slipped and fell on the slippery grass and mud. She had fallen down so many times that she was completely covered in mud. She always rose again and continued walking. She was afraid that she would never see any of the Lefroys again. \"Help!\" she shouted in case anyone would hear her. She hoped that she would not fall so bad that she sprained her ankle or hit her head. Jane was exhausted and did not know for how long she would be able to continue walking. But she was determined to find her way back home. She thought she had figured out which way she had been coming from and walked in that direction. She cursed herself for not telling anyone that she had gone out. Why had she wanted to be so independent? Just because she did not wanted to be sent back to her bed? They would not even know where to begin to look for her, did they even know that she was missing? She was overwhelmed by distress and she felt helplessly exhausted and was ready to just lie down and cry when she heard her name being called from somewhere beyond the rain. \"I am here!\" she cried. \"Help!\" She started running towards the voice. \"Jane?\" She could hear it weakly through the rain, but it was not a mistake. Someone was calling her name. \"Tom?\" she was sure it was Tom's voice. She hoped her mind was not toying with her. She hurried on. \"Tom!\" \"Jane!\" She heard his voice nearer now. \"Where are you?\" She ran as fast as she could in her soaked dress. Suddenly her feet slipped in the mud and she tumbled down, feeling her ankle twist. She shrieked and then everything went black. -xxx- Tom was very relieved when he heard Jane Austen's voice coming through the rain. \"I am here! Help!\" He hurried towards the sound of her voice. He could still not see her for the rain. \"Jane?\" \"Tom? Tom!\" her voice sounded quite near now and he started running towards it. \"Jane! Where are you?\" He called. Suddenly he heard her shriek followed by a splashing sound. She must have fallen. \"Jane!\" he called again but this time there was no answer. \"No! Jane! I am coming!\" He ran as fast as he could without falling himself and found her at the bottom of the little hill, quite unconscious and with blood coming from the side of her head. \"Jane?\" He threw himself down beside her and wiped her face with her shawl, which he still was holding. Since the shawl was wet it did not help as much as he had wanted, but most of the mud was gone. She must have hit a stone. He caressed her face and inspected the cut. It was not as deep as he had feared but she was bleeding quite heavily. He pressed the shawl against the wound. Her eyelids flickered and her hazel eyes looked up at him. \"Tom,\" she whispered with a shadow of a smile on her face. \"Jane,\" he breathed. He had thought for sure he had lost her. \"It is going to be alright. I am here.\" \"Oh, Tom,\" she breathed. \"I thought I would never see you again!\" She looked so relieved to see him that he almost kissed her. \"I thought I had lost you, Jane,\" he said almost choking on his words, caressing her face. \"It is not me you should be worried about,\" she said and her face became serious as she regained her senses. She tried to sit up. \"Lie still!\" He ordered, wondering what she meant by it was not her he should be worried about. \"You have hit your head. You could have a concussion.\" \"I am quite fine,\" she said and sat up, just to fall down again in the next second. Tom caught her just in time. \"You are not fine.\" He stared down in her lovely eyes and brushed the dark hair out of her eyes. \"Please, return to the house and be with your wife,\" Jane said with tears falling from her eyes. \"You should be with her, not me.\" \"Jane, what are you saying?\" Jane was his main concern right now, not Mary. He wondered why the two women in his life kept pushing him in the other woman's arms. \"Tom, just return to your house and send someone to help me back.\" \"I am not leaving you here, Jane. That is completely out of the question. Not in this weather. And not with that wound in your head!\" The rain had started to slow down, but it still dripped down on them. But the sky was lighting up and the thunder had moved away again. \"You must.\" Jane averted her eyes. \"I will not let you go again! I cannot lose you too,\" he cried heatedly. He almost said 'I love you', but decided against it. This was not the time to declare his love for her. Not when she kept telling him to leave her to go to be with his wife. \"You must not say that,\" Jane whispered and stared at a point behind him. Tom turned and found that Jones had indeed been clever enough to come to their rescue. \"Master!\" Jones exclaimed as he saw them on the wet ground. \"Good man, Jones!\" Tom answered. \"Go fetch Mr Barrington! I am sure he will be around. Tell him that Miss Austen has taken a nasty fall and hit her head. And make haste!\" \"Yes, sir.\" Jones scurried off again and Tom and Jane were alone once more. -xxx- Jane's head was aching and her body shivering in her wet dress. She tried to make Tom leave her be and go be with his dying wife. But he would not listen. It was so inappropriate for him to be with her in this manner. To hurry out to rescue another woman. What would people think? That Jane had come there to steal Tom Lefroy from his dying wife? Hopefully not, but there would be talk. She really had to leave. \"Just leave me here, Tom. Mr Barrington and Jones will take me back to the house,\" she said. \"And I am telling you, Miss Austen, I am not leaving you here,\" Tom said with a resolute tone in his voice. Jane pursed her lips shut and refused to say another word until the other two gentlemen arrived. Her head was throbbing more and more and she felt slightly nauseous. Tom eyed her cautiously but stayed quiet. Jones soon returned with Mr Barrington hurrying after him with a bag in his hand. The rain had stopped completely now and the sky was almost clear. \"What have we here? Did I not tell Miss Austen to stay in her bed?\" Mr Barrington said in mildly lecturing tone. Jane answered with a mild smile but said nothing. \"Walking in this kind of weather? Oh dear. Let us take a look at the wound first. Are you hurt somewhere else, Miss Austen?\" The physician took Tom's place by her side and removed the shawl. \"My right foot,\" replied Jane weakly. Mr Barrington nodded but started inspecting her head first. \"The cut is not as nasty as one might think.\" Jane could hear Tom's sigh of relief. Mr Barrington took out bandages and something to clean the wound with. \"Are you nauseous? Dizzy? Headache?\" \"All of the above,\" she smiled faintly. \"I fear a slight concussion. Best get you back to bed, Miss Austen. Perhaps Jones…?\" \"I will take her,\" Tom cut in. \"You did the right thing to stay with Miss Austen, Mr Lefroy. Blows to the head are often followed by concussion and the patient must not be left alone.\" Tom smiled triumphantly at Jane who just frowned meekly back. She had no more strength left to argue with him. \"I am just glad that Jones here arrived when he did.\" Mr Barrington felt her right foot and announced that nothing was broken. \"Let us get Miss Austen to the house then,\" Mr Barrington said briskly and Tom scoped her up in his arms as if she weighed absolutely nothing. Jane could not help but feel protected and safe in his arms. She felt like she had come home. She put her arms around his neck to ease the burden a bit. To be this close to him did not help her in her situation. She had to remain sane. \"How is Mrs Lefroy, Mr Barrington?\" she asked just to stay focused. \"She is getting weaker and weaker, Miss Austen. But she bears it with such composure,\" replied the physician. \"I hope I have the time to meet her again before…\" she did not finish the sentence. \"You are to stay in your bed for the time being, Miss Austen. But I will tell her that you asked when I visit her later. Both you and Mr Lefroy need to get out of those wet clothes and into bed as to not catch another cold.\" They reached the house where Millie and the children waited watching the little procession coming over the lawn. \"Miss Austen!\" cried Jane Lefroy. \"Are you alright?\" She hurried over. \"You are all wet!\" she exclaimed with wide eyes. \"She will be just fine,\" said Mr Barrington and made way for Tom and Jane. \"She needs to get out of these clothes and into dry ones and then directly to bed.\" The last part was directed to Millie who hurried in and up to Jane's room. Tom took her up the stairs and into her room. Jane could not help but feel embarrassed for making such a spectacle of herself. First getting ill and now wandering off and getting caught in a thunderstorm. Then falling down and hitting her head so bad that she was once again ordered to stay in bed. Tom put her down gently on the bed and took her face in his hands, staring into her eyes. \"You will never, ever, wander off alone without telling anyone, Miss Austen. Is that clear?\" \"Yes, Mr Lefroy. Quite so.\" \"I do not know what I would have done if the fall had been worse or if I had not been there to find you. Do you realise how worried I was?\" Tom started pacing the room. \"But I am fine now,\" Jane objected, feeling like a naughty child being lectured. Millie entered the room with hot water bottles for Jane's bed. She put them under the covers and left the room again. \"Jane,\" Tom said and turned to her. \"I cannot lose you again.\" \"Tom,\" she said, looking up at him sadly. \"I must go back home eventually.\" \"No,\" Tom said but Millie came back with blankets. \"Mr Barrington says that Mr Lefroy should get out of his wet clothes and into bed,\" Millie said. \"And Miss Austen really needs to get out of hers and be put to bed and rest.\" \"Fine,\" Tom sighed. \"I will come back to check on you soon, Miss Austen.\" He bowed before quitting the room. \"As stubborn as they come, my master is,\" Millie said. \"Right you are, Millie,\" Jane agreed. She was beginning to realise that leaving after the funeral might not be as easy as she had thought. -xxx- Tom got out of his clothes as fast as he could. He realised how close he had been to losing Jane Austen today. He did not think she even realised how worried he had been for her. Now she was talking about going back home. He could not let that happen. Not before he had a chance to tell her how he felt. As he was all dressed again he went to his wife's room. Mr Barrington was there, checking up on her. \"I thought I told Millie to tell you to go to bed, Mr Lefroy?\" the physician said. \"I had to see Mary,\" Tom said. Mary lay very still in her bed. \"It might be my last chance.\" Mr Barrington nodded in consent. \"I will give you some privacy,\" Mr Barrington said and left the room. Tom sat down at Mary's side. \"Mary, dear?\" he whispered. Her eyelids fluttered and soon her blue eyes looked up at him. \"Tom, dearest,\" she whispered with a faint smile. \"You are wet?\" She drew her hand through his still wet hair. \"Miss Austen got lost in the rain,\" he said simply. \"And you rescued her?\" Excitement gleamed in her eyes. \"Excellent.\" \"She fell and, well, yes, I did rescue her. I am sorry, but she has a concussion and will not be able to visit you for another couple of days, my dear.\" \"That is alright. I have written her a letter if she does not come before…\" She coughed. \"I put them in the chest for safe keeping until I am gone, Tom. Make sure that everyone gets their letter.\" \"Of course, Mary.\" Tom looked at his wife with great despair. \"I was so scared that I was going to lose both of you today,\" he said truthfully. \"Have you finally come to your senses, my dear?\" asked his wife with an amused smile. \"Perhaps. But I am not sure that Miss Austen has.\" \"Oh, but she will, my dear. She will,\" his wife said knowingly. Her eyelids fell down and she coughed a little. \"I am glad that you will have such a remarkable woman in your life, Thomas Langlois Lefroy.\" -TBC- Did I update soon enough? Did I leave you with another cliff hanger? Yes I did… Sorry, but I couldn't help myself.[Chapter 18] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again. They begin questioning their actions and choices in the past (i.e. from the time they met in 1795 and forward).This is what could have happened if the movie had not ended. Disclaimer: I do not own Jane Austen, Tom Lefroy or any other character in this story. Facts are taken from the Becoming Jane Fansite. Author's note: Yes, I admit I am just a tiny bit evil in leaving you with cliff hangers. Nevertheless, words of encouragement make me write faster... And cliff hangers tend to generate reviews... So without further ado; here's chapter 18. Part 18: In which Mr Lefroy makes sure Miss Austen feels at home Jane Austen did not become ill again after her adventure in the thunderstorm. Millie watched her like a hawk so that she did not leave her bed before Mr Barrington had given his consent. Mr Barrington himself checked on her twice a day for three days before she was allowed to even leave her bed. Tom was also visiting her often. Jane felt quite well and did not care much for being waited on day and night. She thought it better that they turned those attentions towards poor Mrs Lefroy instead. She was the one who really needed their tender care. But when she pointed that out she found that she spoke before deaf ears. \"Master's orders,\" was the answer Millie gave her. Jane sighed, there was no point in arguing and she tried to be an obliging patient. To be honest, she did like the attention. Even the children had turned their attentions to Jane since their mother was too ill to be allowed any visitors other than her husband and physician. Anne brought her little drawings, Jane books and the boys, well the younger bought her things from the garden, but were very shy and hid most of the time behind their sisters and elder brothers. Anthony brought one of the puppies with him. All and all, Jane Austen felt accepted by the children. They were too honest to feign to like her. Suddenly her decision to leave after the funeral seemed like a very bad idea. How could she leave them when they clearly needed her the most? -xxx- Tom Lefroy was happy that neither he nor Jane had taken ill after their adventure in the rain. He made it very clear to both Mr Barrington and Millie that Miss Austen should be cared for as if she was part of the family. She was also not to be let out of bed too early this time. Tom made sure that his orders were obeyed by visiting Jane as often as he saw fit without rising suspicions of his motives. He just wanted to make sure Jane felt at home. He was also happy to see that his children had found their way into her chamber, bringing her small trinkets and tokens of their appreciation. Surely that would change her mind about going home. He would not hear her talk like that. She could not leave now, not ever if he had something to say about it. He could understand her uneasiness. She did not want to be a burden to them or impose on them. But if she only could see that there was no other place for her than by his side… Only Tom did not know how to make her come to that conclusion. He did not dare tell her how he felt until he was certain she felt the same. Mary was still sure that Jane did love him. \"How can a woman not love a man who saves her and carries her in his arms to his home?\" she asked as he sat with her one evening. \"My dearest Mary, I do not understand why you insist on her loving me? I am quite sure she does not.\" \"She said so when I asked. Have you asked her?\" she demanded to know. \"You know very well I have not asked her,\" Tom replied. \"Will you ask her to stay after the funeral?\" \"Do not you think she would stay at her own accord?\" \"No, dear, I do not think she would want to impose during your grieving period,\" Mary said as a matter of factly. \"All in due time, my dear. Firstly we have Jane's birthday coming up on Friday,\" he said to change the subject from her imminent death. \"I cannot believe Miss Austen has been here over a week already. I am very sorry that she was unwell and now bed bound again. I so hope I get to meet her before I take my leave.\" Mary started coughing. \"I think this is enough excitement for one day,\" Tom said and caressed her cheek. \"I will ask Miss Austen to visit you as soon as Mr Barrington allows her to leave her room.\" \"You mean, when you allow Mr Barrington to tell her that she is allowed to leave her room,\" Mary hissed between her coughing fits. Tom felt his cheeks go red. Mary knew him too well. \"I just did not want her to get ill again,\" he shrugged. \"Of course you did not.\" \"I am going to leave you to rest now, my dear.\" \"Yes, you really do not care of what hour of the day it is when you are stuck in here all day,\" Mary said wistfully. \"True, my dear. But I feel I need some sleep now at least. I will ask Miss Austen to visit you tomorrow.\" \"Good night, my dear Tom. Will you stay till I have fallen asleep?\" \"Of course, if you want it.\" Tom sat down and took her hand in his, kissing it. He wondered if he should ask Jane to stay or not. She had been saying that she had eventually got to go home. He did not want to hear her speak like that. Did she not see? He would of course have to ask her to stay. -xxx- Jane Lefroy could see how Miss Austen grew more impatient by the day to not be able to leave her room. Her father had made it very clear that she was not to be worn out by her visitors. Jane visited her everyday both with and without her siblings. She noticed how her father appreciated that they were paying Miss Austen visits, and encouraged them to bring her tokens of their appreciation. Since their mother was too ill to see them they were more than happy to oblige. Miss Austen also seemed happy to see them and greeted them with smiles and welcoming words. The younger children were even allowed to crawl up in her bed when she was still ordered bed rest. Jane was happy do see that her siblings also liked Miss Austen. They had seemed a bit awkward towards her in the beginning, especially the boys, but they were soon chatting away about what they had done during the day or what they were going to do the next. Jane did not dare ask what had happened during the rainstorm. Neither Miss Austen nor her father had been speaking of it since he came up to the house with her in his arms. Jane had thought it was very romantic how her father had dashed out, defying the rain and thunder to find her. It was like something you would read in a novel. \"Jane, dear, please promise me that you and your sister and brothers do not go out without telling anyone? We would not want another incident as the one with Miss Austen,\" her father had sternly ordered. \"You are not to wander off beyond the boundaries of the garden, is that clear? At least not without company.\" Jane had promised not to do so. Her father looked very concerned but they seldom left the garden unless it was to go for a longer horse ride. But then she always had Anthony as company. Jane looked forward to her birthday in two days. Although her mother was not going to be present her father had promised she could go and visit her for a while. It was not going to be a large celebration this year since her mother was ill, but a few of her closest friends were coming for tea. She was very proud to be able to introduce them to Miss Austen, whose books they all loved dearly. -xxx- \"Miss Austen,\" Mr Barrington said as he entered her room. \"Mr Barrington,\" she greeted him from the table by the window, where she was sitting writing. \"I think it is safe for you to leave your room now, but do be careful and do not go wander off like that again,\" he exhorted. \"And do take care of you ankle.\" Her ankle was fine, she could stand on it without trouble and it was not even as hurt as she had feared. \"Of course,\" she answered. She would never dream of doing that again. Not after Tom's lecture. She would not want to put herself in that situation again. Nevertheless, she had to admit that she found it quite exhilarating to be saved by the man she loved. So romantic, almost too romantic for a poor authoress to experience in real life. That was something for the books. \"Millie will soon be up with your tea and Mr Lefroy has been asking to see you. Can I send him in?\" Mr Barrington said. Jane's eyebrows shot up in wonderment. Tom had never asked permission to come and visit her. \"Of course,\" replied she with a puzzled face. He left and soon Tom took his place. \"Miss Austen,\" he bowed slightly. \"Mr Lefroy,\" she said with wonder in her voice. Why the formalities? \"How is your wife?\" \"Still hanging on.\" Jane nodded. \"Jane, I... \" He looked distracted. \"I was wondering whether...\" Again he hesitated. \"Yes?\" \"Well, Mary wishes to see you,\" he finally said. Jane wondered if that was really what he wanted to say. \"I will see her as soon as I have had my tea,\" replied she. \"Do you mind if I join you?\" \"Not at all,\" she said and started clearing the table from her sheets of papers. \"Are you writing?\" \"Yes, I found a sudden inspiration,\" Jane smiled slightly. The story she had thought of in London needed to be written down. \"Seeing as I have been trapped in my room, there was little else I could do.\" Her statement brought a slight colour to his cheeks. She knew it had all been his doing. \"I see.\" They remained silent until Millie entered with the trey of refreshments. \"Oh, master,\" said she. \"Shall I bring another cup, sir?\" \"If it is not too much trouble, Millie,\" Tom said. \"Of course not, sir,\" she replied with a curtsey and hurried out of the room to soon return with another cup for her master. They sat down and Millie poured the tea before leaving them to themselves. Jane could think of nothing to say. She was filled ideas for her new novel and was not really very good company. Tom seemed lost in thought as well. \"It is Jane's birthday on Friday,\" he said. \"Yes, so I have heard.\" \"You will celebrate with us?\" \"If you want me to.\" \"I know Jane would not have it any other way. I suspect she has been informing everyone that the famous Miss Austen is staying with us.\" \"Oh, I am not that famous,\" Jane objected mildly. \"But you are.\" \"Perhaps a little,\" she acknowledged with a small smile. \"I can help with the necessary preparations if that would be of any help.\" \"I shall tell Millie and Mrs Jones that they ask you for help. I am sure Jane will appreciate it immensely.\" \"Good.\" Jane looked down on her hands. \"I want to repay some of the kindness that has been shown to me. It is the least I can do.\" \"Did you really mean what you said in the field? I mean about going home?\" he suddenly asked. \"Tom, you must know that I will have to go home at some point. This is not my home. I cannot stay here forever and impose on your privacy.\" \"But you are not imposing. You are a guest here,\" he objected. \"I cannot stay during your grieving period. I will leave after the funeral,\" she said with tears burning in her eyes. \"I will not let you go again!\" he cried heatedly, taking hold of her hand. \"But you must,\" Jane said and gazed into his eyes. \"There is nothing for me here.\" \"I am here,\" he said quietly. \"But...\" \"Please do not leave me,\" he whispered with tears in his eyes. \"I cannot bear to be alone when Mary is gone.\" She stared at him, not sure if she had heard him right. Was he asking her to stay forever? \"I...\" \"No, do not say anything now. Please see Mary first. Will you do as much for me?\" Jane found that she could not object to such eager plea. \"Of course. I will go and visit her at once,\" she said. She looked down at her hand still in his. He let go of her reluctantly. \"Thank you,\" he said and stood up. \"Not at all,\" she said and rose, gazing into his eyes. They were dark with emotion and gazed longingly into hers. She smiled slightly, realising that he might love her still. Perhaps Mary was going to have her will in the end. -TBC- No major cliff hanger this time... But I crave reviews.[Chapter 19] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again. They begin questioning their actions and choices in the past (i.e. from the time they met in 1795 and forward).This is what could have happened if the movie had not ended. Disclaimer: I do not own Jane Austen, Tom Lefroy or any other character in this story. Facts are taken from the Becoming Jane Fansite. Author's note: There might be a few more chapters than I said before... They are just so stubborn! Part 19: In which operation 'Persuasion' commences Tom Lefroy was sure his wife would talk Miss Austen out of leaving. She could be very persuasive when needed. And when it came to her family, she would not take no for an answer. He realised that he had some business to take care of and therefore locked himself up in his study. He was pretty certain that Miss Austen would not think of leaving him again. He was not sure he could bear to lose them both. If only Jane could see how much he loved her still. Why did I not tell her? -xxx- \"Mrs Lefroy?\" Jane knocked on her door. \"Miss Austen,\" Mr Barrington said as he opened the door for her. \"My patient is sleeping at the moment.\" \"I will come back later,\" Jane said. \"You may sit here if you like, Miss Austen. I know that she has been asking about you.\" \"Very well.\" Jane sat down in the chair next to the bed. Mary lay very pale in the bed with the long lashes rested against her cheek. She looked so serene. Jane felt truly sorry for the other woman. It could not be easy to bear such a fate, knowing that you were leaving a family behind at such a young age. Jane admired her immensely. Then she thought of Tom and his plea for her to stay. Could she stay? What would people say? She would be the gossip of Limerick. No, that was out of the question. She could not do that. It would be best for everyone if she left after the funeral. No matter how much Jane wanted to stay she did not want to be the one who ruined his reputation. She admitted to herself that she did love him as much as she ever had. The feeling of his arms around her, when he carried her up to the house, it had felt as if she belonged there. Jane was torn between doing what propriety told her to do and to follow her heart. She did not dare be rejected. Mary was stirring in the bed, her eyelids fluttered and soon blue eyes gazed up at Jane. \"Mrs Lefroy? How are you feeling? Can I get you anything?\" Jane asked. \"Miss Austen!\" Mary smiled faintly. \"I knew you would come.\" \"Of course.\" Mary's eyes were glossy from fever. \"I do not have much time left.\" Jane reached for the damp cloth and bathed her forehead. Mary started coughing. \"You must not leave!\" she suddenly cried heatedly. \"How did you know...?\" Jane looked at her incredously. \"I know what I would have done in your situation,\" Mary panted. \"You must promise me that you do not leave, Jane.\" \"I cannot stay, you know it is highly inappropriate,\" Jane looked at her with begging eyes. \"I have written it down in my testimony that I want you to stay with my family and Tom and that I have given my consent.\" \"You must not do that, Mary. I...\" \"Tom loves you! He will be lost without me.\" \"Mary...\" \"My will will be read at the funeral. Everyone will know that it was my dying wish for you to be together.\" \"Please, I cannot,\" Jane objected. \"Has not my husband asked you to stay?\" \"Yes, but...\" \"Do not you believe he still loves you?\" Mary started coughing. Jane was not sure whether Tom still loved her. She could have misread his emotions as just fear of being left alone. \"But the children...\" \"Tom has told me that they like you.\" \"Mary, you know I do not mean any disrespect to your wishes, but I just cannot, for many different reasons.\" \"I have seen the way he looks when he speaks of you. You must not leave. Please do not leave him when I am dead. He will not survive.\" Jane thought of the tears that had formed in Tom's eyes when he said he could not bear to be alone when Mary died. She did not want to be there as a substitute. She wanted to be asked to stay because he loved her. \"I cannot take your place, Mary. I am not you. If I am to stay it will be because he cannot live without me . Not without you ,\" Jane said decidedly. \"Until then I plan on going home after the funeral.\" \"But Miss Austen,\" Mary gasped. \"He does love you.\" \"Mrs Lefroy, I am sure he does not, he is just confused with fear of being left behind, to be alone with the children. It has nothing to do with love, it has to do with dependency.\" Mary's eyes grew wide in astonishment over Jane's statement. As soon as the harsh words left her lips she regretted them, but it was too late. \"I am quite determined, Mrs Lefroy.\" \"You are as headstrong as Tom!\" cried Mary. \"Why cannot you just acknolwledge that you two love each other?\" \"I am sure Tom does not think it a good idea either,\" Jane said. \"He only thinks so because he does not dare believe you love him. But you do, I can see it in your eyes. He defied the rain and thunder to rescue you, because he did not want to lose you again, Jane.\" Mary started coughing violently. Jane rose to fetch her water. \"I am dying, Jane. But I will have my way, if it is the very last thing I shall do!\" Jane stared at her. Mary's cheeks were red and her eyes were sparkling. Headstrong woman! Could not she see what it would do to her family? To Tom? \"You must understand why I cannot?\" \"No, I do not understand how you can walk away from the most lovable man in Ireland! He loves you, Jane.\" \"I believe that when I hear it. Now, I will leave you to rest. I have to help preparing for Jane's birthday.\" \"I will have my way!\" Mary rose as far as she could muster. \"Just you wait, Miss Austen!\" She sank down on her pillows again and her eyelids slipped down. Jane took her hand and checked her pulse. She was still alive, but unconscious. \"We shall see,\" Jane mumbled. She closed the door quitely behind her. She was angry with Mary for continuing to push her in Tom's arms, and with herself for resisting. She did not understand why she had to keep fighting her own feelings. It was clear that Mary wanted her to stay and be with Tom. But Jane wanted Tom to ask her to stay because he wanted her not because it was Mary's last wish. She wanted to be loved for her own sake and nothing else. She regretted her own stubbornness, but the words were already said and she could not take them back. She did want to be asked to stay. But Tom had to be the one who asked her. Not his wife. He was a man for God's sake. Why did he not tell her? She hurried outside to get some air, before tending to the preparations for Jane's birthday. -xxx- Tom did not see Jane Austen until supper that night. He had been taking care of some business in his study and barely been out of that room since their tea that morning. He thought she looked distressed. He wondered what she and her wife had been talking about. Tom tried to catch her eye, but she did not look at him once, but down at her plate, eating quietly. \"Miss Austen,\" said his daughter. \"Papa tells me that you will help with the preparations for my birthday on Friday.\" \"Of course, Jane,\" Miss Austen said. \"I will help in anyway I can.\" \"I am glad,\" Jane said. \"My friends are so eager to meet you!\" \"I am glad to be of service,\" Miss Austen smiled slightly, but Tom could see the sadness in her eyes. She was still set on leaving them. His heart filled with sorrow. He must do something to make her stay. He could not let her go again. \"Miss Austen, may I see you in the library after supper?\" he asked. She looked up at him. \"Of course, Mr Lefroy,\" she replied and took a sip of wine and they finished their food. She followed him to the library. He closed the door behind them and walked over to the windows, gazing out into the night. He struggled with the words, not sure what to say. He had asked him to join him out of a whim. All he wanted to do was to march over and take her in his arms, but he could not. \"Can I get you anything to drink?\" he asked at length, turning to her. \"No, thank you I am fine.\" \"Will you sit?\" he gestured towards the chairs where they had sat a few days ago. She walked over and sat down. \"You are still decided on going?\" It was not a question really, it was a statement. He saw that she had not changed her mind. \"Yes, I will leave after the funeral, as I said.\" \"Mary did not make you change your mind?\" \"Mary was very persuasive, but this has nothing to do with Mary, Tom. Do not you see?\" She looked at him with dark eyes, filled with pain. He did not know how to make those eyes gaze at him with love again. He realised it had to do with him. He recalled how she had looked at him in the field; at that moment he had almost thought she did love him. Now he was not as certain. \"Will not you stay if I ask you to?\" \"You ask me for the wrong reasons, Tom,\" Jane answered. \"You cannot bear the thought of being alone.\" He wanted to object, to tell her that it was not true He wanted to tell her he wanted her to stay because he loved her, but he did not dare. He was afraid she would not have him and he could not bear another loss. \"But you will stay until the funeral?\" She looked at him with puzzled face, as if wondering why he had a change of heart. \"Of course.\" He let out a sigh of relief. He would at least have some more time to make her understand how much she was needed there. Not only for him, but also for his children. -xxx- Jane gazed at Tom, feeling very confused and uncertain as to why he had suddenly accepted the fact that she was leaving. Why could not he just say the words she was longin to hear, no matter how inapproriate it was? \"Good night, Miss Austen,\" he said suddenly and rose. \"Good night, Mr Lefroy,\" she replied. He left her there. She had no idea as to why he suddenly just settled with her leaving after the funeral. She had been right. He did not love her. She had given him the opportunity to tell her that he wanted her to stay because he loved her, but he had not. The insight hit Jane and made tears rise in her eyes. He does not love me . Why was she so stubborn in not letting him know that she still loved him? Why could she not just take the leap and throw convention out the window as she always had dreamed of? Why did she fight it when all she wanted to do was to throw herself in her arms? Why do I have to remain the sensible one? She went upstairs to her room. Sitting down in the candle light she continued writing on her new novel. At least there she could get an outlet of her longing, loving feelings. There she could mould the ending to how she wanted it. A truly happy ending. She did not dare hope for a happy ending for herself. -xxx- \"She is still set on leaving, Mary,\" Tom whispered to his wife as he came to say good night. \"I asked her to stay but she said I asked for the wrong reason. Whatever that means.\" \"I know. You have to tell her you cannot live without her , my dear. You have to show her that you still love her! Do I have to tell you everything?\" \"I can still not declare my love for another when you, my dear Mary, are still here.\" \"If you want her to stay, you must. This has nothing to do with me anymore, Tom. Your and Miss Austen's happiness lies in your hands. She will not stay unless you ask her out of love for her.\" He frowned, realising that she was right. He had to make Miss Austen realise how much he loved her and persuade her to stay with him. Make her understand that he could not live without her. \"What if she will not have me?\" Tom was worried that Jane Austen would reject him. \"She will have you. If she did not love you, she would not have come here. Who can resist you, Tom? I am sure she cannot resist the man who rescued her from the rain.\" Mary smiled faintly. \"You are determined to have your way, are you not?\" he said. \"I am not as certain as you are, my dear.\" Mary smiled wistfully, \"You have read her novels, have you not? You know how she feels when it comes to love and marriage. You know what you have to do.\" \"Yes.\" Tom admitted that he had been foolish enough to think that Mary was the one who had to convince Miss Austen to stay. But now he saw that she would not stay unless he asked her to. Properly this time, not because he could not bear to be left alone. He had to ask her to stay because he loved her. -TBC- Reviews make me write faster…[Chapter 20] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again.

To be honest, I don't want this story to end… Part 20: In which they play cat and mouse and the mouse gets covered in flour Jane Austen barely slept at all that night. She was writing almost through the night and when she finally crept into bed her dreams were filled with images of Tom coming to her rescue. She was a fool. Instead of encourage him in his pursuit she was pushing him away. Why was not real life as simple as one of her novels? Jane was afraid that she might have ruined her chances with Tom once again. She wished she had not said those words to Mary. What if Mary suddenly changed her mind and did not act as Jane hoped she would? Jane was almost certain Mary would tell Tom about their discussion. Hopefully Mary would talk Tom into telling her how he felt. Thursday came with sunny skies and preparations for the birthday the following day. Jane helped out as much as she could in the kitchen and decorated the drawing room. She tried to stay out of Tom's way and did not go to see Mary. She was ashamed of how she behaved towards their hospitality. She did not trust herself around Tom right now and she felt really awkward around him. She was getting worried that Tom would not ask her to stay again. She regretted letting him down so sternly, but she firmly believed he was confused with the emotions of the pending death of his wife and not because he loved her. At least that was what she continued telling herself. -xxx- Tom started to suspect Jane Austen was avoiding him. It saddened him to see her leave every time he came in to a room. How was he supposed to convince her that he loved her when she did not give him the time of day? She did not even meet his queering eyes. He could see the ink stains on her fingers that told him that she was writing again. He recollected how he had thought it adorable when he was younger. It still had the same effect on him His heart swelled with love for her. He loved that she was helping to prepare for Jane's birthday the next day and it really bothered him that she did not want to speak with him, let alone be in the same room as him. He kept himself busy with working on his reports but occasionally entered the kitchen or the drawing room to see how the preparations were coming along. They had decided on a small gathering only but there was still much to do; cake to be baked, lemonade to be made and decorations to be hung up. \"Miss Austen?\" he said as he entered the kitchen where she was busy with kneading dough. She turned around with flour on her forehead as if she had wiped it or scratched it. She looked surprised to see him. \"Yes?\" she said, completely unaware of how beautiful he thought she was in that moment, with flour on her face, strands of hair was coming undone from her bun curled around her face and with cheeks red from exercise. She brushed the hair out of her face, leaving another trace of flour on her face. He had to restrain himself from not wiping it away. \"Should not Mrs Jones be doing that?\" \"Yes, but she had to go into town to fetch more flour, and it is not a problem really. I like baking,\" she smiled slightly. \"Besides, it is just sugar cookies.\" She wiped her hands on her apron. \"What about Millie?\" he asked. \"Well, I think she is out picking strawberries with the children. It is such a nice day for that sort of thing,\" she smiled pleasantly. \"And you did not want to join them?\" Tom could picture her among the strawberries with the children around her. And what a lovely picture it was, he could see her with little George in her lap feeding him sun warm strawberries. He could just as easily picture himself being fed strawberries from her hand. \"I have to finish up in here first. I will join them shortly.\" \"I see,\" he said, unsure how to continue. She looked as if she wanted to return to her baking. \"As soon as I have done these I will be out,\" she said. \"I will ask Millie to serve tea in the garden then,\" Tom said decidedly. She could not refuse to take tea with them. \"Perhaps some fresh strawberries and cream as a treat for us all,\" he smiled brightly. \"I will join you as soon as I can,\" she replied with a sunny smile. \"I will leave you to it then and send Millie in to prepare the tea,\" he said, and added 'and finish your cookies' silently to himself. Jane looked at home in the kitchen and the flour that covered her really suited her. She had no idea of how her appearance affected him. He had to get out of there before he did something they might regret. -xxx- Jane realised that Tom was actually seeking her out. She was surprised to hear his voice from behind her as she stood in the kitchen making cookies. She felt slightly embarrassed for doing Mrs Jones's chores but she enjoyed baking and she really wanted to make amends for the hospitality shown to her. That and she really needed to focus on something else other than Tom. But he did not make that easy for her. He kept popping in where ever she might be. Ever since she admitted to actually still loving him as much as she ever had, she found it hard to be in the same room as him. For some reason she did not know how to act around him. She felt like she was twenty again. This awkwardness led to her avoiding him as much as possible. She did not trust herself around him anymore. All she could think of was the way he had carried her in his arms, rescuing her from the rain. Mary was right. How could a woman not love a man who dashes out to rescue her? She could not get away from talking to him now. He was standing in the kitchen smiling and attentive. Asking about this and that, just to make some conversation. Her heart melted. She brushed a strand of hair from her eyes, suddenly aware of the state she was in. Her hair was slipping out of her pins and the hotness of the kitchen made it curl around her face. Her cheeks grew even hotter when she met his eyes. \"As soon as I have done these I will be out,\" she said and hoped that he would leave her to finish her task. \"I will ask Millie to serve tea in the garden then,\" he replied. That sounded lovely. Perhaps the children's strawberries could serve as dessert. \"Perhaps some fresh strawberries and cream as a treat for us all,\" Tom said as if he had read her thoughts with a bright smile. \"I will join you as soon as I can,\" Jane replied, returning his infectious smile. She regretted her game of cat and mouse she had played with him earlier that day and decided to try to be as amiable as she could towards him. \"I will leave you to it then and send Millie in to prepare the tea,\" Tom said and left her to finish her cookies. She let out a sigh as he closed the door behind him. She turned to find something to reflect her image on to see what state her appearance was in and found that she was completely covered in flour and her hair really needed redoing. She blushed slightly. It could not be helped. She would need to freshen up before she took tea with him. Why had he not mentioned that she looked like a scullery maid? She rolled out the dough and started to cut out round cookies as Millie entered the kitchen. She looked hot from being in the sun for a while. She brought with her a large bowl of strawberries. \"Look at you Miss Austen! All covered in flour!\" she chuckled happily as she saw Jane's floury complexion. \"Yes,\" Jane said and felt her cheeks go even redder. \"I promised to serve tea in half an hour so it is probably time to go freshen up, Miss Austen. I will finish up here,\" Millie said. \"Oh it is no trouble, I am almost finished,\" Jane objected. \"Master's orders,\" Millie smiled. Of course , Jane thought, but did not say anything but took off her apron and went to her room. She took her time to make herself presentable again. When she came down again she walked outside and found a table in the shadow of the shrubberies set with strawberries and cream for all of them. The children sat around it with plates full of delicious strawberries. Jane could hardly remember the last time she had tasted anything more delicious. Jane had little George on her left side and Anne on the other. She felt at ease around them now and chatted with all of them, asking them about their day and especially Jane about her forthcoming birthday the next day. They all seemed much exited about it. Anne confided in Jane that she had made a drawing for her sister, the boys had, with the help of their father, picked out a book for her. -xxx- Tom watched how Jane interacted with his children and was very happy with what he saw. She looked like she belonged there. He was certain she would fill the void his darling Mary would leave. He saw how she wiped George's face free from cream and then looked up at meet his admiring eyes. She smiled. His heart stopped for an instant and then started again in double pace. He found it hard to breathe properly. There was so much emotion in those eyes that he had to look away. This was a nice change from avoiding him all morning. He wondered what had brought that on. He still did not dare hope for her to stay unless he asked her or told her how he felt. He could barely take his eyes off of her. Her eyes were again sparkling and her cheeks glowing. It was long since he had seen her look so well. The shadow of sadness that had clouded her eyes was gone. \"We will have to ask Mrs Jones to make a cake with the strawberries for you, Jane,\" he said to his daughter. \"Yes,\" she smiled back, \"they are truly delicious.\" She put a strawberry in her mouth and chewed on it with delight. -xxx- Spending time with Tom and his children was enjoyable for Jane Austen, but also a bit saddening. It reminded her of the family she never had. Though it now was within her grasp she continued being set on leaving after the funeral. Sadly it seemed Mary was barely hanging on now and could pass away any day. To think about the children being motherless made her very sad indeed. She smiled down at little George and found his toothy smile coloured with strawberry smears mixed with cream. She took a napkin and wiped his face clean and was rewarded with a wet kiss on her cheek as he left the table as soon as he was clean. As she looked up again she caught Tom's eye. He smiled at her and she felt herself light up in a bright smile, his smile had always been very infectious and very charming. Now, when nearing his forties, with a more distinguished look, he still had the same affect on her. Her stomach fluttered and she felt her knees go weak even though she was sitting down. The gaze he gave her said more than a thousand words and she realized that she might have been mistaken. He still had feelings for her, he might perhaps even love her still. As she bid him good night at the bottom of the stairs he turned back to her with his hands on his back and gleaming eyes. \"By the way, you do look quite becoming in flour,\" he said with a devilish smile. -TBC- You know the drill…[Chapter 21] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again.

I hope you like this chapter. They are starting to wear down... Part 21: In which Jane Lefroy turns twelve Jane Lefroy could hardly sleep that night. She was too exited about her birthday. Although she had already gotten the best gift of all she wondered what her friends were going to bring her. She was also going to visit her mother, she had longed to be with her and talk to her. Her mother was constantly getting worse. Her father wanted the children to have happier memories of their mother other than laying ill in her bed. She was going to bring her some treats from the birthday tea, especially the lovely strawberries. They were her mother's favourite. -xxx- Jane Austen's sleep was disturbed by Tom's final words. \"By the way, you do look quite becoming in flour.\" Her cheeks grew red as she lay in her bed. She had indeed looked like a maid with flour from top to bottom and he had just stood there making polite conversation without as much as a word regarding her appearance. She also thought of the gazes they had shared at the tea table. She tried her best not to read too much into them. But there was something in them, something that spoke to her, a faint whisper of him loving her still. She rose early to help Millie and Mrs Jones with the final preparations and the birthday breakfast which was to be had in bed. Jane took it upon herself to pick fresh flowers for every room. The night's dreaming and Tom-centred thoughts needed clearing out with sweet June-air. She went out with a basked on her arm and scissors in hand in search of suitable flowers. She drew in a deep breath of crisp air filled with the sweet smell of roses sprinkled with dew. Once again she was struck by the beauty of this garden. It must have been made by the tenderest care and a loving hand. She let the sun warm her face as she turned it to the sky as Tom had done the first morning she had been there. It was a truly delicious feeling. -xxx- The two Janes were not the only ones with sleeping troubles. Tom had lain awake replaying the kitchen scene followed by tea in the garden for hours. He was beginning to see that Jane's feelings were as strong as his. The way she helped out with the preparations for his daughter's birthday and taking an interest in his children's welfare told him that she did care at least. She must soon realise that her leaving was not an option. He had seen the way she was with the children and how she sometimes gazed at them with very sad eyes, as if she felt utterly sorry for them. He dressed and went down to see his wife before Jane's birthday breakfast. It was still very early and he thought no one was up, but he caught glimpse of Jane Austen's pale blue muslin as she exited the house. He wanted to follow her, but he restrained himself and continued on to his wife's chamber. \"Mary, dearest?\" he whispered in her ear as he sat down on the bed. She was sleeping quite calmly. \"Oh, Mary, what am I to do without you?\" He took in her pale face, the long lashes that rested against her cheek, the curly golden hair, and the small soft hands that rested on the cover. He took hold of her hands, lifting them up to his mouth and kissed them gently. She stirred slightly but did not wake up. He brushed her hair out of her face and felt her forehead. She was hot from fever. He hoped for his daughter's sake that she would be conscious later that day when she came to visit. -xxx- Jane walked slowly back to the house when the basket was full of a nice blend of flowers that she had found in the garden. She was truly satisfied. Her head was filled with images from the day before and as she deep in thought rounded a corner without looking she stepped right into Tom's chest. She was so startled she almost lost her balance for a second, but Tom's strong arms scooped her up before she fell. \"You really need to work on your balance, Miss Austen,\" he remarked with a sly smile. She stared up into his blue eyes and lost herself in them for a moment. She could feel his heart beating under her hand that rested on his chest. Her mouth went dry and her knees utterly weak. \"My knees are not what they used to,\" she breathed with pounding heart. \"Perhaps Mr Barrington could be persuaded into examine them,\" Tom said and his smile widened. She was still captive in his arms, his eyes gazing into hers. She was dangerously close to him. The musky scent of his cologne intermingled with the sweet scent of newly picked roses and the mix made Jane dizzy. Jane was completely lost in the moment, her head was spinning and she lost track of time. His hold around her waist tightened as his face drew nearer. She could not move, but then again, she did not want to move. She swallowed, he was too close. Her eyelids slipped down as she titled her head upwards to meet his lips. She could feel his breath on her face. Somewhere behind her she could hear a door open. She broke free, twirled around to see Millie coming from her mistress' room. Her face grew hot as she realised how close it had been that they had actually kissed and being caught doing just that. Jane hoped Millie had not seen how close her master and she had been to each other. It was very, very inappropriate to stand in a dark hallway, captive in another woman's husband's arms. Even if it was because she had almost fallen and he had rescued her. Again. -xxx- Tom cursed under his breath as he heard the door open and Jane broke free from his embrace. Just a few more seconds and their lips had brushed against each other in a soft kiss. Now the moment was lost and they went their separate ways to go on with the preparations. Tom could not concentrate on the task he had planned to finish before breakfast but just thought of the almost kiss. He was deep in thought when Millie knocked on his study door to announce that Jane's breakfast was ready and everybody was waiting for him. \"I will be right there,\" he answered distractedly. To be close to Jane Austen again was an exhilarating thought. He hurried up to his daughter's room and found Jane standing with the tray in her hands waiting for the rest of his family. Her cheeks were red and she did not meet his eyes. Tom opened the door to his daughter's room and they started singing. Her siblings ran in and jumped up in her bed and Jane Austen followed with the tray and put it down by on the table by Jane's bed. -xxx- Jane Lefroy feigned sleeping as she heard hushed voiced outside her door. She had been awake for hours already. The door slowly opened and her sister and brothers ran in and jumped up in her bed while singing on the top of their lungs. She smiled and hugged them all. Anthony had brought her puppy as well and Anne gave her a drawing of the meadow outside her window. Miss Austen followed with the breakfast tray in her hands and put it down on her table by the bed. She smiled happily at Jane and her father who came and sat down next to her. \"Happy birthday, Jane,\" he said and handed her a small parcel. She opened it hastily and found a small box which contained a beautiful necklace. \"Oh, papa, it is beautiful!\" she squealed and threw herself around his neck. Her brothers brought her Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing . She had not yet read it and she was looking forward to it. But this instant it was the breakfast that drew her attention. She felt famished. She glanced at Miss Austen who was standing a bit to the side. She thought the authoress had an almost bewildered look about her today. Miss Austen caught her eye and smiled at her. As she had finished her breakfast Millie helped her into her favourite white laced muslin and put her hair up. She wanted to look her best. She longed to see her mother again. She also realised that it was going to be the last time. She quickly pushed the sad thoughts away and focused on the present. \"Are you ready to meet your mother, Jane?\" her father asked as she exited her room. \"Yes, papa,\" she smiled up at him. \"I have just been with her and she is expecting you now,\" he said. \"You look remarkable pretty, you know Jane? Very much like your mother.\" She noticed the sadness in his eyes and took his hand and squeezed it. \"And she thinks I look like you,\" she smiled brightly and let him escort her to her mother's chamber. \"I will leave you two ladies alone,\" he said and opened the door for her. She tiptoed in and sat down at her mother's side. She noticed the vase of fresh flowers on her nightstand and wondered if Miss Austen had been into see her also. \"Mamma?\" she whispered. Her mother's eyelids fluttered and opened. Her blue eyes focused on Jane's face. \"Jane, my dear child!\" she whispered and took her hands. \"I am so happy that I get to spend another birthday with you.\" \"So am I, mamma,\" Jane replied and kissed her mother's hands. \"Now tell me everything! What have you gotten so far?\" her mother asked. \"Well, you know I got the puppy, Anne has made a very nice drawing for me, the boys gave me Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing , and papa gave me this necklace.\" Jane brought her hand up to her neck to show her mother. \"Lovely,\" her mother said. \"It suits you very well, my dear.\" \"I am so sorry that you cannot celebrate with us all,\" Jane said with tears in her eyes. \"I know, but you are here now,\" her mother said. \"Yes, I am,\" Jane smiled and hugged her mother. She did not want to lose her, but fate had another plan. \"So, tell me about your father rescuing Miss Austen!\" her mother mused. \"Not much to tell, really,\" she answered. \"But it looked very romantic when he came up towards the house with her in his arms, wet all over. Quite like Willoughby carrying Marianne.\" \"It is delightful,\" her mother said with glittering eyes. \"Is Miss Austen still set on going home?\" \"I do not know. I did not know she was leaving.\" \"Hopefully she will not, but do try to say something about you wanting her to stay. She needs a bit of persuasion, I think.\" -xxx- Jane Austen held herself in the background for most of the day until Jane Lefroy's friends came. They attacked her with lots of questions, wanting to know everything about her. She had never realised what kind of impact her novels had on other people's lives. The girls adored her books and swore never to marry without affection. \"I am so glad that you are here to celebrate my birthday, Miss Austen,\" Jane Lefroy whispered as they said goodbye to her friends. \"My friends really liked you.\" \"I am glad too, Jane.\" \"I never want you to leave, Miss Austen,\" Jane said and put her arms around her in a tight hug. Jane did not know how to respond. She patted her on the back. \"I am not leaving just yet,\" she said evasively. \"I do not know what we would do without you.\" \"Jane, I must leave sometime,\" Jane said. \"I cannot stay here forever. I have a sister and mother too that misses me.\" \"Could not they come here too?\" Jane asked with the logic thinking of a twelve year old, looking up at her with pleading blue eyes that looked so much like her father's. \"It is not that simple, my dear. I wish it was, but it is not,\" Jane said and kissed her on the head. -xxx- Tom heard Jane's last words and they gave him some hope. She did not sound as set on leaving anymore. If she had been she would have said so as not to keep his daughter's hopes up. His head was still filled with his encounter with Jane in the hallway that morning. He knew she had been as caught up in the moment as he had and he silently cursed Millie for showing up like she had. \"How has your day been, dearest?\" Mary asked him as he came to say goodnight. \"It has been very good indeed,\" he smiled and thought of Jane in his arms. \"Jane was very happy for the gift she had gotten.\" \"Yes, the necklace was perfect.\" \"She told me all about you rescuing Miss Austen. She found it quite heroic,\" smiled his wife. \"I am no hero, dear.\" \"Is she still set on going home?\" \"I do not know, I have not asked her again. But Jane asked her earlier and she did not say a definite 'no' and that must count for something. She would not want to lead Jane on, right?\" \"It is a step forward, my dear. I think she is a bit embarrassed to come see me again after her last visit. She did say some pretty harsh words.\" \"I am trying to convince her about how much she is wanted and needed here,\" Tom said. \"And you should see her with the children, so sweet tempered and patient.\" Tom smiled lovingly when he thought of Jane with little George by her side at the tea table. \"Thomas Langlois Lefroy, I do believe you are in love.\" -TBC- I've done my job, now it is your turn! ;)[Chapter 22] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again.

But what do we love more...? Part 22: In which the cat finally catches the mouse and heaven retrieves an angel Jane Austen had once more fled to the sweet serenity of the garden. Jane Lefroy's words haunted her. She had only been in their life a short time, but the children had taken a fancy to her. She walked down to the rose garden. What was she to do? She could not leave the children now that they were turning to her for comfort. She was not even sure if she could leave Tom without feeling like a villain. She turned her gaze up to the starlit sky as in search for answers. She shivered in the slight breeze and drew her shawl closer. The stars had no answers for her but kept on twinkling happily at her. Her thoughts wandered back to that morning and the encounter with Tom in the hallway and she blushed. If Millie had not exited her mistress' room they would most probably have kissed. The insight sent shivers down her spine. She toyed with the idea of staying on after the funeral, thinking of bringing her mother and dear sister to Limerick. The thought was breathtaking. She had to remind herself of the fact that Tom had yet to ask her for the right reasons. Would he ask before it was too late? Did he even love her? Jane let out a deep sigh. How did her life become so complicated? She had led a simple but comfortable life. Devoted her love and longing to her fiction and had been satisfied with that. Then came Tom Lefroy into her life, again, turning it upside down, again. Jane was once again in love with this, now very distinguished, Irish rogue and she could not bear to leave him again. -xxx- \"Thomas Langlois Lefroy, I do believe you are in love,\" Mary stated. \"Mary, please do not say that,\" Tom pleaded and rose from her bed and walked over to the window. \"Why not? It is the truth, is it not?\" He gazed out to the night. He saw movement down by the rose garden. He squinted; there was someone out there in the moonlight. As the person turned the face to the sky and the moonlight hit the face he saw that it was Jane Austen. He recalled the feeling of having her in his arms, how close they had been to kissing and he turned back to his wife with burning face. \"I cannot…\" he started but she cut him off. \"I can see it, dear, when you speak of her. It is no use in you denying it any longer. Is she out there now?\" She nodded towards the window. \"Yes,\" he breathed with heart beating thick with longing love. \"Go to her, Tom. Convince her to stay,\" Mary said urgently. \"I know you do not wish her to leave. You are the only one who can make her stay.\" Tom sat down by her side again. He kissed her cheek. \"You are an angel, you know that?\" \"Yes, soon I will be,\" she giggled softly. \"Now go to her!\" \"I love you so much,\" said he and kissed her on the lips. \"I know, I love you too,\" said Mary and gazed into his eyes. \"You deserve to share the rest of your life with someone great. And Miss Austen is the best I can find.\" \"You truly are a remarkable woman, Mary.\" He kissed her again and then left her. \"Good bye, my love,\" she whispered as the door closed behind him. \"I shall never see you again.\" -xxx- Jane Austen was just about to turn back to the house when she heard footsteps behind her. She knew it was Tom without turning. No one else would be up at this late hour. She remained turned away from him until he spoke. \"Miss Austen, what did I say about wandering about alone?\" asked he with a feigned lecturing tone. \"What can I say, I am progressive.\" She only glanced at him with a faint smile. He was standing a tad behind her with his hands in his pockets. \"So I have gathered,\" replied he. \"I cannot get enough of this garden,\" said she and gazed out over the roses, breathing in their sweet fresh scent. \"It is Mary's pride and joy,\" replied he. \"I thought so, such love has gone into this garden. Like with your library.\" She suddenly felt shy in front of him. She turned her gaze to the sky again. \"The stars are remarkable bright tonight.\" \"So they are,\" he said quietly. She did not dare to meet his eyes. She could feel his gazes on her, could sense him moving closer to her. Jane remained still. \"How is your wife this evening?\" she asked in an attempt to keep a clear head. \"The same,\" he answered hesitatingly. He was standing right behind her now; she could feel the warmth of his body. Her back tingled in anticipation. She had to restrain herself not to lean backwards and step into his arms. \"Look, there is the Plough,\" he whispered and pointed towards the constellation of stars in the sky. Her gaze followed his pointing hand. She could feel his breath on her neck and she shivered slightly. He was so close. Would it be very wrong for her to turn and kiss him like she had done so many years ago? She did not want to follow conventions anymore. -xxx- Tom was standing just behind her and pointed up towards the Plough in the sky. Her gaze followed to where he was pointing and the moonlight fell on her delicate face and neck. He was so close to her, he could feel her body's warmth beam towards him. He wanted nothing more than to take that last step and let his arms close her in an embrace and never let her go again. Her neck looked invitingly pale in the moonlight and he wanted nothing more than to press his hot lips against her soft skin. When her body shivered in the breeze he found that he could not restrain himself any longer and took the last step and tightly wrapped his arms around her. At first her body went stiff as if startled by his action, but after just a moment her body leaned towards his chest. This is it. \"It is beautiful,\" she whispered. \"So are you,\" he whispered back. She arched her neck backwards so that her head rested on his shoulder. That was all the encouragement he needed. His lips found her neck. She shivered slightly, but did not move away. He could feel her pulse beat faster under the soft skin. \"Tom, we should not…\" she objected faintly. \"Hush, Jane,\" he breathed against her neck. He brought his hand up to her cheek and gently forced her to turn her face towards his. He gazed into her dark eyes. His heart pounded in his chest and his breathing was quick. He swallowed and wetted his lips. His hand cradled her neck and finally his lips found hers. Softly at first, then tenderly and lastly passionately, almost desperately. Almost twenty years of yearning went in to that kiss. She turned fully towards him and her arms nestled around him in under his coat. The kiss deepened and he was completely lost in her. -xxx- She held on to him as if her life depended on it. The feelings she had subdued for so long bubbled up and hit her with full force and she almost forgot to breathe. Her arms found their way in under his coat and she leaned against his chest. She returned the kiss passionately. She completely forgot he was married to a wife that was dying, she forgot his children and the rest of the world disappeared. There was Tom and there was Jane. Nothing else mattered. After what seemed like forever she gently broke free from his embrace and just gazed at him shyly, breathless and speechless. He looked back at her with eyes burning with desire. \"What… why?\" she stuttered, turning away from him with burning hot cheeks and pounding heart. \"I love you,\" he breathed. \"I need you! I cannot live without you!\" he cried, taking hold of her hand and making her stay and turn to face his pleading eyes and face. \"I…\" she blushed violently, unable to speak. He took her face in his other hand, caressing her cheek. \"Tell me you feel the same, that I am not imagining it.\" She met his begging eyes, dark as the night. She could not deny it any longer. \"Yes.\" His face lit up in a broad smile and he kissed her again. She entangled her hands in his hair. \"Stay with me, marry me!\" he breathed against her hair. She realised that was exactly what she wanted to do. That was the reason she came to Limerick. Mary was going to have her way in the end. \"Yes, yes!\" she kissed him with beating heart and body filled with uncontrollable joy. She did not know anyone could be this happy. She had only written about it and the feeling was almost too much to bear. That this could actually happen to a penniless ironic authoress, it was too much. \"Oh, Jane, I am yours! I am your heart and soul!\" cried he, repeating the words that had whispered to her all those years ago. She smiled happily. \"Promise me that you will never leave me again!\" \"I will never leave you again, Thomas Langlois Lefroy,\" she breathed. -xxx- As soon as Tom had uttered the words 'I love you' to Jane Austen and she had accepted him, Mary Paul Lefroy's heart stopped beating and she drew her last breath knowing her family would be taken care of. Smiling she lay in her bed with her golden hair flowing over her pillow almost like a halo. Heaven had retrieved an angel. -TBC- Only one more chapter to go, I am afraid. This story has come to its end.[Chapter 23] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again. They begin questioning their actions and choices in the past (i.e. from the time they met in 1795 and forward).This is what could have happened if the movie had not ended. Disclaimer: I do not own Jane Austen, Tom Lefroy or any other character in this story. Facts are taken from the Becoming Jane Fansite. Author's note: Ok, I bend for your requests. I will try to draw it out, well actually I realised that there is some loose ends to tie up and since so many of you has been kind enough to ask for more chapters I will oblige. Part 23: In which Mrs Lefroy is greatly missed \"You better not leave me, Miss Jane Austen,\" Tom Lefroy said and smiled at her in the dark. \"Because I will hunt you down.\" \"Is that so?\" she giggled playfully. \"Oh yes,\" he said and caressed her cheek. \"Let us go tell Mary that she will have her way after all.\" He took her by the hand and escorted her up to the house. His heart was filled with love for her. He could not believe he had been fighting himself for all this time. Now it all felt so unreal, as if it was all a dream and that he would wake up the next day and found that nothing of this had actually happened. He opened the door to Mary's chamber carefully as not to wake anyone else. She lay in her bed, very sweet and sleeping. Very pale, too pale, as he got closer to the bed he began to feel that something was very wrong. \"Mary?\" he whispered, motioning for Jane not to follow. Mary did not stir in bed. The cover did not show any movement at all. He lounged forward and took her hand, feeling it for a pulse and when he did not find any he sank down on his knees and buried his face against her neck. \"No!\" he mumbled. \"Mary!\" Tears flowed down his cheeks as he realised that she had left him. -xxx- Jane stood by the door and watched the scene before her. Tom was kneeling by his dead wife's side, crying as he had realised she had left them. Her throat choked and she felt hot tears flowing down her cheeks. For only but seconds ago they had been the happiest of people. The earth had been robbed of one truly remarkable woman. Mary lay very angelic in the bed with her golden hair spread over the pillow and a small content smile seemed to play on her pale lips. Jane could not believe she was gone. Her heart ached for the people Mary had left behind. For Tom and his children. Those poor children, without a mother. Jane knew not what to do. Was she to comfort him or leave him to grieve? Did he want her there or did he want to be alone? She stood insecure by the door as he turned to her with tear drenched cheeks. Their eyes locked and she tried to smile encouragingly through her tears. She took a step forward and he rose and stepped into her arms, sobbing quietly against her neck. She rubbed his back gently and whispered small insignificant words of comfort. They sunk to the floor and she sat with him in her arms till dawn. He cried himself to sleep with his head in her lap. She caressed his cheeks and head and let him sleep. But Jane was wide awake, thinking of all the matters that now had to be taken care of. The funeral, the children, the will... What was going to happen now? Was she to stay with him or go home? Should she ask her mother and Cassie to come? She needed to write them a letter in any case to inform them of Mrs Lefroy's death and when they might be expecting her home. -xxx- When Jane Lefroy woke that morning after her birthday she had a feeling of that something was amiss. The house was quieter than it usually was this time of the day. Millie had not even come to light the fire in her room. She rose and tip toed downstairs, she was met by a red eyed Millie who was blowing her nose. \"Millie? What is the matter?\" she asked. \"Oh, Miss Jane,\" Millie sobbed and embraced her tightly. Jane realised that that could only mean one thing. Her mother's death. She did not want to hear it. She let herself remain in Millie's arms for a while, unable to move. Her throat was choked up and she could not utter another word. She did not know for how long they were standing there but when she heard footsteps in the staircase she broke free. She gazed up at Millie with large blue eyes that were hot from tears. \"Mamma is gone,\" she stated. \"Yes, Miss, I am terribly sorry, Miss,\" Millie whispered. \"She died in her sleep.\" \"Where is my father?\" Jane asked. \"In Mrs Lefroy's room, Miss.\" Jane nodded and went for her mother's chamber to see to her father. She found him in the arms of Miss Austen, crying quietly in her lap. As Jane entered the room Miss Austen looked up to meet her eyes. \"Jane, do not...\" Miss Austen said meekly. She was too crying. \"I want to,\" Jane said and walked over to her mother's bed and just stood there in silence watching her with tears rolling down her cheeks. Her mother looked too serene and at piece, not dead at all. She bent forward to kiss her cheek. It was cold. That was when she saw something in her mother's hand. A piece of paper. \"There is something in her hand, Miss Austen.\" Miss Austen looked up. \"There is?\" \"Yes.\" Jane pulled it gently from her mother's grip. It was a small note in her mother hand containing one sentence and one sentence only. \"What does it say?\" Miss Austen asked. Jane stared at the sentence her mother had scribbled down. \"She has written 'As I said, I will have my way'. What does that mean?\" Jane looked up at Miss Austen with a puzzled face. Miss Austen's face turned slightly red before lighting up in a small smile. \"I think it is meant for me and you father,\" she said. \"Why?\" \"Oh, nothing. Everything will be explained in due time,\" Miss Austen said with a mysterious smile. Jane wondered what it meant. Her father soon rose from the floor with tear drenched face and red eyes. Jane walked over to be folded into his embrace. \"Oh, papa!\" cried she. \"My dear, sweet child,\" he mumbled against her hair. \"We must tell your brothers and sister.\" \"I know,\" she whispered back. She sobbed against his chest. -xxx- Tom hated to see his children sad. But he had to break the news to them before they heard it from someone else. He sought them out in the nursery and made them gather around him as he sat down on the floor. \"I am sad to tell you that your mother died last night. She died in her sleep and she did not have to suffer anymore,\" he said. He thought it best to tell it like it was. The younger boys stared at him with large eyes, not really understanding what he was saying. Anne started crying and Anthony looked shocked. \"May I see her?\" asked Anthony. Tom thought for a while. He did not want the younger children to see her, but Anthony was old enough. Mary looked so tranquil that it should not be a problem. \"Yes, you may. She is still in her bed,\" said Tom. He turned to the other children, \"You do not have to see her if you do not want to.\" \"I do not want to,\" Anne whispered and threw her arms around him and the young ones followed. They sobbed quietly in his lap. Anthony went to their mother's chamber. It broke Tom's heart to see his children cry. His heart was full of emotions and he could hardly bear it. He needed to get out of the house and just breathe for a while, but he could not leave his children. Just as he thought he could not handle the sobbing anymore he heard someone enter the room. He looked up and met Jane Austen's hazel eyes. She must have seen his desperate look because she sat herself down next to him and nodded towards the door. \"I can take it from here,\" she whispered. \"Thank you,\" he whispered back and kissed her gently on the cheek while ushering over the children to her. -xxx- Jane Austen saw Tom's pain filled eyes and took his place with the children in the nursery. She placed little George in her lap and the rest gathered around her still weeping quietly. She felt helpless. Jane did not have any idea of what the little ones needed or craved at this moment. When her father died she had felt utterly distressed and unable to do anything at all. The family had come to a standstill. But these children, what could she do for them? It was all too new for her to have children to care for. That someone depended on her completely. George had fallen asleep in her lap and the older children had stopped crying and started to move around the nursery looking a bit restless. \"What do you want to do now?\" she asked. Three pair of dazed blue eyes turned to her. \"I have to put George down, but after that we could perhaps go out for a little while? We could probably all use a little fresh air and sunshine.\" She tried to smile brightly. They nodded in agreement. Jane left George in his bed and ushered the other three outside. Though it was a sad day for the Lefroy household the June day was warm and sunny. They children started to look a bit happier and the colour started to creep back on their cheeks. Jane looked for Tom but did not see him anywhere. He needed his time alone for now. Anthony and Jane soon joined their siblings outside, trying to hide their tears from their younger siblings. \"How are you holding up, Jane?\" Jane asked. \"I am fine,\" replied she with a faint smile. \"And Anthony?\" Jane turned to the eldest son. \"I will manage,\" replied Anthony. \"Have you seen papa, Miss Austen?\" asked Jane. \"No, not since I took over for him in the nursery,\" replied Jane. \"He probably has some things to tend to now. There are a lot of matters to tend to.\" \"I have to go and see to the puppies,\" Anthony said and took his leave. Jane Austen watched the children play for a while until she was sure they were alright for the time being. Leaving Jane in charge she went in search of their father. -xxx- Tom's heart was breaking. Although he had known Mary would eventually leave him, he had really not thought as far as her actually dying. The tears would not stop falling from his eyes and he did not know what to at this point. He felt he was out of control. He realised of course he had to see to the funeral and order mourning clothes for everybody and distribute the letters as promised to Mary. It was just too much. It was overwhelming. He thought of his poor children and of Miss Austen whom he had declared his love for the night before. It felt like a lifetime ago. A quiet knock on the study door brought him back to reality. \"Tom?\" came Jane's soft voice through the door. \"Yes, please come in,\" replied he and wiped his face. She stepped into his study and tried to smile. \"The children are fine for now. George is sleeping and the rest is outside.\" \"Thank you. I do not know what I would do without you,\" he said and walked over to her. \"I miss her so much!\" \"I know,\" Jane whispered and put her arms around him. \"I know.\" -TBC- It is not easy to write about weeping children. But it had to be done. Please review![Chapter 24] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again. They begin questioning their actions and choices in the past (i.e. from the time they met in 1795 and forward).This is what could have happened if the movie had not ended. Disclaimer: I do not own Jane Austen, Tom Lefroy or any other character in this story. Facts are taken from the Becoming Jane Fansite. Author's note: Oh I love getting reviews that tell me to go on and on and on! I will not say how many more chapters there are because now I do not know, especially since you keep calling for more... Part 24: In which letters from Mrs Lefroy finds their recipients Jane Austen found Tom in his study. It broke her heart to see him cry without knowing how to comfort him. All she could do was to be there for him and support him through this rough time that lied ahead. She knew not when they would find the time to talk about their future together. She did not want to bother him with that at the moment, but she felt so insecure of what was happening around her now. She held him close until his sobs died out. She saw the package of letters that lay on his desk and wondered what they were. They were written with the same hand. He walked around his desk and sat down with a tired look on his face. Jane recognised the handwriting as Mary's. \"Are these from Mary?\" she asked. \"Yes. She asked me to distribute them after her death. She has written a letter to each and every one of us,\" replied Tom with sorrowful voice. \"Is there anything I can do?\" asked she. \"Just be here for us? Do not leave after the funeral.\" His sad eyes begged her to not leave. \"Of course, if you wish it.\" He looked through the letters and selected one out and held it towards her. \"This is for you,\" he said. \"For me?\" she asked surprised. \"Yes.\" She took the letter and read her own name written on it. \"Would it not be more appropriate for me to leave for a while after the funeral?\" she suddenly asked. Tom rose so hastily that his chair fell over: \"No! You cannot leave us! Ask your mother and sister to come here if it is them you want to see.\" \"May I?\" Jane was surprised at that offer. \"Of course. They will be my family too eventually.\" He tried to smile but it looked more like a sad frown. \"Thank you, Tom. Do you know which date the funeral will be held? I do not want them to come before that.\" \"A week from Wednesday,\" replied Tom and tears filled his beautiful blue eyes once more. \"Very well, I will write to my mother and Cassandra and ask them to come after that.\" Jane could not help but feel happy for a moment. She was going to be Mrs Thomas Lefroy. -xxx- June, 1814 My Dearest Tom When you read this I have joined our Lord in heaven and am sitting on a cloud watching over you. Please do not be devastated. I know you will find strength and support in Miss Austen. I know that you both by now have acknowledged your love for one another. I am happy for you both. You deserve it. I wish all the best in your continued life together. I hope you will find a way to be as happy as you deserve to be now that you have the future ahead of you together and that a wedding is soon to be planned. Please do not cry, my dear Tom. I am happy for you. It was my time and nothing can change that. Accept that I am better off where I am now and move on with your life with Miss Austen by your side. I am happy to know that my family will be taken care of. It pains me to leave you, but one cannot change one's fate I am told. I have hanging on far too long and the last weeks have been filled with pain and it is a relief to finally say good bye to this life and go on to the next. I have written a will that I am sure you found in the chest also. My belongings will be divided as I have stated in that will. But do not open that until after the funeral. The children have gotten a letter each. I am so going to miss you all. I will watch over you from heaven. Smiling down at you and the children. I enclose a letter that I want the priest to read at my funeral. It will explain a lot of things and also give you and Miss Austen my blessing to marry. I love you with all my heart. I will never leave your side completely. Yours forever, Mary Paul Lefroy When Tom had finished the letter he was crying whole heartedly and missing the remarkable woman he had been lucky enough to have in his life. He had not always felt as lucky, he admitted that. Arranged marriages are not easy but he had grown to love and appreciate his wife more than he or anyone could have imagined. She had blessed him with six beautiful children. And now she was gone and he was left with six children missing their mother. No, he corrected himself, he was not alone. Jane was in his life again. And this time it was till death did them part. Mary had probably been right in thinking he could not handle a life without a woman. He felt utterly lost, but thinking of Jane made the heart ache ease up a bit. -xxx- Jane Austen did not read her letter until after supper. It had been a very sad meal and no one seemed to have any appetite except little George who did not understand why everyone around him was so sad and quiet. Tom had given the children their letters and instructed the elder children to read to their younger siblings who had yet to learn. June, 1814 Dear Miss Jane Austen, If you are reading this it means I have finally joined our lord in heaven. I so hope that you by now have admitted to loving our Tom and that he also has come to his senses to tell you about his feelings and asked you to stay indefinitely. I am pretty sure that my will has been done. I am happy for you both and give my blessing whole heartedly. I wish you all the happiness in the world. You deserve each other. It does pain me to leave my children and husband, but my Lord has called me back and there is nothing I can do but oblige. My last weeks have been painful and I welcome death as my saviour. I cannot go on hanging on to life with bare willpower. I may be stubborn, but not that stubborn. I cannot think of anyone better suited to care for my family than you. I know I ask a lot of you, but I now feel so relieved to know that you will be there for all of them. I will miss them dearly. I have been blessed and now I turn that blessing on you. I hope this letter finds you in a felicity mood and not just tears and si ghs that follow my death. I wish the best for you and my family. I know you will manage just fine without me. Yours affectionately Mrs Mary Paul Lefroy Jane was once again struck by the selflessness this remarkable woman showed. Even when lying dying in her bed she showed that she cared for the rest of the world, when any other person would be praying for his or her own life. Jane sat down to write a letter inviting her mother and sister to come to Limerick in two weeks time. She longed to see them and longed to give them the great news. Mrs Austen would finally have one of her daughters married well. She smiled slightly when thinking of her mother would react to the news of her daughter's upcoming marriage. She felt guilty for feeling happy at this time of sorrow, but she could not help herself. She was the happiest woman in the world. In perhaps a year's time she would walk down the aisle married to the one man she had ever loved. She was going to have everything she had ever wanted. How could one be but happy at that prospect? -xxx- Jane Lefroy opened the letter from her mother with shivering hands. It felt very odd to read something she had written while she was still alive now that she had died. Yet she wanted to read what she had written to her. She had helped the younger children through their letters and was pretty sure that the content of the one written to her was similar. June, 1814 My dearest Daughter, How I shall miss you and your brothers and sister and your father. It is with great pain I write this letter that I know you will read after my death. But there it is. Lord has decided my fate and there is nothing anyone can do about that. Know that I love you all dearly and am at this moment, when you read this, sitting quite happily on a little cloud watching over you all. Jane's eyes were clouded with tears and she could hardly go on. She gazed out of her window in search of a cloud where her mother would sit, there was but one on the otherwise darkening blue sky. She smiled weakly and went back to the letter. It pains me to leave you all alone so early in life, but I am sure that there will be a certain lady to take care of you all. Hopefully your father and Miss Austen has put their head strong foolishness aside and finally admitted their feelings so that you will have a new mother to love and cherish. I know that you are crying now, but believe me when I say that I am better off where I am now, than lying dying in my bed. I hope you find comfort in Miss Austen and turn your love to her. I am going to be with you always. I love you all! Your affectionate mother, Mrs Mary Paul Lefroy Jane threw herself on her bed and let the tears flow. She would miss her mother greatly and could not see how Miss Austen could take her place, though she loved her very much. But right now she grieved her mother. Tomorrow she would comfort her siblings and be strong for them, but tonight she wanted to be alone in her sorrow. -TBC- I hoped you approve of the letters from Mary. I felt like I had to include them since she had written them.[Chapter 25] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again.

You are too kind to a humble writer... Part 25: In which evil tongues flourish and more visitors come The days dragged themselves by, the Lefroy household tried go get by without the mistress of the house. But it was not easy. The funeral was coming closer. Tom had informed everybody of his wife's passing and was getting condolences from all over the country. He tried to stay strong in front of his children but at night he cried in Jane's arms. He was happy that she was there to comfort him and he did not know what he would have done if she had not been there. \"I love you so much, but I miss her,\" he whispered one evening as they wandered the rose garden with his heart filled with sorrow. He did not know how to go from there. He had thought everything would just work out in some way as Mary died, but now he was even more torn between the two loves of his life. He felt guilty for feeling happiness with Jane. \"I know, dear,\" she said and smiled through the dark. \"She was a very special woman and I do not expect you to forget or stop loving her.\" She took his hand and squeezed it. He admired her for her patience. It must not be easy to bear the sorrow of a whole family including her own on her shoulders. She had taken Mary's plea literary and was helping him and the children out in any way she could. She was practically running the household for him, with the help of Mrs Jones and Millie of course. They had accepted her as it were. Tom was sure these feelings of guilt would ease off eventually. Mary had given them her blessing, but already they were the talk of town. Miss Austen's presence in his house was apparently a very interesting topic in town, or at least that was what he had heard from reliable sources. He really hoped that the letter Mary wanted to be read at the funeral would shed some light on the shadows that were now cast over Miss Austen. It was mostly loose talk and gossip. Tom tried not to listen when the servants where discussing the latest word from town. Even though they all knew that Miss Austen had been personally invited by the former mistress of the house they took an interest in what was the talk of town. Tom's rescue of Miss Austen in the rain had found its way through the tea parlours of Limerick and everyone had an opinion about that. He was a respectable member of the society and should not be a target of such titter-tatter, but there was nothing he could do to stop it. He tried his best to keep the evil words from reaching the children's ears but they picked up the gossip from everywhere. He could not keep them from seeing their friends however much he wanted them to. They did not really care of what propriety and common conduct called for during the grieving period and Tom did not have the heart to tell them not to. He could not stand to see their sad little faces during supper or breakfast or any other time he happened upon them. They reminded him so much of their darling mother. -xxx- Jane Austen tried her best to be supportive and comforting for the family. Her own heart ached every time she saw the children's little sad faces. It was just not fair to lose a parent at such a young age. She hated to see them all dressed in black in the middle of summer, but what choice was there? Jane did not care for mourning clothes, but they had to be worn. She could see Tom was struggling with his emotions and the preparations for the funeral and she did not seek him out, but let him come to her. She continued her writing and sought her comfort in the rose garden which had become her favourite place since it was there Tom had finally admitted to loving her. She watched over the roses and helped out the gardener with what little she knew about taking care of flowers. She often fled outside just to get away from the servants constant discussion of the latest news from town. There was a lot of gossip about her in town from what she heard. Not much of it was true and some of it just pure evil. She tried not to let it get to her, but it hurt even though she knew it was untrue. Even if Millie and Mrs Jones knew it to be false she knew they were talking about it when she was not around. The stable boys and others found it very entertaining even if it was complete rubbish. \"Miss Austen?\" Jane Lefroy called as she came out of the house and ran towards the rose garden. \"Yes, Jane?\" Jane put her hand up to shadow her eyes from the sun. \"Miss Austen, there you are!\" Jane could see that there was an elderly couple following her behind her. \"Miss Austen, these are my grandparents, Mr and Mrs Paul,\" Jane Lefroy said as they met on the lawn. \"Miss Austen, what a delight to finally meet you,\" Mrs Paul said with a smile. Jane could see she was forcing herself to seem happy. \"Mr Paul, Mrs Paul, a pleasure,\" Jane said and curtseyed. She studied Mary's parents. \"Our daughter has told us all about you, Miss Austen,\" Mr Paul said. \"Oh, she has?\" asked Jane and continued hastily: \"I am so sorry for your loss. Though I only knew her for a little while she is greatly missed.\" Mrs Paul bent her head slightly as a thank you. Jane could see the tears that were forming in her eyes. \"We should get out of this heat.\" Everyone was wearing black and the July sun was relentless. \"Will you take tea with us in the drawing room, Miss Austen?\" Jane Lefroy asked. \"If you wish it, Jane,\" Jane answered and tried to read the expression on the mourning parents. What did they know of her? What had Mary told them? She was sure they had also gotten a letter from their deceased daughter. \"Please do, Miss Austen,\" Mrs Paul urged. \"Very well, then I shall,\" Jane said with a smile as she accompanied them towards the house. -xxx- Jane Lefroy was proud to introduce Miss Austen to her grandparents. They had not been able to visit sooner since they had been out of the country for a while. Her grandmother had been ill and therefore had sought out the healing powers of Bath. They had accompanied her father and her as far as to London on their journey there. London, thought Jane, felt like a life time ago. So much had happened since. Jane wondered what her mother had told them about Miss Austen. She was not sure whether her father had sent them the letter her mother had written to them before her death. Jane had of course told them everything about the famous authoress' stay in their house. . \"So, Miss Austen, Jane tells us you are acquainted with Thomas since you were younger?\" said her grandmother as Millie handed her a cup of tea. \"Yes, that is correct. Quite briefly as he visited my home county of Hampshire many, many years ago,\" replied Miss Austen with a slightly flushed face. Jane saw that Miss Austen did not want to venture further on that subject. \"They share the same taste in literature,\" said Jane. \"Oh, I see,\" said her grandmother. \"And you are a writer yourself as we understand it,\" said her grandfather. \"Yes, that is right,\" Miss Austen replied. \"I am afraid we are not familiar with your work, Miss Austen,\" her grandfather said. Jane felt slightly embarrassed of her grandparents. They had the air of being well read, but sometimes they seemed very ignorant of the world around them. \"I have told you about Pride and Prejudice !\" cried Jane. \"But of course, silly me,\" exclaimed Mrs Paul with a slight blush. \"Yes, well, I have tried to remain anonymous, Mrs Paul. You could not have known,\" Miss Austen said gracefully. \"Our daughter was an admirer of your work, Miss Austen, I am sure,\" said Jane's grandfather. \"She often mentioned your name in her last letters.\" \"Did she?\" Miss Austen looked surprised. \"Oh, yes, Miss Austen. She was so happy you accepted her invitation to come here.\" Miss Austen looked like she wondered what else Mary had written in her letters. Jane felt curious herself but before the conversation could go on they were interrupted by the arrival of her father. -xxx- Tom found his mother and father in law in the drawing room taking tea with Miss Austen and his eldest daughter. They had finally arrived back in the country and he was happy to see them. He knew they were devastated to not have been able to visit before their daughter's passing. But Mrs Paul had been ill as well and unfit to make the journey back to Ireland. He knew his wife had been longing to meet them one last time, but now they only got to see her in her final rest. \"Mr and Mrs Paul, I am so glad to see you both in good health,\" Tom said and squeezed their hands affectionately. \"And we you, under the circumstances,\" said Mrs Paul with a sad smile. \"How are you holding up?\" Tom asked his mother in law and eyed her with concerned eyes. She looked rather pale despite the heat. \"Oh, I have been better, but my time in Bath did me very good, indeed. But now, yes well…\" Tears filled her eyes. It was not right for a parent to have to bury their child. He could see that Jane Austen looked a bit uncomfortable while conversing with his wife's parents, which was quite understandable. He had forgotten to inform her about their arrival. He did not know how much Mary had told them about Jane's presence there. \"I have something for you, from Mary, she asked me to give it to you,\" Tom said and handed them the letter she had written for them. He was relieved to find that the gossip that flourished in town had not reached the ears of Mary's parents. For that he was thankful. He did not want them to judge Jane based on false rumours. Since they would continue to be in their life he wanted them to be acquainted with Jane without any assumptions based on evil tongues. His mother in law read the letter and handed it over to her husband without a word. He read it through and then looked up with queering eyes at Tom. \"Perhaps we should discuss the content of this letter in private, Thomas,\" said Mr Paul with a concerned look on his face. \"I think so too,\" agreed Mrs Paul and glanced hastily at Jane. \"We could use my study. Miss Austen, if you will excuse us?\" Jane stood up; \"But of course! It was a pleasure to meet you, Mrs Paul, Mr Paul.\" Jane curtseyed and the courtesy was returned by the Pauls who hastily followed Tom outside. \"This way, if you please,\" he said and ushered them towards his study. -TBC- How am I doing in prolonging it? Great, I hope...[Chapter 26] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again. They begin questioning their actions and choices in the past (i.e. from the time they met in 1795 and forward).This is what could have happened if the movie had not ended. Disclaimer: I do not own Jane Austen, Tom Lefroy or any other character in this story. Facts are taken from the Becoming Jane Fansite. Author's note: I'm sorry this chapter took a little longer to be finished, but a lot is happening in my life at the moment. Keep the reviews coming, I love them! Part 26 : In which Mary's dying wish is the topic of conversation July 1814 \"I am sure there is nothing to worry about,\" said Jane Lefroy to Miss Austen as they watched her father leave the room with her grandparents. Miss Austen however did not look convinced. \"You are probably right,\" replied Miss Austen at length and tried to smile. Jane wondered what her mother had written in that letter that had upset her grandparents so. By the look of the glances at Miss Austen, Jane suspected her mother had written about her wish for Miss Austen to take her place as her father's wife. Jane was sure her mother's will would be done eventually. After the appropriate amount of time and mourning she was sure Miss Austen would stand as her father's bride. She had noticed how they were often found together in deep conversation. Her father seemed to seek her out more often than before. She supposed Miss Austen was the only one who could comfort him. \"I better go see to my siblings,\" Jane said and rose. \"Yes,\" Miss Austen replied with a faint smile as she rose as well. Jane watched as Miss Austen left the room with heavy steps. She so hoped that everything would turn out for the best and that her grandparents saw how much Miss Austen was needed in their life. Jane promised herself to try to show that to them during their stay. Her younger brothers had really started to rely on Miss Austen and went to her for comfort rather than their older sisters and brother. Miss Austen was the one that turned their beds and tucked them in at night and also the one that greeted them at the breakfast table every morning. She had really stepped in as their surrogate mother. Where their father had been absent Miss Austen had been present. For that Jane was glad. She did not know how she would have gotten through the last week if it had not been for Miss Austen. -xxx- Tom watched Mary's parents cautiously. He suspected that Mary had written about her want for him to marry Miss Austen in her letter to them. He could well understand their shocked faces. He hoped that they would not be too hard on him. They seemed to like Jane well enough at least. He could not imagine what was going through their head at that moment. He led them into his study and sat down behind his desk after showing them the two chairs in front of the desk. \"Are you aware of what our daughter is suggesting in her letter?\" started Mr Paul and turned his dark blue eyes to Tom. Mr Paul had a stern look on his face. \"I have a hunch,\" Tom said with a forced smile. \"Do you intend to honour her wishes?\" Mr Paul demanded to know. Tom wondered what his father in law wanted to hear. Either way his answer would show disrespect to his late wife. \"You have not promised Miss Austen anything, I am sure,\" stated Mrs Paul. Tom sighed. \"Mary asked Miss Austen to come here to take care of me and the family after she was gone,\" replied Tom. He could hear Mrs Paul's shocked gasp for air.\"It was her dying wish, no?\" \"And you intend to take Miss Austen as your wife?\" Mr Paul's eyes had gone cold. \"How can I deny Mary's her dying wish?\" Tom looked haplessly at Mary's parents. \"Have you no regard for our daughter?\" Mrs Paul sobbed. \"You know I have nothing but the highest regard for Mary!\" cried Tom heatedly. \"And believe me when I say I tried to make her change her mind. But she would not listen. I told her how inappropriate it would be.\" He felt the tears burn in his eyes. He could not believe they dared question his love for their daughter. \"Where does Miss Austen stand in all this? I am sure she is much too sensible to fall for a dying woman's wishes?\" said Mrs Paul. \"I cannot answer for Miss Austen, you will have to ask her yourself,\" Tom sighed. What ever he said now it was sounding wrong as soon as the words left his mouth. He was confused and sad over the fact that Mary's parents took Mary's dying wish so lightly. \"Are you marrying Miss Austen?\" Mrs Paul demanded to know. Tom felt a tear slipping down his cheek. \"Yes,\" he whispered meekly. The Pauls' eyes dilated in shock. \"Mary asked me to. She wanted me to marry Miss Austen.\" He heard how meek it sounded as soon as the words left his mouth. \"It has nothing to do for my disregard or me not loving Mary. I do love Mary with all my heart! I am honouring her dying wish. Why cannot you see I do it in regard for her?\" he begged them to understand. \"And Miss Austen? She has accepted?\" Mr Paul said with a dumbfounded look on his face. \"Yes, she has accepted me.\" \"You cannot be serious,\" Mrs Paul cried. \"It is not as if we are getting married by the morrow!\" cried Tom. \"We will wait the appropriate amount of time of course. I can promise you that neither I nor Miss Austen means any disrespect to Mary in any way.\" \"Were you and Miss Austen romantically involved when you were young?\" This was starting to feel like an interrogation. \"Yes,\" sighed Tom. He was getting more and more distress by the thought of Mary's parents not approving of their own daughter's final wish. He did not want to be disrespectful against them, but this was his house and Mary had been his wife. He would do as she had wished him to do and there was nothing her parents could do or say to make him change his mind. \"And these, feelings, have now risen again?\" Mr Paul asked uncomfortably. \"Yes,\" replied Tom. -xxx- Jane Austen paced her room restlessly, round and round. Mary's parents had looked completely shocked after reading their daughter's letter. She had been sure they had liked her before reading the letter. Now she was not as certain. She was sure Mary had written about her wanting Tom to marry her, and she was equally certain that Mary's parents did not approve at all. Jane hoped that Tom could talk some sense into them or at least make them understand. She could not bear to lose him, not again, not like this. Jane had foolishly thought that everything would sort itself out without any troubles or questions. She had let the dream of a happily married life with Tom cloud her sensible side. Of course there would be talk. There were already rumours about her actually killing poor Mrs Lefroy for her own benefit. There would be even more talk after the funeral when Mary's letter had been read. Once again she began thinking of leaving. She did not know how she would cope with all the talk she knew would flourish. Her only comfort was the thought of her mother and sister's arrival next week. She wished Eliza and Henry could join them also, but two family members were more than enough. She so hoped her mother would finally approve of Tom. Her reputation was not in danger this time. But Jane was starting to fear that Tom's reputation was on the line this time. -xxx- Tom stared at Mary's parents. \"I am afraid there is nothing you can do or say to make me change my mind,\" he said resolutely. \"I was forced to give Miss Austen up once in favour of your daughter. I chose Mary. Now Mary has given me and Miss Austen another chance along with her blessing and I will not give Miss Austen up this time. I hope that, in time, you will come to understand and love Miss Austen as I and my children already do.\" The look on his face showed his parents in law that it was no use in discussing the matter further. His mind had been set. Mr and Mrs Paul exchanged looks and sighed dejectedly. \"I am sorry to say that we cannot stay here as long as she is in this house,\" Mr Paul spat out the word 'she' as if it was something distasteful. \"I am sorry you feel that way,\" replied Tom harshly. \"Your grandchildren will be devastated to hear you are leaving so soon.\" \"Oh, they are welcome to stay with us any time, perhaps very soon,\" said Mrs Paul coolly and rose. \"We will see you at the funeral. Good day, Mr Lefroy.\" She took her husband's arm and left Tom's study. Tom let out a sigh of relief. He could not imagine that they would be so against him following the wishes of their only child. He would have thought they would respect him for that. \"Oh, Mary, look what you have done!\" cried Tom to the empty room. -xxx- Jane heard the aggravated raised voices from down stairs. She opened her door slightly. Mr and Mrs Paul were obviously not happy with the outcome of their conversation with Tom. \"Fetch our carriage, Jones,\" snapped Mr Paul to the servant. \"We are leaving this instance!\" \"Should not we say goodbye to the children?\" Mrs Paul asked. \"I am sure Thomas will explain.\" \"But I have not even had the chance to meet them all,\" objected Mrs Paul. \"It cannot be helped, Jane. I will not stay another minute in this house of sin!\" Jane gasped and clasped a hand over her mouth. Their conversation with Tom had gone terribly wrong indeed. What they must think of her. House of sin? \"Jeffry!\" cried his wife. \"I am sure it is nothing like that. Thomas is a respectable man. He would never...\" Their voices trailed off as they exited the house. Jane closed her door as carefully as she had opened it and sat down on her bed feeling disheartened. Tom had obviously stood up and defended their love and his decision to honour Mary's dying wish. Only her parents did not seem to share this notion of honouring the dead. \"Oh, Mary, look what you have done!\" Jane sighed to the empty room. -xxx- Jane Lefroy came out of the stables just as her grandparents sat up in their carriage. She could see that they were not satisfied with their meeting with her father and it saddened her immensely. \"Are you leaving so soon?\" she cried and ran over to them. \"Yes, I am sorry,\" said her grandmother with heated cheeks. \"Your grandfather has just remembered that he was needed in town.\" Jane knew she was lying. She wondered why she would lie to her. \"Oh, I see. Will you return later then?\" she asked innocently. \"No, I am sorry, Jane. But we will see you at the funeral,\" her grandfather promised with a forced smile. \"Yes, I will see you then,\" replied Jane and tried to look satisfied with the answer. But inside she was confused. What had gone so wrong? Why did they have to leave when they had just arrived after a long time abroad? \"Give our love to your brothers and sister,\" her grandmother called as they carriage started rolling. \"And Miss Austen I am sure?\" Jane called back. Her grandmother's face darkened and she pursed her lips in a look of dismay. Then they were too far for Jane to hear any reply, though she was sure there was not any. She sighed. Her father and grandparents had been arguing over Miss Austen, she was sure. They did not approve that was obvious. \"Oh mamma, what have you done?\" she sighed. -TBC- Oh how will it end? Will they reconcile? Stay tuned for the next chapter... Same channel next week.[Chapter 27] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again. They begin questioning their actions and choices in the past (i.e. from the time they met in 1795 and forward).This is what could have happened if the movie had not ended. Disclaimer: I do not own Jane Austen, Tom Lefroy or any other character in this story. Facts are taken from the Becoming Jane Fansite. Author's note: Again, sorry for the delay. I have experienced a slight writers block. Part 27 : In which the Pauls' departure makes people think Tom was still in his study just sitting down when his daughter came to sought him out to tell him to come for dinner. \"Is everything alright, papa?\" she asked and looked at him with concerned large blue eyes. \"Yes, everything is fine, Jane,\" he said, then continued: \"Well, no they are not. We will not have the pleasure of your grandparents company, I am afraid.\" \"I thought as much, grandmamma looked very vexed indeed as they left.\" \"I am sure she did,\" Tom said with a small smile. He had always admired Mary's parents, but this time they had gone too far. \"I am confused, though,\" said his daughter. \"Why is that?\" \"They seemed to like Miss Austen well enough before mamma's letter. They said that mamma had written about her and so on.\" Jane's face was turned into a frown of confusion. Tom wondered vacantly how much she understood of what had happened between him and her grandparents. She was sometimes too clever for her own good. \"How do you know it is regarding Miss Austen? And, Jane, do not fret yourself about that. They are in mourning and in those times people say things they do not intend to. You have to remember that they have lost a daughter. I am sure everything will be sorted,\" said Tom and added 'eventually' under his breath. He followed his daughter out of his study. -xxx- Jane Austen had not seen Tom since Mr and Mrs Paul had followed him to his study. She had thought he would come and seek her out, but he had not. She was slightly worried about him. Mr and Mrs Paul had not seemed happy at all when they left. A soft knock on the door brought her back. She rose and smoothed out the creases on her black dress and called 'enter'. She wished it would be Tom's dark head that peeked around the door, but it was not, it was Millie telling her that dinner would be served in five minutes. \"Thank you, Millie,\" Jane said with a forced smile. \"Mr and Mrs Paul left again, Miss Austen, so it will be just the family as usual.\" \"I see,\" replied Jane. Millie looked like she wanted to say something else, but she held her tongue. \"I will be down shortly.\" Millie curtseyed and left the room. Jane glanced at the mirror and put a few locks of hair that had fallen out of their restraints back in their place. She thought she looked tired. She tried to smile at her reflection but it looked more like a frown. She cursed her self for being so naïve. Then again, everything would probably work out for the best in the end. She had to believe that their love would conquer all. -xxx- Tom was eagerly awaiting Jane's entrance into the dining room. It felt like he had not seen her in days and now he longed to gaze upon her delicate countenance. He just wished the funeral was over so that they could concentrate on themselves without people talking behind their backs. When Jane finally entered the room he was sure she looked paler than usual. He was sure there was something on her mind, but now was not the time to talk about it. Only a few more days , he reminded himself. Then everything would hopefully sort itself out. He was meeting with the minister the next day to discuss matters regarding the sermon. He knew it was uncommon that any personal words be read in church. But that was the way Mary had wanted it and Tom intended to honour every last one of her wishes. Tom wanted to jump up and just whisk Jane into his arms and hold her and never let her go again. He wanted to whisper that everything was going to be alright. Presently he was uncertain of what the future held for them. He was sure that everything would be sorted eventually, but at what cost? Were they coming out alive at the other end, or was their love not enough? A cold knot formed in his stomach and he forced himself to smile encouragingly at his family and Jane. \"Miss Austen,\" said he and rose to pull the chair out for her. \"Mr Lefroy,\" replied she with the smallest hint of a smile in her delicate face. \"I am sorry to inform you that Mary's parents had to leave us in a hurry,\" said Tom as he sat down in his chair again. \"That is bad news, indeed,\" replied Jane gravely. He noticed how her face had gone slightly darker. \"Yes, Mr Paul recalled an engagement they had,\" Tom said vaguely. \"We will see them at the funeral again.\" \"I thought as much,\" Jane said. She looked down and concentrated on the food on her plate. Tom thought it looked like she was only moving the pieces around. He glanced around at the children, who also looked deep in thought and their little faces that this morning had lit up with happy anticipation were now solemn. The children had been looking forward to meet their grandparents for a long time. Now they would not get to spend time with them because their father was honouring their mother's last wish. He hoped his own father would understand his decision. Tom's parents had married for love against the will of his mother's family. Tom had always admired them and had looked at their very happy marriage as a role model for what he had looked for in life. They had been very happy together with or without money. He remembered his childhood's bright summers, all the Lefroy children running around as free as they wanted. His parents loving them and giving them a good start in life with healthy values. He loved his large family. Then judge Langlois, his mother's brother, had come and whisked him away to London as his charge. His thoughts went to his brother Anthony who had been brave enough to marry the woman he loved. Which had resulted in his uncle's withdraw of his funds. Anthony had not cared. He found ways to support his little family. Tom sometimes wished he had been as brave. -xxx- Jane Lefroy saw that both her father and Miss Austen were very distant. Miss Austen did not eat anything but pushed the pieces of food around her plate. Over and over again. Jane wondered if she knew why her grandparents had left. Jane had not said anything to the younger children but Anthony had understood what had happened as he saw their grandparents take a very hasty leave, without as much as a goodbye to anyone else than Jane. If Jane had not happened to be around no one other than their father had known what had happened or why they had left. She recalled the stern look on their faces and felt utterly sad that they had left. She found it even sadder that they had been in such a hurry that they had not had the time to say goodbye to the rest of the children. Jane herself hated being the bringer of bad news. But none of the other children had asked. She hated that her grandparents were so narrow-minded. She suspected that they knew nothing of love. She was sure their marriage had been arranged by their parents. And although they had grown attached to each other, Jane could not see any love in their gazes upon the other. Her parents had also been forced together but Jane saw how much they had loved each other. Of that she was sure. She wondered why her grandparents had not given Miss Austen a chance. Hopefully they would see the affection she showed their grandchildren at the funeral and come to their senses. She dearly hoped that they wanted the family to be happy after her mother's passing. Life had to go on, no matter how sad everything was right now. This was what her mother had wanted for them. And as her father intended to honour her wishes so did Jane. -xxx- Jane Austen had no appetite after what she had heard earlier. She thought of what Mary's parents must think of her to call the house a house of sin. But there was no sin in the house. Everything was perfectly innocent. And what had happened was under the blessing of the former mistress of the house. Jane wondered what sort of parents did not want to honour the wishes of their beloved child. All Jane wanted was to talk to Tom about it, but this was not the place. The children were quieter than usual, and Jane knew it to be because of their grandparent's hasty departure. They had been talking about their arrival for days, and now they came and left before even saying good bye. She wondered what sort of people the Pauls' were. Not too caring, she imagined. They had after all put their own daughter out on the marriage market without even considering what she wanted. Mary had said that she had not been too hard to persuade into liking Tom. Jane could easily understand that. Tom was very charming and such an amiable person on closer acquaintance. Her parents had married for love. She loved them for it, and even though her mother had been trying to get her to marry various rich suitors, Jane had always wanted to have what her parents had. Even if money would be short. She would rather love and starve than eat well and not love at all. She wondered what her mother would say to her upcoming marriage to Tom. She hoped she would at last approve of him and recognise the happiness it would bring. Jane longed for the funeral to be over. Then perhaps everything would start to go back what they used to, or at least they would not have to worry about what people said about them. It was only a few more days. Then they could focus on the rest of their life together. -TBC- Next on I Remember Love , a funeral and more visitors.[Chapter 28] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again. They begin questioning their actions and choices in the past (i.e. from the time they met in 1795 and forward).This is what could have happened if the movie had not ended. Disclaimer: I do not own Jane Austen, Tom Lefroy or any other character in this story. Facts are taken from the Becoming Jane Fansite. Author's note: Firstly; this chapter took a bit longer to write since I had to do some research regarding the funeral service and what that entails. If you still find things that you think are odd or not suitable for the period, I will call it artistic freedom. I have used the Book of Common Prayer as a starting point, using the section called 'At the burial of the dead' . Secondly; someone pointed out that Jane Austen dies in 1817. Perhaps more of you out there are worried that our heroine will die as she did in real life. But no, do not worry, my dears. In my AU-fic Jane Austen will not die. If she were to die the whole idea of my story is kind of wasted. Mary took Jane's place in heaven. Tom is not to be left again. Part 28 : In which Mrs Mary Paul Lefroy is buried \"You are aware, of course, of how highly unconventional it is for someone to read a letter during a funeral?\" said Mr O'Reilly, the priest, to Tom the next day. \"I am aware of that. But I intend to honour my wife's wishes. I know you are aware of that there has been talk of Miss Austen and why she is presently in my house. This letter will clear her of any accusations,\" replied Tom sternly. \"Well then, in this particular case I will make an exception. But only because Mrs Lefroy asked me in person last time I spoke to her,\" the priest said. \"I am much obliged, Mr O'Reilly,\" said Tom with a slight bow of the head. \"May I read the letter before the sermon?\" asked Mr O'Reilly. \"Of course,\" replied Tom. \"I brought it with me to leave with you.\" Tom handed him Mary's letter. \"You have not read it?\" Mr O'Reilly looked surprised to find the letter unopened. \"Mary asked me not to.\" \"I see.\" \"Is there anything else you need from me, Mr O'Reilly?\" asked Tom. He was eager to leave and return to his family. \"No, I think that is all I need from you at this point, sir,\" the priest replied with a mild smile. Tom rose and shook his hand. \"Thank you for doing this for me and for Mary, Mr O'Reilly,\" Tom said. \"That is what I am here for, Mr Lefroy,\" said the priest and looked at Tom with reassuring brown eyes. Tom felt safe and trusted the man completely. Mr O'Reilly had been visiting Mary several times the weeks before her passing. He would know what she wanted if Tom did not. -xxx- \"How did it go with the priest, Tom?\" asked Jane Austen as she met him in the vestibule. \"Very well. He was most obliging,\" replied Tom with a relieved smile. \"Oh, good.\" Jane felt a bit of the tension that had been building up inside ease off. She longed for him to take her in his arms and hold her. Since Mary's parents short visit they had not been alone together at all. It was like a silent agreement between them that they remained cautious until after the funeral. Even if they knew how completely innocent their relationship was the rest of the village did not. The Pauls' hasty departure and sour faces had only caused more gossip to flourish. Jane could not believe some of the things people came up with. But as long they were talking about her she could handle it. She was not the first scandalized authoress in history. But when it came to Tom… She did not want him to be treated ill because of her. \"What are you thinking of, Jane?\" Tom's voice woke her up from the dark thoughts. \"Oh, nothing, Tom,\" she replied and tried to smile reassuringly. \"I do not believe you. I have seen that face before. Are you worried, my dear?\" Jane met his queering blue eyes. \"Only a little bit,\" she admitted. He took her hand and pressed it affectionately. \"I am sure everything will be fine after the funeral,\" said Tom. \"I wish I could be as certain,\" said Jane with a faint smile. \"I am sure Mary's letter will work wonders,\" said Tom. -xxx- Tom hated the worried look on Jane's face. It reminded him of the way she had looked at the inn before she left him. He knew she would not leave him again but he was still worried about her. Her eyes shone dark in her pale face. He could see that all the talk, how false it may be, was getting to her. He squeezed her hand once more and smiled encouragingly. \"I am sure Mary's letter will work wonders,\" said he. A small smile crept onto her face. \"Let us pray for that,\" said Jane and pressed his hand. He could see that some of the tension was wearing off. It gladdened him. He wanted to see her smiling and be happy. \"We shall conquer this,\" he smiled and brought her hand up to his lips to brush it gently with his lips. -xxx- The day of the funeral finally came. The day was gray and the rain hung midair as if the heavens would open its doors at any given moment. The church had been decorated with all of Mary's favourite flowers. Tom was happy to see so many friends and acquaintances there. It seemed as if all of Limerick had come to see Mary off to her final resting place. She had been very well liked in the county, helped out wherever she could, helping the poor and so on. Mary's parents stood by the entrance to the church and shook hands with mourners showing their respect. Tom felt himself shrink at the sight of them. He met Mr Paul's ice blue gaze and looked away. He had not let them in on the part where Mary's letter was to be read during the service. They had no idea. He looked around in search of Jane Austen. She stood a bit to the side with the children around her. All the Lefroy children were present but little George, who Tom had thought too young to attend the funeral. Jane smiled encouragingly and Tom returned it shakily. He was so glad that she was there to share this day with him. She was a support for both him and his children. He did not know how they would have survived without her by their side. A heavy hand landed on his shoulder and brought him back to reality. He looked to his side and found his father standing next to him. \"Father!\" Tom was happy to see him. He had been very helpful in the planning of the funeral, even though he had not been able to join them until this day. \"How are you, son?\" His father's eyes shone brightly. \"As well as expected, I guess,\" replied Tom and pressed his father's hand affectionately. \"I know how you feel. I still miss your mother to this day,\" said his father and his blue eyes went sad. \"So do I.\" Tom walked slowly over to Jane and his children. \"Father, there is someone I want you to meet.\" \"Is there?\" Mr Lefroy looked at him. \"Yes,\" said Tom as he stopped in front of Jane. \"May I present Miss Jane Austen? Miss Austen, this is my father, Mr Lefroy.\" \"A pleasure,\" said Jane with a curtsy. \"Indeed,\" replied Mr Lefroy with a quizzically look at Jane and then at Tom. Tom had no time to explain the connection further as the bell rang and it was time to enter the church. Tom and his father escorted his family inside. They were to enter last with Mary's parents. He could see the Pauls' disapproving glances towards Jane Austen, but Tom would not let them have their way. Mary had told him exactly how she had wanted it. Jane Austen was to be at Tom's side from this day forward. It was with heavy steps and lowered heads the Lefroys, Pauls and Jane Austen entered the church to be seated in the front rows. Tom sat down with Anthony, Jane and Anne on his side and the Pauls seated themselves at the far end of that row, while Jane Austen, Mr Lefroy, Thomas and Jeffry seated themselves on the row behind them. When all was seated the priest and the clerks walked down the aisle and the priest spoke: \"'I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die',\" Mr O'Reilly reached the altar and turned around to look at the congregation with mild brown eyes. \"'I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another.' \"'We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. The Lord give and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.'.\" Tom let his mind wander vacantly as the first psalm was read. His eyes constantly fell on the coffin in the middle of the church, in front of the priest. In there lay his beloved wife. A tear freed itself from his eyelashes and rolled down his cheek. He could hear stifled sobs from all over the church. He took hold of his eldest daughter's hand and pressed it. He wanted it to be Jane Austen's hand but she was sitting on the row behind him with his father. Another psalm was sung and soon Mary's letter was to be read. Tom felt a slight nervous flutter in his stomach. He was a bit anxious about the reactions the letter would bring. He expected the worst. But he was to stand tall and not budge. He knew Mary's parents would object, probably not out loud but with their eyes. And especially, they would voice their opinion after the sermon. He knew he could count on his father's support as well as Jane Austen's. His children would also stand by him. This is for you, Mary! Tom lifted his eyes to the ceiling when the psalm was sung. This is it. \"Before the lesson I have been asked by Mr and Mrs Lefroy that a letter from Mrs Lefroy be read,\" begun Mr O'Reilly. Tom could hear the congregation's ill-hidden gasps. \"We are all aware of how unconventional this may be, but it was Mrs Lefroy's wish that the letter was read during her funeral.\" Mr O'Reilly looked out over the people in the church. \"This is what Mrs Lefroy wrote in her letter, I will read it as it is written: 'Dear Sirs and Madams, To begin with I want to assure you all that when I write this letter I am in full clarity and as sane as I have ever was. My life is now running away from me and when this letter is read I am no longer with you. I have asked both my husband and Mr O'Reilly to make sure this letter is read at my funeral. I would like to take this opportunity, when I have everyone's unabated attention, to make my last wish known to the world. By now I am sure some of you have received a letter from me. They were written just before I started writing this letter. This is not an easy task I assure you, but I believe I must explain my last wish and some of my recent actions. As you all know I have invited an old acquaintance of my husband's to our house, a certain Miss Austen. My daughter met her briefly in London and found her vastly interesting and indeed an old close friend of her father's. Both Jane and my husband are admirers of Miss Austen's work, as am I. She is an authoress, I might add, of what, I will not tell you since she still wishes to remain anonymous. It was my intention to make the old feelings between Miss Austen and my husband recur. I know the whole story of what happened just before and around Tom and mine engagement. In some way I feel I stole Tom from Miss Austen. Tom chose me; or rather Miss Austen made that choice for him. She let him choose the right path and not bring ruin to his family. For that I respect her immensely, it must have taken all her will power to leave the man she loved. I know she loves Tom as much as I do. And it is my last wish that they be together this time. Forever. In my last will and testament I leave Miss Austen my husband. This has nothing to do with anybody else. No one has influenced me in any way. This is all my doing. This is what I want for my family. Do not think ill of Miss Austen. She travelled from England under the pretence that she was to meet a dying admirer who wanted nothing else to meet her before she died. Do not think ill of my sweet husband, Mr Tom Lefroy, he knew nothing of my match making scheme before Miss Austen arrived. They both tried to talk me out of the notion. Kept on telling my how highly inappropriate it was. But I knew my will was going to be done in the end. All I want is for my family to be safe and in good hands. I do not wish for my children to grow up without a woman in their life. Female guidance for young women is essential, and I do not want them to grow up with several governesses that come and go. Miss Austen was my choice for my family. I know she will fill my shoes perfectly. I know that since I know for a fact we are the same size. (This brought on nervous laughter from the congregation.) Tom and Miss Jane Austen, you hereby have my blessing. Mr Barrington, our physician, can verify that I wrote this letter by myself and most willingly without anyone else in the room. This, Sirs and Madams, is my final wish. I want Tom to marry Miss Austen as soon as propriety finds it acceptable. God bless you all. Mrs Mary Lefroy.' And that is what was in the letter,\" Mr O'Reilly finished and folded the sheets of papers. The church was dead silent. Nobody even stirred in their seats. Tom did not dare move his head to catch a glance of Mary's parents' expression. He knew they were in shock. Tom himself was shocked over how openly Mary had described her wishes and why. His daughter squeezed his hand encouragingly. -xxx- Jane Austen sat frozen. She had known Mary's letter would be read, but she had never expected what it would contain. There was in no way she could have even dreamed of Mary's openness and almost naive wish for her family's happiness and that everyone would think that her wish was to be followed. Would that letter make the gossip end or flourish even more? Jane believed the latter to be more correct. At least the letter showed her innocence in the whole affair as well as Tom's. She discreetly glanced over at the Pauls and found them staring at the priest with blank eyes and mouths wide open in disbelief. Serves them right. House of sin, indeed. Now everybody knew she and Tom had Mary's blessing. Jane could not concentrate on the lesson Mr O'Reilly held. Her thoughts wandered back and forth through a dark forest of worries and dreams. She was brought back to reality when Tom, Mr Lefroy, Anthony and Mr Paul rose to carry the coffin outside to the graveyard. The two clerks helped them. Tom and Mr Paul were in front, Anthony and Mr Lefroy in the middle and the clerks at the back. Mr O'Reilly led the procession outside and the rest of the congregation followed. As the coffin was made ready to be laid into the earth the priest spoke: \"Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and is full of misery. He cometh up, and is cut down, like a flower; he fleeth as it were a shadow, and never continueth in one stay.\" The participants placed themselves around the coffin and the hole in the ground. Mr O'Reilly stood in front of the coffin. He continued: \"In the midst of life we are in death: of whom may we seek for succour, but of thee O Lord, who for our since art justly displeased? Yet, O Lord God most holy, O Lord most mighty, O holy and most merciful Saviour, deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death. Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts; shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer; but spare us, Lord most holy, O God most mighty, O holy and merciful Saviour, thou most worthy Judge eternal, suffer us not, at our last hour, for any pains of death, to fall from thee.\" One of the clerks took a small spade and handed it to Tom for him to use to cast earth upon the coffin. Mr O'Reilly continued: \"Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of his great mercy to take unto himself the soul of our dear sister here departed, we therefore commit her body to the ground; earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust; in sure and certain hope of the Resurrection to eternal life, through our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall change our vile body, that it may be like unto his glorious body, according to the mighty working, whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself.\" Jane felt tears roll down her cheeks and she grabbed hold of Thomas and Jeffry who stood next to her. They leaned towards her and she could hear their sniffles. Everybody voiced in: \"I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, Write, From henceforth blessed are the dead which die in the Lord: even so saith the Spirit; for they rest from their labours.\" Mr O'Reilly started: \"Lord, have mercy upon us.\" And the congregation repeated: \"Christ, have mercy upon us.\" Mr O'Reilly repeated his sentence and then all joined in the Lord's Prayer. \"Our Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, As it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation; But deliver us from evil. Amen.\" Jane closed her eyes. The tears kept on running down her cheeks. \"Almighty God, with whom do live the spirits of them that depart hence in the Lord, and with whom the souls of the faithful, after they are delivered from the burden of flesh, are in joy and felicity; We give thee hearty thanks, for that it hath pleased thee to deliver this our sister out of the miseries of this sinful world; beseeching thee, that it may please thee, of thy gracious goodness, shortly to accomplish the number of thine elect, and to hasten thy kingdom; that we, with all those that are departed in the true faith of thy holy Name, may have our perfect consummation and bliss, both in body and soul, in thy eternal and everlasting glory; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\" Mary's coffin was lowered into the earth. Jane let the single rose she was holding sail down onto the coffin. Mr O'Reilly read the collect, but Jane did not hear another word. All she could think of was the extraordinary woman who lay in that coffin. The world had truly lost one of their saints. As the coffin found the bottom of the deep hole the heavens opened its restraints and let the world know how they grieved. Jane turned her face to the sky and let the soft rain cool off the hotness of her tear drenched face. -TBC- I hope I gave Mary the send off she deserves...[Chapter 29] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again. They begin questioning their actions and choices in the past (i.e. from the time they met in 1795 and forward).This is what could have happened if the movie had not ended. Disclaimer: I do not own Jane Austen, Tom Lefroy or any other character in this story. Facts are taken from the Becoming Jane Fansite. Author's note: Again I have used The Book of Common Prayer. After this I can finally focus on the more happy side of this story. Part 28 : In which Jane Austen is put to the test Mr O'Reilly read the collect as the coffin containing Mrs Lefroy was lowered into the ground: \"O merciful God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the resurrection and the life; in whom whosoever believeth shall live, though he die; and whosever liveth, and believeth in him, shall not die eternally; who also hath taught us, by his holy Apostle Saint Paul, not to be sorry, as men without hope, for them that sleep in him; We meekly beseech thee, O Father, to raise us from the death of sin unto the life of righteousness; that, when we shall depart this life, we may rest in him, as our hope is this our sister doth; and that, at the general Resurrection in the least day, we may be found acceptable in thy sight; and receive that blessing, which thy well-beloved Son shall then pronounce to all that love and fear thee, saying, Come, ye blessed children of my Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world: Grant this, we beseech thee, O merciful Father, through Jesus Christ, our Mediator and Redeemer. Amen.\" Tom watched the coffin with his beloved wife disappear down the dark hole in the ground. The rose he had been holding fell down on the coffin. Soft raindrops fell on his lowered head. Mary, his beloved wife, was gone and the heavens wept with him. Around him the sobs got louder and his daughters leaned against his frame. \"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.\" The funeral was over. Tom felt utterly drained of energy. He did not know how to continue on with the tea that was to be had in the rectory. He was not sure that he would be able to face all the questions and curious looks that were inevitable coming. Mary's letter had hopefully done its work. Everybody knew that he and Jane had her blessing to marry. She had even left Jane him in her will. Tom had no idea how to get through the reception, but he had to matter what. He had to stand up for Mary's wishes, for his family and Jane Austen. He braced himself for what was inevitably to come. He had to stand up for what he believed. He could feel the burning gazes from Mary's parents. They disliked surprises and this one had been large. They would probably skin him alive if they could. Tom knew not what to say to them now. Now at least it was made public that Mary wanted him to marry Jane. Hopefully the gossip would stop now. They could now focus on the rest of their life together. -xxx- Jane Lefroy was completely exhausted. She had no more tears to cry. The whole ordeal was just too much for a twelve year old. Her mother was gone. Just when her mother's coffin was disappearing into the dark hole of the ground and it started raining, she felt totally and utterly alone in the world. She had turned to her father for support. Had he not been nearby she would have fallen to the ground in pure despair. She knew her mother's letter had caused a lot of different reactions, but it was not until she saw her grandparent's dark faces she truly understood. Her father had not told them about that the letter was going to be read. Seeing them now, Jane realised it had been for the best. Had they been asked about it they would surely have objected. Her mother's last wish obviously meant nothing to her grandparents. She could not believe how little they seemed to care. They seemed to blame Miss Austen for everything. The person who was in the least responsible for anything. It had been all her mother's doing. But it was the family she left behind who had to deal with the consequences. Jane hoped they would all get through it in one piece. She doubted that anyone but her grandparents would dare question the letter. She could see that they tried to remain calm. Not wishing to make a spectacle of their daughter's funeral. -xxx- Jane Austen did not dare meet any of the eyes that were constantly glancing curiously at her. She tried to remain calm and composed though her inside was in chaos. She kept her head high as they entered the rectory. The rain had stopped and the sun was peeking out from behind the clouds. Mrs O'Reilly had, with the help of Mrs Jones, set the tables in the garden. Tea was to be had. Biscuits and cakes were placed throughout the tables, which was decorated with fresh flowers. Mary would have been pleased to see that it was not a completely sad day after all. She would not have wanted it all to be gloomy She would have wanted them to cherish the good memories of a living Mary. She had been a good natured person with a happy disposition and that was how she was to be remembered. Jane was sad that she had not got to know the lady better before she passed. She also regretted their last discussion. All those harsh words she had uttered. There was nothing she could do about it now though. Mary had gotten the final word and her wish was coming true. Jane smiled slightly and turned towards Tom. He caught her smile and winked at her. Her heart was filled with love for the gentleman that was now seating himself on the other side of the table where she was standing. Suddenly it felt as if everything was going to be fine. Their love would conquer all obstacles. Nobody could stand in their way. So far none of the present had come forward to talk to Jane or Tom. The Pauls sat grim looking on the other side of the rectory's garden. Nobody dared be caught in their way. It was obvious to all who was there that they did not accept their daughter's action. They sat alone at their table since no one dared be seated next to them. Jane was sure they would not apologise, but for their grandchildren's sake she hoped they would come to their senses. \"Miss Austen?\" said a deep voice behind her. She turned and found Tom's father standing behind her. \"Mr Lefroy,\" replied Jane with a puzzled face. \"Might I have a word?\" \"Of course,\" said Jane and shot Tom a confused glance, but he smiled encouragingly back. \"Perhaps Miss Austen would indulge me for a walk?\" Mr Lefroy said and offered her his arm. \"That would be delightful, Mr Lefroy,\" replied Jane and took his arm. They walked out of the garden in thoughtful silence. Jane wondered what Mr Lefroy could want to talk to her about. They walked quite the distance in silence. At length Mr Lefroy spoke: \"I wanted to be out of hearing distance, Miss Austen.\" Jane looked up at him. She must have looked anxious because he continued: \"Oh, there is nothing to worry about, Miss Austen. I just wanted to be closer acquainted with the lady who is to be my son's wife.\" Jane relaxed. \"Oh, I see. There is not much to know, sir.\" \"I believe there is, Miss Austen. From what I have heard I find you most intriguing,\" said Mr Lefroy with a smile that made him look young and very much like his son. Jane knew not what to say to that. \"Indeed?\" was all she mustered. \"My grandchildren adore you, so does my son. I remember him mentioning you even when he was young; he talked about a dark eyed Hampshire lass once. I believe it must have been you, Miss Austen.\" Jane was a bit shocked to hear that Tom had mentioned her to his parents, even all those years ago. \"I see,\" was all she could say. \"Even my daughter in law thought the world of you,\" continued Mr Lefroy. \"May I ask you something, Miss Austen? \"Anything you want, Mr Lefroy,\" replied Jane. \"What happened?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Why did you choose not to stay with my son?\" His eyes showed honest curiosity. \"I...\" Jane hesitated, she knew not where to start. \"You loved him, no?\" \"Yes, I did love him. But our love would not have survived if it meant bringing ruin to your family. I know you depended on Tom's help, and without the support of his uncle, well... I could not let that happen,\" Jane said sincerely. \"One cannot live on love alone, no matter how deeply one feel.\" \"True,\" admitted Mr Lefroy. \"I did not want to be the ruin of Tom's career,\" continued Jane. \"There have been many times when I have regretted my choice. But I know it was for the best.\" \"And now Mrs Lefroy has given you a second chance,\" said Mr Lefroy. \"Will love survive this time, Miss Austen?\" \"I believe it will, Mr Lefroy,\" said Jane with a shy smile and flushed cheeks. \"I think so too. You both deserve it,\" said Mr Lefroy. \"You have my blessing, Miss Austen.\" \"Thank you, Mr Lefroy,\" said Jane with a bow of the head. \"Shall we turn back?\" \"Yes, I think that people will have started wondering where we are, Mr Lefroy.\" -xxx- Tom watched as his father and Jane entered the garden again. They both looked content. He knew his father would find Jane worthy. He wondered what they had been talking about since they had been gone quite some time. He decided to ask Jane about it later. \"What a lovely sermon, Mr Lefroy,\" said the lady next to him. \"I am glad you found it to your liking, Mrs Donaldson,\" replied Tom. \"Quite refreshing, I thought,\" the white haired lady smiled. \"Indeed,\" added her husband. \"We are so sorry for your loss, Mr Lefroy. Mrs Lefroy will be so missed,\" said another gentleman, a Mr Charleston. Tom nodded. \"But we see you have a worthy successor to take care of you, Mr Lefroy\" chuckled his wife. Tom smiled and glanced at Jane. \"Indeed I do,\" said Tom. He was happy to see that so many of his friends and acquaintances found the funeral and Mary's letter to their liking. He had also gotten remarks on how suitable Jane seemed to be and what a great asset to the society she would be. They were quite intrigued by the fact that she was a writer. The fact that Mary had given her consent went a long way of course. Tom felt more relaxed now than he had for a very long time. Jane was to be his wife. Nobody could stop them now. Not even the Pauls. He hoped for his children's sake that they would come to their senses, but he would not bet on it. He could see their unhappy faces on the other side of the garden. They grew grimmer for every word of encouragement his guests brought him. Tom could not care less. They could leave whenever they pleased. Nobody forced them to stay. Right now he longed to be alone with Jane, to hold her, knowing that it was now for the rest of their life. The reception could not finish soon enough. Jane helped Mrs O'Reilly and Mrs Jones to clear the tables when the last of the participants left. The light July night found Tom and Jane in the garden. \"It was a very lovely funeral, Tom. Mary would have been so pleased,\" Jane said. \"I think so too, Jane,\" said Tom with a sigh. \"I am glad it is over and done with. I was so worried.\" \"I know,\" said Jane. \"But the only ones that did not accept it was Mary's parents. And I, honestly, could not care less,\" snorted Tom. His former parents in law had not uttered a word to him, not even a polite goodbye as they left. \"I am sorry, Tom.\" \"I think I can manage. Soon I will have a new mother in law,\" he smiled. \"True, well, my mother can be a handful,\" chuckled Jane. \"I remember. Do you look forward to her stay here?\" \"Very, but most of all I long to see Cassandra.\" Tom took her hand and pressed it before bringing it up to his lips. \"I know, dearest.\" The word came out on its own, without thought. It felt right. Jane looked up at him with large dark eyes. \"I have something for you.\" Tom reached into his pocket and brought out a small box. \"You should not have...\" \"Shh,\" Tom cut her off. He opened the box and brought out a delicate golden necklace. He held it up for her to see. On the chain a small golden heart hanged. \"Tom!\" Jane breathed. \"It is beautiful.\" \"It is just a small token of my love.\" She turned to allow him to fasten the necklace around her neck. \"I love it,\" Jane said and turned back to him. He smiled. It suited her perfectly, simple as it was. \"Nothing can ever take you away from me again,\" he murmured and took the last step forward and folded her in his arms, pressing his lips against hers. -TBC- So , on with the love story! I love your reviews...[Chapter 30] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again. They begin questioning their actions and choices in the past (i.e. from the time they met in 1795 and forward).This is what could have happened if the movie had not ended. Disclaimer: I do not own Jane Austen, Tom Lefroy or any other character in this story. Facts are taken from the Becoming Jane Fansite. Author's note: Again I apologise for the delay. But as it is I'm pregnant with my first child (pardon my over revealing nature…), and well, my mind has been preoccupied with that lately. I'm afraid this chapter will be shorter than usual, but I wanted to have it out before going on holiday. Part 30: In which Jane has visitors \"Mother! Cassandra!\" Jane shouted as she hurried out of the house to greet them. \"Oh, Jane!\" cried her mother. \"What a journey! My poor bones!\" Jane helped her mother out of the carriage she had sent with Jones to pick them up. \"Cassandra,\" Jane smiled at her elder sister and embraced her tightly. \"I have missed you,\" whispered Cassandra. \"And I you,\" said Jane. \"Let me show you to your rooms.\" Jane ushered the ladies inside and showed them to their rooms which were situated close to hers, both facing the garden. Not even her mother could deny the beauty of the place. Jane hoped her mother would be pleased with what she saw since it would be Jane's home forever more. \"Lovely,\" murmured Mrs Austen as she inspected the view from her windows. \"Is it not?\" agreed Jane. \"So, when do I get to meet him?\" Mrs Austen turned her gray eyes to Jane's, frowning slightly. She had never really gotten over Jane's choice not to marry Mr Wisley. \"At supper, he had some business to attend to,\" replied Jane calmly. \"But the children will join us for tea in the garden whenever you are ready, mother.\" Her mother seemed satisfied with that answer. \"I will wash up and then join you in the garden,\" said Mrs Austen. \"I will tell Millie to prepare for tea,\" said Jane and quitted the room. She was happy to run into Millie just outside her mother's room. She quickly asked her to prepare for tea in the garden and then went to her sister's room. \"Tea will be ready in about half an hour,\" she said and sat down on the bed. \"Good, I am parched. All that dust on the road,\" said Cassandra. \"You sound like our mother,\" scolded Jane. \"I am sorry,\" smiled Cassandra. \"But the journey here was not an easy one.\" \"I know. Oh, Cassie, how I have missed you! There is so much to tell!\" Jane's hand flew up to the necklace around her neck. \"Is that new?\" asked Cassandra as she eyed the necklace. \"What?\" Jane looked down. She had not realised she was playing with the little heart. \"Oh, this?\" \"Yes, dear Jane, what else do you have that is new?\" Cassandra asked with a sly smile. \"Tom gave me this after the funeral,\" replied Jane with a shy smile and colouring cheeks. \"It is lovely,\" said Cassandra and admired the necklace. \"Suits you very well indeed. He has impeccable taste.\" \"Indeed he has,\" said Jane with even more colour on her cheeks. \"You love him as much as before,\" stated Cassandra. \"I must confess that the old feelings came back quite rapidly after my arrival here.\" \"I thought as much,\" said Cassandra. \"And now you are engaged to be married?\" \"Yes, as soon as propriety allows us to be wed, we will,\" smiled Jane. \"I am happy for you, sister.\" \"Thank you. I just wish everyone could be as happy as me.\" Jane pressed her sister's hand. \"It was very kind of Mr Lefroy to let you invite us here so soon after his wife's burial,\" said Cassandra. \"He was the one who suggested that you came. I missed you terribly and would have gone home otherwise,\" said Jane. \"And he would not let you go, of course,\" said Cassandra, smiling. \"Something like that,\" admitted Jane. \"Shall we go and get us some tea now, sister?\" Jane rose. \"Yes, I am starving,\" agreed Cassandra. -xxx- Jane Lefroy studied the two visitors as she sat with them for tea. Her father was busy with something and would not join them until later that evening. Mrs Austen and Miss Austen looked quite different from Miss Jane Austen. They were both fairer in the complexion with soft grey eyes while Miss Jane Austen was dark. The elder sister seemed to have a more serious disposition and not as outgoing as her younger sister. When Jane looked at her own siblings she could see a strong resemblance between them. If a stranger was to walk by he would directly see that they were related. But the Austen sisters were each other's opposites, not only in looks, but in mind too. Jane turned her eyes to the white haired lady who was to be her new grandmother. Mrs Austen had aged well, but the loss of her husband was written in the lines of her face. She did not, however, seem too pleased to be there. Jane wondered if Mrs Austen disapproved of her daughter's choice to rush to an old friend's wife's death bed. She vacantly played with the thought of Mrs Bennet's character being based off Mrs Austen. Time would tell. \"You are quiet today, Jane,\" said Miss Jane Austen suddenly, turning her dark eyes to her. Jane realised that her brothers and sister were all chatting away with the newcomers, while she had been deep in reflexion. Her sister Anne had taken to Miss Austen very fast after it was clear they both enjoyed sketching. \"I'm sorry, Miss Austen,\" said Jane at length. \"I have a lot on my mind.\" She smiled apologetically. Everything was different now when her mother was actually buried. Her father was slowly beginning to show his affections for Miss Austen openly. He seemed more at ease now that everybody knew they had his late wife's blessing. Jane knew how much the mindless gossip from town affected her father and Miss Austen. It had bothered herself as well even though she knew the truth. The thing that bothered Jane the most was that her grandparents had not been heard from since the funeral. Jane had decided not to be the one who took the first step to reconciliation. If they wanted contact they had to make the effort themselves. Jane had been very offended by the inconsiderate way they had behaved during the funeral. She was still astonished to find them so bigoted. She quickly decided not to dwell on such dark thoughts any longer. Her father seemed happy, as did Miss Austen. Jane sometimes caught them smiling longingly at each other, holding hands or deep in whispering conversation when they thought no one was around. Oh, how she longed to be at the receiving end of one of those loving smiles. -xxx- Tom had made himself scarce during the day with the excuse of having some business to attend to. Of course there were things for him to do, but nothing that urgent. He had wanted for Jane to receive her mother and sister without him present. He knew how much she had been missing them. Letters could only do so much. To be honest, he was a bit nervous to meet Jane's mother. He suspected she was not thrilled to be there. He knew she had been working against him in the past. Jane's family mattered to her and Tom wanted to be on good terms with his future mother in law. He planned to ask Mrs Austen for Jane's hand in marriage since Mr Austen had passed away. He truly hoped Mrs Austen would give her blessing. Surely she would find him worthy this time. Then there was Jane's brother, Henry, Tom's old friend who he had not heard from for years before meeting him in London. Perhaps Mr Austen and his wife could be persuaded to visit. Tom wanted to do this the right way for Jane's sake. It was all for her. His father had no objections toward the lady in question. He had found her most interesting. Tom was glad. He had not doubted his father's approval. He was quite sure his father would have given his blessing even back in the day if it had not been for judge Langlois. The days following the funeral had been spent in quiet reflexion. Not much had been said. Tom had sought comfort in Jane. Now that everything was out in the open they did not have to hide their affection anymore. A few villagers had actually come to offer apologies for believing the evil gossip of the town. Mary's letter had set things straight. The only ones that had not been heard from, which were not really to be expected, were Mary's parents. Tom really did not want them influencing his children and without and apology they would not be seeing their grandchildren any time soon. A soft knock on his study door brought him back from the dark thoughts. \"Come,\" he called and rose from his chair, hoping to see Jane's dark head peer around the door. But it was Millie's blond head that informed him that it was supper time. He nodded and smiled. \"Are our guests settling in?\" asked Tom. \"Oh yes, sir,\" replied Millie. \"Good,\" said Tom. \"Tell them I shall join them presently, Millie.\" Millie curtseyed and left Tom to himself. He smoothed out his unruly hair, still as thick as it had been since he was young. He shot an eye at the looking-glass and decided he looked well enough to be introduced to his future mother in law. He smiled at his reflexion. Tom was not worried. Jane was to be his wife. Her mother had to see what kind of life he could offer her daughter. -TBC- I'll do my best to write during my holiday![Chapter 31] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again. They begin questioning their actions and choices in the past (i.e. from the time they met in 1795 and forward).This is what could have happened if the movie had not ended. Disclaimer: I do not own Jane Austen, Tom Lefroy or any other character in this story. Facts are taken from the Becoming Jane Fansite. Author's note: With my mp3-player filled with love songs, lying in a little cabin by a lake in Sweden, this is what came out... Part 31 : In which Tom impresses his future mother in law \"Master will join you shortly, Miss Austen,\" said Millie as she entered the drawing room with a tray of refreshments. \"Thank you, Millie,\" said Jane Austen. For some reason she felt nervous. Even though her mother could do nothing but admire the house that was to be her daughter's new home, Jane could only hope for her mother to be civil. Her mother had not entirely forgiven her for not marrying Mr Wisley. Her stomach fluttered and she took a sip of the sherry Millie had offered her. Again she felt like a little girl waiting for the love of her life. Having her mother's blessing was important to her, but there was really nothing anyone could say to change Jane's mind. For once in her life she would not listen to what other people had to say. She had made her decision long ago. This time she was not turning her back on love. She really did hope that her mother would see that this was the life she wanted for herself. This time around the money was not an issue. Tom would have no trouble providing for her and their family and she could continue her writing. There was really nothing her mother could have to object. She heard his footsteps in the hallway and her face instantly coloured as she turned her eyes to the doorway, blushing as a little girl. Unknowingly she held her breath and her stomach fluttered. And there he was, filling the doorframe with his stature. Everybody's eyes turned to him. Jane did not dare glance at her mother, but kept her eyes on the man she loved with all her heart. \"Mrs Austen, Miss Austen, I am so pleased that you have come,\" Tom said as he hurried over to take their hands. Jane released her breath. Her mother smiled pleasantly. Perhaps the old age had softened her harsh opinions of the man in front of her. \"The pleasure is all mine, Mr Lefroy,\" said Mrs Austen and curtseyed. \"I am so sorry for your loss.\" Tom nodded and shot a hasty glance at Jane who only smiled back. Her mother showed her good side. Jane crossed her fingers and said a silent prayer that her mother would continue to be on her good behaviour all evening and throughout her stay at the house. Tom smiled broadly at his future mother in law. \"How do you like your room, Mrs Austen?\" inquired Tom. \"Oh, very well, indeed, Mr Lefroy,\" said Mrs Austen, looking truly bedazzled by the man in front of her. Jane felt proud and began to relax. Her mother would be charmed indeed. \"And I hope your room, Miss Austen, also is to your liking?\" said Tom and turned his eyes towards Cassandra. \"Oh yes, very,\" replied Cassandra. Before anything else could be said, Mrs Jones entered and declared that dinner was served. Tom gallantry offered Mrs Austen his arm with the words: \"Mrs Austen, allow me.\" Mrs Austen raised a questioning eyebrow but took the arm Tom offered and let him lead her to the dining room while Jane escorted her sister. \"Tom is really making mother feel welcome,\" whispered Cassandra. \"Yes, he wants to make a good impression on you both and make you feel at home,\" whispered Jane back. She was happy to see the impressed expression on her mother's face as they entered the dining room where the large table was set for four. Mary's exquisite taste had made the room bright and cheerful, not as dark and dull some dining rooms could be. Perhaps that is what happens when a female is allowed to do as she pleases. There was nothing Jane wanted to change about the room. -xxx- Tom escorted Mrs Austen to the table and seated her next to himself, opposite Miss Cassandra Austen. Jane was seated opposite himself. The nervous flutter in his stomach was starting to calm down. Mrs Austen seemed pleased with everything. Tom wanted her to see how much he cared for her daughter and how much it meant to him that Mrs Austen was pleased with him and the life he could offer Jane. Mrs Austen just had to see that. He glanced over at Jane who sat opposite himself and he caught her smiling eyes. He felt himself light up at the loving look she was sending him. He felt fairly sure of this being a sight he would see many a times again. His feelings for Jane grew with each day that went by. He still could not believe Mary for being so right about everything. She must have had a sixth sense. Tom sent her a loving thought as he cut the meat on his plate. Conversation around the table was slowly increasing as Jane asked about news from Hampshire and her brothers and their families. Nothing special had happened since she left. \"Perhaps you could write Mr Austen and his wife for a visit, Jane?\" Tom said when Cassandra said Jane's brother Henry had been asking about her when they last visited Chawton. \"That is a brilliant idea,\" said Mrs Austen with a pleased smile and Tom felt completely sure Mrs Austen would have no objections towards his marriage to Jane. \"Good, that is settled then,\" smiled Tom contentedly. \"Are you sure, Tom?\" Jane asked with a puzzled face. \"Of course, I have not heard from Henry since London. And I could use some male company,\" chuckled Tom. Jane sent him a queering glance and Tom's smile grew wider, assuring her it was now settled. He would not take no for an answer. He needed to ask Henry a very important question. \"I will write Henry and Eliza first thing in the morning, then,\" said Jane with a smile. Tom felt relieved that everything seemed to go their way now. At last everything was going to be fine. They finished their dinner and retired to the drawing room for a nightcap. \"Would a stroll in the garden be too much to ask?\" asked Tom as the drinks were finished. He had decided not to ask Mrs Austen for Jane's hand tonight, but tomorrow. He had to find her alone. \"I think Cassandra and I will retire,\" replied Mrs Austen with a small smile. \"But I am sure Jane would not mind.\" Tom saw Jane's astonished glance at her mother and smiled mischievously. \"Miss Austen?\" Tom held out his arm. \"Would you mind accompany me into the garden before retiring for the evening?\" \"How chivalrous of you, Mr Lefroy,\" said Jane with a slightly mocking tone and a smile but took his arm. \"It would be delightful with a stroll before bed.\" \"Good night Mrs Austen, Miss Austen,\" said Tom and bowed his head as he escorted Jane outside. -xxx- Mrs Austen stood some time by the windows looking down at the couple strolling in the garden. She had to admit that Mr Lefroy impressed her. Jane looked happier than she had in a very long time. He had grown into a very considerate and caring man, who could well provide for her daughter. He was not the rascal he used to be when he was young. He had a good reputation and a fine line of work. Jane would never have to depend on herself again. The fact that Mr Lefroy had offered to invite Henry and Eliza had proven he really cared for Jane and her wellbeing as well as her family. She would really be well off here. Mrs Austen was not blind to the love they showed for each other. Who was she to stand in their way this time? Everybody deserved a second chance, even an Irish rogue. And Mr Lefroy's late wife had given her blessing and left her husband to Jane in her will. Mrs Austen had seen in Jane's eyes that there was nothing she could say to make Jane change her mind. Jane was not taking no for an answer this time around. When the time came for Mr Lefroy to ask for her daughter's hand she would willingly give her blessing. Needless to say Mrs Austen was pleased with what she saw. Perhaps the mansion was a bit small for all the parties she could imagine throwing here. But surely Mr Lefroy could see that they would need to seek another house when the family grew. It was not too late for Jane to bare a child. Mrs Austen smiled. Another grandchild would be a blessing indeed. And Jane's to that. She had never thought either of her daughters would marry. Cassandra had not looked after another man since Mr Fowle died, and it saddened Mrs Austen. She wanted to see her children happy. Only then she could be happy herself. Lately she had found that she was living through her children and their families. It was times like these she missed her late husband the most. He had been the love of her life and even though money had been wanting most of the time, life had treated them well. But she had wanted better for her children. She still had not completely forgiven Jane for not marrying Mr Wisley, which would have given her a life of complete financial independence. But Jane was too headstrong for that and since love was lacking Mr Wisley was not the man for her. She had always gone her own way. Truth to be told, Mrs Austen was proud of her daughter's accomplishments as an authoress. She would never admit that to her face though. As the loving two came back towards the house, Mrs Austen crept into bed with a content smile on her lips. At least one of her daughters would be married well. -xxx- \"I believe you have charmed my mother,\" said Jane and squeezed Tom's hand affectionately. \"I must admit I was nervous before she came,\" replied Tom. \"But she seems more forgiving now than she did when we were young.\" \"Yes, I wonder what made her change,\" pondered Jane. She was happy that her mother seemed inclined to approve of her future husband. Perhaps her mother had finally understood that love was the greatest gift of all and would survive even without money. \"I am sure you know best, but I am sure she recognises that I can provide for you now, unlike I could in the past.\" \"True,\" admitted Jane, but surely money could not be all. Her mother had grown softer after her father died. The loss of her husband had left her heartbroken. Perhaps that made it easier for her to relate to Jane and Cassandra's heartache. Her father had been the only man in her mother's life. Jane gazed out over the garden and towards the descending sun. The last rays warmed her face and she felt at ease. Her mother would approve. Tom's arm circled around her waist and she leaned towards him, resting her chin against his chest. Jane felt she could stand like that forever and be perfectly satisfied. \"I am beginning to think we need a bigger house,\" said Tom suddenly. \"Why?\" \"If we are to provide housing for your brothers, sister and mother, there is simply not enough space here.\" \"We do not have to invite them all at once,\" Jane remarked softly. \"What about your siblings? Do not they come and visit?\" \"They live closer, only an hour away at the most. They do not have to spend the night as your relatives must.\" Jane had not thought of that. \"Also I want you to feel like it is your house. You can decorate and move furniture to your liking.\" \"You will have to stay in charge of the library. It will be a shame to leave this one,\" said Jane. \"There are too many memories here. I would not mind start afresh someplace new with you, my dear.\" Tom placed a soft kiss on her cheek. \"We will have to ask the children as well. They have friends here.\" \"Of course. I have to yet to find the perfect place for us,\" said Tom. Jane turned fully towards him and met his eyes. \"We do not have to move unless you really want to, Tom. I like it here. The garden especially,\" she said sincerely. She did not know if she would manage to duplicate this garden she had grown so fond of. \"I want to, Jane,\" he assured her. \"We can plan everything together. The garden especially, since we are both fond of walking in it.\" Jane gazed into his eyes, searching for something, but found only a pair of loving blue eyes looking back at her. A smile crept onto her face. \"I would like that,\" said she and stepped a bit closer and let her arms find their way around his waist. \"I would like that very much.\" -TBC- Thank you for all your congrats on my pregnancy. Yes I was selfish enough not to say anything until now. I'm only in week 15... As always it is your reviews that keep me going.[Chapter 32] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again. They begin questioning their actions and choices in the past (i.e. from the time they met in 1795 and forward).This is what could have happened if the movie had not ended. Disclaimer: I do not own Jane Austen, Tom Lefroy or any other character in this story. Facts are taken from the Becoming Jane Fansite. Author's note: I seriously do not have any excuse for being so late with this chapter, other than it has been a lovely vacation with lots of sunshine and needs to be outside, instead of inside in front of my computer. And it seems my muse thought it good to take a vacation too. Part 32 : In which Tom asks a very important question Tom woke up with a smile on his face and stretched out contentedly like a cat. The curtains could not completely keep the sunshine out of the room. There had not been a drop of rain since Mary's funeral. The Irish summer showed itself at its best. Tom blinked as a ray of light fell on his face. \"Another beautiful day. A good day to begin the rest of my life,\" said Tom and swung his legs over the edge of the bed. Today was the day he was going to ask Mrs Austen for her daughter's hand in marriage. Funnily enough he felt a bit nervous, even though he knew Mrs Austen could have nothing to object. He was a wealthy, respectable man, a sane mother could not object to such a prospect for her daughter. And Tom was pretty sure Mrs Austen was sane. He walked over to his windows and peeked out as he was not yet dressed. The sun drenched lawn glittered with dew. He smiled. This was going to be the beginning of something beautiful. Tom dressed quickly and went to see if anyone else was up. He doubted it, because it was quite early, but Jane was usually an early riser. A look at the clock in the vestibule told him that it might be a bit early even for her; it was only five in the morning. Tom wondered why he had woken up so early. It must be the jitters in his stomach and the prospect of asking for Jane's hand today. That would make any man in love rise early with anticipation of what was to come. He chuckled to himself. \"Master, you are up early,\" said Millie who came from her room in the far end of the house, on her way to the kitchen. Mr and Mrs Jones did not sleep in the house, but had a small cottage on the estate. Mille was the one in charge of the kitchen in the morning until Mrs Jones arrived. \"Yes, it seems that I am, Millie,\" replied Tom with a wide smile. \"Anything in particular, that is happening today, sir?\" asked Millie with a knowing smile. That girl was too nosy for her own good, but she had been with the family since she was little and Tom had not the heart to let her go. She did a very good job, but had some troubles in knowing her place. \"Millie, do you not have something else to do?\" asked Tom with a fatherly smile. \"Of course, sir, right away, sir,\" said Millie with colouring cheeks and hurried off into the kitchen. Soon Tom could hear her moving pots around on the stove, preparing for breakfast. The others would not rise for another hour or so and Tom decided to take a stroll in the garden to calm himself down. It always had a soothing effect on him. -xxx- Jane Lefroy was also an early riser this particular morning in July. The sun that stole its way in between her curtains hurried her out of bed and into her frock. Unlike her siblings she took after her father in most aspects but unlike him enjoyed a quiet stroll outside in solitude before the rest of the family rose. So much had happened in the past month that she had started to write it down in a journal. A stroll in the garden helped her clear her mind and focus on what she wanted to write down. Lately she had mostly been writing about Miss Austen and the effect her acquaintance with the family had had. Of course her mother's death had been a subject she had been writing a lot about. She missed her terribly. But the future did not seem as dark as it had for a month or so ago. Miss Austen was in their life and had brought with her a new family to love. Jane did not miss her grandparents that much. There had still been no explanation or apology from them. Not even a letter to their grandchildren. Jane admitted that she was astounded by their behaviour. She would not have thought it of them. But there it was, and she was not the one who was going to seek out them again. Just as good, thought Jane to herself. She had a new grandmother now. Deep in thoughts she went outside. She let the crisp air fill her lounges. The newcomers were as easy to love as Miss Austen. Even though Miss Cassandra Austen was not as lively as her younger sister, Jane found that she was a very good listener, and had a good hand with the younger children. It was a shame she did not have any of her own. The visitors brought a welcome change from the dull days that had followed the funeral. The days seemed much brighter these days, as did the future. The voice of her father woke her up from reflexion and she looked up, startled. She had thought she was the only one awake. \"Papa!\" cried she. \"You startled me. I thought I was alone.\" She was still surprised to see him so early in the morning. Miss Austen's time in the house had brought some changes to her father's routines. \"As did I,\" said her father with a mild smile. \"But that does not mean that the company is unwelcome.\" \"Not at all,\" smiled Jane. She did not mind his company. In fact, she thought it too long since they had had some time alone. \"How do you like our guests?\" asked her father. \"Very much,\" replied Jane. \"It is good to have something else to think about.\" \"Yes, company tends to have that effect, especially new acquaintances.\" \"Indeed.\" Jane realised she was short in her answer, but had really nothing else to say to that. \"Are you alright, Jane?\" asked her father. \"With the funeral, the upcoming wedding and all, I mean?\" Jane watched her father. He looked very anxious. \"Yes, I am fine. I mean, I miss mamma, but I have more people to love now,\" replied she and meant it. Her mother would always stay in her heart, and she could now care for the newcomers in her life. \"Good, good. I am glad, because, I am asking Mrs Austen for Miss Austen's hand today,\" said her father, clearly relieved. \"I am sure she could have nothing to object.\" \"Let us pray for that,\" replied her father with a shaky smile. Jane had grown used to see this other side of his father. She liked it, he seemed younger. She was happy that Miss Austen had come into their life. -xxx- Jane Austen smiled contentedly as she lazily opened her eyes. Everything had gone so well the night before and her mother seemed pleased with what she had seen. She had even almost pushed Jane into taking an evening stroll with Tom. Her mother was truly changed in how she behaved towards Tom and it made Jane very happy. She sat up and remembered her promise to write her brother and Eliza, inviting them to visit. She was sure she had shocked them all with her uncharacteristic behaviour, but Eliza's letter never implied anything or asked for an explanation. She had no idea of what her mother and sister had said to their friends and relatives, but she was sure only the closest family knew the whole truth. She really did not mind. Soon everybody would know anyway. She let out a laugh and jumped out of bed and sat down at the table after opening the curtains to let the daylight in. Behind the curtains the sun shone bright and was in tune with Jane's mood this morning. Life could not be better. She started to write her letter to Henry and Eliza. A quarter of an hour later she was finished and dressed. She hastily sealed the letter and went in search of Jones. In the foyer she almost got knocked over by Millie who was hurrying from the kitchen in direction of the breakfast room with a tray in her hand. \"Oh, I am terrible sorry, Miss!\" cried the maid. \"It is quite alright,\" said Jane and brushed off the drops of water that had landed on her gown. \"Everyone seems to be up early this morning,\" said Millie with an amused smile as she straightened the things on the tray. \"Really?\" Jane cocked an eyebrow. \"Oh yes, Master and Miss Jane has already been outside and are now waiting for breakfast.\" \"Have you seen Jones at all?\" asked Jane as she felt her stomach grumble in response to the word 'breakfast'. \"I believe he is out in the stables, Miss,\" replied Millie and continued when noticing the letter in Jane's hand, \"but if it is regarding the letter, just put it on the tray over there and I will tell him,\" she nodded and then with an apologetic curtsey she hurried off to the breakfast room. Jane put the letter on the tray Millie had pointed at. Vacantly she thought of all the times she ha dreamed of and put herself by Tom's side as his wife, the mistress of his house, the mother of his children. Now she was there, well on her way of becoming all that. The only thing that was missing was children of her own. She realised of course that the chance of her bearing children at her age was slim to none, but she could not help but dream and hope. She wanted to give Tom a child. Their child, a product of their love. She shook the image of her holding her firstborn in her arms and Tom sitting next to her, looking lovingly down at the little bundle, off. Tom already had six children. For the first time she felt life had slipped away from her. The life that two months ago had seemed perfectly satisfactory, now felt complicated and filled with new desires and dreams. -xxx- Tom looked towards the door as he heard Jane's footsteps come down the hallway. Millie had informed him that Miss Austen also was up and about. He smiled as she stepped through the door. She looked remarkable well this morning. Her face had a certain glow to it that he had not seen since they were young. The hazel eyes that met his shone with warmth and love. She sat down next to him and smiled. \"I see you are a morning person nowadays, Mr Lefroy,\" said she. \"Yes, so it seems,\" replied Tom with a crooked smile. \"And, apparently, so is my daughter.\" Tom threw a glance at his daughter on the other side of the table. \"It must be something in the air,\" said Jane Lefroy philosophically. \"Indeed,\" said Jane Austen. \"I must say the Limerick air has done me remarkable well. Much better than Bath.\" Tom raised an eyebrow. \"Really?\" \"Oh, yes,\" smiled Jane. \"Cannot be compared at all. And the company is so much better here.\" Tom's heart skipped a beat and he smiled at her. \"Well, I cannot argue with that,\" said he and put in a spoonful of porridge. Soon the other children came to join them and there was no more time for talk. He could not wait for Mrs Austen to appear so that he could show her his library and there ask for Jane's hand. He had never thought he would ask Mrs Austen that question. But there he was, preparing to ask her. Mrs Austen and Miss Austen were late down to breakfast. \"I trust you have slept well?\" asked Tom as he served them tea. \"Yes, thank you, very well,\" replied both of them. \"I thought you would be interested in seeing the library after breakfast, Mrs Austen,\" said Tom. Mrs Austen's eyes widened as she understood the full meaning of that sentence. \"I would love to,\" said she. \"I know Jane, I mean, Miss Austen, wants to show Miss Cassandra Austen the garden,\" Tom added. \"Yes,\" said Jane Austen. \"I have been looking forward to a walk,\" said Cassandra Austen with an amused smile. Tom realised he must have sounded very anxious for Mrs Austen to approve and understand why he wanted to show her the library. \"Good, good.\" -xxx- Jane Austen tried hard to hide her smile as Tom asked her mother to join him in the library. The meaning of the question was only too clear. She was happy that Tom was going to ask her mother properly. Even though her mother really had no say in the matter, and her mother was aware of that, it was the right thing to do. She could not remember the last time she felt so utterly happy and contented with her life. She had always accepted her faith as an unmarried authoress. That was all she had ever wanted anyway. To write and to be able to live by her pen. She had new dreams now. Not even the children could mistake the meaning in Tom's anxious question to Mrs Austen. At least not the older ones. Jane could see them exchange looks before asking to be excused. She knew they had already given Tom their consent. Now it was Jane's family's turn. Jane took Cassandra outside to the sunshine and the sanctuary of the garden. The children were scattered around the premises and enjoying themselves. \"You do approve, Cassie?\" Jane asked with an anxious voice. \"Of course I do,\" replied Cassandra and took hold of her hands. \"Anyone who sees you together cannot help but see the love between you. And the life he can offer you…\" Cassandra trailed off as she gazed out over the grounds surrounding the estate. \"It is more than anyone could hope for,\" concluded Jane. \"Yes,\" replied Cassandra and smiled at her sister. \"I have not seen you looking so well in a very long time, sister.\" \"It must be something in the air,\" said Jane with a mysterious smile. -xxx- Tom repeated silently in his head what he was going to say as he and Mrs Austen made their way to the library. The closer they got the more nervous he became. \"Here we are then,\" said he and opened the door to the library. He caught a glimpse of Mrs Austen's astounded face. He had seen the same expression on many a visitor. Despite being a very masculine room it had also a very warm and welcoming air to it. If the garden had been Mary's pride and joy, this was Tom's. He had put in a lot of time and effort in finding suitable novels and rare editions. \"Mr Austen would have liked this library,\" said Mrs Austen with an admiring look. \"We never could afford a splendid library. George loved books.\" Mrs Austen sent him a sad smile. \"I believe Miss Austen has inherited that love.\" \"Oh yes, Jane always had her nose in a book when she was young.\" The smile on her face brightened and got happier. \"I guess you must have guessed why I have asked you to come here,\" started Tom and turned to Mrs Austen. The smile she gave him told him he had nothing to fear. \"You must see the life I can offer your daughter.\" \"Yes, Mr Lefroy. I can see that Jane will be well looked after here,\" said Mrs Austen. \"Perhaps a bigger house would be in order.\" Tom smiled at the suggestive tone in her voice. \"I have started inquiring after another estate,\" said he. \"Do we have your blessing?\" His blue eyes met her grey. \"Not that it really matters, you two have already made up your mind,\" smiled Mrs Austen. \"But it is nice to be asked all the same. Yes you have my blessing.\" -TBC- Ok, so now I need inspiration. How do I continue? What do you want to read about? Shall I fast forward or do you want to see Henry and Eliza?[Chapter 33] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again. They begin questioning their actions and choices in the past (i.e. from the time they met in 1795 and forward).This is what could have happened if the movie had not ended.

I hope I have satisfied most of your opinions. Part 33 : In which they start to plan for the future July 1814 \"Is it safe for me to come in?\" Jane asked as she peeked in around the library door after seeing her mother leave the room. Her heart was beating so fast she thought it would explode in her chest and she could scarcely breathe. This was the moment they had been waiting for. \"Yes, Jane,\" smiled Tom. He came towards her and took her in his arms and just held her close. In that moment Jane knew everything was going to be fine. Her mother had given her blessing and nobody could really have anything to say about their upcoming marriage now. Jane let out a sigh of relief and joy. \"I guess my mother did not object?\" she asked teasingly as she stepped out of his embrace and gazed into his eyes. \"Who could say no to this face?\" said Tom with a self confident smile. \"Any sane mother would jump to a prospect of leaving her daughter in the hands of the likes of me.\" \"A bit smug, are we?\" said Jane with cocked eyebrow and mocking tone. His eyes glittered with amusement and she felt her heart melt over and over again. It was almost too good to be true. She almost feared she would wake up from this wonderful dream and realise that was just what it was, a dream. \"Well, can you say no to this face?\" asked he with sincere blue eyes. Jane pretended to think long and hard on her answer. Long enough to make Tom shrug a bit with uneasiness. \"Of course not, Mr Lefroy, you always was a charmer.\" Tom looked considerable relieved by her statement and took her hand and kissed it. \"I am glad, Miss Austen, that you will have me for the rest of our life.\" Jane could not believe he still could make her heart flutter after all these years. \"There is nowhere else I would rather be, than by your side,\" said she and drew him closer to her. \"I love you.\" \"And I love you.\" The two statements were sealed with a kiss. -xxx- December 1814 \"I have found the perfect place for us!\" beamed Tom as he rushed into the library where Jane was sitting writing. She was deeply concentrated and barely heard him. She was soon finished with the novel she had started that summer. \"What is that, dear?\" asked she and looked up from the sheet of paper she had been writing on. Henry and Eliza had brought with them her beloved writing case her father had given her when she turned seven when they visited in late July. The visit had been truly fruitful and Henry had of course not had anything to object in his old friend marrying his sister after making sure Tom's intentions were pure and the affection between them was mutual. Since Henry and Eliza had brought their two children it stood clear that a larger house was indeed wanted. \"I have found the perfect place for us,\" repeated Tom as he sat down next to her. His eyes sparkled with excitement. Jane was once again hit with how handsome he was. She longed to pull her hands through his unruly hair that never seemed to be able to stay in place. She longed to be his lawfully wedded wife and to be able to share his bed. Summer could not come soon enough. \"That is wonderful news!\" cried Jane and put down her pen. Tom rolled out the drawing he had been holding under his arm to show her their new abode. Jane eagerly inspected it. \"It is called Carrigglas Manor and is, as you can see, in need of restoration. It has been empty since a fire that unfortunately broke out some years ago. The previous owner did not have the means to rebuild it all and so I got the estate for a very reasonable amount of money. I am sure Daniel Robertson, the architect, can manage to have it ready by the time we are married.\" Their own house , mused Jane silently. Something they would create together. Tom could not have chosen a better prospect. She knew that would be a place she could be happy at. She hoped the children would think the same and not be too sad to leave their current housing. Jane could not wait to see it in real life. \"What a wedding gift,\" said she. She admired the drawing of the house, a bit on the gothic side, and very, very handsome. \"It is perfect.\" -xxx- Tom was glad Jane liked the prospect he had shown her. Secretly he had already begun the restoration. He had decided on the spot when he was there to inspect it. He knew Jane would approve. It would suit them perfectly. In some way it had reminded him of Lady Gresham's estate and times passed. The cherry orchard by the pond would be worth mimicking. It would be their place to reminisce on the past and plan the future, remembering the kiss by the pond. Tom had so many ideas that he really had to start writing them down before forgetting. It was the first time he was involved in a restoration this considerable. Mary's parents had given them the house they currently inhabited, and the only thing Tom had had any say in was the library. He had of course liked the house, but it had never felt as his own. After what had happened after Mary's death he was only too happy to leave and start afresh with Jane. Something they could call their won. Summer could not come soon enough. Still there had been co contact with Mary's parents. Tom was quite certain they would have thought he and his children would come begging for forgiveness. But the Lefroys sternly put all the blame on the Pauls. They were the ones in the wrong. After a while even the younger children had stopped asking for them. Tom would never prevent them from seeing their grandparents, but no invitation for the children to visit came. But first the pressing matter for the time being, Jane's birthday the 16th of December. She had of course asked not to be celebrated at all, but Tom and his children had another opinion. They wanted to celebrate Jane and the fact that she was in their life. The children especially wanted to show their appreciation. Jane had really been there for all of them through it all. She had become the rock they could rely on. They would have been lost without her. So of course Jane knew nothing of the preparations that were being made. He had also taken the liberty of inviting Jane's mother and sister along with Eliza. Jane had said something about beginning the wedding planning. Even though they had decided on a small family wedding there were apparently things to discuss already. Tom did not really take part in that department, but he knew dresses had to be fitted and sewn, invitation lists must be written and flower, you must not forget the flowers. Tom grew tired with just thinking of it all. Jane would have everything she asked for. Tom would not deny her anything. Only the best was good enough. Jane Austen would never have to deny herself anything ever again. Tom was going to make sure of that. Nothing would be wanting. \"So, when do I get to see this fantastic house of yours, Tom?\" Jane suddenly asked. Tom realised he had been sitting silent, lost in thought for a while. \"When ever you like, my dear,\" replied Tom. \"I shall need your opinions on the landscaping and the furniture.\" Tom smiled at her. He still found it hard to believe sometimes, that she was back in his life. It was like a beautiful dream he was afraid of waking up from. But this was a dream that would last for the rest of their life. -xxx- Jane Lefroy was looking forward to Miss Austen's birthday. She wanted to give her everything Miss Austen had given her on her birthday. Her father had put her in charge of the cake and decorations. It was very hard to make arrangement in secret, but Miss Austen had not really wanted a celebration, so it had to be done. They worked under the pretence of it being a small family gathering. They all knew they could not keep everything from Miss Austen, and Miss Austen knew she would not be able to have no celebration at all. Of course it would not be a big thing, but bigger than the family. Her father had invited Miss Austen's mother and sister and also her cousin Eliza. His own parents would be there along with a few of his siblings and Jane's cousins that lived close enough. Miss Austen had yet to meet some of them. Jane liked to have the head responsibility of the birthday celebration. It was not like she had stepped up to take her mother's place, but her father did rely on her more now than he had before. She knew he counted on her to be there to help Miss Austen to find her new place in their family. So far most things had run smoothly, but Jane could see that Miss Austen was uncomfortable in the new position as mistress of a household. Millie and Mrs Jones did the best they could in making Miss Austen familiar with all the different parts of the house, of what their chores were and how she should handle the writing of the things to get from the shops, which butcher who was the better and so on. Even her brothers and sister had helped her as much as they could. Miss Austen could not say that she had been anything than welcome into the Lefroy's household. They had taken her in with open arms. The neighbours and the town had also gotten used to the idea that Miss Austen was there to stay. After the funeral there had of course been the usual gossip and titter-tatter, but it had soon died out. Jane knew her mother would be pleased. Everything had turned out exactly as she had planned it. Well, apart from the Pauls part. Jane's grandparents still did not speak to them. Jane did not care anymore, nor did her brothers and sister. -xxx- Jane Austen could sense that there was more to this little family gathering for her birthday than Tom and his family would let on. Often she would enter a room and everyone in it would go dead silent and try to look like they did not talk about her celebration. After a long and hard persuasion she had allowed Tom and his daughter to plan for a small celebration, a modest celebration that would suit a lady turning nine-and-thirty. Jane now begun to realise that would not be the case. The family was going to some lengths to make it a memorable occasion. She thought they could have waited a year; nine-and-thirty was no birthday to celebrate really. But as it seemed, she was outvoted. Jane really did not mind, but she was not used to the attention they were giving her. She still did not believe she was anything special. Sure, she had published two novels that had been taken in by the readers, but still, she had a long way to go before considering herself special. Tom did that so well for her. He also liked to point out the fact that she was 23 days older than him. She would have to get him back for that. -TBC- Not really fast forwarding, but jumping ahead a bit. I hope you liked it![Chapter 34] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again. They begin questioning their actions and choices in the past (i.e. from the time they met in 1795 and forward).This is what could have happened if the movie had not ended. Disclaimer: I do not own Jane Austen, Tom Lefroy or any other character in this story. Facts are taken from the Becoming Jane Fansite. Author's note: I'm the worst writer ever. At least when it comes to keeping my fans happy. But I give you an adventurous chapter, and hope you will forgive me the long wait. Part 34 : In which they go on a trip and get caught in the snow \"How about a trip to Carrigglas tomorrow, Jane?\" asked Tom a few days before her birthday. \"We could stay at the inn for a few days.\" To be honest Tom wanted Jane to himself for a few days before her family arrived. Who knew when they would be able to go away alone before the wedding. Jane's mother, sister and cousin were due to arrive the next day and Tom thought they would be well on their way when they came. There were also matters to be discussed with the contractor. \"Yes, that would be lovely,\" said Jane. Tom almost jumped with relief. With Jane out of the house the rest of the family could go on with the preparations for Jane's birthday without worrying about her walking in on them and spoil the whole thing. Tom would bring Jane back on her birthday. He did not mind sharing her with the rest of the family, but sometimes he wished it was only the two of them. This was probably his only chance of having her completely to himself before the wedding. He longed for the day when Jane's face was the last thing he saw at night and the first thing he laid his eyes on in the morning. Sleeping in the same bed was something yet to experience. The summer seemed so far away. -xxx- Jane Austen still got the feeling of being caught in a dream. Everything was too good to be true. Sometimes she was just waiting for someone to come and say it was not for her, that there had been some mistake and it was time for her to go home. Tom's scheme to go away for a couple of days was most welcome. She dearly hoped they would stay away over her birthday, but she suspected she would have no such luck. Tom would surely have her back in time for her celebration. There was no fooling Jane. She knew the preparations were going on. She had decided to let it be, even though she thought it too much. But since she was not supposed to know about it there was no way for her to stop them. She trusted Tom's judgement not to let things get out of hand. Jane was eager to see the place Tom had found for them. From what she had understood the mansion would not be liveable for another couple of months, but there were many things to be settled with the constructer. Matters that were best discussed on site. She longed to be a part of it all. Tom had said he needed her input. Although she was not sure what she could bring to the table. She knew nothing of restoration and had done very little decoration. But Tom seemed to have confidence in her good taste to let her decorate after her own head. Apart from the library, of course, that was Tom's domain and she would not dream of intruding unless he asked for advice. She hoped it would be as grand as the one he had now. She thought it perfect. She had not been away from the house more than over a day since she arrived last spring, but the guests had been many and Jane had found that she liked to entertain and be the mistress of a household suited her very well. Jane was a bit hesitant about leaving the children alone, but Tom assured her they would be well taken care of by Millie and Mrs Jones. Of course she trusted them completely, but still it felt odd and Jane was still a bit worried. The children had been left in her care by their mother and it felt like she was leaving her own offspring. \"It is only for a couple of days, Miss Austen,\" said Jane Lefroy. \"We will be quite fine with Millie and Mrs Jones.\" \"I am sure, but...\" Jane looked worried as she packed her bag. \"Do not worry. Anthony and I will look after the younger ones,\" Jane Lefroy assured her. Jane, however, did not feel convinced. -xxx- \"Are you ready, my love?\" asked Tom the next day as Jane Austen descended the stairs with a bag in her hand. They were getting late and Tom began to worry about running into Jane's family on their way to Carrigglas. \"Yes, I believe I am,\" smiled Jane. He knew she was worried about leaving the children. Had she only known her mother and sister would be there to look after them she would not have to worry, but their visit was part of the surprise and Tom was not the one to tell. The December morning was clear and sunny. Hopefully the weather would say dry until they reached Carrigglas. Tom was a bit worried about getting caught on the road during a heavy snowfall, but as it looked now they did not have to worry. Tom made sure Jane was comfortable in the carriage before sitting down in the carriage next to her and telling the driver to begin their journey. A quick glance at his pocket watch told him they would not risk meeting Jane's family on the road. He relaxed and made himself comfortable under the sheepskin rug next to Jane. He felt very excited about this trip. Not only was he going to show her their future home, but he also got to spend time with her completely alone. Did he dare suggest only one bedroom at the inn? Or was that too bold? He smiled vacantly, thinking of falling asleep next to her. \"What are you smiling about?\" asked Jane and he met her puzzled eyes. \"I was just thinking of how lucky I am. To be here with you,\" he smiled. \"Last time we set off on a journey together we were eloping.\" \"Yes...?\" Jane cocked an eyebrow as if she wondered what he was getting at. \"This time we are actually engaged with our parent's blessing, and on our way to inspect our future home. It is just funny how life turns out.\" Tom could hear himself ramble. He did feel as excited and filled with love and joy as he had all those years ago when they had set off at dawn to be married. But this time Jane would not leave him at the first stop. Nothing would make her leave him again. Jane smiled as if she understood how he felt. \"Yes, this was not the way I had thought my life would turn out.\" \"No, who would have thought?\" Tom took her hands and brought them up to his lips. Jane smiled and met his eyes. -xxx- Yes, who would have thought that this ironic, penniless authoress would actually marry? Jane thought to herself as she looked into Tom's adoring eyes. \"Judge Langlois must be turning in his grave,\" she said with a chuckle. Tom's lips brushed her hands gently. Despite the brisk morning outside Jane did not feel cold at all. Quite the contrary. The closeness to Tom was making her blood boil. She had to look away not to show what effect he had on her. Her body was filled with desire she could not yet act on. Soon the rocking of the carriage sent Jane to sleep and she did not wake again until Tom woke her up at lunch. They stopped at an inn and had a small lunch before setting off again. \"How much further,\" asked Jane when daylight began to fade outside the windows. \"Not more than a few miles now,\" said Tom and smiled excitedly. Jane felt a rush of anticipation surge through her body as the carriage left the road and turned into a pebbled drive. The drive was flanked with large oak trees which made the place seem excluded from the world. Jane peered out the window in hope of catching a glimpse of the mansion. \"Nearly there,\" whispered Tom in her ear. His breath on her face made her body tingle. The carriage came round a bend and there it was, Carrigglas Manor, perhaps not in all its glory, but still magnificent. Jane drew a deep breath. \"It is perfect,\" she breathed. Of course she could see that there was a lot of work to be done, but it was out of the ordinary. It was very happily situated on a small hill, overlooking a vast area of well kept lawns and gardens. She felt as if she had come home. There was no other place she would rather spend the rest of her life. The carriage came to a stop in front of the main entrance and they stepped out into the cold afternoon. Jane did not feel the blistering wind against her cheeks, she was too excited. She tried to take it all in, but it was too much. She felt like a child at Christmas. \"Do you like it?\" asked Tom and took her under the arm, leading her towards the entrance. \"I love it,\" replied Jane. -xxx- Tom enjoyed the look on Jane's face. Her dark eyes were widened in wonderment and curiosity. She almost looked like a small child discovering a secret world. Her face glowed with excitement and she eagerly turned around to take it all in. He led her into the foyer where the lights had been lit by the caretaker, who had also made sure that some of the fires were lit to make it a little bit warmer. Outside he could hear the wind growing in strength. Tom vacantly wondered if there was a room warm enough to spend the night in if they had to. This part of the house was almost inhabitable, but there were no bedrooms finished and very few furniture in the drawing rooms. An image including a sheepskin and a fireplace came before his eyes. If the weather got worse they did not have much choice but to stay overnight. Tom did not dislike that prospect. What could be more romantic than a light supper in front of a roaring fire with a snowstorm blowing outside? Tom would not mind at all. He was glad that Mrs Jones had made him take that basket of food. A quick glance outside told him it might come in handy. Jane seemed oblivious to the storm outside. She was too busy exploring her surroundings. \"This area of the house was not harmed in the fire,\" said Tom and led the way into one of the drawing rooms. It was empty apart from a large chair and a small table in front of the fireplace. The fire was crackling merrily and its warmth beamed towards them. Tom could feel a slight draft as the wind gained even more strength outside. \"What a lovely room,\" said Jane, who still did not seem to notice the storm outside. On the other side of the windows there were now large snowflakes falling down. Tom walked over and peered out. \"I am afraid we might have to spend the night,\" said he and turned to Jane, who was standing by the fire. She looked surprised. \"The weather is rapidly becoming worse,\" explained Tom with a gesture towards the window. \"Oh,\" said Jane as she looked out. -xxx- She had not noticed the change in weather before Tom pointed it out to her. As Jane looked out the window and heard the roaring wind she realised they were caught in a snowstorm. She had been too occupied with exploring the house to notice the snowflakes that were heavily falling down outside the windows. Tom did not seem worried, however, so Jane decided it would be fine. As long as there were wood to keep the fire going they were going to be just fine. Jane could not wait to see more of the manor. The weather did not bother her. She did not mind the idea of being alone with Tom with a blistering storm outside. The thought was actually quite exhilarating and she could feel a slight spur of excitement surge through her body. \"I will go see to the horses and the carriage,\" said Tom, \"and bring in our bags.\" Jane nodded, \"I will take a look around in the meantime.\" Tom left her to her own exploring. Jane took a candle and left the room. The house was very quiet apart form the wind blowing outside. Jane went from one room to the other, feeling more and more convinced that this place was designed for them. She thanked her lucky start that the previous owner had not been able to restore it. This place truly felt like home. In her head Jane started placing furniture in the rooms she entered, she picked out fabrics for curtains and decided on what colours the walls should be. The house needed a good clean through before she could do anything, but there was no use before the whole restoration was finished. Everything would be covered in dust again if she started too soon. She could easily imagine throwing parties in the large ballroom. It would be lit with a thousand candles, the walls painted in a soft yellow, almost golden colour to reflect the lights coming from the many windows. It would be just grand. The larger drawing rooms were perfect for smaller dinner parties, serving refreshments or for putting up card tables in. Footsteps coming towards her brought her back from her daydreaming. She turned with a smile, expecting to find Tom, but instead stood face to face with an unknown red haired young man. \"Miss Austen, I presume?\" said he with a friendly smile. \"Yes, that would be me, Mr...?\" \"Oh, Mr Phelps,\" said he with an embarrassed look and a bow. Jane curtseyed and hid a smile. \"I am the caretaker here at Carrigglas Manor.\" \"Oh, I see,\" said Jane and smiled. Mr Phelps did not look more than thirty, had a bright smile and green eyes. \"You find me alone at the moment. Mr Lefroy went to see to our horses and luggage.\" \"Yes, I met Mr Lefroy as I came over to see if there was anything you needed, seeing as the weather took a nasty turn for the worse.\" \"That is very kind of you, Mr Phelps,\" said Jane. \"My wife is in the kitchen as we speak, making you a nice cup of hot cocoa and some sandwiches.\" \"That is really not necessary,\" objected Jane. \"Oh, it is no trouble at all, Miss Austen,\" said Mr Phelps with a smile. \"We are happy to help.\" Jane looked out the window and saw nothing but snow. The wind was increasing by the minute and realised she Tom had been gone for quite some time now. Even if the estate was of considerable size, it was not that large. \"I wonder where Tom is,\" whispered Jane with dark eyes filled with worry. -TBC- I hope you liked it.

Part 35 : In which Tom get lost in the snow The weather was far worse than Tom had anticipated. After running into Mr Phelps in the courtyard he hurried over in direction of the stables. The snow made it difficult to get a sense of direction and the wind was hitting him with full power. After a few tries he finally found the stables. The driver had already taken care of the horses and the carriage. Tom and Jane's luggage was sitting on the floor waiting to be picked up. \"We are going to have to stay the night,\" Tom said to the driver. \"I figured, Mr Lefroy,\" answered he with a crooked smile. \"I will stay here with the horses.\" \"Good man,\" said Tom. He knew there was a room in the far end of the stables where the stable boy would sleep. He picked up the luggage and peered outside. It was darkening fast and all he could see was snow. His tracks where already gone and he could only see a few feet in front of him. He had to get back somehow. Jane would be worried if he was gone too long. He did not want her going out in this weather looking for him. Tom cursed himself for not thinking of a way to find his way back in the snow. A rope tied to the main door would have been sufficient. But that thought had not crossed his mind when he went out. He really hoped Jane was too busy exploring to realise he had been gone far too long. Tom had to make a decision. He knew the wisest thing was to stay in the stables rather than risk getting lost on the way to the house. But he did not want to risk Jane going out looking for him either. She would surely get lost as she did not know the area at all. Hopefully Mr Phelps had found her and would talk her out of going outside. Mr Phelps was a sensible man and would not let a woman wander around outside in this kind of weather. He would rather risk his own life. Tom felt sure he could trust Mr Phelps not letting Jane out of the house no matter how persistent she was. -xxx- \"I will not let you go out in this weather, Miss Austen,\" said Mr Phelps with a determined voice. \"But Tom could be lost,\" Jane pleaded. \"It does not matter. I better go who knows the area,\" said Mr Phelps. Jane had to admit he was right. She would be lost in matter of seconds out there in the snow. She did not want to experience the feeling of complete helplessness again as she had in the thunderstorm that summer. \"Fine,\" Jane finally agreed. \"But we must do something soon, Mr Phelps!\" She was worried about Tom. The storm was getting even worse as they spoke. There was no time to lose. Jane could picture Tom lying lifeless in the snow freezing to death while she and Mr Phelps were arguing. She had been half way out the door when he stopped her. \"I will go,\" said Mr Phelps and put on his coat and took a lantern for light. \"Be careful, Mr Phelps,\" said Jane. \"Mrs Phelps will never forgive me if you are harmed.\" \"I will be fine. I know this place like the palm of my hand, Miss Austen.\" \"You may, but Mr Lefroy does not and therefore could be anywhere,\" said Jane. \"If he is out there I will find him, Miss Austen, I promise,\" Mr Phelps smiled reassuringly, but Jane did not feel convinced. Tom could be anywhere. She prayed he was alright. With a last reassuring smile Mr Phelps disappeared out the door into the darkening day and the snow outside. Jane watched as he disappeared quickly in the snow. To keep her mind busy she went off in search of the kitchen where Mr Phelps had said she would find his wife. A cup of hot cocoa did not sound so bad after all, but she was too worried to feel any hunger. Jane found that Mrs Phelps was a calm and reasonable sort of a woman who did not feel the need to worry without just cause. \"My husband grew up on these grounds, Miss Austen. If there is anyone who can find Mr Lefroy it will be him,\" Mrs Phelps said as Jane told her about Mr Phelps bravery. The words calmed Jane down a bit, enough to let her enjoy the steaming cup of cocoa that was resolutely put in front of her along with a plate of sandwiches. After nibbling at a cucumber sandwich Jane realised how hungry she was and soon the plate was empty. She tried to fall in with Mrs Phelps mindless chitchat, but the gnawing feeling of worry soon came back. Jane could not understand how Mrs Phelps could be so calm when she knew her husband out in this sort of weather. -xxx- Tom was lost. He was sure he had retraced his steps as closely as eh could in the snow but the house was still out of reach. He saw nothing but snow. For a moment he had seen a flicker of warm light, but just as he had localised where it came from it was gone and it was as dark as before. He knew he had to find his way soon if the weather did not clear up. The roaring wind told him that that was not likely to happen any time soon. He kept on moving as not to feel the biting cold that was finding its way under his coat. He was glad he had remembered his gloves and scarf, it helped a little. \"Mr Lefroy?\" Tom stopped dead in his steps and listened. He was sure he had heard his name being called, but now there was nothing but the unfriendly wind to be heard. \"Hello? Is anyone out here?\" he called, but in vain. There was no response. Tom kept on walking. He had started walking after a pattern, twenty steps forward, the two to the right, twenty back again and then two to the left. It felt safer than just walking randomly towards what he thought the house would be. He grew more and more desperate in his attempts to find his way back. Jane would be beside herself with worry by now, he knew he would be. As long as she did not go out in this weather to search for him… \"Mr Lefroy?\" Once again he thought he heard someone call his name. \"Hello?\" he called as loud as he could in an attempt to get through the roaring wind. \"Mr Lefroy?\" The voice belonged to Mr Phelps. Tom could see a flicker of light coming his way. \"Mr Phelps! Thank God!\" cried Tom, feeling utterly relieved. His whole body started shaking as he relaxed his tense muscles. \"I am glad I finally found you, Mr Lefroy. Miss Austen would have me killed if I returned without you,\" Mr Phelps emerged from the snow with a lamp in his hand. Just in that moment, when he felt confident that everything would turn out fine, Tom slipped and fell helplessly to the ground and everything went black. -xxx- Jane stood by the window trying to see out through the masses of snow that was falling outside. Tom and Mr Phelps were still not back and she was contemplating ignoring Mr Phelps plea of staying indoors. Anything could have happened. Tom could have slipped and fallen down hitting his head rendering him unconscious. Several scenarios including Tom lying lifeless in the snow played before her eyes. She started pacing up and down the hall, unable to stand still. Something had to be done. Even Mrs Phelps had come to join her in her pacing, looking more and more worried. Just as Jane was about to put on her coat, Mr Phelps with Tom in his arms staggered through the door. Tom looked awfully pale and not quite conscious. \"Oh dear Lord!\" Jane rushed forward to help Mr Phelps with Tom's lifeless body. \"What happened?\" \"Just as I found him he slipped and fell,\" Mr Phelps said and struggled with Tom's limp body. \"Let us get him to the fireplace at once.\" \"Of course,\" said Jane. \"Emma, dear, would you be so kind to fetch some blankets and hot water bottles for Mr Lefroy?\" said Mr Phelps to his wife who quickly disappeared down the hall. Jane helped Mr Phelps into the drawing room with the big fireplace. They gently put Tom down and Mr Phelps inspected Tom's head in search of a wound, but it did not appear to be any. That was good news. Fetching a doctor in this weather would not be easy. \"Tom, dear?\" Jane kneeled beside him and held his face in her hands. There was no response. He was so cold. She took his hands and held them in hers, trying to warm them. \"I believe it is just the sheer exhaustion from being out in that weather that has rendered him unconscious, Miss Austen. I am no doctor, but I do not think we need to worry, at least not yet,\" said Mr Phelps. His wife came with the blankets and they covered him up completely. \"We really need to get Mr Lefroy warm again.\" Jane rubbed her hands over Tom's body in an attempt to get him warm. Jane realised how Tom must have felt when finding her unconscious that day in the rain. It was a scary feeling. She felt completely helpless since there was nothing she could do. She whispered to him as she inspected his head once more in search for a wound that would make his state more understandable. There was nothing that could explain his unconsciousness and it worried Jane. \"Tom, please wake up,\" she pleaded and kissed his face. \"It is not fair...\" -TBC- Yes, another cliffy... Sorry...

Author's note: Very short, I know… But I'm getting married in the morning and I wanted get this out! Part 36 : In which Tom is still not out of the woods Tom was lost in the shadows. From far away he could hear someone calling his name, but he could not reach out to the person calling for him. He was cold, so cold. He could not remember ever being so cold. He could hear voices murmuring around him but could not make himself heard. Where was he? Where was Jane? What happened? He remembered the snow. He must have fallen. Was he hurt? He did not feel any pain. Was he dead? I cannot be dead! Tom tried to open his eyes but his lids did not move an inch. He tried to move but his body was not responding. He began to feel afraid. Something just was not right. -xxx- \"Wake up, Tom, please wake up,\" pleaded Jane with tears falling down on his face. \"I cannot go on without you.\" She buried her face in his neck. He was still very cold and nothing they did seemed to change that. His breathing was normal as was his pulse. There was nothing to explain why Tom was unconscious. She knew she could not live on if he was not in her life. Jane had never felt so helpless in her life. \"Is there nothing we can do?\" Jane looked up at Mr Phelps. \"I do not what else to do, Miss Austen,\" said Mr Phelps worriedly. \"There is just nothing to explain why he is unconscious.\" Jane threw a look out the window, but the snow was still falling as hard as ever. She could not let anyone out the door before it had slowed down. Even if it was for the sake of Tom's life she could not risk another life in that weather. Jane looked down at Tom's pale face. She caressed it and begged him to open his eyes. \"Please, Tom, come back to me.\" -xxx- Back in Limerick the snow was not falling as hard as it did at Carrigglas. Jane Lefroy peered out the windows, feeling quite delighted to see the green lawn turn white. She could not wait to get out to play in the snow, but tonight it was too late. Mrs and Miss Austen were overseeing the work being down in the kitchen in preparation of what needed to be made for Miss Jane Austen's birthday. Winter was, after summer, Jane's favourite time of year. She loved the way the snow covered everything up and gave it soft shapes. She could stay outside all day just wandering about looking at different things, making angels in the snow or throwing snowballs at her brothers. She wondered how her father and Miss Austen were doing and hoped that they were safe and sound inside. They had only been gone for a day but she was already missing them. At night she sat by the fire and made garlands with the younger children, Mrs Austen and Miss Austen. Jane enjoyed working with her hands in quiet reflexion. There were still things to be done in preparation for Miss Austen's birthday, but Jane was on top of it. She was certain it was going to be a splendid day. -xxx- Tom stirred slightly. The dark was fading and his eyelids begun to slowly open. He tried to focus on the face that looked down at him with large dark eyes filled with concern. \"Jane?\" he whispered hoarsely when he recognised the worried face with the large hazel eyes. \"Oh, Tom! Thank God!\" Jane's face lit up in a shaky but relieved smile and her eyes filled with tears. \"Where am I?\" He could not recognise the pattern in the ceiling. This was not his house. He tried to remember what had happened but his mind was blank. There was only Jane. \"I thought I had lost you,\" whispered Jane and covered his face with hot kisses. \"What happened?\" Tom was beginning to feel slightly worried. His body felt oddly numb and he could not make his limbs move. \"You went out into the snow to fetch our luggage and got lost. As Mr Phelps found you, you fell,\" replied Jane. \"You have been unconscious for some time.\" Tom could see that something was not right by the way Jane was looking at him. But what? Not knowing scared him. \"I cannot…\" he could not bring himself to finish the sentence. \"Mr Phelps will go fetch the doctor as soon as the snowing stops,\" said Jane calmly. At least he was not cold anymore. But Jane's worried eyes made him uncomfortable, how ever calm she may sound. Why could he not move? Panic filled his chest and he closed his eyes, trying to make it go away. -xxx- Jane felt utterly relieved as she saw Tom's eyes finally open. But he did not seem to remember what had happened and on top of that he could not move his body. She could see the fear in Tom's eyes and did her best to remain calm and composed though she was as scared as him. If only it would stop snowing so Mr Phelps could fetch the doctor. Tom had at least regained colour to his face and his body was not shivering from cold anymore. She dearly hoped the immobility in his limbs was temporary and that it would sort itself out before the doctor was fetched. But she was worried. Mr and Mrs Phelps had left her to herself for a while. They had tried to make her sleep, but Jane knew she could not rest until she knew Tom was out of danger. Still neither of them could understand why Tom lay unconscious and unable to move. There was no injury to explain it and that was most vexing. Tom's eyelids slipped down again and he was once more unconscious. Most unwillingly Jane left him and went in search of Mr and Mrs Phelps. They would want to hear that Tom at least had been awake. She found them in the kitchen. \"He was awake for a short time,\" said Jane as she stood in the doorway unsure whether to walk in or not. \"But he drifted off again.\" \"Come and sit down, Miss Austen,\" said Mrs Phelps. \"I will make you a nice strong cup of tea.\" Jane did as she was told. She felt totally numb and could not think straight. \"Did he say anything?\" asked Mr Phelps. \"Yes, he does not seem to remember what happened or where he is,\" replied Jane. Pr Phelps looked worried. \"He cannot move.\" Jane's eyes filled with tears. \"But he knew my name.\" \"If only it would stop snow!\" cried Mr Phelps and flew up from the chair and walked over to the window. He looked as worried as Jane felt. \"There we are,\" said Mrs Phelps as she put down a cup in front of Jane. Outside the snow was steadily falling and did not show any signs of stopping. One good thing was that the wind did not have the same power as before. Hopefully it was a sign of the weather improving. Jane prayed that it was. -xxx- The next time Tom opened his eyes he was alone. Jane was nowhere to be seen. He tried to listen for voices but all he could hear was the crackling of the dying fire. Where was Jane? Panic struck again. He did not like to be left alone in the condition. He tried to call out but not a sound came out of his mouth. The odd thing was that he did not feel pain anywhere. He was not hurt in anyway. It was very confusing. He stirred slightly, carefully trying to move his muscles. Slowly and quite painfully they were responding. First he moved his toes, then his fingers, legs and arms. Finally he managed to sit up. He took a look around and tried to remember where he was. The room was totally unknown to him. The only thing he could recall was Jane and her dark worried eyes. Where had she gone to? Tom tried to rise, but his head started spinning something awful that he slumped back down again. This will not do! -TBC- Hope you liked it.[Chapter 37] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary:nThe story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom havenmet again.

Janenhoped that the weather was not as bad in Limerick, though theynchildren would most probably see it as a very exiting adventure to bensnowed in; Jane did not want to worry aboutnthem too.

Hopefully some clever soul would think of coming tonCarrigglas to see if they were there.

Jane picked up her pace andnhurried to the drawing room where she found Tom sitting up. \"Tom!nYou are awake!\" cried she and hurried over to his side. \"Andnsitting up.\" \"Wherenwere you?\" asked Tom with an accusative tone in his voice. \"Inwent to talk to Mr and Mrs Phelps about our situation and yourncondition,\" replied Jane and kneeled down beside him. She gentlyntook his face in her hands, inspecting his eyes, then feeling hisnpulse and forehead. \"Everything seems normal,\" she murmured. \"Hownare you feeling?\" \"Fatiguednand I still cannot remember anything but you,\" replied Tom withnfurrowed brow. The accusing tone had been replaced by a more fearfulnone. \"You donnot remember anything at all, or just your fall?\" asked Janencautiously. \"It isnmost vexing, because I know it is there, just out of grasp,\"nreplied Tom. \"The oddest thing is that I do not feel hurt.\" \"Inknow. We have not been able to find any explanation either.\" Tom'snblue eyes filled with tears. Jane caressed his cheek. \"As soon asndaylight comes Mr Phelps will fetch a physician. But until then wencannot do anything but wait. We are snowed in.\" -xxx- Tomntried hard to remember something other than Jane. There were vaguenfaces without names. Children? His and Jane's children? But why didnhe have a wedding band when she did not? Whatnwas Jane to him? He knew that he loved her and that she loved him. Henfelt completely safe with her. She was the only thing that made sensenat the moment. Henthanked the Lord that she was there. Jane was his beacon in the hazenthat surrounded him. As long as she was there he knew he would benfine. Then something in his mind cravednattention. A memory? A wife? Was he married to someone that was notnJane? Tom's brow furrowed as he tried to bring the memory forth. Andeath? Just as he was sure he could remember, the image was gone. \"Tom?\"nJane sounded worried. He realised he probably had a funny look on hisnface as he concentrated on remembering. \"Inthought I remembered something,\" said he. \"Whatnwas it?\" asked Jane. \"Incannot remember. Just as I thought I had it, it was gone.\" \"Oh,nTom,\" cried Jane and took him in her arms. \"It will come back tonyou, I am sure of it.\" He could hear that she was worried. Tomnchose not to ask about their relationship just then. That would onlynmake it worse, he knew that much. Apartnfrom the memory loss he felt just fine. Perhaps a bit hungry. \"I amnactually feeling a bit hungry,\" said he. \"I willngo fetch you something right away,\" said Jane and rose. \"Ifnthat would not be too much to ask,\" said Tom. He needed some timenalone. \"Notnat all,\" Jane sounded offended. Tom did not mean to offend her, ofncourse she would do anything to make him feel better. But he did notnwant her to think he took her for granted. He cold not help it, fornsome reason the love he felt for her felt forbidden. Tom wished henknew why. Janenlooked tired as she walked out the door in direction of what must benthe kitchen. When she was gone Tom fellndown on the pillows that were propped up under his body, feelingnutterly exhausted. He was worried. He could see in Jane's eyes thatnshe was too. Soon he fell into restless sleep, disturbed by facesnthat he could not recognise and voices he could not remember. Nothingnmade sense. -xxx- Jane'snstomach was in a hard knot. She did not like this one bit. Tom lookednat her with different eyes. She knew it was not his fault, but itnscared her. If only she could help. She felt utterly exhausted. Shenneeded to sleep. Mrnand Mrs Phelps followed her back to the drawing room with tea andnsandwiches for Tom. The weather finallynseemed to be clearing up, but it was still dark. Tom was lying downnwith his eyes closed when she returned with Mr and Mrs Phelps. Janenfell down by his side and whispered his name. But there was nonresponse. Tom seemed restless and tossed and turned in his sleep,nmurmuring incoherent words. MrsnPhelps put down the kettle by the fire and the sandwiches on thenlittle table while her husband knelt beside Tom and Jane. \"Therenis still no change, Mr Phelps,\" said Jane. She had told them aboutnTom's continued lack of memory on their way back from the kitchen. \"Instill cannot understand what is causing the memory loss, MissnAusten,\" said Mr Phelps. \"It is most vexing!\" \"Yes,\"nsaid Jane and looked down at Tom's face. She caressed his forehead.n\"I just hope he will be fine eventually.\" \"It isnonly a few hours till dawn, I will take my horse as soon as there isnenough light, Miss Austen,\" said Mr Phelps. \"Do try to get somenrest.\" \"Inwill try, Mr Phelps,\" promised Jane although she knew it wasnimpossible for her to sleep before she knew Tom was out of danger. Mrnand Mrs Phelps left her to herself once again. She could see theirntired eyes and hope they at least could find the calmness to get anfew hours of sleep. Tomnstirred again and Jane returned her focus on him. Hisneyelids fluttered but he remained asleep. Jane poured herself a copnof tea and put some more logs on the fire before settling down nextnto Tom again. Her mind was trying to think of something that couldnexplain what Tom was going through, but she came up with nothing. Ifnonly time could move faster and day light would be upon them. Then MrnPhelps would go and fetch a physician who hopefully could find annanswer to the mystery. Jane'sneyelids grew heavier and soon she too fell into a restless sleep,nfilled with images of a Tom that did not remember his own children ornher. Dreams that once again forced her tonleave Tom. -xxx- \"Jane,nI'm yours, I'm yours heart and soul!\" he breathed out the wordsnas they hid themselves amongst the trees. Tom reached for the youngnlady by his side, feeling utterly and completely in love. The kissnshe had just placed on his lips told him that she felt thensame. His heart was near explosion with emotion. \"Much good thatnis.\" \"Letnme decide that,\" breathed she as she kissed his hand. He drew hernnear and then deeper into the shadows as some guests came closer. \"Whatnwill we do?\" \"Whatnwe must,\" whispered Jane as she kissed him once again. Tomnwoke up with a start. The memory had been vivid. He had been youngnagain. He could almost taste the kiss on his lips. He sat up andnlooked around. Jane was sleeping next to him, stirring slightly as hensat up. He felt triumphant. He had remembered something from hisnpast. A past with Jane. But what of the future? What had happenednafter that joyous night by the pond? What had his uncle said? Tomncould not remember. Thenfire was dying so he rose carefully as not to wake Jane and put onnsome more logs on the fire. He felt the kettle thatnwas placed beside the fireplace and found it lukewarm, it would havento do. He poured himself a cup and on the table he found thensandwiches and ate with great appetite. He felt famished. Jane lookednvery peaceful and he let her sleep. She had looked so tired before.nThe food lifted his spirits and he went to the window to looknoutside. He still was not sure what this house was. Thensun was slowly rising on the horizon, showing off a landscapencompletely white. A thick cover of snow was on the ground and thentrees. He fought a sudden urge to run out and throw himself in thensnow as he had when he was little. The first snow was always magical.nHe smiled. Another memory. This was better. He remembered the littlenhouse in Limerick, his mother and father and brothers and sisters.nHappy memories. Tom didnnot feel as worried as more memories came into his head. Most ofnwhich Jane was not a part of. He remembered he had children of hisnown, a wife. At least he thought he had a wife. But he could notnfigure out why he was here with Jane and not his wife. Tom was surenJane was not the one he had married. But he still could not remembernwhat had happened after that night by the pond and why he had marriednsomeone else. -TBC- Of course I cannot let Tom loose his memory! ;)[Chapter 38] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again.

Disclaimer: I do not own Jane Austen, Tom Lefroy or any other character in this story. Facts are taken from the Becoming Jane Fansite. Author's note: I'm so sorry for the late update. My mind has been elsewhere these last few weeks. Part 38 : In which Tom is back Jane Austen could not believe she had actually fallen asleep. As she woke up she found that Tom was standing by the window looking out. The sun was up and the sky clear. \"Tom?\" She sat up. \"How are you feeling?\" He turned slowly towards her. \"I am feeling as before, but a few bits of my past have come back to me,\" said he. She thought he looked a bit different from last night. Calmer perhaps. \"That is good news,\" said Jane and smiled encouragingly. \"I suppose so,\" said Tom, but looked rather unhappy. \"But all I remember are things from my childhood and youth. Nothing recent.\" Jane's brow furrowed. \"It will come back to you, I am sure,\" she said reassuringly. \"Has Mr Phelps been here to see you?\" \"No, nobody has been here,\" replied Tom. \"But I did see someone leave on horseback perhaps an hour ago.\" Jane felt relieved. \"That was probably Mr Phelps going to fetch the physician,\" said she. \"But I am not hurt,\" objected Tom. \"I know that. But something is amiss. You need to let a physician take a look at you. Something must be causing the memory loss,\" said Jane calmly. \"Yes, you are right, of course,\" said Tom, but did not look convinced and turned to the window again. Jane realised he was frightened of what the doctor might find. But since he had started remembering things, Jane was sure his condition was not permanent. There where so many unasked questions in his eyes. Questions Jane knew she could not answer. He would not let her know how much and what he remembered. Jane watched him fearfully as he stood silently looking out the window with a thoughtful look on his face. She wished there was something she could do for him, but alas, there was nothing. Nothing ever went as planned, Jane knew that by now. But life still took her by surprise from time to time. It was as if someone above had it in for her. Tears began to rise in her eyes and she had to look away. \"I will go see to breakfast,\" said she and left him before he had the chance to turn and offer a reply. -xxx- Tom could see the combination of pain and relief on her face. But there was nothing he could do or say to offer her any reassurance before he remembered more. There were so many things he would want to ask her about but he was not sure she could give him the answers. He hoped the physician could give him some answers regarding his condition at least. At the same time Tom was afraid that he would that there was nothing wrong with him. He could hear the tears in her voice when she said she was going to see to breakfast. But before he could utter another word she was out of the room, her hurried footsteps disappearing down the hall. Tom felt trapped, trapped in his body and trapped in this unknown house. He wished more memories would come back to him to make him feel more certain that his condition was only temporary. But there was nothing, only hazy images of children he could not remember the names of. The harder he tried the farther the images from his passed seemed. Frustrated he started pacing the room. There was something in the back of his head that was constantly gnawing at him for attention. Just as he thought he had it within his grasp it was gone. He got the feeling that Jane was not the only one who depended on him. Somewhere out there, there were more people counting on him. But who? And why? He sighed. Once again he found himself in front of the window, gazing out over the white landscape, as if the white landscape held the answer to his current predicament. His blue eyes swept over the plains outside, eagerly drinking in his surroundings, trying to figure out what this place was. The snow glistened in the sunlight and was still undisturbed by human or animal touch. It was truly a beautiful day. It was a blank slate, a beginning of something new. Tom could feel it, but could not understand why that thought crossed his mind. Perhaps it was because of his current situation, perhaps it was because of something that had happened before, but it did feel like something significant had happened in his life just not long ago. -xxx- Jane fingered on the necklace Tom had given her that summer. She was truly worried about him. The idea of him not remembering was terrifying and she did not want to think of what would happen if he did not remember anything more. \"My husband left about an hour ago, Miss Austen,\" said Mrs Phelps as Jane sat down by the table in the kitchen, helping her making sandwiches. \"I hope he get there safely. The roads must be very difficult to travel, Mrs Phelps,\" said Jane. \"Did you get any sleep at all?\" She saw the tiredness in the other woman's face. \"Only a few hours, Miss. How about you?\" \"I must have dozed off some time during the night. Mr Lefroy was up when I woke,\" said Jane. \"And how is he?\" \"As before,\" sighed Jane. Her worry must have shown, because Mrs Phelps sat down next to her and took Jane's hands in hers, pressing them and trying to infuse Jane with some of her own strength. \"I am sure there is nothing to worry about, Miss Austen. You will see that everything will be sorted out as my husband returns with the doctor,\" said Mrs Phelps reassuringly. Jane wanted to believe her and share her optimism, but she could not. She rose and walked over to the window, gazing out into the whiteness outside. She folded her arms around her waist as to shield herself from reality. Behind her she could hear Mrs Phelps finishing the breakfast tray, minding her own business. The serene scenery outside did not offer any answers, however. Jane was as helpless as she had been before. If only Tom could start remembering more things from his past and present, that would calm her mind considerably. Her hand flew up to the necklace again, as if to give her some kind of reassurance. She sent a silent prayer to the Lord and Mary to help her in this pressing time of need. \"Here we are then, Miss Austen,\" said Mrs Phelps behind her. \"All finished to be taken to Mr Lefroy.\" Jane turned and forced a smile on her face. Mr and Mrs Phelps had been so helpful to her and Tom. She did not know what she would have done if they were not here. \"Thank you, Mrs Phelps,\" said Jane and took the tray out of her hands. \"Please send Mr Phelps and the doctor to the drawing room as soon as they arrive.\" \"Will do, Miss.\" -xxx- He heard her steps coming closer and he forced a calm look on his face as he turned his back to the window. No more answers had come, no new memories had resurfaced. Tom found it most disturbing. He noticed the haunted look on her face as she entered as he saw her dark eyes were clouded with worry. He tried to smile, but he felt it freeze into a stale grimace instead. He could not pretend not to be worried. He did not want to pretend in front of her. There was no need for that. She was the only person he knew to trust right now. She walked over and put the tray down on the little table, trying to look unbothered. She poured two cups of tea for them and then sat down with her hands in her lap. Tom went over and took a cup, but as there was only one chair, he remained standing. \"Do you want to sit?\" asked Jane as she saw him stand. \"No, that is fine, you can sit. We can take turns,\" said he. She nodded and took her cup of tea and sipped carefully on the hot liquid. Her hand shivered slightly as she reached for a sandwich. He was struck by the love he felt for her, a strange need to take care of her. Tom still was not sure what they had together, but he was sure they belonged together. But he had married someone else. \"Have a sandwich,\" she said and turned her dark eyes to meet his. \"You must be hungry.\" He did as he was told. \"I still do not see what a physician can do to help my situation, Jane,\" said he after a while. \"I would feel much calmer after he has examined you,\" said Jane and rose. Her hand flew up to her neck where it found a necklace with a heart of gold in it. She fingered on it for a while. Tom knew he had seen it before. Just as he recognised it as a gift to her from himself as a small token of his affection for her a steady stream of more memories came rushing back. It hit him with such power that he felt dizzy and had to sit down. \"Tom, are you alright?\" Jane knelt down next to him. \"Yes, I am fine!\" cried he, happy as he remembered everything. Mary's death, his children, Jane, what had happened after the meeting by the pond all those years ago, his uncle… \"I remember!\" Her dark eyes lit up. \"Everything?\" she whispered, unbelievingly. \"Everything,\" he nodded and took her in his arms. \"This is our future home, Jane.\" Jane nodded through tears. \"Future Mrs Thomas Langlois Lefroy…\" She buried her face in his neck and cried. Tom felt the tears trickle down his own face. Never had he felt such relief. -TBC- I hope it was worth the long wait.[Chapter 39] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary:nThe story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom havenmet again.

I so hope you will bear with me as thenupdates may take a while longer. Partn39 : In which everything is clearingnup JanenAusten could not remember a time when she had felt more relieved. Thentears fell down her cheeks and she could not stop laughing. \"Thanknthe Lord,\" she said. Tom smiled at hernand wiped her tears away. \"I have never been so scared in my life.\" \"Neithernhave I,\" said Tom. Tears glistened in his blue eyes as he smiled atnher. \"It was a horrible feeling, notnknowing where I was and why. You were the only thing in my head. Mynguiding light through the darkness.\" Jane smiled at him and feltnthat she could finally relax. All the tensions from the last day letngo of her body and she started to shake uncontrollably. If she hadnnot been in Tom's arms she would have fallen to the floor. They satnlike that until Mr Phelps came with the physician. The looks on thengentlemen's faces was priceless. Jane knew Mr Phelps had beennexpecting to see them in the same state as he had left them. Now henwas greeted by smiling faces. \"Thisnis Mr Johnston, our physician. I have explained everything to him,\"nsaid Mr Phelps. \"But it seems like we are not in need of hisnservices anymore.\" Mr Phelps smiled. Jane got up from Tom's lapnand smiled at the elderly white haired man that had followed MrnPhelps into the drawing room. \"Oh,nI think Mr Lefroy could use a quick see over,\" she said. \"Wenstill do not know what caused it all.\" Tom rose as well and bowed. \"MrnJohnston, how kind of you to take the time to come and see me. Thenmemories just came rushing back,\" said Tom. \"Thatnis not uncommon,\" replied the physician. \"But as Miss Austennrightly said, I still want to examine you, Mr Lefroy.\" \"Ofncourse, Mr Johnston,\" said Tom. The physician put down his bag nextnto the table and asked Tom to sit down again. After examining him thendoctor smiled. \"Therendoes not seem to be anything wrong with you, Mr Lefroy,\" said he. \"Do younhave any idea of what caused the memory loss, Mr Johnston?\" askednJane. \"Thenstress of being out in the snow like that could have brought it on,nMiss Austen,\" replied Mr Johnston. \"Or perhaps the fall, but thatndid not injure Mr Lefroy.\" \"Inam just glad the memories came back as they did,\" said Tom withnrelief written all over his face. \"Arennot we all, Mr Lefroy,\" said Mr Phelps. -xxx- Wordsncould scarcely make justice to the relief Tom was feeling as MrnJohnston declared that there was nothing wrong with him. \"Isnthere any possibility that something like this might happen again?\"nasked Jane worriedly. \"It isntoo hard to say, Miss Austen,\" said Mr Johnston. \"There is alwaysna possibility, since I cannot tell what caused it in the first place.nBut if Mr Lefroy stays inside during snowstorms in the future andnpromise to rest up before going on another adventure, he should benfine.\" The physician winked at Tom. \"Wenwere supposed to go back home tomorrow,\" said Tom, rememberingnJane's birthday and the preparations back home. \"Thatnwill all depend on the roads being cleared, Mr Lefroy,\" said MrnPhelps. \"It was not an easy task to get by on horseback today, andnI know they have been working on clearing the main roads since itnstopped snowing.\" \"Thennwe will have to wait and see,\" said Tom. He did not want to gonagainst the doctor's orders of resting, but he was keen on gettingnhome to his children. They would be worried if they did not arrive asnhe had said. He longed to see them all. The last day's ordeal hadnmade him more humble to the idea of how quickly life could change. \"Shallnwe continue our tour of the house?\" asked Jane. Tom realised thatnthey had been right in the middle of the grand tour when thensnowstorm came in their way. \"Certainly,nmy dear,\" replied Tom with a smile. \"If that would be alrightnwith Mr Johnston, of course.\" Jane turned to the physician. \"Ifnyou take it slow and do not exert yourself, Mr Lefroy,\" said MrnJohnston in a mild lecturing tone, \"Inbelieve it should be alright.\" \"Thanknyou for all your help, Mr Johnston,\" said Tom and shook thenphysician's hand. \"I am so relieved to hear that there is nothingnthe matter with me.\" Mr Johnston bowed his head slightly. \"Inwill accompany Mr Johnston back to thenvillage, Mr Lefroy,\" said Mr Phelps. \"I will ask around about thenprogress on the roads. Hopefully you will be able to go home asnplanned tomorrow.\" \"Thanksnso much for your help, Mr Phelps,\" said Jane. \"I do not know whatnwe would have done without you and your wife.\" Jane took his handnand pressed it. \"Thatnis what we are here for, Miss Austen,\" said the younger gentleman,nturning bright red by the compliment. Tom smiled slightly. MrnJohnston and Mr Phelps said their good byes and left them to explorenthe house. Mr Johnston said he would be back the next day to makensure Tom was fit to travel if the roads permitted it. Tom was quitensurprised over the physician's helpfulness and promised himself tonsend Mr Johnston something when he got back to Limerick. Perhaps anbasket for him and his family would be a nice gesture for thenholidays. \"Shallnwe, my dear?\" asked Tom and took her by the arm and led her out ofnthe drawing room. \"Wenshall,\" replied Jane. -xxx- Janenwas happy to, once again, be alone with Tom. Her heart was now asnlight as it had been heavy just hours ago. They had truly been testednonce again, and she was certain this was not their last test.nNevertheless, she hoped it would be. She did not know how much morenshe could take. Jane would not rest easy until she was Mrs ThomasnLanglois Lefroy, and that day could not come soon enough. \"I amnso happy that Mr Johnston did not find anything wrong with you, Tom,\"nsaid Jane and pressed his arm affectionately. She did not know whatnshe would have done if the physician had found something wrong withnhim. \"So amnI,\" said Tom and patted her arm, drawing her closer. She rested hernhead on his shoulder and sighed happily as they strolled down thenhallway. The manornwas everything she had imagined it to be and more. Jane could easilynpicture herself living there with Tom and his children. \"Intrust it is all to your liking, my dear?\" said Tom as they hadnfinished the tour. \"Verynmuch so,\" replied Jane with a soft smile. She had secretly pickednout a room she thought suited very well as a nursery for an infant,nthough she would never tell anyone about it. Jane knew that givingnTom a child was most probably an unattainable dream, but still it wasnsomething she could not stop herself from dreaming of. \"Havenyou picked out rooms for us?\" asked Tom. The thought of sharingnrooms with Tom sent Jane's heart racing. Sharing his bed… Janenfelt her cheeks turn crimson. \"I amnnot completely sure yet,\" she hesitated. \"But I was thinking ofnsome of the rooms overlooking the gardens.\" Tom nodded approvingly. \"Younmust choose a room for your writing. A room where you can findninspiration,\" said he. Jane smiled. He truly had her best at heart,nwanting her to continue writing. Tom had grown into a mostnconsiderate man who put others before himself. \"Inspirationnhas never been my problem, my dear,\" remarked Jane with a smile. \"Perhaps,\"nhe said. \"But you never know. To be mistress of a house this sizenand with all the children… Well, it might be hard to find the timenand the inspiration to write.\" \"Oh,nI think I can manage,\" said Jane, confident that she would makentime to write. It was not as if she would not have help with runningnthe house. She would really need the support of a competent help.nJane was sure Millie and the Joneses would come with them to stay atnCarrigglas. Mr and Mrs Phelps would make an excellent addition tontheir staff. \"And I have a few ideas in my head that I should getndown on paper as soon as we get back.\" Thenweather stayed calm and clear the rest ofnthe day. Mr Phelps returned with news of the roads being cleared andnthat there should be no trouble for them to return back to Limericknthe next day. -xxx- JanenLefroy was making sure that everything was set for the surprise partynfor Miss Austen. She really hoped that Miss Austen would not mindnthem throwing her this party even though she had specifically askednfor a small gathering. Jane was slightly worried, but Miss Cassandranand Mrs Austen assured her that Miss Austen would be happy. They hadnbeen very helpful in preparing the house for a birthday celebration. AsnJane looked out the window, she was a bit worried about the amount ofnsnow that had fallen the last day. There had been reports of peoplensnowed in all over the county and that the roads were troublesome.nShe looked at the clock and found it was still time before her fathernhad said they would be back. Since she had not heard anything, shenwas confident they were on their way home. The guestnwould begin to arrive within the hour and Jane was starting to get anbit nervous. This was the first real party she had planned on hernown. Usually her mother had been in charge of that and Jane hadnhelped her. But this was her party for Miss Austen. She was the onenwho had made all the major decisions once her father had given hisnapproval. \"MissnJane?\" Jane turned to find Millie in the doorway. \"Millie?\" \"Everythingnis set, Miss,\" said Millie with a smile. \"Now I think it is timenwe get you dressed, Miss.\" Jane smiled and looked down at the dressnshe was wearing, it was old and almost outgrown, but she had notnwanted to ruin one of her newer ones when baking. \"Yes,nyou are right, Millie,\" she replied, \"I better hurry! Look at thenstate of me!\" Millie only smiled mildly. \"Come onnthen, Miss,\" said Millie and led the way out of the room. -TBC- Again I'm terribly sorry for being so negligent of my dearnreaders and updating so late.

Partn40 : In which Miss Austen is startingnher 39 th year \"Happynbirthday, my dear,\" he whispered in her ear as he woke her up thennext day. Propriety had forbid them to sleep in the same room againnand Tom had slept in a room on the other side of the hallway. MrnPhelps had provided them with mattresses he had found the nightnbefore. Tomnhad let her sleep in. He knew she had not slept much since hisnaccident. Mrs Phelps helped him put together a breakfast tray tonsurprise Jane with. Mr Phelps had discovered that the roads werenclear enough to travel. Tom had told the driver to have the carriagenready by noon, so that they would be home in time for Jane'snbirthday party. Butnbefore that they still had plenty of time to draw up some plans fornCarrigglas. Mr Phelps was to see to that their will be done at sitenand needed to be included in their discussions. Tom was filled withnhopes and dreams for the future. He could not wait to fulfil Jane'snevery wish a whim. Tomnlooked down at the woman, still far away in dreaming, and was oncenagain struck by her beauty. Time had been kind on her features andnher lines only brought a more mature handsomeness to her face. Itnshowed a woman who had lived through hernfair share of set backs but also tremendous joy. His heart was fillednwith love and happiness when he thought of spending the rest of hisnlife together with Jane Austen. He could not think of anyone elsenbetter to grow old with. Thisndrawing room would have to be turned into their special room. A roomnwhere they could sit in front of the fire, discussing this and that,nplan their future and relish over their lucky situation in life. Henwould make it his own personal project, perhaps even make it hisnwedding gift for her. \"Jane,nmy love,\" he whispered again, kissing her soft cheek. \"It is timento wake up.\" -xxx- Janenstirred and sleepily opened her dark eyes, smiling as she saw who hadnwoken her up. Tom smiled at her and gave her a soft kiss on her headnbefore helping her up from the mattress. She was not as limber as shenused to and the help was welcomed. Tom had put a tray with breakfastnon the table. Tom'snsudden loss of memory had almost made her forget about her birthday.nIt felt odd not to be at home at Chawton, but here in the arms ofnTom. A year ago she had not thought she would every lay eyes on Tomnagain, let alone be engaged to be his wife. She had thought she wasndestined to live out her hopes and dreams in her novels. Thenlast days' events had reminded her hownfeeble life was and how it could change in just an instant. Janendecided then and there to, from now on, live her life to the fullest.nThere was no turning back and Jane embraced what life would throw atnher. As long as Tom was by her side she felt she could conquernanything. \"Whatnare you thinking?\" Tom interrupted her string of thoughts. Janensmiled, \"Oh, merely on how different my life has become. I hadngiven up this dream many years ago. But here I am…\" \"Yes,nJane, here you are,\" said Tom and took her hand. \"Instill cannot believe this is for real. This life with you. Our lifentogether…\" Jane found it hard to put words to the flow ofnemotions that swelled up inside of her. \"Inknow, my love,\" said Tom and brought her hand up to his lips,nbrushing it gently. \"But you better start believing, because it isnfor real. And I am not planning on going anywhere soon.\" Janensmiled, but did not meet his eyes. Tom caressed her cheek and tiltednher chin up. Blue met hazel in a gaze that said more than a thousandnwords could ever do. \"Inknow,\" she whispered. They atentheir breakfast in silence, contemplating on how their lives hadnchanged. No words were necessary. They knew exactly what the othernwas thinking. -xxx- When hernfather and Miss Austen did not arrive as planned in the latenafternoon, Jane Lefroy was slightly worried. For the sake of hernbrothers and sister she remained calm and blamed her father'sntardiness on the weather and most probably troublesome roads. Had shenreally expected them to arrive just as planned when it had fallennmore snow in a few days than she ever had seen in her twelve year oldnlife? \"Hasnmy sister not arrived yet, Miss Lefroy?\" asked Miss CassandranAusten, when Jane for the fifth time peered out into the darkness innhopes of seeing lights indicating an approaching carriage. \"No,\"nreplied she sullenly. \"Andnthere has been now word to explain the lateness?\" \"I havennot heard anything, Miss Austen.\" \"Then Inam sure they will be here soon, Miss Lefroy,\" smiled Miss Austen.n\"Had anything happened I am sure we would have heard about it bynnow,\" she continued. Jane knew she was right, but could not helpnbut to worry. Since her mother's death she had come to rely on hernfather and Miss Jane Austen to be there for ever. And at the samentime she had learned that life could end quickly and almost withoutnwarning. Jane prayed for her father and Miss Jane Austen's safenreturn home. -xxx- After anlight lunch Tom and Jane found themselves being homeward bound. Tomncould not get home fast enough. He missed his children greatly andnwanted to have them in his arms as soon as humanly possible. Thenroads proved to be fairly cleared of snow, but the journey progressednpainfully slowly. Tom hadnleft instructions with Mr Phelps, utterly convinced that the youngngentleman would execute them without any flaw. Mr Phelps had provednto be an excellent care taker in Tom's absence and Tom was surenthat Mr Phelps would not let him down. Not many men would have donenwhat Mr Phelps had in order to save him. Few would have risked theirnown life like that. Tomnsent Mr Phelps and his wife a thankful thought as he nibbled on ansandwich. He looked forward to enrich his staff with their services.nThey would need more hands when they moved to Carrigglas since thenestate was so much larger. Tom liked to have a more personalnrelationship with his help and he had found that they stayed onnlonger and were more reliable if you took the time to take interestnin their lives. \"Wellnmy dear, I believe we are in grave need of a sledge,\" cried Tomnwhen they for the forth time got stuck in the snow. Jane laughednsoftly at his outburst. Thenpart of the road they were now travelling was poorly cleared and theynhad to take it very slow. Tom got out, aiding the driver in hisnattempts to get the carriage movable again. At this rate they wouldnnot be home for another couple of hours and behind schedule. Hendearly hoped that this would not be a reason for alarm at home.nHopefully they would be sensible enough to blame their tardiness onnthe weather. -xxx- JanenAusten could see that Tom was getting anxious. Their progress wasnvery slow and the darkness did not make the task of getting home anyneasier. Jane too longed to be off the road and back in front of anwarm fire, surrounded by Tom's children. Listening on how Tom toldnthem all about their adventure in the snow. Shenprayed for them not to be much upset about them being late. She wasnworried that there had been word of them not reaching the inn asnplanned, but Mr Phelps had visited the inn when he went for thenphysician and informed them that Mr Lefroy and Miss Austen was safenand sound at Carrigglas and they need not worry or send word thatnthey were missing. She had not heard a report that word had been sentnout. Thenthought of such news finding her mother and sister at Chawton wouldnbe devastating for them. Jane's hand flew up to her chest as shenlet out a gasp of anxiety. But she soon composed herself again.nSurely no word had been sent to worry her family. With anslight rocking motion the carriage was free from the snow that hadnhindered its way. \"Herenwe go again,\" Tom smiled as he climbed back into the carriage andnnestled down beside her under the rug. \"Younare cold, my dear,\" whispered she as she took his hands in hers.nShe brought them up to her mouth and blew on them. \"Funny,nI do not feel cold at all,\" said he with a mischievous smilenspreading on his face. \"Not with you by my side.\" He stillnmanaged to make her feel twenty years old again, still making hernstomach flutter with anticipation and bewilderment. A hint of rednessncrept onto her cheeks and her eyes began to sparkle. \"Get usnhome, Mr Lefroy,\" said she, soberly. \"I long to see thenchildren.\" \"As younwish, dearest,\" smiled he and kissed her hands. -xxx- Finally anglimmer of light came on the road. Jane Lefroy let out a sigh ofnrelief. \"Herenthey are now!\" cried she to the others. Guests had come and beennsent home and the only ones that remained were Mrs Austen, MissnAusten and Mr Lefroy. Miss Cassandra looked up from her handwork andnsmiled. \"Betternlate than never,\" said she. \"Atnlast!\" cried Mrs Austen. Mr Lefroy, however, took the news morencalmly and only smiled. \"Millie,nthey are here!\" cried Jane Lefroy. \"Make haste!

Disclaimer: I do not own Jane Austen, Tom Lefroy or any other character in this story. Facts are taken from the Becoming Jane Fansite. Part 41: In which hopes and dreams fills the air At last the main house was in sight. Tom was exhausted from the pushing of the carriage every few miles and longed to see his children. He usually missed them when he was away, but this time it was more serious. It was like he had not seen them for ages. He could not get out of the carriage fast enough and hurriedly helped Jane out before rushing to the door and entering his home. They were awfully late and he realised that the guests had come and gone without seeing the birthday girl. Tom did not mind really as he was glad that he could spend the evening alone with his family and Jane's. Perhaps this was a more suitable way to celebrate Jane's birthday after all. She had said she did not want anything big, had she not? \"Papa!\" Jane Lefroy flung herself around his neck, closely followed by the rest of his children. \"Careful child! I am old and cannot bare the lot of you!\" chuckled he as he tried his best to make his arms embrace them all. Soon he found himself on the floor with his children on top of him. A soft laughter brought his eyes up. \"Miss Austen, a little help?\" \"I think it looks like you have it under control,\" smiled she as she took her coat off and handed it to Jones. The bundle of humans on the floor got up and corrected their clothes, realising how inappropriate they were behaving. Tom was the last to get up, he brushed off his coat and drew a hand through his hair, smiling at his children. \"We were worried when you did not come as you had said,\" said Anthony. \"Yes, very,\" his sister Jane agreed, looking very grave. \"The roads were not as free of snow as one would have hoped,\" said Tom. \"But we are here now, are we not?\" \"At last!\" cried Anne. \"We have been waiting for ages. Everybody has left.\" As soon as the words were out of her mouth she realised what she had said and clutched her hands over her mouth, looking with big eyes on her older sister. \"I am sorry...\" \"Do not worry,\" said her sister. \"I am quite certain Miss Austen had figured it out anyway.\" Jane looked at them, \"What do you mean?\" Jane Lefroy looked at Tom for approval and he nodded. No use to try and keep it a secret now. \"We were planning a surprise party for you, Miss Austen, but since you were late all the guests have gone home,\" said his eldest daughter. \"I see,\" said Jane with a smile. She had known all along, of course. \"I am sorry that I have missed my own birthday celebration.\" \"Oh, there are still a few guests here that want to see you,\" Anthony said with a mischievous smile. \"Is there?\" Jane did look surprised. Tom smiled. \"Escort Miss Austen to the dining room, Jane,\" said he. His daughter nodded and offered Miss Austen her arm and the rest of the children followed. -xxx- Jane Austen was surprised to hear that there was still someone there to see her. As she followed the children to the dining room she wondered who it might be. Henry and Eliza perhaps. But they would not leave their children. Her sister? But she would not leave their mother. Excitement spread throughout her body and she hurried her steps, eager to see who it was. As they entered the dining room she was surprised to find her sister and mother seated at the table. \"Cassandra! Mamma!\" cried she, happily surprised, and hurried over to them, too excited to notice the elderly gentleman who was sitting on the other end of the large table. \"Jane! You are finally home!\" Her sister fell into her arms, embracing her tightly. \"How was the journey?\" \"A troublesome ordeal,\" replied Jane. \"But we are here now, that is all that matters. I cannot believe you are here.\" She kissed them both. \"Tom asked us to come and look after the children while you were away. We came just after you left,\" said her mother. \"I had no idea, I thought they were just planning a party,\" said Jane, glad that Tom had been thoughtful enough to send for her mother and sister. He kept on showing what a thoughtful man he had turned out to be. He would make a wonderful husband. \"We will stay for Christmas,\" said Cassandra. Jane lit up in another bright smile. \"That is wonderful news!\" Then she thought of Eliza and Henry. \"If only Henry were here too. I long to see him and Eliza and the children.\" \"I am sure something can be arranged,\" said Tom who had entered the dining room. Jane turned to him. \"Would not that be too much trouble? I mean will there be enough room?\" Jane looked worried. \"I think we can manage,\" smiled he. \"If it will make you happy, my dear.\" \"But what about your family? Are not they coming?\" \"Oh, but they live so close they need not to stay the night,\" came a deep voice from the other side of the room. Jane turned to find Mr Lefroy, Tom's dad, smiling at her. She hurried over to take his hands in a late greeting. \"They always come on Christmas Eve, but never stay the night.\" \"But with this snow...\" Jane was not convinced. \"I have already written to Henry and invited them,\" Tom confessed. \"And my brothers and sisters will be joining us for Christmas Eve, and perhaps New Years Eve. I thought a ball would be suitable entertainment for us.\" \"A ball?\" Now Jane Lefroy looked surprised. \"You never said anything about a ball!\" \"Yes, a ball. Miss Austen's first, but certainly not last, as mistress of this household,\" said Tom. \"The invitations have already been sent out.\" \"You devil, you never said a word!\" Jane Austen was baffled. It was too much. \"Is there really enough time to be planning a ball?\" \"I think you will find your mother and sister has already made some plans for you, Millie and Mrs Jones will help with the menu.\" Jane looked at her mother and sister, who were both smiling encouragingly. Then she looked at the children who all looked positively bewildered by the idea of a New Years ball, and that settled that. -xxx- Tom was afraid he had gone too far when he had decided on the ball. But with Mrs and Miss Austen as well as Mrs Henry Austen there, he was sure it would not be too much trouble. Jane looked absolutely overwhelmed. \"Then I find myself persuaded,\" Jane said with a smile. Tom let out a sigh of relief. \"You are truly full of surprises, Mr Lefroy.\" \"And I intend to keep on surprising you for the rest of your life, Miss Austen,\" said Tom with a devilish smile. A soft redness crept onto Jane's cheeks as she smiled brilliantly at him. Her eyes glittered with such affection that he lost his breath and could but smile back and they were lost in each other's eyes. \"Papa, dinner is served,\" said his eldest daughter and broke the enchantment. Tom looked around as if awaking after a long slumber. Everyone's eyes were turned towards him and Jane. And no one had missed the affection they felt for one another, and soft smiles played on their lips. Tom and Jane were asked a million questions about the new house. Was it big? How many rooms? Could they all have separate rooms? When could they move in? The questions made it easy for them not to discuss Tom's accident and memory loss. They had decided it was best not to say anything about it in front of the children. They were easily worried as it was. Tom did not feel the need to trouble his father with it either. He was happy to see that his children were all eager to move. Perhaps they, as he did, felt the need of a new beginning. His father did not seem as excited though. The move to Carriglas meant that Tom and his family would be farther away. Tom had of course assured him that he was only a mere couple of hours away, and that he was welcome to stay whenever he wanted. It was very late when they at last could retire for the night. The children had long been asleep in front of the fire, neither Jane nor Tom had the heart to send them to bed in time. They had been fantasising about the new house and how they were to decorate their rooms. Tom had promised to take them in the early spring to choose their rooms and decorate them after their own head. -xxx- Jane was so tired she could hardly keep her eyes open. Her mother had retired to her room, but Cassandra was sitting next to her in front of the warm fire. Tom had left them to see his children to bed. \"Tell me about Carriglas, Jane,\" asked Cassandra. \"Oh, Cassie, it is the most beautiful estate I have ever seen,\" said Jane and smiled dreamingly. She got lost in the dream of filling the house with little children again for a short while, but reminded herself that it was only a dream. A dream that was not likely to come true. \"The balls that I can throw there. And so many rooms! I cannot wait to show it to you!\" \"It sounds like there will be plenty of room for the family to grow,\" suggested Cassandra cautiously. She had always had the ability to read her sisters mind. Children were something they both had dreamed of. \"There is, but…\" Jane looked away, trying to hide the sad look on her face. \"But what?\" \"I am not young anymore, Cassandra.\" \"You are not old either, sister. There is still time.\" \"Perhaps, but do not get my hopes up. The chance of me bearing a child is very little, and as much as I would want to give Tom a child… No it is best not to think about it,\" Jane said decidedly. \"Always so sensible,\" said Cassandra. \"Yes, it is for the best. God will bless me with a child if it is meant to be.\" -xxx- Tom stood in the dark hallway and listened on Jane and her sister's conversation. As much as it gave him joy to hear Jane talk of another child, it pained him to hear her regard it as only a dream. He knew of many women who had had children in her age. But then again, neither of them had been with child for the first time. Tom could only tell from Mary's pregnancies, and not all of them had been easy, but she had been younger and able to handle it. Jane was no youth and Tom would not have her go through with anything that would harm her. But the thought of another child, Jane's child, was overwhelming. Tom could only imagine what she would look like carrying his child under her heart and he was sure pregnancy would become her very well. -TBC- Author's note: I hope you liked it.

Part 42: In which we're having a ball More merry days followed after Jane Austen's birthday. She enjoyed having her mother and sister close and their help in planning the ball. The ball occupied her thoughts, chasing any dreams of becoming a mother out. But at night, the dreams caught up with her. At the age of 39 she was quite certain that being blessed with a child was only that, a dream. There was no use in pining after something that was not likely to happen. Jane pushed all thoughts on children aside, and focused on being thankful for the children that were in her life, as well as her new family. Christmas Eve came with some of Tom's siblings and Mr and Mrs Henry Austen. Jane truly enjoyed entertaining their guests and was really starting to look forward to having the ball, even though it was a big undertaking. Her mother and sister had done most of the planning so far and it was only down to the last details now, such as dinner and refreshments. She wanted to do well on her first try. And though she was now officially accepted in the parish, a ball was always appreciated by the socialites in the community. Tom had invited most of the important people and even some of the less important people. Perhaps some would have frowned at that, but Tom liked to include everyone, and Jane liked that about him. He did not forget his own less fortunate child hood. Even if he had money now, he had earned his place in the community by being friendly to all who deserved it and helping those in need. Much thanks to Mary's kind nature, Jane had understood. Jane's family had done the same to the less fortunate families in their little village. Jane remembered a time when he would rather not be seen in the company of those inferior to him. They had both come a long way since then. Growing mature and sensible. And now, they were going to grow old together. Jane's heart skipped a beat when she thought about it. Growing old together. Together for the rest of their life. Till death did them part. . Jane's heart fluttered even more and she brought a hand up as to still it. Keeping busy proved to be the best remedy for keeping longing thoughts in place. Even though most tasks were already done, there still remained a lot to do. Throwing a ball was not something that could be arranged in a jiffy. After all, Rome was not built in one day. Jane was very thankful her mother, sister and Eliza were there to help her. Otherwise she would not have managed it all. -xxx- With Jane wrapped up in preparation for the ball, Tom was left to catch up on his correspondences and such. He was happy to be at home, surrounded by family and friends. Gifts were exchanged and games were played. The weather did not really allow for anything else, apart from the mandatory trips to church, that was. It was a time of joy. Tom was happy to see his family accepting Jane with open arms and enjoyed her company. The house was never empty or quiet and he truly longed for the move to Carrigglas. The current house was simply getting too small. Luckily he still had a safe haven in his library. Jane and he usually had their afternoon tea there nowadays. Sometimes they stayed on for hours and read to each other, or just talking. But now they were both too busy with other tasks to discuss literature in the light of a fire. Tom missed their little rendezvous, but knew there would be time to have them for the rest of their lives. He felt the rest of their life could not come soon enough. For some reason he could not feel at ease until Jane was legally his wife. Too much had happened in their past for him to believe everything would turn out great just yet. There was still the matter with Mary's parents. He hoped they could see passed their differences to see that their grand children needed them too. He had invited them to the ball. Not because he wanted them there, but for the children's sake. They had declined, of course. Perhaps the wound still was too sore. Or Mr and Mrs Paul were more stuck up than he had imagined. He wondered how they had managed to bring up such an angel as Mary had been. Well, if they did not want to be a part of their grandchildren's life, then who was he to force them? Bemused he watched Jane prepare for the ball. She was so well organised and knew just how to prioritise. She seemed to have everything under control and the night before she was happy to declare everything done. They shared a late cup of tea in the library in front of the fire before going to bed. \"Are you happy, my love,\" asked Tom as she let out a sigh of relief. \"I am,\" smiled she. \"I am very satisfied with my first ball. At least so far. Ask me again tomorrow!\" They shared a laugh. \"I will. And I am sure it will be to everybody's satisfaction,\" said Tom. \"It cannot be any other way when you are the one who has planned it all.\" \"Flattery gets you thus far, my dear Tom,\" Jane smiled. \"But we will see tomorrow.\" -xxx- New Year's morning found the Lefroys and Austens early at the breakfast table. The room was buzzing with anticipation for the evening's ball. The children could barely sit still for all the excitement of having a ball in their house. It was nothing that had happened regularly and since their mother died they had not had many visitors. Now the prospect of a room full of beautifully dressed people filled them with jitters. \"I cannot believe it is tonight,\" Jane Lefroy mused. \"Oh, what are we to do all day? The time is going so fast.\" \"The weather is nice enough for spending sometime outside in the snow if you dress properly,\" said her father. The younger children lit up and clapped their hands. Playing in the snow was one of their favourite things. The children quickly excused themselves to get dressed for a day in the snow. -xxx- Jane Austen sat by her window looking down at the playing children, longingly. She almost wished she was little again and allowed to tumble around in the soft snow. It was something soothing and calming about the pristine whiteness outside. Even if she was nervous about the coming night, she felt calm when looking out into the whiteness. With Tom by her side she knew it was going to be a success. She fingered on the dress she was soon to put on. It was pale yellow and resembled the one she had worn at Lady Graham's ball. She had instructed the seamstress to make it as she wanted it, even if the fashion was not the same. Jane had loved that dress and she had had her first kiss in it. Nothing could be better suited for her first ball. She smiled as she remembered how shy she had been after her bold kiss. The memory of that one chaste kiss brought a slight redness to her cheeks, even so many years later. If anyone had seen her at that moment they might say she was glowing. Millie came to help her with her eventing toilette. \"Miss Austen, you look absolutely marvellous tonight,\" exclaimed she.\"Master will be pleased, I am sure.\" Jane blushed at the compliment. Even if she considered herself looking exceptionally well this evening, it was always different to hear someone else say it. \"I do hope so,\" smiled Jane. It is all for him , she added silently as she studied her reflexion in the mirror. Her hair was made up in an artful way, and a few strands played around her delicate face. Pearls gleamed from a few places among her dark curls. She was very satisfied with the way she looked tonight. \"Master will not be able to keep his eyes off of you, Miss,\" said Millie. Jane had grown accustomed to Millie's way of always saying what was on her mind, and with Jane Millie did not have to keep it in check. -xxx- Tom nearly lost his breath as Jane come down the stairs. She was positively radiant tonight. She looked more sure of herself than he had seen in a very long time. \"Madame Austen,\" said he, bowed slightly and offered her his arm. \"Mr Lefroy, a pleasure,\" smiled she and took his arm. \"And may I say, you look exceptionally splendid this evening,\" said he as he steered her in the direction of the large dining room. \"You may. And I might say likewise, Mr Lefroy,\" said Jane. They entered the large room and Tom felt Jane draw a deep breath. He studied her face closely as she looked around the room. Her expression changed into surprise. Tom knew his staff had outdone themselves. The room looked marvellous. Subtly lit with hundreds of little candles. All according to Jane's wishes, of course. A small orchestra had been hired for the occasion and Tom thought they would try it out before all the guest arrived. \"Would you like to dance?\" he asked. \"Now?\" \"Why not?\" \"We are all alone.\" \"That was kind of the idea. I wanted to have a moment with you before others come and steal you away,\" said Tom. \"Besides, the orchestra needs to warm up too.\" \"Oh, when you put it like that...\" smiled Jane and gave him her hand. Tom gestured to the conductor to start playing. \"I am beginning to think you had this planned all along.\" \"Perhaps,\" smiled Tom secretly. They stood facing each other. Tom had chosen this particular dance just for her, in remembrance of their first dance at Basingstoke Assembly, the Country dance. Jane smile slightly as she realised it. It was a bit odd dancing it just the two of them, but they managed. -xxx- Jane Lefroy stifled a giggle. Watching her father and Miss Austen dancing all alone in that big hall looked quite odd. But the love that shone through their eyes when the looked at each others made her more serious. Even if she missed her mother, she was glad that Miss Austen was in their life. Jane knew she would be a very good substitute. Jane was happy that her father had allowed her to have a new gown sewn up for her. It was pale blue muslin and she adored it. Millie had helped her with her hair and she looked older than her twelve years. It would be the first ball she had attended. Her younger siblings were to just be attending the first hours and then go to bed. She stood with her sister in the shadows watching her father dance with Miss Austen when Anthony came with their brothers. \"Look, Anthony, are not that the prettiest sight?\" asked Jane, breathlessly. \"I wish I find someone that will love me like that.\" \"I am sure you will,\" said Anthony, quietly. \"I am happy for papa, but it is times like these when I miss mamma the most.\" Jane looked at her brother and put a hand on his arm. \"I know, me too,\" said she, equally quiet. \"But this is a happy day! Let us go join papa and Miss Austen. The guests will be arriving soon.\" -xxx- Jane Austen did not want to leave Tom's arms. She felt so secure with him by her side. And the dancing, how she loved dancing. Tom was a most attentive partner and the country dance took her back to Basingstoke and a December eventing many years ago. It was almost magical. She could have stayed like that for the rest of the night, but the guests were due to arrive at any time. \"Miss Austen, papa?\" Jane Lefroy's tentative voice reached them. Jane turned to her and saw her with her siblings in the doorway. \"Miss Lefroy!\" cried Jane. \"Come on in!\" She smiled widely and bent down to gather all of the children in her arms. \"You all look very handsome and pretty, indeed.\" Jane Lefroy blushed a little at the compliment. Anthony tugged at his jacket. The younger ones were just beaming with excitement. \"What a splendid idea, papa,\" cried Jane Lefroy. \"I think I shall love this night for ever.\" \"Now, Jane, I am sure there will be other nights, just as special as this one,\" Tom said. \"But this is the first. And I shall treasure it, always,\" smiled Jane Lefroy dreamingly. She made a small hop and took a few dance steps. Tom smiled and bow slightly, offering her his hand, \"May I have this dance, Miss Lefroy?\" Jane Lefroy giggled and happily accepted. Jane smiled at the two of them. \"Miss Austen, may I have this dance?\" Anthony spoke up. \"Why, of course, Mr Lefroy,\" said Jane with a curtsey. The orchestra started again on Tom's mark. With two dancing couples and the little ones trying to keep up the best they could it was a little bit easier to dance. \"I hope you do not plan to wear yourself out, sister,\" came Henry Austen's thunderous voice. He was flanked by his mother, wife and sister. \"Oh, Henry, I am sure I can manage to dance a full night yet,\" said Jane, without slowing down. \"I do not doubt you still have many dancing years ahead of you, dear sister,\" Henry said, smiling. \"I came to inform you that our guests are arriving.\" \"Thank you, brother,\" smiled Jane, still dancing. \"We better go greet them.\" Needless to say, the evening was a success. Many of the guests voiced a sadness over the Lefroys leaving Limerick for Carrigglas. They would have liked to see the New Years Ball become a new tradition. Jane was very happy to see all of the guests enjoying themselves, as well as her family. She danced almost every dance and when the eventing was through she was exhausted. Happy, but utterly exhausted. The whole experience of being the hostess was a bit overwhelming, but she had enjoyed being the centre of attention. Everybody wanted to tell her how they enjoyed themselves, how beautiful the room looked, how good the food tasted and how well mannered the children were. There was no end to the praise she got. \"Are you happy, my dear?\" Tom asked as they waved off the last of the guests. He wrapped an arm around her waist and steered her towards the staircase. \"I am, very happy indeed. It was a most splendid night,\" smiled she and leaned into him. \"It was.\" His hand caressed the side of her body. \"I shall be sad to leave this place. It holds many happy memories. And sad.\" She thought of Mary and sent her a loving thought. \"Even if I have only been here for a short time, I have felt at home here.\" \"But now the future holds a new home. Our home,\" whispered Tom in her ear. \"A home where we can make new memories,\" whispered Jane back, and smiled in the dark. Tom placed a small kiss on her cheek. \"Yes. Our memories, our future. Together.\" \"Together.\" As they reached the top of the stairs she turned to him and took his face in her hands. \"I love you Tom Lefroy.\" \"And I love you, Jane Austen.\" And then he kissed her. -TBC- Author's note: Thank you for your patience with this story. Now I will fast forward a bit again. I'm beginning to feel that this story is coming to an end. I'm really having trouble making up new things for it.

They begin questioning their actions and choices in the past (i.e from the time they met in 1795 and forward).This is what could have happened if the movie had not ended. Disclaimer: I do not own Jane Austen, Tom Lefroy or any other character in this story. Author's note: I know it's been ages! I'm so, so sorry, but I really don't want this story to end. But alas, it has to… I claim artistic freedom when it comes to the wedding, even if I have used the Common book of Prayer as a starting point. Just so you know... Part 43: In which we're having a wedding July 1815 Jane Austen could hardly believe the wedding was tomorrow. She could hardly believe it was her wedding tomorrow. Even more difficult it was to believe it was Mr Tom Lefroy she was marrying. The day that she had dreamed of for so long had finally come. The day when she became Mrs Thomas Langlois Lefroy. She had been to the seamstress earlier in the week for her final fitting and now she could not stop admiring the dress that hung opposite her bed. The dress was perfect. It was really a dream come true. She had always imagined this kind of dress when she had allowed herself to dream of marriage. But she had never thought she would wear it. The lacing was delicate and the dress was modest enough for an aging, though blushing, bride. The day was beautiful and perfect for a summer wedding. Carrigglas was brewing with excitement and preparations for the wedding luncheon which was to be held out on the lawn after the ceremony. They had moved into their new home only a month earlier. But with the construction going on they had both been there to and fro the whole spring. They had also been able to make preparations for the wedding in the new parish. Mr and Mrs Phelps proved to be very useful. And as soon as they moved, Mrs and Miss Austen came to join them again. Jane had not needed to do much herself. Millie made sure the children were cared for and her sister and mother made arrangements for the wedding luncheon, only letting Jane decide the menu and the seating. They managed everything else, from flowers, music and servants to guest list. So Jane had been free to decorate the house and the suit she and Tom were to share after the wedding. Now, after months of planning, the day had finally come. Jane woke early, and as usual took a stroll in the gardens before breakfasting. Her stomach was aflutter and she did not know how she would make the time go until it was time to go to church. She let the sunshine warm her face as she walked down to the newly planted rose garden. It would not show its full potential until next summer, but it was still as soothing as Mary's in Limerick had been. But this was Jane's garden, she had decided which plants were to be planted where together with their gardener. Jane had not seen Tom since last night, since it was tradition that the bride and groom did not see each other before the wedding. They had not spent more than a few days apart since Christmas and Jane missed him already, even if she knew she would see him in only a couple of hours. The serenity calmed her nerves down and she could start to look forward to the day. From time to time she still could not believe this was all happening to her. It did not happen as frequently as it had before, she had slowly begun to understand that this was her life now. Carrigglas was her home and Tom was to be her husband. -xxx- Tom Lefroy was watching his wife to be from his window. This was the last time he slept away from her. From tonight they were sharing a suit on the second floor. Jane had decorated it as she saw fit. He had not yet seen it as she had told him it was her gift to him. His gift was a cherry orchard, imitated from Lady Gresham's estate, complete with a water feature and all. It was placed in a far corner where Jane seldom ventured so he had not even mentioned it to her. He looked forward to take her there later that night. Tom felt like a child on Christmas Day. Time crept slowly forward and he had a hard time keeping himself busy. The weather was excellent and since Jane had disappeared inside again, he went for a walk, inspecting the orchard once again. He had asked Millie to light some lanterns after dinner and put out a basket with refreshments for the newly weds. He found it hard to believe this day had finally come. Within merely a few hours Jane Austen was going to walk down the aisle in the parish church and become his wife. There had been a time when the only way he had thought it possible to be with her was to elope. But not anymore. His uncle was long gone and Tom was well on his way to make a name for himself without his uncle's help. Of course he realised what would have happened if Jane had not been sensible enough to leave him at the inn, half way to Gretna Green. They would have struggled and their love would probably not have been enough. Tom inspected the orchard, and it was everything he could have hoped for. In a few years it would be splendid. Tom was very satisfied with his work and could not wait to show his wife. His wife , the word made his heart skip a beat and a smile spread on his face. He felt ready to face the day and all it contained. Tom returned to the house to get dressed. Mr Phelps helped him on with the light grey satin suit. His nerves were getting the best of him as he sat down in the carriage to take him to church. He had his sons with him, but his daughters were riding with Jane. \"Are you excited, papa?\" Anthony asked. \"Yes,\" was all Tom managed to say as the church came into view. The carriage came to a stop and Tom got out, followed by his sons. His father greeted him with a smile and a squeeze of his hands. It was going to a pretty small wedding, and Tom knew that it was exactly what Jane would want. -xxx- Jane's stomach twitched with anticipation as she got out of the carriage. In a very short time she would be married to Tom. A smile spread over her face and she let out her breath. This was going to be a splendid day. The girls were greeted by their grandfather who also greeted Jane with a large smile. He, her mother and the children went inside the church together. Jane was left with her brother, sister and cousin. Eliza and Cassandra kissed her and smoothed her dress and made sure her hair was as she wanted it. Jane pinched her cheeks for some colour and took a very deep breath and let it out slowly. \"Pinch me,\" said she. \"I think I may be dreaming.\" Eliza and Cassandra laughed. \"This is real, dearest Jane,\" said Cassandra and hugged her as tight as she dared. \"And there is none more deserving,\" said Henry. Jane smiled shakily as she took him by the arm. Eliza and Cassandra preceded them into the church. \"You look wonderful,\" whispered Henry as they entered the church. By the alter Tom was waiting for her, and she smiled. Henry gave her a kiss on the cheek as they reached the altar and then she was on her own. \"Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God, and in the face of this congregation, to join together this Man and this Woman in holy Matrimony,\" said the solemn minister and Jane's heart started racing. This was really happening. It was not a dream. She was standing next to Tom in front of their families and friends, to become husband and wife. She glanced over at Tom and found that he looked equally exhilarated. Jane hardly heard what the minister was saying. \"Therefore if any man can shew any just cause, why they may not lawfully be joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter for ever hold his peace.\" Jane held her breath. She had not seen anyone how would say anything, and she knew minister had to say the words, but still, some anxiety made her uncertain. Perhaps the Pauls had shown up? But there was only silence and soon Jane could relax fully. The minister continued: \"I require and charge of you both, as ye will answer at the dreadful day of judgement when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed, that if either of you know of any impediment, why ye may not be lawfully joined together in Matrimony, ye do now confess it. For be ye well assured, that so many as are coupled together otherwise that God's Word doth allow are not joined together by God; neither is their Matrimony lawful.\" Jane stole another glance of her dear Tom and he looked so handsome in his light grey suit, his eyes shone brightly, and his hair was uncommonly tame. Her heart swelled with emotion and love for this man that stood beside her now. -xxx- Tom's heart was full as was his head. He had trouble concentrating on what the minister was saying, all he wanted to do was to have the service over with and to be pronounced Jane's husband. He had been just a tad worried that someone would speak up when asked, but no one had and he was now more relaxed. \"Thomas Langlois Lefroy, wilt thou have this Woman to thy wedded Wife, to live together after God's ordinance in the holy estate of Matrimony. Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour, and keep her in sickness and in health; and, forsaking all other, keep thee only unto her, as long as you both shall live?\" Tom's heart quickened when he said, \"I will.\" He glanced over at Jane and smiled when he caught her eye. The minister turned to Jane; \"Jane Austen, wilt though have this Man to thy wedded Husband, to live together after God's ordinance in the holy estate of Matrimony? Wilt thou obey hem, and serve him, love, honour, and keep him in sickness and in health; and forsaking all other, keep thee only unto him, as long as ye both shall live?\" \"I will,\" said Jane and smiled. \"Who giveth this Woman to this man?\" Henry stepped forward and gave Jane's hand to the minister who then took Tom's hand too. They gave their vows and Tom took out their wedding band and placed it on the book. The minister gave the ring back to Tom to place on Jane's left hand. \"Repeat after me: With this Ring, I thee wed, with my Body I thee worship, and with all my worldly Goods I thee endow: In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.\" Tom repeated and left the ring on Jane's finger. They knelt down and the minister continued: \"Let us pray.\" Tom let his mind drift, spoke when he was supposed to, but longed for them to be alone together. The thought sent shivers down his spine and he looked down at their entwined hands and had visions of another kind of entwinement. \"For as much as Thomas and Jane have consented together in holy Wedlock, and have witnessed the same before God and his company, and thereto have given and pledged their troth either to other, and have declared the same by giving and receiving of a Ring, and by joining of hands; I pronounce that they be Man and Wife together, In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. \"God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost, bless, preserve and keep you, the Lord mercifully with his favour look upon you; and so fill you with all spiritual benediction and grace, that ye may have life ever lasting. Amen.\" After a psalm and some readings by the minister they were truly man and wife. With Jane on his arm, Tom strode out of the church to receive congratulations from his friends and family. Jane was finally his for ever, and ever. -TBC- Author's note: Yes, another chapter is coming. And hopefully a lot sooner this time. Thank you so much for bearing with me![Chapter 44] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again. They begin questioning their actions and choices in the past (i.e from the time they met in 1795 and forward).This is what could have happened if the movie had not ended. Disclaimer: I do not own Jane Austen, Tom Lefroy or any other character in this story. Facts are taken from the Becoming Jane Fansite. Part 44: In which they Share Sweet Kisses and Such Jane Austen could not remember a more festive or joyous time. Everybody was so happy for them. She had never smiled so much, and her cheeks hurt. For all around people wanted to congratulate her and Tom. She hardly knew where to turn. And all the while Tom was by her side, never letting her go. The luncheon was also splendid. Not a dull moment, but all Jane could think about was to be alone with Tom. She wanted to show him the work she had done to their apartment. She wanted to be in his embrace and to just relish on the fact that they now were bound together for ever. Nothing could change that now. No one could come between them ever again. Jane was happy that her family was there to celebrate with them, as well as Tom's father. She could see that the children were enjoying themselves and she smiled at Jane Lefroy who came to join her and her father. The guests had begun begging them for their wedding dance. The small orchestra had begun setting up their instruments. \"We are ready to see you dance now,\" said Jane Lefroy. Tom smiled at his daughter and took his wife under the arm and steered her toward the designated dancing area. The guests swarmed around them and cheered. Jane felt so at home in Tom's arms and soon the guests disappeared and she had only eyes for him. She felt light at her feet, almost floating above ground, and she could not help but smile. She was truly as happy as she had ever been. She rested her head on his shoulder and closed her eyes and enjoyed the moment. As much as she enjoyed being with family and friends she longed to be alone with Tom. The evening could not come soon enough. Suddenly she regretted that they had not planned to go away, and then they would have truly been alone. Perhaps Tom would be persuaded to make a little trip soon. \"There is something I need to show you,\" whispered Tom in her ear as the dance was over. His breath that tickled her ear sent her blood boiling. \"I cannot wait till we are alone,\" whispered Jane back. \"Me neither,\" he breathed and embraced her. It was the most natural gesture, but Jane felt embarrassed. They had not been able to show their affections in public for so long, it almost felt forbidden. A warm feeling spread in her body and she was filled with joy and a more primitive intimate feeling. A feeling that had become more and more frequent as of late. Jane was easily persuaded to wave good bye to her guests. She tried not to notice the meaningful glances that were exchanged by some of them. But she could not help the heat that rose on her cheeks. The luncheon had been going on for longer than they had anticipated, and it was late afternoon when Tom steered Jane away from their friends and family and toward the more secluded area of their gardens. She wondered why, but did not say anything. She was quite happy just to be with him, away from the others. Alone. -xxx- \"Close your eyes,\" Tom whispered as they got closer to his surprise. He could hardly contain his excitement. He wondered how she would react to his present. He hoped she would enjoy it as much as he already did. They needed a sanctuary of their own. Somewhere where they could be totally and utterly themselves, without having to think about anybody else. Not that they really needed a retreat like that, but still, with its likeness of the orchard at Lady Gresham's estate, he hoped it would be a favourite place for them. A place to relive the past and perhaps a certain evening in January in their youth. Jane gripped his hand tighter and stepped carefully on the ground. He held her around her small waist and would not let her fall. \"I have got you,\" said he softly into her ear. A smile spread of her face as she relaxed a bit. \"Only a little bit further, now.\" The evening was warm and they would not have to return to the house for some time. Millie had done her duty and laid some blankets and all the necessities for a romantic evening among newly weds. The thought made Tom shiver with anticipation and he held Jane closer to him. \"Are you ready, my dear?\" asked he was they came to the orchard. He could spot the place where Millie put the refreshments. \"Yes,\" said she, a little bit breathless. \"Open your eyes, my love,\" whispered Tom and stood aside, to take in her reaction. He watched her eyes focus on the sight before her and then the surprise and then wonderment that played over her sweet countenance. It was not so long ago when he had thought he would never see her again. Now they would never be parted again. \"Oh, Tom,\" breathed Jane and turned to look at him. Her dark eyes were filled with tears, but she smiled. \"It is beautiful! How did you manage it?\" \"It was nothing,\" said he, waving it off. \"I would do anything for the woman I love.\" \"It is really too much!\" \"I wanted to do it. I have always looked back at that evening and wanted something similar myself. Now we have a secluded place for just the two of us.\" She smiled softly. \"Thank you,\" said she and took his hand and steered him into the orchard. \"I cannot believe I did not know!\" Jane looked around, wide eyed and beautiful. Tom smiled and pressed her hand. \"Let me show you something,\" said he and steered her to the water feature. Millie had put their refreshments there and he took out the champagne and uncorked it with a poof. She smiled. He filled two glasses and handed her one of them. \"To the love of my life.\" He clinked her glass. Jane was too busy to study the water feature to be able to drink. He could hardly keep his eyes off of her and was standing a few feet away to just look at her. This was a sight he would be able to enjoy for the rest of his life. -xxx- Jane could not believe that Tom had been able to make this happen without her knowing it. She had never been so surprised in her life. Nobody had ever done anything like it for her. With Tom in her life she was really getting spoiled. Life as it should be, she mused as she took a sip of her champagne. She was quite exhausted from standing up all day, and she sank down on the blanket that was laid out in front of the pond. Tom joined her presently and began unpacking the basket that was standing next to the blanket. \"You have really outdone yourself, Tom,\" said she as she accepted the plate of cold meat he presented her. \"Anything for my Mrs Lefroy,\" smiled he. \"And what, pray tell, can Mrs Lefroy do for her Mr Lefroy?\" asked Jane playfully. The wine was affecting her and she began to relax and just enjoy herself. She was beginning to feel quite courageous, and now that they were married, she could do what ever she wished. Nobody would care and tell her she was not allowed. That fact was slowly beginning to sink in. Tom was her husband, and she was allowed to embrace him, or kiss him when ever she felt like it. Now all she had to do was to really do all those things. But even now, when they were completely alone, she hesitated. \"I could think of one or two things,\" said Tom, interrupting her train of thoughts. She coloured and looked away. There were lots of suggestions in that sentence, not to say in his voice. Her stomach tingled and she smiled shyly. She felt her cheeks grow hotter and she looked away. Her mother had informed her of what was expected of her during their wedding night. Jane was not a young girl, but inexperienced as one. And Tom was to be her tutor. Her heart beat hard and fast, her breath got caught in her throat and she could think of no response. She was on the verge of doing something reckless. She sat up on her knees, leaning forward to him. His eyes widened as he watched her approach, but he did not move. Her bodice felt at least two sizes too small as she tried to stifle her rapid breath. She inched forward and placed her lips on his. If he was startled by her action, he did not show it, but welcomed it by encircling her neck with his arms and drawing her even closer to him. \"Was this one of the things you had in mind?\" asked she, breathlessly after a minute of two. Now, her bodice was definitely too small. Her body was reacting in ways she would not have thought possible. \"That was one of the possibilities,\" said Tom, equally breathless, and smiled widely. \"Can I tempt you with a strawberry?\" She looked down at the red berry in his hand. The first of the season. She nodded. The sweet flesh of the fruit almost melted in her mouth. It was warm from lying in the sun. She looked up at Tom and smiled. -xxx- Tom placed his lips on hers again and could taste the sweet taste of ripe strawberry on her lips and in her mouth. His body readily responded to the taste and he felt a surge of desire rise from deep within him. He gently tipped her over and laid her down on the blanket. His hands were caressing the length of her body and he was awarded with a soft moan. He lay down next to her and just gazed upon her. He could hardly believe she was really his, even if they had been joined together in front of God and everyone. \"Do you still get the feeling that this is not for real?\" asked he as he brushed a lock of hair out of her delicate face. \"Constantly,\" whispered she with a smile. She caressed his face and then took his lips in her possession again. He sighed into her mouth, so happy and filled with love and desire that he could scarcely contain himself. If it was not for the sense of propriety and the risk of them being interrupted, he might have made love to her right there and then. But he was not a young adventurous man anymore, and definitely not limber enough to bed a maid in the garden. \"I cannot tell you how many times I have dreamed of this,\" he said, equally softly. \"You have always had a special place in my heart, a place that no one has been able to fill. Not even Mary, I'm ashamed to say.\" \"I…\" Jane did not seem to be able to find the words. Tears glittered in the long entanglement of her eyelashes as she looked down, unable to meet his eyes. Tom cupped her chin gently and tilted her head up, and forced her to meet his gaze. \"Nothing can keep us apart again, Jane.\" She smiled through her tears. \"I know. But still…\" He silenced her with another kiss to convince just how right he was. He intended to continue convincing her every day if he had to. \"I do believe I find myself persuaded,\" she breathed. \"Shall we continue this picnic in a little more comfortable spot?\" Tom asked and winked. Jane's face coloured and she smiled shyly. \"Can we just stay for a moment longer?\" \"If you wish it,\" said Tom. They sat in perfect silence for a while, eating strawberries and sipping on their sparkling wine. The darkness fell around them and the air became cooler. Jane shivered slightly and Tom took that as a cue to sweep her up in his still strong arms and carry her to their apartment. This time he would not take no for an answer. \"Tom,\" she giggled surprised and a little bit bewildered. -xxx- Jane felt young again. The wine was affecting her in a most exhilarating way. Her shyness was slowly beginning to fade and she made no complaints when Tom scooped her up in his arms. She was ready. He took her in by a back door, which was seldom used. The staff had been told to keep out of their part of the estate. He put her down as they got inside. \"I believe it is your turn to show the way,\" said he. Jane took him by the hand and led him up the stairs. Her stomach was filled with fluttering butterflies as she neared the door that led to their rooms. \"Are you ready?\" She turned to him. \"Yes.\" She had not been sure as what Tom would expect. She was sure he would like what she had done, and how she had decorated it. She had kept it simple and in light colours. She was really pleased with how it had come together. She pushed the door open and was happy to see that the room was lit up with candles as requested and she shivered slightly with anticipation as she glanced over at the bed to see if the covers had been turned. They had. Jane's new found courage was suddenly gone and she just felt shy and awkward. She did not dare look at Tom at that moment. \"Jane, this is just as I had imagined it,\" said Tom as he took a walk around the room they were standing in. \"I am glad you like it,\" replied she. Her eyes kept landing on the large bed in the adjoining room and she felt an unfamiliar hotness grow in her body. She looked over at Tom to see if he had noticed, but he seemed too busy with inspecting the room. Jane took a deep breath as to cool herself down. This was not like her at all. She was usually so calm and collected, even with him so close. Perhaps it was just the seriousness of the day wearing off, she pondered. She was exquisitely exhausted with the continuous joyful feeling she felt all day. She longed to creep into bed and fall into a sweet slumber. Tom was suddenly next to her and she started slightly, but tried not to show how deep in thought she had been. She smiled brightly. \"You are finally mine,\" he whispered hoarsely and took her in his arms. \"Yes,\" was all she managed to reply. The hot feeling in her body was all over her body and she got lost in the moment. His lips found hers in a deep and very intimate kiss, so unlike the kisses they had shared before. Jane felt her legs go week and she clung to him for support. \"Yes,\" she breathed again as he took her in his arms, lifted her and carried her to the bed. -xxx- Tom found it hard to be calm and gentle as he freed Jane of her wedding attire. He forced himself to take it slow, remembering that this was her first time. He wanted her to enjoy it. The soft sighs and little moans she let out told him that she approved of what he was doing and he got a bit more courageous in his actions. Jane Austen was finally going to be his, utterly and completely, heart and soul, body and mind. He looked down into her dark eyes, saw the fire that burned in them and smiled. \"I love you,\" said he. \"I love you, heart and soul, Jane.\" \"And I love you, Tom, heart and soul\" replied she with a smile. He kissed her and after that they did not speak for a long time. Tom was smiling contently into the darkness. \"Jane,\" he whispered. \"Yes?\" she answered sleepily, stirring slightly towards him. His body eagerly responded. \"Did I do that well?\" He almost chuckled as he uttered the words she had said after kissing him all those years ago. \"Very,\" said she, and he could hear the smile in her voice. \"I cannot believe I have missed out on that for these past 20 years.\" She laughed softly and turned to him. \"I hope I did not disappoint you.\" \"You could never disappoint me, Jane,\" Tom answered. \"Besides, I promise you will get plenty of training...\" The sentences was silenced with a kiss from Jane. \"I am counting on it.\" -TBC- Author's note: I am not entirely ready to let this story go. So I'm giving it another chapter. Hope You approve of the wedding night. It was surprisingly hard to write! Anyway, please review![Chapter 45] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again. They begin questioning their actions and choices in the past (i.e from the time they met in 1795 and forward).This is what could have happened if the movie had not ended. Disclaimer: I do not own Jane Austen, Tom Lefroy or any other character in this story. Facts are taken from the Becoming Jane Fansite. Author's note: Have absolutely no explanation for the delay, more than I really don't want the story to end. But here it is. Enjoy! Part 45: In which they Experience the Miracle of Life Jane woke up with a delicious feeling of contentment early the next morning. She had not felt so completely calm and care free for a very long time. She thought she would have felt different. So much had change in the last 24 hours. She was no longer in danger of dying an old maid, but a married woman. The epithet 'maid' did most definitely not apply to her anymore. She felt herself colour as she thought back on the night. She stretched languidly and sighed contently. She turned to the man who was still sound asleep next to her. Tom looked as relaxed as Jane felt. Even in his sleep there was a slight smile on his lips. During the course of the night Jane had learned what pleasures could be had in a bedchamber. She felt herself grow hot from the memory. She blushed to think that he now knew every little bit of her body. To her surprise she found that she had been worrying over nothing. Sure she was a bit sore, but that was all. The pleasure had over shone it all. Every thing had been perfect and Tom was a most gentle and attentive lover. Her heart fluttered at the thought of how he had proven again and again just how much he loved her. She brushed a lock of hair out of his handsome face and let her hand caress his warm cheek. He stirred slightly, and sighed in his sleep. She did not want to wake him just yet. She relished this sweet serenity that filled her. She lay down under the covers again, unwilling to face the world just yet. Jane snuggled close to Tom and kissed his bare shoulder before settling down beside him. -xxx- Jane was asleep when Tom woke. He looked down at her and smiled. She was his, completely and utterly, his. He moved closer and placed a kiss on her warm cheek. She stirred slightly and opened her eyes slowly. \"Good morning, Mrs Lefroy,\" he said. She smiled lazily. \"Morning,\" murmured she back. She draped an arm around him as she turned to her side, and moved closer to him. Amused he watched as her face coloured deeply as she met his gaze. She hit her burning face against his chest. \"Embarrassed, are we?\" he teased and forced her chin up with one finger. Her colour deepened, but she did not say anything. He kissed her hot cheeks on both sides, her nose, her jaw, both corners of her moth before he finally let his lips settle down on her lips. While his mouth was on her mouth, his hands were exploring her body. And soon they were too busy for light morning conversation. September 1815 The months had flown away in rapid speed. Jane's life was beginning to turn back to normal. Not much had changed, really. She enjoyed calling herself Mrs Lefroy more than anything. She and Tom were still acting as teenagers and she loved it. She had not slept alone once since their wedding night. They had had a blissful couple of months after the wedding. They were as happy as two newly weds could ever be and had only eyes for each other. They been to visit Eliza and Henry, a couple of weeks with Mrs Bennet and Cassandra and now they had just gotten back from a short stay in London. It was late September when she began to feel ill. It had started as a constant tiredness and feeling under the weather for no obvious reason. Nausea followed and soon light-headedness and even fainting spells. She could not understand what it was, but did not want to trouble any one with her condition. Jane was sure it would go away with a bit of rest. But when Mrs Phelps caught her emptying her stomach outside the kitchen door one morning before breakfast she could not keep it quiet any more and the doctor was sent for. Tom was away on business that day and for that Jane was thankful. She did not want to worry him. Mr Johnston examined her and asked her a various questions. \"Are you sleeping well?\" \"Yes.\" \"Any strange dreams?\" \"Not that I can recall,\" replied Jane and wondered where these questions were leading. \"Apart from this nausea, is there anything else that ails you? Fainting? Sudden cravings?\" \"Well, yes. I have been feeling quite fatigued lately and faint.\" \"I see. And how long since your last period?\" Jane started at the intimate question, but started to count backwards. She had not been bothered with that for some time. Not since before the wedding, come to think of it. Jane had thought it was just that time. \"I do not remember.\" Mr Johnston squeezed her belly a little and nodded. \"Here is what I think, Mrs Lefroy,\" said Mr Johnston with a smile. \"I believe that you are with child.\" Jane's mouth fell open. \"At my age? I thought…\" \"It is perhaps uncommon, but not impossible,\" he said. \"You will have to start thinking of what you are eating.\" \"Of course,\" Jane gushed. She was flabbergasted. The one thing she had dreamed of more than being Tom's wife, was to be blessed with a child. \"I will ask the midwife to call on you shortly Mrs Lefroy,\" the physician said. Jane could only nod in response. She did not know what to say. She could not wait for Tom to get home. Tears trickled down her cheeks as she smiled toward the physician as he patted her on the shoulder. \"And do remember to rest and eat properly and most of all, regularly. It will ease the nausea.\" \"Thank you, Mr Johnston.\" Jane was left to herself and was for a moment sitting perfectly still, unable to stir, incredulous and baffled. She opened her mouth and closed it without a sound getting out. Then she got up and was suddenly able to be still for a second more. She tidied up the room and nipped the dead petals of the roses that were on her night stand, she smoothed out the cover of the bed and then sat down again, quite overcome by her condition. She smiled and put a hand on her still flat belly and wondered what Tom and the rest of the family would say. Jane knew she would not be able to keep it a secret for any length of time. At least not from Tom. Jane hurried down to Mrs Phelps to order Tom's favourite dishes for dinner. The other woman looked a bit surprised to see her, but had the decency not to ask questions though she allowed a knowing smile to play on her lips. Jane guessed that for someone who had bore four children, the signs were obvious, but she did not say anything. -xxx- Tom came home to a set table and excited wife. Jane was practically glowing. \"You are looking lovely this evening, my love,\" he commented as he kissed her flushed cheek. \"Thank you,\" she mumbled as she led him to his seat. Then he realised that the table was only set for the two of them. As she noticed his puzzled look she quickly said: \"The children have already eaten. I wanted us to be alone.\" \"I see,\" replied he and held out the chair for her. \"Any particular reason?\" \"There is something I want to tell you.\" Tom's interest was peaked and he wondered what it could be. Jane only smiled mysteriously when he urged her on with an encouraging smile. Mrs Phelps came in with a tray of food and interrupted any chance of intercourse. They remained silent as their plates and cups were filled. Tom studied his wife for a while. He noted that she looked, apart from happy, a little paler than usual. Even a little bit tired, which she usually never did. A slight pang of worry made his stomach lurch uneasily. The radiant smile she shot his way after Mrs Phelps had gone pushed the worry aside. \"So, what is this secret you are holding from me, dear?\" he asked as soon as Mrs Phelps was out of the room. Jane took her time to take a sip from her cup, not meeting his queering eyes. \"Jane?\" His voice became demanding. \"I had the most wonderful news today,\" she finally said, and met his gaze. Her face was even more glowing with uncontained joy. \"Then do enlighten me, my dearest,\" he commanded lightly. \"I am getting old here.\" She giggled at his remark. \"I do hope you do not feel too old to hear the pitter patter of tiny feet in a quite near future,\" she said and her smile broadened. Tom's mouth fell open as the meaning of the sentence sunk in. He half rose, then sat down again, awed and unable to speak. \"Say something,\" she urged, uncertain as how to decipher his reaction. He looked up and met her eyes, his were watering with happiness. \"Are you sure?\" He rose again and threw himself down at her feet, taking her hands in his. \"Yes, I am sure. As sure as Mr Johnston,\" said she smiling down at him. He caressed her belly, softly murmuring words of surprise and joy. \"I would never...\" he said, looking up again. \"I would not have dreamed of such a blessing for us.\" \"Me neither,\" she said, stroking his head softly. \"I thought I was too old.\" \"When...?\" asked he and tried to measure by the size of the little bulge that was her belly. \"If my calculations are correct, sometime in April,\" said she. He smiled up at her. \"Are not we the blessed ones?\" \"We truly are,\" smiled she back, unable to hinder the tears that filled her eyes from spilling over and flood down her cheeks. The food was forgotten and they sat in the same position until Mrs Phelps came back to clear the table and bring in dessert. \"I believe congratulations are in order, sir, ma'am,\" said she with a knowing smile. \"You told her, before telling me?\" Tom looked incredulous at his wife. \"She guessed,\" said Jane calmly. \"I guess when you have four children of your own, the signs are not as hard to read. Besides, she was the one who sent for Mr Johnston when I was ill this morning.\" Tom smiled. \"How blind I have been,\" he exclaimed, voice thick with emotion. He knew she had been feeling a bit under the weather, but could never have dreamed that pregnancy would be the cause of it. Jane was not one to complain either. \"I have tried to keep it a secret. I did not want you to worry too much about me, when nothing really seemed wrong. Only fatigued and a bit nauseous, nothing really to worry about.\" \"I always worry about you, love,\" said Tom and rose to place a soft kiss on her lips. \"Now, let us get some food into you, you need nourishment.\" He smiled widely and led her to her seat again. -xxx- Jane took to pregnancy with ease, after October was over, the nausea did not trouble her as much any longer. Tom made sure there were biscuits or bread by her bedside as soon as she woke up. Having fathered six children he knew what pregnant women wanted and needed. He tried to be away from home as little as humanly possible for a man in the middle of his career. When he was gone, Millie was stationed to care for her mistress and to be on her beck and call. Jane protested to this kind of treatment. She was not ill, only with child. Women had bore children since the beginning of time, so she was not the first, though Tom treated her like she was a fragile little china doll. When he was home he watched her like a hawk, when he was away Mrs Phelps and Millie was his hawk eyes. Luckily enough they were not as stern as her husband. But when she shew even the smallest sign of fatigue she was sent to bed immediately. Basically she was spoiled rotten and did not need to lift a finger unless she really wanted to. Which she did of course. She hated being useless and tried to help out as much as she could manage. The Lefroy children took to the new child with various amount of joy. Mrs Bennet was overjoyed, Cassandra happy, Mr Lefroy took the news calmly, but then again he already had a bunch of grandchildren. Everyone came with advice and presents from time to time. -xxx- Winter came and Christmas and New Years with it. They gathered friends and family at Carrigglas and it was a very merry Christmas holiday for all. Tom gave Jane a redecorated nursery for her Christmas gift and she was overjoyed. April could not come soon enough. Spring brought warmth and sun to Carrigglas and the manor was filled with anxious anticipation for the new baby. March seemed to drag itself by and Jane was not minding to be still most days anymore. She felt large and heavy and in the way. A burden of sorts, though everyone did everything to make it easier for her and assured her that it was no problem at all. Tom was more of a mother hen by this time and did everything to make his wife feel at ease. Rubbing her feet, rubbing her back, caressing her belly, singing soft songs for the baby and being close by at all times. When April at last came Jane was more impatient than ever. She wanted the baby out. She was tired of feeling in the way, of feel fat, of feeling fatigued and out of breath. One week before her due date she decided it was time for this baby to enter the world and she set out to do anything to make labour start. Everyone kept saying that babies came when they were ready, you could not rush them, but Jane Austen was going to prove them wrong. \"Will you join me for a walk, dear?\" she asked Tom at the breakfast table one particularly fine morning. \"Should you not be still?\" he raised an eyebrow. \"I cannot stand it,\" cried she. \"I cannot take this any longer. I want this baby out!\" She sighed exasperatedly, trying to make him see. \"You know what Mr Johnston said about exertion,\" Tom reminded her. -xxx- Tom could in a way understand Jane's impatience, and did what he could to indulge her. But going out on a walk so late in her pregnancy was out of the question. He did not want her farther than 50 yards from the house. \"Please,\" she said and looked at him with begging eyes. \"Very well then,\" he gave in. \"But only as far as the orchard, you hear?\" \"Fine,\" she concurred sourly and went to fetch her shawl. Tom took her under the arm and they went out into the sun. He took care not to walk too fast and they strolled through the garden in a slow and waddling pace. \"Are you sure this is wise?\" asked Tom as he heard her strained breath. He put one arm around her back for even more support and took her hand in his. \"I am fine,\" she said through gritted teeth. \"I am just very, very pregnant.\" Tom chortled. \"How very true, my dear. And you have never looked better, might I add.\" Jane snorted in response. \"How come I do not believe you?\" Tom inspected her flushed cheeks, swelling belly and overall figure. \"You are positively blooming, my dear. Mind you,\" said he as she opened her mouth to protest, \"Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.\" They finally made their way to the orchard. Tom led Jane to the bench in front of the water feature and she sank down, thankful to be off her feet. \"This is nice,\" said she and gazed out of the greenery. She took of her shoes and let her feet be free. She wriggled them and smiled in pleasure. \"I think this is just what the doctor ordered.\" -xxx- Twelve hours later, Mary Cassandra took her first breaths in life, howling at the harsh cold world outside her mother's womb. The proud father rushed to his wife's side as soon as he was permitted and they cried together as the little bundle of joy, comfortably nestled into a blanket was laid to her mother's breast and fell asleep. Jane, though exhausted, was completely overjoyed. She could not control the tears that seemed flood in a never ending stream down her cheeks. She smiled widely through the tears. Mary was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. She was perfect in her littleness. Little cute feet and hands, and perfect little face with downy hair. Jane could not stop looking at the little miracle of life, feeling that life was totally and utterly complete. -The End- Author's note: I will post another chapter with my thanks shortly.[Chapter 46] I Remember Love A Becoming Jane -story By: jakeline Summary: The story begins after the opera, the year is 1814, Jane and Tom have met again. They begin questioning their actions and choices in the past (i.e from the time they met in 1795 and forward).This is what could have happened if the movie had not ended. Disclaimer: I do not own Jane Austen, Tom Lefroy or any other character in this story. Facts are taken from the Becoming Jane Fansite. One last Author's Note I want to thank you all that have stayed with me for all this time. It's been years, people! I have given birth to one son during this time, and am now pregnant with my second child. It's crazy, really. I'm really thankful for all the encouragement you have given me, your kind words on the way. Urging me to write more than I had planned to. And now it is over. Finished. It's kind of sad. It's like my baby has left me. I don't know what I will do now. I do have one modern version on Becoming Jane, but it's not even near completion. Would you be interested in that? Last but not least, I want to thank the ladies of the Becoming Jane Fansite. Without them I don't think this story had ever seen the light of day. Once again, thank you for reading!
