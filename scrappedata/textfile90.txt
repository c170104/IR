How has it already been two years since me and Aurora got married? I hardly believe it, yet, me being awake at all before the year of 2136 and the weight of the metal that I had twisted around my left ring finger proves that it's not a dream. Jim Preston is a married man and gets to wake up every single day to the lovely Aurora Preston, once known as Aurora Lane. Still can't wrap my head around it. Then again, it took us a long time to wrap each other's heads around ourselves. Especially after what I did to her in the first place. I don't deserve this, but I'm so thankful for the fact that she's here. Almost 4 years ago, I was so alone. I wanted to die. She gave me the something back I needed. Some sort of… Jim looked up as the Avalon suddenly swayed violently, almost making him throw up his breakfast. It was a perfectly good breakfast too. Aurora had made it instead of the robot. Thankfully, after a moment, his stomach and the ship both seemed to remain intact and so, with a careful eye having gone wandering around the room for any sign of impending doom and damage (they had to be careful thanks to almost blowing up and freezing to death in space since they were awaken. Well, really him, as he'd woke her more like), he looked back down again, the typewriter which he had borrowed from his wife tapping away like his fingers. Some sort of...spark. Something I needed to help me continue on. There are some days I doubt she doesn't think about what I did to her, however, despite what she's done for me all this time. For the first few weeks of our life after we fixed the ship, she would have such awful nightmares and I always knew I was the cause of the terror she felt. The way she looked at me sometimes was like I just wanted to take her place. They've calmed over the last year or so, hopefully they'll never come back again. Jim turned to hear the sound of the lock just as he tapped out his last word and smiled as his blonde haired beauty gestured to him, two cups of coffee in hand. So, I guess you could say, despite everything that's been happening or happen, that me and Aurora have quite the good life. I wouldn't change a thing. Chucking, Jim took his paper out of her typewriter, knowing she would have done it anyway later on and quietly made his way over to Aurora, a wry smile on his face as he latched onto a coffee mug, visibly groaning in relief (followed by Aurora's laughter) as the bean juice flowed those his veins and jump started his brain, making him snort. \"Hey, I can't help it. It's before 10:00 AM. Sue me.\" He grumbled, chuckling grin however still visible as Aurora snorted right back, shaking her head. \"Sometimes, I really want to ask you what happened when you were alone with the coffee machine, but then I don't because I'm afraid to know the answer.\" Jim's grin turned dirty. \"Welllll-\" \"UGH, no. Don't even...,thank god I clean the damn thing every day.\" Jim just laughed, wrapping an arm around her gently. \"Yeah, thank god you do. That and a whole lot more.\" He managed to kiss her cheek before she rolled her eyes and shoved him, unlooping his arm and ducking underneath it. \"God, you are so cheesy.\" She lent up to kiss him on the nose, looking up at him. \"But not so cheesy as to going downstairs to find me some water for the communal tree.\" Jim groaned again, this time in a whiny way. It wasn't that he hadn't been forgetting on purpose to go down 3 floors to the water reclaimer in the plant room, ti was just a tricky fix, lugging water containers in and out of the elevator. More often than not, he ended up soaking wet in the space (ha, space) of an hour and had to take a shower and get changed. Usually, for a man like himself, that wasn't a bad thing, but given Aurora hated him tracking water though the ship and in their bedroom, he was forced to change out in the grand concourse where the tree was, in front of /every/ possible security camera this ship most likely owned. (well, okay, it wasn't /every/ camera, but the security tapes were sure to be a hit with the Avalon's crew when they resumed consciousness in 86 years) \"Do I have to? Can't the old damn thing wait another day?\" Aurora smacked his arm in response, reaffirming what he had feared. \"Fine, fine!\" He threw his arms up in mock surrender. \"I'm going, I\"m going.\" \"3 containers, Jim and don't you forget!\" He heard Aurora say to his retreating back as he headed for the elevator. \"I won't. Promise.\" He didn't know at that time, but later on, he would soon be regretting those exact words. ","Summary":" Friday, 26.02.2048 Two years.

The thought had crossed her mind as early as Earth. The idea that she'd enter stasis and never wake up. That she'd drown, or asphyxiate, or the ship would fly into a supernova, or anything else from the annals of science fiction. It had entered her mind in the same way that the thought of crashing came up whenever she'd boarded a plane back on Earth. Never mind that planes had been around for centuries and were the safest form of travel out there, she couldn't shake the apprehension that something was going to happen to her. That she was on a moving vehicle with no control over the outcome. And now, instead of a plane traveling over the speed of sound, she, Aurora Dunn, good ol' girl out of Queens and aspiring writer, was on a starship moving at 20% of the speed of light, dispatched from Earth 31 years ago on a colonization mission to Homestead Colony. Thanks to an accident one year ago, she and one other passenger on this flying coffin had been let out of stasis early, with no way to reactivate their pods. After a year of bickering, tinkering, and cutting into the ship's stores, it had become clear that while Jim Preston was a skilled mechanic, the intricacies of cryogenic hibernation was beyond him. That they'd been released from the womb early, and mummy wasn't letting them back in. I'm going to die. So she sat here on the bridge, looking out into the darkness of space as she mulled the thought, now a certainty, over. It only part of the ship that had any windows – the passengers and crew would be in stasis for the majority of the trip, they weren't going to want to see the view. And, as she looked out into the entropy that was the inter-system gulf between the stars of the Orion Arm, she thought that maybe a supernova wasn't such a bad idea right now. At least it would give her something to look at. \"Hey.\" She didn't even glance at Jim as he walked onto the bridge, holding a bottle of water in one hand, and a MRE in the other. The food on the ship was designed to be held for over a century, not satiate the taste buds. And the company…She kept staring out into the dark. Living with only one person for a year, and faced with that prospect for the rest of her life…what else was there to say. \"View's good.\" She kept staring, even as he made his way to the bridge's microwave. She didn't know why a bridge had a microwave, but there wasn't any mess hall on this damn boat. She could deal with the non-existent smell of space food being cooked. At least, unlike a few centuries ago, there was actual gravity. \"Tell me,\" Aurora murmured. \"Do you think that when we die, and the colonists find our cold dead bodies, they'll care that we ate into their supplies?\" Jim glanced at her. \"We're not going to die.\" She snorted. \"Right. Sure. We're going to live for the next eighty-plus years as our air runs out.\" \"The ship's life support systems will keep us alive.\" \"Right, of course.\" She sighed. \"Course we're using up heat, among other things. Do you think our corpses will smell? I hear cryo is a good way to preserve the dead.\" The microwave door slammed shut. She watched Jim as he sat on an adjacent seat, water in one hand, baked beans in a tray in the other. \"What do you want from me?\" he asked. \"A solution might be nice.\" \"I'm working on it.\" \"For a year. I think we're a bit beyond 'working on it.'\" Jim didn't say anything. He just sat there, eating. And Aurora pondered over the questions in her mind. The questions that neither of them wanted to face. Right now, death was a certainty. How or when they died was another issue. Because the ship was designed to be in low power mode throughout its trip, meant to provide over 5000 people with heat, air, and sustenance in the beginning and ending of their trip. Not keep two humans alive for decades on end. Aurora could guess that the food and water might be able to sustain them. But the heat and air, not so much. And even then, they had to face the possibility that they might have to shut the systems down themselves. They'd activated automatically when their pods had opened. Now they were cutting into the energy that would be needed for the 5,257 other passengers. How many of them would have to die so they could live a little longer? So she kept staring as Jim ate in silence. Even after he asked her whether she wanted anything, she shook her head and kept her gaze fixed on the starless sky. She wasn't hungry. And right now, she wasn't in the mood to feed a body that would never walk on a planet again. \"So…\" Jim ventured eventually. \"You up for a game tonight?\" \"Tonight,\" Aurora murmured. \"Huh.\" \"Huh?\" \"Oh, you know, 'tonight,'\" she mocked. \"I mean, we're in space, aren't we? Do you think night and day mean anything.\" \"I'm just going by the ship's clock.\" \"Sure.\" She let out a laugh. \"Don't you think it should count backwards I mean, should we agree beforehand when we pop off and-\" Jim got up and began to walk away. \"There's no stars,\" she called out. \"No stars, no suns, no aliens, or comets, or anything.\" She got up as well and gestured to one of the windows. \"There's nothing. Nothing!\" Jim stood at the exit to the bridge, his shoulders sagged, his arms low. Slowly, he looked at her. His eyes met hers. The eyes of a man who knew he was doomed to die. A man who would die in company or alone, and would go unmourned and unremembered by the people of two worlds. \"My name's Aurora,\" she murmured. She sighed, and took a seat. \"I thought, I'd go into space. Write a book on space travel. See the aurora of an alien world.\" She looked up at Jim. \"Now I can't even see the stars.\" Jim didn't say anything. He turned around and walked out. And Aurora couldn't blame him. They were in the same position. They were doomed either way. And after a year, they had said everything that needed to be said. So once more she turned to the windows of the bridge, as the universe, in its emptiness, rushed by her. The universe, in its entropy, in its darkness, in its callousness, looked upon her. And laughed. ","Summary":" For Here There Are No Stars I'm going to die on this ship.

Finally the ship's crew has called an all-passenger meeting to give us information on what has been happening around here. People are gathered in small groups, heads bowed, talking in hushed tones. From the snippets of conversation I can over-hear, people are scared and they want answers. The only thing on my mind is finding my father. I look to my right to my mother and see her worn face and red puffy eyes. I've never seen her look so tired, even when I was a kid. \"He's got to be here mum don't worry, this is everyone on the ship.\" \"If he were here Blake, he would have found us by now. It's been three days.\" \"Look mum, we'll find him, ok.\" The speaker system lets out a piercing screech which abruptly stops. The whole concourse is silent. Everyone looks up to the main balcony where there are a group of about 20 crew members in full uniform. I try to scan their faces as they are far away, but none of them are dad. Where is he? One woman steps forward. She's wearing the recognisable navy blue uniform of the Avalon as are the rest of the crew but hers has gold buttons and a gold stripe around the peaked navy blue hat. It reminds Blake of the uniforms he saw in books in school when they did a project on the civil war. He pushes those thoughts away quickly; he needs to listen carefully to what the captain has to say. How can she possibly explain this jungle that has appeared while all the passengers have been in hyper sleep for 120 years? \"Good afternoon passengers of the Avalon. My name is Kate Duchard and as your captain I would like to officially welcome you aboard this Homestead luxury liner. Congratulations on choosing Homestead 2 for you and your family's future. Room to breathe, room to grow.\" She looks flustered as she hands the grey pamphlet she's holding to a crew member seated on her right. She removes her hat and running her hand through her short brown hair, blows air out of her cheeks and approaches the microphone again. This can't be good news. \"As I'm sure you are all aware, certain unexpected events have occurred during our time in hyper sleep. The crew and I, please remember, have also been in hyper sleep for only a month less than each of you. Do not mistake me, I do not wish to cause alarm, that would be the least effective thing I could do right now as commander in chief of this vessel, however, I do feel it is my professional duty and moreover my moral duty to be transparent about what we are dealing with here. The ship has suffered some malformations while we have been asleep...\" Loud gasps arise from varying places in the crowd. People are talking and shouting until the noise level has risen to a point that it seems this whole meeting is about to descend into chaos. I look to my mother. She suddenly looks all too frail and weak. She looks back at me in despair her sharp brown eyes filling up with tears. I've never seen her like this before. \"It's ok mum we will find out what's going on.\" Her small shoulders drop another few inches as she sighs and continues looking up at Captain Duchard. \"Order please, order.\" Kate continues. \"As you are no doubt aware it seems we have had some stowaways on board the Avalon. Nobody yet knows how or why this has happened but be reassured we are looking into it. I want to ease any concerns you have about the new flora and fauna you will have encountered around the ship...\" she waves a hand behind her to the enormous beech tree sprawling gloriously across the lower third of the concourse level. \"The natural environment is actually a great asset to us as we continue on the last part of our journey on board the Avalon. It is increasing oxygen levels and the plants are metabolising trace toxins in the air. We will be organising a team to care for it, if you have experience in this field you will find your original skills training has been repurposed to this task.\" The floor judders under our feet and a creaking noise comes from the right side of the concourse. This has happened about three times a day since I've been awake. There's nothing more jarring than the feeling of being stranded on a sinking ship. \"It seems the ship is still suffering some very minor altercations. We as your crew are checking the ship's log and continuously running diagnostics. Now we have already fixed quite a lot of the problem but as you can imagine trawling through 120 years of recorded files is quite a task, and one we didn't envisage would be on crew itinerary. Please be patient, look out for one another and comply with all things asked of you by me or my crew members and in this way we will all get to Homestead 2 on schedule, and together. We have been going through the passenger profile records and I will be sending some crew members out this afternoon to speak to some of you individually. These are personal matters so if you see your neighbour receive a visit but you do not, do not worry. We are in unprecedented waters here, nothing like this has ever happened since the advent of long haul space travel and I truly hope you all can get alongside me in doing choosing the best actions for all of us as a group. We are part of the next generation for Homestead 2 and I'm going to get us there safely. Thank you.\" The captain, putting her hat back on firmly, almost marches around the corner on the balcony and out of sight. The crew begin to pack up the chairs and follow in the same direction. On the main level the atmosphere is subdued. As the concerned voices blur in to one loud background noise I say nothing and leave my mother and turn the way I came to go back to the hospital bay. I remember wanting to be a nurse as young as twelve years old. I remember playing in my cousin's garden in Brighton; a long lawned garden with that distinctive sea smell on the air. We were playing on the swing at the end of her garden, my mum and auntie watching on through the glass patio doors, drinking tea as I pushed my little cousin Genevive on the swing feeling impatient for my turn but equally aware of being watched by my mother. We were singing a French nursery rhyme we had been taught from babies by our great grandmother when Genny suddenly fell forward and off the swing to the ground with a great thud. I screamed for my mum as I rushed to help her. I didn't know what to do; Genny was having a fit. Her whole body shook, little bony elbows jutting out. I could see my mother and auntie running as if in slow motion from the house towards us, my auntie screaming out as she threw her mug across the garden. It was the first of many fits for my cousin. I felt a helplessness I had never felt before. That was the day I decided I wanted to spend my life helping other people and as soon as I left high school I applied for my nursing training and graduated with a first last year. That combined with the fact that dad is a flight deck attendant and landed a job when they were recruiting for this voyage meant it seemed a perfect opportunity for us. The hospital deck is usually one of the quietest sections of any space vessel. As with the emergency capsule pods, it's more of an essential safety net than anything else. With all the passengers aboard this ship being in hyper sleep for the majority of the voyage, this 4 month post was meant to ease me into my first taste of the professional nursing world. But now I don't think it's going to be that simple. I reported to the hospital bay for my first shift. The sterile non-smell comforts me, after four years of training in hospitals I feel I know where I am. I notice the walls are flanked with the very latest machines and equipment, no expense has been spared. I begin to realise that each one is probably very outdated by now already. That thought rustles around in my mind for a few seconds until I see the small group of doctors, nurses and Avalon staff at the other end of the long, wide room who are in a small crowd around something. The room is low lit; everyone is reporting for their first day of duty there shouldn't be much else going on today. I draw nearer and see they are all silently looking down at an autodoc; a diagnostic pod that replaced a ton of honest manual labour back on earth. As I draw nearer I can see why; there is someone inside it. No-one says anything as I reach forward and touch the glass. She's beautiful, just lying there blissfully unaware in hyper sleep almost like a modern day fair haired sleeping beauty. I break the silence with the question \"Who is she?\" ","Summary":" A large crowd is gathering in the main concourse.

Due to a malfunction that happened right as the ship went through the meteor field, but I was still waking up from hibernation before that happened. As I was being awakened by the hologram, everything stalled for a moment. A loud crash ripped through the ship, but then the systems worked properly again. I wasn't really paying any attention to it, as I was groggy from having been asleep for who knows how long. My systems were still rebooting. So whatever that crash was, it was nothing to worry about. Or so I thought. I woke and that was when I realized no one else was awake. At first that didn't worry me. Slowly I discovered I was the only one awake. At first the three days I spent alone on an entire ship seemed perfect for an introvert like myself. That was until I discovered I'd be alone for the rest of my life, with no one to talk to about anything. We were still 90 years from Homestead 2. That realization felt like the whole world was dropped on my shoulders. I'd never be able to talk to anyone again. I felt hollow. Looking out the window of the ship, and watching the rest of the Avalon spin around it, I wondered how doomed my future was. What was I going to do all by myself on this ship for 90-something years? That and I was purely just a passenger on board to help populate Homestead 2. I dreamed about seeing that planet. Now my hopes were crushed. I'd never reach it. I was studying the other Hibernation pods in the dark of the Hibernation room, studying the other passengers. No other pods had malfunctions. Why was mine the first to go off? Would others be next? Was that even possible? I tried going back to sleep, but nothing worked. My Hibernation pod was the last one. Then, I heard another hibernation pod open up and the hologram guide the passenger through the waking process, something I had been through a few days ago. My heart leapt out of my chest, but I stayed in the shadows. Finding out through the Hologram, I learned that the passenger was Jim Preston, a mechanic. Maybe I wasn't going to be the only one awake, and I let out a quiet sigh. Maybe the others were just a little… late, that was all. But 7 days after Jim woke, and I stayed hidden as he tried to look for others, it was clear no one else was waking up. For about a month of secrecy, I gave up. My days of solitude were over. I needed to talk to someone – about anything. I was starting to talk to myself. I had already explored all of the ship. While not exploring, I read, drew, swam in the pools. So I went down to the bar one night and Jim walked in and nearly jumped out of his shoes. \"W-what?\" he asked, \"You're awake too?\" I turned around and said, \"Hi. Yeah, I've been awake… longer than you have, actually. I was there when you woke up.\" \"What do you mean? How is this possible? You're telling me that you woke me up?\" \"No, no way. My hibernation pod malfunctioned a few days before yours did. I didn't want to… well, I thought being by myself for a while would do me some good. But 90 years? For an introvert that's way too much time. I need some kind of human interaction or I'll start to feel cold. I mean, I feel cold right now.\" Jim sat down at the bar and got a drink. \"And you didn't want to tell me. I've been alone for an entire month. Or, well… thinking I've been alone for an entire month.\" \"Well so have I, kind of.\" I pointed out. He glared at me. \"I'm sorry. I still can't believe you woke up first. Do you know why you woke up before me?\" \"No.\" I said, shaking my head. \"Tell me what you mean about feeling cold.\" I was worried he wouldn't understand. I scratched my head before I tried to explain myself. \"In the simplest of terms, I'm lonely. I… I wanted to go to Homestead 2. But now, I have no one, and no home.\" He nodded. \"I feel the same way.\" he said. He stared at me, and I stared at him softly, half paying attention to my drink. \"What?\" I asked. \"N-nothing. Still trying to wrap my head around this. Maybe we should give each other some space.\" I laughed. \"Come on. Let's go do something together on this ship. I haven't done anything besides swimming because I didn't want you to find out I was here.\" \"Wait, there's a pool?\" We went to the pool. After that, we played various games, all the games that were available. We had dinner at a luxurious restaurant. It was a very enjoyable evening. At the end of it, my head was swimming with thoughts and I needed some time to sort them all out. I stayed away from Jim for a few days. Until we met up at the bar again on the fourth day, purely on accident. But it made me happy to see Jim. I invited him to sit down next to me. \"Hey. I had fun last time. Is something wrong?\" \"No. I just needed some time to myself. It's nothing personal. It's been so long since I've been with someone.\" \"Well it looks like we have 90 years to ourselves.\" \"Yeah…\" We sat in the viewing deck and talked long hours about anything and everything. Eventually we were sitting next to each other so close we were touching, and watching the stars pass by. \"It's so nice to talk and to be with someone again.\" Jim said. I nodded. Nice was an understatement. \"I don't want to feel alone anymore.\" I said. We were looking at each other instead of the stars. Jim said, \"Neither do I.\" The End ","Summary":" There was one other person up days before Jim Preston woke up on the Starship Avalon.

But the more I read about the internet's reaction to it (particularly the SJW community), the more I realize how squicky it was. Aurora really had no choice about anything, and that's awful. The worst part is that I walked into that movie not realizing that Jim was actually going to wake Aurora, and I was really confused when they didn't run into each other immediately. So, I wanted to write the romance I thought I was going to get. I'll only be writing the first year, partly because I figure the climax plays out the same whether they're feuding or still in love, and partly because I don't want to touch the \"we're stuck here for the rest of our lives what are we going to do\" with a ten-foot pole. Note: I live in Colorado, so we're going to hear more about Jim's hometown because I said so. Further note: does anyone remember what Aurora's dad's name is? Because I don't. I totally borrowed Jim Kirk's middle name. Jim doesn't see her until after his empty orientation. He's the only human he's seen since his revival, and the ship's assorted virtual people aren't helping him at all. He hopes the computer has mistaken him as crew. He hopes the crew are all in another part of the ship, recovering from their own hibernation and getting the ship ready for passengers like him to revive in another month. This image of a room full of people who will know more about his situation than he does is the only thing keeping him calm. He's tempted to run throughout the ship—his footsteps echo through the hallways—but he keeps himself at an even pace. As he reaches the mess hall, he stops walking. The footsteps continue to echo. \"Hello?\" he calls. \"Hello?\" A female voice calls back. Despite all of his earlier self-reassurances, Jim breaks into a sprint. He stops a few table lengths away from a woman. She has chin-cut blonde hair and a smart-looking black jacket with a low-cut tank top underneath. She has a cool jacket too, he thinks to himself—the same thing he told himself this morning. His breath catches when he meets her eyes. \"Are you crew?\" she asks him, stepping into the distance between them. \"I was about to ask you the same thing,\" says Jim. Up close, her eyes are blue and even more piercing than he expected. She examines him with the same emotions he's been grappling with: relief, confusion, anticipation. Fear. \"The ship didn't wake up anyone else on my floor,\" she says. \"What about you?\" \"I was alone too. So you haven't seen anyone else?\" \"Just you.\" They examine each other. It's clear from their outfits that, dressed to impress as they are, they aren't anything but passengers. \"What track are you?\" he asks. \"I'm engineering.\" \"Lucky you,\" she says with a small, tilted smile. \"Discounted ticket. I'm a journalist, but apparently that doesn't count for anything on a new colony. So, no track. Aurora Lane,\" she says, offering her hand. Jim takes it. \"Jim Preston. I saw an elevator near my quarters,\" he says. \"We might be able to find a crew member at the center of the ship.\" They realize after a day of increasingly frantic searching that they're the only two on board who are awake. Jim arrives at the mess hall second, having broken into some crew areas that Aurora doesn't know how to access. Aurora looks up from her meal, some meat covered in brown sauce and with a side salad. Her arms are crossed and set on the table; she hasn't even picked up a fork. \"Any luck?\" she asks. \"I don't have access to the crew's quarters,\" says Jim, lowering his voice as he comes closer to her table beside the food generator. \"But from the looks of it, they're all asleep. Still.\" \"All of them?\" asks Aurora. She stands from the table. \"Even the captain?\" \"Far as I can tell.\" Jim looks Aurora up and down. \"I'm guessing you didn't find anyone either.\" \"Nobody,\" says Aurora. The statement is nearly a whisper. They examine each other for a moment. Jim can tell Aurora is trying to keep herself together, but the grip she has on the back of her chair shows how much of a strain it is. \"I can try to break into their quarters,\" he offers, feigning casualness as he steps up to the food generator to place his order. If he can keep calm, maybe she can too. \"I got access to the supply deck, and they have to have tools. Maybe even a blowtorch, if it comes down to it.\" He presses a button that resembles the meal Aurora got. The machine chirps. \"I'm sorry, this meal is available to Gold Star passengers only.\" He frowns and tries for another, something that looks like a frittata. The machine chirps its apologies again. He presses the third and fourth buttons, not even letting the machine make a full apology, until he finally reaches the last option and the machine gives him a sandwich on dry bread with thin turkey and nearly insubstantial lettuce. It doesn't ask if he wants mustard or chips, but it does leave him an apple. He takes his tray to Aurora's table and sits across from her. She looks first at his expression—deceptively casual again—and then at his tray. She lifts her tray with one hand and slides his to her place. She sets the tray of still-warm meat on Jim's side. \"Next time,\" she says, \"I'm buying for both of us.\" She picks up the apple. \"You sure about that?\" asks Jim, eying the meal she's stolen from him. He's not especially hungry, but he has skipped lunch to run around a spaceship all day. \"I'm not very hungry,\" she says. She takes a bite and speaks again with her mouth partially full. \"And if you can actually break in there, you deserve the meal.\" \"They might wake up tomorrow,\" Jim points out. He cuts himself a piece of meat. Upon closer inspection, it's Salisbury steak. \"We could just be a day early.\" \"Let's hope.\" As he's trying to unscrew the bolts making up the crew's door, Aurora approaches Jim with a haunted expression. \"Jim,\" she says. Her trembling tone is the only signal he needs to set down his tools and follow her wordlessly down a series of hallways. \"I ignored this room because no one was inside,\" says Aurora as she leads him into a darkened room with a series of steps and a single window showing the stars, \"but it's an observatory.\" As if on cue, the observatory introduces itself, projects a holographic galaxy, and asks what they'd like to see. \"Show me Earth,\" says Aurora. The computer obeys. \"Now show me Homestead II,\" she says. Jim raises an eyebrow at her. He knows where they're going as well as she does. His stomach turns queasy at the thought that they might be off course. When the computer shows the second planet, she issues her last command. \"Now show our trajectory.\" In a deep voice, the computer explains the trajectory it's laying out. \"The Avalon is thirty years into its one-hundred-and-twenty-year voyage. We will approach Homestead II in ninety years.\" Jim stares at the projection. He's never seen a parabola that could fill him with such dread. He looks at Aurora, who has her hand over her mouth as if she's seeing this for the first time, as if she's seeing her death warrant. \"What do we do?\" she croaks. \"…We have to wake the crew,\" says Jim. He looks down at his shaking hands. \"But first I need a drink.\" Aurora leads him to Arthur, the robot—\"Android, technically,\" he corrects—who serves them their drinks. Jim never saw him because Aurora volunteered to look in this part of the ship, and he nearly has a heart attack when Aurora leads him to the first human face he's seen since her. They neglect dinner and drink far more than Arthur approves of, and Jim walks—or rather, stumbles—Aurora to her quarters. When she opens her door and Jim sees a corridor and a living room instead of a tiny bed, he whistles. \"Pricey ticket for three months of luxury, dontcha think?\" he asks. He's never been much of a slurrer, but he's close to it right now. \"Not three months anymore,\" says Aurora. \"Not unless you open those doors.\" She makes to pat him on the forearm but misses, and seems to consider that enough effort for one night. She walks into her suite and lets the door close behind her, leaving Jim with a racing mind that sobers in only a few seconds. Jim finds them two earpieces for communication the next morning, and then they divide their labor. Aurora, being the one better off financially, pays for a message to Earth soliciting help. Jim resumes working on breaking open the crew door. Aurora scours the medical center for information on the hibernation pods. Jim picks up more tools from the hold. Aurora checks that no one else has woken. Jim tries the blowtorch on the door. They take lunch separately—Jim feels guilty waiting for her to come down and pay for a better meal, and he expects she'll want some alone time—but they reconvene for dinner. \"The blowtorch doesn't work,\" he rants to Aurora. \"It's gotta be fireproof. Why the hell is it fireproof? Do they think one of us is going to try for mutiny?\" \"You can't just—\" Aurora makes an abstract gesture \"—hack into it?\" \"I'm an engineer,\" says Jim. \"I can make things and fix things, but hacking into computers is another thing.\" \"They can't be that different,\" says Aurora. \"Computers are just another thing that can be fixed.\" \"Look, I'll try something else tomorrow,\" says Jim. \"Maybe I'll try to find some manuals.\" \"Already done,\" says Aurora. \"I skimmed them over lunch. A lot of that stuff is too advanced for me, but maybe you'll find something I missed.\" Jim examines her. She's getting better at suppressing her fear, and part of him wonders if she's doing it to keep him calm. Just like he does for her. And he really does appreciate that she's been trying to help him, instead of leaving it to him and not even trying to understand what he's doing. \"Thanks,\" he says. He looks her in the eye. \"No problem.\" They eat quietly for a few minutes. The cleaning bots hum quietly nearby, waiting for one of them to drop a crumb. \"I've been thinking,\" she says suddenly. \"If we're going to be awake for…a while,\" she says, not willing to put a number to it, \"why don't you try for a better quarters?\" \"Hm?\" asks Jim. \"I mean…it never really occurred to me. Doesn't it belong to someone?\" \"Yeah, but…think of it this way. I'm in a giant empty spaceship with only one other person. And that one other person is on a completely different floor. What if something goes wrong? I don't think you sleep with this,\" she says, gesturing to the earpiece she's set on the table beside her tray. \"Oh, I get it,\" says Jim. It's the first time since he's been in hibernation that he's felt like teasing. \"You're scared of the dark.\" \"Not the dark ,\" says Aurora, scowling, \"or else I couldn't handle space. But what if there's a malfunction somewhere, and I can't get to you? Malfunctioning hibernation pods is a big problem, so what if—\" \"Maybe that'll be my project tomorrow,\" says Jim. He smiles. \"It'll be comfier to read manuals in a nicer quarters, anyway.\" \"With how much you drool over my suite? No kidding.\" \"Hey!\" Despite himself, Jim snorts. She's not wrong. The next day he breaks himself into the Vienna suite and lounges in the chairs in his new living room. Aurora joins him with all the manuals she's found so far and they spend the day ordering meals to his room, both of them leafing through the pages and Aurora reading him aloud passages she thinks might be useful. Half of them aren't, but he writes down the better ideas. Over the next week they refocus their efforts on opening the engine room doors so they can monitor life support and other ship functions. Once she finishes her morning jog and passenger checks, Aurora usually arrives to be Jim's assistant, handing him tools and reading aloud warnings or instructions from the manuals. \"You do get pretty greasy doing all this, don't you?\" asks Aurora as they leave for lunch. They've given up any pretense of wanting more alone time than they get at night. \"You would too,\" Jim points out. \"The ship is shiny, yeah, but even shiny things are just surfaces. They cover all the greasy parts that keep it running.\" \"'Shiny things are just surfaces,'\" Aurora echoes with a grin. \"An engineer and a poet. I like it.\" \"You would, journalist,\" says Jim. He nudges her into the wall of their hallway and refuses to budge when Aurora tries to nudge him back. \"I'm actually an author,\" she says as they enter the mess hall. \"I just put down 'journalist' so Homestead would think I'd write about how great they are. What do you want?\" Jim waves a hand apathetically, and Aurora orders him the same meal she's getting. \"So you've written books?\" he asks. \"Like, published them?\" \"A few collections of short stories so far,\" she says. \"Nothing near what my dad did.\" \"Well, can I read them?\" Aurora looks at him oddly as they sit down with their trays. \"You know, most people ask who my dad is.\" \"Oh. Uh, who's your dad then?\" \"Tiberius Lane.\" Jim nods. \"He's a Pulitzer Prize-winner.\" \"Oh, huh. No pressure.\" \"Right?\" Aurora laughs. Jim pauses. It's the first time he's ever heard her laugh. His heart picks up its pace. \"And what's even worse is that he wrote about me pretty often.\" \"Well you know I'm gonna have to read about that,\" he says, grinning. He's hoping she'll laugh again, and it works. He could do this for the rest of their meal. He could do this for the rest of the day. \"Seriously, though, how was that? Being written about?\" \"I mean, in some ways it was interesting. Maybe a bit more of myself than I wanted to know about, at times. But it also felt kind of strange. I mean, my dad had all of these stories. He took trips to Antarctica, he had lovers and enemies—and…\" \"And you didn't.\" \"No,\" she says. She takes a bite of her food. Jim considers this. \"Is that why you're going to Homestead II?\" he asks. \"For stories?\" \"Absolutely,\" she says, and the sincerity of her answer surprises Jim. \"My plan is to stay for a year, then to come back.\" \"Wait,\" says Jim. \"You have a round-trip ticket?\" He didn't know that was possible. \"Right.\" \"But then…you'll only have a year of stories.\" \"But I'll come back to Earth two hundred and thirty years later,\" says Aurora. \"I'll know it in two different eras, and I'll have Homestead II in between. No one else can tell that story. Only me.\" Jim nods. The smallest part of him thinks that this, their current situation, is a story no one else has either. Just him and her. Over the next month and a half, Jim reads first her work, then her father's. It takes him that long because (a) he spends most of his days with Aurora and/or working on the ship, and (b) he's not a bookish person. But for Aurora, he's willing to become one. \"She's good,\" he says to Arthur. He and Aurora have made a friendly agreement that they each have one day to have Arthur to themselves. He's part friend and part counselor, and Jim isn't sure which one he needs right now. \"How's that?\" asks Arthur. His gentlemanly charm comes to life in the lilt of his voice and the tilt of his head. \"She's funny,\" Jim explains. \"But she's also really good at making me imagine what she's talking about. I mean, I come from Denver, and I know it's not anything like New York. But the way she writes, I feel like I've been there. I've only seen pictures of the Empire State Building, but she makes me feel like I'm standing on the sidewalk and looking up at it. And Denver has trees, but only she can make me imagine the leaves changing in Central Park. She's really good.\" \"Have you told her so?\" asks Arthur. \"I'm not even sure she wants me reading it,\" says Jim. \"But she didn't say I couldn't.\" \"I imagine that's an invitation, then,\" says Arthur. \"I just…I don't know,\" says Jim. \"I want to talk to her more about it. But she usually ends up talking more about her dad. I think she wants to live up to him, get more life experiences and all that. And…how's she supposed to do that when she's on the same ship every day, with only me?\" Arthur sets down the glass he's been polishing. \"Forgive me if I'm ignoring some professional boundaries,\" he says, \"but I've heard it said that one person can be an entire universe. Perhaps,\" he intones when he sees Jim's raised eyebrow, \"she needs to hear more about your life. Perhaps then she'll trust you well enough that you can bring up such topics. At the very least, she'll see you as a compelling story.\" \"You think so?\" asks Jim. \"I'm not paid,\" says Arthur, \"being an android and everything. But if I were, I would bet my wages on it.\" \"Hey,\" says Jim before Aurora can turn them down the path to the mess hall, \"do you want to try something different tonight?\" \"What do you mean?\" she asks. \"I mean, there's a whole lido deck full of restaurants. And I kind of doubt those robots are going to deny us service because we're ordering food ninety years before we should.\" Aurora pauses, considering. \"I've been craving burritos,\" she concludes. Jim exhales with a smile—was he holding his breath?—and leads them down the hall. \"Can I ask you something?\" he says. \"Sure.\" \"Just—do you have any clothes that are actually good for a colony?\" \"I'm not sure what you mean,\" she says with a slight laugh. Good, she isn't offended just yet. \"I mean, that shirt doesn't look like it'd be useful if you were building a house,\" he says, nodding to her shirt that seems to be made of nothing but gold sequins. \"And I haven't seen you wear flannel yet or anything. Do you own any?\" \"First of all, buster,\" she says, and Jim laughs at the antiquated nickname, \"I figure I'll leave the house-building up to you. And second of all, if I'm only staying for a year, what does it matter?\" \"I'm not complaining,\" says Jim as they reach the elevator. \"But how are you going to survive winter?\" \"Figured I'd share body heat with someone.\" Jim flushes. \"Kidding,\" she says, grinning up at him. \"I've got a parka and some thermals. They're just not really useful on a spaceship.\" \"But the cleavage is,\" says Jim. He looks away innocently when Aurora shoots him a fake glare. \"I can show all the cleavage I want,\" she says. Jim wonders how close she is to actually being angry. \"Everyone in New York does it. And what, everyone in Denver wears flannel?\" Ah, finally they're reaching the topic Jim hoped to reach. Incidentally, they've also reached the lido deck, where Aurora spies the Mexican restaurant and leads the way. \"Well, some of us,\" says Jim. \"Mostly the guys. Since we were all so close to the mountains, everyone either liked to pretend they were just about to go skiing or they were in New York. So, fifty-fifty I guess.\" \"Mountains,\" says Aurora thoughtfully. \"So I guess you know all about roughing it. For Homestead II.\" \"You kidding?\" says Jim. \"I'm an engineer. I spent more time fixing Elitch's than I ever did in the mountains.\" \"Elitch's?\" \"Elitch Gardens. It's an amusement park, and my mom always took me there as a kid…\" Jim keeps talking after they're seated at their table by a robot waiter who introduces himself as Hector. He promised himself he'd go for maybe a childhood story or two—Arthur assured him even that much would paint him as trustworthy—but Aurora listens to him so intensely, as if she's putting everything he says to memory, and asks so many follow-up questions that Jim ends up talking for most of dinner and only stops when they revisit Arthur for a wink (for Jim) and a nightcap (for both of them). As he escorts her to her suite, he acknowledges the evening. \"Hey, sorry I spent so much time talking tonight. I didn't mean to—\" \"It's okay,\" says Aurora. \"It's nice. I like stories.\" \"Yeah, you mentioned. But I'm glad.\" Unsure of what to do with himself, he manages an awkward salute. \"Well, Miss Lane, thank you for accompanying me to dinner tonight.\" Aurora laughs. \"I do every night. But thanks, I had fun. We should do it again.\" \"What, get Mexican food?\" \"I saw a sushi place,\" she says with a daring look. \"Do you landlocked people have seafood?\" Jim rolls his eyes, but chuckles all the same. \"We do. But I'd be interested in trying to eat it in space.\" \"Well then,\" says Aurora, \"it's a date.\" She waves and lets the door close before Jim can figure out what she means by that. Months pass. Although Jim and Aurora do their best to relieve stress in the evenings, their days become increasingly worrying. Jim can't access anything restricted to crew, although he does have access to most of the ship's supplies. Their message to Earth won't be received for another thirty years, and every scrap of information about hibernation pods assures that they're flawless with no chance of malfunction. They've read enough that Jim knows how to wake someone, but the only people worth waking are inaccessible. Jim feels trapped. He rereads Aurora's work and seeps himself in memories that aren't his; ones of home are too painful. He asks Aurora for another day of the week alone with Arthur, one which she happily concedes provided she gets one too. They still have breakfast and dinner together, but with no new ideas of how to send themselves back into hibernation, they only fill their days with distraction. And of the distractions available on the ship, only Aurora reminds Jim of his own worries, of how permanent their situation might be. One day he doesn't see Aurora at breakfast. When she doesn't answer her communicator about dinner, he worries. He checks the theater and the pool. He checks the restaurants. He checks with Arthur. She isn't anywhere. Finally, hesitantly, he knocks on her suite door. \"Go away,\" he hears muffled by the door and some distance. \"Are you alright?\" he calls back. \"I said, go away.\" \"Just tell me if you're okay. Then I'll leave.\" \"I'm…\" He doesn't hear the answer. \"What?\" He hears distant rustling and footsteps, and then the door opens. She looks like she's been crying. That's all he registers before she throws herself into his arms and buries her face into his chest. He freezes only a second before wrapping his arms around her. They stand there in silence, her breathing heavy and his nearly stopped, for several minutes before she pulls away. \"Sorry,\" she says. She wipes away a tear. \"Today's not a good day. I needed that.\" \"Anytime,\" says Jim. He wants to say more—he wants to say she can do it again, he wants to say he'll say yes, he wants to ask what happened and if he can help any more than he apparently has—but she shuts the door again. Her imagery of the Empire State Building sticks in his head that night as he tries to fall asleep. It lingers with him, that and the sight of her tear-stained face, throughout the next two days as he tries and fails to see her around the ship. After his second sleepless night, he decides to put the image to good use. He makes his way to the supply part of the ship and borrows some scrap metal (or possibly ship repair metal, but what is he going to need to repair, anyway?). He sets to work. By the time exhaustion finally catches up with him, he's finished. He leaves the final product sitting in front of Aurora's door, returns to the Vienna suite, and falls into a dreamless slumber. When he wakes, it's to the sound of knocking. He answers the door only in boxers, partly due to fatigue and partly because he wants to see the one person who could be knocking more than he cares about modesty. Aurora is holding the model of the Empire State Building delicately with both hands. \"This is beautiful,\" she says. \"I know it's not the same,\" says Jim. He yawns and rubs the back of his neck. \"Hope you like it.\" \"I do.\" They examine each other. Aurora still seems defeated, but any sign of depression is held at bay. Jim's stomach sinks as he wonders what else he could possibly do the next time despair overtakes her. But Aurora apparently decides that's a question for another time. \"Come on,\" she says. \"Let's get some lunch.\" She doesn't break the topic until two days after he makes her the model. \"So you've been reading my work?\" She's watching him work at a punching bag. When he glances up at her, she doesn't seem angry, only curious. \"Yeah,\" he says. He delivers two swift punches. \"Do you mind?\" \"Not unless you're going to tell me it's bad.\" Jim delivers a final punch and takes off a glove. He wipes his forehead. \"It's not.\" \"I'm glad.\" \"It's really good, actually. Ask Arthur.\" \"He read it too?\" \"No, but I've been telling him all about it for weeks.\" Jim comes to lean against the wall beside her. He takes off his second glove and suddenly wishes he weren't so sweaty. He feels like he's too close to her to allow himself to be sweaty. \"Want to know what I've been telling Arthur?\" she asks. \"If you want to tell me.\" He would be lying if he said curiosity hadn't crossed his mind, but, well, they'd asked for alone time with Arthur for a reason. \"He's probably sick of me at this point for it,\" she says. \"But I keep going between how unlucky I am and how…well, lucky I am.\" \"How's that work?\" \"I was woken up ninety years before I was supposed to be. I was supposed to live more than two hundred years, by Earth terms, and now unless you or I figure something out, we might die here. Probably just of old age, but we'd die.\" Jim reels at the firmness of her voice. Neither of them has said it before, and he frankly expected her to freak out before putting it into words. But she only stares straight ahead, looking at the punching bag as if she'd like to give it a single whack of despair. Maybe she's said more of this to Arthur than she has to him. \"But,\" she says, \"I'm not alone. I couldn't imagine being here all by myself, especially knowing as little about this ship as I do.\" She turns to look at Jim. \"Don't get me wrong—I'm not saying I'm glad you're a mechanic. Which I am. But I'm also glad you're here.\" She pauses, and then offers a morbid grin. \"That's awful, isn't it? I'm glad you're in the same hellish situation as I am. But we're in it together. And I realized last night that you'd only know just how much that gesture\"—she doesn't mention which gesture, but Jim understands she means the model—\"means to me if you'd read my writing, and I realized I was glad you did.\" \"Anyone would have read it,\" points out Jim. \"If you only had one other person around, wouldn't you read their stuff?\" \"But you wouldn't have to remember it. And you definitely wouldn't have to refer back to it. You could have ignored me,\" says Aurora. \"That's what I would have done. I would have let me be angry and upset and feel alone. But you didn't, and I don't feel alone. For the moment, anyway. But that moment is enough.\" She looks into Jim's eyes, as intensely as when they first met but for a different reason. To convey gratitude, sincerity, warmth. \"Thank you.\" Jim keeps her gaze. He's still sweaty, but he no longer cares as much. \"I'm glad you're here too,\" he says. Jim feels a tension between them, but Aurora doesn't seem to. She carries on with him like in their early days, asking questions and slipping in banter. She's a little more subdued about it, but the more information she picks up about his old life, the more information she has to tease him with. Jim senses her closeness. She sits closer to him, lets their feet mingle under tables, takes him by the wrist or the arm to guide him places. She takes him shop(lift)ing and insists he approve her \"colony-worthy\" wardrobe. She ignores his eyes lingering on the curve of her back leading down to her waist, or the shape of her breasts even when she forgoes cleavage-bearing clothes. She presses against him just a second too long when they brush during basketball. Jim doesn't know whether he craves romance or simple human contact, and he's stumped even more by Aurora's intentions. He's discerned that she's straight or at least bi—numerous stories of old boyfriends have proved so—but he has a feeling that \"not if you were the last man on earth\" might play heavily into their situation. She might need human contact—the warmth, the heartbeat, the endorphins if he wants to get technical—simply for how grounding it is. He knows he needs that much too, but if that were all he needed, he wouldn't find himself aching for more every time she moved away. \"How do you know if you're in love?\" he laments to Arthur on one of their personal days. \"Or whether it's love or lust?\" \"I imagine love involves a general caring,\" says Arthur as he polishes a glass. \"Putting their needs before yours, and so on.\" \"But both our needs are taken care of already.\" \"Not all of them,\" says Arthur. Jim straightens. \"Why,\" he says, \"what has she been telling you?\" \"A gentleman never tells,\" says Arthur. \"But from what I've been hearing from you, Jim, you might be needing more than you currently have.\" \"But does she?\" asks Jim. \"I can't say,\" says Arthur. \"Just give me a guess, then,\" says Jim. \"Would you take an idea instead?\" \"Sure, anything.\" \"Try asking her.\" He knows he won't have the nerve to say it in person. He doesn't even have the guts to say \"we might die here\" like she has. So he hijacks a cleaning bot. He mounts a camera to its head and gives its grasping claw a message on paper. He remotely rolls it around the ship, searching until he finally finds Aurora at work on a laptop. He thinks she's writing—he knows she prefers to speak aloud, but she could have two mediums—until he sees that the screen has some sort of software on it. When she sees the bot he's sent, she immediately closes the screen. \"Well hi,\" she says, looking straight into the camera. \"You lost?\" Jim smiles at her teasing tone and makes the camera shake itself side to side. He sends out the claw with his paper—\"Date tonight? -Jim\"—and waits for her to take it, trying to time the claw so that it lets go at the right time. Aurora takes it and reads over. By the time she turns back, Jim has already made the bot offer her a pen too. She smiles, still amused with the ordeal, and scribbles back an answer to give to the bot. She waves it goodbye, and Jim keeps the camera trained on her for as long as he can before he needs it to steer. She's smiling as the bot leaves, but that could mean anything, he tells himself. He directs the bot back to his hiding spot and impatiently makes it hold out the message the minute the door opens. He snatches the paper and absently pats the bot's camera as he reads. Love to. -A Jim can't contain his grin. He loots one of the clothing stores for a nice blazer—Jim has the opposite problem of Aurora, too much practical clothing and too little (sexy) formalwear—and paces his suite in his nice shoes for a good half-hour before he can call himself reasonably early. He walks the thirty seconds it takes to reach her door and knocks. She opens the door just as she's reaching her downstairs area, and Jim appreciates the sight almost immediately. She wears a slit black dress that hugs her in a way that makes Jim think she was paying attention to where he was looking after all. She hasn't worn her hair any differently, which is fine because Jim likes the way it frames her face. She's smiling gently and with a hint of a dare. \"You look fantastic,\" he says before he can even try for suaveness. \"You clean up pretty well yourself,\" she says. She closes the door and takes the arm he offers. \"So where are we going?\" she asks. \"The one place we haven't gone,\" says Jim. \"That French restaurant, L'espace.\" He says it like \"less-pace\", and Aurora laughs. \"Not a lot of French out there in Denver, huh?\" \"Well then you say it,\" challenges Jim. \"I studied Russian. Much prettier than French.\" \"No, go ahead, I actually want to hear you say it now.\" \"I think the emphasis is on the second syllable,\" says Aurora, but she's blushing now. \"Alright, I take it back. You say it however you want. I'm sure the waiter will correct you.\" The robot ends up introducing the restaurant as \"leh-SPASS\", and Aurora and Jim look at each other with properly chastised expressions as they're seated. Once the waiter leaves with the promise of wine, they snicker. \"So,\" says Aurora once they've calmed down, \"I gotta ask. Is this a special occasion?\" \"What, like our anniversary of unfreezing? No, I think we're still a few months away from that.\" Jim rubs one of his wrists. \"I just…I dunno, I was talking to Arthur. Because I was worried about you.\" \"I've been okay,\" says Aurora. \"Better than some days.\" \"Yeah, I noticed. And I'm glad about that, definitely. But just…\" He exhales. \"I like you, Aurora. And I don't know how I like you, and I definitely don't know how you like me. So I'm trying to figure it out.\" \"So we're on a date.\" \"We're on a date. If you want.\" \"I could save you some time.\" Jim blinks. \"I like you too.\" She smiles, and after the robot returns with wine, she minutely lifts her glass to him before she sips. \"Let's see how tonight goes.\" Jim's shoulders slump in relief, although very few of his questions have been answered. He raises his glass in return. They end up discussing the happiest of their memories of home. The topic of the ship doesn't feel safe yet, and they try to stay away from wistfulness. Instead Aurora entertains him with the exploits, both dating and work-related, of her friends in New York, and Jim talks about the struggle of balancing his engineering degree with an actual social life. They talk and laugh so much that it takes them twice as long as usual to finish dinner, and they have enough room for dessert. \"So I know we've been avoiding it,\" says Aurora as they wait for their chocolate mousse, \"but I just have to ask one question.\" \"Sure,\" says Jim. He admittedly gulps a little more wine than he meant to. \"What's the biggest thing you miss about home?\" Jim presses his lips together, thinking. Most of his friends drifted away after high school or college, and his mom is dead. Any way he entertained himself in Denver is also here on the Avalon . \"Every so often,\" he says, \"I'd get off work early and drive west.\" \"Driving, then?\" \"That's part of it, yeah. But also, the mountains are west. And the closer you get to the mountains—like, Golden or Lakewood—the better the sunset is. There was this park I liked to go to in Lakewood, and I'd just sit on the hood of my car and watch it. Sunsets behind the mountains are different from other places I've been. They light up the whole horizon so all you can see are these huge blue outlines, and then the orange sky behind them. And the city lights beneath them.\" Jim shakes his head. \"I never understood how you could see a sunset anywhere else.\" Aurora stares at him. \"Jim. That's beautiful.\" And then she smiles. \"I hope you don't mind if I steal it.\" \"Steal away,\" says Jim. They both laugh, and the moment is broken as the robot waiter brings their dessert. Aurora launches into the topic of her favorite routes to jog in New York, and Jim has to assume that that's what she misses most, although he was sure she'd say something about Central Park. They finish their mousse and Aurora declines a stop at Arthur's bar on the way to their suites. The closer they get to their respective doors, the more nervous Jim becomes. He knows sex on the first date can be frowned upon, but they've known each other a while, and she keeps pressing herself against his side… They pass his door, and Aurora stops beside it. \"Can I come in?\" she asks when Jim looks back at her. Jim swallows. \"Sure. Just, uh…\" He flashes his wrist at the reader (he's long had it programmed to let him in, something he can't do for the crew's doors because he has to break himself in and rewire from within) and gestures for her to enter first. Aurora is standing in the middle of his living room when Jim closes the door and turns to her. \"So I know what you're thinking,\" says Aurora, \"or at least I think I do. But I'm actually here for two reasons.\" \"Oh. Huh.\" Jim's mind—and select other parts—are whirring. He can only think of one thing she'd be doing in his suite after a date, weeks after an intimate talk discussing how glad she is to have him around, and although he refuses to let himself believe that's one of her reasons, he hopes, he hopes — (He's pretty sure he's in love, has been sure since she took the hand he offered to escort her home tonight, but he can't deny the desire that throbbed through him when she stopped at his door.) Aurora reaches into her cleavage— oh god —and pulls out a thumb drive. \"This is the first thing,\" she says when Jim stares at her unwittingly. \"Mind if I go up to your bedroom?\" Jim nodes silently and follows her up the stairs. She passes his bed and approaches the panel that projects scenery for him. She feels on the side for a port and inserts the thumb drive, and after some brief manipulation the screen changes its image to show— Denver at sunset. Aurora steps back and to Jim's side to admire her handiwork. \"I was working on it when you sent the bot,\" she says. \"I pulled up some images of Denver, since you gave me a bit of New York, and the first thing I saw was…\" \"Sunset,\" he says. He's in awe. Aurora has included the Denver skyline, which was usually behind him in real life, but otherwise it's perfect. He's forgotten the tinge of purple that gradually overtakes the sky as the golden sunset fades over the mountains. \"How did you do this?\" he asks. \"I was a journalist at one point,\" says Aurora with the smallest of laughs. \"You have to have some graphics and editing experience to be in the industry, so I've played around with image editing before. This was the biggest thing I've ever tried to do, though, so I'm glad it turned out okay.\" \"It turned out great.\" Before he thinks, Jim wraps an arm around her waist and kisses her on the cheek. \"Thank you.\" They stay pressed against one another for another few minutes, admiring Aurora's work. Then Aurora shifts, and moves herself to stand before Jim. One of her hands finds his, and the other the back of his neck. Jim looks down at her. \"You didn't ask about the second thing,\" says Aurora. She leans up and slowly, so slowly that Jim realizes what's happening and is halfway to believing it's real, she kisses him. Nothing really changes, except that now they wake up in Jim's bed every day. They keep their days with Arthur and occasionally eat lunch apart. Addendum: some things change. Jim has a tiny, hidden desire to have sex in every room of the ship—except the rooms containing the hibernation pods, because that freaks him out a little—and Aurora is willing to indulge him in some of his favorite locations. Their research of the ship veers more into finding new supplies, into surprises for one another and changes to their everyday lives. Jim tells himself he's searching for a hidden manual, but he emerges with roses. He genuinely does search for a captain's log or a way to send a distress message, but he finds wires of precious metals. The metals can wait until he and Aurora are ready to say the words \"I love you\". He does love her, but just as with their current situation on this ship, he skirts around it. He busies himself with fixing bots and with reading the new book Aurora is writing. \"You're right,\" Jim says one night as they're reading in his living room, \"it's really weird to read about yourself.\" \"If you don't like it, stop reading,\" says Aurora. She jokingly glares at him. Jim grins back. \"And miss whatever happens next? Not a chance.\" He knows what's going to happen next. Aurora's birthday is coming up, almost exactly a year into their early revival. A year since an unknown error woke two random pods. A year since he's met the woman he loves more than anyone he's ever known. A year in which—until yesterday—he never thought to open the door at the other end of the bay of hibernation pods, where two spacesuits wait patiently to be worn. He knows exactly what his gift to her is going to be. Gus Mancuso wakes up two years into Jim's waking-up, so these two still have a (drama-free) year to go. (EDIT: this comment makes it sound like I meant to continue this fic. I don't. I marked it as complete when I published it because I only wanted to write the first year of their relationship.) Fun fact: if you're watching the sunset from Denver and you see the cityscape as well as the mountains, you're watching from the suburb of Aurora. ","Summary":" I, er, actually liked the movie.

I really hope you like it and please review . Jim \"You'll be alone.\" His hands shook as she turned to look at him. \"I've been alone before, and I'll be fine.\" He couldn't raise his voice more. The words were like a secret he was unwilling to share. He wouldn't be fine. He would never be fine again. He would never be able to talk to her. To laugh with her. To hug her. To feel her. He looked at her beautiful face. He would never be able to see these breathtakingly gorgeous eyes. The eyes that used to light up for him once. The eyes that used to pierce him with hatred. The same eyes that were looking at him now. Calculating. \"But I would never see you again.\" He clenched his fists. She didn't hate him. She had brought him back. Maybe she didn't love him anymore. He knew he wasn't worth her love. But for one, selfish moment he thought of having her with him, to have her company until he grew old and died. At that moment he though of their life before Arthur had told her the truth. He imagined having that life again. His heart hurt from the longing. But he knew what was right. He had to give back what he had taken. She deserved better. She deserved the life he had selfishly taken from her. He would be alone. And she would live her life. He had to right his wrong. So, he forced the words out: \"I'll come and visit you.\" She looked at him, quietly letting his words settled in. She turned to look at the pod. \"Come and find me when you are ready. So I can put you back to sleep. There must be someone to press the button.\" He inhaled sharply and turned away from her. That was it. He couldn't do anything else. It was her choice now. But he knew and the knowing hurt him, that she would agree to go back to sleep. That he would never be with her again. He reached his room and sat on his bed. Wrapping his arms around him, he let it all out. Aurora \"You'll be alone.\" She couldn't bear to see the pain in his eyes as she told him. \"I've been alone before, and I'll be fine.\" No, you won't. They both knew that. He wouldn't be fine. How could he be fine? She couldn't imagine living alone. Never talking to another person again. He could wake up someone else, but she knew he wouldn't. He had known it was wrong waking her up. That was why he was showing her this. He hadn't had to tell her about the pod. He could've kept it secret, so she could be with him. But he knew it was the right thing. She looked at his sad eyes and felt her heart pound. \"But I would never see you again.\" The realization hit her like a blow to the face. She would never be with him again. Never see his beautiful face. Hear him laugh. See him look at her with that look in his eyes, the look that meant that he loved her. He was looking at her like that now too. Even after all the hate and the pain and the tears. He still loved her. And she knew that this was hard for him. Letting her go. She knew it in her heart that it was difficult to let him go too. \"I'll come and visit you.\" She knew he would. She knew that he would look down at her and see what they had been through. But he would still love her. But he would be alone. She looked down at the pod. She could live her life again. She could have a future. She could publish her book, see the word. It was her opportunity. But seizing that opportunity would mean that she would have to leave him. Leave that love behind. \"Come and find me when you are ready. So I can put you back to sleep. There must be someone to press the button.\" He turned away from her and left the room. She had seen his hands shake. She had seen the pain. Could she leave him? Did she still love him? She closed her eyes. She knew she did. ","Summary":" Author's note: I just saw Passengers and I fell in love.

AN: I saw Frankenstein for the second time today, the chemistry between Victor and Igor just leaps off the screen! Finally got inspired to write. I don't have a beta reader and I wish I did, I apologize in advance for any errors. Victor watched all the workers as they hurried about setting everything up; two months of nonstop working was about to come to fruition, years of dreaming, the world as they all knew it would be changed forever! Not even the actions of Turpin had been able to stop him. Some called him a genius. Others called him mad, saying that he had lost his mind. Igor had started to believe it as well, refusing to join him in continuing what they had started. Igor. Victor hated how the smaller man still constantly occupied his thoughts, two months after their final confrontation. While working he was able to fully concentrate but at night when he had no choice but to try to get some sleep, his mind refused to rest. How he yearned for it to be the thoughts he had during his school days, of being finished with that worthless institution and in practice for himself. Able to do his experiments undisturbed and his own way. Then one night a trip to the circus that was in town had completely changed his life, finding another poor and misunderstood soul. Igor hadn't tried but he quickly got under his skin and became his dearest friend, he was sincere in his efforts and it wasn't able because he was grateful to Victor for his brand new life. Victor knew for as long as he'd been old enough that women held no interest for him; clingy, nagging, and simply to troublesome. Another reason he was a disappointment to his family, he was the only son and his father always constantly went on about how the family name needed to be carried on. Well after tonight it would definitely be remembered! He hated himself as he remembered the arousal he had felt during the times they'd argued, the feeling of Igor's body during the times he had pinned him against the wall... Blast it! He forced himself to watch the workers and busied himself with setting everything up, the rumble of thunder let them know a storm was definitely coming closer. He looked up to see Finnegan up on a raised platform with another worker and the blond man flashed a thumb up gesture, Victor returned the gesture exhilaration souring through him. He returned inside the castle then he felt a presence behind him and it made him pause. \"Victor!\" The whispered voice was unmistakable His heart stopped as he turned, \"Igor?\" He whispered; afraid his eyes were playing a cruel joke and the one he was trying to stop longing for would vanish into thin air. Igor nodded and neither would probably be able to answer the question of who moved first, but they were in each other's arms. Victor held Igor's face; \"You've come?\" Igor nodded emotion in his eyes and voice. \"I came.\" Victor was torn between happiness and anger, but for the time being happiness was winning. \"I thought you had left me behind, to with...Her.\" Victor wasn't about to say her name even if he had bothered to remember it. \"I do deeply care for her Victor, and I love her in my own way, but there is another I also love but with a greater intensity.\" Victor felt his heart briefly stop, could it be? \"Yes Victor, I know that I love you as well and not because it's all gratitude for the life you gave me, you truly cared of who I was inside, helped nurture my talents. You got under my skin.\" Igor touched his shoulders, \"If I hated you and didn't love you I wouldn't have undertaken the journey to get here to warn you.\" \"Warn me of what?\" \"Finnegan tried to have me killed.\" Igor saw Victor's face as he went angry, he could almost see lightning bolts in Victor's blue eyes. \"He told me he plans to kill you and steal your work.\" \"Well he won't succeed, tonight he'll think I'm still his ally but when the time is right I will prevail, you must remain hidden.\" Igor opened his mouth and Victor lowered his face and pressed his lips to Igor's, a small reason was to stop the protest he knew was coming, but mainly to give into what he had desired so long. Igor's body relaxed against his and he returned the kiss eagerly. He was so innocent, Victor felt arousal race through him. All the things I can teach him. The need for air pulled them apart. \"Victor...\" Igor began. \"I'll soon have to go.\" Victor whispered, pulling Igor closer again. He knew Igor was no doubt still being confronted by his morality issues and he needed to delay it for as long as he could. \"Let's just have this moment, you know you can argue with me but in the end I'll still go.\" Igor nodded and laid his head on Victor's shoulder, Victor lifted his head up and their lips met again. A discreet cough interrupted them and they turned to see one of the workers. \"It is time.\" Victor released his hold on Igor. Tonight he would complete his destiny.

Unbeated so I'm sorry for all the errors. *** Victor walked quickly to the carriage that would take him to Scotland and away from England and Scotland Yard. He got in and sat back into the cushioned seats feeling drained. He felt the urge to look out and the window and angrily tried to repress it. Why look back? What would he see? No one would be looking out the window. Especially not him. Igor had made his choice. How could Igor forsake him? After everything Victor had done for him, after all they'd been through. He hadn't felt this kind of pain since... Since his brother Henry had died. His mother who had been so loving become distant, crying constantly or in bouts of silence. She had died two years later. His father had become harder on him, pushing him to succeed and always expressing disappointment in something. Loneliness became a constant companion and Victor learned not to fully trust anyone, never give his heart, to always be focused on medicine. He became hard and cold, no one able to bring down the barrier, he found tolerable happiness. Then one trip to the circus and a hunchback had changed that. He'd never seen such brilliance, until he watched him save the woman's life. And he had saved the man from the cruelty he could see was being placed on him. Igor had slowly brought Victor's barriers down and true happiness had started to come. Now Turpin and the female acrobat Victor had helped saved had ruined everything. What did Igor see in her? What did she have that Victor did not? Victor knew he had to forget Igor if he was to be successful in his research, it would be hard but it needed to be done. Loneliness was destined to be his forever companion. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: Only the fic is mine.

Todos y cada uno de ellos son de la autoría de Mary Shelley. Y si adaptación cinematográfica le corresponde a Sir Paul McGuian. Yo solo los someto a mi voluntad literaria. Capítulo único. Creación. Deambulando por las calles de New York es que noto cuán lejos han llegado mis pasos. El como ya no estoy en el viejo Londres y no soy más un desquiciado. Aunque si llamarme desquiciado significa tener un punto de vista aún más evolucionado que mis retrógradas colegas humanos regidos bajo la intolerancia e ignorancia costumbrista y religiosa, entonces sigo siendo un desquiciado. Al punto al que quería llegar es que no soy más aquel hereje atentador de la humanidad. No más. Camino por Brooklyn cargando una pequeña maleta y unos cuantos dólares en mis bolsillos. Se supone que debo encontrar un lugar donde establecerme y devolver la integridad a mi apellido. Aunque quizá eso no sea recomendable. Han pasado sólo unos años desde mi funesto episodio de vanagloria y egocentrismo. Eso dicho por la prensa amarillista de toda gran Bretaña. Edificios viejos y demás carruajes desfilan por las calles Neoyorquinas. Están bañadas en nieve y la nostalgia vuelve implacable a mis memorias. Aquellas donde aún recuerdo a Henry deslizándose de una montaña, vano intento de ser un fuerte. Sonrió sin mediarlo. Mis pasos aceleran y la ventisca helada sale exhalada de mi nariz. Falta poco para llegar a las puertas de la Universidad y presentarme como su nuevo físico teórico. La circulación mengua durante algunos trayectos llamando mi atención totalmente. Aquello que está constipando el tránsito se esclarece cual viejo deja vu. — ¡Pasen, pasen! ¡Visiten el circo, 50¢ sólo está noche!.— gritan desde un carruaje seguido por algunas bestias encerradas. Instintivamente les sigo sin considerar mis actos. Es un fortuito el encontrarme ahí vagando justo cuando aquella trifulca cabalga galante por mi camino. No soy consiente de mis pasos hasta que me encuentro en un extenso baldío decorado con lonas y luces. Sin dudas me sorprendo de estar ahí, de pie, sintiendo mi estómago retorcerse de catastrófico presentimiento. Era de día y todo show aún no comenzaba, aún así, entre sin dudarlo y recorrí las instalaciones. Quizá no eran tan extrovertidos o incluso innovadores como los de Londres pero mantenían una presentación bastante considerable. Los payasos, los vendedores de novedades, los hombres en zancos eran por demás decoración de dicho festival. Lo recorrí sin meditar el tiempo, era como volver a la época oscura y con sentido de mi vida. Fue hasta que llegue a las jaulas de animales que detuve a considerar mi presencia ahí. No pude evitar el analizar cada parte anatómica de las distintas especies. Era como un trastorno compulsivo detallar cada extremidad y declararla útil e inútil. Era obsesionante. Leones, monos, cebras y demás cuadrúpedos estaban en perfecto estado. Algo que sin dudas no tenían los circos del viejo continente. Seguí avanzando casi guiado por mi optimismo. Era como si esperará la revelación de algo grande. Algo que quizá ya había descubierto antes. Entre a un apartado : \"Freak show\".. . Evidencia misma de que la creación sólo está sobrevalorada y que la autoconservacion es más edificante que la omnipresencia. Los personajes ahí reunidos cubrían descripciones gráficas de cualquier novela de ficción. Era un poco incómodo saber que en mayoría todas sus aflicciones médicas y deformidades corporales se debían a malas praxis o degeneraciones genéticas y no a un ser divino castigando la lujuriosa perversión de incestos o degenerada copulación. Me adentre en ese mundo tan maravillosamente curioso. Con mis estudios era consiente de cual debería ser el método adecuado para darles una vida más próspera, más saludable. Sin embargo, no había mucho que hacer por ellos cuando su vida siempre ha sido un hórrido espectáculo de marionetas y disfraces. Ellos me miraba extraño diciendome vagamente que no debería estar ahí, que aún no iniciaba su cometida atracción. Respetando su espacio, retrocedí hacia la salida. Lo último que necesitan es a un fisgón curioso y juicioso medicamento en su di... — Lo, lo siento señor...— me dijo un hombre bajo, de postura encorvada y caminado inclinado sobre su pierna derecha. — Disculpeme a mi. Con su permiso.— me miró asombrado, como si nunca le hubieran dedicado palabras corteses. O siquiera le hubieran hablado mirándolo a los ojos. El solo asintió mientras se dirigía con sus compañeros. —Caballeros, mil disculpas.— me despedí inclinando mi sombrero. Ya había causado inconvenientes ahí. Me encamine a la salida pensativo. Hacia mucho que mi nostalgia no vagaba entre mis recuerdos. Y aquel jorobado había despertado el más profundo en mi. Había olvidado por completo lo que es que te vean como un monstruo, el que te juzguen como tal y te azoten como tal. Incluso había olvidado que yo fui uno de ellos. Salí del circo sin mirara atrás, tantos pensamientos volvieron a mi cual dagas sólo para recordarme lo que algún día fui. Y que, terriblemente, sigo siendo en esencia. Caminé por las calles en busca de oxígeno, de algo que me hiciera ignorar mis pecados y me embriagará con la ficha de su omisión. Pero no lo había. Ya no me acompañaba. Acaso... ¿En verdad atente contra la naturaleza? ¿Ciertamente me creí aún más Supremo que cualquier deidad e hice de mi vida un aborrecible experimento? Ante cualquier que analizará mis pecados vería cuán repudiable llegue a ser. Devolví mis pasos hacia mi camino original, no podía dar clases en la Universidad e inspirar a algún joven a ser como yo. A ser un monstruo sin escrupulos. Bajo la nieve seguí mi ruta mientras los recuerdos de aquel día invadían mi mente. El como mi universo colapso ante el error de mi orgullo y el como casi pierdo a... —Mi creación.— me dije. Lo curioso de tal divagación es que no lamentaba el hecho de haber destruido al horrible monstruo que cree. No. Internamente sabía a quién me refería. Sonrei al recordar a la única persona en el mundo a quien puedo considerar mi amigo. A la única persona que ante sus ojos fui un Salvador y no pecado. Quien con su afabilidad me mostró que traer el pasado al presente sólo es una obsesión que nubla todo sentido. Que no soy Dios, pero que puedo ser inmortal. — Mi creación.— repetí.— Igor...— Es curioso pensar que yo lo cree a él solo por darle ropa decente y una apariencia respetable. Es curioso que el me dé el mérito por liberarlo cuando fue el quien me salvó a mi. Es contradictorio llamarlo mi crraacion cuando fue el quien me tomo cuando yo me encontraba fracturado. Me quebranto y me instó de nuevo en el paradigma de la moralidad. Yo soy creación suya, y él es sólo mi mejor amigo. Fin. N.A: Gracias si han llegado hasta aquí. Esto lo escribo basado en la película y no en el libro como tal. Espero que sea de su agrado y me lo hagan saber con un rw. Hasta luego.

Ve skutečnosti si nepamatoval, že by byl někdy v životě tak strašně unavený. Ani když byl ještě v cirkuse, přestože tam měl spoustu více nebo méně příjemných povinností a jen málo času k odpočinku. Život s Viktorem byl překvapivě náročný. Nepravidelný režim, nekonečná práce, mnohahodinové studium anatomie, ponocování, přednášky na univerzitě, návštěvy divadla nebo různých podivných večírků, když Viktor občas usoudil, že by měli na chvíli někam mezi lidi. Bylo to náročné a unavující, ale Igor by to nevyměnil za nic na světě. Život, jaký by si přál, kdyby měl odvahu si něco takového vůbec představovat, něco mimo cirkus, který byl kdysi celým jeho vesmírem. Igor býval muž bez možnosti chodit vzpřímeně, muž beze jména a bez budoucnosti. A Viktor mu tohle všechno dal. Dal mu všechno tohle a ještě mnohem víc, a Igor byl tak spokojený se svým životem, že si to nikdy nedovedl ani představit. Mohl dělat cokoli, kdyby chtěl. Mohl by odejít z Londýna, možná dokonce opustit Británii, na nějakou dobu. Mohl by cestovat, podívat se po Evropě, poznávat lidi a místa a historii, studovat. Najít si život, který bude jenom jeho. Jenže ta představa, že by opustil Viktora – Nedokázal si představit, že by měl opustit Viktora. Že by měl žít sám, nevídat ho každý den, netrávit s ním čas plánováním a prací a smíchem. Uměl si představit, jak by žil, kdyby znovu o všechno přišel. A nebylo to ani tak složité, protože to nebylo tak dávno, kdy neměl nic. Co si nedokázal představit, je život bez Viktora . Bez čehokoli nebo kdekoli, jistě, protože to byl způsob, jakým strávil skoro celý svůj život. Ale ne bez Viktora. Jeho svět byl o tolik lepší, když v něm byl Viktor. Igor mírně potřásl hlavou a klouby prstů si unaveně protřel oči. Donutil se soustředit. Nepotřeboval se rozptylovat tím, že bude myslet na Viktora – na kterého myslel už i tak víc než dost. Potřeboval konečně správně zapojit přívod vzduchu, protože jinak se mu nikdy nepodaří – Zmateně zamrkal, když se mu plíce, kterou se pokoušel napojit na hadici se vzduchem, napnula pod prsty. Byl to zvláštní pocit, to, že něco, co bývá obvykle ukryté hluboko v žijícím těle, růžová hmota, která by měla být nehybná a mrtvá, je v pohybu, jako by byla pořád ještě hluboko v něčím hrudníku. Jako by se pořád ještě neúnavně pokoušela dostat kyslík do celého těla, rozehnat ho do všech koutů, udržet své tělo naživu. Igor se přidušeně zasmál. To, co tady dokázali, na čem pracovali – snažili se oblafnout přírodu a Igor právě dokázal, že je to možné. A jestli bylo možné udělat něco takového, znovu oživit něco, co už bylo jednou mrtvé, co jiného by ještě mohli dokázat? Jaké zákony ještě můžou porušit, když dokážou tohle ? „Co?\" ozvalo se za ním a Igor znal Viktorův hlas dost na to, aby v něm zachytil zvědavost a počínající nadšení. Viktor ani nečekal na jeho odpověď a nechal toho, co dělal, ať to bylo cokoli. Bez dalšího slova přeběhl přes místnost, jeho kroky skoro jako tanec, a přitiskl se k jeho zádům, aby se mu mohl podívat přes rameno. Jeho hrudník sálal teplem i přes několik vrstev oblečení všude tam, kde se dotýkali. A potom se najednou hlasitě rozesmál a zezadu Igora obemkl pažemi okolo těla a trochu s ním zacloumal, jeho sevření pevné, tak pevné, že se mu skoro zastavil dech. „Drahý Igore,\" dostal ze sebe Viktor mezi záchvaty nadšeného smíchu a ještě o něco málo zpevnil sevření. Tvář přitiskl zboku k jeho. Igor se přestal smát a po těle mu přeběhlo zamrazení. Viktor byl hodně fyzický člověk. Nedělalo mu problém být v něčí blízkosti, dotýkat se někoho, aniž by se za tím nutně skrývalo něco víc. Byl lékař – byl zvyklý dotýkat se lidí okolo sebe, často i důvěrně, aniž by v tom viděl něco osobního, a pro Igora to bylo v první chvíli něco skoro nepředstavitelného. Že se ho někdo dotýká, aniž by to mělo nějaký účel, nebo proto, aby ubližoval. Viktor takový nebyl. Bral lidi, včetně něj, za ruce nebo za ramena, plácal je po zádech, někdy jim cuchal vlasy. Možná si ani doopravdy neuvědomoval, že to dělá, alespoň zezačátku ne. Jenomže na Igora působil každý jeho dotyk stejně, jako se za ním skrývalo všechno na světě. Dech se mu zadrhával pokaždé, když se ho Viktor dotkl, ve tváři se mu objevoval ruměnec, jako by byl jen děcko, a ne dospělý muž, když byli v jedné místnosti, nemohl od něj odtrhnout pohled. A pak se ho Viktor najednou dotýkat přestal, a Igor si byl jistý, že to Viktor musí vědět. Že odhalil, na co Igor myslí, když se na něj dívá, jak se mu rozbuší srdce pokaždé, když přátelsky sklouzne rukou po jeho rameni. Viktor to musel vědět. Jenže ho neposlal pryč, jak očekával. Nechoval se k němu nijak jinak než do té doby. Pořád se s ním smál, pořád ho chválil pokaždé, když se mu něco podařilo, pořád ještě ho s sebou tahal po Londýně, když si chtěl trochu vyčistit hlavu a zmizet na chvíli někam, kde nebude pořád zavřený mezi čtyřmi stěnami. Nebo alespoň mezi jinými čtyřmi stěnami než byly ty v jeho bytě. Choval se k němu úplně stejně jako celou tu dobu. Jen se ho už nedotýkal. Nedotýkal se ho, ale začal se na něj dívat . Nejdřív trochu zmateně, jako by byl Igor kniha, kterou se mu nedaří přečíst, přestože se o to snaží ze všech sil. A potom jeho oči trochu potemněly a jeho pohled byl najednou o něco intenzivnější. Těžší. Zkoumavější. Igor na sobě cítil jeho pohled skoro pořád, ale pokaždé, když se na něj podíval, Viktor uhnul pohledem, v očích stud. Nikdy se nepokusil vyhledat u něj potěšení, přestože mu muselo být jasné, že kdyby chtěl, Igor by mu neřekl ne. Musel vědět, že Igor by to přivítal , jakýkoli projev jeho přízně, jeho blízkost. Jeho doteky. Igor se zachvěl. „Viktore,\" dostal ze sebe slabě, jeho hlas chraplavý. Prsty volné ruky se mu bezděky stočily do dlaně, a on sevřel pěst, aby potlačil nutkání zvednout ruku a zabořit ji Viktorovi do vlasů, nebo ji sevřít v látce jeho oblečení, kdekoli, kam dosáhne. Přitáhnout si ho k sobě blíž, otočit se k němu a podívat se na něj, podívat se, jak se Viktor tváří. Chtěl vědět, jestli má Viktor zavřené oči nebo jestli zírá někam do prázdna, jestli má zčervenalé tváře. Jestli vypadá, jako by ho ta blízkost mezi nimi nějakým způsobem zasáhla stejně jako Igora. „ Viktore .\" Viktor na jeho hlas nezareagoval, ale jeho další nádech byl roztřesený. Hrudník se mu prudce zvedal a zase klesal, přitisknutý k jeho zádům, a potom najednou pohnul hlavou, jen o malý kousek, a rty zlehka přejel po jeho tváři, hned vedle ucha. Jeho dech byl horký a mírně zrychlený a vlhký proti jeho kůži, a potom zabořil nos do jeho vlasů, jako kdyby se ho chtěl nadechnout, jeho prsty křečovitě sevřené v látce Igorovy košile, a Igorovi se sevřelo hrdlo. Víčka mu klesla. Kousl se do rtu. „Mohl bys –\" dostal ze sebe slabě a hlas se mu chvěl. Polkl a prudce zamrkal, aby se soustředil. Pokusil se promluvit ještě jednou. „Kdybys chtěl, mohl bys.\" Viktor se nadechl tak prudce, že mu vzduch zasyčel mezi zuby a prsty se mu sevřely tak silně, že Igor i přes košili a nátělník cítil jeho nehty. „Chtěl bych,\" zamumlal Viktor a zněl přitom mírně nepřítomně, jeho rty stále hebké na Igorově tváři, jeho dech šimravý. „Oh, jak bych chtěl,\" dodal tiše, a než se Igor stačil aspoň usmát, odtáhl se od něj. „Možná jednou, v nějakém lepším světě, Igore.\" Bez dalšího slova se narovnal v ramenou, zlehka se dotkl Igorovy paže, a pak se otočil a odešel. A Igorovi nezbylo než doufat v nějaký jiný, lepší svět. ","Summary":" Igor se potřeboval pořádně vyspat.

Even after three months it still felt like a dream, no longer being in the circus, no longer a hunchback, and just being free. He looked at the empty space next to him, Victor never seemed to sleep much, always so full of frantic energy. Igor grinned, how he loved when Victor's frantic energy turned toward him and the passion that burned between them. Sometimes their loving was tender, but a lot of times hard and frantic. Igor had never imagined his body could be capable of such responses, reading about it in medical books and hearing stories was one thing, to actually experience it was another thing entirely. Victor was truly a master at everything. Igor stood up, enjoying the aching feeling in his back side and quickly showered and got dressed. *** After breakfast he was getting ready to leave when the cellar door flew open and Victor burst out, clearly on some sort of mission. Victor stopped and looked at him, \"Where are you off to at this time?\" \"Lorelei invited me to a book festival, I'll be back soon.\" Victor's brown eyes flashed and then grew dark, and then like a predator he began stalking toward Igor. Igor felt his heart pound as Victor's hand gripped the back of his neck and pulled Igor to him, closing all distance between them. Igor gasped as Victor kissed him hard, his tongue demanding entrance, Igor's lips open and Victor plunged his tongue inside. Igor felt arousal flow through him; every bit of him on fire, Victor pulled away a little ending the kiss and attacked the skin on Igor's neck. Igor cried out, gripping Victor's hair as Victor sank his teeth into Igor's skin. Igor knew it would definitely leave a mark, not for the first time and certainly not the last. Victor rose up to his full height and looked into Igor's eyes. \"A reminder of who you belong to.\" A smirk came to Victor's face, \"Tell your circus friend hello for me.\" Victor's eyes roamed over Igor's body and Igor shivered at Victor's burning gaze. Their loving tonight would definitely be rough. And Igor couldn't wait; trying to get Victor jealous was such a fun game. And the marks Victor left were always worth it.

AN: Popped into my mind while watching an awesome Victor/Igor video on YouTube. Unbeated. **** \"I own you! You will always belong to me!\" Igor cried out as Lord Barnaby knocked him to the ground, He shivered as the fear racing through him blocked out the cold of the winter night. Lord Barnaby stood over him a cruel smirk on his face... Suddenly Igor found himself at another time in his life when Barnaby thought he was trying to escape and began striking his back with his belt... *** Igor bolted upright screaming, his hands trying to feel how bad his back was, he could still feel the pain and every strike. Just then he saw Victor rush in and light some more candles so the room wasn't in so much darkness. Victor then slowly came up to him, Igor was breathing fast and labored. \"My back,\" Igor gasped. \"May I?\" Victor asked gently. Igor nodded and Victor's hands began to examine him. \"Igor, I don't see anything.\" Tears slid down Igor's face as he realized he'd been dreaming, He was free of the circus and his tormenter. \"He said he owned me, He abused me so many times...\" Victor gently took Igor's face in his hands, \"Listen to me, no one owns you, He can't hurt you anymore.\" Igor pulled Victor close without thinking about it, burying his face in Victor's chest, his arms around Victor's neck. Victor didn't pull away and gently stroked Igor's back, Igor felt comforted by the sound of Victor's heartbeat. Igor pulled away a little and looked into Victor's eyes, \"Stay with me?\" Victor nodded and Igor released him, after Victor blew out some of the candles, He then got under the covers with Igor. Feeling warm and safer than he'd ever been, Igor quickly fell asleep. *** It was cold even with Henry shielding him, Victor wished he hadn't wanted to go out and play in the snow. They were going to die and it was all his fault. But Victor had survived, but so many days he wished he hadn't and he knew his father no doubt wished the same. No matter what Victor did he always felt so cold. One night Igor found him shaking and huddling by a fire, it was almost summer so there was no need for a fire. \"Victor?\" Igor asked concerned. Victor looked up, his brown eyes filled with anguish and reliving a terrible memory. \"The wind is so cold, the snow won't stop coming, and we're going to die!\" Igor sat next to him, \"Victor, you're all right, whatever happened was a long time ago, and you're safe with me.\" Victor began to sob and Igor held him as Victor had done for him two months earlier. Soon Victor's tears stopped, \"Don't leave me alone.\" \"I won't,\" Igor promised. That night they slept together again, sharing warmth and the safety of each others arms. They were two men haunted by their own demons but as long as they had each other they could keep them at bay. *** AN2: I hate that after you write out a fic exactly the way it was in your head, you're looking at the finished product and it feels like it didn't turn out the way you wanted.

I'm not one to believe in magic but after watching Victor Frankenstein it sure felt like I was watching magic! Anyway, this was an idea that would't leave. Title from lyrics in Fall Out Boy \"The Last of the Real Ones.\" Hope you like! Lorelei stared at Igor positive she was just imagining all this; hoping she was. She raised her hand to massage her temple and forehead simultaneously the classic sign of a headache beginning. Igor's face was the picture of despair. In his hands a piece of paper shook gently as he was unable to calm his trembling fingers. \"I-I can't not go, Lorelei,\" he said haltingly feeling so many conflicting emotions swirl within him. In the circus he would never have imagined he was capable of feeling this much, like his heart was being shorn in two. The paper had found its way to Igor and was a cry for help. Igor had been unable to know what to make of it and Lorelei had summed it up as madness. It had struck Igor like a lightning bolt. Victor was losing his mind; maybe he had always been losing his mind. Lorelei had been surprised that the thought had never occurred to Igor before. He had honestly always thought Victor was just Victor, the thought of him being a madman had never entered his mind as a possibility. Lorelei had sighed and whispered in his ear it was because he had such a pure heart and was so innocent still. He had lived with Lorelei for just a little over a year. A letter had come every month from Victor at first then abruptly stopped after seven months. Igor had replied to every letter beforehand and even sent several requesting to know if he was okay when he stopped getting replies. He had finally received his answer and it was \"most definitely not okay\" if one read between the scribblings on the last letter. Lorelei stood in the hallway, in her dress and her hair up in a tight updo. As always she looked lovely. She waited until Igor's eyes met hers. \"You know you don't owe him anything, Igor.\" Igor pursed his lips and his brows drew together. \"We've talked about this before,\" he mumbled. It took everything in him not to breakdown. Lorelei had already witnessed one breakdown since the letter arrived, did she want to see another? \"I just want to make sure this is what you truly want, Igor,\" Lorelei explained her intentions softly. \"I just don't want you to regret this later.\" Igor exhaled a shaky sigh. \"I can't not go Lorelei. You know I love you. You know that.\" Lorelei nodded and he went on, \"but you also know that I-I love Victor and I can't just not go to help him.\" It was Lorelei's turn to sigh. \"Can't he just find someone else to care about him this much? It's not like it has to be you.\" Igor laughed but there was little humor in it. \"Who? Who would, Lorelei? He doesn't even love himself.\" Lorelei smiled sadly at this. \"Yes, he scares most women and children and angers most men. I just wish he didn't have such power over you, Igor.\" Igor shook his head. \"No, the power balance is different. In our relationship you have such power over me. In relationship to Victor, it might not seem it but I'm the one that has power over him.\" Igor looked back down at the letter then back at Lorelei. \"I can bring him back to reality.\" \"What if you can't?\" \"I can.\" \"I want a family, Igor, I can't just wait.\" \"I know. You know I don't want you to wait.\" Lorelei's eyes filled with tears. \"Why do you think I have power over you, Igor? You're the one breaking my heart right now. You're choosing him over me.\" Igor quickly closed the gap between them. \"No, no, I just know that you're strong, Lorelei, you're so strong,\" he said hugging her close. \"I know you will be fine. You will find someone else so easily and you will have a proper family and be so happy! And I will be so happy for you!\" Lorelei was crying quietly on his shoulder now listening to him speak, trying to freeze this moment in time forever. She could not change his mind. She knew she wouldn't. He had been upfront with her from the beginning. He loved her and he loved Victor. It had been Victor who had left Igor in her care, she had no doubt Igor would have followed Victor to the ends of the earth if he hadn't suddenly vanished in a surprising fit of compassion, gracing her with his first letter to his partner. She hadn't realized how deep their relationship had been but Igor was still so full of innocence. She was surprised he realized how much power he actually had over Victor. She had hoped he wouldn't have realized. However, she was also surprised that he didn't comprehend that Victor also had power over him. Why hadn't she saved him when they'd been in the circus together? Would that change things then? Would he have chosen to follow her instead? \"What about you?\" Lorelei asked. \"Don't you want a family?\" Igor struggled to answer the question as he had the last couple days since the letter had come in. They had played this scene out more than once. Now was the first time that Igor had actually packed things and was about to vanish through that door, likely forever. Lorelei wanted to leave nothing to chance, to make sure this was the right thing to do; to let him leave. She had put up a fight but there was no way for her to unravel the fierce loyalty Igor felt to Victor. Such fierce loyalty she felt surely stemmed from Victor freeing him from the circus. She felt bitterness towards Victor; he had saved Igor, he had freed Igor but Igor himself didn't seem to fully grasp the concept of being free. His loyalty to Victor would always keep him on a short leash. He would never not go to Victor. Igor finally responded to her question. \"I don't know.\" Lorelei knew he didn't mind either way. She did and it hadn't been for lack of trying. She wasn't sure if it was something that had been done to them at the circus or elsewhere but they hadn't been able to procreate. It upset her much more than him; she knew he was being honest when he said he would be so happy for her to have a family. The question he asked next was laced with true humor. \"You can always come with me.\" She laughed and pulled out of their hug, playfully hitting him on the shoulder. \"Victor scares people! He is not right in the head, Igor.\" Her tone lost the laughter that had been there a moment before. \"And I am not the best at sharing.\" Igor nodded. \"I know.\" Another tight smile graced Lorelei's lips even as silent tears fell off her face, her eyes lighting up dimly with sad acceptance. \"I will try to be as strong as you think I am.\" \"You are,\" he insisted. \"You're one of the strongest people I've met. That's why…\" \"Why you're leaving and going to him,\" she finished with a nod. \"I'm so so-\" Igor started but was cut off. \"Don't you dare apologize. If you apologize, I might think you don't want to go to him.\" Igor grinned. \"I just wish there was a way I could have you both.\" \"I wish there was a way we could both have you but I draw the line at Victor or anyone else and I'm sure he draws the line at me.\" She paused. \"Or anyone else.\" Igor stared at her, the realization finally hitting him that this was it. \"Well, go, Igor, go and save the maddest man alive,\" she said, her hands making the shooing motion so he'd leave. \"I love you,\" he said. \"I love you, too. And good-bye.\" Igor turned and left through the door, feeling one weight lift off his shoulders and another bear down on his heart. His feelings for Lorelei had tears dropping off his face before he reached road. He never turned back, he knew Lorelei would chase him if she saw his tears. He waited until he had turned around before allowing his tears to well up in his eyes and fall out. His other feelings made him feel like he was soaring; he would get to see Victor again! He always knew he would and he suspected both Lorelei and Victor knew this also. Both had said more than once that he was innocent or too pure. He still didn't quite grasp what they meant and he wondered if he ever would. Another feeling had snaked its way through all the other feelings and that was pure dread. How would Victor respond when he saw him? Igor had been so confident in front of Lorelei that he could rescue his partner. The truth was he didn't know if he could. He loved Victor but had little understanding of what was going on in the other man's mind unless it was related to experiments or the parts of a body. And the bizarre gibberish in the letter only cemented the fact that he still had little understanding of the being that was Victor. The man had said more than once that he had created Igor. Igor understood that he had been rescued and Lorelei insisted that the Igor of today had always been present in the circus, just needed some help to get free. If Victor hadn't rescued him would he still be in the circus? This question plagued Igor more than he would like to admit. No one had rescued him before, it was a safe bet that anyone rescuing him later would be unlikely. It was little wonder Victor thought of him as his own creation. Igor could only hope that a creation was capable of saving the creator. ","Summary":" Author's Note: So Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy are no longer allowed on screen together.

The Castle Erskine was always quietest before dawn. It seemed to be the only time Victor could get a thought in sideways that didn't have to do with Finnegan's project or Finnegan himself. He made his way to the liquor cabinet, but as Victor poured himself a glass of whisky, he looked at the sleeping form he'd left behind. Finnegan. The man had consumed his mind by day with this project… with this Prometheus. And he made use of Victor's body in the night, when they shoved each other against walls and trailed bruising kisses over each other's bodies. Finnegan was a demanding, whimpering lover. But Victor… Victor was insatiable; hungry for something Finnegan could never give him, even if he consented to try. In the small hours before sunrise, Finnegan was not the one consuming Victor's mind. He wasn't thinking of monsters or medicine. He was instead thinking of a man. He instead thought of Igor. Igor with his perfect, surgeon's hands. Igor with his brilliant smile and innocent blue eyes that had always looked at Victor as if Igor believed in him. Until of course the day they parted. I created you. He was no God, looking upon Adam in divine triumph. He was Pygmalion, in love with something he'd carved and molded. And like Pygmalion, Victor knew his Galatea – his Igor – would remain unmoved by his longing. There was no divine intervention that would make Igor love him… and if there was, Victor was beyond hope of having his prayers heard. He always had been. See how far you get with your acrobat and your morals and your new life. Victor should have known from the start that Igor would not love him back. His heart belonged to another to that damned acrobat. To Lorelei. The fallen angel. And that knowledge burned. It made Victor ache with jealousy unlike any he'd ever known. He didn't care that she was superstitious or uneducated; he cared that she, unworthy thing, was the one Igor craved above all others. It didn't matter what Victor had done for him; Igor had loved Lorelei longer and would love her always, leaving Victor quite alone with these feelings. I'm done with you. Victor drained the contents of his glass quickly and stared out the window. Cold fingers found his bared arms and he jolted in surprise. \"Awake already?\" Finnegan drawled in Victor's ear. \"You know; I'm beginning to think you never tire…\" Victor laughed and set down the glass. He couldn't conceal the disgust upon his face for a long moment before he turned around to face his benefactor… his accidental lover. For the fleetest of moments, he could pretend that Finnegan's blue eyes were Igor's. That his grasping hands were Igor's. That his lips as Victor clashed against him with fierce and desperate lust were Igor's. \"I could be… persuaded to come back to bed,\" Victor said, breaking away. \"If you made it worth my while.\" Finnegan chuckled and the illusion was gone. This was not Igor. This would never be Igor. This would never be love or even proper lust. It was a dangerous business transaction between ruthless men. The gleam in Finnegan's eyes may have held desire, but there was something more terrifying there. Control. Victor could drive as hard a bargain as he wanted but at the end of the day, Finnegan owned him. And worst of all, Victor didn't care. Finnegan could have his mind. He could have his plans for the Prometheus. He could even have his body on nights like these when the both craved some kind of release. But Victor's heart – no, that wasn't right – Victor's soul, if indeed there was such a thing, belonged to another. So perhaps that was why Finnegan, fatigued from exertion twenty minutes later, didn't protest when Victor murmured two syllables as he reached his own, gratifying peak. \"Igor…\" Perhaps Finnegan didn't care for souls. Maybe he didn't believe in them – Victor wasn't sure that he did either. Or maybe Finnegan just didn't want Victor's soul. He had everything else he could possibly desire. Victor was building him a man… an army. Victor was indebted to him… enslaved by him. Why would Finnegan give a damn about Victor's affections when he had everything he needed already? Feelings, messy things, complicated otherwise perfect business transactions. And that's all this was. All any of this was. Business. Even the sex was business. A demonstration of loyalty… of Victor's ability to follow orders. Victor rolled onto his side, pulling out of Finnegan, who was murmuring in his half-asleep state things like \"Brilliant… Good man… Bloody brilliant…\", and looked at the sun rising over the tumultuous sea. He wondered if somewhere outside of London, Igor was sleeping beside Lorelei, blissfully oblivious to the remorse Victor felt for their parting. But… he dared to hope that somewhere outside of London, Igor was awake beside his acrobat, watching the sun rise and murmuring his name softly. \"Victor.\" For a moment, he thought he imagined Igor's voice. But then he realized that the only thing he'd heard was Finnegan sighing in his sleep before wrapping himself around a pillow and holding it tightly. Victor laughed softly, sadly, before swinging his legs over the side of the bed and crushing his face in his palms. Morning had come and he had work to do. He rose and dressed for the day and didn't spare a second glance at the bed he left behind. He couldn't. Not with the knowledge that when he looked, he would only be disappointed by who was not there and who, instead, was. He had a man to build… One that would hopefully never drive him into the arms of another. This time, when he created in his own image, Victor would not let himself be broken. No one would ever have that power again. Not Igor, not Finnegan, and certainly not a stitched together creature of his own design. He was broken already. There was nothing left to break.

The heat that builds in the meticulous mind of the man with his chalk, ink, and pens, papers that lay scattered amongst the hardwood floor. His eyes are heavy, but it doesn't click in his mind that he should sleep. Work is profound, it's what drives him, makes his life feel more real with the purpose that defines it. He can't stop, even if his heart is pained with failure, or the headaches pounding at his temples, or if someone has the audacity to interrupt and not listen to his scientific ramblings. This is what gives him reason to build, and construct, to find the loopholes in life that can change the future in all its terrible destruction. Even if there's a bit of selfishness tugging inside, the part of him that wants this to work, and to prove everyone wrong. Everyone who looked at him and told him to stop constructing his dream of the future, the strange ways in which it could change the foundations of this slow progression. He just had to make it work. \"This isn't about trying to find the placement of the set of hearts… or lungs,\" Victor murmurs to himself, scribbling out his diagram before grabbing another set. Before he began, he noted the silence of his partner, the ambition that settled on Igor's tongue when he agreed with Victor, made his empty part whole, gave him incite in the ways that their experiments could work. Usually they sank in defeat when they lost pieces they needed, body parts that Victor sometimes returns to the flat with, spouting out nonsensical excuses so Igor won't figure out where he really got them from. Igor isn't stupid, and Victor doesn't relay the information if Igor doesn't confront him on the subject. That's where their boundary of ignorance begins, a compromise that would surely hunt them down in the future, but the present is what Victor is truly fixated on. The present that would grant him completion of his future projects, crafted from his dreams. Victor drops his pen and tilts his head, lying flat on his arms while looking at Igor's sleeping face. The bones protruded against his thin chalky skin as if they were trying to escape Igor's warm flesh that was once abused. A sickness in survival, of loneliness and starvation for complete utter elation that Victor handed to him in exchange for help and companionship. His lips parted, breathing evenly, unknowingly peaceful that it calms Victor down, dampens his wild thoughts as he moves closer. Their bodies touching just slightly as he wraps and arm through Igor's and pulls him against his chest. Igor mutters something that Victor couldn't comprehend as he nuzzles his face in Igor's hair. His creation, built from that abandoned place that tried to ruin him, hands that drew upon parchment of ideas spilling from his brilliant mind. How dare those people insult a man like Igor, humiliate and shove him to the ground with no idea that Igor was one of a kind in a sea of millions. He was grateful that he could meet a man like Igor, that in the loneliness of his flat that was filled with his machinery and inventions, Igor made it all seem more than it was when he was alone. Victor closed his eyes, pressing Igor tighter until he felt the thudding of Igor's heart against his own. His creation made whole, a success in so many ways. He prided on Igor to stay the way he is, alive and well, close to Victor's proximity, where he could hear Igor's voice, his thoughts on the inventions, the only one who understood as much as Victor himself. A kindred spirit so vast and rare, he would be an idiot to let this particular person go to waste in the world. Victor slept with those thoughts that pooled in the recesses of his mind. He dreamed of storms and a howling sea, Igor in the midst of lightning, blood sank to the rough wet stone as something heavily built with clammy skin stepped in the light of the shattering sky. He jolted awake once Igor's body tumbled to the ground, face streaked with blood, and no life glinted from his eyes. Victor sat up, heart beating in his chest as he looked to his right to find Igor with a chalk in his hand, drawing the diagram he had abandoned. The paper was filled by Igor's writing, while the larger diagram of their creation was barely set in the wood. Brows furrowed, he dropped the chalk and crawled toward him. \"Are you okay?\" Always so patient, vulnerable for Victor's well being. He made him smile, even when the dream unsettled him. \"I'm fine,\" he said, getting to his feet and stretching his arms. \"Coffee?\" \"Should be done soon,\" Igor said, smiling, unaware as Victor pulled him into an embrace he couldn't repress. \"Victor?\" Igor said into his shoulder after a long moment, \"are you okay?\" \"I'm fine,\" he repeated, breathing in chalk and the lingering scent of coffee grounds in Igor's hair. Igor relaxed against Victor. \"If I known you were going to have a nightmare, I would have stayed sleeping with you.\" Victor grinned, pulling back and admiring his young creation. \"No, it's good you woke before me and started on the diagram. I'd stay on that floor with you in my arms, avoiding work for your comfort, my dear friend.\" He tapped the tip of Igor's nose. \"Better work than comfort,\" Igor said, something Victor knew was true, once before when he was alone. He'd choose work over the affection of others, he did not care to be liked, to relish friendship when in truth the friends he'd make would be nothing but tools for his creations. Thrown away when they served their purpose. He knew it was cruel, but all in the name of a grand future, Victor would destroy anyone to get what he wants. He turned and walked straight to Igor; taking his arm before Igor could crouch down and start on the diagram. His brows furrowed, brought back on his feet. \"Victor?\" Victor smiled, bits of the wall where he shoved all unnecessary feelings were beginning to crack. \"Let's go out.\" \"What about the diagram, we're not done,\" Igor said as Victor dragged him toward the the door. \"We'll get back to it, Igor,\" Victor said, letting his emotions breathe as that wall crumbled inside of him, \"right now, I'm thinking some place fancy…maybe secluded. A book store, or even one of those small coffee shops, a place with a table and minimum people.\" He grabbed his coat and notebooks, pen clipped on the side. Igor followed after with his own coat \"And the coffee?\" \"It'll be here when we return,\" Victor said, holding the door open. \"It'll be cold.\" \"Good deduction, let's go,\" Victor said as Igor passed under his arm with a raised brow. Victor did not look back when he closed the door, he let his emotions spin inside of him, all those reasoning's simmer under the weight for the affection toward his friend. An affection he did not name, but acknowledged as something profound as his work and he would honor it and understand it, and he would continue to work at it as much as he worked on their creation. One day soon both will come to fruition, all it takes is ambition and work to realize a dream. fin. Notes: My summary got a bit descriptive than usual. :/ Don't mind that. Hehe~ Anyway, I only watched Victor Frankenstein once, and skimmed the second time. I enjoy Victor's fierce ambition, his tactless way of wanting to prove to people that his work is the future, and that he's desperate and passionate. I love this character a lot. Igor is similar, such a different variation that he holds Victor together in all his steep declarations of madness and brilliance. I don't think I portrayed it as well, but I was in a writing mood and I wanted to write this story. :) I do ship them, and unfortunately there aren't many fics of them, but oh wells.

It was the same one I came to on nights that I couldn't sleep, which for the last three years had been more of a certainty then it had a probability.

They would get to make it to their home, a place called Homestead two, a new planet where they could colonize and start fresh. \"Inka, what are you doing down here?\" I turned, my mother was scrunching her still wet blonde curls into a towel. \"Come on.\" She said, staring at the pod and then back at me. \"You shouldn't be down here sweetie.\" She reached for my hand and with a smile I took it, allowing her to lead me upstairs. \"I have a surprise for you.\" She squealed, a red delight kissing her cheeks. Today was my birthday. I know, I should be more excited, right? Like my mother is, and always was when it came to my birthday, but for me it was a day that will always haunt me and ping sparks against my chest. It was on this day, three years ago, that my dad; Jim Preston died. When we finally made it upstairs Arthur, the robot who ran the bar here, smiled at me from across the table. \"Always a pleasure Miss Inka.\" He smiled and took my hand and laid a small kiss to it, then the same to my mother. He just stared at the space between us and then smiled. \"Oh, Miss Inka, how you look like your mother.\" There were a lot of things I shared with my mother. We both had blonde hair, though, despite my mother's outrage two years ago, I had chosen to do lavender tips to it, and we both had brown eyes. I turned back to her, studying her face, the fine lines that pressed against them with coming age, but still, despite that she was still beautiful. \"Thank you, Arthur.\" I responded before taking my seat in front of him. \"A jack and coke Arthur.\" My mother said politely as she took a seat next to me. \"Actually Arthur.\" I turned when my ears caught the glint of mischief streaming from her voice. \"Make it two.\" She said holding two fingers up and smiling at me while her head cocked to the side. Arthur looked at me and then pushed himself closer to my mother. \"But Miss Aurora, I can't. She's under age. I would lose my job.\" My mom tsked and shook her head. \"Come on Arthur, who's gonna tell? We are literally the only two humans awake on this ship.\" \"Yes, but mam, it's not the point. It's the principle.\" My mother nodded, and rose with her tongue pressed against her cheek. \"Will you give us a moment darling?\" I nodded. I knew better than to say no to my mother when she got that tone. That tone meant trouble, and I was happy, for once not to be on the other side of that. I turned away, pretending not to listen to their conversation. \"Arthur, this is all she has. All she will ever have.\" \"Yes, mam, but.\" \"But nothing.\" She called back to him. \"I don't want Inka to be deprived. She's a good girl, a sweet girl, and she deserves a treat on her birthday. I'm not going to get her drunk Arthur. Just one drink.\" \"Come on Arthur.\" She said after a few seconds of silence. \"You promised.\" \"Yes mam.\" He replied in a steel tone. \"Yes, I did.\" I pretended to come out of a trans when my mom and Arthur returned. \"Surprise.\" She said, cradling the drink in her hand and then urging me to mine. \"I thought you would like to try this. It's good, and I think you'll like it.\" I laughed a little. I couldn't help but notice that my drink was served in a much smaller glass than my mothers and that it was only about half full anyway. Silly paranoid Arthur. I picked up the cold glass and clinked it with my mothers. \"Happy Birthday Sweetie.\" She said. \"Thank you, mother.\" I said before taking the first burning chug of alcohol. My mother was wrong. So, wrong. I hated it, but I wasn't going to tell her that. I didn't want to hurt her feelings. \"What did you think?\" She said placing her still half full glass onto the counter. \"It was fine.\" I said, pushing the class in front of Arthur, who eagerly took it and looked around to see if anyone had seen what had happened. \"Just fine?\" My mom said with a laugh. \"Honey, it's ok if you hated it. You can tell me.\" I shook my head and allowed one tear to cascade softly down my cheek. \"Honey.\" She said as she rubbed my back. \"What's wrong?\" I turned to my mother, seeing the empty void that filled her brown eyes. I wanted to tell her. I wanted her to know what I had done, but I was afraid. So, afraid. \"I did it. Or I tried to.\" I said, forcing my face to turn away from her. \"Did what?\" I cringed when I heard the screeching teeth clenching sound that tore from her. \"But it didn't work. I think something went wrong.\" \"Inka. Just tell me.\" I took a deep breath and turned back to her. \"I tried to wake him. Adam Torrens.\"[Chapter 2] At young age my parents always taught me respect for the pods, and respect for the lives that were inside of them. So, it made sense when I looked up and saw fire spilling across her face over to me. \"How could you do this?\" She said, rising and clenching her hands on the sides of her. Except she didn't understand. She didn't know why. \"Mom, please just listen.\" I said, wrapping my fist around her arm. She shoved out of my hold but faced me. \"How dare you? How dare you take that choice away from someone?\" \"Mom, it didn't work.\" I said, opening my arms in a surrendering gesture. \"It doesn't matter.\" She said, throwing her hands to the top of her head. \"Those pods, if they become damaged or tampered with they can kill. I've seen it Inka.\" I closed my eyes, and remembered the story that my mom used to tell me about Chief Gus Mancuso. He was chief deck officer of the Avalon, and had died several years earlier from a malfunction with one of the pods. She marched past me and made her way to the elevator. \"Mom, please wait.\" She crossed her arms around her chest and glared at me, and I found my words carelessly leaving me before I had a chance to stop them. \"Mom, he's a match.\" She threw her arm in between the two shutting doors. \"Honey, what are you talking about?\" I took a deep breath, allowing the words that I had cradled inside of me to stretch, giving room for it to flow out of me. \"He's a match, for dad.\" She regarded me for a moment with a piercing gaze and then grabbed my arm and pulled me inside. She didn't speak, until she pushed the button and we zoomed down frantically. \"Honey, dad's dead. You know this.\" She wouldn't even look at me, and when I tried to cup her face to turn to me she pushed away. \"But we could save him. We can take Adam's heart and replace dad's.\" \"Inka, what you have done. What you are doing.\" \"It's to save dad.\" I said, cutting off her words. \"Maybe we can save him, maybe we can't, but we have to try.\" \"Your father never wanted that.\" She said, finally turning her cold stare to me. \"He was ready. He was suffering. He wanted to go.\" \"Yea, but I wasn't ready to lose him.\" I said, as I threw my arms up. \"I'm still not.\" I started to shake, I was trying to clot off the tears that were rising from deep within me, but they just wouldn't stop. \"Do you know every year, every time I turned a year older I didn't think about what kind of future I would have, because I knew that one day I would end up alone.\" I was aware of the air between us lightening, her previous anger dulling down to small thuds against my skin. \"Inka, sweetie. There's something I need to tell you.\" But she was cut off as we arrived down into the chamber with the resting. I wanted to call out to her, but my lungs just wouldn't allow anything else to escape but small gulps of breath when I ran after her. I couldn't get over sometimes, at her age, how physically fit my mom was. We arrived over to Adam Torren's pod. I watched as his chest lifted, but it was straining, caught up in the heavy mouthfuls of air that he drew. She pulled out her ID badge, the one that Gus had given her before he died. She waved it in front of his pod. \"Computer, on my authority badge #2243 do a health scan on Adam Torrens.\" After a few moments, the computer spoke, vibrating through the room. 'To do a health scan patient must be in infirmary pod.' She swore into the air as she pressed buttons and the screen flashed red. Finally, giving up she slammed her fists against the pexiglass. \"What do we do?\" I said, in a small voice. \"You go back upstairs.\" She said to me as she reached for a slab on the floor. Pulling it up she exposed the controls for the pod. \"What are you doing?\" She turned to me again her teeth bared down. \"Inka Rose. I said go upstairs.\" \"No, mom please. I did this, and I want to help.\" Her body sagged and then looked between him and I. \"Fine, but you let me do all the talking.\" She focused her eyes back onto the controls then rose when the air within his tube sucked back into the vents. His chest lifted for a moment then collapsed as the pod opened. She pulled me down, forcing me to follow her. \"You just agree with everything I'm saying.\" She spoke, barely above a whisper. \"Whatever I tell him you back me up.\" Her face wrinkled with a sharp determination. \"Got it?\" I nodded, and rose when she gave me the nonverbal ok. 'Hello Adam.' The computer spoke to him as his consciousness broke through. \"What? Where am I?\" 'You are on board the starship Avalon. It's perfectly normal to be confused.' \"Who are you?\" He said turning to us. My mom pushed herself in front of me and stretched out her hand to him. \"Hello Mr. Torrens. My name is Aurora Lane. I am the medical officer aboard this ship.\"[Chapter 3] Chapter#3 \"What? Is something wrong?\" My mom stiffened her posture and placed her arms behind her after releasing his hand. \"Mr. Torrens, there was a malfunction with your pod. You woke up 72 years too early. We have to do a health scan to make sure your health isn't compromised.\" \"Well that explains a lot.\" He said as he examined himself in the reflection of the mirror extended towards him. \"A man needs his beauty sleep.\" \"And who is she?\" He said his green eyes floating over to me. I opened my mouth to speak, but my mom cut off my words before they hit the air. \"She doesn't speak.\" I withdrew my extended hand and placed it behind me. I didn't even know the computer was still speaking until it drew from the heavy silence. 'I am going to escort you to your room Mr. Torrens.' \"Well, if you'll excuse me ladies.\" He said with a nod. \"You better not take me to the wrong room.\" He joked to the computer just as he disappeared down the hall. \"Mom, what are you doing?\" I said grabbing her once I was sure he was out of ear shot. \"I'm protecting you.\" \"But Mom, he's not dangerous.\" \"You don't know that Inka.\" She rubbed at her temples and then turned back to me. \"Not everything that is dangerous can physically hurt you.\" \"What does that even mean?\" I said with an unintentional sarcastic undertone. \"It means that I don't want him knowing you were a part of this.\" She reached her hands out to touch my shoulders. \"Honey, I came down here sometimes too. I saw the way you looked at him.\" She turned down the hall and then back to me. \"And I saw the way he looked at you, just now. Your father used to look at me that way when we first met.\" She wiped at a stray tear that glazed her face and then cleared her throat to steady her voice. \"When I found out your father woke me we fought. For nearly a year. We almost lost a lifetime in that fight.\" A smile tugged against her lips when she continued. \"And if we wouldn't have ended up together we would have never had you, and you are my greatest joy baby girl.\" She wrapped her arms around me and played with my hair. \"I love you Inka. Please, trust me on this.\" I nodded when she released me. \"OK Mom.\" \"Good.\" She said as a sigh of relief lifted her voice. \"Now we should try to get some sleep. We will do a scan on him tomorrow.\" \"But mom, how are we going to get him back to sleep?\" She turned her head, but wouldn't pivot her body back to me. \"You let me worry about that Inka. Good night baby.\" \"Good night mom.\" She threw a wave before making her way down the hall. I was going to go to bed, but I wanted to say goodnight to dad first. His body was in the chapel wing of the ship. We used to go there on Sundays, well actually on whatever day we picked for the week. Since leaving earth both of my parents had lost track of which day was which, but after my father died my mom stopped coming. So, I came by myself. I made my way inside and took my usual seat at the front, facing my father's casket pod. \"Hey dad.\" I couldn't hear him, but I know he was listening. I could hear him the silence, the memories that flooded through me gave me comfort. It was like he was still talking to me, through a place in my past. \"I'm so sorry.\" I said, placing my hand against my heavy chest. \"I know I promised you a way, a way to save your life.\" Heavy sobs ripped from deep in my chest, igniting a full-on rampage of hot tears that barely had time to cool before they escaped my eyes. \"But I can't do it. Dad I'm so afraid.\" I moaned into a fresh tissue. I turned when I felt a cool hand dress my shoulder. \"Well for someone that doesn't speak you sure had a lot to say.\" I turned, in horror as Adam's porcelain face smiled at me.[Chapter 4] Chapter#4 I wiped at my face and cleared my scratchy vocal cords with a cough. \"How long have you been standing there?\" \"Eh, probably about five seconds longer than you wanted me to be.\" His eyes trailed to the side, watching me expectantly with a smile. \"So, what's your deal?\" \"My deal?\" \"Yea.\" He said with a shrug. \"Let's start with your name. Since you already know mine.\" I watched his marble hand come towards me. I reached for it, but then pulled back quickly. \"It's better you don't know me. You're going to be going back to sleep soon. So, what's the point?\" He pulled his hand away, clenching at the empty air. \"What about you? Aren't you going to sleep too?\" The bitter truth tore through every bit of my body, escaping out of my throat. \"Like I said, you're going back to sleep. You don't need to know me.\" \"Well, I'd like to.\" He was kind, and witty, and he seemed sweet, charming even, but I didn't want to hurt him. We weren't meant to know each other, not in this lifetime. \"Why, why do you want to know me?\" He shrugged his shoulders and sank his back against the pew. \"I guess I just want to talk to you. It seems like Dr. Lane does a lot of it for you.\" I watched as he ran his fingers through his blonde hair. \"Though I really would like to take you out to dinner, or whatever constitutes a date on this ship.\" \"Well Mr. Torrens I'm afraid that's not possible.\" I rose on sturdy legs and walked out without bothering to turn back. The next day I woke up and made my way out to the cafeteria. My mom was there, already halfway done with her breakfast. \"Good morning sweetie.\" She said with a warm smile. \"Hey mom.\" As soon as I sat in front of her she wiped at her mouth and walked over to the ordering booth. Since I was not an original passenger my parents had to order all my meals for me. It liked it when my mom got my food though. She was gold status, meaning she had access to a lot of the things my dad hadn't. Like pumpkin flavored coffee. Yum. \"Here you go.\" She placed the tray in front of me and smiled. \"Thanks.\" Two minutes later Adam Torrens walked in. \"So, this is where they stashed the food?\" He said with a laugh. I smiled beneath a mouthful of hot eggs and watched as he placed his order, with the help of my mom. It surprised me to see when he sat down that he was a gold member too, perhaps his family was wealthy or something, he seemed far too young to have a kind of job that would finance it. \"Well here's to the first day of my journey in space.\" He said, holding up a glass of orange juice and clinking it with ours. \"Adam, if you don't mind me asking how are you gold status?\" I turned away, attempting to dodge the daggers that shot from my mom's eyes. \"Well.\" He said after taking a sip of his juice. \"It was part of the make a wish foundation.\" I turned back to my mom and squinted and then back to Adam. \"Oh, you're not familiar?\" He said, looking at the space between us. \"It's a program for sick kids. Like me.\" I sure as heck wasn't going to ask what he was sick with, but he was all too happy to answer, using the beckoning silence to do so. \"Cancer.\" He said with a jolt. \"I have cancer.\" We basked in the silence until my mom cleared her throat. \"I'm sorry to hear that Adam.\" \"It's ok.\" He said with a smile. \"Today is a good day.\" He then turned to me and winked. \"A very good day.\" \"That's actually how I was able to get a ride on here.\" He continued. \"My parents too.\" \"Your family is on this ship too?\" He nodded and dabbed at his mouth. \"Yea, after I found out I was sick my family and I wanted to start over. Somewhere new, but my mom, being the extremist she is thought that another planet would be better than a new address.\" I felt sorry for him. I knew that he had put up a good front with humor and charm, but I could see it in the backlash of his face, the wrinkles from fighting the sadness that etched there. I felt like I was drowning in my own guilt. I woke up a kid with cancer to take his heart. I had to get out of there. I ran out without another word and made my way to the elevator. I needed some air. \"Inka.\" I heard my mother call to me. I ignored her, listening to the echo of beats that pumped from my chest. \"Inka Preston, you get back here now.\" Her tone pressed against my brain, pleading with my eyes to turn back to her, but I wouldn't. I couldn't. I pressed the bottom several times until the door finally closed right on my mother's face. I sank down onto the ground and drug my fingers through my hair and squeezed against my scalp. I'm a monster. I rose once I found the strength to after crying for what felt like hours. I made it to the third floor where the infirmary was. Maybe there was something there I could take, maybe a pill or something for anxiety. I walked up and reached at the hand print that opened the door. 'Access Denied. Medical personnel needed.' \"Son of a bitch.\" I yelled, slamming my fists against the door. That's when I heard a soft voice next to me. \"Inka, honey, what are you doing?\" My mother reached out and grabbed me, pulling me into her space. That's when everything spilled over. Every emotion I had. I didn't think I could cry so much. \"Mom, what have I done?\" I continued to sob into her. She reached around me and ran her fingers through my hair. \"Baby, you made a mistake. It's ok. We will work this out.\" \"But how?\" I said with a muffled tone. I stared, watching the fight in her eyes, but looking at me the fight stopped, replaced by soft surrender. \"Honey, there's something I need to show you.\" She reached into the folds of her jacket and pulled out her ID card. She ushered her hand between me and the pod. I turned to the pod, but quickly shifted my eyes to her waiting for her to speak. \"We were going to wait to tell you until you were 21.\" She paused and pushed at the controls until she found what she wanted. I watched the screen intently, my eyes widening in shock. \"Your father found a way to put someone back to sleep. He offered it to me all those years ago, but I turned it down.\" She traced her fingers delicately over the pexi glass. \"On your twenty first birthday we were going to give you the choice, but the truth is I never wanted to show you this, because I knew what you would choose.\" She took a deep breath and her shoulders sagged as if a heavy weight lifted from her. \"But after Adam was awoken I realized I had to show you this now. I had to show you there was another way.\" She turned to me with a sad smile. \"But I'm afraid that the choice is no longer up to you. We have to use it on Adam.\" ","Summary":" My name is Inka Preston. I am eighteen years old riding my way through space on a journey home.

I do not own the rights to the movie. All credit for those sentences goes to the writers of the movie. \"Thank you so much for inviting me to spend Thanksgiving with you and your family,\" Eddie said as we got in the car to begin our journey back to my house. \"Of course. I don't want you spending Thanksgiving alone on campus,\" I responded shutting the car trunk. Eddie went to the side of the car and held open the car door for me. I couldn't help but smile. \"Thanks,\" I said getting into the car. Eddie walked around to the other side and got into the backseat with me. \"Thanks for taking us Billy,\" I said. Billy was a classmate who also lived in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. I didn't really know him that well, but he had offered to take me and Eddie back home if we helped pay for gas, which we had no problem doing so! \"Well, I was going this way anyway,\" he said starting up the car and turning on music. Eddie and I turned and smiled at each other. After we hit the interstate, the conversation in the car fell quiet. Billy was humming along to his music, he had his girlfriend up in the front seat and Eddie and I were in the back. \"So,\" Eddie began, not sure what to say. \"What?\" I said turning to him. \"Does your family know that I'm coming?\" he asked me. \"Um...not quite...\" I began. \"Is it okay that I'm coming?\" Eddie asked and appeared to be worried. \"I don't want to intrude.\" \"Yes, it's completely fine,\" I said reassuring him. \"My parents always tell me to bring home any friends who have to stay on campus for Thanksgiving break. They welcome guests,\" I said smiling. \"Okay,\" he said, relaxing slightly. \"Tell me about your family,\" he said. \"Well, I have my two brothers Mikey and Johnny. Mikey is two and a half years younger than me, and Johnny is my baby brother. He's still in high school. You already know that we live on a farm, and we have two family dogs- Spunky the black Labrador and Fresca the white spaniel.\" \"Jonny and Mikey,\" Eddie said repeating their names. \"I'm honestly kind of nervous about meeting them,\" he confided in me. \"Don't worry about it. They'll love you,\" I said. \"Are you taking him to meet your parents?\" Billy asked me. \"Yes,\" Eddie said. \"How long have you two been together?\" his girlfriend asked us. \"Oh no! It's not like that. We're just friends,\" I said quickly. The truth was I was really nervous about bringing Eddie since I was afraid that everyone would think we were together. And that wasn't the case. Eddie and I had shared a drunken kiss one night, but I insisted that it was just a drunken mistake. A few days later, Eddie had told me that he genuinely liked me and wanted to take me out on a date. I turned him down, explaining that I didn't want to get involved with anyone. I needed to focus on getting into medical school next fall, and I didn't want any distractions. Besides, I didn't like Eddie. Or did I? He was obviously very good looking, and I felt an attraction to him. However, I fought that attraction with all my might even though he had these beautiful blue eyes, blond hair, and this sexy accent and smile. I looked away from Eddie and looked out my side of the window. Maybe it wasn't a good idea to bring him home with me. Maybe I needed space from him to get over my little...or big...crush on him. I scolded myself and brought myself back to reality. A relationship between us wouldn't work out anyway. What would happen when we graduated, and he went back to Denmark and I went to medical school? It would be best to never begin any relationship and simply remain as friends. \"So, tell me about your family in Denmark,\" I said turning to him again. \"You never really mention them.\" Eddie hesitated for a second as though he was trying to collect his thoughts. Why was his family such a secret? \"Well, I have my parents and my little sister, Arabella,\" he said. \"How old is your little sister?\" I asked him. \"She's 12,\" he replied. \"I miss her a lot this semester. I try to FaceTime her a lot, but it's not the same.\" \"I'm sure she misses you too,\" I said smiling at him. \"How did you learn English?\" I asked him. \"Did your parents teach it to you or was it something taught in schools?\" \"The majority of Danes are actually bilingual and speak English. My parents spoke to me in English a lot, and they hired a private English tutor as well when I was a child,\" he explained. \"What do your parents do?\" I asked. Eddie hesitated before replying. What was with his family? Were they like part of the mafia or something? \"My mother was a stay-at-home mom, and my dad works for the government,\" he replied not giving much detail. As much as I wanted to press him, I didn't. He'd open up to me in due time. \"If I ever go to Denmark one day, you'll have to show me around,\" I said trying to break the awkward tension that suddenly filled the space between us. \"I'd like that very much,\" Eddie said sincerely, smiling at me, causing my heart to flutter. I wanted to learn forward and kiss him in the worst way. Stop it, Paige! I scolded myself. I had blamed my actions that one night on being drunk (I was the one who went and kissed him) but maybe I was more aware of my actions than I realized... We arrived at home, and my heart sped up a little bit. This was going to be the moment of truth. \"Are you ready?\" I asked Eddie. \"Now, you're making me nervous,\" he said, laughing. \"Sorry! Don't be,\" I said gently putting my hand on his arm. He looked at me surprised, and I slowly moved my hand back to my lap. Even just touching his arm made me feel all tingly. I shouldn't have brought him home. I had too big a crush on him. We pulled up, and Eddie got out of the car to open my door. Gosh, he was such a gentleman. As I got out of the car, my parents came out of the house. My face lit up, and I went running to great them. \"Mom!\" I said running to hug her. \"Dad!\" I exclaimed giving him a hug as well. \"Mom, dad, this is Eddie. Eddie's an exchange student from Denmark. He's just a friend,\" I explained, introducing them. I wanted to get the introductions over quickly as well as establish that he was just a friend. \"Hello,\" Eddie said extending his hand. \"It's very nice to meet you. We're happy that you could join us. The only college friends of Paige's that we have met have all been girls!\" My mother exclaimed. I couldn't help but roll my eyes at that last part. Of course my parents would mention that I never brought home any guy friends before from college. \"Well thank you. I am glad to be invited,\" Eddie said shaking my mom's hand. \"Eddie, Ben Morgan,\" my dad said shaking his hand. \"Hello Ben,\" Eddie said shaking it his hand. I breathed a sigh of relief. At least those introductions were over and they went well. \"Hey hey Doc Paige!\" My brother Johnny exclaimed coming over with Mikey from the barn. \"Farmer John and Mikey!\" I exclaimed running over to greet them as they walked over from the barn. \"Mike, you look great!\" I exclaimed, noticing that he lost weight. \"I've been doing slimfast...so you know...\" Mike began. \"And he put 5 pounds back on today!\" Johnny exclaimed! \"Boys,\" my mother interrupted and pointed to Eddie. \"Who's this guy?\" Johnny said. \"This is Eddie. He's an exchange student from Denmark. He's just a friend,\" I explained, emphasizing the friend part. \"Welcome to our home,\" Mike said loudly and slowly, shaking Eddie's hand. \"Thank you,\" Eddie said smiling. \"Mike, he speaks better English that you do,\" I said hitting him playfully. \"Well, we are going to get back to work. Hey, we are watching you Frenchie,\" Johnny said pointing to Eddie and walking away with Mikey. \"Let's go inside,\" my mother said walking inside. \"You can ignore the moron twins,\" I told him, gently squeezing his arm before we walked inside. I showed Eddie around the house, and then we went up to my room. \"This is it,\" I said as we entered. Eddie put my bags down by my bed. I began unpacking as Eddie began walking around my room. I closed my door slightly so we could have some privacy. It was an automatic reaction. Maybe I did really like him. \"What are all the pins for?\" Eddie asked, walking over to the map on my wall. \"The green ones are where I have been and the red ones are where I want to go,\" I stated. \"Ecuador, El Salvador...not exactly tourist destinations, are they?\" he asked me, confused. \"No, but that's where Doctor's Without Borders goes to provide medical care and clean water,\" I explained as Eddie looked at me slightly confused. \"What?\" I asked. \"Nothing. I've never met anyone as intimidating as you,\" he explained to me. \"Look at me,\" I said standing up straight. \"I'm not intimidating.\" \"That's honestly pretty intimidating to me,\" he told me. \"Well, I'm not the only with goals. What do you want to do?\" I asked him. \"I have no choice. I have to take over the family business,\" he said, obviously careful with his choice of words. \"No choice at all?\" I asked, confused sitting down on my bed. \"Yes,\" Eddie replied, sitting down on my favorite childhood stuffed animal. \"Careful! You're crushing Gus,\" I exclaimed, taking the stuffed animal. \"Gus?\" he asked, confused. \"Yes, he's a very good watch Moose. Not once was I attacked by a monster in my closet or under the bed,\" I said. \"Isn't that right Gus?\" \"Yes, that's right,\" I said, using Gus' voice. \"Hello Gus,\" Eddie said shaking his paw. \"Very nice to meet you.\" \"Very pleased to make your acquaintance as well,\" I said, using Gus' voice again. \"I like you like this,\" he said, looking at me. \"Like what?\" I asked. \"Just this. Just Paige,\" he told me looking into my eyes. We sat there and made eye contact for a few moments until my dad came into my room, ruining the moment. Eddie practically jumped up when he came in. \"Eddie, we have you all made up in Johnny's room. We sleep with the door open at night,\" he explained. \"Thanks, dad,\" I said giving my dad \"a look.\" What part of we are just friends did he not understand? I was dying from embarrassment. Eddie left with his bags and offered to help out at the farm tomorrow. I laid back down on my bed in frustration and in embarrassment. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to bring Eddie with me. Before I knew it, it was Thanksgiving Day. My entire family sat down to eat, and we all went around to express what we were thankful for. Eddie said that he was thankful for his new American friends. His words melted my mom's heart, and they melted mine as well. He was so sweet. \"So, Eddie, what's up between you and my sister?\" Johnny asked. \"Johnny!\" I scolded, putting down my wine class. \"Look, Paige, someone had to ask,\" Mikey replied. \"Yeah, Paige, he's too good looking,\" Johnny said. \"Yeah,\" Mikey agreed. \"That's right, I said it. You're too good looking,\" Johnny told Eddie. I put my hand in my head, hiding my face from embarrassment. \"I'm not that good-looking,\" Eddie replied. \"Yeah, he's pretty good looking,\" Mikey said to Johnny. \"You're pretty good-looking,\" my mother and aunt chimed in. \"Guys!\" I exclaimed. \"You combine that with the accent and your little Euro charm; you're a lethal combination,\" Mikey said to Eddie. \"Will everyone just stop, please!\" I exclaimed firmly, glaring at my brothers. I just wanted to go underneath the table and hide. I should I never brought Eddie back home. I could feel how hot my cheeks were from my blushing. \"Come on, Paige, we don't know anyone from Denmark. We've never heard of anyone from Denmark. Have you?\" Johnny asked. \"Yeah sure,\" I said cutting my turkey. My brothers were waiting for my answer, confident that I wouldn't be able to think of anyone. Finally, I asked Eddie for help. He named some historically famous people like Hans Christian Anderson, but my brothers weren't impressed. I heard them mumbling to each other about the people since they never heard of them. In desperation, Eddie mentioned Lars Ulrich from Metallica and Helena Christensen, the Victoria Secret model. Then, my brothers were impressed and commented that Denmark should be a super power, which caused us all to laugh. After dinner, I washed the dishes, Eddie volunteered to dry and the Johnny and Mikey, aka the moron twins, volunteered to put the clean dishes away and the left overs in the fridge. \"I'm sorry about my family giving you a hard time,\" I told Eddie, handing him another plate to dry. \"It's okay,\" he told me, smiling. After we finished cleaning up, we played card and board games as a family and then took a walk together. My parents retired early, my brothers wanted to watch a late night football game. Eddie was going to join them, but I said that I was going to watch a movie on my laptop. After hearing my decision, Eddie decided to join me. We went up to my room, and I sat down on my bed. At first, Eddie seemed unsure where to join me. I motioned for him to join me on my bed. I leaned up against the headboard, and he joined me on the other side. \"Are you sure your parents won't mind?\" he asked me. \"The door is 1/4 open, and we are on top of my bed. We aren't in it,\" I said laughing. Eddie seemed to relax slightly and leaned his back up against the headboard. \"So, what movie do you want to watch?\" I asked, logging into Netflix. \"Whatever you want to watch,\" he told me. \"I need a little help. Otherwise, I'll spend forever picking out a movie,\" I said laughing. I began scrolling through some titles and came across The Santa Clause with Tim Allen. \"How about this movie?\" I asked. \"I've never seen it, but it sounds good to me,\" Eddie replied. \"You've NEVER seen it!?\" I exclaimed. \"Then, we are watching it,\" I said loading it up on my laptop. As we got comfortable on my bed, Eddie was pretty close to me, but he made sure he wasn't touching me. However, it was close enough to make me nervous and feel butterflies in my stomach. We finished the movie, and I logged out of Netflix. \"It's getting late,\" I commented. \"I should probably shower. I'll get you some towels,\" I said starting to get up. \"Paige,\" Eddie said gently touching my arm. \"Yes?\" I asked sitting back down. \"Spending Thanksgiving with your family was incredible. Thank you so much for inviting me and allowing me to experience this American holiday in the most genuine way possible,\" he said sincerely. \"You're very welcome,\" I said smiling. \"I was happy to have had you here with me.\" My heart was beginning to race slightly. Eddie was slowly inching himself closer to me. \"When your father asked us what we were thankful for this year, I didn't have the courage then to mention that I am thankful for knowing you and for your friendship,\" he told me. \"You have made my stay here in the United States so much more pleasant. Thank you,\" he said getting slightly closer to me. My heart was pounding, I was making eye-contact with him, and I wasn't sure what to say or what to do. \"I'm thankful for your friendship as well,\" I said quietly, looking into his eyes and trying to figure out where he was going with this speech. \"Paige,\" he whispered, putting his hand on top of my hand. \"I wanted to let you know that I genuinely care for you,\" he said speaking in a normal tone. \"I don't expect you to return these feelings, but I just thought you had the right to know how I felt. I overheard you talking to Beth that you'll probably end up alone one day. That's so far from the truth. Any guy would be so incredibly lucky to call you his girl,\" he said emphasizing the words \"any\" and \"incredibly.\" \"You're an amazing woman, a determined woman. I admire you so much, and I lo...I really really like you,\" he told me, stopping himself from saying \"love.\" My heart practically stopped. Was he about to tell me that he loved me? I had NO idea what to do or what to say to him. I shouldn't have brought him home. He got the wrong idea about my intentions. I began to panic, but Eddie continued to speak. \"I don't expect you to return my feelings or say anything. I just wanted to let you know how I felt. You deserved to know,\" he said taking my hand, bringing it up to his lips and kissing it gently. My heart about stopped from the touch of his lips on my hand. I was so confused. Did I like him too? I knew I did, but I kept on convincing myself otherwise... Eddie got up and began to walk to the door. I couldn't let him walk out the door like that after he completely opened up his heart and shared his deepest emotions. \"Eddie, wait,\" I said as he stopped and turned around. I got up and walked over to him. \"I honestly don't know what to say,\" I told him as I approached him. \"You don't have to say anything,\" he told me. \"Just tell me this- do you feel anything for me?\" he asked. My heart was racing as I prepared my answer. Of course, I had feelings for him...very strong feelings for him. Should I tell him? Maybe it was just better to deny it so when we went our separate ways, it wouldn't be so heartbreaking. \"I think you ate too much turkey and drank too much wine,\" I said trying to make a joke of it. Eddie's face fell, and he seemed disappointed and slightly hurt. \"I'm completely sober. I've had these feelings for quite some time. You have captivated me with your charm, your wit, your knowledge, and your desire to make a difference in this world. I thought tonight was a good night to tell you exactly how I felt,\" he said taking my hand. \"I just think we are better off as friends,\" I replied. \"A relationship between us wouldn't work. We would always be avoiding the inevitable. What happens when you go back to Denmark? Or when I graduate?\" I asked. His eyes lit up light a Christmas Tree. In those two questions, I realized that I had revealed my feelings for him. \"So, you do have feelings for me,\" he stated, inching slightly closer. I searched his eyes, not knowing what to say or what to do. I couldn't believe that I had let my guard down and revealed my feelings with those two questions. \"Yes, I do,\" I finally admitted with my heart pounding in my chest. \"That's good because I do too. Now, I don't feel like a complete idiot,\" he said smiling and laughing. \"You should never feel ashamed about admitting your feelings for someone. What you said touched me and was really brave,\" I replied. \"I'm just afraid of getting involved right now.\" \"Why?\" he asked me, inching slightly closer to me. \"I need to focus on medical school applications and medical school. I don't want to complicate any of that,\" I confided in him. Eddie moved his face closer into mine. Our noses were almost touching, and I could feel his breath on my face. My head was spinning. What was happening? I had my entire future ahead of me. I didn't want to make the same mistake that my mother did- she gave up her dream of being a doctor to get married and raise me and my brothers. I wasn't going to fall for him even more and give up on my dreams. \"I would never ask you to give up any of that. I care for you just the way you are,\" he told me. \"I'll go wherever you go,\" he whispered to me, cupping my chin and drawing me closer to his lips. Our noses touched, and the feeling was electric. I could feel the sparks between us. Finally, I surrendered my feelings and let down my guard. I was crazy about him, and he was obviously very crazy about me too. I closed my eyes and waited for the touch of his lips against mine. His lips gently brushed up against mine, teasing me and causing me to go weak in the knees. He was obviously hesitating and nervous about kissing me. I wondered why. Then, Eddie became more confident and put his arm around my back and pulled me in closer to kiss me. My heart was racing so fast I thought it would pop out of my chest. I wondered if he could feel how fast my pulse was at this very moment. \"Hey Paige,\" I heard Johnny say coming up the stairs. Eddie and I jumped a part right before Johnny came in the room. \"Oh Eddie! I was looking for you!\" Johnny exclaimed. \"I was wanting to let you know that I was hitting the hay,\" he said. He and Eddie shared a room so I guess he felt the need to tell him that it was bedtime. Then he stopped and looked at us. \"Did I interrupt something?\" he asked us. \"No, not at all. I was just getting clean towels for Eddie,\" I said leaving my room and going to get the clean towels from the linen closet. My head was spinning. What in the world just happened? Why did I open myself up and admit my feelings? What would happen now? Eddie came over to me as I handed him a towel and a hand towel. We made eye contact as I handed it to him. I wanted to continue our conversation, and I wanted him to kiss me. \"What's going on here?\" Johnny asked in hallway, noticing the awkwardness between our towel exchange. \"Nothing,\" I said giving Eddie a pat on the arm. \"Good-night. I'll see you tomorrow,\" I said. \"Good night,\" he mumbled in return. I went back to my room, closed the door behind me and laid down on my bed. What in the world just happened? My heart was still racing, and I couldn't shake the feeling I felt when his lips brushed up against mine so gently. I went to the downstairs shower to take a shower and to try to shake these feelings. Whenever I closed my eyes, I saw his face. I kept on replaying our conversation over and over. Was Eddie in love with me? Was I in love with him? I sighed, stopped the water and returned to my bedroom. I tried to sleep, but I ended up tossing and turning most of the night. What would happen tomorrow? Would it be awkward between us? Would he kiss me? Would he act as though nothing happened? When it was dawn, I went ahead and got up after a sleepless night. The cows needed to be milked, and I needed to shovel the manure and clean the stables. It would give me some time to think and process what happened last night. Too bad my family didn't go out shopping on Black Friday. That would have given me the perfect excuse to get out of the house. Soon, my brothers, dad, and even Eddie joined me outside. When I saw Eddie come over to the stables, my heart stopped. I wanted him to kiss me, to hold me, and to proclaim his love for me again. I had realized that I did have strong feelings for him. Why couldn't I pursue both being a doctor and having a relationship? \"Good morning,\" Eddie said smiling at me, getting a shovel. \"Good morning,\" I said smiling back at him. I went over to him to help him clean Betsy, the horse's, stable. \"So, can you tell me more about this lawn mower race today?\" he asked. My heart sunk. He was acting as though last night didn't happen. Did he regret revealing his feelings to me? \"Well, you race against the other contestants, and you are all in lawn mowers. You race around on a track in a circle,\" I explained. \"I'm going to do it. I've been working with your brothers to make their lawn mowers faster, and we fixed up the older one for me to race,\" he told me. \"Really?\" I asked, surprised. \"Yes,\" he replied. \"I don't know why you are so surprised. I have proved myself this week that I am not so inept as you have thought,\" he said smiling at me. \"I never thought that,\" I said, getting defensive. \"I know you did, especially when you taught me how to use the slicer at work and how to do laundry,\" he told me, laughing. \"Oh yeah. I did think you were kind of incompetent when it came to everyday things,\" I said squeezing his arm slightly to tease him. I wanted to let him know that I was interested in him. \"What's the prize if you win?\" he asked. \"A jar full of marbles,\" I replied. He approached me and got closer. \"Then I shall win all the marbles for you,\" he whispered into my ear, sending shivers down my spine. He didn't forget about our conversation from last night, and he wasn't going to give up on his quest to win me over. \"I'd like that very much,\" I said looking up at him, smiling. I looked up and saw Mikey and Johnny staring at us. By now, they had to sense that there was something going on between us...even though I wasn't exactly sure what that was yet. Later that afternoon, my mom and I arrived at the race. My dad, Eddie and my brothers had already arrived early to set up and register. Plus, they had to bring over their lawn mowers. We were walking to our seats, and we passed by Eddie. I made a face at their rival, Keith, and then I smiled and waved at Eddie. Eddie's face lit up, and he waved back at me. My dad saw our exchange, and he patted Eddie on the back and winked at me. Did he know too that Eddie and I had feelings for each other? My mother and I went up to the bleachers and found a good seat. Once we got situated, my mother immediately brought up Eddie. \"Your brothers seem to like him,\" she told me. \"Mom,\" I said in a tone that said I didn't want to have this conversation right now. \"I like him too,\" she told me, looking over at him and my brothers. \"Yeah, I get that,\" I said quickly. \"I really can't afford any distractions right now,\" I said avoiding eye contact with my mother. I hadn't told her about what happened last night between me and Eddie and I wasn't planning on it either. I was still trying to process it all myself. \"Chemistry just isn't in a class, kiddo. And you guys have it,\" she told me. I know she meant well, but I felt she was trying to persuade me to get into a relationship with Eddie. \"Right. And then what happens? I fool myself into thinking he's Prince Charming? We get married and live happily ever after? Then all my hard work goes down the drain because I'm too busy shopping for groceries and picking up my kids at soccer,\" I explained to my mom. Also, I was trying to justify the reasons to myself as to why a relationship with Eddie would never work out. I had too many goals, and I needed to focus on achieving my goals. \"Sweetie, it wasn't really as bad as all that,\" my mother told me gently. \"I didn't mean it that way,\" I said in a apologetic way. My mother had decided not to become a doctor to get married and take care of me and my two brothers. It was her choice, and I didn't mean to criticize it. However, at the same time, I didn't want to make the same choice that she did all those years ago. \"I know,\" she said quietly. \"But we aren't talking about me. I made my choice. This is about you making the right choice for you,\" she told me. I turned to her and nodded to show that I understood. \"Do you like him? Could you see a future with him?\" my mother asked me. I blushed, smiled and looked down at my drink. \"I...\" I began completely unsure how to answer this. \"Oh my gosh! You really like him!\" my mother exclaimed. \"Yes, I do. If he wasn't here with me on break, I would have really missed him,\" I confessed. \"He's all I think about, he's the only person I want to be with all the time, and I really enjoy his company,\" I finally confessed to my mother. \"I keep on trying to convince myself that I don't like him and that I'm not attracted to him, but it keeps on making the feelings stronger. I don't know how to stop them. I don't want any distractions right now,\" I said looking at my mother, showing my frustration and inner battle with my feelings. \"It sounds like you're in love,\" she told me, smiling at me. I froze in place and found Eddie on the track field. It so happened that he was looking my way as well, and we made eye contact. He smiled at waved at me, which made my heart flutter. I smiled and waved back at him and then turned back to my mother. \"I don't want to be in love with him,\" I said quietly. \"I need to focus on my med school applications, and I need to look towards the future-\" \"Paige,\" my mother said cutting me off. \"You are so focused on the future that you forget to live in the present. Maybe Eddie was sent your way to remind you of that. Live in the present. Does Eddie feel the same way about you?\" My mother asked. \"I don't know; I think so,\" I lied, not wanting to go into the details of our conversation from last night. \"Has ever said anything or-\" \"He's hinted at it,\" I said quickly. \"Then tell him how you feel,\" she told me. \"What?\" I asked, confused. \"When you feel that the time is right, tell him how you feel. He deserves to know,\" she told me. I had to refrain myself from rolling my eyes. That was exactly what Eddie told me last night- that I deserved to know how he felt. I ran my fingers through my hair and sighed in frustration. Why was love such a complicated matter? ","Summary":" Please note: There are some sentences in here that are direct lines from the movie. I do not own th"},{"Movie":"Prince & Me","Title":"Prince and me","Author":"jasmine monroe","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5518842","Passage":"[Chapter 1] THE PRINCE AND ME NOT BASED ON THE MOVIE, BUT THERE ARE SOME SIMULARITIES THE PRINCE AND ME My life isn't based one some sort of fairy tale and I have no prince who comes to rescue me, I'm just a regular teenage girl who's just waiting for life to takes it's best shot and then get it over with. Anyways, my first year in collage was supposed to be quick and easy, but I find it hard being able to have it done when the Prince of England is supposed to be attending the same school, plus everywhere I go he goes, it's like he knows where I am going every step of the way. Maybe he just has thee same schedule and it's just a coincidence! Or maybe not, I'll just ignore him and maybe he will just leave me alone like every other guy here. That is such a lie, to most guys' I'm considered a hottie, and I won prom queen in high school, but you know the funny thing, I never talked to anyone but my sister. I knew something was sort of fishy about me winning the title prom queen, but the worse part was that I had to dance with Frankie Miller! He may have been the hottest guys in school, but he broke my sister's hearts, so I stumped on his foot a couple of times. Back to the real story, it wasn't really a surprise when he showed up in my literacy class, but what was a surprise was the fact that his father actually showed up with him! The teacher had already put our names on desks, I felt as though I was in the second grade all over again. My name ended up being placed next to Edward's, luckily there was another chair, so I sat at the far end of the table , but making sure that my black jacket covered my entire body including my face. If I was going to make an entrance at this school then I need to work on some things, 1 for sure, not having to look like a guy the whole time, and 2 making my first impression great! \"As some of you may know, I am Mr. Smith, and for our first day of class, I would like to see what type perspectives you guys are into, so……Kate Wilson and Prince Edward please come up in front of the class\" he said and I took of my jacket revealing the gorgeous black silky dress that my mother brought for me, I heard some people say remarks like 'Man she's gorgeous' but just plain ignored them, or so I tried. When I got up, I think that was when Edward finally noticed me and smiled, I smiled back in return but only to look away so fast that I think I may have upset him. When I reached to the front of the class the king had smiled at me, and to be polite I smiled back, \"So I want you two to debate on what you think was right and wrong about the book you where assigned to read\" he said and I nodded. I decided that I should just go first \"I think that what Alejandro did was maybe foolish, but the right thing to do because sometimes in order to protected who he loved, he had to make some mistakes, like we all do\" I said and the king nodded to what I said and so I continued \"Growing up without a father, who died in front of you is hard, trust me I have been there, but then when your own brother is trying or is some how allowing himself to get caught up with the gang is hard, people do crazy things to protect who they love and, he had to make some errors on the way, surely some people can recognize that\" I said and there was a few nods among the room. I turned to look at Edward who had been watching me the whole time and had now smiled at me \"I have to agree to what she said only I think he was wrong for telling Brittney about the bet in the first place, because if he knew that he loved her, and that he didn't want to leave her, then there was not bet in the first place. It was just a excuse to be around her more\" Edward said and to my surprise was that he was right \"Yes, but say you had a bet to date I don't know someone, and then you fell in love with her, don't you think it would be right to tell her anyways so you wont have burden on your chest?\" I asked and he nodded \"But I'm just saying that he chose the wrong time to tell her\" he said and Mr. Smith clapped his hands \"That was good\" he said, \"Next up are Lisa and Brian\" he announces and they both walk to the front of the class as dumb founded as ever, so I'm sort of guessing that they didn't read the book, luckily they didn't have to because the bell rang. By the look on their faces, they where going to have to do some serious reading tonight because I know the teacher will want to continue the discussion about the book. As for me accidently bumped into Edward and dropped my stuff. \"I'm sorry\" I said and picked up my stuff, and with that I turned and walked away. My next class was Home and careers. I loved to cook; I mean cooking was my specialty! This was the only class where I didn't have to pretend to be anybody, when I walked into the classroom I sat in the second row near the window. I loved sitting near windows because it allowed me to concentrate on my cooking. When the bell rang I quickly got out all the materials that where listed on the board and began with my warm up, about two seconds later a Latino boy, by the name of Alejandro. He was extremely hot and when we connected eyes he smiled at me and I blushed of course. Then about 2 seconds after that the prince came in and handed the teacher a slip indicated that he was late of course but with an appropriate reason, and I knew by the look on her face she wasn't going to question him either. Alejandro sat down next to me and I smiled at him, \"My name's Alejandro, but you can call me Alex\" he said and held out his hand \"Kate. Kate Wilson\" I said and he nodded as thought he just learned the best thing ever. \"Hello everyone, it's nice to see that you saw my instructions you two\" she said and looked at me and Alejandro. I smiled politely and she nodded \"I can see who I won't be needing to worry about this year\" she mumbled. \"Well let me just make one thing clear, when you walk through that door, you are now my students, any drama or disturbing things end at that door, and by no mean of disrespect you highness, but there also are no special treatments, I will treat you as you are one of us\" she said and I smiled, nice to see someone not letting him get away with things. \"Now as an assignment, you, and the person you are sitting next to are going to make something, anything that you feel as though you are good at when you are cooking\" she said and I smiled, I was good at everything but my specialty was chocolate chip cookies. \"I don't want you to try to make anything at the last minute either because it will taste nasty and that will affect you grade ladies and gentlemen, you have 4 days to complete this task and I don't except anything late. Is that understood?' she asked, and of course everyone did a sort of nod, I raised my hand \"By what means, or how mush of the food do you want us to make?\" I asked \"Good question, I want you to make enough for the whole class. In by which another thing, if you are allergic to a pacific food please sign this clip board and tell what you are allergic to\" she said and I nodded. Proceeded to count the number of students in the class, when a pair of blue eyes met mine, it was the prince's I smiled politely and quickly looked away, by the end of my count I ended up with 27. \"Attendance\" she said and began to read off the names on the list, when my name was called I silently raised my hand, but was confused when she didn't call Alex's name. \"Um excuse me young man but what is your name?\" she asked and looked at him \"Alejandro Presario\" he said \"I'm sorry but are you in the right class?\" she asked and he brought out his schedule and his eyes grew large \"I'll give you a pass\" she said noticing the look on his face and a few kids laughed. Great now I have no partner, \"Who doesn't have a partner?\" she asked and I raised my hand, I didn't dare looked to see who else's hand was in the air. \"Perfect. Edward and Kate, you will be partners\" she said and my heart sank, out of all the people in the class she chose Edward! Edward got up and sat next to me, \"Now you may begin\" she said and I looked at Edward \"Kate\" I said \"Edward\" he said, oh how I loved his British accent. \"I made a full count of 27 people, so I'm guessing we should make at least 35, just incase something goes wrong and I made a bad count\" I said and he nodded \"Now what would you like to make?\" he asked \"I'm good at making cookies\" I said and he shrugged \"That's good for me\" he said and I nodded.

À réaliser en une heure, sur le thème « misère ». Je m'aperçois, maintenant qu'il est terminé, à quel point j'ai merdé sur ce thème, que je ne le respecte vraiment pas! J'en suis tout de même heureuse, puisque j'ai exploité un nouveau fandom, un qui n'est pratiquement pas exploité de plus. J'espère qu'il vous plaira, bonne lecture! Pairing : Paige Rating : K+ Disclaimer : Rien ne m'appartient, l'historie est à son auteur dont j'ignore le nom Résumer Paige a refusé d'épouser Eddie, préférant la médecine. Mais ce choix fut à l'origine d'une tragédie qui, même plus de cinquante ans après, lui faisait regretter… Souvenir d'une misère amoureuse -J'aurais voulu pouvoir vous raconter une histoire d'amour, une histoire remplie de joie, mais les mots m'échappent et il n'y a que celle-ci qui me vienne à la bouche. Vous voyez, dehors, comme c'est blanc? Vous voyez, ces flocons qui tombent et parsèment notre nuit de magie? Ne les oubliez jamais, parce qu'un jour, peut-être, c'est vous qui vous retrouverez face à un drame. Un jour, peut-être, c'est vous qui aurez à souffrir alors que la magie de Noël rayonne autour de vous. Ils étaient tous pendus à ses lèvres attendant patiemment qu'elle leur raconte cette histoire qui avait été la sienne dans sa jeunesse. Elle n'avait jamais voulu en parler, ressentant encore la douleur du moment, mais ce soir, elle leur offrait en guise de présent. Parce qu'elle voulait qu'enfin ils comprennent que tous n'avaient pas leur chance, que certains étaient malheureux même en cette nuit de Noël. Elle but une gorgée du lait qu'on lui avait offert et reposa son verre. Ses doigts tremblèrent vinrent trouver leur place sur ses cuisses, ses lèvres s'ouvrirent et elle se mit à parler d'une voix mal assurer. -Je n'ai pas toujours été cette vieille femme aigrie que vous connaissez, commença Paige. J'ai moi aussi aimé un jour. Un homme extraordinaire, un homme comme vous en rencontrez jamais dans votre vie. Entre ces bras, je me sentais comme une princesse et ce, bien avant que je connaisse la vérité à son égard. Il était un prince, venu du Danemark pour étudier avec nous. Son nom était Eddie, et il était amené à devenir roi à la suite de son père. Elle se tut un moment, perdue dans ses souvenirs. Les enfants n'osèrent pas bouger ou l'inciter à continuer de peur qu'elle le refuse. Ils lui avaient si souvent demandé de leur raconter cette histoire, il n'était pas question qu'ils la gâchent maintenant. -Je l'ai d'abord trouvé arrogant au possible, mal élevé et enfant gâté. Au début, mais il m'a rapidement conquit et bien que je voulais éviter ce genre de distraction, je tombai amoureuse de lui. Si follement, que je partis le rejoindre dans son pays sur un coup de tête, négligeant mes rêves d'étudier la médecine. J'ai passé quelques semaines dans sa demeure, quelques semaines merveilleuses. J'avais accepté de l'épouser, mais la veille de son couronnement, les choses basculèrent. J'étouffais, je ne pouvais plus rester là. Si fort était mon amour pour lui, il ne pouvait effacer mes rêves, mon envie de pratiquer la médecine. Il m'a fallu bien du courage, mais je l'ai finalement quitté, revenant chez moi, le cœur lourd de chagrin. Sa main glissa sur sa paupière, effaçant discrètement une larme qui s'y était accrochée. -Je ne l'ai revu qu'une seule fois par la suite, c'était le jour de ma remise des diplômes, quelques jours avant Noël. Il était venu me retrouver, m'annonçant qu'il était prêt à m'attendre, mais qu'il ne pourrait faire sa vie sans moi. Le bonheur qui m'avait emplit à ce moment là c'est très vite éteint. Il nous a quittés le jour même de Noël, des affaires à régler dans son pays. J'étais en pleine célébration avec la famille lorsque je reçu l'appel : l'avion qu'il avait pris venait de s'écraser. Les sanglots lui nouèrent la gorge, elle ne pouvait pas continuer. Les enfants se levèrent, l'un après l'autre et s'approchèrent d'elle pour une étreinte collective. Elle n'avait pas besoin d'en dire plus, ils avaient compris. Sa misère, son malheur, ils acceptaient de partager sa douleur pour un moment. Ils acceptaient de la réconforter. Ils comprenaient désormais pourquoi ils ne la voyaient jamais sourire lors des fêtes de Noël. Elle se souvenait, elle se souvenait de cet amour qu'elle avait perdu et regrettait fort certainement les choix qu'elle avait fait plus jeune : choisir la médecine plutôt que l'amour… ","Summary":" Cet OS a été écrit dans le cadre des nuits du FOF.

Eddie is on the line for you!\" Paige looks up from her textbook and smiles at her friend. \"Thanks, Eliza\" and runs toward the phone. Since leaving Denmark three months ago to study for her final exams at Johns Hopkins, Paige thought she'd never be able to study for finals and do her internship at the hospital. Missing Eddie and struggling to cope with their long distance relationship was starting to take its toll on her. Being engaged to the King of Denmark still felt like a fantasy to Paige. Meeting Eddie at the University of Wisconsin four years ago, was something Paige never planned for when she was focusing very hard on becoming a doctor. Discovering he was the then Prince of Denmark almost ended their relationship, but here she was, all her dreams of becoming a doctor coming true in two weeks. \"Eddie, how are you? I miss you! I wish you were here! Only two weeks! Are you still coming to my graduation?\" the words rushed out. \" Paige, darling, of course I'll be there. I wouldn't miss it for the world. My fiancée, the doctor! I'm so proud. I miss you too, and Arabella sends her special love.\" Eddie's little sister Arabella, at 15 felt like a sister to Paige. Being a princess at her age, with all the protocols and rules, was very hard on Arabella and Paige were helping her through it, just as Arabella had helped Paige cope with royal life. \"How are the final studies going?\" \"Oh, Eddie, I wish it's over. I just can't wait to be with you. It has been a very long four years. I'm ready to come home and be with you.\" Paige swallows a tear. \"I love you, Eddie.\" \" I love you more, Paige\" he whispers back. \" I have to go now, duty calls. I'll be thinking of you every minute.\" Paige slowly returns the phone to the cradle. How can I be so blessed? she thinks to herself. \"Will you please wipe that smile off your face Your Highness? Some of us don't have royal fiancée's and still have tons of studying to do!\" frowns Eliza mockingly. Paige just smiles at her friend indulgently and squeezes her shoulder. \"Eliza, in a few months time, you will be a doctor at Cedar-Sinai. Just imagine it! All those exciting cases and handsome doctors!\" Paige sits down on the plaid brown sofa and opens her study material, folding one leg underneath her, her dark hair forming a curtain around her face. She looks up, when Eliza flops down next to her. \"Paige, what about you? After graduation, what then?\" Eliza lifts one eyebrow questioningly and tosses her curly blond hair over her shoulder and Paige almost starts laughing. \"What do you mean? I'm leaving with Eddie after graduation. \" \"No, Paige,\" Eliza softly prompts, \"I mean you'll be a doctor too in a few weeks, not just fiancée to a king.\" Paige stares at Eliza angrily. \"What are you trying to say? That I'm giving up my dreams for a man? I love Eddie. We waited for years to be together.\" She pushes herself up, her book falling to the floor. \"Thanks for your support Eliza!\" She runs toward the bathroom and slams the door shut. Sitting on the edge of the bath, her heart racing, Paige starts crying. Why must Eliza ruin her happy moment? Sure she wanted to be a doctor with \"Doctors without Borders\", but you can't always plan for life, can you? She could have married Eddie four years ago, but she chose to follow her dream and become a doctor. Eddie waited for her to realize her dream and now in a few weeks time she will be a doctor and she will be with Eddie. That is what she wanted, wasn't it? Eliza tapped softly on the door, opened it slowly. \"Paige, I'm sorry, I'm such an idiot. I love you. I just want the best for you. I know you love Eddie. Please forgive me.\" Wiping off the tears, Paige takes Eliza's hand. \"I love you too. Come on, let's go get some coffee, oh ... and you're buying!\" \"GRADUATION\" Paige was nervous. Pacing up and down in front of her dorm building, dressed in her graduation gown, her cap in her hand. \"Paige, darling relax, he'll be here. He's probably just held up at the airport.\" She knew her mom was trying to calm her down, but it wasn't working. Eddie was late. He promised he'd be here and he's not answering he's cell phone. She knew he wouldn't stand her up without a very good reason, but she could feel the tears of disappointment starting to well up in her dark eyes. Her dad seemed furious. \"I don't care if he's a king! I'm going to break his neck if he stands you up!\" \"Ben Morgan, you daughter is graduating today, please don't spoil her day!\" I could just hug my mom. She was Eddie's biggest champion and my rock through the past four years. \"Honey, let's go, maybe Eddie will meet us at the auditorium. Don't worry, everything will be fine.\" Searching for Eddie throughout the ceremony, Paige barely listened to the dean's speech and only just heard her name being called. Walking up the stage to accept her degree, she tried to put on a brave face, but she knew her friends and family weren't fooled. She was dimly aware of her parents standing, clapping furiously and her mother pecking away some tears. In a daze she walked with her classmates towards her seat. Rising up, the dean declared, \"Ladies and Gentlemen, the class of 2012!\" Everyone around her were tossing caps in the air, when she felt herself spun around and lips crushing hers in a passionate kiss that seemed to last forever. Pulling away and opening her eyes, Paige felt the world falling away, staring into Eddie's soft blue eyes. \"Paige, I'm so sorry, our flight was delayed and I couldn't call. Please don't be mad.\" She pulled him closer and kissed him again, savoring his soft lips against hers, running her hands down his strong back and up again into the nape of his neck, gripping him there to keep him close. Pulling away eventually, smiling at him, \"I missed you!\" Paige gripped his hand and pulled him towards her parents. Judging by her father's stormy expression, he's certainly not forgiven Eddie for being late. \"Ben, I'm sorry I'm late, our flight was delayed due to bad weather. Congratulations with your daughter's accomplishment. You must be very proud.\" Grudgingly her father held out his hand, but her mother enveloped Eddie in a maternal embrace. Out of the corner of her eye Paige recognized another familiar face. \"Zoren!\" Paige let go of Eddie's hand and hugged Zoren fondly. Embarrassed as always by any affection, he stood as still as a statue. \"Congratulations Miss Paige or should I say Dr Paige?\" Everyone laughed at hearing this. They made their way outside, Paige feeling a little inconspicuous with all the bodyguards present. Her mom took what felt like hundreds of photographs, while she clung to Eddie's hand and wouldn't let go. \"CELEBRATING THEIR LOVE\" It felt like forever before they could finally be alone. Slowly they extracted themselves from the rest of the graduates and made their way hand in hand towards Paige's dorm room. Hastily unlocking the door, Paige's heart beating erratically, they grabbed at each other. They kissed passionately and deeply, but soon they were tearing at each other's clothes, trying to tear away everything between them. Paige pulled at Eddie's tie, while he frantically unbuttoned his shirt, pulling it out of his pants. Soon he was lifting Paige's dress over her head, his eyes hungrily staring at her. Soon they stood naked. No more barriers or obstacles between them. Eddie stared deep into her eyes \" Are you sure, Paige?\" Not sure she could speak for all the emotions running through her, she whispered, \"Yes.\" Hearing this, Eddie swept her up into his arms and into her bedroom, lowering her softly onto the bed. Staring up at him seductively, Paige gripped him behind his neck and pulled him down towards her. With a groan, he surrendered, running his hand along her soft curves, pressing his hard body against her. Soon they were both lost in passionate lovemaking. Waking up slowly, stretching and glancing to her left, she saw Eddie, hair adorably rumpled peacefully asleep. Last night was surely one of the best nights of her life. Eddie was such an experienced lover, but yet so tender at times, although when Paige thought she would explode with wanting him, he anticipated that too and loved her with sweet roughness. Her bones still felt like jelly and she just couldn't stop smiling. Eddie was so adamant to wait till after her studies, but a small part of her was disappointed they hadn't started their lovemaking much earlier, seeing how amazing they were together. She reached out her hand and lovingly stroked his soft and curly blond hair, noticing the little curlicues around his forehead. Paige never thought love like this could be possible. She slowly lowered her head, her hair sweeping over Eddie's chest and softly kissed his half open lips. With a groan and a stretch, he opened his eyes, staring deeply into Paige's dark ones. Suddenly he grabbed her and rolled her over and under him. \"And what teasing is this? A man can only take as much and you, Paige Morgan can drive men crazy.\" His lips came down forcefully on hers, teasing her lips apart and exploring their sweet inner softness, then moving on to her neck, whispering in her ear. \"I love you, I want you and I never want to stop.\" Eventually they did have to stop. Zoren calling five times to remind them of lunch with her parents and flight details for their trip back to Denmark, was no mood enhancer. After finally getting out of bed, showering, packing and eating a stale sandwich to keep her strength up, Paige sat down on Eddie's lap, where he'd been sitting on a chair by the window, paging through her textbooks. \"Mmmm, I like you looking so scholarly,\" she murmured in his neck. Wrapping his arms around her, they sat peacefully like that, when there was a knock on the door. Paige reluctantly left Eddie's arms to find Zoren standing by the door. \"Zoren! Do you like being back in university?\" Paige enquired with a teasing smile, knowing Zoren hated the University of Wisconsin, when forced to go there with Eddie. Zoren only smiled fondly. \"The car is here for your bags, miss Paige, we'll leave straight after lunch for the airport.\" Although Paige has been to Denmark back and forth the last few years, this was so final. She felt Eddie's reassuring hands on her shoulders. \"Could you please load the bags, Zoren?\" \"Yes, Your Majesty.\" Turning Paige around to face him, Eddie looked searchingly into her eyes. \"Are you ready for this, Paige? I know you will have lots of sacrifices you'll have to make, but I'll be there every step of the way. I love you so much and when we get home, I have a surprise for you.\" He looked so excited, that Paige stood on her toes and gave him a quick kiss. \"You are the only one I want, the best surprise ever!\" \"RETURNING TO DENMARK\" Sitting, ensconced in her first class seat next to Eddie, Paige couldn't help but remember the tears in her mother's eyes or the tortured face of her father, when she greeted them at the airport. They all knew this was coming, but saying goodbye, knowing they will only see her again at the wedding, was a hard pill to swallow. Paige still felt the lump in her throat, thinking about her parents and friends she's leaving behind. Looking over at Eddie, smiling indulgently at her, she felt much better. This was her best friend, confidant and now lover, how could she even doubt her decisions that lead her here. Sliding her hand into Eddie's and resting her head on his shoulder, she knew this was the place she needed to be. \"Paige, darling, wakeup. We're here.\" Paige rubbed her eyes and tried to focus. She could feel the plane descending and peered outside the window, only to see the beautiful pastel buildings of Copenhagen slowly pass below. She loved this country. The people welcomed her with open arms, even after she and Eddie had broken off their engagement. All fears about coming back to Denmark, was fading away, when she saw al the little Danish flags and excited people waiting for them outside the airport. Waving at the people, Paige smiled at the little blond Danish girl, who gave her a bunch of flowers with a curtsy. Looking up at Eddie, she realized, that she's never seen him looking so proud. He clasped her hand in his and brought it up to his lips and kissed it tenderly. The people screamed their encouragement. Hastily they ducked into our car and off they sped to the palace. Paige stared out the window at the beautiful buildings and streets, that would now become her home, hoping she would never disappoint Eddie or the people of Denmark. Feeling her unease, Eddie angled himself towards her. \"Paige, I love you more than I can describe and I want you to be happy here. Just know that I'm always here for you. You are my life.\" Oh, what sweet words to hear. Paige never dreamed her life could be like this. Arriving at the palace, they were greeted by an overexcited Arabella, who's blossomed into a real beauty and Queen Rosalind, who was reserved, but kind. Grabbing Paige by her hand, Arabella pulled her along towards the stables. \"Come and see my knew foal! She's a beauty!\" Arabella's enthusiasm was so contagious, Paige felt herself getting excited just to be here again. After brushing the foal, feeding some of the other horses, Arabella regaled her with stories of handsome boys, illicit parties and horse riding. This is where Eddie found them two hours later. \"LOVE IN THE PALACE\" First night back, Paige felt jet lagged and tired from all the excitement. Putting on some old boxer shorts and t-shirt of Eddie's, she decided to send her apologies for dinner and just relax in bed with a book. Putting on some earphones she layed back against the pillows and closed her eyes and started drifting off. Suddenly she was awakened by a kiss. Confused, she opened her eyes and blinking slowly, focused on Eddie's blue ones, just centimeters away from hers. Smiling, she pulled him towards her and kissed him deeply, her hand playing with the hair in his neck. It was so blissful, that she groaned when he pulled lightly away. \"Sorry for waking you, but you seemed so peaceful and beautiful, I couldn't resist a kiss,\" he smiled down at her. She took in his crinkly blue eyes, full, sensually curved lips and tousled hair and felt herself falling for this man all over again. \"How would you feel about a secret tryst, my king?\" she coyly asked him, fluttering her eyelashes for full effect. Seeing the passion in his eyes, made her stomach flutter in anticipation. He pulled her up, their bodies locked together. Staring into her eyes, he kissed her with wild abandon. Paige felt her legs give way, but his strong arms held her close to him. Slowly lifting her arms above her head, he slowly slid the old t-shirt over her head. He gasped as he took in her nakedness, burying his head in her neck and slowly running his hands softly over her responsive breasts. Paige felt a shiver of anticipation run down her spine, arching her back to get closer to his caresses. Lifting his head and staring with a burning passion into her eyes, he whispered, \"Paige, I need you\". That was the only thing she needed to hear. All at once she was grappling with his tie en shirt buttons. Soon after his pants followed. Feeling his hard naked body pressed against her, made Paige dizzy with anticipation. Eddie cupped her buttocks, pressing her even closer, making her shiver with pleasure. Soon they were lost in passionate lovemaking. Paige was woken by the sounds of the palace coming to life. Trolleys with breakfast being pushed along the long marbled hallways. Shutters being opened, sprinklers running in the garden. She smiled, blissfully happy to be lying in Eddie's warm arms. The way their bodies was pressed together, started to do funny things to her. She wanted this moment never to end. She snuggled closer to Eddie, inhaling his wonderful smell, running her leg up and down his. Smiling, eyes still closed, Eddie reached for her too. Suddenly there was a knock at the door and they pulled apart. \"Paige, are you awake? We're looking for Edvard. Paige? Have you seen him?\" It was Queen Rosalind and she sounded frantic. Paige turned anxiously to Eddie. \"She can't find you in here!\" Eddie leapt out of bed, looking all flustered and adorable like a schoolboy caught with his girl, not at all like a 28 year old king sleeping with his fiancée. Paige tried to stifle a laugh, but it came out a snort, making Eddie laugh as well. \"Shhh! She'll hear us and we'll never live it down.\" Pushing Eddie behind some room dividers, she grabbed her robe and rushed to the door, yanking it open seconds before the queen walked in. Trying to look innocent and concerned, Paige exclaimed: \"I saw him last night, when I went to bed, maybe Eddie is down at the stables?\" The Queen shook her head irritably. \"No, no, Zoren says he hasn't slept in his bed! I thought…., \" she trails off trying to see into Paige's room. Paige deliberately opens the door wider, to give the queen a full view of the room, hoping Eddie is still ensconced behind the divider. Satisfied, the Queen looks her up and down. \"My dear, shouldn't you be dressed already? The royal photographer will be here in two hours to take engagement pictures. Marguerite left a dress in the armoire for you to wear.\" With that said the queen, mumbled something about errant kings and made her way down the hall. Before Paige could properly close the door, Eddie was behind her kissing her neck, holding her tight. Turning around, she gasps as she takes in his graceful naked body. He smiles naughtily and pulls her close, pulling Paige off balance, resulting with both of them sprawled on the rug. Needless to say, Eddie was only found two hours later. Apparently he fell asleep in an obscure unused study, while reading. Yeah, right! \"BECOMING ROYAL\" Dressed in one of the royal fashion designer, Marguerite's finest dresses, Paige felt like a queen in the making. She tried to think about last night while the hairdresser was attempting to tame her dark hair. Arabella was also hovering, critiquing Paige's make-up skills. \"Oh, Paige, I do think a little more blush and eyeliner wouldn't go amiss. Try this new lipgloss, it's Chanel and it's amazing. It would go lovely with your skin.\" Arabella was a picture in a electric blue Stella McCartney shift dress with same colored Jimmy Choo's. The girl was truly a fashion icon, something Paige definitely had a lot to learn about. For the past 24 years she's been a jeans and t-shirt girl, but it seems all will change now. Chanel, Dior, Armani, etc. may be some girls' idea of a fantasy come true but to Paige they were necessary tools in becoming a royal. Anyway, Eddie and Arabella usually dressed in jeans and sweaters around the palace too. Only Queen Rosalind was always dressed to the nines. \"Earth to Paige! Why are you grinning like a cat who got at the cream? Mmmm… you wouldn't happen to know anything about Eddie being missing this morning, now would you?\" Leaning closer she whispers in Paige's ear. \"No worries, I wont tell. Why be engaged when you have to behave all the time, heh?\" Giggling, Arabella turns Paige's chair around and squints into her face. \"Perfect! I declare you ready for the photographer!\" Paige rolls her eyes. \"Great, thanks!\" Quickly looking at her reflection in the mirror, she had to admit, that the soft green dress did suit her perfecty and her hair and make-up was very well done. After a soft knock on the door, Zoren entered. \"Miss Paige\" he exclaimed \"you look beautiful!\" Immediately blushing after he said it. \"Thanks Zoren. So where to now?\" \"Please follow me, miss, the king and queen mother is waiting downstairs in the reception room\" he said still a little flustered. Walking down the marble stairs was quite tricky, but luckily Zoren was holding on tightly to my arm. Arabella flitted downstairs, as if no problem at all in high heels. \"Arabella, please, this is not a race, please behave with grace and poise\" the queen reprimanded her. The Queen herself looked beautiful in sea blue satin suit, with a royal ribbon. Looking Paige up and down, she nodded with approval. Clicking her fingers, she summoned her lady in waiting, who handed her velvet oblong box. The queen opened it, to reveal a fine strand of intricately woven diamonds and matching earrings. \"Turn around dear Paige, I think these will compliment your outfit lovely.\" Deftly clasping the necklace, she gave the earrings to Paige to put on in the mirror, but before she could, Eddie gently took them out of her hands and turning her around, softly attached the earrings to her lobes, while caressing them. Looking deep into his eyes, she couldn't help but feel yet another shiver of anticipation. Every touch was so intimate, now that they were truly together. Kissing her softly on the cheek. Eddie guided her to the set up studio in the reception room. Looking at Eddie in his uniform, so comfortable and natural, she just realized once again, how much different she and Eddie grew up and how amazing fate was to bring them together. Seeing Paige staring at him, he leaned over and whispered: \"My queen, you do look quite delicious.\" After this all my nervousness disappeared and I quite liked the photographic session, laughing at Arabella pulling faces and Eddie whispering sweet nothings in my ear. I suspect the queen thought we were quite mad, but I think I saw her smile a few times. Losing her husband three years ago, must have been hard on her and seeing her children so happy, must have been a relief. I know we still had a long way to go, but I could see us having a loving relationship. Sometimes I wondered if she didn't feel usurped by me taking over her role as queen after the marriage. The days slowly merged into each other for Paige. Her schedule was so full everyday, with planning the wedding, opening buildings, attending fundraisers and being tutored in Danish everyday. Her tutor, a very strict Danish woman, called Inga, was unforgiving. Sighing mightily each time Paige made a mistake. She was starting to feels she was back in preschool. Danish was such a difficult language to learn, but Eddie, ever supportive, listened night after night, while she practiced, managing not to laugh at her idiotic mistakes. Her days also kept her away from Eddie, whose schedule was even more hectic than hers. Running a country seemed so exhausting. Some nights, while having a conversation, he would just doze off. He seemed so tired all the time and Paige worried about him. She knew he wanted to be the best king Denmark had ever had, having promised that to his father before he passed away. But Eddie was slowly burning himself out and it seemed Paige couldn't help him. She slowly lowered his head onto her lap and played softly with his hair, stroking is noble forehead. She never knew that love like this was possible. Leaning down slowly, she lightly brushed her lips over his sleeping eyelids. Breathing in deep, she savored is manly smell. Moments like these were so far and wide between, she had to cherish each of them. Slowly, extracting herself from his bed, she laid his head on a pillow, carefully removed his shoes and socks, smiling at his big beautiful white feet and throwing a comforter over him. Bending over to softly kiss him goodnight, he suddenly murmured her name. Feelings Paige had never felt, came rushing to the surface, tears forming in her eyes. Smiling down on him, she whispered, \"I love you too, my sweet Eddie.\" Glancing outside the door into the hallway, Paige slipped out of Eddie's room and made her way down the hall with her shoes in her hand. Quietly slipping into her room, she decided she would speak to the queen tomorrow about a short vacation before the wedding. Taking an early stroll in the gardens was one of Paige's favorite things about the palace. She wondered if she would ever get tired of the beauty of everything here. Paige's thoughts was interrupted by Zoren. \"Miss Paige, Eddie was looking for you.\" \"Thanks Zoren. I was just admiring the gardens again. Does this ever seem ordinary? I can't imagine ever getting used to this.\" Zoren nodded thoughtfully. \"You see, miss Paige, you and I never grew up like this, so to us this will always be a magical place. And may I say, since your arrival, it's been even more special.\" \"Zoren, you are so kind, thank you so much\" Paige exclaims enveloping him in a hug. \"And what is this? Zoren, are you trying to steal away my girl?\" Zoren awkwardly backs away, blushing. \" No your highness, of course not!\" Eddie elbows Zoren playfully. \"I'm watching you!\" Taking Paige's hand in his, Eddie kisses it tenderly. \"Where did you dissapear to last night?\" Paige frowns mockingly. \"Well, my fiancée fell asleep in the middle of my story, so I had no choice but to leave. I guess he finds me boring.\" Eddie laughs heartily and pulls her close. \"So sorry love, I was dead tired, but I'm all rested now.\" He winks at her playfully. Paige looks at him seriously. \"Eddie, I've been meaning to talk to you about this.\" She pulls him down next to her on a garden bench. \"You are so overtired and overworked, don't you think you need a break? Surely a few days away from the palace could do us good? I'm worries about you, you're pushing yourself too hard.\" Eddie glances away, seeming to think about it. \"Paige, I have many responsibilities and the people depend on me. I can't let them down. I too wish we could spend more time together, but a king can't just think about himself.\" He takes her face in both his hands. \"I do love you, Paige and I know just how many sacrifices you make for me, but please be patient with me. I'm still trying to prove to the country I can be a good king. I promise everything will be better after the wedding.\" Paige pulls Eddie closer and leans her head on his shoulder. \"I love you, Eddie. I know the pressures and the sacrifices and our love is strong enough to handle them, but all I'm asking is a few days. Please just try? For me?\" Looking up at him through her eyelashes, smiling seductively she pleads: \"Pretty please?\" Eddie laughs and pulls her close for a kiss, mumbling against her lips. \"How can I ever say no to you?\" Running his finger over her lower lip he leans in and kisses her softly and urgently. \"So where are we going to go with the yacht? What should I pack? Is it cold there this time of year or can we swim?\" Paige was all flustered surrounded by clothes and suitcases. Eddie agreed to 4 days alone on the royal yacht Dannebrog, but was very secretive about where they were sailing to. Arrabella was sitting cross legged on the the bed, laughing at Paige's dilemma. \"O, dear Paige! It's summer. Bring bikini's and sexy underwear. You'll be alone. Read my lips: ALONE. Even Zoren is staying. Eddie was very adamant. Only the most necessary crew will be on board, so you will have total privacy.\" She sighs, \"I wish I could have some privacy. I hate my life.\" Paige gives Arabella a soft hug, \"I know, believe me, I do sympathize, but you're young and someday you will also meet someone you love and it will make all this seem irrelevant.\" Arabella sticks out her tongue and snorts. \"Not soon enough, I tell you!\" \"Now come on, Ari, no jokes, what should I pack?\" \"ROYAL VACATION\" This was nothing like Paige expected. The yacht was the biggest thing she ever saw. Eddie tried telling her the history beforehand, but she just couldn't take it all in. It was so big and it was all theirs for four glorious days. There was also promises of four beautiful sunny days ahead. Everything seemed so opulent and their huge bedroom with it's king size bed even made her blush a little, which made Eddie smile. As the yacht was leaving the harbor, the sun was just setting, so they had some cocktails on the deck, served by white suited waiters. They reclined in the deck chairs, holding hands, sipping sweet drinks, drinking in the last rays of the sun. This was so perfect. It's been days since Paige had seen Eddie this relaxed. \"So Eddie, what's on the menu for tonight?\" she teased. He smiled, his teeth glinting in the setting sun. \"Well, I do believe room service and for desert, I am all yours.\" We looked at each other, our smiles disappearing and an urgency replacing them. Eddie pulled me up into his arms and off we were to the bedroom, all ideas of drinks and room services forgotten. Waking up to the gentle rocking of the yacht, Paige stretched her arm over the bed and felt for Eddie. She was surprised to find his side of the bed empty. Stretching out languidly, she remembered last night. Smiling to herself, she pulled Eddie's pillow closer and breathed in it's smell. She never seemed to get enough of Eddie, always wanting more. She never imagined love could feel like this. Smiling she closed her eyes and tried to relive the previous night. \"Good morning my lover.\" Opening her eyes, Paige saw Eddie standing at the edge of the huge bed, dressed in boxer shorts and nothing else, holding a tray of breakfast. \"Are you hungry? After all, we skipped dinner.\" Paige smiled seductively. \"Only hungry for you, but a piece of toast won't do any harm.\" Laughing, Eddie carefully placed the tray on the bed and joined her under the covers. Paige grabbed a piece of toast and took a huge bite. \"Mmm, I didn't realize I was so hungry.\" She handed a piece to Eddie and caught him staring at her bare breasts and quickly covered up with a sheet. Eddie smiled lasciviously at her. \"Must say, I'm hungry for you as well.\" Paige stared mockingly shocked at him. \"My, my, the king is not as civilized as believed.\" Eddie took the piece of toast gently out of her hand and slid the sheet down her shoulders again. He kissed her neck, slowly kissing downward towards her shoulder, feeling her shiver, he gently brushed his hand over her breast, bringing his other hand around her neck and pulling her closer and letting it slide very slowly down her back. His kisses became deeper and more passionate, leaving Paige no choice but to grip him tight and press herself against him, causing the breakfast tray to fall to the floor. Both of them ignored it, lost in their passion for each other. The sky was so blue and the water such a clear turquoise. Paige was a little self conscious about the very tiny white bikini Arabella made her pack, but Eddie seemed thoroughly appreciative. The sun was pleasantly hot and the water cool. They swam for hours, resting on deck, drinking cocktails. After lunch Eddie took Paige snorkeling, but she refused to go diving, arguing that girls from Wisconsin do not scuba dive. They spent the afternoon lounging on the deck trying, but failing to keep their hands off each other. Their nights were spent indulging themselves in each other. Their love growing each day. On the third day, Eddie surprised Paige, with a trip to the mainland. \"This is a small coastal village called, Fåborg. We are going to spend the day here, site seeing and eating some seafood. What do you think?\" Eddie looked at her enquiringly. \"I'd love that! Do you know that the only places in Demark I've seen is Copenhagen and the airport? What will the people think of their future queen?\" Eddie laughed. \"Paige, the people love you, even if you've only seen the airport!\" Eddie rented them a convertible car for the day. I seemed like he went mostly unrecognized, but she couldn't be sure. Danes were much more reserved than Americans and not prone to spectacles. The village of Faborg was so quaint and beautiful, with narrow cobbled streets and pavement café's. They stopped for Carlsberg beers at a street side café and had a lunch of the freshest prawns Paige ever tasted. The sat for hours, Eddie telling her about the history of the town and watching the locals and tourists go by. Before long the sun was starting to set and they had to return to the yacht. Driving slowly along the coast, Eddie stopped the car at a deserted beach and opened the door for Paige. \"Shouldn't we be getting back to the yacht before it gets too dark, Eddie?\" Eddie just smiled secretly and helped her out of the car. \"We have lots of time and remember that surprise I promised you in Baltimore?\" Paige frowned. That seemed so long ago. \"What surprise?\" But Eddie just gently lead her to the edge of the lapping waves and held both her hands in his, looking deep into her eyes. \" I know that coming to Denmark, meant giving up your dreams of joining \"Doctors without Borders\" or practicing medicine at all.\" Paige started to say something, but Eddie held a finger to her lips. \"Please let me finish. I love you, everything about you, Paige. I love your determination, your hopes and your dreams. I do not want you to give up your dreams for me, so I have thought long and hard about a way to keep your dream alive. As you know Denmark have great hospitals, but a lot of people in our rural communities never get the chance for the fantastic medical care the bigger towns and cities offer. I have spoken at length with our minister of Health and he's agreed to fund several mobile hospitals with quality care and good health care practitioners on board to deliver free medical service for everyone in the rural parts of Denmark. And I want you to organize and run it.\" Eddie looked at Paige expectantly, not knowing what reaction to expect. When Paige looked up, there were tears in her eyes. \"Eddie, I don't know what to say. It's amazing and wonderful, but what about after we're married, surely I will have other responsibilities?\" \"Of course, but once the clinic is up and running, you can still act as chair person and help to make decisions about the type of care needed. I'm sure you could do it all, my love.\" He looked at her so tenderly and with such confidence that Paige realized he was right. She would try. Why not be a queen and a doctor? Could it work? Maybe, just mayby it could. \"What would your mother say? Does she know?\" Eddie smiled. \"Well, she was the one who suggested it, after she saw how heartbroken I was after we called off our engagement. She suggested that sometimes dreams can change, if given the opportunity.\" Paige was dumbstruck. She just couldn't believe it. Queen Rosalind understood. Perhaps she had dreams as well, before she became queen. Grabbing Eddie around his neck, she hugged him fiercely. He lifted her up and looking deep into her dark eyes, he slowly bent his face towards her and kissed her gently, unaware of the photographers hiding behind the dunes. \"BACK TO REALITY\" Zoren was waiting for them with a grim face as they deboarded the yacht. He silently handed Eddie a stack of newspapers. Eddie frowned and opened them. The headlines shocked Paige. It was filled with pictures of them kissing on the beach in Farborg. \"Saucy vacation for king and his American!\" \"King's naughty vacation\" \"Fun in Farborg!\" Paige looked up at Eddie and saw his mouth set in a grim line. \"Zoren, how did they find out? Nobody knew our schedule. How did this happen?\" Zoren shrugged. \"We are trying to find out Your Majesty, but I should warn you that your mother is furious.\" Eddie nodded. \"I should expect so.\" Paige felt like crying. It was such a wonderful four days, why should it end like this? They did nothing wrong. Surely a king can kiss his future queen. Paige kept all of this to herself, not wanting to upset Eddie more. He was very quiet on the way back to the palace, only lightly holding her hand. Queen Rosalind was waiting as they arrived and ushered them into her study. As she closed the door, Eddie started talking. \"I know mother. Your don't have to say it. We saw the newspapers. It was totally out of context as always.\" Eddie looked furious. Paige have never seen him this mad. \"Paige, I know this is new to you, but this kind of publicity is not good for the royal family. We have a lot of enemies, who would like nothing more than to find a reason to demand Edvard to abdicate the throne. These tawdry stories display us as spoiled, arrogant royals spending the hard earned cash of hardworking Danes.\" Eddie sat down in a chair, his head in his hands. Paige leaned down and placed her hand on his back in a soothing gesture. \"I'm so sorry Queen Rosalind. What can I do to make this right?\" \"Nothing my dear. You will have to lie low for a few weeks till this blows over. In the mean time, Edvard, keep your head high and admit to nothing.\" Eddie looks up at his mother questioningly. \"What about the wedding arrangements?\" The Queen thinks to herself. \"You know what? I think a wedding is the ideal thing to take the peoples' minds off all the tabloid press. Why not set a date, Paige? What do you think?\" Paige smiles at Eddie. \"The sooner the better, I think.\" He smiles back at her and takes hold of her hand, stroking it softly. \"Why not? We're in love and we're getting married.\" \"Good.\" The Queen nods approvingly. We shall start immediately. Paige, please be available over the next few weeks.\" Paige smiles her. \"Of course!\" That night Eddie is very quiet over dinner, barely speaking to anyone. Arabella, as usual takes over the whole conversation, discussing wedding dress designers, shoes, guests to invite and of course which date she should invite. Paige tries to engage Eddie in the conversation, but he stays withdrawn. After dinner Eddie rises suddenly and disappears from the room, leaving Paige, Arabella en Queen Rosalind alone. The Queen lays her hand over Paige's. \" Eddie is under so much pressure. He is the youngest king of Denmark in 500 years. He has such a lot to prove and feels he's disappointing his father with the slightest mistake. You must try and understand. Sometimes a queen should just be there, waiting in the wings, until her king needs her.\" Paige nods and busy herself with rearranging her cutlery. \"O hell, Mother, Edvard is just a pain! He doesn't have to be perfect all the time!\" Arabella exclaims. \"Arabella, mind your mouth! Edvard is king and you will treat him with respect.\" The harsh words succeeded in silencing Arabella, but she was still fuming. Paige quietly excused herself and went up to her room. After a long bath, Paige puts on her robe and goes down to the kitchen to make herself a cup of tea to help her sleep. She has a feeling that sleep will not make it's appearance quickly tonight. Opening the kitchen door, Paige is startled to see Eddie already sitting at the kitchen table, his head bowed. She walks over to him and gently places her hand on his shoulder. Startled, he turns around and grabs her into a tight embrace, nestling his head on her shoulder. Surprised to feel hot tears seeping through her robe. \"Eddie, what is wrong? Please, talk to me.\" Wiping his eyes, Eddie sits down again and motions for Paige to sit down too. Searchingly she looks into his eyes, wishing she knew the right words to say, to make him feel better. \"Sometimes I truly don't know if I'm fit to be king.\" Paige started to interrupted him, but he grabbed her hand and squeezed tightly. \"Please let me finish.\" Eddie sighs deeply. \"I never wanted to be king, to have all this responsibility, but when I met you and saw how hard you fought for what you wanted and how determined you were, I knew I could one day be a good king of Denmark too. I just didn't expect to have to do all this so soon. When my father died, I thought I could do it and Lord knows I really tried. Some days I thought I would make it work, but days like today, I really have doubts whether I can do it. Paige, it's going to be so difficult for us both. We will be under a magnifying glass constantly and these things, like today's tabloids will happen over and over again. I know I won't get through it without you, but what if you one day decide you've had enough. This is not your world. I feel like a monster who abducted the girl out of her wonderful world into my harsh one. I'm so scared you'll leave me and I couldn't blame you if you did. You shouldn't have to put up with this.\" He looks searchingly into her eyes. Paige gets up and sits herself down on his lap and wrap her arms around him. \"Eddie, I love you. I love you too much to ever leave you. No matter what comes our way, we will get through it. Just promise me one thing. Never exclude me. Tell me everything. Lay all your burdens on me too. We are a team and you will be the best king Denmark have ever seen, we will make sure of it.\" Leaning her face down to his, she kissed him tenderly, while he clung to her tightly. Queen Rosalind slowly closed the kitchen door again, a small smile on her face. \"WEDDING ARRANGEMENTS\" The whole of Denmark was thrown into a royal wedding frenzy. Newspaper headlines screamed \"Royal Wedding\". People in the streets of Copenhagen were all wearing t-shirts with Edvard and Paige pictures on them. Queen Rosalind was true to her word about starting immediately and the royal wedding arrangements started with a vengeance. Paige spent mornings with her Danish tutor, Inga and afternoons meeting with dress designers, having shoe fittings, deciding on colors for the wedding and fonts for the wedding invitations. She was constantly besieged with calls from her mother too, only to excited her only daughter is getting married. Evenings was spent with Eddie and a dance tutor, teaching her traditional Danish dances. There was also royal etiquette lessons from the queen herself and long discussions into the night with Eddie about the guest list. Since Paige knew none of the royal family, except Arabella and the queen, Eddie had to help her learn with the aid of photographs of each royal, to avoid Paige being ignorant at their wedding. Everything was such a whirlwind of arrangements, that when Paige awoke one morning, stiff after dance lessons, she realized that she'd be a bride, a queen and a wife in less than two weeks! This made her sit up shocked in bed, her dark hair a wild halo around her head, when Eddie walked in carrying two huge cups of coffee. \"Oh, wow! Paige, what a beautiful bed head you have!\" he jokingly teased her, handing her a cup. Embarrassed, Paige tried to pat down her hair, but Eddie took the cup from her hands, put it on the nightstand and bundled Paige into his arms and whispered into her neck. \"You are the most desirable girl in the world and I can't wait to be your husband.\" Paige smiled lightly and undid the belt of his robe and slid her hands underneath his nightshirt, gripping him close to her. \"I love you too or should I say'Jeg elsker dig også!'\" Eddie pulled back surprised and smiled ecstatically. \"Paige, that's perfect! I'm so proud of you. One of these days, we'll be married and you'll be running those mobile hospitals like a real Dane.\" Paige was so glad to see Eddie this happy. \" I have another surprise for you, but you will have to get a robe on before I can show you.\" Paige looked at him enquiringly and with a smile jumped out of bed and grabbed her robe that was draped over a chair. Hastily putting it on, hands on the hips, Paige declared, \"I'm ready for my surprise!\" Eddie started laughing and at that moment her mother and father walked in the door! \"Mom, Dad!\" She ran to them and hugged both fiercely. Her father seemed a little flustered with the location, but he hugged her warmly, kissing her on the cheek. Glancing around to Eddie, Paige smiled. \"Why didn't you tell me?\" Her mom smiled secretively. \"We wanted to surprise you sweetheart and Eddie was kind enough to help organize our early flights. We just couldn't' wait to be here.\" Her mother sat with her on the bed, admiring the beautiful room. Her dad still looked totally out of place in the opulent setting. Luckily Eddie realized this. \"Ben, how about we guys go over to the stables and I can show you our horses.\" Her father seemed relieved and throwing Paige and her mother a last look, he left with Eddie. \"I think your father still haven't really forgiven Eddie about lying about all this\", her mother gestured around the room. \"I guess your father imagined you marrying a local boy, even a doctor, he certainly never imagined this. I think he feels a bit left out.\" Paige hugged her mom again. \"I love you mom!\" Hugging like this is how Arabella found them. \"Oooh, more hugging Paige?\" Smiling widely, Arabella walked over to the bed and held out her hand. \"Hello, you must be mrs Morgan. I'm Arabella, so nice to finally meet you.\" Paige's mother stood up and enveloped Arabelle in a hug as well. Arabella smiled sweetly. \"I will have to get used to all these hugs!\" Mrs Morgan smiled at Arabella. \"What a beautiful girl you are. Paige has told me so much about you. I suspect Paige has always wanted a sister, so I'm so glad she has you now.\" Arabella practically preened at the compliment. \"Well, I'm just getting Paige for a wedding dress fitting!\" Pulling Paige up from the bed, Arabella shuffles her out the door with mrs Morgan following behind. Mrs Morgan had tears in her eyes while Paige tried on the wedding dress. Layers, upon layers of soft chiffon fell in tiers from the fitted bodice, revealing a low back. Trying on the royal veil and crown really opened the waterworks for Paige's mother. Paige just smiled, knowing her mother was just happy. Arabelle kept flitting about, adjustjing here and there and talking about make-up and shoes. Finally finished, Paige was dressed in her robe again and this time she introduced her mother to Marguerite, who was designing a dress for her mother as well. She left her mother and Marguerite discussing cut, fabric and color, to get dressed. When Paige entered her room, she was surprised to find her father sitting in the chair by the window. He looked up when she entered. \"Dad? Is everything alright?\" Her father gave her a sad smile. \"Everything is fine pumpkin. I was just sitting here wondering about things.\" Paige looked at her father questioningly. \"Are you happy Paige?\" The question shocked Paige. \"Of course Dad! I love Eddie and I love his family. The Danish people has accepted me so easily and I'm really learning to love this country.\" He stared out the window thoughtfully. \"Eddie says, you are taking Danish lessons and etiquette lessons as well as learning more about the Danish history. I was just wondering if this is what you want? You've always wanted to be a doctor, even since you were a little girl. I just never imagined you in this setting.\" He waves his hand around the room. \"Dad, I know this is a bit much, it took me a long time to get used to, but I am truly happy. Did Eddie tell you about the mobile hospital I will be running and organizing after the wedding? He did it just for me, knowing how hard it must be to give up my dream of being a doctor. He is the kindest most wonderful man I've ever met and he makes me very happy.\" Her father took her hand and smiled fondly at her. \"I was so worried that you were giving up everything for Eddie, but I can now see I was wrong. Eddie is a great guy and we really like him. Those vacations he spent with you on the farm, made me see him as just another guy, a third son maybe, but now, seeing him here…..\" he trails off. \"It's just so much, the maids and guards and everything is so different than what we are used to.\" Paige reached around her dad's neck and gives him a hug. \"Eddie is just the same Eddie as always. Here he just has an important job to do and all these trappings are really not that important, but thank you for being concerned about me, but truly Dad, I have never been this happy.\" Satisfied, her father smiles up at her. \"So are you going to give me the full tour? Eddie had some business to attend to.\" That evening the Morgans and the royal family had an informal dinner in the small dining room. Queen Rosalind really tried to make Paige's parents feel welcome. Conversation was stinted at first, but Eddie did his best to include her father in the conversation. Eddie discussed the whole range of farming activities in Denmark, as well as new methods being used in farming, comparing them to methods used in America. Soon everyone was chatting away unselfconsciously. Paige met Eddie's eyes over the table a few times, thanking him with unspoken words for trying so hard. He rewarded her with a wink. The Morgans sat with Eddie and Paige, drinking wine on the balcony facing the east courtyard, till late in the night. Paige asked about her brother Mikey's baby boy, also named Ben, after his grandfather. Eddie and Ben discussed some duck hunting later that week. Soon the Morgans were seriously tired and excused themselves. Paige stood up and sat herself down on Eddie's lap, wrapping her arms around him, cradling her head on his shoulder. \"Thanks for today. It's one of your best surprises yet.\" Eddie lifted her chin with his finger, looking deep into her eyes, before kissing her. His kisses were deep and slow, leaving a burning inside her, that Paige could not deny. Without speaking he pulled her up and led her by the hand to his bedroom.

Eddie is on the line for you!\" Paige looks up from her text"},{"Movie":"Victor Frankenstein","Title":"Sensations","Author":"imitateslife","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11955095","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Rubatosis: The unsettling awareness of your own heartbeat. On nights when he could not sleep and could not work, Victor would lay awake in bed, listening to the London night: the link-boys and prostitutes hawking their wares, drunken men stumbling their ways home, the occasional alley cat yowling in the distance. But some nights, there was no sound on Verner Street. Some nights, it was just Victor alone in his bed. His mind would wander… to the creature – Gordon – down below in the basement. To Igor in the next room, soundly sleeping, breathing lightly, curled up so small on the bed like he wasn't yet accustomed to having space to call his own. But on nights like tonight, his mind focused only on his own heartbeat. The way it rhythmically ticked the time away. His heart pumped blood in and out. What a wonder, the circulatory system! One could damage a liver, lose a kidney, but to lose a heart…! Oh, as much as Victor believed the brain to be the source of all life, he knew that no creature could survive without its heart. He wondered how many others out there appreciated the ebb and flow of blood, like tides, crashing through their veins, keeping them alive. He marveled at the sound of blood in his ears, the ticking sensation that bloomed in his forehead. Surely he was not the only one who lay awake at night. Surely he was not the first to discover how glorious a heartbeat was. But he would be the first to make a heart beat after it had ceased. He would be the first to imbue life into dead tissue. He drifted to sleep, wondering if ever Gordon would know the powerful, vulnerable feeling of hearing one's own heartbeat. A question he would never have the answer to.[Chapter 2] Opia: The ambiguous intensity of looking someone in the eye, which can feel simultaneously invasive and vulnerable. The words escaped Victor's lips deliberately as he looked at Igor: \"From this day forth, you are to be my partner.\" Blue eyes met blue eyes and it seemed an eternity before either man moved or spoke. Victor wondered if Igor hadn't heard him, but the way Igor's wide eyes lit from inside was more than enough to tell Victor that he had been heard. How many times before now had they locked eyes? How many times had Victor excitedly grabbed Igor by the face and pulled him in so that their foreheads might touch? They had been close before, much closer than this, and yet there was something both terrifying and riveting about this moment. Here was a man who had had no prospects in life less than a year ago. Less than a year ago, in fact, he had had no hopes of standing upright, doing great scientific work, amounting to more than a circus freak. Knowing all this as Igor's eyes widened made Victor feel terribly intrusive. He could not read minds – no man could – but he would have sworn he could see the parade of Igor's previous life and the months preceding this moment play out as the other realized just how much his world was changing. But as for Victor, he knew that his own eyes held emotion. Intense emotion. And it frightened him. Frightened him to think that Igor could read him just as easily. Read all the excitement, hope, fear, and dare he say yearning in Victor's eyes. Surely the emotions swam up into his gaze. Surely Igor knew in this moment, if he had not known before how much he mattered… How much he mattered to a man who had not cared for another person in over a decade. It made Victor feel small, despite his proud stance, and see through. He wondered if Igor knew the very depths to which Victor cared for him. He wondered if Igor could even guess what he meant not only to their enterprise, but to the man who had given him a name and a home and a purpose in life. Victor had thought Igor would be nothing more than a means to an end… But perhaps Kant was right. Perhaps people – certainly Igor – were ends in themselves. A sharp gasp finally escaped Igor's lips. Realization. A smile. But not understanding. Not full, true understanding. Victor broke eye contact first. \"We have a busy day ahead of us,\" he said in his brusque way, walking towards the stairs. \"Presentation is in Hall H, eight o'clock sharp and there's much to do before then. I suggest you get some rest.\" He was at the top of the stairs, ready to fling the cellar doors open, when he heard Igor's voice call out from the bottom of the steps. \"Victor!\" Victor paused, but could not bring himself to turn around. Could not bring himself to meet Igor's eyes once more. \"Thank you,\" Igor said in that quiet, awed, and breathy way of his. That innocent voice so unlike Victor's that it astounded him every time thatthis was the man who had become his closest confidant. Still, Victor allowed himself a secret smile. \"Good night, Igor,\" he said. \"I shall see you in the morning.\"[Chapter 3] Sonder: The realization that each passerby has a life as vivid and complex as your own. It unsettled him, looking into Inspector Turpin's eyes. Here was a man who was everything Victor was not. Pious. Disciplined. Religious . It was easier to dismiss him as an ignorant fool. An enemy of progress. But now as they stood upon the ancient castle walls, Victor the only thing between Turpin and a Creature incapable of reason or empathy, something struck Victor about those dark eyes. There was life in them. So unlike the milky gaze of his Prometheus. There was life. Fear. Hope. Worlds Victor could not begin to fathom. There was a man, who despite his dogged pursuit of Victor, his raging condemnation of all Victor stood for, would risk his life to possibly save Victor's. And he understood something. There was a spark in the eyes of men and women – living men and women – that told histories, thoughts, hopes, dreams fears. It made them complex. It made them alive . Whatever Turpin thought of Victor… Whatever Victor thought of Turpin… They were the same in that their eyes made them human. And whatever Prometheus was, it was not human. Not nearly as worthy of protection as the man standing with a gun trained upon the Creature. And when the Creature flung Turpin into a mass of live wires, the bellow that rose from somewhere deep within Victor was truly one of despair. He never wanted this. He had only wanted to preserve life. And in the end, he destroyed it. He would never know the secrets Turpin's large, dark eyes had once held. No one ever would. And if he had the time, Victor would mourn the loss. Turpin, Finnegan, Dettweiler… and the other dozen men who had given their lives – their complex, rich, mysterious lives – in slavish devotion to this dream of Victor's. He had failed them all. Curtailed their lives. But there was no time to mourn. Only time to get to safety. Only time to wonder how long it would be before it was his life or Igor's taken by the monster.[Chapter 4] Mauerbauertraurigkeit: The inexplicable urge to push people away, even close friends who you really like. Three's a crowd and all that. He'd said as much to Igor in his letter, but there was so much more he wished he could have told him. How could he express jealousy at a time like this? A time when he should have just been grateful to be alive, that Igor was alive? Why did it gnaw at him so that he wanted to be the one Igor rushed to in relief? Better not to question why. Better only to push it down deep, gain some distance, stop caring so much. Besides I think you've probably had enough of my work. How much pain had he caused? In the last year alone, creating monsters, making demands, striving for immortality? He had failed in the end. More than failed, knowing that the lives he had inadvertently taken and those he had altered forever would have been spent in, if not the idylls of peace , then at least blissful ignorance of what lay beyond death. His work. He was ashamed to own it and he was ashamed of who he'd let it make him. He'd once been full of ideals and promise. Now what was he? A fugitive? A mad scientist? Doing the devil's work as Turpin had suggested? Victor scarcely knew. All he knew was instead of replacing fear with hope, he'd done quite the opposite. Truth be told, you've probably had enough of me. Worst of all, he knew that he had alienated the one friend – the only person – who understood him. The only living being upon this earth he cared for. He had taken a fragile trust, a friendship and crushed it between his hands as if it had been made of flimsy, delicate glass. The shards stuck in his hands and made him bleed, made him weep. Whatever he and Igor had been – and whatever they could have been – had been decimated by his careless hand. One could only spend so much time creating monsters before becoming one. And somewhere along the way, Victor had crossed the line. Unfit for human companionship, he sentenced himself to a life of solitary study, of travel. Our time together is done. Our achievements are in the past… And our discoveries will probably never be known. He didn't know what hurt worse: consigning himself to obscurity or fading in Igor's memory. But I will always think of you fondly. And always as my friend. … You are and will always remain my greatest creation. And that was why he had to leave. He was a monster and Igor was a man. Igor was happy, with a future before him. And Victor, enamored with his greatest creation, would never have the courage to say what he really felt. He could sign the letter \"Your friend\" but he would always wish he had dared sign it \"Love\". But he was a monster and Igor was a man. And as Victor well knew, monsters would always eventually kill men, even those who most helped to shape them.: ","Summary":" Rubatosis: The unsettling awareness of your own heartbeat. On nights when he could not sleep and co"},{"Movie":"Passengers, 2016","Title":"Super Nova","Author":"The Peppercorn Duelist","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12330935","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Homestead's Avalon glided through the depth of space. It had been flying for thirty years without any trouble. Not that anyone was awake to realize this because everyone on board was in a hibernation. No one needed to be since the ship could repair itself with diagnostics and the little robots on the ship that worked hard to make sure everything was okay for when the 5000 passengers would wake up in 90 years. Homestead prepared for anything. The ship computers were very advanced. They could even make new flight plans in case of asteroid fields. There was also a shield protecting the ship in case of space debris and the computers could also analyze how big the debris was to power up the ship. Inside the ship were many, many rooms for the hibernating people inside and shops and various restaurants in case people didn't want the cafeteria food. Homestead thought of everything. Especially when it came to the hibernation pods. The people inside were safe and could never wake up, at least until four months before the ship would land on Homestead 2. Nothing could ever wake The Avalon was flawless and indestructible. But they also said that about the Titanic. All it took was an ice berg. And all it took for the Avalon to crash was an asteroid.[Chapter 2] Jim was awake now. He felt dizzy and weak, like he had just gotten off the G Force at a carnival after eating too many elephant ears. The hologram that greeted him when he woke up told him that it was normal to feel confused and ill after hibernation. He sort of remembered the doctors telling him about the sickness before being put under. He couldn't remember much. It WAS 120 years ago after all. The dirty blonde still didn't expect to be so screwed up though. His vision and mind were blurry and spinning. The hologram had kept talking despite 'knowing' that it was normal to be confused and ill after waking up. Information flew over his head, he tried desperately to keep up. But there was just a little too much. It was just like high school when he had to try to explain the symbolism of the color red in Of Mice and Men. He just didn't get it. But he was going to try! \"You will have a class about how to live on a colony, you are in group two since you are an engineer,\" the lady in the hologram said as the hibernation pod drove out of the chamber. \"We will allow you and the others to get ready in your rooms before the class in thirty minutes.\" \"Oh... Okay,\" said Jim simply. What else was there to do? The pod took him down a hallway then into an elevator. When the doors closed, he heard and felt the pod make a loud THUNK noise, as if it was bolting itself to the floor somehow. Probably with magnets? He thought, trying to put his engineering knowledge to use. The elevator dinged and suddenly the pod made a SHINK noise before rolling out the door and into another hallway. \"On this floor and down the hall you will find your room, I will light up the door for you.\" The hologram said as the pod's straps let go of Jim and a small ramp appeared so he could get out. Jim nodded and got off the pod. His legs felt wobbly and heavy as he walked. He tried not to fall and was doing really well if he had to say so himself! He was glad that no one else was around to see him struggling. He looked down the hall, which was painted all white and looked really bright thanks to the lighting, then a door glowed blue. That must've been his room. Once he got to the door, the hologram's voice came out of his bracelet and told him to hold it against the door to open it. He did and nearly fell backwards at the sound of the door sliding open. The room was small and tiny but the engineer knew that it would have everything he needed for four months. Homestead did thing of everything after all! The hologram popped up once again on the wall, telling him to hold up his bracelet to the scanner to verify his luggage. It took him a minute despite just doing that to get to the room, but his mind was still foggy from hibernation. With that, the hologram smiled then disappeared. Jim figured he should get ready for his class. He put on a light blue button up shirt with long sleeves, regular old dark blue jeans with a brown belt and black Doc Martens that he would wear all the time back on Earth. He also put on a leather jacket, or was deciding if he should wear it... Then he wondered how he should wear it. He hung it over his shoulder like a male model then slid it back on then went back to throwing it over his shoulder, trying to figure out what would make him look the most cool. He only had one chance for a first impression after all! He decided to go with simply wearing it normally. On his way to the classroom, after the hologram popped out of his bracelet and told him where it was when he walked out of his room, Jim noticed that there wasn't any people around. Shit! Everyone must've been in their classes already or not awake quite yet. He started to run in the direction he was told. There was no one in the classroom when he got there. It was absolutely empty, save for some uncomfortable looking white benches in a half circle and a little stand for the hologram lady again. \"Everyone please sit down now.\" Jim looked around. There wasn't anyone. Part of him wondered if the hologram was simply programmed to say that at a certain time, regardless if the room was full... Or just had one person. Hesitantly, the blonde sat down in the second row of benches. \"Where is everyone?\" \"Save questions for the end, please.\" The hologram said before the room went dark and more holograms showed up behind her, though they were pictures of Homestead 2 rather than other versions of her this time. Jim closed his mouth but couldn't help but try to speak out as the hologram tried to talk. It kind of sounded like a commercial anyway, one he saw at least a dozen times before deciding to buy a discounted ticket for the colony. The thought that maybe he was just early came to mind. But something deep inside him was telling him that something was up... Once the class was over, the blond man ran out of the room and started calling out for someone. Anyone. He kept this up until he took the elevator to the main concord, floating up in the elevator due to lack of gravity for a second. \"Hello! Hello! Anyone?!\" But no one replied. He found a help machine and went to it. Surely this could help him! \"What do I do if I woke up from my hibernation pod?\" He asked once he touched the screen. The machine went on explaining stuff that didn't really help the man. Jim sighed and started searching for information on the hibernation pods. \"My pod malfunctioned and I woke up before anyone else. What do I do?\" \"That's not possible!\" The mechanical voice said, a hollow smile appearing on the screen. \"Our pods were designed to think if everything! They are flawless.\" \"Well if it's not possible, then how am I awake when no one else is?\" The machine just continued to praise Homestead technology. Jim wanted to tear his hair out or destroy the machine. But he knew that that wouldn't help. Maybe he should just look around for someone. Someone human. He remembered that the crew was supposed to wake up a month before the rest of the passengers. Maybe he woke up a day earlier than everyone else? Part of him was yelling that something was up, but he didn't want to listen. He went back to the machine and asked where the captain and crew were. It told him which floor but that it was only for specially permitted people or for emergencies. \"This is an emergency!\" He screamed before running to the elevator. The door to the captain's quarters was locked. Jim scanned his bracelet countless times only for the ship computer to tell him this was special access only. Furiously, he slammed his hand onto the reinforced metal. Pain shot through his hand, arm then body. He grit his teeth and bared it. There were more important things to do. And it didn't seem like his hand was smashed into pieces either. The man headed into the ship's storage facility to get his tools. He knew he needed to get into that room at any cost. He was back at the captain's door an hour later and got to work. He broke into the door hatch, hot wiring it to open the door... Only to reveal another door behind it. He peeked into the window, only seeing darkness. Jim knew he couldn't give up! He used every tool in his arsenal. His sledge hammer, his various buzz saws, and his blow torch when trying to hot wire the door open didn't work. Hours passed and he gave up. He was too exhausted to try to do anything else for now. He'd get back to it the next day, if no one woke up while he was gone anyway. After a hot shower and breakfast... On his way back through the main concord, he passed by the help machine again. The man let out a sigh, remembering how unhelpful it was. He shook his head and kept going. He passed by a bar and didn't pay it any mind. But he saw something in the corner of his eye. He stopped to do a double the triple take. A person! There was a man with dark hair and a red cost behind the bar! Him dashed to the bar, nearly tripping over himself. \"Oh my god! I'm so glad to see another person here...\" He said, wiping his face with the back of his hand. He felt sweat and grime slide off his face. Gross. He wish he showered before he saw this guy. Or wish that he looked less gross. The man smiled as he wiped a glass. \"What can I get you, Mister...\" \"J-Jim! James Preston... But call me Jim.\" He said, trying not to cry. \"What's your name?\" \"My name is Arthur... You seem like a whiskey man, Jim.\" Jim blinked. \"Uh. I guess.\" Was all he could muster as he started to sit down. As he sat, he noticed the man didn't have legs. Just a metal rod with a wheel. All his hope and relief came crashing down. This guy was just a robot. Arthur placed a glass of whiskey in front of him. \"What seems to be the problem, Jim?\" \"Well... You're a robot.\" Arthur laughed. \"Android technically. But yes.\" \"I was just hoping you'd be a person... I haven't seen anyone. At all. I think I woke up early...\" He muttered before taking a sip. \"I wish I knew how far we were... Wait. Have you seen anyone besides me?\" He said hopefully. Arthur shook his head. \"No, you're the first human I've seen in...\" Jim got up out of his seat before the android could finish. \"Shit. Well do you know where I can find out how far we are?\" \"I believe the observatory can help.\" Jim nodded and dashed into the main concord again and once again went to the help machine. \"Observatory!\" He dashed to the room once he got the directions. It was an empty room but he knew it wouldn't show anything until he spoke. \"Hello? How far is Homestead 2 from earth?\" The computer started up and showed Jim his home planet then a long white line appeared. It zoomed past Jim and just kept going. The \"camera\" moved towards another planet at the edge of the room, showing that earth was quite a ways a way from the new colony. \"Homestead 2 is a 120 year long journey. It is 60 light years away from earth.\" Jim nodded to himself. \"How far along are we right now?\" \"The Avalon is thirty years into its journey. We will reach Homestead 2 in 90 years.\" Jim's blood ran cold. Fear and panic exploded inside him like a volcano full of fireworks. He dashed out of the room, gasping for air while trying not to throw up. 90 years. That was why no one was on board! That was why the captain's door was closed! That was why Arthur said he was the only human he'd seen! Jim collapsed on the ground of the main concord. Somehow, he sort of always knew. But he had just hoped! He felt like crying. Part of him told him to suck it up, but he knew there wasn't any point. There wouldn't be anyone around to call him names or less of a man for crying. And who wouldn't cry in this situation? It was hopeless. There was no one to help on board. Everyone was asleep- but what if he sent a distress call?! Hope swelled inside him again as he dashed for what must've been the 60th time to the help machine. \"I need to send a message to earth!\" \"There's a machine that will allow video calls in this room.\" A map popped up and showed where the booth was. \"But it is very expensive-\" \"I don't care.\" Jim's legs and chest were hurting and tired from running, but he kept running anyway. The sooner he sent that call, the sooner people would be here to help! The man hit the button on the message desk, bringing up a window where he could record himself. \"To Homestead Headquarters... My name is James Preston and I'm a passenger on a The Avalon headed to Homestead 2. It's been 30 years since the ship left and I woke up too early. 90 years too early. My hibernation pod malfunctioned and nothing seems to help me. So someone please help!\" He hit end call and the message sent. \"We are 19 light years from earth. The message will get to earth when we are thirty five light years away. That will be $9000!\" The machine said. Jim simply got up and left. He was doomed.[Chapter 3] It had been weeks since Jim sent out that message. Or maybe it was only a few days ago. He didn't know. It had felt like weeks anyway. Panic slowly faded away, but it was quickly replaced with dread. No one was coming for him. No one was going to miraculously send a message to him telling him how to get back to sleep or at least tell him where the manuals for the hibernation pods were. A sliver of hope trickled into his heart, if he did manage to find some manuals for the ship... He could put his engineering degree to use and figure it out from there. Hopefully. As quickly as that tiny bit of hope came, it was soon smashed to pieces and those pieces were ground into dust. Why would it matter? With his luck, he'd probably end up dead. Somehow the pod would eject itself from the ship and into space and he'd wake up again... Only to die within seconds. The universe was cruel like that. Jim sighed as he sat at the bar, watching the android named Arthur wipe the same glass over and over again. \"Why do you do that?\" Jim asked annoyed. He felt a bit guilty for the way he said it, since it wasn't Arthur's fault that he was trapped for the rest of his life alone in space. \"Do what?\" The response went on to annoy the blond even more. \"Wipe that glass. There's no one here!\" Arthur laughed. \"I was programmed to. If a human just saw me standing here doing nothing, they'd be unnerved. So, when no one is here to order and there is no actual dirty dishes... I do this.\" Jim couldn't help but crack a little smile at that. He wasn't even sure why. But he was glad that it happened. \"There's a smile.\" Said Arthur, smiling himself. \"You've been so glum ever since you came back from the observatory deck.\" Jim rolled his eyes in response. \"Well, I am stuck on a ship all on my own for the rest of my life.\" \"I'm here with you.\" \"No offense Arthur, but a robot isn't quite the same as a human. Your programming is really advanced, but...\" Arthur nodded, \"I understand. But may I offer you some bartenderly advice, Jim?\" Jim blinked. \"Uh, sure.\" \"Instead of focusing on the negative, why don't you try to make the best of your situation?\" The blond froze. Make the best of his situation?! He was trapped on a metal can taking it's sweet time to a planet he might not ever see himself! What was there to make the best of? He had a crappy room... Wait. There was no one awake on the ship. There were thousands of empty rooms not being used... Oh, he knew where to start now. \"Thanks, Arthur.\" \"Anytime.\" Jim made his way to the captain's door again, grabbing a few of the tools he knew he'd need before heading back to the ship's dorms. Instead of heading to the crappy little closet he had, he went to the exclusive passenger's wing. He cracked open a door and got to work programming the door to read his bracelet to let him in. Whenever the actual owner of the room woke up, Jim was sure that they could easily reprogram the door. Whatever. The room was luxurious. It was colored porcelain with smooth white plastics and couches on the bottom floor, gold and silver with the walls decorated in cubes and hexagon shaped lights on the wall closest to the white spiraling staircase that lead to the bedroom. The floors were a smooth stainless obsidian tile. It was warm and inviting. The bathroom was also huge and had both a shower that a soccer team could fit inside and a Jacuzzi bathtub that could take up half of the room he was originally assigned. Jim dashed up the stairs and took in the sight of the bedroom; it was just a simple room with one large white floating bed with fluorescent lights surrounding it and a button that would slide out a glass closet. Surrounding the room were walls that were actually huge screens. \"Show me Denver, Colorado.\" He said, and instantly the screens surrounding the bed changed to a slideshow of his hometown. His heart ached at the sight, but it was comforting all the same. Jim went on to enjoy other things on the ship, like the gym, Olympic sized swimming pool, the various foreign restaurants where he could get whatever he wanted instead of just the basic menu that taunted him every day in the cafeteria, the arcade's dance game and the movie theater that seemed to have everything. This was the life! Or so it seemed. Everything had seemed so shiny and new at first. Food tasted better then, Hell, he even tried stuff that he wouldn't have dreamed of eating back on earth. But soon, he tried everything. It was just new! The games were fun but he soon mastered everything and had the top hundred scores. Where was there to go from the very top? The cheers and lights in the basketball court that would light up every time he scored seemed dull and too quiet, or deafening loud and annoying at times, now. The movie theater that seemed to have everything made? Well, it also had a lot of crap too and it seemed like there was just too much of that. The pool was nice, it was serene and still... Just like the ship he was trapped on alone. The dread that Arthur shooed away those few months ago was back, and it swallowed Jim whole. Everything seemed so grey, dull and morose... Or too bright and loud yet so hollow. The ship was huge and Jim had explored every inch of it, well the parts that he had access to anyway. The thought of breaking into places came to him from time to time, but what was the point? It'd just be another empty space. A ship this big needed people on it. Living, awake people. It was just a cruel reminder to Jim that he was alone. And because he was alone, Jim didn't bother to groom himself anymore. His dirty blonde hair became exactly that. It was long and fell flat against his head due to all the grease and dirt that built up. His beard grew and grew, it now resembled the hipster that spat in his drink that would serve him coffee back in Denver. But at least that guy groomed his unruly beard. Jim didn't even bother to change most of the time. He felt content in his filthy stained shirts. As content as a depressed hollow man could feel anyway. Sometimes he didn't even bother to put pants on. Who would yell at him? Exactly. No one. Arthur tried to give him hope, making Jim temporarily forget that the android wasn't... an android. It never worked, but Jim couldn't blame the bot for trying. Jim wandered along the empty halls. The empty, never ending halls. He kept going until he reached a door he wasn't sure he had come across before. Then again, all doors look the same after a while. He swiped his bracelet and it slid open, revealing a room with two spacesuits. He walked towards one, noticing how human like it was. It had two arms and two legs, unlike the single wheel that Arthur had. The only thing it didn't have was a face. Jim leaned against the suit before wrapping his arms around it in a tight hug. He wept when he realized that it wouldn't hug him back. Once he calmed down, he slipped into the suit and headed out the door. \"Hello James!\" a familiar voice called out. Jim blinked as the face of the hologram that appeared when he woke up showed up in his helmet. \"Would you like to take a walk outside?\" The hologram asked. He blinked again. Dumbly, he nodded and the hologram started explaining how the mechanics worked. If he pushed a button on the suit, the magnets in his boots would turn off and he would float, but he'd stay connected to the ship thanks to a tether that would automatically reattach itself or replace itself if he reached certain areas of the ship. \"Turn this knob and pull the lever to open the airlock, enjoy your walk!\" Jim opened the airlock and stood at the door outside, taking in the sight before he worked up the courage to finally step outside. He remembered the time his family drove to Anaheim when he was a kid and they were going through Nevada, or was it Utah? The desert was dark at night, one of the rare places that didn't seem to be covered in buildings. His dad stopped in the middle of the night, woke him and his mother up and they got out of the car. The sky was alive it seemed. It was awe inspiring. There wasn't any light pollution for miles and miles to cloud up the sky. The sky wasn't black-ish blue like Jim was used to, it was so many colors. There were billions and billions of stars and he swore he could see galaxies. He remembered feeling scared back then. He was going to fall into the sky and drown in the stars. That night in Utah had nothing on this very moment on the outside of the Avalon. The sight was that night sky times a thousand. Tears stung at his eyes at the sight. Slowly, Jim began to walk along the surface before deciding it was time to float. He hit the button and soon he began to drift into the nothing of space. Well, as far as the tether would allow him. He felt weightless. He felt like nothing. Probably because he was nothing. The nothing around him just proved how small and worthless he was. He had enough. He went back inside the ship, the hologram greeting him once again as the tether unhooked itself from the back of his suit. The words went in one ear and out the other. The silence that surrounded him outside still rang inside his ears like church bells. He was nothing. There was nothing here. Nothing was worth living for. Jim might as well become one with nothing. He turned towards the knob for the airlock and turned it. The door opened and he stood at the very edge of it. He had seconds to decide if he wanted to do this before the tether would automatically reconnect itself. Do it. There is nothing for you. Do it. What are you waiting for? Do it. No one would miss you. Do it. He shut the door and collapsed on the ground, weeping once again. Useless coward. Weeks passed since that event. It had apparently been almost a year since he had woken up, the only reason why Jim knew this was because Arthur told him. Jim had finally found the manuals for the ship in the expansive storage space. The ones on the hibernation pod had kept his attention the most for obvious reasons. He read it back to back numerous times, reading it while he ate, reading it when he was with Arthur, reading it when he was alone in his room. He could probably recite it from memory if he wanted. Once he felt confident enough that he could do it, Jim was inside the hibernation wing again and fiddling with the controls on his old pod. Hopefully, he would be back to sleep and awake with the rest of the crew this time. He was really starting to hate that word, hope. Since it never seemed to work out for him. Just like it didn't now! He was trapped inside the pod for several minutes. His breath fogged up the glass, reminding him that he wasn't getting enough oxygen. He felt light headed as he slammed on the glass, desperately trying to get the pod to open or the more unlikely option, break it so he could get out. Eventually, the doors slid open and the pod went upright. Jim coughed as he tried to take in as much air as he could. He definitely wasn't going to try that again anytime soon! Angrily, he got out of the pod and got out, every closed pod reminding him of his failure. On his way out of the room, something caught his eye. In the group of pods next to his, he noticed a woman with pale moonbeams for skin and light hair surrounding her peaceful, sleeping face like a white gold halo. Jim's heart throbbed. He walked to the pod, his hands shaking as it rested on the cool glass that shielded the woman from the horrors he was facing. He kind of envied her. She was asleep, like he should've been. He snorted, rolling his eyes as he tried to decide if he hated this woman for daring not be trapped like he was or if she was pretty and he would've liked her if she was awake. Christ. Would you listen to yourself? You're God awful, Jim. He couldn't believe what he was thinking. This woman did nothing wrong! Why was he thinking like this! He was complete scum! The man shot an apologetic look at the woman, only noticing how much prettier she was up close now. That made him feel worse. He looked at the name plate on the side. Aurora Lane. Journalist. Age 26. \"Aurora...\" If a buddy of his told him that he was naming his kid Aurora, Jim would've laughed in his face. Well, maybe not. But he would've asked \"Are you sure?\". But now, that name sounded like the most beautiful thing in existence. Just like the woman who bore it. He thought about her all the time, like he was a love sick puppy. He talked about the pretty woman he saw in the hibernation wing to Arthur, who looked pleased to see his only customer so happy. Or he would've been, if robots had actual emotions. One day, Jim decided to look her up on the ship computer. She was not only a journalist, she wrote many stories. Stories that spoke to him. He watched her video profile numerous times when he was taking breaks from her books. She was so funny and so kind. His heart ached as he realized that this woman would never give him the time of day even if she was awake. He was reminded of the girl that he liked in middle school. \"Not even if you were the last boy on earth!\" Jim shook the thought out of his head. He was 33, not 12 anymore. He shouldn't be thinking like this. Wanting to take his mind off of Aurora and that girl, Jim looked up other passenger's's profiles. Or at least, looked at the names and laughed at them all. The ones that stuck out among the 5000 names listed anyway. \"There's someone named Galaxy Pepper . Finally, there's someone the universe hates more than me.\" He laughed. Jim's days felt a little brighter ever since he discovered Aurora. Butterflies fluttered in his chest and he felt warm all over at the thought of her. Too bad she's in there and you're out here, wasting away. He closed his eyes. Here was life, reminding him of his awful fate once again. It was like the universe didn't want him to be happy, even just for a minute. It'd be a shame if something woke her up. Jim's eyes snapped open and he shot out of bed. No! No way! He couldn't! He tried to go throughout his days without thinking about it. He went back to reading the hibernation pod manuals to try to learn what he did wrong that time... Only to keep coming back to the pages explaining how to manually wake someone up. He would slam the book shut and throw it across the room. He found himself watching Disney movies, movies that his grandparent's grandparents watched back in the day. One that he liked watching was Sleeping Beauty, where the princess was a pretty blonde named Aurora... \"OH FUCK OFF!\" He said to himself, getting up and out of the theater when he realized what he was doing. Thoughts kept creeping in his mind and nagging him like his mother did when she wanted him to clean his room or to do his homework when he was a kid. Only this time it was worse. But those thoughts just kept screaming louder and louder. \"Arthur, I need advice.\" He finally asked, two months after he first started getting these thoughts. \"Yes?\" \"Say you were stuck on an island all by yourself. But you could wish someone there with you so you wouldn't be so alone. Would you do it? Even if you knew that it'd be trapping that person there with you forever?\" Arthur stood there. \"...This isn't really a robot question, Jim.\" \"Okay... So you know how I found the most beautiful, perfect, funny woman ever right?\" \"Miss Aurora, yes.\" \"Well... If I woke her up... Would that be the wrong thing to do?\" Arthur shook his head. \"What do you think?\" Jim sighed. \"It's... wrong. Forget I asked.\" Two days later, Jim was back at the bar talking about this situation again. \"But let's say that the ship malfunctioned and it just kills everyone in the pods. It'd be bad if I didn't rescue her right? Like, she'd be dead...\" \"I don't know, Jim. What do you think?\" A week later, Jim was back with another dilemma. And the next week. And the week after that. And after that. Two months later, Jim was inside the bathroom with scissors in hand. \"You're just going to cut your hair and beard. There's nothing fishy about that.\" He said the same thing as he showered and put on a fancy cologne that he stole from a shop. He said the same thing when he was in the hibernation wing, just to check for other people waking up by mistake. Nothing else. He sat beside Aurora's pod, his tool box in hand. Just in case. He opened up the panel on the side. Just in case. He slid open a drawer full of wiring just to make sure everything was functioning and like the page of the manual he had open just in case. Just in case... Suddenly, the lights and power shut down. It was dead silent. Jim heard his heart pounding and blood rushing to his face. He could hear a pin drop. Then the lights were back on and the sounds of all the machines beeping and turning back on and running were back. He looked at Aurora's panel and saw her heart rate looked and sounded normal. He looked at her neighbour's, it looked ok too. He looked behind him. Theirs was ok too. Then he heard rapid beeping and a THCK THCK THCK ! From across the room. Him ran towards the sound to check it out. The pods surrounding the one freaking out looked okay. Then he looked at the one pod. There was a woman twitching inside. Her skin was turning blue and frost started appearing on the inside of the glass. Her pod was malfunctioning. In the worst possible way. She was going to die by freezing to death. Without thinking, Jim ran back to Aurora and grabbed his tool box and ran back to the malfunctioning pod. He cracked open her panel and tried to manually restart the machine. He swapped certain wires and panels, hoping that'd do something. The machine turned off. Then clicked back on. It hissed as it, and the person inside, 'came back to life.' The pod suddenly moved upright and the various needles and plugs attached to the woman removed themselves. \"Oh God.\" He woke her up. By mistake. \"Hello, Miss Pepper.\" Said the familiar voice of the hologram as the doors to the pod slid open. Jim nearly snapped his neck as he looked at the panel on the side. Galaxy Pepper. Age 29. Doctor. It looked like he was stuck with the only other person the universe hated more than him.[Chapter 4] \"Hello Miss Pepper!\" The voice finally made Galaxy wake up. Her dark chocolate eyes stung as the bright white lights filled the room. She wanted to rub them but her arms felt so heavy. \"Your name is Miss Galaxy Pepper, yes?\" \"W-what?\" The woman said, the world was so blurry. \"Galaxy... Or Dr. Pepper.\" She wanted to laugh when she realized what she had just said, but she was too tired. \"You've been in hibernation, Galaxy. It's normal to feel confused or sick. It will be a few days until you're fully recovered.\" Eventually, the world cleared up. Galaxy was able to see colors beyond just bright lights and shadows, in front of her was a light blue human-ish shape. But it was still hard to make anything out. Was she talking to a hologram? Her arms felt a little lighter now and she blindly felt out the pod for her glasses, only to find none. \"You will be in Group Seven, with the other health practitioners. It will be a class teaching you about life on a colony.\" \"My glasses.\" Galaxy said, cutting off the hologram. \"Where are my glasses?\" \"Your belongings will be in your cabin, Galaxy. No need to worry. I will help you with locating your cabin and things as you seem to be visually impared. Homestead made sure that The Avalon cares for it's passengers.\" \"Thank you...\" She said with a yawn as the pod began to move out of the room, making her feel dizzy. Jim watched as the pod left. He fell flat on his ass. The fact he woke someone up was sinking in now. It was an accident. He didn't mean to do this. Now that woman was trapped on the ship like he was. Well you were going to wake someone else up anyway. Jim froze. He was going to do that, wasn't he? It was sinking in. If he felt this awful doing it by accident, how would he have felt if he had opened someone's pod on purpose? He couldn't believe that he was willing to doom someone to this life. Yeah, he was lonely but that was no excuse! He needed to face the music. He was going to tell the woman he woke up what happened as soon as he could. Hopefully, she would understand. xxx The hologram sure was right about feeling sick after hibernation. Galaxy nearly fell over as the hologram in her bracelet guided her through the all white halls. As if the ship sensed how hard it was for her to see, a bright blurry glowing blue line appeared on the ground. It reminded the woman of the lines on hospital floors that told people where to go. Soon, Galaxy was in her room. Even without her glasses, she could tell it was kind of crappy. It was about as big as the bathroom in her house on earth. She shrugged. She would only be here for four months anyway. \"Your class begins in an hour. Please get ready. Scan your bracelet on this panel right here to register your luggage and it will be delivered automatically.\" A panel on the wall glowed. Galaxy held her hand over it and it dinged. Within minutes, her bags appeared in a shoot on the wall. She opened up a pocket on her pink and black backpack and found her hot pink glasses case and opened it. She put on her glasses which were square and had little bedazzled jewels on the frames and stars on the arms. Everything was clear now. It was a relief to be able to see now! She wondered if she had time for a quick shower. She felt kind of gross, and she also looked weirdly grey blue when she looked in the mirror. Galaxy thought about it for a minute before just deciding to shower. First impressions were important. She didn't want her fellow calleges to think she was gross. No one would want to get treatment from a doctor that looked sick or like they couldn't take care of themselves. Fifteen minutes later, Galaxy stepped out of the tiny bathroom, her short black hair still a little wet, and looked through her suitcase for something to wear. She settled on a pair of simple comfortable pair of underwear and sports bra, because who would even see under her clothes? No one. Then she put on a pair of simple blue skinny jeans and a baggy grey turtleneck sweater she got for Christmas from her mother before she died. To top it off, Galaxy put on a pair of black combat boots. This was a lot more plain than what she normally wore, but she wanted to look professional without looking too stuffy. She knew she had a pants suit in the bag somewhere but that's just too much. She looked in the mirror. Her light brown skin looked like it got its color back after her shower. Her full lips spread into a pretty smile at the sight. Looks like it was a good idea she showered! She wondered if she should put on some makeup or just go natural. She shrugged, going into her makeup bag and putting on her coverup and foundation. After that, she put on some light black eyeliner and dark red lipstick. This would have to do. She still had to do her hair after all. xxx Jim walked in circles in the grand concord. He felt nervous. What if that girl thought he was lying and woke her up on purpose? Still, it was the right thing to tell her what happened. The elevator doors swung open and there she was. Galaxy Pepper. That woman he woke up. Jim looked at her and gasped. She was pretty. She was different from Aurora, who was pale and blonde haired. Galaxy's hair was short and dark and reached her chin and curled up just a little bit. Her skin was brown like toffee or maybe like honey, it looked healthy. It was a golden brown and reminded him of the sun, like how Aurora's resembled the moonlight. Especially since she was looking weird and sick thanks to the pod malfunction. Her eyes were also a chocolately brown. Jim only saw Aurora's eyes in her profile video, and they were a sparkling ice blue. \"Hi!\" Galaxy said before running over to Jim with a dazzling smile. \"Are you a crew member or...\" \"No, passenger.\" Galaxy nodded. \"Same. Anyway, have you... Seen anyone? I went to my class and there wasn't anyone. At all. Not even in the hallways. The hologram acted like it was full and.\" Jim raised his hand. \"I'll tell you everything over lunch, how about that?\" He figured it'd be easier to tell the news if she had something to eat and was sitting down. Galaxy blinked. \"Uh, ok. Sure.\" They walked to the cafeteria in silence. Jim was too nervous to say anything and Galaxy was just... Quiet. When they got to the cafeteria, Galaxy noticed that this room was completely empty too. She blinked. The cafeteria in school when she was growing up always at least had a few people in it. The hospital cafeteria was like that too. Why wasn't there anyone here?! She looked over at the man, wanting answers now. But he just kept walking and went to the large machine. He hit a button and was given a really basic looking lunch. A sandwich, apple and what she guessed was yogurt. Galaxy frowned. This was a luxury ship wasn't it? Why was the food crummy looking? \"Are you going to eat?\" \"Huh? Oh. Yeah.\" \"Let me show you how the machine works.\" Jim said as he put his tray on a table. Galaxy sighed before cutting him off. \"I'm not a little kid. I can do it myself.\" She said before hitting a button that looked good. Maybe Jim just couldn't handle anything tastier than white bread and plain yogurt. \"Sorry! That's for our golden class passengers.\" The machine said. Galaxy glared hard at the machine and hit another button. She heard Jim laugh behind her, making her more mad as the machine kept telling her everything GOOD was for the golden class. When she finally got an option she could have, it was a sandwich, yogurt and an apple. Yikes! The woman sighed and took her tray and sat across from Jim, who was picking at his sandwich. \"You'd think they'd have more options for people that paid nearly a million dollars to get onto this stupid ship.\" Grumbled Galaxy before she took a bite out of the sandwich. She gagged when she realized it was tuna. It took everything within her to not puke all over the table and swallow it. \"You paid full price?\" Jim asked. \"Yeah. My savings are gone now to say the least. I have some insurance money left over so I won't be completely broke when we get to the colony.\" She said staring at her yogurt. Maybe if she put yogurt in the sandwich, it'd cover up the tuna. Jim blinked. \"Why didn't you go for a discount ticket?\" \"Homestead might take more money from me that way, since they take a percentage of your paycheck on Homestead 2 right? It rubbed me the wrong way. They have enough money as it is...\" She said before deciding to just dump the yogurt onto the sandwich. Jim stared at her weirdly. What was she doing? \"What are you doing?\" \"I hate tuna so maybe this would cover it up...\" He smiled. \"What are you, 9 years old? You're so picky.\" The ravenette rolled her eyes. \"29, thank you. I can't help that tuna makes me sick. It's all my family ate growing up.\" She took a bite. Ick. It was still gross, it was easier to chew and swallow though. But the bread was getting soggy. \"Is it like this everyday?\" \"Sometimes they have soup for lunch. They have different meals depending on the time of day.\" \"So I'm guessing that it's like McDonalds where you can't get breakfast after 11...\" Galaxy said with a smile. Jim laughed. \"Exactly.\" The woman noticed how nice the man's smile was and blushed a little. He was pretty cute. But then she realized... She didn't know his name! \"Oh my god. I'm so sorry I didn't ask sooner but what's your name? I'm Dr. Galaxy Pepper.\" Jim blinked. He knew her name already but then he realized something about her. \"Dr... Pepper? Dr. Pepper.\" Galaxy laughed. \"Yes. That's my name... Laugh. It. Up. But at least tell who you are!\" Jim was still giggling at her name as she talked. He forgot how good it felt to talk to someone real. Arthur knew jokes but they were kind of stale and he never laughed at Jim's stories or jokes or little things like this. He looked over at Galaxy, who was staring at him patiently to tell her his name. \"James Preston. Jim. Call me Jim.\" \"Ah... Normal name...\" Jim blinked. \"What do you mean?\" \"There's nothing wrong with your name so don't get mad. It's just funny when there's people with names like James, Tyler, Jennifer, Chris or Kevin... Because it makes stuff like mine sound even dumber than usual.\" \"Galaxy isn't dumb...\" Jim defended. \"It's... Unique.\" \"Uniquely dumb, maybe. It's okay, Jim. I learned to laugh at my name when I was in preschool. And had to get used to people making Dr. Pepper jokes when I became a doctor.\" The man smiled and she smiled back. Galaxy wondered if maybe he thought she was a little cute as well. Then she shook her head. She just met him... \"Anyway. You know I'm a doctor. So, what do you do, Jim?\" He blinked. \"Well, I'm an engineer.\" \"Niiiice.\" Galaxy said, though Jim wasn't sure if he was being made fun of. \"Have you done anything big? Like design bridges or something?\" \"Nah, they usually found someone more renowned than me.\" He shrugged, smiling lightly. \"To be honest? I'm just a glorified mechanic at this point, and even that didn't get me a whole lot of work back on earth. Gave me time to read up on robotics and other things in the field... I won't bore you with details. It's fine.\" Galaxy shook her head. \"Even if you're not some big name fancy engineer... Not that I would know about that sort of thing, different fields and all, I still think it's pretty neat.\" \"Well being a doctor must be neat.\" It was Galaxy's time to shrug. \"A lot of it is mechanical now. We're only called in for surgeries where it might be too difficult for a machine. But we get some authority over it, I guess. Also we're more patient oriented, I guess.\" She smiled. \"That's the part of my job I like. Helping people and making a connection... I hope my patients on earth found a suitable doctor that meets their needs. It's the most I can do besides giving them recommendations for other doctors. I can't exactly go back, it's been over a hundred years. I can help more people on Homestead 2, and maybe a little more personally since I'm not sure if they have all the equipment as earth does.\" Jim froze. Shit. He needed to tell her now... \"Dr. Pepper...\" \"Oh, call me Galaxy! Or Gal... or Gala. Whatever does you best.\" He swallowed. \"Galaxy...\" \"Yes?\" \"I totally understand if this upsets you. I get it if you never want to speak to me again after this but...\" Galaxy narrowed her eyes. \"What are you talking about...\" Jim took a breath. \"A year ago the ship malfunctioned or something and I woke up.\" \"That's... That's impossible. Surely they must've had plans for if this happened.\" Jim shook his head. \"No. They didn't.\" Galaxy froze. Her heart stopped. \"W-wait... So... you were by yourself for a year.\" He nodded. \"You woke up before everyone then... And.\" Then it clicked. \"W-wait. There's no one here. There's no one but is here. I haven't seen or heard anyone but you. W-what...\" Jim reached out gently and took her hands. \"T-the ship had another malfunction today. Your pod was malfunctioning, you were going to die in the pod and...\" \"So you woke me up.\" She said, pulling her hands away. \"Not on purpose. I was trying to fix your pod, restart it since the malfunction seemed to shut off everything but turned it back on. Yours was the only one to break.\" \"Jim...\" \"It was freezing you. There was frost showing up immediately. You were awake or something, you were moving around inside and I couldn't just...\" Galaxy opened then closed her mouth. \"Was... That why I looked so... Off before I cleaned myself up?\" Jim bit his lip. So she noticed how sick she was. \"Y-yeah. I swear, I didn't. I didn't mean to wake you up. It was an accident...\" \"...Jim. How... How long until we reach Homestead 2?\" He looked away then got up from his seat. \"I can show you...\" xxxx Jim watched as Galaxy collapsed onto the observatory floor like a sack of potatoes. His heart ached to see another human go through what he had. But at least it would be easy for her with him here. He wondered if he should hold her or if she didn't want to be touched. When he was in her situation, he longed for the touch of another person. He let out a small sigh and put his hand on the younger woman's shoulder. \"I'm sorry, Galaxy.\" \"89 years...\" Galaxy said, her voice shaky as if she was about to cry. Years welled up in her chocolate eyes. \"89...\" Jim dropped down onto the floor and wrapped his arms around her and held her close as she began to sob. xxxxxxxx[Chapter 5] authors note: AHHHHH I THOUGHT I POSTED THIS WHEN I UPDATED ON ALL MY OTHER SITES IM OSRRY! so you guys get two updates ^^ thank you for your nice review (thoguh im not sure if one of them was nice?). ill explain some stuff in my other chapter but please enjoy! Galaxy laid in her bed, staring at the smooth greyish plastic ceiling above her bed. Her eyes were stinging from crying earlier and now they were hurting because she rarely blinked as she laid there. She wasn't sure what to do to process this. There were five stages of grief. She wasn't even sure what stage she was on. \"This can't be happening.\" Was a thought she had, but feeling Jim's strong arms around her and smelling his cologne and realizing that she could even taste it he was so close kind of cemented that this was real. It wasn't a messed up dream she was having while in her pod. Did people dream in cryogenic sleep? Dreams only show up in the last hours before you wake up anyway. It wouldn't make sense. She was past denial anyway. This was real and it was happening. The woman felt too empty to feel anger. Who would she even be mad at? Herself for buying the stupid ticket on this stupid ship and leaving her life and patients behind? Homestead for getting into the colonizing business and selling these stupid tickets? Homestead for not creating better quality pods that could stand up to ANYTHING? She rolled onto her side and faced the wall her bed was against. Then a hologram popped up on the wall. It was Jim, looking nervous. \"Hey. Just checking up on you. Was wondering if you wanted to come with me to the cafeteria. Only if you're feeling up to it.\" He said, looking away from the camera on the door. He gave a soft smile. \"If you ever need to talk, I'm here. I know it's a crazy situation and I'm sorry that someone else has to live with it. But I'll do my best to help you, only if you need it. I'll be waiting in the cafeteria, it's cool if you don't come though.\" Galaxy smiled before tapping on the hologram, which opened up the door to the room. She say up and wiped her eyes and saw Jim standing outside, looking surprised. \"Hey.\" She said, sniffling a little but she still smiled. \"Hey... How're you doing?\" Galaxy shrugged before telling him to come inside. \"I'm just... Not sure how to feel.\" Jim walked into the room and leaned against the wall across from the bed. \"I get that. I wasn't sure how I felt at first when I realized what happened.\" \"I'm just... You were alone for a year, you said?\" Galaxy asked before scooching over to the side a bit and patting the mattress beside her. He nodded before hesitantly moving over to the bed and sitting beside her. \"A little over a year, yeah.\" \"How did you do it...? I mean, I'm sure even extreme introverts wouldn't fare too well if it was a year. This place is so big and empty. It just... Reminds you of how alone you are. Sorry if I'm rubbing it in.\" The man shrugged. \"Wish I could tell you. I didn't do very well in the beginning when I realized what was happening...\" \"Did it get better?\" \"For a little while...\" Galaxy leaned in closer. \"How so?\" Jim blushed when he saw how close she was now. It felt more intense than when he hugged her yesterday. \"I-I... Well... My friend Arthur. Wait. You haven't met him, do you want to see him?\" Galaxy's warm eyes lit up like a Christmas tree. His friend? Another person? \"Is there someone else?\" Jim blinked. \"Oh no, I'm so sorry. I... He's a robot. He was the only other thing that could really... Talk to me here. I don't know how I would've managed if I didn't have him, probably way worse than I did.\" Galaxy nodded. She wondered if Jim had built Arthur, he did mention reading up on robotics. It wouldn't be unusual or weird for someone to create another 'person' if they were lonely. Or maybe Arthur was just a part of the ship. Either way, it would be a good idea to get out of the doom and gloom room for a bit. \"Sure. Show me.\" Jim smiled. \"Great, he's in the bar.\" xxxxxx Arthur was indeed part of the ship. Even if Galaxy was impressed by Jim's engineering background, she kind of doubted that he could create something this sophisticated. At least, not without a degree specially for robotics. And programming. And special effects for movies. Arthur looked just like a person. His skin looked like actual skin. His movements didn't sound mechanical, well except when he moved his entire body. It was startling when Galaxy saw that Arthur had such a realistic body from the waist up only to have a tripod with wheels for a lower half. She couldn't help but wonder if Homestead blew their budget on the robot's top part. They even went through the trouble of making sure Arthur didn't look creepy like the usual realistic androids at kids restaurants that sang songs. Or the singing virtual idols that they didn't look like an anime character. \"Who is this lovely woman, Jim?\" Galaxy blinked when he spoke. He even sounded like a person! No strange echo or weird tones. Homestead really put their all into this bartending bot! \"Galaxy? Galaxy... Are you there?\" The woman blinked. \"Oh! S-sorry. Yeah, I'm Dr. Galaxy Pepper.\" She even added a little bow. \"It's nice to meet you.\" Arthur let out a small laugh. \"It's a pleasure, Dr. Pepper. What is your preferred drink?\" Galaxy shrugged before going to sit down at the bar next to Jim. \"I'm. I'm not sure, I never drank that much beyond coolers or beer at get togethers.\" She laughed softly before putting her hands on the bar and leant in. \"Surprise me!\" Jim blinked. She was 29 and didn't have a favorite yet? Arthur chuckled and nodded. \"Should I 'surprise you' every time you come in?\" He asked as he poured Jim's whiskey and passed him his glass. Galaxy laughed once again. \"Sure! Until we find the perfect poison, I guess!\" Jim smiled softly to himself as he took a sip of his drink and felt the burn rush down his throat. He watched Galaxy smile and laugh, noticing how her eyes would sparkle and how they looked more topaz in the light of the bar. She looked so much better now than she did when he checked up on her. Even if it was hard when it was just him and Arthur, Jim knew he had to try to help Galaxy adjust. No one deserved to go through what he did. Galaxy's eyes lit up when a tall glass filled with bright orange, yellow and red liquid. It reminded her of a sunrise. \"A Malibu cocktail, it's a rum flavoured with liquer mixed with cranberry juice and pineapple juice. It might be a tad strong at first.\" \"This looks amazing! I'll try to keep that in mind though. I have to use the little girl's room, can you point me in the right direction?\" She asked, getting up from her seat. Jim pointed slightly behind and beside him. \"Hallway in the corner of the room by the bar. Can't miss it.\" She smiled. \"Thanks. I'll be quick.\" As she left, Arthur stole a glance at the man in front of her. \"I noticed that that's not the woman you've been talking about for the past few weeks. Did you decide.\" Jim shook his head. \"No, no. There... There was a malfunction and it affected her pod, it was going to freeze her to death and I hoped I could manually restart it and it'd go back to normal. Since I saw the other pods go back to normal after the power went out. But I accidentally woke her up...\" \"And she's aware of this?\" \"Yeah, I told her as soon as I ran into her after she woke up. She kind of took it hard, so let's try to support her the best we could.\" \"Understood.\" \"One more thing, Arthur...\" The android looked up from wiping his glass. \"Yes?\" Jim cleared his throat, noticing that Galaxy was coming back into the room, he lowered his voice. \"Try not to mention Aurora, ok? I don't want her to think I woke her up on purpose because I was talking about waking up someone else.\" Arthur nodded. \"Understood.\"[Chapter 6] authors note: so sorry for being gone ! ive been grounded and i still am... ive never been to denver so i dont know alot ^^;. i tried to look up stuff for it but i dont think its the same as being there you know? anyway i hope you like this ^^ thank you so much for all the nice reviews! mhairi thank you so much! i hope gal is as nice as you think ^^; rongis i dont think shes a mary sue yet but even if she is whatever :P sad sabrin ahh thank you1! i hope ill update soon after this but i dunno howlong ill be grounded for love fiction 2016 thank you :D i hope youll still like it ^^ Jim learned that Galaxy both didn't want to be alone but didn't want to talk. A lot of their time lately was her sitting in the same room as him, reading something, tapping away at a tablet or doodling. Sometimes she'd sit and watch him tinker with the robots that weirdly started to malfunction. He didn't mind it so much. It felt a little embarrassing to be watched though, since he was scared he might mess up and look like an idiot. But it felt comforting knowing that he didn't have to talk all the time. He was never really sure what to talk about when other people would ask about him. Though, he did feel curious about what the glasses wearing woman was thinking about. Or writing about. Or drawing. Or just about her in general. They knew each other for a few weeks and spent ALOT of time together. But they didn't know each other. He knew he could watch her profile, but it felt weird since she was RIGHT THERE most of the time. With Aurora, she probably wouldn't have minded since she was a journalist and journalists usually research everything they can on people they interview. \"Galaxy.\" He said before stopping his tinkering. \"Yeah?\" \"Where are you from?\" He asked and turned towards her. He watched her blink and put down the tablet she was playing with. \"Canada.\" \"That's a big place. Can I ask where in Canada?\" She laughed. \"You probably haven't heard of it, but Saskatoon. It's the biggest city in Saskatchewan...\" \"Are those real names or are you just making shit up?\" He laughed. The woman rolled her eyes. \"I can assure you, they're real. I moved there when I was in seventh grade, my family would visit there a lot so moving there wasn't too big of a change.\" \"Where were you born?\" Jim asked, getting up from his spot and sitting on the couch closer to her. \"If you don't mind me asking. Was it still in... Sa... Sasatoowan?\" \"Saskatchewan.\" \"Sacatyouchan.\" Galaxy snorted. \"Sa.\" \"Sa.\" \"Ssscatch.\" \"Catch.\" \"You.\" \"You.\" \"Wan.\" \"One.\" \"Saskatchewan.\" \"Sasquatch.\" She rolled her eyes. \"Asshole. One more time. Saskatchewan.\" \"Sassscatchyewone.\" \"Close enough.\" The woman giggled. \"To answer your question, no. I was born in a reservation in Manitoba. Are we gonna have to go over that too?\" Jim snorted and shook his head. \"No, Manitoba is easy. So, reservation...\" He felt curious now, would it be rude to ask? \"Does that mean you're an Indian?\" She frowned before opening her mouth to speak. Jim cut her off, realizing his mistake. \"Native. Native American. Sorry.\" She gave him a smile. \"It's okay. America uses that word more often but try not to make a habit of it, okay? That's not what we are and I'm not sure how that guy mixed up Native people with people actually from India.\" He nodded. \"But yeah, I'm Native. Or First Nations, since I'm Canadian.\" Jim smiled. \"That's interesting. I'm just... English and Irish or something. Scottish? Around there. Anyway... Why would you visit Sas... Saskatoon? That's a different province, right?\" She shrugged. \"My aunt moved there because of a job transfer and she was close to my mom. So we'd go there a few times a year and it was just... A lot of fun. It was the best during the summer because there were festivals and fairs going on. It usually meant I got to go to three fairs that year.\" \"Three?!\" He wasn't sure why he was surprised by this, since his town had tons of festivals growing up. Maybe it was because he never really went to them? \"For some reason, there would be a tiny little fair that'd stop in the reserve for a weekend before heading for the city an hour away. My older sister would work there for the weekend and get some cash for the fair in the city, which was a lot bigger since they had more room. You can't really fit more than a Ferris wheel, haunted house and a few spinning rides in the arena parking lot there. So then next week, we'd go into the city for the fair that weekend.\" She stopped then shook her head. \"I'm talking too much. How about you? Where are you from?\" Jim blinked. Did he not mention that before? Oh well. \"Well... I'm from Denver, Colorado.\" \"The Mile High City...\" He smiled, rubbing his neck and looking away for a bit. \"Yeah. It's in the Rocky Mountains and it's the capital city... There's a lot of art and museums there. Huge music scene, at least back in the day.\" \"Yeah? I never really heard much about Denver, sadly. I had no idea there was a big art scene. You only really hear about the mountains... Sorry! I'm. Talking over you.\" \"It's okay. I don't really know what to talk about... I didn't really do the art thing after I graduated school, so there might've been more stuff going on. I liked camping and hiking with my dad in the mountains though. He was always more outdoorsy than me but I liked that he included me in these kinds of things. I think it's because my grandfather never took him out that much and that's when a lot of the natural stuff was being torn up for more businesses or living areas. It's probably just me overthinking but, I think my dad wanted me to see what little was left of the earth, I guess. Even if there's less of it than when he was growing up.\" Jim realized how much he was talking and stopped before looking over at Galaxy, who stared at him with big eyes. \"Ah, I don't really know where that came from. I don't like talking about myself that much.\" \"Oh no! It's okay! And I'm the same way. I always end up talking too much and I feel bad, like I'm boring people.\" Jim flushed a little. \"Well, you don't bore me when you talk.\" She touched his hand and smiled. \"Same goes for you.\" xxxxxx Galaxy roamed the empty halls, not really sure what to do. She wanted to see Jim, but felt kind of guilty for constantly bothering him. It would be something if he wanted to spend time with her, since he was alone for so long. But she didn't really have an excuse beyond feeling needy and there simply was no one else but Arthur. She always felt a little weird sitting at the bar and not ordering a drink. Part of her said it wouldn't matter, since he's a robot and wouldn't mind and another part of her told her to just order as many Malibus or Long Island Ice Teas as she wanted. There was no one on the ship, they couldn't judge. And it had to be after five somewhere. At least if she did that, she was bound to have a fave drink eventually. She always felt a little lame when she'd sit with Jim and not know what to get. Despite not wanting to bother him, Galaxy found herself in front of his door, her tanned hand floating in front of the doorbell. Her breath was caught inside her throat and her brain was going a mile a minute. Should she ring the doorbell? Or should she go? Should she stay or should she go now? Before she could even decide, the door slid open. \"Oh, Galaxy!\" Jim said, surprise obvious in his voice. \"What's up?\" The doctor choked on her words, words she wasn't even really sure what they were. \"Oh, um. Nothing, I was just...\" Jim smiled. \"Come take a walk with me.\" She nodded. \"Okay.\" They walked in silence together. Galaxy felt like she should be talking, normally she would be okay and comfortable with silence. But for some reason, she felt nervous. In a good way. She shook her head before stealing a glance at Jim, who looked calm, collected and even had a tiny smile. What is he thinking? The doctor thought before stumbling into the ground. \"Oh jeez, are you okay?\" Asked Jim, who gave held out his hand for her to take. Galaxy blushed and gave him a nod before taking his hand and marvelled at how big it was. It was rough, which made sense considering how he probably worked with them often. She felt self concious about her own hands though, they were dry and rough because she was constantly washing them in the hospital. She never really took care of that sort of thing, not even when she was dating someone. But why did she care now? \"Yeah, I'm fine.\" \"Is your ankle okay? You're kind of wearing high heels.\" She laughed once she was on her feet and looked down. There was a pair of black high heeled boots that came halfway under her knee with big chunky heels and a pair of minty green tight skinny jeans tucked in them. She wore a big baggy magenta sweater with a turtle neck under a leather jacket with buttons with old ancient bands from the 1990s on the collar. \"I've taken worse tumbles in these shoes, I'll be okay. Thank you.\" \"I'm just worried you won't be able to do the thing I was gonna show you now...\" Jim said with a light laugh. \"And what's that?\" He grinned before taking her hand once again and pulling her into the direction of god knows where. xxxxx \"Are you serious?\" \"I mean. Yeah. There's lots of things to do on the ship... I did most of them already but. It'd be fun with someone else... Or it'd be funny to see you try to beat my high score.\" Galaxy smiled sweetly before bending down and pulling the zippers of her boots up as high as they can go. Just to make sure. She shot him a wicked grin as she walked up to the platform and threw off her leather jacket. \"Well I'm about to erase every score on this board, Jim.\" The hundreds of scores and the initials JCP disappeared from the walls surrounding the room once a hologram appeared in front of Galaxy. It wasn't realistic like the ones that taught the colony classes or greeted people when they woke up from the pods, it looked like a video game character. \"Ready?!\" The game said. \"Yes!\" \"Okay! Follow me!\" Music started to play. It was an older song, one that Jim remembered hearing his mom play while she cleaned. Sometimes his dad would come home early and see her dancing while she cleaned and joined in. Back then, it kind of embarrassed him. He never really liked the song because of that, but now it didn't seem so bad. I really wanna stop But I just got the taste for it I feel like I could fly with the boy on the moon So honey hold my hand, you like making me wait for it I feel like I could die walking up to the room, oh yeah Galaxy laughed as she swayed and spun out of sync with the character she was facing. Her dark hair was short but long enough to whip her in the face when she danced, she would laugh even more or scrunch up her face whenever it'd do this. Despite how high her shoes were and how she fell by simply walking earlier, she was doing great and wasn't stumbling or shaking as she spun gracefully. Jim swallowed. Late night, watching television But how'd we get in this position? It's way too soon, I know this isn't love But I need to tell you something She would bounce a little on her knees in time with the drums and cymbals in the background, even if the game wasn't doing that. It kept yelling at her to copy the other dancer exactly, but she didn't care. She was getting into it. The song was picking up and so was she. Jim shuffled from side to side, his pulse quickening as he focused on the lyrics and tried not to be enchanted by Galaxy's dance. I really really really really really really like you And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too? I really really really really really really like you And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too? Jim felt like he made a mistake by actually listening to the song. He felt embarrassed, kind of like he did back when his dad would dip his mom down after spinning her around to this song. But it was for an entirely different reason. He was sort of relating to the music. Galaxy was looking at him as she'd dance. Her eyes were glittering like the stars that made up her namesake. He smiled in response, hoping that he wasn't blushing like crazy despite his face burning up like a house fire. Oh, did I say too much? I'm so in my head When we're out of touch I really really really really really really like you And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too? She wriggled her hips and swung her arms as she shot him these looks. Was she trying to say something? Or was it just him hoping? He slid off his jacket, feeling too warm right now. His heart was beating so fast and butterflies fluttered in his stomach. He felt so bubbly and nervous, but in a good way. The song slowed down a bit, but he didn't feel any slower. It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation All I wanna do is get into your head Yeah we could stay alone, you and me, in this temptation Sipping on your lips, hanging on by thread, baby Jim stepped onto the platform and the game registered him. A second character showed up beside the one Galaxy was against. \"Second player recognized! Team battle!\" Galaxy's eyes shot open and a wide grin appeared on her face. She laughed as she grabbed Jim's hands and spun him around. Late night, watching television But how'd we get in this position? It's way too soon, I know this isn't love But I need to tell you something Even though Jim had played this game and was pretty much the master for a year, he was doing kind of badly right now. He could blame it on how despite playing it so often, the computer never played this song. He could blame it on the fact that it was his first time playing with a partner. And how it have him the girl part. He could blame his poor performance on how pretty Galaxy looked with her dazzling eyes, silky hair that kept hitting her in the face, her enchanting smile and laughter that sounded like fairies singing by a babbling brook. Wait, what? Galaxy's hands were on his waist and his slid up to her shoulders as they moved back and forth before the music exploded and picked up. I really really really really really really like you And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too? I really really really really really really like you And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too? It was getting harder and harder to ignore the lyrics now. Jim was feeling the music and what the singer was saying now. He wondered if Galaxy was feeling the same way. He wondered if she felt the sparks he did when the game had them touch hands and her wrap her thin arms around him. He was sure that if someone from his old job on earth saw him right now, he would probably get laughed at. But he didn't care. It was just a game. He told himself. Oh, did I say too much? I'm so in my head When we're out of touch (When we're out of touch) I really really really really really really like you And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too? Jim was kind of glad that this wasn't a slow dance song, per say. If he was feeling this embarrassed over a peppy pop song, how could he handle a slow sensuous one? He could barely stand doing that when it was just him, he felt really silly. But with Galaxy here, he'd have to worry about doing this with her... The music suddenly slowed down and the game characters slid their arms around each other and got real close. Then they had to do it. Galaxy felt so warm and soft against him. The game characters held hands and lifted them up and spun slowly. They did the same, Jim bit his lip to keep himself from gasping at the spark of electricity again when they held hands. The game character slid his hands down the girl'a sides and onto her waist and lowered her down, which Galaxy tried to do but Jim was taller and a lot heavier. Who gave you eyes like that? Said you could keep them? I don't know how to act Or if I should be leaving I'm running out of time Going out of my mind I need to tell you something Yeah, I need to tell you something \"Jim, ow.\" Galaxy simply said when he grabbed onto her a little too tight when she went to dip him. \"Sorry.\" He said, voice shaking like his legs were to keep himself upward since he knew he was probably a little too heavy for the doctor to hold him up. \"It's okay.\" She smiled at him, her eyes glittering once again. He wanted to stay in his uncomfortable position forever, but then the music exploded once again. (YEAAAAAAH!) I really really really really really really like you And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?I really really really really really really like you (Oh, oh, ohh!)And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too? (Do you want me, too?) Jim was now glad that she was wearing such high shoes because there was no way for him to accidentally step on her toes as he awkwardly danced along to the song that was picking up more and more. Part of him wanted it to be over, so then they could do something else and pretend nothing was happening. But the other part of him never wanted it to end, embarrassing memories and him being a 'girl' here be damned. Oh, did I say too much? (Did I say too much?)I'm so in my head (I'm so in my head)When we're out of touch (When we're out of touch!) I really really really really really really like you And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too? The song ended there, and they were once again in a dip. Galaxy was panting and her skin was a bit red, but Jim convinced himself that it was from the dance and not him. He smiled at her sheepishly, which she returned genuinely. Then her arms gave out and he crashed onto the floor and she fell after him and on top of him. Their faces were right up close. Jim felt her heavy breath against his blushing and damp skin and her heart beat. Galaxy let out a laugh then looked away and rested her head against his chest. \"Sorry I dropped you. You're really heavy.\" \"It's ok.\" \"Let me rest here a bit.\" \"Ok.\" The game announced that they had won and they had beaten the top programmed score, only to make fun of how sloppy Jim's movements were and that Galaxy technically won. He ignored it, but the woman on top of him was laughing and bragging. But he didn't mind at all. xxxxxx authors note: i know this was cheesy but XD I love scenes like this! I tried to be like that part with Dante and Becky from Clerks 2 but i don't know if I captured it \". I really like Carly Rae Jepsen even if she doesn't sound 90s XD if you don't like it then too bad!i dont own that song! ","Summary":" Homestead's Avalon glided through the depth of space. It had been flying for thirty years without a"},{"Movie":"Passengers, 2016","Title":"The Hidden Clause","Author":"Risa Zugva","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12411587","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Captain's Log Upon waking we found a woman frozen in stasis in our hospital. Three of our passengers are missing and there is no evidence of what happened except an enormous tree in the middle of our square and an extensive mess accompanied with different kinds of damage to the ship. There are no records of what happened except a string of repairs that were made to the ship. The Central computer is denying anything out of ordinary happened. I'm considering about waking up the woman in the hospital, maybe she could shed some light on the whole story but I'm not sure would Homestead Corporation approve my initiative in this case or would I be punished for my boldness. Two months are a long way to go, people are getting restless and curious creating romanticized versions of events. Maybe I'll be compelled to wake up the unidentified woman, who has no tag on her, just to keep people from forcing themselves in on her. There is a fascination with a woman closed up in a glass-like coffin. I'm not sure why, but they are getting impatient with my reinforcing regulations, which would compel me to let the interrogation to authorities because I have a stowaway in my hands and I have no idea how that happened. Maybe I should wake her up just to prepare for my own questioning. When the answer to my messages gets to us, we'll be already descending on Homestead II. My decisions will be my own, but I'm entering this note into my log hoping it'll relieve some of my responsibility. The voyage is long and curiosity of my passengers is a fact that doesn't change the face of the new world. On contrary, it grew bigger. The question is remarkable important, do we have a hero or a criminal on our hand. The outcome could change the way we conduct interstellar travel.[Chapter 2] A/N: so it seems Aurora is an engineer at this trip and things start to change on us. Not sure where she's leading us. No beta: feel free to apply :) Aurora woke up in the darkness. She had troubles opening her eyes as the simulation welcomed her on Homestead II. As she moved she discovered no one else is moving around her. That was out of place, they all should wander around awoken at the same time, to feel less isolated. She knew that because she prepared herself for the journey watching every documentation possible. Aurora was an engineer, after all, she wanted to know how everything works, and she wanted to be sure nothing will go wrong. Especially with socialization, there she wanted to be sure about every step she makes. Now she hesitated in stepping out of her hibernation pod waiting for others to move, for other lights to lit, but nothing happened. Everyone stood still sleeping away. \"Put me back to sleep, cryo,\" she said to the computer but it just replied with repeated instructions to proceed to her cabin. \"You can't be so stupid\" she lost her temper. \"And so unresponsive, put me back to sleep, refreeze me, and wake me when others are awake. Put me back to hibernation!\" \"Hibernation takes place in special labs, pods are only for sustaining cryo-stasis\" computer started to run vids about hibernation like she doesn't already know everything about it. \"Why would Homestead Company downgrade its pods? It costs money to downgrade things!\" she refused to move. \"Homestead Company does only what it's best for its passengers. It's safest to put your trust in us because this way you can't harm yourselves with the lack of knowledge. Hibernation pods never malfunction, they are safe and reliable, and there is no use of passengers managing hibernation process themselves, and we're not so irresponsible to leave such great responsibility to computing machines.\" \"But you can put all the rest of the trip to their hands,\" she said desperately and finally got out of her pod. \"When the others will wake up?\" She turned around at the lack of any response. Her pod's interface has turned off. No one was moving, but the path was lit before her so she followed it to her cabin. Comforting thing was that all her stuff were there. There were not many things but she preferred it that way. The interface in her cabin informed her about the introductory class she was to attend to and she hoped others will wake up to be there too, but the time was all wrong. If her clock hasn't stopped, there were no way they are at Homestead already. She put her leather jacket on and looked at her face in the mirror. Her hair has grown too long. Even if everything stands still hair grows even if you're frozen. If she was home she would cut it but now she just tied it up on her head to keep it out of her way. The computer in her room was just as uninformative as the one in her pod, if not less. She hated that, there were no plugs, now wires, nothing to open and override its repetitive nature. At home, she had all her technology hacked to be manageable and responsive, but outside everything became less and less accessible. To protect them against theft and terrorism all technology became just an interface with specific service, but without any way of interacting with it. The classroom was chillingly empty, interface infuriatingly automated. Aurora felt panic creeping in. She knew the flight was automated, she knew no one was left awake to suffer years alone, but no one ever mentioned the possibility to awaken alone. Slowly she walked the halls trying not to give in to panic. She knew the ship's layout by the heart. Passing by the bridge confirmed her fear that they weren't at their destination yet. There was no way of entering the bridge, which was the first level of protection of their route. If any terrorist would be crazy enough to wake up while everyone is sleeping he can't divert the ship from its course. Aurora realized that she just answered her own question, they probably degraded hibernation pods to discourage any terrorist attacks on the ship during its trip. It was chilling to think that if she manages to reach Homestead that she might me charged for terrorism just for being awake. Maybe she wasn't the only one awake. Maybe she was awakened by someone to be blamed for the damage they already made to the ship. Her breath got hectic. She would be a perfect scapegoat. A poor engineer who offered her services to the new colony in an exchange for the trip. No one would believe anything else. After that, she moved slowly looking around. Navigational room told her that she was right, her clock was right, there were eighty years more to fly on. She saw no way of returning to stasis, and the computer gave her no answer to her questions. If the damage is already done, whatever it is, when the ship reaches their destination, or when they finally find its debris, her body will tell them that she's to blame, and all her countrymen will be out on the run once again targeted for something they didn't do. No, she won't give into resignation, if there is any damage on this ship she'll find it and repair it. That was what she was set out here to do anyway, to repair things. She'll go through every inch of this ship and find the damage, no matter how small it is. And then, if she finds no other way, she'll walk out of an air chamber. It was better for her to disappear than to be found dead out of her pod, then any charge could be made, they could pin to her whatever they want. Do leave a comment.[Chapter 3] A/N: so things are unfolding. No beta. Jim woke up feeling little woozy. It was a new sensation and he was satisfied by it. After all, he was a writer who came along on this journey just to experience things anew, to see the future. He was curious to find out what had changed while he slept. It was a lifetime after all, in a lifetime world would change upside down. A wonderful thing about this trip was that he will be able to see the world change twice. First to see how the colony is adapting, what their culture looks like, how are they different from Earthlings. Secondly to see Earth two centuries into the future. To have himself in a freezer for two centuries would be too costly even for his lofty incomes, but this trip was a wonderful opportunity. He didn't even have to pay the full price of his first class ticket. Part of it will be discounted by his honorary for his part in documenting great endeavor that is colonizing new planets. He was proud to be a part of it. The fact that his contract obligated him to portray Homestead Corporation in the favourable light didn't bother him. It was a journalist's job to portray the world through a certain lens that would allow their readers to see what a right thing to do is. And the right thing to do was to expand to new worlds and make human kind great and victorious. Jim wasn't bothered by the fact that he was the only one awake. Maybe computer woke them up in batches, maybe he got an early start to see things first, to be able to witness everyone discovering their new world. He dressed carefully examining his features in his big mirror. His cabin was suitably big and he had a nice window. He wouldn't mind spending some more time in this space. Few months on the ship should be a joy to experience. As he walked the empty halls he was composing sentences in his mind celebrating sleek, reliable design, enjoyable silence, and clean surfaces. He lost his pace when he came across a mess cleaning robots were unable to deal with. Their round small bodies crushed into the barrier unable to cross over the dented metal which revealed ship's insides. That was just plain wrong but surely someone will come in soon to repair it. Jim walked around it and shook off that strange feeling of fear. Why would he fear a simple repair job? But it didn't look like a simple repair. It looked like a huge malfunction. The whole plate was lifted up and wires beneath it were a real mess. The floated in space, in the middle of nothing. They couldn't just step outside on the curb of the road and wait for their vehicle to be fixed, or for the towing service to show up. Things didn't look any better in the introductory classroom either. They looked even more disturbing. To wake up alone was one thing but to be in front of a training interface all alone was just plain wrong. He tried to engage with the simulation but it was just a simple drone. He got up as the class continued like nothing is wrong. He started to look for someone, anyone, but he found no one. It seemed like he's alone. He checked every surface that was open. Found the bridge just to discover it was sealed, closed off. Finally, he found an observatory and discovered an awful truth, which was that their trip isn't near its end, it wasn't even half way through. There was no chance he could live for ninety years and live to see the new planet. Firstly he calmed himself down and tried to find a way to get himself back to sleep. When he discovered he can't then the panic set in. He ran through the halls like a crazy person. It felt like he was going mad, maybe it was all a dream, he surely just has bad dreams in his Popsicle state, but they assured him he won't have any. Earth, he remembered finally, they will surely have an idea, instructions how to fix his pod, how to go back to sleep. With a sense of a relief, he sent his message with an explanation how he woke up. \"I'm trying to fix this,\" he said hoping he'll be able to follow their instructions. He sent out his message and then met another dreadful surprise. Their response will come in fifty-five years. With a sense of disbelief, he continued to explore the ship. It must be a dream. Finally, he saw a face of a bartender. He sat down with a sense of relief just to discover that the face belonged to a robot. At that he couldn't help but snort, the irony of it all became too much for him to handle. \"So what now?\" he toasted to the bartender Arthur. \"To just sit around for years and wait for miraculous instructions about hibernation pods, because I can't begin to understand how to work with them, or to bang my head on the wall until it bleeds. Maybe I could write for fifty years, but I'd be ancient till then, that wasn't the point of this trip. It wasn't the point to be stranded and alone.\" \"Tell that to Aurora, she's been going mad from it for a year now,\" Arthur said with his irritating smile. \"She'll surely be glad to see you awake, she's been in need of company for some time now. I'm glad she'll get you to accompany her, she became quite dreary lately.\" \"Aurora?\" Jim jumped up. \"Who is that? Where is she? Did she wake me? Why would she do that to me? What did I ever do to her? How does she look like?\" Jim got fearful, what if one of his many conquests decided to follow him on this journey and take her revenge on him like this. It would be most cruel to do this to him, but maybe it was just a prank, maybe she knows how to get back to sleep. \"Maybe if you turn around she would tell you the answers,\" Arthur nodded towards him. Jim turned around startled just to be faced with a messy, tired face of a small woman. She was all covered in grease, her clothes were all dirty, and her hair was sticking around her face as a haystack. He never saw a woman so appalling and he never saw her before in his life. \"Why would you wake me?\" he yelled at her. \"I never heard of anything so vile, why would you drag me into your nightmare. If you were lonely you should just jump out of an airshaft. That's what I would do, I would just end it with dignity, I wouldn't let myself get so… animal-like.\" \"Of course\" she shook her head with disdain, her voice was cracked from lack of use. \"Who would you send me but a jerk, an asshole, an excuse for a man? I told you I could do it alone, you didn't have to drag anyone else into it.\" As she spoke tears fell down her face but her words weren't directed at Jim, but at the bartender behind him. She has gone mad, everyone knew service robots were just drones, programmed to serve, without any higher intelligence. \"Come on now,\" Arthur said with his cheerful voice putting two glasses on the counter. \"Jim here is a quite enjoyable company, he's a writer, I'm sure he could entertain you and make you put on your glam for a while. The task will be over soon and you'll both get your re-compensation for your troubles.\" \"You can re-compensate me in Hell!\" she screamed at him and stormed off. Jim looked after she intrigued. Maybe she has gone crazy, but what a story it would be, maybe it would be even worthy of him getting to Homestead old instead of young. It would be better than any journalism, it could be a full pledged novel like the ones his father received prizes for. Maybe, just maybe, his name Jim Preston would overshadow the name of his father James Preston jr., The Great Dread Master. Well isn't that a woozy?[Chapter 4] A/N: to answer the question, the roles are reversed many reasons. Because it's dull to see a male engineer save day, and because Chriss Pratt is to buff to appear helpless and geeky. There is more but read on and we'll see will I make it work. No beta so I apologize in advance. Arthur was a machine and not a self-sufficient machine. Aurora knew that all too well. It was forbidden to make androids self-aware, to give them a possibility to make decisions. The prospects of that were proven to be quite devastating for humans. But that didn't mean that other computers were capable of making decisions in dreading situations. As months passed by to her horror, Aurora became aware just how computers, who can't make their own decisions but are programmed to deliver instructions to the letter, can be terrifying. For some time now she was acutely aware that she won't be allowed to survive her trip. Even if she manages to trick her pod to put her back to cryo-stasis she wasn't sure that it would let her wake up. Walking out of air-chamber seemed like an elegant and beautiful dream, something she could control. Going to sleep not sure will she awake was more terrifying. She was at mercy of Avalon. The ship could just cut her air supply, she wouldn't even flinch in her dream. It could turn gravitation off and then on letting her fall over and over again until she dies. For most of those things she was quite sure that are forbidden, but there were always go-arounds, especially if Avalon has instructions to end her as soon as her job is done. Arthur was aware of that as much as her lunch machine, but he had a human face and she could yell at him without feeling too crazy. It was maddening to deal with Avalon. It seemed to her that giving instructions through Arthur seemed more merciful than to drive around the ship by automatic interfaces which offered no reply or justification. That's why she hacked him and gave the ship a voice. That was the worst mistake she ever made. Now she felt paranoid and delusional because data which came out through android were just mad. Before she made Arthur talk to her interfaces led her throughout the ship and instructed her what to repair. Soon she was sure there was no terrorist attack. No one had woken her up for some mean reason. The ship, Avalon, woke her up to repair it. But the ship didn't know how to explain it to her, how to ask for help. It just turned lights on and off and led her in the right direction turning on automatic displays near places where the damage occurred. As interfaces spoke of this or that side of colonial life, style of clothing for different areas or just need for exercising on the journey to keep themselves in shape, she would knock on the metal, lifted plates with the help of small machines that followed her around, or cut through the wall. Soon it became transparent that the damage isn't caused by human intervention but by an asteroid strike. They must have gone through some sort of an asteroid belt. Who in their right mind would drive straight through an asteroid belt? The universe was huge, it was freakishly big. If anyone sat behind that wheel she would turn and go around it, but no, the ship was automated and computers had no way of deciding even simplest tasks like avoiding really big rocks on its way. But the question that bugged her was why was she awaken? If the computer didn't have any way of deciding and planning, why her? How did it know she'll have all the expertise she needs to fix all those problems, and malfunctions were various? From heating, through to lighting, cooling and life support. If she hadn't been very good at her job they would all just die out here when all those small damages would pile up one against the other. That's why she rewired Arthur knowing that his android brain which was made for seemingly meaningful interaction with his customers. He could keep up an illusion of a conversation. She hoped that his ability to interpret data in a way humans can respond to will allow him to form Avalon's instructions into coherent sentences, from which she'll find out why she was chosen. What she found out was more unsettling that following hints and changing lights. So...[Chapter 5] A/N: After awhile, sorry for the delay, the interstellar messages travel slowly. No Beta. When she disappeared from sight Jim decided to have that drink bartender was offering. After all, she didn't have anywhere to run to and it would be bad to begin an interview with her trying to find a bat to hit him on the head. It was best to leave upset women to calm down before addressing them. Surely she'll find time to fix her appearance when she remembers that she's not alone on the ship anymore. He was here to keep her company. With that, he smiled. This might turn out just ok, especially when he discovers the way for them to get back to sleep. Jim visited all sorts of entertainment areas in next few days. Aurora stayed clear of his path. It was like she knows all his movements because whenever he would try to make a stakeout she wouldn't appear on the spot she was repairing earlier. In fact, the repairing spot would stay crackling and blink as he would stand beside it. After two hours he rushed away from the spot. He returned to it the next day just to find it repaired. \"I guess,\" he said to the passing cleaning droid. \"You'll ice me, I wish, when you're ready I'll be in the cafeteria, I like their breakfast, it's better than in any restaurant on board. Maybe I can treat you with something?\" He pranced away and went to play some basketball, his muscles were in terrible shape from all that sleeping around. Not with women sadly. The following day she sat in the cafeteria with a blunt food before her. He ordered a luxurious meal and put it before her. He knew her kind, their accounts were very basic, Jim would never travel like that. She looked at the food and he looked at her. She combed her hair and washed her face, but her clothes were still too comfortable to determine what is underneath it, but this wasn't the time to be picky, after all, she was the only woman light years away. \"It won't bite you, then you can tell me how we can fix our pods, surely someone with your skills, and I saw the work you've done, can fix something so small as an ice-pod,\" he smiled at her his best smile and she just stared at him. \"You can take away your food, there is no way of repairing pods, they took their units for freezing out, it can just sustain stasis, not initiate it. I looked at infirmary too, there are restrictions I can't overcome.\" \"Arthur mentioned re-compensation,\" he wasn't alarmed, there's no way Homestead Company would leave them stranded out here, they have something planned. Jim reached with his fork to take a kiwi from her plate but she slapped his hand away. \"He means money, which we can't use here, and maybe you're right, maybe there will be a way to hibernate you,\" she started to eat with an appetite. \"It's not true we don't have anything to spend on here, there are fine restaurants around, and a pool, sauna…\" \"I wouldn't be caught dead in that pool,\" she interrupted him and sighed continuing in a lower voice. \"I'm sorry that it woke you up, it tried to make me choose someone to help me but I refused. I guess I spent too much time by your pod talking to you. It thought I'll approve your choice.\" \"You talked to me in stasis?\" she smirked more and more tuning in on her features, it was something captivating on her face, how would he describe her eyebrows, or her eyes, what was so interesting to her while she talked. Maybe her seriousness. \"Don't be cocky,\" she frowned looking adorable for some reason, Jim smiled and she growled. \"I sat by others too. What can you do alone for a year, talk to sleeping passengers to pass the time.\" \"What did you tell them?\" he slipped in his silent interviewing tone, some of most interesting stories are told by a meal which she eats halfway through. \"Nothing,\" she was defensive but then a pear softened her features, she looked as she was going to cry. \"Small things, thoughts, to everyone different one. As I would to a not very talkative awake person. You look someone in the face, decide what kind of a person is she and then tell her something you hope will interest her.\" \"What did you tell me while I wasn't listening,\" he smiled at her but she didn't see that because she stared at the floor by her feet, he wanted to run his fingers through her hair. It was heart-breaking to picture her all alone for a whole year. \"Nothing important,\" she shrugged her shoulders. \"About repairs, I thought it would interest you as a writer, details and progression. It almost seems that Avalon is leading me in a progressive line towards a core glitch, but I don't understand why it leaves the harder fixes for the end.\" \"Maybe it's testing you, your abilities, to see are you capable,\" he offered taking an untouched avocado from her plate. She looked at him and a smile appeared. The smile confirmed that her features are very pleasing. \"I knew it would engage you,\" she said and flipped her hair which he now noticed how light it was, it was just the perfect colour of the sun. \"It's not a bad theory, this way it can replace me if I prove to be unfit before I mess up something really important.\" \"I'm glad to be of help,\" he smiled. \"And I'm glad to be chosen to keep you company.\" She looked at him with a frown he couldn't decipher. Hopefully another one soon.[Chapter 6] Aurora talks to Arthur. Being alone for a year wasn't the worst thing Aurora could imagine. She was a loner after all. The absence of people was relaxing for her but there was a matter of silence. She played all sorts of music while she could but it was hard to sustain the flow of sounds since she controlled only insides of her cabin. On the corridors, there was no way of controlling the environment. It was made impersonal so no one would get offended by words or sounds. That meant silence. A dreadful silence which stated that the vacuum was just on the other side of the wall. Her work grew in complexity as time went on. That too made her occupied, it made her less aware of her surroundings. To ease her solitude she went and sat beside passengers. There she stared at their faces just to make her eyes remember that she's not alone in the entire universe. With time she started to speak to them out loud pretending that they can hear her as people in coma sometimes could By that writer guy, she spent quite some time. She imagined that he would be interested in her story, that he would write it down after they reach Homestead. That he'll tell it even if he's not aware why is he doing it. As for Arthur, she avoided him as much as she could. After giving him a connection to Avalon, he became creepy beyond measure. Only luck was that he couldn't move away from his counter. Aurora finally understood why androids weren't given legs. Without legs their thoughts even if awaken would stay just that, thoughts. \"You're to repair me,\" said Arthur in the slight automated voice which Avalon used. \"That is a sub-clause of your contract.\" \"What sub-clause, I have read the whole damn thing,\" Aurora was shouting now. \"I would never sign something that would cause me to die on the way there.\" \"It's written in the classified part of the contract,\" Arthur said calmly rubbing a glass. \"Every passenger is attached to Avalon during the trip.\" \"How do you mean attached?\" Aurora felt chills. \"They are just in stasis, it doesn't make them a part of the ship.\" \"But it does,\" Arthur smiled. \"They are a cargo as they are an emergency replaceable units. Each trip has a human to serve as a spare part for the ship.\" Aurora stood in stunned silence for a moment feeling how her life has expired, she was just a drone now, a replacement. \"Which part am I?\" she could sense the answer. \"A repair drone of higher order,\" Arthur said with a smile. \"The one which is in service now can't do anything but basic maintenance. For any malfunction of higher order, you were to be awakened.\" \"But what if I face a challenge I can't solve?\" she felt chills all over her skin. \"Then another spare part will be awakened, but that would be most unfortunate,\" Arthur pouted. \"Why would that be unfortunate?\" Aurora was backing away slowly because Arthur stopped rubbing the glass and stopped smiling. \"Because there is a rule of colliding units. There can't be two similar units awoken at the same time, they might overlap and cause a mutiny.\" After that Aurora worked on repairs, with a pressing sense of urgency. All her thoughts of air chambers and easy death were abandoned. Aurora wished to live more than ever. ","Summary":" Captain's Log Upon waking we found a woman frozen in stasis in our hospital. Three of our passenger"},{"Movie":"Prince & Me","Title":"Prince and Me: The Royal Children","Author":"Cara223","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12965376","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I had been married to the love of my life, Eddie, for the past nineteen years. Throughout those eighteen years, we had been through many challenges and joys, ups and downs, and disappointments. We were currently living in Copenhagen, Denmark in our own house on the outskirts of town. This house allowed us to live a somewhat normal life and allowed us to raise our three children in the privacy of our own home. We had three beautiful children- Christian (17), Aria (15), and our adopted daughter, Nayla (13), from Tanzania. We adopted her from Tanzania after Eddie and I went on a trip there so that I could provide the children in the orphanage with medical care. Soon after we returned, we couldn't get Nayla out of our mind, who was four and a half years old at the time. After discussing it with Eddie and the children, we decided to go back to Tanzania and start the adoption process. Ironically, on her fifth birthday, the adoption became official, and we were her legal parents. Adopting Nayla made us the first interracial Danish royal family. She made us very proud, and Eddie changed the law that stated only biological children could inherit the throne. As a result, Nayla was third to the Danish throne since she was the youngest of our three children. In Denmark, I continued to practice medicine. Currently, I was working in a small private hospital on the outskirts of Denmark. Being a doctor in a hospital can be stressful, but so was raising three teenagers. Currently, I just finished a fifteen hour shift at the hospital and was on my way to have a meeting with Christian's English teacher who wanted to speak with me. \"Come on in,\" Christian's English teacher said after I gently knocked on her classroom door. I closed the door behind me and sat down in the chair in front of her desk. \"Thank you for coming,\" she said. \"Thank you for having me,\" I replied. \"I wanted to have a meeting with you to discuss a few concerns about Christian. First, I have noticed a dramatic decline in his grade,\" she said showing me his recent English paper, which he received an F on. I took the paper and began looking through it. It looked like something that he can written in about twenty minutes before class. There was no thesis, the sentence structure was horrible, and he had several misspellings and gramatical errors. \"The assignment was to write a five page creative ending to Catcher in the Rye . I wanted the students to write about what they thought happened after the end of the book. He gave me barely three pages and based off of what he wrote, I don't think he read the book as assigned,\" she told me as I handed the assignment back to her. \"Did he participate in the class discussions or turn in the homework?\" I asked her. \"That was the other concern I was going to bring up to you. He hasn't been participating in class or turning in any of his HW. He usually sits in the back of the room writing on his laptop or talking to his fellow classmates. I assumed he was taking notes on his laptop but obviously not,\" she explained to me. \"I am so sorry about his rude and disrespectful behavior in your classroom. Please be assured that this will be addressed. It is not acceptable behavior, and he knows better,\" I told his English teacher. \"I haven't been checking his grades online weekly like I used to. What's his overall avergage in your class?\" I asked her. \"He currently has a 45 average,\" she told me, pulling out his grade report. \"A 45!?\" I exclaimed. \"He's been failing his grammar tests and vocabulary tests. When I speak to him about it, he tells me that he has always struggled with the English language,\" she told me. I was shocked by this statement. Christian had always excelled at English because we spoke it at home! \"I cannot believe he said that to you. We speak English at home one day, Danish another day…it's a way for them to maintain the English language. Even so, I feel we mostly speak English at home. I am so sorry Mrs. Herdack for his behavior, for his lack of effort and for him lying to you. I can assure you that his father and I are going to have a long conversation with him. He's going to complete his missing homework assignments, he's going to re-do his paper, he's going to read Catcher in the Rye , and he's defintely going to write you an appology letter,\" I told her firmly. \"I appreciate that but he can't get credit for the missing work or the failing grades,\" Mrs. Herdack told me. \"That's okay. He needs to learn that he has to do the work, and he needs to work hard in life to be successful. His education is the key to his future,\" I said getting angry. \"Sorry, I'm not mad at you. I am just enfuriated with my son,\" I said calming down. \"I appreciate your support,\" she told me standing up. She shook me hand and began to walk me to the door. \"If the behavior doesn't improve or if he still isn't turning in his assignments, please let me know,\" I said as I was leaving the room. \"I'll also check his grades daily.\" \"Thank you Mrs. Morgan-Williams. Please contact me with any concerns as well,\" Mrs. Herdack told me. \"I will. Thank you for your time and for bringing this to my attention,\" I said leaving the classroom. When I started the car, I immediately called Eddie on the bluetooth speaker. I was extremely furious at Christian. What did he think? He was too cool for school now!? \"Hello?\" Eddie said answering the phone. \"Hey…so I just left the meeting with Christian's English teacher,\" I said putting the car into drive. \"And what did she say?\" he asked me. \"Did you know what our son is failing English III honors? His average is a 45!\" I exclaimed. \"Really?\" Eddie replied. He sounded pretty surprised too. \"What did he do?\" \"She showed me his most recent assignment. He didn't even complete it! He was supposed to write a five page creative piece about how Catcher in the Rye ended after the book, and he barely turned in three pages. You should have seen it; it was full of gramatical errors, structure errors, misspellings, his sentences didn't make sense, and his teacher said he didn't even read the book! He hasn't been doing his HW, participating in class, failing the grammar and vocabulary tests, AND he talks during class or just types on his computer. Can you believe it!?\" I exclaimed. \"This is unbelievable. How do you think we should handle this?\" Eddie asked me. \"I want him to complete all of those missing HW assignments. He needs to re-do his paper. I think we should take away his school computer from him since he obviously isn't using it for taking notes in class. He also needs to write an appology letter to Mrs. Herdack. A letter of at least two pages where he explains why his actions are unacceptable. I'm also thinking that we shouldn't let him audition for the spring play if he can't get his grades up in time,\" I replied. \"I agree with you 100 percent. I also think we should take away his TV or cell phone until he gets his grades up,\" Eddie told me. \"I'm thinking his cell phone. It will hurt him more than the TV,\" I said. \"True. Okay so for how long does he lose his cell phone?\" Eddie asked me. \"3 weeks?\" he suggested. \"3 weeks and if his grades aren't up, we'll keep it another 3 weeks. Basically, we'll re-evaluate the situation every three weeks to see if he is bringing up his grades,\" I said. \"What do you think?\" \"That's a good idea. What are we going to do with him?\" Eddie asked me, frustrated. \"I'm all for sending him off to my parents for the summer. A summer working on the farm will have him changed in no time,\" I said. \"I'd rather not have to do that,\" he told me. \"We can use it as a threat though. He knows we'll come through on our threats,\" I replied. \"That's true,\" Eddie sighed heavily. I came home and saw Eddie had made dinner and put it in the oven. We were having lasagna with garlic bread. As I came through the door, Eddie came out of the kitchen, wiping his hand on a towel. \"Give me a moment,\" I said to him as I ran to the bathroom to freshen and to try to calm down. Where did we go wrong with Christian. I came downstairs, asked Nayla and Aria to watch the oven, and we went upstairs to Christian's room. He was on his bed listening to music on his phone. \"Christian,\" I said sternly, opening the door. \"Geez, haven't you ever heard of knocking?\" Christian said with an attitude. \"Watch the attitude,\" Eddie said firmly. \"After work today, I had a nice meeting with Mrs. Herdack, and I found out that my son is failing English class. I couldn't understand that because we speak mostly in English at home. Surely, she had you mixed up with another student, but there is no mistake. You have a 47 average in English III,\" I scolded. \"Mrs. Herdack is crazy! She doesn't speak English correctly,\" Christian said. \"And she doesn't like me for no reason,\" he said sitting up. \"I'm not finished yet. I just had a nice conversation with her. Her English is perfect. She told me that you haven't been doing your homework, you don't participate in class, and you sit in the back either talking or typing on your computer. You have been flunking the vocabulary and grammar tests. On your most recent essay, you barely wrote 3 pages instead of 5. Your grammar, sentence structure and spelling was atrocious. You didn't even read Catcher in the Rye . We raised you better than this. We are extremely disappointed in your behavior,\" I told him. \"Your mother and I have decided to take away your phone for three weeks,\" Eddie said. \"Three weeks!\" Christian exclaimed. \"Do you pay for your phone?\" Eddie asked not waiting for Christian to answer him. \"After three weeks, if your grades are up, we will give you your phone back. If not, we we'll keep it indefintely until your grades are up.\" \"That's totally unfair! You can't do that!\" Christian exclaimed. \"Oh yes, we can. Keep on talking back and it will be no TV too,\" I replied. \"In addition, you are to complete ALL of the missing homework assignments, re-write your essay, and write Mrs. Herdack a two page apology note explaining why your actions are disrespectul and how you are going to change both academically and your behavior in class. You have to turn in everything to me before you can turn it into her,\"' I replied firmly. \"Are you kidding!? Do you know how long it's going to take me to do all of those assignments!?\" Christian exclaimed. \"Then I suggest you get started tonight,\" I replied taking his phone from him and giving it to Eddie. \"And if your behavior doesn't change and if your grades don't change, then you won't be allowed to audition for the spring play,\" Eddie said. \"What!? Are you trying to ruin my life?\" Christian exclaimed. \"And if you still refuse to cooperate, then I'm sure Grandma and Grandpa would like having some extra help on the farm,\" Eddie told Christian. \"You would make me spend the entire summer on the farm!?\" Christian exclaimed. \"Yes and possibly next school-year. Immersion in an American school so you can finally get your English grade up,\" I told him. \"Please no!\" Christian exclaimed. \"The choice is yours. Dinner will be ready in a few minutes. Get those grades up and change your attitude in class. One other thing, no more computer at school. If you have an activity to complete at school, check out an i-pad in the computer lab,\" Eddie told Christian. Eddie and I left Christian's room and went down the stairs. We saw that Aria and Nayla had already set the table. I just looked at Eddie and gave him the look that said \"what are we going to do with him?\" Little did we know this was just the beginning of our problems. Thank you for reading! Please leave me a comment or a message if you like the idea of a story about Paige and Eddie's three rebellious teenagers![Chapter 2] I was walking down the hallway in the hospital after taking a ten minute dinner break when my pager went off. I was needed in the ER, and I began to briskly walk over there. This was an eighteen hour shift, and I was only about halfway completed. I entered the designated room and was surprised to see Anne-Lisa, Aria's friend from high school, lying on the bed, sweating, pale and shaking. I had seen a lot of gruesome images in the ER, but I was always surprised to see someone that I knew in the ER, especially when the patient was my daughter's best friend. After looking over her chart and her vitals, I asked Anne-Lise some questions. \"She's been like this since she came from school. We're not sure what's going on. She's been vomiting a lot too,\" her mother, Birtha, told me. \"It could possibly be the flu or a virus. But I'll run a few tests to rule out anything more serious,\" I said and gave the nurse instructions to draw some blood. Shortly afterwards, we were moving Anne-Lise to a room to be monitored for the night, and I was analyzing the blood results. I was shocked to discover that she was not suffering from the flu but was actually going with withdrawal from an illegal drug. Anne-Lise was Aria's best friend. Was Aria was taking illegal drugs as well? I called Anne-Lise's parents into a private conference room when Anne-Lise was asleep, and I had a moment to discuss the results of her blood work with them. \"Is everything okay?\" Birtha asked me as we were walking down the hallway. \"Let's just have a seat in the conference room,\" I replied quietly. I saw the color drain from her face. I didn't mean to worry her. It was a tricky situation; I wasn't Paige in this situation. I wasn't her friend and the mother of her daughter's best friend. I was Dr. Morgan-Williams, and I was about to deliver some devastating news. I closed the door behind us and sat down across from Anne-Lise's parents. \"I reviewed Anne-Lise's blood work, and she isn't suffering from the flu or a stomach virus. Her blood work indicated that she has several drugs in her system- primarily heroine and ecstasy. Anne-Lise isn't sick; she is going through withdrawal,\" I explained to them. Her parents stared blankly at me for a few minutes, and I continued to speak to them. \"I can recommend some good rehabilitation programs for Anne-Lise. We can keep her here overnight, but she needs to get professional help that we cannot offer here,\" I said handing Birtha some pamphlets. \"You have to be incorrect,\" Anne-Lise's dad, Aksel, told me, pushing the pamphlets back at me. \"Isn't it possible that you mixed up her blood with another patient's? My daughter isn't a drug addict,\" he said quietly. \"I'm so sorry. It isn't a mistake. I always double check the name of the blood sample and the results. I'm so sorry. I know this wasn't the news you wanted to hear,\" I replied gently to them. \"So, how do we proceed from here?\" Birtha asked me. \"I'll turn Anne-Lise's case over to the social worker so we can get her into a good rehabilitation program tomorrow,\" I said and watched as Birtha burst into tears. This honestly had to be one of the hardest parts about being a doctor…having to deliver bad news to family members. \"Do you have any questions for me?\" I asked them getting up. Birtha and Aksel shook their head, and I got up from my seat along with them. I went over and gave Birtha a hug. \"It'll be okay,\" I said as she sobbed. \"You have to be strong for Anne-Lise, and you have to support her. She's in for a rough road ahead, but she will be okay. I know she will be okay,\" I said trying to be encouraging. \"Thank you, Paige,\" she replied. \"I have to get going but feel free to stay in here for another moment if you want to talk amongst yourselves,\" I said leaving and closing the door behind me. Later that evening, I came home in the middle of the night after my long shift. I was exhausted, and I was so happy to know that I had tomorrow off. I was technically on call, but it wasn't likely that I would be called into work. Also, I couldn't get the events of the night out of my mind. If Anne-Lise was that heavily involved in drugs, was Aria also involved in drugs? I couldn't tell Aria about what happened to Anne-Lise due to patient privacy, but I had to do my best to get an answer out of her. I arrived at home and walked quietly into the house and upstairs to the master bedroom. I entered the room quietly and closed the door behind me. Quickly, I gathered my pajamas to take a shower and crawl into bed. \"Paige?\" Eddie said groggily. \"Sorry I woke you,\" I said quietly. \"I need to talk to you about something,\" Eddie said sleepily, turning on the light and sitting up. \"Oh no,\" I said taking off my scrubs and put them in a separate laundry basket. I put on a sweatshirt and a pair of sweatpants and sat down on the bed. \"What happened?\" I asked. \"Christian's school principal called me today. He skipped English class today. I told Christian that he wasn't allowed to audition for the spring play. He's lost that privilege,\" Eddie told me. \"I also took away his car privileges until further notice.\" I sighed heavily. \"What are we going to do with these rebellious children?\" I asked Eddie, running my fingers through my hair. \"If his behavior doesn't change, we're going to have to send him to work on my parent's farm for the summer,\" I replied. \"And then he'll become your parent's problem,\" Eddie said chuckling. \"Yeah…although I don't know how fair that is to them,\" I said smiling at Eddie. \"It's a good threat, and he knows that we will follow through if necessary,\" Eddie told me. \"And since he lost car privileges, my mom said she'll get someone to take them to school tomorrow,\" he told me. \"I'll do it,\" I said sighing. \"No! It's your day off!\" Eddie exclaimed. \"But she'll just get Soren to do it, and his wife just had a baby three weeks ago,\" I said. Soren actually lived in the house next door to our house. Even though Eddie and I broke tradition by living outside of the palace to raise our family, it was decided that for our safety (mostly by Rosalind) that Eddie's bodyguard (Soren) needed to live close to us. As a result, he lived right next door to us. In the event of emergency, we would be able to call for his help. However, we lived out on the countryside of Copenhagen. There was our house and Soren's house (protected by security system and a high fence) and no other houses for a few miles down the road. We've never had any issues. \"You know, what? I'll do it. I have to be at Parliament by 8am tomorrow for a meeting, so I'll have to drop the kids off at school extra early. It'll be good for them. Christian can finally catch up on his missing English homework and assignments,\" Eddie told me, reaching for his phone to text his mom. \"There was something that I wanted to talk to you about as well,\" I told Eddie once he put his phone down. \"You can't say anything to Aria about it or anyone.\" Eddie nodded to show that he understood. \"Anne-Lise was in the emergency room tonight,\" I said whispering so low that even Eddie had to lean-in to hear me. \"I treated her. She was going through drug withdrawal- heroine and ecstasy was in her system and who knows what else she's tried. Her parents are putting her through a drug rehab program,\" I told him. \"You don't think Aria…?\" Eddie began trailing off. \"I don't know. I was going to ask you the same question. They would hang out all the time. I'm worried that Aria has been taking these drugs as well,\" I told Eddie. \"How should we handle this?\" Eddie asked me. \"We need to wait till she finds out from her friends about Anne-Lise being in rehab. Then, we can gently approach the subject although I doubt she would be honest with us,\" I told Eddie. \"I'm going to search her room tomorrow for drugs. If I find something, I'll call you, and we can figure out how to handle it,\" I said running my fingers through my hair. \"Let me know either way…If she's on drugs, we have a serious problem on our hands,\" Eddie said, sighing heavily. \"I know…I know,\" I said quietly. Was Aria the daughter we thought we knew? Or was she hiding a dark secret? ","Summary":" I had been married to the love of my life, Eddie, for the past nineteen years. Throughout those eig"},{"Movie":"Prince & Me","Title":"The Prince And Her","Author":"ikissedward","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6058186","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"God this sucks\" I whined starring at my open calculus book. \"How does anybody actually enjoy this stuff so much as to teach it?\" I slammed by book disgusted. Ever since college started last week I wanted to relive my glory days from high school. When all the skinny, preppy girls would stare at me disgusted, but I wasn't so low as to hang out with the kids who acted semi retarded. Just 'middle class's as my best friends Ara and Maria would say. Speaking of them, I was supposed to meet them in Maria's dorm in two minutes. I hurriedly grabbed my coat, and ran to the elevator. Extending my arm to press the down button, a guy beat me to it. \"Thanks\" I replied reflexively. \"My pleasure\" was the reply that came. The accent sounded European like British. His voice made me look up at him and it seemed that his face matched his voice. He was gorgeous from his head to his muscular legs that where shown off in a pair of tighter fitting jeans. To say toes would be too much because for all I knew he could have hairy jungle toes. I tried to make a witty comment but absolutely nothing came out of my mouth. Was I speech impaired or something? I usually have the biggest mouth ever please pie hole don't fail me know. \"Ummm...nice accent\" oh God I changed my mind please just shut up. Yvette, just never speak again. I would take pleasure in just dying in a hole all alone without a bag of hot Cheetos. I was saved from a reply by the bell. We both got in and I reached for the ground button but this time I actually beat him to it. \"Got to it first\" I said without thinking but he laughed so I thought it was ok to laugh at myself too. The elevator ride was just as awkward because neither he nor I wanted to speak. I just kept starring at the ground hoping that the elevator ride would go quick. I decided to turn and catch a glimpse of his form before I left. I looked up at him through my eye lashes, but he was starring at me too. I blushed and had to ask, \"What?\" \"Nothing,\" he laughed \"it's just that you have an accent too.\" \"No I don't. I'm from Chicago.\" \"Well, I'm from Denmark and there you would have an accent. Just like here I have an accent.\" He laughed at my baffled expression. I had no reply for this so for the rest of the ride, I just kept quiet. After six more people entered the elevator we finally reached the ground floor and I dashed to the parking lot to find my green Toyota matrix. Once I spotted it, I got in and tried to start it but it wouldn't even crank. Trying another ten times I gave up and decided to call Maria and tell her that I couldn't make our study session. She said that that she was on her way to my dorm anyway because there was a rumor that there was a new hot foreign student living there. I laughed at her hormones and calmly called a tow truck to take my car to the shop. Hoping that I wouldn't run into the guy with the accent that I could only guess was the foreign student. The whole way to the dorm I didn't see him so I rejoiced by buying a Twix bar from the vending machine before entering my room. Cracking open my candy I hear a knock at the door, thinking it was Maria and Ara I didn't even bother to put pants back on. There standing in my door was the foreign student starring at me in my underwear. I slammed the door in his face and tore through my room searching for something to cover my huge butt in. I wasn't even skinny and now the hot guy saw my cottage cheesy thighs. That is so embarrassing. Again I hear a knock at the door so I grabbed the only shorts I could find, which were my high school gym shorts and answered the door. There he was standing in the same place that I left him before, but this time he had a goofy smile on his face. Behind him were my best friends cracking up at my red hot face. \"Umm… hi?\" I questioned him dumbly. \"Well I was invited to study with you and your friends but if I was interrupting something then I should leave.\" He answered jokingly What he wasn't expecting was my answer, \"yes, I was in the middle of filming my girls gone wild video, so if you will excuse me.\" I reached out to Maria and Ara and pulled them into my room making him look like a fool but before I could close my door Maria grabbed his hand and pulled him inside as well. I tried to hide my annoyance but I knew it would if I didn't find something that could raise my spirits. Like talking about this weekend and starting my new job in a bar across the street to my dorm. Hopefully it was going to be ok but my mom was worried that something was going to happen with a drunken Guy. My mom is a cop and God only knows at would happen to him if he even looked at me the wrong way. \"You guys I got the job at the bar\" I said focusing on the two girls and ignoring the two guys? \"Where the hell did you come from?\" I asked abruptly. God I hate when I speak without thinking. \"I'm one of Eddie's friends\" he replied with an accent also. \"Are you from Denmark too?\" \"Yes, I would like to think that he and I grew up together.\" He laughed. What at I have no clue but 'Eddie' gave him a look and he stopped mid snort. It got really awkward but Ara said, \"Oh my God Yvette, Congrats I know you really wanted that job. Now we all work in the same place except we all come home smelling different. I come home smelling like Windex, you are going to smell like beer, Eddie is going to smell like Ham and Ara smells just like hard liquor.\" \"Uh... Ara why do you have to make it sound so unattractive? God knows beer isn't the best smelling thing but it can be a good perfume with sweat\" I, Ara, and Eddie laughed but Maria looked at us and rolled her eyes. But it just hit me what she said. \"Wait Eddie your working with Ham?\" I asked confused. \"Yeah\" he said after laughing, \"they are opening up a deli during the day and I will be working there and cleaning at night. So we will be seeing a lot of each other\" he said and winked at me. I got back little disappointed because I wanted this to be a best friend thing not a best friend plus a random foreign Guy thing. I just stayed quiet and opened my calculus book and tried to study again. Everyone left at around 10 and I dozed off without taking a shower sitting at my desk. Who knew Shakespeare could be such a cozy pillow.[Chapter 2] I awoke to the sound of the shower going and the smell of fresh coffee. \" oh no\" please tell me it's before eight,\" Becca what time is it?\" I questioned my room mate who had just gotten out of the shower \" its seven o'clock\" was her heavenly reply. I couldn't even express the relief I felt when she's said that. I rushed to get ready because I had to make it to Graham hall by eight walking. This was going to be a mission. I left my dorm building at seven thirty and walked the fastest I could. This should have been comical, a fat girl almost running down the street but I just blended in with everyone else trying to get to class on time. I made it to chem. With five minutes to spare. Trying to hide the dew that accumulated on my forehead I grabbed a seat in the back hoping nobody would notice me. Our professor would assign partners today and I hoped he would assign me somebody who would pull their weight because I really needed this class to be a veterinarian. Once class started he passed out lists of things we would need to divide between us and our partners. I looked over the list and knew this would be pricey. Just when he was about to announce partner's Eddie came into the room. \"Is there something that you need?\" My professor asked offended that his class was being disturbed. \"Yes, I think I'm signed up for this class.\" Was his nonchalant reply. \"Oh dear God no. Pease tell me his is joking \"I prayed silently. \"Ok take a seat Mr. Williams. There is one by Ms. Sanabria over in the back.\" Oh no he is coming this way smiling. Does he even know how much he annoys me? He is way to cocky for me to even find attractive oh and look he is telling his little puppy to leave. That's cute. Wait that Guy must be his lover. I mean he never said anything about me in my underwear and he is always with that Guy. They are both from Denmark, it couldn't be more obvious that he was gay, he his way to good looking to be straight anyway. I relaxed a little realizing this because gay guys make me more comfortable, I have no idea why. \"Hello\" he greeted me. I had no reply but nodded my head in acknowledgment. I was comfortable, that didn't mean I liked him. \"Everyone introduces yourselves to the person sitting next to you because this will be your partner for the rest of the semester\" the professor said out loud. \"Oh God I think I'm going to be sick\" I stated. Wit oh my God did I just say that out loud. That's so rude. \"I'm sorry\" I said apologetically. He just nodded his head I think I hurt his feelings. I feel bad. The whole class professor knows a lot lectured. I noticed that Eddie wasn't taking notes so I knew that I would make a copy at the library and bring it to his dorm just to get off of thin ice with him. If we were going to be lab partner's things had to be civilized between us. After all my classes were done, I literally ran to the library and made a copy of my three pages of notes. Now to the hard part, where the hell did Eddie live? I decided to stop at the dorm info desk. After another twenty minutes of walking I walked into the massive hall that was the universities home. All the windows where tinted giving the feeling of it being darkness all the time. The hall had a Gothic theme that made me think of Italy. \"Excuse me; I was wondering if you could tell me where Eddie Williams lives? I have notes for him but I forgot where he said his dorm was.\" I asked as politely as I could muster after running around like a lap dog for a Guy that annoys me to death. \"And he gave you this info already?\" She asked. \"yeah but it was at 8:00 in the morning so I kind of forgot and I didn't write it down.\" I lied so smoothly I surprised myself. She willingly gave me his dorm room which was on the same floor as mine. By the time I got to his dorm bit was nine at night and I just wanted to get home and study. I knocked on the brood timidly and his lover answered the door. I smiled and asked, \" is Eddie in?\" He gave me no facial expression, opened the door wider and motioned me to come in. The room seemed to be pretty neat, except for a corner of the room that was littered with old socks, soda cans, and cheese stains. Looking at that spot made me cringe, hopefully that wasn't how messy he was, because neatness is a great quality to have in a lab partner. \"Is there something that you need?\" Eddie asked from the top bunk to the right of the room. \"Rude much?\" I questioned, \"I brought you this\" I handed him my notes, \"I noticed that you didn't take any in chem. Today, so consider this as a white flag, but don't expect notes ever again.\" I ended seriously with a threatening stare. He didn't seem to notice my menacing look and he looked shocked, \"thanks, but I thought you hated me?\" \"Its not that I hate you, \"I said looking rather uncomfortable \"its just that you seem so stuck up and careless and I really don't like that. So basically I don't hate you I just dislike you.\" He laughed at that and I gave a nod and let myself out, the last thing that I heard was a second thank you from him before I shut the door. I can't believe that I did that. He must think I'm a complete psycho for finding where he lives, and then watching him not take notes. Will I even be able to face him tomorrow. I think yes, because I really don't care what he thinks and I'm going to have to spend a lot of time with him since I start work tomorrow too. I really don't know when he starts but knowing my luck its tomorrow too. I guess I should study for Shakespeare because truthfully I have no idea what the hell the crazy lunatic is talking about. Maybe Shakespeare and Eddie have something in common, they both are most likely gay.

Literally frozen. I reached up to feel my long brown hair, sticking out behind me, and crunched it between my gloved hands. I just couldn't believe it. I grew up in Pennsylvania and, yeah, the winters could be bad now and then. But this? This brought a whole new meaning to \"harsh\" winter. What would Vickers say? I mentally went down the list of grievances my roommate would have against all of my terrible decisions today as I made my way up Heart Attack Hill in the subzero temperatures. First and foremost, she'd tell me I should've worn a hat to protect my hair from the weather. Then she'd comment on my poor choice of footwear. I looked down at my sparkly flats, now completely soaked through from the snow and ice. The knee high socks I wore under them were of little use now. I tried to wiggle my toes to get feeling back into them, but I knew at this rate I wouldn't feel my toes again until I took a hot shower this afternoon. Which would be the moment when Vickers would throw some kind of special conditioner treatment over the shower door and tell me to use it on my previously frozen hair. Ah, Vickers. I was really going to miss her. I crested the hill and barely spared a glance either way before hastily crossing the street. Vickers would also have something to say about my canny ability to be late to most everything. She wasn't wrong, but what's a minute or two here and there? Granted, Dr. Mannard did warn us he'd lock the door if we were late today, but really, who was he kidding? The more I thought about the short, crazy-haired, Irish Catholic professor turning the lock as I arrived to take my final, the faster my numb feet seemed to move. I didn't even remember walking through the Oak Grove; I was suddenly coming upon the history building. Usually, I'd take a moment to admire the historic structure; its large windows, the formidable simplicity of it. But today, I hurried inside the heavy door and was met with a blast of oil heat. Its heaviness settled upon me, and I started unwinding my scarf as I took the stairs two at a time to the second floor. Exiting the stairwell, I glanced down the long hallway at all the unused lockers on either side. To me, Keith Hall always looked like an old high school. Theoretically it was, but not in the usual sense. The building was used as a Normal School, where teachers in Western Pennsylvania would learn to teach students in a training school. I could see Mannard's classroom door was still open, thank God. I slowed as I approached the door and was met by Dr. Mannard's smiling, albeit knowing, face. \"Vivian. You made it. Just barely,\" he said, pointedly. I gave him a nervous laugh and headed for my seat in the back corner. Andy and Dan were already in their seats. Andy gave me a smile and a nod while I sat down next to him; Dan just sat there with his chin resting on his fists. The only acknowledgement I received from him was an eyeball glance in my direction as I walked past him to my seat. After what happened last night, you'd think I'd get a little more than that. I took off my gloves and coat and laid all of my things on the radiator next to my desk. There was really no pleasure equal to putting on warm clothes right before you needed to brave the elements again. I slipped off my shoes and pressed my wet feet against the bottom of the radiator, in an effort to dry my socks. Andy saw what I was doing and shook his head, chuckling. \" What?\" I mouthed to him. \"Alright,\" Dr. Mannard announced, calling our attention to the front of the room, \"I think that's enough waiting. If you don't know it by now, you won't know it when you get to the essay section. You guys know the drill by this point. Term matching first. Then your short essays. Pick three of the five and be sure to tell me why it is significant. And, of course, the long essays. Choose two of the four.\" As he handed out the tests, he continued, \"I want it known that I was nice to you all this time around.\" My snort joined the other quiet laughs that rumbled through the otherwise silent room. \"Alright, you have the entire class period to work on this. Good luck.\" \"How was Mannard?\" Vickers asked over a steaming cup of chai tea. We had all retreated to the local coffee shop, where I spent the majority of my days either hanging out with friends, reading a book, or doing school work. I was sipping my latte, chancing a glance at Dan over the top of my mug. I knew he wouldn't look up at me; he never did. He'd act like I wasn't even there until everyone else was gone. Then he'd chat with me, with only one word answers; as if he didn't really care what I thought or had to say. Then he would likely suggest we head back to his place. But until then, he'd ignore me. Andy spoke up first, \"I was fine until I got to the short essay. I couldn't remember the third method of transport for the Market Revolution. And of course Mannard would put some religious movement question on there that no one studied.\" \"I did that one,\" I chimed in. \"That's because you can mention Moravians in it,\" said Dan. I gave him a dirty look, as I typically did when he made a jab at my lesser known religion. \"Yeah, well, after George Whitefield, what did it really matter?\" Andy continued. Then looking at Vickers, \"I'm not expecting anything better than a B. What about you? Matt told me Moore was especially cruel this year.\" Vickers nodded and discussed her Ancient Civ final with Andy. Dan was texting someone, holding his phone under the table, not paying attention to anyone around him. My eyes wandered over his face. His long, dark eyelashes. I could remember how his eyes would change suddenly when we were alone. His gaze would intensify and his eyelids would relax. My eyes wandered down to his straight nose and I could remember the feel of his nose pressing into my skin as he ran kisses up my neck. Then I looked at his full lips. I remembered tugging on his lower lip while we kissed. Feeling his stubble prick my lower lip and chin. My face was growing hotter by the minute. I forced myself back to the conversation at hand and did my best to ignore Dan's obvious presence so close to me. \"What are you doing for lunch?\" I asked Vickers. It was Friday, so the lower dining hall would have grilled cheese and tomato soup. \"I have to swing by the library to print a paper for Pre-Law. Might just grab a sandwich from the cart in the Oak Grove on my way,\" she said. I looked to Andy to see if he'd be free and suddenly felt a foot, steadily climbing up the inside of my calf. I glanced at Dan and saw him raise an eyebrow ever so slightly at me before looking back to Andy. \"Eh, I don't have anything to do until 2. What were you thinking?\" Andy asked. I knew what Dan wanted and to be fair, I wanted it too. Things had really been heating up this semester after I crushed on him all last year. He was really showing an interest in me and I didn't want to mess it up. \"Oh, well, now that I think about it, I really ought to swing by the Study Abroad office and pick up some papers that I need to send out,\" I said, not entirely lying. I did have papers I needed to pick up, but it didn't have to be right then and there. \"Yeah, I should go with you to get mine. I've been procrastinating,\" said Dan. \"Big surprise,\" mumbled Vickers. She knew about the secret relationship Dan and I had, and she didn't approve of it. She kept telling me if he really liked me, he'd let other people know instead of asking me to keep it quiet. And now with the two of us going on a study abroad in a few weeks to the same university, she was becoming pretty vocal with her warnings. She had yet to bring up last night, when I rolled into our apartment at 2am the night before a final. I had mumbled something to her about studying with Andy and Dan for Mannard's class and crawled into my bed, hoping she wouldn't ask for details. I had spent the better part of the evening studying for the final with Andy and Dan. But after Andy peeled off toward his apartment during our walk home, Dan pulled me down a darker walkway between the library and the music hall. He roughly pinned me against the brick wall and before I could say anything, his lips crashed down into me. He ran his hands down my sides and back up to undo the buttons on my pea coat. Before I knew it, he had his hands up my shirt; one on the small of my back pulling me closer to him and the other squeezing my breast over my bra. By the time we were done with our make out session, my mouth was dry and scratchy and my neck and face felt raw after his stubble scratched me for the better part of an hour. \"You're still on for tonight, right?\" Andy asked us. He and his roommate, Will, were planning a mini party in their apartment. They were usually pretty low-key and often led to a night out down town in one of the bars. \"Paul is on his way now. He said he's bringing his roommate, Paul. You don't mind if we all come tonight? Paul said he brought something for you especially…whatever that means,\" Vickers told Andy. \"No problem,\" replied Andy. Then he looked to me, \"You're not backing out tonight. I won't let you.\" I assured Andy I'd be there and got up to leave with Dan in tow. We silently made our way back across campus. I blew on my latte to spread its warmth up to my face. The wind was beginning to pick up; stinging my face as it whipped past us. Dan seemed more concerned with creating enough space between us, lest someone figure out our secret. It always hurt when I noticed this, but I figured he just liked to keep our business to ourselves. I never had a boyfriend before; maybe this was what it was like. My brothers never came home gushing about a girl. Come to think of it, I never gushed to them about a boy either, like I do with my friends, so maybe that wasn't the best example to use. He did tell me a lot about himself; his goals in life, his happy news, and the sad. Only a year ago, he called me as I was heading out to dinner with Vickers and I'd never forget our conversation; nor would I forget how utterly miserable he sounded. \"My dad died today.\" I was speechless. My knees gave out and I ended up awkwardly crouched on the floor, my free hand grasping the wall to steady myself. Tears had sprung to my eyes and silently rolled down my cheeks. I knew this guy barely two months, and I was so heartbroken for him. I don't even think I thought of my own family; I just kept thinking about how much I wanted to comfort Dan, in any way I could. \"I…Dan, I'm so so sorry. I'm sorry; I don't know what to say except that I'm so sorry.\" We were silent for another minute or so. I could hear him crying quietly. \"Can I do anything? Know that you can call me if you need anything,\" I said once I had pulled myself together. I had to be strong for him. \"Thanks,\" he whispered. \"I gotta go now. Could you tell the others?\" \"Of course.\" \"Okay. Bye, Vivian.\" We talked about his dad a lot lately. Especially after the one year anniversary of his death. That was hard for me. I never lost anyone so close to me, so I had no idea what to say. I'd just let him talk and get out his feelings. In unguarded moments, Dan often told me I was the only one he could talk to; the only one who understood. I knew what he meant; it was as if we were pulled to each other. Some kind of force between us that neither of us could explain. I glanced his way now. Clearly, this was the cool, calm, uncaring Dan; walking next to his fellow classmate, with nothing to say. But I knew the real Dan. The Dan whose heart sped up when he touched me. The Dan who took my hand and pulled me closer to him when a shady person passed us on campus at night. The Dan who collapsed in my arms after a long walk and cried on my shoulder. The Dan whose eyes would always seem to find mine when either of us entered a room. The Dan who clearly cared about me. The Dan no one else knew. \"Alright, Vivian, all you need at this point is a copy of your transcripts from the Bursar's Office and a receipt of payment from Financial Aid to present to Oxford once you're there. This is your acceptance letter. You will need this when you pass through Customs to prove you're there to study and you intend to leave. Do. Not. Forget. This.\" Amy passed me a folder, moving it up and down as she emphasized her last command. I took it from her and opened it up, reading it to myself. Amy moved on to Dan's instructions to prepare for our trip. It was six months in the making, but I was finally going to do it. I was going to study abroad in England. I couldn't wait. I'd develop an accent, ride on Harry Potter trains, wear cloaks, live in \"houses\", and maybe even meet a royal! By the time everyone else was coming back to campus for the Spring Semester, Dan and I would be boarding a plane with another student from our university and heading to Oxford, England to study at Queen's College. Dan introduced me to the other student, John Fridg, a week ago. Apparently, they went to high school together and had known each other most of their lives. Dan wasn't particularly talkative with his old friend, but then again, when was he ever talkative with anyone besides me? Fridg, as he preferred to be called, was a short, pale, fair haired science major. He was shy but seemed to warm up to me once we started talking about our upcoming trip. He seemed alright, but even if he wasn't cool, I wouldn't be forced to see him all the time. His room was on the first floor of our dorm while Dan and I would have our own bedrooms in the same flat on the third floor. My parents were becoming increasingly worried about my time abroad; I'd never been away from them for so long, let alone across an ocean with Skype and email as our only means of communication. I was a little concerned myself, being on my own in an unfamiliar city. I looked away from my acceptance letter once Dan finished his conversation with Amy and we walked out of the office together. At the door, Dan moved ahead of me to hold it open. I looked up at him as I passed through and I realized I wasn't going to be alone in an unknown city, thousands of miles away from home. I'd have Dan.[Chapter 2] Hi everyone, sorry for the long hiatus in this story. I was wedding planning! I hope to keep up with this story, as my head has been swimming with ideas for it. I'm always hesitant to post a chapter because I read so many other fanfics on this site and am so impressed with everyone's writing. I can't help but feel inadequate! So please be kind and know I'm not a professional writer and never took classes in fictional writing. I just do this for fun :) This chapter is a bit short, but I wanted to get it out in the universe so I could move on to introducing you to Exeter College in the next chapter, and I SWEAR, the prince will finally make an appearance ;) Ta! P.S. Names of characters have changed since the first chapter, sorry for any confusion \"Welcome to the United Kingdom, Miss Davenport.\" I took back my passport, thanked the border agent, collected my bags and moved forward to wait beyond the Border Control area for Dan and Fridg. Looking back at the crowd waiting to pass through customs, I couldn't believe it. Here I was. After all this time. I couldn't pinpoint that moment in my life when I knew I wanted to visit England, but I'm certain it was immediately following the moment I discovered England had a royal family. Barbie became Princess Vivian. Ken was Prince Kenneth. They lived in the Barbie Mansion, which was renamed Bucking- ham Palace. They had hundreds of servants and lavish dinner parties with wealthy dignitaries. They were the envy of the whole world. I began asking my mom to buy me tiaras and long flowing dress up skirts. I even turned an old twirling baton into a sceptre with ribbons. I'd walk around my room bestowing royal gifts upon my stuffed animals. My bookshelves were filled with royalty-themed fiction and all of my research projects in school were about England. The fantasy of becoming a princess became an obsession which I suppose I never quite grew out of completely; but obviously reality eventually kicked in. In high school, I received a packet in the mail offering me a summer learning experience in Europe. My family seriously considered it for a while, but ultimately my parents decided we could not afford it. I can still remember holding the colourful, glossy brochure in my hands; the smiling teens looking up at me with Big Ben in the background. I cried as I dropped the brochure in the trash and promised myself I would get there one day. One day I would walk along the Seine and eat ice cream like Audrey Hepburn in Charade . One day I would float through the canals of Venice on a gondola and bask in the Italian sun. One day I would sit in an old dirty pub and throw a ball for the friendly resident dog while watching a soccer match with rowdy fans. One day I would step off a plane and deeply inhale another continent's air; breathe in its history, its inherent difference. Today was that day, and I could feel the excitement coursing through my body. This was my first time visiting another country; Canada didn't count. Having only officially set foot in England, it was surprising to already see so many differences from home. Once we collected our carry-on luggage and exited the plane onto the walkway, I was shocked by the warmth. I had to stop halfway through to remove my winter coat. The temperature was oddly warm for January; nothing like the 20 degrees it was back home where everything was covered in snow. It wasn't balmy, but if I were back at school and it was this warm, we'd probably be laying out in the Oak Grove enjoying the weather. It even smelled different here. An odd combination of damp and fresh; if that's even possible. The British accent was suddenly all around me. For the first time in my life, I was the odd voice out. My accent abruptly seemed unintelligent. It was such an odd feeling to be embarrassed to speak for fear that someone would immediately identify me as not belonging here. \"All set?\" Dan asked as he wheeled his bag towards me with Fridg at his side. I nodded and we passed through to the main airport area. It was only 6:30 in the morning, so the airport was rather empty. We were meant to be picked up by a school shuttle at eight, so we had some time to kill. While I searched for the restroom, Dan and Fridg found a place to sit down with enough room for our bags. There was even a television and a coffee counter nearby. Once I found them, I dropped my two suitcases on the chairs next to our table. Lugging those beasts around for the last half hour was becoming tedious. I made my way to the little coffee counter and ordered a latte and a cinnamon Danish. The breakfast on the airplane was some kind of warmed ham sandwich and a fruit cup; not exactly a breakfast made in heaven. This latte and Danish would hopefully make up for it. \"Your table number?\" The lady at the register asked. \"My table number?\" I looked around confused, then saw that all of the tables had a small brass square on them at the corner, marked with a number. Dan and Fridg were at table 11. I told the woman and she nodded, \"3 pound, 46.\" Hokay, here we go. You got this Vivian. You stared at these bills for weeks since you brought them back from the bank. You practically knew them by heart now. So colourful and slightly plastic feeling. I fished out a twenty-pound note, handed it to the cashier and received my change – mostly coins, which annoyed me. I hate coins. They weigh me down and jingle in my pocket. I stashed my change in my pocket and went over to the table to wait with the boys. \"How'd it go?\" Dan sarcastically asked me, nodding at my lack of breakfast. \"Alright. I suppose they bring it over to the table,\" I tapped the brass number on the table corner. \"She only gave me one bill and the rest were coins. I can already tell that's going to be a problem.\" I pulled out the change to look at it closer. A ten-pound note, three two-pound coins, and some smaller coins. I noticed they didn't have the equivalent of a quarter but instead a 20 pence coin. That was interesting, and it had a neat heptagonal shape to them. I could hear the news broadcast from the television above us; the lilting accent of the anchor soothing and melodic. Glancing up, I saw the forecast scrolling at the bottom of the screen. 7 degrees in Birmingham right now. 7 degrees Celsius. What was that conversion we learned in grade school? I knew you had to do something with the number 32 at some point. The waitress appeared with my breakfast. She placed my Danish and latte on the table and I thanked her as she retreated to her counter once more. I pulled out my travel journal as the guys went up to place their orders. Time seemed to pass slowly while we waited for 8am to roll around. I managed to update my travel journal, finished my breakfast and discovered there had been quite a lot of rain in England this week. The TV was constantly showing images of flooded racing courses and streets. At quarter of eight, we gathered our bags and walked toward the arrivals area where drivers were waiting with placards displaying their customers' names. I saw a grubby older man holding one reading \"Oxford University\" and figured that was our ride. The man introduced himself as Colin and led us outside to his waiting van. He took my two large bags and hoisted them with a grunt into the trunk and told me to hop in the front. I went around to the side and opened the door only to be faced with the driver's seat. How could I forget? But it was still odd to see; the wheel on the wrong side of the car. I quietly closed the door and walked around the front to get into the other side, hoping no one noticed my mistake. A minute later, Colin climbed into the driver's seat as the boys got in the back and shut the door. \"So,\" Colin looked as me as he pulled out into the flow of traffic exiting the airport, \"Yam gewin ta Exeter College in the hopes of meetin' the prince?\" I laughed off his joke, trying to ignore the utter fear hitting me as we pulled out onto the left side of the road. This was perfectly normal for them, but I couldn't help the feeling that I should be the one driving. The lack of a wheel and pedals on my side was just bizarre and unnerving. Once I adjusted and became used to Colin's driving and the cars around us, I recalled what he said about the prince. He must have been joking about the American-girl-comes-to-England-to-marry-the-prince stereotype. It's every American girl's dream after all. It had to be a joke. The Prince of Wales had already graduated from some place in Scotland. And as far as I knew, the younger prince had gone into the military. Certainly, no one mentioned it while we were selecting our study abroad university and you'd think that'd be a huge selling point. \"It'll chus be too oars traffic,\" Colin said to us all as we approached a denser section of highway. I was really struggling to understand Colin. All I heard was something about traffic. I looked at him and said, \"Oh, that's not a problem. We're used to traffic at home too.\" He gave me the oddest expression, as if I said something stupid. What did I say? What did he say? \"Yow'll have ta fergive mar mouth. Dow quite werk when yow bin born in teh Black Country.\" Colin smiled at me and continued, \"Arm sayin t'it wud tekk too oars teh reach teh school. Too oars travel .\" I nodded my understanding and decided it would be two silent oars . What if everyone talked like this at Oxford? How would I be expected to learn if I'd have to learn another English language first? Dan and Fridg found Colin's accent guessing game hilarious and chatted with him the entire ride. I honestly think they only figured out four of his sentences. They feigned understanding the rest of the time. When we exited the highway, I assumed we were rather close to the college now. We went around a couple circles where, in America we'd have stop signs and four way intersections, and continued on a smaller road, lined by homes and bushes. The homes looked just like Harry Potter's home on Privet Drive. The similarities were uncanny. The front yards (if you could call it that; they were so small) were made up of gravel or pavers, complete with cars parked on them and trash cans sitting right there next to their front door. My mom would have killed me if I ever parked on the front yard or left the trash can where people could see it from the road. Now that we were driving on a two-lane road, the uneasiness of being on the left side returned. Busses flew by us on the right side in the opposite direction and I tried my best not to flinch or fidget in my seat. I would likely get used to this eventually, but it clearly was not going to happen today. Colin turned us down another road, this one less populated, and began to reduce speed. I glanced at a passing building and for the first time saw a sign with \"Oxford University\" at the top. On the left, cyclists travelled down a path running parallel to the road. Trees lined the middle median. Brick and stone buildings rose up on either side with leaded glass windows. Further down the road, the brick buildings were no more and the road squeezed down to one lane. Now only light tan stone buildings towered above us and encroached upon the street. We made another turn and started down a larger main road. A large circular building stood in the center of a square on the left and just beyond that, Colin pulled his van into a parking spot. He looked at us and proudly proclaimed, \"We're 'ere. Exeter College.\" THIS STORY HAS MOVED TO FICTIONPRESS UNDER THE TITLE \"THE OXFORD CROWN\" ","Summary":" My hair was frozen. Literally frozen.

Captain says he's actually going to take me hunting! I've been in the woods almost every day so it's pretty easy to stick near him, giddily running around his feet. He pretty much ignores me and I'm quick enough to not get kicked accidentally. He smells amused. Then we reach a new section of the woods. He's never brought me here before and its really deep. We see some of the rabbits jumping around and I growl and he tells me to calm down. He sits down in his den tree house thingie, legs hanging off the edge, and I jump in after him. It's really big to fit just him. I snuffle through the blankets that are inside. Everything smells like him and a few things smell faintly like Suzi. Suzi's been here? No. She just got the blankets for me. I jump down from the den and start sniffing things in the woods. I want to be able to find my way back here when we leave. Captain starts taking off clothes, setting them carefully off to the side. He has to get out to take off his trousers. Come here. Obediently, I stop sniffing the pile of bones and trot back over. He pats the floor of the den, and I jump up and sit, watching him eagerly. Are we hunting now? In a moment. He still smells amused. Do you remember what I told you? If I think you're going to eat me I should run for the bar I recite in almost a singsong. As if Captain would ever eat me. He gives an affirmative grunt. Now stay there. This will only take a moment. What will I want to ask but Captain groans and doubles over. Oh, he's changing! I prick my ears forward and watch and wow it really is fast. And he's so very big now and has proper ears and about as much fur as I do and wow. Sir? His head turns towards me, ears pricked forward and mouth shut. I pin my ears back and roll over, head hanging off the platform a bit. Captain only has to duck a little bit to fit his head in the den and I feel his breath on my neck. I hold really, really still and a little whine escapes from me. Then his nose is in my ear, breath tickling. Sir! I laugh, flipping over and trying to get away, but Captain still has hands and catches me easily. He licks at my head and when I try to get away again, he digs his claws in a bit. I stop struggling and drop my head to the floor with a sigh. Captain laughs a little and finally lets me up. I jump out of the den and shake myself off and Captain stands up all the way and stretches. He sniffs at the wind and I sniff too, but I don't know what I'm looking for. Then he throws his head back and howls and its something else I've never done with him. I try to join in, but I'm a little warbley and Captain's laughing again by the time we stop. Are we hunting now? I am. You don't know how. I whine in protest and Captain huffs at me. But you said I could come! You can watch and learn, but you're too small to help. I whine a little anyway, but Captain's running and I need all my breath to keep up. He stops just as suddenly, ears pricked forward, mouth closed. What is it? I pant. Quiet. Watch. Captain creeps forward slowly and I sniff the air. Oh, petrol, yuck. Are we really going to eat a rabbit? But I'm quiet and I watch. The rabbit doesn't seem to know we're here and Captain's so silent when he moves that it just keeps browsing in what little grass there is. Then it freezes and Captain freezes and I freeze and we all just wait to see who will make the first move. I break first, dashing forward and barking like a mad thing and the rabbit hisses and bolts and something hits me in the back of the head and sends me sprawling. Moron. Captain's growling. I roll on to my back as soon as I can tell which way is up. Sorrysorrysorrysorrysorry! His teeth are vibrating at my throat, but he pulls back again with a huff. Maybe you're too young for this. No! I can listen! I can be quiet! I promise! Captain looks at me and I drop my gaze and look away. Not another sound until I say so, understood? I shake my tail yes and then we're moving again, Captain following some scent I don't know how to recognize. Then he stops and I stop and peer out between his legs at the deer until he crouches low. Not a sound, he warns me, showing teeth, and stay here. One hand reaches out to press me into the dirt and once he's certain I'm not getting up, he creeps forward silently. I don't even lift my head from the ground, but my ears are pricked forward and I'm watching with wide eyes. He's so close now the deer has to know he's there, how can it not? It freezes, head still down and Captain freezes three strides away from it and my head comes up and I almost bark but don't. The deer's head comes up the same moment Captain leaps forward and I'm quivering to stay still as Captain catches it with one clawed hand hooked into its flank. It tries to kick at him and he jerks back his claws coming free and leaving a huge bloody hole behind. The deer takes off and Captain licks his claws clean as I stand and trot over to him. It got away, I grumble. I'm starting to get hungry. No, it didn't. What do you smell? I sniff. Blood? Good. We're going to follow that. Come along. It takes a long time to catch up to the deer, but when we do, it's too tired and lost too much blood to run anymore. It just watches Captain as he walks up to it and I watch as he kills it. It's quick, and he's eating in the next moment. I walk up to eat myself, but Captain growls at me to stay back. Confused, I back off but I'm too hungry to stay away for long. I pin my ears back and drop to the ground, crawling towards the hole in its flank. Captain eyes me but I'm careful not to look back and he lets me in to eat. I'm full long before he is, though, and I lay down nearby and doze while he finishes eating. I wake up to his tongue licking me clean again. Come on, time to go home. Captain has what little's left of the deer in one hand and is steadying his crouch with the other. 'kay. I stretch and get to my feet, following him back to the den. I'm asleep on my paws by the time we get back. Captain drops the deer on the pile of bones and climbs into the den, curling up on the blankets. I lay down on the ground, already falling asleep. What are you doing? Going to sleep, sir. He tilts his head at me and I can smell his amusement again. You can come in here. I'm too tired to even be excited about this. I crawl in next to him and he curls up around me and we sleep. I only wake up when morning comes and he changes back around me, but Captain just wakes up enough to pull the blankets over both of us.

He was trapped as they were trapped. The demons appreciated this about as much as he did. \"What's all that racket!\" yelled the old fat jailkeeper, throwing open the door and stomping into the aisle.

Sweat broke out in tiny beads all across her forehead. 6 months, 3 weeks, 5 days. Shots of electricity coursed throughout her nerves, constricting the muscles and quickening her heart. 6 months, 3 weeks, 5 days. Ragged gasps escaped as her body contorted in spasms. Hands grasped at nothing as she tried to drag herself across the floor to anywhere. It didn't matter where as long as the pain that ripped through her body would just stop! 6 months, 3 weeks, 5 days. Tears leaked out leaving wet tracks on her cheeks, and she finally relented and gave up as she always did. One final spasm caused her back to arch painfully once more before throwing her head back towards the heavens, her yellow eyes looking up in anguish before closing as the rest of the transformation happened. 6 months, 3 weeks, 5 days. High-pitched whimpers filled the room, and Sam came over as he always did after this part to nuzzle her face, offering comfort in his own way. She nosed him back before staggering to an upright position. Her eyes glinted in the darkened room, taking in the destruction yet again. Growling fiercely she stormed over to the window and tore the curtains aside, dislodging the curtain rod as well as a few wood splinters. Again. The waxen moon's glow poured into the room as if to mock her yet again, and the pupils of her eyes narrowed to slits. Sounds amplified, the color spectrums of the night more intense, and it wasn't long until a long, mournful call pierced the air. She resisted the urge to leave as more calls answered the first, not wanting to leave her safe haven. Yet she knew she could only ignore them for so long before they would come and retrieve her themselves and stalked over to the door. Sam made to follow her as she wrenched the door open, but she raised a hand, effectively stopping him in his tracks. A soft cry rose from his throat in protest, but he sat back down on his haunches. One more glance in his direction made it clear to him that he was going to stay put and wait until she came back. Again. Her thoughts echoed what was so plaintively obvious in her faithful friend's eyes. I'm sorry; this isn't what I want either. She emerged from the dark recess of her house into the glittering moonlight. Her nose detected the scents of the others just north of here, and she lowered to all fours before pushing off into a powerful sprint until she was deep within the forest. Eyes darting to the left, she saw the larger, darker form of Leod coming up on her flank. Barring her teeth, she snapped at him when he came a little too close for comfort. Leod snorted in derision before motioning his head to the right. The glow of a campfire could barely be seen through the dense brush, and it wouldn't be long until she and the others would slink through the edge of the forest into the highlands where an unfortunate group of campers had hunkered down for the night. She always hated this part, and no matter how horrible she felt for not being able to ignore the urges, she knew that it was going to be even worse for those that made the horrible decision to come to these parts on a night like this – not that they would know any better. Her thoughts soured causing a bitter taste in her mouth. Then again, it really was the wrong time of the month. 2 years, 5 months, 7 days. The carnage was something she could never get over; the bloodlust was even worse. That metallic, bitter taste forever invaded her senses and coated everything around her. 2 years, 5 months, 7 days. Her camera lay practically forgotten in the back room of her house. What use was it for her now? And besides, she had gotten sick of Leod following her around whenever she tried to do any type of outdoor photography. Even small observations were out of the question! Hadn't he gotten it by now that she cursed his very existence and wanted nothing more to do with him? 2 years, 5 months, 7 days. She tried ending it all a few times. Each time was a total and utter failure as she would watch her skin knit back together, leaving shiny pink scars that appeared to mock her. It was rather laughable, and that invaded all the dark thoughts that she tried in vain to keep buried deep within the depths of her subconscious. Yet they still managed to bubble up, resentment and anger churning within her stomach and causing her throat to tighten. She did not ask for this! She may love the seclusion of the outdoors and could (and had a few times) get lost for days just taking in the sights and smells of the surrounding nature, but all that seemed hollow and meaningless to her now. She just wanted to go back to the way things were before this all happened, before she knew there was a perfectly imperfect color between indigo and violet. 5 years, 2 months, 6 Days Damn him! Damn them all! She continued to run even though her sides were convulsing with exhaustion. Those rotten, no good…she couldn't even finish the thought. Eventually her legs gave way and she collapsed to the ground, panting hard from her exertions. She eventually curled up underneath a haven of branches from tree that looked like it was about to fall over any minute. Perhaps it would fall and crush her – she had crumbled down on the inside over the years, her outward physique might as well match. She continued to lay there under the tree, numb to the sensation of her limbs as they shortened and the joints bent back into their normal position. The air caused goose-bumps to erupt as fur melted back into her skin, until it was just her laying in a fetal position. One with nature indeed; well, she got what she wanted, right? She thought darkly. She could have almost chuckled at the irony, but she was too exhausted to fully care. Sleep eventually crept up and took over, and she resigned herself to nightmares full of carnage and blood of her own design. She awoke fairly early, the predawn light a muted grey. She sat up, drawing her knees in close thinking back to the previous evening. Leod (again) tried to win her affections and a well-placed smack across his muzzle caused quite a scene. She couldn't help but smirk at the memory of four angry red lines welling up, and oh the howling that had arose! She was actually quite surprised that he hadn't lost an eye – not that she was really aiming for it and would deny it if it was ever brought up. Anger swirled to the surface again. Why did these people feel that she should be grateful to them? It wasn't like she asked for…well, this! Isolation, sure. Submersing herself deep within nature, definitely. Becoming this horrible, murderous monster? Never. She sniffed loudly trying to quell the tears that were gathering defiantly in her eyes. Her thoughts continued to wander until the sun made its presence just over the treetops and the lonely thought of Sam needing to be feed forced her to her feet. Turning until she was facing to what she believed to be north, she lumbered back in the general direction of her home, trying to work out the stiffness of her limbs and kinks in her joints from last night's activities. Fall crept into existence like it did every year. The only difference was the people that came and went; mostly coming and never getting the chance to leave again. Sam was still bouncing like always, but without the youthful air of a puppy. She could only guess as to why Sam's energy lasted so long in to what was well past the normal age for dogs. She had lost track of the years as they passed. Was it ten? Twenty? Forty-Five? She neither the will nor the energy to try and calculate the passage of time anymore. Each day bled into the next with little reprieve, and she hadn't even bothered trying to figure out how many moons came and went forcing its supernatural glow upon her form when at its most waxen. She and the family had fallen into an unspoken, awkward agreement – she wasn't forced to take part in their bloodlust as long as one of them could come and check in on her periodically. She had tried to argue for once a month, but that had fallen on deaf ears and she didn't have the fight left in her to push the issue. Leod (grudgingly) stopped with his advances, but that didn't stop the hungry, borderline predatory look in his eyes whenever it was his turn to call upon her. In a way, she supposed she should be thankful that anyone came to check in on her at all. As messed up as a family dynamic it was, she was still a part of it. The only one she didn't mind dropping by was Martha. Martha was caring in her own way, never one to force any kind of small talk (if any). She would knock lightly on the door a couple times before letting herself in and marching straight to the kitchen to set the tea kettle on the hardy wood stove to boil. Martha took her tea with two lumps of sugar and more milk than actual tea, and it was a wonder she wasn't more energetic because of the sugary drink. They would sit together in companionable silence outside on the porch when the weather was cooperative enough, and there would be a few times – though rare – that the two women would speak about mundane topics. Martha would take her time with her tea, and once she finished the last dregs, she would take the cup back into the kitchen to wash and hang it back up in its proper place before leaving the cabin altogether without so much as a by your leave. She had cried in front of Martha one time. Not the gut-wrenching sobs that had been a part of her many emotional outbursts while along with Sam, but the bitter silent kind that you don't even realize is occurring until you discover the salty wetness on your cheeks. She didn't know for how long she had cried or why it even happened, yet there was Martha smoothing back her dark hair, offering her own form of comfort as the tears tracked down her face and neck into the collar of her jacket. Martha said nothing during this episode and had forgone the washing of her teacup that day; perhaps she thought it would be something to help her take her mind off whatever sorrow had enveloped her that day. Whatever the reason, Martha had never mentioned anything regarding this particular visit again. Despite everything else a comfortable routine had fallen into place. Even if there were still misgivings on her end, she was at least grateful for the times that Martha came to visit. It was the one bit of normalcy in her life aside from Sam and she would soak it up and lock it to memory while she could. \"Of all things dear, my soul, I swear, in death shall not forsake thee.\" She whispered a line she had said so long ago once more before smiling ruefully to herself and starting another day.

Hell, it had been a surprise to wake up at all. After running into that... thing in the woods, he thought he was binned for sure. But at the time, with the wolves at the door and Kirkley's life at stake, he hadn't really been thinking about it. And he'd been up and about since then—he'd had to be. For now, Wells decided he would count his blessings. If nothing else, it kept him from counting hours, counting bullets, or counting the dwindling numbers of his men. The pain was less than he would have expected. More than he could ignore, but it was really only the knowledge that glue was all that kept him from unraveling like an old sweater which rooted him in his seat when he felt like pacing. He forced himself to be content with letting Cooper handle the situation. And he knew he could trust Cooper with the welfare of his squad, but... Damned if sitting still wasn't beginning to make him a bit restless. Ryan's calm demeanor wasn't helping that, either. The captain sat in his seat at the table, an expression of smug disinterest painted across his face. Wells remembered the way the man had looked when they'd found him out in the woods. Half dead would, not to put to fine a point on it, have been a massively fucking generous assessment. Yet now he just sat there, calm as you please. As though he'd been invited to dinner and hadn't spent most of the evening tied to a bloody chair. Wells had lost three of his men. Ryan had lost his entire team . And he was just sitting there. It wasn't fucking right . Wells had kept quiet through most of Cooper's questioning, eyes on the table as he attempted to ride out the pain. He'd only looked up once it seemed Ryan was through with fucking them around and willing to give some sort of answers for this damned mess. As Ryan spoke, Wells felt himself becoming increasingly agitated. It seemed as though all the scattered pieces were finally starting to fall together. He hated to admit that bastard could be right about anything, but he sure as shit didn't like the picture he was starting to see. And as the smug, dirty fucker locked on to him with the coldest eyes he'd seen in a good long while—gaze accusing Wells of the deaths of his men, accusing him of failure, of weakness— he'd had to look away. Only it wasn't what he'd found in the Captain's eyes from which he forced himself to hide—it was what he felt looking back from his own. Because he had every right to be angry, but he shouldn't be this angry. He shouldn't be inches away from forgetting himself. That thrilling surge that swept through him when Cooper had his knife at Ryan's throat... That's not who he is, but, God, some part of him just wanted so desperately to see the man's blood spilled . And as Captain Ryan sat there, outlining in that gloating tone how easily the bastard had signed off on the deaths of his men, something inside Wells broke. He was out of his chair before he even knew, fist introducing itself savagely to Ryan's smirking face. The pain in his gut receded to a dull ache, his awareness all rage and thrumming blood and the crackle of the fireplace gunfire-loud in his ears. The air in the room seemed to press in on him, heavy and hot from all sides, the evaporation of sweat leaving the sergeant's skin feeling taut. \"They were my men!\" Bruce, Terry, Joe. His men. His... With Ryan down his limbs shook shaking from the effort it took not to follow through and make sure he'd never get up again. And thank God Cooper was there, yanking the fucker to attention before he had the chance to lose that battle. But then— Jesus Christ. His eyes. Ryan's fucking eyes . \"Live and learn, Cooper.\" The pattern of his thoughts had turned high and incoherent by the time Cooper had thrown the fucker. Every panicked attempt at understanding this whole fucking mess halted woefully short of success, and at this point the words coming out of his own mouth don't make sense even to him. \"Whoa... I didn't hit him that hard.\" \"You shook something loose...\" There hadn't been a lot of time after he'd woken up for Cooper and the others to convince him of Megan's theory of what they were dealing with. He hadn't believed it, then. He couldn't believe what he was seeing , either, but Wells couldn't allow himself to deny that he was seeing it... And his mind latched onto the word, letting it echo hollowly in his head as he finally managed to fucking get it. Werewolves. Jesus Christ... Even once Ryan— it was out of sight, there was the screaming and—Jesus—the noises. Noises that seemed to pull on him in some way he couldn't name or understand...a twinge deep in his stomach that had nothing to do with physical pain and which fell damningly short of the horror he knew he should feel. The scuffle immediately afterward happened so quickly that he didn't have to think. It wasn't until the commotion was over that it really began to sink in, the monotonous task of replacing the boards over the window providing a fitting rhythm to the idea as it hammered it's way into his head. Binned . Bang. Binned . Bang. Fucking binned . Bang! Wells worked quietly, letting silence and fear and resignation coat the back of his throat with bile. At the same time, his hands and fingers tingled from adrenaline. It made him giddy in a way he didn't trust, and he had the itching feeling that it wasn't going to ebb away any time soon. The high still hadn't worn off by the time he was finished and Cooper had fit another piece to the puzzle. \"But they're good people,\" Megan protested, following Cooper's intent gaze at the family photo from the mantle. \"They're kind people.\" Looking at the smiling faces in that picture Wells could almost believe it. He could imagine them going about their very normal lives, imagine the man in that photo kissing his wife goodnight twenty-nine out of every thirty if that was how it worked. His fingers closed around the hammer so tightly his joins creaked. \"More's the pity.\" Cooper said, though he didn't seem too broken up about it. Wells figured the young private was probably a lot more practical than Ryan had given him credit. \"Why?\" \"'Cause we're doing to have to kill them all.\" \"Too right, mate.\" Wells agreed hoarsely, letting hammer fall. The impact webbed the glass with fractures, hiding the smiling faces from sight. He wasn't a fool. He knew what lay in store for him, that he'd dropped the gavel on his own sentence as well. But he wasn't about to show an ounce of pity to these things. He hoped that, when his time came, someone would be prepared to return the favor. But before then, he would do all that he could to see the surviving members of his pack out of this safe. ","Summary":" It was a miracle he got down the fucking stairs in the first place.

Almost…there we go! The shutter clicked audibly, breaking the silence in the cool afternoon light. The chipmunk's eyes blinked before darting off into the underbrush, its previous route soon forgotten. She smiled lightly, pausing to let the camera rest against her breast to reach her arms up into a long, slow stretch before returning to her vigil. Exhaling shortly in slight exasperation, she couldn't help but wonder if she was going to see more than the obnoxiously cute rodents that seemed to amass themselves in little groups today. This was an area known for rather…unique activity among the wolves, and she wanted nothing more than to try and capture them in their own habitat. Bloody chipmunks… A quick glance heavenward indicated that it was probably about time to pack up her rather crude hiding spot and head back to the house, but she was nothing but determined to try and catch the elusive wolves that she so often heard about. Whatever they were, they were certainly larger than your average wolf and there was no concrete proof to even help identify whether they were just a large cousin to the common grey wolf or something new entirely. This beast was crafty, that much was true. Aside from rather grisly scenes of blood and other matter in the woods around the full moon, there was nothing to really pinpoint that these wolves were even around. Honestly, they could be right under her nose and she wouldn't even know it. With the light fading, all those warnings that were repeated ad infinitum about not staying out after dusk were squashed rather far back into the back of her mind. After all, it wasn't like it was completely dark yet. There's still plenty of time to get back. A loud snuffling took her by surprise and she tensed trying to keep as still as possible. Inwardly she chastised herself for not having her camera at the ready as her hands were currently helping her stay still by clenching deep into the earth. A stick broke somewhere to her left with a loud crack. Stealthily she raised one hand to grasp the body of the camera hanging around her neck before cautiously bringing the other up to its place around the lens. The snuffling slid around behind her before stopping altogether. Wincing as the underbrush beneath her feet rustled as she shifted in a slow circle, she only just got the camera up to eye level before being jumped by a large, wiggling, black and white ball of fur. The camera flashed as the dog tackled her to the ground and began to lick her face. \"Ooff! Sam!\" She yelped while trying to push the dog's face away. Only a couple seconds passed before she wrestled the dog off of her and attempted to calm the excited pup down. \"I hope you weren't getting into too much trouble you rascal.\" She said affectionately while mussing with Sam's ears. She was met by a few more doggy kisses in response. Chuckling lightly, and with one last pat, she hastened to get all of her equipment together. Night was beginning to fall and she knew that the light from the waning moon wasn't exactly going to keep everything well-lit. While she was sure that this last ambush by Sam had certainly scared off whatever quarry she was after, she didn't really want to be caught walking in the dark. Once everything was stowed away in its proper place, the trek back to the house began. Normally this was quite an easy walk, but with the growing nightfall it seemed much longer and, dare she say, ominous. Dirt crunched beneath her boots and she absentmindedly brushed her hair off the back of her neck. She breathed in the night air as a slow smile stretched across her face. Sam lopped off ahead of her blissfully unaware of his surroundings as home came into view. It wasn't until camera and rucksack were safely stowed away into the jeep that she realized how still everything seemed at the moment. Come to think of it, it was rather quiet. Sam. Without a second thought she broke through the brush surrounding her home whistling and calling out to the dog. To her consternation and growing fear, there was no sound. No snuffling. No flurry of black and white charging at her. Stomach clenching, she pressed on further into the wooded area, ignoring that it was now quite late. If not for the waning moon, she would have felt like she was part of some cliché scene in a horror movie. Those always had full moons, right? These deluding thoughts did nothing to ease the apprehension that was currently causing her nerves to tighten painfully. If anything, fear was coiling deeper and deeper within the pit of her stomach. Her head whipped back and forth as she searched in vain for Sam, her movements becoming more and more frantic when there was no sign of her furry friend. She stumbled out into a clearing, pausing to catch her breath and make attempts to stop her heart from beating right out of her chest. Subconsciously she raised a hand to the base of her throat, her fingers pulsing lightly against her skin as if to help slow down the rapid beating coursing through her veins. A soft whimper, more like a pitiful whine, caused her head to whip up before turning to where the noise was originating. \"Sam?\" She called out tentatively, voice slightly hoarse from the excursion through the wooded glen. The moonlight fell upon a shadowy form amongst the overgrown flora, curled up so tightly she almost couldn't tell that it was even there. It was shivering rather violently, and she approached the form slowly, each footstep feeling like lead as it thudded against the soft ground. She started, a high pitched squeak hitching somewhere in her throat, the sound barely passing through her lips as the figure raised its head up suddenly. She was all too aware of the set of bright, sickly yellow eyes boring back into her own. Sam had brown eyes. The figure…animal…well, she wasn't even sure what it was, but she knew it was nothing like she had ever seen before, just continued to stare at her. The whimpering stopped, heavy breathing that sounded more like panting, striking through the air in staccato notes. A small movement fluttered to her right, her eyes moving to fall upon Sam; stupid, dumb, wonderful Sam. Poor Sam was shaking, trying to make himself as small as possible while looking towards her with his wide, beautiful brown eyes. It wasn't until she realized Sam was looking past her that she realized that the sharp panting had stopped altogether, and a barely noticeable growl was rumbling forth from the shadowed figure lying in front of her. She stumbled back, struggling to keep her footing even as the animalistic growling grew louder ever so slightly. The form uncurled onto all fours, and part of her thought that she was looking at a Wulver, only this one certainly did not look friendly nor did it look like all it wanted to do was fish from Wulver's Stane. She almost laughed out loud at thinking about a silly fairy tale while she was very clearly in trouble. Before anything more could happen, the beast howled out in pain, and there was Sam clawing and biting at the strange creature's indiscernible face and neck. It fell back crying out in pain, and for a moment she could have sworn that it sounded almost human. Snapping back from her thoughts, she turned, flailing about like a frightened child before willing her feet to run. She cried out as she watched the ground rushing towards her, air whooshing out of her lungs as she made impact. Claws pierced through the denim of her pants as fingers curled tighter about the bottom of her leg. Wait, fingers? Fight or flight took over every single sense in her body and she started kicking about wildly before she felt her foot connect with something hard. The grip on her leg loosened as the beast howled in pain. Sam practically flew in a black and white streak away from the creature and out of the glen, and she wasn't too far behind him. The pair crashed clumsily about the wood, surely scaring off any other creatures of the night before coming to a stop by a stream, pausing to see if they had been followed. Thankfully there was no hide or hair to be seen of the creature anomaly they had just encountered. Flopping down by the babbling water, she reached for Sam and hugged him close, sucking air into her lungs as she stroked her fingers through his furry coat to check for injuries as well as calm the dumb, brave dog down. \"Oh Sam, what am I going to do with you,\" she huffed out as she cuddled him closer, \"this time you really did it; I'm just glad nothing worse happened.\" All Sam did was nuzzle her cheek before hunkering down by her side as she continued to stroke the dog. Satisfied that she found no wounds, she set about taking care of her leg. She groaned as she took note of the damage done to her pants and proceeded to roll up the fabric to take a better look at what that…thing, did to her. The skin was already mottled an unsightly purple where the beast's fingers took hold, and thin, angry red lines where the claws had pierced into her flesh. She cupped her hand, dipped it into the water and poured it over her wound before rubbing against her skin briskly trying to clean it. After doing this a couple times, she paused to take stock in the recent events and for her breathing to finally come back to normal. Sweat prickled about her neck, and fatigue rushed through her body as the adrenaline from earlier dwindled into nothing. \" Tis night! Tis night! And the moon shines white over pine and snow capped hill. The shadows stray through burn and brae and dance in the sparkling rill.\" Her ears perked up as she looked about. If she didn't know any better, she would have thought the fae folk were playing tricks on her. Brushing aside the whispery words, she rolled her neck about to relieve the tension in her shoulders. \"Fae folk indeed.\" She scoffed. If she didn't watch herself, she would soon believe in all the legends of the Scots. Words that were just a little louder than a whisper this time tickled her ear. \" Tis night! Tis night! And the devil's light casts glimmering beams around. The maras dance, the nisses prance on the flower enameled ground.\" Narrowing her eyes, she glared about the wood. The moon was at its highest point in the sky, its light filling up every nook and cranny of the forest and causing the water to sparkle. In fact, the water never looked more enticing than it did at that moment. \" Tis night! Tis night! And the werewolf's might makes man and nature shiver. Yet its fierce grey head and stealthy tread are nought to thee, oh river!\" She reached out a hand towards the water, her fingers breaking through the crystalline surface as she swirled her hand through the currents. Her face flushed with heat as her heart rate finally drummed at a normal pace, and she realized just how hot she was from her recent sprinting. \"River, River, River, oh water strong, that swirls along…\" she whispered, the words falling from her lips, flowing through the air like the water in the stream. She didn't realize she was crying until she felt the hot tears running freely down her cheeks, and laughter choked her throat as she came to grips with her encounter with the unknown beast. Clutching her hands about her shoulders as if to offer some form of self comfort, she rocked back and forth before doubling over onto her knees, her forehead striking against the muddy shores once, twice, three times before stopping altogether. Ragged sobs escaped as Sam pressed against her, his rough tongue licking away her tears as they escaped in hopes of trying to offer his own type of comfort to her. The sobs eventually slowed, and she sat up slowly, shaking her head to get rid of the fogginess that had crept in during her episode. She scrubbed at her eyes fiercely before moving towards the stream and dunking her head into the water to help clear it. She swallowed a mouthful of the wonderful liquid before pulling her head out the water. She relished in the cool water coursing down her throat and dripping down her face into her collar before dunking her head back into the stream. She let the water flow past as it calmed her nerves down a bit before taking another drink and settling back onto her knees. Sam cocked his head to the side as he watched this seemingly mundane ritual, and as confused as the pup looked, he seemed to come to the decision that as long as his master was okay, then he could relax his guard. Dunking her head back into the stream for a third time, she paused to drink in the heady flow a bit deeper before pulling back. Wringing the last of the water from her hair, she flopped back onto the ground allowing it to cradle her tired form. Closing her eyes, she lay for what seemed like mere minutes before sitting up to see Sam gazing about the trees surrounding the area, his floppy ears twitching at every noise that filtered through the night sky. Looking up towards the moon, she noticed that the moon had dropped significantly in the sky. Her brow furrowed. Hmm…must not have noticed how much time had passed due to all the excitement. Putting the thought behind her, she drew her legs close in order to inspect her cuts for any rising infection. To her astonishment, there were no more lines marring the surface of her skin, and the bruises that had bloomed were no more. Had she imagined it all? Energy surged through her veins as her brain tried to rationalize everything that had transpired the last few hours. Sam immediately went to her side as she rose up from her safe haven near the stream. He nudged his nose against her hand before bumping his head against it begging for his head to be scratched. She complied as her thoughts came to order before realizing that she and Sam were most likely hopelessly lost. Exhaling loudly, she turned about trying to get her bearings. She sniffed about the air noticing smells she couldn't recall before. She noticed colours in the waning moonlight that normally wouldn't be seen, but she chalked it up to her frazzled nerves and lack of sleep. She patted the side of her thigh to let Sam know they were heading out to make the trek back towards to where she thought home was. The path seemed to wind about more in this part of the woods, normally making navigation quite difficult. However, she seemed to have no problem, allowing instinct to take over as her brain was just too wired and mentally exhausted to do anything else but wander. The night began to wane, the sky fading from the navy blues and purples to dusty roses and pale oranges. As if by magic, the path opened up and the sight of the familiar jeep bolstered their strength and both practically ran the last few meters to the welcome surroundings of their home. Practically bolting up the few steps of the porch to the front door with Sam at her heels, the sight of her neighbor seated on the wooden bench caused her to skid to a stop with a yelp. Poor Sam didn't account for the sudden change of speed and crashed into the back of her legs, and had she not had her hand on the doorframe for unexpected support, she most likely would have fallen into a rather ungraceful heap at her neighbor's feet. \"Long night?\" they inquired, fiddling with the glasses perched upon their nose. \"Uh, yeah.\" She stammered trying to mentally calm down her heart that was trying to hammer out of her chest, \"I mean, no! No, we just got back from a…a morning ramble through the woods nearby.\" She could almost feel her neighbor's thoughts as they looked pointedly at her ruined pants before running their eyes up and down the rest of her ragged appearance. Fighting the urge to straighten her clothing and smooth down her hair, she raised her chin up ever so slightly as if to dare them to counter what was so obviously a lie. After a moment, they readjusted the glasses on their nose before getting up, brushing the nonexistent dirt off their lap, and peering back into her face. \"It'll get harder next month. Though to be fair, I think you'll have even better luck pushing off any….advances next time.\" Came the semi-cryptic warning. \"Excuse me, what do you mean by advances?\" The very idea! She actually scoffed, not caring for the kindly, if somewhat pretentious, one's attempt at riddles. She was there to study that which was around her, the very nature of the forest itself. The thought that anyone or any…thing…would try to make a pass at her was just ludicrous. \"They didn't mean any harm last night. However, I did warn you that it was dangerous to go out at night.\" They looked pointedly at her as they spoke. She froze. That was not possible. How did they know? The ground seemed to be sinking around her; everything was out of focus except for her neighbor's lips. \"Never understood your fascination with the comings and goings of the particular Canis lupus around here; perhaps maybe you will have a better understanding soon.\" No. \" I prithee a werewolf make me…\" No. \"After all, we are all just one big family out here.\" No! \"You'll find in time that everything will become easier.\" \"NO!\" She screamed, pressing her arms against her side to control the shaking she was not aware that started during this whole interlude. The air seemed to rush past her ears, combining with the blood pumping within causing such a deafening roar that anything else the well meaning neighbor said after that was not heard. Her shoulders slumped in defeat, realizing just what exactly was happening to her by what wasn't being said. She wasn't sure when her neighbor left, but it didn't matter to her anymore. This wasn't fair! Sure, she came out here because she wanted to become one with nature, to understand it more, to catalogue her findings, and fall off the face of the earth for awhile. Well, it looked like she was going to fall off the grid permanently. Gritting her teeth, she raised her head and looked towards the sun as it continued its climb, the dusty pinks and peaches of the sky having faded into a variety of blues, pastels, and colors she didn't even have names for. Sam rested against her leg as she allowed thoughts of pity, regret, and things she knew would come to pass to wash over her. \"Of all things dear, my soul, I swear, in death shall not forsake thee.\" She whispered before turning towards her home to begin the first day of the rest of her life.

This one is for May 3 and the theme was 'e lanchiamano estate!' (and they call it summer) . Maybe whatnMeg was thinking in that scene where she's looking out the windows nin that glazed kind of way. She couldn'tnbelieve it was this cold already. The night had barely fallen, andnthe chill had set in. The dew and damp wasn't a frost yet, sontechnically it was still summer, but still she and the soldiers werengoose-bumped and breathing clouds of vapor. If she hadn't beennas used to this countryside, she would've been amazed. The familynin the cottage had laughed at her too at first. She was used to itnnow, but still aware of the extremes. Now instead of making hernuncomfortable, the cold, wet air was refreshing on her skin. She hadnshed her coat and sweater to feel it better, and was almost temptednto pull off the sleeveless undershirt. There was no tellingnhow that would affect her at this point though. And the poor soldiersnhad enough on their minds without her throwing them off with hernfeminine powers. That thought brought a reluctant, if somewhatnpredatory, twitch of a smile. The moon lit thenhaze up as silver as if it was frost, but she could still smell thengreen and flowers behind it. \"Moon-silverninstead of winter-silver,\" she said aloud, looking out the windownat the shadows moving silently in the woods. Her voice was faint andndreamy. She hadn't meant to speak out loud and was hardly aware shenhad until a growl made her jump. \"I'd rather havensome bullet-silver,\" the nearest soldier said. She turned to seenhim studying her carefully. What was he thinking? Did he suspect ornwas it her thin undershirt that had his attention? Either way, shenwas unnerved and looked back out the window again. It took a fewnmoments before she was sure she had herself under control again. Outside, the shadowsnhad grown still again. She saw their eyes light up from the darkness,nsilver also, two tiny moons in each face under the true moon. One waynor the other, this would be over by morning.

Back at the palace Eddie helped Paige out of the car. Her stomach still hurting the push. Zoren standing at the main entrance waiting for them. 'Your Highness how are you feeling?' ' I'm fine Zoren. Thank you for asking.' Paige replied happily. Walking ever so carefully to her and Eddie's room. Paige sat on the bed trying to figure out what to do next. 'Eddie I think its time to tell the country about the pregnancy.' Paige said. Eddie looked at her with a look of agreement 'Ok I agree with any decision that you make… I'm just glad that you and our baby are ok. Now rest please I need you strong and healthy for the baby.' Eddie laid with Paige for a while to reassure her that everything is going to be ok. Eddie was stroking Paige's long blond curls when their was a knock at their chamber door. Eddie gently putting Paige's head on the bed trying not to wake her. Eddie grabbed his robe and went to the door. It was Zoren 'Your Highness its almost time for the press conference sir.'

The room went silent for a split second the a reporter in the front asked ' how far are you?' Paige said with joy 'Three months.'

After the press conference Paige called her parents and told them the whole story. They were so exited for them.[Chapter 2] Thank you so much for the reviews. They make me feel really good that someone is really reading them. Chapter 2 A month had gone by since Eddie and Paige told the whole world about the pregnancy. Paige started showing more and her cloths just started not fitting. Right now they are sitting in the car on their way to their 18 week appointment. Eddie had his arm around Paige's shoulder and rested his hand on Paige's belly. Paige felt something very strange like butterflies going on in her stomach. When they got to the doctor they got their before the paparazzi got their. \"Morning Doctor!\" said Edvard and Paige happily. \"How are you too doing this fine morning.\" asked the Doctor. \"Fine\" said Edvard and Paige. \"Now hop on the table now Paige and lets see what your baby is up too. Shall we?\" ask the doctor. \"would you like to know if your baby is a boy or a girl?\" Paige and Edvard thought about it for a while and Said \" Sure why not!\" Doctor said with joy in his voice \"you are having a girl!\" Paige and Eddie were so surprised. Eddie kissed Paige on her forehead because he was so happy. After the sonogram Paige pulled down her shirt and Eddie pulled Paige on his lap. The doctor went to get the sonogram pictures Eddie was stroking Paige's hair. \"Paige I'm so proud of you everyday! Thank you for being my wonderful wife and being on this crazy journey with me.\" says Eddie with a giant smile on his face. They scheduled Paige's next appointment and snuck out the back of the building so they don't get spotted by the paparazzi. Back at the palace Zoren was waiting for them at them with a letter for Paige. \"Paige I have a letter for you from your High school.\" aforesaid Zoren. \"Let me see Zoren. Its been 5 years already!\" Said Paige surprisingly. \"What is it Paige?\" asked Eddie puzzle. \"The letter is from my high school. Its for my 5 year high school reunion. I forgot all about it.\" aforesaid Paige. Eddie asked still confused \" when is your high school reunion?\" \" 3 weeks from today and in Wisconsin.\" Paige said. \"Ooohhh! Well we could still go.\" said Eddie. Paige was so surprised when she heard Eddie say that she ran as fast as you can into Eddie's arms and kissed him over and over again.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 3 Weeks later… Eddie and Paige were on their private jet to Wisconsin for Paige's 5 year high school reunion. Paige fell a sleep in Eddie's arms. When they landed in Wisconsin Eddie kissed Paige on her head to wake her up. \"Darling we are here.\" said Eddie. Paige rubbing her and asked\" really? Is their any paparazzi outside?\" \"No I don't think so.\" Eddie aforesaid. Paige got up fixed her shirt and looked through the window and did not see the paparazzi anywhere. They got out of the limo and into their car and went to Paige's parents house. In the car Paige fell asleep in Eddie's arms. Eddie was stroking Paige's beautiful blond locks when the car stopped in front of Paige's parents house. He woke up Paige with a passionate kiss on the lips. When they got to the door her mom answered. She helped with their bags and got them inside before anyone recognized them as King and Queen of Denmark. \" How have you too been since we last saw you?\" asked Paige's mom. \"Fine.\" said Paige and Eddie. \" Mom do you Know who is going to the reunion?\" asked Paige \"I know that Hailey, Quinn, Mary, Jim, Kurt, Rachel, and Melisa are going but I don't know who else.\" said her mom. \"Also Brook, Jasmine, and Erica.\" aforesaid Paige's mom. \"No not Brook, Jasmine, and Erica.\" Paige said with hate in her voice. \"Who is Brook, Jasmine, and Erica?\" asked Eddie[Chapter 4] During the holiday break I will try to publish more chapters. Thank you for all the wonderful comments. Chapter 4 \"Brook, Jasmine, and Erica are Paige's version of Mean Girls.\" aforesaid Paige's mom. \"Hey they were awful.\" said Paige \" What do you mean?\" asked Eddie \" Let's see they told the whole school that I was a guy.\" aforesaid Paige. \"That does not sound that bad.\" said Eddie \"NOT THAT BAD…\" said Paige Furious \"Well now that it has been five years you have a better life now as a Queen then they do.\" says Eddie \"Your right I'm sorry for yelling. They did other things that still can't explain today.\" aforesaid Paige Later that day Paige took Eddie to her high school. When they got their they were easily recognized by the staff and students as queen and king of Denmark. Eddie saw all of Paige's hangouts, classes, her hiding places, etc. When they got to the gym to set up Hailey, Quinn, Mary, Jim, Kurt, Rachel, and Melisa were their they were catching up on the last five years. Paige was happy to see and hear that all her friend were doing well. Then Paige introduced Eddie to her friends. But then Paige's happiness went sour when she saw Brook, Jasmine, and Erica. She grabbed Eddie tighter. \" Hi Paige.\" said Brook, Jasmine, and Erica meanly \" Hi Brook, Jasmine, and Erica.\" aforesaid Paige trying to hold back what see really wanted to say. \" Well, Well , Well are little nerd became a Princess. No wait I mean a Queen. Are you the queen of loser vile?\" said Brook \" No she is the Queen of Denmark!\" aforementioned Eddie \" Who are you? You did not go to this school.\" said Brook \" No I'm Paige's husband. Let me guess you are Brook.\" aforementioned Eddie \" Page he really is real. Not a guy you hired for the tabloids. So you are the real King Edvard of Denmark.\" said Brook thinking of an evil plan in her head. Then Brook, Jasmine, and Erica left they said as they were leaving \" See you later losers.\"[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 Back at Paige's mom and dads Paige and Eddie were getting ready to go back to the High School. Paige was wearing a pretty long blue dress with black heels. She had her up in a bun. She was looking at her bump in a long mirror in her old room. Eddie came up behind her in his black blazer, white collared button down shirt, and black dress shoes. \"Whoa you look beautiful as ever.\" aforesaid Eddie putting his hands on Paige's belly. \"Thank you Eddie that makes me feel really amazing inside. Whoa did you feel that?\" asked Paige \"Yea what was that?\" asked Eddie \"I believe that was the baby.\" said Paige Then the car pulled up to take Paige and Eddie to the High school. Paige signed in and got her name tag. Also made one for Eddie they sat at table 8 with Hailey and her boyfriend Nathan, Quinn with her fiancé Matt, and Kurt and Rachel. They sat down and were talking about the last 5 years. Then Brook, Jasmine, and Erica walked in with their boyfriends. \"Please don't leave my side tonight. I don't want to be alone with Brook, Jasmine, and Erica.\" aforesaid Paige nervously. \"Don't worry I won't. Also don't pay attention to what they say they are not the ones that can define who you are. Just remember I love you, and Hailey, Quinn, Mary, Jim, Kurt, Rachel, and Melisa also love you. Really the only way that they will get to you is if you let them.\" said Eddie confident in Paige. Brook, Jasmine, and Erica walked right over to Paige and Eddie. Paige holding on to Eddie a little bit tightly said \" hello Brook, Jasmine, and Erica. Wow you guys look amazing.\" Brook with her plan in mind \" Thank you Paige you look like you did in High School pathetic as usual.\" Eddie holding back Paige from making on the front page of a tabloid aforementioned \" Well how about we go and get something to drink shall we Paige.\"[Chapter 6] Hey! I'm sorry I have not recently uploaded I have had a lot on my plate and now that it is all off I now have time to write again. Chapter 6 Eddie and Paige went to get drinks Eddie turned to Paige and asked \"Are you ok?\" \"Yea. I'm just done with all of this I just thought that Brook changed for the better. But I guess that she is still the same B**** that she was back in High school.\" said Paige trying not to blow up. \" Remember you are strong, intelligent and beautiful and what ever they say you are better than them. Also I love you and they are just jealous of you because you get to live the life that not everyone gets to.\" aforementioned Eddie Eddie kissed Paige and after they got their drinks they went back to their table. After dinner Eddie and Paige were talking to all of Paige's teachers, and friends when Brook got on the stage. \" Everyone I have an announcement to make.\" said Brook with a wicked smirk. \" Our very own Paige has married a King.\" she started This can't be good . Paige thought to herself. The out of nowhere the paparazzi started showing up out side. \" Well now I can't believe that the paparazzi haven't found them already. I mean they are all over the tabloids.\" Brook continued. Paige trying not to react stood with Eddie holding his hand tightly. She wondered the same thing but didn't think much of it. She decided that she will not say anything and that Brook would shut her mouth if she was going to say anything about Paige. Paige did really hate when people talk about her when that person did not really know her at all. Brook saw that Paige did not react to what she had said so she got off the stage thinking of plan B. After the reunion Paige and Eddie went back to her parents house .[Chapter 7] Sorry that I have not posted in a while I had a lot of school stuff going on that I needed to prepare for and school is almost done so yea.

Read his/her Fan Fiction 1 st "},{"Movie":"Prince & Me","Title":"Becoming Royal","Author":"morningglory11","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6968033","Passage":"[Chapter 1] BECOMING ROYAL Nothing in this story belongs to me. This is what I think should have happened after Edvard and Paige kiss in her mom and dad's barn. Chapter 1: The Prince \"Sorry I... think the people around here are getting the wrong idea about... you and me.\" I say looking deep into Eddie's eyes. \"And what idea is that?\" He asked. He had the slight twinkle in his eye and it caused my heart to go into flutters. \"That we're...involved.\" That was the best word I could think of to use that might be appropriate in this situation. But I realize, in that instant, that I did want to be involved with him. \"Which we're not.\" he stated simply. I just took notice to the fact that I was leaning towards him and him towards me. There was an intensity in his eyes that I had never seen directed at me before, it came from Eddie. I could never place it before right now, but the thing I saw in his eyes was love or the closest thing to love that one can feel after knowing someone for only 2 months. \"No, definitely not.\" I reply with a shy smile. \"Because you hate me.\" he says back with a joking tone of voice. He then took a small step closer to me. I nod, \"Yes, very much.\" but I said it in the spirit of a joke because I knew that answer is far from the truth and in that split second everything made sense. I was falling for Eddie and I didn't care. I didn't care because I knew that he was falling too. Then his hand came up and he gently gripped my neck, and he bent his head close to mine and pulled my face into his and kissed me. There was so much want and need in that kiss it made me weak at the knees and the only thing that keeps me standing is his lips. And then he pulls away from me. I didn't understand what was wrong so I asked, \"What, What's wrong?\" Then there was an almost guilty look on his face and I knew there was something very wrong. \"Eddie, what's wrong?\" I ask a little more forcefully. \"There's something that I need to tell you, but if I tell you, than you have to promise me you will let me finish what I am going to say without interrupting of asking questions. You can ask all of your questions after I tell you the whole story. Is that okay with you?\" He asked. He was almost pleading me with his eyes to say yes, so that is how I answered. He led me over to a hay bail and we sat down next to each other. He picked up my left hand with his left hand and rubs his thumb over my knuckle . \"Okay... you know a little bit after we met, when we were in the laundry room and you said something about the prince, and you wanted to know if Denmark has one. Well... do you remember how I defended him and his decision to you?\" He asked and I nod in response, \"I am very, very good friends with the prince. I know him better than anyone else in the world. We are like brothers,\" I opened my mouth to say something and he just places a light finger over my mouth to silence my question. \"I know him so well because... I-I am him.\" It took me some time to process what had just come out of Eddie's mouth. He is the Prince of Denmark. He is the Prince of Denmark! \"Why didn't you tell me sooner?\" I only cared what his answer to this question is because the rest we could get through but I don't know why he lied to me. And I need to know why he hadn't told me this yet. He took a deep breath and looked deep into my eyes. So deep that I think he saw my very soul. \"I didn't want to be treated like Prince Edvard for once in my life and if I had told you who I was you would not have gotten to see the real me without paparazzi following us everywhere. No one likes to be followed and I knew that I would still be Prince Edvard. I just wanted to have a normal life and some freedom from who I must become in the near future. To be completely honest, the real reason I came was to get away from my parents and to have some dimwitted girls take their tops off for me,\" I laughed quietly to myself about his reference to the first time we met, \"but then I met you and I fell for you like I never have before. This isn't just the Prince on another one of his escapades. Because of this, I have meet an amazing woman and made new friends, seen and done things I never dreamed of, and found the one thing in my life that I was missing. The thing I was missing was you.\" This time I kissed him because he had just given the best answer any girl would dream about. Eddie pulled away and rested his forehead on mine. Then there was a question that needed to be answered and I didn't know what the answer was going to be but I asked the question anyway, \"Why are you telling this to me now?\" Again there was a look of guilt on his face and then sadness. \"I have to go back to Denmark as soon as possible. My father is very sick, more sick than anyone thought, and I was wondering if, because I got to spend Thanksgiving with your family, if maybe you would want to go to Denmark with me over Christmas?\" Well I was not expecting that to be his answer. \"We still have classes between now and Finals. Would we be able to finish those before we go?\" He nodded in response so I kept asking the questions I have. \"Would they be okay with you bringing someone home that isn't royal like you are?\" Now a devilish smile spread across his face and he answered with, \"I also propose that I teach you a little about myself and my family history as well as what my mother would deem royal etiquette skills. According to my mother, to act royal you must be born royal. I believe her exact quote, the one she has been saying to me for years, is 'Being royal is not like being famous or being rich. It is something much, much more. It is a way of being, that can only be learned from birth. It is an embodiment that requires you to sacrifice who you are for who you must be.' But I want to prove her wrong. I want to teach you how to be exactly what she would expect from a woman that might become the next Queen of Denmark.\" When he said that it finally made it sink in that if for any reason they got married I would someday become queen of a country. But that was somewhere far in the future and I did want to impress Eddie's mom and dad. So, I looked deep into his eyes and gave a small smile, and nodded my head in agreement to let him be my teacher for a while. I already know he is a good teacher so it shouldn't be hard to learn from him. I moved closer to him and and rested my head on his shoulder as he wrapped his arms around me and kissed the top of my head. His voice was muffled as he spoke into my hair, \"I know it's a lot to take in but I have one more question for you, love.\" He moved so he was kneeling down in front of me and he took my hands again. \"Paige. I think I am falling in love with you and I was wondering if you would agree to...\", was he really going to ask me to marry him I thought to myself, \"be my girlfriend, and maybe one day be my wife?\" I chuckle a little in relief and simply nod my head. He smiled as he reached into his pocket and pulled out a beautiful diamond necklace. It wasn't just diamonds but it was a gray stone on a diamond connector that is on the chain. It was so pretty and it was so me. I almost started to cry as he latched it around my neck. It rested in the right place between my collarbones and my cleavage. \"Now I am going to walk you back into your parents house and kiss you goodnight. Then tomorrow after we get back to campus we will start your lessons on how to act 'royal'. But, just to let you know ,I love you just the way you are.\" He kissed me and pulled me to my feet, walked me inside and kissed me on my cheek. I went into my room got into my Pj's and went to sleep with a smile on my face. I hope everyone likes my story so far. Please review and let me know if you want to know what happens next. Please be kind because this is my first fanfic ever. I will post the next chapter as soon as I can! Thanks for everything! -morningglory11[Chapter 2] BECOMING ROYAL Nothing in this story belongs to me... other than the plot line that is ;) Chapter 2- This is what I want. I woke up the next morning the same way that I went to sleep. With a smile on my face. After I woke up a little bit more, I threw a robe on over my Pj's, grabbed my towel off its hook and walked down the hallway to the bathroom. I knocked on the door and, when no one answered, I opened the door. My mouth was open so wide my chin must have hit the floor. There, standing in front of the sink in nothing but a white towel shaving his face was Eddie. I must have stood there like a moron for an hour before I cleared my throat mumbled an unintelligible 'I didn't know anyone was using the bathroom' and closed the door on the way back to my room. Omigod, did you see his chest! I thought to myself he must spend hours in the gym to get his pecs to look like that. Oh, and don't forget about those abs which look like they were chiseled by Michelangelo himself. I sound like some hormonal teenage girl. But, who wouldn't after seeing what I just saw? There was a soft knock on my door and Eddie said ,through the door, that the bathroom was unoccupied and free to be used. I could almost see the teasing smile on his face. After I couldn't hear his footsteps anymore ,I went to the bathroom and took a very cold shower and tried to wash the memory of Eddie out of my head. Let me tell you that it didn't work, but I got out of the shower to dry off. Putting on my most comfortable pair of jeans and a t-shirt, I thought of some things to ask Eddie about my teachings of royal behavior. After everyone ate brunch, my dad and Eddie loaded our bags into the car. mom and I stood on the porch and she looked back and forth between me and Eddie. She just looked at me and chortled to herself and asked, \"Did you and Eddie have a good time in the barn last night?\" The question caught me off guard and I blushed. \"Mom,\" I said in a more harsh tone that I intended but, \"please don't tell dad. All we have done is kiss and I'm in college for gods sake. But he did invite me to spend Christmas in Denmark with him and his family, and I have agreed to go.\" I smiled to myself at the thought that I was dating a Prince. Right then Eddie walked up with my dad not two paces behind him. I looked at Eddie pleadingly ,and he just rolled his eyes and nodded his head already knowing what I was begging him for. \"Mom I … we have something to tell you and dad, and it needs to be kept a secret until we tell you it can be public knowledge.\" I started to explain. I looked at Eddie and he smiled reassuringly at me. I took his hand in mine and began to explain the rest to my loving mom and dad. \"You see, in Denmark Eddies family is a very big deal. Kind of like royalty... well exactly like royalty.\" I explained. \"In less than a year, I will be king of Denmark. My father is very sick and I would love for Paige to meet him while he is still very healthy.\" He looked at my dad and lost a little bit of his corniness, but not enough that my parents notice. \"I don't know if I will get the chance to ask this again so here it goes. I love Paige very much and I would like to ask you, both of you, for your blessing to one day, not in the too near future, to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage. I intend for her to stand at my side as my partner throughout my life, as my Queen. She would finish her year of college and then ,finish her medical degree at the medical college my family started over 200 years ago. She would get to do anything and everything she has ever wanted and I would make sure to always take care of her. I love her more than anything in this whole world and I would do anything to make her happy.\" Now he stopped and kissed the top of my head. I heard my dad sigh, and I looked over at him. \"Is this really what you want to do? We will support you in any and all decision that you make, but we also want you to do what is best for you.\" My dad loved me so much. I looked at him, my mom, and back at Eddie and I realized that I love the idea of the things Eddie was telling my family. I look over at my mom and dad and answered in the most calm voice I have ever heard come out of my mouth, \"This is what I want. I want to stand by Eddies side and, even though I am so nervous that my knees are shaking just thinking about it, I believe that I can do it. I know it will be a lot on top of medical school, but I'm sure if anything started to happen I could get a number of people to help me with anything I might need. This is what I want.\" \"Okay then we give our permission and blessing to get married but not any time sooner than one year from now.\" My dad answered and my mom looked at Eddie and said, \"If I don't get the first invitation then I will have a bone to pick with my soon-to-be son-in-law, do you hear me?\" \"Yes mam' I understand.\" he chuckled lightly. After that, we had our final good-byes and started the 4 hour drive back to our dorm rooms. We held hands in the not at all weird silence in the car. It felt nice to have some time to sit with all that had happened in the last two days. Eddie and I had confessed our love for each other, he told me he was the prince of Denmark, and the next day we basically got engaged. A lot has happened and I don't know what question to ask first. \"Do you have any brothers or sisters?\" I asked because it seemed like the easiest of questions to answer. \"Yes. I have a little sister named Arabella and she will love you just as much as I do. My dad is in the same boat as Arabella, will be as sweet as can be, and will like your spunk. But my mother is a different story. She doesn't like change, but when she sees how much I have grown up because of you she will have to come into a new mindset.\" Well part of that was nice to hear. \"What's your favorite color?\" This is also an easy question. \"My favorite color is red but for our wedding I think the colors should be dark blue because it is your favorite and buttery yellow because it is my mothers favorite and white for your dress of course.\" he answered nonchalantly. How he knows what my favorite color was is besides the point. I liked his idea for wedding colors, and I put them in the back of my mind. \"What religion are you?\" Now to the more difficult questions. \"I, as well as the rest of the royal family with about 80% of the Danish population belongs to the Danish National Church. It is just a Lutheran branch of Catholicism. As part of our Constitution the Royal family must belong to this religion so you have to convert if you are not already baptized as Lutheran.\" I was in fact already a Lutheran, and I told him as much. He gave me a reassuring squeeze of my hand. On to the next question. \"Do you have houses anywhere but Denmark? And why are you living in the dorms now if you are a Prince?\" \"Yes we have houses all over the world. My favorite one is the one my dad had built for my mother when they got married. It is on one of the 367 named but uninhabited islands off the coast of Denmark. It's light cream colors and light wood, and it has windows almost all the way around it. You can watch the sunrise from the master bedroom. Its like a hiding place in the craziness that is my life.\" \"It sound beautiful. Could we go there some time?\" he turned to look at me for a second ,before turning his focus back on the road with a smile and a nod to me. \"and the reason for the dorm is that I didn't want to be the Prince for once. I wanted to be normal and that is what a normal college kid does. Plus the only way I could get my mom and dad to agree to me coming here was to do it all on my own. With no help from them.\" \"How did you know that your dad was sick?\" I asked more reverently. \"Somehow, Arabella got the number to my room's phone and she called me crying, because she didn't know what was going on but she knew it was bad and she was scared. I, luckily, got her to calm down and she told me that there all kinds of doctors coming to see my dad. After I got off the phone with her, I phoned my mom and she told me my dad's sickness had started to get worse and worse and that she wanted me home for Christmas.\" \"How are you planing to do all of this Princess training without any help?\" \"Well when I agreed to come home, my mom had my credit restored, and now I have all the money we could ever need to start your lessons.\" \"That's not what I meant,\" I said rolling my eyes, \"I meant, what are you going to teach me?\" \" I am going to teach you how to walk, talk, sit, stand, eat, anddress like a Princess and someday future Queen.\" After this was said we fell back into silence. I rested my head on Eddies shoulder and he put his arm around me as he kept driving. I must have fallen asleep because the next thing I know I was standing in a room all by myself in a beautiful white dress. Not just any white dress but my wedding dress. I hear the music start and leave the room to find my dad. I end up standing in front of an aisle with my arm on my father's. At the end was a Pastor. On his left was Eddie and he looked as amazing as ever. In his black tux, he was the vision of a king. Next to him was a man that I assumed to be his best man but I paid him no attention. My maid of honor was my best friend and roommate Beth Curtis. When we finished walking the aisle, my father gave me over to Eddie. Then the ceremony began and I was choked up when it came to my turn to say my vows. After I said my vows in tears, Eddie slipped on my wedding band. The pastor pronounced us man and wife, and Eddie gave me a searing kiss in front of everyone we know, including other monarchs and extended family. I was jolted awake by a soft kiss being brushed against my lips. I realized it was Eddie the moment after I was awake and I wrapped my arm around his neck and held him to me. After a few minutes of this passionate exchange, I pulled away and Eddie groaned. I just chuckled and shook my head at him. \"Are we back? What time is it? What's going on?\" I asked. He smiled and answered, \"Yes we are back and its only 1;30. I was going to ask if you wanted to start with your lessons but after that,\" which he was talking about the kisses we shared, \" I don't know if I can concentrate on your lessons.\" He tried to lean in to kiss me again but I put my fingers up and pressed them to his lips instead of my own lips. He opened his eyes and scowled at me, but I could feel him smile under my fingers. \"No, no, no. Now is not the time, your highness. Now is the time for my first princess lesson.\" Please, please, please review. I would really like to know what everyone thinks of my story so fair. ~morningglory11[Chapter 3] BECOMING ROYAL by: morningglory11 This is what I think should have happened after Edvard and Paige kiss in her mom and dad's barn. Chapter 3: Lessons We walked into my room, and there sat my roommate, Beth. She looked up and smiled the widest smile she could manage. \"I see that the break was nice for you both.\" she said slyly towards us both eyeing our intertwined fingers. I looked up at Eddie and he gave me a knowing look and sighed. \"Beth, can we come sit with you? We need to tell you something.\" Eddie asked politely. She looked a little confused, but she moved into one of the chairs and gestured for us to sit on the couch. Eddie took a deep breath and looked at me, signaling it was my turn to talk. \"Well, as you know, Eddie is from Denmark. Eddie's parents are kind of a big deal. Actually, they are the biggest deal in the whole country.\" She opens her mouth and the most astonishing thing came out. \"Isn't there a king and queen in Denmark and aren't they supposed to be the biggest deal in the country?\" she asked. I looked at her and, then at Eddie, and back to Beth. \"Well, the thing is that Eddie a.k.a Prince Edvard is the son of King Haraald and Queen Rosalind.\" I reply. She sat there in a daze for a few minutes, then a big smile spread across her face as she looked at us. She just stared at us with a huge smile on her face and she looked kind of crazy but I love her like a sister so I don't mind it so much. \"You're telling me that your boyfriend is the prince and future king of a country? Never mind, you are telling me this so I just better get over it. Why didn't you tell me sooner than this? Do I really mean that little to you?\" She started to look sad, so Eddie jumped in. \"I just told Paige yesterday. Before then she just thought I was some rich man's son skipping my way through college before I took over for my dad. Now she,her mom and dad, and you are the only people who know who I really am.\" he said coolly. \"So...why are you telling me this?\" Beth asked looking a little confused. \"Well you are the closest thing to a sister that I have,\" I reply quickly. \"And because I might need your help with a few things. You see in the next few weeks I have to change Paige into a princess.\" Eddie said only seconds after I finish. Beth's eyes get even brighter than they were before as she asks, \"So when do we get started?\" So here I sit to have my first lesson on becoming a princess. Eddie starts to talk to me about how I must stand and hold my shoulders back as I did so. He then showed me how, according to him, I don't walk but instead I stomp. We then worked on walking and making it look as if I may have been gliding not walking. We talked about the difference between a cheesy princess walk and a regal walk. And his 'homework' to me was to walk like a princess as I did everything, not just when I was practicing. He said that before the end of 2 weeks I will no longer have to think about how I walk, sit, or stand and it was all going to work out for the better. After a hard three hours of work, we all settle in and watch a movie. When it finishes it is a little after 11 and because I had an 8 o'clock class tomorrow I go to bed dreaming of princesses and castles on the coast. For the next three days I went to classes, did homework, and worked all while standing straight with my shoulders rolled back and down with my neck straight. It was some of the most strenuous work that I have ever done. The good part was that every night after work Eddie would come over to my dorm and rub my shoulders, draw me a bath and read me some of Shakespeare's sonnets. Then I would give him a small kiss and go to my room as he starts the walk back to his and then I would fall into a peaceful oblivion. This continued for the next four nights. We started to go on walks before my neck rub and we would go to the park and watch the sunset and look at the stars. He would tell me all about himself and his life in Denmark and I would tell him of my life here and of my hopes and dreams. In this week alone, I feel closer to him than I have ever felt to him, even when his body is nowhere close to me. On Sunday, exactly a week since we came back from my parents' house and a week after our first lesson, Eddie came over to start our next lesson. This lesson was about how a princess was supposed to talk. \"Is there really a proper way to talk? I mean I know that there is a proper way to talk but I don't think...\" I trail off at the look he was giving me. \"What?\" I question \"Well, first of all, you have to slow down when you speak. If you talk too fast, the reporters will not be able to tell what you are saying. Secondly, when you are addressing the press or one of your elders, being my mom, dad, or any one of the people in Parliament, you must speak in proper English. No contractions. No prepositions at the end of your sentences. You need to speak as if you are writing an English paper, even if this means it takes you a moment to think about what you are going to say as an answer to a question. For practice today, I will be asking you some questions that the press might ask you in the future. Are you ready?\" I nod in a silent answer as I take in all that he had just said to me. Well, I think I just got told to think before I talk. Well then. A small smile spread across my face because he is the only person in the world that I would let say that to me. \"Okay. Here we go. It must be a lot to deal with, moving from the United States to a county that you had never ever been in before. Why would you do something like that for a boy that you had just met so recently?\", he asked me. It wasn't like it was Eddie asking the question, it really did feel like someone outside of ourselves was asking the question. I took a moment to compose my reply and, once I had it, I answered with the best answer that came to mind. \"I moved across an ocean to live in a country that I had never seen before because of one simple fact, I love Prince Edvard with all of my heart. I know a lot of people might think that I am only with him for the money and power that comes from being a Princess and Future heir to the throne, but, when I first met Edvard, I had no idea who he was, let alone that he was royalty. I truly fell in love with him because he was so charming, he helped me with my Shakespeare homework, and he put up with my brothers for a weekend. I moved here to be with Edvard, because I would not want to be anywhere else.\" When I finished, I saw a small smile grace Eddie's face. In that second, I knew that the answer I had given was a good answer. \"What do you plan to do first as the new Princess of Denmark?\" he asked me. \"I don't know what I plan to do first but I do know I will be standing at Edvard's side for whatever is coming our way.\" I reply. \"Lastly, when you become Queen what do you want to be remembered for?\" he asked. For this question I had to think a little bit harder. After another 30 seconds I gave my answer to Eddie. \"I cannot tell you what I want to accomplish as Queen nor what I want to be remembered for other than I want the people of your country, of my country, to see me as a person who will do all that I can to protect them and our country. Because it is not your country anymore but it is also my country. I will do what is in the best interests of the country and what I can to protect them, as if they are my own blood.\" I answer simply. Over the next few days I practiced all that I could. When I would answer a teacher's question in class or answer a question that Stu, my boss, asks me, I answered them in the way I am to speak to the press. As the days pass, I realized that I continued to walk the correct way and I am starting to speak the correct way. Also, Eddie has started to teach me the history and the ways of the Danish government. The more I learn about the country and the culture the more I realize that I might actually be able to become a, at least decent, queen. Before I know it a week has passed and it is time for my next lesson. When I walk into my dorm room that night the table is fully set and the lights are dimmed, but the light from hundreds of candles illuminate the room. Eddie turns around and walks up to me. After giving me a small peck he began his lesson in his 'teacher voice', as I started to call it last week. \"When you sit as a Princess, you may have on dress slacks from a meeting or you might have on a full ballroom gown. The key is to always sit on the front half of the chair with your back straight. You only ever cross your legs at the ankle and not the knee. In most formal place settings, from left to right it is arranged like,\" he then leads me to sit in one of the places at the table, \"this. On the far left you have the napkin, then the salad fork and the closest fork to the plate is the dinner fork. Above that is your bread plate with your bread knife set on that plate. Next to the forks, are the service plate with the salad plate on top of that. Above the plates, is the cake fork. Above that is the dessert spoon and the place card is above that. On the right side of the plates, you have the dinner knife, which is closest to the plates, and the sharp edge is always facing the the plates. Next to that, is your teaspoon and, next to that, is your soup spoon. On the furthest right, is your cup and saucer. You also have two wine glasses and a water glass. The water glass is just to the right of the dessert spoon. Next to and below that, is your wine glass for red wine. Below and just to the right, is your wine glass for your white wine.\" After explaining to me where everything was on the table and what they are used for, we set out to have a nice meal. The food was perfectly cooked and it was a lot easier to learn this than I thought it was going to be. It felt like the longest dinner of my life, but that was okay because it was a few hours of Eddie and me just being ourselves. Sometimes he would interrupted our everyday talk to correct my posture while we practiced my table manners. All in all it was a very romantic lesson/date. After cleaning up my room, Eddie and I put a movie in a DVD and started to watch some movie I had never even heard of before. I must have dozed off because the next thing I know, I am being dragged into my room by a very tired looking Eddie. He gave me a soft kiss on the lips before he left to return to his own room. In a blind stumble, I pull on a pair of pj's and let myself drift back to oblivion. The next day I wake up from a pounding on my door. When I finally pull myself out of bed to go to my door, it was Beth that had come to wake me up at... uaahhgggg... 7:30 in the morning. Too early, but the instant I see what see is wearing I know this is going to be a good Sunday morning. See, Beth has this theory that you have to wear something easy to get in and out of when you go shopping because you have to try everything on. So every time we go shopping she wears the same blue and white print v-neck maxi dress. It looks good on her but if I try to wear it, the dress and I look horrible. A devilish smile spreads across my face as I see which, or rather, whose credit card is in her hand. \"God, I love your boyfriend.\" Beth says to me for the fourth time as we exit the last shop. Eddie had given us a list of all the things I would need before we left for Denmark in a week, the credit card, and he gave me all of the freedom I could ever ask for. When we got to the first shop, we got a shock when a man by the name of James said he was to be our personal shopper for the day. He had helped the queen shop here in the states before so he knew what was appropriate to buy. A whole wardrobe later and we were on our way back to the dorm to get packing. When we got to the door to our room, I see a 5 piece luggage set on our doorstep. There was a note on it that read, 'I know that this would be the last thing you would think of buying for yourself so I got you some'. He knows me so well. Thanks to those of you who reviewed my story so fare and I just want to say thanks for them. They make my day bright by just knowing someone enjoys it. Please, please, please, review if you have not and if you have, and you know who you are, keep it up. I hoped you liked this new chapter and I will have the next one up as soon as I can. ~morningglory11 P.S. To see the place setting that Eddie used, visit my profile![Chapter 4] BECOMING ROYAL by: morningglory11 This is what I think should have happened after Edvard and Paige kiss in her mom and dad's barn. I own nothing but the plot (which sucks for me ;) because the characters are all amazing). Chapter 4: Plane Rides Two days before Eddie and I leave for Denmark, I basically have to drag him out with me to help find a Christmas present for his mother, father, and little sister. As i rode with Eddie towards the store, I started to ask him questions about his family. \"Does your sister play an instrument?\" I ask. He smirks as he replies \"Yes she does. She plays the violin and the piano. But she enjoys playing her violin more than she does the piano.\" \"What does your dad do in his free time?\" \"He loves to read. His favorite book is Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck.\" \"Does he have a first edition copy of that book?\" \"No. That is one of his favorite books, that he does not have a first edition copy of.\" \"And your mom, what do you get her most years?\" \"Well, she always used to get Christmas ornaments from her mom every year. But when my grandmother passed away, I started to do that for her instead.\" \"Okay. So we are going to get your sister a violin. I know that she already has one but the one we get her is going to be pink. All girls love pink and I think she will love her present. For your dad, we will get him a first edition copy of GOW. And for your mom, we will get her a Christmas ornament. But this year it will be from the both of us, not just you. Does that sound good?\" \"Yes it does and I agree with you, Ari will like a pink violin.\" After 12 music stores, 20 vintage book stores, and 15 different places to try and find Christmas ornaments, Eddie drove us back to my dorm room so we could wrap the gifts. When we finished that task, it was still only 1:30 in the afternoon. After arguing for fifteen minutes, we agree that we will go see the new Green Lantern movie (awesome movie! And Ryan Reynolds is sooooo cute) When we get to the theater parking lot, it is almost deserted. That's strange for a Saturday afternoon. When we walk up the the door, there is a 'sorry we're closed' sign. Eddie pulls out a key and opens the door. I give him a questioning look as I pass by him. He just smirks and whispered in my ear, \"It's good to be a Prince.\" A small smile spreads over my face and a small giggle slips from my mouth. \"What did you do Eddie?\" I ask. \"Well, let's just say I pulled the 'I'm the Prince of Denmark' card, and we have the whole theater to ourselves. Let's go and get some snacks from the counter and then get to our seats.\" he responded. Without thinking, I threw myself into his arms and gave him a big kiss. With a whispered thank you, I ran like a little kid to the concessions. There was every candy and sweet a person could want. Everything from Skittles to Hershey's Special Dark chocolate; from Swedish Fish to Pochy (this a Japanese candy that is like a pretzel dipped in chocolate. It is one of the best candy I have ever had! =D). I grab a tub of popcorn, a bottle of water, and a box of Pocky and run to the theater. Eddie came in right after me and sat down. He pulls his phone out of his pant pocket and sent a text. After he set his arm around my shoulders and I snuggled into his side, the lights dimmed and the movie started. The movie ended up being more of a make-out session than a time to see a movie but you won't ever see me complaining about that. On the drive back to my dorm room, we talked about the actors in the movie. It started when I commented on how I thought that Ryan Reynolds was cute and ended with Eddie saying he was an 'ass-face', but Blake Lively was a very nice girl. After we got back to my dorm, we talked about what I should expect tomorrow when we get to Denmark. \"No one other than my family and the people that work at the palace should know that we are flying in tomorrow,\" Eddie tells me, \"But that does not mean that the press will not be there. My mother thinks that someone in the house has been telling the press about where I have been, so she has been giving them bad information. But we never know. You should wear something comfortable to the airport, but bring something to change into for when we get to Denmark. I could care less, but my mother will think better of you if you are aware of the press element that will be caught up in our relationship now.\" \"Okay. I have some clothes that have been deemed acceptable by James that are very comfortable and will look as good as they do hanging in my closet as they will when we walk off the plan tomorrow. Do you think that will be okay?\" I ask shyly. He smiles softly and nods his head. \"Oh. This reminds me. I packed a some clothes for everything I could think of. You need to tell me it I need to pack anything else. Okay so I packed undergarments and pj's ,of course, I packed exercise clothes because I still would like to go running sometimes and some blue jeans to wear with some of my button up shirts so it still looks nice but it is a little bit comfortable. I packed a few sundresses, some business and business casual stuff, some more formal wear, not like a ball gown but for like a more formal dinner. I also packed things like different blazers and jackets and sweaters. All kinds of accessories, like jewelry, shoes, handbags and such in addition to all different kinds of makeup and ways to do my hair. Can you think of anything else I might need?\" I ask with a hint of panic in my voice. Eddie pulls me into a big hug and whispers in my ear, \"I think you have everything. My mother will want to have any ball gowns made there so you don't have to worry about that and if you need something we can always go out and get it for you.\" With my worries put to ease, we say our good nights and Eddie leaves to get the rest that he needs so I can do the same. I threw on the most comfortable pj's that I own and fall into my bed. I am out as soon as my head hits the pillow and I dream of plane rides and meeting the family. I woke up to the sound of complete silence. It was a sound, that in the last few weeks, I was hearing less and less. I rolled over to get a look at my clock if flashed a red 1:00. PM. Crap! I only have two and a half hours before we have to leave for the airport. I jump out of my bed and ran into the bathroom. I took a quick but much needed shower. As the hot water washed over my shoulders I found a new burst of hope that this trip will end well for all parties involved. I wrap myself in my robe and quickly dry my hair. I always get ready for things like this, well not things like this but special events kind of like this, in the same order. Shower, dry hair, do makeup, put on clothes, do hair, check makeup, and do any last minute things that need to be done. So this is what I do. After my hair was 100% dry, I apply a small amount of powder foundation, a natural blush, light pink eyeshadow, brown liner, black/brown mascara, and finally a light pink almost clear lip gloss. I walk back into my room and over to the closet and pull out the outfit I have planned to wear on the plane. I slip into a pair of khaki trousers, a light pink long sleeved collared button up, as well as a circular patterned khaki knee length trench that I sat on my desk chair for when I leave. I return to the bathroom where I easily used a round brush to smooth out my hair and give it a little more body. I looked in the mirror and I know that Eddie would be shocked into silence when he saw me. He had seen me in jeans and t-shirts and that's it. He was in for a big surprise. I took one more look through my carry on bag and rolled all three pieces of my luggage out to stand next to the door for Søren to take to the car. At exactly 3:30, there was a knock on the door into my dorm room. \"Its good to see you Søren. It has been awhile since I have seen you. How have you been?\" I asked after I opened the door. \"I am doing just fine Ms. Paige. I am very excited that I can go back home. If we are to stay on schedule though, I must take your bags to the car now and we must be on our way.\" he replies. I grab my pink hand bag and walked out the door with Søren right behind me with my bags. I hate not being able to help him with some of my things but I know, from my lessons from Eddie, that it was okay to have the people that were employed by his family do the job they were hired to do. When we got to the car, Søren set my bags down next to the car and opened the back door for me. Like I was taught by Eddie, I stood next to the opening and with my foot closest to the door I stepped in, all the while sliding my hands under myself so that my trench coat stayed under me. When I was seated, I set my bag on the floor in front of myself and took a deep breath. \"That was perfect. You looked like a real Princess. I am so excited for you to meet my family. They will love you just as much as I do.\" Eddie says from his seat next to me. I did not even notice until that moment that Eddie had taken my hand and was rubbing soothing circles into the back of my hand. God, I love this man. He really is the handsome Prince that has come to save me. I just moved closer to him and rested my head on his shoulder as he wraps me in his arms and kisses the top of my head. \"I love you too, Eddie.\" For the rest of the drive to the airport, we sat in silence. Just being near to him makes me feel good and whole. Because we are flying on a commercial flight for our first leg, we go through security, when we get there. As we wait, both Eddie and I get a coffee and kept waiting. We were flying first class so we were the first to board the plane. The first leg of the flight was the easy part. I just watched the in-flight movie and, when that was over, it was time to land. From that plane, we moved into the private plane that the Royal Family owns. This part was not going to be as easy to handle. I have had more time to think about things at this point and I am starting to freak myself out. Just after take off, I can feel Eddie's hand slip into my own. \"Everything is going to be fine. How about we start a movie and, after we eat dinner, I will read you some of my favorite of Shakespeare's sonnets and poems until you fall asleep?\" he asked and it did sound good so that is just what we did. We watched the first half of the first Harry Potter films, we had steak and scalloped potatoes for dinner and then he read me Take, O Take and sonnets #44, 105, 130, and 148 as I drifted to sleep. Sorry that it has been so long! I have just had so much to do but I finally had time to finish this chapter. Please let me know what you think of this chapter. Thanks so much for reading! ~morningglory11[Chapter 5] BECOMING ROYAL by: morningglory11 This is what I think should have happened after Edvard and Paige kiss in her mom and dad's barn. Chapter 5: Meeting THE Parents \"Wake up, love.\" Eddie whispers in my ear. My only response is to groan a little bit and snuggle deeper into Eddies shoulder. As I do this, Eddie laughs lightly and rubs by back in affection. \"We are in Denmark. Time to get up and meet the parents.\" With this, my eyes snap open and I sit up. He gently rubs my back as I breath deeply, trying to keep the fear away. When the plane comes to an end, we both stand up to exit to the car that will take us to the royal palace. Just before the door to the plane opens, Eddie wraps his hand around mine and gives me a small smile. As soon as the door begins to drop into stairs, there is a million little flashes going off. Show time. We both smile for all of the cameras and don't answer the questions being thrown at me. We slowly make our way through the crowd of people and flashing cameras, and duck into the awaiting car. As the car starts moving, everything starts to sink in and I realize my life will never be the same again. We drove for 45 minutes, all the while Eddie pointed out all of the beautiful and historical buildings of Denmark. As we approach the palace, all of the air left my lungs from the beautifully breathtaking sight before me. The red brick exterior and beautiful stained glass windows I was instantaneously transported into a dream. It was more beautiful that I could have ever dreamed. Eddie chuckled at my reaction and lightly kissed my temple as the car came to a stop at the private gate into the palace. Within moments of the car stopping, the door was being opened for Eddie by one of the helpers. Once out of the car, Eddie turned and extended his hand to help me out of the car as gracefully as possible. \"Oh my goodness. This place is so beautiful. You grew up here? Why in the world would you want to leave? If I was born here, and had the chance to live here, I don't think I would ever want to leave.\" I said in amazement. Eddie just chuckled and pulled me to follow him. We walked through the courtyard and into the main building. We walked up one flight of stairs and into a long room. Bookshelves lined every wall from floor to ceiling. In the middle of the room sat an older couple. The woman stood at the man's side while he signed some papers and, when the doors opened, both the man and woman looked up at the door. \"Hello. It is so good to see you Edvard.\" said Eddie's mom as she walked towards us with her arms out. When she reached us, Eddie released my hand and wrapped his arm around his mom. \"Hello mother. It is good to see you as well.\" he said to his mom as he walked to his dad to shake hands. \"And who is this?\" Rosalind asked Eddie. With a smile on his face, Eddie walked back towards me and lifted my hand to his lips. I knew I had a stupid looking grin on my face when Eddie turned back to his parents. \"This beautiful creature standing before you is Miss Paige Morgan. She is my girlfriend. We met in our chemistry class in college. She is currently studying to become a doctor and I intend to marry her as soon as I can.\" he said to his parents all the while still looking in my eyes. \"Absolutely NOT!\" said Rosalind in a resolved tone. I can't believe that. She just said no without even listening to Eddie and she would really try and keep this happiness from her child. Astounding, I think to myself. An almost furious look came into Eddie's eyes as he said, \"I love her and she loves me and we will do as we please.\" \"Oh, love. When has it ever been about that?\" is her rebuttal. \"It has taken a lot to get to where we are today. All we want is the chance to be together.\" he said back. \"It has taken a lot to get to where you are. It has taken us twelve hundred years to get to where we are.\" she shot back. \"In a few weeks time, you will ascend the throne as king and I will let nothing stand in the way of that. Certainly not some little affair with a gold digging American girl who dreams of becoming the next Princess Diana.\" I lightly grasped Eddies hand and he looks back at me. \"If I may?\" I ask him politely. He nods his head and I step forward. I bring my left foot behind me and complete a small curtsy with my head down. I lift my head in the direction of Rosalind and speak softly, \"Your highness, the last thing I want is your family's money. I am here because I love your son more than anything else in the world and I knew he would need my support in his choices, now more than ever before. I know you think I will be the end of the monarchy but I promise you that, I want, more than anything, for Edvard to have the best rule possible. I want him to be happy and him to be able to find a solution to every problem of this kingdom and I would like to help him in any way I can. I want to stand by his side and show this country everything that he is capable of because he is more capable of handling every challenge thrown his way than most people give him credit for. All I am asking of you is to let me have the chance to show you all of that. Edvard loves his country more than I have ever seen anyone love anything and I just want to share in that love he has for all things.\" I become quiet when I have nothing more to say. A pensive look comes across Rosalind face when I hear Eddie's father, King Haraald, stand and walk up to me. He brings my hand up and presses a small kiss to the back of my hand and then looks over to Eddie. \"I think you found a keeper. She is strong and knows her own heart. She will do good things for this country.\" He says in a low but commanding voice. \"But Haraald … do you really think allowing this will be the best thing for this country that you have spent your life improving?\" Rosalind asked her husband. \"She is obviously a smart girl if she wants to become a doctor, and it is plain that Edvard loves her very much. I have not seen him this happy in a very long time. If we object, they will get married anyway, so we might as well get to be a part of this. It is time for our son to become the man I have always known he could become, and I can already see Paige's positive influence on him. And she is a very beautiful girl so we will have the cutest grandchildren of all time.\" he said with a smile in his voice. When he mentioned me and Eddie having kids, a light blush rose to my cheeks. To tell the truth, I had never wanted kids, until I met Eddie, and now, that I have him in my life, I feel like I am so blessed to even think of having his kids. \"Thank you, your highness.\" I say back to him. He smiled down to me and shakes his head. \"Please, my dear, call me Haraald. If you are to become princess and queen of this kingdom, you will become family and there is no need to use titles between family. You won't hear me call Edvard, prince, so there is no need to call me 'your highness'. Am I understood?\" he commented back. I laugh lightly and nod my head in affirmation. After meeting both Haraald and Rosalind, Eddie took me to his favorite spot on the property. We casually walked down a small path which wound around the lake. We reached a large willow tree and under it I see a blanket and picnic basket. My heart melts as I realize that this was for us. We sat under that tree for hours that afternoon talking about everything and nothing. We talked about us and the future and how in just a few short weeks I would no longer be dating the prince of Denmark but the King of Denmark. That thought was a little scary but at the same time thrilling. We talked about some of the things that we had to do tomorrow and about how we would be having dinner with Ari that night. I was very excited to meet the girl that, up until recently, held Eddie's heart. As our conversation was coming to an end, I realize that Eddie has been sitting looking at the tree for far too long.. \"What are you doing over there with the tree? You should be over here next to me.\" I say with a joking tone of voice. \"Oh . I'm not doing much just making this our spot. That's all.\" he says as he steps away from the tree to reveal a heart carved into the tree, inside which, was carved a simple P.M + E.W. It was like one of the old black and white romantic movies. I now know what it feels like to be swept off my feet. I slowly got up from where I was on the ground. I reach my hand out to him and he grasp it tightly. In one second, I wrapped my arms around him and buried my face into the space between his shoulder and his neck. I place a kiss there and make my way up to his lips. We stood there so long, I felt like the earth stood still. In that few moments, I felt as if nothing in the world could pull me from this moment or from this feeling. I soon realize that my head was spinning because I had no air left I pull away and set my forehead on his. \"Thank you. You are so amazing that I can't even imagine why you would want me. I love you so much.\" I whisper into his ear. He just pulls me closer to him and wrapped his arms tighter around my waist. \"I am definitely not the amazing one out of the two of us. The person that you thought I was at first was not even real and yet you love me anyway. After I lied to you about my life in almost every way you will move forward at my side. I don't think I could do what you are doing right now. I love you with all of my being and I will always love you. Doing this, carving this into this tree is just a reminder of the love that I will always hold for you. But we should go back inside now to eat dinner with Ari. We can just leave this stuff here. Come on its time to meet my baby sister.\" he says to me. ~morningglory11[Chapter 6] BECOMING ROYAL by: morningglory11 This is what I think should have happened after Edvard and Paige kiss in her mom and dad's barn. If you feel like you have been missing something its because you have been (my bad). Something happened and chapter 4 was never posted … until now. If you want to go back and read it please do. Sorry in advance for the Danish in this chapter. I don't know if Google translate did what I wanted but I am hoping this is right. Chapter 6: Time With Ari I am not more nervous about dinner with Ari than meeting the king and queen but I am still nervous. I mean, for the longest time, Eddie was all hers and now she might think I am taking him away from her. I don't want her to think that she will never see her brother again. I want her to be in our wedding, when it happens, and I would never wish her to not have time with her big brother. Even though my brothers are big bone heads, I still love them and I know how it would feel for them to be taken away from me and I hope Ari will never feel that. I am pulled out of my musing when Eddie gently gripped my hand. I look up at him and the confused look on his face makes me smile. \"I'm just thinking. Nothing to worry about.\" I whisper to him. As we continue to walk I realize that I have not seen this part of the palace before. \"Where are we eating this dinner?\" I ask Eddie. \"In Ari's room. Well not her room per say. It's in the room outside of her bedroom that she uses for all kinds of different stuff. Like when her friends from school come over, they use it as a playroom and she and I eat dinner in there sometimes, when mom and dad are out and we don't want to eat in the big dinning room.\" he replied. We finally arrived at a set of large white french doors. Eddie knocked three times, one slow, two fast, and walked into the room. And there sat Ari. She sat on the side of the square table that faced the window on my right. There were three place settings on the table; one in front of Ari, one on the opposite side of Ari, and one on the side of the table that faces the door. Eddie pulled me into the room and closed the door behind us as Ari jumped up and ran to stand in front of us. \"Oh, it is so nice to meet you. I am just so excited that I finally have a sister.\" she looks over at Eddie and says, \"I love you Ed, but I am sorry to inform you that you had horrible taste in girls before and now I have someone who will go shopping with me and give me some kind of feedback.\" She pulls me to sit down in the place across from her. And one second later, a man with a cart walks into the room. He sets out a bowl of salad, a basket of bread, a big platter of pasta and meatballs, and finally a pitcher of milk. As we ate we made small talk. We talked about school, both hers and mine, as well as what I have learned in my 'princess lessons'. When we finished eating, we moved from the table to the couch and chairs on the left of the table. Ari and I sat in a love seat and Eddie sat in the chair to the right of us. \"So do you speak any Danish?\" Ari asks me. I look down at my hands and blush slightly. With a small smile I reply, \"Bare en lille smule. (Just a little bit.)\" Ari clapped and replied, \"Det var meget, meget god. Hvornår har du begynde at lære? (That was very, very good. When did you start learning?).\" \"Jamen jeg startede da jeg var omkring 10 og fortsatte i 8 år, og jeg har fortsat med at tage lektioner og slukker siden jeg var 18. (Well I started when I was about 10 and continued for 8 years and I have continued to take lessons on and off since the time I was 18.)\" \"That is so cool. It is like you were meant to be here with my big brother.\" she says next. She then turns to Eddie and asks, \"So, what are some of the places you are going to show her tomorrow?\" \"I'm not sure. Do you have any suggestions, little sister?\" he asks with a smile on his face. \"Oh, she has to see Copenhagen Opera house because it is just so beautiful. You should just make a night of it and see a play there. Also you have to take her to the national museum and the Tivoli gardens. And one of my favorite places to go, you have to take her to the Bakken Amusement Park. And, last but not least, she has to see THE church. The church in which every king in our family has been baptized, as well as married, in. But don't be worried, Paige. The church is so beautiful and I have a feeling that you will love the way it looks.\" She then takes a deep breath and lays her head on my legs and within minutes she is fast asleep. I gently lift her head and get up from under her. I turn back to Ari and lift her into my arms. Eddie smiles at me and opened to door into Ari's bedroom for me. I lay her in her bed and quickly remove her shoes as well as her tights. Then I wrap her sheet and comforter around her and place a light kiss to her temple. I smile down at her for a short second and then leave to find Eddie. I find him sitting on the couch. A fire, that he must have just started, crackled in the fireplace. I sit down next to him and wrap my legs up under myself as I rested my head on his shoulder. I sighed and, with Eddie rubbing my back, I could feel my body melt into his side. We sit like this watching the fire in silence and I feel my love for Eddie grow. It was moments like this when I think of how, with my old boyfriends, this would feel uncomfortable and that makes me realize how much I truly love Eddie. I feel him place a soft kiss to the top of my head and then his cheek rests on my head. \"You will be an amazing mother one day. The way you just were with Ari was absolutely amazing. You may not think you will make a good mom but actions speak louder than words and your actions just stated something I already knew.\" he stated quietly. \"Thanks.\" I reply just as quietly as he had spoken just seconds ago. I wake up to feel the warmth of sunlight on my face. I smile as I remember my night. The dinner with Ari, the cuddling with Eddie, and the sweet freedom into my dreams after a wonderful good night kiss. I stretch and rub my eyes as I sit up. After three knocks on the door, Søren walks in. He looks up at me with a small smile and hands me an electronic tablet. \"This is your schedule for today. First you will have a meeting with the Queen. Just a warning but this is your test to see if you can live up to the standards she has set for the woman that holds her son's heart. Secondly, you will be with Eddie in a press conference. The purpose of this is to let the reporters know who you are and that you have the countries best interest at heart. Last, you will be having dinner with the King and Queen as well as the prime minister and his wife. I would suggest that you start to get ready for the day. Your meeting with the Queen is in two and a half hours. If you need anything, let me or any of the other help know. The Princess also said she will be here in an hour to help you pick what to wear.\" With a polite bow of the head, Søren walks back out the door. With a nod of my head, I get up and get in the shower. When I step out of the shower and dry off, I look in the mirror to try and decide what to do will my hair. I end up parting my hair on the side and I use a hair comb to to pull back the thicker half of hair. I look at the hair comb resting against my head. This is the family heirloom that was passed from mother to daughter in my mothers family. Eddie's words ring in my ears from the night before. I hope to be a good mother someday and I can only hope that this hair comb can be passed to many more generations. I had not noticed, but Ari had come into my room. She set her hands on my shoulders and smiled into the mirror. We said our hellos and then she walked out of the bathroom to go look through my clothes. I easily brush on some mascara and a small smudge of blush and a dab of pink lip gloss. I walk out of the bathroom to find Ari sitting on my bed with an outfit laid out next to her. A pair of nice black trousers, a short sleeved teal shirt of satin that had tasteful ruffles around the neck, a gray jacket, and gray ballet flats that had a bow in the toe. \"My mother likes the house to feel like home. If you look casual but also ready to be presentable so if you were to be caught by the press you would not be criticized she will think better of you because you are prepared. Because the press conference will be in the house you will not have to change either. Eddie will most likely be in something just as casual as you are. For your dinner, you will need to be in something different and I think this,\" she points to a dress hanging on my wardrobe door, \"will be perfect.\" The dress is simple. It is straight and floor length with a sweetheart neckline with a sheer piece over that to make straps. The dark midnight blue color would look wonderful on the pale cream color of my skin. There are flowers on the left shoulder and a thick waist band right below the bust line. It was simple and classy looking and Ari was right. This was the perfect dress. \"Okay. That all sounds fine. Why am I so nervous? I don't have a reason to be nervous. Do I? No, I have no reason to be worried. Right?\" I talk to myself as I grab the clothes from the bed and head behind the changing screen. \"Paige?\" Ari asked from behind me, and I turn to look at her. \"You have nothing to be nervous about. Eddie or myself will be with you the whole time. Okay?\" In that moment, I knew I loved Ari like a sister because the comfort her words brought to me a piece of mind like a wave that washed away the nerves in my body. \"Thank you\" I replied to Ari. And then I went to put on the outfit that my new little sister had picked out for me as I mentally prepared myself to meet the Queen of Denmark. Thank you so much for reading. I know I have not posted in a really long time but here I am. Please review. I know I say this all the time but it really dose make the time I spend worth it. Also I am looking for a beta for this story and all of my other stories as well. Please let me know if you would like to help me out. I should have the next chapter up in the next few weeks. ~morningglory11[Chapter 7] I know this is kind of a small chapter but it has been such a long time sense I have posted anything new. Also I have a question to ask of you all. In the next chapter Eddie and Paige will be answering questions from the press and I need some good questions. If there is some questions that you have for Eddie and Paige please send me a PM or review with your question. Thank you so much for your help. Also the things underlined are being spoken in Danish. ~morningglory11 Chapter 7: Three Chances I sit as Ari vibrates in the spot next to her mother. We've been sitting in silence for almost five minutes, waiting for the Queen to speak. I glance again at the adorable girl to the queen's left and smile. She was so excited to properly introduce the two of us. She does not seem to understand the awkward tension in the air and for that I'm grateful. \"Little one be careful. If you keep bouncing so much, you will be bouncing so high we will not be able to get you down off the ceiling . \" I tried to keep a straight face but the moment her eyes met mine, we both share a smile and a quiet laugh. With this I look back at the queen to find surprise in her eyes. Then a questioning look floods into them as well. I answer her questioning eyes with a simple reply, \"I was always fascinated with the Danish language. I bothered my parents enough about it that they got me a computer software to teach me. I do not know if I am any good but I hope that, with Edvard's help, I will improve\". I see a flash of admiration in those same knowing eyes but it quickly passes. In its place, comes resignation. \"I do not like this and I do not like you… yet. But I might as well see what I have to work with,\" states the queen. She stands and the gestures to the maid in the corner. I glance at Ari and an even bigger smile has taken over her face. She claps her hands silently and skips over to my side. She quietly situates herself against my left arm as her mother takes her seat again and then maid quickly reenters the room with a tea tray. The maid quietly serves three cups of tea and fixes two of them. She easily delivers each of the cups to the royals and then glances at me. \" A small bit of milk and one sugar \" I reply with only as much authority as was needed in this situation. She quickly follows my directions and I nod in acknowledgement and turn away. The queen then does the same and the young maid quickly and quietly leaves the room. This was always going to be the hardest part for me. I was raised to say \"please\" and \"thank you\" but as the royal, I no longer had the obligation to say such things. I must be polite but not overly kind. I silently stirred my cup of tea and took a small drink. With a slight nod, I slide back in my seat ever so slightly and I cross my ankles and simply set my saucer on my knee for support. At this point I look up at the queen. \"I am going to give you three chances to impress me. This press conference with Edvard, the opening of the new hospital wing, and the groundbreaking. If you do well at these three events, I will tentatively give you and Edvard my approval. But if anything goes wrong at two of the three events, I will share my concern with whoever I need to in order to prevent your union. Do I make myself perfectly clear?\" she asks in a light and almost detached tone. \"Thank you, your Majesty. I understand your concern and will do anything in my power to show you that I can do what will be expected of me as the next ruler of this country\" I reply. Ari gently sets her teacup on the coffee table and I watch as she swings her legs up on the couch next to her. With a tired smile to me, she lays her head on my leg and positions my hand so that my arm is wrapped around her small shoulders. The room remains silent as the Queen and I continue to drink our tea. I glance down a few minutes of awkward silence later, after finishing my tea, to find Ari fast asleep. With as little movement as possible I immediately set my tea cup next two Ari's smaller one on the table. I glance at the queen and bowed my head in respect. I then gently stand with Ari in my arms as I walked back toward her room. On my way I met Eddie. With a kind smile, he removed Ari from my arms and carried her the rest of the way to her bed. Like the night before, I remove her shoes and gently slid her in two her pajamas. She was so excited to see us yesterday and she was up early this morning to help me. She should get a small nap now before her lunch and tutoring. Eddie silently takes my hand as we leave Ari's room. He silently and gently leads me around the maze of the palace before we arrive at a large set of solid wooden double doors. He brings my hand up to his lips and places the soft kiss on the back of each hand. He then softly asks, \"Are you ready for this? For our new life. After this there is no going back. Heaven forbid we don't work out but you will never live a private life again, either way.\" \"We will work,\" I reply with a mocking tone in my voice. \"Do not go into anything thinking negatively. And as long as you are sure you want me, I am here. We take every step after these steps together. No more doing anything alone. For either of us.\" I repeat his question back to him. \"Are you ready for this?\" We glance at each other with the same look of love and acceptance in our eyes and Eddie makes a small gesture with his hand toward the man at the door. With a small bow of his head, the doors begin to open. A sliver of light leaks between the doors, and flashes reflect in the inches between the wooden panels. With a deep breath, we both step through the doors, right foot first them one step after another.[Chapter 8] The things underlined are being spoken in Danish. Chapter 8: The Press We've been seated for almost five minutes now and the chaos has not waned. The flashes keep clicking and the battery of questions continue in the background. Eddie's hand is still gripping mine as our intertwined fingers rest of on my left thigh. I continued to smile gently as I feel Eddie's thumb brush the back of my hand in understanding. As the reporters began to quiet, Eddie takes another deep breath. With a quick glance in my direction, Eddie smiles and begins to speak. \"Hello everyone. And good morning. I know you have questions for both of us and you will have the opportunity to ask them in just a moment. Before that I would like to inform you all that this whole interview will be in English for Paige's comfort. We have a translator here at the front of the room for when it's needed. We will try to answer every question but I just ask that you be respectful. Now, let's have the first question.\" A woman, in a very nice and very expensive looking black pant suit, stands just to the right of me. She points to a man in the middle of the crowd who then begins to speak. As the man speaks so does the nicely dresses women. She must be the translator. \"Prince Edvard, you seem to have changed quite a bit since the last time we saw you. Can you just talk a bit about what has brought about that change?\" \"Something quite significant changed my life. I met the most amazing woman and fell in love. Also a person learns a lot about themselves when living outside of their comfort zone. Not only was I in a different country but I was also in a university setting without my family resources.\" \"Paige, can you give us some background knowledge about yourself.\" The man spoke easily in English. I smile at the reporter. \"Sure. I was born and raised in Wisconsin. My dad is a dairy farmer and my mom is a homemaker. I have two older brothers. I was going to university to receive my undergraduate degree in medicine. I love cats and my favorite flavor of ice cream is butter pecan.\" There were scattered chuckles from the reporters in the room. Another reporter was the selected to ask a question. \"This is a two part question for Paige. Do you plan to continue to get your medical degree? If so, how do you believe this could affect your future royal duties?\" \"That's a great question,\" I say. \"As of this moment, my medical degree has been put on hold. Right now I want to focus on this part of my life. The reason I wanted to become a doctor was because I wanted to help people. I still want to help people but I will be able to effect positive change in people's lives as The Crown Princess. I no longer need a medical degree to achieve my goals to help people.\" After this question, the one's to follow came in quick succession. \"This is a question for you, Prince Edvard. What are some of the qualities that made you fall for Paige and what are some of the characteristics that will make her a good Princess?\" Eddie turns and looks me strait in the eye for a moment. He then turns his head back to look out at the room full of reporters as he says, \"Paige is kind and warm. She faces challenges head on. She understands how important my country and my people are to me. She keeps me grounded and present. She fights for what she believes in and for what is right. Her eyes squint in the corners when she smiles and laughs. She covers her eyes when something scary comes on the television. I feel relaxed and at ease in her presence.\" Then he looks back at me for another second as if to compose his thoughts once again. \"She will be a great Queen because she is the most amazing woman a man could ever ask for. On top of all the reasons I love her, having her in my life makes me a better man. The people trust me to do my job as the next King of Denmark. Trust that we, our partnership, can make this the best rule possible. Together we will do what is right for our country and what is best for our people. We are committed to each other and to our duty as future monarchs.\" All the way through this little speech of his, my emotions, happy tears mostly, began to overwhelm me. Eddie turns back to look at me and quickly brushes a single tear from my cheek. \"Paige, do you plan on becoming a Danish citizen?\" \"We haven't talked a lot about it but yes, I do. I want to rule my own people and the only way to do that is to become a citizen. Also I don't want people to believe that I am any different from them. I might be marrying the Prince but I am not really any different than anyone else. I was born, grew up, and fell in love just like everyone else. I just happened to fall in love with someone who is in a position of power.\" \"Will your ability to rule be diminished by the fact that you are not of noble or royal birth?\" \"I think the circumstances in which I was born will affect the way I will rule but not diminish my ability to do so. I think I was raised in a way that will make me an effective ruler. Hard work, kindness, and determination are the foundation of my upbringing. My parents worked hard to instill these values within me. I think they are also important qualities for someone in a position in power to have.\" \"Paige, is it possible for us to see and maybe get a few pictures of your engagement ring?\" I chuckle and answer simply, \"There is not an engagement ring. He has not officially asked me to marry him… yet. We have talked about it and he has asked me to be his wife but he just hasn't had much time to pop the question with a ring.\" I look over at Eddie and see a gleam in his eye and a small smile on his lips. I just give a small smile in return. I could hear some laughter out in the room. \"What are some of the goals that you might want to accomplish in your first years as rulers? This question is for you both.\" I glance at Eddie and he gives me an almost imperceptible nod. \"Well, as I said before, I was studying to become a doctor. I would like to raise money and awareness for Doctors Without Borders. They always need help with anything from funding to volunteer support. Also Queen Rosalind has been working on the construction of the new wing of the hospital which opens in a few months. I would love to do similar work to that. That is my long term goals but I hope to start them quickly after our marriage.\" I give the press a smile and look again at Eddie. He smiles and then begins to speak, \"I do not have a plan. I know that might sound like I might have said before but I have a reason. I have goals but I just don't have any idea what will be happening here and in the world when my rule begins. My goal is to work as hard as I can to uphold my family's work and legacy. I just want to be the best King that I can be but I do not yet know what that will entail.\" \"Prince Edvard, would you like to make a comment on the ring situation? I am positive my readers will want to know.\" I smile a cheeky smile and wait for his reply. \"I am having a ring custom made for Paige. It will take some time before it is perfect. Also I want to make sure that I make the whole night as romantic as possible. I want it to be a night that neither of us will ever forget.\" He answers and then looks over at me. He winks and butterflies start to dance in my stomach. This kind, amazing, and funny man is the best that I could ever ask for. I am a very lucky lady. I couldn't help but lean over and give him a small kiss on the cheek. When I move away from him, I notice that I left some lipstick in my wake. We both laugh as I wipe it from his cheek as the flashbulbs go wild again. \"How are you and Princess Arabella getting along, Paige?\" \"I feel as if she is already my sister. She is such a sweet and smart person and I could not ask for a better sister. I have two brothers back home that I love and who are wonderful but I have always wanted a sister.\" \"Your highness, have you meet Paige's family yet?\" \"Yes I have meet her family. I spent the American holiday Thanksgiving with Paige and her family on their farm. It was a very good trip. I learned a lot about Paige, her family, and where she comes from. Her parents were very warm and welcoming. Her brothers are both older than her and are very protective of her. The three of us had quite a bit of fun together. It was also when I told Paige who I am and who I will become.\" \"Are you saying that Paige did not know you are royal? You hid your identity from everyone?\" \"Yes,\" answered Eddie, \"I wanted the normal university experience. People have always treaded me differently because of my status. I wanted to be a normal student with normal problems. That is part of the reason that I went all the way to America. The people there do not know me.\" I look from Eddie back to the reporters. \"Paige, did you feel any anger or were you upset over the fact that he kept this large part of his identity from you?\" I shake my head and answer frankly. \"No there is not and there never was. It took me some time to process it all but I understand why he did what he did. I cannot imagine what it was like for him, growing up with an entire country watching you. He was in the spotlight since the day he was born. It must have been extremely difficult for him, for anyone in a similar situation, to make mistakes. Life as a young adult is about making mistakes and finding yourself. Edvard was not able to do that. He could never wholly trust anyone around him because he did not know if people wanted to be Prince Edvard's friend or Eddie's friend. I was Eddie's friend and partner long before I was Prince Edvard's girlfriend. I got to know the person under the crown not just his public face. I will be grateful forever for the privilege that I have to know both men.\" \"Paige, what do you mean by the \"man under the crown\"?\" \"I mean that everyone has a personal and a professional life. For some, the line between the two can become very thin. In the case of public figures, the population at large believe that public figure gives up their right to a personal life, that the public figure gives up their right to privacy when they step into the spotlight. The people get Prince Edvard, the rebellious and angry kid he was before, and I get Eddie, the man that reads me Shakespeare, tucks his sister into bed, and laughs with my brothers around my family's dining room table. That is all I mean.\" I hope that everyone understands what I mean. There are some parts of Eddie that only his family, and now I, get to see. I glance over as Eddie and I see him nodding his head. He then chimes in, \"There is more to me than the title and the flash. Not many people want to know the person under all that. People want to say that they had lunch with the Prince or went on a date with a Prince. Often they do not want to have drinks with Eddie and go to the movies. But I get to be both people with Paige because she met the man before she saw the title. Are there any more pressing questions?\" \"Just one more question to you Paige. Was the choice, to leave your life behind and become our future Queen, an easy one to make?\" I think for a moment before answering seriously, \"No. The choice to come here and live this life was not easy.\" I glance over at Eddie before continuing. \"We have not been together for long, so that was something that I took into consideration. Also, the idea of changing my whole life to fit into someone else's life is a hard one. I am an independent woman and I had a plan for my life. I think some people might believe that I was giving up my life to fit into Edvard's life and that is not the case. I had to consider what this would mean for my family and friends as well as Edvard's family and his whole country. The choice to become a Princess and someday Queen is not something that I took lightly. I wasn't just thinking about what was right for my life but I was also thinking about what was best for all of you. I know Edvard will make a great King someday and it was hard to try and see myself at his side.\" A huge smile lit my face at the thought of our children running through the halls of this large house, filling it with love, happiness, and excitement. \"In the end, I realized that the pros outweighed the cons by quite a bit. I love Edvard and he thinks that I can do this well. Now all I have to do is prove him right\". There was a brief moment of shuffling and movement before Eddie continued, \"Now then, I am sure that more questions will arise but until then, thank you all and have a wonderful day. Paige and I will stand for a few more photos and then we must go\". Eddie stood easily from his spot on the bench and held out his hand for me. I accepted his help out of the seat. We stood before the small couch and smiled for the cameras for another five minutes and then we moved back through the doors we came in through. Hi everyone. I am so happy to be back! Please read and review. Also please go check out my profile page because there is a lot more information there for all of you. I will be posting a poll right after this and to get all that information you will need to go to my profile too! Thank you so much and I hope you are all doing well! ~morningglory11[Chapter 9] Chapter 9: First Steps We both take a deep breath and begin to walk back toward my sweet of rooms. The walk is silent except the sound of our feet hitting the stone floor. The silence is wonderful and the warmth of Eddie's hand is beyond comforting. When we get to the doors to my sweet, Søren is standing before the doors waiting for me. When we are standing before him, Søren bows his head to us both and then addresses me. \"Miss Paige. I have a few women waiting for an interview. They are all candidates for your personal assistant. Just someone to keep your schedule and keep track of everything for you. I know this wasn't on the original schedule I gave you this morning but Her Majesty the Queen insisted that this task be completed within the next few days. I assumed you would want to start interviewing people as soon as possible.\" I node and hold out my hand. He gives me all ten of the rather thick applications. I let go of Eddie's hand and nod to Søren to open the door to my sweet. I walk in and feel both men follow me into the sitting area of my room. Eddie sits in the chair next to me and flips on the television. He turns the volume so low that I hardly notice that it is on. I quickly scan through the applications. I only find I want to meet five out of the ten applicants but I have a whole afternoon and they all sound qualified. I proceed to stack the application in the order that I want to meet them. I hand the stack to Søren and he quickly copies the order down onto his tablet. He gives a quick not to both Eddie and I, then exits the room. Eddie looks over at me and smiles. I can feel the pride flowing from him and I can't help but feel like I am doing well here in the palace, so far. Eddie stands and comes over to the couch that I am sitting on. He leans down and gives me a passionate kiss. I wrap my hand around his neck and the other around his side. After a few minutes of me trying to pull him down to sit with me, he pulls away from the kiss. With a pant, he says, \"If I don't leave now, your fist applicant is going to get quite a show.\" We both laugh. \"I have to go anyway because I have a meeting with my Dad,\" he continues. We both stand and I walk with Eddie to door. He kisses me one last time and tells me, \"The room across the hall is an office. I think you will like it. I will find Søren and tell him that you will be using it for the interviews. If you want to.\" He sounded so unsure of what my answer would be. I just laugh quietly and kiss him on the cheek. \"I would love to use it and I am sure that it will be perfect. Thank you Eddie\". He never needs to be unsure with anything having to do with me. He leaves then and I briskly walk across the hall to the office. The walls are a cool grey with a faint filigree pattern. The windows, which nature light floods through, frame the desk and are swathed in a light satin fabric. The desk drawers face into the sitting area as if to invite the possibility of a more informal work environment. The desk top computer is on the table that ran the back wall of the office. A comfortable deep blue swivel chair spans the space between the computer table and the desk which increased my work surface. The low oval seat and the two white chairs create a nice sitting space in the foreground of the office. I could imagine my life in this room. I could see Eddie sitting in one of the white chairs reading as I work. I could see Ari and I having tea and talking for hours. I could picture our daughter sitting on her knees before the blue seat using it as a table to color in a coloring book as our son sat opposite her running a car around in circles. It is perfect for me and for the next Queen of Denmark. I sit behind the desk and find the pile of applications already there. Either Eddie and Søren were conspiring about the office, or Søren knows Eddie very well. I open the first file and begin to review before the interview begins. A nock on the door pulls me from my reading. \"Enter\", I say in an easy tone. The door opens and in walks Søren with a women just behind him. He bows his head and the women preforms a small curtsy. It seemed awkward to her and she is not the only one. I am still not used to that way people here treat me but its part of the job. I stand and gesture for the women to come in and for Søren to get out. \"Oh, Søren can you please have some tea brought up for me once we are done with this first interview?\" I ask. He gives a small nod and closes the door behind him. I look back at the women and smile at her. \"Please, sit\". I instruct with a gesture to the blue seat. She waits for me to sit before seating herself, so at least she knows the etiquette. I ask her for her name and match it with the file I was reading. We talk about her school and why she would like to work for me. I also ask about her and her hobbies and where she currently works. When we are finished I escort her to the door of my office and open the door. \"I have several more applicants to talk to today but I will have someone get back to you about the job as soon as possible. I was very nice to meet you\", I say. She curtsies once again and opens the door to find Søren standing outside to walk her back out of the palace. The tea was brought up then and I set the trey on the computer table behind my chair. I made myself a cup and took my seat again. The remaining nine interviews proceed much the same. Some of the women that I didn't think I would like, I did like and vice versa. I am glad that I met with them all. I gather up the applications of the three women I like the best and walked back to my suite. Only a few minutes later, Søren enters my suite, after a nock, with my lunch on a tray and the Queen on his tail. I stand a curtsy. Søren bows to the queen and nods to me before leaving the room. The Queen looks around my room and spots the dress that I am going to wear tonight on the back of the door. She looks at it and then moves to look through the closet. She pulls out a grey dress with a flowing skirt and three quarter length sleeves. She then says, \"This dinner is formal but not that formal. Wear this with some simple black heals and black jewelry. That will be just fine.\" I nod and reply, \"Thank you, your Majesty. I will.\" She gives a small nod and the leaves the room. Well that was odd, but I will go with it. I hope that this is her showing me that she approves of what I did at the press conference. I look at the clock that is hanging on the wall of my suite and see that it is one thirty and I feel my stomach growl. I move the lunch tray to the coffee table and sit. I flip the television on and find the music channels. I select the classic music station and turn the volume down until it was only a soft hum in the background. I open the files and re-read them as I eat the simple salad, creamy potato soup, and garlic bread. It was all so delicious! Some of the best food I have eaten. After finishing my food, I sit back into the couch and bring the files with me. The door opens and Eddie walks in and sits with me. I reach over and set my hand on Eddie's leg and keep reading. Eddie begins to run his fingers over my hand. He lifted my hand from my leg and flipped it over. He then began to rub circles on the inside of my wrist. He lifts my hand higher in the air and kisses where his hand left off. He started to run his kisses up my arm toward my elbow. I had stopped reading when his lips fist touched my skin. I lean my head back and enjoy the feeling of love and care radiating off of Eddie. He kissed the inside of my elbow and then jumped to my neck. He placed a single kiss on my neck, then one on my jaw, another on my cheek, and finally a heated kiss on my lips. As we continue to kiss, I slide the hand that had started this whole thing through the hair at the back of his neck and use my hold to secure his mouth to mine. When we break apart from the kiss, we just sit with our foreheads and noses resting against one another. I smile and say quietly, \"You are so distracting. I hope this won't be a pattern for the future. Nothing good will come of it for our people.\" I giggle a little as I finish speaking. He laughs too and smiles at me. We both pull back and Eddie asks me, \"How did the interviews go?\" \"They went well. I have it narrowed down to three but I think I know who I want to higher. Her name is Hannah. She is thirty four years old. She is married and has two kids who are seven and four. She has worked with a few other noble families. She has an undergraduate degree in marketing and a master's degree in public relations. She was very energetic and she seemed willing to jump in with both feet. She just made me feel like I could trust her. She has been run through all of the security protocols and everything checks out. Oh, and she speaks English very well. I know that seems like something that wouldn't matter because I speak Danish pretty well but if she is going to be communicating with my friends and family, I want her to be comfortable doing so in English.\" \"I trust your judgement. You could always have a two week trial period, if you think you need one. But I think you have this completely under control.\" \"I think I am going to higher her. I think that the other two are just as qualified but I feel comfortable with Hannah. I won't mind spending time with her and she reminds me of my mom. She is best for the job,\" I tell Eddie. \"Okay then,\" Eddie replies as he pulls me into his arms. We lay there for a minute before Eddie looked down at me and says, \"I saw Ari a few minutes ago. She wanted me to ask you if you would like to go riding with her.\" \"I would love to but I need to call Hannah and get ready for tonight. I also need to do a little research about some charities. Do you think that Søren will be able to get a full list of all of the charities that your family works with? I want to get started as soon as I can but I don't want to step on someone's toes.\" \"I am sure that Søren can get it for you if you need it today but I bet Hannah can get it for you when she starts.\" \"I think I need it today. But I will have Hannah help me do the research when she starts. I am going to need to do research on all of the charities that you are all already doing work for as well as find a few that need me to start helping them as soon as possible.\" \"You are so kind,\" Eddie tells me. \"Sometimes I can't believe how lucky I am to have you in my life to remind me what is important. When you say things like this, I know you will always remind me that the people we serve are the most important thing. I mean outside of you.\" \"Well, when you say things like that I can't help but fall in love with you more. What girl wouldn't want to be told how important she is to the man she loves?\" I kiss Eddie again and then there was a knock on the door. We pull apart and I say, \"Come in.\" Søren enters and then says, \"His Majesty, the King would like to speak to you, Miss. Paige.\" Please read and review! I am bad about reviewing the stories I read but it does make a difference in my motivation to keep writing. Again, if you are a returning reader I would suggest going back to the beginning to catch back up because it has been years since I updated regularly. If you are interested in seeing the webpage I made that contain my inspiration pictures, please let me know in an email. You can find my address on my profile. Also I will be posting a poll that requires a look at the webpage so if you are interested in that, let me know also. Thank you so much for your continued support and inspiration! ~morningglory11 ","Summary":" BECOMING ROYAL Nothing in this story belongs to me. This is what I think should have happened after"},{"Movie":"Prince & Me","Title":"Prince&Me; 5- A Royal Baby","Author":"waterlooroadlover2012","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9406268","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Well, there wasn't any of these sort of fanfictions when I looked, so I decided to write me own Prince and Me 5, with my own storyline :) Disclaimer: I don't own anything in the Prince and Me unless I create my own characters, everything else is not mine:( Chapter 1 After arriving late back to the palace on Monday night, Paige and Eddie (a.n. I shall call them Paige and Eddie not Queen Paige every time etc..) were exhausted and awoke late following morning. Eddie felt Paige stir from her position lying in his arms, and bent down to kiss her gently on the lips, which she responded to. 'Morning Paige,' 'Morning Eddie, that was-' Paige didn't get to finish her sentence as she jumped out of bed and ran over to their en-suite bathroom, throwing up into the toilet. Luckily Eddie was close behind her, after she had gotten so quickly out of the bed, so he was there holding her hair back and rubbing her back. When Paige felt better, she brushed her teeth and Eddie pulled her into a hug. 'I'm so sorry Eddie,' Paige whispered. 'Why are you sorry? You can't help it, but do you want me to send a doctor in?' 'I am a doctor Eddie,' Paige laughed. 'But I am feeling better now, it's really strange!' 'Okay, as long as you are well, I don't want you to be feeling ill, it is my duty to care for you, as I am your husband, please let me know immediately if you feel ill again.' 'Okay your majesty!' 'Oi missy, don't call me that, oh right I can call you it back!' they both laughed, and Eddie pulled Paige in for a passionate kiss. Their moment was interrupted by a knock at their door. 'Your royal highnesses, may I come in?' It was Zoren's unmistakable voice. Eddie and Paige put their robes on and Eddie opened the door. 'Zoren.' 'Sir, you have an urgent visitor, you, and Queen Paige, must be dressed in formal wear, and meet me in half an hour in the library.' 'Okay, Zoren, who is it?' Zoren was already walking away. 'I can only tell you that she's a princess, and it's not Arabella.' Zoren was at the end of the corridor by this time so Eddie could not ask him any more questions. Paige turned to Eddie. 'Eddie, why do I have a feeling that it's Princess Kirsten?' 'Paige, I'm having the same feeling,' Eddie saw the fear flash through her eyes. 'Paige, she can't do anything. You proved yourself to the parliament and well, I don't know what got into me, thinking that marrying her would solve things, but that's all in the past, we've had our honeymoon and been to our first wedding together, Paige my life is perfect, I've got everything I want. I love you so much Paige.' 'Oh Eddie, you know me so well! It has been amazing. I love you too Eddie!' 'One thing Paige, if you do feel unwell, the same feeling as this morning, just nudge me and we'll get you sorted out.' Eddie cupped Paige's face in his hands. 'Promise?' 'Promise.' Eddie kissed Paige gently. 'Right King Edvard, if it is Princess Kirsten, I need to look beautiful and I've only got 25 minutes to get ready, so I must get ready as my maids are having a day off.' 'Okay gorgeous, I'm going to head off to get suited and booted, I'll see you in here in 20 minutes.' 'Okay, thanks Eddie!' Eddie kissed her on the head then went to get ready himself. 20 minutes later, Paige was in a stunning silk dress, in a gorgeous shade of deep pink. Her naturally curly hair was straightened and her wedding rings sparkled in the light. Eddie stepped back into the room and gasped; 'Paige you look...just wow!' And came over and kissed her lightly. 'Well you don't scrub up to bad yourself!' She laughed and returned the kiss. 'Ready to go and face the music?' 'Yes, but I'm still hoping and praying that it isn't Kirsten because I don't want her to do anything that may cause you to be sick again. Remember you promised what you'd do if you felt sick!' 'Yes Eddie, I do, but we're going to be late for Zoren.' 'Okay then,' Eddie kissed Paige once more and took her hand in his and lead her down to the library to meet the awaiting Zoren. I purposely made it short, just to see if you guys would like it, give you a taster really, normally my chapters I write are longer. Please review! I need to know whether you like it or not to whether I carry it on :)[Chapter 2] Thank you for the reviews!:) Chapter 2 'Hi Zoren,' Paige said brightly. 'Hello your majesties. You look very smart for our visitor.' 'Why thank you Zoren.' Replied Paige. 'Can we go in Zoren?' Asked Eddie. 'Are you sure you want to?' 'Yes we are sure,' 'Okay then.' Zoren sighed and opened the door into the library. Paige and Eddie gasped at what they saw. Kirsten. 'Oh how lovely to see you Edvard!' Cried Kirsten. Eddie just stood there and pulled Paige in closer to him. 'Don't you look handsome in your suit?' 'Hi Kirsten,' Eddie managed to choke out. 'Who's this? Oh yes I do know her, she's that farm girl...' Kirsten said. Paige felt Eddie tighten his grip around her. 'That one from Wisconsin, the one who stole my King from me?' 'Excuse me Kirsten thats my wife you are talking about and I'd appreciate it if you didn't talk like that about Paige. And it's Queen Paige to you. You are in our country so you abide by our rules.' 'Oh dear Edvard,' Kirsten smiled slyly. Paige just put her hand on Eddie to prevent him from doing anything he'd regret later. 'Since when did you become all uptight?' Eddie felt Paige's hand on his chest and looked down at her, she gave him a reassuring smile. 'Kirsten, I became 'uptight' as you put it, when you finished interfering in mine and Paige's lives, and I didn't want anything to break us up again. Anyway why are you here? What do you want?' 'Firstly lets have a cup of tea or coffee, MAID!' 'Kirsten that maid you just called is mine and its her day off, leave her be, and you be patient.' Paige stated. 'Ooh someone's a bit tetchy today.' 'Well it doesn't help that we've just got back from Sangu and we're exhausted and you turn up here unannounced!' Snapped Eddie. Another maid had brought Kirsten's tea and Paige's and Eddie's coffees. Paige's was about to take a sip when the smell overcame her, causing her to feeling nauseous, so quickly got up and walked as quickly as she could to the nearest bathroom with Eddie hot on her heels, knowing exactly where she was going, leaving behind a fuming Kirsten. When Eddie had got to their bathroom, for Paige had increased her power walking to a sprint, he found her next to the toilet with tears streaming down her face. She brushed her teeth before she realised Eddie was there and he pulled her into a hug and kissed her softly, trying to calm her down. 'Eddie I'm so sorry,' Paige said between sobs. 'Paige don't worry about it, it's only Kirsten but I think I might send the doctor for you' 'Why don't we go back to Kirsten and find out what she wants?' 'Okay, you're a bit wobbly on your legs,' 'Yeah that does happen and I feel weaker today anyway...' 'Right okay then!' Eddie cried and picked her up bridal style. 'Eddie, Eddie put me down!' Paige laughed. 'No. I'll carry you to the doors,' he laughed back. 'Okay fine then my king, if you insist!' 'Good good!' Then Paige and Eddie headed down the corridor where a tired Zoren greeted them. 'Queen Paige are you feeling better?' 'Yes thank you Zoren, my legs were a bit wobbly so Eddie decided to carry me!' She laughed again. Eddie put Paige down and put his arm around her waist to steady her. 'Zoren, is Kirsten still in there? Why is she here?' Asked Eddie. 'Your majesty, she is still in there, and I don't know why she's here, I got called back this morning.' 'Okay thanks Zoren,' Eddie turned to Paige. 'Are you are you are alright to go in and face Kirsten,' 'Yes so long as I'm with you I'm fine,' replied Paige. Eddie leant in for a kiss, and Paige did the same. Zoren cleared his throat loudly. 'Pardon the interruption, but Princess Kirsten is getting rather impatient I've been told.' 'Oh dear,' replied Eddie, 'Come on darling, we'll go back in now,' 'Okay, we need to find out what she wants and please steer me away from coffee!' Eddie and Paige were met by Kirsten looking ready to explode. Paige slowly walked over and sat down, whilst being supported by Eddie. When Paige was comfortable, Eddie sat down next to her and pulled Paige in close to him to make sure that Paige helps him to keep his temper and for him to be able to reassure Paige that he wasn't going to do anything stupid. Meanwhile Kirsten was pacing around the room, looking like her lid on her temper was going to blow any second! 'WHERE ON EARTH DID YOU GO? I WAS TALKING TO YOU AND THEN YOU.' She yelled, pointing a finger at Paige. 'YOU RAN OFF, AND MY DEAR EDVARD RAN AFTER YOU!' 'First things first Kirsten, I am NOT 'your' Edvard, if I'm anyone's Edvard, I'm Paige's, like she's MY wife.' responded Eddie. 'Why Paige ran off is none of your business Kirsten, what we'd like to know is why you are here.' 'My reason for coming, is to come and be with you Edvard, because I'm supposed to be your Queen not the farm girl from Wisconsin, who is absolutely rubbish at being your wife and Queen.' After hearing this, Paige went sort of pale, and a tear rolled down her cheek, which was not missed by Eddie. 'Kirsten, you are not having me back! I am married to Paige! Nothing will ever change that, even when I was with you, I still loved Paige! Gosh, I don't know what was going through my head when I thought I could marry you!' retorted Eddie, pulling Paige closer to him, to try and comfort her. 'Edvard. That girl there,' Kirsten said, pointing at Paige. 'Is from no royal blood. I however, am. She has no idea how to be a Queen, she is a farm girl, for the life of God! Her life was started on a stinky smelly farm. Me and you were brought up in extravagant palaces. See the difference do you? Farms, palaces, a Queen is not born on a farm.' Everything got too much for Paige hearing all of this. She ran as fast as she could out of the library, again, and into hers and Eddie's room, collapsed onto the bed and cried into the pillow. Eddie was furious with Kirsten. 'Kirsten you are never to return to this palace again, do you understand? Zoren please get security to escort Kirsten off of the premises, I have to go and see to my wife.' He said glaring at Kirsten. 'Yes your majesty. Miss Kirsten please follow me.' Zoren left the room and Kirsten flounced after him. Eddie ran in the same direction as Paige did earlier, and got to their room in record time. He found Paige lying face down on the bed, crying her eyes out. It killed Eddie seeing Paige like this. Eddie walked over to the bed, pulled Paige up from her position and they both stood up. Paie collapsed into Eddies arms,still crying, but glad that Eddie was there. 'Paige, Paige, darling, what Kirsten said isn't true, believe me, the country loves you, my parents love you, and I love you the most Paige, please don't believe anything she says, Kirsten is jealous of us.' Eddie reassured her. 'Eddie, it's just hurt me so much, and even with the loophole in the law, she still can't understand it, can she?' Paige replied. 'Paige, just look at me, I love you and you are an amazing Queen. Okay gorgeous?' 'Oh Eddie, I love you so much! But I'm really tired from all of this, not really in the mood to do anything.' 'Well lets get comfy and watch a film in bed or something?' 'Yeah okay, we're watching The Notebook though.' Paige laughed and Eddie mocked groaning and put his head in his hands. 'Oh Paige, that again? Ah don't worry, as long as it makes you happy!' Eddie grinned and kissed Paige passionately. Hope you liked it! Please leave a review![Chapter 3] Thank you so much for the reviews! Chapter 3 A couple of hours later, the film Paige and Eddie were watching had finished and Paige had fallen asleep in Eddie's arms. Eddie was stroking her luscious blonde hair, twirling it around in his fingers. Paige had a cute little smile on her face, causing Eddie to smile too. Paige sighed and snuggled deeper into Eddie's chest, enjoying being in his arms. Eddie was about to fall asleep himself, even though it was only 4pm, because he was exhausted and Kirsten's visit, well that was just stupid. As he closed his eyes, there was a sharp knock on the door. Paige stirred in his arms, but Eddie laid her down gently on the bed as he got off it, to see who was at the door, picking his robe up on the way. Eddie opened the door and Zoren was standing there. 'Zoren?' 'Your majesty, there's been...' Zoren was interrupted by Eddie. 'Hang on a minute, Paige is asleep, she's exhausted.' Eddie stepped outside of the door. 'What's the problem?' 'I don't know how to put this, but, Princess Kirsten has said something to the press, and basically they're all gathering outside of the palace. We are unsure of what has been said but you may want to hold a press conference.' 'WHAT?!' Eddie exploded, forgetting about Paige. 'Eddie what's going on?' Paige asked sleepily from their bedroom. 'Oh dear, I forgot about Paige,' Eddie said to Zoren. 'Hang on right there.' He turned and went into their room. 'Paige, put your robe on, you need to hear this and it's easier if Zoren tells you because I'm stressed.' Paige looked at Eddie strangely, but went and got her robe, and Eddie called Zoren in. 'I'm sorry to disturb you, your highness but Princess Kirsten has provided the press with some information, which we do not know of yet, but is most likely to be false, however the press are all gathering outside the front of the palace, so you and Edvard may want to hold a press conference.' Paige was more awake now, and as Zoren was speaking, her sparkling blue eyes, darkened with anger but she managed to remain calm. 'Thank you Zoren for alerting us, we will hold a press conference at 6pm sharp tonight. Please let the press know this.' 'Ideal Queen Paige, just ideal, I will alert them immediately.' And with that he departed. 'Eddie, why does she hate me so much?' asked Paige. 'I have no idea, but you are an amazing queen and wife, I detest Kirsten from the bottom of my heart. Ignore her. I will do everything in my power to stop her from entering this country again.' Paige had tears in her eyes. 'Thank you Eddie,' she whispered. Eddie lent in and gave her a passionate kiss. When they broke apart, Paige said; 'Right why don't we go and have tea or something because I don't think we had breakfast or lunch and I'm quite hungry!' 'Okay, do you want to stay in our robes or get properly changed?' 'Lets just stay in our robes, I'm not in the mood to change yet!' laughed Paige. 'Right I'll send a message to the kitchens for them to prepare a meal for us then!' A little while later, Eddie and Paige had finished their tea and were starting to get ready. Paige had just started to do her make up when Eddie came up behind her and pulled her into a hug. 'What was that for?' asked Paige. 'Just wanted to let you know, whatever Kirsten has said, we will deny it and I love you.' 'Love you too, now I would like to get ready and you need to get a suit on again,' Paige laughed. 'Okay my darling.' Eddie replied and kiss Paige on the lips. Paige broke off the kiss. 'Now go!' she laughed, pointing at the door. Eddie laughed and went off. Eddie was in his suit, 'Again...' he thought crossly, and headed back into the room he and Paige shared. Paige was sat down on their bed, putting her heels on. He crept up behind her and hugged her from behind. He felt Paige tense in his arms so he spun her around and kissed her. When she had realised that it was only Eddie she relaxed into his embrace, feeling the nerves in her stomach calm down slightly. 'Right are you ready for this?' Eddie asked. 'No.' Paige replied. There was a pause, then she laughed. 'No really, I'm not sure what the press have been told but I do know that I hate Kirsten from the bottom of my heart.' 'Paige darling, I'm here and I'll be with you the whole time, I don't know what Kirsten has said, but it's bound to be lies, so we'll deny them and tell them the truth.' 'Okay, I trust you Eddie on this, I have never experienced something like this before, and I don't know how to react really!' Paige said, but then there was a knock at the door, which Eddie opened, and standing on the other side was his mother, Rosalind. 'Mother what are you doing here?' asked Eddie. 'Zoren called, I came to reassure Paige.' Rosalind replied simply. 'Thank you, thank you so much,' Eddie said happily. 'Not a problem,' Rosalind said. She moved over and sat on the bed, also motioning for Paige to sit down as well. 'Now Paige, I know that you have never come across a situation like this before, so what you need to do is, is to keep your temper and to help Edvard keep his as well, and what Kirsten said is most likely to be untrue so you need to answer any questions the press have and deny any rumours which you know are not true. Good luck Paige, and Edvard, reassure the public that what Kirsten said is not true.' 'Thank you Mother,' replied Edvard. 'Yes thank you,' Paige echoed. Rosalind smiled and left their room, so that they had some time alone. 'Right shall we get this over and done with?' asked Eddie. 'Yes, before I back out!' laughed Paige. 'Okay, let's go and find Zoren.' Eddie clasped Paige's hand in his and they went out of their room to find a tired looking Zoren waiting in the corridor. 'Zoren we are ready, are the press here?' 'Yes they are your majesty, they are all ready and waiting.' 'Right, Paige, lets do this darling,' Eddie said to Paige. And with that Zoren opened the doors to the awaiting press, for the King and Queen to discover what Princess Kirsten has said from outside of the palace.

Can you guys please let me know whether you prefer: Shorter chapters that are updated more frequently (1000 words or under) OR Longer chapters that are updated once or twice every two-three weeks, depending on school and swimming? THANK YOU :)))[Chapter 5] Thanks for the reviews guys! I have decided to write shorter chapter 1000 words, and hopefully update them every week or every fortnight, unless I'm busy or something with swimming! As they stepped into the conference room, they were immediately blinded by lights, despite the efforts of their security, trying to back the paparazzi off. Many shouts could be heard, but could not be properly deciphered. Eventually Paige and Eddie got to the front of the mob and Eddie quieted them down. 'Hello, we have heard that you have some questions for us, so please allow us to try to answer them.' Eddie said. 'Your highness,' one of the paparazzi, who was standing at the front, asked, 'Is it true that you slapped Princess Kirsten of Norway?' Eddie's professional face had a shock look pass over it. 'No that is not true at all,' replied Eddie. 'Queen Paige, is it true that you called Princess Kirsten, and I quote here, 'A bitch who doesn't deserve anyone,' another asked. 'No, that is most certainly not true.' Paige denied firmly. One shouted from the back, 'If that isn't true your majesties, then what did happen?' Paige and Eddie looked at eachother and by the looks on their faces, agreeing that they will tell the paparazzi the whole story. Eddie started: 'Basically this morning we were woken up by Zoren, who was supposed to be away, that a Princess was in the palace demanding to see us, and that it wasn't Arabella.' Paige continued; 'We had only just got back from Sangu late last night and we weren't due any meetings or visits until late afternoon. So as you can tell, we were very surprised to have Zoren knock on our door saying that there was someone at the palace. I haven't been feeling very well lately and I really do need my sleep at the minute.' 'So we got up, got ready and everything, and found out it was Kirsten. She started ordering maids around, like she owned the place, and the maid poured Paige and I a coffee each. When Paige had a sip of hers, she immediately felt nauseous. She quickly left the room, and I followed hot on her heels. When she was sorted we headed back to find Kirsten very angry.' Paige finished off; 'She was fuming. She shouted at me for 'stealing her king' away from her, and Kirsten also described me as a 'Farm girl who doesn't deserve to be Queen.'So Eddie told her she was mocking the Danish values and that she shouldn't treat the Danish Queen like that, and banned her from coming to the palace, but not from Denmark.' Eddie said; 'It was couple of hours later that we were told of rumors, but were not told of what the rumors were, that Princess Kirsten has told the press. We are very certain that none of these rumors are true so please believe us when we say this. Thank you for coming today.' A loud applause filled the room, and Paige and Eddie were escorted out of the press conference by their security guards. 'Eddie I think we should go and tell your parents what the rumors were, and let them know what we told the press.' Paige said to Eddie. 'Okay, but first...this.' Eddie stopped and kiss Paige gently on the lips. 'What was that for?' Paige whispered. 'For being amazing in there. Your first proper press conference about rumors that were about us, and you aren't feeling well at all. You were brilliant.' Eddie wrapped his arms around her and kissed her again. Paige broke off; 'Thank you Eddie, but we really do need to tell your parents- your mum is going to be wondering what's going on.' She laughed. 'Yes course darling, come on.' Eddie clasped his hand in hers and led Paige to his parents' quarters, where he knocked on the door and entered. 'Hello Mother, Father.' Eddie said. 'Edvard, Paige, how was the conference?' Rosalind asked, jumping right to the point. 'Well Kirsten had started rumors about Paige calling her a female dog and that I had slapped her round the face, when none of that had happened.' Eddie replied. 'So we explained what had happened, and then left the press to it.' Paige added. 'Ah right. well done Edvard, Paige you dealt with that very well.' Harald congratulated them in his deep voice. 'We just thought that we'd let you know what happened, but now we're going to go back to our room and catch up on some sleep.' Eddie said this part as Paige tried to cover a yawn, Eddie laughed. 'What?' Paige asked with an innocent look on her face. 'Don't worry,' Eddie kissed her forehead. 'See you tomorrow, we'll eat in our room tonight.' 'Okay bye darling, sleep well you two.' Rosalind replied. Paige and Eddie left the room, to head back to theirs, to settle down for the evening and relax. This chapter is shorter, but I wanted to try out a different way of writing my fics, please tell me if you like it this way or not:)) thank you![Chapter 6] Thanks for the reviews, and I'm not really sure why I'm getting a hate review for stealing an anonymous' idea, please can you log into your fanfiction account and private message me so we can sort this out, thank you. 'Paige, you won't stop yawning,' Eddie was saying as they headed back to their room. 'I'm sorry...' Paige replied, and then yawned again. 'Right, you're going to put your pyjamas on and then go to sleep, okay?' Eddie told her. 'Fine, as long as you sleep with me.' Paige responded. 'Okay, if it means you'll sleep, thats fine then. We'll get tea later after we've slept for a couple of hours.' Eddie was happy that he was going to get Paige to sleep, because he was getting worried, with her being exhausted and throwing up. 'Okay then.' Paige replied, trying to stifle a yawn. 'Come here.'Eddie said, and he lifted her up into his arms, and carried her bridal style back to their bedroom. This time Paige did not fight back to be put down because she was so exhausted, she just let him carry her. When they got to their room, Eddie put Paige down on their bed,where she put her pyjamas on whilst Eddie did as well, and then got under the covers. Eddie pulled her close to him, where she rested her head on his chest and quickly fell asleep. Eddie turned the lights out and fell asleep himself. A couple of hours later, Paige stirred in Eddie's arms. Eddie himself was already awake so was just holding Paige when he felt her stir. He kissed her head gently to let her know that he was still here. 'Eddie whats the time?' Paige asked sleepily. '9 o'clock my dear,' replied Eddie. 'Ah right, I actually feel quite hungry now,' Paige said. 'Oh right, I'll just head down to the kitchen and get them to make some food for us,' Eddie decided. 'Okay, see you in a bit,' replied Paige. Eddie put his robe on and went down to the kitchens. Meanwhile Paige ran to the bathroom and threw up, because she suddenly felt nauseous. She was brushing her teeth when she thought that she knew what could be wrong with her. Well it wasn't something wrong, but something right. Paige checked her calendar then realised that she was most likely right with what she thought. She called her maid in, gave her a note, and her maid replied simply; 'Yes Ma'am.' By this time Eddie had returned, with the news that dinner would be ready for them in half an hour. 'Paige, are you alright? You look a bit pale?' Eddie asked her. 'Yeah yeah I'm fine! Honest!' she added when she saw Eddie's look. 'Right...well I'm just going to go and sign some paperwork quickly, I've already got Zoren on my back for that..See you in a bit, you go and get into bed and read a book or something.' Eddie told Paige. 'Yeah, fine okay, I will do that then. See you in a while.' Paige replied, and Eddie kissed her gently on the lips and headed off to find Zoren and the dreaded paperwork. Meanwhile Paige's maid had returned with the item that Paige had wanted. Paige quickly thanked her maid and headed into her bathroom to take the test. When she had done it, she placed it on the counter, turned it over so she couldn't see it properly and set her timer for 3 minutes, and headed off to get a book. The three minutes was up quickly, and the timer went off. Paige turned the test over, and a smile crept over her face after seeing the result. She hid it in her wash bag, one of the places where Eddie never goes, and went and got into bed and started to read her book. 'Zoren, I'm pretty sure that you were meant to be on holiday.' Eddie complained after signing another piece of paperwork. 'Yes I was but I was called back in by the management team, your highness.' replied Zoren. 'What about Rayen?' asked Eddie. 'Well she's here, staying in a nearby hotel.' Zoren admitted. 'Why is she in a hotel? For goodness sake, ring her, or go and pick her up or whatever, and bring her here! She can stay in one of the guest rooms!' Eddie cried. 'Okay, okay your highness, here is your last piece of paperwork that you have to sign, then I shall do that your majesty.' 'Thank you Zoren,' Eddie quickly signed it and handed it back to Zoren. 'Now Zoren, off you go, and go and call Rayen, or go and get her!' 'Right your highness, I will do that and take her to one of your guest rooms!' Zoren walked off laughing. 'Bye Zoren,' Eddie waved to him, laughing also. Then Eddie headed back to his and Paige's room to find her sorting out the table to eat the food at. Eddie came up to her and enveloped her into a hug and kissed her on the head. Paige relaxed into his embrace, and sighed contentedly. 'Zoren has had Rayen staying in a hotel nearby since he's been back.' Eddie told Paige. 'Why didn't he bring her here?' asked Paige. 'I've sent him off to go and get her and bring her to the guest room.' replied Eddie. 'Okay we will go down and meet them now, because I reckon if this is Zoren we're talking about he'll be back any moment now.' 'Right okay, we look fine in what we're wearing, come on then.' Eddie took Paige's hand and led her down to the main door, to wait for Zoren and Rayen to arrive. Came to an end nicely there, hopefully you liked it! Will update soon and thank you for your kind messages of support! Also I'm back at school now and well this year's manic with school work and GCSEs so some updates could be slow! Thank you all once again!:)[Chapter 7] Wow over 6,000 views! It means a lot! Thank you so much! Eddie wrapped his arms around Paige's waist, resting them on her stomach. Paige smiled, because without even realising it, Eddie had rested his arms in the place where something was going to change their lives. She couldn't wait to tell him! He rested his head on her shoulder and Paige nestled into his embrace. 'I still can't work out why Zoren got Rayen to stay in a nearby hotel, that's baffling me a bit!' Paige said. 'Yeah, but at least she'll be here now.' replied Eddie. 'It was the least we could do.' 'Yeah, after everything she did for us in Sangu..Oh look there they are now!' Paige cried. 'Oh yes, there's Zoren, getting her bags, ever the gentlemen.' Eddie laughed. They both waved as Zoren and Rayen approached the main doors. 'Rayen, how nice it is to see you again.' Eddie greeted her. 'Yes, I can't believe that Zoren had you staying in a hotel.' Paige laughed. 'Welcome to our palace!' 'Do come in, Zoren will show you to your room, hopefully it'll be more comfortable than the hotel!' Eddie said. 'Hello your majesties, thank you for inviting me to stay in your palace.' Rayen replied. 'It's not a problem, I think you and Zoren could be off again in a couple of days, because that's when Zoren can take his leave.' Eddie told her. 'I can?' questioned Zoren who had just walked up the front steps. 'Yes Zoren you may, we have everyone else here to keep an eye on us and our schedules, so you and Rayen can go on holiday together.' Paige smiled. 'Thank you your majesties, thank you very much!' Zoren cried. 'It's fine, go on off you go. Take Rayen to her room Zoren.' Eddie told them. So off Zoren and Rayen went, leaving Paige and Eddie together. Eddie pulled Paige into his arms and whispered into her hair: 'How are you feeling darling?' 'Yeah I'm alright thanks, about that, I need to tell you something...'Paige trailed off. 'What?' Eddie asked, alarmed. 'Well I'm….' Paige was interrupted by Zoren who looked like he had just ran from the guest rooms to where they were standing. 'Your majesties, I'm afraid that you're going to have to get changed.' Zoren told them. 'What?' Paige asked. 'Why?' Eddie also asked. 'You have to go to the airport, to pick up someone...I do not know who it is, but her royal highness Rosaline told me to let you know. You'll be leaving in half an hour.' 'Oh my gosh! Okay, we'll be down here in half an hour, have my car ready please.' Eddie replied. 'Come on Paige, we need to go and get changed.' With that he took Paige's hand and they walked back to their room to change, once again. Half an hour later, Paige and Eddie were changed once again, Paige in a cream skirt that came to the knee and a pink jumper with ¾ length arms which hugged her tiny figure, Eddie in his suit but without a tie, and the top button undone. Eddie had a tie in his pocket just in case it was anyone formal they were picking up and he was down in the main entrance, whilst Paige was finishing off sorting herself out. 'Do we know yet who we're picking up Zoren?' Eddie asked. 'I do now,' Zoren replied, then whispered the answer in Eddie's ear. 'Oh, that's great! That's a great surprise!' Eddie said. 'Yes I know, your mother organised it for them.' Zoren answered. By this time Paige had come down, and was ready to go to the airport. 'Paige darling, you ready?' Eddie walked up to Paige's side and slipped his arm around her waist. 'Yes, I am now,' Paige replied. Eddie looked at Zoren. 'The car's outside ready and waiting.' The three of them left the through the main doors, and got into the car to go to the airport, to pick up the surprise visitors. However, no one had really noticed that the car was slightly bigger and had some more seats in it, but they were too tired to notice this. The airport was about an hours drive away, Eddie had his arm around Paige's shoulder and she was leaning her head on his shoulder, asleep. Eddie was just sat there watching Paige sleep, she look so gorgeous and content that he didn't want to wake her up when they arrived by the Palace's plane. 'Paige, Paige, we're here.' Eddie gently shook her awake and kissed her softly on the lips when her eyes fluttered open. 'Eddie why is the plane out?' Paige asked when she was more awake. 'You'll see, come on,' Eddie said whilst getting out of the car and Zoren opened the door for Paige to get out. Eddie came round to Paige's side of the car and put his arm around her waist and guided her to the bottom of the plane's steps. Of course the paparazzi were here, but Eddie and Paige couldn't figure out how they knew their King and Queen were coming to the airport. The paparazzi kept on shouting at Eddie and Paige, but they just stood their smiling and Paige was in Eddie's warm embrace. Soon there was some figures at the top of the steps, but all you could see at first was their shadows. Only Eddie had noticed this at first, Paige was talking to Zoren about something, whilst still standing in Eddie's embrace. Eddie smiled up to the couple walking down the steps and gently nudged Paige to get her attention. She turned around and took a moment before gasping with a smile on her face; 'Mum? Dad?' Hope you enjoyed the chapter! I don't think I'll be able to update for a week or two because the swim season has just started again and school is still manic so please bear with me! Thank you so much for your reviews![Chapter 8] Wow! Over 13,000 views! Thank you so so much!:') Thank you so much for the lovely reviews as well! They mean a lot:') Paige couldn't stop smiling. She couldn't believe that Rosaline had organised for her parents to come over to Denmark for a week. It was now late evening, and Eddie and Paige were in bed watching another film. So much has happened in one day! 'How are you feeling?' Eddie asked. 'Tired, not sick anymore,' Paige replied. 'Do you know what it was?' 'Yeah,' Paige replied. 'What?' Eddie looked alarmed. But before Paige had a chance to reply, there was a knock on the door, and Paige's mum poked her head around the door, 'Right we're off to bed now, just thought I'd let you two know that,' Paige jumped up to give her mum a kiss on the cheek, 'Okay night Mum, see you in the morning,' 'Yeah night,' Eddie echoed and Paige's mum left the room. 'So?' 'So what?' Paige giggled, knowing exactly what he meant. 'What exactly is going on?' 'Well Eddie, 9 months time...we could be having a massive event occur in our lives...' Paige started. 'What do you mean? I know it's not our anniversary or anything?' Eddie asked confused. Paige got up once again and withdrew a package from her drawer. 'Open this.' Eddie took the package and started to slowly open this. Inside there was a silver photo frame, with writing on it that said 'Daddy and me.' and was decorated with teddy bears. Eddie had tears in his eyes. 'Paige, does this mean...?' Eddie couldn't form the words in his mouth, he was so happy. 'Yes Eddie, I'm pregnant.' Paige beamed. Eddie dropped the frame on his lap and pulled Paige in and kissed her passionately on the lips. When they broke off, Eddie looked into Paige's eyes; 'This is going to be amazing, I love you Paige Morgan,' and he kissed her gently on the lips. 'We need to get a scan done for you, to find out how far along you are, but for now, keep it quiet and we'll only tell our parents when we definitely know everything.' 'Okay darling,' 'Actually let me make a phone call, we can have it tomorrow morning, because we might as well find out straight away.' Eddie told Paige, who smiled gratefully. Eddie returned a couple of moments later, '9 o'clock tomorrow morning, so that we can be out and back before the parents are up.' 'Okay,' Paige tried to stifle a yawn. 'Right you are going to bed, I don't care what you say you are going to bed now.' Eddie said seriously but laughed after. 'Fine,fine,I give in!' Paige laughed. Eddie looked her in the eyes again, before leaning in and kissing her on the lips. 'Now go to sleep.' … The next morning quickly came round. It was 8am when Eddie woke Paige from her deep slumber. 'Paige, you need to get up and get ready, the cars leaving in 45 minutes.' Eddie whispered in her ear. 'Mmmmm.' was Eddie's response from Paige. 'Paige, seriously you're going to have to get up, or else you'll be moaning at me!' Eddie laughed. 'Okay, right...' Paige sat up tiredly, and stretched. 'Fine, let me get dressed.' Half an hour later, Paige was changed into some skinny jeans and a pretty top, she couldn't be bothered with all of the official stuff and smart clothing and she knew when she got back, she'd get straight back into bed anyway! Eddie was also in jeans, so it didn't matter really. They headed down and quickly picked up a breakfast of croissants and jam, and they left the palace at 8.45am. Just before 9am, Paige and Eddie were sat down in the waiting room at their private clinic, waiting for Paige's name to be flashed up onto the screen. Eddie had his arms wrapped around Paige's shoulder, who kept on nearly falling asleep on him. Eddie was watching the screen, when Paige's name did flash up onto the screen, he gently awoke her, and they headed into their GPs room. 'Hello your highnesses, I didn't expect to see an appointment for you two this morning?' Dr Rowe asked. 'Yes well, it's for Paige really. But you need to keep this quiet until we announce it properly.' Eddie replied. 'I think I could be pregnant.' Paige stated. 'Okay, well please take this test for us, it will allow us to find out if you are, and how far along you are.' the doctor replied. He gave Paige the test and she headed into the bathroom to take it. Paige returned a couple of minutes later, and gave the test back to the doctor before sitting in Eddie's embrace. Eddie kissed the top of her head softly. The doctor cleared his throat and told Paige and Eddie the results: 'Indeed you are right Paige, you are pregnant! And you are about 6 weeks along, so you now have only just started experiencing the symptoms of morning sickness, some women experience it from the start but you were one of the lucky ones. I do want to do an ultrasound for you, if that's okay?' Paige nodded as she was speechless because she was so happy. 'So if you hop up onto this bed and pull your top up so I can see your stomach. This may be a little cold,' The doctor said as he rubbed the gel onto her stomach. He picked up the wand and started moving it around on her stomach. Eddie was sat next to Paige holding her hand, smiling proudly. 'Look there you are, here's the foetus, as it is not very developed yet you cannot see much, but you can make out where it is.' 'That's amazing Paige.' Eddie said softly. 'I know,' replied Paige. The doctor was finishing off, he wiped the gel off of her stomach and switched the machine off. 'Do you two want a copy of the sonogram?' he asked. 'Yes please,' Eddie replied. So the doctor headed off to get one printed for them and Eddie turned to Paige and kissed her passionately. 'I'm so happy darling,' Eddie said to her. 'I am as well, I am, this is the start of an amazing journey in our lives.' replied Paige. Yeah...well I hoped you liked it! Sorry for the delay! Please review, they mean a lot:)[Chapter 9] Thanks for the reviews, and over 17,000 views :') I am sorry that the medical stuff is incorrect, I am not a nurse, so I just sort of made it up, I'm sorry for any mistakes, but I am glad that you are all enjoying it! Paige got off of the bed and sorted her top out, before Eddie grabbed her hand whilst they waited for the doctor to return with a copy of their sonogram. He returned a couple of moments later with it, and handed it over to Eddie and Paige, who looked at it with delight. They thanked their doctor, before arranging Paige's next appointment, which will be in a months time, so that she can have a check up and meet her midwife. Eddie and Paige left and headed back to the palace. When they arrived, Eddie grabbed Paige's hand again: 'Come on, if we get in quickly, no one would've noticed we've been up and out without our security,' Eddie laughed. 'Yeah and I would like to go back to bed as well!' Paige replied, smiling. They walked in through the main doors and managed to get to the doors of their wing, but alas, Zoren was there! 'Ah Zoren.' Eddie stated. 'Sir! There you are.' Zoren cried. 'Yes Zoren?' Asked Eddie. 'Where have you been?' Zoren was still flustered. 'Just for an early morning walk.' Paige replied. 'Now please, I am tired, so we do need to go,' 'Yes Zoren we will see you later.' Eddie said firmly, before stepping past Zoren and into their wing so that Paige could go and rest and that Eddie could catch up with some paperwork. Paige awoke to Eddie fast asleep on her shoulder. She kissed him gently on the cheek before moving his head to the pillow and heading to get a drink of water. She sat down at hers and Eddie's desk and looked through the pile of stuff she had found on the desk. Paige came across a photo of her and Eddie in Sangu, at Princess Myra's wedding. It was one of Paige's favourite pictures of the two of them, and she sat there for a while thinking about their trip to Sangu. Without her realising, Eddie had slipped out of bed and was standing behind her, before slipping his arm around her and kissing her head. Paige relaxed into his embrace. 'I love that picture,' Eddie said softly. 'So do I, it's one of my favourite ones of the two of us.' Paige replied, smiling. 'Do you know what the time is?' 'Um...' Eddie looked at his watch. 'Yes it is 11 o'clock.' 'Do you think that we should get changed and go and find my parents?' 'Yes, but are you going to tell them about the baby?' 'No, not until I've gone past the 12 week mark, I haven't started showing yet thank goodness.' 'Okay darling, it's up to you when you want to announce it. All I care about is your's and the baby's safety.' Paige smiled. 'Thank you Eddie,' Eddie kissed the top of Paige's head before Paige stood up and Eddie wrapped his arms around her and kissed her on the lips. After they broke off, Paige said; 'We'd better get sorted or else we are going to have my parents wondering where we are, then we're going to have some explaining to do!' Half an hour later, Paige and Eddie were changed and were walking through the halls of the palace, looking for Paige's parents. They eventually found them in Eddie's parents room, drinking tea with them, and Eddie and Paige stood in the doorway, Paige in front of Eddie with his arms around her waist, resting on her stomach, and they both knew the significance of this and smiled at each other. Paige's mum looked up and saw them standing there. 'Oh there you two are, we were wondering where you had gotten to!' They all laughed. 'I was tired, so Eddie and I have watched a film in bed,' Paige explained. 'We understand it's fine.' Rosaline said. 'Come and sit down.' Paige and Eddie sat down on the sofa opposit their two sets of parents. 'What would you like to drink?' 'I'll have a coffee thank you,' Eddie said. 'I am alright thank you, I have just had a coffee.' Paige replied. 'Okay Paige that's fine, Edvard, here is your coffee.' 'Thanks Mum.' Eddie knew to put the coffee on the table away from Paige, so that it does not make her feel nauseous, and he clearly knew that she hadn't just had a coffee, it's that they make her ill now with the pregnancy that only they knew about. Paige smiled at Eddie because she understood this gesture and shuffled up next to Eddie and snuggled into him. Eddie put his arm around her shoulders and kissed the top of her head, whilst the adults were blissfully unaware what was going on and carried on catching up. 'So you two, what do you want to do today? We must do something!' Rosaline asked them. 'Well we're not in the mood to do much after yesterday's eventful day, so why don't we...'Eddie started. Paige finished: 'Chill in the pool and jacuzzi?' 'Sounds like a great idea darling,' Paige's dad said. 'We will meet you down there in about 20-30 minutes then?' Eddie said. 'Just so we can get ready and eat something as well.' 'Okay great idea, see you in a while!' With that, Paige and Eddie left their parents to go back to their room and get ready. 15 minutes later, Paige was changed into a gorgeous deep pink bikini, and was looking at herself in her full length mirror. Eddie came up behind her, looking handsome in Paige's opinion, in his board shorts and he put his arms around her waist and put them on her stomach, which felt a little swollen in his opinion. 'Paige, your stomach feels slightly swollen.' He said softly. Paige rested her hands on top of his and felt that it was, and smiled up at him. 'Thats a good sign, but is it noticable?' 'No not yet darling, don't worry.' Eddie replied and kissed the top of her head. They stood like this for a couple more minutes, enjoying each other's company with Paige still standing in Eddie's embrace. Well there you go! Hope you enjoyed it! So sorry for late update! I will try and write a couple of chapters in the Christmas holidays but I'm afraid that I've neglected my other fanfictions so I have to write for them as well! Sorry, but thank you once again, you guys are amazing! Please leave a review:') Also the person who reviewed saying that they had connections with the Prince and Me producer, could you make a fanfiction account please and private message me?:)) thank you:)[Chapter 10] Thank you all so much for the reviews, they were lovely to read :) To the guest who recently reviewed, I wish there was a film as well :) there was another guest who was saying about the characters, if this was to be a film, I would love for it to be Chris Geere and Kam Heskin who act the parts of Eddie and Paige, like they did in 3 and 4. Enjoyyyy:) 'Right, I think we should go down to the pool,' Eddie whispered in Paige's ear. 'Yeah our parents' will be wondering where we are,' Paige laughed. 'Just let me grab a robe or something and some flip flops.' Paige pulled her beach/pool robe out of her cupboard and her Jack Wills flip flops. 'Paige, what brand are they?' Eddie asked curiously. 'Jack Wills, my cousin sent them over from England, she loves that brand, and they are really comfy! I love the colours as well!' Paige replied. 'Okay, they look nice, and comfy compared to my ones that I found in my wardrobe, I think I bought them when I was in Wisconsin!' Eddie was wearing a pair of Superdry flip flops. 'Yes I remember you buying them!' Paige said. 'I think we actually should go down to the pool now, as we are late for our parents!' Eddie took Paige's hand and they left their bedroom. A few moments later, Paige and Eddie arrived down by the pool and jacuzzi to find their parents already in there, relaxing. 'Sorry we're a bit late, we had a phone call from the King of Sangu that we had to answer.' Paige told a white lie to their parents. Paige's parents looked at each other in bewilderment, they didn't really understand fully the extent of what Paige now is doing in Denmark. They still struggled to believe that their daughter was the Queen of Denmark! Rosaline smiled at her. 'What was he calling about?' 'Oh, just thanking us for attending Princess Myra's wedding.' Eddie answered his mother's question. Paige and Eddie slipped their robes and flip flops off and left them by a lounger on the side of the pool, and climbed into the jacuzzi. 'You two are quite tanned aren't you?' Paige's dad laughed. 'Yeah, we spent a lot of time outdoors in Sangu, and the sun is quite strong!' Paige replied, and giving Eddie the look that only he knew the meaning of, which was to not say all of the details about what happened in Sangu! Eddie smiled knowingly back at Paige. 'So did you enjoy your trip to Sangu?' Haraald asked the pair. 'Yes we did thank you,and we think that we have solved the Red Ming situation,' Eddie replied. 'Really?' Haraald was surprised. 'Yes. We did solve it, however it turns out that the supposed fiancé of Princess Myra was conning the king, and had rejected the aid that I had arranged for the Red Ming to have just weeks before.' Paige explained. Paige's parents looked at their daughter in awe. They could not believe that she was managing to do all of this, as well as work as a doctor. The next thing she'll be telling them is that she's expecting a baby! So she would be a Queen, a mother and a doctor! Paige's mum was wondering how she would manage all of that, when the time comes! But she managed to convince herself that Paige would manage it, so she would worry about it another time. 'Mum, are you okay? You are looking at me weirdly.' Paige was asking her. 'Yes, yes I'm fine, just thinking and daydreaming!' Paige's mum looked at her daughter and smiled proudly at the beautiful, mature woman that Paige had become. Paige was sat in Eddie's strong and comforting embrace, smiling back at her mother. 'Edvard, tomorrow we have a meeting in Parliament with all of the other members of the board, Paige if you want you can be there as well?' Haraald told Eddie and Paige. Eddie rolled his eyes as he did not enjoy these meetings very much, and Paige saw this and laughed at him. 'Actually, I did have some plans that I need to confirm. Mum do you want to come shopping with me tomorrow? I need to get some presents and I would like some retail therapy,' Paige smiled. 'Yes, of course I'd love to!' Paige's mum replied. 'Well that's that sorted then, I might pop in at the end of it, if that's okay?' Paige said. 'Yes that's fine, and Edvard can let you know about what happened in it.' Haraald answered. 'Okay good plan.' Eddie replied. Just then Zoren came running into the pool area, looking quite flustered, again. 'Zoren are you alright? That's the second time today I've seen you looking like that!' Eddie asked him. 'Well the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in England have just arrived with their son, and no one had warned me!' Zoren replied. 'Oh that was my fault, I'm ever so sorry! Kate wanted to come down to Denmark to see me, we've been talking ever since we were introduced at a ball or something, as Wes re both in the same positions with becoming royal, so she wanted to come and visit. Please excuse us. Eddie come on we've got to go and meet them.' Paige explained. 'Ever so sorry,' Paige said to her's and Eddie's parents. They quickly dried themselves off after getting out of the jacuzzi, and slipped their robes back on and followed Zoren up to the entrance hall. Arriving in the entrance hall, Paige and Eddie found William and Kate sat on the sofa and Kate was holding George who had just woken up. They stood up when they saw Paige and Eddie approaching, and were greeted by hugs and kisses. 'I'm ever so sorry that we kept you waiting, my parents are over from America so we were in the jacuzzi with both sets of our parents.' Paige explained. 'Its fine do not worry Paige, we have only just arrived, so it was nice to sit down for a while!' Kate replied. George started to fuss in her arms. 'Paige do you want to hold him?' 'Yes please!' Kate passed George over to Paige, and saw that the men were talking, so she and Paige carried on talking for a while before Paige said: 'Eddie we've left our parents in the jacuzzi, Kate, William would you like to join us? Zoren has had your bags pit in the guest room that is in the same corridor as our rooms, follow us and we'll show you.' 'Okay that sounds like a good idea, William is that okay?' Kate asked. 'Yes fine by me, we did pack our swimming stuff didn't we?' William replied. 'Well Marissa packed the bags, so I would say that she did!' 'Okay then, well yes that's fine by me, let's go.' Paige and Eddie locked hands and led the way to the rooms. They pointed out which rooms was which. 'Knock on our door when you are ready and we will take you down.' Eddie told them. 'Okay, thank you,' William replied, and they went to their room and Paige and Eddie went into theirs to sort out some paperwork that they had been given and to relax before heading back down to their parents. I'm really sorry for a late update, things have been crazy! So to make up for it, I wrote a longer chapter, I hope it's okay, but if you don't like it, please let me know so that I can make some changes! Please leave a review and you are welcome to pm me as well :))[Chapter 11] Thanks for the reviews guysss:)) The reviewer Alexandra, I have only written 9 chapters, well this is my 10th, but one of them was responses to the reviews that I had :) also thanks to mjsmart2001, you have understood my situation and gotten me to hurry up ;) but yes thank you :) I am really sorry for not updating, my life, well I've got exams coming up, and a massive French controlled assessment to learn, along side my crazy home life and swim training, updates are going to be limited, I don't know how often I will have time to write new chapters, so if you guys have any ideas for chapters that follow on from the last, please please pm me and I will write one around that idea, and credit you, it would help me so much :) A month had passed, and Paige was settled into her pregnancy, thankfully she only has a small bump, which is easily covered, and currently only herself and Eddie knew about it. They had not yet told their parents. William and Kate stayed for a couple of days, in which the girls caught up and the men, well did whatever men do! Paige's parents left after two weeks, in which Paige and her mum spent a lot of time together, and both of her parents got to know Haraald and Rosaline better. Currently, Paige and Eddie were in a Parliament meeting, which was coming to a close. Eddie spent the whole time trying to pay attention, but getting distracted easily, and Paige was paying attention but was also trying to not laugh at Eddie's attempts to concentrate. It was a sunny winter's day, and Eddie had planned for himself and Paige to go for a picnic on the beach in the afternoon, just so they can get out and be together. The meeting ended, and Eddie took Paige's hand and they left Parliament together. 'I spent that whole meeting trying to not laugh at you Eddie.' Paige laughed. 'Why?' Eddie replied. 'Because your attempts of concentrating were hilarious!' 'Yeah, well I would've rather not been there. And, my thoughts were somewhere else.' 'Where were they then? Because they definitely weren't at the meeting.' 'I was thinking about you, and the baby,' Paige blushed. 'Nearly 3 months along we are,' 'Yes, another 6 to go, when are we announcing it?' 'I don't know, we need to go for another scan at somepoint. Didn't we book it last time?' 'Yes, it is next Thursday I think.' By this time they had arrived back at the palace. 'Right, go and get some warm clothes on, we're going out.' Eddie told Paige. 'And no, I'm not telling you where either!' He said after seeing Paige's look. Half an hour later, they had left the palace again, and Eddie and Paige had intertwined their hands. Eddie led Paige to a secluded beach, where there was a picnic set out on a blanket on the sand for the two of them. Paige gasped. 'Eddie did you do this all for me?' 'Yes. I did. We haven't spent much time together the two of us lately, and here we can be private, but we just need to consider what we talk about, as I'm not sure about any cameras turning up, but I haven't told anybody-' Eddie was cut off, Paige placed her finger to his lips. 'Eddie, be quiet. This is perfect.' She kissed him gently on the lips. 'So why don't we sit down?' They both sat down on the rug, and started to go through the basket of food, to see what delights the cooks had prepared for them. Two hours later, the basket had been closed again and all rubbish had been out inside of it. Paige was sat in Eddie's embrace and the two of them were facing the sea, watching the sun start to go down, as the days were still quite short compared to their normal ones. 'Darling, I think we should head back to the palace now,' Eddie said. 'Before it gets too dark.' 'Okay.' Paige replied sleepily. Eddie stood up and helped Paige get up herself, before picking up the rug, shaking it off and placing it inside of the basket. Eddie put his arm around Paige's shoulders and she snuggled into his shoulder. 'Eddie, this has been amazing, thank you so much.' Paige smiled. 'I'm glad you liked it,' Eddie replied. 'I love you so much and I can't wait for our baby to arrive.' 'I love you too, and neither can I.' They both smiled and the conversation fell into a comfortable silence. When they arrived back at the palace, Eddie gave the basket to one of the maids, and Paige and Eddie headed to their room. They both got changed into their pyjamas, for if had been a long day and got underneath the covers. Paige lay with her head on Eddie's shoulder, and he put his arm protectively around her. Their other hands lay intertwined on Paige's stomach, and they both fell asleep quickly in this position. The week passed quickly, and soon it was Thursday, the day of Paige's 3 month scan. It was another early start, to avoid the paparazzi, so Eddie woke Paige up with breakfast in bed, and they arrived at the hospital at exactly 9am, and were immediately seen. 'How have you been coping, your royal highness?' The doctor asked Paige. 'Good thank you, the sickness has died down which is good.' 'I am glad to hear that, as you are now in your second trimester. This may be cold.' The doctor said, as he rubbed the clear gel on to Paige's slightly rounded stomach. 'The baby is looking great, very healthy and is growing properly.' 'That's brilliant news!' Eddie said. 'Yes, I am glad about that as well!' Paige also replied. 'When are you two going to announce it? Because it will most likely add stress to Paige and the baby, so please do not overdo it, and just watch out for the cameras, and please never go out without security.' Their doctor told them. 'We do not yet know when we will announce it, however we will follow what you said.' Paige replied. 'I will do everything in my power to protect Paige and the baby.' Eddie said gravely. 'Thank you, I am only saying it because I am concerned about Paige being stressed and putting the baby under stress as well.' The doctor replied. 'You are 3 months along Paige, so you should not experience morning sickness again, until maybe the third trimester but it varies between different women, as you are all different people. Here is a copy of the sonogram, we shall book your next appointment for a month's time.' 'Thank you Doctor.' Paige said. She readjusted her top, and got off of the bed. They headed into the reception and booked Paige's next appointment. After thanking the doctor once more, the pair left hand in hand, with their sunglasses on their faces to try and not be recognised. Thankfully, they arrived back at the palace safely, but were greeted by Eddie's mother and father. 'Where have you two been?' Rosaline asked. 'Yes, you do not seem to have security with you either.' Haraald said sternly. 'You know that you should not go out without your security.' Paige and Eddie exchanged glances, but they knew that they were going to have to explain where they had been, and why they were without security, because Rosaline and Haraald don't give up that easily. 'Well?' Rosaline said, with her arms crossed. 'I would really like to know why you thought you could leave the palace without your security and not letting anyone know..we were worried about you two, because you have seemed different lately.' 'Edvard.' Haraald said. 'Mother, Father, Please let us go sit down.' Eddie said, gesturing to the drawing room. They all headed into the drawing room and got settled on the sofas, with Paige and Eddie on one, and Rosaline and Haraald on the other. Eddie clasped Paige's hand in his, and Paige was rubbing small circles on Eddie's wrist to calm him down. 'So?' Rosaline was still curious. 'Mother, Father, we have something that we need to tell you.' Eddie said. Oooo sorry leaving it on a cliffie there! I hope you all understand why I have taken forever to update, please don't hate me! However, on a lighter note, please leave a review, and any ideas, please pm me with them, or leave them on the review, I will happily take them into consideration! A few questions from me to you guys: Would you like the baby to be a boy or a girl? Which month would you like Paige's due date to be in? What names do you prefer for their baby? Thank you ever so much you guys! Please answer the questions in a review, or pm me the answers. You guys are amazing! Love, waterlooroadlover2012 xo[Chapter 12] Thank you guys for the reviews :) I've just looked at my fanfiction stats for this month, and I have readers in over 80 different countries! Wow! Thank you so much! Here you guys go! 'Go on.' Haraald said. Eddie took a deep breath, Paige smiled reassuringly at him; 'Paige is...Paige is 3 months pregnant.' Eddie reopened his eyes, not even realising that he had shut them in the first place, to see his parents' reaction. 'Oh my,' Rosaline smiled. 'Congratulations!' 'Yes, many congratulations from us!' Haraald said. Both Paige and Eddie heaved sighs of relief. 'How long have you known for?' Rosaline asked. 'For about a month.' Paige replied. 'And we only now know?' Rosaline said. 'Yes. We wanted to wait until the 3 month mark, just to be sure.' Eddie said. Suddenly Zoren burst into the room, looking flustered, as usual. 'Zoren, whatever is the matter?' Paige asked. 'The Prime Minister, is in the main reception area, demanding to speak to someone.' 5 minutes later, the group had arrived in the main reception area to see an angry looking Prime Minister. 'You!' He said, pointing at Paige. 'Me?' She questioned. 'You have had me dropped from Government and Parliament.' He came right up to Paige's face, and Eddie's face turned angry. 'Your actions were inappropriate, and disrespectful to the Crown. The case has now been closed. You are not Prime Minister anymore.' Paige replied. The 'Prime Minister' pushed Paige in her stomach area, and she crippled over in pain. Eddie threw a punch at the 'Prime Minister' and then rushed to Paige's side, where she was sitting with her hands on her stomach, and Rosaline by her side. Haraald had the 'Prime Minister' escorted off of the palace grounds, and had someone call a car, which quickly drove them all to the maternity wing at the hospital. An hour later, Paige was lying in a private room, asleep, wearing a hospital gown, and hooked up to a IV to help pump fluids into her body. Eddie was sat beside her, holding her hand, and Rosaline and Haraald were sat the other side. The three of them looked up when the doctor entered the room. 'Your highnesses.' He said, and when he had all of their attentions he carried on. 'The baby is fine, and is perfectly healthy...' Eddie felt like part of a weight was lifted off of his shoulders. He heaved a sigh of relief. '...but Her Royal Highness was slightly dehydrated, so it caused the impact of the push to affect her more than it should have. We have an IV pumping fluids into her. We shall keep her in for a few days. You may stay if you wish,' The doctor said, gesturing to Eddie. 'I would like to.' Eddie said, and the doctor left the room. None of them noticed that Paige had woken up. 'Where am I?' She asked. 'Paige! You're awake!' Eddie said happily. 'Yes, but where am I?' She replied. 'You're in hospital darling,' He said. 'Oh I remember now, the Prime Minister pushed me.' 'Yes he did.' Rosaline said. 'But you were also slightly dehydrated, so it affected you more than it should have.' 'That's why you're still here. You fainted when you arrived, so they need you to stay in for a few days.' 'Oh.' Was all Paige said. 'We are going to head back to the palace.' Haraald said. 'We will let you know when we get back.' 'Okay, see you later.' Eddie said. The next day, Paige was released from the hospital, and unfortunately for them, the paparazzi found out that Paige was in the hospital, so as she emerged from the hospital, holding a bouquet of flowers, and she was wrapped up in a navy trench coat, over the top of her dress, tights and boots. Eddie wrapped his arm securely around her as she waved to the well wishers, and escorted her into the awaiting car, which drove off quickly, and ensured that they got back to the palace safely.

See you at the end of June! -waterlooroadloverxo ","Summary":" Well, there wasn't any of these sort of fanfictions when I looked, so I decided to write me own Pri"},{"Movie":"Prince & Me","Title":"The Prince and Me The not-so Happily Ever After part 1","Author":"Mckennagrace","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12068407","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"Paige? Paige darling, are you awake?\" Edvard quietly whispered to a sleeping Paige. \"I am now…,\" she replied sleepily. \"We need to talk about something, something that I have wanted to talk to you about for a long while now.\" \"Eddie? Is everything ok?\" \"no, no its nothing bad. I just-\" Paige cut him off, \"then what is it?\" \"we have been married for a little over a year now and I was just… I don't know… wondering if you wanted to start a family of our own?\" Paige fell silent. At this moment Paige was thinking of Eddie with the kids back in Sangu and how happy he looked. Meanwhile Edvard was afraid she was not ready to start a family, and that maybe he should've waited a bit longer. Eddie knew that starting a family, would make it nearly impossible for Paige to keep her job as a doctor in Copenhagen, and they would no longer be able to travel and see the world as they have been doing for the past year. But he had a certain love for children and felt as though it could only bring him and Paige closer. Paige wanted to tell Edward that she was ready to have children and start a family, but she couldn't. She did not know if she was ready, so she simply replied, \"Can we talk about this later, I am awfully tired.\" \"yes of course my love.\" He then kissed her softly on the forehead and went back to sleep. All throughout the night they both thought about what their lives would be like after children. They both had the same idea of a happy royal family, but the consequences of the children were different in each of their heads. Eddie thought about how tired they would be staying up all night for two years and running a country on no sleep. Paige was just bewildered with everything that could go wrong with the pregnancies,and the possibility of having to practically raise them on her own because Eddie would be away for long periods of time. The next morning they awoke to a soft knock on the door. It was Arabella. \"Come in sweetheart,\" replied Eddie smoothly, motioning for her to come in. The look on Arabella's face worried the couple, as it was sad and it looked like she had been crying for a while. \"What's wrong Arie?\" worriedly asked Paige. \"Daddy is ill again this morning. Mom told me to come and wait in here with you until she sorts him out.\" Paige and Eddie looked at each other as though they could read each others mind. I will stay with Arabella and you will go and help your mother and father. Edvard rose from the bed and kissed Arabella on the head as he headed out the door. Paige motioned for her to get on the bed. Arabella explained to Paige that Harold's illness has returned and it is much worse than before. She sobbed on Paige's shoulder, and Paige comforted her by stroking the top of her head. It seemed to be working, the crying stopped, just the sniffles now. \"Paige?\" quietly asked Arie. \"yes?\" replied paige. \"Are you and Edvard ever going to have children, because I think you would make a great mom.\" Paige waited a moment before she replied. She had children on her mind ever since her talk with Eddie last night, and what Arie had just said, went to the heart. \"Probably, we are thinking about it… and you really think I would be a good mom?\" Arie looked at Paige with the most reassuring look and said, \"of course you would.\" What they didn't know was that Edward had returned minutes before and heard their conversation. He thought yet again about children. Once he had snapped back to reality he slowly walked into the room and sat next to Paige. \"Arie you can go and visit father now, he is doing much better.\" Before Arie left she looked at Paige again, but this time with a tell him how you really feel kind of look. But Paige became very nervous and as soon as Arie left the room, she began a conversation about her father in law. Until Eddie cut her off. \"Paige. Do you wanna talk about last night?\" she quickly rose from the bed shut the door to their bedroom then went into the bathroom and locked the door behind her. But she wasn't fast enough, Eddie was hot on her heels caught the door before she had the chance to close it. She started to undress as if she was going to take a shower, ignoring the fact that Edvard was still standing in the doorway. Eddie sighed. \"Paige can we please just talk about this? If you really don't want to talk about thi-\" before he had the chance to finish, she leaned over the sink and began to cry. \"oh paige, why are you crying?\" he said in a comforting yet concerned tone. \"what if something goes wrong with the pregnancy? What if we have to leave the state to some dangerous faraway land, that I refuse to bring them to. Do we just leave them behind with some nanny, or worse your mother? Eddie I'm just not sure how this is going to work. Not to mention I would have to quit my job being a doctor, and become a mommy nurse. Im not sure I'm ready to be a mommy nurse. \"There are solutions to almost all of those problems. Yes we would leave the children behind, but with a trustworthy nanny. If something does go wrong with the pregnancy I will be by your side the entire time.\" \"What about the days you spend in parliament and in meetings with the prime minister. Am I supposed to drop my duties as queen and raise OUR children by myself.\" Eddie walked up behind her and wrapped his arms around her and said, \"You will never be alone. I will always be there even when I'm not. If you were to ever need anything I could be there in the blink of an eye.\" \"Eddie, are you sure you want to do this? Not wait just a little bit longer?\" \"paige, if youre not ready its ok, but just for future knowledge, I am ready to start a family with my beautiful, intelligent amazing wife.\" He turned her around, and their foreheads touched. He then softly kissed her on the lips. They kissed for a while, until there was yet another knock on the door. It was seron. \"You r majesties your breakfast with the prime minister begins in 20 minutes.\" \"thank you Seron\" replied Edvard. He turned back to Paige, \"so is that a yes?\" \"I guess it is.\" Answered Paige with a huge grin. Eddie picked her up and spun her around until he threw her on the bed, and kissed vigorously. \"we better get ready\" laughed Eddie. \"I guess so.\" Happily replied Paige. From that day on Edvard and Paige began the road of trying to get pregnant. They tried and tried for months but nothing seemed to catch. They became frustrated and decided to take a break for a while. One morning, Paige awoke to a startle, she was going to be sick. The scented candle in the bathroom disgusted her thoroughly. She ran to the bathroom and was throwing up non-stop because she couldn't not reach the candle. She became very light headed and dizzy, she could not longer keep her balance. But as she fell her right wrist slit open on the toilet paper holder. She began to lose blood very quickly. Eddie had left for the morning but would be back at around 10:30. He entered the room to see paige on the floor unconscious and covered in blood. \"PAIGE! PAIGE! Oh god. Oh god.\" Yelled Eddie worriedly. He picked up and laid her on the bed. Then he ran to get his mother and the ladies maids. They wrapped her wrist in wash cloths. \"Eddie, did she…?\"asked Rosalind. \"Mother, I don't think she would try to, why would she…?\" Eddie began to cry. \"why would she do this?\" \"Well we don't know what happened Edvard. It could just be an awful coincidence.\" Replied Rosalind. Eddie was worried. He kept thinking about how they were trying to get pregnant. What if she is pregnant and could be losing the baby because of Paige's bloodloss? Eddie picked her up once more and took her downstairs to the ambulance. Before they closed the doors to the ambulance, Eddie took a good look at the palace and thought about all of the reasons she would've tried to commit suicide. Maybe being a queen, and a doctor, and not being able to get pregnant was really getting to her. But why didn't she just talk to him, let him know what's going on. Maybe Eddie was just away to often for her to talk to him. He kept thinking about whether or not it was his fault his wife tried to commit suicide out of the blue. They had arrived at the hospital, as soon as they opened the doors to the ambulance the paparazzi swarmed. The doctors were sprinting to save the queen, with no hesitation. Eddie followed behind until they said he could go no further. Eddie stood there for a moment not even noticing the paparazzi surrounding him. The royal guards quickly de-surrounded the King. They then escorted him to a private waiting room. Eddie was restless just thinking about not living the rest of his life with Paige. She was his saving grace two years ago. She is the love of his life now and forever.[Chapter 2] A few hours after they arrived at the hospital, Edvard was finally allowed to see Paige, as she was much better now. Edvard stood before the door, and thought for a moment, for the last moments before he had to confront his wife on what actually happened. He kept telling himself that it was just an accident, that she would never, but he felt in his gut that maybe being a queen and trying to become a mom was too much pressure for her. He took a deep breath, reached for the knob, and turned it. He walked in slowly to see his wife curled up in a ball sobbing. He began to walk faster, until she spun around quickly in her bed, startled. \"Eddie! What happened to me? Why am I here? Am I ok? Was I in an accident? Are you ok?\" Paige then saw the look on Eddie's face and became very upset and scared. \"My darling, do you remember anything?\" he replied. \"no. not a thing. I am going to ask you one more time, what happened to me?\" she said trying not to cry. \"I found you on the floor of our bathroom, unconscious, in a pool of blood. You slit your wrist.\" Paige stopped, she looked as though she was going to say something but then held her tongue with a very stern and confused face. \"you mean I? But why would I? No this cant be true Eddie I would never.\" \"Paige its ok, just relax, I know being a queen can be very stressful. I also don't blame you for us not being able to have a baby yet. Its no one's fault. I just… Why didn't you talk to me?\" \"Get out.\" Paige said with a very displeased face. \"I said, GET OUT!\" Eddie left the room, with a confused mind. He gently closed the door behind him. He heard her sobbing in the room. Eddie turned back around and went in the room, laid down next to Paige and held her in his arms. \"Eddie I didn't try to kill myself. I would never do that, not even on my worst days because I have you. I know you're by my side in the good, and in the bad. If I didn't commit suicide, then what really happened to me?\" \"I'm afraid that you're the only one who can answer that right now my love.\" He then kissed her softly and wiped away her tears. \"How bout we get some sleep ok?\" he said softly. \"I love you so much Eddie I hope you know that I would never leave you in such a way.\" \"I know. I know.\" They laid down together and slept on the hospital bed until they were awoken by a nurse. \"Excuse me your majesties but I am here to check on the queen\" she said softly. \"that's fine, I'll give you two some privacy\" Eddie said as he kissed Paige softly on the head. He left the room and closed the door behind him. \"So how did he take the news, is he excited?\" \"I actually I haven't told anyone just yet I needed just a few minutes to clear the air about the whole 'attempted suicide' thing.\" They both laughed as the nurse took her vitals. \"actually I was thinking maybe I should wait to tell him, and surprise him at the palace, with a pregnancy test and everything.\" Paige said asking advice from the nurse. \"With all do respect your majesty I think you should tell him here. I'm sure he will ask if the baby is ok from lack of blood in your body. You, knowing that the baby is fine for now, have reassurances he doesn't. Surely he will ask for tests to be done and so forth. But what I can do is get a pregnancy test and a few cute baby things so you can surprise him here.\" The nurse seemed to have a very honored tone. \"You would do that for me?\" \"of course! You are my queen and a fellow woman. I would be honored to help tell the King about his first heir.\" \"very well then, lets do this thing.\" A few hours later the nurse returned with the test and baby clothes in a gift wrapped box. \"I went ahead and put took the test in the urine sample you gave this morning , and it was positive, surprise, surprise.\" \"Great. He just left to go get some dinner and he should be back any minute. God, I'm so nervous or anxious rather. How should I give it to him?\" Before Paige had the chance to think about it, Eddie had begun to enter the room. His hands were full so he had to open the door with his back towards them. Paige and the nurse began to play \"hot potato\" with the gift until the nurse laid it on the floor. \"Hi dear!\" she said anxiously. \"im sorry was I interrupting something?\" \"no, no, the queen and I were just chit chatting about when she could share the news… about when she could go back to the palace.\"she said with emphasis on the share the news part as in to tell the king about the baby. \"Right. Well when can she go home?\" \"Anytime tonight or tomorrow morning. Well I will give you two some privacy.\" She said with a wink as she walked out the door. \"What was that all about?\" Eddie said jokingly. \"Oh nothing. Can you do me a favor?\" Paige said nervously. \"Anything.\" Paige then pointed towards the side of the bed. \"Can you grab the box right there?\" \"what's this? A gift?\" \"In its own crazy way yes, a gift.\" He slowly pulled the bow off the gift and smiled with great joy. \"Are you serious? Are we pregnant?\" Eddie began to cry, and laugh, then cry again. Then attacked Paige with hugs and kisses. \"Is the baby ok from the accident? No problems?\" \"not so far but the doctors believed that's why I passed out. The baby was in EDD (early development distress).\" \"Maybe we should get some tests done, check on everything.\" \"Eddie the doctors have done all of the tests that put the baby in no harm. Some tests are better done later on in the pregnancy.\" \"if you're sure… god I'm so happy!\"[Chapter 3] Once the queen and King were finally allowed to leave for the palace the paparazzi began to swarm. They seemed to be making up every bit of information they could think of. \"Is it true you had an overdose?\" \"My Queen is the king abusing you?\" \"did you really try to kill yourself?\" \"Your majesties! Why are you making no comments?\" \"NO COMMENTS ON ANY OF THIS!\" Eddie yelled with a very annoyed tone. Once they were in the car Paige began to cry again. \"This is all my fault. I am SO sorry about all of this.\" \"Paige this is no one's fault. What happened to you was a tragic accident. With a happy ending of course, but the only thing these vultures want is a good story for tomorrow's tabloids. I promise you, I will let no one hurt our family.\" After a moment Paige began to giggle. \"what are you laughing at?\" Eddie said jokingly. \"we have a family.\" \"Indeed we do, and I know that this isn't an issue but lets make sure we are talking to each other. \" \"Eddie. Its not like I was feeling really insecure and wasn't telling you about any of it. I promise you know all of my insecurities. Even though I would like to leave a few out of discussion.\" \"I know and I trust you and you should trust me and tell me everything.\" \"I DID! Wait. Are you still thinking about me committing suicide. I thought we were past that?\" \"Paige finding you on that floor and carrying you downstairs to the ambulance was the hardest thing I have ever done. I thought you were dead already. I will NEVER get past that.\" \"Why cant you just…\" as the limo hit a speed bump, Paige all the sudden felt very sick. \"Eddie hand me the trash can.\" \"sorry?\" he asked nervously. \"oh dear. DRIVER PULL OVER!\" Eddie handed her the trashcan very quickly, and she was sick. For a while. A LONG while. \"Darling have you even eaten this much in the past week?\" he asked jokingly. \"no I don't think I have really.\" Paige laughed and told the driver to drive quickly to the palace. \"how bout we go for a swim tomorrow? To just relax for little while.\" Suggested Eddie. \"I think you know what I have to do tomorrow.\" \"I hope it's not what I think, you think, you are doing tomorrow.\" \"Eddie I have waited for this surgery for months.\" \"Paige… you were in the hospital for two days and had your head stuck in a trashcan for the last 20 minutes. Now you wanna go stand on your feet for 12 hours straight just to watch somebody's heart being removed from their now dead body and into a LIVING body. That's not too utterly disgusting for your weak stomach? Or is a speed bump way more intense?\" \"Fine, I am at least going to sit in the gallery. I am not missing this surgery for the world.\" \"And you my love have a press conference about what happened in two days ago and why you ere in the hospital. But alas we still really don't know what happened.\" Oh god. I forgot about that for a minute there. But look we're here, looks like we are going to have to talk about this later. She said with a wink.[Chapter 4] Hello my beautiful people… I am in need of reviews to help me along. The sex of the baby, names maybe? How should Edvard and Paige make up… or NOT makeup. PLEASE LEAVE REVIEWS ON ANY SCREW UPS I HAVE MADE OR WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE. Don't be afraid, I can't bite from my side of the screen. \"Eddie you should go make arrangements for the press conference.\" \"I don't know love maybe I should help you inside.\" \"Eddie I am fine walking up a flight of stairs.\" \"only if you're sure.\" \"I am fine. Promise.\" Eddie then kissed her softly on the head and walked towards his office. As she entered the house, Paige looked at the staircase she had to climb to reach her room. Her first thought was that she would pass out halfway up, but then she thought of how Eddie would pity her. Paige wanted no attention and desperation pity from, \"the incident.\" \"Your majesty would you like a hand up the stairs?\" Seron asked worriedly. \"no Seron. Thank you.\" Paige replied Seron walked away knowing in his mind she would not be able to get up the stairs by herself. So he whispered to a door guard to watch her and make sure if she fell he would be there. \"Should I alert the King of this situation?\" obediently asked the guard. \"no you are to speak to no one about this.\" He replied Paige took a deep breath, began to take a step, then was winded immediately. The guard rushed over and helped her up the stairs. \"don't worry your majesty. I will tell no one. You please, go rest.\" Respectfully he bowed. \"I will thank you.\" She replied gratefully. Paige walked to her room and laid down immediately. She was out for thee count. Later that night Eddie walked in to find her in a ball in their bed. He undressed and crawled into bed, trying not to wake her. She then rolled over and wrapped her am around him unconsciously. This moment was something that he wanted to last forever. Paige slept and slept until the next night when it was time for the press conference. \"paige. Paige\" Eddie said attempting to wake her up. \"It's time for the press conference.\" Her eyes shot open. \"WHAT!? You let me sleep all day? What about my surgery? Ugh!\" \"About that, I called the doctors this morning and they said you weren't allowed to be anywhere near the surgical floor in your condition.\" \"What condition am I in Eddie?\" She replied angrily. \"you are at the beginning of your pregnancy with our baby already at risk. Your immune system is still weak in your blood. If you were to catch a surgical something, you may never get over it, and neither would our unborn child.\" Paige was silent. \"you're right.\" \"Paige? No. Don't go there.\" Eddie kneeled down beside the bed and as a tear fell down her cheeks he gently wiped it away. \"You did nothing wrong. Our baby couldn't be safer with any other person. And Paige you know I saw you attempt to go up the stairs right? Paige you took one step and nearly passed out. Why in the world would you not tell me? Your husband, father of your child?\" \"Eddie its nothing to worry about. The nurse said it was normal to have pain and fatigue at the beginning and end of the pregnancy.\" \"Pain? What do you mean? Is it the baby?\" \"The baby is fine.\" Paige was now beginning to get a little worried herself about the baby but again didn't want to tell Eddie. \"lets just get dressed and go to the press conference.\" \"NO paige. We have to talk about this, whether you want to or not. I can't help but think that you are not telling me something that's going on.\" \"What do you think is going on? That im having an affair with Seron? Or did I get an abortion behind your back? Take your pick. Im sure everyone at this press conference would love to know more lies and put us on more tabloids.\" \"Is that what this is all about? Are you worried about the tabloids and what people are saying? What I think? The only things I believe are the things youre telling me. Which is not very much at this moment. So ya. I'm not sure that you didn't commit suicide, or maybe you have been sipping on the whiskey that's in my underwear drawer to calm your nerves. Maybe you were just so tipsy that you couldn't get up the damn stairs!\" At this point in time Paige was beyond the crying. She was in a state of shock. Then she felt a sharp pain in her abdomen. She rubbed it for a moment until Eddie noticed and quickly pulled away. \"Paige…\" he said with a deep breath, \"Are you ok?\" \"You know what I am fine, and you know what else… don't worry about it. For all you know it could be Scott's baby.\" She stormed off in a pit of absolute rage. Leaving a heart broken King behind her.[Chapter 5] SOOOOO sorry for the extremely late update however i will be publishing three chapters tonight to make up for the lost time... Again i am going to exaggerate the need for reviews because I am slowly but surely running out of ideas for this wonderful family that I have created. As always creds to the creator of The Prince and Me but I have created this Fanfiction and copying it and taking it as your own is immoral and against the law in some states. \"Alright alright, now lets just calm down for a moment.\" Eddie said trying to calm down the reporters to even understand a single question. \"You in the front.\" \"Your majesty, did the queen try to commit suicide?\" the reporter asked with great relief. Eddie waited for a moment, \"no. she lost consciousness and her hand slid down a sharp metal surface. Causing her to lose 20% of her blood capacity. Anyone else?\" The reporters still had many questions for the couple. \"You miss in the back.\" Eddie said through the many microphones in front of him. \"What caused the queen to lose consciousness?\" She asked in a sort of yell. Eddie looked at Paige with a look of reassurance. As if he was asking her if she could tell them about the baby. She nodded slowly, beginning to get nervous. \"We are expecting a child-\" Before she even had the chance to finish the sentence the reporters cheered and begged for more questions. \"QUIET!\" Seron yelled. \"sorry your majesties, continue.\" \"As I was saying we are expecting, and the morning sickness took me by surprise on an empty stomach so I fainted. But my hand slipped on the bath tissue holder. We are not sure how the loss of blood has effected the baby until later in the pregnancy. Now please no more questions.\" As she exited with the King by her side, the cameras flashing, and the reporters yelling she turned into a run once out of the door. Eddie hot on her heels. \"Paige. PAIGE! Please be careful…\" He said now out of breath. She looked at him with teary eyes. \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt the baby and I know that it was hard for you to see me like that. But those reporters are vultures. They show no compassion for the accident. Or that the baby is in danger. They care for what juice they can get out of us, and trying to figure out whether or not we are hiding something from them. Its sick!\" Eddie smiled softly. \"there's that fire in your eyes that I miss.\" \"Eddie I'm serious.\" \"I know, its cute. And you know that they are like that. Better than anyone, because you are the amazing woman who married a King, and is now having a having a child with him. And he is so beyond elated for this baby to come into their lives. So the queen needs to calm down and take a deep breath.\" \"Will you please stop talking in third person please, you dork.\" She said laughing. \"Hey you married this dork.\" He said pulling her into his embrace kissing her softly. \"Let's go put you two to bed huh?\" He picked her up, carried her up the stairs, then threw her on the bed. They began to make love but Paige stopped him right in his tracks. \"Im sorry. Not tonight.\" \"Its fine.\" He kissed her once more and went to go take a shower. By the time he returned, Paige was no longer in the bed. He put on some clothes and went to her favorite place, where he originally asked her to marry him. As he walked up she was rubbing her small baby bump, smiling her most beautiful smile. He walked up behind her and wrapped his arms around her, resting his hands on her stomach. \"Paige, I know this baby has been a bit of trouble so far but, I promise you I will always be here whenever you need me. And on the occasion I'm not you have my parents and your parents. You're not doing this alone.\" \"I know, and I have to tell you something. I thought it was nothing but it wasn't nothing.\" \"Paige what are you talking about?\" \"I wasn't asleep all day, I went to the hospital.\" \"To do what? What's going on? Did you… (he swallowed hard) miscarry?\" \"I don't know their was a lot of pain all of the sudden and some bleeding-\" \"That's not nothing paige!\" \"Well, I just. I caused enough commotion the first time I went to the hospital so I thought I would just go real quick and check things out. The nurse checked me out, she said it was normal for post traumatic stress to,\"worry\" the baby. She or he was sending me a sign to slow down.\" \"So our baby is ok?\" \"yes, we're both ok. And she said bed rest was probably the best option.\" \"Then what in the world are you doing standing up? Bed rest means you have to stay in the bed. And for right now I am relieving you of your duties as queen. No exceptions. In other words you're grounded.\" They both laughed and then Eddie yelled for Seron. \"Your majesties…\" \"Can you bring a wheel chair?\" \"uhm. Yes. I'll just be a moment.\" \"Eddie…\" \"No you're supposed to be on bed rest the last thing I need is to carry you up the stairs again.\" They continued to laugh as Seron returned with the wheel chair. Paige timidly sat down and Eddie rolled her up the back way to their bedroom.[Chapter 6] One week. 7 days. 168 hours. 60,789 minutes. 1,360,000 seconds. Enough time to be taken to the ER. Find out that you're pregnant with your first born. To remember why you married your wonderful husband. All together with nothing to do but sit in your bed, being watched over by a guard because your overprotective husband won't let you get out of that bed. All Paige wanted to do was get out of bed and stretch her legs for a little while. See if her baby bump was showing yet. Even if it was however, you couldn't pick out how much weight you've gained from doing nothing, and how much of it is ACTUALLY from your baby. You may think well, \"just get out of the bed you are the QUEEN.\" Well the guard was ordered by the king, (emphasis on the KING part), to keep her in the bed no matter what she says. Therefore causing Paige to take matters into her own hands. Her plan was very strategic, for a two year old. She told the guard to leave her, he did nothing. \"I order you as Queen of Denmark to leave me or I will charge you with treason.\" This got his attention. He looked around and very hesitantly exited the room. Paige then heard him run toward Eddie's study. Freedom at last. She threw the covers over her legs and her feet touched the floor. This was a feeling of great power, until she heard more than the guard's footsteps coming towards the door. She quickly placed all of her weight on her feet, she was fine until she couldn't feel her feet. They were numb. She began to fall, reached for the bedside table, missed. Eddie had already thrown open the door and sprinted around the bed, to catch her right before the floor did. \"Paige! What in the world are you doing? If you wanted to get out of the bed THAT bad I would've helped you stand up for a little while.\" \"I can't feel my feet. I can't stand up on my own. I am useless. All I do is sign paperwork.\" \"You are not useless Paige, but if you are going to pull crap like this, I don't know what I'm going to do with you!\" He said laughing. \"I am useless, I am the queen of Denmark who can't get out of bed to help her country.\" \"Paige what's this all about? Do you want to come to the press conference with me today? Keep in mind however there will be lots of questions for you and the Sangu situation.\" \"THAT'S IT! I need to go to Sangu!\" \"I don't think so Mrs. I-can't-get-out-of-bed.\" She shot him a glare and he backed off. \"Why do you have to go to Sangu? There's nothing there but fighting and disease, and hatred for our country even though we are helping them. They just don't understand our situation with them.\" At this moment Eddie was still allowing Paige to stand up and now that her feet had blood in them she wanted to walk. She began to take a step with Eddie still talking in the background. \"Paige. Where are you going?\" \"out.\" \"Out of where?\" \"The country. Just for the weekend ill be fine. SERON!\" Eddie heard Seron run up the stairs as Paige grabbed her suitcase and started putting shirts and things in it. As Seron entered the room Eddie gave a silent wave of the hand and he backed out shutting the door behind him. \"What'd you do that for?\" Paige asked him with a bit of frustration. \"You're not going to Sangu.\" \"And why not? Why can I not feel useful?\" Eddie was now starting to feel bad for Paige. He realized that he had been not allowing her to leave her room like a damsel in a tower. All she wanted to do was help but she couldn't, so everyone was telling her. On the inside all Eddie wanted to do was keep her in his sights just in case something happens. He was just trying to be there for her just in case something goes wrong. \"fine. I won't go to Sangu.\" She continued to pack, now wobbling off to the bathroom to grab her toothbrush and to change into clothes. \"Then where in the world are you going?\" Asked Eddie quizzically. \"Why should I tell you? You are just going to follow me.\" \"Well yes, that would be the point of me asking. You're not going anywhere without me by your side.\" \"Eddie I need to get away. I need to get away from our problems, it's bad for the baby to sit here and be stressed out that you're mad at me\" \"Paige…\" \"Eddie please don't make this a big deal. I won't be gone for long. Hey, you leave all of the time and I'm always here waiting. It's my turn.\" She called Seron and a guard in, and the guard quietly grabbed her bags. \"Do I need to book a flight for you your majesties?\" Seron asked professionally. \"Just 1 ticket to america.\" Answered Paige. \"You can just take the jet.\" Eddie said as he walked out of the room. Seron was thoroughly confused, But asked, \"Would you like me to alert the pilot?\" \"No book coach, for the most available flight.\" Paige said as a warm tear fell down her cheek. She grabbed a piece of paper and a pen and wrote Eddie a note. She grabbed her purse and headed for the airport. In the car she sat with her hand on her stomach feeling her newly acquired baby bump that she never got to show Eddie.[Chapter 7] Eddie couldn't stop thinking about Paige and his unborn baby. As he sat in his study, he wondered if Paige would ever come back. He knew that she would but, in the back of his mind he had fears that she would see a more fulfilling life then her own and run off. Its not like she hasn't done that before when they were engaged the first time around. Meanwhile in America with her parents, she was comforted by her mother and the fact that she was about to be a mother. She took Paige by surprise as she turned the table and started talking about Eddie. \"So why isn't Eddie here? I am surprised he let that baby out of his sight.\" She said lightheartedly. \"Well, he doesn't exactly know.\" \"Know about the baby or that you're here with me? Or both?\" \"He knows about the baby, it's a long story for a later time. What he doesn't know is that, I am not in Sangu like I stormed off saying. I told Seron- you remember Eddie's assistant- to book me a flight to Sangu, but when I got there I was only thinking of seeing you so I changed the ticket.\" \"Now why in the world would you do that? What if Eddie flies to Sangu to find you and you are nowhere to be found? He's going to think you're hurt or something.\" At this moment Paige knew that her mother's prediction was probably right. She knew that she had to call him. But, then again if he really loves her he'll read and understand the note. And he'll know exactly what to do. Or he might not even go up to their room, and not find the note. Her heart was racing now. What if he has already left for Sangu? What if he is looking for her there? She slammed the door and ran to the phone in her old bedroom. Dialed Seron quickly, it rang for what feels like hours. Finally, a professionally soft voice answered. \"Mother of her majesty how may I help you?\" \"Seron? It's me.\" \"PAIGE DEAR GOD WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? (he cleared his throat) I mean, your majesty where is your current location?\" \"That is not necessary at this moment Seron. Where is Eddie? I NEED to speak with him. It's an emergency.\" \"One moment please your majesty he is in his study. In fact he has not left his study since you left.\" She heard whispering, and the old hickory door open quickly. There was a shuffling noise through the speaker as Seron gave the phone to Eddie. \"Paige?\" Eddie said with great worry. \"Hi Eddie.\" He paused with a sigh. \"Are you alright? Did the flight go ok to Sangu?\" \"I am fine, our baby is fine. And I didn't go to Sangu.\" \"What do you mean you didn't go to Sangu?\" \"It doesn't matter Eddie, I just wanted to let you know I am ok and that I'm sorry.\" \"Paige you have nothing to be sorry about I should have never left your side and been more communoca-\" She cut him off. \"Eddie I can't take being away from you.\" She said beginning to wipe away tears from her face. \"Baby don't cry. Please don't cry.\" \"Will you come get me?\" \"Of course I'll be there before you know it. But first you're going to have to tell me where you are.\" He said with a chuckle. \"Read the note and you'll know exactly where to go. I love you so much Edvard.\" She hung up the phone before he had the chance to answer. Eddie ran to their bedroom leaving Seron puzzled at his study door. He found the note right where she left it on the nightstand. It read: Love of my life, My actions are only temporary. No matter what I said I love you to the moon and back. Or to where the marbles and tractors meet to a brawl and lead to our first kiss. Love always, Paige and baby He now knew exactly where to go. He and Seron grabbed the jet and flew to America like their lives depended on it. Which to Eddie, it did. Once they arrived, Eddie knew exactly what to say and how to say it. He and Seron raced to her family's barn, and Eddie ran through the now pouring rain to find Paige. In a ball on the floor wrapped in blankets with her head on a pillow of hay. He walked down to her and got on his knees. All that he had planned to say meant nothing now. \"paige?\" He whispered. \"Eddie!\" She said sleepily. As she stood up her shirt caught the top of her baby bump exposing it to Eddie. \"You're showing… when did that happen?\" \"Right before I left I saw it the mirror as you held me up. Our baby is the size of a peach. Did you know?\" \"No I didn't. How about we get you and our little peach inside?\" He leaned in close for a long and slow kiss resting his hand on her stomach. \"There's an apartment upstairs it's warm and we don't have to walk through the rain.\" \"Sounds perfect.\" Eddie said as he motioned for Seron to bring his bag. \"You brought a bag? Don't you have to get back soon?\" \"Not if you don't want to leave for a while. I go where you go.\" Paige gave a soft smile, this was right. Eddie helped her up the stairs and opened the door to a cute little room about the size of a dorm. \"Throwback huh?\" She said with a laugh. They stayed at Paige's parents house for about two days and headed back to Denmark. Paige threw up the entire ride home. \"You're sure you're ok?\" Eddie asked for the hundredth time. \"Eddie I am fine, I should be over this in a couple of weeks. In those couple of weeks Paige's baby bump began to grow bigger and faster than before. Just in time to find out the sex of the baby. Boy or Girl, they both voted opposites. Lets take a poll… Who wants a girl and give a name if you want, and the same for a boy. Ready? Set? REVIEWS![Chapter 8] One week. 7 days. 168 hours. 60,789 minutes. 1,360,000 seconds.

She grabbed a piece of paper and a pen and wrote Eddie a note. She grabbed her purse and headed for the airport. In the car she sat with her hand on her stomach feeling her newly acquired baby bump that she never got to show Eddie.[Chapter 9] \"Are you excited?\" nervously asked paige as she shimmies into a tight shirt. \"Excited to see you in that shirt? Yes. Excited to find out the sex of the baby? I couldn't be more excited.\" \"What if it's a boy? He would be the first heir to the throne.\" As she turned to face Eddie she saw a smile so wide it could touch both ends of the Earth. \"What?\" \"That's what I was thinking about…\" \"Well we are the king and queen. Our people can only hope that the first thing we think about in the thought of our baby is the throne.\" She said starting to giggle. Then she felt a sharp pain in her stomach. She took a deep breath in. \"Is it that pain again? Paige I thought we agreed you'd tell me whenever something didn't feel right?\" Eddie said in response. \"Eddie I'm fine. I promise.\" She then stepped out of the car and walked quickly towards the doors of the hospital as if to escape her questioning husband. As she stepped in the doors of the hospital, she felt that pain again, but on the other side. She was shocked to see a little bump grow on her side when the pain returned a few seconds later. All this time those little pains really were something, but a GOOD something. The baby was kicking. That smile was stuck on her face the whole way back to their room. \"What in the world are you smiling at?\" Eddie said curiously. \"I have something to show you later…\" \"ok… Can you show me now?\" \"It's a bit out of my control. I would if I could.\" \"You're a Queen for gods sake how is it not in your control?\" \"Because I am not a Queen in this situation.\" She said thinking about how she was a MOM, not a queen.[Chapter 10] \"Paige all of these riddles are killing me.\" \"Ok well come on then!\" She said grabbing his arm and pulling him down the hallway. She took a seat on the exam table and motioned for Eddie to sit next to her. He did so willingly. Paige placed his hand on her small but very noticeable baby bump. At that moment the timing could not have been better. Their little boy or girl let out quite the kick. Eddie was in shock as Paige took a slow deep breath. \"That's amazing!\" \"not to ruin the moment or anything but something is wet.\" She said as a tear rolled down her face. \"What do you mean?\" Eddie said going from the happiest man in the world to the man he was not 3 months ago sitting in the waiting room, waiting patiently to see his wife. \"Get the doctor. Quickly Eddie!\" Eddie shuffled to the door and yelled for a doctor. Of course they ALL came running because the King needed help. Eddie grabbed the one closest to him and yanked him into the room. \"She needs help, right now.\" \"Hello, Paige let's go ahead and take everything off from the waist down, and place your feet in the stirrups. My King I need you to leave the room for a moment.\" \"No he can stay, I don't want him to leave.\" She said starting to cry. \"I am not going anywhere.\" Eddie said helping her pull down the jeans she worked so hard to get into this morning. As he pulled down her jeans he saw blood, not a lot. But still blood. \"Doctor…\" \"It looks as though shes having a miscarriage. Go outside and get two nurses and tell them code-232.\" Eddie did as he was told and two nurses came in with her chart, an ultrasound, and a tray of covered equipment. \"I am just going to take a look see, and check out what's going on.\" Paige laid down on the table her stomach exposed. She could hear the doctor asking her questions but she never processed any of them. \"Paige?\" Eddie asked snapping her back into reality. \"what?\" \"Did you feel any pain on the way in? Or earlier in the day?\" The doctor asked as he put the gel on her stomach. \"Yes the baby was kicking me, and right before I felt it the baby was kicking. \"Oh dear.\" The doctor said staring into the monitor. He faced the nurse and gave her a look. Both of them exited closing the doors behind them. \"As I have read in your chart you have had quite the pregnancy so far. I do believe that the placenta has slipped into the way of the baby's feet. Because of the baby being quite the kicker he is releasing the blood out of the placenta. Due to the bleeding in the beginning of the pregnancy your cervical plug released, which means your baby is very vulnerable. She is fine, but all in all you want to be very careful. I want you on bed rest for the rest of the pregnancy only standing up every 3 hours. Ok? I'll leave you two alone to discuss and be back in a few minutes.\" He slipped out of the room and closed the door gently. \"Love I'm so sorry, I shouldn't have pressured yo-\" He saw the smallest little bit of a smile cross her face. \"what are you smiling at?\" \"He said SHE.\" Eddie lost his voice as she started to laugh and cry all at the same time. \"Eddie it's a girl! And she's fine! That's plenty to smile about!\" Eddie just stood there still in shock. Then she went back to reality, again. \"Bedrest!? Is that really necessary?\" \"Yes, it's very necessary.\" The doctor smoothly replied as he walked into the room. \"This is vital to your little girl's survival. I have to advise you to make your greatest attempt to be the laziest bum you can. I'll see you next time ok? Congratulations your majesties.\"[Chapter 11] Hey guys sorry for the update being super short… but in my defense you guys are not really reviewing much. Completely my fault. I need ideas about how Paige goes into labor. C-section or natural? Emergency or Easy going? Disaster or tragedy. You get the ide. Anything helps. Thanks always, the author. \"Good morning my beautiful, glowing wife.\" Eddie said running his fingers through her long blonde hair. \"Well good morning. What's the occasion?\" Paige sleepily replied. \"Just you being beautiful. And it's time to walk around.\" \"Uh finally.\" Paige tried to sit up. She rocked back and forth, then tried to just use her arms. Either way she knew she couldn't get up on her own. Eddie just laughed and extended his hand to help her. \"No. I can do this.\" \"I know you can.\" Eddie said picking her up from under her knees and back setting her feet down gently on the floor. He stood and admired his wife, completely astonished by the way their child was already growing. Paige was now close to 34 weeks pregnant. The baby was the size of a small cantaloupe \"Come on… I am anxious to stretch my legs.\" She said pulling him across the bedroom. \"Alright, alright, take it easy killer. Do you wanna stay in the palace or out through the gardens?\" \"Both?\" Paige said as she kissed him softly. Eddie laughed because her baby bump was so large that whenever they stood to close face to face her belly would rub his. \"Hey, I know I am fat there's no reason to laugh.\" \"Oh, come on Paige you know I was- I didn't mean to-. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.\"He said with a compassionate smile. \"I'm very happy that my wife and cantaloupe are growing. It's good for the both of you.\" \"How in the world is it good for me?\" \"The more your body stretches with the baby the easier the recovery of your normal figure after she's born.\" \"You really did pay attention in that class.\" She said slightly shocked. \"And obviously you didn't.\" \"Speaking of our baby girl, are you still ok with the name? Or the nickname at least?\" \"The name is beautiful, but the nickname is really strange. Do you really want to call her bug? I don't think she'll appreciate it as she grows older.\" \"I bonded with my parents more because we had a great connection, I just want that for our little girl.\" \"I want that too, mama bug.\" \"THAT'S SO CUTE!\" \"No it's not it's weird.\" Eddie said laughing. Paige stopped on a dime. She gave out a large gasp. The baby kicked and the blood rushed down her thighs again. \"I really thought I could make it this time.\" Eddie yelled for Seron who was always in hearing range and sent for Paige's ladies maids. They brought her wheel chair and wheeled her back to her bed to change. Seron had business for Eddie to take care of because no matter what state the queen is in. He is still the King of Denmark. And life goes on in the life of a busy king with a sick wife.[Chapter 12] So sorry for late update! I have been working on other stories and falling in love with more couples so I have totally forgotten to keep up with my stories. MY BAD! Love you guys so much and the reviews/comments! It had been nearly 8 ½ months since they found out they were pregnant. Paige has not been able to walk on her own since the first month. She knows everything about this baby; when she sleeps, when she likes to kick because she's bored, and how she's laying. Eddie however has had to pick up the slack of Paige not being able to travel around the palace on her own. He was running around doing one thing or another and he was exhausted. Every miserable moment of sitting through parliament he just wanted to sleep. But he couldn't because he has a country to run and a baby to prepare for. \"Eddie!\" \"Yes love?\" \"I am going out, I'll see you later.\" \"Ok, be safe!\" Eddie collected his thoughts and started to see what she was doing. She was trying to escape her bed rest. \"Wait a minute Paige.\" He muffled out starting at a sprint from his office. \"What?\" \"Where do you think you're going?\" \"Shopping.\" \"Shopping? You're on bed rest Paige we've been over this.\" \"Yes we have. But if you had showed up to my appointment yesterday you would have known that I can leave the house if I have a wheel chair and I am not standing up for more than a minute at a time.\" \"The appointment! I completely forgot!\" \"Yeah I noticed.\" Paige roared slightly annoyed. \"Paige, you know I didn't do it on purpose I have just been so busy since you haven't really…\" \"Since I haven't really what? Been around? Well you're the one keeping me confined to my room 23 hours a day. I have been asking for work for 2 months and you have not given me anything to do. With that being- oohf- being- god!- being said you don't get. To. Be. Mad.\" Paige was struggling to talk. This alarmed the king to the greatest depths. \"What's happening? Talk to me baby.\" He said alarmed walking over to her. \"Contractions, it's really not that big of a deal… ahh dang it!\" The pain was starting to be a little bad. She felt wetness between her legs again. \"Aw man really?\" \"What? You're having contractions!?\" \"Relax. They're just Braxton Hicks contractions. They'll go away in a minute.\" \"How long have these been happening?\" \"Since last night. I looked it up they're completely natural.\" \"Why didn't you wake me up?\" \"Well honestly I tried. You were too tired.\" \"Paige I am so sorry.\" He said kissing her on the forehead. \"it's ok, I just need my husband back.\" \"I am right here.\" \"Now, you are going to march yourself back to yourself back to your office, and I am going to go shopping. I will talk to you later ok?\" \"I don't know, maybe I should…\" \"NO. I need to spend some time with me, and your daughter's grandmothers.\" \"Oh. Sounds like fun.\" He said with a smirk. \"Shut up.\" Paige said laughing. As Paige wheeled herself back to the room she could feel the blood was more than usual. She had decided that was going to try to change her pants on her own because she knew the blood would upset Eddie and he would get all protective. As she strategically pulled down he sweatpants sh saw there was in fact no blood. She had just peed herself. She began to laugh a little bit, something she had not done on her own for a while. Paige went about her shopping trip with contractions every 30 minutes or so each getting more powerful as it went on. \"I think it's time to go home. This baby is not very happy with all of this movement.\" Paige said to her mother and Eddie's mother. They both agreed and wheeled her towards the car. Once they were settled Paige had another big contraction. She began to breathe heavily. The ladies maids awkwardly helped Paige into the bathroom. Whenever Paige was bleeding, it was best for someone else to undress her. But this time was different. She felt warm and fuzzy and the baby was in a really weird position. But she let them continue just in case. The ladies maids were beginning to silently whisper to each other. \"What is it?\" Paige asked slightly annoyed. The two looked at each other until one replied, \"It's clear. We think your water has broken.\" \"Oh my goodness. Please run a bath, help me into it, and tell no one.\" \"Yes your majesty.\" They said in unison. Paige lay in the tub for about 30 minutes before her stomach painfully tightens. She lay there struggling to stay silent now knowing she is truly in labor. She wanted Eddie but she knew it would be a while before he was done with what needed to be done. Paige told her self over and over that she would be fine. The contractions started to become closer and closer until the pain began to be too much for her to be silent. She yelled loud enough during a contraction that she was sure the whole palace could hear. \"Oh, great.\" She thought to herself. She could now hear at least 5 people outside the door, she ignored them trying to reach the towel. Once she had grasped the towel and placed it over places not needed to be seen, Eddie softly yet quickly opened the door. \"Paige was that you screaming? Why are you in the bathtub, it's only 2:00?\" \"Well you see, there's a thing that keeps happening, its kind of… contractions.\" \"Yeah we talked about them earlier they're just Braxton Hix.\" \"Well that's what I thought too except, my water broke while we were shopping. I thought I had just peed my self but it wasn't pee on pants.\" \"Are you..?\" \"Well it would seem so, yes, I am in labor..\" ","Summary":" \"Paige? Paige darling, are you awake?\" Edvard quietly whispered to a sleeping Paige. \"I am now…,"},{"Movie":"Prince & Me","Title":"Prince and Me (Part 3): The Royal Wedding","Author":"Cara223","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11751367","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter 1 After everything that had happened, like our break-up and miscarrying the baby, Eddie decided that an evening out with him, my mother, and my brother would be good for me, especially since they were going to leave in a few days. I sat in the front seat with Eddie and would turn around to talk to my mother and brother. It was so nice to have them around, especially during this hard time. I would really miss them when they left. I had officially caught up on all of my schoolwork, and my teachers even had excused my absences after I provided a doctor's note, verifying that I truly needed to miss those days. My life was slowly becoming normal again. Well, a normal life for a girl engaged to the King of Denmark. The press continued harassing us, especially after Johnny yelled at them and told them that I had just miscarried. However, the palace refused to talk to any of them or answer any of their questions. Every magazine and TV show was buzzing about the possibility of a royal baby as well as the royal scandal. Apparently if we had a child together without getting married, the child wouldn't have been in line for the throne according to Danish law. Eddie told me that if I had not lost the child, he would have fought to change the law since we were going to married. Continuing about the press, they were still forbidden to corner me at school, and sometimes I would see security walking around campus. I know that the security was for me. Actually, I should have a bodyguard, but I explained to Eddie that it wasn't necessary at school. If I ever felt like I was in danger, I promised that I would call him or one of the security guards but so far, I had no issues. I turned to Eddie in the car and for the first time in a long time, I felt genuinely happy. I was surrounded by those who loved me, and I couldn't be happier. Eddie was being super supportive and understanding after losing the baby. Even though I was still mourning and sad about everything that had happened, I was able to come to terms with it all and slowly move on and continue my life. \"So, when is the big day? Have you decided on a date yet?\" My mom asked me. \"Yeah, speculation about the date has been all over the tabloids. I figured I could sell them the date and make a little extra cash before I went back to school,\" Johnny said, jokingly. I turned around and tried to hit him playfully. \"You're not allowed to talk to the press anymore,\" Eddie said laughing, but I knew he was referring to when Johnny yelled at the reporters and told them that I had a miscarriage and to leave alone. \"I know, my mouth speaks before my brain thinks. Next time, I'll make something up really juicy,\" Johnny said laughing. Even though I was originally mad at Johnny for telling the world my secret, which explained why I was in the hospital, I understood about getting caught up in the moment and yelling at the press. I had done it before too. \"The press would have figured it out sooner or later,\" I said. \"They're sneaky like that.\" \"So, seriously- when do you both want to have the wedding?\" My mom asked. I turned to Eddie and smiled. We had discussed a date, but nothing was set in stone yet. \"Well,\" Eddie said smiling back at me. \"We were thinking about this summer. That way, Paige would be out of school. Also, it gives us the six months needed to do the marriage preparation in order to get married in the church.\" \"Our biggest issue is that I want a Catholic wedding, and Eddie wants a Lutheran wedding,\" I said. \"So, we have to decide on that before we find a minister and a church,\" I explained. \"Every Danish royal has been married by a Lutheran minister, and their children are later christened as Lutheran,\" Eddie argued calmly. \"It's tradition!\" \"And we are all Catholic,\" my mom said. \"We're talking about it,\" I said. \"Although the one thing that we have agreed on is that we don't want a huge royal wedding. We want a private wedding that is shared with just our close family and friends. It'll have to be a secret from the press. So Johnny- no talking to anyone!\" I said turning around to smile at him. \"We just want it to be a day that we share with the people we care about and not the entire country.\" \"My mother and the people will be furious about it, but I don't want all of our moves, motions and words analyzed the entire day. Normal weddings are stressful enough; we don't need the extra stress. We just want to enjoy the day.\" Eddie explained. \"Well, at least you've agreed on something,\" my mom said. \"The only issue is the planning the wedding. We may have to give the press a fake date so that Paige can go dress shopping, we go cake shopping together, plan the wedding, etc. Otherwise, the press will know,\" Eddie explained. \"But what about the food? If the food is delivered early, the press will be all over it,\" my mom asked. \"We've thought about that,\" I said. \"We'd ask the kitchen staff to prepare the food for the reception. We'll say that it is for a party, which is true. Also, even if they suspect anything, they can't say anything that goes on in the palace. They'd be dismissed if they did. The only thing is getting the cake on time...\" I said, thinking. \"We'll figure it out,\" Eddie said reassuringly. I smiled at him, completely unaware of the next challenge that we would be facing in our relationship. Chapter 2 Eddie's Point of View: After finishing yet another boring day at Parliament, I was extremely relieved when I heard them come to an agreement on the current tax issue. Thankfully, taxes were not being raised and were decided to be lowered .5%. I knew that the Danish people would be thrilled to hear the news. Since we had finished with that item off of the agenda, it was time that I added my own item onto the list. \"Gentlemen, as many of you already know, Ms. Paige Morgan and I are engaged to be married. Now, according to Danish law, I need the approval of Parliament as well as the acting retired queen, which is currently my mother, in order to proceed with this marriage. Since we have finished with the discussion on taxes, I was hoping we could get your approval and then we could move onto the next item- public school system,\" I said, looking over at my agenda and writing a quick note. Some of the members of Parliament nodded at me, giving their approval of my idea, while others looked dumbfounded at me. \"What makes you think you're going to get our approval?\" I heard Alfred, a member of Parliament, ask me. I laughed nervously. \"Well, I don't quite understand why we wouldn't get your approval,\" I said, being confident in my words and actions. \"There are a few reservations about Ms. Morgan that need to be discussed,\" Fredrick, another member, replied. \"Like what? What are you concerned about?\" I asked, leaning forward slightly in my chair. Now, I was getting concerned. Was this seriously going to be an issue? \"I don't believe that we should get involved in these types of matters. I think we should simply give our approval and move onto the next item,\" George argued for me. \"Unlike several of you, I have personally met Ms. Morgan, and she has outstanding qualities that would make her an excellent queen.\" \"I just think that this matter needs to be discussed and not simply pushed under the rug,\" Alfred said. \"I agree,\" Fredrick chimed in. \"I have several reservations about her.\" \"Would someone please tell me about these reservations?\" I asked. \"Because I truly don't see what the issue is here.\" \"There are several rumors circulating about Ms. Morgan. She hasn't been faithful to you, she appears to have an addiction problem, and we just don't believe she is here for the right reasons,\" Fredrick said. \"She has been faithful to me, and she was in the hospital not for an addiction problem but due to a rather personal reason. We both love each other,\" I protested. \"We just think that the next Queen of Denmark shouldn't have these type of rumors circulating since there is usually some truth to them,\" Alfred said. \"What happened between me and Ms. Morgan stays between us. Granted, we have had some obstacles, but we have worked through everything,\" I said, pointing to the picture of Paige \"kissing\" Jake. Alfred had started getting out newspaper clippings and placing them on the table. I didn't feel like getting into that it was fake and everything else that had happened. \"Then, she was in the hospital for a drug overdose and then the media was reporting that she was pregnant...It's just scandal after scandal. We can't have that here,\" Alfred said, going through the newspaper articles. \"You do realize that 99% of those rumors are completely false, right?\" I said. \"The press is always printing rumors and lies! This is nothing new,\" I argued. \"Then please explain all of these rumors to us,\" Fred demanded. \"We want to hear the truth.\" \"Look, I don't know everything that goes on in your personal lives and just because I'm royal, doesn't mean you should know everything that is going on in mine. If I were in your position, I would grant permission for the marriage regardless of my own personal feelings to the fiancée. It's not your decision to make,\" I said, avoiding the question. \"You didn't answer the question,\" the Prime Minister said. \"In regards to the photo, it was photo-shopped,\" I said sighing heavily. \"With all of the technology today, it isn't a surprise that someone who doesn't want this union to take place tried to sabotage Ms. Morgan's good name. In regards to her being in the hospital, she was in for a rather personal reason. I'm going to leave it up to Ms. Morgan whether she wants everyone to know about her recent stay in the hospital,\" I said. I looked at my fellow members of Parliament. Some seemed to believe me while others stared at me with looks of disbelief on their faces. They didn't believe me.\" \"We'll need to discuss this further and vote within the next week,\" the Prime Minister said. \"We would rather debate without you here. Please enjoy the time off until further notice,\" he said, motioning for me to leave. \"You're joking, right? Aren't you making a huge ordeal about this?\" I asked, laughing nervously. \"No,\" the Alfred replied. \"Fine,\" I said, gathering my stuff and leaving the room. I knew that the Prime Minister was on my side and that he was just doing what he had to do, but I was still infuriated. Could they actually deny me the right to marry Paige? And if we were denied, what would I do? Where would we go? I would leave the throne without any reservation in order to marry Paige, but was I really prepared to give up the only life that I ever knew? I decided to head over to the University of Copenhagen. Paige would be getting out class in a few minutes. Once I arrived there, I parked, looked at her class schedule, and walked to where she would be leaving. I want to surprise her. Honestly, I was furious with Parliament, and I wanted to leave the country right now. Even though I knew that wasn't possible, I couldn't help but imagine what it would be like to be completely free of my responsibilities. \"Eddie!?\" I heard an excited voice exclaim. I turned and I saw my beautiful fiancée walking quickly towards me. \"What a nice surprise,\" Paige said leaning up to kiss me since she was slightly shorter than me. \"Aren't you supposed to be in Parliament right now?\" She asked. \"It's a long story, but I got out early. I wanted to come and surprise you,\" I said, gently stroking her arm. \"Well, this was a very nice surprise,\" she said very giddy as she took my hand and squeezed it. We were so in love! Couldn't others see that!? \"Do you need to go study? Or do you have some time?\" I asked her. I knew that she had been stressing out about a test. \"The studying can wait,\" she said smiling. \"It isn't everyday that you get out of Parliament so early!\" Paige exclaimed, excited. \"How did your doctor's appointment go this morning?\" I asked her as we walked hand-in-hand to the car. Ever since she had the ectopic pregnancy, she had to get her blood drawn once a week to monitor her hCG levels (the pregnancy hormone). \"It went well. My hCG levels are still pretty high, so she decided to draw my blood again. She wants to see me again next week, and she gave me some vitamin supplement to take, which should help get things back to normal. She told me not to worry about it.\" I heaved a sigh of relief. Even though I knew everything was going to be okay, I still worried when I heard that her hCG levels were still present. I opened the car door for her and then got around to the driver's side. \"So, Parliament was interesting today,\" I said after she discussed her classes and her doctor appointment. \"How so?\" She asked, looking up inquisitively at me. \"They have to approve our marriage,\" I explained. \"I brought it up after we finished the last item on the agenda so that they could approve it, and we could move on to the next item, but they are giving us a hard time about it. It looks like it may not get approved,\" I explained. \"They want to think about it and debate about it, which was why I was removed from the room.\" I looked over at her to see her reaction. It was hard to read it; she wasn't showing much emotion. \"So, what are you going to do?\" She asked me. \"I don't know,\" I said, sighing. \"If they deny it, I can appeal it for them to reconsider it again, but that is about it. I just wanted to let you know what was going on.\" \"You don't know!?\" She exclaimed, getting upset. \"You aren't going to fight for us? What does this mean for us!?\" Oh shoot. She was asking what this meant about our relationship. I thought she was asking what I was going to do about Parliament. \"Oh no, Paige, I was referring to Parliament. I don't know what is going on with them. If we are denied marriage by them, we'll still be together. That isn't a question. Don't worry. I'm not going to let them tear us apart, even if they do deny our marriage. They can't stop us from leaving the country and getting married.\" Paige heaved a sigh of relief, and she let her guard down. \"Sorry, I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions,\" she said. \"It's okay. I worded it strangely. It will be weird though to abdicate the throne though and my title. I've only known life in Denmark as a Royal...\" I said, trailing off and getting pensive. \"So you don't want to give it up,\" She asked although it was more like a statement. \"I'm saying that it's going to be hard and that it is going to be an adjustment. But I'm willing to do if it means I can spend the rest of my life with you,\" I said, taking her hand and squeezing it. \"Surely, you have to understand that it's going to be an adjustment,\" I said. \"I do. I've been trying to adjust to your life,\" she said. \"I've been adjusting to the rules, the formalities, and having my every move documented and analyzed. Would you be mad at me if I said that I am almost relieved that we may be leaving?\" she asked me. I was slightly taken aback by her comments. Was she unhappy here? Did she want to leave? \"You aren't happy here?\" I asked. \"Of course, I'm happy here. It's just been a huge adjustment. I just feel like the biggest obstacles in our relationship are the differences in our lifestyles, the press, and our expectations and duties...\" She trailed off, looking out the window. \"I just think that everything would be so much simpler if you weren't...royal.\" I understood where she was coming from and sometimes I even felt the same way. \"I understand what you are saying, and I've thought the same before,\" I said. I saw out of the corner of my eye that she looked up with surprise. \"We'll figure it out- don't worry,\" I said reassuringly. \"If we are denied marriage here, then we will move to the US and start a life here. If we are granted a marriage here, we will keep all of our options and possibilities open. We want what will be best for us,\" I said. Paige leaned over and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I continued driving, completely unaware of our future. It was scary when I thought about it but as long as Paige was along side me, everything would be okay. Wouldn't it?[Chapter 2] Paige's point of view: After spending a wonderful afternoon with Eddie (we watched Netflix and played Air Hockey) and having a wonderful dinner with him, we retired to my room. I had to study and do homework, but I didn't want to leave him for the night. Plus, we needed to discuss our future more in private. We couldn't really discuss this out in the open even in the palace. People from Parliament could easily overhear us or palace staff, and then the royal family would be all over the tabloids again (even though we already were on every single magazine.. mostly me though). Eddie went to his room to go get his paperwork from the US (his old student visa and his old visitor's visa when he spent the summer with me), and I pulled up my laptop to research the process of brining him back to the US as well as pulled up my bank statements from the US. We would be starting over with literally nothing. \"I found these papers,\" Eddie said coming into my room and closing the door behind him. He walked over and joined me on top of my bed and put the paperwork down. I picked them up to look at them. \"Your student visa has expired,\" I said putting the one paper down. \"And your visitor's visa expires in a month,\" I said putting the other paper down. \"What are the next steps?\" He asked me, looking over my shoulder at my laptop. \"We need to fill out this from called an I-I130. It may be easier to bring you in if we are already married, but I'm not sure. Beth's father is an immigration officer; I was planning on asking him if that was okay,\" I said looking over at Eddie. He nodded and then I continued my explanation. \"The form isn't so bad, we just need to fill out your basic information,\" I said scrolling and showing him the form. \"And there is $300 dollar processing fee.\" \"Occupation?\" Eddie said, stopping me from scrolling. \"What do I put there? King of Denmark?\" he asked. \"I guess. You can't exactly lie...the US government is going to run every background check on you possible before they let me bring you into the country. And once we get to the US, we'll have immigration checking in on us to make sure that we are actually married,\" I explained. \"Are you serious?\" Eddie asked me. \"Their going to check up on us?\" \"They want to make sure that we are truly married and that you didn't just marry me to come into the country,\" I explained, which caused Eddie to laugh. \"Americans,\" he mumbled under his breath. \"I don't make the rules,\" I said hitting him playfully. \"And since I really don't think Parliament will ever approve our marriage, what happens once we get to the United States?\" he asked me. \"I'm sure my parents will let us stay with them for a week or so until we find our own apartment. But we'll have to both get jobs and save up money right away, even if it's something simple like working at a coffee shop. I have $3,000 saved up in my bank account, but that isn't going to get us very far. We're going to need to get a car too. Plus, I have $25,000 in student loan debt that we are going to need to pay back...\" Eddie's eyes bugged out. \"You're joking, right?\" He asked. \"I wish I was...\" I said trailing off. \"Who's paying off your loans now?\" he asked. \"I'm in educational deferment since I am in medical school. But once I stop going to medical school, they are going to want me to start making payments.\" \"What are you going to do about Medical School if we go to the US?\" Eddie asked me, concerned. \"I don't want you to give up on your dream,\" he said, taking my hand and tracing the lines on my palm with his fingertip. \"I may have to take a semester off and work so we can save up some money. Or I may have to go part-time and work part-time. I'm not sure what to do...\" I said trailing off. \"We'll figure it out though,\" I said. \"Wow...I never realized how hard being...umm...normal was,\" Eddie said. \"Yeah, it can be rough, but with money management and hard work, we'll be able to figure it out,\" I said, trying to be reassuring. \"So, what are we looking at for monthly expenses?\" he asked me. \"At least $650 a month or so for a descent apartment, plus student loan payment of roughly $150-$200 a month, about $250-$300 on food, and plus a car payment of a few hundred dollars, depending on what car we get. Also, that doesn't include any furniture. You have to remember that are going to be starting with nothing. I'm my parents will let take my bed, my dresser, my night table and my desk. My bed is small, but it'll work till we can get something bigger. But we aren't going to have any couches, tables, or anything. We could maybe skip a TV and just watch Netflix on a laptop. I'd be cheaper than cable. I do have a laptop back at my parent's house. We'll also have to do laundry and get internet and that doesn't include utilities like water and electricity. All of this can easily be another $20o or more a month.\" \"So, what are we looking at?\" Eddie asked me. \"Around $1,358 dollars a month...at least,\" I said showing him the number on my phone after doing the math. \"I didn't even calculate in cell phone cost per month...\" I said adding more numbers into my cell phone. Eddie sighed heavily. \"So, we'll be screwed, basically,\" he said. \"Not screwed...it's going to be rough. There is no doubt about it. But we don't know what the future is going to hold. We may get good jobs where we won't have to worry as much or we may get minimum wage paying jobs where we are going to have to watch every single penny we spend.\" \"Where do you want to live in the US? I know you wanted to go to John Hopkins for medical school...\" Eddie said trailing off. \"I was thinking we'd go back to Wisconsin. We'll need help, especially in the beginning and it may be nice to be close to my parents. I was thinking of going back to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where we studied for our undergrad. They have a good medical program, and it'll allow me...us to be closer to home while we get on our feet. As job opportunities come up, we can always move later. Maybe my parents will let us do laundry at their place until we get our own washer and dryer. We'd get to save money on a laundry mat too,\" I explained. \"And I'm sure they'll invite us over for dinner. Worst case scenario, maybe my dad could hire us to work on the farm until we get a steady job. I'm not sure though; I know things are tight for them. But maybe he could help us get a job at a different farm or help just find a job...\" \"Wow...just wow,\" Eddie said tracing his fingers through his short, dark blond hair. \"We'll figure it out and get through it all,\" I said trying to be assuring. I closed my laptop and laid down on my bed, and Eddie looked at me, concerned. \"Are you okay?\" he asked me. \"I'm just tired, really tired,\" I replied, trying to smile. Eddie laid down next to me, pulled me into his chest and gently kissed me on the top of my head. \"It would have been 4 months today,\" I said quietly. Eddie held me closer to him. \"You would have been 4 months pregnant today?\" he asked. I nodded and wiped a tear away from my face. \"I always remember at my appointments. It's hard sometimes to go and to remember what could have been...\" I said trailing off. Eddie kissed me on my head again, and I turned to look at him. \"I'm always here to for you. And I know it will always be hard but with time, it will become slightly easier. But I don't want us to forget. I got you a little something; it's in my room. I was waiting for the right time to give it to you, and I think now is the correct time. Come with me,\" he said taking my hand. I got up off of my bed and followed him down a flight of stairs to his bedroom. Then, we walked down the hallway. The Royal Family lived on a separate floor than others. I was considered to be a \"guest\" and not yet a part of the royal family, so I was placed on a separate floor. Eddie wanted to move me down to where he was, but his mother was adamant about my room when I first came back. Now, even though Eddie was not speaking to her and neither was I, it was simply too much work to move me. Plus, I liked my room, and I was comfortable in there now. Eddie's room was the King's chambers and was all the way at the end of the hallway. Simply put, his room was basically a mini-apartment. There was his giant comfy bed, a living area with a TV, a study area, even a cooking area with his own refrigerator, stove and microwave, his own private bathroom with a giant bathtub and a separate shower. And don't even get me started on his closet- it was gigantic. He opened his door, and we entered together. I sat down on his couch (yes, he had a couch and a chair in room...we probably won't have an apartment this large when we go back to the US). Eddie came over by me and sat down close next to me and handed me a small box. I opened it and saw a small delicate necklace. I lifted the necklace from the box and saw an angel charm at the bottom. One the back, there it said October-November and then the current year. \"Our child is a new angel in heaven and was an angel sent to us. And then I put the month of conception and the month that you miscarried,\" Eddie said putting it on me. \"Thank you so much. I love it,\" I told him, feeling the tears coming into my eyes. \"This way we'll never forget,\" he said pulled me into his chest. \"It's okay, you can cry,\" he said, feeling me trying to hold my emotions in. \"I'm sorry,\" I sobbed. \"I just sometimes feel like it's all my fault,\" I said. \"It's not, Paige. It's not your fault. You had no control over this,\" he said. \"I know...I guess, as scared as I was, I just felt this bond right away when I found out I was expecting. And then I miscarried...\" I trailed off, beginning to sob. \"It's okay to cry and it's okay to feel sad. But we will always love our little angel,\" Eddie said beginning to choke up as well. I nodded as I cried into his chest. \"I don't want you to ever feel like you are alone in this. We are in this together. I will always be by your side until the day I die,\" Eddie told me. I looked up at him and began to rub his cheek lovingly with my hand. \"And I will always be by your side until I take my last breath, loving you and supporting you,\" I replied. Eddie leaned forward and kissed me very passionately and hard. He pulled me closer to him as he began to kiss me more passionately and with more force. His lips were crushing into mine, and I hated the short distance between us so I moved even closer to him. Eddie pulled away abruptly and was breathless. \"What's wrong?\" I asked him, putting my arms around his neck. \"I'm getting a little carried away; I'm sorry,\" he said pulling me into a hug. As he pulled me closer to him, I began to plant gently kisses on his jawline and neck. After the miscarriage, I had avoided having any physical relations with Eddie. First, the doctor told me that my body needed at least 6 weeks to heal after the miscarriage. Second, I was told that it would be really easy to get pregnant again since my body had been preparing for a baby. Third, I wasn't read to be physical again with him, and I was terrified of getting pregnant again. After this loss, I wasn't ready for a baby and if I did get pregnant, I would be terrified of losing it. The last time we had relations was when I conceived... Eddie was extremely understanding, and he knew I wasn't purposely trying to distance myself from him. It had been 6 weeks past my \"all clear\" from my doctor. I found out in mid October that I was expecting, lost the baby about two weeks later, and it was now the 2nd week in January. I had just started my second semester of medical school after spending two and a half wonderful weeks with my family for Christmas. Eddie had come with me and during that time, we had no idea that we would probably be living in the US once we were married. Otherwise, we would have tried to figure out how to live once we get married. When I was there, I had gotten some counseling from my church's priest about the miscarriage, and I was beginning to come to terms with it all. My dad was pretty upset over everything that had happened and unintentionally gave Eddie a hard time for a few days but in the end, my dad was supportive of both of us. It was dates (like today) that opened up some of the old wounds again. Eddie and I began cuddling and watched the Hunger Games . It was moments like this that I absolutely loved. It was just us. There was no one here to interrupt us to annoy us. After the movie, I took Eddie's hand and began moving my hand up and down his arm lovingly. \"What do you want to do now?\" He asked me. \"Do you need to study?\" At that moment, I wanted to move on from all of the pain that I had experienced these past few months. I felt secure and safe with Eddie. My fears were pushed out of my mind. I was ready to move on. I was ready to remember what had happened but not to dwell on it anymore. \"Come with me,\" I told Eddie and took him by his hand. I gently led him over to his bed and began to kiss him. \"I'm ready,\" I whispered in Eddie's ear as we broke apart, moving my hands up and down his chest. His eyes looked at me surprised. \"Are you sure?\" He asked me. \"Yes,\" I replied and then leaned in and kissed him. \"I want to remember what happened, but I don't want to dwell on it anymore. I don't want my pain to stop me from living.\" \"If you get uncomfortable or want to stop at anytime, you just say the word,\" he told me obviously ready but worried that I wasn't ready. \"I will,\" I said pulling him on the bed with me where we made passionate love.[Chapter 3] A few days later, Rosalind requested to have a meeting with me and Eddie. Even though Eddie wasn't talking to his mother after she deliberately tried to ruin our relationship, Eddie grudgingly agreed because she wanted to talk to us about Parliament. Parliament still hadn't made a decision about giving us permission to wed, and it had almost been a week. Eddie assumed it was because they were going to tell us no while I wanted to believe that there was maybe a person or two in there fighting for us behind closed doors. Regardless, we would end up together since we would simply leave the country, but Parliament didn't know that. \"Paige,\" Rosalind told me as we were all seated in a private room downstairs. It was me, Eddie, Soren, King Harold, and a few random people in the room. I recognized the one man as Eddie's bodyguard as well as Rosalind's and Harold's bodyguards, but there were two random people in the room who I had never seen before. \"The issue with Parliament,\" Rosalind continued, \"is that they don't see you as a member of the royal family or as the future Queen of Denmark. They view you as a pawn to play with,\" Rosalind continued. \"Like you,\" Eddie mumbled under his breath next to me. Rosalind ignored his comment and continued. \"So, from now on, you are going to be treated like a true member of the royal family. Please meet Christian and Desiree. Christian is Danish and Desiree is a Danish American, who was born in the United States but raised here in Denmark. Desiree is your bodyguard,\" she said pointing to a women in her mid-thirties with long dark hair and blue eyes, \"while Christian going to be your in-taker,\" she said pointing to a tall older man in early sixties with gray hair. \"He will run personal errands for you, help you make decisions when you are Queen, and will make you daily schedule. He will make any appointments for you, answer your e-mails if needed, and do anything that you need him to do. Desiree will follow you around everywhere while Christian will be available when you need him. He currently manages the kitchen and agreed to take on this task as well,\" Rosalind explained. They bowed slightly while I tried to smile at them. I was going to have my own personal in-taker and bodyguard!? I didn't like these ideas at all. \"You will also get your own royal cell phone,\" she said handing me the most current edition of a black i-phone. \"All of the contacts that you need are in there, including Desiree and Christian. You can add other people from your old contact list who you want to keep in touch with. Be careful who you give your new Danish number out to,\" Rosalind warned. My head was spinning. There was more to be royal that what I was used to doing? \"One more thing,\" Rosalind said as I groaned slightly. There was more? \"You need new clothes. I know you love your jeans and your...umm...yoga pants,\" she was wincing slightly at the last part, \"but you'll be the Queen of Denmark as soon as you marry Edvard. It's time you start attending more royal events, and you also need to start dressing the part. Desiree has agreed to take you shopping as soon as possible,\" Rosalind explained. \"So, I can't wear jeans or yoga pants to school anymore?\" I asked. Rosalind sighed heavily. \"I suppose it's fine with school and of course, around the palace here when we have no formal events going on. I'd rather you start wearing skirts and casual dresses to school, but-\" \"I don't see why she can't wear jeans or yoga pants to school, mother,\" Eddie said shortly. \"It isn't a fashion show.\" \"Fine, I suppose she can...\" Rosalind said. \"We'll address that again later in a few weeks.\" I could feel the tension between Eddie and Rosalind in the room, and I'm sure that everyone else could too. \"I don't need a personal in-taker or a body guard,\" I protested to Rosalind. \"I've been fine managing on my own,\" I said. Rosalind sighed heavily. \"You're too trusting of people, Paige. You need a bodyguard with you at all times,\" Rosalind stated firmly. \"But you don't have a bodyguard with you every time you leave palace and neither does Eddie,\" I protested again. \"I don't need one going to school. I'm perfectly safe,\" I argued. \"Parliament isn't taking you seriously. They don't view you as a royal. They view you as Edvard's current fling that will end soon. You need to act like who you will be soon- the future Queen of Denmark,\" Rosalind stated firmly. I sighed. She wasn't going to back down. I looked to Eddie for him to back me up. \"Can't we try to compromise? Paige is having a hard enough adjusting as is...\" Eddie said, trailing off. \"No, there is nothing to compromise on. Desiree will be following Paige around for her own safety and whenever Paige needs anything done, she will go to Christian,\" Rosalind stated very firmly. I sighed. Now I'd have a body guard following me? \"I'll leave you meet your new team. I'm trying to help, Edvard,\" Rosalind said staring at Eddie. The tension in the room between them was very loud and clear. I'm sure Soren, Christian, and Desiree noted it. I tried to keep my attitude down to a minimum since I wasn't trusting of Rosalind at all. \"Should we trust her?\" I whispered to Eddie. \"As of now, I don't think we have a choice if we want Parliament to approve our marriage,\" Eddie whispered back. I sighed heavily and walked over with Eddie to meet Christian and Desiree. \"Hello, it's nice to meet you\" I said extending my hand. They looked confused at me extending my hand to them at first, but Desiree took it and shook it and then Christian followed afterwards. Eddie told me later that is wasn't appropriate for them to shake my hand as being a future member of the royal family. \"If you need anything at all, Ms. Paige, just let me know,\" Christian said. \"Please, don't ever hesitate to ask me either,\" he said, trying to be friendly. \"Of course,\" I said smiling at him even though I wasn't planning on ever using him. \"Miss Paige,\" Desiree said bowing her head slightly. She seemed firm, and I could tell that nothing or no one would ever intimidate her, which is a good thing since she was going to be my bodyguard. \"It's nice to meet you,\" I replied. \"Please send me your class schedule and your daily itinerary. It's my job to protect you. Also, let me know when you would like to go shopping. Queen Rosalind told me that we need a lot of work. Finally, don't try to avoid me. I will find you and protect you. It's my job,\" she stated as though it was a matter of fact. I will find you? I thought to myself. That wasn't weird at all...I was taken aback by her brazenness, but then I remembered that Rosalind hired her. \"Of course,\" I said, trying to smile. \"Well, thank you. It's been a pleasure. Paige will be in touch very soon,\" Eddie said taking my hand. He nodded to them, and they nodded back. Then, Eddie squeezed my hand, and we left the room. \"Seriously!?\" I whispered to him as he closed the door behind him. \"My mother insists that this will help make Parliament take us more seriously. It won't hurt to give it a try,\" Eddie said. \"She isn't going to literally follow you around everywhere...I think. Maybe you can arrange for her to be on campus instead of your actual classes with you. I can understand you don't want her sitting next to you all the time. On the plus side, I do think you do need some protection. I'd worry about you walking to school at the time alone,\" Eddie told me. \"But I enjoyed walking to school. It was a choice that I made,\" I argued. \"I know, and I'm sorry. I just think it's better for you to walk with someone else, like me,\" he said pulling me closer to him. I couldn't help but giggle. \"Do you want to go outside and do some wedding planning?\" Eddie whispered in my ear. I nodded enthusiastically. \"Let me go get my laptop in my room,\" I said giving him a quick kiss on the lips. Eddie and I ran up to my room together to get my laptop. As soon as I closed the door behind us, Eddie immediately began kissing me. \"I haven't had a chance to do this today because you left so early,\" he mumbled in my ear, referring to my internship this morning. I had to be there at 6:30am today. I pulled Eddie closer to me as he continued to kiss me. The feeling was electrifying. \"We need to stop if we want to get any wedding planning done,\" I said pulling away slightly, and Eddie retreated. \"You are unfortunately right,\" he said leaning in to kiss me one last time. \"Do you want to take a walk? Or do you want to stay in my room?\" I asked him. \"It's so beautiful outside. Plus, no one can overhear us then,\" he said. \"True,\" I agreed. We walked outside and sat down on the bench in front of the garden scenery and the lake. \"I love it here,\" I said as we sat down. \"I can just sit out here forever. I remember when you proposed to me here...for the first time,\" I said laughing. \"For the first time,\" Eddie repeated, laughing with me. \"It's okay because we found our way back to each other,\" I said squeezing his hand. \"We always do,\" he said squeezing it back and smiling at me. \"So, getting down to business,\" I said opening up my laptop and finding our wedding file. It was password encrypted so no one could ever open the file. \"Yes, we need to plan this wedding before you change your mind,\" Eddie joked, laughing. \"Haha, very funny,\" I said hitting him playfully, and I couldn't help but laugh either. \"So, I know we were in disagreement before about what church we were going to get married in and I've it a lot of thought. I'm breaking tradition by marrying a non-royal, so I figured it wouldn't hurt to break tradition one more time. So, how about we get married at Jesu Hjerte Kirke,\" he said pronouncing the name in Danish. I loved it when he spoke in Danish. \"It's a beautiful Catholic Church in Copenhagen, and it's right on the water. I'm sure we could find a place to have the reception too around there,\" Eddie said. \"I would like for our Luthern Bishop to be there though, precising along with the priest,\" Eddie explained. \"Really?\" I exclaimed. \"I know it means a lot to you and your family to be married in a Catholic church, so I want you to have that. So maybe tomorrow, once you get out of class, I can pick you up and we can go over and talk to someone about getting married?\" Eddie asked me. I leaned in and gave him a quick kiss on the lips. \"I would love that,\" I responded. \"So, I guess we need to finally decide on a date to see if it's available,\" Eddie said. \"Maybe July? At least in the US, the church has a waiting period for couples. Usually about 4-6 months,\" I said. \"So, even if it was six months, we would be able to do it in July since it's the middle of January,\" I said. \"And it's surprisingly warm today at 40 degrees for January,\" Eddie commented. \"Well, I heard Saturday morning will be 20 degrees,\" I said. \"I'm never going to want to get up,\" I said. I hated getting up out of the blankets when it was cold out. \"I'll cuddle with you and keep you nice and warm,\" Eddie said gently stroking my arm. \"Thanks,\" I said learning into him slightly. \"So, we want a wedding sometime in July. A small wedding with just our closest friends and family members,\" Eddie stated. \"Correct,\" I said typing a note on the document. \"So, we need to figure out how many bridesmaids and groomsmen we want. We need to have an even amount so the bridesmaids will have an escort,\" I said. \"I was going to ask George to be my best-man. He's my best friend, and I grew up with him. He's one of the few people who knows me for who I am. I also wanted to ask your brothers to be my groomsmen. I also wanted to ask Soren. Even though he's been my bodyguard and assistant, he's also been such a good friend to me,\" Eddie said. \"I think those are good options,\" I said. \"Do you think your brothers would want to be my groomsmen?\" Eddie asked. \"I know I haven't known them for a while but-\" \"I think they would be honored,\"I said, cutting him off and smiling, trying to extinguish his nerves. He smiled in relief. \"And who do you want to ask?\" \"I was going to ask Beth to be my maid of honor. I've known her since high school, and you know that we were roommates too in college. I was also wanting to ask Amanda and Stacy from college. I wanted to ask Arabella,\" I said. \"And if one my friends couldn't come in, I'd ask my cousin Michelle.\" \"You have a back-up bridesmaid,\" Eddie said chuckling. \"I do and if I end up needing to use her, don't you dare tell her that she was my back-up!\" I said. \"I won't\" Eddie said chuckling. \"So, I was thinking we could use your new bodyguard to actually order the cake and the food for us. No one would ever suspect a thing. We'll have to give the media a fake date so we can go cake shopping together, do wedding planning, and so that you can buy a dress. But we should be able to use them as the decoys to actually order what we want for our wedding,\" Eddie explained. \"Won't people start to notice that they are starting to hang around me all the time? And then they suddenly go and order a wedding cake?\" I asked. Eddie sighed. \"We'll see how it goes, and if she is really around you a lot. If she is, then we'll need to find someone else.\" \"Why does this have to be so complicated?\" I asked, running my fingers through my hair. \"I'd say let's elope, but I know my parents really want to be at our wedding.\" \"And I want to give you the fairy-tale wedding of your dreams,\" Eddie told me. I leaned forward and kissed him before we continued on with our wedding planning.[Chapter 4] I waited anxiously for Eddie to pick me up from school so we could go to the church to talk to a priest. Desiree had met me at school after Eddie had dropped me off. I reluctantly agreed to give her a copy of my class schedule. She promised she wouldn't follow me into the classrooms, but she usually hung out in the same building and we had a designated meeting spot after class. No one seemed to notice her since she dressed in regular cloths and didn't wear dark sunglasses. She even carried around a backpack around with her laptop inside to complete work while I was at in class. She didn't say much but at least she didn't try to make painful small talk. She gave me my space, and I'd open up to her in due time. I wasn't sure what she thought of me, but she never questioned me. \"Eddie's coming to pick me up,\" I explained to her as we were walking down the sidewalk after my afternoon classes. \"Would you like me to accompany you two in the car back to the palace?\" She asked me. \"That's okay. We'll be just fine. Why don't you go home early and spend the rest of the time with your family?\" I suggested, trying to be nice without it coming off as fake. I was exhausted. I stayed up really late the other night studying for a test. I really just wanted to go back into bed and take a nap, but the wedding business needed to get taken care of. \"I'll wait till his Royal Highness comes to get you and then I will head to my car and leave as long as you are sure it is okay,\" Desiree replied. It felt somewhat scripted, as though it was robotic. \"It's fine. I promise,\" I reassured her. \"My daughters and husband will like my new boss,\" she said finally cracking a small smile. \"Go home and enjoy them. Eddie and I will be fine,\" I said smiling back at her. \"As you wish, your majesty,\" she replied. I turned and looked at her in complete shock. Did she just call me \"your majesty?\" I felt my jaw open slightly from shock. \"Why do you look so surprised?\" Desiree asked me. \"You will be the Queen of Denmark soon,\" she said nonchalantly. \"I don't think of it that way. I think of it as Eddie will be my husband, and I will be his wife,\" I replied, looking down at the ground slightly due to my slight embarrassment. \"I believe your finance is here,\" Desiree replied, motioning over Eddie's car rounding the corner. \"Yes, that's him,\" I said smiling. \"As soon as you as safely in his car, my job here is complete,\" she said. Eddie pulled into a parking spot, and I turned and said good-bye to Desiree. She nodded back at me, and I got into Eddie's car in the passenger's side. I closed the door and turned to him. \"Hi,\" I said giving him a big smile. \"Hello beautiful,\" he said leaning in to give me a strong kiss. \"How did things go today with Desiree?\" He asked me. \"Surprisingly well. She kept low key, which I appreciated. She even dressed like a college student, and she didn't follow me into my classes,\" I said. \"I'm glad that things went well, and you seem very happy today,\" Eddie commented. I giggled and squeezed his arm playfully. \"I'm just so happy that this is finally happening. We're taking the first step to getting married,\" I said smiling lovingly at him. \"I really want to kiss you right now because I feel the same way,\" Eddie said taking my hand and kissing it gently but keeping his eyes on the road. \"I can't wait till the day you become Ms. Paige Williams,\" he said glowing. I winced slightly. \"What?\" he asked, sensing myself stiffen up. \"Would you be incredibly disappointed if I kept my last name? I was thinking of hyphenating it, but that is what I would to be called then- Dr. Morgan-Williams,\"I explained. \"But it's tradition,\" Eddie began to say and then trailed off. \"Yes, but are we always breaking tradition?\" I said trying to keep the tone friendly. \"I mean think about it. A Morgan is who I have been my entire life. It's part of my identity. I know that we are molding identities now and becoming one, but I don't know...I just feel like losing my last name is losing a part of myself, which is why I want to hyphenate it. That way, I maintain who I am while showing that I am married to you and that we are one,\" I explained. \"Don't girls want to change their last names when they are married? Isn't it part of the joy?\" Eddie asked me, still slightly uncertain about my proposal to keep my last name. He was trying broach it so we didn't end up fighting, and I was approaching it in the same manner. \"Some girls do, but I just don't view it that way. It goes back to women being men's property, and I obviously don't agree with that,\" I explained. \"I don't agree with that either,\" Eddie said. \"I do see where you are coming from...\" Eddie said, trailing off. \"I wouldn't want to change my last name if positions were reversed. It's who I am,\" he said. \"Exactly,\" I explained. \"I will support whatever decision you decide to make about your last name,\" he told me. \"Thank you. I'm glad to have your support,\" I said. \"I'm leaning towards hyphenating it so that it shows that I'm a Morgan, but we are also one team as a Williams family. And when we have children one day, it will show that too,\" I said. \"I don't want to pressure you into anything,\" Eddie said. \"I'll support whatever you decide. You don't have to decide anything today,\" he said taking my hand and squeezing it. \"Think about what you want,\" he told me. I nodded in agreement. As we neared the church, I gasped. It was such a beautiful church, and it bordered a beautiful lake. It was truly breathtaking. The architecture of the church was beautiful and old. The bricks were a stained red/rusty color and the steeples were high and a bluish gray color. \"Is that the church?\" I asked Eddie. \"Yes. We have to park on the street, but I took the scenic tour to show you how it was on the water. If you like the outside, wait till you see the inside,\" Eddie told me. \"I'm sold already,\" I said laughing. \"So, I have an appointment with the priest. I'll go in first and then I'll come out and get you once we get settled. I don't want other workers to see us coming in together since the tabloids will be buzzing. I made the appointment under the name Valdemar.\" \"You're middle name?\" I asked. \"Won't people put two and two together?\" I asked. \"I don't think so. I know you think it's a funny middle name, but it's more common than you think,\" he told me smiling. \"I love you middle name. It sounds like Voldermort though,\" I said laughing, referring to the Harry Potter villain. \"Very funny,\" Eddie said parking and shooting me a teasing look. \"It's a family name,\" he said. \"Too bad it isn't your mother's name. It would fit her well,\" I said laughing. \"I do have to agree with you there,\" Eddie grumbled. His mother was still a sensitive subject, and I understood why. I wouldn't speak to her either unless we absolutely had to. \"I'll be right back for you as soon as I get the priest. But here's a baseball cap for you to wear when you get out of the car. Just make sure you take it off before you get into the church,\" he said handing it to me. \"I'll text you when it's okay to come in,\" he said giving me a kiss on the lips and getting out of the car. \"Okay,\" I said pulling out my phone so I would see the text message when it came in. As I waited for Eddie, I couldn't really believe that I was about to marry Eddie in a few months. The concept was truly mind-blowing to me. I was more than ready to start our lives as husband and wife. Even though marriage scared me before, I realized that I wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of my life with Eddie. My phone buzzed, and Eddie told me to meet him in the lobby of the church. I put on the baseball cap as I got out of the car and quickly walked up the steps to the church. Then, I took off the cap as soon as I entered the church. Eddie was right, the lobby was beautiful, and I hadn't even seen the inside of the church yet. \"The priest is waiting for us in the church. Then, we'll go into a meeting room,\" he explained. \"Sounds good,\" I said squeezing his hand. We walked into the church, and I saw a priest in his late 50's sitting down in a pew with big glasses and was slightly chubby. He had dark brown hair with grey streaks throughout, which showed his age. I had to stop halfway down the aisle in the church just to take in the scenery. \"It's beautiful,\" I told Eddie. \"I knew this would be the church you'd want to get married in,\" he told me. We walked over to the priest, and Eddie began speaking to the priest in Danish. The priest looked at me and shook my hand. I smiled and shook it as well although I had no clue what was going on. I understood a little from my Danish class, and he asked me how I was. I replied that I was doing well and asked him how he was doing. He replied that he was doing well and then made a joke that I didn't understand. \"The thing about my fiancee, Father Aaron, is that she doesn't really speak Danish. She's still learning,\" Eddie said in English. I looked at Eddie not knowing what to say. Did the priest know that he was King Edvard? What did he say my name was? \"I know,\" Father Aaron said nodding and smiling. \"I knew who you were the moment you walked through the door, your Royal Highness,\" he said nodding to Eddie. \"Although what she does know, is very good,\" he said. \"She has good pronunciation, which is essential.\" \"Thank you,\" I said in English even though I could have said that in Danish. \"I gave a fake name because I didn't anyone tipping the press,\" Eddie mumbled, slightly embarrassed. \"We weren't trying to trick you, Father. I hope you know that,\" Eddie said. \"I completely understand,\" he said smiling at us. \"So, this is where you will be married. What do you think Ms. Morgan?\" he asked me. \"It's breathtaking,\" I said, looking at the art on the ceiling and around me. \"So, I assume we are going to have a huge wedding? Will we be able to accommodate everyone?\" He asked. Eddie and I looked at each other, not wanting to give an exact answer. \"We actually want to talk to you about the wedding. Is there someplace private that we could go to?\"Eddie asked him. \"Of course. Following me to the meeting room,\" he said getting up. We following him to a side room in the church that was empty. He closed the door behind us. Eddie and I took a seat next to each other. I was getting slightly nervous. This was our moment of truth. Would the priest tell all of our secrets to the press? I knew that he was a priest, but I still worried. \"So, I know you are both worried about the press, which I saw when you came in separately. Whatever you have planned for your wedding and whatever we discuss during our marriage preparation classes will be all confidential, just like when you tell your sins in confession. I won't tell a soul. Of course, if someone tells me a plan to kill the other, I have to notify the authorities,\" he said trying to make a joke. Eddie and I both laughed. \"Thank you, Father, we appreciate that,\" Eddie said. \"So, are you both just wanting information about getting married here? Or do you want to get married here?\" He asked us. \"I think Paige is pretty sold here already,\" Eddie said looking at me, and I nodded, smiling at him. \"Don't royals usually get married in the Lutheran church?\" he asked us. \"It was important to Paige and her family to get married in a Catholic Church. We'd like to have the Lutheran Bishop presiding as well if possible. It was our compromise,\" Eddie explained. \"Well, we are happy to marry you here, and that isn't as issue with me as long as you can get the Lutheran Bishop to agree as well.\" Eddie nodded. \"I'll get in touch with him.\" \"I'm sure he's been expecting that phone call,\" Father Aaron said. \"So, the Catholic preparation for marriage is 6 months. After you successfully complete that preparation class, you can get married. Have you thought about any dates yet?\" Father Aaron asked us. \"We were thinking July if that would be a possibility,\" I said. \"We could do Saturday, July 9th if you wanted,\" Fr. Aaron said, \"or Saturday, July 31st,\" he said. \"That is what we have available,\" he told us. \"What do you think?\" I asked, turning to Eddie. \"I say the 9th.\" \"Yes,I think the 9th would be the best. Here's the thing Father and the slightly issue. We don't want a huge wedding with a ton of people that we do not know. We want a small private wedding with just our closest friends and family. We were planning to give the press a fake date so that we could do our wedding planning together. We could pick out a cake, Paige can get her dress, and we can do the other necessities,\" Eddie said. \"I see,\" he said looking at his calendar. \"Well, the people who actually have their weddings on the fake day will realize that it is a fake date. And I don't think you'll be able to hide that you are getting married here. But we have a retreat going on July 24th at 3pm so we could tell the press that we are going to have the wedding at 10am? It will be over,\" he said putting \"over\" in quotation marks, and we laughed \"about noon, which will give time for the retreat leaders to come in and set up.\" \"That sounds like a good plan to me,\" Eddie said, and I nodded in agreement. \"So July 9th will be the actual wedding, and July 24th will be the date that you can tell the press. What time do you want the wedding on July 9th?\" he asked us. \"What time do you think would be best so the press doesn't see us?\" I asked Eddie. \"I think anytime could work. We just wouldn't leave the palace until it was time for the wedding,\" Eddie told me. \"Would 2pm work for you? I have a baptism earlier that day,\" he told us. \"That should be fine,\" I said, and Eddie nodded in agreement. \"Okay! So just verifying- July 9th at 2pm real wedding and July 24th at 10am is the fake wedding,\" he said writing notes down in the calendar. \"Correct,\" Eddie and I said in unison, chuckling slightly. \"Okay! It's all set,\" the priest said smiling. \"So, you both will need to become members of the church,\" he said handing us the form. \"You can just turn that into me before you leave today, and I'll put it in the system. I'd like you to become active members in the church or at least attend Mass on the weekends. We just don't want you to come and get married and leave, we want you to practice the faith and become active members in the church,\" he explained to us. I nodded to show that I understood. \"Let's start with some preliminary questions for the marriage preparation. Why do you want to get married?\" he asked us. \"Everything you say will be confidential. I ask all couples these questions who want to get married.\" \"I love him, and I can't imagine my life without him,\" I said trying to smile at Eddie and make eye contact with the priest at the same time. \"What do you love about King Edvard, Ms. Morgan?\" he asked me. \"Please, call me Edvard or Eddie. You don't need to be so formal,\" Eddie interjected. \"And please call me Paige,\" I said too. \"Okay then. And please call me Father Aaron,\" he said as we all laughed. \"Going back to the question, Paige. What do you love about Edvard?\" Father Aaron asked me. \"I love his smile and how when it's just us together and talking, I have his undivided attention, and it feels like we are the only two people in the world. I love how caring he is and how supportive he is of me. He truly just wants the best for me and for us, and I know that those qualities will transfer when he becomes a father one day. I love how he would do anything for anyone in need. And I love how I just feel complete when I am with him, and I can't imagine being with anyone else,\" I said smiling at Eddie. Eddie seemed to blush slightly. He took my hand underneath the table and squeezed it. \"And Edvard, what do you love about Paige?\" Father Aaron asked. \"Not to copy Paige, but I do love her smile. It was one of her qualities that first attracted me to her. I love how she knows literally every single song on the radio in English and can sing along to it. I love how time just stops when it is just us together. I love how determined she is to become a doctor, and I love how passionate she is about medicine and helping others. She is truly my other half, and she always supports me and wants to do what is best for us as a couple. Not her, not me, but us, even if that means making sacrifices on her part. I love how caring she is for others, and her kind but strong personality. I am the happiest and luckiest man in the world when I am around her, and I want us to be together forever, which is why I want to marry her. She made me realize what was important in life, and she changed me and made be a better person. I have no doubt that she is my other half, and she truly completes me,\"Eddie said smiling at me. I had to wipe a quick tear from my eye. \"I'm sorry,\" I said laughing. \"It's okay to get emotional. You both had very lovely things to say to each other. And I could tell that they were from the heart, which is what I look for. That is the first question I always ask coupled who want to get married to see if they truly want to get married because they love each other or if they want to get married because they think it's time to get married. You passed the first test,\" he said smiling at us. \"These are the weekly meetings that I do with all couples who are preparing for marriage. There is a retreat that I would like you both to go on. You can use fake names there if you want to try to remain anonymous. But couples really grow together during the retreat, or they maybe realize that this isn't for them and they want to wait a few more months before getting married. The retreat is April 10th-11th,\" he told us. \"Let me put that in,\" Eddie said taking out his phone and typing in his calendar. \"It's from a Friday night to a Saturday evening. It starts at 5pm Friday and it ends at 6pm Saturday. The men stay in separate cabins, and the females stay in the other cabins. You'll be given different scenarios that you'll need to work through together such as finances, situations with family members, situations with your children, and some other common scenarios,\" he told us. \"Have you both planned or discussed the future at all?\" he asked us. \"What do you mean by that?\" Eddie asked. \"Like, have you discussed children at all? Or Paige juggling being a Queen and being a doctor? If you were a regular couple, I'd also discuss the division of household chores, where you are going to live, both of your careers, etc. But I assume you won't have to worry about that,\" he said. I wondered how to respond to that question. Should I tell him the truth about our current fight with Parliament? \"Actually, between you and us, Father, there is a very high possibility that we won't be staying in Denmark,\" Eddie said calmly as I watched the priest's eyes widen and grow about three times in shock over what he just heard. \"You see, we need permission from Parliament to get married and as of now, they haven't given us permission. In fact, they have been in session for about four days debating it. I assume we aren't getting permission, which is okay with me. We'll go back to the United States and start a life there. And even if we got their permission, I'm not even sure if we would want to stay. We both feel that the press, and my expectations as King and her expectations as a future Queen put the biggest strain on our relationship,\" Eddie said. \"Why do you feel that the press and your royal expectations are the biggest hurdles in your relationship?\" he asked us. \"When we were engaged the first time, I got scared of what was expected from me and decided to leave,\" I decided to say. \"And recently, we had a few major blows to our relationship from the media. A very trusted person betrayed our trust and tried to frame Paige for something that she didn't do. She never had an affair- that was all photo shopped, and it was done and designed by a very trusted person. We ended up breaking up, and I almost lost the love of my life,\" Eddie said. I could tell that he was starting to choke up. \"And then all of the drama when she was in the hospital and all those lies. We just think it would be best to get away from it all,\" Eddie explained. \"Wow. Wow,\" he said looking at both of us with shock on his face. \"I wasn't expecting that.\" \"Yes, it's been quite a roller coaster, but I think everything is finally starting to settle down. We went down the hill and through the loops, and it seems to be over and we are finally pulling into the station,\" I said trying to make a metaphor out of our situation. \"I lot of couples come in with their problems, but I haven't heard anything like this yet,\" the priest said, completely shocked. \"Yes, I assume our relationship is unusual,\" Eddie said trying to make a joke but ended up sighing slightly. I knew he was still very frustrated over everything that had happened with is mother. \"Well, as I said before, everything here is strictly confidential. So you don't ever have to worry about discussing anything with me.\" We nodded to show that we understood. Even though everything was confidential, would we really be able to pull this off?[Chapter 5] \"So, we'll put your father and Arabella next to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge,\" I said writing it in my seating chart. \"Yes, William and I grew up together. We spent a lot of summers together,\" Eddie said. \"Arabella will love being next to George and Charlotte,\" Eddie said. \"And your mother?\" I asked. \"She's not invited,\" Eddie said firmly. \"She would probably leak the date to the press and everything. I just want our day to be perfect,\" he said. \"Won't William and Kate coming be a tip off to the press?\" I asked. \"They might,\" Eddie said sighing and crossing off their names. \"I haven't seen him in a while. They might cause more trouble for us,\" he said. \"I mean, I don't want to tell you that you can't invite someone,\" I said. \"We haven't been in touch. I guess the truth is I don't have people I am very close to since I lived such a sheltered life,\" Eddie said. We continued to work on the seating chart for the rest of the evening. Then, the hard part came- how to order a cake and the food for our actual wedding date without everything being leaked to the press. \"Could we ask for the cake and food to be delivered early?\" Eddie asked. \"The press would catch onto that in a heart-beat,\" I said. \"No one does that because the food would go bad. Do you trust the kitchen staff to prepare the food?\" I asked. \"I would fear too much that someone would leak it to the press. I don't know how honest everyone is there...\" Eddie said trailing off. We sat in silence for a moment, and then I thought of an idea. \"What if we get someone we trust to pretend that they are ordering the food and cake for their wedding? We can already have it picked out and then pay them back...\" I suggested. Eddie's ears perked up. \"Like who?\" \"Would you trust George and his girlfriend?\" I suggested. \"I would fear that the press would suspect something since he is a member of Parliament,\" Eddie replied. \"Especially since his wedding would be right at the same time ours is...\" \"What about Sara and Jake?\" I suggested. \"Would you trust them?\" Eddie asked me. \"They kept everything about us a secret during the time that I was staying with them, so I do trust them,\" I said. \"Do you really think they wouldn't leak something to the press?\" Eddie asked. \"Well, they didn't leak my pregnancy or miscarriage to the press. So, I do trust them. Also, Sara knew about the engagement before we announced it when she saw my ring, and she still didn't say anything. I'd be shocked if she would leak something to the press now,\" I said. Eddie thought about it for a minute. \"Would she be willing to do something like that?\" Eddie asked. \"I'll see her later tonight. It's the season finale of the Bachelor,\" I said smiling at him, and Eddie rolled his eyes. \"I only put up with that show to spend time with you,\" he said smiling at me. \"Well, maybe you can come with me tonight, and we can talk to her together. I'm not sure if Jake is going to be there. But if Sarah wants to help, then she'll drag Jake into the picture. \"I guess that could work,\" Eddie said. \"I'm trusting your judgement on this,\" he told me. \"I would be shocked and betrayed if they let us down,\" I said. \"Have you started dress shopping yet?\" he asked me. \"Maybe,\" I said winking. \"Oh really?\" He asked, raising an eyebrow. \"I peaked at a few dresses the other day with Desiree, but I didn't try anything on yet. My mom is going to come to Denmark in a few weeks, and we are going to go dress shopping together. She needs to ask her boss for some time off. It's hard being so far away from my mother during this time with all the wedding preparation,\" I said. \"You'll most likely very close to her after we get married. Probably in the same house after a while,\" Eddie mumbled. \"And then you'll be far away from you family,\" I replied. \"I can't get far enough away from my mother,\" he mumbled again. \"Are you nervous about leaving Denmark if Congress doesn't approve our marriage?\" I asked. \"Yes and no. I'm excited about us starting our lives together. But at the same time, I'm nervous about leaving the only life that I know behind...\" Eddie said. \"It'll be okay; we'll get through it,\" I said taking his hand trying to be comforting. \"It'll be hard at first, but we'll adjust...you'll adjust.\" \"Yes, you're used to living like a poor college student,\" Eddie said smiling as I laughed. \"When will we find out Parliament's decision?\" I asked. \"Today, actually. I have a meeting with them in an hour. I didn't want to tell you because I know you have class in a little bit, and I didn't want to distract you...\" \"I think you'll be more distracted about it than I will be,\" I replied. \"You're not worried about the outlook?\" he asked me. \"Honestly no. What matters to me is being with you. So as long as that happens, I'll be happy. Parliament can't stop us from being together anywhere in the world,\" I replied. \"Are you really nervous about the decision?\" I asked. \"I honestly am... You have to understand that going to the US will be a huge adjustment for me. But it's something that I am willing to do to be with you,\" he told me. I leaned in to give him a kiss on the lips. \"Whatever happens, we will be okay,\" I said reassuringly. He leaned in and kissed me passionately. \"I love you, Paige Morgan, and I don't want you to think that me worrying is going to change anything,\" he told me, looking into my eyes. He leaned forward and kissed me again gently on the lips. \"I have to go to class,\" I said with our noses touching. \"Why don't you e-mail your professor and say you're sick and stay here,\" he said kissing my gently again. \"That is so tempting,\" I said putting my arms around him. \"I feel like I never get to spend as much time with you as I used to. Stay,\" he said in between kisses. \"I have Danish oral test today after the lecture and an organic chemistry test,\" I said smiling and wanting to stay. \"That's okay. We are going to be in the US. You don't need to know Danish anymore. You can speak Danish very well,\" he said planting gentle kisses along my jawline. \"I really have to go,\" I said snuggling into his chest and not wanting to go either. \"Let me at least drive you other there,\" he said kissing me on the cheek before getting up from the couch. Eddie and I walked hand in hand to the car outside. Eddie loved cars, and I learned that he always had from his childhood. I knew that he liked to race cars before I came to Denmark. I had asked him to stop and he did, but that still didn't stop him from trying to fix up cars to make them faster or noisier. \"Do you hear that noise?\" he asked me when he started up the car. \"Yes,\" I said thinking it was awful. It was way too noisy. \"I put it in yesterday while you were studying at the library. I love it,\" he said proud of his accomplishment. \"I'll be able to hear you a mile away now,\" I said teasingly. \"Do you like it?\" he asked. \"It's...um...different that what I'm used to,\" I replied. \"But if you like it, that's the important thing.\" I replied. \"So I take it you won't want this done to our cars in the US?\" He asked jokingly. \"No,\" I said smiling. \"BUT Johnny and Mikey would probably want it done to their cars. I think it's more of a guy thing,\" I said. \"Maybe we'll have a bunch of little boys running around in our little ranch house in Wisconsin,\" Eddie said smiling at me. \"What makes you think we'll have all boys? We could have all girls,\" I said smiling. \"How many kids do you want?\" he asked me. \"I'm not sure,\" I responded. \"Probably just one or two. Maybe three. How many do you want?\" I asked looking over at him. \"I was thinking like four or five,\" he replied. \"Four or five!?\" I exclaimed. \"Too many?\" he asked. \"You better hope that men can start giving birth because that's the only way we are having four or five kids,\" I replied. \"I've always wanted to have a big family,\" he said. \"Well, we can always re-evaluate after having one or two kids,\" I said. \"You've never watched or worked with children before. They are A LOT of work,\" I said. \"Well, we don't have to make any decisions tonight,\" he said. \"Exactly,\" I said. \"Besides,...\" I began and then stopped. \"What?\" Eddie asked, looking over at me. \"When I went for my final check-up after...everything that happened,\" I began referring to the miscarriage. \"The doctor told me that it'll be hard for me to carry a pregnancy to term with my medical history,\" I began. \"So you may not be able to have children?\" he asked me. \"I don't know,\" I said. \"I think it's possible, but it may be harder than the average person. I'm going to talk to my regular doctor back in the US next time we are there to get her opinion. It's always good to get a second opinion,\" I explained. \"I'm sorry,\" I said trying not to cry. It was hard to tell him that I may not be able to have children, especially after him telling me that he wanted a large family. \"It's okay,\" he said squeezing my hand. \"If we want children, we can always adopt. Then, you don't have an excuse. We can have ten children!\" He exclaimed laughing. I couldn't help but laugh along with him. At that moment, I knew that no matter what happened in life, we would always have each other and support each other. In class, people around me were glancing at me and whispering. Initially, I looked at my outfit. Was it something I wore? Did I have food on my face? \"What will she do now?\" I heard someone say. What will I do know about what? I wondered. What lies was the press printing now? As I was working on my to-do list for the day, my phone buzzed. I took it out of my pocket, and saw a text from Sarah. OMG! How come you didn't tell me about the drama with Parliament!? They DENIED King Edvard permission to marry you. \"What!?\" I said out loud to myself, looking at my phone. I looked up and made eye contact with the girls who were talking about me previously. They stopped talking, and I didn't know what to say or what to do. I got up really fast and ran up the steps of the lecture hall with my phone in my hand. I knew that Parliament could possibly deny us permission to get married, but I didn't honestly believe that they would go through with it. Eddie was pretty confident that they wouldn't though...I knew that Eddie said that he would give up the throne for me, but I honestly wondered if he would go through with it. Was he really prepared to give up EVERYTHING to live practically in poverty with me in the US? We would literally have nothing, and my savings would barely last two months. I clicked on Eddie's name on my phone. My heart was racing. I was in shock, and I was also upset. Did Eddie honestly mean what he said? If he didn't, it would be the end of us. \"Come on, pick up,\" I said to myself after the 5th ring. I got his voicemail, and I hung up in frustration. He was probably still in Parliament trying to negotiate or maybe they even moved onto the next item on the agenda...If Eddie was going to abdicate the throne, shouldn't we just leave together soon? I looked at my phone and realized that it was time to get into class. I could feel eyes on me and whispering as I entered the classroom again. In Denmark, Eddie and I were like celebrities. This was huge news to the Danes; kind of like Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie divorcing in the United States. I walked to my seat with my head held high and pretended like nothing happened. I pulled out my phone and answered Sara. They told Eddie that they were going to think about approving out marriage. Apparently, they have reservations about me. Today, we got our answer. I hit send and about two second later, Sarah responded to my message. So what are you doing to do? Is this the end of Padvard? Padvard? I looked at that confused. Padvard? I responded. Paige and King Edvard! It's the celeb name that I gave you guys! Haha very funny. I replied. Seriously!? What are you guys going to do!? She responded. We aren't going to split. We'll figure something out. I replied. Class is about to start. I'll explain everything tonight when we watch The Bachelor. I hate our government is even more than I did before...grrrrr... she responded. \"Good morning class,\" my Danish teacher said in Danish, coming into the class. \"Did you hear about the current state of the Danish monarchy?\" An exchange student asked from Germany. I believe he was a history major from the conversations he would have in class and when we did small group work. \"Yes, I have but this is Danish language class,\" the teacher replied in English. \"Wouldn't this be the best class to discuss thoughts and reactions to the breaking news story?\" he pressed. \"None of us are Danish here. It would be interesting to see the viewpoint of an actual Dane,\" he said. I had to refrain from rolling my eyes. \"Parliament denied King Edvard's marriage to Paige Morgan. I don't see the big deal,\" an American girl pipped in. \"Can't they still get married?\" she asked. \"No, they can't,\" the German history major replied. \"That's why this is such a big deal. King Edvard has to choose a different woman to be his wife. It will most likely be a woman of royal descent.\" \"That's dumb,\" the American girl replied. \"If they love each other, why can't they be together?\" \"What do you think, Professor?\" another student asked. \"Well, this has come to a shock to many Danish people, including me,\" she replied. \"I guess King Edvard is available now ladies,\" a girl joked. I had to refrain from turning around to glare at her. \"I feel sorry for Paige Morgan. I wonder what she's thinking now. She must be devastated,\" a girl from the far back on the side said. \"I'm right here. You can just ask me yourself,\" I said raising my hand slightly. There were a few gasps from the class and some whispering. \"I heard you went to this school, but I can't believe I had a class with you almost this entire semester,\" the girl who made the comment replied. Her accent made her sound French. The lecture was 80 exchange students. I sat in the middle and roll wasn't taken but an attendance sheet was passed around. I guessed I was able to hide in this class better than I had originally thought. I assumed now only the students around me knew who I was. \"What are you thoughts on this Miss Paige?\" the German history major asked me. \"I don't think it's fair that Parliament can make this kind of decision,\" I replied. \"But it's the tradition of Danish Parliament to approve a member of the royal family's marriage.\" He told me. \"I mean, it's been a tradition for centuries.\" \"I still do believe it's unfair even if it's been the Danish tradition. You can't dictate any person who to marry, even if they come from royal descent,\" I said. \"Can we ask what you are going to do?\" the French girl asked. \"Are you upset?\" \"I'm upset, but we knew that this was probably going to happen,\" I replied. \"I guess you could say that I was prepared-\" \"You knew this was going to happen?\" The German student asked me, cutting me off. \"Yes...Parliament took some time to discuss granting us permission to marry. We knew this was a possibility,\" I replied. \"So what are you doing to do?\" Another girl asked again. \"I don't know,\" I said not wanting to share my entire plan with the class and honestly not knowing if Eddie would truly abdicate the throne for me. The entire class grew silent. \"I truly hope that you and King Edvard can spend the rest of your lives together,\" the American girl told me. I turned around and smiled at her. \"Thank you,\" I replied. \"We all do,\" another girl from the back said. \"Thanks. We hope so too,\" I said. \"And do the the Danish people,\" my teacher said. Her words surprised me. She was always strict and hard on us but with those words, I knew that we had made a connection. Maybe she wasn't so bad after all. \"Thank you. I appreciate that,\" I said. \"Before we waste any more class time, please turn in your books to page 109 and repeat after me...\" my teacher told us. I opened up my textbook and repeated the words as instructed with the rest of the class. I couldn't concentrate. I wanted to talk to Eddie, and I wanted to know what was going on in his head. Also, I wanted to know what happened in Parliament today. Were we going to have our happily ever after?[Chapter 6] As I was leaving class and entered outside, I was bombarded by about 50 reporters, cameras flashing, and reporters yelling questions at me. \"Paige Morgan, did hear about Parliament's decision?\" someone yelled at me. \"Are you still planning on marrying King Edvard?\" someone else yelled at me. Desiree came to my rescue and helped pull me through the crowd. \"Paige Morgan!\" I heard the reporters yell after me. I kept my head low as Desiree guided me through the slew of reporters. We began to walk away, but the reporters continued to follow us. \"Why are they following us? They are allowed to do that!\" I whispered. \"When you are associated with the royal family, rules don't apply to you,\" she responded calmly. We continued to walk across campus, and I could hear the reporters yelling at me and see the lights from the camera. As we continued our search for peace and a place away from the reporters, I wondered how Eddie would be able to come and get me. The reporters were everywhere. I remembered having a similar situation when I first came to Denmark, and I was at the university bookstore. Sarah had grabbed me, and we ran and hid in a classroom until they left. Although, I figured that they would find me in there. They were so determined. I needed a place to go...a place where they couldn't find me. I would have to text Sarah or Clara and see if I could hide in their apartment. \"I have an idea,\" I whispered to Desiree. \"I'm going to make a run for it. I'll be in that building over there in an empty classroom. I'll text you where I am,\" I explained. \"Don't do that. I am not allowed to leave you, especially at a time like this,\" she told me. \"Do you have any other ideas?\" I asked her. \"No,\" she said sighing. \"Okay,\" I said making a run for it for the building. I crossed the side street and continued to run. I could hear the reporters following me and some where also running after me. This was insane. Why couldn't I have a normal life? I opened the door and stopped running and changed it to a brisk walk. I walked down the hallway and saw an empty classroom. I pulled on the knob. It was locked. I continued to walk down the hallway and pulled on empty classrooms, but I had no luck. I went upstairs and went down another hallway. I saw a classroom door that was open and empty. \"Thank goodness,\" I said to myself. I locked the door from the inside, sat in a desk in a corner where no one could see me if they looked through the window. I heaved a sigh of relief and texted Desiree my location. I pulled out a textbook and began doing some homework when I heard people talking down the hallway. \"There were speaking in Danish, but I heard my name said. I knew they were reporters. I saw them walk by the classroom I was in, stop, and look through. I could see the cameras around their necks. The heard the knob try to turn but thankfully it was locked. I heard them walk away. I heaved a sigh of relief. After a few minutes, I texted Desiree to tell her where I was and that when I felt like the coast was clear, I'd go over to Sara and Clara's apartment. I'm not comfortable with you walking around by yourself , Desiree responded to me. I'll be fine. They maybe won't suspect me to go over there. Are they still on campus? I replied back. Yes. Some went inside the building while others are waiting for you outside. I'll exit the back entrance way . I responded. I got up from my seat, slowly walked to the door, and peaked through the window. The coast was all clear. I slowly opened the door, poked my head outside the door and looked both ways down the hallway. As I was approaching the back staircase, I heard someone yell something in Danish. I turned around quickly and saw two reporters beginning to run after me. The lights of their cameras were blinding me. I opened the door to the staircase and quickly ran down the stairs. \"Paige Morgan! What are you going to do? Are you still going to marry King Edvard?\" I heard them yelling at me with the their flashing lights trying to get a glimpse of my face. I left the staircase and walked out the backdoor, hearing the reporters follow me. As soon as I was outside, I ran as fast as I did when I was on the track team in high school. I didn't even think that I could that fast with my backpack and my boots, but the adrenaline kicked in, causing me to run like lightening. I turned around once and saw the photographers trying to keep up with me, but they were failing. I turned a corner and ran out of their sight. I leaned up against the wall and tried to catch my breath. Why wouldn't I even leave class without reporters following me? They weren't allowed to follow me onto campus. \"Hey,\" I heard a male voice say. The voice scared me, causing my adrenaline to kick in again. I jumped back and lifted up my head. It was another reporter. In fact, the reporter that I swore at when I was leaving the hospital a few months ago. \"So we meet again,\" he said with his lips curling to a twisted smile. \"I have to go,\" I said quickly. But but when I turned to the other direction, there were about four other reporters coming my way. I was trapped. \"SOS,\" I texted to Desiree, hoping that she could track my location from my phone. I backed up as far as I could, but I was trapped in between two buildings, and the brick of the one building was pushing against my body. I had no where to go. I sighed heavily and looked at the reporters with their camera lights flashing in my face. \"What do you want?\" I asked, defeated. \"I want to know if you are still going to marry King Edvard,\" a reporter asked. \"What are you going to do now that Parliament has denied King Edvard permission to marry you?\" another reporter asked me. \"Please let me go,\" I pleaded. \"Not until you answer a question,\" the reporter from the hospital responded, confident that he would get a reply out of me. \"Fine,\" I sighed, defeated. \"Put your cameras down and then I'll answer ONE question. And then you'll let me go,\" I said crossing my arms. \"I have the perfect question,\" the reporter from the hospital said smirking at me. \"Why were you hospitalized a few months ago?\" he asked me. \"None of your business,\" I said crossing my arms. \"Oh really?\" He said raising an eyebrow. \"I already know why and if it came out, it would be the biggest royal scandal. I have no problem airing your dirty laundry.\" \"That's private medical information. You can't air it without being given the right to do so,\" I said crossing my arms. \"You get into serious legal trouble.\" If he was going to play hard ball, I could play it as well. \"Watch me,\" he said with an evil smirk on his face.[Chapter 7] \"You took the paparazzi on a wild goose chase,\" Rosalind scolded, throwing a magazine and a newspaper down in my face, which both featured me running away from the paparazzi and when I was cornered in between the two buildings. Desiree had come and removed me from the situation and took me back to the palace. \"I'm sorry,\" I stammered, confused as to why this was a big deal. \"I saw the paparazzi, panicked and ran away from them. \"You don't understand it, Paige. Your actions are a reflection of Edvard. If you take the paparazzi on a wild goose chase across campus, it's a poor reflection on yourself, on Edvard and the entire royal family. This isn't your first indiscretion with the paparazzi. You swore at that one man after leaving the hospital, correct?\" she said, lowering her eyes and squinting at me. \"I didn't mean to make Edvard or you all look bad. I just wanted to get away from them!\" I exclaimed. \"You're giving her way too hard a time,\" Harold said, putting the newspaper in the trash. \"She has to learn how to stop acting like a...\" she started to say and then stopped herself. \"Like a what?\" I challenged. Rosalind avoided my eyes. For once in her life, she seemed ashamed of her words. \"Like a normal person. Like a commoner,\" I said, raising my voice and finishing her sentence. \"I didn't mean that, Paige,\" she said, gently. \"Yes, you did. It's no secret that you don't like me. I'm very well aware of it,\" I said trying to remain calm. Rosalind seemed taken a back by my words. \"Edvard was meant to marry someone of royal descent. It was how it has always been done-\" \"But you weren't royal!\" I exclaimed. \"You married into the royal family. How come that was allowed?\" I said raising my voice at her. \"Because I was the Prime Minister's daughter. It was a suitable match!\" She said. \"But you weren't royal. I thought it was tradition and how it's always been done,\" I pointed out calmly. For once, Rosalind didn't have a response. \"Paige, I think Rosalind is trying to express that Edvard was arranged to marry Princess Kirsten since the time he was a child. It was the way things were done. A child in line for the throne was supposed to have an arranged marriage from the time they were born. I would have never forced things between Kirsten and Edvard. We love you Paige, and we are glad that Edvard has found such a lovely woman to marry and call his wife. I wouldn't have it any other way,\" Harold told me, trying to smooth the tension in the room. \"She's lucky to be marrying him,\" Rosalind mumbled under her breath. \"And Edvard is lucky to be marrying Paige,\" Harold said. \"Paige,\" Rosalind began, \"I know that I hurt both you and Edvard very deeply. However, I see how wrong I was and I wish I could take it all back. I never meant for Kirsten to go so far. I just wanted to uphold tradition...\" she said trailing off. \"It was wrong of me and for that, I am very sorry,\" she said sincerely. I was taken back by her remorse, and I didn't know what to say to her in reply. \"It'll be hard to trust you, but it maybe with time...\" I said quietly, trailing off. \"I know,\" she simply replied. Christian knocked at the door, interrupting our thoughts and our conversation. \"Excuse me, your majesties, The Late Night Show with Noel has requested that Miss Paige Morgan join them this Saturday night,\" Christian told us. \"I wasn't sure what she wanted to do. Their scheduled guest had to cancel.\" I looked at Harold for some type of guidance. \"It's your decision, Paige,\" he told me. My stomach churned. I hated going on talk shows with a passion. \"Would Eddie be with me?\" I asked Christian. \"They want to interview just you. I believe they want King Edvard to play a newly engaged game with you,\" Christian explained. I began to panic. I would be alone and on national TV? \"I don't know...\" I began to say. \"If I were you, I would go on the show. Go on there and charm the Danish people. It may help persuade Parliament to change their mind if the people love you. Also, remember the threat from that one reporter from the hospital. He somehow knows what happens, and it's up to you whether he reveals it to the world or whether you do,\" Rosalind said. I sighed heavily. I really didn't want to go on the TV show. \"So I have to go on national TV and tell everyone what happened...?\" I said trailing. I didn't want to mention my miscarriage with Christian right there. \"Thank you, Christian. You can let them know that Paige accepts their invitation,\" Rosalind said, dismissing him. Christian nodded his head and left the room, closing the door behind him. \"I don't want to tell everyone what happened. I don't want to talk about my miscarriage,\" I said, beginning to panic. \"You can't tell the public about that! Don't you realize what a scandal that would be! A baby born out of wedlock in the royal family!? We can't ever discuss it,\" Rosalind said strongly and clearly. I was taken aback by her words. \"I'm sorry that your grandchild was such a scandal,\" I said quietly. \"It's not like that...I'm not getting into this right now,\" she said frustrated. \"We have to come up with a reliable story that the public will believe, and you have to deliver it in a believable way,\" she told me. \"What do you suggest we say or do?\" Harold asked. \"We originally told the press that it was for food poising,\" I said. \"Yes, but I don't think that the press believed us, which is why there were so many rumors circulating about your hospital stay,\" Rosalind said. \"That was about in October. It's almost February now. Why does the press still care?\" I asked. \"The press will always care about everything that you do. You have to get used to it and not let it get to you,\" Harold told me. \"Your life and the lives of your family will always be the most interesting parts of the tabloids for many people. Your life and your screw-ups will sell newspapers. That's all the press cares about.\" I sighed heavily, running my fingers through my hair. Was being royal always going to be so complicated? I sighed heavily backstage, trying to breathe through my stomach and trying not to worry about being live in about an hour. I was sitting a chair getting my hair done, trying not to show how nervous I was about going on the show. I wasn't saying anything and neither was the hairdresser. He was an older man in his early 60's. He worked very carefully and seemed to be very gentle. Part of me wondered if it was because I would be part of the royal family one day. Desiree would sometimes refer to me as \"Her Royal Highness.\" Whenever she did that, I would always tell her to just call me Paige. The title made me cringe slightly since it wasn't who I was- I'm not royal and I will never be royal. It doesn't matter if Eddie and I stay in Denmark or not. \"Are those your children?\" I asked him, motioning to a picture off to the side. He simply nodded and smiled at me, continuing his work. \"They are very beautiful,\" I said, trying to continue the conversation. Once again, he simply smiled and nodded at me. I didn't understand why he wasn't responding even though I was speaking to him. Was he not allowed to speak to me or any of the guests? \"I no English,\" he finally said. \"Ohhhh,\" I said to show that I understood. \"Er disse dine børn?\" I asked. (Are those your children?) \"Ja,\" he said. (Yes). He continued to speak in Danish with me. \"Mit dansk er ikke godt,\" I replied. (My Danish is not good). He laughed. \"Then we no can speak,\" he said, still laughing. \"We both need practice.\" \"Yes, we do,\" I replied, smiling. \"One day, you speak Danish, and I speak English,\" he said with his very broken English. \"Yes, one day we will be able to speak them and have a conversation!\" I said smiling. \"Yes,\" he said, but I'm not sure if he understood me. I took a deep breath and tried to remember everything that Desiree and Harold had coached me on- what to say and what not to say. We were given a list of questions that would be asked so I could have my answers rehearsed and memorized. However, my answers couldn't sound rehearsed or memorized. I had my legs crossed, and I began to shake my leg out of nervousness. \"15 minutes!\" I heard a crew member say. \"Is she back here?\" I heard Eddie's voice say. I turned around and saw Eddie. \"Hey,\" I said turning around. \"No turn,\" the hairdresser said. \"Sorry,\" I said facing the mirror again. \"You're on in about ten minutes,\" Eddie told me. \"I know,\" I said trying to appear calm. \"Just take a few deep breaths and remember...umm...everything and you'll do fine,\" he told me reassuringly. \"I'll be out there with you later during the session.\" I nodded to show that I understood. Eddie was acting strange and looked down at the ground at lot. Was he nervous that I was going to mess this up? \"Is she ready?\" A worker came back and asked in Danish. \"Now,\" he replied in English. He put down the heat styling tools and gave me some lipstick to put on. \"Now and then you ready,\" he told me. I put on the lipstick as I was told and then I got up out of the chair. \"You look beautiful. Go out there and charm Denmark,\" Eddie told me smiling. \"I'd kiss you, but I think it would mess up your lipstick.\" \"Yes, and then you don't want to go out with lipstick on,\" I said smiling. \"Miss, we are ready,\" a worker said, gently guiding me to the entrance of the stage. My heart was racing a thousand miles a minute. I could hear it in my ears, and it was pounding. Like Eddie instructed, I took a few deep breaths. \"Tonight, we have a surprise and a very special guest. We are lucky that she was able to come on such short notice. She stole the King of Denmark's heart and now she is going to take the time to talk to us. Ladies and gentlemen, please give a warm round of applause for Paige Morgan!\" The host said to the audience. The audience began cheering and clapping, and I knew that was my cue to walk out on the stage. I put on a smile and began to walk gracefully across the stage as I had practiced with Desiree and Harold. I turned to the audience and waved at them, which caused them to cheer even louder. I was wearing a long black skits that was slenderizing and complemented my figure along with a white button down blouse. It was \"chic\" but classy, according to the stylist. \"Hi, it's nice to meet you,\" I said shaking the host's hand, Noel, and sitting down in the seat. I immediately crossed my legs out of habit, but I could remember Desiree correcting me. Apparently, royals do not cross their legs. I can cross them at the ankles. \"Thanks for coming on such short notice,\" Noel told me, gathering some of his note cards. \"Thanks for inviting me,\" I replied, nervously putting a strange of hair behind my ear. \"So, Paige, you are living a real fairy-tale. You are engaged to the King of Denmark. How does that feel?\" Noel asked me, leaning forward slightly in his seat. I panicked slightly. This wasn't a question that Desiree and I had gone over and practiced. \"I don't look at him that way,\" I began. \"To me, he's just Edvard, my fiance,\" I explained, hoping that those words wouldn't come back and bite me. \"So he's really just like dating a normal person? Paparazzi always used to follow you around?\" He asked, making a joke. \"No, that part is new,\" I said going along with his joke, which made him laugh. \"That has to be weird,\" he commented. \"It's definitely taking some getting used to,\" I replied. \"The paparazzi has been hard to adjust to. I'm not that interesting, I promise!\" I said making a joking, which caused Noel and the audience to laugh. \"And everyone knows who I am or they think they know everything about me from the tabloids,\" I explained. \"Yes, you have been in the tabloids quite a bit. The newest rumor is that you are leaving King Edvard to pursue a career as a circus trainer,\" he told me briefly holding up a magazine. \"Are you serious?\" I asked, slightly confused. \"No!\" He said, bursting out laughing. \"Oh,\" I said laughing along with him. \"Yeah that's totally true,\" I said going along with his joke. \"But the tabloids do print so many rumors about how you met, why you were in the hospital, who you are, etc. So hopefully you can help us get the record straight and get to know you,\" Noel said. \"Sure,\" I replied. \"Okay rumor number 1,\" he said with his note cards, straightening them up dramatically, causing the audience to laugh. \"You met King Edvard in a bar on campus,\" he asked me. \"That's technically true,\" I said smiling. \"Technically true,\" Noel said, chuckling at my response. \"Would you like to expand on that answer?\" \"I was working at a restaurant for students on campus and at night, it was just a bar. Edvard came in while I was working, and I served him some beer,\" I replied. \"But we got to know each other from our English Shakespeare class.\" \"Was he a rude customer?\" Noel asked. \"No,\" I said smiling and lying. He was drunk and asked me to take off my top, and I sprayed him with soda. \"Rumor number 2,\" Noel said clearing his voice. \"You were hospitalized for a drug overdose,\" he said. \"Definitely false,\" I said affirmatively. \"I figured it wasn't,\" Noel replied. \"Yeah that isn't true at all. Ummmm...,\" I began to say. My heart was pounding now. This was the question that I dreaded the most. \"Would you like to clear the air or should I move on to another question?\" Noel asked. \"No, it's okay. It's nothing bad,\" I said sitting up straighter in the chair. I crossed my legs again and then I fixed it by crossing only at my ankles as I was instructed to do by Desiree and Harold. \"It was just a really bad anxiety and panic attack,\" I lied. \"I woke up in the night just not being able to breathe and the room was spinning. It didn't stop, and it was decided to take me to the hospital,\" I explained. \"Are you doing better with your anxiety?\" Noel asked, sympathetic. It worked; I thought to myself. He believed me. \"Yes. I'm doing a lot better. I think I was overwhelmed by everything that had been happening, and I had midterms coming up...It was just a lot to take in,\" I explained. \"Well, I'm glad that you are doing better now. I've personally struggled with anxiety too. It isn't fun,\" Noel said sympathetically. \"No, it isn't,\" I replied looking down at the ground. Did I pull it off? Did he believe me? Did Denmark believe me? \"One other rumor that you might want to clear is that your pregnant,\" Noel said laughing. \"No, I'm not,\" I said smiling. \"You know, I have never met a woman who is pregnant multiple times a year, according to the tabloids,\" he said laughing at his joke. \"I'm glad someone finds the tabloids amusing,\" I said smiling and nervously putting a piece of hair behind my ear. \"You don't find it amusing when they say you're pregnant, going to leave King Edvard to join the circus, or that you're going a reality TV show?\" he asked, and the audience laughed at his approach and the way he worded the question. \"I haven't the reality TV show one. That's new,\" I said and the audience began to laugh. \"No one told you about that one?\" Noel asked. \"No and I try to stay as far away from the tabloids as much as possible. I personally don't find them amusing. It's frustrating. I even had a classmate congratulate me on the baby a few weeks ago, and I was like- what baby?\" This caused Noel and the audience to burst out laughing. \"Surprise! You're having a baby? No one told you yet!?\" Noel said, laughing at his own joke. \"Yeah! I didn't know! Thanks for letting me know,\" I said, going along with the joke. \"Do you ever have to explain to King Edvard about the tabloids and vise versa?\" Noel asked me. \"Yeah, sometimes,\" I said, thinking of the time the picture of me kissing Jake was photo shopped. \"I feel like the tabloids are always against us,\" I replied. \"Like what was published this afternoon?\" Noel asked me. \"What was published this afternoon?\" I grumbled, panicking slightly. I had stayed off social media, and I hadn't watched the news today. \"King Edvard having lunch with his ex-girlfriend,\" he told me. \"But the tabloids think it means they are getting back together, especially since Parliament denied your marriage. We'll discuss the issue with Parliament in a little bit.\" Eddie had lunch with his ex-girlfriend!? When did he do this? Why did he do this? He had some explaining to do... \"Of course, the tabloids think that,\" I said very calmly even though I was furious inside. \"I'm having an affair, he's having an affair. According to them, it's a miracle we are still together,\" I said slightly angry but keeping my composure. \"Alright folk, we'll right back after this short commercial break. This time, King Edvard will join us, and we'll play the Couple Game,\" he told the camera. The \"on-air\" light went off, and I heaved a sigh of relief. I had survived the interview alone. I really wanted to see the tabloid article about Eddie having lunch with his ex-girlfriend, but I didn't want to ask to see it. If I did, then that would be in the tabloids by tomorrow and how I didn't trust Eddie. Did he really eat lunch with her? Was it just them? Did he reach to her or did she reach to him? Could he possible even be cheating on me?[Chapter 8] The crowd began cheering as the \"on-air\" sign went back on. I put on my happy face and looked toward the audience, clapping as well. \"Welcome back!\" Noel yelled cheerfully. \"Now, before we bring King Edvard on stage, we have a game for us to play.\" \"A game?\" I asked, slightly confused. This wasn't discussed previously. \"So, we follow Princess Arabella's social media posts- Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, and we have seen some recent posts about family game night?\" \"Yes,\" I said laughing. \"We play games together as a family.\" \"She said you're pretty good at XBox kinect sports,\" Noel said. \"Yes, I am pretty good at the bowling,\" I said smiling. \"But are you as good as me?\" Noel said and the audience reacted since they knew what was coming next. \"I don't know,\" I said, laughing. The audience began cheering as an assistant wheeled out a TV with a game console. Panic began coursing through my veins. I had to play Xbox Kinect on national TV? AND Eddie had lunch with his ex-girlfriend today? He told me that he was busy and that WE couldn't have lunch together. I was trying to hide my anger and act like everything was fine. After playing Kinect Table Tennis and winning against Noel (not sure how much of that was completely staged since he seemed to miss some easy shots), we took another commercial break. During the commercial break, they took away the TV and brought out another chair for Eddie. I had so many questions for him. I hoped there was a reasonable answer for why he had lunch with his ex-girlfriend. Could it be possible that he was cheating on me? The on-air sign went on and the crowd went wild as Eddie walked out onto the stage. He waved to the audience and then shook Noel's hand. He also gave me a kiss on the cheek before he sat down. \"King Edvard, thank you so much for joining us today,\" Noel said. \"My pleasure. Thanks for having me,\" Eddie replied. \"So I heard that we are having a royal wedding in Denmark sometime soon,\" he said winking. \"Can you tell your good friend Noel when the date is. Just ignore all the other people here!\" He said, brushing them off, making the audience laugh. \"We have actually picked a date,\" Eddie said smiling, and the crowd went while. \"Seriously?\" Noel asked. \"The Danish people have been waiting for this forever! Do tell do tell,\" he said leaning in for us to tell him, causing the audience to laugh. Eddie looked at me, almost slightly panicked. I assumed he was mixing up our real date with the fake date. \"It's July 24th,\" I said, taking Eddie's hand. Even though I was mad at him for having lunch with his ex-girlfriend and wanted to talk to him, it was good for show to take his hand. \"So we are really having a royal wedding on July 24th?\" Noel asked. \"Yes,\" I replied. \"We are very excited,\" I said smiling. Man, I was good at this acting. I was very excited about marrying Eddie, but I was currently furious at him. \"Can you give us any of the details?\" Noel asked. \"No, it's all going to be a surprise,\" Eddie replied quickly. \"Paige, do you have a dress yet?\" Noel asked me. \"No, not yet, but I've been looking,\" I replied, which wasn't a complete lie. I had looked at a few dresses, but I hadn't actually tried any on yet. I went into one store, but I did most of my shopping online. \"What about all the drama with Parliament? Have they changed their minds?\" Noel asked. I turned to Eddie to let him answer that questions. \"Not quite, however, I am speaking with them and trying to convince them otherwise,\" he replied. \"But what will you do if Parliament still refuses to grant you permission to marry Miss Paige Morgan?\" Noel asked Eddie. \"I am positive that Parliament will give us permission in due time,\" Eddie replied. \"In the event that Parliament denies you permission to marry, would you be willing to abdicate the throne?\" Noel asked again. \"Once again, I am positive that I will not be faced with that decision,\" Eddie said diplomatically. Why wouldn't Eddie say that he would abdicate the throne to marry me? He always told me that in person. Did he not mean it? I turned and looked at Eddie, slightly confused. Little did I know that my face would become a national Danish meme by the end of the night. \"You seem very confident about it all,\" Noel said to Eddie. \"I believe that when it comes down to it, Parliament will realize that Miss Paige Morgan isn't going anywhere and our marriage will be approved,\" Eddie replied simply. I was dumbfounded. Did he expect me to stay around forever without being married to him? \"Paige, what are you thoughts on the situation?\" Noel asked me, interrupting my thoughts. \"Ummm...\" I began, obviously off-guard. \"I think that everything will work out in the end,\" I replied, not very confident in my answer. I just hope it didn't show in national television. \"Perhaps Parliament will change their mind after they see you play the newly engaged game. We will be right back folks after this short commercial break,\" Noel said, looking at the camera. When the \"on-air\" sign turned off, I turned to look at Eddie and took my hand back in my lap. I was so put-out with him, and I really didn't want to be on the TV show anymore. \"What are you doing?\" Eddie whispered to me, observing my body language. \"What are you doing?\" I whispered to him, but it came out more like a whispered snap. Eddie sighed heavily. \"Just put on your happy face...we'll discuss this later,\" he told me. Noel's assistant came and gave us whiteboards and markers and explained the newly-engaged game to us. They were going to give us questions, and we were going to write down the answer. The goal was to have our answers match. \"And we're on in five, four, three...\" The camera man said, counting down. Eddie took my hand again, and we both put smiles on our faces. \"Alright! So we have newly engaged...well...kind of newly engaged couple here,\" Noel said and the crowd laughed. \"In case you missed it, the royal couple has finally picked a date! Mark your dates everyone for July 24th! We are going to have a royal wedding!\" Noel exclaimed and the crowd went wild. \"Are we ready to start playing?\" Noel asked me. \"Yes,\" Eddie and I replied at the same time, smiling. \"Alright, first question!\" Noel said, straightening out his index cards. \"Who is the better cook?\" I wrote myself, and Eddie wrote \"Paige\" on his whiteboard. \"Alright, so we seem to be in agreement hear. King Edvard can't cook,\" Noel said and the crowd laughed. \"He's learning,\" I said smiling and putting my hand on Eddie's arm. \"And I have a great cook to teach me,\" he said leaning in and giving me a kiss on the cheek. Most of all the women in the crowd went \"awwww.\" \"Next, what is Paige's biggest fear?\" I wrote down heights on the board, and Eddie wrote down spiders. \"Uh oh- we seem to be in disagreement here!\" Noel exclaimed when we showed our whiteboards. \"Well, spiders are definitely in the top three greatest fears,\" I replied, trying to make it seem like Eddie didn't really make a mistake. \"Heights and spiders,\" I replied. \"Next question,\" Noel said dramatically clearing his throat, \"what is Eddie's biggest fear?\" Noel asked us. I wrote down snakes, and Eddie also wrote down snakes. \"We are agreement here! King Edvard is afraid of snakes!\" Noel replied. \"Snakes and spiders,\" Eddie replied. \"Uh-oh! Who is going to kill the spiders that come into the house?\" Noel asked us. I pointed to Eddie, and the crowded laughed. \"Alright, what is Paige's favorite TV show?\" Noel asked us. I wrote down Pretty Little Liars, and Eddie wrote down The Bachelor/The Bachlorette. \"Alright, we have another disagreement. Paige, what is your favorite TV show?\" Noel asked us. \"This was a hard question that even stumped me. My guilty pleasure is watching The Bachelor and The Bachlorette. But I've been roped into Pretty Little Liars too. I watch it with Arabella.\" \"Do you both have a TV show that you watch together?\" Noel asked. Eddie and I looked at each other. The truth was that we didn't have a TV show that we watched together. Neither of us had the time. We would watch some shows together on Netflix but nothing religiously. \"We're working through The Office,\" Eddie replied. It was partially true. We had watched about five episodes, but it wasn't our favorite. It was better than saying we didn't have a show that we watched together. \"Alright, moving onto the next question, what is Eddie's favorite color?\" Noel asked us. Oh crap...I thought to myself. Was it blue? Or green? In a panic, I scribbled blue onto the whiteboard. I looked over at Eddie's whiteboard. He wrote down green. Oh crap...I thought to myself. Why couldn't we get any of these questions right? Noel chuckled slightly as he shuffled his cards, and the audience laughed quietly as well. We weren't doing well on this game...at all. \"Moving on!\" Noel exclaimed and the audience chuckled again. \"What is Paige's favorite color?\" Noel asked. I scribbled red on my whiteboard and then we both showed it to the audience. The audience began chuckling and I looked over to see that Eddie had written blue on his whiteboard. He didn't know what my favorite color was? But then again, I didn't know his favorite color. Noel couldn't help but chuckle again. \"It's a good thing you both discovered your favorite colors before you told the wedding coordinator to get the wrong colors!\" Noel said laughing and the audience also laughed. I tensed slightly, and I know that Eddie did as well. This was not going well. \"Alright, last question. If King Edvard was stranded on a desert island, what would be the one material object that he could not survive without?\" Noel asked. Seriously? I had no idea!? His phone? That wouldn't make sense, the battery would eventually die. A notebook and a pen? He always loved to write. Time was ticking, and I decided to write a pen and a notebook. I looked over at Eddie's answer and saw that once again, we did not match. He wrote down the Fairy tales and Stories of Hans Christian Anderson. Seriously!? That is what he would take with him on a deserted island? \"I do like to write though. I see Paige's thought process,\" Eddie said, defending my answer when Noel began chuckling again, which caused the audience to chuckle. \"And it was a hard question,\" Noel admitted. \"Very hard. I had to eliminate anything that would have a battery since it would eventually die,\" I commented. \"I guess I should have phrased it so you would be on a deserted island with electricity and power plugs,\" Noel said, laughing at his own joke, and the audience joined him. \"Well, I think that would have been easy then. I would have taken my laptop, and Paige would have taken her tablet,\" Eddie said. \"Yes, definitely,\" I replied, taking Eddie's hand again. \"And then we could Skype someone or message people to come and get us off of the island!\" I exclaimed, which caused the audience to laugh at my joke. \"Unfortunately, we are out of time. Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for King Edvard and Paige Morgan! Mark your calendars for July 24th when we are going to have a DANISH ROYAL WEDDING!\" Noel exclaimed, emphasizing the last part and the crowd went wild. The audience was applauding us, the cameras were zooming out, and Noel shook our hands and thanked us for coming onto his show. The \"on-air\" sign went off, and I breathed a heavy sigh of relief. We had survived the interview...barely. We both knew that the tabloids would have field day with us barely knowing how to answer those questions. The truth was- those were hard questions! Also, there was more than one possible answer for them. Eddie and I thanked Noel and then walked back stage together, hand-in-hand. Once we were back stage, I let go of Eddie's hand, and he knew that I was mad at him. I still couldn't believe that he had lunch with his ex-girlfriend after he told me that he couldn't have lunch with me today because he was too busy. Also, we just made a fool out of ourselves on national television. Part of me just wanted to leave Denmark and go back to the United States...alone. Could we really have a happily ever after? Thanks for all of the reviews! I will keep on updating the story! I really do enjoy reading the reviews that are left![Chapter 9] Eddie and I walked to his car in complete silence with our body guards following behind along us. After tonight, I was furious with Eddie, and he knew that I was angry from my silence. \"We will follow you home,\" Eddie's bodyguard, Adrian, told us. \"Thank you, Adrian. Desiree, you may go home as soon as we get back to the palace,\" Eddie told our bodyguards. Adrian and Desiree got into their car, and I got into the passenger's side of Eddie's car, closed the door and waited for Eddie to get into the driver's side. Eddie began driving and neither of us said anything to each other. The silence was deafening. I finally decided to break the ice. \"You don't have anything to say?\" I asked Eddie. \"I believe you have a lot to say,\" Eddie grumbled. \"I found out during a life interview on national TV that you had lunch with your ex-girlfriend today after you told me that you had a business meeting and couldn't have lunch with me. And you have the audacity to be annoyed with me!?\" I snapped at Eddie. All of the anger from the show was finally coming out. \"I feel like I never get to see you! I'm either in class or studying, and you are either in Parliament or at an official outing or in your office doing paperwork. We finally had a chance to do something together, and you chose your ex-girlfriend over me!\" I exclaimed, my voice rising. \"Paige, before you accuse me, maybe you should have asked me about this,\" Eddie snapped back. \"What is there to ask!? I saw the picture!\" I exclaimed. \"And you didn't even tell me about it. I had to find out from Noel on live TV.\" \"Really!?\" Eddie snapped. \"You jump to conclusions based off of the picture!? You of all people should know that pictures don't always tell the truth!\" \"Okay, so did your mother Photoshop that picture too?\" I asked. \"No, but listen Paige. Our relationship is never going to work if we just jump down each other's throats all the time,\" Eddie yelled. \"I am listening but you're yelling at me!\" I exclaimed, angry. Eddie took in a deep breath and then exhaled. \"I did see Anja today for lunch,\" Eddie said calmly, looking straight ahead. He was avoiding eye-contact with me. Anja was his ex-girlfriend before me. \"So you lied to me,\" I said quietly. \"But it was for business, Paige,\" Eddie said. \"Her father owns the famous historic hotel downtown in Copenhagen. We needed their support and to see if they could hold this upcoming fundraiser banquet for the children's hospital. Parliament is hosting the banquet. We weren't alone; George was with us,\" Eddie replied stoic, looking ahead at the road. \"Ah, the old three friends meeting again for lunch,\" I replied quietly. Eddie didn't reply. \"You don't get it, do you? This life...the royal life. It's going to require me to run into people from my past and interact with them. You have to trust me, Paige. We can't always have a big fight,\" Eddie said firmly, with his voice rising slightly. \"I don't get it!?\" I exclaimed, furious with Eddie. \"I don't get this life!? YOU don't get why I'm upset. When I asked you if we could have lunch today, you said no since you had a business meeting. I haven't seen you in about a week. I understand your duties, and I understand your responsibilities, but DON'T lie to me,\" I snapped. \"I didn't lie to you, Paige!\" Eddie exclaimed! \"YES! YES! You did!\" I yelled. \"You failed to mention that you were having lunch with Anja and George. You three used to hang out all the time before. Anja was your ex-girlfriend. When you hide something from someone, that's lying!\" I exclaimed, my voice rising. \"I didn't do anything wrong,\" Eddie argued. \"You really don't think you did anything wrong!? You REALLY don't understand why I'm upset!?\" I exclaimed. \"You're overreacting,\" Eddie argued. \"It's the fact that you had a \"business\" lunch with George and Anja and don't understand why I'm upset. It's the fact that you LIED to me. We wouldn't be having this argument right now if you were just HONEST with me. Heck, even bring me along. Don't want to spend time with me? Or do you just want to spend time with George and Anja?\" I snapped. \"Paige, just calm down. We'll continue this conversation in a moment,\" he said pulling into the palace and parking. As soon as he put the car in park, I immediately got out of the car and began walking to my room. Tears were streaming down my face, and I didn't want Eddie to see. I felt betrayed, and I couldn't believe that he lied to me. After everything that we had been through, he lied to me!? And to top it off, he didn't see what was wrong with it and didn't consider it to be lying!? I went up to my room and sat down on my bed. Was this relationship really going to work? We came from two completely different worlds. Maybe we won't ever be able to completely understand each other because of that? I needed time to think, and I needed to get away from the palace. I hated being so far away from home; I wanted to talk to my mother in the worst way. I knew that I could FaceTime her, but it wasn't the same as actually talking to her in person. I got up from my bed and began to pack a duffel bag quickly. I needed to get out of the palace just for the night. I needed to think about my relationship with Eddie and clear my mind. \"What are you doing?\" Eddie asked, coming into my room. He had stopped dead in tracks, shocked to see me packing up. \"I just need to spend the night away from here...from all of this,\" I said. \"Paige, no. Don't go. Please,\" Eddie pleaded. \"Please, let's talk this through.\" \"I just don't understand how you don't know why I'm upset!\" I exclaimed. \"You don't get it!\" \"Then explain it to me and let me understand,\" Eddie said. \"I'm not leaving leaving,\" I told Eddie. \"I just want a day away to cool down and to think...\" I said trailing off. \"To think about what?\" Eddie asked. \"Tonight was a disaster, Eddie. When we were asked those questions, we knew literally nothing about each other. Maybe everyone is right,\" I said angrily. \"Right about what?\" Eddie asked. \"That royals and norms can't have successful relationships,\" I said going back and forth from my dresser and my suitcase. \"Oh come on, Paige. That's silly-\" \"And Arabella sent me this,\" I said tossing my phone at him, cutting him off. Arabella had sent me a meme that was going viral. It was of my reaction when Eddie said he wouldn't abdicate the throne. The caption said: The face you make when your fiance says he won't leave the throne to marry you.\" \"Apparently, it's going viral,\" I said putting my hairbrush in my bag. \"Look, I don't care about this. I don't care about some stupid meme. I don't care about not knowing the answer to some stupid questions,\" Eddie said with emotion, handing me my phone back. \"I care about you, Paige,\" he said softly, looking at my eyes. \"When you were asked if you would leave the throne if you didn't get permission from Parliament, you kept on stating that it wouldn't come to that. But what if it does, Eddie!? Are you really prepared to give all of this up?\" I asked him, pointing to room around me. \"You always said that you would leave it for me...even if you didn't have to. I guess that was another lie,\" I said walking to the bathroom for my toothbrush and toothpaste. \"Paige, wait,\" Eddie said gently taking my arm. I turned around to look at him, tears in my eyes. My anger was turning into sadness as I realized that my relationship with Eddie was crumbling before my eyes. \"I didn't say on TV tonight that I would abdicate the throne if necessary because the press would have field with it and with you. They would always be looking for signs that I was abdicating the throne, and you would be the horrible American who took the king away from the Danes. I didn't want that for either of us, especially you. I love you,\" Eddie said gently, taking his hand and wiping a tear from my face. \"I love you too,\" I whispered. At that sweet moment, Eddie's cell phone went off. \"Duty calls,\" I said pulling away from him and going into the bathroom to get my toothbrush and toothpaste. \"I'm not going to take it,\" Eddie said rejecting the call. \"Right now, you are more important to me than some charity banquet,\" he said silencing his phone. He came over to me and gently took my hand and led me over to the edge of my bed. We sat down together. \"If you really want to go and spend a few days away from the palace, I'm not going to stop you. I'd rather you stay here though. Give me a few days, and maybe next weekend we can both get away together,\" Eddie said. \"I think we both feel a disconnection because of our crazy schedules. Tonight shouldn't have been the first time we have seen each other in days. I'm sorry about that, Paige,\" Eddie told me. \"Is this going to work? Us? We both want different things, and we come from two totally different world,\" I said, voicing my concerns. \"Do you still want to marry me?\" Eddie asked me. \"Yes, of course,\" I said, confused by his question. \"And I want to marry you,\" Eddie said taking my hand and squeezing it. \"I don't care if I lived on a different planet, and I didn't speak a word of English. If we both wanted to marry each other, that is all we need to make our relationship work.\" \"And open communication,\" I stated. \"Yes...I do believe I overreacted today,\" Eddie said. \"I shouldn't have said that you were overreacting, and I shouldn't have brought up those pictures with Jake. It wasn't called for. I was wrong. I should have told you why I couldn't have lunch with you today. And if you really wanted to go to a boring business meeting, I would have loved to bring you along and show you off to Anja and George,\" he said and I laughed and sniffled. \"Anja originally wanted to meet alone, but I asked George to join me since is he also on the committee. Even though it was business, I didn't think it was right to meet her alone,\" he said. \"It really was a business lunch, Paige. There was some off-topic conversation, but I promise you that 95% of the conversation was strictly business,\" he assured me. \"I promise that in the future, I'll be completely honest with you. I'm really sorry, Paige. You had the right to be angry,\" Eddie told me, looking sincerely into my eyes. \"I'm not mad because you had lunch with them. I'm mad because you lied to me about today,\" I said. I wanted him to understand the exact reason. \"I know. I was wrong, and you were right. I won't do that again. Also, regardless of what some stupid tabloid prints tomorrow, know that I will give up my royal title, leave Denmark and marry you,\" he told me, squeezing my hand. \"I just feel like if you said that you were willing to leave the throne on TV tonight then maybe Parliament would approve us,\" I said. \"Do you want to stay here?\" Eddie asked. \"I'd prefer the US, but I know it's going to be quite an adjustment for you,\" I said. \"And it's an adjustment that I am willing to make,\" he told me. \"I feel like I'm making you give up your life and who you are,\" I said, getting it off of my chest. \"You're not...you're not. I don't want you to feel like you are. It's my choice. You are a part of my life. If I chose the throne over you, I would be a miserable person. I love you, Paige. Please don't ever forget that amidst all of this chaos,\" he said, leaning in to give me a gentle kiss on the lips. \"I shouldn't have attacked you tonight in the car. I should have handled the situation differently. I was just upset. I'm sorry,\" I told Eddie. \"All is forgiven and forgotten,\" he said leaning in to kiss me again. \"Will you please stay here tonight?\" Eddie asked me after a few moments of silence. \"Yes,\" I said getting up to unpack. Was it too much to ask to have a fairy tail ending to my story? As much as Eddie and I fought to keep our relationships, I wondered if we would get married and truly live happily ever after.[Chapter 10] After our huge fight, I was still frustrated with Eddie. He said that he now understood my anger and apologized for it, but part of me actually wondered if we would have a successful marriage. I wondered if I should leave...if it would be best for both of us. I spent the entire night in my bed tossing and turning, crying, and thinking about us and our future. I watched the interview even though I said I wouldn't do it. It was awful. We looked so disconnected and so distant from each other. We couldn't answer those questions about each other. And we were going to get married!? I sighed heavily as I heard my alarm go off. I didn't sleep at all that night. The Royal Family was going to the grand opening of a new children's hospital. Rosalind said that it would be best for the entire royal family to be there since we want Parliament's blessing on our marriage. Also, after last night's fiasco, it would be best if Eddie and I went to this event together. I got up, took a shower, got dressed in one of my official royal outing outfits (aka...it was extremely expensive, and I wasn't comfortable in it). Christian came in while I was putting on make-up to go over the schedule for the day. Eddie would cut the ribbon, and I would stand next to him and look happy. The reporters would probably ask us about our wedding and last night's interview. I walked with Christian and Desiree down to the car. \"Isn't Edvard coming with us?\" I asked as Christian was getting ready to start the car. \"He had a late-morning breakfast meeting. He is meeting us there,\" Christian responded. \"Of course he did,\" I mumbled under my breath. At the grand opening, Eddie came to me and took my hand as I got out of car. \"Smile,\" Desiree mumbled under her breath. I took Eddie's hand and smiled at the cameras. Even though I hadn't slept at all and even though Eddie and I were on odd terms with each other, we both still put on a happy face and made it look as though everything was okay. \"King Edvard! Crown Queen Paige! Is it true that there will be a wedding on July 24th?\" A reporter shouted as we walked to the front of the hospital. Wait- did the reporter just call me Crown Queen Paige? That was so weird to hear... \"Yes, it is true,\" Eddie replied. My stomach churned slightly. Was there really going to be a wedding? Eddie had another meeting today, and I assume it was with Anja. Why wouldn't he tell me he had a meeting with her again today? Why was he lying to me? \"Let's a picture of the happy, royal couple!\" Another reporter shouted. Eddie put his hand on my lower-back, and we smiled and turned to face to the camera. About fifty cameras flashed in our faces. \"King Edvard, will you abdicate the throne to marry Paige Morgan?\" A reporter asked Eddie. Eddie took my hand and squeezed it. I tried to not look at him but instead, looked straight ahead at the cameras. \"If I have to chose between the throne and my title and Paige Morgan, I pick Paige Morgan,\" Eddie said authoritatively. I looked up at him, surprised at his answer. The reporters began buzzing with conversation and then began throwing a bunch of questions at us. \"Paige Morgan! Do you want King Edvard to abdicate the throne to marry you?\" A reporter shouted at me. \"I...I would never ask King Edvard to abdicate the throne for me,\" I replied. \"But if I am presented with no other choice, then I will not hesitate to renounce my throne and my title. I will not be happy without Paige Morgan along my side in life,\" Eddie said firmly to the reporters. I saw Rosalind standing off to the side watching us. She seemed a little taken aback by Eddie's words, but she nodded at me when I looked at her, and I could tell that she approved of them. Maybe, after all this time, she was coming around and accepting out relationship. After the cutting of the ribbon, we went to the historic hotel in downtown Copenhagen for the charity fundraiser for the hospital. Eddie and I walked to the historic hotel together since it was within walking distance. Eddie took my hand during the walk, although we began our walk in silence. I had so much that I wanted to say and ask him, but I didn't want all the reporters and everyone around us to hear. \"I have a special private dinner arranged for us tomorrow night. Just the two of us. I love you, and I'm sorry that we haven't been able to spend a lot of time together,\" Eddie whispered to me. \"That sounds wonderful,\" I said quietly, looking up and smiling at him. \"I can't wait,\" I whispered. \"No phone, no one bothering us, just you and me,\" Eddie whispered again. His lips brushed gently against my ears and sent shivers down my spine. I had to resist the urge to kiss him right there. He was really trying to make an effort after our big fight last night. Maybe our relationship was truly on our way to amends.[Chapter 11] At the banquet, Eddie proudly introduced me to everyone as his fiancee. It was an exhausting afternoon of acting like everything was fine between me and Eddie and acting very happy. In reality, I just wanted to go back to my room, hide under the covers, watch TV and cry. I felt this incredible pressure to charm everyone there. After the luncheon, Eddie and I went off to a separated room in the hotel, away from the rest of the guests. \"I'm exhausted,\" I commented as I sat down on a chair in the room. It was so nice to get away from the commotion for a few minutes. \"It's been a long day,\" Eddie commented, sitting at a chair next to me. I think we were in the hotel conference room. \"Yeah, and I didn't sleep last night either,\" I said. \"Not even for a minute...\" \"Why didn't you sleep well last night?\" Eddie asked me. \"Because I was upset...after our fight,\" I said solemnly, looking into Eddie's blue eyes \"I was too...\" Eddie said looking at the table. \"Christian said you had another breakfast meeting this morning...\" I began. I wanted to address it with him since he didn't mention it to me, but I didn't want to start another fight. \"Yes, it was very last minute. I just got a phone call about it when I woke up. We had a big group meeting about the opening procedures today,\" Eddie explained. \"I was looking for you this morning. You couldn't have texted me about it?\" I asked calmly. \"Yes, I could have...I should have...I'm sorry about that, Paige.\" \"We need to work on our communication skills,\" I said. \"It meant a lot to me what you told the reporters this morning,\" I said, changing the topic. \"I mean every single word of it. You are my life, Paige Morgan,\" he said taking my hand and squeezing it. \"I'm sorry that I haven't been good at communicating lately, and I'm sorry that we haven't spent a lot of time together. I promise that we will in the future,\" he said taking my hand. Tears welled up in my eyes as he said those words. \"What's wrong, Paige?\" he asked concerned. \"I just...I've just felt so disconnected from you lately. It's been killing me because I love you so much. I try so hard to act like a royal and to please Parliament, please your parents, please Denmark, please Christian and Desiree and even please you. It's taken such an emotional toll on me...all of this. I just feel that I am letting everyone down. And I felt like when I needed you the most, you weren't there for me. This past week as has been a awful. I've had paparazzi following me at school, made a fool of myself on national television, my facial expression has become a national meme and I have the press watching my every move. And I've had the pressure from school as well. It's been hard,\" I said wiping the tears away from my eyes. \"I love you, Paige. And I'm so sorry that I haven't been there for you this week. I promise that we will make time for each other each night. Even if I just watch you study,\" Eddie said and I laughed. \"Don't worry about what other people say. To me, you are perfect. \"Come here,\" he said, pulling me into for an embrace. \"I've missed you and your smell,\" I said snuggling my face into his chest. \"My smell?\" Eddie asked. \"Your cologne. You always smell good,\" I said chuckling. Eddie put his cheek on top of my hair and squeezed me. \"And I have always loved the smell of your shampoo. Don't ever change it,\" he said and I laughed again. We looked up at each other and kissed each other deeply for the first time in over a week. It was a real kiss and not just a simple peck when we would run into each other. Eddie began to kiss me harder, crushing my lips against his and pulling me in, crushing his body against mine. His kisses were slow, deep and full of passion and love. I put my arms around him and began to run my fingers through his hair. Eddie moved his lips to my earlobe and slow down my neck, planting passionate kisses. I moaned quietly, leaned my head back and pulled his head closer to my neck. Eddie moved back up to my lips and began to kiss me forcefully and passionately. My heart was racing, and Eddie's touch of his hands on my back were sending shivers down my spine. Suddenly, there was a gentle knock at the door, interrupting us and causing Eddie and I jumped a part. \"Yes, come in,\" Eddie said as we put some space between us. \"Your Highness,\" Soren said bowing slightly. Desiree was with him, which caused him to be formal with us. \"The banquet it wrapping up so I'd recommend coming back out to mingle,\" Soren said. \"Yes, of course. Thank you, Soren,\" Eddie replied, and Soren closed the door behind us. \"I guess we need to go back out,\" I said getting up. \"Just one more kiss,\" Eddie said standing up and pulling me into his chest, kissing me forcefully and passionately. Eddie smiled at me as we broke a part. \"Let's go say good-bye to the guests,\" Eddie said taking my hand as we opened the door, went out into the hallway, and back to the reception. There, a member of Parliament came up to Eddie and asked to speak to him privately, leaving me alone with several Dukes, Duchesses, and other very rich people. Back in Wisconsin, I would have never associated myself with these people. As an American and as a commoner, I felt so out of place. I looked for a familiar face, but only found Rosalind and Haarold. I wasn't sure if they would want me to join their conversation. I assumed Haarold would be okay with it, but I wasn't sure about Rosalind. \"Miss Paige Morgan,\" I heard a voice behind me say. I turned around and saw a male member of Parliament behind me. \"Hello Mr...\" I said, trailing off since I didn't know the name. \"Frandsen,\" he finished for me. \"It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance,\" I said nodding at him. \"May I have a moment with you?\" He asked me. \"Certainty,\" I told him. He lowered his voice and moved slightly to the side and I followed his lead. \"Miss Morgan, I understand that King Edvard is discussing abdicating the throne to be with you,\" he stated factually. \"I wanted to advice you that this isn't the wisest decision on his part,\" he told me. \"The only life King Edvard knows is this one...his royal life. Have you given any thought to what life would be like for him after he gives up everything for you?\" He asked me. \"I believe that what King Edvard and I discuss privately should remain private,\" I said. \"Since you are associated with the royal family, nothing you ever say or do will ever remain private,\" he told me. \"The Danes take their royal family very seriously. It has been the way things are done here. King Edvard renouncing the throne to marry a commoner would not only upset the royal family, it would also upset several Danes. They are proud of who they are and their culture. You wouldn't want that on your hands, would you?\" he asked me. \"If you are trying to talk King Edvard out of abdicating the throne, I believe you are talking to the wrong person,\" I replied calmly. \"Yes, but King Edvard will listen to you before he will listen to anyone else,\" Mr. Frandsen said. \"I don't quite understand what you want me to do or say,\" I began to say. He sighed heavily. \"Miss Morgan, with all due respect, you need to take into consideration that you messing with the Danish monarchy that has been established for more than 1000 years. King Edvard leaving the throne to marry a commoner would cause chaos amongst the monarchy and the Danish people. The Danes love their royal family. It was cause an unbalance in the Danish government. The Danish king stills plays an important role in the Danish government. Are you prepared to be responsible for all those negative effects?\" \"Again, if King Edvard decides to abdicate the thone, I believe that is out of my control,\" I repeated. \"If you left him, then he would not leave the throne,\" Mr. Frandsen told me. I look up surprised at his frankness. \"If you are so considered about the possibility of King Edvard abdicating the throne, perhaps you should speak to your fellow members of Parliament about giving us permission to marry,\" I said firmly \"I didn't want to say this, but people are concerned about your past and your past history with drugs and alcohol...\" he said quietly but I knew it was a way to throw one more thing my way. I opened my mouth and then I closed it. I needed to choose my words carefully. \"The issue is that people, especially the members of Parliament, have not wanted to take the time to know me...the REAL me. The only have found the time to read the lies printed in the tabloids. Now, if you'll excuse me, there are other guests I need to attend to,\" I said walking away with my head high. The nerve of him! How dare he come and tell me not to marry Eddie! I couldn't wait till we left the country. I was tired of always being under scrutiny of the public eye. I loved Eddie with my entire heart and soul but the truth was part of me wondered if he was right...if everyone was right. If Eddie and I married, we would be setting ourselves up for a lifetime of unhappiness due to his position as the King of Denmark.[Chapter 12] \"Hi mom,\" I said Face Timing my mom later that night. We had just finished the charity event for the Children's Hospital, and it was very late at night. Eddie and I had just arrived back at the palace, and it was about 1am. I was extremely exhausted; both physically and emotionally. When we arrived back at the palace, Eddie and I went out own separate ways to our rooms since we had a church meeting with the priest for wedding preparation before Sunday Mass at 7am. By the time I showered and watched some TV to unwind, it would probably 2am or 3am. However, I couldn't think of sleeping or unwinding. More than anything, I wanted to talk to my family and feel that connection to home. I know that Denmark would be my new home, but I was struggling more than anything with the transition into the royal spotlight, a new language, and a new culture. \"Hey sweetie,\" my mom said. \"You look pretty tonight. Did you have an event with Eddie?\" She asked me. \"We had a charity event for the new Children's Hospital in Copenhagen,\" I explained. \"How did that go?\" She asked me. \"It went well. I'm exhausted though. We've been busy since about 11am today with the opening of the hospital and then there was the charity ball event tonight. I just got back to my room. It's 1:15am here now, and we have a 7am meeting with the priest who is going to celebrate the wedding for marriage preparation.\" I said, speaking a mile a minute. \"Slow down there, Paige. You sound exhausted. Why aren't you in bed yet?\" She asked me. \"I can't sleep…\" I said, trailing off. \"Is everything okay between you and Eddie?\" she asked me gently. My mom knew me too well. When she asked that question, I could feel tears forming in my eyes. \"We had a pretty bad fight last night, and tonight a member of Parliament came up to me and told me how I should basically disappear so that I don't disrupt the Danish monarchy when Edvard advocates the throne to marry me,\" I explained taking off my shoes. My feet were killing me after being in heels almost all-day long. \"What? Why would someone in Parliament say that to you?\" She asked me. \"Because they hate me and don't want Edvard to marry me,\" I said, frustrated. \"What did Eddie say when you told him about this?\" She asked me. \"I didn't tell him….\" I said, trailing off. \"We finally had a pleasant evening at the Charity Ball, and we weren't alone in the car on the ride back. When we arrived home, we said good-night and went out separate ways since we'll be up early tomorrow.\" \"You finally had a pleasant evening? What's been going on?\" My mom asked me. Finally, I was able to get everything off of my chest. I told her how Eddie said he had business meeting and couldn't have lunch with me and then met with his ex-girlfriend and George. I told her about our awful fight and how Eddie didn't understand why I was upset at first. He didn't understand why his actions were wrong and why I considered it to be lying. I explained how I was worried about our different worlds (royalty versus the common world) and how we would be compatible in marriage. Lastly, I explained about the awful TV interview and how before the interview, Eddie acted guilty. He knew that his actions were wrong. I also explained that during the interview, Eddie said he wouldn't abdicate the throne for me but today, he retracted those comments in front of the press. \"Also, my reaction during the TV interview became a national meme,\" I said, frustrated and finally letting the tears fall down. \"Paige, I think that you and Eddie do come from very different worlds and because of that, you need to work on your communication with each other. What bothers you? What bothers him? I do agree that he did lie to you and that wasn't right,\" she told me. \"Thank you,\" I said forcefully. \"I do think on the comment on TV was to protect you. It sounds like Parliament is truly against your marriage and if Eddie said that he would leave the throne for you, I think Parliament would look to find more fault with you. But Eddie did see your point of you and decided to retract those statements today. He loves you very deeply, Paige. You have to know that,\" my mom told me. When she said that, I burst into tears. \"Do you not feel that way?\" She asked me gently. \"I miss Eddie. I miss the Eddie I know from the United States. We never see each other, and we live in the same place! We're both so busy, and I feel so disconnected from him. I know he's the king, and he has to be diplomatic. But more than anything, I just want us to sit down and watch a TV show, eat dinner together, or just ask each other about our days. I feel like I don't know him anymore, and I'm honestly starting to have doubts, mom. I don't belong here in the palace,\" I said crying. \"Don't let Parliament and Rosalind get into your head. Do you still want to marry Eddie?\" she asked me. \"Yes, of course. I love Eddie so much, and I can't imagine my life without him. I just want to get back to where we were in the US…in college,\" I said. \"You know, love grows. In college, you wanted to spend every single second with each other, and now, you are moving onto marriage and potentially starting a family one day. You have heavier topics to discuss and hard decisions to make. In college, you got to know each other, and you had fun together. You are still getting to know each other, but your love is progressing and growing,\" my mom explained to me. I looked at her and nodded to show that I understood, but I feel as though my mom didn't understand what I was saying. \"I just feel disconnected to him…as though I don't even know him that well anymore,\" I explained. \"Tomorrow, tell Eddie that you are feeling disconnected. Try to make it a plan once a week to eat dinner together and just spend time together. Go out into Copenhagen and do something fun. Rekindle that fire. You have to work on communication with each other. If you don't communicate well and just keep emotions bottled up, you're going to have a bad marriage. Maybe discuss with the priest tomorrow strategies for open communication,\" she told me gently and understanding. \"Okay. I'll do that,\" I said calming down. \"Now, get some sleep. You must be exhausted,\" she told me. \"I know, and I didn't sleep last night either,\" I said. \"I think you'll feel better tomorrow about everything after talking to Eddie and getting some sleep. Call me tomorrow and let me know how things went, okay?\" she said. \"I will. I love you, mom,\" I said blowing a kiss to the camera on my phone. \"I love you too,\" she said blowing one back at me. \"Send my love to dad and Johnny and Mikey,\" I said. \"I will. Good-night sweetie,\" she told me. \"Good-night…well for you, it's good-morning.\" \"That's true…bye!\" \"Bye,\" I said, disconnecting the call. I went and showered and crawled into bed. I put on The Office , but I still couldn't fall asleep. My mom was right, I needed to have better communication with Eddie and everything would be better tomorrow in the morning. But why did my heart still hurt so much? Sleepless, I decided to go on Facebook to see the newsfeed of my friends from the US. It was my personal Facebook page that no one in Denmark knew about. I had a fake name, but it was my way to keep in touch with that part of the world and that part of my life. Off to the side, I saw that Eddie was active and online. Could he not sleep either? I logged off my computer, put on my bathrobe, and decided to go walk to Eddie's room. I walked up the flight of stairs and down the hallway to his end room- the King's room. At night, the palace had a slightly creepy aura to it, especially when you walked the hallways at night without any lights on. I knocked gently on the door just in case he was sleeping. \"Eddie?\" I said quietly as I knocked. I heard footsteps come to the door, and Eddie opened it, surprised to see me. \"You couldn't sleep either?\" he asked. \"No…,\" I said. \"Come in,\" he said, gently taking my hand and closing the door behind him. \"What's keeping you up, Paige?\" Eddie asked me as we walked over to his living area and sat down on the couch. \"Just everything that has been going on,\" I replied sitting down. \"What's keeping you up?\" I asked. \"I feel really bad about what happened yesterday and our fight. I said some things that I know hurt you, and I truly regret them and my actions. I shouldn't have hidden my lunch with Anja and George…even if it was about the charity event. I wish I could take it back and make completely different decisions,\" he told me sincerely, taking my hands and looking into my eyes. \"I wish I had invited you to join us. It wasn't fair for you to find out on TV about the lunch, and I should have said on the interview that I would abdicate the throne and living in a cardboard box with you on the side of the road. I know being here in Denmark isn't easy for you. And I haven't been there for you to make it any easier. I am truly sorry, Paige. I was being a jerk,\" he said gently rubbing his thumb over my hand. \"I've been feeling so disconnected from you. I miss us…I miss Eddie and Paige from the beginning of this year…from this summer. I feel like we really need to work on our communication and make time for each other at least once a week. We can't keep on going about two weeks without barely seeing each other and spending time with each other. Text messages aren't the same as face to face communication and touch,\" I explained to him. \"I completely agree. And our fight wouldn't have happened if we had been communicating better,\" he told me. \"I'm not just upset about our fight or what happened,\" I said. \"I'm upset about our disconnect from each other. I sometimes feel as though…\" I began to say and then I decided to stop. \"What?\" Eddie asked. \"I mean, I don't know how your days go or what you're doing. I just want to share a life with you and feel the deep connection that we had this summer and earlier this year,\" I said. \"You don't feel it now?\" Eddie asked me. \"No,\" I said. \"Do you?\" I asked. \"I feel it, but I do feel the disconnect that you do,\" he told me. \"Probably not as strong of a disconnect…\" \"You have to remember too that I don't have any family here. I have some friends, but it's not the same the US. You are really all I have here in Denmark. When we are connecting, I feel really lost and homesick for the United States,\" I explained to him. \"I never thought of it that way…\" he said, trailing off. \"I know. That's why I'm explaining my feelings to you,\" I told him factually. \"I'm sorry, Paige. I never realized how lost and disconnected you feel.\" \"I mean the first time we actually kissed, and not just a peck on the lips, was tonight in the meeting room of the hotel for the charity event. It was the first time in weeks, I think. I miss that connection. I need that connection with you,\" I explained. \"You're right. We have been pretty disconnected from each other…\" Eddie said quietly. \"I'm sorry,\" he said sighing heavily. \"I'm really sorry that I haven't been there for you and that you've been carrying this around with you.\" \"It's not your fault. I wasn't communicating my feelings to you. I kept them bottled up,\" I said. \"I am going to clear my schedule for tomorrow. I want to spend the entire Sunday with you before the week starts,\" he told me, getting up to get his phone. \"You don't have to change everything-\" I started to say. \"No, Paige. I want to spend the entire day with you with no interruptions and no meetings. We both need it. Let's re-create what we had this summer,\" he said. \"I'm still the same Eddie. We are still Eddie and Paige,\" he said coming back over to me. His words made me teary-eyed. \"You would cancel you weekly meeting with the Prime Minister and your meeting with the King of Algeria? Aren't they important?\" I asked. \"You are the most important person in my life, and I have been neglecting you. I am very sorry, Paige,\" he said sitting down and taking my hands in his. \"I've been neglecting you too. It's both of our faults,\" I told him. \"I suppose a medical student and a King don't have the most flexible schedules,\" Eddie said chuckling. \"No,\" I said smiling at him. \"I promise you that we will sit down and have a conversation every single day. I also promise that we will have a weekly date night and to communicate with you. Finally, I promise to love you until I take my last breath. I hope you realize how deeply I love you,\" he told sincerely looking into my eyes. I took every once of my being to not kiss him right there and then. I wanted to tell Eddie how much I loved him as well and promise him that I will keep open communication with him. \"I promise to never tell you that I don't have time for our conversations or our date nights. I promise to keep open communication with you and to not bottle up my emotions. I promise to love you with every once of my being until I take my last breath. I love you so much. I never thought it would be possible to love and care for someone this much,\" I said leaning in to kiss him passionately. I put my hands through his hair, and Eddie pulled me closer to him. His kisses were electric and passionate. \"Don't stop,\" I whispered to him when we broke apart, out noses touching. \"I wasn't planning on it,\" he said nuzzling my neck, sending shivers down my spine. \"I've missed you,\" he whispered to me, gently kissing my ear. \"I've missed you too,\" I said leaning into him and leaning my neck back for him. Eddie's lips worked his way from my neck to my lips where we resumed our passionate, electrifying kissing. \"We're not going to get any sleep tonight,\" I said smiling in-between the kisses. \"That's okay,\" he said moving me onto his lap and picking me up. I couldn't help but laugh with giddiness and happiness when Eddie abruptly stood up and picked me up with him. I put my arms around his neck, my head on his shoulder and gently kissed his neck as Eddie carried me to his bedroom and placed me gently down his bed where we made passionate love.[Chapter 13] \"I'm going to miss you,\" I said as Eddie packed up a suitcase. \"What am I going to do without you for an entire week?\" I said taking his hand sweetly. \"I'll miss you too. I'll FaceTime with you every single day,\" he said leaning in to give me a quick peck on the lips. \"Come with me,\" he whispered in my ear. \"If I didn't have class or my internship, I would in a heartbeat,\" I replied. Eddie smiled at me and went back to his dresser to continue packing. Eddie had to go out of town to England for an important meeting with the King of England. Eddie wanted England and Denmark to closer together on improving their relations and making a deal on exports and imports between the two countries. After our fight, Eddie and I had really been working on communication with one another. We made an effort to have a date night at least once a week and to eat dinner together nightly or watch some TV together nightly. Some nights, there were flukes in our plans but for the most part, we were able to maintain our commitments to each other. As a result, our relationship was improving, and I was starting to feel as though our relationship was starting to return to what we had back in America. \"Just listen to Desiree,\" Eddie told me. \"She'll keep you safe.\" \"I was worried that you were going to say that I needed to listen to your mother,\" I said jokingly. \"I would never suggest such a horrid thing,\" he said making a face. \"She's trying to make things right with us though,\" I said gently. Rosalind had been trying to make amends with me and Eddie after the press released the fake picture of me kissing Jake. Rosalind had wanted Kirsten to work with the press and release something to destroy our relationship so that Eddie and I would break-up, and he would marry Kirsten. Author's note: Above plot line was in Prince and Me Fanfiction (Part 2) \"She's trying, but she can un-do all the pain that she's done,\" Eddie replied. \"I know…\" I said drawing my legs into my chest. \"I promise we'll FaceTime every single night. I love you,\" he said as he zipped out his suitcase and pulled out the handle to pull it. I got up, went over to him and put my arms around him. \"I love you too,\" I said as I leaned in to kiss him passionately. We were interrupted by a knock on the door. Eddie went over to open it and saw Soren standing there is his notebook and pen. \"Unfortunately, Edvard, we are behind schedule. We need to leave for the airport immediately. The pilot is waiting for you on the royal plane,\" he told Eddie. Eddie took his suitcase and started to pull it out into the hallway. I followed shortly behind him, and Eddie took my hand. We walked down the staircase and outside to the car that was waiting for him. The driver took Eddie's suitcase and then Eddie turned to me and kissed me one last time before he left. \"It's just a week. I'll be back before you know it,\" Eddie said. \"Just a week,\" I said leaning into his chest for one last hug. \"Sir, we really need to go,\" Soren said to Eddie. Eddie started to walk toward the car and only let go of my hand when we were far enough a part to no longer hold hands. I stood and waited till the car was off in the distance. \"So, it's going to be a whole week without Eddie and living in a palace with his mother,\" I said quietly to Soren. \"It's not going to be that bad. We will stick together. Arabella will be around and so will King Haarold. Plus, between your classes and your internship, you are almost never home,\" Soren said. \"That's true. I'm actually going to Sarah and Clara's apartment later tonight to watch The Bachelor. I may just get drunk and spend the night there,\" I said smiling at Soren's reaction when I mentioned \"getting drunk.\" \"Promise me you won't use that phrase around Queen Rosalind,\" Soren said cracking a smile. \"I was planning on saying it at least five times,\" I said laughing as we were walking into the palace. Later that night I was over at Sarah and Clara's to watch the season finale of The Bachelor. We made frozen mozzarella sticks, had chips and queso, had ordered a pizza, and brought lots and lots of wine and beer. It was going to be a girl's night. \"So what does it feel like to be eating normal people junk food and doing a normal girl's night?\" Clara asked me. \"It feels great,\" I said taking a piece of pizza and a beer and sitting down on the couch. \"It feels nice to just be myself, have too much to drink, and just have fun with my friends. I don't have to worry about the paparazzi,\" I said taking a sip of the beer. \"So who do you think he's going to pick? Andrea or Yilma?\" Sara asked joining us on the coach. \"It has to be Andrea. They have such chemistry,\" I replied. \"NO! He has to pick Yilma! She's from Italy like my family,\" Clara replied, causing us all to laugh. About half-way through the show, Sara took out her phone and joined the Twitter conversation on the season finale of our favorite reality TV show. \"Oh my gosh,\" she said seriously and stopped scrolling on her phone. \"What is it?\" I asked and immediately giggled slightly. I was enjoying this girl's night. \"Paige, it's the paparazzi. The published a recent article about you and your hospital stay a few months back,\" she said showing me her phone as my face fell. I took her phone and saw the headline that Denmark was buzzing about. Paige Morgan was hospitalized for a miscarriage! Inside source in the palace tells all! \"Oh my gosh! How did they….How?\" I said clicking on the story. Sara and Clara were looking at me concerned and just as shocked. Paige Morgan, 23, was hospitalized early this year for an ectopic pregnancy, an inside source in the palace explained. In the middle of the night, Morgan was rushed to the hospital in severe pain and a loss of a large amount of blood. The inside source explained that Morgan's bedsheets and pajamas were soaked in blood. The palace has not commented on this recent news . I gave Sara her phone back completely stunned. I was so looking forward to this night, but the paparazzi always has to ruin everything. I didn't say anything and just looked at the TV, almost numb. \"Paige,\" Clara said gently. \"Are you okay?\" \"How did they know?\" I said quietly, almost whispering. \"Paige, we swear that we didn't tell anyone!\" Sara exclaimed. \"We would never betray you like that,\" Clara also said. \"I don't understand how they knew…\" I said trailing off. \"We swear we didn't tell anyone. Not a soul,\" Clara told me. \"I'm not accusing you,\" I said quietly. \"There is this one reporter…he said that he knew what had happened and threatened to tell everyone. I assume it was him,\" I said quietly. \"I need some air,\" I said getting up and walking to the door. \"Paige! You can't go outside! You've had too much to drink! Someone will see you and snap a picture,\" Sara said getting up and blocking the door. \"I can't do anything anymore,\" I said frustrated. \"I can't even have a night of fun with my friends,\" I complained. \"And all of this news…this is going to bring all the memories and feelings back. It was so hard losing the baby. I still think of the baby…how far along I would be…whether it was a boy or a girl…what we would have named it,\" I said sitting down against the door with my hands pushing my hair back. I was struggling to fight back tears. Sara and Clara both sat down next to me, and they both put a comforting arm around me. \"I am so sorry that this is happening again,\" Sara said. \"And now the entire country knows my business. They know what happened,\" I said angry. \"I do anything or say anything without the paparazzi publishing an article and twisting my words or analyzing my actions. I'm so tired of it,\" I said frustrated. \"I need a drink,\" I said getting up to get another beer. \"Let's just watch the rest of our TV show and try to push this all out of your mind. Enjoy your night,\" Clara said gently. After finishing our TV show (he picked Yilma) and after a few more beers, I was drunk and so was Sara and Clara. I picked up my phone for the first time that night and saw I had six missed called from Rosalind and about ten missed calls from Desiree. As I was clearing the notifications and reading the text messages, Desiree called again. \"Hello,\" I grumbled trying to hide the fact that I was drunk. \"Miss Morgan! We need you back at the palace immediately! Soren would not tell me your location. The Queen would like to speak to you immediately in regards to the recent news article. Have you seen it?\" She asked me, speaking fast and panicked. \"Desiree, it's 10pm on a Friday night. Can't I speak to the Queen tomorrow?\" I asked. \"Where are you? Have you been drinking?\" She asked me. Crap. She could tell that I had been drinking from my voice. Rosalind would kill me when she saw me. \"I'm fine. Soren knows my location and so does Eddie. Don't worry about me. Tell Queen Rosalind I'll speak to her first thing tomorrow morning,\" I said. \"No, Miss Morgan! We need to have a statement from the palace for the papers to publish tomorrow morning. It's imperative that we meet tonight,\" she told me. \"We don't want this situation to get even worse or more out of hand,\" she told me. \"The situation?\" I asked annoyed. \"How do you know what happened?\" I asked. \"The Queen told me that this recent story had some truth to it and that we needed to meet with the palace publicist immediately. The royal publicist is currently on her way to the palace. We just need you now Miss Morgan,\" she pleaded with me. \"Don't make me track you with your phone.\" \"I'm drunk, Desiree. Tonight isn't a good night to be meeting with the Queen and the royal publicist,\" I said honestly. \"I'm afraid that we don't have a choice Miss Morgan,\" Desiree responded. \"I'm at Clara and Sara's apartment,\" I replied quietly. \"I'll be there in about five minutes,\" she told me, hanging up. I sighed and waited with dread for Desiree. I did not wait to deal with all of this right now and alone with Desiree. Why did Eddie have to go out of town this week of all weeks? *I appreciate all the reviews! Do people still read my updates? Please leave reviews and comments!*[Chapter 14] I entered Desiree's car quickly and closed the door behind me. \"Did anyone see you?\" She asked me. \"I don't think so,\" I replied, putting on my seat belt as she put the car into drive. \"Here, drink this water,\" she said handing me a bottle of water. \"Of all nights for the Queen to want to speak with me,\" I grumbled drinking the water quickly. Desiree handed me another bottle of water. \"How much did you have to drink?\" She asked me. \"A lot,\" I slurred. \"Ugh…\" She said as the palace came into view. I got out of the car, ran to the bathroom, and then went to see Rosalind and the royal publicist in Rosalind's office. Before I entered her office, I took a deep breath and knocked on the door. \"Come in,\" Rosalind's voice said strongly. I opened the door and closed it behind me. Rosalind was looking at me up and down, judging my outfit choice. She was dressed in a suit dress while the royal publicist was wearing a pencil skirt and a ruffled white blouse. I was wearing jeans with black converse shoes, a University of Wisconsin T-shirt and a purple windbreaker jacket. \"I didn't have time to change,\" I said sitting down. \"I see,\" Rosalind said, piercing her eyes at my outfit choice. \"We are working on a statement so the papers can print it first thing in the morning. Before we publish anything, I would like to get your thoughts,\" Rosalind said. \"Have you seen the recent article published about you and your hospital stay?\" She asked me. \"Yes,\" I said quietly. \"This is what we were thinking of sending to press,\" the royal publicist said handing me her i-Pad. The Palace is very surprised about the recent allegations of Ms. Paige Morgan's hospital visit back in October. As stated previously, Ms. Morgan was hospitalized for dehydration and a panic attack. Mental health awareness is very important in Denmark, and it is important that the Danes are here to support their future Queen as she adjusts to the Danish culture. \"I don't agree with it,\" I said handing the i-pad back to the royal publicist. \"Would you give me a moment with Ms. Morgan?\" Rosalind said as the royal publicist got up and left the room. \"What's wrong with it?\" Rosalind asked me. \"It makes it sound like I'm having mental health issues, and I can't adjust to the Danish culture,\" I slurred and said loudly. Crap, I thought to myself. Rosalind knew that I had been drinking. \"Where were you tonight?\" She asked me inquisitively. \"I was at Sarah and Clara's apartment,\" I responded. \"Drinking?\" She asked me, giving me her judgmental look. \"We watched the Bachelor finale. Yes, I had a little to drink,\" I replied. \"A little?\" She asked me raising her eyebrows at me. \"A little more than I had planned on, but I wasn't planning on coming back to the palace tonight. I was going to spend the night there,\" I said looking around the room. I was feeling dizzy. \"I didn't do anything wrong. Eddie and Desiree knew where I was.\" \"You are the future Queen of Denmark! You can't stay out drinking with your friends! It's unacceptable behavior!\" Rosalind exclaimed. \"Parliament won't let us marry! You made sure Parliament won't let us marry with your little stunt with Kirsten,\" I snapped. \"Then why are you still here?\" She snapped back at me. Then suddenly, her demeanor softened. She realized what Eddie was planning on doing. \"Edvard is going to abdicate, isn't he?\" She whispered, solemn. \"If Parliament still refuses to let us marry, yes,\" I replied. \"So what do you think we should do about this recent news story?\" Rosalind asked, changing the subjects. \"I think I should tell the truth. If you want Edvard to stay in Denmark and if you want Parliament to give us permission to marry, I think I should tell the truth. Right now, the media has painted me as an alcoholic, as a drug addict, and now this statement is painting me as someone with mental health issues,\" I exclaimed. \"There is nothing wrong with mental health issues, but this isn't who I am. Denmark and Parliament would love me if you would let me show them who I am!\" I said with emotion, pointing to myself. \"Do you realize what a scandal it would be for the royal family?\" Rosalind asked. \"The King's fiancée was expecting a child out of wedlock? The media will massacre you and will drag your name through the mud,\" Rosalind told me firmly. \"Times have changed Rosalind. I don't think it will be a scandal. The Danish people will be understanding,\" I argued. \"Your drunk, and you are being brave,\" Rosalind said. \"You don't realize what you are saying.\" \"I know what I'm saying!\" I exclaimed. \"Are you prepared for the media slaughtering your name? Every single interview and every single press conference will be about your ectopic pregnancy. Are you prepared to handle it and relive it? Are you prepared to talk about it?\" Rosalind asked me firmly. I shook my head, got up and walked to the other side of the room. \"They will call you names…The King's Whore, the American gold-digger, and every other name you can think of and more. Are you prepared for that?\" Rosalind asked me. \"The people already know,\" I said calmly, walking back to my seat and sitting down. \"My brother yelled at the reporters to leave me alone because I just lost a baby. There is this reporter…the one I yelled at when I left the hospital…who says he knows the truth and he will reveal it to Denmark. There is this story that just came out. And this story is the truth. I don't see the point in denying it anymore,\" I said. \"You want Parliament to approve Eddie marrying me. You want Denmark to love me. I need to show them that I am a person just like them. Losing a pregnancy is such a taboo subject. It shouldn't be. I think there would be more healing for other women who also experienced a miscarriage if we could have open discussions about it. This is the first step to doing that. I'm ready to tell Denmark the truth,\" I said firmly. Rosalind looked at me surprised and as though she was thinking about what I just said to her. \"But you aren't a normal person anymore. You are soon to be a member of the royal family of Denmark,\" Rosalind replied. \"I am a normal person. I'm just a girl from Wisconsin who fell in love with the Prince of Denmark in college,\" I said looking at her. Rosalind sighed heavily and looked at me. \"You aren't going to change your mind, are you?\" Rosalind asked. \"No. I've made my decision,\" I replied. \"How do you plan to make your statement?\" Rosalind asked me. \"I'm going to write it, and then the royal publicist can send it to the newspapers. I'll tweet it too,\" I said. Rosalind sighed again and went to the door to call the royal publicist back in the room. \"Ms. Morgan is going to write a statement now. She would like to write it herself,\" Rosalind said. \"Can you give me a few moments to collect my thoughts?\" I asked, getting up as Rosalind nodded at me. I left the room and went outside to take a walk outside in the gardens. It was almost midnight, but I needed some air to clear my head and collect my thoughts. I sat down at a bench in front of the fountain in the garden and pulled out my phone. I tapped on Eddie's name to call him. \"Hello?\" Eddie asked, sleepily. I think I woke him up. \"Hey…I hope I didn't wake you up,\" I said. \"It's okay. It's nice to wake-up to your voice,\" he said. \"I just had a thirty minute argument with your mother,\" I told him. \"What? What happened? I thought you were at Sarah and Clara's tonight for a girl's night,\" Eddie asked me. \"I was and Desiree came to take me back to the palace for an emergency meeting with your mother and the royal publicist,\" I said putting a strand of loose hair behind my ears. \"What's going on? I'm looking on my tablet…\" Eddie said trailing off. \"Oh no…your ectopic pregnancy came out,\" he replied to me. \"It's been out, Eddie. My brother yelled at the reporters to leave me alone because I miscarried my pregnancy. The one reporter who I yelled at told me that he knew my secret and would tell everyone. I don't see the point in hiding the truth anymore,\" I told Eddie. \"So, you want the statement to tell the truth?\" He asked me. \"Yes. I'd rather tell the truth than continue to be painted as an alcoholic and a drug addict by the media,\" I told me. \"I'm concerned about what the media will say about you,\" Eddie said carefully. \"And since it's true, it will affect you more. I remember how hard it was for you when you lost the baby. I don't want to see you go through the emotional pain again,\" Eddie told me. \"I know but I think it's important for Parliament and Denmark to get to know the real me.\" I replied. \"I support whatever decision you make but make sure you don't rush into a decision,\" Eddie told me. \"I have a feeling though you already made your decision before you called me,\" he said. \"You know me too well,\" I said laughing. \"I miss your laugh, and I miss you,\" Eddie told me. \"I miss you too,\" I told him. \"Only four more days,\" I told him. \"I love you Paige Morgan, and I know that you will make the right decision,\" he told me. \"I love you too. I can't wait to see you again,\" I told him. \"I can't wait to see you either. You're constantly in my thoughts. I think about how much fun would have in England,\" Eddie told me. \"Awww. I really wish I could kiss you right now,\" I said smiling. \"Trust me, me too,\" Eddie told me. \"I'm going to go back to sleep. I'll see you soon and talk to you tomorrow.\" We said good-bye to each other, and I pulled up a note on my i-Phone. I was going to work on my press statement. Research shows that one is every four pregnancies end in miscarriage. In October, I became a part of this statistic. As many of you know that I was hospitalized in the fall. There were various stories such as dehydration, panic attack, nausea, alcoholism, and a drug overdose. As a result of recent news events, I decided it was time to tell the truth about my hospitalization. I want the Danish people to hear the truth from me and not a partial truth or another lie from the tabloids. That night is a night that will forever be ingrained in my memory. I woke up, nauseous, in extreme pain, dehydrated, losing blood and worried because I knew I was pregnant and my worst fear was coming true; I was losing the baby. In the hospital that night, I found out that I had miscarried due to the pregnancy being ectopic. The next few months were a very dark time for me as I tried to come to terms with never seeing my child. I would like to take tomorrow to remember the women who have also miscarried or lost a child. As a society, we need to be open to having a conversation about this difficult topic to help with the healing process. It all begins by having an open conversation with each other and hopefully by telling the truth, we can begin that conversation. I re-read my note and sent it to the royal publicist before tweeting it out on my Twitter account. I went to bed that night worried about the media stories that I would wake up to tomorrow. There was no turning back now. The truth was out. ","Summary":" Chapter 1 After everything that had happened, like our break-up and miscarrying the baby, Eddie dec"},{"Movie":"Passengers, 2016","Title":"Passengers: The Plague of Avalon (Alternative Ending)","Author":"RedBanker42","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12521922","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The Loss Aurora tried the to call Jim again over the radio. \"Jim,\" She called, half crying, half screaming, \"are you there?\" The blast had just launched Jim into space. He was going to float off beyond reach in just a matter of a few minutes. Aurora Lane had never felt such pressure before: his life depended on what she did in the next few moments. \"I'm coming for you, Jim.\" She took off sprinting. She didn't care if he could hear her or not. It was more of a reassurance to herself. Aurora had to save him. If she didn't… No, there wasn't time to think of the alternative. She was going to save him. Aurora's fast footsteps echoed throughout the metallic corridors as she sprinted to the room with the space suits. She was grateful that she spent the time jogging across the ship over the past year. This would be a true test of her strength and endurance. Could she reach Jim in time? She shot through the door like a bullet and went straight for the second suit. Her nervous hands made it difficult to get the contraption on. Aurora cursed at herself as she fumbled with the equipment. This is taking too long, she thought as she donned the gear. Before she even finished strapping it all on, she headed for the air lock. The first set of doors opened with a whirr. She had a sudden moment of Déjà vu, when she had come through here the first time. Jim had been there, and though she was nervous, she could trust him… Could he trust her to save him now? \"I'm coming, Jim,\" she said again into her earpiece. Still no response. Please be alive. She strapped on the rest of the suit as she started the protocol to open the outer doors. The vacuum of space took what little air was in the compartment in a heartbeat. The doors moved much too slow for her. Aurora wished she could be that air and just get out into space. Before the doors were completely open, she was through. In chaos of racing thoughts, she remembered to double check her lifeline to make sure she was attached to the ship. After one pull, she was satisfied that she was safe. Scanning the debris, and with the help of her helmet's computer system, she was able to lock in on Jim's location. He was several meters directly in front of her. Aurora released her mag boots and went sailing out into space. \"I'm here, Jim!\" she said as the gap between them closed. Aurora knew that his air had to be venting to space, but he still should have had time. She pushed all thoughts of failing away as she sailed closer to Jim, arms outstretched to grab him. Her heart warmed as she approached him, his whole body now in full view. They were close now…she was almost there… Just as she was about to grab him, the lifeline tugged at her suit. Aurora could go no further. She finally had a visual on Jim, and she could see clearly through his helmet. He was alive, but gasping for air. It was no wonder why he did not respond before: all he could do was focus on getting in what little breaths he could. His skin had grown pale from the lack of oxygen. Had he not been shaking from the cold, Aurora would have thought he looked like a corpse. Gathering what strength she had left, Aurora stretched as far as the suit allowed. Her fingertips were within inches of Jim's arm. Yet, it was not enough. The longer she struggled, the further he got from her. In utter despair, Aurora watched as the life was sucked from Jim. Every gasp from him sent shocks of pain to her heart. The man she loved more than anything would be taken from her, and there was nothing she could do about it. Jim's momentum caused him to spin, and she could no longer see his face. He was far beyond her reach now. The only thing she could think to do was to release the lifeline and keep going. As soon as the thought entered her mind, she looked over her suit for the controls. Aurora fumbled with every button and command available, but it was to no avail. It was against safety protocol to release the lifeline. I can cut it. Aurora looked around, searching for any debris from the explosion sharp enough to cut the line. Anything that looked like it would work was out of her reach. There was no hope. Aurora finally accepted her defeat and wept as she watched James Preston vanish out of sight, and out of her life forever.[Chapter 2] The Sorrow Aurora had just stayed there, weeping in the great emptiness of space for some time. Jim had long been out of view and her helmet was screaming with warnings of low oxygen levels. She had ignored the first twenty warnings, caught up in her own helplessness. Before she could even respond to the messages, the lifeline started to tug and pull, wheeling her back towards the ship. Had she still had her full sanity, the tug would have scared her, but she didn't care. She wanted Jim back. She wanted a second chance to try and save him. Aurora was deadweight as the line continued to pull her to safety. Once the ship was back within range, her mag boots automatically reactivated, forcing her back on the platform outside of the airlock. Aurora finally ceded to the computer's will when she had to gasp get a good breath of air. She moved slowly into the airlock and let the doors close behind her. When getting out into space seemed to have taken an eternity, getting back inside took no time at all. The room re-pressurized and the inner doors were open once more before Aurora could even take her helmet off. She stripped out of the bulky suit. Once it was off, she had no goal, no plan, no future. She dropped to the floor. She lay there on the cool, metallic ground and wept more. Her beloved was lost forever and she was now alone on this monstrous ship to die before ever reaching the new world. Aurora thought back to the first moment she woke from hibernation, how after Jim had explained everything to her, her dreams evaporated. The despair seemed unbearable at the time, but this…this was much worse. Not only had she lost her beloved, but her new dream of spending her life with him. Yes, she had been angry with him for lying to her, but he still meant the world to her, and she would have forgiven him eventually. The fact that she risked her life to try and save him just now only proves that. She stayed in that position for what seemed like days, but there was no way of knowing. It took everything in her to find the resolve to finally stand. I need to write, she thought. And with that, she left for her room, grateful for the solitude she now had forever so that she could be alone with her thoughts.[Chapter 3] The Struggle Aurora wrote for days on end, only stopping to use the facilities and to eat sparingly. She wrote about all of her adventures with Jim and how she had felt more alive than ever before when she was with him. She wrote of the tragic moment when she found out that he had sentenced her to death upon this ship. Aurora yearned for that moment yet again: she would rather be angry with Jim alive than…than this. She wrote of how she felt now. Hopeless. Alone. Just as it had done in her youth, writing seemed to keep the darkness at bay. But how long could it last? The thought struck her. Could she survive from writing alone? Aurora put her tablet down. In all her life, what she learned from observing the world was that people – truly happy people – had others in their life that they could rely on. How was she to survive life alone? \"I need to get out of here,\" Aurora said aloud. She shot up out of her chair and headed up to the bar. Arthur the android could talk some sense into her. As she approached the bar, she remembered that Arthur had shut down during the accident. His body was bent over in an odd manner, almost as if he was dead and all that remained was his mangled corpse. Jim would have known how to fix him. Aurora took a look at the android, trying to remember through past conversations with Jim about how it functioned. She gave him a once-over, attempting to limit how much permanent damage she was doing to the robot. Her efforts were to no avail. She could not fix him. The one companion who could hold a civilized conversation with her was broken and she had no way of bringing him back. Aurora fell to the ground, but tears never came. She had cried so much for Jim that she had nothing left. She sat there on the ground in a catatonic state for some time. The reality of her predicament entirely overcame her. Aurora Lane was alone and sentenced to die without any human contact. This was hell. Oh, how she wished the pod had malfunctioned when Jim tried to wake her. How she wished it would have kept her asleep or even killed her then and there. I'm stronger than this, she thought. It's better to have loved Jim and lost him than never have known him at all… She thought it. But did she believe it? Aurora headed back to her room, ready for sleep to take her. That's all she could do. That's all she'll ever be able to do.[Chapter 4] The Contemplation Weeks passed, followed by months. Aurora Lane did her best to stay alive – physically and mentally. There had been moments when she was tempted just to end it all; one time in particular she caught herself at Avalon's pharmacy, looking for anti-depressants. She had found them, large bottle in her hand, and the thought struck out of nowhere. I could take all of these and no one could stop me. I wouldn't even know how to save myself. Aurora, appalled by such a thought, quickly put the bottle back on the shelf. From that day forward, she resigned herself to only using natural methods of relieving depression – exercise and writing. When she wasn't sprinting down the ship end to end, then she was trying her hand at something new – writing fictional stories. She never thought she was creative enough to write fiction. Aurora had always been a fan of the truth and what's going on in the real world. Fiction felt like an escape, or a drug, and she never dared tried it. Until now. The writer started ten stories, then twenty. Eventually, she started over one hundred first chapters, but she could never finish them. Her perfectionist tendencies prevented her from doing so. She would write a character and then second guess if his or her actions were contrary to the personality. At one point she grew so frustrated, she let the tablet fly across the room. It shattered into hundreds of tiny pieces. Fiction was not for her. Aurora set off on a quest for a new tablet. It was a big ship and she was bound to find one eventually. She knew that Jim had one in his room, but she couldn't go there. No, it was far too soon. As she walked down the corridor past the luxury apartments, another thought jumped into her mind. I could wake someone else up. Aurora was just as appalled at this thought as she was about the pills. It made her stop in her tracks in the corridor. She had been so angry with Jim for ruining her life before, how could she begin to think about doing the same to another? They were going to die anyway if we didn't save them. This time, there was no physical bottle to put back on the shelf. She was stuck with the thoughts, and she tried to fight them as they came. It didn't matter if the other passengers were going to die before, they're alive now and they'll make it now. It would be immoral to wake someone else up. Just one person. For company. \"No!\" Aurora screamed as she ran down the hallway, back towards her room. She shut herself in, ran to the bed, and dived in, holding a pillow over her head as if it created a barrier to keep the thoughts at bay. She yearned for sleep to come and silence her thoughts.[Chapter 5] The Fight As soon as she awoke, Aurora's thoughts came back to waking up another human being. Jim did it, and I love him – he's not a bad person, he just fell in love with me. \"But I gave him so much grief about it,\" she said aloud. \"It almost destroyed me. I'll most likely destroy someone else's life.\" It would just be one. And they would have died anyway. \"Regardless, they are alive now.\" I can't survive on my own and I don't have the will to end my life now. There is only one choice. \"NO!\" Aurora shouted to her dark thoughts, \"I will survive. On my own.\" But for how long? She pushed the thoughts away with effort and got out of bed. Aurora thought it best to put herself on a routine. That would be the only way to combat cabin fever. She did as any person on earth would do – went for a run, took a shower, got dressed, and went down for breakfast. After breakfast, she read one of her favorite authors, envious of how fiction came so easily to him. In no time, she was ready for lunch, and then back to reading. More reading, more jogging, dinner, more reading, bed. How many times have I done this? She thought to herself as she lay in bed. How many times will I do this? Her ponderings only opened the door for the other thoughts to return. Having someone else will make life exciting again. She was too tired to argue with the voice in her head. Aurora rolled over and went to sleep.[Chapter 6] The Nostalgia More months passed until finally a year had gone by since Jim had died. \"Only 87 more years 'til we reach Homestead II,\" Aurora said to herself when she realized it was an anniversary. It's time. Day in and day out of doing the same things over and over again, Aurora finally succumbed to visiting Jim's room. She was hoping that a year was sufficient for the wounds to heal. Even if she wasn't over his death, even the pain would be a good distraction from the monotony. She walked down the corridor of the \"slums,\" as she called them when they were describing the ship. It was where the lower-paying customers of Avalon were staying, including Jim. Aurora stood outside the metallic door and took a deep breath. I can do this. Before she could have another thought of hesitation, Aurora swiped her bracelet over the scanner. Jim had added her as a permanent guest in his cabin, so the doors flew open for her, welcoming her into his room. The sight before her made her smirk. Clothes were strewn upon the floor and bed. Jim's tooth brush, toothpaste, hair gel, and shaving cream can were haphazardly placed on his sink. Or rather, near the sink. The toilet lid and seat were up. \"Typical Jim,\" Aurora said. And in an instant, her smirk was gone. She remembered nagging him tremendously about his nasty habits, begging him to clean up after himself. Aurora would do anything to be able to nag at him again. Her heart started to ache, but she pushed forward. She wanted to see the rest of Jim's room. They only knew each other for a year: there was still so much to learn about the man, and she had been robbed of a lifetime with him. She ran her fingers over his clothes on the bed, yearning for the warm body they once adorned. The flashback came like a lightning strike to her mind: Jim was just out of her reach, and she was helpless to save him. These tragic images made Aurora's knees buckle, and she sank to the floor. Her wounds were still wide open, still grieving the loss of her dream. When she gained her composure, she looked up and noticed that the bedside table drawer was cracked open. Aurora had noticed it before, but attributed it to Jim's untidy decorating style. Upon closer inspection revealed that there were books inside the drawer. She opened the drawer up slowly and found manuals for systems all over the ship. The bottom of the stack revealed a manual for the structure and mechanical system of the pods. This is how he knew. Waves of contradictory emotions came over Aurora. Hatred, amusement, awe, sorrow…all of these and more washed over her like a tidal wave. After several minutes, only one clear thought rang through the chaos, crystal clear. This is how I can learn.[Chapter 7] The Temptation Aurora could have sworn she blacked out. She didn't remember going down into the hold where rows and rows of passengers lay, sleeping in their seemingly eternal hibernation. She came-to by her own pod, open wide and deceptively inviting. She had a manual open to a page describing the mechanical trays of each pod and which circuit board did was responsible for each function. Aurora looked around in horror and saw that she had brought Jim's toolbox with her as well. Aurora was teaching herself how to wake someone up. Realizing what she was doing, Aurora stood up quickly and began walking away from the scene. She only made it a few paces when she was overcome with nausea. Stumbling, falling, and now on her knees, Aurora vomited what little food she had that day. \"No, I can't do this!\" she wept. \"I won't do this!\" She collapsed entirely onto the floor, her face nearly missing what once was the contents of her stomach. All she could do was lay there and tremble with fear. Would she give in to temptation? I need someone else. Jim needed me, that's why he woke me up. Now, I need someone. \"I AM NOT A MURDERER!\" she screamed between sobs. Neither was Jim. \"I need someone to talk to…\" Aurora sobbed. \"If only I had Arthur.\" Before she could succumb to the dark thoughts once more, she left the hold, heading back to her room. Just as she had placed the pills back on the shelf to avoid making a poor decision, she made a mental note to avoid that hold, those books, and those tools for as long as she could.[Chapter 8] The Plan More time had passed. Days melted into weeks, and weeks into months. Aurora gave up on keeping a routine to keep her sane. She was long past sane. The writer inside her thought it best to just write down her thoughts, the old-fashioned way. Aurora riffled through her belongings and found a bound journal with blank paper. It had been one of the few paper products left on earth, and she paid a substantial sum to get ahold of it. She had been saving it for her adventures on Homestead II, hoping to journal her experiences in the moment to make them more authentic. After Jim had taken that from her, there was no purpose for the notebook. Until now. Aurora journaled all her thoughts in the notebook, the dark ones and the moral ones alike. She saw the inner arguments she had with herself in action, continuous back and forth upon the paper. She wrote down quotes from famous scholars, philosophers, and even her own father on the pages in the hopes that this would create the illusion that someone was talking some sense into her. What she found was that she was quoting arguments for both sides. And the side for having human companionship had overwhelming support. Aurora read and re-read her notes over again, trying to find a loophole or tell-all solution for both her loneliness and moral dilemma. Is this what Jim went through? She thought. No, Jim was planning to wake a specific person whom he had researched and fell in love with. Aurora just wanted someone, anyone, to keep her company. Aurora flipped through the now full journal to find an empty space to write on. As big as she could fit, she wrote: \"AM I CRAZY?\" With enough logical arguments to state that she should not be alone, Aurora decided that she had to at least consider it as an option. She would play the game and entertain the notion, even if she decided against it later. Perhaps putting a face to the person and reading about them would put a stop to her temptation. The plan was to go down to the hold the next day, pick a person, thoroughly research him or her. She would get to know her…victim.[Chapter 9] The Selection Aurora was disgusted with herself every step of the way. She pushed forward, thinking the disgust was a good sign. There was little chance she would go through with this dark plan, and after researching a potential companion, the chances would be slimmer still. As she walked passed every pod, she had the haunting thought that she was shopping. Her mind went to the books she read about nineteenth century America, where slaves were purchased and then abused for the rest of their lives. Was she selecting a slave right now? Would the person be forever hers to manipulate and control? She shook her head at the thought. Aurora reassured herself that this was only a way to deter her from going through with it. She wasn't \"shopping.\" Each pod held within it a sleeping soul, awaiting a new life beyond this journey. Is this what so many religions and faiths back home were talking about? New life on a different planet? It was poetic thought, and one Aurora had made a mental note to write down later. She couldn't help but feel as though each person she saw had a wonderful story about who they were and why they ended up on Avalon. How could she choose just one? Jim had said that he saw her and fell in love with her immediately. Would she feel the same way about another? Was Jim her one and only soul mate and she was doomed to live without him? Just as she asked the question, she found the perfect person. He was an older gentleman, of a mixed race. It was difficult to tell his origin, but he had tanned skin that looked very smooth. He had to have been in his late forties or fifties. Aurora was drawn in by his peaceful composure and aura of wisdom. She couldn't quite justify why he seemed to be wise, but she knew that he had seen so much in his life on earth. Aurora read the computerized tag on the side of his pod. \"Rev. John Prince.\" He was a religious man. Aurora never believed in any such faiths, even though she was in awe of all religions. They contained beautiful stories about love and creation, but there were far too many for one faith to be exclusive. She put her faith in science and reason, which could be seen and tested. Why had she been drawn to such a person? Perhaps he could answer some of her questions. Perhaps he could bring her peace to her chaotic thoughts. But she didn't know he was religious when she saw him. You're not waking him up. Now the moral voice was strongest in her head. It reminded her once more why she was looking Rev. John Prince now. Aurora pulled up his passenger information on his pod. It was far too extensive to read over quickly. She decided to go up to the dining hall and fetch a chair. Leaving the pods behind, Aurora went back up to the upper floors to find that chair. As she did, she had to pass by Jim's planted tree. Over the course of a year and a half it had grown some more, it's roots pulling apart the floor. Aurora made a mental note to tend to the tree as her next project after she finished convincing herself that she could survive on her own. I have another goal now. The thought brought her joy, for one of the greatest problems with being marooned as the only live passenger on a ship was finding a purpose. It seemed like a lifetime ago that Jim was her purpose and she was his. That made it so much easier to live. Now…now she had a tree. The joy had left as quickly as it had come. Tending to a tree seems so insignificant compared to tending to another soul. Aurora dismissed the thoughts, grabbed a chair, and headed back down to the pods. She found her new friend, John, and sat beside him and read his biography. What she found impressed her.[Chapter 10] The Story Reverend Jonathan Prince was part of one of the last remaining Christian Churches on Earth. He lived a life full of sacrifice and devotion to that Church, tending to the weak, the sick, the orphaned, and the widowed. He wrote in his biography that he made it a point to live as the early Christians did – giving everything he could to helping God's children. Everything he did was beyond what the average good-hearted person did. Instead of running charities, he actually went to the places where people were suffering and offered what resources he had to help. He made clothes for people who had none and he cooked for the people who had no food. His Church supported him whole-heartedly because he did the work that they would gladly pay someone else to do. All he ever did was love others, no matter their circumstance. When it had been announced that new planet capable of sustaining life was found and that it was possible to travel there, Prince was hand selected by the church leaders to go and minister to those who were settling in. Even he was quoted as saying, \"I feel called to reach out to that end of the universe, for we are all God's children and I am His hands and feet.\" Aurora thought it was all very noble, even if she didn't believe in any type of god. It didn't matter the reason, this man was making a difference in the world and was planning to continue his work, even if that meant he would be the only one of his kind in his new home. If anyone was going to understand Aurora's dilemma, it would be this man laying before her. Oh, how she yearned to speak with him right then, asking him why, why she was so lonely and how she could overcome it. But he had work to do. Important work. If she woke him, so many people would miss out on his loving kindness. I could experience his loving kindness if I wake him. \"I can't do this to him,\" Aurora voiced to her own thoughts. \"He has so many wonderful plans for the future.\" But of all the people here, he would have the most sympathy for why I'd have to wake him. \"All the more reason to stop myself from doing it. There is someone more deserving of him elsewhere.\" There will be more religious types over there. What's one less? \"It's murder.\" It's survival.[Chapter 11] The Awakening Aurora left before her thoughts could take over once more. She stormed out of there, leaving John Prince to sleep peacefully. Her plan didn't work. If anything, she was even more tempted to wake this man. If he had died, it would tragic for all those waiting for him on the other side. At the same time, he was at peace with who he was and where he was going after he died, even if it wasn't true. And he had something Aurora didn't – a God that would bring him comfort if necessary. She paced her cabin back and forth all night. Her anxiety made her throw things, pull at her hair, and scream into her pillow. After several hours, she went up to the bar to grab the first bottle of liquor she could find. She downed all of it hoping it would quell the invasive thoughts and simply leave her true thoughts behind. All of it disappeared and she was in a state of catatonia until she passed out on the bar floor. Aurora awoke mid-afternoon the next day with a painful hangover. She found some pain killers in her room and downed them with as much water as she could drink. It was the only remedy for a hangover that ever relieved some of the pain. She stood over her bathroom sink, still gulping down water. The excess liquid found its way down her chin and to her shirt from last night, soaking the fabric all down her front. Aurora got a good glimpse of herself in the mirror: Matted, blonde hair, bloodshot eyes, dark circles, and a look of craze in her expression that would have scared her in her past life. \"I need to wake him,\" she said simply. No arguments came from her mind. With the decision made, Aurora changed her clothes without taking a shower. She had all the time in the world, but for some reason she felt rushed to complete this task. Perhaps it was fear of losing her resolve that pushed her. After all, this was murder… No time to think of that now. She sprinted down to the elevator, which did not move fast enough for her liking. When it finally opened to reveal the pods, she took off once more until she found her old pod. There, she collected the manuals and Jim's old tool box. Aurora brought them to John's pod. Looking upon his peaceful face, Aurora had a moment of hesitation. She was going to change this man's life forever. Aurora looked away, hoping beyond hope that she could do this without thinking about the consequences. The manuals seemed to be written in a different language. Jim had been able to follow them, but he was an engineer. He lived and breathed this information. Aurora had dabbled in engineering, especially when having to research the subject for a project, but it was never this extensive. \"I can do this,\" she said with determination. It would take some time, but she could follow the manual. Aurora found herself walking back and forth between her and John's pod, comparing the trays on the sides of the pods, housing the circuit boards. Jim had put the board back into its place on her pod, so if there was a difference, then it would have been subtle. Only an engineer would know what to look for. For Aurora, it would be like searching for a needle in a haystack, but not knowing what the needle was, just that something different would be there. After hours of analysis, comparison, and study, Aurora decided that the manuals were pointing to remove the second circuit board on the tray. Doing so would trick the computer into sensing that it was time to wake the person from hibernation. Aurora carefully used a set of pliers to grasp the second crystal board from the pod's tray, just as the manual had indicated. As she the tool clamped down on the device, she let out air slowly. No turning back now. She carefully removed it from the tray. Standing up as quickly as she could, Aurora watched John and waited for the sequence to start. From what she could remember about her awakening, the pod moved to a different location for processing. Nothing happened. Minutes passed, and still nothing. She never asked Jim how long it took to process. For all she knew, it could be hours before John woke up. Exhaustion from working all day without sustenance had over-taken her. Despite her feelings, she was desperate to wait for John to wake up. Just when Aurora was about to sit down to rest, John's pod started beeping. The computer screen and lights on the pod all turned red to indicate a warning or error. The computer system flashed \"SYSTEM FAILURE.\" \"NO!\" Aurora screamed. She had pulled the wrong one. She fumbled for the tools once more, replacing the circuit board back to the tray. It was no use: the computer continued to flash red. Suddenly, John woke with a jolt, his eyes wide open. Aurora could only look on in horror as the man looked around, desperate to find the source of his distress. His eyes finally locked with hers, but no words came from his mouth. Instead, he only gasped and writhed in terrible pain. They were like that for what seemed like an eternity to Aurora, but really was just a few seconds. Reverend John Prince, eyes still wide, stopped trembling and moved no more. The computer flashed simple words to indicate what happened. \"PASSENGER DECEASED.\"[Chapter 12] The Regret Aurora fell to her knees before John's empty corpse. She was appalled at what she had done. Not only did she end this man's life early, but she had lost her chance at having a companion on this god-forsaken ship. That didn't even matter now; she was truly a killer. When Jim woke her, at least she still had a future with him. But John… He's gone. Had she'd known this was a possibility, Aurora would have never tried to wake him up. Jim had made it seem so easy… She was a villain now, and had to live with herself and the weight of what she had done for the rest of her life. Alone. Aurora wrapped her arms around the pod, as if her regret and sorrow would somehow bring John back to life. Tears from her eyes streamed onto the glass and made their way down the side of the machine. She stayed until no more tears could fall. It took all her strength to finally leave John's pod behind. Aurora had left, went straight to her room, and begged sleep to come. She was awake all night. Just before dawn, Aurora gave up on her quest for sleep and headed back to the bar to drink her sorrows away. Then, and only then was she able to sleep. The following months were difficult for Aurora. Thoughts came back about just ending everything. During her jogs, she found herself veering more and more towards the pharmacy for those pills. One day she finally made it through the pharmacy doors. She was able to stop and turn around, but thoughts of John's short life flashed in her mind. You have nothing to live for. \"I…have to take care of the tree…\" It was a simple argument, but enough to keep her going. Not having the will to end her life, nor having the strength to keep living, Aurora found herself praying to any and every god to just end her life. She begged for painless death in her sleep, and later asked for a painful, slow death like she deserved. No god heard her plea. Writing no longer sufficed to keep her mind from chaos. Voicing her confusion and grief, even to a sheet of paper, gave them more strength. They were impossible to vanquish. Jogging was a good distraction. And the tree that Jim had planted…it became her child. She nurtured it and cared for it as a way of making penance for her sin. Logically she knew that caring for a tree did not make up for taking a human life, but she took care of it all the same. Another year had gone by after John's death, and Aurora still felt heavy regret for what she had done.[Chapter 13] The Tipping Point Aurora lost track of time. All she knew was that she ate, slept, jogged, and took care of that tree. She found herself talking to it most days, confessing her shortcomings, but also justifying that anyone in her position would have done the same. \"Jim woke me up knowing there was a risk?\" she found herself asking the tree one day, \"right?\" She was sitting on the white floor next to it, her knees pulled into her chest and her arms wrapped around her legs, like she was a small child confiding in an imaginary friend. The tree did not respond. \"Maybe he was so sure he knew what he was doing that accidentally killing me was not a possible scenario.\" Aurora looked intently at the tree. \"There was still a risk, though.\" The tree still said nothing. \"What do you know?\" Aurora said, turning away, \"You're just a tree.\" I need to wake someone else up. \"No, no, no, no…I tried that, and it ended terribly.\" Aurora stood up and took a few paces forward. \"No more attempts. I have the tree to keep me company.\" There were five boards I could have pulled and I just pulled one. There are 4,997 other passengers aboard this ship. I only need four more. \"NO!\" She screamed, now pulling at her hair. \"No, that's murder. I'd be serial killer!\" Can I really survive talking to a tree for the rest of my life? \"Maybe not, but I have to try...\" With that, Aurora left the tree and headed for the bar. The alcohol was almost gone. What was meant to serve 5,000 passengers in four months was gone in four plus years of her being awake. Yes, Jim had his fill, but Aurora should have felt shame for how much she had consumed. She felt none. The only remorse she had was not forgiving Jim sooner and taking the life of an innocent man. All her other shortcomings were microscopic in comparison. Aurora started a whole bottle of whiskey, not bothering to grab a glass. She looked out the window into space as she took her first gulps. The void was infinite, ready to be explored by anyone who dared. It had a mysterious beauty about it that writers greater than her would try to put into words. Nothing could capture both the greatness and fear of space. And yet, here Aurora stood, confined to this ship for the rest of her life, unable to explore the vast depths of space. After the whiskey was half gone, Aurora finally broke down and confessed the truth to herself and to any supernatural being that would listen. \"I can't live with myself. I can't kill myself. I…need someone else.\"[Chapter 14] The Desperation Aurora wondered if Jim would be doing this had he killed her on the first round. Would he be planning to put four more people in jeopardy just to find one? Would he give up after her, horrified by the fact that he killed a person for the sake of his own well-being? She didn't know, and a part of her didn't want to know. She had the manuals sprawled across the floor and the tool box within reach as she gazed upon a group of unsuspecting passengers. Aurora had picked them by chance alone; the reason she grieved for John Prince for so long was because she got to know him before waking him. If she could just imagine that these people weren't...weren't people at all, it would make it easier. Easier to kill them. Aurora shook her head, trying to dispel the thought from her mind. Without further hesitation, she started on the first pod. It housed a woman in her late thirties. Aurora picked a row from the lower-class sections, planning to move to the next pod over if this one did not work. The logic was that the lower-class people would not cost the ship much and if these pods were all together, the crew may think that there was a malfunction with the section. She knew the logic was warped, but she was beyond that now. She crossed the line when she found herself premeditating the murder of four individuals. \"I have to make this one count,\" she said aloud, convincing herself that she had no choice left but to wake up another human being. She grabbed the pliers and opened the tray to the pod. After she reviewed the manuals for some time, she determined that it was the third board she had to pull. Aurora grabbed the third circuit board on the tray with the pliers and gave one last glance to the woman sleeping peacefully. \"I'm sorry,\" she said aloud. She pulled the board and waited. It was the same as before: red lights, a sudden gasp from the woman, a look of horror, and then death. \"PASSENGER DECEASED\" flashed from the pod's computer. The lack of remorse for this woman's life scared Aurora, but only for a moment. Her humanity was long gone, and her desperate search for another human being was part of the quest to gain it back. \"Let's try again,\" she said to no one in particular. She pulled the first tray on the next pod: Same result. Aurora pulled the fourth tray on the pod after that: Same result. \"One try left,\" Aurora told herself. A small part of her wanted to stop. She had now killed four people and was about to kill someone else. But the yearning for human companionship took over. She needed this last one to work. She came upon the pod and inside slept a man who resembled Jim. He was tall and muscular. Aurora found him attractive. She took it as a good sign. \"This has to work,\" she said as she opened the tray. She carefully placed the pliers on the fifth and final board and pulled it out. Aurora's heart sank as the pod lit up with red. She didn't even stay to watch the man die. With a loud 'clank' the pliers hit floor. Aurora left for the bar to grab a drink.[Chapter 15] The Epiphany Aurora had more inner turmoil after that day than she ever had before in her life. A part of her thought it was necessary to at least try, but now she should stop. Another part egged her to keep on going. She would never reach all 5,000 passengers in her lifetime, so might as well keep trying. Finally, a small part of her was horrified by what she had done. Who had she become? A serial killer who had no remorse for the lives that she had taken? After she had finished all but a few bottles at the bar, Aurora had passed out. When she awoke the next morning, she didn't bother to get cleaned up or even go back to her room. Instead, she found herself in the dining hall talking to the tree. \"I don't even know who I am anymore,\" she said to it. \"When I left Earth, I was full of adventure, ready to seek out the new world. And then Jim woke me up, and he showed me so much of myself that I didn't even know. And now he's gone…\" The tree said nothing. \"I can't be here by myself. I need companionship. Anyone could understand that.\" She found her mind wandering to Gus, wondering what he would think of her actions. As far as she could tell, he was a good man. Would he understand her motives? Would he have done the same thing, since he was part of a crew and was held to a different standard? \"That's it!\" Aurora said to the tree. \"I have something that Jim didn't. I have access to the crew! They must be easier to wake up.\" Without further thought or discussion, Aurora leapt up and ran straight for the crew deck where Gus had been sleeping several years prior. The doors had never closed since they had gone there the few years ago when the ship was in peril. Scorch marks were a décor of the door frame from when Jim had tried to force his way in. Aurora ran over to the first pod she saw. It was the Executive Officer, Martin Craig. He was sleeping peacefully, unaware of the horrors committed on the ship. Aurora found the pod's computer and searched everything and anything for a sequence to wake him up. Finally, she came across the right command to start the process. All she needed was an identification code. She remembered Gus's code from before, and she prided herself now on remembering it once more. Aurora gave the code to the computer and gleefully awaited her new best friend.[Chapter 16] The Deception Martin Craig awoke slowly and with some aches and pains. It took him several minutes to remember what was happening. He was given and assignment on board the ship…the big ship…the Avalon, traveling to Homestead II. It was a 120-year journey. Have I really been out that long? Craig laughed to himself as he opened his eyes. The lights were much too bright and painful. He closed them once more and then cracked them open enough to get used to the florescent bulbs. His pod opened when it sensed that he was aware, and he sat up. The computer told him to wait as it gave him a medical sweep. Craig was more than happy to comply. He was given his final injections and his IVs were removed by robotic arms that seemed to have appeared from nowhere. Craig finally had full feeling in his extremities and was excited to swing his legs over the side of the pod to stand up. \"Hello.\" Craig hadn't noticed the observer in the room, standing about ten feet back. She looked horrible – she had mangled hair and dark circles under her eyes. It was like a drunkard had somehow made her way upon the ship. Craig knew he wouldn't have been the first crew member awake, but he didn't recognize her at all. \"Who are you?\" he asked her, standing up. His legs were weaker than expected so he had to steady himself against the wall. \"I'm one of the passengers,\" she said. \"Aurora Lane.\" \"The writer?\" Craig asked her. \"Yes,\" she said. He found it strange that she was so gleeful. \"Regardless of your social status, you're still just a passenger here. This area is restricted.\" When he had finished his statement, he remembered more about his instructions upon the ship. \"You shouldn't even be awake anyway,\" he added, \"The crew is supposed to wake up first.\" \"There's a story behind that,\" she said. Craig was finally able to steady himself and push off the wall. He looked around the room and saw that his comrades were still in their pods, asleep. \"What story is that?\" Craig said, now demanding. \"You better explain what is going on here.\" Aurora launched into the long story about how James Preston, the mechanic, woke up long before it was time. She left out the part where he woke her, simply stating that she woke up too. About a year after that, Gus Mancuso woke up and it was all because of a meteor storm that almost took out the whole ship. The three of them worked together to neutralize the threat, but Jim and Gus had died in the process. She was the only survivor. \"Why am I awake now?\" Craig said after Aurora had finished. \"I don't know,\" the woman said, \"It could be a residual effect from the storm.\" Craig couldn't help but feel like she was hiding something. \"How did you know to find me?\" he asked, suspicious. \"This is the route I take when I take my morning jogs,\" she said quickly, \"As you can see, I wasn't in the mood for jogging, but I still needed to at least walk off this hangover. I was walking by the room when I heard the pod start to beep. I was concerned so I came running.\" \"Uh-huh,\" Craig said, still weary of her. \"And how much time now until we reach Homestead II?\" \"I don't know,\" Aurora said honestly. \"I stopped counting.\" Craig turned and walked towards one of the computers in the middle of the room. He typed in his inquiry and the computer revealed that they still had 84 years more to go. \"So you've been awake for five years?\" he asked her. \"Yes,\" she responded. \"It's been kind of lonely the past three of them.\" \"No kidding,\" Craig said. \"Well, I thank you for the information. If you don't mind, I'm going to do a diagnostic analysis of the ship and find out exactly why I woke up early. I don't want this to happen to the other crew or passengers.\" He felt sorry for the girl, but he wasn't going to talk to her anymore until her story checked out. It was his duty to put the safety of the other passengers first. \"Would you like some help?\" Aurora asked. \"That won't be necessary,\" Craig said with a smirk. \"You look like you need some rest anyway.\" Aurora continued to protest, but the Executive Officer practically pushed her out the door. He had to find some more answers.[Chapter 17] The Revelation Aurora was kicking herself as she made her way back down to the passenger pods. How could she be so stupid? Waking up a crew member without a plan? Was she that desperate for human contact? Yes, she was desperate enough to kill five people in the process. Aurora's only thoughts were on cleaning up her mess before Craig could find it. She sprinted towards the elevator, a contraption that was still much too slow. She was out the doors before they were fully open, sprinting towards the manuals and the tool box. She quickly gathered them up in her arms. Before Aurora could walk away, she noticed she had left the trays on all the pods open. She cursed at herself, dropped the books and the tools, and made her way to each individual pod, making sure the circuit boards were replaced and the trays were sealed. Only a close inspection would reveal that they had been removed. How long could she keep Martin Craig in the dark? She finally finished and grabbed her pile once more as she headed back towards the elevator. When she was ten feet away, the doors opened. Inside the car stood Craig, a gun pointed at her. Aurora dropped her cargo once more and raised her arms without hesitation. \"You know, your story didn't sit right with me,\" he said right away, stepping off the elevator. \"What do you mean?\" Aurora asked, trying to look innocent. For every step forward that Craig took, she took one step back. \"No one ever wakes up on these journeys. I mean, who am I to say that a meteor shower can't mess that up? But still, it would be rare. One person waking up would be an anomaly. But three?\" Craig started to circle her. \"I told you the truth,\" Aurora said, trying to sound appalled that he didn't believe her. \"Maybe, but what did you leave out?\" Craig said. He pointed his gun down at the books and the tool box and then back at her. \"What do you have there?\" \"They were Jim's,\" Aurora said. \"We had left them down here and I wanted to clean them up for you. I forgot about them.\" \"Right…\" Craig said. \"That looks like the manuals for the pods. Which is funny, 'cause after you left I watched your movements on camera and tracked you here. Out of curiosity, I looked up how many pods had been disturbed, and there were five more pods listed than what your story would account for.\" \"FINE!\" Aurora screamed. Craig was surprised by the outburst and jumped back. \"I killed them! I tried to wake them up, but I didn't know how! They all died.\" She fell to her knees and started to weep. \"I…killed…them…\" Having to defend herself to another human being had brought Aurora back to her original self. She was mortified at what she had done. Had loneliness really driven her this mad? \"Jim woke me up,\" she said to the Officer, who looked as if he was in shock. \"His pod opened first…I didn't lie about that. But he saw me, fell in love, and woke me up. I didn't find out until later, and I gave him hell for it.\" Aurora looked directly at Craig, \"He had killed me! Jim murdered me first!\" She sobbed at the statement, remembering her angst upon realizing what Jim had done. \"I…I…\" she stammered, \"I forgave him, but it was too late. He was already gone. And I had nobody.\" Without a word, Craig circled around her and walked down the rows of pods until he found the five that she had tampered with. A grimace upon his face revealed that he was disgusted by her actions. He came sprinting back towards her and held the gun at her once more. The barrel was mere inches from her face. \"You're a serial killer. You really think your emotional well-being is more valuable than a person's life? Than six lives? Do you realize that you've killed me as well?!\" \"I just wanted someone else,\" she said between sobs. \"I didn't mean to hurt them! I didn't mean to hurt you!\" She looked at Craig now, angry that he gave her no empathy. \"I dare you to try and survive on your own on this ship!\" Before Craig could respond, Aurora grabbed his gun-wielding hand, placing her finger over his trigger finger and pulled. Aurora Lane was no more.[Chapter 18] The Clean-Up Martin Craig was breathing heavily, but was frozen to that spot. He wasn't sure what to do with himself. Here he stood, over the body of a desperate psychopath, her blood had sprayed in all different directions, making Craig think about a morbid Pollock painting. The realization that he had to explain the death of eight people came over him, making his heart beat faster. When he finally got control of his fear, he decided the best thing to do was look into this crazy woman's story and find out the truth. She had changed it between the time when he woke up and his confrontation of her, he wasn't sure what was true. He spent the next few weeks going through the ship and looking for evidence. Once he found that she was mostly telling the truth, he wrote a report with the whole incident and saved it to the ship's computer. He wanted to make sure someone knew what really happened. Craig also had to clean up the mess. He disposed of the dead bodies and sent them out into space. The pods no longer recognized them as living, so they would not preserve their bodies. The Reverend had been dead for a while, which was evident when Craig opened the pod. An overwhelming stench of rot overtook his nostrils, and the Executive Officer had to vomit. He made a point to clean up the messes left by the passengers in the luxury suite, the bar, and finally the tree in the dining hall. Craig found the axe out of James Preston's tool box and swung at the plant until it fell. When Martin Craig was satisfied that the ship was presentable once again, he went to the infirmary and found the medical pod in the center of the room. He set the computer to make him sleep another 84 years. He would have a lot of explaining to do to his superior officers, but for now, he could rest. Author's Note: Thank you to everyone who read this entire work. I watched the movie and found that I was angry that it ended so easily. Aurora forgave Jim, but I never got the sense that she understood why he did what he did. I know this is much more depressing than the actual movie, but I wanted something with more impact. Let me know what you think. Thanks again. ","Summary":" The Loss Aurora tried the to call Jim again over the radio. \"Jim,\" She called, half crying, half "},{"Movie":"Prince & Me","Title":"Prince and Me (Fanfiction) Part 1","Author":"Cara223","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9442920","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Prince and Me (Fanfiction) Chapter 1 The plane wheels screeched to a stop after a 24 hours flight from Wisconsin to Denmark. I looked out the window and took a deep breath. I couldn't believe that I was back in Denmark. My stomach churned and flopped inside of me, and a moment of panic swept over me. What if I had made the wrong decision? What if my initial instincts were right the first time? If Eddie and I called off the marriage a few months ago and our relationship didn't work out- why were we thinking that things would work this time? After Eddie had showed up surprisingly at my graduation, we had agreed to give our relationship another try. Him coming to my graduation was the best gift anyone could have brought. I loved him very much. Eddie invited me to spend half of the summer with him in Denmark and the other half at my house with him. We decided to take things slow and see where they go. We weren't going to jump into a relationship after what had happened last time we did that. I began to gather my stuff and exit the plane. I could feel some stares on me as I stood up. Many people still recognized me from the past few months from when Eddie and I were engaged. We were all over the news, TV, and magazines. This also happened once again when the wedding was called off and I went back home to continue my education. I was sure they were wondering why I was here and it was only a matter of time before rumors started circulating all over Denmark. I went through the tunnel that connected the plane to the airport with my one carry-on bag. All of my anxiety and worries seemed silly when I saw Eddie, surrounded by a bunch of security, who was smiling and looking at me as though I was the only person in the world. I returned the big, warm smile and went running to him. I lept up into his arms and we kissed. He put me down and smiled. \"I missed you,\" he whispered into my ear, taking my hand. \"I missed you too,\" I said staring into his deep, blue eyes. We left the airport, hand in hand, knowing that our kiss would be on every newspaper in Denmark tomorrow morning. But it didn't bother either of us. We were just happy to be together again. Chapter 2: \"Do I need to close the back window?\" Soren, our driver and good friend of the royal family asked, looking into the rear-view mirror. Eddie and I parted out lips and I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand and moving slightly closer to my side of the car, although Eddie took my hand and squeezed it. \"Sorry Soren,\" I said laughing. \"Oh no, it's fine. No one can see into the car. I was just wondering if you guys wanted complete privacy.\" \"No, it's okay. We will be arriving at the castle soon,\" Eddie said. I scooted closer to Eddie and rested my head on his shoulder. He put his arm around me and kissed the top of my head. I couldn't believe that I had doubted our relationship once before or that I was nervous a few minutes ago. He was the perfect man for me. \"Remember that you have the entire summer together love birds,\" Soren said glancing into the rear-view mirror once again only to see me and Eddie kissing- again. I laughed again and we broke apart. I rested my head on his shoulder for the rest of the car ride. \"I was wondering if you wanted to grab dinner tonight with me. Just you and me,\" he whispered into my ear. I looked up into his eyes and nodded eagerly. Chapter 3: Tonight was really just going to be myself and Eddie. No bodyguards, no drivers, nothing. Just Eddie and myself for the whole evening. I couldn't wait. Even though he had just seen me early today in jeans and a plain orange shirt and still thought I was beautiful; I really wanted to \"wow\" him tonight. \"Ugh,\" I thought to myself as I was going through the clothes that I had packed. \"Didn't I pack anything that was kind of sexy?\" I threw another shirt onto my bed and sighed in frustration. Eddie told me that the place he was taking me to was nice and to dress-up (he refused to give me the name because he said it was a surprise). Then, I finally found what I was looking for. It was a deep red dress that I would usually wear to holiday dinners or for special functions. The dress flowed slightly below my knee and had a slip that came up about three inches above my knee. It wasn't low-cut, but it showed a tiny bit of cleavage, but the dress was fitting to my figure. I tried it on and looked into the mirror. This was the one. I curled the sides of my short hair to help frame my face and I put on more make-up than I did earlier this afternoon. Not over-dramatic, but some liquid foundation, blush, eye shadow (which I almost never wear in addition to eye liner which I also wore that night), mascara, and I painted my nails and toe-nails. I grabbed my clutch purse and took one last look into the mirror. I didn't think that Eddie had ever seen me this dressed up before besides his Coronation Ball, (which wasn't the best night in either of our memories), but I knew that tonight would be much better. I heard a slight knock on the door and I knew that Edvard was ready for me. Chapter 4: \"Just one minute,\" I said. I quickly put on my high heeled shoes and after taking one last look in the mirror, I went to go answer the door. \"Hi,\" I said giving Eddie a big smile. I saw his face lighten up with slight surprise and he leaned forward to kiss me. \"You look beautiful,\" He said taking my hand, smiling. I smiled back at him and said: \"You're looking pretty handsome yourself, except for your red lipstick,\" I said teasingly, wiping the lipstick that had gotten on his lips from kissing me off. He laughed and kissed my cheek. \"Let me know when the lipstick dries and I can kiss you on the lips again,\" he said laughing. I looked up at him and my heart almost stopped at the way he was looking at me- so kind and loving. He had a smile to die for. For tonight, he had slicked back his short blonde hair which, for some reason, brought out his deep blue eyes. He was wearing a tuxedo with a black bow-tie. We held hands as we walked down the staircase together and out the door. As we approached the car, the opened the door for me, closed it, and then walked over to the driver's side. \"Will you tell me where we are going now?\" I asked teasingly. \"No, I will not. And luckly you do not know Denmark to well to figure it out based on the direction we are going,\" he said laughing. \"You are so bad,\" I said laughing as well. He started and car and we took off. Chapter 5: Even though after graduation where Eddie showed up surprisingly and we kissed and made up (literally), we had been keeping in touch as much as we could as we waited for me to come to Denmark. We texted each other (I loved it when he would text me \"good morning,\" we would call each other every once in a while, but since Eddie was the King of Denmark, it was hard to always catch him. He even would send me e-mails, saying how much he had missed me and how glad he is that we will try to work things out. But, we had also gone a few months without having any contact with each other. An occasional e-mail every once in a while, but it really hurt to write to him sometimes and I believed he felt the same way. But even after all of our contact in the past two to three weeks or so, it still felt slightly awkward being with him after everything that had happened. I was sure that he had a million questions going through his head, such as, why did you really leave me? And why did you agree to come back? Did I do something wrong? I needed to talk about it, and I was sure that he needed to as well. \"Ask me anything that you want,\" I said after we had driven for a few minutes in silence. however; it felt like an eternity. Eddie hesitated for a second. \"Anything?\" he asked. \"Even about...,\" he began to trail off. \"Yes please. I think we need to talk about it for both of us to move on,\" I said. My heart began to pick up a slight pace. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. \"Well, I never quite understood why you left me so quickly after we were engaged and...\" he trailed off again. \"Was it something that I did Paige?\" Ouch, I knew that question was coming. \"Eddie, I want you to know that you didn't do anything wrong. I left because I was scared more than anything. I was beginning to realize everything that I would have to do as Queen one day, I still wanted to go to medical school, and everything had just happened so fast. I became overwhelmed and very frightened. I knew I should have confided in you, but then the fear came into play again. I was afraid of disappointing you or letting you down at that moment or in the future. I felt as though it would be best for you if you took a bride of royal blood who already knew how to run a country.\" \"Why the evening of my coronation?\" he asked his eyes on the road. \"That's when everything became so real to me. It really hit me that evening that I would be the queen one day alongside you and it terrified me. It just terrified me. I panicked and at the time, I thought it would be the best thing for you and for Denmark.\" Eddie didn't say anything. \"Eddie, I am so sorry that I hurt you. That was never my intention. I was dying inside too. Do you know how many times I tried to pick up the phone and call you or how many e-mails or letters I started to write to you? Not having you in my life, was like having an empty hole in my heart. When you came to the graduation, it was the best present anyone could have given me.\" Eddie was still silent. \"Could you please say something?\" I asked. \"If you're still mad at me, I understand but-\" \"I'm not mad at you Paige,\" Eddie said cutting me off. \"I just can't believe I didn't see it. I can't believe I didn't see how scared you were. You are such a strong girl and you seemed to handling everything well-\" \"It was an act Eddie,\" I said cutting him off. \"I was so terrified and I fled. I am so sorry about all of the pain I have caused you.\" \"What made you decide to agree to come back?\" He asked me. \"Not having you in my life made a part of me inside die. I know that sounds really corny and very Shakespeary, but it's true. And after graduation, I had decided to e-mail you. I was going to do it that night and prayed that you would respond.\" \"Really?\" \"Yes, I still have the e-mail saved in my drafts if you want to read it, along with about one million others. Writing to you trying to get the courage to send them to you, helped me cope. But I never healed.\" \"Paige,\" he said tearing up. \"These past few months, I have been beating myself up because I felt as though I had failed you in some way. And I had,\" he had a few tears streaming down his face now, \"I never realized how afraid you were, and as your future husband at the time, I should have...\" \"No, Eddie, please. Don't beat yourself up. I hid it so well because I didn't want you to know,\" I began to tear up as well. \"Your father was dying at the time, and I couldn't do that to you. I couldn't place even more worry into your head. I couldn't bring myself to tell you how scared I was. I stayed strong for you, but I ended up just scaring myself away.\" \"That's the thing Paige. I should have realized what you were going through. I mean, this was such a big different lifestyle for you. I should have been more alert to your feelings...\" \"Eddie, what happened was not your fault at all. I never allowed my feelings to be heard and I never opened up to you...and you had a lot going on at the time. Your father...coronation was coming up...\" \"It doesn't matter Paige. I should have been aware that you were probably hiding your feelings...I just...Paige, please forgive me.\" \"There's nothing to forgive Eddie,\" I said with a few tears streaming down my face. \"Please, just forgive me for not being sensitive to your feelings.\" \"I forgive you,\" I said patting his hand. \"Do you forgive me for running out on you with hardly giving you any explanation?\" \"Yes, I forgive you,\" he said taking my hand and squeezing it. \"I want us to promise each other something,\" Eddie said. \"I want us to promise each other that we will be 100% open with each other. We will tell each other everything, and we will always have time for each other. There will be constant communication between us and we will share our feelings with each other. I promise this to you, Paige Morgan.\" \"I promise that to you as well,\" I said. At the next red light, he put the car in park quickly and leaned forward and kissed me passionately. I knew then, that everything would be okay between us. Chapter 6: After what seemed like a long car ride (and after a slightly uncomfortable conversation...okay maybe really uncomfortable) Eddie had finally pulled into the restaurant. It was (of course) one of the nicest restaurants in town. The seating was both inside and outside, although many people tried to sit outside for three reasons. One, the restaurant was right a beautiful garden. Two, it was also by a beautiful lake. Three, it was usually pretty nice outside in Copenhagen. Eddie parked the car and looked at me seriously. \"I love you Paige Morgan,\" he said. \"I love you too Eddie Williams,\" I said staring into his deep blue eyes. He leaned forward and kissed me. It was a soft kiss with a lot of energy and emotion put into it. It sent a shiver down my body and made the hair on my arms stand up (not literally, but you understand what I am trying to say here.) I kissed him back with the same force and emotion. \"Okay,\" he said slowly breaking apart, \"we better go inside and get a table,\" but he leaned forward again and gave me a quick kiss on the lips. I smiled and started to get out of the car but Eddie stopped me. \"Isn't this supposed to be a date? I need to open the door for you,\" he said closing the driver's door. I smiled and laughed and quickly put on my sweater. Eddie opened the door for me and held out his hand, smiling. I smiled back and took it. We were on the outskirts of Copenhagen slightly, so I don't think we were too much recognized. Apparently we look different in person than on TV or in newspapers or magazines. But I could still feel some people's eyes on us, although no one had the nerve to come over to us. I was kind of relieved. The last thing I needed tonight after our serious conversation would be one-hundred people coming up and wanting their picture taken with us. Eddie could sense my tension when people would stare at us and he would either squeeze my hand or pat my back for encouragement. After waiting about twenty minutes, we were seated outside at a table for two in a corner spot with a beautiful view of both the garden and the lake. Eddie apparently had reserved this table the second he found out I was coming to Denmark, I later found out. \"Do you like it?\" Eddie asked. \"I love it,\" I said. \"It's just beautiful.\" A few minutes later, we placed our orders. Once the waiter left, Eddie took my hand and looked into my eyes. \"Paige, this night is very special and I hope it's one that we can always remember. And I am not just saying that because it is your first night here, but because there is something else I want to promise you. I know before you had said that we had gone too fast, and I understand that. I want you to know that I will always be here for you. You take as much time as you need. But tonight, I want to promise you that I will be the best boyfriend that I can be for you. I will always be here to listen to you, to watch you, to catch you when you fall and to help you back up. I promise to take things slow and to always have time for you- no matter what is going on. I promise to love you and cheerish you. I will never take you for granted.\" \"Oh Eddie, that was just beautiful,\" I said staring into his blue eyes. And as a remembrance of these promises, I would like you to have this,\" he said handing me a box. I opened it only to see a beautiful saphire ring, with tiny diamonds around the gem. I gasped and looked at Eddie. \"This is my promise ring to you,\" he said taking the ring out of the box and sliding it onto my wedding ring finger on my left hand. \"Don't panic, it's not an engagement ring. Just a promise ring, for everything that I promised you.\" \"Eddie, it's beautiful. I love it. Thank you so much. I am just speechless. I don't know what to say! I am just so happy. I have missed you so much and-\" Eddie leaned forward and quickly kissed me. \"It's okay. I can feel your excitement and happiness,\" he said. Our food arrived after about half an hour and Eddie and I had the best conversation that (I think) we ever had as a couple. We were laughing and having a great time. Also, we were back on our love \"high\" from being apart from each other for so long. I had a very good feeling about our relationship. Chapter 7: We left the restaurant hand in hand and walked slowly to the car. \"I had a great night,\" I said as we swung our hands together as we walked. Eddie almost seemed as though he blushed and he looked down at the ground. \"I'm glad to hear that Paige. I had a really good night as well. It will defiantly be a night to remember.\" \"Yes,\" I said smiling. I could feel some of the tension between us as we approached the car. Who knew what conversation would await us in the car on the trip back to the palace. Eddie opened the door for me and then walked to the driver's side of the door. Dinner actually went really well, and we were able to talk to each other comfortably but the car brought back our conversation. I decided to break the ice. \"Eddie,\" I said as he started the engine. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Let's allow tonight...to be a new start for the both of us. The past will always be something we will remember, but I promise to never let it hold me back...us back from moving on in our relationship.\" \"Yes, yes,\" he said beginning to back out. \"I agree.\" I could feel the un-comfortableness from the previous conversation to demolish as we started our journey home. We were able to laugh together and were completely able communicate freely with each other as we were during diner. Once we got back to the palace, we were talking and laughing. Eddie took my hand and walked me to my room. \"I had a great time tonight,\" I said leaning up against my door. \"Same here,\" he said kissing me. \"Now, I have a meeting with Congress tomorrow pretty much all day, but I will make time for you,\" he said kissing me again. \"Good-night Paige,\" he said kissing my hand. \"Good-night Eddie,\" I said smiling at him and then leaned forward to kiss on the lips. \"I love you.\" \"Love you too, Paige.\" He let go of my hand and slowly began to walk away. \"I'll see you tomorrow,\" he said turning to look at me. \"See you soon,\" I said. I walked into my room, exhausted and happy. It had truly been a great night. I kicked off my high-heels and collapsed on my bed. I would take a shower later. I lay down on my bed completely in love with Edvard Williams. Chapter 8: I woke up the next morning with the sun pouring into my room. I groaned and rolled over on my other side. I glanced at the clock and saw 11:30 and practically jumped out of my bed. Did I really just sleep till 11:30? No one came in to wake me up? Did I not have a schedule for today? Obviously not. I sighed in relief and put my head back down on the pillow. It was such a relief not to have a scheduled today. The royal schedules are to the hour. It was crazy! I smiled and closed by eyes and tried to go back to sleep but my ring sparkling in the sunlight distracted me. It was so beautiful and it was so sweet of Eddie to remember last night. He was really trying- he really wanted this relationship to work out. Although what had happened wasn't his fault. It was my choice. He couldn't have held me captive at the palace. I felt a stab of guilt and pain every time I thought about how much I had hurt him. Although, I was hurting as much (if not more) as he was. But it didn't matter who had hurt the most, because we were going to put the past behind us and not let it hold us back from moving forward in our relationship. I was just about to get out of bed when I heard a slight knock on my door. \"Come in,\" I said. \"Hey,\" Eddie said opening the door slightly and coming in. He walked over to my bed and sat down. \"We took a quick lunch break from the Congress and I was wondering if you wanted to come with me and the boys and grab lunch. But I tried looking for you, but I couldn't find you,\" he said laughing. \"Did you just wake up?\" \"Yes,\" I said laughing. He leaned forward and kissed me. \"Well, you can either get ready very quickly, or I can ask for someone to bring lunch up here and we can eat together,\" he said stroking my hand. \"I could get ready very quickly if that's what you want...\" \"How about,\" he said kissing me, \"we eat here together for lunch and you come with me and the boys for dinner. That way, we can have some time alone, and then I can let some members of Congress get to know you later.\" \"I like that,\" I said smiling. Eddie called and asked for someone to bring a lunch for two people up to my room. I ate in bed- literally and still in my pajamas. Eddie sat on top of the bed and ate right next to me. Occasionally he would rub my leg or my hand which made me feel loved by him. He didn't do it in a sensual way, but in a sweet way. \"I was thinking, would you like to watch a movie sometime this week? Just me and you and we could pop some popcorn or eat whatever you would like,\" Eddie asked. \"I'd like that a lot,\" I said taking his hand. \"So it's a date. The first night that Congress is off, I promise you a movie night.\" \"That sounds great.\" Eddie looked at his watch and his eyes bugged out. \"Has an hour really gone by already? I need to get back to Congress. But, I will come pick you up at six for dinner with the boys. If something changes, I will text you and let you know. It's a nice restaurant, but not as nice as last night. A skirt and a blouse would be fine.\" He gave me a kiss on the forehead. \"I'll see you at six,\" he said leaving. I quickly finished my lunch (we spent most of the time talking, while Eddie tried to eat quickly. Correction- I did most of the talking while Eddie ate). I then finally got up, took a quick shower, and left my room ready to face...my ex future in-laws. Chapter 9: I left my room quietly and closed the door behind me. I really didn't know what to do with myself. In order to kill some time, I decided to explore the palace a little bit. The portraits on the walls dated back to the early 1500's. It was amazing that Eddie could see his Great (I am not sure how many Greats) grandfather or grandmother anytime he wanted. He knew their names, how many children they had, and a brief history on all of them. It was amazing. I stared at one portrait for quite some time because the man in it looked like Eddie. He had a similar facial bone structure and hair color. This portrait made me think. When Eddie would be up here one day- who would be the woman beside him. Would it be me? Panic began to rush over me as I thought of myself on this wall one day, but then I found extreme comfort in knowing that if I was up on the wall one day, it meant that I had married Edvard. And that fact brought extreme comfort to me. My thoughts were interrupted by Queen Rosalind (Eddie's mother) who had just seen me in the hallway. She called my name and being lost in thought, I practically jumped. \"Paige,\" she said bluntly walking over to me with a poker face. \"Rosalind,\" I said trying to sound excited. I even gave her a smile, but it wasn't returned. The truth was- we didn't exactly get along at first. She pretty much hated me when Eddie first brought me here. Then after sometime, we bonded and really started to get along. By the tone of her voice, I was pretty sure she hated me again. \"Fancy running into you here,\" she said coldly. \"Please come follow me into a room. I would like to talk to you privately,\" she said turning her back and walking away. \"Okay,\" I said and began to follow her. Uh oh, I thought. Here it comes. I knew this conversation would be coming. My heart began to pick up some speed and my nerves started to kick-in. Couldn't she have put this off for a few more days? I knew she was made at me again, but why did she always have to confront me about something? I walked into the garden room in which the queen liked to spend a lot of time in. She closed the door behind me and told me to take a seat. I hadn't eaten anything since last night and I was about to get sick to my stomach. I sat down and put on my strong face- the one that had originally ruined the relationship between Eddie and me. I couldn't let her see exactly how terrified I was of this confrontation. From past experience, they were never pleasant. Rosalind never sat down, but instead began to pace back and forth from her window as though she was trying to get her thoughts together. \"What are you doing here?\" She finally asked although it was more like a snap. \"Eddie and I decided to try to reconcile our relationship,\" I stated. \"No, Paige, I mean what are you doing here. Why did you agree to come back here?\" \"I love your son. And not having him in my life made it very empty. When I found out that Eddie felt the same way and that he wanted to try things again, of course I agreed to it. I had been wanting to reconcile things, but I was afraid...\" \"Afraid of what?\" Rosalind snapped. \"Afraid of being rejected! That would have hurt more than anything.\" \"Why would you think that Edvard would reject you?\" \"Because he is the king of Denmark. He could have any girl he wants. I was afraid that he had moved on.\" \"No, he never did move on. Which explains why you are here. But why are you here, Paige? Is it for the fame? The opportunity to be a princess and a queen one day? The American girl fairy-tale?\" \"No, of course not. I came back because I love your son so much.\" \"So much is a cliché term.\" \"I love him more than anything in the world,\" I said with emotion. \"Without him, I am empty, incomplete.\" \"Why did you leave him then, if you can't live without him?\" She snapped at me \"Fear. I was overwhelmed by everything it took to be a part of this family...all the duties and responsibilities. I became afraid of failure, or even worse, letting Edvard down and I ran to make sure that would never happen.\" \"You know you really hurt him. He was never the same after you left. I caught him many times crying. He always seemed distracted, disorganized. I was truly beginning to worry about his mental state of mind. I tried to get him to take anti-depressants, which helped him a little bit, but not much. Then, I noticed in the past few weeks that he had been acting normal again, and I thought it was because he had finally gotten over you. He told me he stopped taking his anti-depressants and he said he didn't need them anymore. He began to function normally again. I believed he had finally came to his senses and moved on. But it was because you were back in his life,\" she stated coldly. \"And I never knew that you were until I saw you in the hallway just now! I about had the biggest surprise of my life! You nearly gave me a heart-attack! When did you arrive?\" \"Yesterday, around mid-afternoon.\" \"How long do you plan to stay?\" \"Eddie and I agreed to spend half the summer here, and then once Congress goes into recess, he would spend some time with me and my family at the farm.\" Rosalind sighed and began to pace again. \"Are you sure you want this Paige? Have you ever thought it may be best to leave Edvard alone and let him live his own life?\" \"I have,\" I said quickly. \"That's why I left a few months ago, but I realize that it was the worst mistake of my life.\" \"Are you two engaged again?\" She asked coldly. \"No,\" I said. \"We both agreed to take things slowly.\" \"That ring on your hand means nothing then?\" \"Eddie..Edvard gave it to me last night as a remembrance to begin our new relationship together,\" I said. I didn't want her to know the history behind the ring. It was personal and none of her business. I just wanted to keep that between Eddie and myself. Maybe one day I could tell her, if we ever became close again. Although, I doubted that would happen. \"Good-day Paige,\" she said and motioned for me to leave with her hand. I did as I was told and left. I decided to go to my room and call my parents. And maybe stay in there for a little bit. At least until the royal family got used to the idea of me being here again. The drama-free romance was nice while it lasted. Chapter 10: After I had finished talking to my parents, I decided to some TV on. After flipping through a few channels, (which were all in Danish), I found a Danish soap opera that caught my attention. The girl was crying after a boy, she obviously didn't want him to leave, but he continued to pack and would say something's to her occasionally. Even though I didn't understand a word of what they were saying, I was able to piece together what was going on during the show. I was watching this when Eddie came in to get me for dinner, except he came an hour early. \"Hey,\" he said softly coming into my room. \"Hey,\" I said smiling at him. \"You haven't left your room at all today? Are you feeling okay?\" He asked coming over to me. \"I'm just a little jet-lagged. I did venture out today, and started to explore a little bit, but then I ran into your mother.\" \"Oh,\" he said looking down. \"How come you didn't tell her about us?\" \"Do you blame me? All I heard after you left was how it was for the better and how you were a bad influence on me. I wasn't going to tell her until you came here. And unfortunately, I haven't seen my mother in the past few days. Between Congress and every free second I have, I want to spend it with you. Are you mad at me?\" \"A little, but I understand why you didn't want to tell her at first, but you probably should have made an effort to tell her that I was here.\" \"I'm sorry, Paige. I honestly just didn't have the opportunity to tell her.\" \"It's fine Eddie, don't worry about it.\" \"I told Arabella though. She was excited. She had missed you as well.\" I smiled. Arabella was Eddie's little sister. \"I missed her as well.\" \"How did the conversation go between the two of you?\" I snorted. \"Not well. Did you actually think it would go well?\" \"What did she say?\" \"She kept on asking me why I was here, thinking that I'm only in it for the fame and glory. And then asked me if I had ever thought that it may be best for you if I leave. She also told me how hurt you were,\" I said stroking his cheek at the last part. \"It's okay now Paige. Maybe God wanted you to leave to help us realize how much we love each other and needed each other in our lives.\" I was startled by Eddie's profound words. \"I never thought of it that way,\" I said. He leaned forward and gave me a quick kiss and then laughed at what he saw I was watching. \"Do you understand a word of what they are saying?\" he asked \"No,\" I said. \"But I can kind of understand by their emotions,\" I said laughing. \"Yes, this show is pretty emotional. Arabella likes to watch it sometimes, although I think it's too mature for her sometimes. Some steamy scenes and...\" I laughed. \"Yeah probably.\" \"Are you ready to go? Or do you want to change?\" \"I think I need to change,\" I said looking down at my jeans and t-shirt. I got up and grabbed a dressy black skirt (the tighter kind that shows off your body) and a short-sleeve, white blouse that ruffled up slightly at the top. Part of me wanted to change right there in front of Eddie, but then I realized that wouldn't be taking things slow and I should go into the bathroom. I decided against it. \"Would you be uncomfortable if I changed out here, or do you want me to go into the bathroom?\" \"You can change out here. I won't look,\" he said. That kind of defeats the purpose, I thought to myself. I quickly changed and glanced over to see if Eddie really wasn't looking. He wasn't. I think he was the only guy in the world who wouldn't watch his girlfriend change. Why did he have to be so good sometimes? But I loved him even more for it. Chapter 11: I quickly put on some make-up and fixed my hair. Eddie couldn't believe that I didn't have make-up on before. He said I looked as beautiful as I always do. Why did he have to be so perfect? Did he take some boyfriend class or something? Or was I really this blind before? Had fear blinded me so much that I couldn't see what an amazing man Eddie was? He took my hand and walked me downstairs and through some hallways to where Parliament was. The men quieted down when they saw that Eddie walked in with me. I guess he hadn't told them either that I was back. \"Hello, everyone,\" Eddie said squeezing my hand. I'm sure he could sense my fear. \"This is my girlfriend, Paige. I invited her to eat dinner with us tonight,\" he stated. Some of the members just stared at me as though they couldn't believe I was back. 'That's great,\" one member said. \"When did you come in Miss Paige?\" he asked. \"Yesterday,\" I said. \"So now we know where Edvard has been sneaking off too for dinner last night and lunch,\" one man said teasingly. We split up into three groups and went into three different large cars. Eddie and I took the back of a van and no one else sat back there with us. \"The two lovebirds hiding at the back of the car. Edvard, don't pull to many moves on her. People are here in the car you know,\" a man said teasingly. Everyone started laughing, including Eddie so I did too. It was a cute joke, but I was just too scared. I had on my strong face for Eddie, although I was beginning to think that he was starting to see through it. \"When is the big day?\" The member who was driving the car asked. \"We..um..\" Eddie and I began to answer at the same time not sure what to say. \"We've both agreed to hold off on the marriage for a little bit,\" Eddie stated. The car fell silent for a few seconds. Why did this have to be so awkward? \"Is she pregnant then?\" the same man who made the crack about us being in the back together asked. His jokes weren't being so funny anymore. No one laughed at this joke. Everyone thought he was being serious. \"Is she?\" Someone else asked. \"I am NOT pregnant,\" I said sternly. \"You got a feisty on there,\" the \"jokester\" said. \"Gentlemen please, these comments are unnecessary,\" Eddie said defending me. I turned and smiled at him. He knew that was my way of thanking him. The conversation switched to another member of Parliament and teasing him about his girlfriend. I was just glad that the attention wasn't on us anymore. Overall, the dinner went well. It was pleasant and I was asked many questions about American government. I tried to answer them as best as I could. Some of them were pretty detailed, that I wasn't exactly sure about. American government wasn't exactly my favorite class in high school. Who knew that I may be running a country one day? I'm telling you the Big Guy Upstairs has a funny sense of humor. Chapter 12: When we arrived at the restaurant, I saw that another member of Parliament had brought their girlfriend with them as well. I'll just be blunt- this made my night hell. \"Paige, between us girls,\" she whispered to me leaning forward, as though we were going to have some big secret sharing/bonding moment. \"Did you come back to tell Edvard some news? Some news that he may or may not be happy about?\" \"I don't quite understand what you are asking,\" I said putting down my menu. \"Paige,\" she said lowering her voice even more, that I even I had a hard time hearing her. \"Are you pregnant?\" Eddie, who was at the head of the table, looked up at that question. Although I was sitting at the corner next to him so I guess he could hear our conversation. This girl wasn't in our car, so didn't hear the conversation on this matter. I leaned down and whispered to her- \"No, I am not.\" \"Paige, it's okay. You can tell me.\" \"I'm not pregnant,\" I snapped in a whisper, although my voice was rising slightly. This was beginning to be really annoying. \"Then why did you come back?\" she asked in a normal voice. \"Because I love him,\" I said looking over at Eddie, smiling. The girl snorted. \"Sure you do,\" she said picking up her menu. I was about ready to throw my water on her, although that really wouldn't be very princessy like- or civilized. Who was she to say something like that? Who did she think she was? Oh yeah, the girlfriend of a member of Parliament. Eddie sensed my dislike to the girl sitting next to me, and he gave me a reassuring smile. I smiled back at him. He knew that he would be in for a long rant later tonight from me. \"Listen,\" the girl whispered, \"girl to girl, Edvard and I had a little fling after you left. I am honestly surprised he took you back after you obviously begged him. Our relationship was going quite well. But, for some reason he asked us to take a break. Besides, I favor John so much better. He is much better in the bedroom, if you know what I mean.\" My eyes bugged out and I looked down at my menu and I didn't say anything. It was better to say nothing than to tell her what I wanted to tell her. It wouldn't have been a nice dinner. Chapter 13: I remained quiet throughout the rest of the dinner. I answered when I was spoken to, but I never tried to chime into conversations. I could tell that Eddie knew something happened between us girls. He kept on smiling at me. That was his way of telling me that he would listen to me later tonight and that it would be okay. We arrived back to the palace and we walked silently to my room. We didn't want any of the servants to overhear our conversation- that much was understood between us. He knew that if he asked me if I had a good time, the answer would have been no, with a LONG explanation. \"Go ahead,\" Eddie said as we entered my room. \"What did Sarah say to you?\" \"Oh that's her name. That's good to know,\" I said sarcastically. \"I wish I had known that for dinner!\" \"Paige-\" he started to say, but I cut him off. I didn't mean to. I just had to get this off my chest. \"Where do you want me to start with that girl!? She first asked me if I was pregnant, in two different ways. And then she asked me why I came back, and I said it was because I love you, and she said \"sure you do.\" Eddie's eyes budged out when I said this. \"And THEN on top of everything else, she said that you guys had a fling after I left.\" Eddie made a face and kind of looked down on the bed. I knew that look. It was his guilty look. \"Oh my gosh!\" I said jumping off the bed. \"You had a fling with her after I left!? Everything you told me about hurting and being sad was all bull wasn't it!?\" I yelled. \"Paige, please listen. It wasn't my choice-\" His voice was beginning to rise as well to a yelling tone. \"What do you mean it wasn't your choice!?\" I yelled back at him. \"JUST LISTEN! TO MAKE OUR RELATIONSHIP WORK WE NEED TO BE COMPLETELY OPEN WITH EACH OTHER AND TELL EACH OTHER EVERYTHING. I AM TRYING TO DO THAT!\" He yelled. I was kind of taken back his tone of voice, but I understood that he was upset. \"Okay,\" I said calmly looking right into his eyes. \"Please come,\" he said gently motioning over to the bed. I walked over and sat down. \"Paige,\" he started to move for my hand, but then decided against it. \"I was heart-broken after you left. Everything I told you was the complete truth. Even somewhat water-downed. I took anti-depressants after you left and even when to a few counseling sessions. Part of the session was to go out on a date. They said it was part of the healing process to put yourself back out there. So I did. Bill and I have always been good friends and he introduced me to her. They were just friends at the time. Sarah was the only girl I had contact with, so I asked her on a date. Then my counselor said that one wasn't enough and to go on another and then another. He tried to pressure me to go on another, but I said I couldn't. I just ended up thinking about you the entire time.\" I smiled at the last part. \"She says you slept together,\" I said. Eddie laughed at this. \"No, we did not. I believe she wanted to, but I'm not like that Paige. I'm not like those guys. Now, I'm not going to lie to you. I'm not a virgin, but I have only been once with a girl who I thought I loved, but she didn't love me for who I was. Just for my family and everything that comes with it. That really hurt a lot. Now, I can't give me virginity to someone who I truly love and they love me back. It's gone. I'm sorry about that Paige.\" I smiled at him for his honesty. \"I'm still a virgin,\" I said. \"Really, I am. I always wanted to give it to someone whom I loved. And someone who I would love for the rest of my life.\" \"I wish I had done the same,\" Eddie said looking down. \"So, are we good?\" He asked. I smiled and nodded. \"I'm sorry Eddie. For getting mad at you. I should have known better,\" I said. \"It's okay Paige. I had been waiting for the right time to tell you, because I knew that you would hear about it sooner or later. And telling you would be the right thing to do because I love you, and I don't hide anything from you.\" He leaned forward and kissed me. \"Good-night Paige Morgan. I love you,\" Eddie said between kisses. \"Good-night Edvard Williams. I love you too,\" I said kissing him back. Eddie left and I took a shower and then went to bed. I lay in bed looking at my promise ring. It was still so beautiful in the dark. I wondered if it would ever be replaced with a diamond ring. Chapter 14: After our little fight yesterday, Eddie and I both could sense how much work our relationship needed. We had been a part for a quite a while, and though we agreed to forget about the past, it still hovered over us slightly. Eddie had really wanted me to see Denmark, so after Parliament was released for the day, we drove all over Denmark. It was really interesting. Eddie pointed out all of the old churches and buildings and such. But the car ride really gave us a chance to bond again. \"Eddie, are you mad at me?\" I asked him when we were at a stoplight. He hesitated before he gave me his answer. \"Slightly,\" he said. \"I just wish you wouldn't have accused me without speaking to me first. I hope you would know me better.\" \"It would have been fine if you did sleep with her. What I was upset over, was after everything you had told me and then you still slept with. Well, that was very upsetting.\" Eddie sighed. \"You're right, that would be upsetting. But how about we promise to each other to never accuse without hearing the other side first. Paige, if...if were ever to get married one day, or even as we date. The press and tabloids will always slam us. You and I will both be having affairs and their creations go on and on. People will always be trying to break us a part and turn us against each other. We have to be strong enough where we know that will never happen. And that starts with to never accuse when an enemy, and I would call Sarah and enemy after last night, says something horrible about the other person. I promise you, to never listen to any of them and to always believe you.\" \"Eddie, I am so sorry. I shouldn't have done that...I over-reacted. I'm so sorry again. I promise you that it will never happen again. I will always listen to you first.\" We decided to take a stop at a small town for dinner about two hours away from Copenhagen. I walked into the restaurant and see on the front page of the newspaper: King Edvard dumps Sarah Hexton for ex-girlfriend Paige Morgan! Another newspaper headline said this: Paige Morgan is PREGNANT! And finally, a magazine headline said this: King Edvard reunites with ex-fiancé Paige Morgan! What is the big news that she came to tell Edvard? Turn to page 96 for all the details. I didn't even pick up any of the newspapers or magazines. Eddie saw me looking at them, but neither of us said anything as we waited to be seated. No one seemed to recognize us here, so that seemed well. But how many more rocks could our relationship handle? Chapter 15: After dinner, Eddie and I drove for about another three hours. Eddie wanted to show me the ocean in Denmark, where he had spent all of his summer as a child. Although, I honestly wasn't really sure sometime he knew where he was going. I told him he could stop and ask for directions, but you know how men are. \"Paige,\" Eddie said as we were driving on a country road. \"This may be too soon to ask, but I was wondering something.\" \"Okay,\" I said unsure of where this was going. \"Do you feel that you could handle all this one day?\" \"What do you mean?\" I asked. \"Do you feel that you would be okay...to handle all the paparazzi, false tabloids, newspapers, news on TV, on a day to day basis?\" \"Eddie, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to stare at the newspapers and magazines at the restaurant, and it's just that this is all so new to me. It's shocking how people you don't even know what to be so involved in your life.\" \"That's not what I meant Paige. Do you feel, we could ever be married one day?\" \"Of course, I could see us being married one day,\" I said truthfully. \"I have been giving this a lot of thought. And the more I think about it, the more I feel it would be the right thing to do for you. If this is all too much for you, but we want to get married, I would abdicate the throne for you. We could live in America, if you wanted.\" \"Eddie, I would never ask you to do that for me.\" \"I know, but I want you in my life and I want you to be happy.\" \"I am happy. I'm happy just being with you.\" \"You say that now, but wait.\" \"Eddie, I'm not going anywhere. I won't leave you again. I need you in my life. I feel as though we are married and you are my other half. I love you. But before we jump into anything, don't you feel as though our relationship needs more time?\" \"Absolutely,\" Eddie said. We spent the rest of the car-ride talking about our children one day if we were to marry and our grandchildren. We talked about where we would go on our honeymoon, and how we could go places and avoid the cameras. We talked about all of these things and more. The conversation started out as a joke, but as it continued, it became more serious. And the more we talked about it, I saw myself as Mrs. Edvard Williams, Queen of Denmark. Chapter 16: We stopped at a hotel for the night around one o'clock in the morning. Eddie was getting tired and I couldn't drive in Denmark, so we decided to stop and spend the night there. The person behind the front desk immediately recognized us and began small talk, although he was mostly rambling. \"Two rooms or one?\" He asked. \"One is fine,\" Eddie said. \"One room for the King and his lady,\" he mumbled to himself, typing at the computer. After some brief small talk, we went off to our room. We arrived in the hotel room. Eddie took my bag and we placed our luggage on two separate beds. \"I guess I will take this one and you can take the one by the window,\" Eddie said. \"Okay,\" I said slightly disappointed. I showered and then went into my \"assigned\" bed. Edvard showered and went to his, although he came to kiss me good-night first. We said good-night and turned off the light. Eddie must be the only boyfriend in the country who would be okay with not sleeping in the same bed as his girlfriend in this situation. And I know he did it because he didn't want me to be pressured into anything I wasn't ready for. After a few minutes I called out his name. \"Yes,\" he said. I knew he was still wide awake. \"You know, we are the only couple in the world who wouldn't be lying together right now in a situation like this,\" I said. \"Well, I will gladly change beds, if you're okay with it. I don't want to go to fast for you,\" he said slowly getting out of bed. \"Yes, it's fine. You're more than welcome here.\" He crawled in next to me and pulled me against him to his bare chest. He always slept shirtless; he told me when he came out of the shower (I guess so I didn't get the wrong impression). He kissed the top of my head and I snuggled closer to him. I remembered the words I had told him last night about giving my virginity to someone I could see myself loving for the rest of my life. Well, I knew that person was holding me in his arms that night. I looked up at his face and kissed him. He kissed me back. I kissed him again, but this time it was harder, and more emotion was put into it. He could feel it and his kisses deepened. Our tongues were exploring each other's mouths and shivers were running up and down my body. I sat up slightly and moved my chest over his. I became even more aggressive with the kisses. His hands ran up and down the curves of my body, trying to feel me through my nightgown. Eddie suddenly stopped kissing me and looked at me, surprised. \"Are you sure you want to do this?\" he asked me. \"Yes, I want my gift of virginity to go to someone whom I will love the rest of my life,\" I said. I gave my gift to him that night. Chapter 17: We woke up the next morning in each other's arms. Last night would be a night that I would always remember. I woke up first with Eddie's hand around my waist. I could tell that he was still sleeping so I did not stir. I think I fell asleep again because the next thing that I remember was Eddie nuzzling my face with his face. His face was rough, he needed to shave, but I loved the feeling anyway. \"Good morning Paige,\" he said kissing my face. I groggily turned over and looked at him and smiled. \"Good morning,\" I said giving him a kiss on the lips. We looked at the clock and decided that we needed to get up and hit the road again. It was 9:30am which wasn't too late, but we wanted to be at the beach by noon and we still had a good three hours to drive. We got up and quickly got dressed and decided that we should probably grab breakfast before we hit the road. After taking the elevator down to the main lobby of the hotel, we decided that it would just be best to eat breakfast there. We walked into the restaurant and since there were not many people there, we were immediately seated. The waitress came over right away and asked us what we would like to drink. I requested an orange juice. Once the waitress came back, she just stared at us for a few seconds. And then she cried: \"Oh my king, I am so sorry I did not recognize you before. And his lady, my apologies as well,\" she said bowing to Eddie which I found to be rather amusing. I know that was the culture here, but coming from America, where we don't have royalty, I found the concept strange. Especially when she was bowing to Eddie and calling him King Edvard. Sometimes I wondered if I would ever be ready to handle everything that came with being a royal. Chapter 18 After breakfast we drove over to the beach. Eddie took the back roads and there was almost no one on the roads. I rolled down the window about halfway and smelled the salty sea air. I knew that we were close. Everything was so quiet. It was as though we were the only ones on the earth here. \"I always like to come here to think. It is so beautiful. I feel as though it is my secret place. Almost no one comes to this beach. I wanted to share this place with you,\" Eddie told me as the ocean slowly started to come into view. I gasped. The ocean was much more beautiful than the American beaches. The water was so ice blue. It was unbelievable. Eddie parked and we got out of the car and held hands as we walked down to the beach. We walked down to the ocean were the waves were slowly coming up onto our feets. \"It's so beautiful,\" I said staring in awe at the ocean. I looked around. I couldn't believe that there was hardly anybody here. Eddie cupped my chin and kissed me. \"A beautiful ocean for a beautiful girl,\" he said kissing me again. If only everything could always be this perfect. Chapter 19 Sooner than we would have both probably liked, reality came crashing down on us and it was time to return back to the palace in Copenhagen. I was exhausted and still trying to catch up from jet-lag and I ended up falling asleep for about two hours of the six hour journey. I felt bad about it, but when Eddie saw me struggling to stay awake; he took my hand, kissed it, and whispered \"good-night, Paige.\" He didn't have to try to convince me twice to take a nap. I woke up startled by hearing a loud crowd. I immediately came out of my deep sleep by practically jumping. We were right in front of the Copenhagen Palace, and there were about 100-150 reporters outside the gates. They came rushing to car and I looked at Eddie alarmed. I had no idea what to do. Before they had a chance to engulf the car, Eddie put the car into reverse and drove away as fast as he could. \"What the hell was that?\" I asked him still panicked. \"We are the most recent news story,\" he said calmly. \"You having a girlfriend makes the news?\" I said still panicked. My hands were literally shaking. I had never seen anything like that before. You would have thought that we had just discovered the cure for cancer and everyone wanted to interview us. \"Umm...yes. Well, there are several rumors circulating about us, such as we are engaged again, we are already married, you're expecting...nothing that you probably haven't seen on a magazine yet. But they all want to know the truth. They can't get any answers from anyone else, so I assume they thought that they should just go to the source.\" \"How...how are we gonna get in?\" \"There is a back entrance that no one knows about. Security would have come if we had called, but by then, I'm not sure if they would have been able to handle the situation. See what Soren has to say, but it may just be best to go talk to them through the gate later today.\" The last part made my stomach drop a few levels. \"We...have to talk to them?\" I whispered. Eddie could sense that I was tense and even scared over the took my hand and squeezed it. \"I can just do it, but it would look better if we both went,\" he said gently. After circling around for a while, somehow we ended up at the back end of the palace. I have no idea how Eddie did it; I was too scared to notice what he was doing. Soren was there to great us when we got out of the car. \"Soren, what should we do about the situation outside?' Eddie asked. \"Sir, it's up to you. What are you thinking?\" Soren replied. \"I was thinking that we should go and talk to them,\" Eddie said removing our suitcases from the trunk. \"It may be the only way to hush up all of this nonsense,\" Soren agreed. Eddie started walking to the inside of the palace and motioned for me to follow him. \"We need to go upstairs, change, and just go out and talk to them,\" Eddie told me. \"Are you going to be okay?\" \"Does feeling like I'm gonna throw-up count as okay?\" I said slightly sarcastic. \"Paige, please! You can do this! I know you can!\" Eddie said. He wasn't being as understanding as in the car. \"Now, probably wouldn't be the best time to say that you both have to be on television tomorrow morning with \"Good Morning Copenhagen,\" Soren said. \"WHAT!?\" I said. My mind started going into panic mode. I felt as though I couldn't breath. I couldn't do all of this. Eddie walked me to my room and we went in together. We didn't say anything to each other. He seemed oblivious to my breakdown that was going on inside of me. Eddie put my luggage down by my bed and gave me a quick kiss on the cheek. \"You can do this,\" he said reassuringly. \"I know you can.\" I gave him a weak smile and walked over to my closet. \"What should I wear?\" I mumbled still not happy about the situation. \"Just a blouse and a skirt is fine, or even dress pants. Just look nice. Like you're going to church or something,\" he said slowly leaving my room. \"And thank you Paige. I promise it won't be as bad as you think.\" I grunted and pulled out a blouse and pair of black dress pants and put them on the bed. \"I'll be downstairs waiting for you,\" Eddie said closing the door behind him. I looked at myself in the mirror and tried to touch up on my make-up. Ugh, I looked terrible. Plus, I felt terrible. I was exhausted and all this stress and excitement was starting to take a toll on my stomach. I sighed, and then went to go get changed. I took in a deep breath and then went to go face the press. Chapter 20 I walked downstairs and saw Eddie waiting for me on the couch. He was wearing a light blue button down shirt with a pair of khaki pants. He stood up and smiled at me. I didn't return it. I wasn't that I was mad at him; I was simply terrified. \"Are you ready?\" he said taking my hand and squeezing it. I nodded slowly and I could feel my heart racing against my chest. My stomach muscles clenched and I felt myself tensing up. With my luck, I'd get out there and throw up. I tried to take a few deep calm breaths and tried not to look terrified. We left the palace together, hand in hand and went to go face the press. Eddie seemed very calm and relaxed. He smiled as we started to get closer to the gate and held my hand proudly. I tried to follow his lead and smile at the press, although I'm sure that my smile was not as genuine as his. \"Hello everyone,\" Eddie said as we were about three feet from the gate. \"We are here to answer a few questions.\" Don't throw up, I told myself as I felt my stomach muscles clenching some more. Immediately we were asked about one hundred questions and I was overwhelmed. My hand started to tremble slightly and Eddie squeezed is encouragingly. Cameras were flashing in our face and about a hundred microphones were being put through the gate. \"Please, just one question at a time,\" Eddie said calmly. \"Are you and Ms. Paige Morgan married?\" One immediately asked pushing her microphone as close to us as she could. \"No, we are not,\" Eddie said. \"Next question.\" \"Are you two engaged?\" Another reporter quickly asked. \"No, we are not,\" Eddie replied. \"Ms. Paige, are you carrying King Edvard's child?\" A reporter asked. I honestly did not hear the question addressed to me. I was too busy trying not to get sick. \"Paige,\" Eddie said gently nudging me. \"Huh...oh no, no I am not expecting a child,\" I said quickly. We were bombarded with about one hundred more questions and Eddie silenced them. \"Ladies and gentlemen, Paige Morgan is simply my girlfriend and nothing more. If something changes, we will be sure to inform everyone. It was a pleasure talking to everyone,\" Eddie said waving to the crowd. I waved back and turned around with him as we walked back to the palace. \"You did great,\" he whispered in my ear. I snorted. \"Really?' I asked? \"Yes,\" he said. \"This was your first time, and you did great.\" \"Excuse me,\" I said breaking free from his grip and running off. I was starting to gag. Eddie came running after me, but I had already gotten sick on the sidewalk. I was able to round the corner from the reporters, but I couldn't make it inside. Poor Eddie, (bless his heart), he had no idea what to do. He held my hair back for me and rubbed back reassuringly as I vomited on the side walk. I felt so embarrassed and I hated him to see my like this. When I finished, he squeezed me hand tightly. \"Come on,\" he whispered. I felt horrible and so embarrassed that he had to see me get sick. I planned on spending the rest of my night in my room until Eddie (hopefully) forgot about the whole incident. Then I realized that I may be in my room for quite a while. Chapter 21 I walked dizzily to my room with Eddie's hand around my waist guiding me. He asked me several times if I wanted to be carried and I stubbornly said no. I was fine, but I was just still getting over all these nerves. Eddie helped me lay down on my bed and gave me a cool washcloth for my face. He wiped my face gently and then started to stroke my cheek. \"Eddie...\" I started to say but then I started to choke up. I have no idea why, but tears just started streaming down my face. \"Shhh...,\" he said wiping the tears off of my face. \"I'm so sorry,\" I whispered. \"I don't know what happened. I'm...\" \"You were scared,\" he said bluntly. \"I'm sorry that this...life...scares you so much,\" he said lying down next to me. I felt so stupid. I snuggled up to him and took his hand. No one said anything. \"Maybe I shouldn't be here...\" I whispered. \"What! Paige, that's nonsense. Stop talking like that,\" Eddie said. \"I think we both know it's true...\" \"I think you need some sleep. You're not thinking reasonably. Paige, it was one time.\" \"We have to go on TV tomorrow too...\" I whispered. \"Tomorrow is another day. I think that you'll feel better in the morning.\" I literally started to shake at the thought of going on national television live tomorrow morning. Eddie picked me up and held me in his arms. He began to stroke my hair and kept me in his arms until I feel asleep. Edvard was the perfect man. Why did his life have to be so complicated? Chapter 22 Today was the day. I had to go on Denmark National TV with Edvard. The people of Denmark wanted some answers about our relationship (and even though it was non of their business) Soren advised us to do at least one interview and then refuse to do others. Edvard had done this 100 times before and this was my first time and terrified. I groaned as my alarm went off at 3:30am. Getting up this early was almost painful but I wasn't groaning because I was tired. I slept for maybe half an hour at the most and then I'd snap out of my dreamy state and realize what was going on. I got out of bed and a few minutes later Eddie was knocking on my door to make sure that I was awake. Yeah, like I could have actually slept last night. He wasn't able to stay because he had to get ready too but I really wish he had stayed. I needed him to stay for some emotional support. I was literally on verge of vomiting again but I took a few deep breaths, calming myself down. Shortly, I found myself dressed in the outfit that the Queen, Rosalind, had picked out for me (I hated it) and I went downstairs to eat my breakfast. I mean, to pick at my breakfast. Eddie greeted me with a big smile and got up to give me a kiss on the cheek. I sat and down and wanted to gag looking at my food. My stomach did not want me to eat. I picked up my fork and took a small bite out of my eggs. \"Don't worry Paige,\" Eddie said noticing my stiffness, \"I know that you will do great.\" \"Eddie, I really don't think...\" I trailed off noticing Rosalind looking at me with almost a smile on her face as though she wanted me to fail at this assignment with Eddie. I gave up on my last attempt to try to get out of this interview. \"I don't think I told you about the new movie coming out. Arabella and I were thinking about seeing it together. You know, to try to get to know each other better. She is such a sweet girl,\" I said glancing over at Rosalind trying to gain her favor slightly. Rosalind snorted and Eddie smiled and asked if he could join us. I gladly accepted. I guess we have to take a trip to the movies now. I'd try to let them occupy my mind instead of the fact that I was about to be seen on \"Good Morning Denmark\" in less than a few hours for all to see. Chapter 23 \"Keep you chin up so I can do your eyes,\" the lady who was doing my make-up requested of me. I did as I was told. I was being really quiet and I hoped I didn't come off as being cold. \"How are you feeling?\" She asked me after about ten minutes from silence. \"Are you nervous?\" \"Yeah, I'm pretty nervous,\" I said smiling. \"Honestly, pretty scared.\" She put her arm on my shoulder kindly. \"I can tell. You're hands have been shaking every time you moved them. And I don't blame you. I probably would have thrown up by now,\" she said putting some blush on my cheeks. \"I've been feeling that way all morning long. But this will be over soon and hopefully won't have to do this for a long time,\" I said. \"I think that the first time is the worst. After that it won't be so bad. What do you want to do with your hair?\" She asked finger combing my short brown hair. \"I honestly don't know. What do you think?\" \"I may curl the ends out a little bit. And if we do this,\" she said moving some hair around, \"it kind of looks like layers and it'll frame your face.\" \"Sound good,\" I said trying to relax. \"I feel horrible about asking this- but can you remind me of your name again?\" She laughed and picked up the curling iron. \"I don't think I ever told you it. I just came over and started doing your make-up. But it's Cassandra.\" \"I'm Paige,\" I said. \"I know,\" she said working on my hair. \"I'm sorry, that must be so weird for you.\" \"It's pretty strange. People know me and I have no idea who they are. I don't think it's something that I'll be able to get used to. You know how you run into people when your out and they remember you from like elementary school or something and you have no idea who they are?\" \"Yeah, I hate it when that happens,\" Cassandra said. \"That is what's it like all the time.\" \"That must be so weird.\" \"It is.\" \"FIVE MINUTES!\" The manager yelled. My heart suck about 5 levels in my chest. Five more minutes and I'd be on National TV in Denmark. The thought got to my stomach. The small breakfast that I had managed to get down was slowly creeping back up. \"Excuse me,\" I said jumping up and running to the bathroom. I locked myself in there and vomited. I took a few deep breaths and cleaned myself up. After a few minutes, I heard a soft knocking on the door. \"Ma'am? Are you okay?\" It was Cassandra. I opened the door and apologized profusely to her. \"Come here,\" she said taking my arm. \"Let me just re-touch this up a little bit and you'll be ready to go. Don't be scared of the people. They all love you.\" \"Thank you for being so understanding.\" \"Do you feel better?\" \"Surprisingly yes. But now I don't feel well from getting sick. It's a lose-lose situation,\" I said trying to laugh a little bit. \"The interview won't last long and you can go home and rest. Just concentrate on one thing and don't look around at the audience or the cameras. You got this.\" You got this Paige. You got this. I kept on trying to tell myself this over and over again. \"ONE MINUTE!? WHERE IS SHE!?\" The manager said coming into the room. \"Good luck!\" Cassandra said patting me on the back. \"Thank you,\" I said leaving with the manager. I turned my head back and gave her a smile as my way of thanking her again. I walked over to Edvard who was standing by the stage, ready for them to call us out. \"Everything okay,\" he asked taking my hand. \"Yeah,\" I said smiling. \"We were just trying to get things perfect.\" \"Are you ready?\" \"Yeah,\" I said squeezing his hand as they called our names and the crowd cheered. With my heart beating fast and my palms sweating; I walked out on stage with the King of Denmark. Ready or not, I had to go. Chapter 24 I walked out on stage with Edvard as the crowds cheered and cameras were following our every move. I squeezed his hand some more as we shook the host's hand and took our seats next to her. \"King Edvard and his guest Paige Morgan! Welcome to Good Morning Denmark!\" The host said welcoming us. \"This is Agnetha and you are watching Good Morning Denmark,\" she said looking at the cameras. Then, she turned back to both us and sat down. \"Thank you for coming on today!\" \"Thank you for inviting us,\" Eddie said. Oh God. My heart was beating so fast now. I was going to have to say something. \"It's a pleasure being here,\" I said smiling at Agnetha. Did that make sense? She wasn't looking at me strangely so I guessed so. \"So please answer this question that Denmark has been buzzing about! What is going on between you two? We know you were engaged a few months ago and Paige, may I call you Paige?\" I nodded and she continued. \"Paige you left poor Edvard here! But now you are back! Can you please talk about this?\" \"Umm...,\" my heart felt like it was going to burst from my chest at the rate that it was racing. But I took Cassandra's advice and just looked at Agnetha. Like it was just me and her talking. \"We both feel,\" I said turning to Edvard, \"that we went too fast with the engagement. And with all of this being so new to me, I honestly just got scared and a little overwhelmed which is why I left and the engagement was called off.\" Agnetha was nodding her head understandingly and taking in all of this information in. I'm sure she knew that I wasn't giving her 100% of the truth but it was about 90% of it. \"And now you're back,\" she said trying to keep the conversation going. \"What made you decide to come back?\" \"I couldn't just shake the feelings that I had for Edvard after I left. I had always known that I loved him but I thought that after being apart, I'd...not be able to forget about him but be able to move on. But I couldn't. In fact, I think my love for him grew after being apart from him. And when I found out that Edvard felt the same way; I came back.\" Some people in the audience went \"awww\" at my answer. I hoped I wasn't saying too much and I hoped I was saying enough as well. \"So what's going on with you guys now? Are you engaged again? Or simply dating? Or are you a couple? Tell us.\" Edvard squeezed my hand and started to answer. He knew that I did not like answering all of these questions. \"No, we aren't engaged. But we are not simply dating.\" \"So what's going on with you two? Do you consider her to be your girlfriend?\" \"Yes, Paige is my girlfriend.\" The crowd began to cheer and I was slightly taken back by that. I hope my face didn't show my surprise or else the newspapers will be writing that I was surprised that he called me his girlfriend. \"However, when I call Paige my girlfriend it does not have the same meaning as a high school student calling someone his girlfriend or even some college aged couples. It runs much deeper than that. It's more than physical attraction or just a connection.\" \"Then what is it then?\" Agnetha asked. \"Love,\" I said looking at Eddie. \"King Edvard, are you in love with this young American girl from Wisconsin?\" Agnetha sked. \"I am in love with her and I know that she is in love with me,\" he replied squeezing my hand slightly. The crowd awed again and began to clap and I smiled at Edvard. I began to relax slightly. \"Now the other thing that Denmark is buzzing about is the concept of a royal baby,\" Agnetha said. Any once of relaxation I felt was now gone and I began to tense up again. \"Paige, did you come back to inform Edvard that you were carrying his child?\" \"No,\" I said shaking my head. \"I'm not pregnant.\" For some comic relief, Agnetha purposely turned her sideways and looked down at my stomach. \"See, I said smiling. No baby bump there!\" I said tightening my shirt around my abdomen. \"Aw! I think some of us Danes were hoping for a royal baby!\" Agnetha said. The crowd began to laugh. \"Now, tell us something interesting about yourself Paige and Edvard. Any special talents that you have or do you know any skills?\" \"I actually enjoying cooking,\" Eddie said. \"And he's really good at it too,\" I pitched in. \"How interesting! I never would have guessed! How did that come about?\" \"Paige taught me when I was in America. I asked her if she would show me and she did. After I got the hang of it; I would really enjoy it and cook a meal for fun or I'd bake something.\" \"He'd cook for me all the time and sometimes my roommate. It was greatly appreciated!\" I said. \"I want a man who will cook for me,\" Agnetha said laughing and the crowd joined in. Even I laughed. \"What about you Paige? What's your secret talent?\" \"I'm can play the piano pretty well and I like to knit and crochet scarves, hats, shirts...pretty much anything!\" \"How did knitting and crocheting come about?\" Agnetha asked. \"It would be something that I'd do when I was stressed out. It would help relax me.\" \"Edvard, did you get any of these famous scarves?\" \"Yes, I have a few scarves, hats, and I even got a shirt once. They are all beautifully done. I could always expect a scarf during midterms and exam time!\" He said laughing. \"I love finding these interesting facts about the new couple that everyone in Denmark is talking about. Please stay tuned and we will continue to talk to King Edvard and Paige Morgan,\" Agnetha said looking at the cameras, smiling. The light that said \"on-air\" went off and I breathed a sigh of relief. We were almost half-way done with the interview. \"Paige,\" Edvard whispered in my ear, \"I want you to hold my hand but can you not squeeze it so tightly? You're cutting off my blood circulation a little bit,\" he said chuckling. \"Sorry,\" I mumbled. \"I know your nervous so hold it tight but just not as tight,\" he whispered in my ear again. \"But you're doing a fantastic job. I know that this is really hard for you. I'm so proud of you,\" and with that, he gave me a kiss on the cheek. I wiped why one sweaty palm on my pant leg and took a deep breath in. This was almost over. This was almost over. \"You have no idea how much everyone here really appreciates you two coming on the show together,\" Agnetha said trying to make some small talk. \"It's really our pleasure,\" Edvard said. \"I know we've been leaving the people in Denmark slightly in the dark in regards to our relationship and we both wanted to clear things up a little bit.\" \"What's it like being on TV for the first time, Paige?\" She asked me. \"I've really enjoyed the experience. It's nothing like what I thought it would be,\" I replied. \"ON AIR IN 5, 4,...\" then the camera man began to move his fingers and mouth the rest of the words. My heart began to pick up speed again. Edvard and I smiled at the cameras as they turned to us. I thought I was going to get sick again. I squeezed Edvard's hand a little bit more and he smiled at me reassuringly. \"We're back with Denmark's favorite couple- King Edvard and his girlfriend, Paige Morgan,\" Agnetha said looking at the cameras. \"We are now going to take a few questions from the audience.\" A group of people had submitted questions and a few were chosen, I had just found out. \"Alright, our first question is,\" Agnetha said looking at the screen. I look anxiously at it and it read: How did you two first meet? I breathed a sign of relief. \"Well, we actually were able interact a lot with each other in college. I had an English class with her on Shakespeare and we would study together. We also worked together in the student resturant and bar on campus,\" Edvard said. \"I think we all want to know the first time that you laid eyes on Paige. What was going through your head? What attracted you to her?\" Agnetha asked. \"Actually the very first time I met Paige, it was a few days before classes started. She was already working in the student resturant and bar. I was sitting down and relaxing and I saw this beautiful girl walking around. After a while, I got the courage to introduce myself to her,\" Edvard explained. I secretly wanted to laugh. I remembered that night and Edvard was drunk. He was a drunk guy hitting on me and didn't make the best impression. When I saw him on my English class; I honestly was not thrilled about the whole situation. However, I wanted to smile at that memory. It seemed like such a long time ago, but it wasn't even a year ago. \"What was it that attracted you to Paige?\" Agnetha asked. \"Her smile. She had the most beautiful smile I had ever seen,\" Edvard said smiling at me. The crowed awed again at this and I smiled back at Edvard. I really wanted to kiss him but I resisted. \"Now Paige, what did you think of Edvard that night?\" Agnetha asked. \"I found him to be very handsome and I enjoyed talking to him,\" I lied. \"And it was nice to see him again in English class a few days later,\" I lied again. \"When did you know that you were falling for him? Like when did you start to give you butterflies in your stomach around him?\" She asked me. \"Hmmm that's actually a really hard question,\" I said trying to figure out how to answer this one. \"I always felt very attracted to Edvard when we were working together or in class or studying together. And I always pushed my attraction away and convinced myself that I didn't want a relationship with anyone because it would be too distracting. But since we were spending all that time together, we became very close and started to hang out outside of those activities too. Like we'd watch TV together-\" \"Or he'd cook for you,\" Agnetha interjected laughing. \"Exactly!\" I said laughing too. \"But the one time that I realized that I was falling for him and that I couldn't resist the feelings anymore was when me, Edvard, and some other friends were hanging out. We were outside and it started to rain very hard. I was wearing rubber flip-flops so it was hard to run with everyone else for shelter. Edvard saw that I was lagging behind and he stopped and waited for me. At this time we were just friends, but I remember that he took my hand and we ran to go join the others. That was when I stopping resisting my attraction to Edvard.\" \"What about you Edvard?' She asked. \"I had always been very attracted to Paige from the moment I met her. But, I thought that we would just be friends which I was okay with. But one time in particular was when we were studying together and she just smiled at me and that's when I knew that she was someone special.\" The crowd awed again. I smiled nervously. I knew that another question was coming my way. \"So what do you guys have planned for the future? Paige, when will you both decide to either tie the knot or call is quits?\" \"I think we are just going to take everything one day at a time and see what happens,\" I replied. \"But when-\" \"We don't have an ending date for our relationship. Or a date that says to get married or something,\" I replied slightly annoyed. \"Well that wraps up today's session. Thank you both so much for coming on the show,\" Agnetha said shaking both of our hands as we stood up. \"It's our pleasure,\" we both said as we shook her hand. Then we began to walk off stage and Edvard waved to the crowd. I followed his lead. We got to the backstage and I could see the \"on air\" light turn off. I exhaled a sigh of relief and realized that I had survived my first TV interview. I could still feel my stomach churning and I knew that one thing was for sure- I would never want to do this ever again. Chapter 25 \"Paige, you were fantastic! I am so proud of you!\" Eddie said giving me a kiss on the cheek. \"Thanks,\" I managed to say. I looked over at Cassandra and she gave me a big smile and two thumbs up. I knew that was her way of saying that I did a good job. As Eddie and I were heading to the door to leave, I turned to Cassandra and smiled at her. \"Bye and thank you for everything,\" I said waving. She knew what I meant. \"No problem! Maybe I'll see you around again,\" she said smiling back at me. \"Hopefully,\" I said and then turned around and left wit Edvard. Back at the palace I was exhausted. I had gotten almost no sleep, my stomach was still in knots, and I had a pounding headache from all the stress from this morning. \"Hey Paige, I was wondering if you wanted to go take a walk around the grounds here together,\" Eddie said as we arrived home. I smiled at him and squeezed his hand, but a walk was the last thing that I wanted to do. \"I'd love to but right now I'm exhausted. I was planning on resting. Maybe later today?\" \"Sure,\" he said giving me a kiss on the cheek. I could feel Rosalind's eyes on me and she was not happy over something. My stomach churned again as I knew that it would not be long before she cornered me and wanted to talk to me. And I was right. As I was in my room laying down trying to get some sleep; she knocked loudly on my door. \"Come in,\" I said sitting up and opening my eyes. My heart stopped as I saw Rosalind come in my room. \"How are you feeling?\" She asked me coldly, sitting down on the edge of the bed. \"Better, thank you,\" I replied with little emotion in my voice. \"I need to talk to you Paige,\" she said sternly. \"And I need you to listen to me closely and understand what I am saying with an open mind. I know you think that I do not like you and that's not completely true. I can see that you are a nice girl and I see why Edvard was attracted to you. However, there is one major flaw in your relationship. You are commoner. You aren't used to this life. We don't get sick to our stomach before or after an interview,\" she stopped briefly to look at my expression. I tried not to show any. \"We're used to this,\" she continued. \"Edvard is used to this. He's to all the tabloids, media, and interviews. It's been a part of his life since birth. This concept is completely foreign to you. And I can see that you are struggling with this. Edvard needs someone who can support him and stand next to him. Someone who is used to this spotlight and all the responsibilities that come with being royal. That girl isn't you. He doesn't need to worry about you too on top of everything else he wants to do. You aren't the right girl for Edvard. He needs to marry someone of royal descent. Not a commoner.\" Rosalind took a deep breath and continued. \"My brother, may God rest his soul, dated and married a commoner. They lived here. There marriage survived only ten years and that was only because they tried to stick it out as long as possible to avoid bad media coverage. I saw their marriage hitting the rocks about after seven years. The girl could not handle all of the expectations and pressure that came with being royal. And he was not even the king. He didn't have to juggle all of those expectations and demands and his wife was not queen either. I just I need you think about this. You and Edvard come from two very different worlds. This situation is different. Edvard is king and if you marry him, you'll become the queen. Can you handle that?\" She asked me waiting for answer. \"Yes, I know that I can\" I said. Rosalind laughed. \"You say that now. But wait till you start to actually juggle being queen and having a marriage with Edvard. You feel like you don't see him a lot now, wait till your queen. And if you have children before you divorce; you'll have to juggle that as well. And my I also mention after you two divorce, the children will no longer be eligible to the throne of Denmark, do you understand that?\" \"That's not going to happen,\" I said sternly. Rosalind laughed again. \"You are so naive, Paige. Your relationship has already hit the rocks before, what makes you think that it won't again? Except this time it'll be more serious. Tell me what you want to do with your life Paige. What were you plans before you met Edvard?\" \"I want to be a doctor and I'll still get to do that.\" Rosalind was laughing in almost hysterics by now. \"You are so naive, Paige! You honestly think that you can work, be a queen, and be a mother one day too? And you marriage won't hit the rocks? You honestly think that you and Edvard are going to live happily ever after? You wouldn't live happily ever after even if you didn't work or did not have children! This is not a fairytale. This is real life. And you need to realize what you are getting yourself into. You need to realize what is best for Edvard and do it. If you truly care about him; you'll do what is best for him,\" she said keeping her voice low and in a monotone. \"No,\" I said sternly. I was about to cry but I couldn't let her see that. \"Leave Paige,\" Rosalind told me sternly as though it was a command. \"Just leave and don't tell Edvard good-bye. It's for the best. You don't belong here and we both know it. Edvard knows it too but he won't admit it. He thinks that you can get used to this life. I believe that these past two days have proved that you cannot. Go. You are no longer welcomed here. I do not want you here. You need to go. I'll leave you alone to think about what I just said. I except you to be gone by morning tomorrow.\" Rosalind turned and walked out of the room, leaving me all alone in my room where I broke down and cried. I remembered him from this morning when he was talking and the crowd cheering. The people of Denmark love him. He deserved someone who could be always on his side. Was that someone really not me? Was our relationship truly just a ticking time bomb? Ready to explode at any given second? I didn't see it that way. I knew that Rosalind did not truly like me, but I could not help but hear her words play in my head over and over again. I went to the bathroom and tried to fix my make-up that was now running down my face. Was Rosalind was right? Should I leave Edvard? She was right- if I loved him, I would want what was best for him. What would be best is someone who was not me. I got so upset at this that I made myself sick again. I couldn't do this. I couldn't handle all of this stress and everything that was expected of me. But this was still early. Edvard and I weren't talking about marriage or anything. Why was so panicked? I tried to compose myself and not let Rosalind's words get to me anymore than they had already had. I composed myself and washed my face. I couldn't bear to leave Edvard again. I simply couldn't do it. But I needed to leave and give up any hopes of Edvard and I being together forever. \"Paige, what's wrong?\" I heard Edvard asked. I turned around startled by seeing him. I didn't hear him come in the room. He was honestly the last person that I wanted to see right now. \"Nothing,\" I mumbled. \"Paige, I know you well enough to know that there is something wrong. You don't need to bottle it up. We need to talk about it.\" \"I can't...\" I mumbled. \"Paige,\" he said kindly, taking my hand and leading me to the bed. I sat down next to him and tried not to let him see that I was crying. \"You did great at the interview today...is everything okay back in Wisconsin?\" He asked gently. I nodded. \"Then what is it?\" He asked. \"You're mother came in to talk to me. About how I need to leave because I'm not fit for this life. I can't handle it and she said that I never will be able to. She basically said that our relationship wasn't going to last and that I needed to leave you if I truly cared about you so you could be with someone who could help you run the country better. Someone who is used to this. Used to being a royal,\" I managed to say. \"And I just can't help but question that she may be right,\" I said looking down. \"I cannot believe her,\" Edvard snarled. \"I don't want to leave you but I want what's best for you. Do you really think that were on a road to disaster?\" I asked through my tears. \"What!? Paige, no!\" He said grabbing my arm. \"You can't leave me. And of course we aren't on the road to a divorce or a very rocky relationship. We're perfect for each other.\" He took me in his arms, hugged me very tightly and kissed my head. \"There will always be people who want to tear us apart. I just never dreamed that my mother would be one of them. Don't let what she said bother you- \" \"She said that I wasn't welcomed her anymore. And that I needed to leave by morning,\" I said cutting him off. \"She said WHAT!?\" He snapped. \"SHE IS the one who is not welcomed here anymore!\" He said is voice raising. I had never seen Edvard so angry before. \"Paige,\" he said looking into my eyes. \"I cannot imagine my life without you in it. I love you so much. If I really thought that you were taking on too much and that it would affect our relationship- I'd abdicate the throne for you.\" \"You'd do that for me?\" \"I'd walk through fire for you. I'd do anything for you. I love you,\" he said stroking my hair. \"I'd do anything for you too. I love you so much,\" I said kissing him. We began to kiss passionately after proclaiming our deep feelings for each other. However, I was still exhausted and after we broke apart, Edvard held me until I fell asleep with Rosalind's words pounding in my ears. Chapter 26 I woke up several hours later only to discover that Edvard had left. I was slightly disappointed but I secretly hoped that he would be there when I woke up. I changed and walked down the hallway trying to look for him. I heard his voice off in the distance and I followed it, but I also found an unfriendly voice as well- Rosalind's. \"How dare you tell Paige, my girlfriend, that she is not welcome here and to leave by tomorrow? And on top of all that, you are trying to scare her out of this relationship. How DARE you!\" I heard Edvard say with his voice rising at the last part. \"I'm trying to think of what's best for Denmark and you, Edvard.\" \"What's best for me and Denmark is Paige. She is a fantastic girl mother! I don't understand how you don't see that!\" \"Royals and commoners are never compatible,\" Rosalind snapped. \"But we ARE!\" Eddie heard me walking down the hallway and he poked his head out the doorway and motioned for me to come and join him. I was hesitant at first, but I trusted that he would protect me from anything that Rosalind would say or do. \"This girl right here,\" he said taking my hand, \"is the love of my life. And she loves me too. There is nothing that can separate us and destroy our love.\" \"I'm just trying to stop the inevitable from happening-\" Rosalind started to say. \"If being king means that I can't be with Paige, then I'll abdicate the throne- no questions asked,\" Eddie replied. Rosalind was speechless at this remark. \"I want to treat Paige with the respect that she deserves. If you have any further concerns, I want you to address them to the both of us,\" Eddie said looking at his mother. Rosalind didn't say anything again which Eddie somehow took as her way of agreeing with everything that he was saying. \"We'll see you at dinner,\" Eddie said leaving and guiding me out with him. He took me down the hall and then turned me around, gently placed me against the wall and kissed me passionately. \"How is that you look beautiful in whatever you wear,\" he said putting my hair behind my ear and kissing me again. \"And how is it that I have butterflies in my stomach every single time I see you?\" I asked kissing him back. He led me down the hallway to his bedroom where we made love for the second time. Chapter 27 We later took a walk around the grounds about two hours before dinner. Eddie said that he wanted to talk to me about something but was afraid of us being overheard. I was slightly nervous about what he was going to say but I figured it could not be anything bad. \"Paige, I know that you are a very strong and determined girl. Which were some of the characteristics that I found so very attractive, and I still do. But in all seriousness, do you feel that one day you could...\" Eddie stopped and seemed to be getting nervous. \"What?\" I asked. \"Could you see yourself as being my wife?\" He blurted out. I wanted to laugh at seeing him so nervous from asking me a question that I felt had an obvious answer. \"Of course,\" I said smiling at him reassuringly. I watched him slowly exhale a sigh of relief. \"What did you think I was going to say?\" I asked. \"I was slightly worried that bringing this up was going too fast for you, but this afternoon with my mother, I wanted so badly to call you my future wife because I can't picture another girl as my wife. I can't picture my life without you in it,\" he said. \"I can't picture mine without you either,\" I said leaning my head on his shoulder. \"I guess,\" he said leading me to the bench, \"is I know that you would be able to handle all of this. But would you want to? Because I meant it when I said that I'd abdicate the throne for you.\" \"I think that when we make our plans for marriage official; that would be something that we'd have to sit down and discuss. And I feel that after spending some time in the States this summer, we'll be able to make a better decision that we would right now,\" I said. \"And the decision will be what we both want and we both feel is the best. Not simply just what one person wants or feels. Because that is what marriage is all about, making decisions together. But you'd really abdicate the throne for me?\" \"I'd do anything for you,\" he said squeezing my hand. \"But I do have some good news for you.\" \"What?\" \"I already bought our plane tickets for the United States.\" I looked at him slightly confused. \"Parliament is getting out in two weeks. So it's time to spend some time in the United States. Not unless you want to stay here. I'll leave it up to you.\" I smiled and then looked at him. \"States?\" He asked. I nodded and kissed him. Chapter 28[Chapter 2] My days in Denmark were slowly dwindling down to an end (at least for the summer). I had spent about 5 weeks here and I had only one more week to go and then I'd be spending six weeks in United States with Eddie. I was so excited I was practically skipping down the hallway. We'd be able to spend time together without an tabloids, press, Rosalind- \"Paige!\" Rosalind called interrupting my happy thoughts. Why did she always have to ruin everything? \"Yes,\" I said turning around. \"I need to talk to you for a moment,\" she said motioning for me to follow her. My heart started to beat faster as I followed her into her flower room. I sat down on the chair and looked at her waiting for her to hear something. \"I know you think that I don't like you. And I it's not that I don't like you as a person; I just don't feel you are the correct person for Edvard.\" \"If I was of royal descent, would you like me then?\" I asked \"No, probably not. I don't understand what he likes so much about you,\" she said. \"Maybe we could just try to get to know each other,\" I suggested trying to smile even though the thought of that made me want to gag. Rosalind didn't saying anything at first as though she was seriously trying to think about her answer. \"Doing what?\" She asked. Damn it! She didn't turn me down! \"I don't know. Maybe we could just take a walk together, grab a bite to eat, something like that,\" I said trying to sound upbeat. Or maybe you should have turned me down! I thought again. \"You're really not going, are you?\" She asked staring at me with her piercing eyes. \"No,\" I said. \"Then I suppose we'll have to. How's tonight for dinner? And then maybe we could go for a walk around the grounds,\" Rosalind proposed. \"Sure, that sounds good,\" I said smiling even though I was screaming on the inside. Eddie and I had made dinner plans but I guess I'd just have to re-schedule them since I had just made plans with the devil. Ugh. Chapter 29 The day quickly passed and the time came where I needed to start getting ready for dinner with the Queen. I was dreading it like the plague. I heard a slight knocking on my door. Maybe that was her cancelling! I could only hope. \"Come in,\" I yelled. I turned around and saw Eddie come in. This was the only time in my life when I wasn't happy to see him (except for maybe that one time in college when we didn't know each other yet). \"Please contain your excitement,\" Eddie said trying to make a joke. I guess my face showed some disappointment. \"No. I'm very happy to see you,\" I said giving him a kiss on the cheek. \"But I just hoped that you were Rosalind.\" \"Umm...why?\" Eddie asked, confused. \"Because we have this dinner date thing. She wants to get to know me. And I was kind of hoping that was her at the door coming in to cancel,\" I explained. \"Ah, I see. So what about our dinner?\" \"Didn't you get my text?\" I asked. \"No, I left my phone in my room this morning.\" \"Well I was thinking after Rosalind and I are finished, then we can cuddle up, pop some popcorn, and watch TV or a movie or something,\" I said putting my arms around his neck. \"I'm not happy giving you up for the night, but I'm glad that my mother is making an effort,\" he said. \"Well, she tried to scare me again and said she didn't know what you saw in me. And I suggested that she should try to get to know me. And now we have dinner,\" I said putting in my earrings. \"I better get going. I don't want to be late. I'll see you tonight.\" \"Bye, Paige,\" he said. I gave Eddie a kiss good-bye, left my room, and went to go face my fate with my ex future mother-in-law.[Chapter 3] \"Paige,\" Rosalind said as I came down into the dinning room. \"I thought we agreed on 7:00. It's 7:02,\" she said looking at her watch. I was about ready to give her the finger, turn around, and march back upstairs, but I knew that wouldn't exactly help us bond nor would it be very lady like (or princess like) so I bit my tongue, smiled, and walked over to the table and sat down. There was an awkward silence for a few moments and then Rosalind broke the silence. \"So tell me about yourself, Paige,\" she said. \"Well, what do you want to know?\" I asked. \"Tell me what you planned to do with your life before Edvard.\" I knew where this was going. She was going to try to talk me into leaving again, but I was NOT going to let her get to me. \"Well, I planned on going to John Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland for medical school. After medical school, I planned on working as a doctor. I particularly wanted to devote time in the poor countries where they lack regular access to clean drinking water. I guess I wanted to help as many people as possible.\" \"Did you ever want to get married?\" She grilled me. \"Yeah, I did,\" I said not really sure what she wanted to hear. \"When?\" She demanded. \"I mean, I never had a time limit on it. Just whenever I met the right person,\" I said calmly. \"What makes you think Edvard is the right person?\" She asked. \"I don't know how to explain it. It's just a feeling that I have. Like, he's all I think about and he's the only person I want to be with. I can't imagine my life without him. So that's how I know.\" \"And him being a prince has nothing to do with this decision?\" she asked. \"Of course not! We've been over this before! I thought we were having this dinner because you wanted to get to know me!\" \"Yes,\" she said backing off slightly. \"So tell me about your family? Where do you come from?\" She asked, being less confrontational. \"I grew up in Wisconsin. I went to the University of Wisconsin and studied Biology. My parents are Amy and Ben Morgan and I have two brothers named John and Mikey.\" \"Are your brothers married?\" \"No, I'm the oldest of the three. John is in college and Mikey is a rising senior in high school.\" \"What do they want to do with their life?\" \"No idea,\" I replied smiling. John is currently undeclared and Mikey has no idea either.\" \"So you were the motivated one in the family?\" \"I wouldn't say that they aren't motivated. They are, very. But they aren't sure what they want to commit to for the rest of their life. I mean, that's a hard decision to make at 18!\" Rosalind seemed satisfied with this answer. \"Have you ever been married before? Or engaged before?\" She asked. I was very much taken aback by this question. This wasn't us trying to get to know each other- she was trying to grill me about my life. \"Nooo,\" I said. \"Why do you ask?\" \"Well, I saw a picture of you on Facebook with some other guy. You were both dressed up and you had your arms around each other.\" I was trying to think about what in the world she was talking about. But then it some anger crept in. \"You were on my Facebook page?\" I asked. \"But I changed everything to private...\" \"I have my ways and my people helped me,\" she replied showing me the picture. I about laughed when I saw it. I was about five years younger and smiled at the memory. \"You mean prom!?\" I said laughing. \"Prom? What's a prom? Is that the American version of a wedding or a relationship ceremony?\" I began to laugh even harder now. The Queen did not appreciate my amusement at her question. \"And then guy commented on your picture and I quote: \"You are so beautiful. I love you.\" And then you commented back: \"Aww thank you! And I love more!\" She finished glaring at me as I continued to laugh. I didn't know what hit me. I was laughing so hard that I was beginning to cry. \"I don't see what's so funny about this Paige,\" she said folding her hands. \"Prom,\" I said starting to compose myself. \"Is a big dance that high schoolers go to. People make a big deal out of it. You have to get dressed up, get your hair done, you get pictures taken before the dance, go our to eat with a group of friends, and then you always arrive to the prom about two hours late because that was the cool thing to do.\" \"So who is that guy then?\" She asked. \"That guy, was my date for the prom. You're supposed to have a date for the dance. We had dated from my junior year of high school till about the end of the first semester of my freshmen year in college.\" \"Why did your relationship end?\" She asked. \"After we both went to college, I feel like we both changed a lot. Which isn't a bad thing but we both decided that we were better off just being friends.\" \"So-\" she said wanting more information. \"Basically things just didn't work out.\" She seemed somewhat pleased with my answer but dropped the subject. \"I also saw a picture of you and Edvard along with some other people sitting on a blanket outside with other people around you. But you and Edvard aren't sitting next to each other here, why? And where are you at?\" She said showing me the picture. I looked at it and smiled. I remembered that night. \"That was the Maroon 5 concert that we all went too!\" \"What's a Maroon 5?\" \"There are a band. A popular band in the United States.\" \"Why aren't you guys together in this picture?\" She asked. \"We weren't dating yet,\" I replied calmly. \"Why not? When did you start?\" She demanded. \"Like, Eddie and I -\" \"Edvard,\" she corrected. \"Edvard and I,\" I said emphasizing the Edvard part, \"were actually just friends for a while. Like, we were both attracted to each other for a while. I was in that picture. But neither of us wanted to make that first move,\" I replied. \"Why not?\" She asked. \"I think it was because we were both such good friends and someone making a move would ruin that friendship.\" \"Who made the first move?\" \"Eddi...Edvard did.\" \"What did he do?\" She asked. \"He kissed me,\" I replied matter of factly. \"And then what happened?\" \"Um...we started dating?\" I said, not sure what she wanted. \"No, I mean after the kiss.\" \"We kissed again.\" \"And then?\" \"We made passionate love in my family's barn,\" I said trying to be funny but it came out more sarcastic. \"Oh goodness that is what I feared happened,\" Rosalind said shaking her head. \"I was being sarcastic,\" I said. \"But we just kind of took a walk together after that. That was it.\" \"Are you still a virgin?\" She asked staring at me as though she could tell by looking at me. \"Can we change the topic please?\" I asked. \"No,\" she said. \"That's really none of your business,\" I replied sternly. \"So, you're not?\" She inquired. \"Whether I am or not, it's none of your business,\" I sternly said again. She snorted and knew that I was not going to give her an answer. This dinner was horrible and the food hadn't even been served yet. Me and my bright ideas. \"One day you posted on Facebook that you had a hot date with Taylor Lautner. I tried looking for him on your friend list but I couldn't find him. Who is he? And what was your relationship to him?\" I began to laugh again which she did not appreciate. \"He's an actor-\" \"So you have a history of dating famous people or people who are rich?\" She said cutting me off. \"No, I went to go see his newest movie with some friends. It was just something I said to be funny. It wasn't a literal statement.\" \"And I would like for you to explain this picture,\" she said handing it to me. It was me and a bunch of my friends at a college party with beers in our hands. Me and my friend/roommate Beth were posing for a picture together. \"We were at a party and we posed for a picture. We were both 21 which is the legal drinking age in the United States. And that's my friend Beth,\" I said. \"Yes, I know. She was also your roommate, I discovered too.\" Now this snooping was starting to really bother me. Was nothing private anymore?[Chapter 4] Chapter 31 As soon as dinner was over, I excused myself from the table and walked as quickly to my room as possible. A princess couldn't run, only briskly walk. I ran once from my room to the kitchen (trying to avoid Rosalind) but she still managed to find me and yell at me. It was crazy how scary this woman could be. When I opened the door to my room, I discovered Eddie in there. \"How did the dinner go?\" he asked. \"Never again,\" I said and collapsed into my bed. \"That bad, huh?\" he asked. \"You have no idea,\" I said. \"She had her goonies hack into my Facebook account and pretty much questioned me about everything on there. She even printed out pictures and status updates. And then she grilled me on whether I was a virgin or not. It was just so unpleasant. And then during dinner she pulled out more Facebook stuff. It was just...ugh.\" \"What did you say when she asked if you were a virgin?\" \"I said it was none of her business! Like I'd tell her the truth! That'd be crazy!\" He chuckled at probably imagining what she would do if she found out that Eddie and I had made love before. \"I mean, I'm sure she knows or suspects...\" he began. \"I don't really care what she thinks,\" I said getting up to change into my T-shirt and sweatpants. I wanted to be comfy. \"Before you change, I was wondering if you wanted to go see an actual movie tonight. Like in a theater. I forgot that I promised Arabella I'd take her to this one movie sometime this week. Or if you want to stay in, we can,\" he said. \"No, that sounds like a lot of fun!\" I said putting sweatpants away. \"Can I wear jeans and a blouse? Or do I have to keep this skirt and dress shirt on?\" \"My mother would expect you to wear this but dress in regular clothes. It'll help you blend in better. That's what Arabella and I are doing. I'll buy our tickets online so we don't have to technically speak. And you'll need to wear a baseball cap or something.\" \"Seriously?\" I asked surprised. \"You have no idea. And we need to try to get there early so we can go all the way in the back. It's harder for people to see you up there.\" \"Like, what do people do?\" \"You pretty much become cornered where you can't move or leave the theater. It's crazy.\" \"Sounds like it,\" I said pulling out my favorite pair of pants and a casual shirt. \"I'm going to go change and I'll meet you downstairs in about ten minutes?\" Eddie said getting up to leave. \"Sounds good,\" I said. For the first time in my life, I was nervous about going to the movies. Chapter 32 I met Eddie downstairs about ten minutes after he left my room. I had on a baseball cap, my jeans, and a green casual shirt. My stomach churned at the thought of being caught by reporters. \"Ready?\" Eddie asked me. I nodded and we walked over the car. Eddie held open the door for me as I got in. \"PAIGE!\" I heard Arabella shriek in excitement as I got in the car. \"Arabella,\" I said leaning back trying to give her a hug.\"When did you get back there?\" \"I've been waiting for both you and Edvard,\" she said. \"I'm so excited! This is going to be so much fun!\" She said. \"And we need to do something together. Just us girls! I miss seeing you and I feel as though I always miss you at home!\" \"Yes, we should!\" I said smiling. \"Mum says that I shouldn't talk to you but I don't understand because you are so sweet!\" She said squeezing my arm. I was slightly taken aback by that. Of course Rosalind would tell her that. And that would explain why I hardly saw her anymore. \"Is that why I haven't see you yet?\" I asked. \"Oh no!\" She said. \"I just got back from camp! It was a camp in Switzerland where no one knows I'm a princess. So it was fun to be normal for a change!\" \"What type of camp was it?\" \"A music camp! I play the flute!\" She said. She always had so much enthusiasm in her voice when she talked. \"I want to hear you play one day!\" I said. \"Oh heavens no!\" She said. \"I don't like to play in front of anyone who isn't a music teacher.\" \"I understand,\" I said smiling. The ride over there was very interesting with Arabella asking us continuous questions after the other about whether we would get married one day or not, why we called off the wedding, and she wanted to know a lot about me too. I promised her we could hang out sometime soon where we could get to know each other. I know she was just asking out of curiosity, but I hate bringing up the past all the time. It's in the time. Time for move on and forget it. Chapter 33 We pulled up into the movie theater and stomach churned slightly. I prayed that no one would recognize us. I just didn't want to deal with that tonight. I just wanted to have a date with Eddie...and with his little sister tagging along. \"Okay, so here is the plan,\" Eddie said. \"If anyone calls out to you, just keep on walking. Arabella, I want you to walk in front of me and Paige.\" Arabella nodded and I looked at Eddie slightly in a panic. \"Don't worry. We should be fine,\" she said getting out the car. I got too and then Arabella did. \"People will just think we are a family; I hope,\" he said taking my hand. I nodded in agreement but I was terrified on the inside. We walked toward the theater from the parking lot. So far, no mobs. Arabella turned around and looked at me. \"Paige, I have to go to the bathroom,\" she said. I sighed and looked at Eddie for advice. \"Why didn't you go before we left?\" I asked. \"I didn't have to go then,\" she replied. \"Paige you can take her but just make sure you don't leave her,\" he said. I nodded. We were able to get into the theater unnoticed. So far, so good. The ticket lady looked at me oddly and I feared she was going to blow the whistle. \"Are you Paige\" she began to ask. It was in Danish but I understood the Paige part. I put my finger up to my mouth and went \"shhh,\" and smiled at her. \"Please,\" I said. I didn't know how to respond in Danish. \"Behage,\" Eddie said quietly in Danish which I assumed meant \"please\" as well. She nodded in understanding and handed me half of my ticket stub back. \"Thank you,\" I said walking away. \"Tak,\" Eddie said smiling at her. We all walked away before anyone else noticed us and down the hallway to our theater number. \"Paige,\" Arabella said to me. \"I need to-\" \"Oh yeah,\" I said. \"Let's go,\" I said putting my arm around her. We walked to the bathroom and my anxiety of getting discovered just increased a lot. I didn't speak Danish and I wouldn't have Eddie to translate for me while Arabella was in the bathroom. I waited off to the side for her. I subconsciously pulled down my baseball cap slightly more as people came out of the stalls to wash their hands. Arabella came out, washed her hands and we left. Eddie was waiting outside. He was pacing slightly and I could tell that he was nervous about being noticed as well. We almost had a close call in the lobby with the ticket girl. \"Ready?\" He asked. We both nodded and walked to the theater. Eddie took my hand as we walked up the stairs all the way to the top. There were a few people already there but they didn't seem to pay attention to us which was good. \"We made it,\" I whispered as we sat down. \"So far so good. Keep your hats on though,\" he said. I got comfortable in my seat, snuggled up to Eddie, and put my head on his shoulder. \"No,\" he said moving his shoulder. \"Why?\" I asked slightly hurt that he didn't want me to do that. Okay, changed slightly hurt to pretty insulted. \"It's just that,\" he whispered, \"we aren't supposed to affection in public. Hand holding is okay but anything else is...um...considered to be inappropriate for me. Looked down upon. I don't really know how to explain this,\" he said. He could tell I wasn't happy by his rejection. \"Look, I wish I could kiss you now, but I can't. If I were still the prince, I could but as the king,\" he said lowering his voice even more, \"people would be horrified at discovering us kissing in the back of the movie theater or snuggling or whatever.\" He sighed. \"Soren gave me these instructions after you came back. He said I had a reputation to live up to and not to get caught doing anything that would make the public think poorly of me.\" I nodded in understanding and he gave me a quick kiss on the cheek. Being royal seemed like such a pain in the ass. Chapter 34 The movie ended and it was really quite enjoyable. It was in English with Danish subtitles. Not all movies were in English, so Eddie and I were really going to get married, I'd have to learn Danish. And since that seemed where things were going, I guess I better start the Youtube videos on Danish. Eddie instructed us to wait till the theater was empty till we could get up and go. Everyone was leaving except for this one family on the top row as well. I could feel their eyes on us and I looked at Eddie for help on what to do. \"Just wait,\" he whispered. I nodded and pretended to be super engrossed in the credit scrolling down the screen in a language that was completely strange to me. A few minutes later, they finally approached us. They spoke in Danish, but I knew that they had recognized us. \"We are so sorry. But our daughter insists that she has seen this lady on television before,\" Arabella translated for me. The father was motioning to me. \"Your daughter is right,\" Eddie said (Arabella translated). \"This is my girlfriend. She was on \"Good Morning Denmark\" a few days ago,\" Eddie said pointing to me. The parents gasped. \"You're majesty; we are so sorry that we did not recognize you sooner,\" the mother said and once again Arabella translated. \"Oh no! Please, we simply just wanted to go to a movie. It's a pleasure to meet you all,\" Eddie said. They continued to make some small talk and the girl continued to stare at me. I smiled back at her and then she came over and gave me a hug. I was surprised but I hugged her back. She began to speak to me, but I had no idea what she was saying. I smiled and nodded but she seemed like she wanted an answer from me. \"Arabella,\" I said motioning for her to come over and translate. \"She wants to know what it is like to be a princess,\" Arabella said. \"I'm not a princess,\" I said. Arabella translated for me. \"She says that you are,\" she told me. \"Well, then I guess it's different from how I grew up but it's a good different,\" I said. \"She wants a picture with you,\" Eddie told me. \"Are you okay with that?\" He asked. I nodded and got up. The parents took out their phones and took a picture of me and their daughter. And then one with all three of us and their daughter. It's so crazy to be treated like a celebrity when I'm with Edvard. It's so weird because sometimes I forget that he is the Kind of Denmark and I just view him as Eddie- my friend, boyfriend, my best friend from college. The man that I love. Chapter 35 The next day I decided to go walk around the University of Copenhagen; especially their school of medicine. I didn't tell Eddie that I was going; in fact, I didn't even see him in the morning. He was already in Parliament by the time I got up about 9am. I got dressed, went down the kitchen to fix myself some breakfast (I'm not supposed to do that but I don't want to call for someone after breakfast has already been served and in the process of being cleaned up). After I ate, I went up to my room, got my phone and purse and embarked on my adventure. The campus was only about three miles from the palace so I decided to walk. I'm not sure if Rosalind would approve but I could care less about what she thought. Besides, it gave me a chance to get to know the city too. A few people would stop and stare at me as I walked down the street and especially when I would slow down a little bit to take in the scenery around me. However; no one approached me. I was dressed in civilian clothes so maybe that helped me blend in slightly better. I could tell when I was approaching the campus and it was beautiful, even from a distance. Once I got on campus, I spent time just sitting on a bench and looking around at the campus life. Could I really see myself being here one day? Could I really see myself being engaged to Edvard, preparing to be the future Queen of Denmark, and studying to be a doctor? I sat on the bench just pondering their hard questions. It hurt too much not to imagine Eddie in my life. When I mentally pictured my future; he was always in it. I was starting to feel slightly overwhelmed since summer was half-way over and we would have to make a decision on our relationship. I wasn't ready to let go but a part of me feared that Eddie was. I feared I wasn't the right girl for him. And most importantly, I feared that I would let him down and disappoint him. After spending a while on the bench and just thinking, I decided to get up and explore the campus. I really wanted to find the admissions office and talk to someone there. The only problem was, I didn't know where that was and I didn't know who spoke English and who didn't. I found the main entrance to the college. I knew that I had to be close to finding the admissions office. I continued my search and after about forty minutes of aimlessly walking around, I finally found the admissions office. I walked in and the lady welcomed me in Danish. I just smiled and went up to her and tried to see if anyone would understand me around here. \"I was wondering if I could speak to someone about the admission process?\" I asked praying that she would understand. Her face lit up and smiled at me. \"Yes, of course. I thought that was you, Ms. Morgan,\" she said. \"Just take a seat and I'll get a counselor who can help you.\" I smiled and sat down and started to check my e-mails on my phone. My mom had tried calling me twice over the past two days and I hadn't had a chance to call her back yet. Now, she tried e-mailing me. I felt a stab of guilt for not being in touch with her. And if she didn't have to pay for international calling, I'm sure she would have called me several more times than that. \"Come back with me,\" I heard someone say. I looked up and saw a cold hearted admissions counselor in front of me. I knew then that I was truly at a college. I took my purse and went back with her to her office. I sat down and the lady typed endlessly at her computer for a few moments and then turned her attention to actually helping me. \"So how can I help you?\" She asked completely uninterested in helping me. \"I was wondering if you could tell me about the admission process to become a student here,\" I said politely. \"Have you filled out an application yet?\" \"No, not yet. I'm still not sure where exactly I will end up.\" \"Are you interested in undergrad?\" She asked fumbling around with some brochures and papers. \"No, you're School of Medicine,\" I replied. \"You already have an undergrad degree?\" She asked. \"Yes, in biology,\" I replied. \"Where from?\" \"The University of Wisconsin.\" \"I thought you were American,\" she said spinning around to get even more brochures from the shelf behind her desk. \"Yeah, I am,\" I said. \"And you're interested in a study abroad?\" She asked. \"Um...no. Like, I want to be a real student here,\" I replied. \"Do you have your student visa yet?\" \"No, not yet-\" \"Well, that takes about three months to process,\" she said cutting me off. \"Three months!?\" I said surprised. \"What type of visa do you have now?\" She asked. \"Resident,\" I replied. \"So you are living here?\" she asked. \"Kind of sort of,\" I said. \"I'm living her right now but I'd like to attend school here too,\" I said. \"If you were really very serious about studying here, I'd recommend filling out an application by the end of this week as well as one for your visa. If you call and plead your case, you may be able to speed up the process especially since you have a resident's visa.\" I nodded to show that I understood. Then the lady looked at me strangely. \"What's your name?\" She asked staring at my eyes. \"Paige,\" I said. I knew where this was going. \"Morgan?\" She finished for me. \"That's me,\" I said trying to sound calm even though I slightly panicked whenever someone recognized me. \"I thought you looked familiar,\" she said still staring at me. \"Could you please keep this conversation and everything just between us,\" I asked. \"Oh yes, of course!\" She said being understanding. Her stone heart had suddenly been replaced once she figured out who I was. I hates phonies like that. \"If I were you, I'd go ahead and contact the University of Wisconsin and ask for your transcript and proof that you completed your degree. Also go ahead and fill out your application for admission and for your student visa,\" she said handing me a folder full of brochures, papers, and I assumed an application. \"And we hope to see you here in the fall,\" she said standing up. I stood up and she shook my hand. \"It was a pleasure meeting you,\" she said. \"It was a pleasure meeting you too,\" I said starting to walk out the door. My name is Dory. Please feel free to contact me with any questions that you may have!\" She said trying to sound cheerful. \"Thank you and I will. Have a good day,\" I said smiling and leaving. After leaving, instead of feeling excited about the possibility of starting at the University of Copenhagen; I suddenly felt somewhat anxious and fearful that things would not work out. Chapter 36 \"Hey mom,\" I said sitting on a bench again with my phone against my ear. \"Paige!\" She shrieked. \"Finally! I have been trying to reach you and-\" \"I know, I know,\" I said cutting her off. \"I'm sorry mom. Things have been pretty crazy around here and it's hard to remember the time difference too.\" \"Well how are you?\" She asked. \"How's Eddie?\" \"I'm doing just fine and so is Eddie. He's been busy finishing things up with Parliament but he's doing just fine too,\" I said trying to sound cheerful. \"Are you okay, Paige? You don't sound very happy. I know when you are truly happy or not. If you want to leave and come home, then do so. Don't let Eddie or anyone talk you into anything,\" she said trying to be motherly. \"No, it's not that,\" I said glancing at a brochure. \"Then what is it, Paige?\" She asked. \"I just finished talking to an admissions counselor with the University of Copenhagen and I pretty much won't be able to start here this fall. Like, there is a small possibility but it's not very high. I have to get a student visa and that will be the hold-up,\" I explained. \"What visa do you have now?\" She asked. \"I have a resident's visa. It expires at the end of July,\" I explained again. \"I need a student visa to stay and attend school here as well.\" \"So...you're going to stay in Denmark then?\" She asked. I could hear the disappointment in her voice. \"Well, things are looking that way,\" I said. \"Are you guys still going to come back to the States from July till the beginning of August?\" She asked. \"Yes, we are. Eddie already has the plane tickets and everything.\" \"So, I take it things are going well between you too?\" She asked. I knew she wanted to go back to the school in Denmark topic. Or aka, the marriage talk. \"Yes, things are going very well. I feel like we have been closer than we ever have,\" I said smiling to myself. \"We had to go on \"Good Morning Denmark\" the other day.\" \"You're kidding?\" She exclaimed. \"No, I'm really not! It's probably on Youtube,\" I said. \"How did it go?\" \"It was extremely nerve wracking but the interview went very well,\" I said. \"I'm going to have Mikey and Jonny try to find that online. We'll all want to watch it!\" She said. \"So where are you now?\" She asked. \"I'm still at the University of Copenhagen. I'll try to explore and walk around a little bit before I head back,\" I said flipping quickly through a brochure on the School of Medicine. \"Well, I'll let you go and explore on the condition that you promise to call me again before you go to bed!\" \"Yes, mom. I promise,\" I said laughing. \"Love you,\" she said. \"Love you too Mom. Talk to you later.\" \"Bye.\" \"Bye,\" I said ending the call. I got up and looked around. I had no idea where to start. Now I just had to find the School of Medicine.[Chapter 5] Chapter 37 \"Hallo!\" I hear a peppy voice say behind me! Damn it, I've been caught. \"Hallo,\" I say turning around. I see a young girl about my age who has the biggest smile on her face. She begins to ramble on in Danish so I just smile and nod. \"I'm sorry,\" I said when it was appropriate for me to cut in. \"I don't speak Danish. I speak English.\" Her eyes lit up like a Christmas tree. \"You're American!\" She exclaimed. \"I am too! I'm from California. I'm studying abroad here this summer and next fall,\" she said. I smiled at her. It was very nice to be with someone else who was American as well. \"What about you? I thought you were touring the college and that you were Danish. I wanted to practice speaking my Danish and see if you had any questions about the campus!\" She explained. She was super peppy but not in an annoying way. \"I'm touring for now. I'm thinking about coming here this fall,\" I explained. \"Oh! Have you talked to admissions? I can show you the way if you want,\" she said. \"No, I've actually just came from there. Thank you though. They weren't much help though,\" I said trying to make a joke. Everyone knows admissions at colleges don't give a hoot about you. \"I found out that a student visa can take up to three months to process and since classes start at the end of August and it's almost July...I'm a little worried about things not working out,\" I explained. I couldn't believe that I just opened up to this complete stranger about my fear of not getting a visa in time. She could be a plant by the press for all the I knew. I have to watch what I say more closely. \"Oh my! I remember. Getting a visa was the biggest pain the world! The Danish embassy is almost impossible to get through! You call and you can't get anyone to answer. If they do, you can't get anywhere with them. If you e-mail them, you never get a reply back. And if even if were to go in person; they aren't much help! I don't think even the King of Denmark himself could through there!\" She said laughing. I winced slightly at her joke thinking that she was a plant again. But she was laughing so hard at it; I knew that she didn't mean anything by it. I began to laugh too. \"That bad, huh?\" I asked. \"My grandparents are from Denmark. I came back with them when I was in the process of applying for my visa. I stopped in the Embassy and they refused to help me or give me the status on my visa. And when I was in the States, I always tried to call them and e-mail them. It was such a stressful process,\" She explained. \"So your family is what made you chose Denmark?\" I asked. \"Yeah. I grew up speaking both Danish and English. My grandparents were from here and my one aunt moved back here. So I really wanted to see where my roots were from,\" she explained. \"What makes you want to study here?\" She asked trying to keep the conversation going. \"Um...,\" I began not sure how to reply. \"I'm here visiting my boyfriend and I'm thinking I'd like to stay here,\" I explained. \"That's so cool! And romantic!\" She exclaimed. \"How did you two meet?\" \"In school in America. He was doing study abroad,\" I said lying about the study abroad part, although it was partially true. Except I don't think Eddie took classes here in Denmark. He just decided to go to the United States for part of his college. \"That's so adorable! And now you are looking to study abroad here! I love how you two are making your long distance relationship work!\" She exclaimed. \"It wasn't always easy,\" I said. Once again, I couldn't believe I just said that. But her warmness and friendliness just made her so easy to talk to. \"Do they offer classes her in English?\" I asked. \"Yes, they do. When you register for classes just make sure it says \"på engelsk\" which means \"in English.\" But it also depends on your major. What is it?\" She asked. \"I'd actually be coming here for Medical School,\" I explained. \"Oh lovely! I'm pretty sure that department has their classes in English. Most doctors want to learn how to be bilingual. Although, I'm sure you have noticed- most people are,\" she said. \"Yes, I have noticed. It's been nice. Not too much of a language barrier then.\" \"Let me show you to the School of Medicine,\" she said motioning me to follow her. \"It's really such a beautiful campus,\" I commented. \"It really is! I just love it here! Danes are so friendly!\" She said. \"I'm sorry- what's your name? I can't believe I was so rude as not to ask!\" My heart stopped slightly. If she kept up-to-date on Danish politics, I'm sure she'd know who I was then. \"Paige,\" I said quickly. \"And you are?\" I asked. \"Sarah,\" she replied. \"It's funny- I've gone almost my whole life with only knowing Paige in school and now here, the King is dating an American girl named Paige, you're Paige,\" she said and continued to ramble on. She hadn't connected the dots yet. \"Yeah, I heard that his girlfriend was named Paige,\" I replied trying to keep her from connecting the dots. It was nice to anonymous again. \"I think she's a complete bitch,\" she said. \"Pardon my French,\" she said. I was really taken aback by this comment. Did I come off as a bitch to the public? \"Why do you say that?\" I asked. \"I mean, like she comes off as being really sweet. I saw her interviewed once and she seemed kind of standoffish. I saw the footage of her and king being interviewed at the palace outside. You know, when she first came back and there were like hundreds out there swarming the place? She hardly said a word. Rude!\" She said. \"I think she seems sweet. I think she was just very nervous. I think that was the first interview she did with the King,\" I said trying to defend Paige, I mean myself. And also being very careful not to refer to Edvard as Edvard or Eddie. \"I thought of that, but I mean think about it. They were engaged to be married and then she called off the wedding. Then she just re-appears again about about three months later? She just wanted to be a star, be rich, and realized what mistake she made. I think she cares for him but doesn't love him,\" she said walking with so much energy she was almost skipping. \"I mean, I think we won't ever know what is going on in her head. But did you see their last interview on \"Good Morning Denmark? They seemed very much in love. And she also spoke a lot.\" \"Now, I missed it. I was in class when it aired. I've been meaning to watch it online,\" she said. \"I don't know- I just don't feel she reaches out a lot to the public, you know? Even the King has a twitter and the he uses every once in a while. He doesn't tweet a lot, but I remember before she came back, he tweeted: 'My life has had a dull cloud over it until now. I couldn't be any happier. Can't wait for tomorrow.' No one knew what he was talking about, but the next day, Paige was back.\" \"Really, he tweeted that?\" I asked. \"Yeah,\" she said looking at me strangely. \"Why does that surprise you? Everyone knows that he is nuts about her. You can see it in the way he looks at her. I want a guy to look at me like that one day,\" she said. \"Yeah, he is great. I mean, he seems that way,\" I said trying to cover my tracks. This was harder than I thought! \"I heard when Paige left, he went to counseling. That is almost unheard of with the royal family. He must have been seriously hurting.\" Ouch. That really hurt me too. I was really hurting over it too, but I kept it inside more. I was trying to distract myself and focus on school. \"I heard she was depressed after the split too,\" I commented. \"Where did you hear that?\" she asked. \"A magazine. I read it at the doctor's office once,\" I lied. \"How did the public find out about E- King Edvard going to counseling?\" I asked. Wow- that was almost too close. \"Someone caught him leaving and snapped a picture of him.\" \"I think the press just needs to leave them alone. They have private lives too.\" \"I agree. They harass them too much,\" she said stopping in front a bug building. \"This, my new friend, is the School of Medicine.\" I was literally in awe of the building. It was beautifully constructed and just had an good feeling. \"Would you like me to show you around?\" She asked. \"I actually want to go here one day too. I've looked around before,\" she explained. \"I'd love that!\" I exclaimed. Sarah smiled at me and walked into the building together. Walking into the building, I could see myself attending the school as a student. I remember that my old roommate Beth used to always tell me that you couldn't plan out the future. That you had to just go with the flow and see what happened. I completely disagreed and always tried to plan my whole life out. Now, as I walk through those doors, I saw that she was right. I didn't know what would happen between Eddie and I, or where I would go to medical school. And for once in my life, I was okay with the unknown. Chapter 38 \"Hey,\" Sarah said as we left the Medical School, \"do you want to go grab a cup of coffee or something? That way I could show you the student center too,\" she said. \"Sure,\" I said smiling. I absolutely loved the Medical School. I didn't get to talk to anyone but I just walked around in awe. After I left, I dreamed more than ever of being a medical student one day. \"So how long have you and your boyfriend been dating?\" She asked. I knew she was trying to make conversation but I really just wanted to change the topic. At least it was better than the Paige Morgan topic and how she was a bitch. I didn't really like that that much. \"We were like really good friends for the longest time. From when we met in August and then after Thanksgiving we started officially dating, even though we both know that we liked each other way before that. We got into a fight like the day before finals and I was heartbroken. When I tried to go find him to talk; I found out that he had left and gone back to Denmark for family reasons. So, I got a flight to Denmark to visit him and when I left to go back to school after the break, we both felt that the relationship wasn't going to work because of the distance. So we called it quits for about two and a half months. Then we got back together at the end of this past March. We did Skype, phone calls, e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, things like that. It wasn't the same but it was to know that I would see him again,\" I explained telling mostly the truth. Except I left out that we got engaged when I came to Denmark and then I called off the wedding because I was scared. And oh yeah, the fact that I was dating King Edvard. \"Oh wow. So you both discovered that you couldn't live without each other?\" \"Yes,\"I said nodding. \"And even when we weren't together; we still kept in touch briefly. But it hurt, I think it didn't help the healing process.\" \"But maybe that helped you guys get to were you are today,\" she reasoned. \"I never thought of it that way. I think you have a good point there,\" I said. \"So, do you think he's the one?\" Sarah asked. \"I really think he is,\" I said, not hesitating with my answer. \"Aww that's so sweet and romantic!\" \"What about you? Do you have a guy here?\" I asked. \"No. I'm all about flying solo and enjoying my life and fulfilling my dreams. I don't need any distractions,\" she said. I laughed and smiled. \"What's so funny?\" Sarah asked. \"That sounds just like me last August. I mean, those words would have been something I would have said. My friends noticed the chemistry between Eddie and I and they always tried to push us together. I always told them 'I don't need any distractions. I need to focus on my schoolwork and my dreams.'\" I slightly scolded myself for saying \"Eddie\" but once again, it seemed to go right over her. \"Really?\" She asked. \"Yep,\" I said nodding my head. \"But I'm glad I listened to my heart and not my head,\" I said. \"Well, if you think I'd be compatible with someone. I'll listen,\" she said laughing. \"Deal!\" I said. We continued walking and talking until we arrived at Starbucks. \"The bad thing about this campus,\" Sarah said sitting down at a table after we both got our coffees, \"is that everything is a good walking distance.\" \"Well,\" I said sitting down to join her, \"at least that way it keeps you good shape!\" Sarah looked slightly confused for a few seconds. \"Why are some people in here staring at us?\" she asked. Damn it. I looked around. About 1/4 of the people in the Starbucks were looking at us. \"Maybe they wanna see what you are drinking?\" I suggested trying to divert the conversation. \"No...this is just weird.\" \"Just ignore them,\" I suggested. \"I mean, do I have something in my teeth?\" She asked smiling. \"No, you don't. Really, just ignore them,\" I said. She glanced over at the TV. \"I really wish they'd stop all this coverage on the King and his girlfriend. Someone now hacked into her Facebook page and found a picture of her with a beer with a friend at a party. Now they are saying she is an alcoholic,\" Sarah translated from the TV headline for me. \"WHAT!?\" I exclaimed turning around looking at the TV. Yep. That picture that Rosalind had shown me the other night was plastered on the corner of the TV screen. Did she really sell it to the press? \"Oh no!\" I mumbled to myself. \"Why do you look so surprised? Nothing surprises me with that girl. I know we like to think they are normal people like us, but they aren't. Like I said, she comes off as a bitch. And that's probably when she's hung over. I tried to follow her on Twitter and she never accepted it. I wonder what she's like in real life,\" Sarah said sipping her coffee. Damn it. I haven't been on Twitter in months. I bet I have a ton of follower requests. \"I wonder what else she has on her Facebook,\" Sarah pondered. \"Probably things like everyone else,\" I suggested. \"I wish she had a page where you could follow her. Like, I guess some people, like me, feel like they don't know her at all. And that's why everyone has different impressions of her. I found her actual Facebook page but I doubted if I tried to friend her if she would accept it.\" Note to self: make a Facebook page for Denmark. \"I just like to give people the benefit of doubt. I don't think she's an alcoholic,\" I said trying to defend myself again. \"And you never know. She may accept your friend request,\" I said. \"I don't know. And I bet she won't comment on this either,\" Sarah said. \"You really don't like her, do you?\" I asked. \"I mean, her first impression to the people of Denmark was not good. She just stood there and let the King do all of the talking. She barely speaks to anyone and never the press. I know they are trying to contact her all the time. She only did that one interview and that was it.\" \"I don't think she's as bad as you think,\" I said. \"You're always trying to say good thing about people,\" Sarah commented. \"I'm just saying that you never truly know someone from an interview or a picture,\" I explained. \"Well anyway- have you taken Organic Chemistry before? I have to take it next semester and I'm terrified,\" Sarah said. We began to talk about classes and everyone once in a while, I'd glance at the TV to see if they were still talking about me. I wondered if I would ever truly get used to this. I didn't I would. Chapter 39 After having a somewhat pleasant coffee with Sarah; I tried to excuse myself so I could get to the palace in time to have lunch with Eddie. She looked slightly disappointed. \"Oh okay! Well, I've really enjoyed hanging out with you this morning. Let's exchange e-mails or something so we can maybe do this again next time you come on campus!\" She suggested. I hesitated for a second. I still didn't know if she was a plant by the press. But I decided to do it. I gave my e-mail from the University of Wisconsin, not my private one. The press would be able to dig that one up if they wanted to since there was an e-mail directory on their website for the student. She gave me hers and said our good-byes. \"Let me know the next time you come back here!\" She said as I left. \"I will,\" I said smiling and left. Once I got back to the palace, I went up to my room and began to sort through the information that the admissions counselor gave me. I went online and pulled up the application for a Danish student visa as well as the application for admission to the school. If someone last year at this time had told me that I might be going to medical school in Denmark and that I'd be dating the king; I would have laughed, called them crazy and walked away. It's funny how life changes so unexpectedly. I heard a slight knock at my door. \"Come in,\" I said expecting Edvard to come through the door. To my dismay, it was Rosalind. \"Hi...\" I said not exactly happy to see her. \"Paige, I need to talk to you,\" she said sitting down in a chair next to me. \"Okay,\" I said not exactly sure where this was going. I had a feeling it was about the picture on the news. \"Have you seen the news?\" She asked hesitantly. \"Yes,\" I snapped. \"Listen, Paige- I just want you to know that I had nothing to do with that,\" she said. \"Really?\" I said sarcastically. \"Yes! I don't like you but I wouldn't go that far as to hurt you,\" she said. \"Exactly. You don't like me. So why should I believe that?\" I snapped. \"I know the person who did it. And that person has been dismissed. This shouldn't happen again.\" \"Who was it then?\" I questioned. \"One of the men who helped me hack into your Facebook account...\" She said quietly. I had never seen Rosalind this humble before. \"I'll fix this mishap with the press. Don't worry.\" I guess that was her way of apologizing to me. \"Thank you,\" I said softly. \"Also, Soren said that a magazine. It's the kind that all the young people read- but anyway, the magazine wants to interview. And I was wondering if that would be something that you'd consider. But I understand if you don't want to,\" she said. \"That's fine,\" I said. \"Soren can tell the magazine that I'll do it.\" \"Really?\" She asked. \"Yes. Tell him the next time you see him or I may change my mind,\" I said laughing. \"Thank you, Paige,\" she said. She glanced at my University of Copenhagen brochures that I had next to me by my computer. \"Are you-\" she began to ask. \"It's a possibility,\" I said. \"Do you honestly think that-\" \"I don't want to hear it, Rosalind,\" I snapped. There was another knock on the door. \"Come in,\" I said. This time, Eddie came through. \"Well, I'll leave you two alone,\" Rosalind said getting up and walking out the door. \"Did things go better?\" Eddie asked. \"Slightly...not really,\" I said. \"She'll warm up to you eventually,\" he said. I snorted. He came to the back of me, put his arms around me and began to plant kisses from my cheek bone down to my neck. I looked up at him and kissed him passionately. \"I love you so much,\" I said as we broke away. \"I love you more,\" he said kissing me again. I laughed. \"No, I love you more,\" I said kissing him back. \"I'm not sure about that,\" he said in-between kisses. We broke apart and he kept his arms around me. \"The University of Copenhagen,\" he said seeing the brochures. \"Guess where I went this morning!?\" I said. \"Really?\" He said sitting down in the chair next to me and taking my hand. \"Yes, it's very nice there,\" I said. \"Could you...see yourself being there?\" He asked gently. Our future together was still a touchy subject. I think he was afraid to bring it up since the last time he did and gave me ring, I ran out. \"Definitely,\" I said. He leaned over and gave me another kiss. \"Good,\" he said pulling back. \"Because I am not letting you go anywhere,\" he said taking my other hand. \"Well, I'm not going anywhere,\" I said. \"Good,\" he said kissing me again. Eddie stood up and gently pulled me up too. \"Guess what?\" he said. \"What?\" I replied. \"I actually have a two hour lunch break today so we can go out,\" he said. \"Awesome,\" I replied. We walked downstairs together and outside to the car. There, he opened the car door for me and then walked around to the driver's side. \"Where are we going?\" I asked putting my seat belt on. \"It's a surprise,\" he said. Eddie actually took me to an American restaurant where they had hot dogs, hamburgers, and pizza. \"Man,\" I said taking a bite into my hot dog. \"I haven't a hot dog in forever. This tastes so good,\" I commented. \"Glad you like it here,\" he said. \"I talked to my mom today. She was wondering when we were coming in.\" \"Tell her we are all set to come in on June 30th at 10:30am their time,\" he whispered just case we were overheard. \"Got in,\" I whispered back. He reached over the table and took my hand again. He leaned over and gave me a kiss on the cheek. \"Don't tell Soren,\" he whispered. \"Deal,\" I said giving him a peck on the lips. \"Did you get a chance to talk to anyone at the University this morning?\" he asked. \"Yes, I talked to admissions and they gave me some information. And an American exchange student showed me where the College of Medicine was,\" I said. \"Did she...\" he began. \"No, she didn't,\" I said. \"Good,\" he said. \"What did admissions say?\" he asked. \"They told me the process of how to become a student there. The application won't be too hard to process but it's the student visa that worries me. They said it can take up to three months to process. I'm afraid there won't be enough time,\" I said. \"Apply when we get back home and I'll see what I can do to,\" Eddie said taking my hand again and squeezing it. \"Don't worry,\" he said reassuringly. I smiled and took a sip of my drink. At that moment with him hold my hand and staring in my eyes, I had never been so sure before in my life that he was the one for me.[Chapter 6] \"Welcome, Miss Paige Morgan! I'm Charles,\" the magazine interviewer said as I walked into the common parlor in the palace. I learned that this was where interviews were allowed to be conducted. \"Very nice to meet you,\" I said shaking his hand. \"I'm Clarissa,\" the other interview said. \"Very nice to meet you as well,\" I said shaking her hand. I sat down on the couch (where Soren had instructed me early to sit) and waited for them to ask their questions. \"Well, Ms. Morgan-\" Charles began. \"Please, call me Paige,\" I said cutting him off. I didn't mean to cut him off, but I hated people being so formal all the time with me. \"Okay, Paige,\" Charles said. I saw he turned his tape-recorder on and Clarissa was there typing away on her iPad. Probably already starting the article that would be in the magazine. \"So, Paige, what is it like dating the King of Denmark,\" Charles asked. I thought for a minute before answering. \"It's really weird when you put it like that,\" I began. \"I fell in love with him not knowing he was the Prince of Denmark. I just really view him like a normal guy.\" \"Has your opinion or feeling for him changed since you found out he was the prince, but now King, of Denmark?\" \"No. Nothing has changed. I still view him the same way as I did when I fist met him. It's actually hard to picture him as the King of Denmark. If you got to know him, he's the nicest, most down to earth guy, and extremely compassionate.\" \"So, when you guys were in college together, you never saw anything strange or weird about King Edvard that make him stick out from the other students?\" Charles asked me. I thought about it for a minute. \"I mean, he didn't know how to do laundry. I helped him his first time. I thought that was kind of strange but I just thought he was used to his mother doing it for him. I mean, I'm sure there were other people who came to college not sure how to do laundry.\" \"Anything else?\" Charles pressured. \"I mean, I noticed how his confidant always was with him. But I just thought they were really good friends or something. You see people always hanging with the same people all the time, so I never thought anything strange about it,\" I explained. \"Can you tell us about the first time you met King Edvard?\" Charles asked as Clarissa furiously typed on her iPad. \"Yes,\" I said subconsciously crossing my legs. \"I met him in the student center when I was working one night. I served him and he later came up to talk to me,\" I said.\"We never exchanged contact info, but we later had class together in a Shakespeare class.\" \"And then you guys became instant friends or an instant connection?\" Charles questioned. \"We studied together for the tests. He did very well in class and I asked him for help which he did. We also worked together later at the student center. We started out as very good friends, both attracted to each other, but no one wanted to admit it.\" \"Who made the first move out of the friendship circle?\" Charles asked. I thought about it for a moment. \"I think we both did,\" I began to say. \"How so?\" he asked. \"I invited him back home over Thanksgiving break which I believe showed he meant a lot to me. I wanted to bring him back home to my family which I think showed I was interested in him but I wasn't being completely pushy about it.\" \"Well, how did you two finally start dating?\" \"Eddie- I mean Edvard kissed me one night during Thanksgiving break. And after that, it was understood that we were a couple.\" \"You call him Eddie?\" Clarissa pipped in. I nodded. \"Awww, that's so adorable,\" Clarissa said. \"Well, that's what he wanted to be called in America so that's what I am used to calling him,\" I explained. \"What was your reaction when you found out he was the prince of Denmark at the time?\" Charles asked. \"Complete shock and disbelief,\" I said. \"I didn't quite understand what he was saying. It wasn't registering,\" I said laughing. \"How did you find out?\" Clarissa asked. \"The press found him in Wisconsin and I was with him,\" I said. \"Was that the library incident?\" Clarissa pipped in again. \"It was all over the newspapers here,\" she said. I nodded slightly embarrassed. \"Nothing like getting all romantic and having the whole country witness it!\" Charles said trying to make a joke. \"I know, it was pretty embarrassing,\" I said blushing. Clarissa looked at me sympathetically. \"I don't think anyone cared about what you were doing. The country was buzzing about his new girlfriend,\" Clarissa explained trying to make me feel better. I smiled at her. She was trying to be sweet. \"How did you fall in love with him?\" She asked. \"I mean, it was just the small things he would do and everything he'd do. It would always make me fall a little bit more for him until I was in so deep with my feelings that I couldn't resist them anymore. I mean, I resisted falling for him because I didn't want any distractions but that obviously didn't work out too well,\" I said laughing. \"Then why did you end up leaving?\" Charles asked. \"I was going back to school and we both felt that the long distance relationship thing might not work too well. Plus, I was slightly overwhelmed by everything,\" I said telling partially the truth. \"So we decided to take a break in our relationship,\" I lied. \"Is it true that you two are planning a romantic getaway later this summer?\" Clarissa asked. I hesitated before answering. That was technically true. \"Yes,\" I said. \"Can you tell us where?\" she asked. \"I can't,\" I said smiling. \"Not even a hint?\" Clarissa asked in a somewhat teasing way. \"Nope!\" I said shaking my heard and still smiling. Clarissa laughed and continued to type on her iPad. \"Okay, now the people want to get to know you!\" Charles said. \"In our last edition, we asked readers to e-mail questions they would ask you if they could. And these are the questions that we narrowed it down to.\" \"Okay,\" I said nodding my head. \"If you could go anywhere in the world, where would you go and why?\" Charles asked. \"Hmmm...,\" I began. \"That's a really hard question actually! I would have to say Spain since I studied the Spanish language throughout high school and most of my college career. It was my minor. I've always wanted to go there,\" I explained. \"Next question,\" Charles said looking at his phone, \"What is the song that your iPod is tired of playing over and over?\" \"'My songs know what you did in the dark' by Fallout Boy. Also, \"Home\" by Phillip Phillips is played about the same about of times too.\" \"Why those songs?\" Clarissa asked. \"I don't know. Well, the song by Fallout Boy is super catchy and makes me just want to dance. And I feel I kind of relate to the song by Phillip Phillips.\" \"How so\"\" Charles asked. \"Well, it's about moving and starting a new life and making that place your home. So it's easy to relate to. Not just in my situation now, but in situations in the past. It can be relatable to everyone. Everyone has had to step out of their comfort zone and embrace change. That is what this song is about and which is why I love it.\" Clarissa nodded as though she was in agreement and continued to type on her iPad. \"Okay, out next question is,\" he said scrolling through his phone, \"What did you have your degree in?\" \"Biology or Pre-med. I dream of being a doctor one day.\" \"Do you feel that those goals will have to be on hold now?\" Clarissa asked. \"No, I don't,\" I said.\"I still plan on going to medical school.\" \"Where?\" Charles asked. \"Not sure yet. It depends on a few things.\" \"Like what?\" Charles pressured. \"I'd rather not get into it,\" I said. Well, things like whether Eddie and I are together, what schools I get into; I think to myself. \"Understandable,\" Clarissa says. \"What's your favorite movie?\" Charles asked. \"Pride and Prejudice. The Kiera Knightly version,\" I said without any hesitation. \"What is your favorite TV show?\" he asked. \"I enjoy old re-runs of 'Everybody Loves Raymond' and 'The Queen of Kings.' But also love 'The Big Band Theory,' and 'Pretty Little Liars.' The list really could go on and on. But growing up, I loved 'Lizzie McGuire' and I still enjoy seeing a re-run or two. Or ten,\" I said laughing. \"I'm pretty open minded when it comes to TV,\" I explained. \"Do you and King Edvard ever watch TV together?\" Clarissa asked. \"Of course!\" I said. She looked at me like she wanted to me expand on that but did not want to flat out ask me. \"When we were in school together, Eddie and I would watch \"The Bachlorette\" together. He'd come over to the house and me and my roommate were renting and we'd watch it together. Sometimes there would be a big group of us girls watching it together and he'd come and join us. He'd listen to our discussions of it and be understanding when our favorite guy got sent home. I remember once, he was feeling sick so he didn't come over. But he Skyped us the whole time because it was our tradition and he didn't want to break it.\" \"That's so sweet,\" Clarissa commented. I just smiled. \"Another question we have,\" Charles began, \"is have you seen the Harry Potter series and the Twilight series?\" \"Of course!\" I exclaimed! \"I've read all the Harry Potter books and I've seen all the movies. The same goes for the Twilight movies and books.\" \"Team Edward or team Jacob?\" Clarissa asked smiling at me. \"Team Jacob,\" I said without hesitation. \"Our final question for you is- what's it like to be introduced to a life that is so different from your life back in the United States?\" Charles asked. \"It's definitely weird. I don't know if I'm completely used to it yet,\" I explained. \"Like everyone is so interested in who I am, what I'm interested in, my life, my relationship...just about everything,\" I said laughing at the last part. \"It's been a big adjustment.\" \"The other thing we wanted to ask you- was whether you can any comments on the recent statement that you are an alcoholic?' Charles asked. \"It's not true,\" I said calmly. \"Not true at all. That picture that was shown was from a college party that was taken with my friend. And if I remember correctly, that was my only beer that night. I don't think that qualifies me to be an alcoholic,\" I said. \"Do you drink?\" Charles asked me. \"I mean yes, but in moderation,\" I said. Clarissa nodded in understanding but Charles look at me as though he didn't believe me. I honestly didn't care what he thought of me. \"Sorry- I just got a few more questions in,\" Charles said looking at his phone. \"What is your favorite junk food?\" he asked. \"Mozzarella cheese sticks,\" I said without reservation. \"Your favorite book?\" he asked. \" Just Listen by Sarah Dessen,\" I said. \"I bet her book sales are going to go up now,\" Clarissa said smiling. I just laughed and smiled. \"Okay- now this is really our last question,\" Charles said. \"What hobbies do you enjoy?\" \"Hmm...well when I am not in the library studying, I enjoy writing stories, knitting to help relieve stress, and I also sing and play the guitar,\" I said. \"That's so cool!\" Clarissa said. \"I play the guitar too!\" \"I love it,\" I said. \"I was a band geek in middle and high school,\" I said laughing. \"Well Ms. Paige, it has been our pleasure coming here today,\" Charles said standing up. I stood up too and shook his hand. \"The pleasure is all mine,\" I said. \"Thank you for coming out and wanting to do this,\" I said. \"It was a pleasure meeting you,\" Clarissa said shaking my hand. \"It was a pleasure meeting you too,\" I said smiling. They waved good-bye and walked out the door. I plopped down on the couch and breathed a huge sigh of relief. It was all over and it actually wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Chapter 42 \"Paige,\" Eddie said knocking on my door, \"are you all ready to go?\" he asked coming in. \"Go where?\" I asked questioningly. \"We don't leave for the States for another week.\" \"Well, I may have planned a surprise trip,\" he said smiling. I was completely surprised by this. \"Seriously?\" I asked. He nodded his head, smiling. \"Oh my! Wow! This is completely unexpected! I need to start packing,\" I said heading to my dresser only to find everything was missing. \"I came in her earlier today and packed up everything. You see, Paige,\" he said walking over to me, \"I may have told a little white lie. Parliament ended yesterday. While you were at your interview, I was packing up for you and finalizing our trip,\" he said nuzzling my ear. Why did he have to be so perfect? \"So everything is packed up?\" I asked. \"Everything I could find,\" he said laughing. Together, we went through my room one last time searching to see if anything was left behind but nothing was found. Before I knew it, Soren was driving us both to the airport. Eddie decided that flying the normal way was the way to go to be undiscovered in the United States as well as our secret vacation spot. No matter how hard I tried to pester him to tell me where we were going; he refused and told me to wait and see. \"Thank you, Soren,\" Eddie said getting out of the car. \"I'll see you in six weeks,\" he said. \"Bye Soren,\" I said sliding out of the car. \"I'll see you soon,\" I said. I really did hope that this wasn't the last time I'd be in Denmark. \"I'll see you soon,\" he said smiling. Eddie took my hand and helped me get out of the car. He carried most our luggage and only allowed me to carry a back-pack and his carry-on bag. Surprisingly, we made it through check-in without being noticed. The worker knew who we were based off of our ID's we had to present but she tried to show her reaction when her suspicions were confirmed. Security was a nightmare as usual. The lady behind me recognized us and tried to make some small talk with us. I could tell she seemed nervous around us which was a complete foreign concept to me. I tried to help keep the conversation flowing, but it was hard when just stared at us in awe the whole entire time. After what seemed an eternity, we made it to our gate and Eddie handed me my boarding pass. Eagerly, I looked at our destination. My eyes lit up and my heart skipped a beat from excitement. I looked up at Eddie with a big smile on my face. I knew better than to announce the destination out loud. I felt like a little child going on their first big road trip. I looked at Eddie, smiled and gave him a big, tight hug. \"Thank you,\" I said squeezing him. He kissed me on my head and whispered \"you're welcome\" in my ear. I'm sure someone snapped that embrace that we had. I'm sure it will be in the papers tomorrow and the magazine's later. But I simply did not care. In that moment, it was just Eddie and I embracing each other with not a care in the world. We broke apart from our tight hug and walked over to the chair to sit and wait to board the plane to Barcelona, Spain. Chapter 43 I've never been a big fan on flying, but I knew that as long as I stayed with Eddie, would have to get used to it. The take-off always slightly alarms me as the plane banks on it's side. After today, Eddie truly won the award above \"The best boyfriend\" award. Not only was he taking me on a surprise trip to Barcelona, Spain but he would also spend six weeks on his own free will with my family. And our house was no where like his, so it's not like he could simply run in the other direction if he saw someone coming he didn't want to see. He did his best to calm me on the plane ride. He re-assured me over and over again during the take off that we would be fine. After a few minutes of worry and cutting off his blood circulation in his hand again; I took a sigh of relief as the take off came to an end. \"See?\" he said kissing me on the cheek. \"Don't tell Soren,\" he whispered in my ear. I smiled and looked up at him. \"So, can I even do this,\" I said starting to put my head on his shoulder. He laughed. \"Just don't tell Soren,\" he whispered. I smiled and put my heard down on his shoulder and wrapped my arm around his. I could just stay this way forever. The stewardess was making her rounds and eventually came to us. \"Can I get you any...\" she began to say and then trailed off. \"You're highness and Ms. Morgan...I am sorry..I didn't recognize you...\" she said stammering not really able to finish her sentences. Eddie put his finger up to his lip to show her to keep this quiet. \"Of course,\" she said nodding to show her understanding. \"Can I get you two anything,\" she asked. \"I'll have a soda,\" I said looking up at her even though my head was still on Eddie's shoulder. \"Yes, that and two glasses of wine please,\" Eddie said. \"Sure thing,\" she said walking away. I looked at Eddie slightly surprised. He knew what I was thinking. \"I don't care what people think,\" he said. \"You're not an alcoholic.\" \"I love how you read my mind,\" I said rubbing his arm. After my soda and glass of wine, I must have fallen asleep (on his shoulder again) because the next thing I knew; Eddie was slightly shaking me to wake me up and informed me that we had landed. Bienvenidos a Barcelona![Chapter 7] Chapter 44 \"Oh my goodness,\" I said as we stepped out of the airport doors and went outside. The scenery was just amazing. I couldn't believe it. I've been dreaming for so long to come here, and here I finally was. \"Oh my goodness,\" I repeated again. \"Eddie this is amazing. I still can't really believe it!\" I exclaimed. \"I'm glad you're so happy and excited,\" he said kissing my head.\"Wait,\" he paused. \"We aren't in Denmark anymore. So that means I can do this,\" he said kissing me passionately on the lips. \"Oh, look at you, Mr. Rebel,\" I said kissing him back and smiling. We stopped a taxi Eddie directed the driver to the hotel. Since Eddie was the King; he was taught several different languages since birth. I didn't even know all the languages that he spoke, but Spanish was one of them. Except this time, when he spoke Spanish; I understood and could also reply. I took in all of the scenery as we drove through Barcelona to the hotel. It was just absolutely amazing. \"I still can't believe this,\" I said as we pulled up to the hotel. Eddie paid the driver, got out of the car, walked over to my side and opened the door for me. We walked into the hotel, checked in, and took the elevator up to our room. \"Eddie, this is the best surprise ever,\" I said looking at him. \"I knew you'd like it,\" he said leaning in to kiss me. We got into our room and I couldn't believe what I walked into. It was a suite style with a TV, a couch and a fireplace in one room. A small kitchen in the other and the master bedroom was nothing like I had ever seen before. It also had a fireplace and the bed had a canopy with sheer curtain around it. I truly felt like a princess at that moment. \"Oh my goodness,\" I said walking around. \"Come here,\" he said kissing me and lowering me onto the bed where we made passionate love. Chapter 45 Our trip to Spain was filled with taking several pictures, many tourist spots, many nights out, good Spanish food, and even a few shows but before we knew it; it was our last day in Barcelona. We decided to spend it at the beach in Barcelona. \"So, was Spain everything that you thought it would be?\" Eddie asked as we were laying together on a blanket at the beach. \"It was better than I had even imagined,\" I said smiling at him. \"Glad to hear it,\" he said kissing me. \"So are you ready to spend the next six weeks with my family?\" I asked. \"Of course,\" he said. \"It's six weeks, with my crazy family,\" I said laughing. \"Well, we could always go back to Denmark and spend it with mine,\" he said laughing. \"Yeah, you have a good point there. My family is very normal now,\" I said laughing. We spent the day in the water, on our blanket, absorbing the sun and simply talking about everything. We even stayed out to lay together and look at the stars. We were going to make every moment count here. We stayed, enjoying life and each others company until we decided that it was best to return to the hotel. Tomorrow would be the beginning of our new adventure back in my home town. Chapter 46 \"Mom!\" I said waving as Eddie and left the plane terminal and my mother came into view. \"Paige!\" My mother, Amy, said running over to hug me. We embraced and then she turned to Eddie. \"Eddie,\" my mom said giving him a hug as well. \"It is good to see you again,\" she said. \"Good to see you too, Ms. Morgan,\" he said. \"Please, call me Amy,\" she said. \"Where is everyone else?\" I asked. \"They are back at the farm,\" she explained. We walked to the car and I explained to her about everything that we did in Denmark and about the surprise trip to Spain. Finally, my mom asked the dreaded question that neither of us wanted to answer. \"So, what's going on between you two now?\" she asked. \"What do you mean?\" I said trying to avoid the conversation. \"Like what's going on with you two?\" \"We're dating,\" I said. \"No, I mean- how serious are you guys?\" she asked. I looked at Eddie for guidance on this question. \"I think we're both looking at the possibility of marriage,\" he said. I nodded in agreement. \"How high is the possibility?\" she asked. \"Pretty high,\" I said looking at Eddie. He nodded in agreement with me. \"But nothings official yet?\" she asked. \"No, not yet,\" I replied. I looked at Eddie and smiled. Now it was his turn to get grilled by my mother. \"It feels good to be back in the United States,\" Eddie commented. \"I've been really forward to spending this time with all of you,\" he said. Eddie always knew how to diplomatic. My mother seemed pleased by this comment. \"We've been looking forward to this visit too,\" she said. Eddie packed our luggage into the car and then we all took off back to the farm. Seeing all the familiar sights of the United States made me feel right at home. I loved Denmark, but it was not what I grew up with. The United States would always be my home in my heart. \"So, Paige was telling me that we was looking into going to the University of Copenhagen for medical school,\" my mom said to Eddie. I knew she wanted to talk to him, but didn't know exactly what to say. Our relationship had been slightly like a roller coaster ride. First we met, then we were friends, then we dated, then we were engaged, then we broke up, and then we decided to get back together. It's like everything was a part of the climb up the hill, and then we broke up, and descended on the sharp hill down. Now, we were going up and down hills as we tried to stabilize our relationship. \"Yes, she already applied for admission and for her student's visa,\" he explained. \"You didn't tell me that you had already applied, Paige,\" my mother commented. \"I'm not sure if I'll get my visa in time. I didn't want to tell you until I knew for sure where I'd be going for school this fall,\" I said. I felt a stab of guilt. I knew that I should have told her, but the truth was- I knew she secretly didn't want me to leave her and move to Denmark. She would never admit it to me, but I knew that is what she was afraid of. \"What will you do if you don't get the visa?\" she asked. \"I don't know yet,\" I said. \"So tell me more about Spain,\" my mother said changing the subject. And that is what we did the rest of the car ride back to the farm. I told her everything about Barcelona, and secretly wished that we were still there. The reason was because I felt that my mother wasn't exactly welcoming Eddie back with open arms. Chapter 47 \"PAIGE!\" My brother, Johny, exclaimed as I got out of the car. He was running over to me. \"Johny!\" I said running over to him. He hugged me so tight that he picked me up slightly. \"PPAAAIIIGGEEE!\" Mikey said running out of the house. \"Mikey!\" I said running over to him. He also squeezed me tightly but kept me on the ground. Mikey let go of me and I saw both of my brothers staring at Eddie. They didn't seem exactly thrilled to see him either. Or a better way to describe their expression would be that they couldn't believe that he was actually here. \"Hey Frenchie,\" Johny said walking over to Eddie as he getting our luggage out of the car. \"Hello Johny,\" Eddie said extending his hand. \"It's good to see you again.\" \"Oh, come on man! You were a part of the family, and then you weren't and now you're close enough to it- so we hug,\" he said hugging him. I was glad that he hugged him but I was very annoyed at how he pointed our past relationship roller coaster out right away. \"Hey man,\" Mikey said going over to him. \"So what's up with you and my sister now?\" he asked. \"Mikey!\" I scolded. \"Let's not get into this now, please,\" I said. \"What?\" Mikey asked innocently. \"We just want to know, Paige,\" he said. \"We'll explain this later,\" I said as I felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned around and saw my dad. \"DAD!\" I exclaimed giving him a hug. \"Paige,\" he said hugging me back. \"Tell that boyfriend of yours that we all have some questions for him,\" he said. My heart sank a few inches. This was not the welcome home greeting that I had been expecting for Eddie. Chapter 48 Eddie carried most of our bags into the house and up the stairs to my room. He put my bags down on the floor and I walked over to him and hugged him. \"I'm sorry that this homecoming hasn't been the most friendliest,\" I said. \"I didn't expect it to be,\" he said. \"They don't understand how our relationship isn't like others,\" he said giving me a kiss on the cheek. \"Okay, Eddie,\" my dad said coming abruptly into my room. \"You'll be sharing a room with Mikey,\" he said. \"There is a spare bed that we put in there. It's not the comfiest, but it'll do. Also, we all sleep with our doors open at night. Especially you and Paige. If I see the door closed at any time; I will come in,\" he said. \"I recommend that you guys use the bathroom to get dressed,\" he explained. \"Thanks dad,\" I said slightly annoyed. \"And one last thing,\" he said. \"If I catch you bed with my daughter; I will send you back on the next flight to Denmark,\" he warned. \"Yes, sir,\" Eddie said nodding his head. \"Also, keep the PDA to a minimum,\" he said. \"Ready?\" he asked Eddie. \"Yes sir,\" Eddie said taking his bags and following my dad. I sat down on my bed and looked around my room. It was so nice to be back home even though my family was already giving Eddie a hard time. I saw the big envelope from John Hopkins University on my desk. I remember putting it there before I left. Just in case, I had told myself. And now, I actually hoped that I would not have to go there. I wanted to be in Denmark with Eddie. Why did life have to be so complicated? Chapter 49 \"Paige,\" my mom side softly coming into my room. \"Hey mom!\" I said as saw her walk in. She sat down on my bed and invited me to join her. \"I know you don't want to do this and I'm sure Eddie doesn't want to either- but, I just think you both need to sit down and explain things to everyone. So we can all understand.\" I thought about it for a minute. \"Fine,\" I said reluctantly. \"Good,\" my mom said getting up. \"Eddie is already downstairs in the living room. And we're waiting on you!\" My mom said cheerfully. I sighed and got up to follow my mother. Once in the living room, I sat down next to Eddie and smiled at him. He seemed pretty calm about the whole situation. He took my hand. \"No PDA!\" My dad repeated. \"Seriously?\" I asked slightly sarcastically. \"Just keep it to a minimum,\" my dad said. \"Okay, so what do you guys want to know?\" Eddie asked starting the conversation. \"What's going between you two?\" Mikey asked. The rest of my family nodded in agreement showing their support for his question. \"Well, we agree that we went too fast last night with the engagement,\" Eddie started. \"I got scared and overwhelmed with everything that was expected of me,\" I added on. \"And instead of facing my fears, I left.\" \"My life wasn't the same without Paige in it. I missed her day and night,\" Eddie added. \"And I felt the same way.\" \"Once I found out she felt the same way; we decided to get back together and start over, metaphorically, with our relationship,\" Eddie concluded. \"So you two aren't engaged?\" My mom asked. \"No,\" we both said at the same time. \"Is marriage out of the question?\" She asked. \"I mean, of course not,\" I said. \"We just don't want to jump into anything like last time,\" I explained. \"Marriage is definitely a high possibility, but like Paige, we don't want to rush into anything,\" Eddie said. \"Any other questions?\" I asked. \"No, I think that pretty much answers everything,\" Mikey said getting up. I breathed a sigh of relief. Thanks goodness. \"Alright, Pops, I'm gonna go run out to the store. We gotta pick up a few last things for dinner,\" Johny said getting up too. I heard the doorbell ring. \"Hmm...I wonder who that could be!\" My mother said getting up. By the way the she said it; I knew that she knew who was at the door. \"Mrs. M!\" I heard a male voice exclaim as she opened the door. I turned around to see who it was and my heart literally skipped a beat. I look at the guy and made direct eye contact with my ex-boyfriend. Chapter 50 \"Come in, come in!\" My mother said cheerfully. My ex-boyfriend, Aaron, walked through the door and made direct eye contact with me. I could not believe what mother had done. \"Paige!\" he exclaimed, walking over to me and opened up his arms to invite me to hug him. I reluctantly got up and hugged him as briefly as possible. \"Hey Aaron,\" I said pulling away. \"Well look at you! All grown up! You look good,\" he said. \"Thanks. You do too,\" I said. I still couldn't believe he was her and that my mother invited him. Then he saw Eddie and he seemed to be taken aback. \"Oh!\" He exclaimed again. \"Who's this young man, here?\" he asked. \"This is my boyfriend Eddie Williams,\" I said introducing them. I wasn't sure whether to say boyfriend or fiance. \"Eddie, this is an old friend of the family, Aaron Montgomery,\" I said. \"Very nice to meet you,\" Eddie said standing up and shaking his hand. \"Ah! You got a British man!\" Aaron exclaimed. His peppiness was starting to get truly annoying. It was so fake. \"Actually Eddie is Danish,\" I corrected him. \"But the English teach us English, so thus, the accent,\" Eddie said. \"Oh, that's cool,\" Aaron said. He seemed very surprised by Eddie's presence. \"Well, if you'd please excuse me for one minute,\" I said walking out the door. I needed some air. I walked out the door and I wasn't sure what to do. I decided to walk to the barn. Being with the cows and our two horses gave me a sense of comfort. \"Paige!\" I heard Eddie yell when I was about half-way to the barn. I turned around and saw him running lightly to catch up with me. I began to walk toward him. \"What- what the hell is going on in there?\" he asked. \"I cannot believe my mother!\" I said. \"What's going on?\" Eddie asked again. \"My mother has been trying to get us together ever since we broke up. He's my ex-boyfriend. We broke up my freshmen year in college. It wouldn't be so bad seeing him except I know that my mother wants us together again and he does too,\" I explained walking slowly. \"Do your parents not like me?\" Eddie asked. \"I thought they did but obviously not. I guess once they see your true intentions and how much you care for me; they'll like you again,\" I said taking his hand. \"I guess they feel that since things were called off last time; that things won't work out again. \"I think you need to talk with your mother about this,\" Eddie said. \"Oh trust me, I will. I don't care how many guys she invites over to dinner. None will ever be better than you,\" I said looking up at him. \"And there is no girl in this world that is better than you,\" Eddie said leaning down to kiss me. \"At least,\" I said once we broke apart, \"you're mother just tried to scare me off. She didn't invite you ex or exes over to dinner. I give her a lot of credit for that!\" I said laughing. Even Eddie laughed at this. \"Like you, I only have one ex who I dated for a while,\" Eddie said still laughing. \"I've had a lot of relationships that didn't last a month but one that lasted for about one year and a half. She was the one who I told you about before. She just wanted the fame,\" Eddie said. \"Oh my! That's horrible. I couldn't imagine the pain you went through,\" I said. \"It hurt but nearly as much when you...\" Eddie said stopping himself. He didn't have to finish. I knew what he was going to say. \"I guess when you truly love someone and what you have is real, it's a lot harder to let them go,\" I said. \"I was the same way when I left. I thought I would be able to move on, but I just couldn't,\" I said. \"Paige! Eddie!\" Mikey said motioning us to come in. I sighed and turned to Eddie. \"Looks like we gotta get back,\" I said. We walked hand in hand. At that moment, looking at Eddie and having him right by my side, I was never so sure before that he was the man for me. Chapter 51 \"Paige, will you help me in the kitchen?\" My mother asked as Eddie and I came back into the house. \"Sure,\" I said as walked to the kitchen. I looked at my mom. I needed to try to get my words together before I spoke. \"So...I take it that you aren't happy about seeing Aaron here?\" she asked reading my mind. \"I wouldn't mind seeing him except I know that your intentions and his intentions aren't just simply for a visit,\" I said. \"How could you do that!? Here, I bring home the man that I may marry and you bring in my ex-boyfriend of almost three years into the house,\" I said my anger growing. \"I'm sorry,\" my mother said. \"You're right. I invited him over for the wrong reasons. I guess I was hoping you'd see him and you'd change your mind about Eddie.\" \"What!? Why would I do that!?\" I exclaimed. \"I mean, you could live a normal life again. You could pursue your career as a doctor and then practice medicine.\" \"I can still pursue a career with medicine and practice it with Eddie too. I'll be able to do everything I've dreamed of. He won't stop me,\" I said. \"Fine, the truth is- I don't want you to leave and move to Denmark,\" My mom said. \"Mom,\" I said gently. \"No matter how many guys you bring over to dinner; I'm always still going to love Eddie. And if we decide to get married, then that's our decision. There is nothing you can really do about it. But I promise to keep you in the loop always,\" I said taking her hand. \"I'll always be your daughter no matt er where I am or who I'm with.\" \"I know,\" she said. It looked like she was trying to hold back tears. \"I'm sorry- I shouldn't try to interfere in your love life.\" \"Also, could you at least pretend to like Eddie? He noticed you guys aren't exactly thrilled for him to be here,\" I said. \"He broke your heart before,\" my mother said. \"You seem to forget that I called off the engagement. He wasn't going to hold me hostage,\" I said taking the plates to set on the table. My mother didn't say anything but kept on stirring. \"You can rather the guys up for dinner,\" she said. I left the kitchen and walked into the living room where the guys were watching a golf game on the TV. \"Hey guys,\" I said walking in, \"dinner is ready,\" I said. \"It's really good seeing you again,\" Aaron said putting his arm around me. I slowly moved his arm off of my waist. \"Please, don't do that again,\" I said and walked into the dining room. Eddie sat next to me at the table and Aaron sat across from me. He seemed determined for us to get together again like my mom was a few hours ago. \"So, how did you two meet?\" Aaron asked taking a roll and putting it on his plate. \"We had Shakespeare class together. We also worked together at the student center,\" I said. \"That's cool. So are two like engaged? Or serious?\" Aaron asked again. I hated getting the third degree by everyone. \"We're not engaged but we're serious,\" Eddie said. Hearing him say that just made my heart glow and my face glow. He took my hand and squeezed it. \"So what do you do Eddie?\" Aaron asked. \"Are you still going to school or are you working now?\" \"He has an excellent job with the Danish government. He works along with Parliament,\" I said. \"So what did you major in?\" Aaron asked. \"Political Science,\" Eddie replied. Well, he was still working on it but Aaron did not have to know that. \"Cool, cool,\" Aaron said. \"So how do you know the Morgan's so well?\" Eddie asked. It was Aaron's turn to get the third degree. \"Paige and I used to date,\" Aaron said. \"From our junior year in high school till our sophomore year in college,\" he said. \"Freshmen year in college,\" I corrected. \"Oh yeah!\" Aaron said. \"Everyone thought that they would be married one day,\" Johny piped in. \"But I guess things don't always turn out as you plan.\" I turned my head down the table and glared at Johny. \"I knew the day that Paige brought Eddie home on her Thanksgiving break that they were more than friends. They both claimed that they were only friends; but there was a certain chemistry between them. Something that friends don't have. Something that even casual dating couples don't have. But a chemistry between a husband and wife. And since Paige and Eddie are now serious- this doesn't surprise me at all\" my father said. His words really touched me. I couldn't believe that my dad, of all people, admitted that. No father wants to see their little girl taken away by a man, but my father seemed okay with it. In fact, he seemed more than okay with it; he accepted it and embraced it. I smiled at my father and then I turned to Eddie and smiled at him. \"Wow, that's great. I'm really happy for you Paige,\" Aaron said. \"Thank you,\" I said. I knew that my father's words would change the attitude of my mother in regards to Eddie's and my relationship. Johny and Mikey seemed cool with it but hopefully they'd have a better mindset about it seemed as though all the tension had left the table and Aaron realized that even a miracle wouldn't bring us back together. My mother looked over at me and smiled at me and then I knew; that everything would be alright. Chapter 52 \"Eddie,\" my mother said as we all helping help up dinner, \"I'm sorry that I invited Aaron over with the wrong intentions. I shouldn't have done that. I don't know what I was thinking,\" she said. \"No, it's fine,\" Eddie said smiling. He was taking the plates and drying them. He knew that he'd be put to work here pretty much everyday. \"I'd like to start over,\" Mikey said coming over. He put down the pot he was washing then extended out his hand to Eddie. \"Welcome to our home,\" he said loudly and slowly. We all laughed remembering when he did this the very first time he met Eddie last Thanksgiving when I brought him back home with me. \"I don't understand,\" Eddie said going along with the joke and then we all started laughing again. It felt good to be back home. Eddie came over and gave me a kiss on the head as I was putting away the dishes. I turned around and smiled at him. \"Ew!\" Johny said trying to funny. \"Enough with the \"I'm in love\" eyes, Paige\" he said jokingly. \"Yeah! What did I saw about PDA?\" My father said again. We laughed again. \"Hey, if you guys keep at least a five foot distance from each other, at all times, there is no way that you can get pregnant then,\" my dad said. I sighed and looked at my father. He was going back to this talk again. \"Not unless Eddie has-\" Johny started to say. \"JOHNY!\" I scolded and turned to look at him. My family's conversation's could go from funny to extremely awkward in about ten seconds. \"You're not...are you?\" My mother asked softly. I gathered that she had been wondering that. I turned around and showed off my flat stomach. \"I'd say I'm at least seven months, don't you think?\" I said tightening my shirt around my stomach. My family started to laugh again, even my mother. \"Okay kiddos,\" my father started to say. \"Movie starts at ten o'clock sharp. Paige and Eddie, if you aren't there- you be separated from each other. Five feet!\" Eddie turned to look at me slightly confused. \"It's movie night. We always start a movie at ten o'clock. My dad will pop popcorn. It's kind of like going to the movies, without actually leaving the house!\" I said smiling. \"Come here,\" he said leaning in closer. \"I've been wanting to do this ever since we got here,\" he said leaning in even closer. I closed my eyes and felt his lips press against mine in a soft, passionate way. \"You look so beautiful,\" he said stroking my cheek, our noses pressed up against each others. He kissed me again. I heard my dad clear his throat and we broke away. \"That doesn't look like five feet!\" He said. Eddie reluctantly took my hand as though he was afraid that he'd get in trouble for it. \"Just please try to keep the PDA to a minimum, okay?\" My dad said. \"Ew! Where they kissing again!? Johny exclaimed coming into the kitchen. \"Gross! Go get a room!\" \"ABSOLUTELY NOT!\" My dad exclaimed. I ended up smiling and chuckling slightly at that. \"When you guys were in Denmark, did you have separate rooms?\" My dad asked. \"Of course we did,\" I said. \"Do you have proof of that?\" \"Sir, I assure you that we did have separate rooms,\" Eddie said. He was always so diplomatic. \"And your trip to Spain?\" My dad asked. Uh oh. I knew he was going to ask that. \"We...um...had a suite style room but with separate beds,\" I lied. My father looked at Eddie as though he wanted him to confirm this. Eddie nodded too. He knew better than to tell my father we shared a bed. \"Good,\" my father said coming over and patting Eddie on the back. \"Thank you,\" he said. Eddie smiled and nodded. I went upstairs to my room to take a quick shower before the movie started. My love for Eddie had grown so much over the past few weeks. I looked back and I couldn't believe that I had gotten scared when I had him by my side. I loved him more than I even imagined possible. Chapter 53 I came down stairs for the movie right about ten o'clock. I sat down on the couch next Eddie and cuddled up next to him. It was just us in the living room at that moment. \"I love you,\" I said looking up at him and smiling. \"I love you too,\" he said leaning down and kissing me lightly on the lips. I rested my head on his shoulder. I wished I could just stay like this forever. Just the two of us on the couch, cuddling, and kissing. \"Gross!\" Johny said coming into the living room. \"We aren't doing anything,\" I said tossing a pillow at him teasingly. \"Well, that was just in case you thought about kissing or something,\" Johny said. \"What are they doing now?\" Mikey asked sitting down on the couch with me and Eddie forcing me to sit up instead of laying down partially. \"She had her head on his shoulder!\" Johny said. \"FIVE FEET!\" I hear my dad yell from the kitchen. \"Okay guys, this has got to stop. Eddie and Paige are in love. It's okay for them to show their affection to each other,\" my mother said coming into the living room and sitting down on the other couch. \"I'm sure you'll be the same way one day.\" Wow. My mom was fighting for us. I felt so happy. Things were a little rough today but I knew that things would be better the rest of the summer.[Chapter 8] Chapter 54 I woke up the next day completely exhausted. On top of the jet lag, yesterday was extremely emotionally draining- my parents not accepting Eddie, bringing in my ex-boyfriend, and then finally accepting Eddie. It was literally like a cycle yesterday but I just hoped that it had finally come to an end. \"Paige,\" Mikey said slightly shaking me awake.\"It's one in the afternoon. You need to get up!\" he exclaimed. I groggily turned around. Even though it was the early afternoon and I had slept for about 14 hours straight; I was still completely exhausted. \"Please get up because this awkwardness with Eddie and the rest of the family is deafening,\" Johnny said. \"Why can't you guys all get along with him?\" I said slowly getting out of bed. \"Well, we are getting alone with him, but there is just an awkwardness about it all,\" Johnny explained. \"Fine, I'll get up,\" I grumbled. My brothers left my room and I got up and got dressed. I put on a University of Wisconsin T-shirt and a pair blue jeans. I went downstairs and saw that my brothers were completely wrong. Everyone was laughing and getting along just fine. I shot my brothers \"the look\" and they just smiled innocently back at me. \"If we said that things were going great, you wouldn't have gotten up!\" Mikey explained. I grunted. I was still exhausted. \"Morning beautiful,\" Eddie said coming over to give me a kiss on the cheek. \"Good morning,\" I said smiling at him. \"I think you mean good afternoon,\" Johnny snickered. \"Haha very funny,\" I said. \"Paige, as of tomorrow both you and Eddie will be expected to help out on the farm,\" my father said. \"I'll give you guys today off.\" \"Yes, dad. I know,\" I said. \"Since I have today off, can I go meet Beth at the mall for lunch today? She's actually in town visiting her aunt and cousins. She goes back to Milwaukee in a few days,\" I asked. \"Well I'll be heading into town to get a few things around lunch time. I'll just take you then,\" Mikey said. \"Thanks,\" I said. \"Can umm..\" I started to say wanting to invite Eddie but not 100% sure if he was still welcomed amongst my family. \"Wanna come with us Frenchie?\" Mikey asked. Eddie smiled. \"Yes, I would like that very much,\" he said. I sat down and joined my family for breakfast or lunch or whatever you want to call it, relieved that Eddie seemed to be truly accepted by my family. Chapter 55 \"Okay, Frenchie in the back and Paige you want to ride shot-gun?\" Mikey said as we were walking to the car. I was literally on a cloud. Not only was I with Eddie all the time, but I would also get to see my good friend Beth today. We were roommates in college and she was truly my best friend. \"I'll go in the back too,\" I said. \"Oh no!\" Mikey exclaimed. \"I don't want to look in the rear view mirror and see you guys with your tongues down each others throats!\" \"Seriously?\" I said hitting him playfully. \"We're not in high school!\" \"So what are you doing Frenchie? Are you going to go with Paige or are you sticking with me?\" Mikey asked. \"He's coming with me,\" I answered for him. \"Well, I'll probably go into the mall do some shopping,\" Eddie said. \"Shopping?\" I asking, confused. \"Well I want you and Beth to have your girl time,\" Eddie explained. \"Oh come join us! I know she'll want to see you again!\" I said. \"I'll give you guys some girl time and then I'll come and join you later,\" he said. I thought about it for a second. \"Alright. But you better come and join us!\" I said. \"I promise I will,\" he said giving me a kiss on the cheek. We got into the backseat of the truck together. I know Eddie wanted to give us our time to do our girl talk but the truth was, I was really going to miss him for that time. I looked at him and smiled. It occurred to me that I never want to part ways with him ever again. I wouldn't be able to survive it. Then I realize I have no idea what is going to happen at the end of this summer and it hurts my heart. Chapter 56 \"BETH!\" I exclaimed seeing my old sitting on the ledge of the large water fountain in the mall. \"PAIGE!\" She said getting up quickly. More like running. I let go of Eddie's hand and ran over to her as well. We embraced in a big hug both of us smiling from ear to ear. \"EDDIE!\" Beth exclaimed, realizing that Eddie was right behind me. She went and gave him a hug too. \"Hello Beth,\" he said hugging her back. \"It's so good to see you again!\" Beth exclaimed pulling back. \"Same here,\" Eddie said smiling. \"Well, let's all go catch up and eat!\" Beth said. I took Eddie's hand which he hesitantly took. \"Actually, I'm going to do some shopping and I'll come meet you guys later. I want to give you guys some girl time first. I'll come join in about 40 minutes or so?\" Eddie said. \"You can come join us,\" I said. I really didn't want him to go. Every minute with him was precious time. \"I'll be back soon,\" he said kissing me quickly on the lips. I kissed him back and reluctantly agreed. Beth and I walked into the restaurant, were seated, and then the questions that was expecting was finally asked. \"So- what's going on between you and Eddie?\" Beth asked smiling her mischievous smile. \"Right now we are still dating,\" I said. \"I knew that from your e-mails earlier this summer, but nothing more yet?\" Beth asked. \"No,\" I said in a way that showed my desire for us to be more than just a couple. \"We had to go on Good Morning Denmark-\" \"SHUT UP!\" Beth exclaimed. \"Can I Youtube this?\" she asked immediately pulling out her SmartPhone. \"No!\" I said exclaimed, smiling. \"I just found it!\" Beth said holding the YouTube link in front of my face. \"Watch it later, please! I hate seeing it!\" I said. \"I threw up twice before actually going on there,\" I said. \"You know I'm watching the whole half hour later,\" she told me, \"and I'll let you know when I do!\" She said smiling mischievously again. I had really missed her. \"So happened when you were on the show?\" Beth asked. \"We were asked a ton of questions about our relationship. Eddie called us more than just being a stereotypical boyfriend/girlfriend. That it was such more than that. He said we were truly in love.\" Beth put her hands over her heart. \"That is so precious!\" she exclaimed. \"Would you marry him today if you could?\" She asked. I nodded slowly. I didn't even have to think about it. \"Then what happened before?\" Beth asked. \"I don't know. Looking back at it all, I was really feeling overwhelmed from all the pressure and expectations from me. I was afraid of failure and letting Eddie down. And I was having a lot of pressure from his mother to leave. I knew she didn't like me. It all just collided together and I fled. I also think that Eddie and I moved really fast in our relationship together. We just simply needed more time,\" I explained. \"So do you regret calling off the married/relationship back then?\" I hesitated for a second. \"I don't regret it because I think helped both me and Eddie see how much we truly cared about each other,\" I said. \"Well how is he bed?\" Beth asked. \"BETH!\" I exclaimed. \"Is he any good?\" \"This is such an awkward conversation,\" I said smiling and looking down at my menu. \"Well!? Is he!?\" Beth asked again. \"Yes!\" I exclaimed. \"He's fantastic,\" I said laughing. I looked up and saw Beth laughing too. \"Do you think he's the one?\" she asked. \"I really think he is,\" I said. \"You seem really happy,' Beth said. \"It's like- my stomach is always in knots and I have butterflies when I am around him. And I always want to be around him. It hurts to think that we might not be together one day. He's all I think about. He's all I want to be with.\" \"Besides me!\" Beth joked. \"Besides you!\" I said smiling. \"Sounds like the love bug hit you bad,\" she said. \"It's not just the love bug. I truly love him. I can't imagine life without him.\" \"So what's going to happen when the summer end?' Beth asked. \"I don't want to think about that,\" I said. \"I applied to the University of Copenhagen for their medical school. I don't think it will be a problem getting in. But I just applied for a student visa and getting that in time is what I worry about.\" \"What will happen if you don't get it?' \"I don't want to think about that,\" I said becoming slightly solemn. \"I might stay here for a semester. Or I might put off school for a semester and go with him on a resident's visa which I already have.\" I heard my phone beep and I reached into my purse to get it. It was Eddie. \"He's outside,\" I said getting up. Wow that time went by fast. I walked quickly outside to go get him. I took his hand and led to where we were sitting. I excused myself and went to the bathroom to freshen up and then I joined my friends back at our booth. I slid in next to Eddie. \"I was just telling him how he better take good care of you one day or I'm gonna have to come fly over to Denmark and kidnap you,\" Beth said as sat down down. \"Wait- what did I miss?\" I asked slightly confused. \"I was telling him how he better take good care of you one day,\" Beth stated very matter of factually. I smiled and looked at Eddie, still slightly confused. \"It's funny how Paige tried to resist you so hard and fought every feeling she had for you tooth and nail. She was focused on avoiding distraction that I think it became a hobby. I knew she liked you and was very attracted to you but she would never, ever admit it. And now, her face lights up whenever she sees you and she glows when she is around you. She's the happiest that I've ever seen,\" Beth said smiling at me. I was slightly embarrassed but I knew that my friend meant well. She had pushed so for Eddie and I to get together. Now, I knew that she was pushing marriage between us. \"You were really hard to win over,\" Eddie said laughing and turning his head to smile at me. \"Shut up,\" I said slapping him on the arm playfully. \"You didn't exactly leave a good first impression that night when we first met.\" \"Oh is that when Eddie was drunk and told you to take your shirt off? And you sprayed him with the soda hose?\" Beth asked. \"That would be the night,\" I said laughing and Eddie joined me. \"Oh man, it's no wonder you two were destined for each other. You're both horrible at making first impressions,\" Beth said dryly which caused Eddie and I to burst out laughing. \"Well Beth loves to play matchmaker too,\" I explained. \"I had to do something! I knew you were attracted to Eddie from pretty much the moment you meant him, minus his horrible, drunken flirting skills. But once you got to know him in your English class, through work, and when he would just hang out with us; your body language showed it all and how you always seemed slightly flustered around him. I could still see it even though you denied it and fought it! And Eddie wasn't hard to read at all. It was pretty obvious that he was attracted to you. And since neither of you was planning on making the first move; I just had to give it a little push,\" Beth explained. \"My feelings were that obvious?' Eddie said smiling. \"They were pretty obvious,\" Beth said laughing. \"It showed a lot in your facial expressions, they way you would look at her, you always tried to help her and impress her and also, whenever I would invite you to do something with our group of friend- the first question out of your mouth was 'Is Paige going to be there?' And Miss-I'm-never-going-to-fall-in-love can be a pretty good actress and try to hide her feelings but I could see they were still there. She also talked about you quite a lot for someone who she had no feelings toward. So since neither of you was doing anything...Has Paige told you this story before?\" Beth asked. \"No, she hasn't,\" Eddie replied looking over at me. I gave him a sheepish smile. \"Well, I suggested to Paige that she should bring you home for Thanksgiving and when she of course, said no, I said that I would invite you back home. Next thing I know, you were going home with Paige for Thanksgiving.\" \"Is that how that came about?\" Eddie asked me smiling. \"Yes,\" I said putting my head on his shoulder. \"So you wouldn't have done that otherwise?\" Eddie asked. \"I mean, I had actually thought about it, but I was very much attracted to you and I thought that a few days away from you would help me fight those feelings. But when it boiled down to it, I guess I was jealous and I didn't want you to go home with anyone else,\" I said. \"Well, even if I didn't go home with you for Thanksgiving, I was planning on asking you out on a date when you came back. What would you have said if that happened?\" Eddie asked. \"Is that even a question!? I would have said yes,\" I said. \"Even though I was fighting it, I was still really attracted to you not only for your looks but because of your beautiful soul too. So if you asked me, I wouldn't have been able to say no.\" I said. Eddie scooted closer to me, cupped my chin and gave me a quick kiss on the lips. Even though it was quick, I still felt the electricity run through my body and the butterflies in my stomach. We broke apart and I looked up at him. His beautiful blue eyes made me want to melt inside. I put my arms around his shoulders and gave him another quick kiss. I couldn't help it. I looked up at him again and I knew that he would be the only person in the world who I could never live without.[Chapter 9] Chapter 57 \"So, this fourth of July, my side of the family is trying to have a reunion,\" my dad began at the dinner table. \"We're all going up to you Aunt Katherine's house for it.\" Mikey and Johnny immediately groaned in unison. \"Why?\" Mikey wined. \"Do we have to?\" Johnny asked. \"Is there any chance I'm adopted and I'm not technically don't have a blood relation to this family?\" Mikey asked. \"What's the problem with going?\" Eddie asked, seriously confused. \"First of all, it's a 12 hour car ride,\" Johnny said. \"Secondly, we have to get on the road at like 5:00 in the morning to try to beat the traffic,\" Mikey chimed in. \"Thirdly, Aunt Katherine has four kids. She doesn't have a guest room. So we all of the guests get to fight over the couch, the kitchen table, and who gets what spot on the floor,\" Johnny explained. \"And her kids are younger so they are FULL of energy. And I mean full of energy!\" Mikey finished. \"I'll bet you 5 bucks that they still have a few Christmas decorations around the house,\" Johnny said. \"You two stop it! It is not that bad,\" my dad slightly scolded. \"It's pretty bad,\" Mikey mouthed to Eddie. I looked down at my plate and smiled. I honestly wasn't thrilled about the idea either but it would be nice to get away for a few days. I always tried to look at life as an adventure and this was just one of the many adventures, that hopefully, Eddie and I would have together. \"Who's going to take care of the cows and horses?\" I asked. I was truly curious as well as trying to secretly get out of the trip too. \"Good point Paige!\" Johnny exclaimed. \"I hired Billy and Paul, who own the farm down the road, to take care of our animals while we are gone. I'm sure we will have a lot of catch up work when we get back, but at least they will make sure everyone is fed, watered, cows are milked, and things are kept somewhat clean outside,\" my dad said. \"Good try,\" Mikey mouthed to me. I smiled at him. I didn't so much dread the trip, having to help watch after my cousins or enduring the craziness of being there, but I dreaded the thousand questions that Eddie and I were going to be bombarded with. My extended family did not know that Eddie and I were back together. Some of the had met him at Thanksgiving and I'm pretty sure all of them had heard about him. \"Well Eddie, you are going to meet every Morgan soon,\" my dad said. \"I can't wait,\" Eddie said trying to sound diplomatic. \"He won't be saying that if he ever goes to one of my family reunions,\" my mom joked. We all laughed. I was really impressed at how accepting my family had been of Eddie these past few days. Now, it truly felt that Eddie was a part of the family. Sure, they would still give a hard time every once in a while, but they did it in a loving way. I just hoped my extended side of the family would be as accepting of him. Chapter 58 \"What are you doing?\" Eddie said outside of my door. He knocked on it, but my door had to be remained open at all time so anyone knocking was truly pointless. \"Making a packing list for the trip,\" I said scribbling down the things that I needed to pack and the things that I needed to buy for the trip. \"Seriously?\" Eddie asked coming in and walking toward my bed. \"Yes, seriously!\" I exclaimed. \"You'd be surprised at how many times I forgot something as simple as underwear whenever we would go on a trip. Then, I'd have to go out and buy some! The list is a necessity,\" I said smiling at him. \"Well, I've got my list all up in here,\" he said pointing to his head. \"What is on your list?\" I said inching closer to his face. \"Pants, shirts, underwear, toothbrush, toothpaste, comb, gel, shoes, jacket and deodorant,\" he said inching even closer to my face. \"You forgot socks, cellphone, sleeping bag, and pajamas \" I said leaning in to kiss him. \"What would I do without you?\" He said and then kissed me passionately. His lips moved across my cheeks, ears, down my neck and to my collarbone. We were interrupted when we heard my dad coughing in the hallway. We both jumped a part. \"Remember what I said before. If I catch you in bed with my daughter, I will send on the next plane back to Denmark,\" my dad said sternly. \"Yes, sir,\" Eddie said. \"I promise you, we weren't going to do anything,\" I said. \"The door is wide open!\" \"No sneaky business Paige,\" my dad said sternly. \"Promise!\" I said going back to my list. \"Now, go do something other than kissing,\" my dad said walking away. \"I'm sorry about that,\" I said to Eddie. \"It's okay. I'm sure if my mother suspected that we were...intimate, she would make sure that a guard slept with both of us every night,\" Eddie said. I giggled. \"You really think she doesn't...?\" I asked. Eddie hesitated for a second. \"I think she knows but she doesn't know how to confront us about it. My father would be slightly more relaxed about it. Not exactly sure,\" he said. \"When is coming back from that conference in England?\" I asked. \"He actually came back when I left. But he'll be back when we go back in the fall,\" Eddie said. I loved the way that he said \"we,\" but I still worried about not getting approved for my student visa in time.I tried to push it out of my mind and focus in on this perfect moment of just being with him. \"Will you run through the list with me tomorrow morning? There would be nothing more embarrassing than having to ask someone to take to Walmart because I forgot my underwear,\" Eddie said laughing. \"Yeah, that would be pretty bad. My family would never let you live it down!\" I said laughing. He leaned forward and kissed me quickly. \"Hopefully, your dad didn't see,\" Eddie whispered inches from my face. \"I don't think he did,\" I whispered back, smiling. He leaned forward and kissed me quickly again. \"The one thing I do need is a sleeping bag,\" Eddie said taking my hand. I got up and walked over to my closet. \"I think, I have an extra one from my teenage years when I would have sleepovers and I used to go to sleepovers all of the time,\" I said looking around in there. \"Here it is!\" I exclaimed, pulling it out and throwing it at Eddie playfully. \"And you have one too?\" Eddie asked catching it. \"Yes,\" I said pulling out my pink sleeping back from my teenage years. \"Aren't you glad I gave you the purple one?\" I said teasingly, walking back over to my bed. Eddie laughed. \"If we couldn't find another one, would your dad have let us share one?\" Eddie asked jokingly. \"Not in a million years,\" I said putting my arms around his neck. \"He would drive you to Walmart at 3am in the morning if he had to,\" I said laughing. Eddie began to move his hands up and down my back and just stared into my eyes. \"What?\" I asked. \"Have I ever told you how beautiful you are?\" He asked. I blushed and smiled. Eddie still had that affect on me. \"You've mentioned it but it doesn't hurt to remind me,\" I said and then leaned in to kiss him. \"I love you,\" I said in between kisses. \"I love you so much,\" Eddie said pulling me closer to him and kissed me passionately. Once we broke away, he simply held me to his chest and stroked my hair. I laid in his arms and relished the moment of it just being the two of us. \"We should probably start packing,\" I said after a few minutes. We leave the day after tomorrow,\" I said. \"Are you ready to meet the rest of my family?\" I asked. \"Do you think you can handle it?\" I asked jokingly. \"I've had dinner with the Primer Minister of England and his family before as a young, rebellious boy. Apparently, I misbehaved at the dinner, according to the story from my parents, but I haven't been banned from that country, so assume it must not have been that bad. If I could survive that, I can survive your family,\" Eddie said laughing. \"Hmmm...I'm not sure. I'm sure the Prime Minister's family is nothing compared to mine,\" I said looking up at him and laughing. Eddie laughed too. \"I'm really nervous about it,\" Eddie confided in me. \"Really!?\" I exclaimed. \"Yes, I am. I want them to like me. I think your parents are finally coming around to the idea of us but I'm not sure about the rest of their family. I've seen how my mother treats you, and I'm honestly slightly scared.\" \"Well, if it makes you feel any better- your mother wins the cake in that department. They'll probably give you a little bit of a hard time, but I will be there to stick up for you and defend you just like you do for me,\" I said. Eddie smiled and squeezed me. \"Although my extended side of the family doesn't know that we are back together,\" I said hesitantly. \"So, this will come as a surprise,\" I said carefully. \"They don't know about us?\" Eddie asked confused. \"I mean, we are honestly not that close to that side of the family. I don't know who my cousins are dating either and neither do my parents. Now, once someone becomes engaged, then that becomes new worthy sharing amongst each other.\" \"So, did they know about our past engagement?\" Eddie asked. \"Yes,\" I said. \"And then they found out that we split up too about a few weeks after it happened. But maybe if they are surprised to see you again, then they won't have time to think of a bunch of questions to ask you,\" I said. \"True,\" Eddie said laughing. I looked up at him and gave him a quick kiss. Then, I excused myself to start packing because that really had to be done. I wasn't dreading the trip as much as I normally would and the reason was because I would have Eddie there with me. I looked at him and smiled. I truly hoped that we would marry one day and live happily ever after because I couldn't picture my life going any other way. Chapter 59 Before I knew it, it was the day of the trip. My alarm clock promptly reminded me so by buzzing against my wishes at 3:45 in the morning. I groaned as I got out of bed to hit my alarm clock. Last night I moved my alarm clock, knowing that if I had it my bedside, I would hit snooze one too many times. I honestly could not remember the last time I got up this early. I remember staying up this late to study for a test or write a paper, but getting up this early. I think staying up is easier than getting up. My dad made it very clear that he wanted everyone in the minivan by 4:20am and then we would load the van and back out of the driveway no later that 4:30am. We had a long trip ahead of us. From Manitowoc, Wisconsin, going to Knoxville, Tennessee was almost a 12 hour drive. According to Mapquest, the total trip was 11 hours and 51 minutes. I hit my alarm clock and looked in the mirror. I looked like crap. I was exhausted and the day hadn't even started yet. \"Paige,\" I heard Mikey knocking softly at the door, \"Are you up yet?\" \"Yes,\" I groaned. \"Once Eddie gets out of the bathroom, I'm going to shower and get dressed,\" I said. \"Just don't go anywhere near your bed. We all know what happens. You can fall asleep sitting up!\" Mikey said. \"I promise,\" I said looking through my suitcase and going through my checklist one last time. I heard the water of Eddie's shower stop and I got my stuff ready to go. Not being allowed to ever close my door was seriously a pain in the neck. I greeted Eddie with a quick kiss, then I showered and got ready to go. I grab a protein shake to go and made it in the van exactly at 4:20. I opened the hatch and threw my suitcase in there as well as a snack bag since sometimes my aunt's cooking wasn't the greatest. \"Paige, you're in the back with Frenchie,\" Johnny said as I was rearranging the bags and trying to fit mine in. \"I wouldn't have it any other way,\" I said looking down at the bags and smiling. I closed the hatch, went to the side, slid the van door open and went into the back with Eddie. \"A pillow and a blanket?\" Eddie asked laughing at me. \"It's the middle of the night, I'm going back to sleep,\" I said smiling. \"So, we have twelve hours together. What are we gonna do to pass the time? Paige will probably sleep the whole time,\" Mikey said. \"Shut up,\" I said hitting him playfully. \"I'm sure we'll find something to do,\" Johnny said. \"I brought a few books along,\" Eddie said. \"Why would we want to read?\" Mikey asked pulling out his phone. Reading was a concept truly foreign to him. \"Eddie likes to read,\" I said putting my pillow by his leg. I fluffed it up and then I laid down and covered up with the blanket. \"I know! We can play the 'Get to Know Frenchie' game,\" Mikey exclaimed. \"Haha, very funny,\" I said closing my eyes. Eddie began to stroke my hair. His touch felt so good that I almost didn't want to fall asleep. \"Paige, sit up and put your seat belt on,\" my dad said opening the hatch to the van. He was putting in the final suitcases and was doing the final arrangements. I groaned and got up. I put my pillow on top of the headrest, put my seat belt on, and covered up with my blanket again. My dad got into the driver's seat and my mom got into the passenger's side. We were all set to go. \"Hey- you two in the back,\" my dad putting the car into reverse. \"No PDA of any kind back there,\" he said. \"Yes, sir,\" Eddie said. \"Paige, did you hear me?\" My dad asked. \"Yes,\" I groaned. \"And same rules apply at your Aunt Katherine's house as they do here,\" my dad said. \"We know,\" I yawned. Seriously, this was cutting into my nap time. I closed my eyes and fell asleep next to the man that I loved.[Chapter 10] Chapter 60 \"Paige,\" I hear Eddie say, shaking me slightly. I groaned and briefly opened my eyes and saw his sweet smile staring down at me. He stroked my hair gently. I was barely awake. \"PAIGE!\" Mikey yelled. \"WAKE UP!\" I opened my eyes quickly. I hated being woken up by my brothers. \"What!?\" I groaned. \"Frenchie, see what you get to look forward to every morning?\" Mikey commented. \"We're eating breakfast. You gotta get up,\" Johnny explained. I looked around and saw that we were parked in a McDonald's parking lot. It was only 8:15 in the morning. I was hoping that I would have slept through at least half of the trip. \"Poor Eddy,\" my mom said turning around. \"He didn't move at all the whole time,\" she said unbuckling her seat belt. \"You should have see yourself Paige. We turned once and you feel right on top of his shoulder. You never left that spot,\" Mikey said trying imitate me. \"Shut up!\" I said laughing. \"I didn't want to wake her,\" Eddie said. \"Oh, I would have woken her up,\" Mikey said. \"Sorry,\" I mumbled to Eddie and gave him a smile. My brothers got out of the van and then I followed their lead with Eddie behind me. Once we were all out, Eddie took my hand. \"Everyone needs to use the bathroom here before we take off again because I'm not stopping at the next rest stop!\" My dad said as he pulled his baseball cap down and led us into McDonald's. I wanted to laugh. My dad always wanted to drive straight through places with hardly any stops. But the truth was, we were usually stopping at most rest stops because he had to go to the bathroom. We all ordered our breakfast and pulled two tables together so we could all sit together. \"Are you awake yet, Paige?\" My mom asked. \"Barely,\" I said sipping my coffee. \"She's the life the party in the morning, isn't she Frenchie? If you guys got married, you would be stuck with this for the rest of your life,\" Mikey said. I glared at him as I put my coffee cup down. \"I know Paige isn't a morning person. I'm not much of one myself, so-\" Eddie started to say. \"You're a lot more energetic in the morning that she is!\" Mikey said. \"I love Paige just the way she is,\" Eddie said putting his arm around my waist and pulling me closer to him. \"I wouldn't want to change her for the world.\" \"See!?\" I said smiling at Mikey. \"Dude, if you guys ever had to do an early morning interview or something, Paige would probably fall asleep on the chair during the interview,\" Mikey said jokingly. \"Oh no! She did great last time!\" Eddie said proudly. \"Wait- what!?\" Johnny and Mikey said in unison. \"I didn't tell you guys because I knew that you would make fun of it!\" I said. \"Umm yeah!\" Johnny exclaimed. \"She did a really good job,\" my mom defended me. \"You saw it and you didn't tell us about it!?\" Mikey exclaimed. \"Hey, Mikey, I found it!\" Johnny said looking down at his phone. \"Please, no,\" I said. \"I hate hearing myself talk and I hate seeing that interview,\" I said. \"What are we talking about?\" My dad asked, walking over to the table. \"Paige's interview in Denmark,\" Mikey said nonchalantly. \"The TV one,\" my mom explained. \"Oh yes. You did really good on that!\" My dad said. My two brothers were sharing headphones and were laughing occasionally at the video. \"Finish the video in the car and eat your food,\" my mom said nudging them. \"So, was this scripted for you at all?\" Johnny asked putting his phone away. \"No,\" Eddie and I both said in unison. \"That was the first time that I heard those questions,\" I said. \"So- are you two really going to get married one day?\" Mikey asked. I was completely taken aback by this question for a few reasons. First, I couldn't believe that my brother just asked that as though he just asked what the date was. Second, I didn't know how to answer that. Third, I wanted to say something along the lines of \"of course,\" but I wasn't sure how Eddie felt about this. I felt that keeping my mouth shut was the best. \"That is something that we have discussed several times,\" Eddie started slowly. I knew he was taken aback by this question too but he so desperately wanted to please my family. \"I think that is something that we would both like for the future,\" he said smiling at me. I nodded in agreement. \"I complete agree with what Eddie said,\" I said. \"Are we done with the third degree yet?\" I asked. \"We've just gotten started. How else are we going to pass the time today?\" My dad said jokingly. We all started to laugh. \"Now, everyone finish eating! We need to get back on the road,\" my dad motioning for everyone to continue eating. Before I knew it, we had all finished, gone to the bathroom, and were on our way back to the van. \"So, what is going to happen after the summer ends?\" I asked Eddie as we walked hand in hand back to the van. \"Have you heard back from the Danish Embassy or The University of Copenhagen yet?\" Eddie asked. \"No,\" I said looking down at the ground. \"Well, I'm sure it will be good news from both of them,\" Eddie said. \"But what if it isn't?\" I asked. \"Don't worry about that yet. We talk about it and figure something out if you don't get good news from them. If we are determined to make this relationship work, we will figure something out. Promise,\" Eddie said looking at me. \"Alright,\" I said smiling at him. \"Come here,\" he said pulling me closer to him and he kissed me. \"PAIGE AND EDDIE! COME ON!\" My dad yelled. We broke apart, laughed together, and ran to the car hand in hand. Chapter 61 After about six restroom stops, one lunch stop, and only having to stop twice for directions; we finally made it to Knoxville, Tennessee. \"Are you finally ready to meet the rest of family?\" I asked Eddie as we got out of the van. \"I'm excited and a little nervous,\" he confided in me. \"Well, I won't let them feed you to the wild bears around here, so you don't have to worry,\" I said teasingly. \"That gives me a lot of comfort,\" he said laughing. We went to the back of the van, got our bags and then the joined the rest of my family as they waited patiently after ringing the doorbell. \"Oh, they don't want us here. Time to go home,\" Mikey said pretending to turn around. \"Don't even start,\" my dad said sternly. \"BEN! MIKEY! JOHNNY! AMY! PAIGE!\" My Aunt Katherine shrieked opening the door to us. Her husband, Joel, was next to her. \"Hey!\" I said waving. I was in the back of the crew and she hadn't noticed Eddie yet. \"Who's this?\" She finally asked, motioning to Eddie. \"This is my boyfriend, Eddie Williams,\" I said. \"Oh,\" she said. I could see her wheels turning. She remembered our previous engagement and break-up and she was wondering why he was here. \"WELCOME!\" She said going over to Eddie and giving him a hug. \"Thank you,\" Eddie said hugging her back. \"Well, come in everyone! I don't have a bed for everyone- oh wonderful! You brought sleeping bags! I have a air mattress in the office for Ben and Amy and the rest of you can decide to sleep wherever you want!\" Aunt Katherine exclaimed. She always so full of energy. I had no idea how she did it. We were directed to put all of our bags in the office until the evening. That way, we wouldn't be cluttering her house, as she explained it. \"So, you're back with Eddie?\" Aunt Katherine asked gently in the hallway as I was waiting to use the bathroom. \"Yes, we are,\" I said. \"Are you two engaged?\" She asked. \"No, we're just dating at the moment. But it's serious,\" I said. \"Oh wonderful!\" she said putting her hands together. I smiled. I wondered how many more times I would have to explain this. The doorbell rang which interrupted our conversation. \"That must be someone else! I am so excited for this reunion!\" Aunt Katherine exclaimed, skipping off to go answer the door. I laughed. This was going to be a fun few days. \"Paige!\" My three year old cousin, Kayla, exclaimed running to me. I knelt down and I picked her up. \"Kayla!\" I exclaimed. \"It's good to see you again! When did you get so big?\" I asked. Kayla smiled and shrugged. We went into the living room to go greet some more family that was coming in- my dad's sister Lorraine, her husband Bill, and their two children, Brad, 15, and Michelle, 17. We all greeted each other with a hug and a kiss on the cheek. Aunt Katherine's other children, finally came running- Cassi, 6, Nikki, 9, and Gabbi 13. (Kayla was also her daughter). \"Almost the entire gang is here!\" Aunt Katherine explained. About right before dinner, my grandparents came as well as my dad's other sister Sue, and her husband Quinn and their child Marie who was 14. \"Alright,\" I told Eddie. \"Let me introduce you to the rest of my family,\" I said shortly after my grandparents and Aunt Sue and Uncle Quinn arrived. Apparently they carpooled together. \"Hi Grandma, hi Grandpa,\" I said giving them both hugs. \"Paige, it's so good to see you!\" My grandma said squeezing me. \"There's someone I want you to meet,\" I said. \"This is Eddie,\" I said motioning to him. \"He's my boyfriend,\" I said. \"Well, it's very nice to meet you! It's good to see that Paige met someone after that other guy broke her heart!\" My grandma said giving Eddie a hug. \"It's very nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you,\" Eddie said hugging her back. \"He's British!\" My grandma exclaimed. \"No, he's actually Danish,\" I explained. \"You really like the Danes, don't you, Paige?\" She asked me. \"Eddie is the old boyfriend that you are thinking of,\" I said. \"You better take good care of her,\" my grandpa told Eddie. \"Yes, sir. I sure will,\" Eddie said smiling at me. Before I knew it, it was time for dinner. Eddie and I had been getting a lot of stares but not everyone was brave enough to come and ask me who he was. During a quiet spot during dinner, I decided to informally introduce him to everyone. \"Okay,\" I started. \"I'm sure a lot of you are wondering who this is,\" I said motioning over to Eddie. Some of my family members nodded in agreement. \"This is Eddie. He's my boyfriend. We met at school. And he's not British, he's Danish. He was an exchange student from Denmark,\" I briefly explained. Some members of my family mumbled a few things but a lot of them smiled at Eddie. \"And Eddie, this is my family,\" I said. \"Hello, everybody,\" Eddie said waving, being comical. We all started to laugh. I looked over at him and smiled. This was going a lot better than I expected. After dinner, I helped Aunt Katherine and my mom clear up the dishes and put the food away. \"You really like him, don't you?\" Aunt Katherine asked me. \"Yes, very much,\" I said smiling. \"You're smitten pretty bad,\" she said laughing. I laughed and looked over at Eddie. I could see him playing Barbie Dolls with Kayla and Cassi. He really tried to get involved in their game and was really trying to make them happy. I stopped drying the plate in my hand for a second, and just smiled. It was something about that moment that really touched me. I knew, not only would he be an excellent husband one day, but a father as well. Aunt Katherine saw me and started humming the Wedding March as she walked past me. I started to laugh and I shook my head. I walked back over to the dishes and continued drying. \"Cupid hit you hard,\" she whispered to me. I just smiled and continued to dry the dishes. After I finished cleaning, I went over to Eddie and my cousins. Their mom told them to start cleaning up because they had to go take a bath and get to bed. This left me and Eddie awkwardly sitting in the living with the rest of my family. \"So, how did you guys meet?' My aunt Lorraine asked. \"In school,\" I said. \"We took the same class on Shakespeare and we ended up working together in the student center. The next thing you know, friendship turns into relationship,\" I said smiling. \"Is he the same guy you were engaged to a couple of months ago?\" She asked. \"Yes,\" I said quickly. \"You better real good care of her one day,\" my uncle Joel said to Eddie. \"I assure you, I will,\" Eddie said taking my hand. My family sat in awkward silence for a few moments. No one knew what to say or do until my Uncle Quinn started to talk about sports, then everyone seemed to forget about us. I invited Eddie to go through a walk in the neighborhood with me. He agreed and we both got up and quietly left. \"It's nice to just get out of there. I feel like some of them are suffocating us,\" I said as we were walking down the driveway. \"They just don't trust me or know my true intentions. They all just love you and they want to protect you,\" Eddie said. \"Well, hopefully they'll see what a wonderful man you are before the end of this trip. You're surviving so far!\" I exclaimed. \"Yes,\" Eddie said laughing. \"My mother called me the other day. There is apparently another rumor going around Denmark that you're with child. The rumors speculate that you are hiding in the United States until it is born,\" Eddie said laughing. \"And mother wanted to know if they could possibly be true or not.\" I laughed too. \"The tabloids just hate me,\" I said. \"The problem is they have nothing better to report and they are so desperately trying to find bad information about you but they can't find anything.\" \"I have a pretty squeaky clean history!\" I exclaimed. We continued walking and talking around the neighborhood. We were about to turn around when I heard my phone beep. I pulled it out and saw I had a new e-mail from the University of Copenhagen. My muscles tensed up and my heart began to race. I wouldn't be able to handle any bad news. \"What is it, Paige?\" Eddie asked seeing my reaction. \"I got an e-mail from the University of Copenhagen saying that my international application has been processed,\" I said reading to him, \"and I may log in to see my overall status,\" I said nervously. We stopped in the middle of street in the neighborhood as I anxiously logged into my account. \"Well?\" Eddie asked as I was silent for a few moments. \"It is still loading,\" I mumbled. We were both subconsciously holding our breath. If I was accepted, then we would be one step closer to patching up our relationship. If I was rejected, then we would have another problem that we would have to deal with. My heart was pounding in my chest as I watched the website slowly pull up. \"ACCEPTED!\" I screeched and ran to hug Eddie. \"YES!\" He exclaimed, hugging me and slightly picking me up off of the ground so I twirled slightly. \"I'm so excited!\" I exclaimed as Eddie and I broke away from our hug. \"This calls for a celebration!\" Eddie said. \"Yes! This truly does!\" I exclaimed. \"Now, we just have to wait for the Danish Embassy,\" I said. \"I'm sure it will be good news from them too,\" Eddie said. \"I sure hope so,\" I said. He kissed me and then we practically ran back to the house together to share the good news with everyone else. I just hoped that they shared the same joy with us.[Chapter 11] Chapter 62 \"Mikey, Johnny!\" I exclaimed as Eddie and I sat down on the couch. \"How would you guys like to go out for drinks tonight to celebrate something!?\" I asked grinning from ear to ear. \"Mikey, you get to be the DD. You're not 21 yet.\" \"Celebrate what?\" Mikey asked. I saw his eyes slowly move to my fingers. \"I got accepted into the medical school at the University of Copenhagen! It is one of the best in the country!\" I said smiling. \"That's awesome, Paige! Congratulations!\" Johnny said getting up and hugging me. \"Thanks,\" I said hugging him back. \"What's going on?\" My mom asked coming into the living room. \"I got accepted into the medical school at the University of Copenhagen!\" I exclaimed. My mother's face fell slightly. I knew she wasn't thrilled since this meant I would be so far away from her. I understood that, but it wasn't like I was not ever going to see her again. Things would change but hopefully they would change for the better. \"I'm proud of you, Paige,\" my mom said giving me a hug. She was trying to be happy for me even though I knew it wasn't heartfelt. My mom excused herself and went back to the kitchen. \"I think I need to go talk to her,\" I said following her. I walked into the kitchen and I saw my mom dabbing her eyes with a tissue. \"Mom, what is it?\" I said going over to her. \"I just don't like you being so far away from home. I don't want to lose you,\" she said. \"Mom, you're not going to lose me. I'll still be home for the holiday's and I'll still be able to come over and visit. It honestly probably won't be that different than if I went to John Hopkins. If I went there, I would be home for holidays and maybe a few weekends. But most of my time would be spent up there.\" \"But we could still come and visit you,\" she sniffled. \"You can still come to Denmark! And I would want you guys to come and visit too! Plus, I still don't have my visa nor have I been accepted for my student visa yet. Things don't become official until I have them both,\" I said. \"Just make sure you are making the right choice,\" my mom said hugging me. \"I will,\" I said hugging her back. Later that night, Eddie, Johnny, Mikey and I went out to the local Irish pub to celebrate. I also hoped that this helped my brothers get to know Eddie better. \"You know,\" Johnny said sipping his beer. \"If you get Paige drunk or even just tipsy, she will tell you anything you want to know. She'll talk about anything,\" Johnny said laughing. \"Johnny!\" I said glaring at him. \"I'm just trying to help Eddie get to know you better!\" He exclaimed. \"She also gets really loud,\" Mikey added in. \"Thanks guys,\" I said laughing from embarrassment. \"Are you feeling your shot yet?\" Mikey asked me. \"You guys, stop it,\" I said laughing. I was but I didn't want to admit it. \"You seem very happy,\" Eddie said laughing. \"Stop it,\" I said slapping him playfully. The night went so much better than I could have ever imagined. We spent the night having drinks, eating snacks, and playing pool there at the pub. Everyone seemed to be bonding really well. \"You did a good job Paige,\" Mikey said to me as we were leaving. \"What do you mean?\" I asked. \"Eddie is a really good man. You picked well. I'm really happy for you,\" he said. And he must have meant it since he was sober. \"Thanks,\" I said smiling. \"He really is a good man.\" I got into the van and sat by the man that I loved. We got back to the house and tried to be as quiet as we could since the kids were already sleeping and probably some of the adults. It didn't help that I was a little drunk and I found everything to be slightly amusing. I showered quickly and then snuggled into my sleeping bag on the floor. Since my parents were not around, I moved over to Eddie and snuggled over to him. He put his arm around my and pulled me closer to him, our sleeping bags touching each other. \"I love you,\" I said kissing him. \"I love you too,\" he said kissing me back. That night, the first night in a while, we were able to fall asleep in each other's arms. Chapter 63 \"That doesn't look like five feet!\" I hear my dad jokingly yell at us in my sleep. I groan and I slowly open my eyes. The sunlight was slightly hard to look at. I turned my head slowly and saw that Eddie was still sleeping and he still had his arm around me. \"Come on, don't sleep the whole day away. We have a lot to do for the reunion today,\" my dad motioning for me to get up. \"Wake Eddie up too.\" \"Just five more minutes,\" I said closing my eyes. Maybe going out drinking the night before my family reunion wasn't such a good idea. I should have waited to do that today. \"Five more minutes,\" I heard my mom say. I closed my eyes and I think I even fell asleep; however, exactly five minutes later my dad came back to wake us up. \"UP! UP! UP! UP!\" I hear him tell us. I groaned and open my eyes. I slowly sit up. \"I'm up,\" I said rubbing my eyes. \"EDDIE!\" My dad yells. \"Time to get up!\" Eddie's eyes popped open and he slowly sat up. \"Eddie, get dressed, grab something to eat, and we need you outside to set up the tent, tables and chairs for the reunion today. Paige, we need you to help with that too and then later with some of the food.\" \"Yes,\" I said getting out of my sleeping bag and wrapping it up. I got dressed, then came to the kitchen to grab some cereal and then I went out to help with the set up. After about an hour and a half of getting the big tent up and making sure everything was secure, we began to bring in the tables and chairs and then we set up the buffet table. After that, I went into the kitchen to help prepare for the food while the men finished the set up and started cooking as well. Everyone was busy doing something and we knew that the day had just begun. My seventeen year old cousin Michelle and I were in charge of making a chocolate and a vanilla cake for the reunion. \"How do you plan on doing this?\" Michelle asked doing some research on easy recipes. \"I was going to run to the Dollar General down the road and pick up a cake batter mix for chocolate cake and vanilla cake,\" I said laughing. \"Can we do that?\" She asked looking me questioningly. \"It'll be our little secret,\" I whispered to her. I grab the keys to my family's van and Michelle and I headed on the ten mile trip to the nearest Dollar General. \"How do you know that you love someone?\" She asked me after driving for a few minutes in silence after trying to make some small talk. \"When you are in love, you'll just know,\" I replied. \"But how?\" She pressed. \"You know when you can't imagine your life without that person. And he always gives you butterflies. And just want to make each other happy,\" I said. \"And you can imagine being 80 together in a rocking chair,\" I said smiling. \"I just really like this one guy and we've been dating for a while now and I'm pretty sure I love him,\" she said. \"I thought I loved Aaron too in high school but the feeling is completely different. You'll know when you meet the right guy,\" I said reassuringly. \"So, if you marry Eddie, will you move to Denmark with him or will he stay here in the United States?\" She asked. \"We honestly haven't decided yet. It makes the most sense for us to move to Denmark for his...um...job but at the same time we would be able to make a good life here too once we got established jobs going,\" I said. \"What does Eddie do in Denmark?\" she asked. I hesitated. My extended family didn't know that Eddie was the King of Denmark. Only my Aunt Katherine, Uncle Joel and my grandparents knew. I figured that this wouldn't be kept a secret forever. \"If I told you a secret, could you keep it?\" I asked looking at her. \"Yes!\" She said eagerly. \"What is it?\" \"I'm completely serious. I know who knows about this secret so if other people start finding out, I know who talked,\" I said giving her a look. \"I promise I will never say a word to anyone!\" Michelle said eagerly. \"Not even your parents,\" I said. \"I want to tell them myself when the time is right.\" \"Not even them,\" Michelle promised. \"Or your best friend or your boyfriend or anyone,\" I instructed again. \"I promise!\" She said eagerly. \"Oh my goodness! Are you pregnant!?\" She shrieked. \"No!\" I said. \"Then what is it!? Your secret is safe with me,\" she promised. \"The reason I would most likely move to Denmark with Eddie and the reason he left school last semester is because his father passed down the crown to him. Eddie is the King of Denmark,\" I said slowly as though I was trying to present it in a way where she could completely comprehend it. \"Wait- what!?\" She exclaimed. \"You're kidding...right? Is this a joke?\" \"It's not a joke!\" \"You're smiling!\" \"I swear! It is not a joke. Google who the current King of Denmark is and you'll see it is him,\" I said. \"I will!\" She said pulling out her phone. \"Oh my goodness,\" she exclaimed. \"That is him! And here is a picture of you two walking the streets of Denmark together!\" She looked up at me in disbelief. \"So...if you marry him...then you would be the Queen of Denmark?\" Michelle asked. \"Yes,\" I said nodding. \"That is so exciting but yet scary at the same time.\" \"I know. I know. That is why I called of the engagement with him. I was terrified.\" \"But you went back to him,\" she said smiling. \"Eventually love overpowers fear,\" I said smiling at her. \"That is just crazy,\" she said. \"I just can't believe it. We have the King of Denmark sleeping on the floor in the living room with us.\" \"Yep! And he wouldn't have it any other way. Now, don't start treating him differently,\" I said. \"I won't,\" she said.\" Could I come visit you guys in Denmark?\" \"Of course,\" I said. \"As long as it was okay with your parents. Does Eddie have any good looking younger brothers?\" She asked. I laughed. \"No. He just has a younger sister named Arabella.\" \"Darn it!\" I laughed at her. We pulled into the Dollar General, grabbed a box of chocolate and vanilla cake mix, and headed back home. Once home, we got to work together. I went to the pantry to get some flour as Eddie was going there as well to get some supplies and we ended up bumping into each other. \"Look at what you guys have above your head,\" Aunt Katherine said excitedly holding something over our heads. I looked up and saw some wilted mistletoe above us. \"Mistletoe in July?\" I questioned. My brothers were right. She still did have Christmas decorations lying around. \"I found this in the other room! And I just love mistletoe! You guys know what you have to do!\" She exclaimed. I smiled at Eddie as he leaned forward to kiss me on the lips. Some of my cousins cheered and Eddie and I laughed. I was glad that my family was really learning to accept Eddie and truly treat him as though he was part of the family. No one treated him differently or as though he wasn't a part of this family. It was as though he had been a part of our family forever and it completely warmed my heart.[Chapter 12] Chapter 64 \"You look beautiful,\" Eddie said sitting down next to me at our assigned table. \"Thanks,\" I said smiling. I was wearing a black dress that went to my knees along with some heels. I really tried to make my hair look nice as well as my make-up. Even though it was just my family that I had been living with for the past few days; today was the day of the big reunion, and everyone had to to look their best. A few good family friends and a few local family members just came into today and were only staying for the reunion. Even Eddie dressed up. He look very attractive in his blue dress shirt, blue tie, black dress pants and black shoes. Usually, my dad and Aunt Katherine try to mix people up at tables, except for small children, but I guess they both knew that Eddie would be the most comfortable with me. At our table was also my Grandmother and my cousin Marie. \"Welcome to the 17th annual Morgan family reunion!\" My dad in front of everyone. The reunion was officially starting.\"For the past 17 years, the Morgan's have set aside this time during the summer to gather with everyone and to share our lives with each other. Even though we may live far apart from each other, we are still family. We all know that if anyone needed anything at all, we would all be there in a minute. Even though we have some dear friends here who aren't blood related, we all know that would do the same for us too. This, my friends and family, is the true meaning of family. Thank you for being here and let's eat!\" My dad said. We all cheered and some music started to play through the speakers. Apparently my Aunt Lorraine was in charge of the music for the reunion. So far, her choices weren't too bad. We all got up and headed toward the buffet table where we filled our plates and then returned to our tables. \"Did you hear that Paige got accepted into medical school?\" My grandma asked my cousin Marie. \"You're going to be a doctor?\" she asked me with her face lighting up. \"Yes, I will be one day,\" I said smiling. \"Is everything all set for John Hopkins in the fall?\" My Grandma asked. \"Not yet, Grandma,\" I said. \"I'm still waiting to hear back from one more school,\" I said. \"Which school is that?\" my Grandma asked slightly confused. \"Well, I've also been accepted into the University of Copenhagen and their medical program. I still need to hear about whether I've been accepted for a student visa or not,\" I explained. \"Do you really want to leave everything behind and go move into a different country?\" My cousin Marie asked. \"I wouldn't be leaving everything behind,\" I explained. \"I would just be starting a new chapter in my life,\" I said smiling. \"But what if things didn't work out? Then, you would almost have to finish your schooling in Denmark. What if you wanted to come back here? Why doesn't he just stay here?\" Marie asked again. She truly could not understand why I would be willing to leave the country to be with Eddie. \"Marie,\" my grandmother said gently. \"I want to share a Spanish proverb with you. 'They separated from each other. She took the path towards the left. He took the one to the right. But they forgot something. The world is round,\" my grandmother said patting Marie's hand. \"What does that mean?\" Marie asked looking up at my grandmother confused. \"It means that true love will always be reunited with each other, no matter what path someone may take in life. Eddie and Paige went their separate ways before but fate will always bring them back together. Fate will always bring true love together,\" my grandmother said. \"But what if fate brings them together and they decide that they don't want to be together? Don't they have free will?\" Marie asked. \"Yes, that is very true. Fate may bring people together but it is ultimately up to them to get together and make things work,\" I said. We enjoyed the rest of out meal laughing and having a good time and talking about light-hearted stuff. A slow song came on and a few of my family members got up to dance. \"Paige Morgan, may I have the honor and privilege to have your hand for this dance?\" Eddie asked me holding out his hand and smiling. \"You may,\" I said taking his hand and smiling back at him. We began to slow dance in the center with the rest of my family members. He leaned forward and he kissed me gently. \"You look very handsome today,\" I told him. \"And you are very beautiful today. Even more than usual,\" he said. I blushed and smiled at him. Eddie always had a way to make me blush and give me butterflies in my stomach. I always had them around him but today it was especially worse. The song ended and we all returned back to our tables. \"Look at this,\" Marie said showing me a picture that she took on her phone. I looked at it and she snapped a picture of both and Eddie slow dancing. We were both staring intently into each others eyes and smiling. \"That picture is adorable. It shows how much you two are in love. Can you send it to me, Marie?\" my grandmother asked. \"Yes,\" Marie said sending it on her phone. \"And me too,\" I said. \"Will do,\" Marie said. Next, dessert was served and then my Aunt Lorraine got up and talked. \"I just wanted to say what a pleasure it has been to have all of you guys here today. Thank you all for coming out to the reunion. We would like to invite you all to dance, mingle, and there are a few games to play for the younger children. Let's begin the second part of the reunion!\" She exclaimed. \"Paige,\" Eddie said holding out his hand. I smiled and took it and we went out on the dance floor again. This time is was more crowded and a faster song but we still had fun. We literally danced the rest of the day away and when it was about 6 o'clock, the reunion part of the day was over. We all changed and worked hard to clean up as best as we could. At 8 o'clock, there was going to be a concert downtown and then fireworks at 10 o'clock. My family planned on going and so did some of my extended family. With all of us working together, we finished cleaning up at about exactly 8 o'clock. Then, we all got into our cars and went downtown to see the band and the fireworks. After about half an hour, we got to the spot downtown, parked and began our walk to where the music was playing. \"Well, Eddie, you survived the family reunion!\" My mom said as we were walking. \"There was nothing to survive. Everyone was a pleasure to become acquainted with,\" Eddie said. My mom laughed. She had a hard time in the beginning their marriage, I heard, trying to get my dad's side of the family to like him. Now, I was going through the same thing with Eddie's family. Except it was his immediate family. I hadn't even met his extended family yet. We arrived at the area where the band was playing and we set some chair up on the lawn as well as a blanket. \"I brought the good stuff,\" my dad said opening the cooler and handing me, Johnny, Eddie and my mom a beer. Eddie and I sat on the blanket together. I was humming along with the music and sipping my beer. Eddie pulled me close to him and kissed the top of my head. \"I love you,\" he whispered into my ear. \"I love you too,\" I said looking up at him and went to kiss him gently on the lips. I heard my dad clear his throat loudly and we broke away. I put my head down on his shoulder. The band began to play \"Sweet Home Alabama,\" and the crowd cheered. Some people began to run to the front to dance. \"May I have this dance?\" Eddie asked holding our his hand. \"Of course,\" I said taking it and leading him to the front. We spend the night dancing away to fast songs and slow songs. I couldn't have asked for a better night. At 10 o'clock exactly, the fireworks started. My family and I all stood together as we watch the fireworks go off in the sky. Eddie took my hand and he squeezed it. I looked up at him and smiled. \"This is my first 4th of July in the United States,\" he told me. \"And it has been incredible,\" he said. \"We'll have to come back next year to celebrate again,\" he said. I loved how he said \"we.\" It made me really excited for our future together. We looked over at my parents saw that my dad had kissed my mom. \"I guess this gives me permission to do this,\" he said cupping my chin and bringing closer to him. He kissed me passionately and then we broke apart to finish watching the fireworks. We stayed there hand in hand, mesmerized by the fire in the sky. Chapter 65 After the fireworks, we walked back to our car. But just like every 4th of July, we were stuck in traffic for about two hours. We crept and crawled for what seemed like forever. Eddie and I were in the back of the minivan. We were sitting by each other and he had his arm around my waist and he slowly began to move it up and down my waste. Then, he began to slowly kiss my ear but he made it look like he was whispering to me. I felt the urge to kiss him passionately and honestly, do a little more than just kissing and I'm sure Eddie felt the same way. Eddie's lips slowly moved from ear to my neck and he began to plant small little kisses down my neck. \"Eddie!\" I heard my dad say sternly. He was obviously looking through the rear view mirror. \"Sorry,\" Eddie said pulling his head away from my neck. I hated to say it, but I knew that there was a lot of built-up sexual energy between the two of us. I don't mean in regards to sex but in just simple things. Every kiss, other than a simple peck, had to be sneaked in somewhere that my parents would not see. We never got to spend any alone time together. We almost could never cuddle. I knew Eddie really wanted to show his affection for me and I wanted to do the same. I guess being stuck in traffic; you realize all of these things and you have nothing else to do so you try to show your affection for each other. His hand continued to move up and down my waist. I was feeling all tingly where he was touching me. I looked up at him and smiled. He smiled back at me. I moved my face close to him, looked at my dad, and gave in the into the urge to kiss him passionately. I kissed him forcefully and strong. Eddie seemed slightly surprised by my forcefulness but I continued it. I put my hands through his hair and down his back. I couldn't get him close enough to me. It wasn't long until my dad noticed. \"Paige!\" I heard him yell at me. I acted like I did not hear and continued to kiss Eddie. It felt so good to finally be able to kiss him passionately again that I did not want to stop. \"PAIGE!\" I heard him scold. I couldn't pretend not to hear that one. We broke apart and Eddie put his arm around my waist again. \"Sorry,\" I mumbled. \"What has gotten into you two?\" My mother scolded. \"I know your stuck in the backseat of the van but just try to keep your hands and lips to yourself.\" \"Don't make me separate you two,\" my dad warned. \"Because I will,\" he said. \"Sorry,\" I said again. I put my head back as though as I was going to sleep. I put my head on Eddie's shoulder and closed my eyes. He gently kissed the top of my head and pulled me closer to him. The next thing I knew, I was being placed on my sleeping bag. I opened my eyes briefly and I saw Eddie putting me down. Apparently, I fell asleep in the car and Eddie carried me out and put me on top of my sleeping bag. I slept for a little bit and then I got up, showered, and crawled back into my sleeping bag. I scooted to Eddie. He put his arm around me, pulled me close and we went to sleep in each other's arms.[Chapter 13] Chapter 66 The rest of the days went by quickly and the next thing I knew, we were on out way back home. I spent the entire car ride sleeping or reading The Hunger Games. Michelle told me I had to read the book before I saw the movie. I knew my brothers were planning on renting the movie sometime when we came back so I decided to take her advice. \"Paige, are you pregnant or something?\" my brother Johnny asked me about a week later. \"No!\" I exclaimed. \"Why do you ask that?\" I asked. \"Because Eddie asked to talk to dad in private. They are both in his study and they have been in there for a while,\" he said. \"What?\" I asked confused. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I thought you put him up to tell him you were pregnant or something.\" \"I'm not,\" I said sternly. \"I was just wondering,\" Johnny said. About fifteen minutes later, Eddie and my dad came out of his office. I was making myself some lunch as Eddie came over to me. \"Is everything okay?\" I asked him as he put his arms around me and kissed my cheek. I was surprised my dad didn't say anything to him about that. \"Yes, everything is just fine. Your dad and I just needed a man to to man chat.\" \"Are you sure everything is okay?\" I asked turning around. \"Positive,\" he said cupping my chin and kissing me passionately. Once again, my dad didn't say anything. I was kind of in shock. \"How would you like to go out on a date tonight? Just you and me?\" Eddie asked me. \"Yeah, I'd love that,\" I said looking up at him eagerly. \"I'm not sure how my dad would feel-\" \"I already cleared it with him. That was what we were talking about in his study. I have permission to take you out on a date tonight,\" he said leaning in to kiss me again. \"Seriously?\" I asked looking up at him again. \"Yes. Except this date you're going to have to drive since I don't have an license for this country,\" he said laughing. \"I think that will be okay,\" I said smiling. \"But I can still open the door for you,\" he said smiling. \"Deal,\" I said giving him a peck on the cheek. I couldn't wait for our date tonight. It would be so nice to finally have some alone time with Eddie. Around 5 o'clock, I started to get ready for our date. I put on black dress skirt, a fashionable, feminine, short-sleeve blouse, and high heeled black, open-toed shoes. I curled my hair and spent extra time on my make-up. I looked in the mirror to see my overall appearance and that was when Eddie knocked on my door to \"pick me up.\" \"Are you ready?\" he asked knocking on my door. \"Yes,\" I said turning around smiling. \"You look gorgeous,\" he said smiling at me. \"You look pretty handsome yourself,\" I said. I walked over to the door and we linked arms together and walked downstairs. \"Let me get a quick picture,\" my mother said pulling out her phone. I was slightly confused but we stopped halfway down the stairs and posed together. \"This is just a date. It's not prom,\" I said laughing and coming down the rest of the stairs. \"These pictures will mean a lot one day,\" my mother said hugging me. \"Have fun tonight Paige. But not too much fun,\" he said giving me a hug too. \"Yes, daddy,\" I said hugging him back and smiling. \"Take good care of her,\" my father said hugging Eddie. This surprised me slightly. Maybe the two of them should have had a chat way earlier in the summer. \"I will sir,\" Eddie said. \"What time do you want us home tonight?\" I asked. \"Don't worry about it. Have fun tonight. Just don't come home in the middle of the night,\" my dad said. \"Seriously?\" I asked. \"Is he sick or something?\" I asked turning to my mother. My mother just shook her head and smiled. \"Thanks,\" I said smiling at my dad. Eddie and I left the house arm in arm and went out on our date. \"We finally got out of the house,\" I said smiling at him as we were walking to the car. \"Yes,\" Eddie said smiling. \"You and my dad should have talked a long time ago!\" I exclaimed. \"He was so chill with everything!\" Eddie chuckled, kissed me and opened the driver's side to the truck for me. \"Alright! Let's officially start this date!\" I exclaimed as I started the engine. \"Have you heard back from the Danish Embassy yet?\" Eddie asked me. \"Not yet,\" I said. \"I was thinking about calling them since I have to give John Hopkins an answer. I don't want to lose my spot.\" \"Do you want to come back to Denmark with me in August?\" he asked. \"Of course!\" I exclaimed. \"I just don't want to tell John Hopkins that I'm not coming there until everything is official with the University of Copenhagen,\" I said.\"I mean University of Copenhagen is my first choice but if I had to go to John Hopkins, I was thinking that I would get an apartment up there with another girl and when Parliament is in recess, maybe you could come and stay with us as the worst case scenario for a semester until I could transfer to Denmark,\" I said. \"You've really thought this through,\" he said. \"I have. I don't want to lose you again,\" I said gently squeezing his hand for a minute. \"Well, that plan would work but I'm still trying to remain optimistic for plan A,\" he said smiling. \"Me too,\" I said smiling back at him. \"So, we are we going to eat?\" he asked me. \"It's a surprise,\" I said smiling, doing the exact same thing he did to me while I was in Denmark. He chuckled. \"It's so nice to finally be alone,\" I said. \"I hate having our every move watched by my parents!\" I said. \"Yes, it is really nice to be alone again,\" he said smiling. I pulled into a park that had already closed for the night and parked in an area with lots of trees and bushes. I unbuckled my seat belt and crawled onto his lap. I began to kiss him passionately and forcefully. \"Do you want to go in the backseat or stay here?\" I asked between kisses, unbuttoning his shirt, his hands moving up and down my body. He kissed me back forcefully and he removed his shirt. Then, I began to work on my shirt and he suddenly stopped me. \"I promised your dad we wouldn't have sex if I took you out,\" Eddie said stopping me and looking in my eyes. \"You're kidding me,\" I said looking at him. \"He already thought this through. As much as I'd like to make love to you, I really want to keep that promise to your dad. He's trusting me,\" Eddie said. \"Sometimes you're too good,\" I said buttoning up my shirt and going back to the drivers seat. \"You're like every parents dream boyfriend for their daughter. Are you sure you aren't feeling rebellious tonight?\" I asked starting the car up again. \"I promised him. Besides, I'm still slightly worried that he may find out,\" Eddie said putting his shirt back on and chuckling. \"You're right on that one,\" I said pulling out of the park and getting back onto the road. \"He knows what is on the agenda for tonight. Even though we don't have a curfew, if we are gone too long, he might get suspicious,\" Eddie said. \"You're right,\" I said sighing.\"Was fooling around prohibited tonight too?\" I asked. \"The only thing your dad said I was allowed to do was to passionately kiss you fully clothed,\" Eddie said. \"Hmmm...how can we search for a loophole with that one?\" I asked. \"We can't,\" Eddie said laughing. \"I even have to text your dad throughout the night and check in every once in a while. He wants to know when we will be on our way home,\" Eddie said. \"You're kidding!\" I exclaimed. \"Well, I'm sure my dad would really appreciate you keeping your promise,\" I said. \"Couldn't you have negotiated this at all?\" I asked. Eddie burst out laughing. \"This is your dad we are talking about,\" he said. \"Sorry! Stupid question,\" I said and started to laugh with him. I pulled into Olive Garden which was where I thought we could eat together tonight. \"Is this okay?\" I asked him. \"Perfect,\" he said leaning over and kissing me on the cheek. We went inside, waited for our table and then we were seated. \"So, what else is on the agenda for tonight?\" I asked Eddie. \"Well, since you're driving, I guess I have to tell you. I was hoping we could go to that mini-golf place. It's something that we've never done. After that, I was thinking we could end our date with some ice cream at Dairy Queen. What do you think of that?\" he asked. \"Sounds perfect!\" I exclaimed. \"I'm really good at mini-golf,\" I warned. \"I've never played mini-golf before,\" he said. \"I've played only real golf before,\" he said. \"Well, mini-golf is a lot more fun!\" I said smiling. We ordered our drinks and our food. Eddie ordered a glass of wine but I didn't since I was the one driving. Eddie seemed slightly tense. \"What is it?\" I asked reaching across the table and taking his hand. \"What do you mean?\" he asked. \"You seem tense,\" I said. \"Aren't you having a good time?\" I asked. \"I'm not tense,\" he said smiling at me. \"I was just thinking about how much fun we are going to have tonight,\" he said leaning over and giving me a peck on the lips. I accepted his answer but I noticed that he still seemed slightly tense. I wasn't sure why though. \"You know, I would never stop you from accomplishing your dreams,\" Eddie blurted out. \"Of course, I know that,\" I said smiling. We ate dinner having a wonderful, light-hearted conversation just about everything. We laughed a lot, we smiled a lot, and I think we both realized that we were meant to be together forever. Chapter 67 \"Alright,\" I said showing Eddie how to properly hold hold his club for mini-golf. \"You hold it like this and then you gently swing,\" I said demonstrating for him. \"Mini-golf is pretty different than real golf,\" Eddie commented. \"Yeah, it is,\" I said. \"I warned you that you were about to get you butt kicked at dinner,\" I said smiling at him. \"The evening is till young,\" he said kissing me quickly on the lips. There was still something bothering him and he was acting slightly tense. I could feel it in his kiss. \"What's wrong babe?\" I asked rubbing my hands up and down his shirt, looking up at him. \"Everything is perfect. Nothing is wrong,\" he said leaning down to kiss me again. \"Are you sure?\" I asked seriously, looking up into his deep, blue eyes. \"Yes,\" he said smiling although he wasn't very convincing. I just looked at him concerned with my big, brown eyes. \"You know me too well,\" he said caving in slightly. \"I've known you well enough for a while to know when something is wrong,\" I said looking at him concerned. He hesitated for a minute. \"Sometimes...I wonder...if I'm good enough for you. I wonder if you deserve better,\" he said. \"What!?\" I exclaimed. \"Eddie, this is crazy talk! What is really bothering you?\" I asked. \"I don't want to ever lose you from my life,\" he said looking down seriously at me. \"I love you Paige Morgan, and I want you to be with me for the rest of my life,\" he said seriously. \"Well, it's a good thing you feel that way because I do too,\" I said looking up at him seriously. \"I love you and I don't want to live the rest of my life with you.\" \"Good,\" he said leaning down to kiss me. \"Feel better?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" he said. \"What that really what was bothering you?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" he said sheepishly. \"You worry about silly things,\" I said taking his hand. \"Now, let's play!\" We played mini-golf and had a blast. We dropped balls into the mini creeks, lost a few, but in the end, I did beat him. \"I told you that I was going to win,\" I said as we turned in our materials to the front. \"You were right. But next time, I will win,\" he said smiling at me. \"We'll just have to wait and see,\" I said smiling back at him. We headed back to the car and left for our final destination of the night, Dairy Queen ice cream. \"Do you want your favorite?\" he asked me when we went inside to order. \"What's my favorite?\" I asked him smiling. \"Chocolate ice cream with M&M;'s in them,\" he said smiling back at me. Wow! He was right on! \"And I supposed you will want your favorite?\" I asked him. \"What's my favorite?\" he asked. \"Strawberry with gummy bears in them,\" I said. \"You are correct, my love,\" he said. We ordered for each other and then we went and sat outside to eat our ice cream. \"Tonight has been amazing. Thank you so much Eddie,\" I said putting my hand on top of his. \"Tonight has been extremely memorable for me too,\" he said taking my hand and squeezing it. \"We need to do this more often. Just the two of us having a date,\" I said. \"I think we can make that happen,\" Eddie said picking at his ice cream. He seemed slightly tense again. I scooted my chair closer to him and kissed him deeply. \"I won't ever leave you. You don't have to worry,\" I said looking seriously into his eyes. He leaned forward and kissed me again. I could feel he was less tense already. \"You don't have to worry,\" I said turning our kiss into an embrace. He held me closely to him and squeezed me. I didn't understand what had gotten into him. We had a pleasant time eating our ice cream, and we spent the time talking and laughing. After tonight, I couldn't ever imagine myself spending the rest of my life with any other man. Chapter 68 We arrived back at home around 11:00. I pulled into the driveway and then put the car in park. \"Eddie,\" I said leaning in for one last passionate kiss of the night. He kissed me back passionately but he seemed to be really tense. I truly could not understand why. \"Tonight was amazing,\" I said as we broke apart, with our foreheads and noses touching. Eddie responded by kissing me again on the lips and then began to kiss my neck. I moaned. I didn't want this night to end. Eddie moved back up to my lips. We broke away and he then he looked seriously at me. \"There is one more thing planned for tonight. Come with me,\" he said getting out of the car. He ran around to my side and opened the door for me. He took my hand and I noticed it was clammy. He was obviously nervous but I didn't know why. I followed him as we walked through my parents farm and all the way to the barn, where we had our first kiss. He stopped when we were in the exact same position as when we first kissed. His nervousness was now showing on the outside. \"Eddie, honey-\" I started to say. He silenced me with a kiss. \"Paige Morgan, almost eight months ago, I kissed the girl of my dreams here for the first time. Over those eight months, my love for you has grown to something that I did not know existed. I didn't know that it was possible to feel this much love for someone, to care about someone so much. You're the only person I want to be with and when I am away from you, you are all I think about. You have bewitched me body and soul and I love you so much that it hurts. When I picture my life, it only has you in it, no matter where we decide to live. I can't imagine not sharing the rest of my life with you. Having you in my life for the rest of my life would make me the happiest man in the world\" Eddie said looking at me seriously. I began to cry tears of joy and I smiled at him. Eddie got down on one knee, pulled a box out of his pocket and looked at me. I gasped. I thought he would never ask this question again. I knew what was coming. \"Paige Morgan, will you marry me?\" He said opening the box and showing me a beautiful ring. I honestly did not even look at the ring. I just looked at him in shock. My face lit up like a Christmas tree. I could not believe this was happening. \"YES!\" I exclaimed. \"A MILLION TIMES YES!\" I exclaimed. I saw Eddie give me the biggest smile I had ever seen him make before in my life. His face lit up like a sky full of bright stars. I had the biggest smile on my face as well. He got up and put the ring on my left hand ring finger. It was a large, square cut diamond that was beautifully cut and shaped. The ring also had some tiny diamonds in the band. He got up and kissed me with all of his energy. It was electric. I kissed him back enjoying the moment. I knew that it would be a moment that I would never forget. \"I don't want this night to ever end,\" I said in between kisses. \"Me either,\" he said kissing me back. We broke a part and he was giving me that giant smile again. I honestly had never seen him smile so big before. \"Mrs. Paige Wilhiams,\" he began. \"It has a lovely ring to it,\" he said leaning it to kiss me again. That was when it hit me. Eddie and I were truly going to be husband and wife one day. Our love was going to be eternal. We would raise our children together, grow old together, and most importantly, we would always be together. There could not be a woman any happier in the world than me at that moment. \"Is this why you were so nervous and tense tonight? You were going to propose?\" I asked when we broke apart again. \"Yes,\" Eddie said. \"I was having second thoughts. I was wondering if I was going to fast or if maybe you weren't ready yet or-\" \"It was perfect timing,\" I said cutting him off and smiling at him. \"You worry too much,\" I told him. \"I guess we should head back to the house now and share the news with everyone else!\" I exclaimed. We walked hand in hand back to the house. We were both all smiles, we were chatting and laughing. There honestly could not have been a couple happier in the world at that moment. This was the start of our life- the life that we would have together forever. I knew that we would have our ups and downs, but in the end we would live happily ever after. I kissed him and was no longer scared of the prospect of me becoming Queen on day. I knew that I had made the right decision. We walked hand in hand to house where I would pack and we would begin our new life together as the future King and Queen of Denmark. Chapter 69 We got up on my family's porch and right before we went in, Eddie kissed me again. I smiled and giggled. I was so happy that I was like on a high. I opened the door and we walked in hand in hand. \"Hi guys!\" I said as we walked in. I stopped in my tracks and gasped in surprise. There was a big homemade banner hanging from the wall that said: CONGRATULATIONS PAIGE AND EDDIE! \"SURPRISE!\" My family said coming out from the kitchen. \"How did you...how did you know...\" I asked slightly confused. \"Your family knew about tonight,\" Eddie told me. \"I asked for your father's permission for your hand in marriage,\" he said smiling at me. \"That was what I was talking to him about. I needed to convince him that I was going to be a good husband to you.\" \"Awwww,\" I said and gave him a quick kiss on the lips. \"Then, your father told me,\" my mother said. \"And then we were just told about this and told to make a banner about three hours ago,\" Mikey and Johnny said laughing. \"Congratulations son,\" my father said coming over to Eddie and giving him a tight embrace. \"Call me dad from now on,\" he told him. \"Congratulations Eddie,\" my mother said hugging him. \"Welcome to the family. You can call me mom from now on,\" she said hugging him again. \"Paige,\" he said coming over to me. \"Congratulations!\" He said squeezing me very tightly and emotionally. \"You picked a good man,\" he said looking at me seriously. \"I know,\" I said smiling at him. \"Paige!\" my mom said coming over to me. \"Congratulations sweetheart! I am so happy for you,\" she said hugging me tightly too. \"Frenchie, welcome to the family,\" Mikey said giving Eddie a hug. \"Congrats man,\" Johnny said giving him a hug too. \"Paige!\" They said in unison and they both came over and hugged me. \"I am so happy for you,\" Mikey said. \"Congratulations sis!\" Johnny exclaimed. \"Let's get the champagne out and let's celebrate!\" my mom said heading to the kitchen. We all got a glass of champagne and we stood in a circle in the kitchen. \"Eddie and Paige, words cannot express how happy I am for the both of you. You both have made a decision to start your life together and I know you two have made the correct one. Paige, take of Eddie and Eddie, take care of Paige. To Eddie and Paige!\" \"To Eddie and Paige!\" The rest of my family cheered. My mother said holding up her glass. We all held up our glasses and took a sip. \"I'd like to say a few words too,\" my dad said. \"Eddie and Paige, I have watched your feelings for each other grow. From last year at Thanksgiving when you guys were just 'friends,\" he said putting friends in quotation marks and we all laughed, \"to having your relationship develop into something beautiful, love. I know I've given you guys a hard time but Paige is my oldest child and only daughter. I just wanted to make sure she goes to the right man. It's hard to let her go, but I know that she couldn't have picked a better man. I am so happy for you both and here is to a lifetime of happiness!\" My dad said holding up his glass. We all did the same and then we took a sip. \"Alright, you two pose for a picture,\" my mom said. Eddie and I got together and smiled for my mom's camera. She snapped a few pictures. \"Beautiful,\" she said looking at the pictures. \"Kiss her!\" My mom said to Eddie. Eddie leaned down to kiss me and I saw the flash of the camera through my closed eyelids as I kissed him back. \"That's so precious,\" my mom said looking at the pictures. We finished the champagne and my mom cut a cake that \"Congrats and Paige and Eddie!\" on it. \"Did you make this?\" I asked my mom. \"Yes, while you guys were gone,\" she said smiling. I gave her a hug and kiss on the cheek. \"Thank you, mother,\" I said. \"Part of me can't believe this is actually happening,\" I said smiling. We all had a piece of cake and after we cleaned up, it was time to go to bed. \"Goodnight, Paige,\" Eddie said coming to my doorway to kiss my goodnight. He was still glowing and I was too. \"Good night, Eddie,\" I said kissing him. \"I love you so much,\" I said turning our kiss into a tight embrace. \"I love you too,\" he said squeezing me tightly. \"Goodnight Mrs. Paige Wilhiams,\" he said going to his room that he shared with my brother. I went to sleep that night dreaming of the life that I would have with Eddie. I just hoped that things would work out and I would be able to go back to Denmark with him this August. Chapter 70 I woke up from my slumber by hearing someone come into my room and close the door. I opened my eyes and saw Eddie walking towards me. \"Hey,\" I whispered. \"What are you doing?\" \"Shhh,\" he said. \"I don't want to wake up your parents,\" he said. \"I couldn't sleep. I thought we should spend the night of our engagement together,\" he whispered so quietly that even I had a hard time hearing him. \"I did too,\" I said gently stroking his arm. His lips crushed against mine and he kissed me with a fiery passion and with a sense or urgency. I returned his kissed with the same force. \"I never promised about not making love to you tonight,\" he said getting into my bed with me. He kissed me again and we made quiet, passionate love in my bed. \"Beth,\" I said the next day, calling my best friend. \"Hey, Paige!\" she exclaimed.\"How are you doing?\" \"Great! Guess what? Eddie and I are engaged to be married!\" \"SHUT UP!\" She shrieked. I literally had to put the phone away from my ear. \"Yes! He proposed to me last night!\" I exclaimed. \"It was so romantic and cute!\" \"That is so adorable! I have to hear all about it!\" I explain to her what we did and what happened. \"That has to be the cutest story ever,\" Beth exclaimed. \"If I wasn't so far away, I'd love to come and celebrate with you guys,\" she said. \"I know.\" \"I better be in the wedding!\" she exclaimed. \"I don't care how much the queen doesn't like me.\" \"Of course you will be! You'll be one of the bridesmaids,\" I said laughing. \"Rosalind hasn't met you yet. I'm sure she won't like you though.\" \"I don't care,\" Beth said. We chatted for about 45 more minutes and then she had to leave for work. I realized marrying Eddie would mean having to leave my family and my close friends and going to a strange country where everyone knew my name. It would be a huge and scary adjustment but I was ready for it this time. I still hadn't heard from the Danish Embassy so I was really worried that our happily ever after may have a not so happy beginning. Chapter 71 Our days together in the United States were slowly coming to an end. Eddie had called his parents and sister to let them know we were officially engaged again. His sister and father were both very happy for the both of us. His mother, no surprise, did not even try to hide how disappointed she was that Eddie was not marrying someone of royal descent and even worse, he was marrying me. Neither of us cared what she thought. We were just happy to be together. Edie and I went downtown for lunch. On our way back, we drove in silence for a few minutes. The silence was piercing my heart. We both knew that our time together was coming to an end. I also had not told him that I still hadn't heard from the embassy yet. I couldn't bring myself to tell him without breaking down. I was fearing that I would have to say good-bye to him in a few weeks and that we would be in a long-distance relationship. I couldn't bare the thought. \"What's wrong, Paige?\" Eddie said breaking the silence. I couldn't help it anymore; I began to cry. \"I'm not ready to say good-bye yet,\" I said quickly wiping away the tears from my face. \"We don't have to say good-bye,\" he said. \"You'll be coming back with me and going to school and-\" \"That's the thing,\" I said. \"I still haven't heard back from the Danish embassy. I called them and they said even though nothing was official yet, most likely my request for a student visa will be denied for this fall semester. They said to re-apply for the spring semester,\" I said crying again. Eddie was silent for a few seconds. \"We'll figure something out,\" he said quietly. \"What happens if-\" \"No, no what if's,\" he said. \"We will figure something out,\" he re-assured me. \"Time is running out,\" I said. \"I'm afraid Eddie. I'm afraid for us. I'm afraid that things won't work out with us,\" I whispered, chocking back the tears. \"Paige!\" he exclaimed. \"How can you say that? After everything that we've been through- we have always worked it out. We'll work this out too,\" he said. \"I just thought...we'd be going there together and...\" I trailed off. I couldn't finished. I was going to say \"get married.\" That was the only thing in the world that I wanted right now. \"You know, what? Screw school. Screw medical school. Screw parents, screw everyone or anything that gets in our way. We are meant to be,\" I said. \"You know I'd leave the throne for you,\" Eddie said. \"No questions. I'd do it for you. I'd do anything for you,\" he said taking my hand and kissing it. \"I know you would,\" I said with tears still streaming down my face. \"When we back to your parent's place, I'll call the Danish Embassy. Try to talk to someone. I mean, you're information has already been processed for a residents visa. It shouldn't be a problem to transfer that information over,\" he said. \"You'd think...\" I mumbled. \"Ive dreamed of being a doctor for most of my life and now this...\" I said chocking back the tears. \"Maybe you could take a semester off,\" he gently suggested. \"I'd rather not,\" I said. \"I know, but-\" \"I don't want to do that, Eddie,\" I said. \"So what are you suggesting that we do? Do the long distance thing again for a semester?\" Eddie asked. He was getting upset. I knew he was trying not to cry, so he became angry instead. \"I mean, we did it before. I don't want to but it's looking that we might have to do that.\" Eddie was silent. \"No,\" he said. \"I don't want to do that again.\" \"We'd most likely be one month together, one month apart. I was thinking I'd get an apartment and a roommate up there. Whenever you guys were in recess, you could come and stay with us. And whenever I had a break, I could go over there. It would just be until I could transfer over to Denmark,\" I said. We drove in silence for the rest of the ride back home. It appeared that our fairy-tale relationship was coming to a complete halt. We had some serious challenges ahead of us. And it broke my heart.[Chapter 14] Chapter 72 Eddie and I spent the next few days trying to figure out how to spend the fall together. He continuously called the Danish Embassy but couldn't get any help from anyone. And finally, the dreaded day came, the day where we would have to part ways and say good-bye for a whole semester. The ride to the airport was quiet. I began to cry silently. Eddie saw this and took my hand. \"I should be able to come after about five weeks into your semester. I'll be able to stay for about a week and a half. Then the next time I should be able to come would be Thanksgiving and I was thinking you could come to Denmark for part of your break and we could spend Christmas with your family\" Eddie said quietly. I nodded silently. Five weeks seemed like such a long time away. We drove in silence for a little while. \"Paige, you know that I love you, right?\" Eddie said. \"Of course,\" I said wiping a few tears from my face. \"And I love you too,\" I said. \"Do you want to just put an end to the nonsense? I could live here and we could get married. You could do everything that you wanted to do and I could go back to school and get my Master's degree...\" he said trailing off. \"Is that what you want?\" I asked. \"I want whatever you want,\" he said. I smiled and laughed. \"I hate that kind of pressure,\" I said. \"The only thing I want is to be with you,\" he said. \"We will be together. But just separated from each other,\" I mumbled. The dreaded moment came where I had to drop Eddie off at the airport. I couldn't find a parking spot near-by the drop-off zone. \"Just drop me off, Paige,\" he said. \"I want to go in with you, though,\" I said. \"It doesn't seem like it's going to work that way,\" he said. I pulled off to the side and put the car in park. He took his hands and wiped away my tears and embraced me in a tight hug. \"I love you,\" I whispered. \"I love you too,\" he said. Then he looked at me and gave me a long passionate kiss. He broke away and looked at the clock. \"Good-bye, Paige,\" he said giving me one last kiss. \"I'll see you in five weeks.\" This was so much harder than I had ever imagined. I watched it take his suitcase, walk toward the door, and disappear. That was when I just sat there in the car and broke down. My heart was breaking- no my heart was broken in half. I never thought it was possible to love someone so much that the pain would be this hard, but I guess it was. I felt, lost, alone. How would I survive this whole semester without him? Seeing him for a week and half would seem like nothing after spending the whole summer together. I sat in the car for a few minutes and just thought. Was I really going to let him board that plane? Was I really going to let him go? The man of my dreams- just I really just let him walk through those doors alone? I did and I couldn't believe it. I couldn't let him go. I took the keys out of the ignition and locked the door. I ran into the airport looking desperately for him. I continuously called his cell phone but I couldn't him to pick up. He probably couldn't hear it go off. I continued run through the airport and I finally saw the head of the man that I loved. \"EDDIE!\" I yelled. He didn't seem to hear. \"EDDIE! EDDIE!\" I yelled again. He turned around and gave me the biggest smile that I had ever seen. I could tell that he had been crying too. He got out of line, ran over to me, and hugged me. \"What are you doing here?\" he asked. \"Do you think it's too late to trade in your ticket for a later flight date?\" He looked at me strangely. \"Because you're going to need two tickets,\" I said. His face lit up. \"I'm going to take the semester off. I don't care about when I go to medical school or where. I don't care where I live. I don't care about anything except being with you,\" I said. He leaned forward and kissed me passionately. \"I couldn't let you go,\" I said hugging him after we broke apart. \"I was just thinking about getting out of line and calling you to come pick me up. I couldn't leave you either,\" he said squeezing me. We walked out the airport hand in hand. And for once in the past few days, I felt peace about our relationship. I knew that I was doing the right thing. Chapter 73 We pulled back into my parent's driveway. Eddie was looking at flight times to Denmark. There is one tomorrow evening at 6:30. It leaves from Wisconsin and then we'd go to New York City. From there, we'd travel to London and then to Paris and then to Copenhagen.\" \"Take it,\" I said. \"Will that get you back in time for the start of Parliament?\" I asked. \"Yes, as well as the start of classes,\" he said buying the tickets on his phone. I looked at him quizzically. \"But I don't have my student visa...\" I said trailing off. \"My dad just e-mailed me about two minutes ago. He called the embassy and made a fuss. They put a rush on your application. You're going to be approved,\" he said smiling. \"Oh my goodness!\" I squealed. \"Tell your father I said thank you so much! And when I see him again, I'm going to give him a big hug. I saw that my mom was out there to greet me as I pulled into the driveway. I'm sure she figured I'd be a train wreck by now. I got out the car and so did Eddie. I saw the look of surprise on her face but then she came over to hug me. \"I couldn't do it,\" I said hugging her back. \"I figured either you both would come back or you would have come back and then left tomorrow,\" she said. \"Let's go inside. You have some packing to do,\" she said. Eddie and I walked hand in hand to the house where I packed my belongings. Tomorrow, Eddie and I would leave for Denmark but this would not be like this summer. Now, we were engaged to be married and everything took on a different aspect now. I was no longer his girlfriend but the woman that he was going to marry, the woman that he would spend the rest of his life with. As I packed my things into boxes that my parents would send to me later, I took a look around my room. I knew that tonight would be the last night that I could technically call this my room. Surprisingly, it didn't make me feel sad or sentimental. Instead, it made me feel happy and excited. I was happy about the life Eddie and I would have together and I was excited for what the future would hold. I put tape on top of one the boxes to secure the contents in and pondered about the future. The future could be a scary concept since no one knew what it would hold. Would Eddie and I really get married or would the engagement get called of like last time? I shuddered at that thought, but I knew that it could be a possibility. I tried not to think about the negative aspects or possibilities in life but no matter how hard to tried to fight them, they would always be there. Would Eddie and I truly get our ever after? I would like to think so but you never know what the future could hold. I packed my essentials into a few bags that I would take on the airplane with me tomorrow. The airplane that would take us to Denmark to embark on an entire new journey. The End of Part 1 Hello everyone! This is the end of part 1 of my fanfiction!

In fact I went and saw it six times. Call me pathetic. But I so thought that there should have been a novelized version. So I'm writing it myself. Like all fan fiction there are a great deal of exaggeration and embellishment. Enjoy! Prologue Date - March 15, 2916 The planet, Earth. The cradle of civilization. In the 800 years since the 21'st century, there had been no 'Third World War'. For 800 years life on Earth had continued on with little incident. Just a few corrupted governments with greedy politicians, and a few military conflicts between a few countries here and there, but civilization still carried on as normal for 800 years without the human race ever destroying itself. But what was once a population of 7 billion in the 21'st century soon became 13 billion. There then became strict population control. In places that used to be remote and secluded Quickly became explored and then small towns were built. Those small towns became Bigger towns. Eventually those bigger towns became major cities. But the planet became overcrowded. Older small towns that used to be havens for people who didn't like the big city soon became uncomfortably claustrophobic. No one was homeless anymore. Everyone was given either a small house or apartment. No one went hungry. Though initially much farmland had been and then built on, food was no longer problem worldwide, for they had discovered a way to artificially synthesized biological nutritional protein, which was able to be made to look like any food and taste exactly like the real thing. 99 out of 100 people couldn't tell the difference. Though there were still some fanatics that claimed that such food was unnatural and therefore should not be eaten, and therefore only preferred the real thing. Much like how during the 21st century some people would not eat genetically altered food. Then came, The 'Homestead Company'. The Homestead Company initially was a small branch of NASA that's was attempting to explore beyond the solar system. It took hundreds of years. But by the late 23rd century they had successfully had a probe reach a neighboring solar system, 'Alpha Centauri'. And there the probe sent back data saying that it had found a planet that was, not 100% identical to Earth, no, but was superficially similar. The planet in question had no life. But it was nearly identical in size and shape to Earth, had a few salt water oceans, and the most important part, a molten core and with that a geo-magnetic field. Experimental terraforming technology had been used on Mars for decades. They had managed to create within Mars a breathable atmosphere, but because Mars had no molten core, it had no magnetic field. It was still uninhabitable except when the people stayed inside the radiation proof structures. On Earth, with the terraforming technology eventually being mastered, they had cured the environment. Filtering out all of the pollution in Earth's atmosphere and they even stopped global warming as well as restore the Arctic Ice on the poles. They simply converted seawater into freshwater and then dispensed it in the Arctic temperatures on the poles where it froze, and overtime the oceans got a little shallower while fresh water ice continued to build up on the poles. They had long since mastered the construction of large one-million ton interstellar Starships. The Starship's Center module would remain stationary, while the outer modules would rotate to create 'centripetal force' as a form of gravity, while contrary to science fiction, science had never discovered 'artificial gravity'. Contrary to science fiction, science never managed to discover 'Warp Drive', or 'Hyperdrive', so they were confined to use a fusion powered, 'slower-than-light' 'Ion-Drive' in order to make a ship reach incredible velocity within a long period of time. A one way trip from Earth to Alpha Centauri took 19 years. The ship contained a scientific crew along with terraforming technology. And within a few decades they had successfully turned the suitable planet in the Alpha Centauri star system into a carbon copy of Earth. They planted seeds and trees, bacteria for making soil fertile, and they built advanced living structures. And the Homestead Company named this planet after themselves, and called the planet, Homestead I. The Homestead Company then became the most popular Interstellar Cruise Line. There were others where people would take cruises on large Starships for luxury and fun. But usually they were just short trips around the solar system. They had discovered how to place a human into hibernation. Complete and total suspended animation. As long as the person remained in suspended animation they would not age. The hibernation technology allowed them to keep a person completely healthy forever as long as they were in suspended animation. Though putting them into hibernation could only be done under medical supervision. There was no way to do it without a team of doctors. None the less, people didn't worry about that. Thousand upon thousands of people spent all of their money to get a spot on one of the Homestead Company's Interstellar Starships to begin immediate colonization of, Homestead I. Of course, Homestead I, was only the first of many newly colonized planets. Several of Jupiter's moons had been colonized like Mars. As well as the moons of a few other planets in the solar system. Venus and Mercury were unfit for any kind of terraforming or colonization. But there were several other planets. Hundreds of nearby solar systems had been explored by thousands of long-range probes that had traveled for centuries. There was a solar system about 60 light-years from Earth called the Bakty System, where they found another suitable planet. And they called it Homestead II. And in countless other solar systems they discovered other planets that were eventually terraformed and colonization of those worlds began. Earth would always remain the cradle of civilization, but there were thousands of people on Earth that wanted space and room to grow. And that was the slogan that the Homestead Company always used. The Homestead Company made trillions of dollars off of the colony planets because people literally paid everything they have. And the Homestead Company spared no expense on their Starships. The starships were supposed to be 100% safe. The starship's primary systems were designed by the experts and then tested a thousand times over to be Fail-Safe. But even if the primary system somehow failed the ships were supposed to have countless redundant systems. And since the people were putting their faith in the hibernation pods, the hibernation pods were also designed to be Fail-Safe. With built-in redundancies. The hibernation pods for supposed to maintain the occupant's life while ensuring that they were healthy, and that was where all the redundancies were. If something went wrong with the life support system of a hibernation pod the hibernation pods were still supposed to continue to operate and maintain the life of the occupant. In a Tech Factory in the city of Atlanta, an assembly line with fast-moving robotic arms were forging out of raw materials the components for making Electronic components for advanced Machinery. One such component was the internal metal-like Polymer Wire circuits for the 'Clock chips' that would be used to be installed into hibernation pods for suspended animation. Millions of such Clock Chips had been manufactured on countless assembly lines in countless factories around the world. They all used a standard manufacturing method from their design that had been perfected and re-perfected over and over again. One such Clock Chip, with its individual serial number 'V27G4X91-X439' was inserted with a newly forged Synthetic metal-like polymer wire for one of its circuits. But within it contained a one in a hundred-billion random chance minute flaw. When Clock-Chip V27G4X91-X439, passed through a laser scanner for an inspection. The laser scanner was both designed and supposed to be able to detect 'imperfections' in the minute components of the bigger components. Had V27G4X91-X439, failed the inspection it would have been discarded and then it's raw materials recycled, but the minute flaw within that single wire was apparently so small that the inspection laser scanner could not detect it, and V27G4X91-X439 passed inspection and a few hours later, going down the assembly line, a robotic arm took V27G4X91-X439 and installed it into the 'date and time' Computer core of one out of thousands of freshly manufactured Hibernation Pods that were being inspected for use on Interstellar Starships. Chapter 1 July 2, 2949 The Starship Avalon was flying at 0.48 the speed of light. It was a 1.4 million ton Interstellar luxury liner. The Homestead Company's Premier Starship. Commission date - January 27, 2418. It was currently on route from Earth to The Colony world of Homestead II. For over 500 years it had received overhauls and upgrades from 'Space-Dock', in orbit of several different worlds. Many other Starships had made this trip on this course. The entire ship was currently on low power mode, except for a few of the primary systems. There were five thousand passengers in suspended animation. There was a crew of 258 who were also in suspended animation. The ship was currently being flown on autopilot. The ship's computer was equipped with an artificial intelligence that was capable of carrying out all the ship's functions without crew. Though of course when the passengers are awake they prefer to have humans looking after them as opposed to just a mindless machine. The crew was supposed to wake up five months before they arrive at Homestead II. Where then the passengers would then wake up Four months before they arrived at Homestead II, where the passengers would enjoy The Starship Avalon's many luxury amenities, compliments of the Homestead Company. The hibernation pods were following their own time and date programmed into their own computer cores, as well as following the time and date of The ship's primary computer core. Everything is maintained perfectly. There was one small malfunction with a single insignificant system maybe once a year where the redundant systems would take over and cover for it almost instantly. The entire ship was supposed to be Fail-Safe all the time with no problems. For it was necessary to take such safety measures, because the journey from Earth to Homestead II was 120 years, one way. The ship's Ion Drive was continually accelerating them. The acceleration was hardly anything but they gained considerable velocity after many many years of traveling like they still had a long way to go. The ship was protected by a powerful energy Shield which was supposed to heat any inanimate object in outer space that comes in contact with it to disintegration point before it can penetrate The Shield. It was around this time that while the ship was flying on its programed course, that it passed through a random meteor shower in deep space. Something that happens every now and then with other Starships. The first few small meteorites impacted the forward Shield and The Shield protected the ship flawlessly, however the computers artificial intelligence immediately realized this and decided to take a few unnecessary over-precautious precautions by diverting power from the living and luxury modules to reinforce the forward Shield. But one of the meteorites that they were heading for them was half the size of the ship. The ship did not have ultra evasive maneuvering capability, it could only fly on its predicted course. Had it detected the large meteorite significantly sooner it would have made a mild coarse adjustment to fly around it but now it didn't have time. The giant meteorite half the size of the ship impacted the forward Shield. The Shield did its job. The giant meteorite was completely disintegrated upon impact. However by lack of imagination by the scientists and engineers who designed the shield technology, the impact of the giant meteorite cause a tiny hole in the ship's Shield that was fixed by the ship's redundant systems within a fraction of a second. But within that fraction of a second a single basketball size meteorite that was right behind the giant meteorite got through the hole and at incredible velocity it penetrated the ship's hull within the engineering section and punched right through the wall of the primary reactor room, where it then hit the reactor's primary computer core. The entire Computer was not shut down, no, but just one of its modules. The rest of the computer took over, and the excessive Redundant systems attempted to correct the problem. But this kind of damage was never expected by the scientists and Engineers that designed the ship. It cause power fluctuations throughout the ship and a whopping 17 simultaneous malfunctions happened all at once. Nothing major. The malfunctions appeared on the primary hologram console on the bridge in the form of 'Red'-diagnostic scans. Red, indicating that something was wrong. On the red diagnostic scans the most functions registered a word that flashed, 'REPAIRING', and the word 'repairing', flashed for only a few seconds until the malfunction turned 'green' where the green indicated that all was well, and the malfunctions disappeared, one at a time 16 out of the 17 in quick succession. But the word 'repairing' kept flashing on one that stayed red. The malfunction was titled 'Hibernation Pod 1498'. Within the large hibernation chamber within the Living Module, The hibernation pod would have being corrected by the ship's redundant systems, except for one thing, there was a power surge that went through the circuit board. This was something that happened within every hibernation pod on the ship, however the hibernation pods were designed to be able to withstand this sort of thing. All except for one single component in hibernation pod 1498. The minute Imperfection within V27G4X91-X439, that the Inspection Scanner at the factory was not able to detect had to take the full brunt of the energy surge from the ship's malfunction and meteorite impact in the reactor room, and while it was initially supposed to be able to withstand it, the minute flaw within V27G4X91-X439 caused the whole chip to burn out. What this then did was it made the computer core within the hibernation pod think that the ship's Journey had come to an end, and that it was time to wake up The Passengers on the ship, however this was independent to each hibernation pod individually. It was in that moment with all of those circumstances that because of the burning out of Clock-Chip V27G4X91-X439...the occupant of hibernation pod 1498...was prematurely awakened. Please review![Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Hibernation pod 1498 injected James Preston with several different shots of different kinds of stimulants, as part of the reanimation process. A defibrillator then shocked his heart causing him to start breathing again after the stasis pod had oxygenated his brain. The hatch of his pod then opened up like an eggshell and then an interactive holographic artificial intelligence begin to speak to him in a calm friendly feminine voice. \"Good morning James.\" said the hologram of the woman. \"How are you feeling?\" James Preston then opened his eyes and fumbled around with his hands in confusion, not entirely sure where he was or what he was doing. \"What? What's going on.\" James said in a panic. \"It is perfectly normal to feel confused.\" said the hologram in reaction to his actions. \"You just spent 120 years in suspended animation.\" \"What?\" said James Preston again still confused. \"It is okay James.\" said the holographic artificial intelligence reassuringly. \"It's Jim.\" James corrected the Hologram, telling it the variation of his name that he preferred to go by. \"Jim.\" complied the hologram with a smile, acknowledging his preference. The last thing that Jim Preston remembered was being put into a dreamless coma by medical staff. The Homestead Company had discounted his ticket because of his Degree in Mechanical Engineering, a needed, profitable trait on the colony planets. He knew that he was going to Homestead II, and that he would be on the starship Avalon, but while his nervous system was rebooting with his brain waking up he had no memory of anything for the next few minutes. \"Where am I?\" asked James. \"You are a passenger on the Starship Avalon.\" answered the hologram. \"The ship is on it's final approach to the colony world of Homestead II; your new home. A new life, a fresh start, room to grow.\" \"Room to grow.\" said Jim with a smile as it all was starting to come back to him. The idea of a new home where he wouldn't be so claustrophobic like the overcrowded world of Earth was always his primary motivation for taking the trip. He also liked to feel useful with his engineering skills. \"For the next four months you will enjoy space travel at it it's most luxurious. Food, fun, friends.\" \"Fun and friends.\" said Jim in a daze with a smile. \"That's right Jim.\" A holographic screen appeared off to the side. It showed his heart rate, his body temperature, and a few other colored meters that fluctuated. And a word saying, 'Scanning'. \"The ID bracelet on your right wrist is your key to the wonders of the Avalon.\" the hologram continued. There was then a chime of approval from the screen that was off to the side. \"You are in perfect health Jim.\" Set the hologram. \"Let's get you to your cabin so that you can get some rest. Please go down the aisle until you find door number 473.\" He now had the strength to walk. He climbed out of his hibernation pod and started to walk down the aisle until he got to the door that was marked clearly with the numbers 473. When he went through the door he saw a hallway with a long set of what appeared to be grey pajamas and bathrobes. \"If you are inclined, please change into the grey pajamas and bathrobes.\" said the voice of the female hologram from his hibernation pod. While the rest of the ship was still on low-power mode, more or less, and all of the other Passengers on the ship were still asleep, Jim's Hibernation Pod's artificial intelligence was tapping into the ship's audio system to guide him every step of the way, independent from the ship's autopilot that said the journey was not over yet. The ship also detected his presence and it was programmed to serve all the passengers regardless of what point in the journey they are detected in the hallways, compliments of the Homestead Company, the lights and ship's systems came on around him as he walked. He went into a small cubicle and and changed into the grey pajamas. \"Please go down to the end of the hall.\" said the female voice. He followed the directions of the female voice. Though he had some of his mind cleared by now he was still in a half drunken state where he took no notice of the fact that he was the only person there. \"Please take a left.\" said The Voice. \"The door to your cabin will illuminate.\" He walked down the hall and he found the door that was illuminated. \"Please scan your ID band to enter the room.\" said the voice. \"Welcome to your cabin.\" said the voice after he had entered the room, and the holographic woman was waiting for him inside. The cabin wasn't very big, but big enough. He was only a low class passenger. There was a bed, a closet, and a door that led to a bathroom with a toilet, sink, and a shower. \"This room will be your home until we reach landfall.\" said the holographic woman. \"You have been assigned to learning group 38, for people with engineering and Technical trade skills. For the next four months you will take skill building classes, meet your fellow passengers, learn about colonial living, and enjoy the Homestead Company's luxury amenities. Please scan your ID to confirm luggage delivery.\" He paused and looked around still in a partially confused state. \"Jim.\" the Hologram prompted. \"Please scan your ID to confirm luggage delivery.\" she said again. He waived his right wrist over the Hologram and there was a beeping sound and it was confirmed. A hole in the wall produce a tall plastic glass and then started to dispense what appeared to be some pink water into it. Jim guessed that it was some kind of Electrolyte solution. \"As part of your recovery from hibernation sickness please drink plenty of fluids.\" said the holographic woman. \"Also to recover from hibernation sickness it is highly encouraged that you take a nap for the rest of the day.\" 'Ironic,' thought Jim, 'that after you get out of suspended animation you need to sleep.' He took the glass of pink water and began gulping it down and he then realized just how thirsty he was and how dry his mouth was. \"We hope you will enjoy the rest of your stay aboard the Avalon, a Homestead Company Starship.\" said the Hologram that then disappeared and did not reappear. He then searched through his luggage and found a t-shirt and boxers. He changed into them and then decided To crawl under the covers on the bed. He dimmed the lights and quickly fell asleep. Jim was in a deep sleep until he woke up because his lights spontaneously came on and the ship began talking to him from the audio system. It seems like a man's voice who was giving a shipwide broadcast on the morning radio. \"Good morning passengers. It is a beautiful day here on the Avalon. We hope you enjoy the amenities aboard the ship and and don't get homesick, get Homestead. Let's start off our day with one of my favorite Tunes from back on Earth.\" A song started playing over the audio system. Jim got up and stripped out of his boxers and t-shirt and went into the bathroom and turned on the hot water in the shower. He stepped into the stream and allowed the hot water to revitalize him. He shampooed his hair and brushed his teeth. He got dressed and then combed his hair. The female voice from his hibernation pod then spoke once more. \"Once you have gotten ready for the day, please go across the hall to room 171 For orientation.\" Jim wanted to make an impression towards his fellow passengers when he went to orientation. So he decided to settle on cowboy boots, blue jeans, and after try on several t-shirts until he settled on a button-up shirt with the top button undone. He then tried on his brown jacket and then was about to rush out the door when he stopped and then went back to the mirror. \"No.\" he said to himself in disapproval of his look. He then took off the jacket and decided that he looked better without it. But then again he said, \"No.\" And then he put the jacket back on. \"Just own it Jim, just own it. You got yourself a cool jacket.\" He always thought the jacket looked cool and stylish. But in the end he decided to dispense with it. It wasn't exactly like he needed it to keep warm. The ship's ambient temperature was always kept at a comfortable 22 degrees Celsius. He exited his room and looked up and down the hallway both ways and raised his eyebrows in curious observation that he still saw no people. It was then that he realized that he saw no people the day before when he had woken up. He guessed that they had just missed him, that perhaps they will come out of hibernation first and then he will come after them. He vaguely remembered that when he was exiting the hibernation room that many of the pods were still occupied. Of course obviously they can not wake up all 5,000 people simultaneously. The entire hibernation room would be way over crowded. Likely they wake up one person at a time every few minutes over several days. He wasn't entirely sure what the procedure was. More likely the people wake up in groups. Within the hibernation room the people are all in circles of six. He entered room 171 where the computer then detected his presence and believing that it was time to give a class, \"Welcome.\" said an interactive recorded hologram of a woman in a uniform. \"Will you all please take a seat.\" He then raise his eyebrow in interest as he looked back and forth around the room, still wondering why he was alone, and then took a seat on one of the benches. 'Where is everybody?' he thought with confusion. \"Earth, is a prosperous plant. The cradle of civilization. The Homeworld of the human race. It is beautiful, blue, green, with a restored environment and a thriving society.\" said the hologram of the woman. \"But to many it is considered overpopulated, overpriced, and...overrated.\" Jim then couldn't help but interrupt. \"Excuse me. I think there's been some sort of misunderstanding...\" But he was cut off in mid sentence, \"Please hold all questions until the end, please.\" \"Oh, sorry.\" he said. \"The colonies offer a solution.\" said the hologram, continuing his though if there had been no interruption. Lots of space, open country, and room to grow. And there is no colony within the occupied worlds that is more beautiful than Homestead II. \"You all are assigned to learning group 38. Your skills and trades will be most valuable on the colony as with your ability with your hands with technical skills will allow…\" \"I'm sorry.\" said Jim, apparently unable to help interrupting again and insisting over the holographic woman. \"But where are all of the other passengers?\" The interactive Holograms artificial intelligence heard his question and computed the most obvious answer to the question. \"We are all on the Starship Avalon.\" said the holographic woman with a smile. \"Then how come there is nobody else here?\" asked Jim. The artificial intelligence heard his question and computed a correction to what it believed to be an error in his confusion. \"There are five thousand passengers and 258 crew members.\" said the holographic woman \"Then why am I alone?\" asked Jim. The artificial intelligence then computed his question and determined that he believed that he was without moral support on their journey, and computed an answer. \"We are all in this together.\" said the holographic woman. Please Review![Chapter 3] Chapter 3 At this point Jim Preston was starting to get upset. \"I'm sorry,\" said Jim Preston, \"but where are all of the other passengers?\" He asked the holographic Woman again. \"We are all on the Starship Avalon.\" said the Hologram again. 'It's like Siri on your cell phone.' he thought. 'Eventually she's just starting to repeat her answers.' One thing that he had noticed about artificial intelligence throughout his entire life was that mankind had never truly been able to perfect it. Though they could create a computer program that could think and choose for itself, it's could never truly think and comprehend and adapt the same way that a real human mind could. He ran out of the room and then ran down to the large room filled with all of the hibernation pods. When he got there he looked around at all of the hibernation pods and realize that every single one of them was still occupied. 'Okay…!' thought Jim in a panic, 'this doesn't quite seem right?!' putting it modestly. In a desperate attempt, he started to run up and down the hallways of the passenger living module for the next five minutes trying to find someone, anyone! \"Hello!\" he called out. \"Hello! Is anybody here?!\" He passed through a colossal sized dinning room filled with food dispensers, that could seat 5000. He went to the upper level of the passenger living module. \"Hello!\" he continued to call out. He then saw a window. When he looked out he saw the rest of the ship in the distance. The ship was over a thousand meters long. He saw the other two luxury modules, that both about the size of extra-large aircraft carriers, as well as the center module as well as the command ring. It was also the engineering section at the center module which would have been connecting to the drive system and the forward Shield generator. He reached what he believed to be the elevator where he then waved his hand over the glowing panel on the side of the door. The panel detected his ID band on his wrist and then beeps and then the door open for him. \"Please buckle up.\" said a voice coming out of the wall. \"This elevator will experience a momentary lapse in gravity.\" Ignoring the warning to buckle up, he began to feel the weightlessness shortly after the elevator started moving. But he held on to the handrails, and eventually started to feel gravity again when he reached the first of the two giant luxury modules that had been across the way from the passengers living module. The door opened for him and he walked out into another large hall with giant huge Dome Skylight Windows. It looked like a super sized shopping mall right on the ship. \"Grand Concourse.\" said the voice that came out of the wall. He stood there at the door of the elevator for a few moments until he took a few steps forward where the Giant shopping mall apparently detecting his presence, came online, starting with the lights and an attractive-looking Fountain by some benches. Then an artificial intelligence 'Help Station' nearby detected his presence and attempted to Signal him to get his attention. \"Hello.\" said the help station. \"Welcome to the Grand Concourse. How can I help you?\" He jogged over to the help station and sort of fumbled with his words, not entirely sure what to ask. He settled on answering the question that the help station had asked him. \"I would like to talk to a person please.\" said Jim Preston. \"A real live person please.\" The artificial intelligence analyzed the words that came out of his mouth and attempted to compute a suitable answer. Though his remark was rather generalized so the help station gave him a selection to choose from. \"What sort of person?\" asked the help station. \"Personal trainer, travel planner, psychiatrist?\" \"I don't know.\" said Jim. \"I might actually take you up on that psychiatrist before long, but for right now here at present I will settle for someone 'in charge'.\" The artificial intelligence analyzed the words that had come out of his mouth and then attempted to come up with a suitable answer for 'someone in charge'. \"The ship's Steward handles all passenger affairs.\" said the help station. \"It can be located on the third level of the Grand Concourse.\" \"Thanks.\" said Jim and he ran off in that direction. \"Happy to help.\" said the help station. He ran about a hundred meters down the Grand Concourse, following the signs, and then up a few stairs till he got to the third level near the top of the high Dome glass ceiling. Where he then found an office labeled 'Ship's Stewart'. But when he entered the door that opened automatically for him the chair behind the desk was empty. 'If I woke up before the other passengers,' he thought to himself, 'then that means that the crew may have woken up before me but the ship's steward is not here.' He then ran back to the help station. \"Hello.\" said the help station. \"Welcome to the Grand Concourse, how can I help you?\" \"Who's flying the ship?\" asked Jim Preston. The artificial intelligence analyzed the words that came out of his mouth and attempted to come up with an answer to 'who was flying the ship'. \"The pilot, the Captain, the flight crew, the chief engineer…\" Jim cut off the help station in mid-sentence and said loudly and firmly, \"The Captain! I would like to speak to the Captain!\" The help station felt a need to correct him on that account. \"The Captain rarely handles passenger affairs.\" \"I absolutely have to speak to the Captain!\" shouted Jim. \"It's an emergency! Please!\" The help station understanding his plight then computed an answer for him. \"The Captain can usually be found on the bridge on the Command Ring.\" He ran to the command Ring. Of course first he went into the elevator. \"Please buckle up.\" said the voice coming out of the wall. \"There will be a temporary lapse in gravity.\" He pressed the button for the 'command ring' and he then went to the seat, this time he had the sense to buckle up. The elevator then took a different route along an elevator track where it was briefly without gravity but then he was in the inner ring that was rotating like the rest of the ship. It was a smaller ring. The gravity actually felt less, because with a smaller ring the centripetal force would be less than on the bigger outer modules. He went to the bridge and he saw a thick metal door. He waved his right hand over the door sensor where it detected his ID band and the door opened only to reveal another door that seems super metal-reinforced. And then there was a reprimanding sound, that said, \"Bridge access is restricted to authorized personnel only.\" said the voice that came out of the wall. He tried again waved his hand over the door sensor which detected his ID band. \"Bridge access is restricted to authorized personnel only.\" He looked through the tiny little window on the thick door and saw the inside of the bridge. He saw a few panels and consoles glowing but there were no people in there. \"No one is flying the ship.\" he said to himself. \"This is not good!\" he said half anger half panic. He ran around the command ring and found several other doors. He found the Infirmary. He waved his hand over the door sensor and it allowed him in. There was no medical staff. No doctor. There was however an 'auto dock'. An auto dock is a glass tube that you lay down in and some laser sensor scan you and tell you what is wrong with you. The machine is also supposed to be able to do minor surgery on you and administer special kinds of medication. Basically every hospital in the entire world had one of these. He ran out of the room and down the hall of the command ring where he came to another room. It like the bridge had a thick metal door that was super reinforced and he looked through the little window on it and saw more hibernation pods. And he knew that it was the crew. Just the thing is, they were all still asleep. \"What in the world is going on here?\" he asked himself. \"I'm not supposed to wake up until we are about to arrive at Homestead II.\" He ran back to the elevator which then took him back to the Grand Concourse. He exited the elevator and went to the help station. \"Hello.\" said the help station. \"Welcome to the Grand Concourse, how can I help you.\" 'It welcomes me to the Grand Concourse every single time I approach it.' thought Jim. 'That is going to get really annoying.' He tried to think about what exactly to help station could do to help him. 'I need information on our coordinates in outer space in proximity to Homestead 2.' he thought. For that he would need the navigational sensors that would be on the pilot station on the bridge. Of course his ID would not get them into the bridge. He tried to think of something else. He needed to use his own brain for once rather than just ask the artificial intelligence on the ship to do everything for him. So he thought, cruise ships have observatories. Every cruise ship in outer space has one. The observatories were supposed to be for the amusement of the passengers, but they were also extraordinarily practical ship's systemswise. \"Where can I find the ships Observatory?\" This being a standard passenger question the artificial intelligence didn't need to think about the answer. \"The ship's Observatory can be found at the far aft end of the Grand Concourse.\" \"Thank you.\" said Jim. He then walked off in that direction. \"Happy to help.\" said the help station. He found the observatory and walked through the door which then closed behind him. There was a large window that showed the stars outside but then everything went dark. And then stars appeared as Holograms with in the air in the room. \"Hello.\" said a loud booming deep voice with a dramatic Echoy effect. \"Welcome to the observatory. What can I show you?\" \"We're supposed to land soon?\" There was no response from the computer. \"I'm the only one awake.\" The computer responded analyzing the words that came out of his mouth, they were not Observatory questions. \"I don't understand?\" said the computer. \"What can I show you?\" Jim then decided to go with what the observatory had asked of him. \"Show me Homestead II.\" he commanded. The observatory carrying out it's primary function, all of the stars in the room fluctuated and then a blue and green earth-like Planet appeared in front of him as a hologram. \"Homestead II is the fourth planet in the Bukty system.\" \"And where are we in proximity to Homestead II right now?\" asked Jim. \"We are currently enroute from Earth to Homestead II. We will arrive in approximately 90 years.\" \"What?\" thought Jim. He paused. His mouth dropped open in shock and surprise as well as in Terror. He stared into empty space not looking at anything at all. At first he thought maybe he had misheard what the computer had said. Yes, that has to be it. Believing that the information that he thought that he had just received was misheard by him. \"I'm sorry, but can I persuade you to say that one more time please? And could you say it loud and slow and speak every word clearly.\" The computer following his commands then said, \"We are currently enroute from Earth to Homestead II. We will arrive in approximately 90 years, three weeks, and two days, give or take a day.\" \"You have got to be fucking shitting me!\" he said out loud with indignation. He ran out of the room and then looked around the Grand Concourse. Quickly walking in circles while turning his head left and right. He did this again and again, over and over until he started to get dizzy. And then he screamed at the top of his lungs, and then balled up his fist and punched a wall so hard that it hurt. His hand wasn't broken, but he knew his hand would be sore for days. Now that he had had his biggest childish fit and tantrum in his entire life he was a little calmer, with a slightly fresh perspective. Why was he awake and no one else was. He tried to think. Even considered something that no one else would. His hibernation pod malfunctioned. Yes. That has to be it. There's no other explanation. There is absolutely no reason why the ship should be programmed to wake him up now. If his hibernation pod woke him up it's because something went wrong with it. If a hibernation pod breaks then the occupant would die, therefore as a Fail-Safe if the hibernation pod breaks it will sustain the life of the occupant by waking them up. He then rushed to the help station and while at first he considered that he had always been told that hibernation pods were Fail-Safe, he felt the need to ask somebody. \"Hello.\" Said the help station. \"Welcome to the Grand Concourse how can I help you.\" \"Can I have you send a message to every other help at the station on the Grand Concourse not to welcome me to the Grand Concourse anymore?\" The help station made some beeping sounds where it then said, \"Request stored. No help station will welcome you to Grand Concourse anymore.\" \"Thank you.\" he said. \"Happy to help.\" said the help station. \"Now I have a question.\" he said. \"What do I do if my hibernation pod malfunctions?\" \"Hibernation pods are fail-safe.\" said the help station. \"Hibernation pods cannot malfunction.\" \"Then can you tell me why I'm awake.\" \"You must have being awoken prematurely by a member of the staff.\" \"Which member of the staff?\" \"That data has not been entered into the ship's data banks.\" 'That is what the ship's computer came up with.' he thought indignantly. 'Well I guess that it simply thinks that since hibernation pods cannot malfunction it comes up with a highly improbable scenario. I can ask it a set of more complicated questions but I don't want to blow out its logic circuit. Though technically I don't think that that can work.' He then thought that he needed to ask for help from a human expert. \"How can I send a message into deep space?\" \"Deep space messages can be sent from the passengers communication Bay, it is located on level 2 of the Grand Concourse.\" \"Thanks.\" And he walked off. \"Happy to help.\" said the help station. A few minutes later he arrived at the passengers Communication Bay. It was basically just a regular room with a glass door. The glass door opened and he entered. \"Hello.\" said a different voice. \"I would like to send a message please.\" \"Messages can be sent by laser array. This is an expensive service.\" said the voice coming out of the wall. \"Just charge it to me.\" \"Very well.\" said The Voice. He sat down at The Chair by the console. \"To whom within the known universe would you like to send a message to?\" asked the voice coming out of the wall. \"Earth, the Homestead Company.\" said Jim. \"There are over 38'200 references for the Homestead Company on Earth.\" He closed his eyes, and shook his head in confusion to consider a more specific answer. \"I'm immigrating to Homestead II, and I have an emergency.\" said Jim. Out of the 38,000 selections on the screen a single one was highlighted. \"I have a customer helpline for you.\" said the voice coming out of the wall. \"That sounds about right.\" \"Please record your message.\" said The Voice. \"Hi, I'm Jim Preston. I am a passenger aboard the Avalon. And...I'm not quite sure what to say...I think my hibernation pod malfunctioned. I understand that that's not supposed to happen, but I'm the only one awake and everyone else is asleep and the thing is the ship still has 90 years to go before it reaches Homestead 2, and...I don't know maybe it this is all my fault...maybe I missed something...I could just really use some help right now. Thank you.\" He then pressed the little green envelope on the touchscreen on the console in front of him. \"Message sent.\" said the voice coming out of the wall. Jim raised his eyebrows in approval. \"Alright.\" he said feeling that he was making progress now. \"Your message will arrive on Earth in 19 years.\" \"I'm sorry what?\" said Jim in immediate disappointment. \"Earliest possible reply 55 years from now.\" \"55 years?\" he said to himself in disbelief and disappointment. \"We apologize for the delay.\" said the voice coming up the wall. \"Your credit card has been charged $6,000.\" Please review![Chapter 4] Chapter 4 19 hours since Jim woke up: Jim made his way to the elevator and headed back to the hibernation hall where the other passengers were. \"Please buckle up and secure any loose items.\" said the robotic feminine voice in the elevator. He hit the button for the Habitation Module, and buckled in. \"This elevator will experience a momentary lapse in gravity.\" said the robotic feminine voice in the wall. The short ride. Then he exited the elevator. \"Habitation Module.\" said the computer. He made his way to the hibernation hall. There again was hundreds of sleeping people. This was not the only hibernation Hall. There were several Hibernation Halls within the habitation module. He looked around, examining a hibernation pod every now and then. A middle-aged African-American man. An oriental-asian teenage girl with long brown hair. A middle-aged Caucasian woman with short blond hair. One circle of 6 pods seemed to house a family. A middle-aged couple in the first and second pods. While the third pod had what seem to be a girl in her late teens. The 4th pod had a boy in his early teens. The fifth pod had a boy who was a pre-teen. And the sixth pod had a girl barely older than a toddler. There had been some controversy among doctors and fanatic hundreds of years ago about putting younger children into hibernation. But the people who had perfected and re-perfected the hibernation technology over and over again for hundreds of years claimed that putting a young child into suspended animation was medically harmless. Jim was vaguely aware of a little piece of fun fact and trivia that centuries earlier when scientists had first discovered how to put a human into suspended animation, that the first few test subject of the prototypes of the first technology of it had suffered massive organ failure if the reanimation process was done incorrectly. But other than that, today all medical experts say that it's 100% harmless as long as it is done correctly. And that hibernation pods are supposed to be perfect. He eventually found his own hibernation pod. It was a standout among all the others as it was the only one that was empty and the only one that was open. When he found the Pod he look it over. The glass of the hatch was fine, though he wasn't sure that would have anything to do with anything. The lights inside were operating fine. As a mechanical technician he handled the metal on the side at the grooves and on the console panel. It's said that the occupant had been discharged. He found a function saying 'Full Diagnostic', and activated it. There were a series of words and numbers that flash by on the little touchscreen worth and said 'diagnostic complete'. And then claimed that the hibernation pod was operating at 100%, except that the 'Time and Date', were offline. 'No Time and Date?' thought Jim with curiosity. 'Is that normal after an occupant discharge?' He found the circuit board panel on the side underneath the console. He tried to slip his fingernails into the groove but he couldn't. He needed to find himself some tools. He fiddled with his hibernation pod for about another hour until he determined that until he got himself some tools and attempted to take the thing apart, he wasn't going to figure anything out. Well, that was it. Jim Preston was all burnt out. He couldn't think anymore. He was backed into a corner while on a ship in outer space. He had no way to get himself out of the situation. In actuality hadn't exactly thought of everything. Though the additional things that he had not yet thought of little did he know would not work either, but none the less he needed to relax his mind a little take a load off. He went back to the Grand Concourse to just walk around. It's what he would have done on Earth. He would have gone to a mall or taking a walk on the bike trail. As he walks yet shut down his brain so he now felt a little better trying not to think of his dilemma. As he was walking for the first few minutes, looking at all of the different shops and establishments, he then stopped and then backtracked a couple steps because he thought that he saw some movement out of the side of his eye in what seemed to be the ship's Pub. The artificial intelligence Arthur, was a recently constructed new model that had been installed into the ship. Recently being just before they had left Earth. He was one of the more advanced artificial intelligence, personality-wise. He was programmed to actually act human; or at least as close as the A.I. programmers could get it. His primary function was simply to tend bar and serve the customers. And doing that was all that mattered to him. The ship's food synthesizers could artificially manufacturer any quantity of pretty much any drink or beverage known to man. Both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. As a bartender at a pub he normally suggested some alcoholic beverage to a customer that is trying to enjoy themself. However if the customer asks for water, he will serve them a glass of water. If they ask for a Coca-Cola he will serve them a Coca Cola. If someone asks for a glass of spinach juice he would need to wait a minute while the food synthesizer actually artificially manufactures and dispenses it under the bar, but none-the-less that is what he will serve. His artificial intelligence programmed personality was programmed to make him bond with his customers. To be a trustworthy confidant to the passengers and crew on the ship. Though he was designed to physically look human, and programmed to be fully Interactive personality-wise, he was a feeble imitation of a real human being and more or less just a complacent 'Yes Man'. For the 120 years that the passengers and crew were in suspended animation he would basically just stand behind the bar perfectly still. As a robot he doesn't get bored or impatient of the passage of time. But that is a moot point anyway, for when there are no passengers around he goes into low-power mode where he's not even conscious. He had been awakened by the ship's systems that had detected the presence of a potential customer. So he came online and started polishing a glass and wiping down the counters. Though both the glasses and the counters were flawlessly clean. Not even any dust, as there was nothing in the Grand Concourse that really produced any dust. Plus the janitorial robots around the ship were supposed to clean everything regularly while the ship was on low-power mode. Arthur was polishing a glass in the pub when he heard some footsteps up ahead of him near the entrance. He looked up and noticed a customer walk-in. \"Hello.\" said Arthur casually while smiling. And then put his attention back to the glass in his hand that he was polishing. \"Oh my god. It's good to see another face.\" said Jim Preston with a tone of relief. \"I thought I was the only one awake.\" Arthur misunderstanding the words coming out of his mouth merely computed the meaning as that people should be sleeping at that moment. Arthur didn't really consider that everyone was still in hibernation, only two remark on business of the day within the Grand Concourse. \"Who wants to sleep on a beautiful day like this?\" said Arthur. \"No,\" said Jim, \"you misunderstand, we're not supposed to be here.\" Arthur interpreted that that there was something between the two of them that they would both get in trouble for if word about it got out. \"Well then in that case I won't tell if you won't.\" said Arthur with a smile. Jim, thinking that Arthur was a human being, was confused by Arthur's remark. \"What?\" said Jim in confusion. \"Our little secret.\" said Arthur with a smile. Arthur then put down the glass that he was polishing and gave Jim his undivided attention. \"What can I get for you?\" said Arthur with a smile. \"What?\" said Jim again with confusion. \"You look like a whiskey man.\" said Arthur merely guessing but not really knowing. At this point after the day that Jim had had he thought that he could actually use a glass of whiskey, though he was still confused by the behavior of the man in front of him. \"Okay?\" said Jim shrugging his shoulders in surrender. He then saw Arthur turn on the spot and glide to the far side of the bar where he took a bottle of transparent brown tea-colored liquid and then glided back over to his original position. Jim sprinted right up to the bar to look over the edge where he then saw that from the waist down the man was just mechanical gears that were connected on a track in the floor. \"Oh,\" said Jim in comprehension. \"You're a robot.\" \"Android, technically.\" said Arthur. Arthur placed a napkin on the counter as a coaster, placed a clean empty glass on top of it and then poured an inch of the brown liquid into the glass. \"Arthur's the name.\" said Arthur. \"Jim Preston.\" said Jim. \"Nice to meet you Jim.\" said Arthur with a smile and then he put the bottle back. Jim took a tiny sip of the strong cough-medicine-tasting liquid. And then set the glass down. \"Do you possess any technical knowledge about this ship?\" asked Jim. Arthur pretend to think about it for a second as he didn't actually need to think about it but he was following his primary function to act 'semi' like a human. \"I don't know.\" said Arthur. \"I know a few things.\" Arthur in fact did possess extensive knowledge about the ship, but of course unless asked, like he just was, he was programmed to merely carry out his primary function which was to bond with the customers and tend bar. \"What do I do if my hibernation pod malfunctions?\" Arthur's artificial intelligence scanned the data banks for an appropriate answer to the question that came out of Jim's mouth. \"Oh, hibernation pods are Fail-Safe.\" said Arthur adamantly with a smile. \"They never malfunction.\" \"Well mine did.\" said Jim. \"Impossible.\" said Arthur as he began to polish a glass with his clean washcloth again. At this point Jim was so fed up with everything on the ship saying that, that he decided to give Arthur's logic circuit a good workout. \"Tell me Arthur, how long until we reach Homestead II?\" \"About another 90 years or so.\" said Arthur. \"And tell me, when are all the passengers supposed to wake up?\" \"Not until the last four months.\" said Arthur giving his answer straight out of the database through his mouth. \"Then answer this question Arthur, how is it that I'm sitting here with you, having this conversation, right here right now...with 90 years to go?\" Arthur was about to give an immediate answer like his primary function was supposed to but his logic circuit then actually did have a problem; it was faced with a concept that it couldn't comprehend where his logic circuit actually then crashed, but a fraction of a second later his redundant systems did their job by giving it a quick reboot and he still remembered the entire conversation right up to the moment of the logic circuit crash. And he simply gave the answer that his logic circuit had crashed over. \"Hmm, it's not possible for you to be here.\" he said with a smile. \"But yet here I am.\" said Jim. \"Anything that you would like to talk about.\" asked Arthur, detecting the concern in Jim's voice and offering his function of bartender wisdom. Jim thought about that for a second. And then he can sit in an idea, 'why not just go back into hibernation?' He was not entirely sure how to do it, or if the hibernation pod could, but it was worth a try. \"Is there any way to go back into hibernation after someone comes out?\" he asked Arthur. \"I don't know.\" said Arthur. \"I'm not a doctor.\" \"When we bought our tickets and were ready to disembark from Earth we were taken to a facility where medical staff put us into hibernation.\" \"Well, I'm sure that you will think of something.\" said Arthur. Jim downed the rest of his drink. \"Thanks for the drink Arthur.\" \"Anytime Jim.\" Jim suddenly wobbled on his bar stool and held his head. \"It's only been about 21 hours since I came out of my stasis pod.\" Said Jim. \"I think I'm still suffering from post hibernation sickness. I'm going to go back to bed. I'll see you tomorrow Arthur.\" Please review![Chapter 5] Chapter 5 31 hours since Jim woke up: Jim woke up in his cabin. Took a moment to orient himself. Then took a shower. He put on clean clothes, brushed his teeth and went to the colossal communal dining hall. The communal dining hall was all white. It seemed ominous and eerie to be so quiet and empty. He then realized that he had not eaten the day before. So he had kept himself plenty hydrated, his one glass of whiskey the day before probably was a bad idea on an empty stomach especially fresh out of hibernation. He walked up to one of the food dispensers and he waved his ID band over it. The food dispenser chimed and then offered him a selection of items. He pressed the button for hot beverages and then gave him a selection. He selected the 'Mocha Cappuccino Extreme' which he was in the mood for. There was a reprimanding sound from the machine. \"Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme is reserved for Gold Class passengers.\" said the Machine. 'What? You've got to be kidding me!' he thought indignantly. 'After everything else that this ship has thrown at me since I've woken up. I'm starting to think that this ship isn't all it's cracked up to be!' He press the button again to see if it would work. \"Sorry. The mocha cappuccino extreme is reserved for gold class passengers.\" He pressed the button a third time. \"Sorry, the mocha cappuccino extreme is reserved for gold class passengers.\" \"I would like the mocha cappuccino extreme.\" said Jim firmly to the machine hoping that it would respond to his voice. \"Please just bill it to my room.\" \"Sorry. The mocha cappuccino extreme is observed for gold class passengers. If you are unsatisfied selection available for you, food and drink may be purchased in one of the ship's restaurants.\" 'Can't the food synthesizers give me whatever I want regardless of what class of a ticket that I bought?' he thought himself out of curiosity. He pressed the second button on the selection. \"Sorry, the French Vanilla Express is reserved for gold class passengers.\" 'Is everything good reserved for gold class passengers?' he asked himself indignantly. He kept pressing buttons one at a time in quick succession just listening for the word 'sorry'. \"Sorry...Sorry...Sorry...Sorry...Sorry...Sorry...Sorry...Sorry...Sorry...Sorry.\" Then when he finally hit the last button on the list. It was a chime of approval from the machine. \"Large coffee.\" said the Machine. \"Cream and sugar please?\" said Jim. But the machine merely dispense his coffee to him without offering cream and sugar. \"Enjoy your coffee.\" \"Oh wonderful.\" he said sarcastically. He then brought up a selection of food. He then hit the first button though he was pretty sure the food dispenser would not give it to him. \"Sorry. The 'Bacon and Egg Platter' is reserved for gold pass passengers.\" He decided to just hit the last button at the end and spare himself the time and aggravation. \"Bowl of oatmeal.\" said the food dispenser and it then gave him a bowl of plain oatmeal with no sugar on it. \"Thank you.\" he said, though the food dispenser did not thank him back. 'Okay.' Thought Jim while he ate his food. 'What do I do now?' He thought for a little while. 'I'm an engineer. I fix things. Perhaps I can fix the hibernation pod. But first I will need tools and I will need technical manuals.' So after he finished eating he went to the ship's database. He asked questions to the computer about the hibernation technology. The computer said that the hibernation technology was 'proprietary' meaning that the technology belongs to the Homestead Company, and therefore access on how to build hibernation pods was not available to anyone who had not signed a nondisclosure form with the Homestead Company. He searched through the supply section and cargo hold of the ship which was not restricted to passengers. He found an area where hard copy paper documents are kept. He searched through them for hours. There were thousands of them. Day 4 since Jim woke up: He had found the technical documents for the hibernation pods in the ship's cargo hold Library. The technical documents for many of the different Technologies was in alphabetical order so it was not too difficult to find. He studied it for a while. It didn't tell him how to build one, but it did explain the workings of several of its primary functions and a few of the primary components. When he looked through it he was fairly confident that he could work with that. He found a holographic notepad that was a guide through the cargo hold and everything that was stored within it. Much of it was farming equipment and trade goods. But he did find refined materials, of different kinds, spare parts, and tools. He got himself a toolbox with a variety of different items and a few other things. He then went to his hibernation pod. He opened up the circuit board panel and he was pretty sure he could make good headway but he needed to take his time. If the thing was broken he didn't want to break it more. Day 5 since Jim woke up: He wasn't sure what was wrong with it as everything seemed to be in order. But he eventually figured out that a clock chip within the panel on the side had burnt out. According to the technical manuals on his holographic notepad that he was using it said that that couldn't happen. Or rather it was not supposed to happen. But when he ran a computer simulation of a clock chip failure the computer determined that the hibernation pod would begin the reanimation process for the occupant. He went back to the cargo hold where he then looked through the spare parts where he found replacement clock chips. He went back to the hibernation pod where he then took out the burnt-out clock chip and inserted the fresh one. Immediately the display on the touch-screen said that the time and date was now 100% accurate and reliable. He then hit the button to begin hibernation process. Of course he was not entirely sure but he hoped that the Pod would put him back into hibernation. The hibernation pod however would only keep him in hibernation but couldn't put him back into hibernation. He lay down on the comfortable soft surface of the inside where he then just tried to relax as the hatch closed on him. But as he just lay there, nothing happened, he was still very much conscious. After only 25 seconds of this he felt that this was not accurate and he then tried to get out, only he then realized that the hatch had trapped him inside, and after banging on it for about 55 seconds until the Pod realized that the occupant was awake and trying to get out so it let him out. 'Okay, it's not that easy.' he thought. Day 6 In the reactor control room in the engineering section, the reactor computer core module that had been damaged by the small meteorite impact had a live circuit that sparked. It causes a power surge that triggered a high output electromagnetic discharge inside the reactor room itself. The reactor itself was a high output fusion generator that creates a vortex-like cyclone of light glowing blue plasma energy around itself that then reacts with subatomic particles of their universes own space-time in order to generate a very large quantity of electricity. The E.M. surge caused the plasma energy to ignite. It was a small fire, but the reactor maintained the flame. The ship's systems had an emergency feature for just such an event. The systems were supposed to expose the reactor room to the vacuum of space in order to extinguish the fire. But unfortunately that very system was part of the damaged computer module so the system was not able to 'Auto-initiate'. In the meantime the increased heat of the reactor would cause additional malfunctions and burn out processors slowly gradually one at a time throughout the ship. On the diagnostic hologram console on the bridge the 'Red Square' indicating the malfunction of hibernation pod 1498 was still on display, but now a second red square came up as a hologram saying 'janitorial robot 179'. The redundant systems attempted to compensate. But unfortunately the processor that controlled that robot remotely had burnt out causing the robot to permanently malfunction. \"Grand Concourse.\" said the computer as Jim came out of the elevator. Jim started walking away from the elevator when suddenly he almost slipped when he stepped on something underfoot. He looked down and he saw one of the janitorial robots moving around and around in the same spot. It seemed rather unusual to him. It wasn't doing anything; the floor wasn't dirty. There's no garbage to pick up. It seemed as though it had just suddenly lost control of itself. And then stopped and then started zigzagging back and forth. He reached down and he picked up the little robot. He examined it on all sides. He figured that must have been broken or something so he decided that he would take it with him and fiddle with it in his own time. He set it on one of the benches upside down so that it wouldn't go wandering off. Jim went to the pub. Arthur was there polishing a glass. He looked up at Jim and set the glass and cloth down and gave Jim his attention. \"Hello Jim.\" said Arthur with a smile. \"What'll you have?\" \"Whiskey on the rocks, and make it a double.\" said Jim. \"You got it.\" said Arthur. Arthur gave him the drink. Jim took a sip. \"How are you doing, Jim?\" said Arthur. \"Still working on getting back into hibernation.\" said Jim. \"One of the components in the circuit panel on my pod had burnt out. And I know what you're going to say, that it's impossible. But it happened. None the less, I fixed it, but it doesn't help, the pod doesn't put me back to sleep.\" \"Is it really so bad that you are awake at present?\" asked Arthur. \"What do you mean?\" asked Jim. \"There are some people on Earth who are immensely claustrophobic and xenophobic anti-socials. They would love to be in just such a situation like this.\" said Arthur. Jim thought about it for a moment and realized that he was right, but at the same time he was thinking long-term. \"Well I'm not one of those people, Arthur.\" said Jim. \"I'm trying to find a long-term solution. I want to get to Homestead 2, and I want to be alive when I get there.\" \"True.\" said Arthur. \"So what are you going to do?\" \"I'm going to continue to try and find a way to put myself back into hibernation. I know they say that that can't be done, but at the same time there are people in history who have tried to do things everyone told them that it was impossible. But when they really put their mind to it they figured out someway. Not all the time, but sometimes they did. So I'm going to put on my thinking cap and work the problem.\" \"Good for you, Jim.\" said Arthur encouragingly. Day 7 Jim was stretched out in the hot tub in one of the luxury modules many swimming pool areas. There really was nothing like a big vat of warm water to make your muscles relax. He was going to go to the infirmary to see if he could initiate the hibernation process with the medical equipment in there. Though of course he would need a place to go to hibernation in and he would need someone to put him there, but one step at a time. He was working a problem that had never been attempted before. Day 9 He was still looking over medical articles in the ship's database as well as fiddling with some of the medical equipment. He had found no way to put himself back into hibernation. The 'auto-doc' had a number of functions but apparently they required command level authorization. And he couldn't even figure out what those additional functions were anyway. If he was sick from the flu or something, the auto-doc would scan him and administer some mild sedatives but that would be the limit. Day 12 He was taking a break from looking for a way to put himself into hibernation. So far after many days of searching he had not found anything. He thought that maybe if he could get into the bridge or the hibernation room for the crew, he might be able to get his hands and some additional options. He went to the command ring and attempted to get into the bridge. First he hooked a computer up to the control console beside the door and attempted to hack his way past the security. It kept on overriding him every time he thought he had gotten around the security protocol. Plus he was not an expert computer hacker. He attempted to use a power screwdriver to remove the bolts and rivets that held the pieces of metal together. But that was no good. Plus many of the primary pieces were welded together. Day 21 Jim was at the entrance of the crew hibernation room. He had a tinted mask over his eyes and a welding torch in the other hand. He held the super hot blue flame to the seam around the super protective metal door. He didn't know what exactly that reinforced door was made out of but it was completely indestructible. All around the door and several panels down from the door were black with scorch marks from his attempts to break into the room. There was nothing that he could do. He could not get in. Jim was getting very frustrated and impatient. He had tried power-saws. He had tried sledgehammers. And then of course the welding torch. But it seemed that there was no way to break into the bridge or the crews hibernation room. But he kept on trying. Day 24 He had just come from one of the ship's restaurants after eating a steak and baked potato. The ship's waiter robots we're very accommodating, regardless of the fact that the ship had not reached its destination, all of the ships robots carried out their primary function; serve the passengers. To keep a fresh perspective he made sure to alternate back and forth. He kept studying The Sciences within the computer database on the hibernation technology and the medical records of the hibernation process. He still felt that there was no way to do it but none the less he had to keep on trying. He felt that there was just nothing else that he can do except keep on trying. Some people would have given up by now. But Jim prided himself in having a very strong will. Then he went back to trying to break into the bridge. Then when he got tired of trying he went back to studying the data base on hibernation. Then when he got tired of studying hibernation on the database he went to back to trying to break into the crews hibernation room. And back and forth he went. It kept his perspective fresh. But in spite of keeping his prospective fresh, and having a strong will, Cabin Fever was starting to creep in on him. He felt trapped. He felt like he was stuck in a cage. He was starting to believe that there was absolutely no solution in sight. Please review![Chapter 6] Chapter 6 Day 32 Jim's will was starting to crack. His Cabin Fever was getting stronger. He was lonely for human contact. And his perspective that he attempted to keep fresh had grown old and sour. \"Grand Concourse.\" said the computer as he exited the elevator. But at that very moment the door stopped and then rattled and then opened and closed several times as the lights flickered. Jim turned around to observe the unusual technical anomaly. But a few moments later everything was fine. 'What in the world was that?' thought Jim. 'This can't be right?' But at the same time he shrugged it off, his mind still on his loneliness and Cabin Fever. Unbeknownst to Jim, in the bridge at the diagnostic hologram console, there were several giant red squares of Diagnostics claiming that there were malfunctions that the redundant systems were not able to fix. He walked into the pub with a glum face and sat at the bar stool. \"Whiskey Arthur, neat, and make it a double.\" said Jim. \"You got it.\" said Arthur with a smile. Arthur served him the glass full of whiskey. And then went back to polishing a glass. \"I am screwed Arthur.\" said Jim with a tone of hopeless resignation. \"I can't put myself back into hibernation, and I can't break into the bridge. I am completely and royally screwed!\" \"Oh, cheer up Jim.\" said Arthur with a tone of reprimand in his voice but a smile on his face. \"Every cloud has a silver lining.\" \"Well,\" said Jim with a tone of sarcasm, \"I guess I am going to die of old age on this ship.\" \"Well, we all die.\" said Arthur. \"Even Androids end up on the scrap-heap eventually.\" \"Arthur I'm your only customer, why are you always polishing a glass?\" asked Jim out of morbid curiosity and irritation at the fact that it was a useless and pointless action. \"Trick of the trade.\" said Arthur. \"People don't like it when a bartender just stands there.\" \"Well, lay some bartender wisdom on me, I'm lost in space here!\" Arthur then slid on his track in the floor over to Jim and put on a serious face giving him his undivided attention. Arthur's artificial intelligence then pulled out of the ship's database an old but clever quote from a 600 year old article in the Reader's Digest. \"You're not where you want to be.\" said Arthur, quoting the self-help line from the database. \"You feel that you should be somewhere else...well, let's suppose that you could snap your fingers and be wherever you want to be, I bet that you still will feel out of place, not in the right place. Well, there comes a time when you need to stop worrying about where you would rather be, and start thinking more about where you are.\" \"So, what exactly is it that I should do.\" asked Jim. \"Take a break from worrying about where you would rather be, and start paying attention to the benefits of where you are...live a little.\" \"Live a little?\" thought Jim, considering his selfish side, and thinking of just how tired he was of his task. Arthur's logic circuit felt like elaborating a little bit more on the details of what the line meant. \"You have confirmed for yourself with 100% certainty that you can't go back into hibernation.\" said Arthur. \"And you have more or less figured out that you can't break into the bridge with the tools that you have on hand. So, stop trying. And when I suggest to you to stop trying, I'm merely saying for you to not overwork yourself on something that you know that you have no control over. So relax. If you're going to die of old age before we reach Homestead II, then enjoy the luxury amenities of the ship until it happens. And enjoy the 'freedom' that comes with solitude.\" Jim then felt that Arthur was right. He was tired of trying to break into the command ring. And now it was time to take a rest. And not just a slight change of work for his fresh perspective which was starting to not work much anymore, he needed a vacation. And fortunately he was on a luxury liner. He downed the rest of his whiskey. \"Thanks Arthur.\" said Jim. \"Anytime Jim.\" said Arthur with a smile. Jim went to his toolbox. And he got himself the really big thick and heavy crowbar. He decided that for his first step in living a little, he might has well get himself a little bit more square footage in his living chambers. \"Habitation Module.\" said the computer as he exited the elevator. He made his way past the tiny cabins of the low class passengers and made his way to the area of the gold class passengers. The hallway looked a lot better. It was flashier. And had a lot more decorations on the walls. As well as a lot more color. He went to the door of one room that he had observed on the ship's schematics. He put the crowbar into the separation of the door and pried it open. This door was not protected by security or super reinforced. So the force of the crowbar opened the door. He walked in, and the room's sensors detected his presence. \"Welcome to the Vienna Suite.\" said the computer. \"All right!\" said Jim with a smile on his face. \"Now this is what I'm talking about!\" The room was two levels, it had a dining room, a small kitchenette with a food synthesizer, a king size bed, a hot tub, and a super sized bathroom with a wide-open bathtub and shower. The walls also had holographic landscapes for a much more interesting and colorful view besides just the plain gray walls of the low class cabins, or the stars of outer-space. The Vienna suite was reserved for one of the gold class passengers that was currently still in hibernation, but for the time being Jim reasoned that he wasn't using it and he'll be gone long before the passenger wakes up. He did however need to modify the security on his wristband to allow him to come and go. Day 33 He went to the Grand Concourse and explored every store. There were gift shops and clothing shops. There were restaurants both fast food and fine dining. Then he explored the recreational facilities. He went to a standard video arcade from 900 years earlier with old style video games. Apparently there were some people that still like them. Day 34 He went to the 'Dance Off'. It was a large video arcade style room with lots of color and neon lights. A holographic dancer appeared. The dancer would do a cool kind of dance where Jim would then need to mimic the dance as best he could and he would then be scored on it. As time went by he got better and better. And he could also increase the difficulty if he wanted a greater challenge. Day 35 He went swimming in the ship swimming pools which also had water slides and diving boards. Day after day passed. He went to the movies. He indulged in extravagant feast at the ship's restaurants. He tried absolutely every one of the luxury and amenities that the Homestead Company had to offer on the ship. But that's not all he did. Every now and then he would go to the database in the infirmary to study the hibernation technology. Every now and then he would go to the command ring and make some additional feeble attempt to break into the bridge or the crew's hibernation pod room. Day 99 A little over two months of fun now. Non-stop fun with the occasional attempt at the hibernation technology or breaking into the command ring. He had mastered every video game in the video arcade. He had learned how to do a three-point shot in the basketball court every time now. But was a little dull not having an opponent. He now had all of the top scorers on the Dance Off. But Arthur's advice to 'live a little', couldn't keep the cabin fever away forever. And he still craved human contact. Day 152 5 months since he had awakened from hibernation and he was bored stiff out of his mind. 'This is the reason why lazy millionaires are miserable.' he thought. He started to realize that without work, without someone to care for, without a reason for being, having all the essentials for living and more, for free, doesn't make you happy. Arthur was an attentive listener, but a dull conversationalist. He tried to find additional ways to amuse himself. He fed scraps of food to the janitorial robots and was amused by them immediately coming to clean it up, like feeding bread to ducks. He started to drink excessively. He ate until he was sick. He walked around the ship without clothes on. And his Cabin Fever kept getting worse. He tried to make himself feel better with physical exertion. He had taken for himself a punching bag that he got from the ship's fitness center. And he got angry and punched the bag a thousand times until his fists were sore and he was sweating and panting with exhaustion. \"Why am I here?\" he asked himself in anger. He then punched the punching bag again. \"Why does everyone else get to be in hibernation and not me?\" He punched the punching bag again. \"Why am I trapped like this and not be able to make it to Homestead 2!?\" He then punched the punching bag with all his strength 20 times in quick succession until he fell to his knees panting. \"WHY THE FUCK AM I IN THIS SITUATION?\" he screamed at the top of his lungs. He felt like he was locked in a prison cell. A prison cell that was 1,000 meters long that was filled to the brim with good food and every luxury you can think of, but it was still a prison cell. He was not free. And ultimately that is what every man and woman wants, freedom. Day 291 Nine months. Nine months since he had awoken prematurely. Jim Preston had reached a new low. He no longer cared about living. What was the point. The ships recreational facilities could no longer amuse him. He still hadn't found anything on how to put himself back into hibernation. He still hadn't been able to break into the bridge. For the past six months he had taken to breaking down and crying like a little child because he simply felt that there was no way out of his situation. And his moments of breaking down and crying had been becoming more and more frequent. He wandered the ship in a state of despair. He wondered exactly how he could kill himself. Technically there are a-thousand-and-one ways to die. But even a suicidal person needs the guts to actually carry out the act of actually ending his life. For all intelligent creatures have an instinctive desire to preserve their own existence. But his loneliness and Cabin Fever only continued to get worse. He feared for his own life. Not that something would kill him, but that he would kill himself. And while his self-preservation prevented him from actually committing the act of suicide, his fear of death told him that it was still only a matter of time, so he continued to be afraid. During his mindless wandering he was now passing through the Hibernation Hall on the habitation module. He took a long swig from his bottle of vodka that he was drinking straight up, where it then went empty. At least with alcohol there was some relief with the alcoholic buzz in his head. But not this time; he screamed in anger and threw his bottle with all his might and it landed on the ground without breaking and rolled away. In spite of his nine months on the ship he had not explored everywhere that he had access to. And there was one passenger activity that he had not tried. He walked into the airlock that was just off of the Hibernation Hall. Or rather it was an antechamber before the airlock. The computer detected his presence and greeted him. \"Hello Jim. Would you like to take a spacewalk?\" said the computer. There was a display on the screen for the space suits. \"These space suits are designed to withstand the harsh environment of outer space.\" said the computer. \"Please follow all safety procedures. Please be reassured that you will be tethered to the ship's hull by an unbreakable line at all times. The suits are reinforced to be immune to fast moving projectiles or any kind of sharp object. Nothing short of a low yield explosion will breach the suits. Reassurance to you that they are 100% safe.\" In his drunken state he walked right up to the space suit and he closed his eyes and put his arms around it, pretending that it was a real person. But just like his conversations with Arthur, a hard space suit was a feeble imitation of an actual human being, and that's putting it modestly. He put the suit on, and then he went into the airlock. The inner door closed. He then walked over to the outer door where he then saw a flashing button by the door. He tried to push it but it was apparently covered up by a safety switch. Clever, something to prevent a person without a spacesuit from accidentally pushing the button. The instructions told him to lower the safety switch and then push the button. So, he lowered the safety switch, and then his boots magnetized to the metal floor. \"Magnetic boots activated.\" said the computer. \"Magnetic boots can be deactivated by pressing the button on the console on your arm. Have a wonderful time.\" His mind was in a daze as he was trying this. He was sure that it would be an interesting and fascinating experience but at the same time he was still in his state of misery. He press the red button that was behind the safety switch and the outer doors opened which then evacuated the airlock's atmosphere into outer space. His magnetic boots held his suit to the floor preventing him from being blown out. He walked out of the door where a tiny hole on the outer hull of the ship opened up and a mechanical cable snaked out and then attached to the back of his suit. \"Tether attached.\" said the computer. He walked to the edge of the ship. It seemed like there was a path around the edge of the ship for the passengers to take walks on. He looked out at the stars. They were a long way from the neighboring solar systems. Earth's sun, the Terran star, also referred to as Sol, was still nearby in astronomical terms, but they were heading away from it, and it just looked like a regular star when he looked back behind the ship, maybe slightly brighter than some of the others that he saw but none the less there was no sun nearby to light up the day side of the ship. It was complete darkness, except of course for the stars and the ship's lights. They were in close proximity to the red giant star Arcturus. They would slingshot passed it in another year or so on their current course. He thought about letting go of the ship from his boots. From the surface that he was standing on though his boots were magnetized. He could still feel the centripetal force of gravity from the ship spinning. He pressed the button on the console on his arm and his boots demagnetized and he leaped off of the ship. He floated out into space. Of course his tether prevented him from him from truly floating away. Once his tether had reached its limit he then just sat there in the weightlessness of outer space. He looked around at the stars. Thousands of them. Too many to count. And how many stars were those that he could see? He couldn't even see every star in the galaxy. And then the Milky Way galaxy had roughly two hundred billion stars. 200 billion?! And what about the rest of the universe. The rest of the universe has millions of galaxies. Each Galaxy having billions of stars. He then considered that he was such a small and insignificant piece of a much larger universe, and when he looked around in his spacesuit it was just so beautiful. This was an amazing experience, but yet the fact that he couldn't share it with anyone...that he couldn't share it with a wonderful woman...what was the point in going on? What was the point to anything that he had anymore? He activated a function that had the tether ravel him in and he then re-entered the airlock. He exited through the inner door of the airlock and took off his space suit. \"We hope you enjoyed your EVA.\" said the computer. \"We hope that you will join us again for another thrilling experience.\" 'Another thrilling experience?' he thought indignantly. 'Yes. The experiences are thrilling, but pointless in this miserable existence that I live!' He then figured out why there was nothing that he could do about his situation; with the hibernation pods supposed to be so fail-safe, The Homestead Company had taken so many precautions to prevent his current situation from ever happening in a million years in the first place that they lacked imagination on some kind of contingency protocol for if it somehow in the highly unlikely event actually did ever happen for the first time. Like the Titanic with not enough life-boats. 'I can't go on!' he thought with a determination of finality and hopeless despair. He then had an idea. A quick death that would be relatively painless. His face was wet with tears. His eyes were red and bloodshot. He hadn't showered in weeks, hadn't shaved in months, and had bags under his eyes from lack of sleep. He was on a ragged old t-shirt and shorts and barefoot. He walked into the airlock. The inner door closed. He walked to the outer door, where he placed his hand on the safety switch and lowered it. \"Have a wonderful time.\" said the computer thinking that he was wearing a spacesuit and was about to go out. He poised his finger over the red button. Without a spacesuit, the moment his finger touches the red button the outer doors would open and he would be blown out into space. The vacuum of space would explosively decompressed his body...and his suffering would be over. His hand shook as his finger poised over the button. He was afraid. Afraid of death. He did not want to die. As much as he knew that it would be a relief if he did die, he was not prepared in that moment to have his suffering end in this fashion by dying at his own hand. He moved the safety switch back up over the red button and exited through the inner door. He was disgusted with himself that he was just about to kill himself. He ran out of the antechamber and into the Hibernation Hall just wanting to escape the airlock that had almost killed him, although it would have been his fault. He didn't get very far though because he then slipped on his own discarded liquor bottle. His feet flew up into the air and his momentum took him forward where he then slammed flat on his back. He groaned in pain. But at the same time the pain seemed to knock some sense into him. So he just lay there for a while. And decided to just relax on the flat metal floor, surrounded by the hundreds passengers in suspended animation. Once he gets over the pain he would choose to get up. Please review![Chapter 7] Chapter 7 Day 291 Jim lay on the floor trying to compose himself after his failed suicide attempt. Though this 'failed' suicide attempt did not result in his injury, just a very bruised ego. He thought himself stronger than this psychologically, and he had failed himself. He thought himself better than this morally and emotionally, and he had failed himself. He cried for about a minute like a little child. But then he stopped, took a deep breath, let his breath out, and then he felt a little bit better. He turned onto his side and pushed himself onto his hands and knees where he then got to his feet. He stretched out and felt the relief of several joints pop. He turned towards the door that would lead him back to his stolen Vienna Suite, but then he caught sight of something. The occupant of one of the hibernation pods. He took a step closer and realized that it was an extraordinarily beautiful woman. She was Caucasian, had short blonde hair, and clear flawless skin. He didn't know what color eyes she had because her eyes were closed. But simply by her physical appearance in her relaxed state in suspended animation he had never seen a woman more beautiful than her before; though that may have just been exponentially amplified because of his loneliness. He observed the display panel on the side of her pod. Name - Aurora Lane Place of residence - New York City, New York State, USA Occupation - Writer But his attention was focused on her first name. Aurora. Right here right now in this his darkest hour. Why did he only notice her pod now. Of course he had not examined the occupants of every pod on the entire ship. But right now at his strongest moment of suicide he notices her pod and he notices her name. She was beautiful, and she was asleep. Aurora, was the name of Sleeping Beauty in the fairy tale, it was almost like it was a sign. Though that may have just been the alcohol talking. \"Aurora.\" he said out loud. \"Grand Concourse.\" said the computer as he exited the elevator. He ran to the pub. He was eager to sober up so he needed a stimulant. \"Hey Arthur.\" he said. \"Could I get a black coffee please, and make it extra strong?\" \"No problem.\" said Arthur with a smile. \"Just give me a minute to brew it.\" Arthur then reached under the bar to fiddle with the food synthesizer that started to immediately brew extra strong black coffee. \"Arthur?\" said Jim. \"Yes Jim.\" said Arthur. \"I just saw the most beautiful woman that I have ever seen.\" \"Oh?\" responded Arthur. \"She's in a hibernation pod right now.\" said Jim. \"Her name is Aurora. After I down some of that extra strong coffee I'm gonna learn a little about her.\" \" Good for you Jim, and I hope you're feeling better.\" said Arthur encouragingly. \"You've seemed a little glum lately.\" \"Cabin Fever.\" said Jim. \"Ahh.\" said Arthur in understanding. \"Let me know if there's anything that I can do.\" Arthur then handed Jim the ceramic mug full of extra strong black coffee. \"Thanks Arthur.\" said Jim. \"I appreciate it. And I'll let you know. Is it okay if I take the ceramic mug with me? I'll bring it back, I promise.\" \"Of course Jim.\" said Arthur. Jim went to the database computer terminal in one of the rooms on the Grand Concourse. He looked up the passenger manifest list. He found Aurora Lane's name in alphabetical order and highlighted it and hit enter. Her profile came up with a whole bunch of interview videos of her talking to the camera, along with hundreds of pages worth of her work that she had written. He selected her first interview video. If then came up on the holographic screen. And there she was. Looking at the camera and she started telling her story. \"Hi. My name is Aurora Lane. I'm a writer. I'm from New York City. And I would like to go to Homestead II so that I will have an extraordinary story to write and tell.\" \"Your father was Pulitzer Prize winner Oliver Lane?\" said the interviewer who was behind the camera. \"Yes. I guess I have a lot to live up to. No pressure, right?\" Both she and the interviewer laughed at that. Even Jim himself laughed. \"So tell us a little bit more about your profession. Is it just your father who inspired you to write?\" \"Well. I believe, as a writer, that we tell each other stories in order to make contact. To make us believe that we're not alone. \"My father said that if you want to be a writer then the first thing that you need is...well, stories. But you can't just write any old stories, no, you need to write really good stories. And if you live an ordinary life then you will only have ordinary stories. If you want to have good stories to write about, you have to live a life of adventure. So, here I am, ready to make the ultimate leap of faith for the ultimate adventure.\" The interview went on for a few more minutes and then the video ends. Jim gulped at his warm coffee, feeling the bitter taste and strong caffeine revitalize him. He had a new fascination in this woman. Even though he'd only seen her in her hibernation pod for the first time about 55 minutes earlier. He then looked up some of her work. The database on the ship was so big that it held almost half the internet. She wasn't a novelist, but she had written a few short stories for fiction. She was mostly a journalist for a number of different newspapers. She had interviewed celebrities. She had written human interest pieces about random citizens boring lives whenever they did something extraordinary within the community. He wasn't just a sex starved man who was obsessing over a pretty face, he was genuinely interested in her. He listened to her words both when he watched her videos and when he read her work. He always tried to grasp the meaning and message that her method of words tried to impart. Day 305 Jim was showered and clean shaven. Apparently just for reading Aurora's work or watching her videos was something that he liked to make himself presentable for. As though she was actually there in front of him judging him for his appearance. He thought it was silly, but with only Arthur for company what was the point in not being silly. For two weeks he had been obsessed with Aurora's work. He read everything that she had ever wrote. He wasn't just a lonely guy that would settle for any pretty face, no, he had fallen in love with her mind. On the inside she was everything that he wanted in the perfect woman. He was sitting in the pub, drinking a cup of coffee. As he had attempted to cut down on the booze. He had a holographic notepad with Aurora's work downloaded onto it just reading one line after another, his mind assimilating the message that Aurora's work was trying to convey to the reader. \"She is good.\" said Jim out loud half to himself half to Arthur. Arthur was polishing the beer tap. \"Who?\" asked Arthur. \"Aurora.\" said Jim. \"Ah. The sleeping girl.\" said Arthur. \"Have you ever read something and felt like the author was talking directly to you? Or that the content was written just for you?\" \"I don't know.\" said Arthur. \"I don't do a lot of reading.\" Jim was quiet for a while thinking. \"You know Arthur, I have a firm belief that the Universe is not evil, but I will say it does seem to have a cruel sense of humor.\" \"How so?\" asked Arthur. Jim gazed into empty space with a look of both sadness and awe. \"You get to fly through space to another world, but you'll die of old age along the way!\" said Jim in a tone of both disappointment and amazement. \"And you meet the perfect girl...and she's just beyond your reach!...As I said, cruel sense of humor, the Universe.\" \"Interesting concept.\" said Arthur as he had finished with the beer tap and head started on a glass. Jim was in his room, the Vienna suite. Where he was watching another one of Aurora's videos. The interviewer then asked Aurora on the holographic screen, \"What will you miss the most about New York City?\" \"What will I miss the most?\" said Aurora. \"I think what I'll miss the most is the nature of Central Park. The vista of the city lights at night. I love New York City as inspiration for my mind. Give me a cup of coffee and a view of the Chrysler Building and I could write all day. \"They do have coffee on Homestead II, right? If they don't have coffee on Homestead II, I'm going to have to turn around and come back.\" And both she and the interviewer laughed. 'I wish that I could get back into hibernation and have a cup of coffee with you in 90 years.' Jim thought to himself errantly, thinking of Aurora. 'Perish the thought, but maybe the Clock-Chip in your...pod...will malfunction...as well...?' his thoughts strayed off as he began to reflect and contemplate on an idea. He looked over at a technical manual for the hibernation pods. Though he could not put himself back into hibernation, his new found technical knowledge on the hibernation pods could allow him to recreate the accident on a hibernation pod clock chip under controlled conditions. 'No!' he thought to himself in self-condemnation. 'That's insane! You'd be stranding her on the ship the same as yourself!' But at the same time his loneliness and Cabin Fever attempted to override his conscience. Psychologically and morally in a situation like this all a person needs is someone else's permission. \"Grand Concourse.\" said the computer as he exited the elevator. He walked into the pub. \"Hello Jim.\" said Arthur with a smile. \"What can I get for you?\" \"Imagine you were on a deserted island and suicidal with loneliness,\" started Jim, \"but then you possessed the ability to teleport anyone that you wanted to the island to be with you, and then you wouldn't be alone anymore, but to do so would strand them forever as well...would you make that choice?\" Arthur's artificial intelligence scanned the words that came out of his mouth and then analyzed the scenario that Jim had given him only for it to be made completely null and void with the fact that Arthur had no frame of reference from first hand experience himself. \"I don't know.\" said Arthur. \"I have never been on an island.\" \"Okay,\" said Jim, \"forget the island. Let's say that you were all alone for a long time, living and absolute miserable existence, but then suddenly you could bring someone to you who's mere presence would make your life a million times better, but you knew it was morally wrong and once you do it there's no taking it back. How do you make a choice like that?\" For that scenario Arthur's logic circuit simply told him that the scenario was illogical. \"Jim, these are not robot questions.\" said Arthur. Jim paused for a moment but then just let it out. \"I know how to wake up Aurora.\" Jim told Arthur. Arthur smiled and nodded. \"Well that's a fine idea. You could use some company.\" \"Yes, but to do so would strand her on the ship and doom her to die of old age before we reach Homestead II.\" \"Oh.\" said Arthur. \"Well you can't do that.\" \"Arthur, what am I going to do?\" said Jim out loud with a tone of despair. \"Well, you've always got me.\" said Arthur. \"No Arthur.\" Said Jim in a tone of frustration. \"I do not have you.\" He started to poke at Arthur and hit him. \"You are a machine. You don't have feelings.\" He then slapped Arthur in the face. \"You see Arthur. That doesn't hurt. And you probably don't even mind.\" And it was true. Arthur did not have the capacity to feel offense. His logic circuit told him that it was unusual behavior for a customer, but he was not offended by anything that Jim did. Day 307 He was in the hibernation room standing beside Aurora's pod just looking at her. Admiring her face. He was wanting to wake her up, while at the same time not wanting to cuz he knew that it was wrong. Day 310 Jim stood beside Aurora's hibernation pod as he looked at her. He got down on his knees beside the pod and he pulled out the circuit board panel. He then placed two electrical wires on either side of her clock chip. He then lifted the electrical circuit that he was going to activate which would charge far too much power through the chip which would then cause it to be interrupted from the time and date setting on her pod's computer core. But just before he did it, his conscience told him, 'No! Don't do it!' where he then remove the two electrical leads to the chip where he then packed up his toolbox and walked out of there. The thing is is that this is not the first time that this had happened. He had already attempted this the day before. And the day before that. And two days before that. Several times he thought about it and then stopped himself before he really did anything. This was all that went on inside of his head. His loneliness and Cabin Fever would tell him to do it and he would make up his mind to do it, where his conscience and moral judgment would tell him to not do it. Day 328 He had made up his mind a couple dozen times to wake up Aurora we're then his conscience told him to not do it. It was getting out of hand. Was driving him crazy. Today however he made a resolution. He was going to stop thinking about her. He was going to cut her off. He wasn't going to go and visit her pod anymore. He walked into the pub and there as always was Arthur who was waiting for him. \"Hello Jim. What can I get for you?\" \"Beer, make it a pint.\" \"You got it.\" Arthur took out a large pint glass and filled it to the top from the tap with the clear transparent yellow foamy liquid. Arthur gave it to him, and then picked up a glass and clean rag and started polishing the glass. \"You seem to be a little bit more cheery today.\" said Arthur in observation. \"Yes Arthur, because, I would like to announce that there will be no more Aurora talk. I'm over it. Done. You're not going to hear me talk about Aurora anymore.\" \"Good for you Jim. I'm proud of you.\" said Arthur with a smile. But Jim sat there for a little while and silently pondered. \"Of course I have to stop thinking about her.\" he reasoned logically. \"What am I going to do, just think about her for the rest of my life? I mean, it's like an addiction. You can't just keep going after the thing that you can't have. An addict needs to avoid the thing that he is addicted to. When an alcoholic is trying to get over alcohol do you think he's just going to sit around all day with a bottle of whiskey right in front of him?\" Arthur just nodded as a person who wasn't attentive listener would do. Jim's reasoning seemed sound but Jim himself, could he really commit to that. Day 339 Sometimes he went several days without visiting Aurora in the hibernation Hall. He continued to talked on and on about Aurora all the time in the pub. Arthur, continuing to carry out his primary programming of bonding with his customers was just a complacent yes-man. Always agreeing with Jim no matter what Jim said. Jim had been spending an extra amount of time with Arthur in an attempt to overcome loneliness, for what good company Arthur was. He still continued to make up his mind to wake her up again and again, and again and again kept telling himself not to do it and he didn't. Ultimately nothing has changed since his resolution that he was over her. He continued to make the occasional feeble attempt to find a way to put himself back in hibernation, or to break into the bridge. But his attempts were becoming feebler and feebler and significantly less frequent. Day 386 He stood beside Aurora's hibernation pod with his toolbox. This was it. For the thousandth time he had made up his mind to wake her up. His conscience was telling him not to do it, but it was different this time. He wasn't in his right mind. He truly was crazy and insane. His loneliness and Cabin Fever had not been higher. He knelt beside the hibernation pod and opened up the circuit board panel just like he'd done several times already. 'Don't do it you fucking coward!' his conscience reprimanded him. And he was sick to his stomach with the guilt of what he was about to do. While his loneliness and Cabin Fever, which had never been higher, kept telling him, 'you're going to commit suicide if you don't wake her up so at this point it's either you or her.' His loneliness and Cabin Fever also told him that, 'maybe she would understand one day.' His conscience told him, 'what if she doesn't even like you.' And around and around his conscience and loneliness went. Several times a second it went around and around. He wanted to shoot himself in the head with guilt. He wanted to throw up with guilt. But at the same time he just didn't want to be alone anymore. He couldn't stop himself. He put the two electrical leads on the clock chip. He couldn't stop himself. He shut his eyes, and wanting to shoot himself with guilt, he charged the wire with electricity. Please review![Chapter 8] Chapter 8 Aurora Lane breathed deeply as she felt consciousness. Her body felt like lead. She couldn't remember anything or why she was there. Her mind was a complete blank. \"Good morning Aurora.\" said a pleasant feminine voice from directly in front of her. \"How are you feeling?\" Aurora blinked her eyes open, but did not answer the question. She then noticed a holographic woman right in front of her. \"It's perfectly normal to feel confused. You just spent 120 years in Suspended animation.\" Then some started to come back to her. \"Just breathe Aurora.\" said the holographic woman. \"Everything is okay. Let's take a look at your vitals.\" Aurora, still trying to remember, but visually aware of everything around her now, noticed that her pod was being mechanically moved over to an area which was basically a giant laser scanner. The giant laser scanner swept over her and then a holographic display came up off to the side which then showed her vitals. \"We're on the Starship Avalon, right?\" said Aurora through the scratchy voice of a dry throat. \"That's right Aurora.\" said the holographic woman. \"The Homestead Company's Premiere Interstellar Starliner. We have nearly completed the voyage from Earth to Homestead 2. Your new home. A new world, fresh start, room to grow.\" \"Slogans in advertising.\" said Aurora rolling her eyes. \"The Avalon is on Final Approach. For the next 4 months you will experience space travel at its most luxurious, food, fun, friends.\" Aurora put on a small smile. \"The ID band on your wrist is your key to the wonders of the Avalon. Unlike many of the other passengers on the ship you are a Gold-class passenger. This affords you special privileges among the many luxury amenities aboard the ship.\" The holographic display off to the side showing her vitals gave a pleasant chime. \"You are in perfect health Aurora. Let's get you to your cabin so that you can get some rest. Please go down the aisle until you find door number 401.\" Aurora felt that she was strong enough to walk so she managed to to climb out of her hibernation pod and stumble her way down the aisle towards the door. When she reached the door she paused, and then she looked around. Every other hibernation pod was still occupied. Normally a newly awakened passenger would not be lucid enough to notice this, but everyone is different, and some passengers are more lucid after they wake up than others. She frowned in confusion at this anomaly but she went through the door. She was only wearing a tank top and shorts. Which was the standard clothing for being in hibernation. \"If you are so inclined, please change into some gray pajamas and a bathrobe.\" She took some grey pajamas and a bathrobe of her size and went into a cubicle. She put the gray pajamas on over her tank top and shorts and then put on the gray bathrobe. \"Please go to the end of the hall and then turn left.\" said the voice of the computer. \"You may be experiencing post hibernation sickness.\" Aurora made her way there and then turned. \"Your door will illuminate for you.\" said the computer. She saw the illuminated door and walked towards it. When she reached her door she continue to look up and down the hallway and still noticed no people. She was either the first to wake up, or everyone else was in their rooms. But at the same time she had not seen any other empty hibernation pods. She was becoming more and more curious about this by the second. She waived her right hand over her door and the door sensor detected her ID band. The door gave off a pleasant chime and the door opened for her. She walked into a long hallway. \"Welcome to the Utopia Suite.\" said the pleasant feminine computer voice. The lights came on as she entered her room. She then saw the holographic woman that was right in front of her face when she had woken up. \"Welcome to your cabin, your home until we make landfall. For the next four months you will prepare for your new home on Homestead 2. Meet your fellow passengers, take skill building classes, and learn about Colonial living. You have been assigned to learning Group 17, for people with creative and artistic talents. Please scan your ID to confirm luggage delivery.\" She then looked over at the side of the wall and saw that her bags had appeared out of a hidden compartment in the wall. She waved her right hand over the holographic woman where it then detected her ID band on her right wrist. A hole in the wall then produced a tall plastic glass which then dispensed a stream of pink water. \"To help recover from hibernation sickness please drink plenty of fluids. Also to recover from hibernation sickness we highly encourage you to take a nap for the rest of the day. Please enjoy the rest of your stay aboard the Avalon, a Homestead Company Starship. Then the holographic woman disappeared. Aurora gulped down the entire glass of pink water where she then put it back into the water dispenser. \"Can I get some more please?\" she said while looking at the water dispenser. On que, the water dispenser, as though hearing her voice and being fully interactive, refilled the glass. Where she then began to gulp that down as well. She looked around her room. It was large and luxurious with lots of square footage. She went into the other room where she found a bathroom with a large wide open shower and bathtub. In the bedroom she found a queen sized bed along with a lot of closet space. Out in the main area she found a sofa along with a small kitchenette and dining room table. But at the same time she was more curious about the anomaly of her being the only one awake back in the hibernation Hall. She went over to the small kitchenette and she found the function for the food synthesizer to brew her a pot of coffee. After a little bit of studying, she realized that it was voice operated. \"Black coffee please.\" said Aurora to the machine. The coffee begin to brew and in about 55 seconds there was a full pot for her. She found a ceramic mug, filled it and started to drink. The black strong liquid was scolding, but she did not leave her cabin until she had finished two full mugs. She still felt extremely sleepy. Thinking how ironic it was that she needed to sleep after she wakes up from suspended animation, she exited her cabin and walked down the hall towards the hibernation Hall. When she came into the hibernation Hall again surprised to see that all of the other hibernation pods we're still occupied and not a single one was empty. \"Hello.\" she called out. \"Is anybody here?\" She went back into the hallway leading to all the cabins. \"Hello. Is anybody here?\" She still received no answer. She continued to call out, \"hello, is anybody here\", over and over again. She made her way to the elevator after she had searched up and down the habitation module for a while. The elevator then transported her to the large luxury module across the way. \"Please buckle up and secure any loose items.\" said the computer. \"This elevator will experience a momentary lapse in gravity.\" A short ride later. \"Grand Concourse.\" said the voice of the computer as she exited the elevator. \"Hello. Is anybody here.\" She continued to call out. She was starting to get worried. 'What in the world was going on?' She couldn't figure it out. 'Why was no one else awake?\" \"Hello?\" she heard a man's voice from across the Grand Concourse. She turned in the direction of the voice and there was a man walking towards her. He was dressed in dirty work pants and a button-up shirt. His hair seemed clumsily recently cut, and the five o'clock shadow on his face showed a couple days growth. He seemed hesitant as though he was extraordinarily surprised to see her. \"Hi. Are you passenger or crew?\" asked the Aurora. \"Passenger. My name is Jim Preston.\" \"Aurora Lane.\" said Aurora. \"Where is everybody? No one else in my group down in the hibernation Hall woke up with me?\" \"Same for me.\" said Jim Preston. Aurora then tried to contemplate what that meant exactly. \"Are you saying that nobody else is awake?\" asked Aurora. \"Just me.\" said Jim \"Just you?\" said Aurora in disbelief. \"Just us.\" Jim corrected more thoroughly clarifying. \"But this can't be right.\" said Aurora. \"We're supposed to be landing soon.\" \"You are in for a rude awakening.\" said Jim with a tone of half sarcasm half sadness. \"I determined shortly after I had woken up that my hibernation pod had suffered a very unlikely system failure which started the reanimation process of my hibernation pod early. My guess is that somehow it happened to yours as well.\" \"Hibernation failure?\" said Aurora as she put on a look of confusion. \"I was under the mistaken impression that that was impossible.\" \"That's what I've been told my whole life, including by the ship's computer ever since I woke up.\" said Jim. \"But first let me show you.\" He led her to the observatory. When they walked into the room everything went dark and a thousand holographic Stars appeared in the air around them. \"Welcome to the observatory.\" Said the computer in a deep loud masculine echoy voice for dramatic effect. \"What can I show you?\" \"Show me Homestead 2.\" said Jim Preston. \"Homestead 2 is the fourth planet in the Bakty System.\" said the computer. \"And where are we now?\" asked Jim. \"We are currently enroute from Earth to Homestead 2. We will arrive in approximately 89 years.\" \"89 years?\" said Aurora indisbelief. \"How can the be? Why did our hibernation pods malfunction now? Where's the crew?\" \"Let me show you.\" said Jim. He brought her out of the observatory and then took her to the elevator. He hit the button for the command ring. \"Please buckle up and secure any loose items. This elevator will experience momentary lapse and gravity.\" After the short trip to the command ring. They walked down the ring that was so small that you can actually see the curve in the floor and ceiling. He then brought her to a door. He waved his ID band on his right wrist over the door sensor where it gave off a chime and the door opened only to reveal her more reinforced door. Around the door panels were scorch marks from fire or a blowtorch that Aurora had noticed. It was also burning scorch marks on the reinforced door which still appear to be completely intact. She walked around some cluttered tools that were on the floor. She gazed through the very small window in the door and saw more hibernation pods. \"The crew is in a secure hibernation chamber.\" he said. \"Everything in the command ring are super reinforced. Other than the infirmary and a supply room we can't get in.\" Aurora, still in a state of shock and disbelief stepped away from the door and then looked around at the clutter on the floor. It appeared to be boxes and dulled power saws. A sledgehammer. Some crowbars. And a few blow torches with empty fuel cartridges. \"How long have you been awake?\" she asked fearing the answer. \"A year and 3 weeks.\" said Jim. Aurora then started to have a full-scale anxiety attack. She felt a charge of adrenaline. She felt her heart pounding in her chest. She suddenly found it extremely difficult to breathe. \"No! No, no, no, no, no! This can't be happening!\" \"Aurora?\" said Jim formally in an attempt to calm her. \"We have to get back to sleep!\" said Aurora in a panic. \"We need to go back into hibernation!\" She ran to the elevator and went into it before Jim could get to her. Jim went to a different elevator. \"Habitation module.\" said the computer as Aurora ran out of the elevator in a panic. She made it to the hibernation Hall where she then was surrounded by hundreds of occupied hibernation pods. She ran up and down the aisles trying to find her hibernation pod, believing that if she could get back her back into hibernation and she could forget about all of this. She was then grabbed from behind and spun around where she was face-to-face with Jim Preston and he held her by the shoulders firmly. \"It doesn't matter Aurora!\" said Jim firmly. \"It doesn't matter.\" But when he realize that he was holding her tightly by the shoulders he felt that maybe that was border lining on physical harassment and he quickly withdrew his hands. \"I will help you find your hibernation pod.\" In the last 10 seconds she had calmed down just a little bit and nodded at his offer to help her find the Pod. They got to the hibernation pod. \"I have been studying the hibernation pod technical manuals for months.\" said Jim Preston. \"You can start the thing up again and you can climb back in but it won't do you any good. Remember the facility that we went to back on Earth before we left orbit. All of those medical procedures that they put us through and then we fell into a dreamless coma? You can only go into hibernation under medical supervision from a team of doctors. The hibernation pods are only intended to keep us in hibernation but once we come out of hibernation we can't go back into hibernation.\" In spite of the two cups of coffee, she was still feeling physically fatigued and her mind was starting to go fuzzy again as her eyes kept drooping and her head got heavy. \"You know what Jim?\" said Aurora. \"I know that I should be working the problem, but right now I just feel so...drained.\" \"Hibernation sickness.\" said Jim. \"I experienced it myself when I woke up. Though I don't think I was as lucid as you. When I went to my cabin when I first woke up I fell asleep on my bed right away for many hours. When you get out of suspended animation it'll be a few days until you're at full strength. You really should take a nap.\" \"I think you're right.\" said Aurora and then she started to make her way towards her room. \"I will walk you to your cabin.\" said Jim trying to be helpful. \"That's unnecessary Jim. Thanks though.\" She walked ahead of him for a few steps or she stopped and then turned around towards him. \"A year? All by yourself? I can't imagine. It must have been hard.\" \"It was.\" said Jim. \"Good night Jim.\" said Aurora. \"Goodnight Aurora.\" said Jim. Jim Preston went to the pub. Arthur then appeared right in front of him from behind the bar and gave him his attention. \"Hello Jim. What can I get for you?\" \"Whiskey, neat.\" \"Sure thing.\" A few moments later Arthur had placed a napkin on the counter as a coaster, placed a clean empty glass on the napkin, and poured an inch of whiskey into the glass. \"Thanks.\" said Jim. \"No problem.\" said Arthur. Arthur then put the bottle of whiskey back and then was in front of Jim again where he then started polishing a glass. Arthur noticed that Jim had a face that was full of distress. \"What's the matter Jim? You look extremely more glum today than normal.\" \"I woke up Aurora.\" said Jim with a tone of extreme regret in his voice. \"Congratulations.\" said Arthur with a smile on his face. \"I killed her Arthur.\" said Jim with a tone of more guilt than anyone had ever had before. \"I took her life. She will die of old age before she reaches Homestead 2. She can't go back to sleep, and she is stranded on this ship just the same as I am.\" \"I see.\" said Arthur contemplating the full ramifications towards Aurora's life from Jim's actions. \"Well, I guess that there is only one thing that you can do.\" \"What's that Arthur?\" asked Jim. \"Take full advantage. You may feel guilt and regret your actions of waking her up, but at the same time right here right now, to not take full advantage of her companionship now would mean that your waking her up was all in vain.\" \"True.\" said Jim in agreeance. And of course under his cabin fever and loneliness he only woke her up for companionship, so of course he already had planned, with or without guilt, to take full advantage of whatever companionship she could offer. Still though, just like his conscience had stopped him from waking her up a thousand times for the last 3 months, he wish that he could go back and choose to not wake her up one more time. But it was done. The matter was over with. The only thing he could do now is look to the Future. And if it was any consolation to her he had every intention of kissing her ass for the rest of her life. \"Arthur can you keep a secret?\" asked Jim. \"Jim.\" said Arthur with a tone of disappointment on his face as though Jim would even ask such a question. \"I am not just a bartender, I am a gentleman.\" \"Don't tell Aurora that I woke her up. She thinks that was an accident. Let me tell her in my own time.\" \"Of course.\" said Arthur. Please review![Chapter 9] Chapter 9 Day 387 since Jim woke up Aurora Lane, woke up. She was still in the gray pajamas that she had been dressed in by the ship after she came out of stasis. The reality of her situation came back to her, she was stuck on a ship that was not going to reach Homestead 2 before she died of old age. None-the-less, she was going to try to solve the problem. She was going to work the problem. She got out of bed. She told the food synthesizer in the kitchenette to brew her a pot of coffee. She stripped down to nothing, where she then went into the giant wide open shower. She revitalized in the hot water that poured down on top of her from above. She washed her hair. And then got out. She rubs herself down with a large thick fluffy white towel. She brush her teeth. She dried and fixed her hair to be presentable. She went to her luggage and dressed herself in casual attire, or at least semi-formal-casual. She had always lived an extravagant lifestyle, mostly because her father had a lot of money. She pulled out an electronic device; a holographic notepad with a microphone with voice recognition technology. She turned it on, selected a function and hit 'Voice Typing'. \"Journal Entry,\" said Aurora out loud to the empty room at large, \"Aurora Lane...July 24, 2950,\" The holographic screen automatically typed out everything she said word for word. \"Something has happened to me. I am aboard the Starship Avalon, just as I am supposed to be. Except for the fact that I have awoken from hibernation prematurely. My hibernation pod somehow malfunctioned. From everything that I have heard my whole life, that is supposed to be impossible. But yet it happened. I'm going to attempt to work the problem. I'm going to try to figure something out. Right now I'm starving and a little hungover. I think that's the result of hibernation. I'm going to go find something to eat. \"End entry.\" \"Grand Concourse.\" said the computer as she exited the elevator. She walked over to the ship's computer 'Help Station'. \"Hello.\" said the artificial intelligence. \"Welcome to the Grand Concourse, how can I help you?\" \"I would like information about hibernation technology.\" said Aurora. \"Human hibernation is a delicate medical process, involving the membrane bonding of all cells in the body in order to Halt aging, electrifying the muscles to prevent atrophy, oxygenation of the brain,reducing body temperature, as well as a balanced flow of electrolytes in order to prevent dehydration as well stopping all metabolic activity so the human body does not produce any waste.\" explained the help station. \"All hibernation technology is 100% effective with perfect redundancies to ensure the life and safety of the occupant of a hibernation pod.\" \"But what about hibernation pod malfunctions? What would happen to the occupant?\" asked Aurora not satisfied with the answer. \"Hibernation pods are Fail-Safe. They cannot malfunction.\" said the help station. \"But my hibernation pod did malfunction. What am I supposed to do?\" said Aurora frustrated. \"Hibernation pods are Fail-Safe. They cannot malfunction.\" Aurora I was starting to get really irritated at this. \"What is a passenger supposed to do if they wake up before the crew?\" asked Aurora, now not believing she'll get a satisfactory answer. \"Passengers do not wake up until 4 months before they arrive at their destination. The crew wakes up five months before the ship arrives at their destination.\" \"But what if a passenger wakes up before the crew? What do they do then?\" \"Passengers do not wake up until 1 month after the crew.\" said help station again. \"HYPOTHETICALLY...!\" yelled Aurora in indignation. \"What's a passenger supposed to do if they do wake up early, what if hibernation pod malfunctions?\" \"No hibernation pod has malfunctioned in thousands of interstellar flights.\" \"Well...I'm awake.\" she said in exasperation. \"I see that you have been enjoying the helpful advice of the ship's computer.\" said Jim half sarcastically as he walked up behind her. \"Yeah.\" she said exasperated. \"This help station is the stupidest thing.\" \"Want to get something to eat?\" asked Jim. \"Yes.\" said Aurora. \"I'm starving.\" \"Happy to help.\" said the help station as they walked away. But then the Hologram around the help station fluctuated and then shut off briefly. Unbeknownst to Jim and Aurora down in the reactor room the fire that was being fueled by the plasma energy ring had grown significantly. The temperature within the reactor room was hundreds of degrees warmer than it was supposed to be. Still tolerable levels, but none-the-less the increased temperature cause power fluctuations throughout the ship. With the power fluctuations processors burnt out. Up on the bridge in the command ring at the diagnostic station, there were dozens of giant red holographic squares each displaying a failed system that the Redundant systems were not able to fix. The most recent one that came up was a malfunction in the Help Station on the Grand Concourse. The word 'repairing' flashed on the giant red square where a few moments later the giant red square turned green and then disappeared as the Redundant systems had successfully covered for that failed system. Aurora had gone to the bathroom on their way to the communal dining room, while Jim went on ahead and ordered his traditional gruel. A few minutes later Aurora caught up. Jim's back was to her while he listened to the beeping sounds of the scanning of her ID band. And then the words, \"Gold Class breakfast.\" coming from the computer. He looked at her longing for that kind of a breakfast here in the dining room but if he wanted it he would have to go to one of the restaurants to purchase it at full price. She sat across from him at the table that he was at. Her tray was filled with not a lot of any one thing, but a little of everything, which added up to a large portion meals. Eggs, both fried and scrambled, hash browns, both shredded and cubed, ham, bacon, breakfast sausage links, one small pancake, one small waffle, and several different desserts though only one bite to each. She looked at his bowl of plain oatmeal with no sugar on it. \"You're a man of simple tastes.\" said Aurora in observation with a laugh in her voice. \"I'm not a gold class passenger. This is all that the food dispenser will give me.\" All the sudden she looked appalled. \"Are you serious? For an entire year? What can I get you?\" she said as she stood up and walked over to the food dispenser. \"No Aurora,\" said Jim, \"that's okay, it's unnecessary.\" \"I insist.\" she said. \"Okay.\" he said in quick acceptance and not arguing. \"Gold Class breakfast.\" said the food dispenser and a second later she brought over a second tray identical to the one that she had. He pushed his oatmeal away and started to devour his food with a groan of pleasure. \"So, I was thinking.\" said Aurora. \"Maybe there's another way to go back to sleep.\" \"I know what you're doing.\" said Jim in a friendly tone of voice of understanding. \"You're looking at this with a fresh perspective, unlike me. Just the thing is a fresh perspective is not going to find a solution. You can only go into hibernation under medical supervision with specialized procedure and treatment.\" \"Well what about the Infirmary?\" asked Aurora. \"I checked there. It's just a medication dispenser and an autodoc.\" \"Or maybe the autodoc can put us into hibernation.\" \"From what I've checked from it, it can't.\" \"Well what about the hibernation pods. Maybe there's an extra hibernation pod in the cargo hold.\" \"I checked there too. It's mostly just farming supplies and trade goods.\" \"Well perhaps we could build another one?\" \"It's not additional hibernation pods that we need. Both our hibernation pods are perfectly fine. I checked yours out this morning. Unless there's a team of doctors perform the procedure on us to put us into hibernation there is nothing that we can do.\" \"Come on Jim.\" Said Aurora this time with impatience in her voice. \"It's like you're not even trying.\" He then lifted his arms to behold the large dining hall. \"Umm, duh, hello.\" as though to express the obviousness of the hopelessness of the situation. \"Look around, look at me right here right now; I have tried. For over a year. I tried everything.\" Aurora slumped in her chair in disbelief, unwilling to accept the situation. \"Well, as you said I'm here with a fresh perspective. So I'm not quite ready to give up yet.\" For the rest of breakfast they sat in companionable silence. Once Jim's plate was empty he put it back into the food dispenser. \"Thanks a Lot.\" he said gratefully with a smile. \"I appreciated it. Is there anything that I can do for you?\" \"I'll let you know.\" Within the computer core that was still damaged from the meteorite Strike, some live circuits sparked triggering power surges throughout the ship which burned out some additional processors. Up on the bridge at the primary diagnostic hologram console there was a red square that appeared as a hologram displaying 'janitorial robot control'. Jim was sitting in the hot tub near the swimming pool at the time when he saw one of the janitorial robots appear from the hallway and then zigzaged back-and-forth apparently not able to know exactly what it was doing or where it was going. The robot continued to act up for about a minute until Jim got out of the hot water and walked over to it and picked it up. He flipped it over onto its back where he then hit it's cut off switch. In the one year since he had woken up this was the eighth robot that had malfunctioned. He had taken them apart to determine what was wrong. The robots were supposed to have a wireless connection to the ship's computer, and the ship's computer was supposed to control them. The robots that he had found that had malfunctioned apparently had lost their connection to the ship's computers so apparently they were just mindless machines that wandered aimlessly with no directive or primary function. He was curious to the anomaly, but apparently had no idea what was causing it. He had begun working on them to see if he could fix them. They were in relatively good condition, but without a connection to the ship's computer they were little better than remote control cars. Day 396 It had been 9 days since Aurora had woken up. She sat in her cabin with a mug of extra strong coffee. Her holographic notepad was at her side. \"Journal Entry...Aurora Lane,\" said Aurora as she voice typed to her holographic notepad, \"I boarded the Avalon with a purpose, a destination. But it seems that all of that is pointless now. I have not completely given up hope, no. But it seems that there's no way out of my situation. I have attempted to break into the bridge and the crew hibernation rooms. I cannot wake the crew. I cannot get to the central computer. I searched the infirmary and there's no way to go back into hibernation. I've consulted the database on countless different to Scientific matters. Certain information is restricted and can't give it to me, and theoretical data isn't helping. There is one other person on board, a mechanic by the name of Jim Preston. He claims his hibernation pod malfunctioned as well. He seems to have given up hope, though he's tried everything that I've tried for a lot longer and hasn't gotten anywhere, and he's the one with the technical skills of the two of us. His hibernation pod malfunctioned over a year ago. I don't know what to do...end entry.\" She put her holographic notepad away, and then put on her favorite white bathing suit. She walked from her cabin to the swimming pool. It was a large pool and it was deep complete with diving boards. She set her robe aside and then dived into the slightly chlorinated lukewarm water headfirst. She did the freestyle stroke for several laps enjoying the weightlessness of the ebb of deep water as well as the softness and feel of the lukewarm water around her body. She tried to think. She knew that her life was in ruins if she couldn't go back to sleep. For the past nine days it was not uncommon for her to break into tears occasionally. But she still hoped to find a solution before long. Please review![Chapter 10] Chapter 10 Author's note: Sorry for the delay in the update. For health reasons I was unable to focus on my writing. Day 398 Aurora and Jim were in the giant communal dining room. She gave him a Gold Class breakfast every morning. They exchanged a few words, but they were relatively quiet to each other. She liked him, he seemed nice. And he was relatively good looking. She tried to imagine just such a situation. She thought of herself as an attractive woman though she never consider herself vain or shallow, she wondered why Jim wasn't throwing himself at her. Though at the same time he would be sympathizing with her and he's probably just trying to be a gentleman. A guy who's been what he's been through for a year would no doubt want some, 'action' from a woman like her. But at the same time she herself wasn't going to throw herself at him, as she didn't consider herself a slut or anything. Plus, she hardly knew him. \"You going back to the command ring with the tools?\" asked Jim. \"I wouldn't judge you or blame you if you did.\" Aurora knew that he had already tried all of this for much longer than she had but at the same time she still had to try just a little while longer, but for today she's going to try to take a load off of her mind. She may die of old age on this ship, but she was still on a luxury liner, she'll take full advantage of the space. \"Actually I'm going to go for a jog.\" said Aurora. \"Several twisting and turning miles of empty hallways through this colossal ship; I like it.\" \"Sounds refreshing for the mind.\" said Jim, wondering why he hadn't tried it before himself. The ship of course had fitness centers, but perhaps a long stretch of running might be more stimulating than the treadmill. He finished his food, and put his tray away. \"You enjoy your run.\" said Jim. \"I'll see you later.\" \"What are you going to do?\" asked Aurora. \"I'm going to fix up some malfunctioning robots.\" said Jim. \"What's going on with the robots?\" \"Apparently every now and then one of them just stops working properly.\" He then walked off while Aurora finished her food and then went back to her cabin. She changed into a comfortable athletic outfit and then started her slow jog up and down the corridors of the ship. She thought some more about her situation. Wondering if perhaps they'll figure something out and maybe find a way to go back into hibernation. She then realized that Jim hadn't completely given up, just slowed down his efforts because his fresh perspective had long since run out. Also she wondered about him in greater detail. Why did his hibernation pod malfunction? Why was he here? And if it was so unlikely or completely impossible that so much as a single hibernation pod would malfunction how was it that two have malfunctioned within a short time apart from each other? One year being a short time. It did not occur to her that her pod might have been sabotaged by him. She didn't really truly think that anyone was capable of that, though she'd never given it much thought. She had given him the benefit of the doubt and believed and considered only the story that was given to her that her pod had malfunctioned. But she wanted to know more about Jim. She wanted to get back to her job that she was hoping to do when she had woken up. Her job of being a journalist. She was going to interview the passengers on the ship during the four-month period of skill building classes and Recreation before they land. And then she was going to interview the colonists on the surface of the planet. Once she had worked up a sweat and she felt her muscles burning, she went back to her cabin where she then took a shower and then changed into semi formal casual clothing. She picked up her voice recorder and her voice typing holographic Notepad. \"Locate Jim Preston.\" she commanded the computer. \"Jim Preston is in the forward section of the third level dining room on the Habitation Module.\" said the computer. Jim was at one of the hundreds of empty tables in the colossal communal dining room. He had a half dismantled janitorial robot in front of him as well as a pile of tools. He looked up when he sensed someone's presence within close proximity to him. He saw Aurora standing over him with a serious face. Aurora activated her audio recorder and her voice typing function on her holographic notepad. \"Why did you do it?\" she asked, question generalized. 'Oh no!' thought Jim in a panic while still remaining composed. 'Busted!...No, wait? Maybe it's not what you think. Just play dumb.' \"Do what?\" he asked for clarification of her question. \"Immigrate.\" said Aurora. \"Leave Earth?\" \"Why do you ask?\" \"I'm interviewing you.\" said Aurora, acting formal, and professional. \"I'm a journalist.\" She then sat down at the table across from him. \"What?\" said Jim in disbelief and confusion. \"You're the first hibernation failure in the history of space travel.\" said Aurora. \"That makes you a story.\" \"Who are you going to tell?\" \"Posterity.\" said Aurora. \"So, why did you leave. It's an awfully big decision to make. You go to sleep and when you wake up on another world, in another century, every person you've ever known is dead.\" \"Well, I could ask you the same thing?\" said Jim. \"But it's my interview.\" said Aurora firmly. \"I guess that I just wanted a fresh start.\" \"That's Homestead company advertising.\" she said in objective perspective. Jim set down his screwdriver and attempted to correct this thought for a minute. \"I left Earth because I don't really have anyone left to really leave behind. Just a few friends that I don't see that often, and a few distant cousins. I'm an only child, no girlfriend, both of my parents passed away a few years ago, before I was put in hibernation of course.\" Jim explained. \"I always loved building machines or fixing broken machines. Just the thing is there's not a whole lot of demand for people like me on Earth. I could have gotten a job in a Tech-Factory but it just didn't seem enough for me. On the colony worlds they don't have all of the things that they have on Earth. On Earth when something breaks you don't fix it you just have it replaced. On the colony worlds if something breaks it may still be perfectly good you just need a competent mechanic to fix whatever is wrong with it and then it's perfectly good again. On the colony worlds my profession is in high demand. There are problems that they need for me. On the colony worlds I could build myself a house and live in it. There be a new problem for me to fix mechanical engineerwise every single day. On Earth I was lucky if I hardly ever got anything to fix. On the colony worlds...lots of space...open country...room to grow.\" \"Now you're back to slogans.\" \"Can't any of the homestead company slogans be true?\" Though this was supposed to be an interview to learn about him, she felt an extreme desire to try to convince him of her way of thinking. \"Follow me Jim.\" said Aurora. \"I want to show you my perspective on things.\" They then went to the hibernation bay where all the pods were. \"Look around Jim. Tell me, what do you see when you look at the faces of the people that are in suspended animation in this room?\" He looked around and paused to collect his thoughts. \"I see people with hopes and dreams. I see people who would not buy a ticket on this ship unless they had hopes and dreams strong enough in order for them to make the leap of faith that it takes to be here at all. While Earth is overpopulated and overpriced it's still a place to be. It's still everyone's home. I speak from personal experience that though I will miss Earth, yes, I'm also excited about building myself a house and having broken machines to fix everyday.\" She then directed Jim's attention to a circle of six pods, four of which appeared to be a family of two parents and two children. \"What about them? It seems more like parents are uprooting the kids from the only home that they knew to a new place.\" \"Sometimes the move is easier when they're younger. And besides until a child is 18 they follow their parents.\" \"There is also the fact that the Homestead Company gains a constant stream of income from 20% of every person on the colony worlds.\" \"It's still a less crowded and less expensive lifestyle than on Earth.\" said Jim. Aurora paused to collect her thoughts for a moment, then bent the subject a little. \"Do you know how much money the Homestead Company made on it's first planet? Eight quadrillion dollars! That's eight million billions! Did you pay full price for your ticket?\" \"No. It was the Homestead Company's idea for me too be here. I'm in a desirable trade for the colony worlds.\" \"So, the homestead company filled your head with dreams, discounted your ticket, and then send you off to another world where they then get 20% of everything you make for the rest of your life.\" \"So when you look around this room you see 5000 suckers?\" \"I see zeros on the Homestead Company's bottom line.\" \"I see 5000 people changing their lives.\" said Jim. \"You judge these people before you even know them just for making this trip.\" \"Hey, I'm a writer, \"said Aurora, \"I know a lot about human psychology. I know people.\" Jim then decided to challenge her on that. \"Okay.\" he said, turning and looking around. He went to a random pod and looked at the little display screen. He observed the occupant's profession and covered it with his hand. \"Doctor, banker, or gardener?\" Aurora looked at the man who was in the hibernation pod. He was a middle-aged man. Perhaps a few years older. His skin was wrinkled and he had gray hair but he was thin with what appeared to be good health for his age. While his eyes were closed in his suspended animation he seemed to have a stern confident demeanor. \"Banker.\" said Aurora. Jim then removed his hand from the display panel and revealed, 'Gardner.' Aurora was disappointed that she guessed wrong. He then walked over to another pod, observed a young woman and again held his hand over the display panel after he looked at it. \"Donna, Madison, or Lola?\" Aurora looked at the woman, the woman seemed to have a friendly face but was very strongly red-headed in her hair. \"Donna just isn't right for that hair.\" said Aurora judgmentally. \"Lola.\" He removed his hand for the display panel, 'Madison.' \"Shit!\" said Aurora in even more disappointment that she had not guessed correctly. He walked over to a third pod where he then held his hand over the display panel after he looked. \"Chef, accountant, or midwife?\" She didn't even bother attempting to guess on that one as that last one, Midwife was not something that a person would just throw in there as a multiple choice question unless it was the correct answer. \"Okay, there's no way that you made that last one up, she has to be a midwife.\" \"She's a midwife.\" confirmed Jim with a smile. \"I didn't even know that they still had midwives.\" Aurora looked at her and really took a moment to decide on this woman, not judging her for just her looks. \"I like her.\" Aurora decided. \"I think she and I would be friends.\" They stood there in silence for a little while sort of contemplating the interview and the subjects that they talked about. Neither one of them really breaking the ice after that. \"Aurora, I'm going to take you out for a drink.\" said Jim. \"When?\" she asked out of curiosity. \"Right now.\" said Jim. \"Now?\" she said in surprise. \"But it's not even lunchtime yet.\" \"I found that in my last year here that it doesn't really matter what time of day you do anything when you have unlimited freedom. At least as much Freedom as the ship gives you when you're all alone on it.\" \"Grand Concourse.\" said the computer as they exited the elevator. He walked her across the super large luxury shopping mall that was right on the ship until they got to the pub. Arthur had been on low power mode until they came within 20 yards of the pub. \"Aurora, you are about to meet the artificial intelligence android bartender, Arthur.\" said Jim. \"He's a feeble imitation of a real human being, but around here he's the next closest thing. Hello, Arthur.\" \"Hello Jim.\" said Arthur with a smile. \"And who is this lovely lady?\" \"Aurora.\" said Aurora stating her name. \"Aurora.\" responded Arthur with a smile, taking her hand in respect. \"A pleasure.\" \"I have a whiskey, neat.\" said Jim. \"Martini, please.\" said Aurora. Arthur pored the drinks. Jim raised his glass. \"To living large on a large ship.\" Jim toasted. \"I'll drink to that.\" said Aurora. Please review![Chapter 11] Chapter 11 Author's note: Sorry for the delay in the update. Writing has been hard for me lately. Day 398 Aurora and Jim were in the pub. They exchanged a few more words with Arthur and then went off. \"Shall we get some lunch now?\" asked Jim. \"Where shall we go?\" asked Aurora. \"What kind of food are you in the mood for?\" asked Jim. \"I like all different kinds.\" said Aurora. \"Chinese, Mexican, Thai food, but for right now I'm in the mood for just traditional American food.\" \"Follow me.\" said Jim. Jim then led Aurora to a fancy-looking restaurant that apparently had just regular American food on the menu. A robot on wheels with standard flexible mechanical arms then approach them. \"Good day passengers.\" said the robot in a dull mechanical voice. \"May I take your order, or would you like drinks to start?\" \"I'll have a ginger ale.\" said Jim. \"I'll have a club soda.\" said Aurora. The robot waiter than wheeled away and then Jim and Aurora looked at the menu. Their food has arrived. And they started eating. Aurora had again opened up her holographic notepad and activated the voice typing function. \"So, Jim.\" said Aurora. \"What other plans did you have for Homestead 2 when you arrived there?\" Jim paused to think for a moment. \"I like to think that I am a nature guy. I love to go for walks in the woods. I've always been a fan of the bike trails.\" \"A planet that's still being explored.\" said Aurora. \"Granted after it was seeded with plant life after the planet was terraformed.\" \"But none the less,\" said Jim, \"the human race created a world. But yet there are still millions of square miles of uncharted land on the continents of Homestead 2; lots of places to explore.\" \"I'm a big fan of nature too.\" said Aurora. \"But at the same time I don't intend to really stay away from Earth forever. As I have actually purchased a round trip ticket.\" \"A round trip ticket?\" said Jim in disbelief. \"Yep.\" said Aurora. \"That's my plan. I was going to fly to Homestead 2, live there for one year, and then come straight back to Earth.\" \"I don't get it.\" said Jim with confusion. \"I left Earth for a new life, but you will end up right back where you started?\" \"No, I end up in the future.\" clarified Aurora. \"250 years in the future. I will have a story that no one else can write.\" \"What story?\" asked Jim. \"The ultimate story of the ultimate adventure. Mankind's flight to the Stars; it will be the ultimate story that no one else can write.\" \"But in that new era you won't know any of the people who will be reading it.\" said Jim. \"But they will be reading it.\" insisted Aurora adamantly. She then paused with a face of disappointment. \"Or at least they would have been. There's no point in me writing the book now. I won't be alive to witness the appropriate events in order to write the book. I don't know if I will ever write again.\" She sighed, \"Jim, I don't know what to do anymore? ...We can't get back into hibernation, and we cant break into the secure areas...I'm all out of ideas.\" And then looked around the large room in wonder and curiosity. \"What is there to do around here?\" asked Aurora. \"Well,\" said Jim. \"We are on a luxury liner. The whole ship is about Recreation. Tell me Aurora, do you like to dance?\" \"Occasionally I like to dance.\" said Aurora. \"Follow me.\" Jim then took her to the Hologram dance room in the video arcade. \"It's a dance off with the computer.\" said Jim. But suddenly Aurora didn't quite seem so enthusiastic about it. She enjoyed casual dancing at a party, but she was not a very competitive dancer. \"Come on Aurora.\" said Jim. \"It will be fun. Partner mode.\" he commanded to the computer. The holographic dancer then split into two and Jim then took his place in front of the male dancer. \"Stand right here.\" said Jim while he pointed to the spot beside him. Aurora very tentatively walked up to the spot. \"Now, they are going to dance first, and we have to mimic the exact dance that they did.\" The male dancer started to dance. Having a great deal of experience Jim mimicked the exact dance. The female dancer then did another fancy dance wear she then paused and waited for Aurora to do it. But Aurora did not respond. Is there anything else that we could do?\" said Aurora apparently not wanting to do this, but when she took too long to respond, the Hologram's artificial intelligence interpreted her lack of response as a bad duplicate of the dance that it did and then they gave her a thumbs-down telling her that she sucked. \"Hey!\" said Aurora reprimanding the hologram. \"I'll show you!\" Apparently the harsh criticism from the Holograms motivated her to prove them wrong. She waited for the Hologram to dance again where she then attempted real hard to repeat the dance. The computer then gave her a score. It wasn't the highest score, but it was better than zero. For a while they kept dancing with the Holograms, and they bumped into each other, they spun around on one foot and fell to the ground. Always resulting in laughing. Sometimes they beat the dancing Holograms, sometimes they fell short of a high score entirely. After that they came out of the 'Dance Off' video arcade and they were laughing and sweating as well as exhausted. \"You know what Jim, that wasn't half bad.\" said Aurora with a smile. \"I'm glad that you enjoyed it Aurora.\" Said Jim. He had enjoyed it more than he ever had as he now actually had a partner to dance with. He took her to the Mexican restaurants where they indulge themselves in the some burritos. Aurora went to bed with a smile after she bid him goodnight and left for her cabin. Day 400 Aurora and Jim go to the movies. Day 402 Aurora and Jim play one-on-one basketball. Jim had had plenty of practice when playing by himself, but it seemed that Aurora had some skill with the game herself. They're about evenly matched the score usually remaining a tie or close to it. Day 441 Aurora sat in her cabin in her bathrobe with fresh clean wet hair as she sipped a cup of coffee. She activated her holographic notepad and voice typing function. \"Journal Entry, Aurora Lane.\" she spoke aloud and the notepad started typing. \"It has been two months since I have woken up. And though it is seeming more and more likely that there is no way back into hibernation and I'm going to die of old age before we reach Homestead 2, ...I am having fun. I am enjoying myself. The ship's recreational facilities are top notch. \"Jim Preston is good company. And I am developing a romantic attraction to him. He's good looking. But I won't initiate anything because I want it to come from him. \"But I still keep hoping for a long-term solution for my situation. I still hold out hope I'll get to Homestead 2 at least before I'm 40. \"End entry.\" It was then that the lights in the room began to flicker and then went out. It was about 20 seconds later when the lights came back on. \"There is an electrical malfunction in your area.\" said the computer. \"Attempting to reboot. Please standby. We apologize for the inconvenience.\" \"What in the world?!\" said Aurora out loud. On the bridge at the diagnostic console a red holographic square appeared saying, 'Utopia Suite'. The word, 'repairing', flashed for a few moments before the diagnostic turned green and then disappeared. While there were several dozen other red Diagnostics over the console that continued to flash 'repairing', but never turned green. Day 442 Jim and Aurora walked into the pub. \"Hello Arthur.\" said Jim. \"Whiskey please, neat.\" \"Martini for me.\" said Aurora. \"Coming right up.\" said Arthur. Arthur made the drinks. He served them with napkins and then as always started to polish a glass. \"It really has been fun.\" said Aurora. \"I've been enjoying the ship's recreational facilities.\" \"And we from the Homestead Company always endeavor to please the customers.\" said Arthur with a smile. \"Are you just programed to say that?\" asked Aurora. \"I will not deny it.\" said Arthur. \"I am programmed to serve the passengers.\" \"So, tell me about Jim's first year?\" said Aurora as she looked at Jim. \"Well,\" said Jim before Arthur could start, \"I woke up from my hibernation pod. The holographic woman in front of me told me that we were nearing Homestead 2 and it was time for me to wake up. They checked my vitals that I was fine and directed me to my cabin. Asked me to check my luggage and gave me some pink electrolyte solution, and then I kinda went to sleep like right away. And I did not at any point realize that I was alone. I guess of course I knew that I was alone but it never really clicked in my head at the time that that would be wrong. \"So the next morning when I was awoken by the ship's alarm clock and then I got ready and went to the classroom for orientation, then I realized that I was alone. \"I ran up and down the hallways, checked the hibernation Bay and everything. When I realized that no one else was awake I realized that something was wrong. I checked the command ring, I checked the Grand Concourse, they directed me to the ship's Steward, everything, and then when I finally went to the ship's Observatory where it then told me that we would arrive at Homestead 2 in about 90 years, that's when I kind of flipped out. I went to the communication room where I sent a message to Earth but they told me that it's not going to arrive for another 19 years and earliest possible reply being 55 years from now, and then they charged my credit card $6,000. \"That was when I met Arthur.\" said Jim as he then looked at Arthur. \"Arthur acted very casual as though there was absolutely nothing weird or unusual about a passenger being awake. At first I didn't immediately realize that he was an Android so I kind of treated him like a human, verbally, but he offered me a whiskey, I decided maybe I could use one and then I realize that he had no legs. \"I tried for months to put myself back in hibernation and break into the command ring but, there was nothing. I was stuck. It was absolutely no way out of this. By lack of imagination from the engineers and scientists that designed this ship and all its systems, they focused so hard on preventing a passenger from every waking up early in the first place that they created no protocol on what to do if one actually did wake up. \"And as I said, I tried for months and I couldn't figure anything out. That's when Arthur suggested that I enjoying myself. \"And then two months ago I randomly saw you walking around The Concourse which was totally a surprise. I immediately realized that your hibernation pod had to have malfunctioned as well.\" \"One hibernation malfunction would have been surprising enough, but two within a year and three weeks.\" said Aurora with curiosity. \"That seems highly unusual.\" Jim's face turn to a plain straight face of caution and attempted to remain composed. \"I'm surprised you didn't go crazy.\" said Aurora. \"Oh, make no mistake. I went crazy.\" said Jim. \"I walked around the ship naked. I drank excessively. You know, I almost jettisoned myself into space out of an airlock one time. I just couldn't take it anymore but...I got over it. \"I think there was a time. Where I didn't wear pants for about a month.\" \"7 weeks and 4 days.\" clarified Arthur. \"The man has no shame. \"Well you're a little lacking yourself in that area Arthur.\" said Aurora. Both Aurora and Jim laughed at that one where Arthur then put on the confused face or than look down at the mechanical gears that made up his lower torso and below. \"I laugh at the man with no pants, until I realize that I have no legs.\" said Arthur who then started laughing himself. Jim and Aurora then laughed even harder. With a smile on her face from the laughter she then let out a breath. \"For a moment there I forgot that my life was in ruins.\" said Aurora. \"I'm sorry.\" said Jim. \"What for?\" asked Aurora rhetorically. \"I think all this alcohol has made me a little tired. I'm going to go to bed. I'll see you both tomorrow.\" Aurora then walked away. Once Aurora was out of earshot Arthur then leaned in and whispered to Jim. \"She is wonderful. Excellent choice.\" Jim still feeling sorry that he had woken her up kept on a serious face of sorrow and regret. \"There has got to be something that I can do to make her life better. Sure, she and I have fun together, but that's not enough. She's a writer. She needs to write. She is trying to write for posterity. Maybe I can help out with that.\" Before Jim went to bed he went to his makeshift workshop that he had set up for himself in the cargo hold. He would collect spare parts and bits of scrap metal to put together different kinds of gadgets and things as well as fix the broken robots. He collected pieces of thin straight silver pieces of metal. He then used a welding torch and soldering iron to fit them together while shaping into them rectangular windows. He created a very tall rectangular prism form while molding it and shaping it to be just right fitting the thin Square pieces of metal together. After a little while of hard work and mechanical art, he had created a mirror approximate scrap art model of the Chrysler Building in New York City. In the past 2 months Jim had memorized Aurora's habits. She like to go to the viewing area to look out at the stars every morning. Day 443 Jim went to the viewing area that he knew that Aurora would go to in the morning. He placed his model Chrysler Building there along with a hot cup of coffee and a holographic notepad and then he typed a message on to it. A short while later Aurora walked in to look out at the stars where she then notice the little set up. She saw the metal model Chrysler Building along with the cup of coffee and then the message. The message read, \"Enjoy the view and write for me.\" Aurora had always said for her that if she had a view of the Chrysler Building and a cup of coffee she could write all day. How did Jim know that? Thought Aurora. Obviously he must have been reading her work. She was flattered of course but she didn't know if he had read her work or not. Jim had put the finishing touches on the malfunctioned robot in front of him. It was a small vacuum cleaner robot that was supposed to just pick up little bits that it could find on the floor. He had disconnected its connection to the ship's computer which had already malfunctioned on it's own, and established its connection just to his makeshift remote control that he had created. Along with a live camera feed. He fit the robot with a robotic arm in a hidden compartment along with a note and a pen. He was going to do what he wanted all along. Jim felt that it was time and that there was little point to waiting any longer. At this point, she either likes him or she doesn't, she will either answer yes to his question now or she never will ever. Watching the live camera feed on the screen in front of him he controlled the robot to go to the observation area. When the robot got there, Aurora at the little robot with the camera that had been mounted on top of it. \"Hello.\" said Aurora with a smile. Jim then touched the button that triggered the robots robotic arm to hold out the Note. Aurora took the note and read it. The note read, \"Dinner Tonight?\" \"Is he asking me on a date?\" Aurora asked the robot. Jim then had the robot shake its camera up and down in the form of an odd. \"Need a pen?\" asked Jim as he then touched another button to have the robot present a pen. She wrote a reply on the piece of paper, and then handed it back to the robot. The robotic arm then pulled the piece of paper back into the small compartment on its front. She started to sip her coffee again and turned her attention back to the window looking out at the stars. Jim remotely steered the robot all the way back to where he was, and then he took the piece of paper and read it. The reply was, \"Love to.\" \"She wrote, love to.\" said Jim in excitement towards the robot. A guy was always excited when a girl says yes. Jim then went to the clothing store on the Grand Concourse. There was of course no person behind the cash register, so he just started looking through the racks and shelves of different kinds of clothes. He found himself a fancy-looking suit. He tried it on and then looked in the mirror. \"I am looking snazzy.\" said Jim. \"Yes, Aurora is going to love this.\" Please review![Chapter 12] Chapter 12 Day 443 Around 5 p.m. Jim went to Aurora's quarters and waved his ID band over the door sensor. \"You have a visitor.\" said the computer's voice from inside the door. The door then opened and Jim stepped in. Down the short hallway that led into the Utopia Suite came Aurora. Her hair was done up nice. Her makeup is applied perfectly. She was wearing earrings and a backless black dress with the front going right up to her neck. Jim stood there and looked at her with amused awe. \"Wow!\" he said. \"You clean up pretty good yourself.\" said Aurora looking at fresh crisp suit and well groomed appearance. \"You went shopping.\" \"I went shoplifting, actually.\" Jim clarified. \"Shall we go to dinner?\" said Jim as he directed her down the hall. \"Grand Concourse.\" said the voice coming out of the wall as they exit the elevator. Before they went to dinner they decided to have a friendly drink and visit to the local bar man. \"Jim. Aurora.\" said Arthur as they entered. \"What can I get for you?\" \"Whiskey, rocks.\" said Jim. \"Martini for me.\" said Aurora. \"No problem.\" aid Arthur. Arthur then got the ingredients and began mixing the martini. \"You too look lovely this evening.\" said Arthur in observation. \"Well thank you Arthur.\" said Aurora. \"We're on a date.\" Arthur smiled and raised his eyebrows, \"Very nice.\" \"Took you long enough to ask.\" said Aurora in half mocking condemnation with a smile. \"I liked you the first day that I saw you.\" clarified Jim. \"Make no mistake about that. I I was just trying to be a gentleman by not throwing myself at you immediately. And since you had just woken up and your life has been ruined I wanted to give you a little space.\" \"Space?\" said Aurora in mockery at the idea. \"Like I need any more of that. But thank you for asking me out.\" she said while taking his hand. \"You're welcome.\" said Jim. \"So, where shall we go?\" asked Aurora after she finished her drink. \"I was thinking maybe the French restaurant.\" \"Sounds good.\" It was some time later. They had finished eating, and drinking red wine. The robot waiter took their empty dishes away. \"Well, that was delicious.\" said Aurora. \"It wasn't easy getting a reservation.\" joked Jim pretending that the restaurant was full of customers. \"They're probably going to want us to give up our table.\" said Aurora playing along with the joke. \"We're getting a lot of dirty looks.\" \"Very popular tonight.\" said Jim referring to the restaurant. There was a quiet pause for a few moments. \"So how is your book coming along?\" asked Jim trying to sound interested in her. \"I don't really know what it is yet.\" said Aurora as she stared into space to ponder the idea of it. \"My dad used to always write about his life. But he had stories. He sailed around Antarctica. He was a war reporter. He had lovers.\" she gave a seductive smile on that last one. \"And he wrote about his daughter.\" she said as she broke eye contact from Jim and looked away with slight embarrassment. But Jim seemed to show interest in that. \"He wrote about you?\" asked Jim. \"Yeah.\" said Aurora. \"I grew up reading about myself in his books.\" \"How was that?\" asked Jim. \"Not always easy.\" said Aurora. \"A little bit more than you want to know about yourself. And then when I was 17 he had a heart attack. He was writing at his keypad. End of story.\" she said the last part with a face and voice of sorrowful memory. Jim put on a sympathetic straight face. \"That was so serious.\" said Aurora through a smile and partly gritted teeth. \"I'm sorry. We need more wine.\" \"I like hearing about your life.\" said Jim, genuinely interested. \"Thanks.\" said Aurora with a smile. Their glasses were filled with a little more red wine. They continue to sit and look at each other. Occasionally exchanging words. Jim talked about his fascination in just the working of machinery. How the different components fit together to make a tool that could do a complicated task, that back in the caveman days would have taken many hands or have been simply been impossible to do at all. He explained that mechanical engineering was an art. A true science in every sense. Aurora told him more about writing. Writing was very hard work. Sometimes you could get writer's block for days and weeks at a time. Sometimes you knew exactly what you wanted to write about but you just weren't sure how to write at exactly. Sometimes you would write countless rough drafts and then discard them knowing that they would never be good for reading. Memories are forever. They made their way into a photo booth on the Grand Concourse where several wallet-sized portraits were taken and then instantly developed. When they looked at the pictures they look like a cute couple. A happy couple. They went to the video arcade and played some video games together. They went to the movie theater and watch a movie together while they snuggled up close to each other. They went to a ballroom to enjoy some soft music and a slow waltz. They were tired and almost ready for sleep, but Jim wanted to do one more thing before ending the evening. Jim led her to the airlock antechamber where the spacesuits are housed. \"What are we doing here?\" asked Aurora. \"Let me show you.\" said Jim. The space suit then opened up like a big mechanical clamshell and allowed him to step in where at then closed up over him as was its function for easily suiting up. \"Have you done this before?\" asked Aurora as she immediately realize that they were going to go on a spacewalk together. \"Several times.\" said Jim over exaggerating on the one time that he actually did it. \"Is it safe?\" asked Aurora. \"No.\" said Jim. But then he chuckled and then reassured her, \"Relatively safe. Hop in.\" Just the problem was the suit was not meant to accommodate the shape and unusual configuration of a skirt and dress. It would get all tangled up inside the suit if not possibly be ripped apart while fitting in. A normal shirt and trousers don't do that in the seat. \"What about my dress?\" asked Aurora. \"Right?\" Said Jim suddenly realizing her dilemma and that he had not thought of it beforehand. Aurora then realized that she was just going to have to go into the suit in just her thong-panties. She laughed at the irony and awkwardness of the situation. \"Turn around.\" She said to him though it was worded in just a polite exaggeration. She then reach behind her neck to undo the tie that held the top of her dress to her neck. When Jim realize that she was taking off her dress he turned his back to be the modest gentleman. A few moments later he saw the Black Dress slide between his legs from behind him. A few moments later he knew that she was inside the suit. He took her into the airlock where the inner door closed. He slid open the safety switch and press the red button. \"Have a wonderful time.\" said the computer. The outer door opened and the atmosphere inside the airlock was evacuated into space. They stepped out into the darkness of the void between solar systems. Strong secure robotic cables sneaked out of the wall and connected to their suits. \"Tether attached.\" said the voice of the computer in side their space helmets. It was completely dark. There was just the light of the stars in horizon, and the lights of the ship of course. They walked up the little path that was along the side of the ship. But after a short distance they stopped to just look at the Stellar Lights of the universe that were a thousand times clearer in the void between solar systems than they would ever have been on the clearest nights on Earth. \"This is so beautiful!\" said Aurora in awe. \"I know.\" said Jim. But then he looked at her through her space helmet. The light inside her helmet was reflecting off of her face which put it into an interesting contrast. It was not less beautiful, but she was just a different beautiful but equally good. He then touched the button on the console on her arm which deactivated her magnetic boots and then he touched the button on his to deactivate his magnetic boots. They were still held to the surface by the centripetal force of the spinning of the ship. \"What are you doing?\" asked Aurora. \"Do you trust me?\" asked Jim. She smiled and nodded. He leapt off of the side of the ship as he pulled her with him. He trusted the tatters to be flawless, and they were. When they reached the end of their tether and the spinning of their ship made them float away the yank at the end was significantly less strength than was strictly needed in order to get the tethers to snap. The ship now slightly in the distance and nothing around them except the void of space while an endless number of millions, no, billions of stars had there diffused light from the distance slightly illuminate them. Aurora had never imagined such a thing. The difference is that she could share this with Jim while the first time Jim did this he had no one. \"Thank you.\" said Aurora with a tone of both sadness and gratitude in her voice. After a little while Jim touched the button that would ravel them in on their tethers. They re-entered the airlock and when the outer door closed and the airlock re-pressurized they went back into the antechamber where they removed their spacesuits. Only this time Aurora did not ask Jim to turn around. She stepped out of her space suit and gave gym a full frontal view of her body in nothing but a thong. Clearly under no compunction now too follow some code of being a gentleman he made no attempt to look away. She walked right up to him and then she kissed him right on the lips. Their bodies tingled at the touch their mouths against each others mouths. They did this for a while, oblivious to the fact that it was an airlock antechamber. But then again some of the weirdest couples in history had made out in the most unusual places so this didn't really matter. Rather than have her put her dress back on he took off his suit jacket and put it over her shoulders while he then held it closed and they both walked together. They both knew where they were going. They went to Jim's stolen Vienna sweet. They entered they walked across the dining room and then up the stairs to the sleeping area. At the top of the stairs Aurora pulled the suit jacket off of her shoulders and let it fall to the ground where she then assisted Jim in disrobing from his clothing. In seconds he was down to his boxers. Their lips met and they didn't hold back from inserting their tongues into each other's mouths. They then remove their underwear so that they were completely naked. They continue to run their hands up and down each other's bodies in the human pleasure of human contact. They fell onto the bed together not breaking lip contact and continued to feel each other's bodies with their hands and arms. Aurora wrapped her legs around Jim's hips where they then proceeded to try and make a baby. But Aurora was on an oral contraceptive for feminine hormonal balance, so no babies are going to be started. After the natural human instinct and act of giving each other orgasms, they just lay there in the bed facing each other, basking in the aftermath of human pleasure. Though they would still continue searching for a way to get back into hibernation, a part of them hoped that they would never need anyone but each other and the solitude of the ship ever again. Please review![Chapter 13] Chapter 13 In a secure stable orbit around Earth's moon, was a 1 trillion ton asteroid that had been captured and towed by short-range but highly sophisticated spacecrafts from Earth. The asteroid was attached to a highly sophisticated manufacturing facility called an 'Orbital Shipyard'. The shipyard was approximately 100 miles long and nearly two miles wide; a huge colossal feat of engineering. The shipyard used to be a lot smaller in the beginning, but had grown gradually over hundreds of years. Manufacturing parts and components was easy, as long as you had the raw materials to make them out of. When the governments of the world decided that they wanted to build large Interstellar Starships weighing tens of thousands of tons, they needed a source of raw materials at the manufacturing facility. The Orbital Shipyard took decades to build, but was well worth the effort. It had more than paid for itself hundreds of times over once its manufacturing capabilities were operating at 100% and it was at output of full production. The large captured asteroid was essential for the manufacturing of spacecrafts within the shipyard. For it was extremely difficult to transport raw materials from Earth's surface into outer space, mostly because of the weight. Traditionally a spacecraft flying from the ground into outer space needs to be as light as possible. If a spacecraft needs to leave the Earth's surface and fly straight into outer space carrying an extremely heavy payload of just solid metal to be processed, then it is kind of counterproductive to the vessel being as light as possible. In order to get an extremely heavy payload into outer space requires an extremely powerful booster rocket as well as an extremely large quantity of quickly expended fuel. Of course they did that in the beginning, but once they had a source of raw materials in the weightlessness of outer space, then they could freely manufacture as many ships in outer space as they wanted without the need of getting them to leave the Earth's gravity. Of course there were some materials, supplies, parts, and components that for whatever reason could not be manufactured in space and needed to be transported from Earth's surface to the ships, but those materials were a minority compared to 99% of the metal that the ships would be made out of. Hundreds of ships traveled to the asteroid belt in the solar system and using powerful drilling clamps that could latch onto the base of the solid rock of the 1 trillion ton asteroid. They could get the thing to move with extremely powerful booster rockets, albeit, slowly. But they eventually brought it close to Earth and then using even more fuel with booster rockets trying to propel it in the opposite direction for breaking, as well as the use of ion drives, they managed to bring it into a stable geosynchronous orbit where they then began construction of the shipyard right on the asteroid. On the shipyard they can simply extract solid rock directly from the asteroid and use an advanced metal purification process that would separate all of the individual elements within the rock into separate piles. The raw metals separated from the rock could then be processed into full working parts and components on the assembly line for the spaceships that were being built within the shipyard. The asteroid belt within the Sol System was left over from the formation of the solar system billions of years earlier and consisted of mostly iron, and within parts of some of the asteroids were rich deposits of ore of other metals, just like the Earth's crust. Building all of the smaller and more custom-made spacecrafts, and then capturing the asteroid, and then building the shipyard, was the hardest part that took decades and the shipyard was a lot smaller at the start. But once the shipyard was built, production of the manufacturing of spaceships of all sizes was up by more than 900%. Particularly with ships that could weigh tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of tons. Once there was no concern on landing a ship on the planet's surface or getting it off the surface back into space there was then no weight limit on the size of the spacecraft which instituted the production of larger 1 million ton cruise ships in outer space. The Starship Avalon was one of many of these ships that was manufactured in the orbital Shipyard that had a nearly endless supply of raw materials from the captured asteroid in order for it to be built. If it was not for such shipyards then the large Interstellar luxury Starships for transporting large numbers of people to the Colony worlds would not be possible. May 7, 2411 Within one of the large colossal sized One-Mile-Square chambers within the shipyard was the newly constructed half-built skeleton of a magnificent ship, or at least the plan was that it would be a magnificent ship when it was completed. Over 1000 robotic arms and cranes from the ceiling, and floor, and walls brought newly manufactured components that just had been created from the processed raw materials from the forgers of molten metal that had been mined, processed, and purified out of the attached asteroid, and then attached the components into the right places of the half-built skeleton to complete the skeleton. Once the skeleton of the ship was fully completed then the walls of the Interior rooms were assembled. And so on and so forth. This would go on for another five years until the ship would be complete and then it would be inspected and re-inspected by a team of health and safety inspectors that would be insanely strict and never satisfied, nitpicking over every tiny little thing as they looked over every nook and cranny of the ship with their clipboards. Until finally when the ship was deemed 100% safe and all of its systems 100% perfect it would be christened 'The Starship Avalon', and then begin its maiden voyage of delivering 5000 people on a 9 and 1/2 year one way trip to the neighboring solar system of Proxima Centauri, where the habitable world of 'Neo Eden 3', had been terraformed and colonized decades earlier. Day 459 For the past two weeks Jim and Aurora were overly sexually flamboyant with each other. They could barely keep their hands off of each other. With no societal or community obligation to go to work or school or any other such function for the maintenance of their livelihood, they barely got out of bed. When they did they sometimes didn't even get dressed. They walked naked with each other through either the passengers dining hall or the Grand Concourse. They made love wherever they wanted to at any time. For the first little while they were insatiable with each other but eventually the novelty wore off and they then settled back into a normal routine only this time they were lovers, in love. They did everything that they did before only rather than just two friends keeping each other company, they went to the movies and danced and played video games as boyfriend and girlfriend. Aurora had new inspiration for writing. Jim indulged in some projects out of any components and raw materials that he used to find or make. They went jogging with each other around the ship. Exercise was always more fun when you had someone to do it with. And Jim had Aurora practice punching the punching bag. Teaching her how to position her feet and make her body weight make her body steady and rigid like a rock while throwing every pound ounce of her body weight into every punch. And they still enjoyed time apart. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. Jim worked on some broken robots and other machines while Aurora went swimming in the ship's pool. But in spite of their needed solitary time, they always came home to each other again at the end of the day more in love than when they had parted at the beginning of the day. Aurora had moved into Jim's stolen Vienna suite. Jim doubled and redoubled his efforts to get the two of them back into hibernation. He scoured the cargo hold hoping to find something that might help them. He told Aurora this every morning when he left at the end of the day to go to the cargo hold and look through the spare parts. He didn't know what he was looking for or even if it existed, but he merely hoped that he might find something and maybe know that it was what he was looking for when he finds it. \"Log entry, Aurora Lane,\" said Aurora as she sat at the the bar in the pub, drinking a glass of water. She had a smile on her face from just being happy all the time. \"What can I say today?...there are no words...but yet there's so much to say...I think that this is why writers have writer's block when they're happy. While some have difficulty writing when they're sad. It's a paradox. Let's start with just saying it the way it is. End entry.\" She ended her short log entry and then switched to another file, her book. Only the first little bit was written and she was hoping to one day finish it. She scrolled through the book and stopped at the end with the most recent unwritten line and then hit the voice typing function. \"So,\" said Aurora out loud to the notepad. \"I'm seeing someone. You will never guess who. We are the last two people in the world who would ever get together. But here we are. The last two people in the world.\" \"What was that?\" said Arthur as he had been paying attention to polishing a glass a moment earlier and had only just heard her talking thinking that she was talking to him. \"I'm writing Arthur. Hush.\" said Aurora. Her voice typing function on her notepad actually recorded that last line and she had to erase it. \"Jim and I live in accidental happiness. Like castaways making their home on strange Shores.\" She wrote about her time on the ship with Jim. She wrote it like poetry while at the same time making it practical information for posterity. \"It's funny. We all have dreams. \"We plan our futures like we're the captains of our fates. But unfortunately we are not granted the right and privilege in the universe of truly deciding what happens to us. \"With hard effort and choices we might be able to partially direct their own steps. But we are passengers. \"We go where the fate takes us, whether it's malfunctioning hibernation pods, or the conscious choice to go on the ship to begin with. \"This isn't the life we planned. But it's ours. And for the first time in my life, I don't feel alone. \"We weren't supposed to find each other. But we did. Even though I can't get back into hibernation in order to be able to get Homestead 2, it makes me feel like my life isn't over. It's just beginning.\" It was then that Jim came into the Pub. \"Hey Arthur.\" Jim greeted the robot bartender. \"Good day to you Jim.\" said Arthur with a smile. \"What can I get for you.\" \"I'll have a beer, please.\" \"Coming right up.\" said Arthur, as he then reached for a pub glass under the bar and then held it under the beer tap as he pulled back the lever. Jim then wrapped his arms around Aurora and kissed her. And Aurora made no attempt to resist. Please review![Chapter 14] Chapter 14 Day 671 \"Passengers.\" said the computer. \"If you would like to proceed to a viewing area. The Avalon is about to slingshot around the star Arcturus.\" Both Aurora and Jim sprinted to an observation area that looked out the side of the ship. And they saw. The Avalon was less than several million miles from the corona of a red giant. A red giant is a star that was once a yellow dwarf but has been around for so long it has consumed all of its hydrogen, so it starts to burn the heavier elements. This causes the star to get bigger while having a significantly cooler surface area, growing from a yellow dwarf into a red giant. The color of a star is dependent on it temperature. If a star is yellow, it means that it has a surface temperature of about 6,000 degrees Kelvin, or 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Because this star appeared red, that indicated that its surface temperature was only about 3,700 degrees Kelvin, or 6,000 Fahrenheit. Despite its exponential size. The ship's Shield, as well as the ship's hull protected the interior from any heat and radiation. The massive ball space fire was swirling with solar flares and other surface eruptions of solar matter. It was beautiful but frightening at the same time, imagining the power that is within core of the stellar phenomenon that was so common within the universe as a star. \"Wow!\" said Aurora with awe as she held onto Jim. \"A Red Giant!\" \"And the universe's gift to you.\" said Jim as he looked into her eyes. \"Happy birthday.\" Aurora tried to think about that. She thought that it was a little soon for her birthday. But then she realized the date. It was the date of her birthday, but Jim had not taken into account the exact number of years months and days that she had spent in hibernation. But it didn't matter. It was the date of her birthday so she decided to go with it. They went to one of the restaurants after dressing up. Jim and the waiter robots singing her happy birthday as well as presenting her with a white cake with white icing. She and Jim ate the cake together. It was delicious. After that magnificent desert they decided to go to the pub. It was Jim's idea for he had a special plan for her still. Jim and Aurora had been alone together for 10 months. And dating for a little over 8. Their time together had been perfect. They didn't have a care in the world. They still cared about getting back into hibernation which Jim had still continued to look for. They made love every night. And sometimes several times a day. Being alone on big ship full of luxuries they can do whatever they wanted, they didn't have to work, they didn't have to go to work when they woke up in the morning, they didn't have to worry about holding a job, they didn't have to pay rent. All the essentials of living plus a thousand times more were provided for them by the ship. And they had each other to satisfy the human physical need for physical contact, as well as companionship to share each other's loneliness. Aurora continued to write. She found inspiration in their happiness. Unfortunately, as they sometimes say, all good things must come to an end. While one thing leads to another, and they warn you that sometimes 'secrets always catch up with you'. That a relationship should be based around honesty. The secret might have been kept permanently if it wasn't for a little chain of events that happened right there in the pub. Jim had asked Arthur not to tell Aurora that he woke her up and that she thinks it was an accident and for him to tell her. Arthur agree to these terms and he had not told Aurora that Jim woke her up. He was under the impression that Aurora still didn't know that Jim had woken her up. But what overrides a logic circuit? The artificial intelligence that Arthur had was not perfect. It could have all kinds of misunderstandings when it comes to human emotion or even simple concepts of understanding. \"A birthday drink for the birthday girl.\" said Arthur as he gave them both a sparkling beverage in a flute glass with an olive in it. \"Aren't you going to ask for my ID Arthur?\" said Aurora jokingly. \"I might not be old enough to drink.\" Ironic though as Arthur knew how old she was and she was of legal drinking age and had already had countless drinks served to her by him. But his programmed personality forced him to comment on that remark under the guise of bonding and creating trust with his customers, \"Oh, I would never ask a lady's age in front of a gentleman.\" \"Oh Arthur,\" said Aurora, \"Jim is no gentleman. And besides there are no secrets between us.\" Arthur however, under the impression that Jim was keeping the fact that he had woken her up to himself, thought perhaps things have changed in the past 10 months and that he was now under the wrong impression or no longer in the loop between them. \"Is that so?\" asked Arthur to Jim. Jim, was not quite ready to reveal the truth to Aurora if he will ever be ready, merely smiled and winked and said, \"You heard the lady. I'll be right back.\" Jim then walked off to the public restroom. A human man would have interpreted the smile and wink mixed in indeterminate non-answer, as that he should just continue with their already agreed-upon Secret. But with the many personality flaws of artificial intelligence, Arthur's logic circuit determined that Aurora was now aware of the fact that Jim had woken her up and that she was not upset about it and that Arthur was free to talk about the matter in front of her. \"You know Aurora,\" said Arthur under the guise of conversational bonding as was his programming, \"I remember this day one year ago. Jim was so looking forward to seeing you.\" Aurora then put on a look of confusion at Arthur's statement. \"What?\" said Aurora. \"How could Jim have been looking forward to meeting me?\" Arthur then immediately realized that she was not in on the loop, in which he should not have said anything. But the cat was out of the bag now, and he went forward with answering her question. \"Oh, Jim spent months deciding whether or not to wake you up.\" It took Aurora 10 long slow seconds of contemplation and pondering for Arthur's words to sink in. But when they did she was devastated in less than a second. \"Jim woke me up?\" asked Aurora, hoping that Arthur would take it all back and give her a different answer. \"Oh yes.\" said Arthur. \"It was not easy for him, not easy at all. He said that it was the most hardest decision of his life. But, I can see that it worked out just fine.\" Aurora then realizing this had difficulty breathing. It was too big a shock on her emotionally. It was then that she looked in Jim's direction as he had come back from the restroom. She put on a face of disgusted horror. \"Jim,\" asked Aurora wanting a 100% confirmation from him and hoping that he would be honest and drop all pretenses, \"did you wake me up?\" Jim realizing that Arthur had told her against they are agreed upon confidentiality, he was not mad at Arthur. Both in that moment and always, he blamed himself more than he blamed Arthur right then and there. By some fluke in Arthur's programming confidentiality, the secret had gotten out now when, For Better or For Worse, Jim should have let Aurora in on the secret himself a long time ago.\" Feeling devastated with extreme nausea in his gut from being exposed to Aurora, \"Yes, I woke you up.\" \"How!\" demanded Aurora through a windpipe that was barely able to breathe because of the shock. \"How could you do such a thing!\" Jim immediately knew the reason why he did it. He was desperate. He couldn't help himself. What was he to do? And it wasn't that he had done it on a whim. He had resisted doing it a thousand times for months. \"I tried not to.\" It felt like a lame explanation. And it was. But what else could he say. He felt like giving her the full explanation if she be willing to listen we just be excuses. She walked out of the pub. \"You keep away from me!\" she demanded. She went to their room, the stolen Vienna suite. She picked up one of the decorative ornaments and threw it at the window. Of course the window was made of an extremely durable transparent polymer that would not break so easily. She screamed at the top of her lungs out of anger more than fear, and then she broke down and just cried. Cried like a baby who wasn't allowed to have a cookie. She then realized that it was no accident that she had woken up. It was deliberate. It could have been avoided if Jim simply hadn't done it. By her point of view his choice of waking her up was selfish and now she was the one paying for it. She didn't want to see him again. But what was she supposed to do. She was trapped in a gilded cage with her murderer. Aurora had moved back into her own suite. She quickly packed up her clothes and left before Jim could get back. She need not have bothered going too fast. Jim was too ashamed to face her right away. He then reached into his pocket and pulled out the piece of jewelry within. Jim had felt it was the perfect time to propose marriage. In the cargo hold he found spools of wire made out of valuable metals. He then fabricated a creative makeshift wedding band out of gold and silver. He went back to his tiny cabin. He slept it off for the night. Day 672 \"Log entry, Aurora Lane, \"I don't know what to do or say anymore! Jim Preston admitted to waking me up from hibernation. I don't know how he did it or what he did exactly. Obviously there was some way to sabotage hibernation pods. But now that I think about it, what are the odds? 1 hibernation pod by accident is one thing, but two? He admitted after I woke up that he had been alone for a year. He somewhat acted surprised when he first saw me there on the Grand Concourse, but now that I think about it his demeanor was just a little too casual. His look of surprise was just a little too much like a poor actor. And after being alone for an entire year, desperate for someone to share his loneliness? Of course he woke me up! How could I be so stupid!? \"He as good as killed me. I'm not dead yet, but I'm as good as dead. I am now trapped inside of a gilded cage with the man who had might as well have injected me with a contaminated sample of diseased blood that would kill me slowly…\" She then fell asleep crying without finishing her journal entry. Day 673 Aurora went to the communal passengers dining hall. She went to the food dispenser. She scanned her ID band and registered her as a gold class passenger. A selection was given to her and she hit the first button. A moment later at tray was presented to her full of food. \"Gold Class breakfast.\" said the computer. She took her tray to one of the tables and sat down. But to get food was just routine. She didn't realize that she wasn't that hungry. She thought about her predicament. She was going to die of old age on this ship. No different than any other day, except for the fact that she was all alone, with a man she hated. She hated Jim Preston because he's the one who put her in the situation to begin with. And to think that she actually fell in love with him. Of course that was before she knew the truth. And not to mention the countless times that she had sex with him. Was that not tantamount to rape? Granted he never forced himself on her, but he might as well have because he woke her up and then eventually seduced her, which would completely nullify any consent that she thought she had agreed to at the time. But at the same time she was conflicted. What was she to do now? \"Can I talk to you?\" said Jim's voice from behind her. She was disgusted that he had walked up behind her so casually like that. Without looking at him she got up and walked away. Please review![Chapter 15] Chapter 15 Food synthesizers. Invented by Nobel prize-winning engineer doctor Victor Blues, in the year 2091. He had been working with different kinds of gene-altering Technologies. By using a form of lasers and supercomputer, he could manipulate the structure of a molecule. He had been attempting to create a form of transmutation technology. With transmutation they would be able to turn pretty much any substance into another kind of substance. He worked on the technology all his life. But eventually he came up with a slightly lesser version. He found a way to take sufficient raw materials such as iron, carbon, nitrogen, and smaller quantities of a few other metals to create extremely fast within a short time any form of biological material. While most food is already dead from whatever plant or animal that it used to be, he could create the exact same thing only rather than dead it was simply never living to begin with. But would metabolize within the stomach acid the exact same way real food would, it would be just as nutritious, and could be made to look or taste like any food. Though using already existing biological matter was far easier. Take some plants stuff it into a blender and then turn the biological mush into whatever you want. As well as pretty much any kind of compost, or more gross and disgusting but just as good, fecal matter. It revolutionized the recycling of leftover food, or the creating of new food. It changed the world. Though in the beginning they were extremely large and expensive machines. But as the decades and centuries past they gradually came up with smaller versions that would be less expensive and available to almost everyone. Day 683 It had been 11 days since the truth had come out. Aurora was still in a state of despair. She wanted to contemplate suicide. But at the same time a part of her still wanted to live. Jim had made repeated attempts to approach her and get her to talk. 'What was there to talk about?' Aurora thought. She didn't want to listen. She didn't want to hear. She didn't want to hear his excuses. He wanted to somehow justify what he did to her. She was consumed with so much anger. She wanted Jim to suffer. She wanted him to hurt. She wanted a sense of satisfaction. She wanted to kill him in retaliation for killing her. She had entered his room. She had climbed on top of his bed near him where Jim then woke up and saw her there and then she proceeded to hit him. Punching him again and again. Jim did not retaliate, he merely raised his arms to fend off her blows. But then she fell off of the bed and noticed the large crowbar that he had used to break into the Vienna suite the first time. She held it up high ready to smash down on top of his head. Jim spread his arms aside allowing her to do it. Jim himself thought that he deserved it. And he didn't blame her for acting this way. A part of him thought it would be a blessed relief if he died at her hand. After what he did to her she deserved her revenge. But Aurora hesitated a little too long. Of course she wanted the satisfaction of him being hurt after what he did to her, but the same time for logic and reason kicked in, if he died then she would be in the same position that he was. She would be alone. With no possibility of companionship ever unless one day she was going to wake someone up herself. In frustration in several ways she threw the Crowbar down on the ground and stormed out of the room without a word. Now that she had calmed down, she tried to get back into a normal routine. She went swimming. She went jogging. Though Jim still made attempts to talk to her. She in turn did her best to avoid him. Day 689 Jim then decided to just tell her straight out without actually being face to face with her. Jim went to the security room. He activated the ship's audio broadcast system. And he broadcast himself all over the ship. Aurora was jogging around the Grand Concourse. The exercise seems to help. It allowed her to vent her energy. Plus exercise gives you endorphins. And endorphins trigger happiness and anti-depression. \"Aurora.\" Aurora heard over the audio broadcast system. \"I know that you won't listen to me or talk to me, so, don't talk. You don't have to even listen. Just hear, that'll be enough for me. I'm sorry for waking you up. I didn't mean to. I didn't want to. It wasn't an accident, no, but... I was just lonely for so long.\" Aurora already knew this. But she didn't think of that, she just thought about how she could still be asleep if it wasn't for him. \"There was no way for me to put myself back into hibernation. There was no solution to the problem. The only thing that I could do was commit suicide. And I was going to. But one day I was strolling through the Hibernation Bay and I saw you, I was interested. Not just on your physical Beauty, but I wanted to get to know you. I looked up your profile. I read all of your work that was in the database. And I fell in love. I fell in love with your mind. And then suddenly things didn't seem so bad anymore. You saved my life.\" Aurora was appalled. He saw her in the hibernation Bay one day, and that saved his life? If that was so he had a funny way of showing it! \"But it was only a temporary relief. The loneliness and depression kept building and building and at my lowest point, I took the selfish route. And I wish that I could take it back. But I can't. And I'm sorry.\" Jim was going to go on, and explain himself even further, but he didn't have the chance because Aurora exploded in the first words that she had spoken to him since storming out of the pub on her birthday. \"I DON'T CARE!\" screamed Aurora at the top of her lungs towards one of the security cameras. \"I DON'T CARE WHY YOU WOKE ME UP! I DON'T CARE HOW MISERABLE YOU WERE THAT MADE YOU DO IT! YOU TOOK MY LIFE!\" Jim then felt that he had said enough. And that he should leave her alone. He turned off the audio system and walked off. Day 699 Letting out her feelings like that had gotten a lot of things off of her mind. She felt a little bit more relaxed. She had simply had some things on her mind to say about the matter but she spent so much time avoiding Jim that she hadn't been able to vent her feelings, other than attacking him in the middle of the night. After that it seemed like they both tried to avoid each other. Which suited Aurora just fine. Though Jim wished that she would forgive him, no not forgive him, but just understand what he'd done and not be mad at him anymore. He was a decent enough guy about the matter that he knew he needed to be punished for his crime, but he just wondered if there would be a better and easier way about it. The only other time when they ran into each other was that apparently they shared the same Pub. With a ship that big you think that there would be more than one. Sometimes Jim would walk into the pub while Aurora was sitting at the bar with a drink. He would then tentatively go to the far side of the bar where then Aurora would leave. Or, he would just turn around and go back out. And sometimes it was the other way around. Shortly after that she confronted Jim in the middle of the Grand Concourse one day about the matter. \"Jim, I don't want to have to interact with you while at the pub. I get Arthur Mondays, Wednesdays, Friday's, and Saturdays. You get Arthur the other three days. Agreed?\" \"Yes.\" said Jim not wanting to argue and thinking that she was more than generous. Jim had found yet another malfunctioned janitorial robot. He was working on it. Seeing what he can do with the components or to get it up and running again or if you can make it better. He was trying to occupy his time to keep his mind away from the guilt that he was feeling for waking Aurora up. When all of a sudden the lights in his suite went out. They flickered and then some very dim lights came on. \"Please stand by, the system within your suite is rebooting. We apologize for the inconvenience.\" said the computer. Then the wall, which was basically a giant screen showing a view or landscape, disappeared and showed what seemed to be navigational data. Though he only got a quick glance at it so he wasn't sure what it was. The ships system were down trying to reboot. Taking far too long. There was too much lag. Jim didn't know what was going on. And in any case he had no idea how to determine what exactly it was. Day 721 \"Grand Concourse.\" said the computer as Aurora exited the elevator. She made her way towards the pub. \"Good afternoon Aurora.\" I said Arthur. \"What will I get for you?\" \"Martini please.\" she said. \"Coming right up.\" She sat down at the bar while Arthur mixed the drink. \"How are you doing Arthur?\" asked Aurora. Though she felt it was a stupid question. Arthur doesn't feel. His Pleasant personality and a joking manner is merely a program in his artificial intelligence. \"I'm doing quite well thank you.\" said Arthur.\"Yourself?\" She shrugged her shoulders. \"I'm doing better., He then served her the glass and then started polishing a glass with a clean dry cloth. After a little bit of silence Arthur decided to break the ice. \"Do you regret that I told you about Jim's Secret?\" She thought about that for a moment. Ignorance is bliss, what you don't know doesn't hurt you. But she was hurting because she was woken up, even if she was happy before she knew. But that of course the phrase, ignorance is bliss, her happiness was not real happiness her happiness is just ignorance of the facts. But at the same time, is it better to not know something. Some people choose to not know. If they know that someone knows something that might cause heartache, they will actually inquire the person to not tell her. Did Jim ask Arthur not to tell her because he was protecting her or was he protecting himself? \"I don't know. I guess that there are a lot of details in the matter to think of.\" \"Are you mad at me for telling?\" \"No Arthur. I'm not mad at you. I'm just mad at Jim for committing the crime.\" There was another long pause. \"You know I envy you Arthur.\" \"How so?\" asked Arthur. \"You have a purpose.\" said Aurora. \"You're always happy. Nothing ever upset you.\" \"How is your book coming along?\" asked Arthur. \"Sort of at a standstill.\" said Aurora. \"I've never written about myself before. I think that it's some of the best work that I've ever done, but, I lost all of my inspiration. There's only one person who can even read the book and I can't stand him. I don't know if I'll ever write again.\" \"Well, you know what they say, Time Heals all wounds.\" \"Heartbreak is a little bit more difficult.\" \"Have you considered simply forgiving him?\" asked Arthur. \"They say that those who don't forgive are just mean and stubborn.\" said Aurora. \"But at the same time, there are some things that are not so easily forgiven.\" \"Arthur!\" said Jim in a dramatic monotone as he entered the bar not immediately realizing that Aurora was in there. \"Tuesday is my day with Arthur.\" Jim reminded Aurora. \"Today is Wednesday.\" said Aurora indicating she had the moral High ground with their agreement but at the same time she felt that she had enough. She gulped down the rest of her drink and left. \"Bar is all yours.\" said Aurora. Jim sat at the bar. \"What will I get for you Jim?\" asked Arthur. \"Whiskey?\" \"No.\" said Jim. \"Coffee.\" Jim was trying to cut back on the booze again. \"No problem.\" said Arthur. Not having any coffee immediately on hand as Jim and Aurora don't order it often, Arthur reached underneath the bar to press few buttons on the food synthesizer to begin Brewing the coffee. It wasn't actually real coffee, but it was more or less just strongly caffeinated dark tea colored water with artificial coffee flavor that made the dark tea color water tastes exactly like the real thing. Fortunately both Jim and Aurora we're two of the people who couldn't tell the difference. Jim sat at the bar waiting for about 1 minute until Arthur lifted up from underneath the bar a transparent glass pot of dark brown nearly black liquid. He poured it into a ceramic mug and handed it to Jim. Jim took a sip. He knew that it was just artificially synthesized, but it was hot, and smelled, tasted, and looked exactly like the real thing. He was one of the 99 out of 100 people who couldn't tell the difference. \"So,\" said Arthur trying to make conversation as he began publishing a glass, \"what are your long-term plans for the future?\" \"I'm going to kiss Aurora's ass for the rest of her life.\" said Jim with a tone of remorse. \"But I can't kiss her ass unless she tells me what exactly she wants from me.\" \"I'm under the impression that she wants space.\" said Arthur. \"But perhaps you should do something for her. Something that she knows isn't just to butter her up, no, but rather you should do something for her that will touch her more deeply than simply buttering her up. Something that will move her so strongly, it's something that no one else who simply wants to go out with her would just do on a whim.\" Jim thought about that. What could it be? He knew that she liked New York City. And Central Park. Maybe a few potted plants on the Grand Concourse. He could obtain the plants from the Hydroponics Bay in the cargo hold. There were thousands of plants there in specialized near-perfect sustained environments. Not to mention a virtual Noah's Ark, there were literally 2 of every different animal that they could fit in there that were in stasis. One male and one female. Though all of the colony worlds probably already had this. Everything in the cargo hold was virtually trade goods anyway. He started to wonder what it would be like on Homestead 2. He trusted that they would simply be a thriving civilization. But he wondered how populated and spread out the planet would be. It was a 120 year trip one way. Of course when you're traveling at sublight speeds, the void between solar systems takes a while. The nearest star to the Sol System, is Proxima Centauri. A Red Dwarf star within close proximity to Alpha Centauri. Both stars have a planet within the 'habitable zone' of the orbit around their stars, both of which have molten cores for a magnetic field, and both of which have been terraformed and colonized by the homestead company. And traveling at sublight speeds takes nearly 10 years to get to Proxima Centauri from Earth. If Only they had discovered faster-than-light travel. But unfortunately they haven't. So they settle with the ion drive which grants extremely high velocity but still sublight speeds. Fortunately they didn't get too close to the speed of light, for if they did it would have created a 'time dilation' effect. Which would have created interestingly a shorter trip for the people inside the ship, though it would take just as long. But what he was thinking of was the ship getting to Homestead 2 after 120 years trip one way. A lot can happen to an independent civilization after 120 years. Maybe the scientists on the planet had made a huge breakthrough or discovery. Not that it matters. He won't be there to find out. But none the less Jim was going to try and find a way to soften Aurora's anger towards him. Please Review![Chapter 16] Chapter 16 February 15, 2198 There was a large flashy Ballroom. There was a Podium and a large number of seats set up in rows. It was a formal official press conference. Reporters from multiple news stations were there to hear what they were told was supposed to be important news. Then of from behind a curtain walking up to the podium came Nobel prize-winning physicist Doctor Daniel McIntosh. Cameras flashed while many people called out to him to ask him some questions. \"Please everyone there will be a full Q&A; in about an hour. If I can persuade you all please take your seats I will begin.\" said Daniel McIntosh. Once all of the reporters and other guests had taken their seats Daniel McIntosh began. \"I am here to announce to the public that I have made a remarkable breakthrough. I've been experimenting with the manipulation of the human nervous system and metabolism. \"To jump straight to the bottom line there is a number of very precise medical procedures that must be done perfectly without mistake. By using these sophisticated manipulations of the human metabolism it is possible to stop all metabolic activity within a human body. This puts a human being into a state of dreamless coma as well as prevents them from ever aging. It is essentially a form of complete and total 'Human Hibernation' AKA 'Suspended Animation'. \"I will not be taking any questions at just this time, but I am prepared to make a full demonstration.\" There was a flurry of questions from the audience as cameras flashed. A little while later. While all of the reporters were asked to remain quiet a volunteer was brought onto the stage by several technicians on a stretcher. Daniel McIntosh asked the assistant to begin the procedure. While the cameras recorded, it showed multiple injections throughout the volunteers body of muscle relaxants and sedatives. The procedure was done very precisely and perfectly the first time, after much practice on animals in the laboratory. The volunteer on the stretcher stopped breathing and his heart stopped beating. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said Daniel McIntosh, \"our volunteer subject has had all of his metabolic activity within his body completely halted. With his metabolic rates at zero he will not die, he will not age, he is immune to all diseases, and his brain will not run out of oxygen. This is still in the early stages of this new breakthrough, but we hope that in time we will find a way so that the muscles will atrophy either. \"He is in complete and total hibernation. As long as he's in hibernation he will live forever. To bring him out of hibernation requires merely a different set of different kinds of stimulants as well as to defibrillate his heart. It too is a delicate process and must be done correctly, but I assure you, my assistants have trained and practiced in the laboratory a thousand times and this is not the first volunteer subject that we have tried this on. After much practice on animals first, all of our human test subjects, which we took the utmost safety precautions on, all went into hibernation and successfully came out of hibernation without incident. \"We believe that the discovery of human hibernation will have multiple applications and it will change the world.\" Day 725 \"Aurora we love you! What are we going to do without you.\" said Aurora's friends on the holographic screen. She was observing the footage from a goodbye party that all of her friends had thrown her just before she had left Earth. Her best friend then was talking to the camera. \"Aurora, I promise to think of you every single day for the rest of my life. I know that when you reach Homestead 2 I'm going to be dead, but I know that you were never happy here. I know that you have this adventurous lifestyle that you need to live. But I just want to say that I hope you find your happiness. And I hope you find yourself a nice guy. Someone you can love and let into your life. So on that you can listen to your heart. Take chances. Be happy. Goodbye Aurora. I'm going to miss you.\" Aurora then started to think about all of the things that her friends had told her in her video of her goodbye party. She had so many people on Earth who loved her. BFF's that were loyal to her. But when she chose to leave Earth then ultimately be as good as dead to her friends. All they could do was offer support. But what could they really do to keep her in their life to get her to stay. It was too late for that now. And she wasn't even going to reach Homestead 2. She was still peeved at Jim for waking her up, but at the same time she did know human psychology, and she was not completely ignorant to the reason why Jim woke her up. She still felt that it was no excuse. She still felt like Jim was guilty but at the same time another part of her, even a part of her that still loved him, was coming up with excuses. He was desperate. He was insanely lonely. Who was she to judge a person like that with their actions. She then went down to the Grand Concourse. And she started walking on one of the upper levels where she looked down on Jim who was drawing some lines on the floor with a long ruler while he also had his toolbox near him. Looked like a plasma torch for cutting metal. She didn't know what he was doing, but obviously it was some kind of project. He was always busy, always working on a project. Maybe it was his way of alleviating his guilt. She felt that he should be guilty, but then that would mean that he was truly remorseful for his crime and that she would be the bad guy she didn't forgive him. The whole situation was just too confusing for her. She wished that she was still in hibernation. She wished that she could get back into hibernation. She thought about the love that she felt for Jim before she found out that he'd woken her up. He truly had been the perfect companion for her. He had been the perfect boyfriend in every way. He never did anything to hurt her other than waking her up itself. She thought about what her best friend had said for her to be happy and find someone. But at the same time she wanted to get to Homestead 2. And then eventually get back to Earth on her round trip ticket. She wish so desperately to be back in hibernation. She went to the hibernation Bay and crawled into her empty pod. The surface to lie on was soft. She curled up in a fetal position on her side and closed her eyes hoping that maybe her hibernation pod would close up over her and she would fall back into suspended animation. But it didn't work like that. A medical procedure needed to put her into hibernation and then while in hibernation be placed into the pod to stay in hibernation. She again felt Despair and hopelessness longing, as well as the cabin fever that Jim had felt before he woke her up. She returned to her cabin to take a shower and then go to bed. Jim walks into the pub apparently a lot happier than he'd been in a while. \"Hey Arthur.\" said Jim happily. \"Coffee please.\" \"Coming right up.\" said Arthur with a smile. He sat down on the bar stool with extremely dirty work pants. \"Are you soiling my Barstool?\" asked Arthur as he poured Jim the coffee. \"If you want to get things done, you got to get your hands dirty.\" \"What exactly have you been doing?\" asked Arthur. \"Improvements.\" Day 731 \"Grand Concourse.\" said the computer as Aurora exited the elevator. When she came onto the Grand Concourse she noticed that something was different. There was a tree. A real actual live tree in the middle of the Grand Concourse. The floor had been cut open with a plasma torch and filled with dirt. The tree must have come from the plant stasis facility in the cargo hold. She walked over to the tree and placed her hand on the tree trunk. It felt real. If it was fake, it was an awfully good fake. This is about the closest thing to Central Park that she would get to. And in that moment she felt a small twinge of extreme gratitude towards the man that had ultimately killed her. She then decided to go get herself some breakfast. So she headed back to the habitation module dining room. Please Review![Chapter 17] Chapter 17 Day 731 In the engineering section of the ship the temperature within the Reactor Core increased even further which caused an additional malfunction in some of the circuitry. The circuits sparked and surged with electricity causing some of the processors to burn out. The Redundant systems immediately took over as they were supposed to but their processes were too many. Where then the next system failure was the diagnostic station on the bridge. With the diagnostic system failure the Redundant systems attempted to compensate. But it was then where the Redundant systems had taken on far too much and then the next system failure was the Redundant system itself. The Secondary redundant systems immediately covered for the primary redundant systems but they were taking on too much. There was then more than a hundred different simultaneous malfunctions. Several of the malfunctions caused power surges through the crew hibernation quarters. The Redundant systems then prioritized only 257 out of the 258 crew members hibernation pods. The one hibernation pod that was not prioritized then had a processing glitch in its primary computer core for several seconds too long and by the time it was up and running the hibernation pod thought that the ship's Journey had come to an end and that it was time to awaken the occupant, and began the second hibernation pod failure in the history of space travel. The reanimation process began. But by the time the hibernation pod's processes came back into primary function it caused the reanimation process to be done incorrectly. Several nervous system stimulants were not injected into him and his heart was defibrillated incorrectly. Augustus Mancuso woke up. His body felt like lead. He was familiar with the feeling. Having being put in and out of hibernation several times throughout his life. In fact he had been put into hibernation so many times that he was actually born when the ion drive was first invented hundreds of years earlier. He trusted that space travel was safe. He trusted that hibernation was safe. At no point did he ever have any reason to fear being on a ship. He always loved space travel. He had long since abandoned his family on Earth who are all now dead, and dedicated his life to working aboard the Starships. There were many such people who lived lives like that. The holographic face appeared in front of him. \"Good morning Gus. How are you feeling.\" He groaned. \"Ugg! Like shit!\" \"The discomfort will pass. Post hibernation sickness is normal.\" Gus never liked these interactive recorded Holograms. They always point out the blatantly obvious. Though there are some employees where it's their first time on the job. \"Let's check your vitals.\" said the interactive hologram. \"The Avalon is on Final Approach. When you are ready, proceed to your cabin for some rest where in the morning you may begin Duty.\" \"Thank you.\" said Gus. There was then a reprimanding beeping sound as a laser scanner swept over his body. \"There are some abnormalities in your nervous system. Before you go to your cabin please go to the infirmary for a full checkup.\" He climbed out of his hibernation pod and made his way towards the door. He waved his ID band over the sensor on the side of the door and the reinforced metal hatch opened. He walked out in a disoriented State about to make his way towards the infirmary when suddenly he tripped on something in the middle of the floor and fell to the floor. Fortunately he had put his hands out in front of him just in time to break his fall. \"What in the world?!\" he said in bewilderment. When he looks at what had caused him to trip he realized that he had tripped over a tool box that was left in the middle of the hall. And there was all kinds of cluttered tools everywhere. \"What member of the crew woke up before me left all this lying around?\" he said in anger. When he looked up and down the hallway he saw on the walls of the bridge and around the consoles by the door that there were charred and had scorch marks. He was curious about this as why this happened. When he then looked back inside the crew hibernation room he noticed that only his pod had woken him up while all of the others were still in stasis. After his trip and fall he had felt slightly more awake now and he made his way to the Infirmary. When he got there he realized that no one was there but rather than go for his check up as the computer had told him to do he made his way down to the crew quarters. He changed out of his shorts and tank top and into his uniform. If he was going to encounter anyone to inquire about the mess and the Damage that was done around the consoles he thought that he might as well look professional. Gus then made his way to the elevator. He waved his ID band over the sensor by the door and it let him inside. He then pressed the button for the Grand Concourse. \"Please buckle up and secure any loose items.\" said the computer's voice coming out of the wall. \"This elevator will experience a momentary lapse in gravity.\" He fastened a seatbelt and he waited the short ride for the elevator to take him to the Grand Concourse. \"Grand Concourse.\" said the computer that let him out of the door. When he stepped onto the Grand Concourse he looked around. Everything seemed to be in order. He wondered why he was the first of the crew to wake up. Most likely the Captain would have been woken up first, he usually was. And then there are a few other of the service personnel. He was feeling nauseous and had a headache but he attributed that to simply the hibernation sickness that he should be experiencing. He was experiencing that as well. He wasn't entirely sure what went wrong if anything went wrong but it seemed that everything was out of order. \"Hello.\" said the artificial intelligence help station off to the side. \"Welcome to the Grand Concourse how can I help you.\" Gus walked over to the help station. \"Am I the first of the crew to wake up?\" he asked. \"Several members of the crew should have woken up before you.\" said the help station. He himself had had enough of these help stations throughout the several Journeys that the ship had taken while he served aboard it. When he then looked over to one area of the Grand Concourse he then saw something that was completely out of order. A tree had been planted in the middle of the metal floor. When he walked over to observe it seemed that the metal floor had been cut out with a welding torch, and then filled with dirt and then the tree was planted directly into it, roots and all. Clearly this tree came from the plant and animal stasis area within the cargo hold. He then threw his hands up in the air in surrender and decided to just go to the security station and do a ship wide announcement. When he got to the security station he activated the audio system that would broadcast his voice to be heard all over the ship. \"This is Deck Chief Gus Mancuso.\" said Gus into the microphone. \"Who in the hell planted a tree on my ship?\" Letting that message sink in to whoever had done it he then decided to leave the security office and walk back to the tree. He stood by the tree for 4 minutes while he just waited. On the 4th minute there he heard footsteps running in his direction. He turned and saw a man running down one of the hallways and then stopped a few meters away from him and looked at him with surprise and bewilderment. Gus took the look on his face as that the man could not believe that he was there. A moment later there was a woman who ran towards him from another direction she had the same look of surprise and shock on her face that he was there. 'She's hot,' thought Gus. He was more than twice her age her senior, but he was still a man, and he could appreciate the extremely attractive beauty of a young girl. But at the same time he was a gentleman and first and most of all professional. He then pointed his thumb towards the tree and put a look of irritation on his face. \"Who did that?\" he asked with irritation in his voice, though more curiosity than irritation was actually going on in his mind. \"I did.\" said the man. \"And you are?\" Gus asked him. \"Jim Preston.\" said the man. He then looked towards the woman. \"Aurora Lane.\" said the woman. \"Anyone else awake?\" asked Gus in a tone of disbelief that even two of them were awake at all. \"Just him and I.\" said Aurora Lane. \"How far along are we?\" asked Gus directing his question towards Jim Preston. \"88 years to go.\" said Jim Preston. Gus thought about that for a moment. 32 years into the journey and there have been...he scarcely even thought the thing, but he then realized that he had not been awoken 5 months before landing like the ship was automatically supposed to do on year 120. Something had gone wrong with his hibernation pod and he had been awoken prematurely because of a...hibernation malfunction? And then it occurred to him. There was no other way that it could have happened to these two. These two also had hibernation malfunctions. So much as one hibernation malfunction was supposed to be impossible, but three? He can scarcely comprehend the concept of it with all of his ingrained beliefs. \"Hibernation failure?\" said Gus with a look on his face of confusion and disbelief. \"They said that that couldn't happen. 3 pod failures? Three people awake.\" He had been staring off into space while he thought these unusual scenarios over in his mind and hadn't seen the look of accusation in Aurora's face while she looked at Jim Preston when he mentioned that there had been three pod failures. \"There's no time to waste.\" said Gus with urgency. \"We need to check out the ship's systems on the bridge right now.\" He directed Aurora and Jim towards the elevator where they both got on board and he hit the button for the command ring. \"Please buckle up and secure any loose items. This elevator will experience a momentary lapse in gravity.\" said the voice in the wall. Short elevator ride later they both exited the elevator. \"Command Ring.\" said the computer's voice. They walked in and around the Clutter of discarded tools that were on the floor, where Gus then waived his right wrist over the door sensor beside the door. There was a beeping sound and the door open for them. \"You have no idea how long I have been trying to get in here.\" said Jim with a tone of both awe and relief. \"Well, now that you are in here, don't touch anything!\" said Gus the tone of authority. \"So, you work in here?\" asked Aurora. \"No, I'm the deck chief.\" said Gus. \"One of the command level senior officers, but I don't work on the bridge. Here on the bridge is usually the flight crew and the captain. I work around the rest of the ship. Mostly auditing the work of the engineers and mechanical technicians.\" There was reprimanding alert coming out of a speaker in the ceiling after Jim had touched one of the buttons on one of the consoles. \"Unauthorized access!\" said the computer's voice. Both of Gus and Aurora looked at Jim with reprimanding faces. \"Sorry.\" said Jim. Gus then went to the diagnostic station and hit the button that was supposed to light up the holographic three-dimensional screen. \"Okay, this isn't right. There should be dozens of different Diagnostics coming into this station from all over the ship, but there's no data. The data will be stored in data modules around the ship. Will have to go to each data station on each level of each module, and collect the data with these storage devices.\" He pulled out a drawer and then pulled out a whole bunch of long flat bulky looking discs. He then looked at the station that monitors the ship's navigational sensors. \"Whatever is wrong with the ship, hasn't affected the navigation yet, because we're still on course.\" said Gus, half to himself and half to the other two. \"You think that there's something wrong with the ship?\" said Aurora with a tone of worry and her voice at the idea of the concept of the thing. \"Diagnostic station is off-line, and three pod failures. Yes, something most definitely is wrong to ship.\" he said with a tone of both surety and concern. \"Wouldn't it be easier to just turn the ship around and go back to Earth?\" asked Aurora. \"We're moving at half the speed of light. Going back would take just as long as going on.\" said Gus. They were about to exit through the entrance of the bridge when suddenly Gus staggered on his ankles and leaned against the wall. \"Are you alright?\" asked Jim. \"Hibernation hangover.\" said Gus. \"Get it all the time.\" He had apparently recovered and then he led them to the elevator. \"Grand Concourse.\" said the computer's voice as they exited the elevator. \"Clearly you two have been around for awhile, any more trees that I should know about?\" asked Gus. But before Jim could say anything, \"Look out!\" said Aurora as she grabbed Gus's arm and pulled him to the side just as one of the janitorial robots fell from the upper level and landed right where Gus had been a second earlier. It's hard impact on the ground from falling so far had caused it to shatter into several dozen pieces. Gus observe the wreckage of the robot for a few moments in curiosity at the anomaly. \"Okay?\" said Gus. \"I most certainly never seen anything like that before.\" \"In the two years since I have woken up these robots have been breaking down one at a time every now and then.\" said Jim. \"This one makes...15.\" \"Whatever is happening must have affected the artificial intelligence control of the ship's janitorial robots.\" said Gus. \"Malfunctioning hibernation pods. Malfunctioning diagnostic station on the bridge. And malfunctioning robots. I wonder what other systems have been affected?\" \"The food dispenser in the dining hall went haywire this morning.\" said Aurora. \"I was locked in the elevator for several minutes this morning just before I heard your announcement.\" said Jim. \"Two weeks ago I was locked in my cabin for two days.\" said Aurora. \"You were?\" said Jim when he looked at her with surprise. \"Well, clearly whatever is going on we do need to fix it.\" said Gus. \"Come on, let's go look at that diagnostic data.\" They went to the diagnostic control stations of the Grand Concourse. \"You should find about 12 of these stations on each level of the luxury module and habitation module and the cargo hold.\" said Gus. He inserted one of the large flat discs into the station waited a few seconds and then pulled it out. \"The data will sync instantly. Once you've gone to each station and you've collected all of the data bring it back to the diagnostic station on the bridge. Me however, I want to start with where these problems on the ship all started. Our malfunctioning hibernation pods.\" \"That oughta be interesting.\" said Aurora in a tone of secretive accusation. Please review![Chapter 18] Chapter 18 Day 731 Gus went back to the command ring and reentered the crew hibernation room. He took the toolbox from right outside the door that was lying on the ground among the clutter, and he went over to his hibernation pod. He pulled open the circuit board panel on the side underneath. Several of the minor components were powered down and not receiving any electrical input from the surrounding components that they were wired to. He touched the help screen on the primary control panel of his hibernation pod where it indicated that the occupant had been discharged. He activated the function for a full diagnostic. After a few moments the results came in saying, '42% of the systems within the hibernation pod were offline. Cause - multiple system failures from the the ship's hibernation maintenance systems. Redundant systems were unable to compensate.' \"This is messed up!\" said Gus in a combination of both irritation and disbelief. \"Habitation module.\" said the voice of the computer as Gus had exited the elevator door. He made his way to the passengers hibernation Bay. He looked up and down the rows of hibernation pods where he saw each occupant inside still asleep as they were supposed to be. He pulled out a holographic notepad and had it direct him towards Jim Preston's hibernation pod. When he got there, he took a look at the thing. He had the touch screen give him a full diagnostic of the hibernation pod. After a few moments it gave a chime of approval saying that all systems within the hibernation pod were operating at 100% except that the time and date were unreliable. He knelt down and opened up the circuit board panel on the side. After some detailed scrutiny, he found what was wrong. The clock ship that was supposed to control the time and date setting was burnt out. He immediately knew that without the clock ship operating, the Pod would think that the journey had come to an end and that it was time to awaken the occupant. With the Pod still operating at 100% just without the time and date, the reanimation process should be full and complete. He then now come to the conclusion that with his hibernation pod systems so messed up his reanimation process had been done incorrectly which explained the symptoms that he had which he now determined were far more than post hibernation sickness. He hoped that it wasn't fatal. Though without a way to get back into hibernation he was most likely doomed to die of old age on the ship before he reached Homestead 2. He looked at his holographic Notepad and had it direct him towards the hibernation pod of Aurora Lane. When he got there hers looked identical to Jim's hibernation pod. He had the systems on the touchscreen do a full diagnostic. It to gave results that the Pod was operating at 100% only that the time and date were unreliable. He knelt down on the floor beside her pod and pulled out the circuit board panel. He immediately went for the clock chip. When he pulled it out though, he knew that something was wrong and not just that it was burnt out but rather there were two very distinct electrical scorch marks on either side of its main leads into the computer core. Someone had connected to miniature jumper cables on either side of it and deliberately charged it with the electricity. This is not the damage that the chip would receive from a malfunction. This was deliberate sabotage. It was then that he could sense the presence of someone behind him. When he turned around he was looking into the face of Jim Preston who is standing a distance away just being quiet. \"Shouldn't you be making your rounds?\" asked Gus. \"I'm finished.\" said Jim as he held up the large data discs that he was holding. \"I walked over to you here just now because I wanted to talk to you about Aurora's hibernation pod.\" 'This should be an interesting conversation.' thought Gus. \"I thought you might.\" said Gus. \"I checked out all 3 of our hibernation pods. The problem with your hibernation pod is quite simple really. Burnt-out clock chip. It's not supposed to happen, and I don't know how it happened, but none the less it did happen. \"My hibernation pod is not the same as yours and Aurora's. It's much more complicated. It failed because of multiple system failures from the ship's redundant systems that were supposed to maintain all of the hibernation pods. Caused my hibernation pod systems to go haywire when it initiated the reanimation process incorrectly. It's probably why I'm feeling so bad.\" He then gave them mild cough as though he was choking on something. \"But Aurora's pod…\" he continued as he then stood up and then paused, \"...you did this.\" It wasn't a question but merely a statement of fact. \"I won't deny it.\" said Jim. \"You know, when I first realized that the three of us were awake because of hibernation failure, I thought back up there on the Grand Concourse when I saw the two of you that you had to be the luckiest son-of-a-bitch in the universe to get stuck alone on this ship with a girl like her...but it wasn't luck was it?\" \"No, it wasn't.\" said Jim with a neutral tone of voice. \"She knows?\" asked Gus, not entirely sure whether or not Aurora was living in state of blissful ignorance right now. \"Yeah.\" said Jim. \"She knows. She's pretty mad at me.\" \"I assume you did it...because you were alone?\" said Gus wording it modestly, thinking of the 'man trapped on a deserted island' scenario. \"Yeah.\" said Jim with the tone of remorse. \"How long were you alone before you woke her up?\" \"A year.\" \"What led up to your decision in actually doing the deed of waking her up?\" asked Gus, not looking for an excuse, no, but rather merely trying to understand Jim's mindset when he committed the deed. \"I tried to put myself back into hibernation, but there was no way to do it. You know the process for being put in hibernation.\" explained Jim. \"I tried everything for months, I was completely stuck in my situation and there was nothing I could do. With that I would just like to say that I would like to write a very criticizing letter to the Homestead Company. They focused so hard on preventing hibernation failure from ever happening in the first place that they failed to create a contingency protocol on what someone was supposed to do if it ever actually did happen.\" Gus closed his eyes and nodded with a serious frown. \"I understand.\" said Gus. \"As time went by, I just became so lonely and suicidal with loneliness that I felt that I needed to awaken another one of the passengers for companionship. I didn't wake her up on a whim, no, I worked myself up to it for a very long time. And my conscience always told me not to do it and for the longest time I didn't. And I didn't just select her at random. I saw her face by accident one day, and then I got to know her from the database and I fell in love with her mind. And then I woke her up, only, and I stress, ONLY...in my darkest hour out of desperation.\" Gus did not approve of Jim's actions of waking Aurora up. But at the same time he couldn't blame Jim for what he did. No disrespect intended towards Aurora's situation because of it. \"I understand.\" said Gus. \"But still…'Damn'!\" said Gus referring to the situation of being trapped on the ship with Aurora anyway. With the mystery of the hibernation pods solved he then took the data disks and headed off to the bridge. When he got to the bridge he inserted the data disks into the diagnostic console and the data synced with the holographic display. The diagnostic console then showed the diagnostics as if the rest of the ship had been running as each system failure had come up. There were hundreds of system failures in the last 2 years. But it just seemed to be a chain reaction as though each system failure was causing the next. But Gus could understand why. The Redundant systems were supposed to take care of the occasional system failure but the system failures weren't supposed to continue. There seemed to be something on the ship that was causing the system failures steadily and continuously. And the rate of system failure was continuing to increase. The door to the bridge then opened which he had set to allow for the ID bands of Aurora Lane and Jim Preston. Out of the side of his eye he noticed that Aurora entered the room carrying her data discs. She handed the disks to him and he plugged them into the diagnostic station where it then displayed the Diagnostics that were stored on the disks. \"Same as all the others.\" said Gus more to himself than to Aurora. \"A large number of randomly occurring system malfunctions but no apparent connection.\" Aurora on the other hand had her interest on something else for this conversation. \"You checked out the hibernation pods?\" she asked, half a statement of fact and half a question. \"Yeah.\" said Gus. \"I did.\" \"So, you know...that he deliberately woke me up?\" said Aurora with impatience. \"Yes.\" said Gus. \"I know.\" he acknowledged. \"...And!?\" prompted Aurora with impatience. \"It's not my place to judge him on matters of morals and ethics,\" \"He woke me up!\" said Aurora loudly and firmly interrupting him in mid-sentence. \"He took my life!\" \"I understand that.\" said Gus sympathetically. \"But I'm just a little bit busy trying to solve some technical problems the ship,\" \"It's murder!\" she interrupted him in mid-sentence again giving a statement of philosophical semantics. He put down his electronic notepad and gave her his attention. \"Okay, I understand.\" said Gus explaining his view of semantic ethics on the matter. \"His actions have had huge negative impact on you. But you need to understand the situation that he was in. He was desperate. He was desperately desperate. The man was drowning. You need to understand about a 'drowning man' is that they are always going to drag someone down with them. Don't get me wrong, I'm on your side. But I also need to sympathize with him for his situation; I'm not saying that it's right, no, but the man is still drowning. What I'm saying is that while I sympathize with you for what is happened to you because of his actions, if I was one of the jurors at his trial in a court of law, I would verdict him guilty, yes, but verdict that he be 'excused' of punishment because he was under extreme duress from no fault of his own.\" Aurora of course already knew this. She knew that Jim had been crazy with cabin fever when he chose to wake her up and she'd been told by Arthur that he had not walking her up on a whim, no, but rather he had to work himself up to it for months. But at the same time her selfish angry side wanted to blame him and make him a villain. It was then that the door to the Bridge opened and Jim walked in carrying a janitorial robot in his hand. \"This one makes 16.\" he said. It was then that Gus staggered and started coughing again and again as though he had something stuck in his throat. \"Are you alright Gus?\" asked Aurora. \"You just got out of hibernation.\" said Jim. \"You're supposed to get some rest before you do anything.\" \"You're right.\" said Gus. \"But, just a few short hours and then right back to this first thing in the morning.\" Gus exited the bridge and made his way to the elevator. \"I need a drink.\" he said to himself. \"Grand Concourse.\" said the computer as Gus exited the elevator. He made his way to the pub. Arthur was at the far end of the bar behind the bar when he slid over on his track in the floor to give Gus his attention. \"Hello Chief Mancuso,\" said Arthur, \"what can I get for you? The usual?\" \"Yes Arthur, thank you.\" said Gus. A few moments later Arthur prepared a Long Island Iced Tea. \"Thank you Arthur.\" said Gus. \"You're welcome.\" said Arthur. Arthur then picked up a clean glass and a clean washcloth and started polishing the glass. \"So how are you doing chief.\" asked Arthur. \"Hibernation failure.\" said Gus absent-mindedly. \"Yes that seems to be happening a lot lately.\" \"Do you know what's going on with this ship?\" asked Gus. Arthur thought for a second, his AI scanning the ship's computer. \"I don't have access to that. But things have been happening. I have merely been tending to my primary function of tending bar and serving the customers.\" \"And you do it well Arthur.\" He finished the rest of his drink. \"Thanks for the drink Arthur.\" \"Anytime Chief.\" Gus then made his way to his quarters. When he got to his cabin he felt extremely weak. He then coughed into his hand and realize that he had coughed up blood. He was worried. What did his symptoms mean? He got into bed lying down under his covers fully clothed and fell asleep quickly. Day 732 Unbeknownst to the diagnostic station, there were another 29 simultaneous system malfunctions throughout the ship. Which then caused more of the Redundant systems to fail which then resulted in a burned-out processor that operated the centripetal rotation of the ship. As the ship carried on its course the ship stopped spinning. The Redundant systems were supposed to take over, but the Redundant systems that had not failed yet were already taking on too much and while they were attempting to reboot the centripetal rotation there was an extreme amount of lag on some additional computer processes that had not completed their process yet. 3 long whole minutes this major system that was prioritized among the Redundant systems remained offline until finally at the start of the fourth minute the Redundant systems got through the lag of the excess processes and reinitialized the centripetal rotation of the ship. Gus then heard banging on his door that roused him from his sleep. \"Gus!\" said the voice of Aurora Lane. \"Gus, open the door!\" Gus got out from underneath the bed covers and walked to the door where he then waved his right hand over the door sensor. The door opened. There was Jim, he had changed into clean clothes, while Aurora had wet hair and glistening skin that was only half dry, while wearing a bathrobe and bathing suit. \"What is it?\" asked Gus. \"You didn't feel that?\" \"Feel what?\" asked Gus. \"The gravity just went out.\" said Jim. \"I almost broke my arm by falling too far to the floor in my cabin.\" \"I was in the pool and almost drowned in floating water.\" said Aurora. Gus's sleep had been too deep and he had been partially tied to his bed with his tucked in sheets. \"My sleep was very deep.\" said Gus. \"Let's get back to the bridge.\" Please review![Chapter 19] Chapter 19 Day 732 Aurora made a slight detour to her cabin to change out of her bathing suit. When Aurora got to the bridge Jim and Gus were working at some of the consoles doing Diagnostics on systems and looking over data. \"So what's the verdict?\" asked Aurora. \"On the ship's systems?\" \"There are two kinds of systems.\" said Gus. \"Priority One systems, and secondary priority systems. Secondary priority systems are basically minor systems that we can do without. Number one priority systems however are absolute essential systems that are extra protected by extra redundancies. So far according to these Diagnostics on the data, none of the Priority One systems have failed yet. Until now of course. The ship's centripetal rotation is a number one priority system. \"That means that whatever is happening is starting to hit the big ticket items within the ship's systems. Not good! If the ship's centripetal rotation can actually stop because of a malfunction, then that means that any of the number one priority systems could fail at any time. Life support, the reactor core, main power, etc.\" \"So what do we do?\" asked Aurora. \"Computer, display me a timeline from now back until the 1st malfunction took place.\" A holographic display then appeared on the Diagnostics console showing raised and falling bars from their present-day all the way back to day one when the first malfunction happened. \"There.\" pointed Gus towards the first bar on day one. \"The computer says that something happened, only it's not sure what. But something happened which then resulted in 17 simultaneous malfunctions but only 16 were taken over by the Redundant systems, their systems were not able to compensate for the malfunction of hibernation pod 1498.\" \"The day that I woke up.\" said Jim. \"After that the malfunctions continued, but more than just continued, the rate of malfunctions is accelerating. At this rate systems are going to burn out from being overworked and all of the number one priority systems are going to fail.\" \"When?\" asked Aurora. \"Computer, based on the rate of malfunction increase, what will happen if this continues.\" A mathematical calculation was made by the computer and the rising and falling bars and graphs extended past the present and into the future on the holographic display. \"Complete and total system failure imminent. All Ships systems will permanently shut down in 23 hours and 19 minutes.\" They were all silent for a while at this news. \"So,\" said Aurora with a tone of despair and resigned resignation to doom in her voice, \"we are stuck...on a sinking ship!\" \"Is there any way to stop it?\" asked Jim. \"Need to find the source of the problem.\" said Gus. \"If we can find out what is causing the continuous malfunctions, and stop it, then we may restore all systems permanently. We're going to the engineering section.\" They got in the elevator and push the button that required an employee's ID band. But then took them down a different elevator route that brought them to the rear module of the ship. The interior floor surface area was a large cylinder. And it was bigger than several football stadiums. And it was filled with all kinds of equipment and machinery for operating the ship. \"Alright. So where do we begin?\" asked Aurora. But before Gus could say anything he then fainted on the ground. \"Gus!\" said Aurora with worry. \"We need to get him to the Infirmary.\" said Jim. Together they picked him up and carried him back into the elevator. Jim pressed the button for the command ring. When they got to the command ring, they Carried Gus to the Infirmary. They then carried him and placed him inside the autodoc. The autodoc then scanned him with laser scanners. Jim looked at the screen as the word disorders appeared at the top and then dozens upon dozens of disorders showed up in a long list. By the time the list was over the final one was had a count of 642. \"What's wrong with me?\" asked Gus. \"It's a few things.\" said Jim significantly down playing it. \"642 disorders found.\" said the computer out loud. \"Get me out of here.\" The autodoc opened. Gus climbed out with the help of Jim and Aurora holding his arms. He got to his feet and walked to the console. \"Computer. Tell me what is wrong with me.\" \"I am unable to discuss such matters without a physician present.\" said the computer. He waived his right wrist over the console and it beeped detecting his ID band. \"Override on my authority. Security password 2317.\" \"Massive nervous system failure, mixed with cellular degeneration. Cause unknown.\" said the computer. \"My goofy hibernation pod that's the reason!\" said Gus in extreme irritation. \"Multiple organ failure is imminent.\" said the computer. \"Computer, are there any treatments available for curing him.\" asked Jim. \"Several treatments are available for this condition, but there is no cure. None of the treatments will meaningfully extend the patient's life.\" 'I'm going to die!\" Gus thought in despair towards himself. His life was over. And there was nothing that he could do. \"How long do I have?\" asked Gus with reluctant resignation. \"Complete and total nervous system and organ failure is already in its final stages.\" said the computer. The medication dispenser then dispensed four multi colored capsule pills into a little bowl. \"These sedatives will alleviate your symptoms in these final hours.\" said the computer. Hobbling on the balls of his feet as though he was injured he slowly walked out of the room without taking the pills. He then turned back towards Aurora and Jim. \"I need a minute.\" he said getting his bearings while accepting his fate with dignity. He refused the medication because he felt that he could do without it. He felt that there was no point. What is the point of alleviating your symptoms in your final hours. Aurora and Jim left him alone to give him his space and dignity. Gus dressed himself in his work uniform. And then he went to the viewing area. He just wanted to look at the stars. She saw the movement of the Stars constantly going upwards which in turn was actually just the centripetal rotation of the ship. About an hour had passed. He needed to fix the ship, but he didn't have the strength or time to do it. He felt himself getting weaker. Getting more fatigued. He should get up, he thought to himself, he should find Aurora and Jim and give them instructions. Jim is a mechanical engineer, and a competent one, he just needs the means to get around the ship. He was about to get up to go and find them with what little strength he had left, when he heard their footsteps coming up behind him as they walked into the viewing area. He felt his symptoms getting worse, pain, nausea, mental fatigue and inability to concentrate and he didn't like it. And then felt like a silly little child who is just being stubborn. \"Should have taken the damn pills!\" said Gus referring to his symptoms. \"I'll go get them.\" said Jim as he was about to get up. \"No.\" said Gus. \"Stay. I have some instructions to give to you two. There's not much time left. The ship is going to be destroyed unless you fix it.\" He then turned to Aurora. \"Aurora. I know that you're mad at Jim for waking you up, but you have got to forgive him. Not for his benefit, no, but for yours. The longer you're mad at him, you're only hurting yourself. You have to spend the rest of your life on this ship with him, and there's nothing that can be done about it. You need to trust Jim to take care of you. And I think that after what he did to you you can count on him kissing your ass for the rest of your life.\" He then turned to Jim, and then he handed him his ID bracelet. \"My ID band. My password is 2317. My ID band will get you into secure areas. Simply wave my ID band over the door sensor and say my password and the computer will think that you are me.\" His torso than wobbled on his hips as his eyes and head drooped. \"Fix the ship! Take care of each other. You're going to be each other's only company. You're going to need each other for emotional and moral support.\" He then lay down on his side and rested his head on the floor. Jim checked for his breathing and his pulse. \"He's dead.\" said Jim. The lights then dimmed. The ship than shook and red emergency lights then came on but they were a poor substitute for the bright white lights that regularly illuminated the rooms. Aurora closed her eyes took in a deep breath and let it out and she said to herself inside her mind, \"I forgive you Jim.\" She said it with all of her understanding for the duress and Desperation that he was under when he committed the act of waking her up. Aurora then focused on the task at hand. \"Jim.\" said Aurora. \"Can you fix the ship?\" \"I think I can.\" said Jim with confidence. \"I'll need you to come with me.\" They got up and ran out into the Grand Concourse. As they headed for the elevator when they went by the pub. And they saw that Arthur was going haywire as were all the other systems on the ship. The gravity kept cutting out for brief moments. The janitorial robots were all over the place doing nothing in particular. As the ship shook and the gravity went out random objects that were not secured fell over. They ran into the pub and attempted to stop Arthur from hurting himself as he was banging his head on the bar. It again grabbing glasses and breaking them. Jim left over the bar and went behind the bar where he then reached for the circuit board at the base of Arthur's torso. One of the many technical manuals that he had examined in the past two years was interestingly about the artificial intelligence bartender. He pulled out the circuit board that operated his main systems and Arthur then went into low-power mode. They ran to the elevator. Fortunately it was still working though it paused a few times on its way. They had pressed the button for the engineering section. Wherever the problem would be it would be in a place with a lot of computers and circuit boards. When they got off the elevator in the engineering section they then looked at the giant colossal room. \"We got 22 hours until full system failure, at least that's what the computer said.\" said Jim. \"Let's just start looking at random.\" \"Jim, this might sound extremely hypocritical of me to say, but shouldn't we wake up a few members of the crew to help us?\" \"If we had the time, yes, but it'll take too long for them to be up to their full mental faculties. So we don't have time. We might as well let them sleep and we fix the ship ourselves.\" \"Okay,\" said Aurora, \"just out of curiosity, what exactly is it that we are looking for?\" \"Something broken.\" said Jim. So for the next 2 hours they went from circuit board panel to circuit board panel pulling each one out of the slots that they were in to see if they were damaged. Everything seemed to be alright. Therefore the problem was not there. They kept looking. Another hour after that they tried to go through a door. But even with Gus's password and ID band the door would not open. The door just kept giving off a reprimanding buzzing sound refusing to open. \"Something must be wrong.\" said Jim off hand merely concerned about the technical anomaly of the door not opening. \"We're looking for wrong.\" pointed out Aurora.[Chapter 20] Chapter 20 Day 732 Jim then took out a tool that would allow him to bypass doors. This tool was useless for the bridge and crew quarters, but it would work for this door. When he bypassed the door and it opened they were taken off guard as the air around them was sucked like a giant vacuum cleaner into the room. They saw the rush of freezing condensed air go into a small hole in the floor about the size of a basketball. 'A hull breach!' thought Jim in a panic as he was hanging on to the door and holding it open with his body because the computer immediately tried to close the door in order to prevent the evacuation of the atmosphere from the other side. Aurora was holding on to a bar in the middle of the room going from floor to ceiling. Not an easy feat as the bar was colder than ice. Jim managed to kick and dislodge the glass notepad that had been blown against the grate. The glass Notepad went towards the hole in the floor and covered 99% of the hole, preventing the air from evacuating very fast. One of the many things that a ship has in case of emergency throughout the ship, though the people who made the ship always hoped that the emergency won't arise, is a foam like metal substance from fire-extinguisher-like canisters on the wall. Spray them into an area and it comes out as liquid and then foams up and solidifies in seconds. Aurora let go of the bar and attempted to secure the notepad Over the Hole. Jim let go of the door and the door shut. What little air was in the room continued to evacuate around the sides of the glass notepad and they could feel their ears popping. Jim grab the fire extinguisher like canister from the wall and told her to get out of the way and sprayed the notepad that was covering the hole. The foam like substance solidified in seconds and the computer then repressurized the room. They both sat on the floor and breathed hard exhausted as well I was out of breath from the atmosphere. \"There is a hole in the ship!\" said Aurora in disbelief. \"I thought the ship was supposed to be meteorite proof?\" \"I guess one got through.\" said Jim. \"Let's find out where it goes.\" They followed the path of the meteorite puncture that went through several walls, ceilings, and floors. After going up and down several different staircases and doors they came to a wall with the meteorite puncture where Jim then held his hand in front of it when he saw some glowing orange light coming through. His hand felt heat coming out. \"It's hot.\" said Jim. They went around the corner and then came to a closed-door. Jim waved Gus's ID band which he had had the sense to stick into his pocket securely before they opened the door that sucked out of vacuum. The door admitted them. When the door opened it lead into the reactor control room. The room was sweltering hot. Well over 40 degrees Celsius. On the wall opposite from the door was a glass window made of a remarkable clear transparent space-age polymer that was supposed to withstand extreme heat and pressure. On the other side of the glass they saw the ship's fusion power reactor. The reactor itself was a high output fusion generator that creates a vortex-like cyclone of light glowing blue plasma energy around itself that then reacts with subatomic particles of their universes own space-time in order to generate a very large quantity of electricity. The Vortex like Cyclone of light glowing blue plasma energy had ignited on fire two years earlier shortly after the first malfunction, the flame was small and initially was nothing, but the flame had grown steadily bigger and hotter ever since. There was now a Vortex like Cyclone of Yellow hot fire swirling around and around the reactor core and continue to get hotter. \"Oh my God!\" said Aurora in a tone of both awe, fear, and despair. \"How are we going to fix this!?\" \"We need to expose the Reactor Core chamber to the vacuum of space.\" said Jim in answer to her question. Jim looked around the room, and then he saw the reactor control room computer core. It had taken a direct hit from the meteorite. Jim quickly did some fast math and Science in his brain as he looked at this type of damage on a primary computer core especially connected directly into the ship's power reactor. This is what had been causing the chain reaction of system malfunctions. If he could fix this then it would rehabilitate the primary systems by 100%, permanently. He examined with his hands over the damaged module. All he needed to do was pull it out and then put a fresh one in. Just the thing is the damaged one was still doing its job, more or less, to pull it out would cause a complete shutdown of all systems. That would make things worse exponentially. Meaning not that he shouldn't do it, but that he simply needed to do it quickly. \"We need to replace this computer module right here.\" said Jim. \"That's it?\" asked Aurora thinking that it couldn't possibly be that easy. \"That's it.\" said Jim with confidence and surety. \"So what do we do exactly?\" asked Aurora. \"We pull it out and put a new one in.\" said Jim. \"Are there replacement computer modules on board?\" asked Aurora. \"In the cargo hold.\" said Jim. They rushed out of the room. They made their way back to the elevator. They pressed the button for the cargo hold and the elevator took them there. Jim had scoured the cargo hold for months, and he knew relatively what to find and where to find it. They made their way half way down the cargo hold module of the ship, until Jim found in the darkness of their flashlights just what he was looking for. He opened up one of the containers and he found replacement computer parts. He examined each one as there were several different kinds. Not all of them are standardized. Each one was customized for a certain system. After some searching and examination he found the ones for the reactor room computer core. \"You know, for all of these redundant components you think they would have made a contingency on what a passenger's supposed to do if they come out of hibernation early.\" said Jim though he had mentioned this several times in exasperation. Even though he only needed one he grabbed two just in case. \"Alright we got what we need. Let's go.\" The ship continue to shake as more and more malfunctions begin to happen with the chain reaction of them. The ship's redundant systems were overloaded and way overworked. More and more of the Redundant systems began to shut down. Multiple systems weren't even working under the Redundant systems anymore. The Redundant systems attempted to prioritize the priority systems but the load was still too much and the Redundant systems were getting extremely tired as much as computer operating systems can get tired under processing for too long, or at least too much. They managed to get back to the engineering section just in time. As they got out of the elevator the elevator systems then failed permanently. That was close. They ran as fast as they could until they got back to the reactor control room. As hot as it was in the room before it looked like the temperature had increased by several degrees Celsius even more in the 41 minutes that they were gone. \"Alright Aurora,\" said Jim, \"you hold the good computer core module. I'm going to pull out the bad one and then all of the systems are going to go offline. We then immediately slap the fresh good computer module back in its place and all of the systems should come back online instantly.\" Aurora nodded. Jim then took hold of the damaged module and pulled it out. With a droning sound all of the systems went down but almost instantly the swirling Vortex of bright yellow flame inside the reactor grew even bigger and hotter as what little affect the Safety Systems containment unit was doing apparently was now gone. Jim took the fresh module from Aurora and slipped it into place. With a pleasant humming like sound the computer consoles and lights in the reactor control room came back online. The entire ship, the flashing red lights indicating that something was bad then went off and turned to the regular lights. On the bridge the computer consoles registered that the Redundant systems had relinquished control and all of the original primary systems were back online and operating at 100%. \"Reactor computer core restored.\" said the computer. \"All primary systems fully rehabilitated.\" The computer detecting the excessive amount of unstable flame inside the reactor. The computer activated the venting system where it exposes the reactor to the vacuum of space in order to extinguish the fire. But there was a malfunction that neither the primary systems nor the Redundant systems could compensate for. \"Attempting to expose reactor to vacuum of space.\" said the computer out loud. \"Auto venting system failed.\" \"But we fixed it!\" said Aurora in exasperation. \"Please attempt manual venting.\" said the computer. And a lever then appeared at one of the consoles. Jim then walked over to it and pulled at the lever. There was a venting shaft that was large enough for a grown man to walk through. It had two doors. An inner door, and an outer door, when the shaft vents the reactor, both doors are supposed to open. The manual switch had been able to open the inner door, but not the outer door by yet another malfunction. A large plunger like effect happened inside the reactor chamber, which was intended to restart the reactor. But unless the outer door opened and the reactor was able to vent, then the restart process was useless. \"What is going on?\" asked Aurora. The computer hearing the words that came out of Aurora's mouth gave her an answer on the screen on the wall. \"Outer door malfunction. Reactor unable to vent. Reactor temperature tolerance is reaching maximum entropy.\" \"What do we do?\" asked Aurora. Jim then touched a few buttons on the console searching for airlocks that were nearby to the venting shaft. \"I've got to go out there.\" said Jim. \"No Jim,\" said Aurora, \"it's too dangerous.\" \"I think I can handle it. We've got to do this.\" They left the reactor control room and made their way towards the nearest airlock that was closest to the reactor venting shaft. When they got to the airlock he quickly suited up into a space suit. He put on the space helmet. He then reached into a supply cupboard and pulled out an earpiece and gave it to Aurora. \"So that we can stay in contact.\" said Jim. And then he gave Aurora Gus's ID band. \"Hang on to this until I get back.\" said Jim. \"Wait,\" said Aurora, \"what if the reactor vents in your face?\" He thought about that for a second, the space suits were designed to protect them from anything short of a low-yield explosion. The venting of the reactor just might be the equivalent of a low-yield explosion. He grabbed the plasma torch from the toolbox and then he grabbed hold of one of the Vault-like doors that was smaller than his body and he cut it right off of its hinges. He then held it like an arm Shield. \"It ought to be good for something.\" He took a few of his tools with him that he thought he would need for mechanical stuff in space. He then left the antechamber to go into the airlock where he then heard Aurora's voice. \"Jim.\" said Aurora in desperation and urgency. \"Come back to me. I can't live the rest of my life on the ship without you.\" \"I will.\" Jim promised. The inner door then closed and Jim lifted the safety switch and pressed the red button which opened the outer door, the atmosphere inside the airlock was evacuated into space while his magnetic boots held him in place. He walked outside, after a few steps of going past the outer door of the airlock a line came out of the side of the wall and connected to a suit. \"Tether attached.\" said the computer. Following the ship schematics that he had memorized he made his way in the direction of the reactor venting shaft. Aurora then made her way back to the reactor control room. When she entered she was hit by a blast of hot air. The reactor control room was like an oven. The air was still tolerable but just barely. She was sweating bullets in seconds and quickly her clothing was drenched in sweat. She went over to the manual venting switch and when she placed her hand on it she quickly pulled it away as the handle was so hot that it burned her. Not enough to scold her skin for the fraction of a second that she had touched it, but had she held onto it for too long the skin of the palm of her hand would look like it had a really bad sunburn. \"Reactor temperature has reached its maximum limit.\" warned the computer. The protective glass between the control room and the reactor chamber began to crack and the cracks begin to grow. \"Jim, are you almost there?\" said Aurora getting impatient, not that Jim is being slow, but just that she was realizing they were running out of time. \"I've reached the venting chamber.\" said Jim through the comm. Jim's tether then disconnected from a suit and then I nearby tether connected. \"Range of tether exceeding limit reconnecting tether.\" said the computer. He then made his way down the venting shaft until he got to the outer door. He pressed a few buttons that were supposed to make the door open, but the little screen said that there was a malfunction. \"The outer door still won't open, I'm going to attempt a manual bypass.\" He took his multi adaptable screwdriver and inserted it into the manual override and twisted 90 degrees counter clockwise. And the outer door opened. Once it was open he released his hand but then the screwdriver twisted back to its original position and the door closed. Jim then tried it again. Again the door opened when he twisted the screwdriver but when he released his hand from it it twisted back and the door closed again. \"Aurora.\" said Jim. \"Something's gone wrong. The door will open but it won't stay open, unless I hold it open.\" said Jim understanding the inevitability of the situation. \"You're going to hold the door open while it vents?\" said Aurora with disbelief and panic. Jim activated his magnetic boots which held him in place while he then Twisted the screwdriver holding the door open and held his makeshift arm shield in front of him to protect him from the blast. \"It's the only way Aurora.\" said Jim with determination in his voice. \"Vent the reactor.\" \"No Jim!\" she said with desperation and despair. \"You have to.\" said Jim. \"I can't!\" said Aurora now crying. \"If I do it will kill you!\" \"Reactor temperature critical. Reactor meltdown imminent.\" warned the computer. \"Aurora. You have to or else the ship will be destroyed.\" \"Then let it be destroyed!\" said Aurora. \"I can't live without you! If you go, I go!\" \"Aurora.\" Jim urged her. \"There are five thousand people on this ship. And they'll have a chance to make it to Homestead 2. Do it for them Aurora.\" Aurora thought. Tears streaming down her eyes as she cried with despair. Jim was her other half. She loved him. She may have shunned him ever since her birthday but that wasn't because she stopped loving him, just because she was mad at him about finding out the truth. She felt that she had wasted what little time they had. And now she wanted that time back. But she knew that she had to save the sleeping passengers. Taking off her outer shirt and using it to protect her hand from the heat of the handle, she hesitated for way too long. And then she pulled the switch. The inner door opened and the vacuum of space rushed into the reactor chamber while the atmosphere inside the reactor chamber rushed out through the tube. Jim was hit by an extreme force of fire and pressure. He groaned at the force of the pressure against him. He leaned into it holding his makeshift arm shield in front of him. While at the same time keeping a firm grip on the twisted screwdriver. He needed to hold the outer door open for as long as possible. It took 9 long slow seconds for the inside of the reactor chamber to completely decompress in the vacuum of space. And on the last second Jim's hand and his magnetic boots lost their grip and he was blown out into space. Jim's tether reached its maximum limit and yanked on it so hard that it snapped. Meanwhile inside the reactor room, the ship's redundant systems were able to do their job without being overtaxed at all and immediately reinitialized the reactor and again it was swirling with the vortex like cyclone of glowing blue plasma energy. \"Reactor Core stable.\" the computer reported the good news. Outside of the ship Jim was moving with the momentum of relative motion in space towards the ion drive. Combined with the ship's Shield anything that passes through would be completely disintegrated. \"You think they would have installed into these space-suits directional accelerant thrusters.\" thought Jim in a panic. He then threw his makeshift arm Shield towards the Ion Drive, the force of the movement propelled him away in another direction, albeit slowly. \"Aurora?\" said Jim over the Comm. \"Jim!\" said Aurora in extreme relief. \"You did it! You did it, you can come back in now.\" \"Yeah, problem there.\" said Jim. \"My tether broke. I'm tumbling out into space.\" \"I'll come and get you.\" said Aurora as she sprinted towards the airlock chamber. Please review![Chapter 21] Chapter 21 Day 732 Aurora sprinted to the airlock. But she could still here Jim's voice in Her earpiece. \"I'm not going to make it.\" said Jim. \"My suit is breached. I'm leaking atmosphere, slowly, but it won't last long.\" \"Just hang on Jim,\" said Aurora, \"I'm coming.\" As Jim's space suit atmosphere became thinner the temperature inside became colder. It soon felt like a meat locker inside of this suit. \"I wish that we could both still be in hibernation right now.\" said Jim. He was feeling like he needed to say his last words. Words that you don't usually say unless you're on your deathbed. \"I would have built you a house.\" said Jim. \"I would have read your book...Aurora...I...love...you…\" And then he lost consciousness. Aurora had made it to the airlock. She hit the button that had the space suit open up like an eggshell. She stepped inside of it. And it closed over her arms legs and torso. She secured the space helmet on the neck piece. And then she stepped into the airlock. The inner door closed and she lifted the safety switch and press the red button. The outer door opened and the atmosphere inside the airlock was evacuated into space. Her magnetic boots held her in place. She stepped out. The robotic cable sneaked out and connected to her suit. \"Tether attached.\" said the computer. \"Locate Jim Preston.\" Aurora ordered. The holographic display inside her space helmet then locked on to Jim floating out amongst the stars. She deactivated her magnetic boots and kicked off in his direction. Should floated towards him. Her aim in his direction when she get kicked off was good, otherwise she would have floated off in the wrong direction. She got closer and closer to him. She was excited with anticipation. She was just about to reach him when...her tether reached its limit. \"No!\" Aurora screamed in denial. She then start the cry knowing that it was hopeless as Jim continued to float away and she had no way to get closer to him. And then a couple seconds later her excitement grew again as she saw Jim's severed tether swing around towards her. She grabbed hold of it. She pulled him in. And she held him tight when she got hold of him. She could see his space helmet frosting up, as well as a few cracks on it. She hit the retractor button on the panel on her side of her arm. The ship then begin to ravel in her tether until she got to the outer airlock. Jim suits still had a little atmosphere inside because the suits stored Air Supply was backfilling, but that was only slowing the decompression not stopping it completely. She pressed the button that opened the outer door and she stepped back inside. She hit the button that then closed the door. And the airlock repressurized. She wasted no time in getting his space helmet off. She dragged him inside the antechamber where she then got his space suit off with a great deal of difficulty. She removed her own space suit, and then, with tremendous strength for a young girl, she slung the heavy grown man over her shoulder and hobbled slowly through the engineering section with the burden of the weight on her shoulders. It was more than 6 minutes of very slowly carrying a heavy weight through the engineering section of the ship until she got to the elevator. She then hit the button for the command ring. Impatient at the short elevator ride to the command ring, she exited the elevator and then dragged him from under the armpits into the Infirmary under the weight caused by the centripetal rotation. She heaved with her arms and back and legs under his armpits to lift him into the autodoc. She straightened him out on his back, the autodoc closed, and then it swept over him with multiple laser scanners. \"The patient is dead.\" said the computer \"Then resuscitate him!\" she screamed at the computer. \"Resuscitation is not recommended without an attending physician.\" said the computer. She gritted her teeth and slammed her fist down on the table in frustration. But then she remembered Gus's ID band. She pulled it out of her pocket and swept it in front of the console and then it beeped in detection of the ID band. The computer then thinking that she was Gus listened to the words that came out of her mouth. \"Override on my authority.\" said Aurora. But she then paused as her short-term memory couldn't immediately remember the 4 digit code, but when she closed her eyes and thought real hard she then retraced her steps and listened to Gus in her mind as he had said the code at the time. \"2317, ID 2317!\" she rushed out in impatience. A number of medical selections then came up on the screen. She then hit the button that said 'resuscitation' where it then gave several different methods of resuscitation. Not knowing which one would actually save him she decided to try all of them, though at the same time she wondered if using all of them at once would kill him. The computer then warned her, \"Multiple resuscitation procedures are not recommended.\" \"Then do it anyway!\" she screamed at the computer. The autodoc then injected Jim with multiple syringes as well as injecting his heart with adrenaline, as well as defibrillating his heart with electricity while performing CPR. When it was done, his heart was beating again and he started breathing. With tears of joy she open the autodoc and climbed on top of him and just held him. She just held on for dear life! \"Aurora.\" he said with a quiet scratching voice. \"Jim!\" she said with joy. \"Is the ship out of danger?\" \"Yes.\" said Aurora. \"The fire in the reactor is gone and all of the primary systems have been fully restored.\" \"When I'm feeling up to it, I'm going to do an inspection just to make sure.\" \"You do that.\" said Aurora with a smile and then she kissed him. Day 741 \"Journal entry, Aurora Lane.\" Aurora voice typed into her holographic notepad. \"We have fixed the problem. According to the diagnostic station in the Bridge all systems are fully restored and there have been no further malfunctions. The ship is undergoing a self-repair function. All of the janitorial robot are cleaning up everything and fixing whatever they can. Unless another meteorite gets through the ship's Shields, there won't be any more problems until we reach Homestead 2. Me and Jim are back together. And a relief to me. To forgive someone really makes you feel better. Not that I consider myself an unforgiving person before, I was just mad at him. The things we do to hurt ourselves only we don't know it. End entry.\" Jim was still a little weak, but he was able to walk. It was using Gus's ID to look through the functions on the autodoc. Apparently when it was in 'command mode' overwriting all medical safety procedures it had a number of interesting functions. He wasn't sure what to do with them, but he just had a feeling that he needed to look through and see what all functions do, maybe one of them would be worth something one day. And then when he was scrolling through the different functions, he found one. It was just a title, 'Stabilize and Suspend'. He then inquired to the computer what exactly that does. They placed Gus's body in the airlock. They said a few words of respect, they looked up his profile and said a few things about his life. He had been born hundreds of years earlier as he had been in suspended animation for much of that time. They said a respectful goodbye to his life and then they jettisoned his body into outer space in the form of the respectful space funeral. Once that was over Jim turns to Aurora. \"I have something to show you.\" said Jim. Please review![Chapter 22] Chapter 22 Day 741 They walked the short distance to the infirmary. \"What are we doing here?\" asked Aurora. \"I have some good news for you about me waking you up.\" said Jim. Aurora was intrigued but still curious. Jim then waved Gus's ID band over the screen by the autodoc and detecting the ID band. \"No physician is present.\" said Jim. \"Override of my authority, ID 2317. Command mode selections then appeared on the screen and he started to scroll through them until he found 'stabilize and suspend'. \"In command mode there is a function called 'stabilize and suspend'.\" said Jim to Aurora. \"What it does is it puts the person into a state called 'Medical Stasis'. It stops all metabolic activity. The function is intended for terminally ill patients that are close to death that need to be kept alive for a while. It's a little different scientifically and medically, but it's essentially nearly the same as hibernation. You can go back to sleep.\" \"I can go back to sleep?\" Aurora thought inside her head. But suddenly the idea didn't appeal to her anymore. She had resigned herself to the inevitable that she was going to spend the rest of her life on the ship with Jim. She was happy about that. But now she's being given a chance to give up to have her old life back. Before she forgave him she would have leapt at that chance, but now she didn't want to do it...at least not without Jim. \"But there's only one autodoc.\" said Aurora. \"Unfortunately.\" said Jim. \"And you are going to lie down in it. And you are going to go back to sleep. You are going to make it to Homestead 2, And you are going to write your book. And you're going to finish your journey that you started out with.\" \"But what about you?\" asked Aurora. \"You'll be right back where you started. You'll be all alone.\" \"It will be different now. I have a better handle on it.\" \"I need time to think about this.\" said Aurora. She stepped out of the room and went back to her cabin. Day 748 She avoided Jim for another week. Constantly going over the pros and cons of going back into hibernation. If she woke up in 90 years, then Jim would be dead and she would never see him again. In her whole life on Earth she never found a man to love. Not that she didn't have options, but rather she just never allowed herself to fall in love. She had had a few boyfriends that she had been close to, but in the end she always left them because she had been holding out for someone better. It turns out that it took the scenario of being the 'last man and woman on Earth' for her to fall in love. But now that she had Jim, she didn't want to give him up. After the week of solitude which Jim had respected, Aurora went looking for him to tell him her answer of what she was going to do with the option of going back to sleep. Day 749 Jim was sitting in the pub. Arthur was polishing a glass as always. He had reconnected Arthur's artificial intelligence chip in his circuit board and he came back online with apparently no problems. The synthetic rubber like skin that his face was made out of had been severely damaged, but Aurora had fixed him up. He looked all right though he could be better. Jim was drinking a glass of water while turning over and over in his hands the makeshift gold and silver wedding band that he had made himself. \"Tuesday is my day with Arthur.\" said Aurora. Aurora walked into the room, all dressed up and smiling. \"Then may I join you.\" said Jim. \"Absolutely.\" said Aurora. \"Arthur you are looking lovely.\" \"Thanks to you.\" said Arthur. \"Aurora I'm just going to say this straight out,\" he then presented the ring to her, \"will you marry me?\" She presented her finger for him to put it on her and he did. \"Took you long enough to ask.\" said Aurora in joking reprimand with a smile. She and Jim then kissed. \"Champagne?\" said Arthur as he presented two flute glasses filled with sparkling white wine. They had Arthur perform the ceremony. The two of them had never been happier. They were ready to spend the rest of their lives together as their wedding bands symbolized and their wedding vows had declared. They were in the swimming pool. They both dove into the water. They swam to the transparent domed wall at the end of the pool where the passengers could look out at the stars through the water while they are swimming. While still paddling their feet lightly to keep their heads above water they put their arms around each other as they looked out at the stars and then kissed briefly. \"Hell of a life.\" said Aurora in a statement of fact. \"Hell of a life.\" Jim agreed. They had each other. They had a luxury cruise ship all to themselves. They didn't have to work. They didn't have to pay rent. They had each other's love and physical affection with all of the essentials of living and more provided for them. They could see their future. Right there on the ship. But yet who knows what it might hold. 17 years later Earth City of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada In an office building owned by the Homestead Company, with rows and rows of cubicles where telephone operators in front of their computers were taking calls and answering questions for Homestead Company customers. One employee received an incoming transmission in the form of a video message from deep space. This was common they received thousands of them all the time. The message completed its upload from the deep space laser array transmission, and then the operator hit play. The face of a Caucasian man with brown hair appeared and started speaking, \"Hi, I'm Jim Preston. I am a passenger aboard the Avalon. And...I'm not quite sure what to say...I think my hibernation pod malfunctioned. I understand that that's not supposed to happen, but I'm the only one awake and everyone else is asleep and the thing is the ship still has 90 years to go before it reaches Homestead 2, and...I don't know maybe it this is all my fault...maybe I missed something...I could just really use some help right now. Thank you.\" The customer service operator sat there at his desk in utter shock. He wasn't even sure if he could believe it. This was just so far-fetched scenario, it conflicted with one's ingrained beliefs. The ingrained belief now being that hibernation pods cannot malfunction. He pressed a button for the staff support line. \"I need someone from Tech Support please.\" It was company policy to investigate the matter. They traced the transmission, and determined that it had come from deep space in the direction of Homestead 2 along the course that the Starship Avalon was supposed to be taking. They looked up the profile of the passenger, Jim Preston. They did find a James Preston who seemed to fit the physical appearance of the person in the video. They contacted some of his former friends who were all 49 years older after the Avalon had left Earth, some of them could scarcely remember what they ate the day before, let alone a friend from 49 years earlier. But they confirmed that it was no hoax, it was no elaborate joke. Now to determine a hibernation pod malfunction which was supposed to be impossible. They went over everything that they knew about hibernation pods. The tech experts said that merely the hibernation pods weren't supposed to malfunction not that they strictly couldn't malfunction. They of course went over several different hypothetical scenarios that would cause a hibernation pod to malfunction, short of deliberate sabotage. Further examination of the details including coming up with the situation that Gym Preston would be in, if a person did wake up prematurely because of a hibernation pod malfunction they would be stuck on the ship with no way to get back into hibernation or have any solution to their problem. Some of the people in charge at the homestead company we're embarrassed at the idea of how they could miss something like this. Failure of imagination. They were so religiously believing that it was impossible. Thing never thought it would happen. They received several messages from the Starship Avalon over the next few decades. The second message appeared about five years after the first. It was a report from Jim Preston and Aurora Lane explaining what had happened and interestingly the breach in the ship's Shields with a small meteorite. They explain about all the malfunctions and the problems but fortunately they had fixed it. Jim Preston expressed his disappointment and customer complaint to the Homestead Company on the lack of a contingency protocol of want a passenger is supposed to do if they wake up early. Though he was slightly sympathetic and understanding that the intent was that it was never supposed to happen to begin with, but none the less. But Titanic wasn't supposed to sink but yet they should have still had enough lifeboats for everyone. After that, new security and safety protocols were implemented into Starships including a means to put a person into hibernation while on the ship without medical staff, still hoping that Jim Preston's pod malfunction was an isolated incident that would never happen again, they had to protect the future customers that it might happen to. Though of course it would take centuries to implement this to all of the interstellar starships that were still on route. February 4th, 3039 The Starship Avalon was entering the Bhakti system. It began a standard braking procedure to slow its velocity to be able to come into a stable orbit around the colony world of Homestead 2. The Planet was green with forests and mountians, rivers, lakes, and salt water oceans. It had a population of several million, and society was thriving. The mined minerals out of the ground, grew crops, farmed domestic animals, and built lots of houses, all while enjoying everything they would on Earth, shopping malls, hiking trails, and a verity of recreational facilities. All while giving a small percentile of everything they have to the Homestead Company. The Avalon. With a velocity of half the speed of light it would take several months for the ship's breaking to sufficiently take effect. The ship was on course for an orbital Shipyard in high orbit over Homestead 2, the shipyard was similar to the one that was in orbit of Earth's moon, mining raw materials from a significantly smaller asteroid, only 1 billion tons, but enough for the shipyard to work with. The shipyard was also an orbital Space Dock for incoming Starships. At present there were several luxury liners that we're docked there some of them almost ready to head out, some that would be under maintenance for a while, and a few only half built under construction. The Avalon was not the only ship that goes from Earth to Homestead two. Along the same course there were several ships that were a few years and decades ahead of the Avalon, while also at present there were several ships that were few years and decades behind the Avalon. The ship's navigational system detected the close proximity of Homestead 2, the ship autopilot initiated the automatic reanimation process of the ship's crew. Captain Norris felt consciousness as his body felt semi paralyzed. A holographic face appeared in front of him. \"Good Morning Captain Norris. How are you feeling?\" \"I'm tired.\" said the Captain. \"You're experiencing post hibernation sickness, it will pass. The ship is on Final Approach.\" \"Thank you.\" said Captain Norris as he felt a little bit more awake as each passing second. \"Let's check your vitals.\" He noticed that throughout the room there were several other hibernation pods that had the same holographic face in front of them waking up the crew. Of course not every member of the crew woke up simultaneously. It was just the senior staff on the first day and then on the second day the lower-ranking officers, and then on the third day the rest of them. Then they wait a month before waking up the passengers. The giant laser scanner had swept over his body there was an approving chime. \"You are in perfect health, Captain Norris. Please proceed to your cabin where you can get some rest.\" Captain Norris and the rest of the senior staff made their way groggily towards the crew quarters. When they got there they went to sleep. The next morning, when Captain Norris was well-rested and wide awake, Captain Norris went to the bridge to check on the main systems, which was standard procedure for his standard duties, when he noticed an interesting anomaly. There was some damage around the doors and the consoles. Damage that doesn't affect anything, it seems like scorch marks as though someone tried to cut through it with a welding torch. Though the metal was made of a specially synthesized titanium/ platinum/carbon polymer which is virtually indestructible even to super hot melting temperatures. It would take specialized equipment to be able to cut through the security hatch protecting the bridge. Then he received a page over the Comm. \"Captain Norris, this is chief medical officer Barton, please come to the Infirmary, there's something that you need to see.\" When Captain Norris and many other members of the senior staff got to the infirmary, they found that the autodoc was occupied. The console registered that the autodoc was on the continuous sustained medical function of 'Stabilize and Suspend'. The occupant of the autodoc was an elderly woman. \"The autodoc is keeping her alive in Medical Stasis.\" said the chief medical officer. \"Where did she come from, Dr. Barton?\" asked Captain Norris. \"I came in here as my first act of Chief Medical Officer after waking up to check on my infirmary, and I found her here. A few things in here are out of place, and obviously something has happened here.\" Captain Norris looked closely at her. Her hair was long and gray, her skin was so wrinkled. She had to be at least 100 years old. \"What's her condition?\" asked Captain Norris. The chief medical officer pressed a few buttons on the console and it showed the state of her nervous system. \"She is near death.\" said the chief medical officer. \"99% from just old age. She'll be fine as long as she stays in Medical Stasis, but once we bring her out she may only have a few days, perhaps a week.\" \"Then let's let her die with dignity, wake her up and give her a stimulant to keep her aware and alert, I want to find out from her what's going on here.\" The chief medical officer pressed a few buttons where then the screen gave a reprimand beep saying that a person in 'Medical Stasis' cannot be reanimation without an attending physician. The chief medical officer waved his right wrist over the screen and it beeped detecting his ID Band. \"Computer, health and safety protocol has been acknowledged, a licensed doctor is present. Begin reanimation process for occupant in the autodoc, authorization, 'Chief Medical Officer', 'ID 3579'.\" The autodoc then began the reanimation process and a few moments later the elderly woman start to stir. The Captain then stood over her as the autodoc opened up. \"Ma'am, are you alright?\" The chief medical officer then took a syringe full of a very powerful stimulant and injected it into her arm. The elderly woman opened her eyes fully and then seemed to be fully awake quickly. The stimulant in question was not something recommended for anyone, but in her condition it might actually just get her heart to beat a little bit longer. \"I'm doing well, thank you.\" said the woman in a scratchy elderly voice. \"I'm Theodore Norris, Captain of the Avalon. What is your name?\" \"Aurora Lane.\" said the elderly woman. \"I'm a writer. And have I got a story to tell you!\" Captain Norris was directed by Aurora Lane to pick up a holographic notepad that was on the counter off to the side. The note on the notepad was titled, 'Journal Entries of Aurora Lane'. Aurora told him to read everything that was on the holographic notepad, it was a 3000 page book. Her greatest work. But for him not to read the first page until he took a look at the Grand Concourse first. The Captain and several of the other officers went to the elevator while the chief medical officer gave Aurora Lane a full checkup. He believed that there might be some procedures available that could extend her life by another year. \"Please buckle up and secure any loose items.\" said the computer. \"This elevator will experience a momentary lapse in gravity.\" There was an elevator ride to the luxury module, and then they unbuckle their belts and exited the door of the elevator. \"Grand Concourse.\" said the computer as they walked into the giant shopping mall. Only when they walked in they were greeted by an unusual sight that they didn't imagine. The entire Grand Concourse had been transformed into a giant Park and garden. A giant tree in the middle that would have taken a century's growth. Plants and grass everywhere. There were animals consisting of mostly birds that clearly had been brought out of stasis from the cargo hold. The waiter robots from the restaurants were tending to the garden and caring for the animals. There was a little hut in the middle that looked quaint and cozy. The Fountains had been modified and rearranged to create little irrigation waterfalls everywhere. Okay, the Captain wanted some answers now. He opened up the holographic notepad and read the first page which was an 'intro' to the story. And the first page read, \"Dear passengers of the Avalon, \"My name is Aurora Lane. In the year 2949 there was the first ever hibernation malfunction of the passenger Jim Preston. He was alone for a long time until he woke me up to share his loneliness with him. I was mad at him in the beginning, but I eventually forgave him and fell in love with him. We were stuck on the ship with no way to get back into hibernation. The bartender Android Arthur once said to us that you can't get so hung up on where you would rather be that you forget to make the most of where you are, so Jim and I built ourselves a life! A beautiful life!...here is my story...\" The end Author's note: Hope you have enjoyed this novelized version of the movie 'Passengers'. Please excuse all the plot holes. Please send me a comment!

Part 1 of my story takes place right after the first move. Part 2 is a continuation of my story after Part 1! If you are confused, please read part 1 first! Eddie and I had had a rocky relationship thus far. After calling off our first engagement, Eddie came to my graduation trying to win me back. He did. Then we decided to spend half of the summer in Denmark and half of the summer at my parent's house. At the end of the summer, Eddie proposed to me again and I accepted. I just hoped that our relationship would truly become a happily ever after. The next day we promptly landed in Denmark and just as Harold, Eddie's father, had promised, I received an e-mail stating that I was approved for my student visa and that it would be arriving in the mail within the next week. Eddie and I walked off the plane hand in hand. I could feel a few eyes on us as the native Danes knew who we both were. Once we exited the terminal I saw Soren there to pick us up and take us back to the palace. \"Soren!\" I exclaimed and went to go hug him. \"Miss Paige! It is good to see you again,\" he said kind of smiling. I never really saw him smile. Strangely, there were not any reporters around. I breathed a sigh of relief. I hated how they would sometimes just follow us around all of the time. Our lives were not that interesting! We picked up our luggage and walked hand in hand back to the car. \"Soren, we have some special news,\" Eddie said as we started down the road. Eddie took my hand proudly. \"We are engaged to be married!\" he exclaimed. \"Yes, I did hear that from your mother. I am very happy for you both!\" he said trying to sound happy. \"Soren, what is the matter?\" Eddie asked. \"Your mother has called an emergency meeting with you as soon as you get home. I believe it is in regards to the engagement,\" Soren said calmly. \"Why can't she just be happy!?\" Eddie said getting angry. \"She didn't say what it was about,\" Soren said. \"I think we all know what it is about,\" Eddie said. \"She's upset that I am engaged to Paige and will do whatever she can to make sure it doesn't happen.\" \"Mostly likely,\" Soren said quietly. \"She doesn't scare me anymore,\" I said to Eddie. \"She do everything in her power to try to get rid of me but it's not going to work.\" I truly did not understand what Rosalind had against me. Ever since the very first day that she met me, she hated my guts. I never did anything to her so I truly didn't understand. It hurt since I always hoped when I was a teenager that I would have a good relationship with my mother in law. Obviously, that was not going to happen. We arrived at the palace and I got my bags out of the car. Eddie walked me to my room and we both sat down on the bed together. He took my hand and began to trace the lines of my palm with his index finger. \"We haven't even been here for an hour and she's already trying to break us up?\" I commented. \"Look, I want you to come with me. I'm going to present you as my fiance and she is going to have to deal with it.\" I smiled at him and gave him a quick kiss on the lips. \"Ready?\" he asked holding out his hand. \"Ready,\" I said taking it. We walked hand in hand together as we went to go face Rosalind. Chapter 2 We walked to Rosalind's study. Outside, Eddie knocked on the door and slowly opened it. \"Come in, Edvard. We need to talk,\" she said coldly. We walked in together and sat down in the chairs. My heart rate increased slightly. There were so many things going through my head and so many things that I wanted to say to her but I wouldn't dare vocalize them. \"What's she doing here?\" Rosalind snapped, motioning to me. \"Mother, Paige and I are engaged to be married. She has the right to be here for this conversation that you wanted to have with me.\" \"It's good to see you again,\" I said trying to smile even though I truly wanted to yell at her. Rosalind snorted and looked at me. \"Are you really going to stay this time or are you going to run away the moment that things get hard?\" She asked with her piercing eyes look at mine as though she was trying to see through me. \"I'm not going anywhere,\" I stated firmly. \"We'll see about that,\" she said turning her back on us. \"Mother, Paige is going to be my wife, the mother of my children one day, I demand that you treat her with the respect that she deserves,\" Eddie demanded. \"Okay,\" Rosalind said reluctantly and half-hardheartedly. Eddie and I left to go watch a movie together in his room. And we did actually watch the movie. I guess I fell asleep somewhere through it since I woke up with a note next to me from Eddie explaining that he had another meeting with his mother that he was told he had to attend. He said if I woke up in time, to come and crash it. Crashing it was exactly what I planned on doing. I was walking down the hallway of the palace trying to find Eddie and his mother. Part of me could not believe that I was back here. The other part of me could not believe that I was engaged to Eddie and I would be his wife one day. If we decided to stay in Denmark, I would be the woman next to him in his royal portrait. I would be his queen. The last concept made my head feel dizzy and it was hard to completely wrap my thoughts around it. \"EDVARD!\" I heard Rosalind's voice shriek, interrupting my thoughts. I followed the sound of her voice until I heard where the sounds were coming from. I quietly stood outside the door. It was opened partly. I wasn't sure if I should make my presence known now or not. \"Edvard, this is non-negotiable. You need to tell Paige that you made a mistake and call the engagement off before the news gets out to the press. I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter,\" she said sternly. My heart began to race. Rosalind was up to her old tricks again. \"I love Paige very much and she loves me. We are going to be married and spend the rest of our lives together,\" Eddie replied sternly as though this was non-negotiable. \"Edvard, I understand why you like Paige. She is a very attractive young woman and she has very nice qualities about her. However, you are the King of Denmark. It is your duty to marry someone of royal descent, someone who understands what is expected of them, and someone who understands this life style. Paige does not. She is a commoner and she does not belong here.\" \"Mother, Paige is staying and we will become husband and wife. Have I made myself clear?\" Eddie said. Rosalind laughed. \"I bet if you were to tell her that you were abdicating the throne; she would leave quicker than you could imagine. She doesn't love you, Edvard. She is only here for the fame and glory,\" Rosalind said as though it was a statement. \"Harold, what do you think of Paige? Don't you agree with me? The engagement has to be broken IMMEDIATELY.\" \"I haven't seen Paige yet from this visit. From her last visit, before the engagement was broke, I was very sick and I didn't spend that much time with Paige. But from what I have seen and heard, she seems to be a very lovely girl who seems to love our Edvard and Edvard loves her. If Edvard wishes to marry her, I can't think of any objections to this marriage,\" Harold said. Rosalind sighed and probably rolled her eyes. \"Edvard, as the King of Denmark, you have no choice but to call of the engagement and marry someone of royal descent. I heard there are several princesses and duchesses in England, France, Sweden, Norway, to just to name a few. You need to pick one of them to be your bride. I'm sorry about the pain this will cause you but it has to be done. For the sake of Denmark, you do not have a choice.\" \"If I cannot marry Paige, then I would abdicate the throne as king. If you don't believe me, try me. I will do it without any reservations or regrets,\" Eddie said sternly. Rosalind laughed. \"Where would you go live then?\" She asked sarcastically. \"The United States,\" Eddie stated. \"I wouldn't be opposed to it and neither would Paige. We just want to be together.\" \"You would not leave this life,\" Rosalind said and smirked. \"When would you like me to make the press statement explaining that I am leaving the throne? I'll do it now.\" \"You would not-\" Rosalind began. \"Soren, would you contact someone from Denmark Today? I can make a formal announcement in front of everyone,\" Eddie said cutting her off. Soren began to move as though he was going to do that but he also seemed very confused. \"Soren, don't call anyone,\" Rosalind said glaring at him. Soren stopped moving and went back to standing still. \"Soren, what do you think of Paige?\" Rosalind asked. \"Well...I actually think that Ms. Paige is a lovely girl. She is very smart, determined, and I think she and Edvard make a...cute couple,\" Soren said hesitantly. He knew that wasn't what Rosalind wanted to hear. \"I can't believe that no one else sees her for the power hungry, selfish American girl that she is. She is not any of the things that you all seem to believe that she is,\" Rosalind said angrily. I felt as though now would be a good time to make my presence known. \"You wanted to see me, Eddie? I got your note,\" I asked coming quietly. Rosalind's face changed to complete shock as she saw me come in the doorway. \"Everyone, I would like you to meet someone. This is Paige Morgan and she is my fiancé. We are going to be married soon and I expect everyone to treat her with the respect and dignity that she deserves. Have I made myself clear?\" Eddie said very sternly. \"Of course,\" Harold said. \"I wouldn't treat her any other way,\" Soren said. Rosalind was quiet. She didn't say anything and she just stared me up and down. Then, she stormed out of the room. Chapter 3 \"Well, that was a lovely conversation,\" Soren said trying to break the tension. We all laughed. I turned to Harold, Eddie's father. This was the first time that I had seen him since our previous engagement and at the time, he was gravely ill. \"I just wanted to thank you so much for everything that you did to help me get my student visa,\" I said walking over to him and then I briefly hugged him. It felt slightly awkward, but I felt as though I should do it. I was truly grateful to him for all that he did. \"I can't thank you enough,\" I said smiling at him. \"Anything for Edvard's lady. It's good to see you again,\" Harold said. \"It's good to see you again too,\" I said smiling. I wasn't really sure what else to say. \"Edvard, would you mind if I stole Paige for a stroll around the gardens this afternoon?\" Harold asked. \"I'd like to spend some time with her and get to know her better,\" he said. \"Yes, of course,\" Eddie said smiling. He seemed pleased that his father was really trying to make an effort with me and it wasn't because he was trying to sabotage our relationship. Eddie and I left hand in hand and we walked back to my room where we sat down on my bed to talk. \"I'm glad you came in when you did,\" Eddie said stroking my hair. \"I was wondering how much longer she was going to go on.\" \"Probably until she convinced you to break up with me,\" I said sighing. \"How much of the conversation did you hear?\" Eddie asked. \"I came in at the part where Rosalind said 'Edvard this is non negotiable...you must call of the engagement,'\" I said trying to mimic his mother. \"She said that a lot,\" Eddie said laughing. \"And I'm sure that isn't the last time we will be hearing it either,\" I said sighing again. \"Why does she hate me so much? What did I ever do to her?\" I asked turning to Eddie. Eddie hesitated for a second. \"I don't think she hates you-\" he started. \"Oh, she hates me alright. She's made that very clear,\" I said cutting him off. \"I'm not trying to justify her treatment or actions towards you; they're truly horrific but she doesn't see them that way. Mother is very traditional and she believes that since we came from two completely different backgrounds that we won't be able to truly have a successful relationship.\" \"But she has eyes! She can see that we truly care about each other and we aren't just getting married for the press and fame!\" I exclaimed. \"I know and I honestly just do not understand her. Maybe she's upset that I'm getting married and starting a family and I will be spending less time with her? I truly can't figure it out,\" he said shaking his head. Then Eddie got serious. \"Would you like me to leave the throne so we could try to live a normal life?\" Eddie asked. \"I feel horrible asking that of you,\" I said looking down. \"Yeah, it would be nice you were kind of destined to do this since birth,\" I said. \"I wasn't destined. The decision was made for me when I was their firstborn child,\" Eddie said. \"If that was what you really wanted, I'd do it without any reservation.\" \"I just want to be with you. And I don't care where that is,\" I said kissing him. \"So, should we just wait and see how things go?\" he asked. I nodded and kissed him again. I snuggled into his arms and rested my eyes. I needed to prepare some energy for my walk with Harold later and feeling like I'm about to fall asleep from jet lag probably wasn't a good way to talk a walk. The next thing I knew, I fell asleep in the arms of the man that I loved. Chapter 4 I woke up a few hours and practically jumped off of my bed when I saw that I slept through my walk time with Harold. \"Oh no,\" I said looking at the clock. Eddie chuckled. \"What's so funny? Your dad is going to hate me too!\" I exclaimed trying to put on some tennis shoes really fast and putting a little blush on my cheeks. \"I told him that you feel asleep. He said he would be ready whenever you were and not to wake you up,\" Eddie said smiling. \"See, he's seems to be so nice and understanding. Your mother would probably like my head if I slept through her walk together.\" Eddie laughed. \"That would solve her problem,\" he said laughing again. \"It sure would! You would be forced to marry someone of royal descent. Like the nice princesses in Sweden, France, Norway, England, etc,\" I said mimicking Rosalind's voice again. Eddie kept on laughing. I seemed to have really gotten his funny bone. \"Wish me luck,\" I said going over to him and giving him a quick kiss on the lips. \"My father will love you,\" he said kissing me back. \"I sure hope so!\" I exclaimed. I left and went to go face my future father in law. I was walking down the staircase and went into the sun room where I was supposed to meet Harold. He was there sitting down in a chair, reading the newspaper. \"I am so sorry,\" I said going over to him. \"I fell asleep and Eddie didn't wake me up-\" \"Don't worry about it,\" he said smiling at me. \"I needed to catch up on some of the gossip anyway. Did you know that you are pregnant?\" he said pointing to an article talking about my supposed baby bump. I laughed. \"Yes, the baby bump keeps on growing by the day too. At this rate, I'll have the biggest stomach ever!\" I said holding my shirt against my stomach to reveal how flat it was. Harold laughed. \"And apparently you and Edvard eloped in the United States,\" he said pointing to another article. \"Also, you are supposed to be hiding out in the US until you give birth,\" he said pointing to another article and getting up. \"Geez, what do these people do all day? Sit around and think of rumors about me? Don't they have a life!?\" I exclaimed. \"It never ends, Paige. That is something you will learn to get used to,\" he said. We went outside and we began our walk around the grounds. I was still slightly nervous. I guess I wanted to please him so much and I was so afraid that he would turn on me like Rosalind (although Rosalind never liked me). \"So, tell me how you and Edvard met,\" Harold asked as we slowly neared a garden. \"I've read 100 different stories in the newspaper and magazines but I want to hear the story first hand from you.\" \"Well, the very first time that I met Eddie was when I was working the bar in the student center. He was drunk, tried to hit on me, and asked me if I'd take off my shirt and I ended up spraying him with a hose of soda,\" I said smiling at the memory. \"I mean he was of course, harmless but at the time I didn't know if he was a rapist or something.\" \"How drunk was he?\" Harold asked. \"Pretty drunk,\" I said laughing. \"The next time we met was in our Shakespeare class that we had the next day. Eddie apologized to me for his behavior the previous night. I was still kind of cautious of him and I wasn't sure what to think of him, so I kind of kept my distance. Then, what really happened was he got a job in the student center with me. Working together was when we really bonded and then we just started doing almost everything together. We studied together, we hung out together with our group of friends, and we even did our laundry together. We were just friends though.\" \"So when did the whole friend thing change?\" Harold asked. \"I invited him home for Thanksgiving and on the Friday after Thanksgiving, he kissed me. It was understood from that moment on that we were boyfriend and girlfriend,\" I said smiling at the memory. \"How did he tell you about who he was?\" \"He didn't. I found out when we were being affectionate in a library and a bunch of people started taking our picture. We ran out of the library together and then he told me.\" \"How did you take it?\" \"I was actually angry at him for basically lying about who he was to me,\" I said. \"Now, I understand it but at the time, I didn't. I thought he was just playing with me and my feelings.\" \"And the rest of the story I believe I know about,\" Harold said smiling and I smiled back at him. \"So, Eddie tells me that you want to be a doctor,\" Harold said changing the topic. \"Yes, I do. It's always been my dream. That's why being able to start medical school this semester in Denmark means so much to me. Thank you so much again.\" We ended up spending the rest of our walk having a very pleasant conversation about my background and ambitions in life. I knew he was just trying to get to know me, but I was honestly sick of all of the questions. In his defense, it was as though he just met me since the last time I saw him, we all thought he was going to die. We ended our walk and he gave me a brief parting hug. \"Edvard is a very lucky man to have you as his bride,\" Harold said. \"Thank you,\" I said smiling. \"Eddie is such a lovely man. I can't imagine my life without him.\" We went our separate ways and I decided to enter back into the palace through the sunroom again. As soon as I opened the door, Rosalind was there to greet me.[Chapter 2] Chapter 4 \"Paige,\" Rosalind said as I walked in. \"Please, come sit down,\" she said. I cautiously came in and sat down. I already knew that this conversation wasn't going to end well. \"I suppose you are expecting me to congratulate you on your engagement to Edvard,\" she said staring at me. I didn't say anything or show any reaction. I knew what she wanted from me, and I wasn't going to give it to her. \"Well, you aren't going to be getting one from me,\" Rosalind continued once she saw that I wasn't going to say or react in anyway, \"because I would simply be congratulating you on successfully deceiving my son's heart and making him believe that what you have is real. There will not be any congratulating from me,\" she said coldly. Once again, I wasn't going to say anything to her. I wasn't going to give her what she wanted which was an argument and a reaction from me. \"Paige, I know you think that I don't like you, but you are a very nice girl. The truth is you and Edvard come from two different worlds. Let me make myself perfectly when I say this- Edvard will be marrying someone from royal descent and you will NOT become the next Queen of Denmark. Get that idea out of your head now! Do you still want to marry my son?\" She asked snidely. \"Yes,\" I said quietly and staring down at my hand. \"If Edvard gave all of this up, you would not still marry him,\" she said in a smart-ass way. \"Yes, I would,\" I said sternly. \"You seem to forget that Eddie and I fell in love with each other in a commoner setting. I had no idea who he was, and I loved him for it,\" I said. \"Paige, you are not going to marry Edvard,\" she said laughing. \"Rosalind, you seem to be forgetting something- that Eddie and are adults and we make our own decisions. You can't tell me or him what to do or who to marry,\" I said getting angry. \"No, but I will be sure to reveal your true self to Eddie before it is too late,\" Rosalind said with a smirk. \"Go ahead,\" I said calmly. \"He already knows everything about me,\" I said getting up to leave. I wasn't going to take this anymore. I wasn't going to put up with her abuse anymore and neither was Eddie. She felt as though she had the power to our futures when she didn't. Only Eddie and I had that power. There was nothing that she could say or do, that would change my mind from marrying Eddie and I know that he felt the same way about me. Chapter 5 \"You're mother really hates me,\" I said coming back into my room and finding Eddie sitting on my bed and watching TV. \"Uh-oh,\" he said looking alarmed. \"What happened now?\" \"After having a lovely walk with your father, she cornered me and gave me this big speech on how she wasn't going to congratulate me on the engagement, how I was deceiving you, and how we would not get married,\" I said sighing and sitting down next to him. \"Paige,\" Eddie said taking my hand. \"I will fight for you and defend for my entire life until I take my last breath. I'm going to try to talk to her...again,\" he said sighing. \"She has to treat you with respect and kindly. I demand it. She has no other option,\" Eddie said stroking my hair. \"Also, this came in the mail for you today,\" he said handing me a thick envelope. I eagerly opened it and found my student visa along with a bunch of pamphlets and instructions. Harold had really kept his promise. I was truly touched. \"My finance, the doctor,\" Eddie said giving me kiss on the cheek after showing him my student visa that had finally come in. \"I still can't believe it,\" I said looking at it. \"I guess this means I can officially turn in my paperwork to the University of Copenhagen!\" I exclaimed. \"You better get going! The offices close at 5!\" Eddie said beaming. I leaned over and kissed him. \"Thank you for always supporting me,\" I said smiling. \"I wouldn't have it any other way!\" He said still beaming. I smiled and I got all of my paperwork together to turn into the office of admissions at the University of Copenhagen. Chapter 80 I began my walk over to the University. The nice things about Europe was almost everything was within walkable distances. It was so different from the United States where you had to drive everywhere and walking there would have taken forever. \"Hi,\" I said walking into admissions. \"I was accepted and I know I contacted you guys about bringing in my paperwork once I got back to Denmark? I was the one who was having problems getting my student visa in time,\" I explained to the lady at the front desk. \"Yes, of course! I remember you! What is your name again?\" she asked. I breathed a sigh of relief that people did not recognize me right away. \"Paige Morgan,\" I said. Her eyes widen and so did her smiled. I hated people who became nicer to me once they found out who I was! Wait here just once second and I'll see if Dory is available to help you,\" she said smiling. She was a little too peppy now. I sat down and texted Eddie to let him know that I was in admissions to make things official. \"Paige Morgan,\" Dory said standing by the entrance to the hallway. I saw she already had my folder in her hands. I got up, smiled, and followed her back to her office. \"It's nice to see you again,\" she said smiling at me as I took a seat in her office. Once again, I hated the phonies. I remember how rude she was to be earlier this summer before she found out what my name was. Although, I played along with her game. \"It's nice to see you again too,\" I said smiling back at her. \"Can I see your paperwork that you brought here today?\" She asked. \"Yes,\" I said handing her my folder. \"Also, I have my student visa with me today too,\" I said handing that to her as well. \"Perfect!\" She said smiling. \"I'm going to go make copies of all of these and then I'll be right back,\" she said getting up and smiling. Everything that I had ever imagined was becoming a reality. It was amazing. I still couldn't believe it. The strangest part was having everyone know who I was and me having no idea who they were. \"Alright, Paige,\" she said coming back into her office, \"I just need you to come to the orientation for international students this coming Wednesday. Will you be able to come?\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"Great! Here is the schedule of the orientation. It shows you where to go and at what time,\" she said handing it to me. \"This packet includes your University e-mail address, as well as who your adviser is. I would go ahead and contact him or her and make an appointment so you can go ahead and register for classes. Other than that, it looks as though you are all set to go! Welcome to the University of Copenhagen! We are so happy to have you here!\" She said smiling and shaking my hand. \"It's a pleasure to be here,\" I said smiling back at her. \"Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help you!\" \"I will,\" I said smiling, getting up and leaving. I couldn't believe this was all official! I was going to be a medical student here at the University of Copenhagen! I was truly one step closer to accomplishing my dreams! Chapter 6 I spent sometime walking around the campus and finding the buildings that I would need to go for my orientation. I was feeling slightly overwhelmed at everything that I would have to do to get ready in such a short period of time, but I couldn't be more excited. I wandered from building to building, walking all around campus, and it wasn't long before someone tried to talk to me. \"Hallo!\" I heard a peppy voice behind me. I turned around, slightly disappointed that someone had found me. Then, I saw it was Sarah, the same girl who I had hung out with the last time I was here. \"Hey!\" I said smiling. \"I see you are back. Are you coming here next semester?\" she asked. \"Did everything work out?\" \"Yes,\" I said smiling. \"Everything did work out and I am officially a student!\" \"Listen, Ms. Morgan-\" \"Call me Paige,\" I said cutting her off. I hated that she was trying to be so formal with me. \"Paige, I'm so sorry about the last time that we met and all the shit I was saying about you. I honestly had no idea-\" \"It's fine,\" I said smiling. \"Don't worry about it. It was nice to be anonymous again.\" \"I felt really horrible once I found out-\" \"Don't worry about it,\" I said cutting her off again and smiling. She seemed to feel better. \"Let's start over. I'm Sarah,\" she said extending her hand. \"It's nice to meet you,\" I said shaking it. \"I'm Paige.\" We both looked at each other and laughed. \"It is weird having people know who you always are?\" she asked. \"You have no idea,\" I said. We began to walk around campus. Where we were going, I had no idea. \"I bet it would be,\" Sarah said trying to sympathize. \"It's going to take some getting used to which will probably take a while. So, are you a medical student too?\" I asked trying to take the focus off of me. \"No, I'm actually a graduate student. I'm studying in the law school. I did my undergraduate degree here too,\" she explained. \"Accounting sounds rough!\" I said smiling. \"Not as rough as being a studying to be a doctor,\" Sarah replied. \"Being doctor was the only thing I could ever see myself doing, even when I was little. I've always wanted to help people. I know the journey is going to be rough and difficult but in the end, it will be worth it!\" I exclaimed. \"Good for you. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I changed my major about three times in college,\" Sarah said. I smiled. \"I've always been like that, it's a flaw of mine. I always try to road map my life. It's was a hard thing to learn that I can't do that,\" I said. \"I've always been the polar opposite! I just live life!\" \"See, that is what I am trying to do more. Stop focusing on the future and more on the present,\" I said. \"Do you want to go get a coffee? I promise not to rude comments about the King's girlfriend this time,\" Sarah said jokingly. \"Deal,\" I said smiling. \"You know are nothing like the media portrays you to be,\" Sarah said trying to give me a compliment. \"I try to avoid the tabloid stuff. How do the reporters portray me? Or do I not want to know?\" I asked. \"Well, you are always pregnant,\" Sarah said. \"Yes, that I knew. I mean, it's pretty obvious, right?\" I said laughing. Sarah laughed too. \"They kind of portray you as, excuse my French, a bitch,\" Sarah stated frankly. \"Yeah, that honestly doesn't surprise me. I'm only here for Eddie's fortune and fame. I've heard that too,\" I said. \"They also make you sound very snobbish and full of yourself but you are the complete opposite. You're very down to earth and personable,\" Sarah said. \"Thanks,\" I said smiling. We had a great time having coffee together, talking about life, our hopes and ambitions, and simply just getting to know each other. I hoped that I would be able to call Sarah my friend sometime in the near future. Chapter 7 \"Hi,\" I said knocking on my adviser's office, Dr. Jensen. \"I'm Paige. I was the one who e-mailed you and we have an advising appointment now,\" I said standing outside his office. \"I've gotten a lot of those e-mails,\" he said not even looking up. \"Please, come in and have a seat.\" I walked in and sat down. I still couldn't believe that I would be starting medical school in less than two weeks! \"Alright- what is your name again?\" he asked looking up and looking through a stack of folders. \"Paige Morgan,\" I said. \"I'm an international student,\" I explained. \"Mmmhhhmmmm,\" he said looking through his folders. \"Here you are!\" He said pulling out my folder. \"Have you even thought about what classes you would be taking?\" he asked. \"Well, I was looking at what classes I needed to take and what was being offered, and I was thinking of taking Organic Chemistry, Foundations of Medical Science, Introduction to Clinical Medicine, Molecular Biology, Introduction to the Danish Language,\" I said. My adviser was taking notes and writing down what I said. \"Why Introduction to the Danish Language?\" he asked me looking up. \"Well, I think it would be a good idea to the study the language of Denmark,\" I said. \"As long as you are in Copenhagen, the majority of people speak English,\" he said. \"In fact, about 80% of Denmark speaks English. You shouldn't have any problems.\" \"I know, but I just really want to learn the language,\" I said. Also, I felt that, if Eddie stayed in Denmark, I would have to learn the language. I'm pretty sure Denmark never had a non-Danish speaking Queen. \"That is a quite a course load, but if you insist. I'll approve these classes for you to take. You should be able to register for these classes by tonight.\" \"Thanks,\" I said smiling. \"What country are you from again?\" he asked looking down at my folder. \"The US,\" I said. \"Are planning to spend all four years here or just this semester?\" he asked writing more notes on my folder. \"All four years,\" I said. \"What made you decide to come here to do your studies?\" he asked. I wasn't really sure how to answer that question. \"My boyfriend is from here, and I wanted to be able to spend some time with him here,\" I said. \"You're not going to have a lot of time to date being a medical student,\" he said. \"I know,\" I said. \"But at least it will be more time than if I was in the United States,\" I said smiling. \"Do you have any questions for me?' he asked. I shook my head. \"Alright, then you are all set to go,\" he said turning back to his desk. \"Thanks, Dr. Jensen,\" I said getting up and leaving. \"It was nice meeting you, Paige,\" he said. \"I look forward to working with you,\" he said looking up. \"Same here,\" I said smiling. I left his office and went to a computer lab so I could register for my classes. Then, I headed over to the bookstore to look at the books that I needed. I would try to buy them online first, but I wanted to at least get the titles and be able to look through them. Words could not describe how excited I was about beginning this new chapter in my life! Chapter 8 \"Is that Paige Morgan?\" I heard someone ask another person as I was flipping through the Organic Chemistry book. \"It looks like her,\" the other person responded. \"What is she doing her?\" Someone else asked. \"I heard she was coming her for medical school,\" someone else replied. \"Why would she need to go to medical school? She's dating the richest man in Denmark!\" Another exclaimed. I heard them to continue to gossip about me. I was truly trying to tune them out, but it was hard. I just wanted to look through my textbook! \"Leave her alone, guys,\" I heard a familiar voice say. It was Sarah's. \"She's not a monkey to ogle at; she's just like us.\" I breathed a sigh of relief. Maybe Sarah was someone that I could already consider to be my friend. I put the book down, turned my head and saw Sarah and the other group of people staring at me. It was so awkward. I didn't know what to do. Sarah came over to me. \"Just ignore them all. Sorry about that,\" she said. \"It's okay,\" I said smiling at her. \"Thanks for that,\" I said. \"You know her!\" Someone from the crowd of people yelled. \"Wanna get out of her?\" Sarah asked, ignoring the question. \"Yes!\" I exclaimed. We walked out together and I could feel a lot of eyes on us. It felt so strange, even more strange than before. We got to the door of the bookstore, only to see a swarm of paparazzi there. \"What the hell?\" Sarah asked. I couldn't believe it. They had found me here. Eddie and I were the big news story again even since Eddie got back to Denmark and it was discovered that I came back with him. I knew the paparazzi wasn't going to leave me or Eddie alone until we gave some answers but now wasn't the time for that. \"Just walk through the crowd, keep your head down, and don't answer any of their questions,\" I explained to her. I opened the door, walked out and braced myself for the worst. \"Paige Morgan! Are you and King Edvard engaged to be married?\" I heard one reporter yell at me as about one hundred cameras flashed in my face. \"Are you expecting his baby?\" I heard another yell amongst about a million questions. Finally, Sarah and I were able to get through the crowd but some of the reporters continued to follow us. I was so frustrated at this point. \"Let's go this way,\" Sarah said taking me by the arm and leading me away from the reporters. I followed her as we ran into the basement entrance of a building. The door was slightly off to the side and the reporters to seemed to have missed it. We walked and went into an open classroom where we sat down to wait a few minutes until the reporters left. \"Is it always like that!?\" Sarah asked. \"Not usually that bad. They only becoming harassing when they want some answers from us,\" I explained to her. She nodded sympathetically. \"That was just insane,\" she said. \"Tell me about it. They act like our lives are so interesting when I am sure they could find someone with a much more interesting life than me and Eddie,\" I said. \"It's because he is the King and you're dating him. So, they want to know everything about you,\" she said. \"I wish they would just leave me alone,\" I said. Sarah's eyes wandered over to my hand where she saw my engagement ring. Her eye's widened. \"We haven't made the formal announcement yet,\" I said. \"You have to promise me that you'll keep it a secret. You're the only one who knows about this,\" I said. \"Of course! I promise! I won't tell a soul!\" She exclaimed. \"Congratulations! I am very happy for you!\" She said coming over to give me a hug. \"Thanks,\" I said. It was hard being in this position. I did not know who I could trust or who I could not trust. I just hoped that Sarah was someone that I could trust. If the news about our engagement became public, I would know who to blame for it and who not to trust anymore.[Chapter 3] Chapter 8 I woke up the next morning with the major headline being me and Sarah trying to leave the bookstore. There was a picture me, looking like I was looking behind to see if I had lost the reporters. The picture was blown up so all you could see was my face. To the left of my picture, there was also a close up of my engagement ring on my finger. The article read: Paige Morgan, 23, was seen leaving the University of Copenhagen's bookstore yesterday afternoon along with an unknown friend. It had been rumored that Morgan came back to Denmark with King Edvard after their holiday in the United States, and due to her recent siting, those rumors are now confirmed as true. The new concept that has all of Denmark buzzing is the diamond ring that was found on Morgan's left hand on her ring finger. Could the couple that Denmark fell in love with be engaged to be married? The unknown friend of Morgan's refused to provide any identifying information along with if she knew anything about the ring on Morgan's finger. The press is dedicated to getting down to this mystery. I sighed and put down the newspaper and looked at Eddie. \"Can the press just leave us alone for five whole minutes?\" I asked. \"No, the press will never leave us alone,\" Eddie said looking down at the article. \"Am I going to be followed around my reporters all day long when I go to school?\" I asked him concerned. \"No, I won't allow that. They have to know when to leave us alone,\" he assured me. \"Who is this friend that they are talking about?\" he asked. \"It's this girl that I met earlier this summer on campus. We ran into each other almost every time I'm on campus. She's American too. She's just super friendly and we really hit it off. Her name is Sarah,\" I explained. \"Does she know...\" he asked. \"She saw the ring on my finger. She figured it out without me saying anything. She promised she would keep it a secret until we made the official announcement,\" I said. \"You have to be careful about who you trust. Some people pretend to be your friend when they really just want to sell information about you to the press,\" Eddie explained. \"I know,\" I said. \"Although, I think Sarah is trustworthy. She could have sold you out to the press, but she didn't,\" Eddie said looking at the newspaper again. \"The reason I haven't made the official announcement yet is because I know that this will include TV interviews, magazine interviews, the press bothering us about details about the wedding, engagement photos...I didn't want to put that extra stress on you when you are starting medical school. I know how much you stress about those things,\" he said rubbing my hand. \"Thank you,\" I said leaning in to kiss him. \"But I guess the press would have found out sooner or later,\" he said after we broke apart. \"And I didn't want to ask you not to wear your ring and I wouldn't want you not to wear it. You have no idea how proud I am and how much joy it brings me to be able to call you my fiance, my future wife. I am the luckiest man alive,\" he said beaming at me. I didn't know what to say, so I just smiled and leaned in to kiss him passionately. \"And I am the luckiest woman in the world to be able to call you my finance, my future husband,\" I said in between kisses. \"I love you like this,\" Eddie said laying down next to me and stroking my hair. \"Love what?' I asked smiling at him. \"I love that you are just being Paige. The Paige that know so incredibly well. I love your natural look when you don't wear any make-up. You're so beautiful,\" he said stroking my cheek. \"I love you when you are just Eddie. The Eddie that I get to see,\" I said taking his hand and looking into his eyes. \"I love how loyal you are and how you love and care so deeply.\" He leaned and kissed me tenderly. \"I have to get going,\" Eddie said sadly as we broke apart. \"Parliament starts in about fifteen minutes.\" \"Do you have to go?\" I asked snuggling into his chest. \"Unfortunately, I do,\" he said giving me a kiss on my head. \"Don't you have orientation you have to go to today?\" he asked leaving my bed. \"Yeah, in like an hour and a half,\" I replied. \"Well, how long does it go till?\" he asked. \"It says six o'clock on the schedule they gave me,\" I said. \"Well, I was hoping for a date tonight with you,\" Eddie replied. \"A date sounds lovely,\" I said. \"Then, it's set. Text me when you are done and I'll come and get you,\" he said giving me a kiss on the cheek and walking to the door. \"I'll see you tonight,\" he said. \"I'll see you tonight,\" I said smiling. \"Love you.\" \"Love you too,\" he said closing the door behind him. I laid down and sighed happily. Everything was going so well, almost too good to be true. The thing about time is that it is always continuing, always passing. It was moments like these where I wish I could use a pause button and stop time, but life wasn't like that. Time was passing whether I wanted it to or not. The other thing about life is that you never know what is coming your way. Little did I know that my entire world would come crashing down in just a few weeks.[Chapter 4] Chapter 10 Have you ever noticed that there is never the right amount of time? Time can either goes by too quickly or two slowly. There is never the perfect speed. This was how I was feeling about my first day of medical school. I couldn't believe how quickly the time had gone by nor could I believe how quickly this summer went or the fact that Eddie and I were engaged to be married again. \"How do you feel?\" Eddie asked as we got into the car. He wanted to drop me off for my first day of classes. \"Excited and nervous. What if being a doctor isn't cut out for me? What if I -\" Eddie silenced me with a kiss. \"You will be great a doctor one day, Paige. I have absolutely no doubt in my mind.\" I smiled at him. He could make me feel so much better about everything. Before I knew it, we were at the University (I mean it was technically within walking distance) and I kissed Eddie good-bye. I got out of the car and began to walk to my first class. I looked around and couldn't believe that this was truly happening. I mean, I was starting medical school today! Four more years and my dream would be accomplished! The reality of everything that was going on was truly hard to absorb up. By the end of the next four years, I would be married and a doctor. It was crazy! I got to my first class about fifteen minutes early. It was Organic Chemistry. I usually liked to sit in the front for my classes, but I didn't want to draw anymore attention to me that I already had, so I decided to sit in the middle. \"Hej! Hvordan har du det? Jeg er Jake,\" I guy said to me as he sat down next to me. \"Oh shit,\" I thought to myself and frantically pulled out my schedule to make sure that this class was going to be taught in English. The guy looked at my expectantly. I had no idea what to say. \"Ja,\" I smiling at him which meant \"yes.\" I hoped maybe that was the answer to his question. The guy burst out laughing and smiled at me. \"You obviously don't speak Danish. Do you speak English?\" He asked me. He had an American accent. \"Yes, I do,\" I said smiling. \"I working on the Danish,\" I said looking down at my desk pretty embarrassed. \"You're American too!\" He exclaimed. \"Yes, I'm from Wisconsin. You?\" \"I'm from Oklahoma,\" he replied. \"What's your name?\" he asked. \"Paige,\" I said extremely thankful he didn't know who I was. \"What's your name?\" \"Jake,\" he said. \"Nice to meet you,\" he said extending out his hand. \"Nice to meet you too,\" I said shaking it and gave him a smile. \"So, what kind of doctor do you want to be?\" he asked me trying to keep the conversation going. \"I'm thinking just a general doctor and specializing in hospital care. What about you?\" \"Surgeon,\" he replied right away. Our conversation was interrupted by the professor coming into the classroom and immediately starting the class. \"This is the one and only time that I am going to take role just to make sure that everyone is on the list that I have here,\" he said beginning. I waited patiently until my name was called and part of dreaded the moment too. It was the moment when everyone would recognize me and my name. Would I every really get used to this? I wanted to be just another name in the crowd and not a name that everyone knew along with details about my life. \"Paige Morgan,\" my professor called. I raised my hand up and he marked me as present. \"Paige Morgan as in the King's whore?\" someone in the back asked snidely. I could feel my cheeks turning red and I pretended to be looking at the syllabus. Seriously? Could people truly be so rude? \"I don't know what you're talking about but leave her alone guys,\" I heard Jake said. \"Seriously? You don't know-\" The girl began to say. \"Enough!\" My professor said sternly, cutting her off and continued to take roll. This was going to be such a fun class, I thought with dread as I began to mark some of the important assignment and test dates into my planner. \"Hey!\" I heard Jake yell to me. It was later in the day and I was in line to get some coffee at the Starbucks on campus. \"Hey,\" I said turning around. \"Hey, I don't mean to be too forward, but I was just wondering if you were okay? Ginger can be such a bitch sometimes-\" he began. \"Yeah, I'm fine,\" I said. \"I don't really care. I mean, not everyone is going to like me or accept me, and it's something that I have to learn to deal with and accept.\" \"Are you really the Paige that is dating the King?\" he asked hesitantly as though he was unsure of whether to ask me that or not. \"That's me,\" I said trying to lighten the tension. \"That's crazy!\" he exclaimed. \"What is?\" I asked. \"That possibly the future Queen of Denmark is in my Organic Chemistry class!\" He exclaimed. \"Well, you're from the United States so you understand what a complete foreign concept this is to me. I don't picture him as the King of the country. I never have and I don't think I ever will. He's just Eddie to me. I know his life isn't what we would consider to be normal, but I don't put him up on a higher pedestal than anyone else except he obviously does mean a lot to me.\" \"I completely understand,\" Jake said. \"I assume the whole situation is very strange,\" he said smiling. \"It is,\" I said smiling back at him. \"Well, anyway, I am going to go off to class. I just saw you here and just wanted to check that you were okay. I'll see you later,\" he said leaving. \"Bye,\" I said. Well, I could officially check off that my first class was a complete disaster and as well as my first day of medical school. I sighed, got my coffee, left the Starbucks and tried to find a place where I could just enjoy my coffee in peace. That task proved to be much harder than I ever expected. Chapter 11 \"How was your first day Paige?\" Eddie asked as he picked me up later that day. I leaned my head back against the head rest and just shot him a look with my eyes that explained it all. \"That bad, huh?\" he asked as we began to drive. \"I mean, it wasn't bad. It was just different,\" I began. I wasn't sure how to begin. \"How so?\" Eddie asked. He wasn't going to let me keep anything bottled up ever again. \"Well, everyone knows who I am. It's just so weird! And I guess the Danish people don't like me. I was called the 'King's whore' today. It just wasn't what I was expecting,\" I said looking at Eddie. \"It was just the first day. Maybe things will get better,\" he said gently, taking my hand and squeezing it. \"You know if this all becomes too much for you; you just have to say the word and we can pack up and move wherever you want us to,\" he said reassuringly. \"I know,\" I said rubbing his arm. \"Now, probably would not be the best time to let you know that we are schedule to go on Good Morning Denmark on Friday morning to publicly announce our engagement,\" Eddie said hesitantly. \"Great,\" I mumbled. \"Also, I just found out from Soren that a script has been written about our relationship, and they want to make it into a movie. Apparently, they have chosen the cast already, and they would like us to meet up with the main characters so they learn how to accurately portray us,\" Eddie said. \"You're kidding,\" I said surprised. \"Our lives aren't that interesting,\" I said. \"Well, apparently, we are much more interesting that we would ever think,\" Eddie said chuckling. \"Would that be something you would be willing to do?\" he asked. \"You don't have to if you don't want to.\" \"I don't mind meeting with the actors and actresses to talk to them. It's just weird that they want to make our lives into a movie. And then, people will be watching it. I just can't wrap my head around it,\" I explained. \"It's strange for me too,\" Eddie said. \"I wasn't expecting that people would want to do something like this,\" he said. \"I'm worried to see what movie will contain,\" I said. \"Me too,\" Eddie said. \"I guess we can try to coach the people playing our characters as best as we can and let them know that half of the stuff probably isn't true,\" I said laughing, putting my head down on his arm. I was so exhausted from today, but I was so happy to be able to spend time with Eddie. \"And I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but my mother wants to have dinner with both us tonight and just us,\" Eddie said. \"If every time you pick me up, you have such bad news, I may have to fire you,\" I said teasingly. \"How did Danish 101 go today? Are you fluent yet?\" he said teasing me too. \"Completely,\" I said going along with his joke and laughing. \"Let me hear something!\" He said laughing pretty hard. \" Tak ,\" I said looking at him smiling. \" Ja .\" Eddie burst out laughing and I was too. In fact, we were both laughing so hard that we were practically crying. I snuggled my head against his arm and looked up at him. \"I love this,\" I said. \"Love what?\" he asked. \"Me picking on your Danish?\" He asked smiling. \"No,\" I said hitting him playfully. \"I love it when we are alone and we are able to enjoy the moment like this.\" At the next red light, he leaned over and kissed me passionately. I wished all of our days could be like this, but since I was going to be the future Queen of Denmark, I would not have that luxury and it pained me so. Chapter 12 The funny thing about life is that you never know what is coming. I had never dreamed in a million years that I would be engaged to the King of Denmark, nor that I would be going to medical school at the University of Copenhagen. Life is funny like that. You never know what exactly is coming you way. I finished the homework and reading that was assigned to me from today, and I prepared myself for dinner tonight, both mentally and physically. I changed into a blouse, black skirts, and heels. I pulled my sides and bangs back with my hair and touch up my make-up. I wasn't sure why I was trying so hard. I mean, Rosalind already hated me. However, part of me really hoped that she would accept me and maybe, just maybe, that acceptance would start tonight if she saw I was truly trying to make an effort. Eddie knocked on my door at about 6:50 pm. We were supposed to meet his mother at 7 pm sharp, and she meant it. We walked arm in arm into the dining room where we would be eating tonight. My heart began to beat slightly faster as I saw Rosalind, and her scowling face. Eddie seemed to sense my nervousness, and he gave me a quick kiss on the cheek before pulling my chair out for me across from his mother. The table was small and circular. Eddie technically sat next to me, but he was also next to his mother. \"I suppose you told Paige about Good Morning Denmark on Friday?\" Rosalind asked Eddie. \"Yes, I have,\" Eddie said. \"I just hope we don't have another incident like last time,\" Rosalind said snidely and looking at me. \"Paige did a wonderful job last time! I will not allow you to criticize her all the time!\" Eddie exclaimed. \"She threw up three minutes before you guys went on stage,\" Rosalind snapped. \"The comments are going to stop, mother. And they are going to stop TODAY,\" Eddie snapped. \"Is that any way to talk to your mother?\" Rosalind snapped back. \"Is this any way to talk to my finance? The woman who will be bearing your grandchildren one day? The woman who will be my wife and a part of this family forever? She's staying whether you like it or not,\" Eddie said sternly. Rosalind was actually quiet for a few seconds and seemed to be pondering what Eddie just said. \"You're right, Edvard. I am truly sorry for my behavior and attitude toward Paige. Paige, my sincerest apologies,\" Rosalind said very sincerely. I turned to Eddie completed surprised. I wasn't sure whether to believe her or not. \"Thank you,\" Eddie said diplomatically. \"So, when were you guys planning on having the wedding?\" Rosalind asked us. \"I was hoping we could work some details out over dinner,\" Rosalind said looking at us as though she was truly interested. I looked at Eddie not knowing what to say. \"We...,\" Eddie said started. \"We haven't actually given it much thought,\" he finished. \"Well, you certainty must have some idea of when you would want to have the wedding!\" Rosalind exclaimed. \"We aren't actually sure if we are going to stay in Denmark,\" Eddie said hesitantly. We both awaited his mother's reaction. \"Well, I guess you both have to do what you feel is best,\" Rosalind said way too calmly. I looked at Eddie surprised. Why was she acting like this? \"We need to have some plans to tell the public when we announce your engagement on Friday. If you were to stay in Denmark, when would you want to have the wedding?\" Rosalind asked. \"Probably sometime in the summer,\" I said looking at Eddie and he nodded in agreement. \"So, Paige, you aren't planning on finishing medical school before you get married?\" Rosalind asked. \"No, I wouldn't want to wait that long. I really can't wait until we are married,\" I said. \"So, if you both plan to stay in Denmark, we can say probably either this summer or next summer,\" Rosalind said. \"Alright,\" I said. \"The next thing is- the proposal story. I really want to hear about the proposal and then you two need to decide what to tell the public. But please, tell me about it,\" Rosalind asked, acting as though she was truly interested. \"Well,\" I began, \"it was really cute. He asked my dad's permission for my hand in marriage. On the day of the actual proposal, we went out to dinner that night,\" I said smiling at the memory. \"And we played some miniature golf, got some ice cream, and then I took her to the same place where we had our first kiss and asked her to marry me there. It was the best nights of my life,\" Eddie finished, smiling at me. I giggled happily and put my arm through his and smiled at him. Eddie was looking down at me and smiling at me too. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a flash go off. I looked over at Rosalind, surprised. \"That was just too cute not take a picture of. I'm going to send it to both of you,\" she said showing it to us on her phone. She was right, the picture was very good. \"So,\" she said putting her phone down, \"what are you going to tell the public about your engagement?\" Rosalind asked. \"I was thinking that we went out on a romantic date and then I popped the question to her,\" Eddie said. \"No, that won't be good enough. People will think you proposed to her after you slept with her then,\" Rosalind said. \"The story will be that you both went out to dinner and then spent the rest of the evening in town together. Then, you took her to a romantic spot and asked her to marry you. That gives some details but not too many details,\" Rosalind said. \"Alright,\" I said. \"And it will be best if Paige tells the story on Friday. They won't think that she holding anything back,\" Rosalind continued. My stomach dropped a few inches when I thought about Friday. I made up my mind to be strong and try not to vomit beforehand this time. \"Okay,\" I said. \"You may get asked some questions about children. If you do decide to stay in Denmark, Paige, then you will be expected to have at least one child with Edvard to provide Denmark with an heir. Do you understand that?\" she asked looking at me. \"I understand,\" I said nodding. \"If they ask you about how many children you are going to want, what is going to be your response?\" Rosalind asked. \"Maybe two?\" I asked looking at Eddie. \"Yes, I would like about two or three,\" he said looking back at me intently. I think reality truly hit us both. We were no longer with each other for the summer trying to work things out. We were no longer just dating. We were no longer boyfriend and girlfriend. We were each other's finance. I would soon be his wife and he would be my husband. He would be my best friend, the father of my children, my supporter, and a part of my life until the day I died. He was the person who completed me. This was really happening. It was surreal. I could tell he was thinking the same things as me by the way he was looking at me and I was looking at him. \"Come here,\" he said whispered, gently cupping my chin and pulling my toward his lips to kiss him where he kissed me. I sensed the flash again and I figured that Rosalind took another picture. \"Oh,\" she exclaimed when we broke a apart, \"I am just so happy for both!\" I couldn't believe what my ears just heard. Did Rosalind, in her way, just finally congratulate us on the engagement? After the dinner, which was actually quite pleasant, Eddie walked me back up to my room. \"So, did you mother take some sort of medication or something?\" I asked taking my earrings out and putting them on my dresser. Eddie chuckled, laying down on my bed. \"I'm completely serious!\" I said walking over to my bed. \"I don't know,\" Eddie said chuckling as I laid down next to him, and took his hand. \"It was nice though.\" \"I just don't trust her. It seems fake,\" I said. \"I mean, she so adamantly hated me before. I can't believe she could go from hating me to loving me after you just simply told her that I wasn't going anywhere. You've told her that before and she just ignored it,\" I said. \"Well, maybe she's truly willing to change and accept you,\" Eddie said. \"I hope so. It's just going to take a while until I can trust her,\" I said. \"Just try to build a relationship with her while she willing to make one, please,\" Eddie asked me. \"Of course,\" I said. \"I've always wanted to have a good relationship with her even before I knew she hated my guts.\" \"She does not-\" Eddie started. \"Eddie, she hates me,\" I said with more emphasis on the words. \"Maybe tonight will be the turning point in your relationship,\" he suggested. \"Maybe,\" I said. He pulled me close to him and I snuggled my head in his chest and closed my eyes as he began to stroke my hair. I put my one arm around his waist and tried to pull him even close to me. \"I never knew that I could love someone so much,\" I said as I buried my head in his chest. I loved the cologne he was wearing today. \"Who are you talking about? My mother?\" Eddie asked jokingly and was laughing. I looked up and glared at him playfully. \"Of course! Who else would I be talking about?\" I asked teasingly and leaned forward and kissed him passionately. \"I never knew I could love someone as much as I love you either, Paige,\" Eddie said stroking my hair behind my ear and looking intently into my eyes. I rested my head on his shoulder as he continued to stroke my hair. \"I really need to get to bed since I have an 8am class tomorrow, but I don't want to leave your arms,\" I said as I intertwined my hand with his free hand. \"I don't want to leave either,\" Eddie said and he gently kissed the top of my head. \"Do you just want to sleep here tonight?\" I asked looking up at him. \"Just don't tell my mother,\" he whispered in my ear. \"Deal,\" I said giggling. I got up and showered as Eddie went down to his room to get his pajamas and a change of clothes for the morning. I was in bed reading as Eddie came out of the shower and walked over to my bed. \"You look so sexy,\" he said crawling into bed next to me. \"I'm wearing a T-shirt and sweatpants and I'm reading a book,\" I said laughing. \"You're beautiful and sexy no matter what you wear,\" he said leaning over to kiss me. \"Goodnight, Paige,\" Eddie said after we broke a apart. \"I love you so much.\" \"Good, Eddie,\" I said smiling at him. \"I love you too.\" We turned off our lamps and laid our heads down on our pillows. Eddie put his chest against my back and put his arms around my waist. He kissed my head and we fell asleep. I wished that nights would always be like this one. I wished that Eddie and I would be together forever. I wished that time would stop moving. I wished that Eddie knew exactly how much I truly loved him.[Chapter 5] Chapter 12 I went to class the next day expecting the worse, but honestly, everything went rather well. I was sitting in my Foundation of Medical Science big lecture when I got a text from Eddie. It read: I just wanted to say that I love you, and I hope you're having a great day! His text made me smile from ear to ear and feel all warm inside. I had the urge to kiss him, but I knew that would have to wait until later when I got back from school and he finished with Parliament. I had a break after my class until about 11:30am and I decided to go to Starbucks to get a coffee for a pick me up. I was not a morning person at all and these morning classes were rough! I was sitting at a table for two, sipping my coffee, and reading one of my textbooks for the next lecture when someone walked over to me. I looked up and saw Sarah and another girl. \"Hey!\" I exclaimed. \"Hey! How are things going? Can we join you?\" She asked. \"Of course,\" I said smiling. Sarah sat down at the chair across from me and her friend pulled a chair. \"This is my dear friend and roommate, Clara,\" Sarah said introducing me to her friend. \"It's nice to meet you,\" I said extending my hand. \"I'm Paige.\" \"It's nice to meet you as well,\" Clara said smiling, shaking my hand. \"How are classes going?\" Sarah asked. \"Pretty well! I'm enjoying everything so far,\" I said. \"Danish 470 is going to kick my butt, I can feel it already,\" Sarah said. \"Well, I'm going to need your help. I'm in 101 and the teacher just talks to us all in Danish and I have no idea what she is saying,\" I said. \"If you ever need help, just let me know. Learning a new language is hard!\" Sarah exclaimed. \"Tell me about it!\" I said. \"What languages do you speak?\" Clara asked trying to join the conversation. She seemed very quiet and nervous- the complete opposite of Sarah. \"I speak English and Spanish,\" I said. \"What about you?\" I asked. \"English, Danish and a little French,\" she said. \"I was born and raised here and I did my undergrad in the United States and I decided to come here to law school.\" \"I don't know how you guys do it. I could never get into law,\" I said sipping my coffee. \"I couldn't study science and biology as much as you!\" Sarah said chuckling. \"I guess we all have our strong points and weak points,\" Clara said sipping her coffee too. An advertisement for Good Morning Denmark came on the TV and it advertising that Eddie and I were going to be on it tomorrow to answer the burning question: where we engaged to be married? \"I hate the hype the give those two,\" Clara said looking at the TV. \"Tell me about it,\" I grumbled. \"They are always saying something about them. Or they are making rumors about them. I'm sure they just want to be treated as normal people,\" I said. Clara didn't know who I was and I was truly enjoying being anonymous. I knew Sarah knew who I was, but she wasn't saying anything and I wasn't going to either. \"Do you really think that they are engaged?\" Clara asked. Sarah and I looked at each other. Neither of us knew what to say. Sarah didn't want to betray my trust and I wasn't sure if I wanted to say who I was either. \"I mean, they've been dating for a long time. It wouldn't surprise me,\" I said. \"Yes, but Kate Middleton and Prince William from England dated for years before he finally asked her the question,\" Clara said. \"I guess we'll just have to wait and see,\" I said looking down at my coffee. My ring was shining in the sunlight that was hitting our table. I saw Clara's eyes look at my ring and then she looked at me. She did that about three times, and I could tell she was piecing it together. Sarah and I began to chat briefly about classes. \"You're Paige Morgan, aren't you?\" Clara asked suddenly. \"Yes, I am,\" I said nodding my head. \"And you're engaged to be married?\" Clara asked again pointing to my ring. \"Yes,\" I said nodding my head again. \"I'm sorry- it's just that it's nice to be anonymous again. It's so strange that whole country knows my name,\" I said. \"I don't blame you at all,\" Clara said. \"Have you guys already filmed your segment for tomorrow?\" Sarah asked. \"No, it's really live. I have to get up at 4:30am, be at the studio by 6am, and we're on air at 8:30am,\" I said. \"Are you nervous?\" Sarah asked. \"Terrified,\" I said feeling my stomach churn again. \"You'll do great,\" Sarah said patting my arm, trying to be encouraging. \"Thanks,\" I said smiling. We stayed and chatted for a while, laughing, and really enjoying each other's company. I was glad that Sarah had so welcomed me to Denmark. It was nice to have some female friends around who I could confide in. Chapter 13 It was Friday morning and I was already sitting in a chair in the studio of Good Morning Denmark. My stomach was in complete knots and I did not even eat breakfast this morning. I knew that whatever I ate would come right back up. I could feel my body starting to shake, I really did not want to do this. Cassandra, the hair and make-up stylist from last time I was on this show, was doing my hair and make-up again. She gently put her hand on my shoulder. \"You'll do great,\" she said encouragingly. \"Thanks,\" I said trying to smile. \"Just don't imagine the audience being there, just pretend that you are only talking to Agnetha and no one else,\" Cassandra told me. \"It's just so hard knowing that you're being watched by millions of people around the country,\" I said. \"I don't understand why everyone cares so much about our relationship.\" \"You're the girlfriend of the King of Denmark. Everyone wants to know about you,\" Cassandra said curling my hair. \"I'm not that interesting,\" I said. \"To the people of Denmark you are. You're the girl who stole the King's heart, you changed him so much. You're determined, strong, and you're not going to let anything stop you from following your dreams.\" \"I changed him?\" I asked Cassandra. \"The King used to be in the tabloids are more of playboy. He'd fool around, race cars down the back roads, date a new girl every month, didn't seem to take his studies seriously. Things like that, but I don't know if they are true, it is just what the tabloids reported about him. But after you came into the picture, he completely changed. I guess you could say he finally became a man and started taking things more seriously.\" \"I knew about those things in his past,\" I said. \"He knows things wouldn't go over well if he still raced cars, didn't take his responsibilities seriously, etc, things wouldn't go over well with me,\" I said chuckling. \"See, what I mean? You may not realize it but you helped him truly cross the line from being a boy to being a man,\" Cassandra said. \"I think everyone is so fascinated with you because of that. They want to know this girl who stole the King's heart and completely changed him,\" she said putting some blush on my cheeks. \"I never thought about it like that,\" I said. \"Just go out there and be yourself. You'll be great,\" Cassandra said doing some finishing touches. \"Alright, my dear, you are all set to go,\" she told me. \"Thank you. And thanks for making me feel better,\" I said getting up. \"Of course,\" she said smiling at me. I went and found Eddie backstage. He was sitting down on a couch, flipping through a magazine. \"Hey!\" he exclaimed as I came over to him. \"Hey babe,\" I said giving him a peck on the lips and sitting down next to him. \"Are you feeling okay?\" he asked. \"I'm really nervous,\" I said. He put his arm around my waist, pulled me close to him and kissed my head gently. \"You'll do great,\" he said to me. \"I know you will.\" I didn't know what to say. I felt like I could barely talk. My heart was pounding and I began to gag. \"Excuse me,\" I said and went running to the bathroom. \"Paige,\" I heard Eddie say, getting up and following me. I locked myself in the bathroom and threw up. I hated that Eddie had to see me like this. \"FIVE MINUTES!\" I heard the backstage manager yell. Hearing that made my stomach churn again and leaned over into the toilet as I vomited again. I was beginning to truly panic. I couldn't do this. I couldn't do this. I couldn't do this. I was going to be on stage in five minutes and I had my head in a toilet bowl. Part of me wanted to cry, part of me felt like I was going to vomit again, and part of me just wanted to go back home, go into bed and sleep the day away. \"Paige?\" Eddie knocked gently on the door. I leaned over one last time and got sick. Then, I slowly got up, cleaned up, and composed myself. \"ONE AND A HALF MINUTES!\" The backstage manager yelled again. That made my stomach churn again but I took a few deep breaths trying to calm down. \"Paige, please open up,\" Eddie asked gently. I opened the door and looked at Eddie. \"I'm so sorry,\" I told him quietly. \"Come here,\" he said and embraced me as I put my head against his chest. I was shaking. \"YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ON AIR NOW!\" The backstage manager yelled. \"Stall, please,\" Eddie said told him. \"We need a few more minutes,\" Eddie said stroking my hair. Annoyed, the manager walked away in a hurry. Eddie took my hand and we sat down on the couch. \"Do you not want to do this?\" he asked. \"You don't have to if you don't want to,\" he told me. \"I want to go out there with you,\" I said quietly, \"I just get so nervous. I'm not used to this.\" \"Take a deep breath and try to calm down,\" he told me. I did as he asked and took a few deep breaths. \"That's what I have been doing all day today. You don't think I'm nervous too? I'm really scared as well. You're such a strong woman. I know that you can do this,\" he told me reassuringly. I looked at Eddie surprised. I didn't know that he was terrified as well. \"Whenever you're ready, just let me know. No pressure,\" he said, taking my hand and squeezing it lovingly. \"Let's go,\" I said after about two minutes. \"Let's go do this thing,\" I said. \"Are you sure?\" he Eddie asked. \"Yes,\" I said confidently. \"Let's go,\" I said standing up. Eddie and I walked hand in hand to the entrance that would take us on stage and waited for them to call our names. \"Is everything okay?\" The backstage manager asked, coming over to us. \"Yes, everything is fine. We just needed a few more minutes. We're ready whenever you guys are,\" Eddie said. We stood for a few more minutes when we heard them announce our names. Eddie gave me a reassuring smile and we walked out hand in hand on stage. There was no turning back now. Chapter 14 Like last time, I walked out on stage with Edvard hand in hand, waving to the crowds as the cameras followed our every move. We shook the host's hand and took our seats next to her. \"King Edvard and his guest Paige Morgan! Welcome to Good Morning Denmark! This is Agnetha and you are watching Good Morning Denmark,\" she said looking at the cameras. \"It is so nice to see you guys again!\" Agnetha exclaimed. \"Thanks for coming back on the show.\" \"Thanks for inviting us again,\" Eddie said. \"How was your trip to the United States?\" Agnetha asked trying to start the conversation. \"It was wonderful. We got to spend a lot of time together, time with Paige's family, and overall it was truly enjoyable,\" Eddie said. \"Anything in particular that sticks out in your mind about the trip?\" Agnetha asked. \"We went on a road trip with Paige's intermediate family to go visit her extended family. I truly enjoyed getting to meet everyone that has been a part of Paige's life,\" Eddie continued. \"What did they think of King Edvard?\" Agnetha asked. I knew that question was directed towards me. I took a deep breath and Eddie squeezed my hand for support. I could feel all of the cameras on me and the lights burning in my eyes. \"Um...,\" I began. I wasn't sure what to say. \"They all loved him,\" I said. \"They all saw what a nice and caring man he is,\" I said looking at Eddie, smiling. \"Now, let's get change directions slightly. So, the last time you were both here you talked about your relationship, wanting to take things slow and that you were in love with each other,\" Agnetha said, starting the conversation. Eddie and I nodded together. I was squeezing his hand again. I hoped it wasn't uncomfortable for him. \"So, can you guys give us an update on your relationship?\" Agnetha asked. \"Well, since the last time we were here, Paige and I really figured out what we both wanted in a relationship and where exactly we felt like ours was going. I feel like our love for each other grew, and I realized how much in love I truly was with her.\" \"And!?\" Agnetha pressed on teasingly. \"And,\" Eddie said chuckling, \"I realized that Paige was the one person who I could not live my without. So...\" Eddie said dragging this out on purpose. Some members in the audience gasped. They knew where this was going. \"So, I asked Paige to marry me,\" Eddie continued on. The entire audience gasped and even Agnetha gasped a little bit. \"And!?\" Agnetha pressed on. \"And I'd like to proudly announce that Paige Morgan and I are engaged to be married,\" Eddie said proudly, smiling at me. \"Paige! Is it true?\" Agnetha asked me. She seemed truly surprised. \"It's true,\" I said smiling, holding out my left hand briefly so she should see the ring. \"Look at that rock! Do you have a cousin around my age?\" she asked Eddie and the entire audience laughed and we did too. \"Have you guys picked a date yet?\" Agnetha asked. \"We don't have anything set in stone yet, but we are thinking either this summer or next summer,\" Eddie said. \"Well, either summer will be here before you know it!\" Agnetha exclaimed. \"Now, Paige, I assume you will be staying here in Denmark while the marriage preparations are being put into place?\" She asked me. \"Yes, of course! I wouldn't want to leave Edvard for any period of time let alone an extended period of time,\" I said. \"Will you explain to us how he proposed to you?\" She asked me. \"Well,\" I said turning to smile at Eddie. \"He took me out to dinner, and then we spent the rest of the evening in town together. Then, he took me to a romantic spot and asked me to marry him,\" I said. The crowd awed. \"And I assume you said yes!?\" Agnetha said trying to be funny. \"Yes, I told him yes,\" I said laughing and the crowd was laughing as well. \"Did you have any idea that a proposal was coming that night? Anything that seemed strange?\" Agnetha asked. \"I honestly had no idea that he was planning to propose to me that night,\" I said sincerely. \"No idea? Not even a hunch or a feeling?\" Agnetha asked. \"I truly had no idea, not even a clue. It was a complete surprise. I didn't even have a feeling about it or assume anything. He truly surprised me,\" I said. \"So, what was going through your mind when he proposed to you?\" Agnetha asked me. \"Well, he got down on one knee, and I figured out what was coming. I was just really focusing on the moment. I was just so surprised, and I was just so happy.\" \"And then what happened after that? Did you tell your family right away? Or did you wait for a little bit?\" Agnetha asked. \"Her family actually knew about my plans that night,\" Eddie said answering the question. \"Really!?\" Agnetha asked surprised. \"Yes, really, it was all a part of my plan for the evening,\" Eddie said. \"I asked her father for permission for Paige's hand in marriage, and her mother and brothers knew about my plans as well. We had an engagement celebration afterwards with them,\" Eddie said. \"What if Paige said no?\" Agnetha asked laughing and the crowd began to laugh as well. \"Then, we would have had a problem,\" Eddie said laughing as well. \"What if her father said no to your request to marry Paige?\" She asked Eddie. \"I still would have proposed to Paige that night,\" Eddie said. \"The royal couple is on their way to enter Holy Matrimony. Please stay tuned as we discuss with them their plans for the future,\" Agnetha said, looking at the cameras, smiling. The ON AIR button went off and I breathed a sigh of relief. \"You're doing great,\" Eddie whispered into my ear. I turned and smiled at him. I let go of his hand and wiped my sweaty palms on my pants. His hand was red from where I was squeezing it. \"Don't worry about it,\" he said reading my thoughts. \"Congratulations to the both of you,\" Agnetha said interrupting our thoughts. \"Thank you,\" Eddie said taking my hand again. \"We're both very happy.\" \"ON AIR IN 5, 4...,\" the camera man began to move his fingers and mouth the rest of the words. The ON AIR light went on and I could feel my stomach churning again. \"We're back with Denmark's favorite couple- King Edvard and his fiancee , Paige Morgan,\" Agnetha said looking at the cameras. The crowd cheered when she said fiance. I could feel myself blushing slightly. \"So, let's talk about the future,\" Agnetha said turning to us. Eddie and I smiled at each other. We knew these questions were coming. \"Have you guys thought about the future at all?\" Agnetha asked us. \"We have discussed the future together,\" Eddie said. \"Any children in that future?\" Agnetha asked curiously. \"We were thinking like two or three,\" Eddie said. \"Yeah,\" I said nodding agreement. \"And there isn't any on the way, is there?\" Agnetha asking jokingly, but I think she was also being serious. \"No, no children on the way,\" Eddie said shaking his head, smiling. My heart stopped slightly, and my stomach dropped a few inches. I thought I was going to throw up again. I squeezed Eddie's hand slightly harder. I hadn't told something very important- the fact that I hadn't gotten my period since the United States. In other words, I was a little over two weeks late, and I was getting nervous. I had been avoiding the topic hoping that everyday it would come, but so far, it hadn't. I just hoped my reaction didn't show on national TV. \"Paige, are you still planning to continue with medical school?\" she asked me, interrupting my thoughts. \"Of course,\" I said smiling. \"Being a doctor always been a dream of mine. I still plan on fulfilling that dream,\" I said trying to remain calm and not trying to vomit. I could feel my stomach churning again. \"Well, we have a few questions from the audience,\" Agnetha said motioning over a line of about 3 people to the side with a microphone. Oh great, I thought as I felt my churn somewhere. I tried to block out my new panic of needing to tell Eddie that my period was late and took a few deep breaths. I was almost done. I was almost done. Just focus on the moment. These were the things that I kept on telling myself. \"Paige, how do you feel about becoming the next Queen of Denmark?\" A teenage girl asked me. I thought about the question for a second. I actually hadn't even thought about that fact yet. Being Queen of Denmark scared me and made me nervous and didn't excite me like maybe some other girls. \"I actually haven't given it much thought,\" I said honestly. \"I...,\" I trailed off as my stomach clenched. \"It's a crazy thought,\" I said trying to finish the question. \"Like, when I'm with Edvard, I can't even wrap my head around him being the King of Denmark because to me, he's just Edvard.\" The girl seemed content with my answer and the next person came up. \"Paige, if you could have done anything different with your relationship with King Edvard what would you have done and why?\" A girl around my age asked. \"When we were in college together, I was so afraid of falling for Edvard that I built up a wall so that no one could come and steal my heart. So, if I could go back, I would have started dating him sooner and not be so afraid of falling in love,\" I said. The next person came up- the final question. I wasn't sure if my stomach was going to make it though. \"King Edvard, what was your first impression of Paige?\" a young man asked. \"That she was...is...a strong, determined, beautiful woman who knows what exactly she wanted in life,\" Eddie said smiling at me. \"That is all that we have time for today. Thank you so much for being on the show with us today,\" Agnetha said standing up and we followed her lead. She gave me and Eddie a quick hug. \"Thank you so much for having us today,\" Eddie said. We turned and began to exit the stage. We quickly waved to crowd right before we exited. We finally got backstage and I breathed a sigh of relief. \"You did great!\" Eddie exclaimed and he leaned forward to give me a quick kiss. I smiled weakly. I felt as though I was about to puke again. \"Paige, are you okay? You look pale,\" Eddie asked. \"Sit down for a minute,\" he said taking me by the hand to a couch backstage. He left to go get a small cup of water and handed it to me. \"Try drinking this,\" he said said giving it to me. Just looking at the water made me even more nauseous. \"Just take a few deep breaths,\" Eddie instructed me, squeezing my hand. \"It's all over now. You did it! I'm so proud of you,\" he said looking into my eyes. I smiled at him and I began to slowly sipped the water. I finished it and then I went to go throw the paper cup away. \"Are you feeling better?\" he asked me. \"A little,\" I replied. We began to walk hand in hand out of the studio and to the car. Eddie got in the drivers side and I got in the passengers side. \"Have you eaten anything yet today?\" Eddie asked me. \"No, I was trying to avoid vomiting, but it obviously didn't work,\" I said. \"I'm sorry if I let you down,\" I said. \"Why would you think that?\" Eddie asked surprised. \"We went on thirty minutes later than scheduled because I wasn't ready since my head was in a toilet,\" I said. \"Paige, it's fine! That sort of thing happens all the time! They just moved on with the next interview,\" Eddie said trying to reassure me. \"I just feel like I let you down. I'm not living up the expectations that you need of me,\" I said putting my head back on the headrest and looking away from Eddie. He took my hand and kissed it. I turned and looked at him. \"I don't need you to do anything. I don't need you be someone that you aren't. I don't have any expectations of you. You can never let me down,\" Eddie told me sincerely. \"I just need you to be yourself and that it is it. Just be yourself- the girl that I fell in love with- you for being you and not anyone else.\" I gave him a big smile and leaned over to give him a kiss on the cheek. \"If you're so worried about messing things up- my mother got so nervous one time before a television interview that they had to cancel it completely- at the last minute,\" Eddie told me. \"Really!?\" I exclaimed. \"To this day she won't admit it, but I remember it. I was about seven years old. She never went on TV again after that. She just a few magazine interviews,\" Eddie told me. I breathed a sigh of relief. \"Thank you, that makes me feel better,\" I said. \"I thought you would be hungry, so I packed you some dry cereal in a bag,\" Eddie said handing it to me. \"Thank you! You win the sweetest finance award,\" I said giggling and opening up the bag. I slowly ate the cereal and I began to feel a little bit better. As I ate, I knew that I needed to tell Eddie what was bothering me in the studio today. My heart raced as I thought about the possibility of being pregnant. I wasn't ready now and it scared me terribly. I wasn't ready to be a mother yet. \"Eddie,\" I started slowly. I wasn't quite sure how not to completely alarm him but let him know what was going on with my body. \"What is is Paige?\" Eddie asked turning to me concerned. \"There is something that I need to tell you,\" I started and then stopped. I had been denying to myself that I could be pregnant and speaking about my fears of my late period out loud helped reality sink in. Eddie turned to look at me and waited patiently for me to continue. \"Is it something bad?\" He asked me. \"Well, I guess it depends on how you look at it...\" I said trailing off. Then I took a deep breath and decided that I had to tell him. I was making him worried now. \"Remember when we had sex on the night of our engagement?\" I asked quickly. \"Yes,\" he said, the color leaving his face. \"I haven't gotten a period since then,\" I said quietly. \"When were you supposed to get one?\" Eddie asked. \"I should have gotten one right about when we got to Denmark. I'm two and a half weeks late now, almost three,\" I told him. The rest of his color left his face. \"Are you usually late?\" he asked. \"Sometimes when I am under stress and I dismissed being late initially as the stress of adjusting to everything, but it's still not coming. I'm getting really scared and worried,\" I said. \"We'll get through this Paige,\" Eddie said reassuringly. \"How quickly do you think we could get married if it turns out that I am pregnant?\" I asked. \"The Catholic Church requires six month of being engaged,\" Eddie said. \"I'll be showing by then,\" I replied. \"I was hoping we could get married early enough so people will think that I just got pregnant right away, including my family,\" I said. \"I could try to talk to Father Kall about speeding things up. Paige, you shouldn't be ashamed of being pregnant. It's a beautiful thing,\" Eddie said. \"Do you really want to be those people who have their child at their wedding?\" I asked panicked. \"Calm down, we'll figure something out. First, I think we should figure out if you're really pregnant or not,\" Eddie said. \"Well, I'd have to take a pregnancy test, but I can't be seen buying a pregnancy test either,\" I said. \"I know,\" Eddie said quietly. \"Would Soren buy one? People wouldn't be able to recognize him, and he wouldn't say anything to anyone,\" I suggested. \"If my mother asked him where he was going though, he would tell her. He's a horrible liar,\" Eddie said chuckling. \"I guess I'll just try to disguise myself and go to a store,\" I said. \"Maybe Wal-Mart.\" \"Wal-Mart?\" Eddie asked looking confused. \"If people thought they saw me, they wouldn't think it was me since a Wal-Mart would be the last place that people would think I would go to. I'll buy the pregnancy test and go through a self-checkout so I can be out quickly.\" \"That may work,\" Eddie said hesitantly. \"Gosh, if we were a normal couple this would be so easy,\" I said slightly frustrated. \"I know,\" Eddie said taking my hand reassuringly. \"If you want to go run off to the United States, I still would open to that,\" he said. \"Could we?\" I asked. \"I would just need some time to abdicate the throne,\" Eddie said. \"Are you serious about this?\" \"Yeah...I don't know...I'm just so confused and scared right now,\" I said putting my head in between my hands. \"Let's go get answers,\" Eddie said reassuringly. He took my hand and squeezed it. We went off to the palace where I would change and try to see if I could buy a pregnancy test unrecognized in a Wal-Mart. Knowing that I would get the test results back before the end of the day made me more nauseous than going on national television. In response to all of your reviews: To those of you who have reviewed, I would like to thank you SO very much! Seeing the reviews truly make my day! I truly appreciate you all being such a good support group, for following my story and encouraging me to write even life gets busy! Please review or PM with your thoughts so far of Part 2 as well as any ideas that you may have! Thanks! - Lauren[Chapter 6] There was only one thing that scared me more than going on national television and that was taking a pregnancy test. Since we were a national icon in Denmark, having a child out of wedlock would be a big deal to the Danes. This child would become the heir to the Danish throne, and I would most likely be known as the King's mistress or lover (since he wasn't married yet). If we were only just a normal couple, I may get a \"we're disappointed in you\" look from my traditional family, but it would be that big of a deal. The fact that he is the King of Denmark changes everything. If only we were a normal couple...if only... We drove two and a half hours out of Copenhagen were people would not except to see us in town. I had changed into \"normal\" clothes, had a hat that covered most of my face, and had my glasses on instead of my contacts. \"Do you think we are making a mistake by doing this?\" I asked. I was so nervous about our fate. \"By doing what?\" Eddie asked. \"By going out in public and buying a pregnancy test,\" I responded. Eddie hesitated for a moment. \"It's a risk, but I think you will be able to pull it off.\" \"And if we're caught?\" I asked. \"Then we're caught and we better come up with a story to tell the press, quick.\" \"Can't they just leave us alone for like 5 whole minutes?\" I asked. Eddie laughed. \"They have no concept of privacy for us,\" Eddie said. \"They should. I shouldn't be afraid to go inside a store without it being all over the news!\" I exclaimed. \"I know,\" Eddie said taking my hand gently. We arrived at the Wal-mart, and Eddie parked. \"Let's do this,\" I said lowering my hat and getting out quickly. I quickly walked through the store and avoided eye contact with anyone. I just needed a pregnancy test. I walked down that isle and was overwhelmed by my choices. There was another women there in the isle too looking at the options. She had two children in her shopping cart. I tried to keep my distance from her. \"First child?\" she asked me. I nearly jumped out of my skin. \"How do you know?\" I asked, slightly panicked. Was my cover blown already? \"The look on your face. You look completely panicked and scared. That usually comes with the first child,\" she said. \"Oh,\" I said looking down. I found First Response on the shelf, grabbed it, and tried to leave as quickly as possible. \"I hope the answer is what you want it to be,\" the lady told me. \"Thanks,\" I said making eye contact with her for a moment. \"Same to you,\" I said turning away and leaving. I went through the self-checkout, paid, and left as quickly as possible without drawing attention to myself. I really tried to play it cool. \"Let's go,\" I said getting into the car. \"Did anyone see you?\" Eddie asked. \"There was some other lady in the pregnancy test area, but she didn't recognize me,\" I said. \"Are you sure?\" Eddie asked. \"I'm positive,\" I said putting my head back. That was an emotionally draining experience. \"How does that thing work?\" Eddie asked motioning over to the box that I had in my hand. \"Well, it's a stick that I pee on,\" I said looking at the directions. \"It says that it is best to do it in the morning,\" I mumbled to myself looking at the box. \"So, we have to wait till tomorrow?\" he asked. \"If we want an accurate reading, then it would be best...\" I said trailing off although I wasn't sure if I could wait any longer. The fear of what could be was killing me. We arrived back the palace, and we both went into my room. I hide the pregnancy test in my purse. \"So, what do we do?\" Eddie asked. \"I'll take the test tomorrow, and we can take it from there,\" I said trying to be strong and take charge of the situation. \"And what if it is positive?\" Eddie asked. \"Then we get married as soon as possible,\" I said moving some things around my room restlessly. I stopped. \"Will you stay here with me tonight? I'm going to have trouble sleeping,\" I said. \"Of course,\" Eddie said. We spent that night in each other's arms, worrying about what tomorrow would bring. I woke up the next morning after a restless night of sleep. It was early, and I laid quietly in bed as I stared at the ceiling and then I turned to look at the clock. It was 7:30am, and I almost never wake up this early on my own except when I'm stressed out. Due to the current situation, I believe this justifies being stressed out. I turned and looked at the pregnancy test on my dresser. Part of me wanted to get up already and get it over with while the other part of me hoped and prayed for my period to come, and I wouldn't have to take it. A knock at the door startled me and interrupted my thoughts. \"Paige,\" I heard Rosalind knock quietly. \"Just a minute,\" I said. I sprinted up out of bed, put on my bathrobe and hid the pregnancy test in one of my drawers in my dresser. Then, I walked over and went outside into the hallway, closing the door quietly behind me. Rosalind looked at me strangely. \"Yes?\" I asked, crossing my arms over my chest. Have you heard from Edvard? Or seen him?\" Rosalind asked. \"His bed was still made this morning and no one has seen him since last night. He isn't answering his phone either,\" she asked me. \"He's a grown man. I'm sure he's fine,\" I said. \"This isn't like him. I'm...worried,\" she finally said genuinely. I sighed. \"He's in my room, sleeping,\" I told her. Rosalind was taken aback by this news and her face showed it. \"So, you're not a good girl?\" Rosalind questioned me, trying to me make me feel guilty for not being a virgin. \"If that means if I am a virgin or not, then no, I'm not a \"good\" girl,\" I said bluntly. \"Oh,\" she said quietly, taken aback by my brutal honesty. \"Please, don't let Arabella know that Edvard spent the night with you. I really want to keep her innocence as long as possible.\" \"Fine,\" I said. \"I'll make sure Arabella doesn't know.\" \"I don't want your immoral behavior rubbing off on her,\" Rosalind snapped. Here came her sarcastic remarks. I was wondering where they were. \"Last time I checked, it takes two to tango,\" I said calmly. I wasn't going to have an argument with her. \"Just please, keep you indiscretions to yourselves,\" she said calmly and walked away. That was not like Rosalind and I wondered what had gotten into her. The normal Rosalind would have yanked Eddie out of my bed and try to come up with some plan to make sure Eddie and I didn't sleep together again (literally or physically) until our wedding night. She was either finally accepting our relationship or she had a plan up her sleeve. I didn't have time to worry about Rosalind. I had a bigger problem on my mind. I walked back in my room and locked it behind me. I was going to take the pregnancy test. I couldn't wait any longer. Eddie was awake when I came back in the room. \"What was that about?\" he asked sleepily. \"Your mother was all \"worried\" about you because your bed wasn't unmade. So, she came here to see if I had seen you,\" I said opening the box. \"And what did you say?\" Eddie asked slightly worried. \"That you were here with me,\" I stated. \"How did she take it?\" \"Not bad considering it was your mother. Eddie, we're both adults here. We don't have to be afraid of our parents,\" I said. \"Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go pee on this stick,\" I said holding it up and going into the bathroom. I followed the instructions to a T and waited the allotted three minutes before I went to go check on it. I walked back into the bathroom, took a deep breath, picked up the stick with my eyes closed trying to gather the courage the open them and look at the test. It was a lot harder than I ever imagined. My heart was beating quickly in my chest. I decided I had to look and see the fate of my future.[Chapter 7] I took the stick in my hand and walked out of the bathroom and over to Eddie. \"Look,\" I said showing him the test. \"It's two lines. What does that mean?\" He asked, slightly confused. \"It means,\" I said sitting down on the bed next to him, breathing a sigh of relief, \"that I'm not pregnant,\" I said. I put my head on his shoulder and exhaled all of the stress and worry that had been consuming my body. I looked up and smiled at him. \"I feel so relieved,\" I said. \"Thank goodness,\" Eddie said. I could feel the tension leaving his body as well. \"I mean, I want children one day, just not now,\" I said as he patted my hair. \"I feel the same way,\" Eddie said. \"One day we will be ready, but now is not the right time.\" We both sat there in silence for a few moments either out of relief or maybe we were still in shock over the possibility of us starting a family together. I ended up getting dressed, going to the library to get caught up and maybe even a little bit ahead of my schoolwork. Also, I just needed time alone and to think. Was I really ready for marriage? Was I really ready to start a family in a few years? I loved Eddie more than anyone else in this world, but was I really ready to put my dreams on hold? Would I have to put my dreams on hold? What would be expected of me as Queen and as his wife? I signed trying to concentrate on my textbook. I knew I was overtired and overstressed, and the school semester just started. Would things get better? Or would they get worse? Little did we know that this scare would just be the beginning of our problems. I left my Organic Chemistry class feeling completely confused- how the heck was I supposed to do that math again? I was sitting down in the campus Starbucks, sipping my coffee as I was trying to look at my notes and examples in the books, trying to make sense out of them before I attempted my homework for the next time our class met. \"Did you understand any of it?\" A male voice asked me. I looked up and saw Jake from my class. \"I thought I only signed up for one foreign language this semester,\" I said turning the page in my notebook to look at another example. Jake laughed and sat down in the chair across from me. \"I have absolutely no idea what went on today either, so at least I know that I am not the only one!\" He exclaimed sipping his coffee. \"Would you like to get together sometime to study?\" he asked. I hesitated. I wasn't sure if he truly wanted to just study together, or if this was his way of trying to spend more time with like- almost like a study date. When I wanted to spend more time with Eddie when we were in college together, I proposed the same exact thing. \"I don't think that would be such a good idea,\" I said nicely. \"Relax, I'm not asking you out on a study date! Besides, I don't date women anyway,\" he said. \"Oh,\" I said, relaxing. So, he wasn't trying to hit on me. \"I wasn't sure if you were trying to hit on me or not,\" I said laughing. Jake started laughing too. \"Sorry, a lot of females seem to get that impression. I just truly want to be friends,\" he said. \"Good to know,\" I said smiling. \"So, would you like to study sometime? I'm trying to get a group together. Maybe with a bunch of us, we can decode this nonsense,\" he said. \"Yes,\" I said enthusiastically. \"Excellent! What number goes with your University e-mail address? Morganp...,\" he started. Everyone here at the University had an e-mail address that started with their last name, then first initial and then a number designated by the University. \"It's 5,\" I said. \"Morganp5.\" \"Moganp5,\" he repeated. \"Got it!\" He said pointing up to his head. I smiled. \"Are people still giving you a hard time here?\" he asked, changing the subject. \"No,\" I said. \"I mostly just keep to myself. Some people give me weird looks, but no one has approached me or given me a hard time in class...besides that one time,\" I said. \"Well, hopefully things will change. Get involved in the school here. You'll meet people, and people will see how your the most normal, down to earth, American girl ever.\" \"Thanks, I sure hope so!\" \"Congratulations on your engagement, by the way,\" he said. \"Thank you,\" I said. \"When is the big day?\" he asked. \"We haven't decided yet,\" I said looking down at my ring, subconsciously. \"Maybe this summer or the next.\" \"Are you going to practice as a doctor after graduation?\" he asked me. \"Of course,\" I said. \"I'm not going to let...um...his position stop me from fulfilling my dreams,\" I said. It was so weird talking about Eddie as being the King of Denmark and me, being his Queen one day. \"So, do you plan to stay here after graduation or go back to the US?\" I asked him. \"I haven't thought that far ahead, but, as of now, I plan on staying here,\" he said. We spent the rest of the time in Starbucks working on the homework problems due the next class, trying to figure out what do. We made some progress, and the problems made some more sense, but I was still pretty confused. \"Shoot,\" I said looking at the time on my phone. \"I have to be on the other side of campus and in my classroom in ten minutes,\" I said gathering books and notes, shoving it into my book bag, and getting up to leave. \"What class?\" Jake asked. \"Danish 101,\" I said zipping up my book bag. \"Held og lykke!\" Jake said, smiling. \"I have no idea what that means,\" I said. \"Good luck!\" Jake said as I started to walk away. \"Thanks! I'll see you around,\" I said speed walking out of Starbucks. I ended up getting to my Danish class just as the professor, Dr. Anne White, was closing the door. \"Sorry,\" I said as I rushed through the door and to my seat. She smiled and said something to me in Danish. \"Uh-huh,\" I said walking to my seat. \"Do you understand what I said?\" she asked me in English. \"No,\" I said. \"Please be on time,\" she said. \"Yes ma'am, I'm sorry,\" I said. \"The King's finance can't even speak Danish,\" someone snickered. \"Enough!\" Dr. White said, going up to the front of the class. I sighed and opened my textbook. Whoever that person was, had a very valid point. Was I really up for all of this if I could not even speak the language?[Chapter 8] I was sitting down in my room later that week, trying to make sense of Danish. I was spending a lot of time on this subject since I would have to know how to speak it fluently one day. I sighed- why did learning a new language have to be so hard? I spoke English and Spanish, wasn't that good enough? I heard a soft knock on my door. \"Come in,\" I said. \"Hey,\" Eddie said closing the door behind him and coming over to me. \"What are you doing?\" he asked, putting his arms around my waist and leaning down, gently sucking on my ear. \"I'm studying, and you're being extremely distracting,\" I said trying to be serious, but I ended up smiling since I loved this distraction. \"Oh really?\" He mumbled, moving down to neck. \"Yes, very distracting,\" I said putting my neck back, enjoying the sensation. \"This was why I avoided relationships in undergrad,\" I said laughing. \"Well, you're not in undergrad anymore. You're in medical school, so I am allowed to distract you,\" he mumbled, moving down to my collarbone. I turned around in my chair. He smiled, picked me up, sat down in my chair, and put me down on his lap. I laughed, put my arms around his neck, my head on his shoulder, and looked into his eyes. \"I needed a study break anyway,\" I said leaning forward to kiss him. \"You work too hard,\" he said stroking my hair. \"What are you doing next Saturday morning?\" he asked me. \"Sleeping,\" I said smiling. \"And hopefully with some company,\" I said rubbing his arm. \"Well, that is when we are supposed to meet the actors who are playing us in the movie that is being filmed. Does that day work for you?\" he asked. I nodded, smiling. \"And what are you doing tonight?\" he asked, sensually. \"You tell me,\" I said slightly seductively. \"I was thinking dinner and some alone time,\" he said, beginning to kiss me on the lips. \"I don't think I can wait till after dinner,\" I said, kissing him back. He picked me up, continuing to kiss me and gently laid me down on the bed where we made passionate love before dinner. I had already settled into a routine, and I think I was finally getting used to people recognizing me all the time. Sure, Eddie's life was scary at first, but when I thought about it, it was nothing that I wouldn't handle. I would get used to being royal, and being queen one day. I was also really starting to bond with my classmates at the University. Sarah, Clara, and Jake had all really reached out to me and helped me feel comfortable at the University. \"Paige,\" Sarah told me one day as we were studying in the library together in between classes one day, \"Clara, Jake and I were all going out to eat Friday night as a night of fun before midterms start. Would you like to join us? Please bring Edvard if he would like to come too!\" Sarah said. \"Sure, we'd love to join you guys,\" I said. \"Great! We're going to the pub down the road. So, some drinks, good food, and dancing!\" Sarah exclaimed. \"Sounds like fun,\" I exclaimed! \"Once midterms start, we all are going to be living in this library,\" Sarah sighed. \"Last year, someone brought a sleeping back and a small camping text filled with supplies and literally lived in the library.\" \"Wow,\" I said pretty surprised. \"I honestly don't blame that person. Midterms are pretty brutal- not as brutal as finals, but they are pretty torturous.\" \"Fantastic,\" I groaned. I sighed and looked back at my textbook. Medical school was extremely demanding, and I couldn't imagine what our midterms would be like. Plus, I had the extra class too that I had to study for- Danish- which wasn't as hard as I thought it was going to be, but it was still hard. \"If you ever end up staying here really late and need a place to crash, just call me. We are less than 5 minutes away, walking distance.\" \"Thanks, I appreciate that and I am sure that Eddie appreciates it too. He wouldn't be happy about picking me up in the middle of the night,\" I said chuckling. I ended up staying in the library late that night, studying and working on a big research paper due soon. When I found myself nodding off in the library, I decided that it was time to call it a night and call Eddie to pick me up. \"Hey, I'm ready,\" I said as he answered. \"I'm in the library. It's right off of Little Street,\" I said. I usually just walked back home, but I didn't feel comfortable walking home in the dark. \"I'm on my way,\" he said. \"Bye, love you,\" I said hanging up. I put my five hour energy in my backpack- I would have to save it for tomorrow when I had to finish the paper. I was about halfway done, and I had finished all of my research and made my outline. I was still stressing about it though. I was tempted to go back home, brew some coffee, and stay up all night tonight and just finish it, but then I knew that I wouldn't be able to study tomorrow. I walked outside, and sat on a bench by the parking lot, waiting for Eddie. I saw his car pull up, and I stood up, swung my back pack over my shoulder and walked over to him. \"Thanks babe,\" I said closing the door and leaning over to give him a kiss. \"You're sure studying late,\" he said as he put the car in drive. \"I have this big 25 page paper due Wednesday, a test on Thursday, and a presentation on Friday. And midterms haven't even started yet,\" I said swinging my head on the head rest and closing my eyes. \"I can feel your stress. Just take a deep breath and calm down. You'll get through this. You always do,\" he said reassuringly. I turned my head and smiled at him. \"I know, but when I think about it all, it's so overwhelming,\" I said. \"And there isn't a break. Midterms start next Wednesday and things will get even more stressful,\" I said. \"Paige, you got this,\" he said taking my hand and squeezing it. \"Oh hey, remember when I told you about Sarah?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" Eddie said, nodding his head. \"Well, she, her roommate, and another medical student are going out to eat Friday night, and they invited us. Do you want to go?\" I asked. \"You should go, but I don't know if it would be a good idea if I went,\" Eddie said. \"Come on, it'll be fun,\" I said, squeezing his arm. \"It'll be good for you to meet some people too outside of Parliament,\" I said encouragingly. \"Okay,\" Eddie said reluctantly, but willingly. \"Thanks babe,\" I said leaning over and giving him a kiss on the cheek. The next day, my alarm clock went off a lot earlier than I had wanted. I left the library around 11pm and went into bed by 12:30am, although I knew that I would be staying up much later tonight. I got up, dressed, and grabbed a bagel to eat on my way to school. I had Introduction to Clinical Medicine at 9am, and we were going to be reviewing for the test the next Friday. I would get my clinical assignment shortly after the test grades were posted, and I would be placed based on where they thought would be the best fit for me. I never knew that being a medical student would be so stressful. I couldn't wait till Friday night where Eddie would get to meet my friends, and we would have the opportunity to de-stress. If I thought things were stressful now, it was good that I couldn't look and see exactly what the future held for us. \"Paige!\" Sarah yelled, waving as Eddie and I walked into the pub that Friday night. \"Come on. Just be yourself\" I assured Eddie as we were walking hand in hand over to the table where Clara, Sarah, and Jake were sitting. Eddie was nervous about meeting new people outside of his circle. He said he felt a lot of pressure to impress. He also wasn't used to just hanging out with people. He did when we were in college together, but other than that, he had no had a lot of experience in the Danish social life. \"Hey guys,\" I said sitting down next to Sarah at the round table. \"This is my fiancé Eddie. Eddie this is Jake, Clara and Sarah,\" I said. \"Hello,\" Eddie said quietly, sitting down next to me. \"It's nice to meet all of you.\" \"So, this first round of shots,\" Jake said motioning over to the plate of small shot glasses on the table, \"is on me and is for Paige and Edvard and in celebration of their engagement! May you guys have a lifetime of blessings and happiness!\" I smiled, and we all took a shot glass, held them up in the air and touched glasses, and took the shot. \"Dude, I'm dreading midterms like the plague,\" Clara wined, putting her shot glass down. \"La-la-la-la-la,\" Sarah said putting her hands over her ears. \"I can't hear you.\" \"Are the midterms here really that bad?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" everyone said, including Eddie who had done most of his undergrad at the University of Copenhagen. \"And in medical school, they are even going to be really intense and stressful,\" Jake commented. \"Are you all in medical school?\" Eddie asked, drinking some of his water. \"I'm in medical school, Sara and Clara are both in law school,\" Jake said. I excused myself and got up to get a drink. \"Are you sure you don't want anything babe?\" I asked Eddie, squeezing his shoulder. \"I'm fine. I'll drive home. You have fun tonight,\" he said. I ended up getting a margarita and sat back down. \"So, I'm going to see you at all during midterm week?\" Eddie asked me. \"I mean yeah, you'll see me. But probably not a lot,\" I said sipping my drink. \"You can come get me at the library at 3am,\" I said jokingly. Eddie laughed. \"So, are you all American?\" he asked my friends. \"I'm not, I'm Danish\" Clara said. She spoke English so well you wouldn't know that it was her second language. \"I'm from California,\" Sarah said. \"I'm from Oklahoma,\" Jake said. \"So, what made you guys decide to study in Denmark? Paige would have never even considered it if she had never met me,\" he said chuckling. \"I would be at John Hopkins by Washington DC, but I'm glad that I am here,\" I said turning to Eddie and smiling at it, gently squeezing his hand. \"You guys make the cutest couple,\" Clara just blurted out. We had been here for a while now, and I believe she was at least tipsy if not slightly drunk since Clara was usually extremely quiet. I blushed. I was slightly embarrassed, and I did not know how to respond to that. \"You guys are really cute together,\" Sarah chimed in, agreeing with Clara. \"How did you guys meet?\" She asked. \"At the University of Wisconsin,\" I said sipping my second margarita of the night. \"Like how?\" Sarah pressed. \"I know the story is that you guys met in class, but there has to be more to it,\" she said. Sarah was drunk and wasn't usually this brazen with her questions. I laughed at the memory without telling it. \"It was in the Student Center at the college. We kind of got off on the wrong foot, but I saw him class the next day, and then we got to know each other as we spent more time together,\" I said laughing. It still wasn't the entire story, but it was funny thinking about it. \"So, you're first impression wasn't good?\" Clara asked, laughing along. \"Not at all!\" I exclaimed. \"He was hitting on me and-\" \"Paige,\" Eddie said cutting me off. I knew he didn't want me to tell the whole story, and I wasn't going to explain it. \"Relax,\" I said laughing again. I was drunk too at this point in the night, and I wasn't thinking. \"I'm not going to tell the entire story. Take some of my margarita. Relax,\" I said squeezing his shoulder. \"What's the whole story?\" A drunk Sarah asked. I just laughed and waved it off. \"Come on!\" Sarah pressed. \"He was drunk and hitting on me, and-\" \"Paige,\" Eddie said trying to get me to stop. \"And he asked me to take off my shirt, and I sprayed him with a soda nozzle. So, when I saw him in class the next day, it was like- oh man, him again? But I'm glad he reached out to me later- sober,\" I said laughing again, and the table burst out laughing. One of my favorite songs came on the loudspeaker. There were quite a few couples on the dance floor. \"Let's dance- I love this song!\" I exclaimed, turning to Eddie. \"I don't think so...\" Eddie said. \"Come on! It'll be fun!\" I exclaimed. \"I'll dance with you!\" Jake exclaimed, drunk too. \"Let's all go,\" I said getting up and my friends followed as we went out onto the dance floor, leaving a sober Eddie at the table, sipping his water. \"Come on,\" I went over to him again. \"Paige, we should probably get going. We have to be up earlier tomorrow to meet with those actors.,\" he said looking at his watch. \"And I have a feeling you will be hung over tomorrow.\" \"Oh come on, don't be a party pooper,\" I said giggling. \"Come on, Paige,\" he said gently, taking my hand. \"It's late. Let's go.\" \"Fine,\" I said disgruntled. We walked over to my friends on the dance floor to say good bye. \"We're gonna head out. Thanks for inviting us. It was fun!\" Eddie said. \"So soon?\" Sarah asked, disappointed. \"Yeah, we got Mr. Party Pooper over here,\" I said laughing. I felt Eddie tense up slightly. We left, and we went to the car. \"Man, that was fun,\" I said closing the door, still feeling the effects from my margaritas. Eddie was quiet and didn't say anything. \"What's wrong?\" I asked him. He still didn't say anything. \"Eddie, come on,\" I said slurring the two last words, gripping his shoulder. He sighed. \"What was that, Paige?\" he asked, \"was it a show to show your friends how normal we are?\" he snapped. \"Eddie, what the hell are you talking about?\" I asked truly confused. \"I was just being myself; I wasn't putting on a show for anyone!\" I exclaimed. \"You don't get it, Paige. You don't get this life. You can't trust who you tell things to, especially private matters. And you don't get that as the future Queen of Denmark, you can't be seen drunk in bars,\" he snapped. \"What are you talking about? I never talked about anything personal-\" \"Oh yes, you did. You were talking about the night we met and how I was basically a drunk creep hitting on you. You also said how basically, you did not like me at first; you weren't happy to see me in the class the next day. I know that this is what happened, but I would never say anything about you in front of acquaintances or even in front of people we really know. That is personal, Paige. It is between us. And now, it won't be long before that is the front cover of a news story. And even when we were leaving, you were putting me down in front of your friends,\" he snapped at me. \"I did not put you down in front of my friends! I was just teasing you when we were leaving. I never meant anything by it!\" I exclaimed. \"And I'm sorry that I kind of told about how we met, but I didn't think it would be a problem or that you would take if so offensively,\" I argued. \"Paige, I'm scrutinized by everyone and the press already. I didn't need this story of me coming out. I would never tell one of your embarrassing college stories. I would protect you. You would be furious at me if I ever spoke of you like that. Your brothers were completely right- give you a few drinks, and you will tell anyone whatever they want to hear,\" he argued. \"That's not true!\" I protested. \"You were drunk tonight...you ARE drunk tonight, Paige,\" he said sternly. \"As the future Queen of Denmark, you can't do this. You can't go out to bars with friends, get drunk, and dance with other men,\" he snapped at me. \"Maybe I don't want to be the Queen of Denmark,\" I said. \"Maybe I want to live in the US with you and attend John Hopkins University instead of always being in the spotlight,\" I snapped back. \"And I did not dance with any other man. I wanted to dance with you,\" I said sternly. \"Then, let's go move to the US!\" Eddie exclaimed. \"Jake asked you to dance, and you didn't exactly tell him no,\" Eddie said. \"Well, I didn't accept it either. That was why I offered for everyone to come and dance. I wouldn't do that. And besides, Jake is gay-\" \"Gay or not, I don't like you dancing with other men or even having other men suggest it! He obviously thought it was okay to do so,\" Eddie argued, cutting me off. \"I don't know why he did that, but I just wanted to dance with you!\" I exclaimed. \"You making way too big a deal out of all of this,\" I said, crossing my arms. \"Really?\" Eddie snapped, turning to look at me. \"LOOK OUT!\" I screamed as I saw Eddie about to run a stop sign with a car going through the intersection at high speeds. Eddie slammed on the breaks, and we sat there at the stop light for about a minute in complete silence. \"Weren't you going to stop?\" I snapped. \"Yes,\" Eddie said sternly. \"Well, you were waiting a long time to put on your breaks. Let me drive,\" I said unbuckling my seat belt. \"You're drunk. Stay where you are,\" Eddie said. \"Well, I obviously would have done a better job that you are. Are you going to say that I'm picking on your driving now?\" I snapped. Eddie sighed and went through the intersection as it cleared. First, you put me down in front of your friends tonight, twice. Second, you were (and still are) drunk in a public place. Third, another man thought it was okay to ask you to dance,\" he said angrily. \"Remember when we were back together just working on our relationship? You were angry at me because some member of Parliament's girlfriend told you that we slept together AFTER we had already broken up. It didn't happen, but you were made at me until I explained it to you. And also, you are going to be very busy once midterms start and even after, and I really wish that you had decided to spend the night with just me and not with a bunch of people that you barely even know,\" he said calming down. \"Well, if you would have rather that we just spent the night together, why didn't you just say so?\" I said, still angry. \"I wasn't going to tell you that you couldn't go out with your friends,\" Eddie said, starting to get angry again as well. \"I want to be able to hang out with other people outside the castle walls,\" I argued strongly. \"I'm not saying that you can't,\" Eddie said sternly. \"You have to be so careful who you talk to Paige and what you say. Something some day will come back to bite you,\" he said calmly. \"Well, I'm really sorry that you had such a horrible time,\" I said sarcastically. We drove the rest of the way in complete silence, and we didn't talk to each other the rest of the night. For the first time ever, we went to bed without saying good-night to each other or giving each other a good-night kiss. Also, for the first time, we went to bed angry at each other and on non-speaking terms.[Chapter 9] Chapter 15 I woke up the next morning to the sound of my alarm going off around 9:45am. We had a private one on one with the characters who were playing around 11 and then lunch with the cast and crew around 12:30pm. I had already hit the snooze button at least 5 times so far. Eddie was right- I was hung over, big time. I had a bad headache, it hurt to look at the light, and I felt somewhat nauseous. \"Paige,\" Eddie said as he knocked quietly on my door. \"Come in,\" I said, groaning. He came in my room and closed the door quietly behind him. \"You're still not up!?\" he said, slightly harsh. \"I know, I know,\" I said sitting up in bed. \"I'm getting up.\" Eddie walked over to my windows and opened up the curtains causing the morning light to pour into my room. \"The light, the light, it hurts,\" I said holding up my arms in front of my eyes like a shield. Eddie sighed and closed the curtains. He still seemed a little tense from last night. I got up and went to the bathroom to brush my teeth and get ready. I came out, got dressed, threw on some make-up and combed my hair. Eddie sat on my bed watching TV while I was getting ready. He didn't say anything to me, and I wasn't saying anything to him. I sighed, put my brush down, and turned to Eddie. \"Eddie,\" I said walking over to him and sitting down next to him. \"Yes,\" he said. \"You were right,\" I said looking at him. \"I was drunk last night, and I shouldn't have said those things. I'm really sorry,\" I said sincerely, looking into his eyes. \"Paige, we will always have plenty of enemies, but we need to always support each other and protect each other- royal or not.\" \"I know, and I shouldn't have said what I said last night,\" I said. \"We're a team. I don't know what got into me-\" \"Tequila did,\" Eddie said chuckling. \"Yes,\" I said bashfully. \"Never let me drink before an interview,\" I said laughing. \"Deal,\" he said leaning in to kiss me. \"So, are you still mad at me?\" I asked as we broke a part. \"I knew I couldn't stay mad at you long. All is forgotten and forgiven,\" he said kissing me again. We broke a part and embraced in a hug. \"Now, we better get going if we are going to make this on time,\" he said. We got up and left. I was pretty quiet in the car, and I was wearing my sunglasses which I usually don't do. \"Pretty hung over?\" Eddie asked me. \"Yes,\" I grunted. \"I told you so,\" he mumbled under his breath. \"Please, just don't even start,\" I snapped. \"I'm hung over, it's something that I have to deal with; it's not going away if we complain about it,\" I said sighing. \"Just please watch your alcohol consumption when we have the Fall ball in a few weeks,\" he said pretty calmly. \"I will,\" I said slightly annoyed. We arrived at the studio center where the movie was being filmed. Well, apparently they had just started filming, but the actors who were playing our characters really wanted to meet us so they would know how to accurately portray us. The girl who was playing me was really hyper or maybe she was just nervous to meet me. \"Hello! Ms. Morgan, it's such a pleasure to meet you!\" she said shaking my hand enthusiastically. \"Please, call me Paige,\" I said. I hated when people were so formal with me. \"I'm going to go with Adrian,\" Eddie told me. \"Text me when you're done, okay,\" he said giving me a kiss on the cheek. \"Okay,\" I said smiling at him. \"I'm Katherine, by the way,\" the hyper girl said as we walked to her trailer. \"It's nice to meet you,\" I said. I wasn't really sure what to say, and I probably was just as nervous as she was. We went inside her trailer and sat down on the couch in there. I looked around. There were a lot of magazines and newspapers with either me or Eddie as the headlines. \"Sorry,\" she said seeing me looking at her stacks of magazines and newspapers. \"I'm not a stalker, I swear. I just have been doing my homework so I portray everything accurately,\" she said. I looked at Katherine. She really did not look a lot like me. She had blue eyes, long blonde hair, but we had a similar bone structure- both small boned, skinny, and our faces had a similar shape. I had dark brown eyes, short brown hair with caramel highlights. I smiled. \"I still can't believe they are making a movie about us. I swear we aren't that interesting,\" I said laughing. \"So, your playing me in the movie?\" I asked, still confused by her appearance. \"Yes! I know what you are thinking- we look nothing a like. But with some make-up, and I have brown colored contact lenses that I am going to wear along with a wig that is identical to your hair style. We did a test run a few days ago, and I think I could have fooled some people on the streets,\" she said proudly. \"This is my first big acting role, and I just want everything to be perfect. I know I mostly got this role only because I am American, and our bone structures are pretty similar.\" \"Don't put yourself down,\" I said. \"You got this role because you deserved it,\" I said trying to boost up her self-esteem. \"I guess so,\" she said looking down at her feet. \"So, what would you like to know?\" I asked, trying to change the subject. \"Everything!\" She exclaimed. \"There isn't a lot about you when you guys first met. So, tell me about that! How did you feel about him at first?\" \"Honestly, we kind of got off on the wrong foot,\" I said. \"You guys met when you working in the student center, right? And he came up and started flirting with you?\" Katherine asked. \"Yes,\" I said. \"And what was going on through your mind at the time? What were you thinking?\" she asked. \"Why was this guy hitting on me,\" I said laughing. \"Really?\" \"Yeah, it was kind of unwanted flirting at the time.\" \"So, what was your reaction then when you saw him again in your English class?\" she asked. \"You again,\" I said laughing. \"So, there was no attraction at first?' She asked. \"I mean, he was obviously attracted to me, and I thought he was pretty good-looking,\" I said, \"but that was it,\" I said chuckling. \"Well, when did things start to change?\" Katherine asked. \"Eddie started working at the Student Center too, and I think that was when we really started to bond. And then for English class, we would study together,\" I said. \"It didn't take long before we spent most of our time together,\" I said. \"As friends though? Or something more than friends?\" Katherine asked. \"It was just as friends. By then, I was very much attracted to him, but I was resisting him so because I wanted to focus on my school, and I didn't want to be distracted,\" I said. \"So, when did you finally give in to your feelings?\" she asked. \"I brought Eddie home for Thanksgiving to my house, and he leaned in as though he was going to kiss me, and that was when I realized I had already fallen for him, and I couldn't resist him anymore.\" We spent a good hour together, chatting, and getting to know each other. Most importantly, I hopefully helped her get to know me better so she could play her role to the best of her abilities. Chapter 16 \"How did it go?\" Eddie asked me as we were back on the road. \"Pretty well. Katherine seems sweet, and she really wants to a good job,\" I said. \"What about your guy?\" \"Same. He really wants to portray me correctly,\" he said. \"I think it is so weird,\" I said. \"Turning our story into a movie. We're not that interesting,\" I said laughing. \"I know; it's weird even for me,\" he said. \"So, I was thinking,\" he started, turning to look at me. \"After midterms and you have your fall break, would you like to go take a vacation? We could spend the time at the beach, and it would just be the two of us,\" he said smiling. \"That,\" I said wrapping my arms around his shoulder and putting my head down, \"sounds like an amazing way to unwind after midterms.\" \"And for Christmas,\" he continued, \"I was wondering how you felt about going back home or staying here?\" he asked. \"Do you have a preference?\" \"What do you think my preference is?\" I asked teasingly. \"Okay, so then we will spend Christmas with my mother,\" he said laughing too. \"My parents shouldn't give you such a hard time this time around. They are really excited about having you in the family,\" I said. \"That's good! Also, do you want to go out tonight?\" he asked after a few minutes of silence. \"Sure!\" I exclaimed. \"There is this one place that I used to go out with some friends when I was younger. They have some good food, good music for dancing-\" \"Really! You want to go out dancing!?\" I exclaimed, very excited. \"Yes,\" he said smiling. \"Let's get the dance in that we didn't have the other night,\" he said. That was exactly what we ended up doing. We ate food that was bad for us, and we danced the night away young, stupid, and in love. You would have never known that we just had a big fight the other night. All was completely forgotten and forgiven. We laughed, kissed, danced, enjoying each other's presence, and we were completely oblivious to the fact that someone in the country was determined to make us separate.[Chapter 10] Chapter 17 I left my organic chemistry professor's office practically skipping. He had put the exams outside his office, and I had gotten a solid B on the midterm exam that I believed that I had failed. Also, tonight Eddie and I were planning on having a date night. I could not wait. I had not spent a lot of time with Eddie over the past week due to midterms. And then, we would be leaving for our romantic vacation during my fall break! \"Paige!\" I heard someone call after me, interrupting my thoughts. I stopped and turned around and saw Jake trying to catch up with me. \"Hey!\" I said smiling. \"I didn't as bad on the test as I thought I did!\" I exclaimed. \"Today has been great! And fall break starts too!\" \"That's really good!\" He said. \"I ended up with an A-,\" he said. He appeared to be uncomfortable around me. \"Wow! For that class, that's like impossible,\" I said. \"Hey, listen Paige, have you seen the newspaper today?\" He asked blurted out quickly. \"No...,\" I said slowly. My heart dropped a few feet in my chest. I knew what was next couldn't be good. \"Why...what's in there?\" I asked. I could feel my heart racing in my chest. Jake and I would usually joke about the articles in the newspaper about me or Eddie. If he was talking to me about it, it had to be bad. \"Let's go someone more private,\" he mumbled. Oh man, this could not be good. My good mood was ruined, and I felt like my stomach churn. It probably didn't help that I didn't sleep the night before studying for my Danish midterm today, and I was simply running on coffee today. \"Is everything okay?\" I asked. \"Jake, you're killing me over here,\" I said. \"You're not going to like this article,\" he said quietly. I followed him to a bench by the small chapel on campus, removed enough were people would not be able to hear us but still would be able to see us. We both sat down and he pulled out the newspaper from today and handed it to me. I let out a gasp. I couldn't even imagine that this would even be possible. On the front page of the paper was a big picture of me kissing a man. That man was Jake. \"Oh my god,\" I said. \"Oh my god,\" I repeated several times. \"I know,\" he said gently. \"But, this never happened!\" I exclaimed. \"How did they even make this? Who came up with this idea?\" \"I don't know,\" Jake said. \"I don't know who made this, or who came up with this,\" he said. \"We both know it's photoshopped but other people don't.\" \"It looks so real,\" I said. \"How could someone be so cruel as to set me up...set us up like this?\" I asked. I wanted to cry. How could the press be so mean to me? Why did they hate me so? \"I look like I broke up a relationship,\" Jake said. \"And I look like the girl that the media has been trying to portray me as- the American girl that is only here for the glory,\" I said trying to hold back the tears. \"Hey there, it's okay,\" Jake said patting me on the back, seeing how distraught I was. \"Don't,\" I said. \"People will think...\" I started to say but the tears finally came down my face. \"It'll be okay,\" he said. I felt as though I was in high school again, being bullied endlessly. Except this time, the bullies had more power than I did and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I felt my phone vibrate and I pulled it out of my pocket. I had a message from Eddie. \"Paige, we need to talk. Come meet me in my office when you get back,\" I said reading the text out loud. \"Is that from-\" Jake began. \"Yeah, it's from Eddie,\" I said. \"Surely, he will believe you,\" Jake said trying to comfort me. \"I don't know. The picture is very convincing. If the positions were reversed, I don't know if I would believe him or not,\" I said. \"I can talk to him if you need me to,\" Jake said. \"I'm not sure if that would help or not. It might make things worse in the end. I'll let you know,\" I said. I looked back at the article. \"Paige Morgan, 23, is the current American fiance of King Edvard Williams. Ms. Morgan, who is currently a medical student at the University of Copenhagen, has been reported to stay on campus late in the evening to do \"studying.\" Many witnesses said they have seen her spend most of her time with Jake Smith, who is also a current exchange student from the United States and also a medical student. It was claimed that they two were just friends; however, evidence appears to prove otherwise. The rumors that Morgan was marrying King Edvard for his title and money now appear to be more true than ever. The palace has not made a comment about this incident,\" I said reading the article out loud. \"I can even describe what I'm feeling right now,\" I said. \"I should probably get going and get this over with,\" I said getting up. \"Paige,\" Jake said. \"what are we going to do about this?\" He asked. \"I don't know,\" I said sadly. \"Paige, you're a very strong woman. I know that you will be able to get through this. And I know that King Edvard will believe you,\" he said. \"Thanks,\" I said smiling, picking up my backpack. I took a deep breath and began my walk back to the palace. I hoped that Jake was right. I hoped that everything would be okay. I hoped that Eddie would believe me. But deep down in my heart, I feared the worst. Chapter 17 I walked back to the palace with a hundred thoughts running through my head. Who did this to us? Why would anyone try to frame me? Would Eddie believe me? A surge of panic rushed over me when I played the scenario where he did not believe me. Would Eddie stand by my word or throw me out on the street? I sighed, my heart racing as I approached the palace. I needed to just get this over with. I entered the palace and walked slowly through it, panic truly kicking in. I had no reason to panic. I didn't do anything wrong, but would Eddie believe me? Eddie's office door came into sight, and I stood out it silently for a few moments. I took a deep breath and knocked on the door to Eddie's office. I tried to keep my hands from shaking, but I could almost feel his anger through his text message. \"Come in,\" I heard him say. My heart was pounding in my chest, I took a final deep breath and opened the door into his office. \"Hey babe,\" I said coming in and smiling at him. He looked up at me. He did not look happy. His eyes were slightly puffy and red. I knew that he had been crying. My heart dropped into the pit of my stomach. This was not going to be good. \"Come here, and have a seat,\" he said motioning to the chair across from his desk. This already wasn't good. I could tell. I was so upset; I was about to vomit. \"You have a lot explaining to do,\" Eddie said chocking up and putting today's newspaper on his desk so I could see. \"Eddie, please,\" I said trying to be calm. \"You have to believe me. That's not me-\" \"Really? Because that looks just like you,\" he said. \"Do you have some twin in Denmark that you never told me about?\" He said sarcastically. \"Eddie,\" I said trying to be strong. \"That's not me. Someone must have photoshopped that. You have to believe me. I would never do anything to hurt you like that. You're the only man that means anything to me.\" \"Who is the Jake Smith guy? Was he the guy we met at the restaurant that one time? How do you know him?\" he asked. \"Yes, that was him. We have organic chemistry together. He was in a study group that we had for the organic chemistry midterm. I'd consider him to be a friend,\" I said. \"You love going after guys you're just \"friends\" with,\" he said. \"We were just \"friends\" too,\" he said putting \"friends\" in quotations marks each time he said it. \"Eddie that was completely different and you know it. I was very attracted to you. I'm not attracted to him at all,\" I said. \"Besides, Jake is gay. Eddie, the whole situation doesn't make sense, and you know it. Someone is trying to break us up,\" I said trying not to get emotional. \"This picture begs to differ,\" he said. \"How could you do this to me Paige? Do you have any idea how much this hurts me?\" He said chocking up. \"I was going to abdicate the throne for you, live in America, start at nothing. I would do anything for you. And then you turn around and cheat on me with an American exchange student,\" he said, tears flowing down his cheeks. \"Eddie,\" I said with tears coming down my cheeks too. \"I gave up my life in the United States to be with you. I left my family, my friends, I was going to put my education on hold for you. I completely changed my life for you because that it how much I love you. Think about it- why would I do this?\" \"Because all of the rumors are true,\" he snapped. \"You're just here to live the fairytale life.\" \"No, Eddie, and you know that is not true,\" I sternly. \"Let's go run off together. Let's go get married and start our life where no one knows who we are,\" I suggested. \"Why would I want to do that? After you betrayed me so? Why would I want to marry a girl who doesn't even love me?\" he snapped at me again. \"I do love you! You once told me that people would always try to tear us apart. That there would be lies printed about us, but we would have to stick by each other through it all and believe each other,\" I exclaimed, wiping the tears from my face. \"This is different Paige! I have a picture of here sticking your tongue down another guy's throat!\" He exclaimed, raising his voice at me. \"Eddie, I swear, that's not me. Someone photoshopped it. Someone wants to turn us against each other, and it's working,\" I said raising my voice as well. \"You know, I really want to believe you. I really do. But I've noticed you've been coming back late from school when you claim to be studying in the library. I believed you but now that I think about it, it became a habit. You were always there and never here because you were with him. And then my mother told me about her suspicions. I told her I wouldn't believe it for the world but here we go.\" \"Please tell me you're not going to tell me that you believe your mother instead of me? She's been trying to split us up ever since she met me!\" I was yelling at him by this point. Then it hit me. I knew who did this. \"She was the one who did it,\" I said quietly. \"What are you saying?\" he snapped at me. \"I bet your mother was the one who is behind this!\" I said calmly. \"Paige, please, like my mother would do something like this,\" Eddie said as though it was the dumbest idea in the world. \"It's time that you take responsibility for your own actions and try to pin them on my mother!\" \"Think about it, Eddie! She's been trying to break us up since day 1! She hates me!\" I said raising my voice again. \"The truth is Paige, my mother was right about you all along,\" he said with ice in his words. His words stung as they slowly pierced my heart. The tears flowed from my eyes. I knew us, our relationship, it was all over. He wouldn't believe me. I had to tell him the truth and if he didn't want to listen to it, then that was fine. \"Eddie, I don't know where that picture came from but I didn't cheat on you. I would never do that. I'm not that type of girl. That picture isn't real. And if you don't want to believe me that's your decision, but one day, you'll find out the truth. And the truth is that I'm innocent. I have been studying in the library for my midterms. I haven't been fooling around with anyone. Your mother is trying to hurt us and our relationship, and it worked. It completely worked. You feel for her trap. I love you with my whole heart and soul. I want to spend the rest of my life with you and only you. And I don't care if that meant we had to live in a cardboard box in the street. As long as I was with you, I would be happy. I would never, ever do anything to hurt you. I don't know where that picture came from but that's not me. I would swear my life on it,\" I said with a lot of emotion in my voice. There, I said it all. If he didn't want to believe me now, then that would be his problem. We sat in silence for a few moments. No one said anything. I was looking at him strongly to let him know that I was innocent. I wasn't afraid to maintain eye contact with him. But deep down inside, I knew we were over, forever. \"Paige, we've had a lot of problems with our relationship before, and I think that this nature's way of trying to tell us that we aren't meant to be-\" \"Eddie, don't do this. Please don't do this,\" I said crying. I was trying not to sob in front of him. It was hard. My heart had just shattered into a million pieces. \"And after this incident, I think it's all just a sign,\" he finished with tears streaming down his face. \"Eddie, please no,\" I begged. \"You were meant to be in my life, but just not forever as I hoped,\" he chocked. \"You need to get your things and find somewhere to stay. Your tuition will be covered through this semester but after that, you're on your own whether you decide to stay here or go back to the United States.\" \"Eddie, don't do this,\" I crying. \"Goodbye, Paige,\" he said turning away, tears pouring down his face. My heart was completely shattered into a million unfixable pieces. I held back as sob as I got up and left his office with tears streaming down my face. I walk briskly down the hall and up the stairs into my room where I could let some of my emotions out. I ran into my room, or my old room, locked the door and threw myself onto the bed and cried. I was shaking, my head was throbbing and words couldn't even explain the pain I was feeling. I had lost the man of my dreams. I had lost the man I was going to spend the rest of my life with, all because someone tried to sabotage our relationship. Well, it worked. I tried to compose myself for a few minutes to call Sarah. \"Hey Paige!\" she said answering the phone. This was so much harder than I thought it was going to be. I couldn't even talk. \"Hey...\" I managed to choke out. \"Paige, what's wrong?\" she asked realizing that there was something not right. \"Remember when you said if I ever had to stay at the library really late, I could sleep on the futon in the living room?\" I choked out. \"Yeah...\" \"Can I use it for the rest of the semester,\" I asked beginning to sob with tears flooding from my eyes. \"Oh my goodness, Paige, what happened? Of course you can stay with us,\" she said trying to be comforting. \"Thank you,\" I sobbed. \"What happened?\" she asked gently. \"I'll explain later. I'll be over in a little bit...I just...have to pack up,\" I managed to get out. \"I have to leave for work in a little bit. There's a spare key on top of the door under a the small plant. We're room 402 in the apartment complex,\" she said gently again. \"Okay, thank you,\" I choked out. \"I'll see you soon.\" \"Bye,\" I said and hung up the phone. I got up and began to get busy. I gathered all of my things and packed them all up. It took a while but I believe I gathered all of my belongings. As I was getting ready to finally leave me room, I took my engagement ring off and my promise ring from my very first night in Denmark this summer and put it on the dresser. I took one last look around the room and left for the last time in my life. Should Eddie and Paige call their relationship quits? Should Paige go back to the US and try to forget Eddie? Or they should try to get back together?[Chapter 11] Chapter 18 Soren saw me leaving the palace with my bags and was kind enough to offer me a ride to Sarah's apartment complex. \"I didn't do it Soren,\" I said after driving in silence for a few minutes. \"That picture is photo shopped. I would never do such a thing,\" I said. \"Maybe this is for the best, Ms. Paige,\" he said gently. We rode in awkward silence the rest of the way. As he stopped at the apartment complex, I turned to Soren and smiled. \"Thank you, Soren. And thank you for everything that you've done for me. I'm going to really miss seeing you. You're a kind man,\" I said leaning in to give him a hug. \"I'll miss seeing you too Ms. Paige,\" he said. \"Love you Soren,\" I said beginning to cry again. I couldn't handle all of these good-byes. \"Love you too Ms. Paige,\" he said hugging me back. I smiled and wiped the tears away from eyes. I got out of the car and took my stuff out. I waved to Soren and walked into the apartment complex. I took the elevator up to the fourth floor and felt for the key above the door as Sarah had instructed me. I found the key and turned the door handle. I saw that Sarah had set the futon up in the living area which would be converted into a couch during the day. I saw Sarah wrote a note on the couch: Paige, I'll be home about ten from work or so. Don't feel the need to stay up for me if you fall asleep. My roommate, Clara, should be home about eight. Love you and stay strong! Her note made my eyes swell up with tears. I still could not believe this was happening. I couldn't believe that Edvard and I were over. I felt as though I was in shock and my mind still didn't completely believe what had happened. The man who I planned to spend the rest of my life with was now symbolically dead to me. Getting over this break-up would like getting over a death. He would never be in my life anymore. I would never see him, kiss him, hug him, or talk to him ever again. I was so upset I felt as though I was going to vomit. My heart was pounding through my chest and my hands were shaking. I couldn't stop crying. He thinks that I don't love him and that I never did. He thinks that I was just using him. He thinks that I am the girl that his mother always thought that I was and everything we had was a total lie. I was so upset that I knew I was going to vomit. I ran to the bathroom and leaned over as I felt the vomit coming up. I feel as though it was my body's way of trying to cleanse him from my mind, but I knew that today was just the first step into a long and hard road ahead of me. Even though I loved him, part of me hated him. Chapter 19 I left the bathroom and sat on the couch with my head in between my hands. I had started fall break, but this was the worst way possible to start it. When I woke up this morning, I had no idea how it was going to end. I thought of the first time that we met back at the bar in the University of Wisconsin. I was working and he was hitting on me and asked me to take off my shirt which resulted with me spraying him with a soda nozzle. I laughed at the memory as I wiped the tears from my face. At that time when I first met him, I had no idea what the future held for both of us. I had no idea that I would be engaged to marry him. I had no idea what kind of pain he would be causing me at this very moment. I thought of the first time that we made love back this summer, our trip to the beach, the family road trip with my family, and when he proposed to me. I remembered how happy I was thinking that Eddie would always be in my life. What a stupid fool I was. The memories just made me cry harder but I couldn't turn them off. They were all playing like a film in my head. The pain was consuming my entire body and mind. I was angry too. I was angry at whoever did this to us, I was angry at Eddie for believing that person, and I was angry at myself for loving so deeply and being so stupid. Eddie, the King of Denmark, was never going to marry me. I was just going to be his little puppet until someone better came along; someone with royal blood. I was beginning to unpack when I found that I had packed a book that Eddie gave me once. Inside it said: With all of my love, Eddie . It was one of my favorite books. I looked at the book and hurled it across the room with such force and anger as more tears came down my face. As the book fell to the ground, so did a letter that Eddie had written to me once that I had placed in there. I walked over to the book and the letter. Part of me wanted to rip the letter into tiny pieces, but I couldn't do it. I needed to leave; I needed to get out of Denmark. I wanted to go home. I picked up my phone to call my mother. \"Paige!\" My mother exclaimed as she picked up the phone. \"How are you? How are classes going? How's Eddie? Send our love to him!\" My mom said truly excited for me. I was silent. I couldn't bring myself to tell her the news after that greeting. \"Paige, what is it? Is everything okay?\" My mom asked me, realizing that something was wrong. \"Can I come home for fall break?\" I asked her, trying to be strong. \"Of course you can, sweetie! Weren't you and Eddie wanting to spend sometime together though?\" she asked me. \"I just really miss you guys, and I wanted to come home,\" I said. \"Well, you know you are always welcome here. Did you and Eddie have a fight or something?\" she asked me. Now, I was crying, and my mother could hear it. \"Paige, why are you crying? What's wrong?\" She asked me. \"Eddie and I broke up,\" I said sobbing. \"What!? Why?! What happened? Paige, every couple has disagreements, but you can't run away every time you have one,\" my mom said. \"You guys have been through so much! You can get through this!\" \"Trust me, things have been broken beyond repair,\" I sniffled. \"Everything can always be worked out if you guys are both willing to work it out!\" My mother exclaimed. \"Now, will you tell me what happened?\" she asked me. \"Google my name,\" I sniffled. \"Jeez! Paige! What the hell were you thinking!? How could you do that to Eddie!?\" My mother scolded me, obviously seeing the picture and newspaper article. \"Someone photo shopped me kissing another guy, and it was in the newspaper. I didn't do it, Mom. I swear! The picture of whatever you find on the internet is fake. It's not me,\" I said sobbing. \"So, Eddie thinks I cheated on him and that I never loved him.\" \"Did you try to explaining it to Eddie? That is was all fake?\" my Mom asked me gently. \"Of course, I did!\" I said raising my voice slightly. \"He didn't believe me and broke up with me. We're over, forever,\" I said sobbing again. \"Paige, I think it may be best if you stay in Denmark and try to work things out with Eddie,\" my mother said. \"It's only a matter of time before you guys work things out.\" \"No, Mom, please! I want to come home. I want to leave Denmark and never come back,\" I said sternly. \"Paige, stay in Denmark. I think if you pack up and leave now, you will regret it. Just give everyone a few days to cool off and to give everything some thought and then maybe try to call Eddie.\" \"Mom...\" I said crying. \"Please, I want to come home. I don't want to stay here anymore. I don't want to see Eddie again or talk to him or even hear about him.\" \"Paige, you don't mean that,\" my mother said trying to calm me down. \"Yes, I do. I need to move on with my life and staying here won't help me move on,\" I said sniffling. \"Paige, stay in Denmark for the rest of the semester and then come home. You've been working so hard and you only have 6 weeks left in semester. It's better than coming back and having to start over,\" my mother said gently. \"Okay,\" I said quietly. \"Do you have somewhere to stay?\" my mother asked me. \"Yes, I'm staying with some friends in their apartment by campus,\" I said wiping my eyes with the back of my hands. \"Female friends?\" my mom asked. \"Yes, mom,\" I said sounding annoyed. \"There's my girl's spirit,\" my mom said trying to sound peppy. \"Now, just be strong and stay put for these next 6 weeks. I love you,\" she told me. \"I love you too,\" I said crying again. \"I'm going to unpack; I'll talk to you later,\" I said wanting some time to myself. \"Of course, sweetie. Call me whenever you need me,\" she said. We said our good-byes, and I walked over to the futon, sighed, and began to cry again. I felt like my heart had just been ripped out of my chest and crushed into a million pieces. Why did this happen to us? I wondered about Eddie and how he was doing. Was he as heart-broken as me? Or was he doing okay? I pulled out my phone and sent him a text message: Eddie- neither of us want this. Please, let's talk. I looked at the screen and hit send before I could change my mind. Yesterday, Eddie and I had agreed to use part of our vacation time to start planning for our wedding. Today, I would never talk to him again or see him again in person. I was in so much pain, but at the same time, I was also in shock and in denial. Did Eddie really just break up with me? \"Paige?\" Sarah said coming into the living room. I was sitting on the couch, eating a bowl of Ben and Jerry's ice cream while watching \"The Bachelor.\" Tears were still in my eyes, and I had been sniffling. I honestly hadn't stopped crying since I had gotten to her apartment. I turned and looked at her. She saw how puffy my eyes were and how devastated I was. \"Are you okay?\" She asked coming over to me, putting her arm around me. \"No,\" I sniffled. \"Paige, don't let him win. You're letting him win,\" she said trying to help me up. \"You're a beautiful, strong woman and you'll find a better man who will appreciate you more,\" she said patting my back gently and lovingly. \"If Edvard doesn't want you then screw him! He doesn't know what an amazing girl he is missing out on,\" she exclaimed. \"It's so hard,\" I said starting to cry again. \"I always thought he was the man I would spend the rest of my life with. Someone I'd start a family with. Just the other day we were discussing starting the planning for our wedding. And then, today, I find out I'm never going to see him again. The pain is unbelievable right now.\" \"There, there,\" Sarah said patting me on the back. \"You're probably not watching the best show to help you feel better,\" she said moving to change to channel. \"Eddie and I used to watch this together, don't change it\" I said quietly. I wondered if he was still watching it as well. I wiped the tears from eyes and tried to smile but I couldn't even do that. \"What happened?\" Sarah asked gently. \"Did you see the newspaper from today?\" I asked. \"No...\" Sarah said getting up. I supposed to find the newspaper from today. \"Oh my goodness, Paige! Is that Jake!?\" Sarah exclaimed coming back with the newspaper from the kitchen. \"I didn't do it,\" I said defending myself. \"That picture was Photoshopped. Jake and I aren't into each other at all. I never kissed him. I don't think I ever even hugged him. Someone was trying to ruin my relationship with Eddie. And it worked.\" \"Are you sure this isn't you? Maybe you were drunk or something-\" \"It's not me,\" I said cutting her off. \"The last time I even had anything to drink was when we all went out that one night.\" \"Did you tell Eddie this wasn't you?\" \"Of course. But the picture looks so real. He didn't believe me,\" I said crying again. \"Do you honestly blame him?\" Sarah said gently. \"Would have believed him if the sides were reversed?\" \"I don't know...\" I said quietly. I sighed and rubbed my head. My head was pounding from all of the crying I had been doing. After \"The Bachelor\" was over, I excused myself and prepared myself for bed. Maybe things would be better in the morning.[Chapter 12] Chapter 20 I woke up the next morning believing I was in the palace again. I rolled over looking for my phone on my night table. There wasn't one there. I turned over in my sofa bed and my heart sunk. Everything from yesterday came flooding back into my memory. I opened my eyes and found myself in Sarah's apartment. My eyes immediately swelled up with tears. I wiped them away quickly and took a deep breath. Today was a new day. It couldn't be as bad as yesterday. Today would have been the day that Eddie and I left for our romantic vacation together. Tears welled up into my eyes as I thought of how I should have been spending my fall break- with the man that I loved- instead of single and nursing a broken heart. I got up and put on some yoga pants and a sweatshirt. I wanted to go for a run. I needed to get out of the apartment and try to clear my head. Most importantly, I needed to stop this pain in my heart. I knew that I would not be able to simply turn it off, but I needed to distract myself. Hopefully, running for a little bit would help me do that. I walked into the kitchen to get some cereal to find Sarah and Clara talking. I assumed they were talking about me since they got really quiet once I walked in the kitchen. \"Are you going out today?\" Sarah asked me, surprised. \"It's either that or stay here and feel sorry for myself all day long,\" I replied pouring some milk into my cereal. \"I'm going to go out for a run after breakfast,\" I said. \"I need to distract myself.\" \"Well, I think you want to a look outside,\" Sarah said. I went over to the window. Damn it. The press had found me. \"Shit,\" I said. \"They found me.\" \"Is there anyway to get rid of them?\" Clara asked. I was quiet for a minute. \"I have to go out and talk to them,\" I said remembering what Eddie had told me once. \"But are you up for that?\" she asked. \"No,\" I said, wanting to cry again. \"I think you need to see the paper from today,\" Sarah said handing it to me. \"Paige Morgan ordered to leave palace,\" I said reading the headline out loud. \"Well, that's actually accurate,\" I said looking down at the article. \"American fiancé of King Edvard of Denmark, Paige Morgan, was ordered to leave the palace yesterday afternoon according to unknown sources. The couple apparently had a heated argument in regards to Morgan's current scandalous picture which ended with her being ordered to leave. Morgan is reportedly having an affair with Jake Smith, an American student studying medicine at the University of Copenhagen. The palace had not been able to be contacted for a comment,\" I said putting the newspaper down. \"How are you going run with them out there?' Sarah asked. \"How are we going to leave?\" \"They don't know who I'm staying with. They aren't that good. Someone saw me walk in here yesterday with my bags. That's how they know. I'll leave first and hopefully that will distract them from bothering anyone else.\" \"Are you going to talk to them?\" Sarah asked. \"No, I'm not ready,\" I said looking down. I could feel the tears swelling up in my eyes again. Today wasn't going to be any easier than yesterday. Reality had sunk in, and I was more angry than anything today. Angry at whomever did this to us, angry at Eddie, and angry at myself for loving so much and allowing myself to be hurt so deeply. Chapter 21 \"Paige Morgan!\" I hear several journalists yell my name as I walked outside. \"What happened between you and King Edvard!?\" I hear one yell. \"Is the wedding officially called off?\" I hear another yell. \"Who is Jake Smith?\" Someone else yelled. \"Excuse me,\" I said trying to get through the crowds. Don't cry, I told myself over and over again. I heard about one hundred more questions being thrown at me. I was so overwhelmed. I just needed to go somewhere- anywhere. I wasn't going to stay in the apartment all day long feeling sorry for myself. Today was the first day of my fall break, and I was going to enjoy some of it! \"Excuse me,\" I said again trying to get through a bunch of reporters huddled together. They weren't going to let me go anywhere. \"I really need to get going,\" I said trying to push through them. It wasn't working. I was on the verge of tears and ready to snap at them. I was literally biting my tongue. \"Paige Morgan! Just one question please!\" Someone yelled. \"Okay,\" I said quietly. \"Just one question.\" \"Did you truly love King Edvard?\" \"Of course, I love him!\" I exclaimed with a little more emotion that I had planned on. It came out more like a snap. \"Do you still love him now?\" Someone else yelled. \"Of course, I do,\" I said trying to remain calmer this time. \"Then, why did you cheat on him?\" I hear someone else yell. \"I didn't cheat on him. Someone framed me. That picture isn't real,\" I said. \"Excuse, I need to get going,\" I said pushing my way through. They let me go this time. I quickly wiped a tear forming in my eye although I'm sure someone had already captured it. I looked up and saw a camera right in my face. I quickly turned away and finally got out of crowd. Once the crowd of reporters was out of my sight, I began running. I was running fast, with force and with passion, letting out all of my anger, frustration, and hurt. I thought about Eddie, and I wondered what he was doing now. I wondered if he was angry today, too. I wondered if he was thinking about me. I began to run faster, with tears now clouding my vision. I quickly wiped them away before someone saw them. I was running, and I didn't know where I was running too. I felt a few eyes on me as some recognized me, but I was left alone by all. I was out of breath, but I began to run faster as though the fast I ran that Eddie would somehow leave my thoughts, mind, and heart. My instincts were right when I was in class with him back in Wisconsin. I should have never have gotten involved with him. I should have just remained friends with him and fought my attraction. If I did, then I would not be in Denmark right now, completely heart-broken. I would have been at John Hopkins, continuing on with my life as Eddie continued on with his. We would have both been happy today. We both would not be suffering from a broken heart... I found myself nearing the palace. My body was simply used to going in that direction. I saw it come into view, and I purposely turned myself around and began running in the opposite direction before more painful memories began to invoke my mind. Part of me wanted to go and yell at him for not believing me while the other part of me just wanted to see him again. I felt more tears creep up into my eyes, and this time, I let them fall as I ran away from the life that I used to know. The Paige that I used to know, and the life with the man who I loved- the life that I would have had with him. We were supposed to have children together and grow old together. Now, he was simply someone that I used to know.[Chapter 13] Chapter 21 \"I was starting to get a little worried about you,\" Clara said as I came through the door. \"Sorry, I got pretty far away and then I had to come back. It was a good run though. It helped me think,\" I said getting a glass of water from the faucet. \"You ran for almost four hours!\" Clara exclaimed. \"You must be exhausted.\" \"I'm so emotionally exhausted that I needed this run to help keep me from going in a slump and feeling sorry for myself,\" I said gulping the water down. I forgot to bring water with me, and I didn't want to stop my run to get some. \"I feel a lot better now,\" I explained. \"You haven't talked to him at all?\" Clara asked. \"No,\" I said looking down at my water. \"We're over,\" I said after a few moments of silence. \"I just can't believe it. You guys were so much in love. It showed by just the way you both looked at each other,\" Clara said trying to be sympathetic, but it wasn't working. \"Neither can I,\" I said feeling the tears forming in my eyes. \"Come here,\" Clara said outstretching her arms for a hug. I walked into her embrace and began to cry again. This was so hard. \"There, there,\" she said patting my back. \"I mean, he never even thought for a second that I was innocent. He immediately just accused me and believed the article,\" I sobbed. \"I know,\" she said still patting my back. \"And one day he will find out the truth and regret letting you go,\" she said trying to make me feel better. \"How could I have been so stupid? I really thought that he loved me, and we going to get married,\" I cried. \"He does love you and when he realizes what a mistake he made, he's going to feel like the dumbest man alive.\" I thanked Clara, excused myself and went to the bathroom to take a shower. In the shower, more memories of us forced its way into my mind. I remember how we were studying in the library together, and we went to the back to do a little more than just kiss. I remembered how happy we were and how much in love we were. It was then that I found out that he was the Prince of Denmark due to the photographers who found us. I remember being mad and hurt then, but no where near the pain I was experiencing now. I sat down in the shower and let the water run over me. I wasn't up to go back in the apartment and try to act like everything was okay because it wasn't. I didn't want to spend the whole day moping around either. What a crappy way to spend my fall break. I couldn't even concentrate on my schoolwork to try to do my homework. Trying to work ahead was completely out of the question. I closed my eyes as the water came down on me. I could remember his touch, his smile when he would look at me, his kiss, and the love that he had for me. I remembered how he would still give me butterflies in my stomach, and how I just wanted to spend every waking moment with him. I knew, as the tears were coming down my face, that I would never truly be able to get over him. My love and concern for him would always be a part of me. I got up and turned off the water. I couldn't go on like this. I couldn't go on dwelling on the past or what should have been. And if I stayed in Denmark, that is what exactly would happen. I got out of the shower, got dressed, and went into my living area and began to pack up. \"Where are you going?\" Clara asked me. \"I'm going home. I'm going back to the US. I can't stay here in Denmark. All I do is think about him, and I swear that I see his face everywhere,\" I said starting to choke up. \"I need to move on with my life and staying here isn't going to help me do that.\" \"Paige, you can't run away from your problems,\" she told me. I stopped packing and thought about what she was saying. She was right. Even if I left Denmark, I wouldn't leave the pain behind me. \"You're going to mourn Eddie. It's completely normal what you are feeling right now. With time, the pain will still be there, but it will become easier. I promise you.\" \"I can't do anything but think about him. How am I supposed to study and concentrate on what needs to be done?\" I asked. \"Everything is still so fresh right now. You'll figure it out. Finish up this semester and I will personally drive you over to the airport to go home after you take your last final,\" Clara told me. \"Thanks,\" I whispered, wiping the tears from my eyes and putting some of my stuff back. \"Sarah and I were talking last night. We could move the sofa bed into her room just so you aren't sleeping in the middle of the living room every night,\" Clara said. \"Okay,\" I said quietly. \"And I'm going to get a job so I can help pay for the rent,\" I said firmly. \"But I was thinking tomorrow that I would go out and start putting in applications,\" I said. See? You're getting a new life together,\" she exclaimed, \"Who knows? Maybe you will decide to stay in Denmark,\" Clara said jokingly. \"Ha-ha,\" I said. That night, Sarah, Clara and I ordered pizza in and The Hunger Games . Even though I was in absolutely no mood to socialize, my friends were trying to hard to get me out of the slump that I was in due to the breakup. We had a good time just us girls, and it helped me take my mind off of everything that was going on for a little bit. After we all said good-night, I laid in the sofa bed and began to think about Eddie. I began to cry silently to myself at some of the memories. I rolled over on my side and felt an intense pain in my breast. I rolled over on the other side and felt the same pain. I laid on my back and wondered why my breasts were so tender. My stomach felt slightly bloated as though I had put on weight. Then my heart felt as though it stopped beating for a few seconds as I thought suddenly crept into my mind. My period came shortly after my last pregnancy scare, but I had never gotten another one after that. I was about three weeks late. I sat up straight quickly and thought as I was going to through up at the thought of being pregnant. I knew last month I was worried about being pregnant, but I didn't have the extreme breast tenderness or slightly bloated abdomen. Could I really be pregnant? Of course this would happen now. Of all time to be pregnant, it has to be when Eddie and I aren't even speaking to each other anymore. I really wished he was there with me that night to comfort me and support me. But that would never happen ever again. I wondered if he would take care of his child or if he would ignore it. I closed my eyes and tried to put it out of my mind. I'd take a test tomorrow just to put my mind at ease. There was no way that this could be happening, right? Chapter 22 I woke up the next morning thinking again that I was in the palace. It didn't take me long to remember that I wasn't. Eddie and I were over, and I may be carrying his child now. My body subconsciously was stressing out about this possibility and woke me up early, at 7:30am. I decided not to go to the bathroom so I could take the test today when I got back. I quickly got dressed and walked to the nearest drugstore. There was hardly anyone in there, and I didn't think that anyone recognized me. I decided to buy two pregnancy tests, just to make sure. I went up the front, tried to avoid eye contact with the clerk, and paid for the tests. \"Good luck,\" the clerk said handing me the bag. \"Thanks,\" I mumbled, putting the bag in my purse. The last thing I needed was to be seen walking down the sidewalk with two pregnancy tests in a bag. I got back to the apartment before either girl had woken up. I was glad. I wanted to do this by myself. I peed in a plastic cup, put the two tests in the cup and quietly paced the bathroom as I waited for time to pass. My heart was pounding in my chest. I was so scared. What if the tests came back positive? I tried to calm myself down and remind myself that the tests could come out negative too. I felt a wave of nausea pass over me. It was either morning sickness, or I was so nervous about the test result. I sat down on the toilet seat and looked out the window trying to distract myself. This wouldn't be happening now, would it? Time was up. I took a deep breath, got up slowly and went to go look at the result. I slowly picked up the one stick and gasped loudly. My heart began to beat even faster than before. \"No, no, no, no, no, no,\" I repeated to myself over and over again. Maybe the one test was wrong. The other one had to be accurate. I picked up the other test and gasped again. My heart sunk a few inches in my chest. There had to be something wrong with both of the tests. This wasn't happening. I tried to convince myself that. This was all a nightmare, right? I would wake up and everything would be fine. But it wasn't a dream. This was reality, and I was pregnant.[Chapter 14] Chapter 22 I cleaned everything up, threw the pregnancy tests away, and sat down on my bed in shock. I was pregnant with Eddie's child; the future king or queen of Denmark was in my womb. I sighed and put my head in between my hands and turned to look out the window with tears coming into my eyes. I subconsciously put my hands on my abdomen where my child, our child, was forming. The test was positive. I still couldn't believe it. How did we let this happen? Should I tell my parents? Should I call Eddie and tell him what was going on? Or should I remain quiet about it and keep it a secret? I could just raise the child on my own and never have to deal with Eddie ever again. I was so overwhelmed with choices, and I really wished that Eddie was here to be with me and help me. By the time the semester ended, I would not be showing yet which would give me the perfect opportunity to leave Denmark and my chapter with Eddie completely in the past. But then, would it be fair for this child not to know who his or her father was and not to have a father in his or her life? I sighed. These decisions were so incredibly hard. Part of me wanted to go to Eddie and tell him, and the other part of me never wanted to see him ever again. I decided to go out for another run to help clear my head. I ended up running toward the palace, trying to get the courage to talk to Eddie. The palace came into view, and I ran toward the back entrance. Of course, it was locked. I thought about calling Soren and asking him to let me in, but I changed my mind as I pulled out my phone. I needed to give this more time. What if I decided to raise the child by myself? Then, it would be better if Eddie never knew about it. I ran back to the apartment and found that Sarah and Clara were both up already. \"You're sure up early,\" Sarah said as I walked back in the door. \"Yeah, I couldn't really sleep,\" I said, taking off my running shoes. \"I thought I heard someone get up early,\" Clara mumbled. \"So, Jake was asking if we all wanted to go out for drink tonight. Want to go?\" Sarah asked me. \"I don't think so,\" I said pouring myself a glass of orange juice. \"Paige, come on, a night will do you some good!\" Sarah said encouragingly. \"You can't hide in here forever. You need to go out sometime.\" \"I know, but I just think I will pass on this one,\" I said butting a bagel. I sighed and put the butter knife in the sink. \"Fine,\" I said giving in, \"but I'll be the DD though,\" I said. \"We're going to the place just down the street! That way we don't have to worry about needing someone to drive,\" Sarah said. She had already planned this out. \"It wouldn't be any fun if you couldn't drink with us!\" I sighed, and I felt tears forming in my eyes. I quickly looked away from Sarah and Clara. \"What's wrong, Paige?\" Clara asked detecting that something was amiss, besides my recent break-up. \"Eddie is a complete asshole in my opinion. He never even gave you the chance to-\" Sarah rambled. \"I'm pregnant,\" I said cutting off Sarah and wiping a few tears from my face. \"What!?\" They both exclaimed in shock. \"Any tabloid that prints that headline will actually be right this time around,\" I said trying to break the tension and trying to keep from crying. \"I took two tests this morning. They were both positive.\" \"Wait, what!?\" Sarah exclaimed again. \"Weren't you guys careful?\" Sarah asked completely shocked. \"Yes, but there was this one time when the condom broke...\" I said trailing off. \"Oh my goodness,\" Sarah said slowly, sitting down. \"It's Eddie's child, right?\" Clara asked. I shot her a look that said \"seriously!?\" \"I was just trying to lighten the tension with a joke!\" Clara said defensively. \"I knew it was Eddie's child.\" \"So, you have the heir to Denmark's throne in your uterus right now?\" Sarah asked. She seemed to be in shock. \"Yeah, I know. The thought it crazy for me too,\" I said sitting down at the table with my breakfast, joining them. \"I don't know what I am more upset about right now- losing Eddie or being pregnant.\" \"What are you going to do? You're going to tell him, right?\" Sarah asked. \"No, I'm not,\" I stated. \"What!?\" They both exclaimed again. \"I'm leaving Denmark at the end of the semester. By then, I still won't be showing. I'll be able to leave and live my life in the US in complete peace and never have to deal with Eddie or Denmark ever again,\" I explained. \"I'm not just saying this because he is the king. Any guy would need to know. Are you really going to keep Eddie's child away from him? I mean, he won't even know that he has a child! Do you think that is right?\" Sarah asked me, apparently disagreeing with my decision. \"If I tell him, he would probably accuse the baby as Jake's. And besides, then we would have to deal with each other the rest of our lives, and there will always be some hard feelings there. I'm not ready to commit to a life of dealing with a man who thinks I cheated on him,\" I said getting emotional. \"Paige, I know you are in shock now, and you are really hurting over everything, but I think you need to give this some more thought. If the places were reversed, wouldn't you be mad?\" Clara said sympathetically. \"That wouldn't be possible since the females carry the baby around for nine months until delivery!\" I exclaimed. \"I mean, let's say you were Eddie for a minute, and he was you. Pretend you find out about the child like ten years later. Wouldn't you be really angry, upset and feel like you missed out on a lot?\" Clara said calmly. \"Yes,\" I said reluctantly agreeing with her. \"I mean, it's your decision, but I think you need to give it some more thought,\" Clara said. \"Fine,\" I mumbled. \"In the meantime, we could think of baby names!\" Sarah exclaimed. \"Not helping,\" I said. \"We need to go grocery shopping,\" Clara said completely changing the topic which relieved me. \"I'll go,\" I said, volunteering. \"Are you sure?\" Sarah asked hesitantly. \"Yeah, I want to be able to help out until I get a job and can start paying rent. Besides, I want to be able to get out of the house anyway.\" \"Well, I was going to take the car since we have a lot of shopping to do. We can split it up and go together,\" Clara suggested. \"Sure,\" I said getting up to wash my breakfast dishes. We ended up going to a supermarket. As I was shopping, I ended up passing the baby isle. I slowed down as I saw a display for a baby carrier with a life-like baby doll in it. The thought of actually have one and having a baby in it made my stomach churn. Was this all really happening? There were a ton of baby toys, clothes, bibs, an overwhelming choice of diapers, high-chairs, breast pumps, and even a crib on display. Panic began to completely set in now. I was going to have to buy these things and use them because I was going to have a baby. A little child who was going to look up to me to take care of it. The thought scared me shitless. I walked down to the next isle to make it look like I wasn't hanging out in the baby section but just passing through it. People in Denmark could easily recognize me. In the next baby isle, I saw a girl who had a big belly and next to her was a man. He had his arms around her belly, and they both seemed to happy together and excited for the new addition into their family. The sight almost made me want to cry. This child was going to be fatherless. No one to call father. If it was a girl, she wouldn't have a father's lap to sit on when he came home from work, no one to walk her down the aisle on her wedding day or dance with her at a father-daughter dance. If it was a boy, he wouldn't have anyone to teach him how to play sports, coach a terrible little-league team, help him with women or a father to role model. I was sure that I would find someone else in the future, but the child would know that it wasn't his or her true father and that would hurt. I sighed and felt an overwhelming urge to cry. I had to tell Eddie about the child. It would be selfish not to tell him for both his sake and the child's sake. I decided that I would have to go before I changed my mind. I would have to go, today. Chapter 23 My heart began to race as the palace slowly began to come into view. I tried to plan the time around when Eddie usually had a break from Parliament. Would he accept me? Would he believe me? Or would he accuse the child of having a different father? I went to the back gate and saw one the maids walking by me. She turned and looked at me strangely. \"Is there any way you could get Soren and ask him to come here?\" I asked. \"Yes ma'am,\" she said walking away. \"Thank you!\" I said. A few minutes later, I saw Soren walking towards me. \"Miss Paige!\" he exclaimed. \"What are you doing here?\" he said as he got to the front of the gate. \"I need to talk to Eddie. Can you get him?\" I just blurted out. \"He's very occupied this moment with an important meeting in Parliament,\" Soren said. \"Come on, Soren. We both know that they have time for a break now,\" I said. Soren sighed. \"He's greeting his date for the Fall Ball, right now. She just arrived,\" Soren said, slightly discouraged. \"His date,\" I said again slowly, trying to comprehend these words. \"Yes, he had to have a date for Fall Ball, in the words of Queen Rosalind. He's greeting Princess Kirsten of Norway, a long time family friend,\" Soren said sighing. \"Ms. Paige, I'm sorry. I know this isn't what you want to hear. They aren't dating, but I was so hoping that you too would have patched things up in time so you could have accompanied him,\" he said. \"Me too, Soren,\" I said sadly, looking down at the ground. \"Should I tell him you rang?\" he asked. \"No, no that's okay,\" I said. \"He wouldn't have seen me anyway. Thanks anyway Soren,\" I said starting to turn away. \"Have you two not spoken to each other since that day?\" he asked me. \"No, we haven't\" I said turning around. \"I tried texting him the night of that day, but he never answered. I haven't had the guts to call him.\" \"Give him a call. He may be more open to speaking to you than you think. He really misses you,\" Soren told me. \"Really!?\" I asked, slightly surprised. \"Of course! He loves you very much!\" Soren exclaimed. \"And I love him very much,\" I said. \"It was good seeing you again, Ms. Paige,\" Soren said, ending the conversation. \"It was good seeing you again too,\" I said turning to leave. \"Soren-\" I said stopping and turning around, \"on second thought, could you tell him that I stopped by today and I would really like if we could just talk,\" I said. \"You can be assured that this message will be delivered to him,\" Soren told me. \"Thanks,\" I said smiling. And with that, we parted and went our separate ways. Chapter 24 Eddie's point of view: \"Your highness,\" Soren told me later that night. I was resting in the sunroom trying to catch up with Kirsten and distract myself from thinking about Paige. \"Yes, Soren,\" I said trying not to be short, but it came out that way. Ever since Paige and I had broken up, I was tended to be unconsciously short with everyone. \"Paige Morgan came by the palace today,\" Soren started carefully. \"Did she?\" I asked slightly surprised, my head perking up. \"Yes, she came by to see you, actually. But at the moment, you were occupied,\" Soren said. \"She wanted me to tell you that she really hopes that you guys can talk.\" \"Is this your ex-fiancé?\" Kirsten said, surprised. \"What nerve she had to be coming back here! Doesn't she know that you don't want her anymore!?\" Kirsten exclaimed, with a slightly mean tone in her voice that annoyed me. \"Was that all she said, Soren?\" I asked. \"Well, during our conversation she did mention that she loves you and misses you,\" Soren said. Kirsten snorted. Apparently, she found this amusing. \"She sure showed you that she loved you when she cheated on you!\" Kirsten exclaimed. \"Was that it, Soren?\" I asked. \"Yes, your highness,\" he said. I put two fingers above my eyes, closed them and rubbed them. I had been under so much stress every since Paige and I broke up. First, I was completely broken hearted and devastated, and my mother kept on mentioning how 'she was right' about Paige. Second, since I was already the king, I was being pressured to find a girl of royal descent and take her as my wife. My mother was hoping that would be Kirsten which was why she was here. The excuse was that she was my date for the Fall Ball, but everyone else knew better, including Kirsten. I had absolutely no attraction to her and barely wanted to be in the same room with her. Yes, we were childhood friends, but that was as far as our history would take us. We would have nothing in our adult lives other than truly just being friends. Although, with those comments that she made about Paige, even being friends with her right now seemed like a challenge. \"Thank you, Soren,\" I said looking up and realizing Soren was still in the room. \"Kirsten, could you give me and Soren a moment?\" I asked. \"Whatever you have to say to him, you can say to me,\" Kirsten said wanting to stay and hear what was going to be said. \"I'd rather this be a private conversation between Soren and myself,\" I repeated again. \"Fine,\" Kirsten said obviously put-out and left the room. I got up and closed the door behind me. \"What is it, your highness?\" Soren asked. \"Please, Soren, call me Eddie or Edvard. I've known you almost my whole life. You don't have to be so formal all the time,\" I said sitting down on the couch next to him. \"Good to know sir,\" he said. I looked at him. \"I mean Edvard,\" Soren said smiling. \"So, what is on your mind?\" he asked me. \"I've just been thinking about Paige a lot,\" I started. \"I really miss her.\" \"I'm sure she has been thinking about you a lot too. I know that she misses you too,\" Soren said. \"What is your advice?\" I asked. \"What do you mean?\" \"Like, do you think we should try to give it another go?\" I asked. \"Even after she cheated on me?\" \"Edvard, there is a possibility that she is innocent. But even if she did kiss that other man and she truly regretted it, I still think she would still be worth fighting for. True love doesn't come around everyday, and you both truly loved each other,\" Soren said sincerely. Tears began to fill my eyes. \"I'll give her a call,\" I said quietly. \"I feel that is a good decision,\" Soren said. \"Emotions aren't as high as before. You've both have time to cool down and think about what you really want.\" I wiped the tears now coming down my eyes and nodded in agreement. \"You'll both make the right decision,\" Soren said patting me on and back and leaving, obviously allowing me time and privacy to call Paige. I composed myself, waited a few minutes, and left the room. I wasn't sure if I should call her or not. I was heading to my room so Kirsten wouldn't bug me for the rest of the night. I couldn't sleep that night. I tossed and turned, thinking about Paige and whether she would want to have a relationship with me again or not.[Chapter 15] Chapter 25 Eddie's point of view: \"Your highness, what do you think about this issue?\" A parliament member asked me. My head snapped back up. I honestly had no idea what he had just asked me or what we had been talking about. Paige had been completely occupying my mind and thoughts lately and thinking about her caused so much pain. \"I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?\" I asked. The member sighed showing some frustration. \"The taxes, what should we do about the taxes?\" he asked. \"Well, I mean, I don't think we should raise them,\" I answered. I wasn't even sure if that was what he was asking. Paige had tried calling me today and left me a voice mail. That was all I could think of. I couldn't bear to listen to it yet and to have to hear her voice but at the same time, I really wanted to hear her voice. The members continued to talk about who knows what and I tried to act interested but the truth was, all I could think about was Paige. I wondered how she was and what she was doing. And mostly, I wondered if she was really telling the truth. That possibility haunted me everyday and every night. The truth was, I wanted to believe her. I truly wanted her along my side for the rest of my life whether here in Denmark or in a small little house in the United States. It hurt to think that the Paige was never the woman I thought she was. It was a betrayal unlike no other. I honestly had no idea what went on in Parliament the rest of the day. The only thing I could think of was, as I said before, Paige, and getting the opportunity to call her back. I really did want to call her and try to talk things through. \"Edvard,\" one of my friends from Parliament, George, called to me as we were leaving. \"Yes,\" I said turning around. I really wanted to get to Paige's message and call her back. I had been in this meeting all day long. \"Are you okay?\" George asked. \"Yes, I'm fine,\" I said trying to brush him off. \"Do you wanna go downstairs to the kitchen and maybe get a beer and we could talk?\" George asked. I hesitated for a few seconds but I agreed. \"So, are you and Paige really done?\" he whispered. \"We'll talk later,\" I answered back. We walked downstairs to the kitchen and I got two beers out of the refrigerator. \"So, how are you? I've never seen you so distracted before in my life and we pretty much grew up together,\" George said sitting down at the table. \"I just can't stop thinking about her,\" I said sitting down next to him. \"And what could have been. And the possibility that Paige was telling the truth,\" I blurted out getting some of it off of my chest. \"What makes you think she was telling you the truth? That picture really told it all,\" George said gently. \"I know, but I've never caught Paige in a lie before. She was always honest. Sometimes too honest sometimes. She's a strong woman, has her mind set on what she wants and she is determined to fulfill all of her goals in life. I remember when I was getting to know her, I was actually intimidated by her. She's so determined but yet so full of life and ready to have fun. It was what I found so attractive in her at first,\" I said sipping my beer. \"I mean what we had was real. I know it was,\" I said firmly. \"Her only flaw was that she would sometimes keep things that were bothering her bottled up inside and would try to put on a front that nothing was wrong. But I think that was because she is such a strong woman, you know? But after a while I could see when she was coming off as being strong when she wasn't on the inside. I just can't believe that it was all a lie. I just can't,\" I said. Part of me wanted to cry but I fought it back. \"Edvard,\" George said gently. \"I don't mean to rain on your parade but pictures don't lie. She had her tongue down his throat. You're wondering what she is doing now? She's probably shacking it up with him on the bed of wherever she is staying.\" \"Don't talk about her like that,\" I snapped. \"It's a reality man that you have to face,\" George said slightly harsh. \"You didn't know her like I did,\" I said getting angry. \"Edvard! She cheated on you! I can't believe you are trying to defend her,\" George exclaimed. The harsh pains of everything that had happened in the past few days came flooding over me like a sea of emotions. I excused myself and went upstairs to my bedroom. I couldn't deal with this anymore. I locked myself in my room and pulled out my phone and pulled up Paige's name. I stared at her name debating about whether I should call her or not. My finger hovered over the dial button but I couldn't do it. George's words haunted me. What if he was right? Instead, I listened to her voice mail. The sound of her voice finally made me cry. She sounded upset, like she really wanted to talk. I thought about calling her that night, but I decided to sleep on it some more. Odds are she would have been busy and not able to talk. I got up early the next morning. I did not sleep the whole entire night but tossed and turned all night long. Paige was in my thoughts, and I couldn't seem to push her out of my mind. I got dressed and went to my office to get some work down. I sat down and stared at a blank word document. I was supposed to address Parliament about taxes tomorrow, but I could not even concentrate. I looked up, and I remembered the last conversation that Paige and I had together in here. I sighed and scrolled through my phone to find her name. It was early, and Paige probably wasn't even up. Her fall break had ended, but I was sure she was still sleeping since her first class didn't start for another hour and a half. Not unless she was like me and couldn't sleep either. After about two hours of working and hardly getting anything done, I walked downstairs to grab a bagel and then I had to get back to work. I'd have to really focus. Maybe I should try writing outside. \"Edvard!\" I heard Kirsten exclaim. I looked over, and I saw her and my mother eating breakfast together in the kitchen. I sighed and walked over to both of them. \"Hello,\" I said. I was standing by them, but I didn't want to sit down and actually join them. \"Edvard,\" Kirsten said standing up and greeted me the European style with a kiss on both cheeks. \"I didn't see you at all last night! I was wondering where you went off to!\" Kirsten exclaimed. \"Kirsten was just telling me how Soren informed you that Paige stopped by yesterday,\" my mother said trying to join the conversation. \"Yes, she did,\" I said. \"Did you see her?\" my mother asked me looking up from the paper, with her eyes piercing into mine. We both knew what answer did not want to hear. \"I did not,\" I said slightly quietly. \"Good. Keep on sending her back whenever she comes,\" my mother said turning a page in the paper. \"I didn't send her back. I didn't even know she came by until it was too late,\" I said starting to get defensive. \"Why on earth would you want to see that girl? She tarnished our name and embarrassed you! I told you she was only here for the fame and glory. You shouldn't have anything to do with her. You need to date women of royal descent. You know Kirsten would make a fine wife and Queen of Denmark,\" my mother said with Kirsten right there. Kirsten stood up straighter in her seat as though it would help me take more notice of her. \"I have to get going,\" I said. I hadn't even gotten anything to eat, but I couldn't stay here anymore with them. \"Edvard, where are you going?\" My mother asked me. \"I can't live like this. I can't live where my entire life is dictated to me, and you tell me who to love and what to do. I can't ever love Kirsten as I loved Paige, and I can't handle all of this pressure you have been putting me to find a bride. I just broke up with my fiancée. Can't you tell that talking about marriage again is the last thing that I want to do?\" I said emotionally. \"Edvard, I know that things have been hard for you recently. But you really have to take into consideration that as King, it is your duty to find a Queen. Now, Kirsten has been a princess her whole life, she understands what it means to be royal, and she would never hurt you the way that Paige did,\" my mother said. \"I refuse to have this conversation in front of Kirsten!\" I exclaimed leaving. \"Edvard, where are you going?\" My mother asked me again. \"I'm going to abdicate the throne, and I'm going to find Paige,\" I said leaving the room. \"Edvard, wait!\" I heard Kirsten yell after me. I ignored her and kept on walking. I decided to go and take a walk outside to clear my head. As I walked, I thought about Paige and all of the good times time we had here in the gardens. All of the good talks that we had and how much we enjoyed each other's company. I sighed and put my hands in my pockets. Was she innocent? And if she wasn't innocent, would I have it my heart to forgive her? If we got back together and I abdicated the throne for her, would be truly live happily ever after? Or should I just give up on Paige and marry Kirsten? I didn't love her, but I supposed I could learn to care for her and eventually love her. Tears began to fill my eyes. Was I really going to give up my future and happiness just to make Denmark happy? Maybe I should just leave the throne for myself- just so that I could have a normal life. I sat down on a bench, and I decided to call her. Maybe we both needed to talk- for closure, to move on, or to figure out if this relationship would work or not. Her phone was ringing, and my heart began to race slightly. Would she answer? \"Hey, you've reached Paige. Sorry I am not available to answer the phone right now, but please leave a message and I will return your call as soon as possible,\" her voicemail recording played. I sighed. Of course, she didn't answer. Why would she when she has a boyfriend? I debated about whether I should leave a voicemail or not. I decided to give it a try. \"Hey Paige,\" I started. I had a million things that I wanted to say to her, but now that I had the opportunity, I didn't know what leave for her. \"It's me,\" I continued. \"Listen, when you get the chance...\" I stopped and sighed. \"Soren told me that you stopped by yesterday and that you wanted to talk. I know that you are hurting and I am too, but maybe things are better this way. Maybe this is fate trying to save us from a lifetime of stress and always trying to patch up our relationship. I don't know...I'm confused too. I don't know why you cheated on me and would like some answers. I think I am going to have hard time forgetting this.\" I stopped not knowing what else to say. \"Listen, if you are ready to talk about what happened, feel free to give me a call.\" There. I hung up with my heart still racing slightly. Was my message good or was it just going to make things worse between us and separate us even farther? Chapter 26 Paige's point of view: \"Paige,\" Sarah said as I was making the morning coffee, \"you really do need to tell Eddie about the baby,\" she said calmly and gently. I sighed and put down the coffee pot. I didn't know what to do, especially after hearing his voicemail. \"He returned my voicemail and message to Soren and tried calling me early this morning,\" I said handing a mug to Sarah and sitting down and joining her at the kitchen table. \"He did!? Did he leave a voicemail? Why didn't you answer?\" Sarah exclaimed, excited. \"I was still sleeping when he called but, he left me a voicemail. He basically began by saying that maybe things were better off this way and that basically, we weren't meant to be together. He said he is going to have a hard time forgetting about this and that he wants some answers. He said when I was ready to explain what happened and give answers to him, I could call him back,\" I said angrily. \"Paige, you have to understand that he thinks that you did cheat on him which is why you need to talk to him,\" Sarah encouraged me. \"I don't want him in my life anyone. I don't him to know about the baby, and I don't want the baby to know about him,\" I stated firmly. \"He's a jerk.\" \"Paige, you don't mean any of that-\" \"I mean every word of it,\" I said cutting her off. \"I'll be better off without him and so will the baby.\" \"Paige, you are in charge of another life now. You need to consider the baby in this decision, and you need to see a doctor and start the pre-natal care. Why don't you call him and talk to him. He tried reaching out to you; he wants to talk. Just see what he has to say and you can explain to him what really happened.\" I rubbed my temples as I felt the tears coming down my cheeks. \"Why did he do this to me, Sarah?\" I asked abruptly. \"Why did he let me go? Does he have any idea about what type of pain I am in everyday?\" I sobbed. \"Paige,\" she said taking my hand and squeezing it. \"Give him a call. You won't regret it.\" \"Fine,\" I grumbled. I got up and walked to my \"bedroom\" to get my phone. He wasn't in Parliament yet, so he should answer. I touched on Eddie's name in my phone. Then I touched on call cell, put the phone to my ear and waited. I didn't know exactly what I was waiting for. It wasn't like he was going to pick up. I was right. I got his voice mail. Hearing his voice was really hard but I kept strong so I could leave a message. \"Eddie,\" I started. I actually I had no idea what I was going to say. \"It's me. I got your voicemail, and I was just really hoping that we could talk,\" I said. This was so much harder than I thought. \"I really miss you Eddie,\" I said starting to choke up. \"I was just hoping that maybe we could talk or try to talk things out,\" I said composing myself. \"I know you're mad at me and you're hurting too but I just ask that you listen to me. Please, call me back,\" I said hanging up. I started to break down. That was so much harder that I had ever imagined. I had never imaged that leaving a voice mail for Eddie would turn into such a hard and painful task. I just sat there and tried to compose myself, but my heart was completely shattered. How was I supposed to carry on this way? Maybe I should just pack up and leave. The pain was just too much. At least in the United States, I would be away from him. No, I told myself. I wasn't going to let this bother me. I was going to function as normally as I possibly could. I wiped away my tears and decided to get ready for my clinical that I started today at the Copenhagen Hospital and then I went to class. If he wasn't going to answer his phone or call me back, then that was his problem and his loss. Chapter 27 Eddie and I had been separated for eight painfully long days. Just when I thought that I would find some solace and peace in class, I discovered the complete opposite. Class was an absolute living nightmare. I heard lots of whispering going on even though it was loud enough where I could here what they were saying about me. And when they weren't talking about me, I could feel all of there eyes on me. I knew that my every move was being scrutinized by my fellow classmates and even my professors. I knew they were all judging me, viewing me as someone who just wanted to marry Eddie for his money and status. But honestly, I was hurting too much to care that much. It was a constant battle to concentrate in class and to keep my mind off of Eddie, but it was extremely hard. I managed to go the whole day without crying until I ran into Jake. \"Paige,\" I heard him yell after me as I was walking down a sidewalk. I reluctantly turned around. I could practically feel the tears coming already. \"Paige,\" he said leaning in to give me quick hug. \"How are you doing? I heard what happened,\" he said being very sympathetic. \"I'm okay,\" I said trying to remain strong. He looked at me skeptically. I knew he didn't believe me. \"Okay, I'm a pretty bad mess,\" I said wiping a quick tear from my eye. I kept on telling myself to be strong. \"So I take it he didn't believe you?\" \"No,\" I said choking up and wiping away another tear. \"Would things helped if I tried to talk to him?\" Jake asked. \"I could clear your name.\" \"Good luck with that. First, the security is so tight around there you wouldn't be able to actually talk to him. And I'm not even sure if he would believe you either let alone actually listen to you.\" \"With all due respect, he sounds stubborn.\" \"Yeah, he is. And I'm even more stubborn. So you put the two of us together,\" I said smiling a little. \"He would be the less-stubborn one though.\" \"Have you tried talking to him at all?\" he asked. \"I tried calling him and left him a voicemail. He called me this morning when I was still sleeping and left me a voicemail too. Basically, he thinks that this is for the best, and he is going to have a hard time forgiving and forgetting. He said that I could call him when I was ready to give him some answers,\" I said slightly aggravated. \"Did you try calling him back?\" Jake asked. \"Yeah, and I left him another voicemail. He hasn't returned my call yet, and I wonder if he honestly will. He made things very clear today- he doesn't want to get back together.\" \"You don't know that for sure. I doubt that he truly feels that way. He loves you,\" Jake said trying to make me feel better. I snorted. \"He already has a date for the Fall Ball coming up soon. I think he is doing just fine,\" I grumbled. \"But doesn't he kind of need a date for those type of things?\" Jake asked. \"Yeah, but...I don't know. I just thought he would have tried to work things out by now so we could go together instead of already finding a new girl...\" \"How long have you guys been a part?\" He asked. \"It'll be nine days today. I thought that things would get easier with time, but they are not. He's still all that I think about...\" \"I understand. I promise that everything will get a little bit easier as time goes by,\" Jake said reassuringly. I wiped a tear away and smiled at him. \"People come and go into our lives. Some come to teach us a lesson while others stay in our lives. Maybe Eddie was just meant to teach you a lesson.\" \"A lesson about what? How the concept of love doesn't exist?\" I asked getting emotional. \"Come here,\" he said embracing me in a friendly hug. \"I think King Edvard is a complete fool for letting a girl like you out of his life. There will be a million girls throwing themselves at him, but there will only be one Paige. I know it hurts now but you have to learn how to move on and forget him.\" \"I can't. I'll always love him,\" I said sniffling. \"That's okay. You can always love him in your heart, but you need to move on, Paige,\" he said gently. We broke a part from our hug. I was still upset, but I felt a little bit better. \"Time moves on and continues no matter what happens. So do you do too. It hurts, but keep on moving on. Go to class, do what you normally do, and make your dreams a reality. You don't need him to do that,\" Jake said gently. \"I saw this quote on Facebook once. It said: 'Sometimes you just have to delete the messages delete the numbers and move on. You don't have to forget who that person was to you; only accept that they aren't that person anymore.'\" \"But Eddie hasn't changed,\" I said. \"It means that you don't have to forget who Eddie was or how much he meant...means to you. You don't have to forget how he was your fiancé, and you don't have to forget how much you loved him. But you have to realize that he isn't that person to you anymore. He'll always be in your heart, but he won't be the things that he used to be,\" Jake explained. I nodded to show that I understood. I wiped away a few tears from my face and those forming at my eyes. Jake was right. I had to move on with my life no matter how hard or how painful it might be.[Chapter 16] Chapter 28 Eddie's point of view: \"Edvard!\" My mother called as she saw me heading down the hallway to my room. I needed to work on my speech that I was going to giving at the Fall Ball within the next week. I honestly had no idea what I was going to say. I knew that many people would want me to talk about my recent break-up with Paige and what my plans for the future. \"Yes, mother,\" I said turning around. \"Follow me into the flower room. I want to have a word with you,\" she said sternly. I knew that I had no choice but to go with her. We sat down in chair across from each other, and I studied her face. She was extremely determined, and I could tell she was not going to budge on whatever she already decided on. \"Edvard, I know you don't like this topic,\" she began. My heart sank. This conversation was going to be about Paige. \"But you have to consider that you are already the King of Denmark. The King has to do what is best for the monarchy, tradition, the people, and not always what is best for himself,\" she stated. \"So, what are you saying?\" I asked, having a feeling as to where this conversation was heading. \"I'm saying that you need a wife, Edvard,\" my mother stated simply. \"I really don't want to talk about this right now. Marriage is the last thing that I want to do,\" I said. My mother sighed and looked at me. \"Edvard, I know that you are upset over Paige. I am too. I excepted more from her, and I was truly happy when I would see how joyous you were around her. I'm sorry; I know that this is hard on you,\" my mother said sympathetically. \"I've been wondering if this was even possible to begin with,\" I said sadly, trying not to cry. \"Oh, Edvard,\" my mother said coming to give me a hug. \"You'll get through this. She doesn't deserve you. You're too good for her. She can go marry that other American boy from the picture in the paper,\" my mother said nonchalantly. \"Do you think that they are serious?\" I asked slightly surprised and worried that her relationship with Jake had been going on for a while now. \"Oh, I don't know, and I don't care! I don't why you do either!\" My mother exclaimed. \"Yes,\" I said quietly, not knowing what else to say. My mother continued to ramble on...something about Kirsten. My mind was completely in another dimension. I just kept on thinking about Paige and whether she was happy or not with Jake. What if she was telling me the truth, and she wasn't involved with Jake at all? \"So, what do you think?\" My mother asked, interrupting my thoughts. \"What do you I think about what?\" I asked, snapping back to reality. \"About marrying Kirsten! The people will want a speech from you on the night of the Fall Ball. That would be the perfect time to announce the engagement!\" My mother exclaimed. \"But, I don't love Kirsten,\" I protested. \"You will learn to love Kirsten in due time. You both already have a history together as childhood friends. Once you both start to view each other as your potential mates, you'll be able to move on from this friendship stage into the next stage of you relationship. I know that Kirsten is already ready to make the transition from friends to being a couple.\" \"There's a difference between dating someone and being engaged to marry them. Marrying someone means that you want to be with them until you die. I'm not ready to make that type of commitment to Kirsten,\" I argued. \"Edvard, you are the King of Denmark. You have to do what is best for the people, the monarchy, and you can't always do what is best for yourself. I'm sorry that it has to be this way.\" \"So, you think that I should marry Kirsten?\" I asked. \"I mean, you could marry any girl of royal descent. It just makes sense to marry Kirsten since you two already know each other. She is already your date for the Fall Ball. Your relationship is already going in that direction,\" my mother explained. \"I don't know, mother,\" I said, slightly frustrated and stressed. \"Give me some time to think about it, okay?\" I asked, trying to pacify her. \"Of course, Edvard. Just remember who you are- the King of Denmark. Now, where is your Queen?\" My mother asked as I approached the door. \"Yes, mother,\" I said, and I left. I walked down the hallway where the portraits of my family for the past generations were hanging on the wall. I stopped where the next portrait would be- my portrait. Except, who would be my queen? Who would be my wife? The mother of my children? Was that person really Kirsten? Or was it someone else? I was feeling so much pressure right now. On top of mourning the loss of Paige, I now had the immense pressure to find a bride. I knew that my mother had a point. Most kings already had a queen by the time they were crowned as the king. It was almost unheard of a country having a king and not having a queen... I walked into the library where I knew that I would be able to find my father. I needed his help and his guidance on this matter. \"Edvard! My boy!\" My father exclaimed as I entered the library. \"Do you need to talk about Paige again?\" my father asked, caringly. I had been confiding in him and talking to him a lot about the pain I was going through with my break-up with Paige. His was the shoulder that I cried on and poured out my feelings to, especially after my break-up(s) with Paige. \"Slightly on that topic.\" I said. \"I never expected this from her...\" I said trailing off. \"Me either,\" my father said gently taking my hand and patting it. \"Mother thinks that I should marry Kirsten,\" I said, blurting out what was on my chest. \"I know. She has mentioned it to me too,\" he said. \"What do you think about it all?\" I asked. \"I know your mother is all worried about what the people think and what it will do to the monarchy. But, Edvard, you have to do what makes you happy. It's your life. If marrying Kirsten will make you happy, then marry her. If getting back with Paige will make you happy, then do that. Life is short. You have to do what makes you happy,\" he explained to me. \"I'm starting to think that fate is making sure Paige and I never get married,\" I explained. \"We broke up once in college when we were dating, then our first engagement was cancelled and now this...\" I trailed off. \"People make mistakes. I honestly don't see the harm in giving Paige a call to see what her thoughts are now. She what she has to say. Maybe she is truly remorseful.\" My ears perked up. My father was being supportive of me getting back together with Paige? \"What I am trying to say Edvard, is that you need to marry whoever will make you happy. Remember, it is until death do you part,\" my father said. \"Are you happy with marrying mother?\" I asked my dad. \"Your mother and I met at a dinner. My father was the Prime Minister of Denmark and the Duke and Dutchess of Amsterdam. I believe we was pressured into marrying me as I was pressured into marrying her.\" \"But, do you love her? Did you love her when you married her?\" I asked. \"I cared for her when I married her. And yes, I do love her, but sometimes I wonder what it would have been like to marry someone who couldn't picture my life without at the time of our wedding,\" he explained. \"To marry someone I truly loved...\" he trailed off, looking pensive. I took his advice to heart. It was my life, and I needed to do whatever made me happy. But why was I so torn between my duty to my country and my duty to my heart? Chapter 29 Eddie's point of view: That evening, Kirsten and I took a walk around the gardens together. I wanted to get to know her better and see if maybe I did have some feelings for her or if I could see myself developing feelings for her. \"Do you remember when we were little, and we used to play hide and go seek in these gardens?\" she asked me. I nodded and smiled at the memory. \"Yes, I do. I also remember hiding so well that you panicked and told my mother that I had disappeared,\" I said chuckling. \"Yes, I do remember that!\" Kirsten exclaimed, smiling. \"So many memories. And now my mother is trying to play a joke on us. She wants us to get married,\" I said chuckling, trying to make a joke out of it. Kirsten stopped and looked at me very seriously. \"What's so funny about that idea? How is that a joke?\" She asked me, her blue eyes staring into mine. \"It's just that we are friends, childhood friends,\" I said. \"But what if we were to be something more? What if we took our relationship to the next level? You're single; I'm single,\" she walked seductively closer to me and began to stroke her hand against my face. \"I love you Edvard, and I haven't seen you as just a friend in quite some time,\" she said, trying to sound sexy. I just looked at her in shock. Was she speaking the truth or was she trying to fool with my feelings? \"Think about it- we've known each other since we have been children. We are both single. You need a bride, and I am available. I think it is fate finally bringing us together,\" she said taking my hand. I just stared at her. I didn't know what to say. I couldn't wrap my brain around this. I suddenly had several flash backs of Paige playing through my head. I saw Paige stroking my face, us holding hands, when we used to walk around these gardens together, and when she would tell me that she loved me. I couldn't see myself doing those things with anyone else. \"Edvard,\" Kirsten said gently cupping my chin. \"Let's finally act on what fate wants us to do. Let's become the next King and Queen of Denmark,\" she said leaning in as though she was about to kiss me. \"I'm sorry; I can't right now,\" I said when her lips were centimeters away from mine. I could already feel her breath upon my lips. \"What?\" She looked up at me surprised and even slightly offended. \"I'm sorry; I just can't do this right now,\" I said walking away from the situation. \"Edvard! Edvard!\" I heard her shriek behind me. \"We are meant to be together!\" She yelled after me. I was to a point where I was walking so fast that I was practically running. I couldn't ever see myself loving Kirsten let along marrying her. I was beginning to believe that she was after me for my power. She wanted to be the next Queen of Denmark. In Norway, she was the third sibling of her parents, so the third in line to the throne. She would never be the Queen of Norway, but she obviously wanted to be the Queen of Denmark. Paige could have cared less if I had a career of picking trash off of the side of the road and lived in my car. She just wanted to be with me and wanted us to be happy. I sighed and then realized that she did cheat on me. So, was she just after my power too? Would any girl in the world just love me for who I was? Chapter 30 Paige's point of view: Eddie had never called me back after I returned his call. I wasn't sure what that meant. Did it mean that he was still willing to work on things or was he now fancying that Norwegian princess that the papers had been printing about and stopped caring about me? Did he already move on in his life? I still hadn't told my parents about my pregnancy, and I dreaded the day when they found out. Even though I had been talking to my mom or dad on a regular basis to help get through this hard break-up, I didn't have the courage to tell them what else was going on in my life. \"I made a doctor's appointment today,\" I told Sarah as she came in the kitchen that morning. I was making coffee and eggs for everyone this morning. \"I have an appointment for next Monday after class.\" \"Good,\" Sarah said. \"Today's Wednesday, so you don't have long to wait. You really shouldn't have waited so long.\" \"I know,\" I said sighing. \"I guess reality was waiting to hit me.\" \"So, how far along do you think you are?\" Sarah asked me. \"I'm probably about 6 weeks or so. Maybe seven. I'm not really sure.\" \"Well, when did you have sex with King Edvard?\" Sarah asked me bluntly. I blushed and part of me wanted to cry. I was never going to kiss him again, let alone sleep with him. \"Oh, I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have-\" Sarah began to say, seeing the reaction on my face. \"No, it's okay. It's what the nurses are going to ask me anyway. I have to get used to talking about my past relations with him, knowing that we will never be together again,\" I said beginning to cry. \"On the bright side, you don't look pregnant!\" Sarah exclaimed. \"I just feel really bloated and really nauseous a lot, especially in the morning. I've only thrown up a few times though,\" I said putting the eggs on a plate and bringing them to her. \"I don't even think I've put on weight.\" \"No, you haven't. I'm not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing,\" Sarah said. \"Well, I'm seeing the doctor on Monday. That's just a few days away.\" \"What are you going to say when they ask you if the father is still involved in your life?\" \"I'm going to say no. They can't report anything. That would violate the whole patient confidentiality agreement. So, I don't have to worry about that happening,\" I said. \"Let's just hope you don't get a doctor who's wants to get fired and make some money off of selling your medical charts,\" Sarah said laughing, and I joined in with her. \"Who else knows?\" she asked me. \"Just you and Clara,\" I said. \"No one else. Not even my parents.\" \"Well, you are going to have to tell them eventually along with Eddie.\" \"I know,\" I said quietly. I sighed and began to clean up the pan that I used this morning to make the eggs. My morning sickness was really bad this morning and eating was the last thing that I wanted to do. But I knew that I needed to eat so the baby could get his/her necessary nourishment. I thought about stopping at the coffee shop on my way to the bus stop to get a croissant and a coffee. My stomach churned at the thought of food, and I found myself running for the bathroom, my morning sickness taking over. As I cleaned up and left the bathroom, I wondered how Eddie would react along with my parents. I also wondered if Eddie would remain involved in the child's life or if he would just show up every few years and feel as though he did his job as a parent. Also, I wondered if I knew that I was pregnant before we broke up, if Eddie would have believed me that I did not kiss Jake... These questions flooded through my mind as I packed up my book bag and left for class. Eddie and I had only been separated for eleven days, but it felt like an eternity. Chapter 31 Eddie's point of view: After two sleepless nights, I had made a decision. My mother was right. I was the King of Denmark. I needed to start doing what was expected of me. I needed to start acting like the king. And as the king, I needed a wife. I honestly knew that I did not have the time to start the whole dating process over again, so after 48 hours with absolutely no sleep and several hours spent crying over Paige, I had decided to go through with the wedding to Kirsten. I kept on trying to convince myself that this was the correct decision. Kirsten was a nice girl and would be a good queen, and with time, I was sure that I would love her as much as I loved Paige. It was just that the wedding would come first and then love. My stomach churned at the thought of marry Kirsten, and my heart raced slightly. I had no romantic connection to Kirsten. But maybe they were hidden deep down inside me? Maybe they would develop with time? What if I spent the rest of my life married to a woman who I did not even love? I tried to push away these feelings and stop panicking. For once in my life, I had to be making the correct decision. But if I was making the right decision, why did it feel so wrong inside? It was early, about 6:30am, but I decided that I needed to go ahead and get up. I had to face the day like a big boy, like the King of Denmark. I tried the dating scene, and it was a complete disaster. Now, it was time to face my consequences and take action. Kirsten was going to be my queen and my wife. I felt tears swell up into my eyes at that thought. Kirsten would be the mother of my children, the woman next to me in my portrait which would be seen for generations to come, the queen, and wife...and not Paige. Paige was still all I thought about. I wanted to call her back; I really did. But honestly, I was afraid. I was afraid that Paige was telling the truth, and I would feel and look like a complete idiot for letting her go. What if she didn't want me back? What if she was angry at me for not believing her? On the other hand, I was also afraid that Paige would admit to cheating on me with Jake. How would I handle that? What if she still wanted to get back together? And if we did, would I ever be able to forgive her? My head was spinning with all these questions. I decided that it was my lack of sleep and some coffee would help me wake up and think clearer. I walked down the street and to the local coffee shop. I needed a place where I could just sit down and think. I ordered and waiter for my coffee and sat down trying to convince myself that I had made the correct decision. As I sat down at my table, I saw George walk into the coffee shop as well. He saw me and slowly approached me. \"Hey man,\" he said sitting down, \"I'm really sorry about yesterday. I shouldn't have said those things about Paige.\" \"You were just trying to help me see everything through a different perspective,\" I said sighing. I rubbed my temples slightly. I had this pounding headache this morning, probably from not sleeping and spending most of the night last night mourning the loss of Paige in my life. \"Are you okay? Your eyes look puffy, and you look exhausted,\" George said sipping his coffee. \"I've had a couple rough nights with no sleep,\" I mumbled. \"Why aren't you sleeping?\" George asked me. \"Is it because of Paige?\" \"I've had all this pressure put upon me to get married since I'm already the king,\" I said keeping my voice down so no one would overhear me. \"Well, what are you going to do? Accept an arranged marriage?\" George asked jokingly. \"Something like that,\" I replied, and I saw George's eyes widen. \"My mother thinks that Princess of Kirsten of Norway and myself would be a good match. I've been giving it some thought, and I think my mother is right. Last night, I decided that I will go through with the marriage to Kirsten,\" I explained. George's look of shock on his face made me doubt my decision even more. \"Why would you agree to that!?\" He exclaimed. \"You don't have-\" \"No, I'm king, and it is about time that I start acting like it,\" I said firmly. \"Do you love Kirsten?\" George asked me. I'm sure he was wondering if we had some secret love affair going on. \"No,\" I said sighing. \"I don't love her, but I'm sure with time that I will develop feelings for her and love her,\" I said trying to convince myself with those words. \"So, you are willing to enter a loveless marriage for the sake of Danish Monarchy that will honestly do fine without a queen for a few years until you find someone that you do love?\" He asked me, trying to show me how irrational my thinking was. \"Don't put it like that,\" I said. \"Look, I'm the only king in Europe at the moment who doesn't have a queen. People expect me to get married and to have a queen help me,\" I said. \"Kirsten has experience; she knows what will be expected of her. She is a nice girl, and the people will love her-\" \"You sound like she just filled out a job application to be your wife, and you are the hiring manager. Experience? Really, Edvard? The people will love her? The question is whether you will be able to love her or not! You will be married to her! Not Denmark! You're not thinking straight, Edvard. You are hurt, and you are heartbroken. You think that this engagement to Kirsten will help you heal, move on, and forget about Paige, but it won't. It may only make things worse.\" \"So, what are you proposing that I do?\" \"That you wait until you find someone that you love to marry. Do you love Paige?\" George asked me as though he wasn't sure what the true answer was to the question. \"Yes, of course I love Paige. That was never a question,\" I said. \"Then what is the question?\" He asked. \"The question is if she loves me or if she was just using me,\" I said sighing. This was exhausting. \"Edvard,\" George began gently. \"Talk to Paige. That is the only way that you are going to get some peace. Talk to her either for closure or talk to her to try to see what happened and discover the truth. The tabloids can print whatever they want, but only Paige and Jake know the truth. Maybe even talk to them both, I don't know. I just hate seeing you like this. You need some type of closure or resolution before you rush into marrying someone that you don't even love.\" I looked out the window solemnly. I saw a girl with short brown hair on the other side of the street. My heart skipped a beat; my mind believing that it was Paige. However, it wasn't Paige. It never was Paige. I saw her face wherever I went. Her smile on everyone. I swore I saw her eyes just now... \"Earth to Edvard!?\" George exclaimed, waving his hand in front of my face. \"Sorry, I thought I saw-\" \"I know, Paige,\" he finished the sentence for me. \"She's on your mind all the time. I know she is. And you want to marry someone else just for the sake of being married!?\" George exclaimed, once again, showing me the irrationality behind my decision. \"I don't think,\" I said trying not to cry, \"that I will be able to love anyone as much as I love Paige,\" I explained. \"It's just not possible. She was my everything. I can't see myself falling in love with anyone else. I fear that if I don't marry Kirsten, I won't ever get married because every girl that I will date, I'll just compare her to Paige,\" I confessed. George looked at me in surprise. \"You can't use Kirsten to escape from your problems. Don't go through with the marriage, Edvard. It will be a mistake. I say that if you still-\" \"Can I get a cappuccino to go?\" I heared a familiar voice ask, and I stopped listening to George. My heart began to pick up speed again. I knew that voice, and I knew who it was. It was Paige. \"Edvard?\" George asked, seeing the surprised expression on my face. \"Are you even listening to me anymore!?\" He exclaimed. Then, he turned around and saw why I wasn't saying anything. Neither of us said anything. A million thoughts were running through my mind. She didn't seem to see me. I wasn't sure if I should say something or not. I really wanted to go up to her, but I wasn't sure if that would be welcomed by her. Honestly, I wanted to kiss her, hold her, tell her how much I loved her, and that I wanted to work things out with her. I had a million conversations with her in my head of all the things that I wish I could have said. Now, that I had the opportunity, I couldn't find a single word to come out of my mouth. She paid, turned around in my direction, and froze in place. Now, she had seen me. I had to do something. Someone had to say something. We couldn't just stare awkwardly at each other until her coffee was ready. \"Paige,\" I said motioning for her to come over and join us. She seemed reluctant at first and almost even hesitant, but she decided to come. \"Hey, how are you doing?\" she said as she approached our table, being polite. \"Fine,\" I lied. \"And yourself?\" I asked. \"Fine,\" she stated simply. Awkward silence fell. No one wanted to make the first move. It was like being back in college all over again. No one wanted to act first. No one wanted to have the inevitable conversation. \"Please, sit down and join us,\" I said jumping up to pull over a chair for her. \"No, it's fine. I was just on my way to my clinical anyway. The bus that I take to the hospital will be here any minute. I don't want to be late,\" she said. \"Oh,\" I said sitting back down. \"Where is your clinical assignment at?\" I asked. \"Copenhagen Hospital,\" she replied. \"And once I finish there, I hop back on the bus and go to the university for my classes, do my homework and studying in the library, and then I go back home and repeat the following the day,\" she said. Her tone tried to be cheerful, but she wasn't the old Paige that I knew. I could tell that she was tired and very sad as well. She tried to hide it, but I knew her too well. Her sparkle was absent from her eye. She looked out the window, and we both saw the bus coming down the road. \"That's actually my bus,\" she said sheepishly. I could tell that she didn't want to go and neither did I. \"It was good seeing you again, Eddie. I miss you,\" she said turning to leave. \"It was good seeing you again too,\" I replied. And with that, she walked out the door and down the street with the coffee in her hand. Seeing her walk out the door made me want to cry. It was like saying good-bye and breaking up with her all over again. It was like all the wounds that had made some progress healing opened up again. Was I really going to let her just walk out the door like that again? Was I going to make the same mistake twice? \"What am I doing?\" I asked myself out loud as I jumped out of my chair and ran out of the shop and down the street to the bus stop. I saw Paige standing by the bus, getting ready to board with her bus pass in her hands. \"Paige!\" I yelled trying to stop her from boarding. She didn't seem to hear me and got closer to the bus. She was almost on now. \"PAIGE!\" I yelled again, louder with desperation in my voice, running even faster down the street. She stopped, turned around, and looked at me, surprised. She got out of line, and I continued to run towards her. I wasn't going to let her go twice without at least talking to her. Seeing her again made me realize that I couldn't marry Kirsten. I didn't love her, but I loved Paige. How could I marry someone who I didn't love? I reached Paige and stopped running. Neither of us said anything, but she looked at me surprised and expectantly with her big, beautiful brown eyes that I hadn't seen in a while. I knew she was waiting for me talk. There had to be a reason as to why I ran down the street calling her name. \"Are you okay?\" I blurted out. I honestly had no idea why I just did that. \"You ran down the street calling my name to ask me if I was okay?\" Paige asked, confused. Man, did I miss her spirit. \"No, listen, Paige,\" I said pulling her off to the side, \"I love you,\" I blurted out. Her eyes widen, and her disposition softened. She saw that I wasn't here to attack or accuse her of anything. \"And I really would like to talk to you and see how you feel about our relationship and if it is worth saving. You're all I think about. I'm sorry that I haven't called you back, but I was being a coward,\" I confessed. \"I was afraid of you telling me something that I didn't want to hear. But whatever your answer is, I'm prepared for it, and I'm ready to talk and work through it as a couple. Is there anyway I could talk to you tonight?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" she said, relieved. \"Yes,\" she said again with more emotion, leaning in to hug me. I accepted her hug and held her tight as though she would disappear from my arms. I could feel myself getting emotional, and I'm sure she was too. \"Can I pick you up from the library at 7?\" I asked. She nodded, wiping a tear away from her face. The last person boarded the bus, and the bus honked its horn. \"I need to get going. I'm sorry,\" Paige said as she slowly walked towards the bus. \"Tonight,\" I said as she walked away. \"Tonight,\" she said turning around, smiling. This time, when I watched her walk away, I didn't feel the intense pain in my gut as last time. This wasn't going to be good-bye. It was just going to be until we see each other again. And even if we didn't get back together, at least we would go on our separate ways on good terms. Any input thus far is very much appreciated! I truly enjoy reading all of your reviews! And if you have any ideas for the story, please send them my way as well! Should Paige and Eddie get back together? Or are they better off going their separate ways?[Chapter 17] Chapter 32 Paige's point of view: I had finished my clinical, gone to my classes, and now I was in the library waiting anxiously for 7:00pm. My pregnancy symptoms were really bad today. I had back pain, horrible cramps, even worse than during my regular period, and I was very nauseous. I just hoped that Eddie didn't want to go out to eat tonight I didn't think I could keep anything down. I wondered if my symptoms were normal. \"I have these horrible cramps, and I can't keep anything down today. Is this normal?\" I texted Sarah. I put my phone down and studied as I waited for her reply. My head perked up when I heard my phone buzz. \"I don't know. You're the one who is medical school. What does the internet say?\" she replied. \"I've been getting mixed answers. Can you ask your mom? She is an OBYGN in the US, right?\" I texted back. \"Yeah. I'll call her and get back to you. You really need to tell who needs to be told...aka Edvard and your parents,\" she replied. \"I know. I'm just not ready to tell my parents yet. I'm actually going to see Edvard tonight. I'll tell him if the time is right,\" I replied. \"WHAT!? YOU ARE GOING TO SEE EDVARD!?\" She immediately responded. \"When did this happen?\" \"Today. I'll tell you about it later. Too much to tell!\" I responded. \"Well, I REALLY hope that you guys work things out!\" Sarah exclaimed. \"Me too :-)\" I replied. I went back to my work, trying to concentrate. I was honestly really nervous about meeting Eddie tonight. Would he believe me? Or would he just tell me that he couldn't? I wondered if I should go back home and change. I was wearing skinny jeans and a fitted orange t-shirt with flip flops. It wasn't exactly a date outfit but a comfy outfit. I sighed and looked at the time. It was about 6:20pm; Eddie would be here soon. I didn't have time to walk back home, change, and walk back. I began to gag, my symptoms overtaking me. I got up and ran to the bathroom, just barely making it. I honestly really just wanted to leave and go to bed. I felt horrible. But, I couldn't cancel on Eddie. He would think that I didn't want to get back together with him. I walked to the sink, cupped water in my hands, and rinsed out my mouth. Then, I took some of the breath mints from my pocket and threw them in my mouth. I didn't want Eddie smelling the vomit on my breath and questioning me about it. I walked back to my table where I was studying at and sat down. I sighed and put my hands on my forehead. Should I Eddie about the baby tonight? Would that be a good idea or would that make matters worse? Could it lead to another argument? The clock was ticking away, and I packed up my book bag. As I was putting my books away, I found a red scarf thrown at the bottom of my book bag. I decided to put it on to help dress up my very casual outfit. I quickly finger combed my hair, and I walked down the stairs and out the front door of the library. Suddenly, it felt as though my stomach had dropped a few levels and my heart picked up pace slightly. What if tonight was a complete disaster? What if Eddie had changed his mind and decided not to show up? I sat down on the lower part of the wall that framed the outside of the library and waited. I pulled out my phone and saw it was 7:00 exactly. I began to worry if Eddie would truly show up. I pulled out a textbook and began to read it. I didn't want it to look like I was just sitting and desperately waiting for him. I looked at the time on my phone again, it was 7:04. Panic began to sweep into me. Part of me wanted to cry. He was always on time. Eddie wasn't going to show up, was he? I continued or tried to read my book, not paying attention to the time. At 7:07, I felt my phone vibrate. I pulled it out and saw a text from Eddie. \"So sorry! I got held up in Parliament. They were arguing over taxes. I'm on my way now. I'll see you soon,\" it read. \"See you soon,\" I answered. I felt as though a weight had been lifted off my chest. Eddie wasn't standing me up. He truly did care. Now, the panic of seeing him again took over. How would tonight go? Would he be happy to see me? Or would he be upset? Angry? A mixture of everything? In less than ten minutes, I saw Eddie's car pull up to the library and park in one of the parking spots. My stomach churned slightly. Ready or not, here I went. I stood up, swung my back pack over my shoulder, and began to walk towards his car. I approached the passenger's side of the car and opened the door. I got in the car, put my book bag on the floor, closed the door, and turned to Eddie. My heart was racing so fast at this point, and I honestly wondered if Eddie could hear it. \"Hey,\" I said smiling at him. \"Hey,\" he said leaning towards me as though he was going to kiss me but them pulled back. \"Sorry, habit,\" he mumbled as he started the car and put it in reverse. I hoped that by the end of the night, we did kiss. I missed him so much that it hurt. We drove in silence for a few moments, just mostly through the parking lot, but it felt longer, until I finally broke the ice. \"So, how have you been?\" I asked him. Why was starting a conversation so hard to do? A little less than two weeks ago, I was going to marry this man for crying out loud! \"The usual,\" he said trying to turn left onto the main road from the library entrance, \"I've been busy with Parliament and everything. I think they want to raise taxes again, not sure,\" he said honestly. I stifled a giggle. \"You're not sure?\" I asked him, dying to tease him about this. He sighed. \"I haven't been good at concentrating on things lately. I miss you, and you have been occupying my thoughts,\" he confessed to me. \"Oh,\" I said quietly, taken aback by his honesty. I wasn't really sure how to respond, but I decided that I would return the same honesty. \"I've hardly been able to get any schoolwork done either. You're all that I have been thinking about too,\" I said. \"I hated how we left things,\" I explained. There were also other things that were keeping me from thoroughly studying for my classes, but maybe I would explain that part later tonight if the time was right. \"So, was that really you in the picture?\" Eddie abruptly asked me. I was slightly surprised by the suddenness of this question, but I figured it was coming sooner or later. \"No, it isn't,\" I said sternly. Eddie had to believe me tonight! He had to! I don't think I could handle knowing that he did not believe me, even with another opportunity to explain. Although, I was sure it was hard for him to believe that it was fake. I'm not sure if I would be able to believe him if the positions were reversed. \"You know I find that hard to believe,\" he admitted to me, voicing my thoughts. \"I know,\" she said simply. \"I know you find it hard to believe, but one day, I hope you find out that I am telling the truth. I love you Eddie. I would never do anything to hurt you like that,\" I said from my heart. \"I never kissed him,\" I said sincerely. Eddie sighed again. \"You really think someone would hate us so much as to Photoshop a picture like that?\" he asked. \"I wouldn't like to think so, but obviously, yes,\" I said. I knew who would do it- Rosalind. She hated my guts since the day I walked through the palace doors. She would do anything to get rid of me. This is what I was thinking, but I didn't voice my thoughts. I would have to save it for another time. Attacking his mother at this time probably wasn't the best idea. \"Why would someone do that?\" he asked me, obviously still not quite believing me. \"I don't know,\" I stated simply. \"You said once that people would try to tear us a part, and that we would always have to stand by each other. I think this is one of those tests that you were talking about,\" I explained. \"Why someone would be so determined to tear us apart; I have no idea.\" \"So, you and Jake aren't romantically connected at all?\" he asked me. \"Not even an attraction?\" \"No,\" I said firmly. \"Eddie, I hope that you would know me well enough by now to know when I am lying and when I am not. Actually, when I have ever lied to you? I understand where you are coming from, but it kind of hurts that you don't believe me,\" I said honestly. \"Jake is just someone I have gotten to know from class. He's good friends with Sarah and Clara, but he isn't romantically involved with either of them,\" I said trying to watch the expression in his eyes. I was wanting to see if he was believing me or not. You can tell a lot by people's eyes. \"I don't know how to prove it, Eddie. You have to take my word, believe me and know that I love you enough not to hurt you or betray you at all, and especially not like that\" I said. My words seem to make an impact on him. He seemed to relax some. He wasn't trying to attack me, but I could tell that he was tense by the way he was carrying himself. My heart began to slow down slightly. This conversation wasn't completely disastrous...yet. \"It's just that...the picture...\" he began and then trailed off. I sighed. I was getting slightly frustrated. \"I know it looks real. And if the positions were reversed, I would probably be giving you a really hard time too. I understand where you are coming from, but if you want to mend our relationship, you have to believe me. I honestly don't think that I could have a relationship with you if you never did truly believe me on this issue. I can't marry a man who thinks I am a liar,\" I said sternly to him. My voice showed that I was beginning to be frustrated. \"I'm sorry that I didn't call you back that last time,\" Eddie said to me, changing the subject. \"I was being a coward,\" he confessed. \"Why were you afraid to call me back? I obviously wanted to talk,\" I asked him. \"I was afraid of two things. The first would be that you admitted to kissing Jake. I wasn't sure how to deal with that. The second was that you said that you did not kiss him. I wasn't sure if I would believe that,\" He confessed to me. \"Do you still not believe me?\" I asked him, wanting to know. My heart was racing again at this moment. Part of me did not want to hear his answer. \"Do you want to mend our relationship?\" he asked me, avoiding my question. \"Of course, I do!\" I exclaimed. \"I would really appreciate it if you could answer my questions,\" I said firmly but nicely. \"Do you still not believe me? And do you want to mend our relationship?\" My heart began to race again. I knew that this time he could not avoid my questions. This was my moment of truth. These questions would help determine my future, and I wasn't sure if I was ready to hear that yet. \"Yes, I do. To both questions,\" he said turning to look at me, smiling. He took my hand and gently kissed it. His lips against my hands sent some sparks throughout my body. I wanted nothing more than to kiss him right there and then. But first, I needed to make sure that he really did believe me, and he wasn't just telling me he did. \"Really?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I love you, Paige Morgan,\" he said turning to look at my eyes. \"I love you, and I want us to resolve this and move on because I want to be with you,\" he said sincerely. \"I feel the same way,\" I said putting a strand of hair behind my ear. \"Eddie, if I had cheated on you with Jake, I would have been honest with you. I would have told you the truth. In fact, I would have left long before the news media would have printed something because if I was attracted to another man and wanted to act on it, then it would mean there was something wrong with our relationship. And I wouldn't want to live being unhappy with you. I'm here for you and not for the \"fairy tale\" part of it,\" I said putting fairy tale in quotation marks. \"You know me- I would have told you the truth and left,\" I said honestly. \"I wouldn't want to live unhappily with someone who I didn't care about. Eddie began to chuckle. \"What's so funny?\" I asked smiling. \"You have a very valid point there. I can't believe I didn't think of that. You would never live a lie. If you wanted to be with Jake, you would have left me faster than a hot potato on your dad's plate at Thanksgiving,\" he said laughing at his own joke. My dad loved potatoes and ate his very fast last Thanksgiving. I playfully hit him on the arm, laughing. \"He didn't eat it that fast,\" I said smiling. \"It was pretty fast,\" he said still chuckling. \"Well, they were good!\" I exclaimed. \"Yes, it really was.\" \"I've missed you so much!\" He exclaimed, being serious but smiling at me. \"I've missed you too,\" I said, smiling back at him. \"If you don't mind, we can take a walk around here in this park. We can sit down somewhere and really talk,\" Eddie said pulling into the parking lot. \"I was wondering where we were going,\" I responded. \"I honestly didn't know until about a minute ago. I was driving, but I didn't know where to go,\" Eddie said chuckling. \"I was worried that you may have stood me up as I was driving to come and get you. Especially, since I was late,\" Eddie confessed to me. \"I was afraid you were going to stand me up,\" I said. It was funny how we were both afraid of the same thing happening. It showed how much we both cared. We got out of the car and began to walk around the gardens in the park. Eddie took my hand, and I turned to smile at him. We walked to a slightly secluded bench surrounded by flowers and a bridge over a small creek. On the bench, Eddie sat close by my and still held my hand. I wished that he would sit closer and put his arm around me. I missed his touch so much. \"I'm sorry that I didn't believe you before,\" Eddie told me. \"I don't blame you. I would have had a hard time believing you if the positions were reversed. Do you still have doubt?\" I asked. Eddie hesitated for a second, thinking about his answer. \"Would you be mad at me if I said a little bit?\" Eddie asked hesitantly. \"No, but just remember that if I did kiss Jake, I would be honest with you and told you the truth. I wouldn't play this game with you. You know I'm not here for any fame or fortune. Those are the last things that I want in life. I just want to be with someone who I love and have a family with, finish medical school, and fulfil my dreams and make a difference in this world,\" I said sincerely, looking at him in the eyes. For some reason, what I said to Eddie this time seemed to really hit his heart. I could tell that he truly believed me. He looked like he was about to cry. \"Paige, I'm so sorry,\" he said, embracing me tightly. \"I'm so sorry that I didn't believe you before and that I put you through all this pain,\" he sobbed in my shoulder. \"I don't have a doubt in my mind now. I just know what a jerk I have been to you for closing you out. Can you every forgive me for this?\" he asked me, looking at me with tears streaming down his face. \"Of course,\" I said, crying now too. \"You were put in a hard situation. The picture does look real,\" I said wiping the tears off his face. \"I love you so much Paige Morgan,\" he said wiping my tears off my face now gently with his thumbs. \"I want us to go back to way that things were. I want to marry you, watch you become the best doctor that Denmark has ever had, have children with you, and grow old with you.\" \"I can't imagine my life any other way,\" I replied. \"I love you so much Edvard Williams,\" I said gently stroking his cheek. \"I will never stop loving you.\" Eddie gently cupped my chin and pulled me to his face. We both closed our eyes and leaned in for a kiss. At first, it was very gentle and sweet, but I began to kiss him harder and with more passion. Eddie immediately followed my lead and began to kiss me deeper; our tongues exploring each others mouths. I never wanted this moment to end. I pulled Eddie's head closer to mine, not wanting any free space between us. The feeling was completely electric. I felt all tingly all over my body with extra electricity wherever Eddie placed his hands. Our kissing was probably too intense and passionate for being out in public, especially since he was the King of Denmark. However, I did not care at all. I forgot about all of my aches and pains and just wanted to be with Eddie. I never wanted him to stop kissing me, and I never wanted this moment to end. Our lips separated for a half a second, and Eddie moved his lips to my neck, planting kisses down to my collarbone and gently sucking on the skin. \"Don't stop,\" I moaned. \"I think we should move to somewhere more private,\" Eddie whispered in my ear, breathless. His breath on my skin made me shiver. \"Don't stop,\" I whispered to him, finding his lips and resuming our hot, passionate kissing. After a few minutes, I decided that Eddie was right, and we should either slow down or move to a private spot somewhere when I found myself unbuttoning a few buttons on Eddie's shirt. I broke apart and planted gently kisses down his jawline, neck, collarbone and a few on his moderately exposed chest. Then, I buried my head in his chest, inhaling his scent that I had missed so much. I was breathless, and I wanted nothing more than to feel his lips on mine again except this time to do more than kiss. Eddie began to gently stroke my hair. \"Paige, I have a question for you,\" he said seriously, lovingly moving his fingers through my hair. \"Sure,\" I replied, not sure where this was going. \"The fall ball is tomorrow, and I would love it if you could accompany me to the dance,\" he proposed. I hesitated slightly. The last thing I wanted was to be back in the public eye even more than I already was. Plus, I had my clinical that morning and classes, even though I finished by noon. Friday's were usually my day to relax, and I hadn't been feeling well. I didn't want to overrun and exhaust myself. That could have serious consequences like losing the baby. A small detail was also that I did not have a dress. Was this the right time to tell Eddie about the baby? But we still weren't officially together, and I didn't want us getting together because of the baby. Sure, we were obviously back together as though we were a couple, but no one mentioned anything about being engaged again. I wanted us to decide to get married because of us- because we wanted to be together. \"Isn't that Norwegian Princess your date for the ball?\" I asked. \"She was until I realized what a mistake I had made by letting you go,\" he said. \"May I please have the honor of dancing with you and being your date for tomorrow?\" He asked me. When he put it like that, there was almost no way that I could say no. \"How will your mother feel about me coming back to be with you?\" I asked being slightly serious, but also trying to tease him and lighten the mood. Eddie chuckled. \"I don't give a damn about what she thinks or what anyone thinks,\" he replied, taking my hand and kissing it gently. \"I'll go on one condition,\" I said looking up at him playfully. \"And what would that be?\" He asked, slightly confused, not catching my drift. \"That you kiss me again,\" I said sitting up and inching my face closer to his. \"I think I can abide gladly with that request,\" he said cupping my chin and bring my lips to his. We stayed lip-locked for a few minutes until we both decided that it was time to get up. We took a walk along the trail of the park, hand in hand, telling each other everything that happened in the past few days. He told me about his mother wanting him to marry Kirsten and how he almost went through with it since he couldn't see himself falling in love with anyone else besides me. He told me how she tried to kiss him, and how George tried to talk him out of his crazy decision. I told that Jake did hug me after he found out what happened to show that I was being completely honest and open with him. I couldn't bring myself to tell him about the baby yet. I told him about my classes and my new clinical assignment and how much I was enjoying it. I told him about how Sarah and Clara welcomed me into their apartment and how supportive they were during the hard time. I explained how I truly valued their friendship and considered them to be good friends. It was as though nothing ever happened between us. We were truly able to pick up right where we had left off in our relationship. Then why I didn't have the courage to tell him about the baby that I was carrying inside me?[Chapter 18] Eddie and I arrived back to the car after our long walk throughout the park. As we approached the car, Eddie opened the passenger's side for me. I swore I saw a light flash in the corner of my eye as I got in the car. Probably the paparazzi stalking us around. I wondered if they saw Eddie and I doing some pretty heaving making out earlier and if we were somewhere private instead of public, I doubted that we would have stopped at just kissing. Eddie got in the car and immediately began to kiss me passionately with his one hand on my cheek and his one hand moving up and down my back slowly and affectionately. \"Wait,\" I said breaking apart. \"I saw a flash go off in the corner of my eye. The paparazzi is here somewhere,\" I said. \"It's okay. The windows are completely darkened. They can't see in even if they came right up to the window. It was designed that way,\" he said leaning in to kiss me again which I gladly welcomed. It was like we were a brand new couple in love that could barely keep our hand off of each other. Eddie began to slow down in his kissing. We both knew that we would have to get going soon. If we stayed in the car much longer, there would be a story tomorrow about it and assumptions on what we were doing in there. \"So- how do you get back to where you are staying?\" Eddie asked me. \"Go back to the University and then turn left on Main Street. It's the big apartment complex there on your right. You can't miss it,\" I explained. \"I just needed to know just in case you feel asleep on the ride back,\" Eddie said turning to look at me and laughing. \"Haha,\" I said smiling back. \"I'm not going to fall asleep,\" I said firmly. \"We'll see about that,\" Eddie said looking straight ahead but smiling. We arrived at the apartment complex, and Eddie followed me up the stairs and to Sara and Clara's room. \"Goodnight, Paige,\" he said gently stroking my cheek and leaning in to kiss me. \"You can come in if you want. Maybe we can watch some TV or something like we used to,\" I said looking into his eyes. The truth was, I wasn't ready for him to leave yet. \"I wasn't ready to say good-bye yet either,\" he said, obviously reading my mind. I smiled at him and turned the key in the doorknob, and we entered. I saw Sara sitting on the couch, watching TV with an open textbook on her lap. \"Paige!\" She exclaimed. \"You're back already! How did things with Edvard go-\" She stopped in mid-sentence when she saw Eddie come in behind me. \"Hello,\" Eddie said standing beside me. \"Oh my goodness! My apartment is such a mess, and the King of Denmark is standing in my living room,\" Sarah said trying to make a joke. \"Your apartment looks fine. I've seen Paige's room before, so it's okay,\" Eddie said chuckling. I hit him playfully in the chest, smiling at him. \"Sorry, I thought you were coming home later. But I invited him for a little bit, if that's okay,\" I said. \"Of course!\" Sara exclaimed. \"I got off work early, but I was just watching some TV. Paige, why don't you come back with me in the kitchen, and we can get some drinks,\" Sara said. \"Okay,\" I said following her. I knew that she wanted me to follow her. \"Well,\" Sara immediately said as we entered the kitchen. She was genuinely happy and excited for me. I gave her a thumbs-sign sign and gave a giddy laugh out of happiness. \"Red wine okay?\" She asked me, getting some wine glasses out. \"I can't,\" I mouthed to her. \"Oh,\" she said putting her hand over her mouth as though to prevent herself from saying something. \"You haven't told him yet?\" she whispered so low that I could barely hear her. \"I couldn't,\" I mouthed back. \"If we get back together, I want it to be because that was what we decided without all of this in the equation,\" I whispered pointing to my stomach. \"You need to tell him!\" She mouthed to me. \"I know,\" I said out loud, pouring some soda into cups. I took my cup and Eddie's cup into the living room, We all chatted on the couch just like the good old days, but I couldn't help but feel guilty for my secret that I was carrying and hiding it from Edvard. Would he mad at me for not telling him? Or would he understand? Would he think I was just saying it so we would get back together? Would he accuse the baby of being Jake's? I sipped my coke, trying not to think of how complicated my life was about to become. The day, I arose with the sun. I couldn't sleep at all. I felt like I had bad menstrual cramps, and I knew that wasn't normal. I was also stressing out about the Fall Ball tonight. I didn't have a dress so I would be wearing my old dress from Eddie's coronation ball. What if it didn't fit me? I hadn't appeared to put on any weight, but what if any weight that I had put on became obvious in the old dress? I wondered about all of the questions that I would get bombarded with tonight by everyone, and I dreaded seeing Rosalind, who I was sure was behind this scandal from the newspaper. I walked into the living room and sat down on the couch with a book that I had been reading. My phone buzzed beside me as I was about to open my book, and I saw that I had a text message from Eddie. I picked up my phone and read it. It said: Try to get to the palace around 4 or 4:30 at the latest. Your dress will be waiting for you in your room. I can't wait to see you tonight :) I loved how he called it \"my room\" and didn't say anything like \"your old or previous room.\" I couldn't help but smile at his last part. I can't wait to see you either :-) , I texted him back. \"Paige! You're up early!\" Clara exclaimed. She was sleeping last night by the time I came back. \"How did things go with King Edvard last night?\" She asked me, getting some cereal. \"Want any?\" She asked me. \"Sure,\" I said following her into the kitchen. \"Everything went really well last night,\" I said. \"He asked me to be his date tonight at the Fall Ball,\" I said. I could tell by Clara's face that she was genuinely happy for me. \"And are you going to be his date tonight?\" She asked me. \"Yes, I'm going tonight. I'm nervous though.\" \"Nervous about what?\" She asked me. \"Just being under everyone's scrutiny again. No one knows, besides you guys, that we are trying to work things out,\" I said. \"It's going to be a complete shock to the whole country, especially Queen Rosalind. I'm honestly dreading seeing her again. She's never liked me,\" I confided in Clara. \"Paige- Denmark loves you. I think everyone was upset when they found out you guys split. What isn't there to like about you? I'm sure Rosalind loves you,\" Clara said. \"You don't even know the half of it,\" I said, taking a bite of my cereal. \"Rosalind absolutely hates me, and she lets me know every single change she gets. She wants Eddie to marry someone of royal descent, and she is doing everything in her power to make sure that I am out of the picture,\" I said. \"Well, go in the palace with your head held high and be the strong person that I know that you are. You're not going to let some stupid tabloid keep you from having a good time tonight,\" she said getting up to put her bowl in the sink and gave me a pat on the back. \"Show Denmark the lovable, determined, strong, and bubbly Paige that Sarah and I know so well and that Edvard knows.\" \"It's so hard going back to his life,\" I admitted out loud. \"I'm so used to being anonymous, and it's so weird having people who you don't know, know your name and pretty much who you are,\" I confided in Clara again. \"Don't you want to be with Edvard?\" She asked me, somewhat confused. \"Of course, I want nothing more in the world than to marry Edvard. But things would be so much easier if he wasn't...royal,\" I said. \"And I'm sure if he was just like everyone else, there would still be problems. No relationship is perfect,\" Clara said sympathetically. I nodded to show that I understood. Around 3:30, I began my walk to the palace. I couldn't wait to see Edvard again, but I truly hope that his mother wasn't around or I will literally have to bite my tongue around her to keep myself from telling her off. Eddie must have told the guard to expect me since they let me in, no questions asked, as soon as they saw me. I walked inside to the palace, which I used to call home. I was climbing the main staircases to go to my room when I heard Eddie call my name. \"Paige!\" he exclaimed running up the stair to catch up to me. \"Hey!\" I said turning around and smiling at him. \"I've been waiting to do this all day,\" he said scooping my chin in his hands and bringing his lips to mine. He kissed me passionately but gently. I put my arms around him and kissed him back. \"I have to get back to Congress, but I was hoping that I would see you come in,\" he said to me and gave me one last kiss. He took my hand and gently kissed it as he walked away, turning around to smile at me. I watched him walk away with a pang of guilt overcoming me. I should have told him then about the baby; I should have told him before I watched him walk away. I continued my walk up to my room, or my previous room, where I found a beautiful dress wrapped up on the bed. I sat down on the bed and put my hands on my head in despair. I had to tell Eddie about the baby tonight. I had to whether we decided to work things out or not. I wasn't right to keep him in the dark this long. Should I tell him before or after the ball? I felt so overwhelmed that I wanted to cry. I guess I could blame my hormones. I looked at the clock. I had less than two hours to get ready. I unzipped my dress from the bag it was wrapped it. It was absolutely beautiful. It was similar to my old dress from Eddie's coronation ball, but it was different. Both sleeves were off the shoulder with beautiful royal blue lace following my collar bone area. The entire dress was a dark royal blue with it being fitting more in the bodice area and flowed down like a dress that Cinderella would have when she went to the ball. I decided that I needed to fix my hair first, then do my make-up and then finally slip into my dress. Most people had others help them get ready for the ball, but I preferred doing everything by myself- it was just who I was. So, when I heard a knock on the door later that evening, I assumed it was a maid checking to see if I needed help with anything. \"Come in,\" I said naively. The door opened and Rosalind walked into my room. Part of me wanted to scream in frustration, and the other part of me wanted to go up and slap her on the face. How dare she walk in my room after she had tried to sabotage my reputation in order to ruin my relationship with Eddie? \"What do you want Rosalind?\" I said annoyed. I wanted her to know that she was not welcome here. \"What in heaven's name are you doing here!?\" She exclaimed, genuinely shocked to see me. \"I heard some music playing in here, and I thought it was Arabella or one of the maids trying to hide!\" We stared at each other intensely. My eyes were filled with anger while her's were trying to intimidate me. It wasn't working. \"Well, it isn't Arabella or a maid. You can leave now,\" I said turning around so she would get the message. \"How dare you tell me what to do!\" She exclaimed. \"And how dare you try to do whatever it takes to make sure that I am out of your son's life. I know what you did Rosalind, and you have some nerve trying to come in here and intimidate me. You can print all the lies you want about me, but Edvard is never going to believe them. You can photoshop all of the pictures of me with other men if you want, but Edvard isn't going to fall for that again. He knows me and he trusts me. It's you who can no longer be trusted,\" I said firmly, looking her in the eye the entire time. Rosalind stood there looking shocked at my words. I had finally stood up to her after all this time, and it felt great. I was no longer going to put up with her snide remarks or her questions. \"And makes you so sure that it was me who put photoshopped that picture? How do we know that you are just not guilty, and you are trying to blame me for your own mistakes?\" Rosalind said, trying to come up with a come-back. \"Who else would hate me so much as to go that far to make sure that I did not marry Edvard? You're the only person that comes to mind,\" I said firmly again. \"I don't hate you, Paige,\" Rosalind said trying to keep her tone civil and calm. \"I'm not blind Rosalind. I know that you have wanted nothing else than for me to leave ever since the very first day that Eddie brought me here. I hate to break it to you, but I am not going anywhere. Now, would you please leave? I need to finish getting ready for tonight,\" I said turning around again. \"You don't tell me what to do, Paige,\" she said being confrontational again. \"I don't want to see you or speak to you, Rosalind. Now get out of my room,\" I said firmly and angrily. \"I'm not-\" she began to say. \"Get out ,\" I said lowering my voice slightly and being the firmest with her than I had ever been with anyone before. Surprised, Rosalind turned around, left my room and closed my door loudly behind her to let me know that I had made her angry. I honestly could have cared less. She could be angry with me and plot against me, but nothing was going to break apart the love that Eddie and I had for each other. I had only been to one ball before in my life, (which I honestly did not have the best memories of) but this ball had to be as extravagant, if not more, than the previous one I had attended. I hadn't even technically entered the ballroom area yet, but I was already blown away by the decorations and the music that I heard. \"There you are,\" Eddie said getting up to great me. He was waiting for me before he entered the ball. He wanted us to enter the ball together. I was his date after all and when he was announced as entering, I would be too. He came over and gave a tight hug and quick kiss on the lips. \"You look absolutely beautiful,\" he said giving me one the biggest smiles that I had seen him have before. \"Thank you. You did a good job picking out the dress,\" I said. \"Arabella helped me,\" he said winking over at his sister who was also waiting to enter after us. I looked over at Arabella and gave her a smile, and I also saw Rosalind scouring at me. \"Can I borrow her from one minute?\" He asked the guard and his family. \"Edvard-\" Rosalind began to say. \"It'll just take a moment mother. I have something for Paige to complete her outfit,\" he said winking at me, taking my hand and leading me away and down the hall. \"Where are we going?\" I asked giddy. I was honestly so happy to be with him. \"You'll see,\" he said. I could tell that he was giddy as well. He led me out to a patio that overlooked the fountain. Part of me was slightly nervous since I wasn't sure what he was planning to do. \"I just had to do this,\" he said leaning in and kissing me hard and passionately. I put my arms around him and enjoyed the moment. The moment got filled with more passion as Eddie began to kiss my neck and down to my collarbone. \"How about we skip the ball, and we just spend the evening together instead?\" I asked him, nothing wanting to leave his arms. \"You have have no idea how much I would love to do that,\" he whispered in my ear. \"But I'm afraid as the King, I have to go to events like this,\" he said. \"But,\" he said taking both my hands and looking into my eyes, \"I did want to give you something to complete you dress.\" I looked down slightly surprised as I saw him slide my engagement ring back on my ring finger. I looked up at him completely surprised, completely shocked. And stomach dropped a few feet when I realized that I still had not completely told him the truth. \"That is what you want, right?\" Eddie asked slightly unsure. \"I wouldn't want to spend the rest of my life with anyone else,\" I said kissing him reassuringly. And with that, we walked back hand in hand to the entrance of the ball.[Chapter 19] \"His Royal Highness King Edvard of Denmark and his fiancé, Paige Morgan of Wisconsin,\" the guard's voice boomed as I took Eddie's arm, and we walked down the beautiful, wide staircase together and out onto the ballroom floor. Some clapping and a bunch of whispering erupted after people saw us come out together and especially after I was introduced as his finance. The people of Denmark, especially the people here, were not expecting to hear that sort of announcement. In fact, the majority were expecting to see Kirsten walk down with Edvard tonight and probably announce their engagement together. We walked around to the center and waited for Rosalind, Harold, and Arabella to be announced as well. Such as formal entrance was extremely strange to me, and I wondered if I would ever get used to all of this formality and everyone knowing who I was. Edvard and I began to mingle, and he introduced me to the Prime Minister of England and his wife and Prime Minister of Denmark's wife, who I had never met before (I had met the Prime Minister previously). \"It's a pleasure to meet you,\" I said curtsying to them. \"And this is my finance, Paige Morgan,\" Eddie said proudly, motioning over to me. \"Miss Paige,\" the Prime Minister of Denmark said taking my hand and kissing it, \"It's so good to see you again. I have heard nothing but praises about you from King Edvard,\" he said smiling. \"Well, I wouldn't have anything bad to say about him either,\" I said smiling at Eddie. \"It is a please to meet you Ms. Morgan,\" The Prime Minister of England said kissing my hand too. (It was custom for them to do that...I am still not sure why). We chatted with them for a few minutes, and then Eddie and I continued to walk around together, being stopped several times by people to talk. \"Edvard!\" George exclaimed as we walked by him. I did remember George as a member of Parliament and that he was close with Eddie. He came behind Edvard and patted him on the back. \"You have no idea how happy I am to see you tonight, Miss Paige,\" he said greeting me the European way (with a kiss on the cheek). \"I am happy to be here as well,\" I responded, greeting him as well. \"So, it's true!? You two are engaged again?\" George asked quietly so he wouldn't be overheard. \"Yes,\" Eddie said taking my hand proudly and squeezing it. \"We both wouldn't want anything else.\" I nodded in agreement, smiling at him. \"Yes!\" George exclaimed probably a little louder than he should have. \"You have no idea how happy I am to hear this!\" I could tell that he was truly happy for us. \"Let me know when the big day is, okay?\" He said patting Eddie on the back again and walking off. We continued to make our rounds around when we ran into Eddie's mother and a blond-haired girl who I assumed was Kirsten. My heart began to race slightly, and it dropped. I really didn't want to see either of them tonight. \"Hello mother, Kirsten,\" Eddie said stopping by them. He took my hand and gave it a little squeeze since he knew that I was not happy to see either of them. \"Kirsten, let me introduce to you my fiancé, Paige Morgan. I don't believe that the two of you have met yet,\" Eddie said introducing us. \"It's a pleasure to meet the girl who stole Denmark's heart,\" she said halfheartedly. \"The pleasure is all mine,\" I replied greeting her with a kiss on each cheek. \"Edvard and I have been friends ever since we could walk. We practically grew up together. In fact, we were engaged to be married as children,\" Kirsten said sipping her wine. \"Although, I thought that was going to happen again, especially after that moment we shared in the garden two weeks ago,\" she said smugly. I looked at Eddie confused and hurt. Did he really move on that fast where he was making moves on Kirsten in the garden? That was where we used to walk and talk...and kiss. \"Nothing happen Kirsten and nothing was going to happen,\" Eddie said firmly but quietly. I knew he didn't want to be overheard. \"But something could have happened if you wanted,\" Kirsten reiterated sipping her wine again. \"Paige, have you tried the wine yet?\" She said trying to change the subject. \"No, I haven't, but I'm fine though,\" I added quickly. The last thing I needed was a rumor circulating that I refused wine tonight. \"Oh, you must try it! It is delicious! I have never had anything like it before! Here, take a few sips of mine, if you want,\" she said offering me her glass. \"Oh no, I'm fine. Really,\" I repeated again. \"I insist,\" she said practically shoving her glass in my face. She was trying to be nice, but she was so fake it was killing me that Eddie could have ever considered marrying her. \"I'm really fine. I'll have a glass later. You enjoy it,\" I said trying to be nice, but slightly firm at the same time. \"Why not take a few sips? It's not like you have a drinking problem or anything,\" Kirsten said smirking at me. \"Excuse me,\" I said walking away. I didn't want to stay there anymore, and I didn't have to take Kirsten's bullying anymore. I needed to go to the bathroom anyway. The cheese that I had eaten before was not sitting well with me. Also, my cramps were really severe, and I was starting to feel overheated and flushed. I need to go to the ladies room to rest for a few minutes. \"Paige,\" Eddie said coming after me and gently touching my arm. \"I'm so sorry. I had no idea that she would be so-\" \"Obnoxious,\" I said finishing his sentence for him. \"Are you okay?\" he asked me looking into my eyes, concerned. \"Yeah, I'm fine. I was actually just going to run to the bathroom really fast to freshen up,\" I said smiling at him. \"Okay,\" he said and seemed to be satisfied with my answer. \"Are you sure you're okay?\" he asked me again. \"Yes,\" I said reassuringly and walked off, heading towards the bathroom. I got to the bathroom and took wet paper towel to dab my face with. I was getting more and more overheated as a wave of nausea overwhelmed me. I should have really not have eaten those cheddar blocks with the chocolate strawberries. I leaned over the sink and tried to breathe deeply to calm my stomach down, but it wasn't working. The nausea overtook my body, and I found myself running into a bathroom stall and getting sick to my stomach, barely making it to the toilet. If this was what pregnancy was going to be like, I never wanted to have any more children after this one. \"So, do you think that she is bulimic too?\" Someone whispered to someone else. \"I'm not sure, but it is weird that she is in the bathroom, vomiting. She's already an alcoholic, so I would not be surprised to find out that she had an eating disorder too. She is so skinny!\" Someone else whispered back. I wasn't sure whether I should stay in there until they left or if I should leave the stall with my head held high, wash up, and leave. Fortunately, they left without my having to make that decision. I left the stall and saw Arabella washing her hands at the sink. \"Paige!\" She exclaimed, completely surprised to see me. She stopped what she was doing and gave me the biggest hug that she had ever given me. \"I am so happy that you and Edvard are back together! You two were always meant to be together!\" She said happily. I smiled weakly. Part me felt like I was going to be sick again. I was. I ran back into the stall and dry heaved over the toilet. There was nothing left in my body, but the nausea was still controlling me. \"Paige, are you okay?\" Arabella asked, gently knocking in the stall door. \"I'm fine Arabella! Don't worry about me,\" I said trying to remain upbeat. I felt my stomach calming down, and I came back outside. I dabbed my face with my water and tried to gargle some water in my mouth and threw a mint in my mouth from the complementary basket in the bathroom. Arabella watched me the whole time looking so concerned. Part of me wanted to tell her, but I was petrified that someone may be in the bathroom still or someone could come in and overhear us. After I finished freshening up, I turned and smiled at her. \"I'm fine, really,\" I said trying to convince her. \"Then why did you...why were you?\" She began to ask and then trailed off. \"I was just kind of nervous about coming back today, and I guess my nerves got the best of me,\" I lied. (Although, it was partly true. I was nervous about tonight). \"Do you want me to get Edvard?\" She asked, trying to be helpful. \"No, I'm fine, really. I feel a lot better now. The best thing I can do right now is to go back out there and have a good time!\" I said trying so hard to remain upbeat even though I felt horrible. \"Shall we?\" I asked, holding out my hand for her to take. We walked out together and found Edvard conversing with some members of Parliament. They seemed to be having a good time since they were laughing when we approached them. \"Gentlemen, I am sure that many of you already know my fiancé, Paige, and my sister Arabella,\" Edvard said. \"Hello,\" I said smiling and greeting them all. Several of them I recognized, but there were still a few faces that I did not know. Edvard looked at Arabella and saw that she looked like something was bothering her and then he looked at me. \"Is everything okay?\" He asked me quietly. \"Yeah,\" I said smiling at him reassuringly. Eddie, Arabella, and I walked off together. I know they wanted to get some more food, but good was honestly the last thing I had on my mind. \"Paige, have you tried the ham and cheese rolls? They are so good!\" I heard an annoyingly peppy voice say behind me. I turned around and found Kirsten again, the second to last person that I wanted to see besides Rosalind. \"I'm actually not that hungry,\" I said quickly. \"Right, because you are bulimic too. Wow, Edvard found himself such a catch,\" she said smirking. I turned and ended up glaring at her, and Arabella looked at me so concerned. Great, now Arabella thought I had an eating disorder. \"I heard about what happened in the bathroom, Paige. One of my dear friends was in there and told me all about it. Do you need help, Paige? We are all here for you if you need it,\" She said being extremely fake. I taking all the strength I had left in me not to just push her away and completely tell her off. \"Kirsten, I would really appreciate it if you would just drop this. I do not have an eating disorder; the food was just not sitting well with me tonight,\" I explained calmly. \"Then you won't be opposed to eating more food?\" Kirsten said smirking. I sighed and grabbed a plate and a croissant and some grapes and joined Arabella at a table with Edvard. \"Do you want me to get you a glass of wine, Paige,\" Eddie asked me after I had started eating my croissant. \"No, I'm fine. Thank you though,\" I said. \"Are you sure? I was just about to go get another glass,\" he said. \"Yeah, my stomach is a little off, and I feel that it would just be best to avoid the wine,\" I explained. Eddie left to go get himself another glass of wine, which left me and Arabella at the table. I was hungry, but the food was not really appealing. I was craving peanut butter in the worst way possible. \"What's wrong Arabella?\" I asked since she kept on looking at me with such a concerned look on her face. \"Why exactly did you get in the bathroom?\" She asked me seriously. I sighed. I really wished I could tell her. I really did. \"It was because the food wasn't sitting well with me, and I was really nervous about tonight. You know how I am when I get nervous about something!\" I said laughing, trying to brush it off. \"So, you're not...\" She started to say and trailed off. My heart began to race a hundred miles a minute. Did she know I was pregnant? How could she possibly know? \"I'm not what?\" I asked nervous about how she would end her sentence. \"Bulimic,\" she finished. I felt a wave of relief overwhelm me, and I laughed at myself for being so silly. \"No, I am not,\" I told her reassuringly. \"I promise,\" I said gently touching her arm and smiling. Arabella seemed pleased with my answer and continued eating her food. I picked at mine and struggled to get down the croissant and grapes. How much longer could I deceive the ones I loved? I still hadn't told my parents, Eddie, Arabella, or my brothers or the rest of my family. I would have to come clean tonight and tomorrow to everyone. There would no more secrets or lies. I felt an intense pain in my abdomen as I made my mental decision to myself. It was so intense that I subconsciously put my hands on my stomach and bent over slightly as though that would help the pain. I was almost 100% sure that this was not a normal symptom of pregnancy. I reminded myself that my doctor's appointment was Monday, one day away. I desperately tried to convince myself that everything would be okay until then. It had to be. But I wondered how Eddie would react to me hiding this secret from him. Would everything still be okay between us?[Chapter 20] After forcing down the croissant and some grapes, Eddie and I began dancing on the dance floor for the rest of the night. I personally was exhausted- both mentally and physically- but I could tell that retiring and going to sleep was the last idea on Eddie's mind. Plus, he had about two or three glasses of wine, and I could tell that he was feeling it. \"You have no idea how bad I want to kiss you right now,\" he whispered into my ear playfully. \"Well, kiss me then,\" I whispered back to back to him. He leaned down and gently kiss me on the lips. \"Do you think we would be missed if we left for a little bit?\" He asked, moving his arm up and down my back, gently teasing me. \"Probably,\" I said smiling. \"But maybe we could talk after the dance?\" I asked him. \"Of course,\" he said leaning down to kiss me gently again. The song ended, and we walked off hand in hand to a private room, removed from everyone else. Eddie closed the door behind us and looked at me slightly concerned. \"Is everything okay?\" he asked as gently rubbed my arm. His blue eyes looked so concerned. I looked around the room; this was the same place where I broke up with him the evening before his coronation. Why did this room always have to be where I gave him bad news? I leaned up against a pool table and sighed heavily. \"This is what you want, right?\" he asked me motioning to my ring. I guess he was alarmed that I wanted to call of the engagement. \"Of course, this isn't about the engagement Eddie. I want nothing more in this world than to marry you,\" I said taking his hand reassuringly. \"Then, what is it?\" He asked me, getting more concerned. \"Eddie, I'm-\" I began to say, but then I was cut off by Soren knocking and walking into the room. \"Excuse me, Edvard, I'm sorry to interrupt, but King Albert of Norway would like to talk to you. I assume it is regarding his daughter, Kirsten,\" Soren said. \"Yes, can you tell him that I am occupied at the moment?\" Eddie said. \"I'm sorry, sir, but he says that it is urgent,\" Soren said. Eddie sighed. \"Come on, Paige,\" he said taking my hand. \"You want me to...\" I started to say and then trailed off. \"Anything he has to say to me, he can say to you. You will be my wife soon, and we are one,\" Eddie said firmly. Eddie and I walked hand in hand to a different room where the King of Norway was waiting for us. \"I'd rather like to speak with your privately, your highness,\" The King of Norway said to Eddie. \"Albert, whatever you have to say to me, you can say to her too. Let me introduce to you my fiance, Paige Morgan,\" he said proudly. \"Miss Paige, it is an honor,\" he said nodding to me. \"The pleasure is all mine,\" I said curtsying to him. \"The reason why I wanted to speak to you privately was because of the severance of relations between Denmark and Norway due to you breaking your engagement to my daughter,\" The King of Norway said seriously. Eddie tried to hold back a chuckle. \"Kirsten and I were engaged when we were children, and it was a decision made by my parents and you and her mother. It was never a decision that we made,\" Eddie said firmly. \"Queen Rosalind assured me the engagement was still void. I know that Kirsten cares about you,\" he said. \"No, the engagement is no longer void. I am engaged to this beautiful women right here,\" he said motioning to me. \"Kirsten and I are adults now, and we are able to make our own decisions. There is no engagement,\" Eddie said. \"This has been planned since infancy! And you are letting some commoner American girl come in and ruin what has already been in place!? What does she know about being a queen!?\" King Albert said getting angry. \"I have no doubt in my mind that Miss Paige Morgan will be the best queen that Denmark has ever had before; much better than Kirsten would have been. We are all adults now; it is time that Kirsten started acting like one too. I'm not changing my mind,\" Eddie said firmly. \" \"How dare you talk about my daughter like that!\" King Albert said getting angry. \"And how you dare you talk about my fiance like that! You know nothing about her,\" Eddie said raising his voice and becoming defensive of me. I loved the passion in his voice. This was truly the man for me. \"I told Kirsten that her plan would never work,\" King Albert mumbled under his breath. \"What do you mean by that?\" Eddie asked. \"Kirsten came here by invitation of Queen Rosalind to help destroy your relationship with Paige. In exchange if she was successful, she was promised an engagement and the throne of Denmark as the next queen,\" King Albert explained. Eddie and I looked at each other, surprised. (Although I already knew that Rosalind was behind everything). \"So, you're telling me that my mother pretty much hired Kirsten to destroy my relationship to Paige?\" Eddie asked. \"Yes, that is exactly what I am saying. They worked very hard together. They were successful! You were a part for how long...eight or nine days? I'm shocked to see that she is here with you tonight...\" King Albert said trailing off. I was getting lightheaded, and I felt dizzy. I knew that Rosalind was most likely behind this, but I still wanted to think that she was not behind the photo shopped picture. This confirmed everything- Rosalind hated my guts and would anything she could to get rid of me...even hire Kirsten and promise her marriage to Edvard if she was successful. I felt sick to my stomach, and it was because that there was such hatred and evil in this household. After leaving that very pleasant (insert sarcasm) conversation, we strolled slowly outside together. I could tell that Eddie was upset over the news that he had heard with King Albert. It had just confirmed that his mother was truly trying to separate us. After meeting with King Albert and after saying good-bye to every single guest at the ball as it ended, Eddie and I were finally able to retire for the evening. I lied down on the bed, still in my dress, completely exhausted from the evening. Eddie had been unusually quiet ever since we talked with King Albert; I knew that he was upset over what he had discovered. \"Do you want to talk about it?\" I asked Eddie as he lied down next to me, put his arms around my waist and cuddled up against me. \"I just can't believe that my mother could actually be capable of doing something like that. Yes, I know that she was never the fondest of you, but I thought that she had accepted you as being my wife. I never knew that she would go to such an extreme...,\" he said trailing off in thought. I turned around to face him and gently stroked his cheek. \"I know that you are going through a lot of pain right now, and I know that this is hard. I'm disappointed in her too. I had hope that she may accept me one day and want to have a relationship with me,\" I said. \"It's killing me too that I almost let you go. If we hadn't run into each other that day at the coffee shop, I don't know what would have happen. The thought of not being with you and discovering later on that you were telling me the truth would absolutely kill me. I am so sorry, Paige, for not believe you before.\" \"I forgive you,\" I said leaning in to give him a kiss on the forehead. \"You can't dwell on what would have happened. We are here now, and we are together,\" I said reassuringly. \"And I will never make the mistake of losing you again,\" he said leaning in to kiss me. It started off as sweet and gentle, but then it became very heated and passionate. Eddie pulled me closer to him, his lips exploring my jawline, neck, collarbone, and some cleavage that was shown with this dress. His hands moved to the back of my dress, trying to find the zipper. It was then that I knew I had to come clean with him and finally tell him my secret. \"Hey Eddie,\" I said when his lips where on my shoulder. \"Hmmhmm,\" he mumbled. \"Do you mind if I go take a quick shower, first? I feel all dirty,\" I said trying to come up with an excuse. \"You are fine and beautiful,\" he said stroking my cheek and kissing me hardly on the lips. \"Wait, Eddie,\" I said when we broke apart. \"What is it?\" Eddie asked looking up at me. Heat and nausea overwhelmed me, my head was spinning, and I knew I was going to be sick again. \"I'm sorry,\" I said getting up and running to the bathroom. I closed the door behind me and got sick to my stomach. My head was pounding, and I wondered if it was okay to take some Tylenol to help ease the symptoms. \"Paige?\" Eddie asked concerned, knocking on the door. I leaned up against the bathtub and held my head in my hands. \"Can you hand my sweatpants and T-shirt in my bag?\" I asked him. \"Yes,\" he said. I heard him walk away and then he came back and opened the bathroom door and saw me on the floor, leaning against the bathroom and holding my head. \"Paige, what's wrong?\" He asked me, handing me my clothes. \"Can you help me up?\" I asked him. He helped me up, and I cried out as a sharp, intense pain overcame by abdomen. It was the worst pain that I had experienced so far with this pregnancy. \"Paige,\" Eddie asked very alarmed. \"What wrong? I don't understand! Are you in pain?\" \"I'm pregnant,\" I blurted out. Eddie didn't say anything, but he just looked at me in complete shock. He helped me stand up. His facial expression showed it all. He was in complete shock. \"You're pregnant?\" He asked quietly. \"Yes,\" I said. \"There's something wrong. I can't keep anything down, I'm dizzy all the time, and I feel like I have horrible menstrual cramps all the time. And now I have this horrible sharp, intense pain in my abdomen,\" I said. \"Can you help me out of my dress?\" I asked him. Eddie was quiet, and he appeared as though he was almost numb. \"Are you sure?\" He asked me as he unzipped my dress. He held my hand as I stepped out of the dress. He put it on a hang as I put on a T-shirt and some sweatpants. \"Yes, the pain is very intense-\" I began. \"No, I mean are you sure that you are pregnant?\" He asked me as we walked back to my bed together, and I lied down, trying to get comfortable. \"Yes, I am sure. I took two tests. They both came out positive,\" I said. I looked at Eddie. I tried to read his face, but I couldn't tell if he was upset or angry with me or with the news that he just received. \"When did you find out,\" he asked quietly, looking away from me. My heart dropped- I knew that he knew that I had been keeping this a secret from him for quite some time. \"It was two days after we split. I was laying in bed one night, and my breasts were really sore and tender. I realized that I hadn't had a period in quite some time so I took two tests the next morning, and they were positive.\" \"So, you've known all this time, and you didn't tell me?\" He asked starting to get angry but trying to keep his cool. \"You didn't tell me that you were carrying my child!?\" He exclaimed, pacing around the room. \"I found out actually the day that Kirsten came here. I came over the same day to try to talk to you during what would be one of your breaks, and Soren told me that you were greeting her and couldn't talk,\" I explained. \"You could have called, you could have texted me, you could have told me at the coffee shop, the night I picked you up from the library, or tonight before the ball! You had so many opportunities!\" He exclaimed, starting to get angry and still pacing around the room. \"That wasn't something I wanted to leave over a voice mail or send you through a text message,\" I said. \"I didn't want to pull you aside in the coffee shop either! It was something that I wanted to tell you in person and privately,\" I said defending myself. \"What about the night I picked you up from the library, and we talked things through?\" He asked. \"What is your excuse for that?\" he snapped. \"Eddie, please, calm down,\" I said calmly. He exhaled deeply and sat down on the bed next to me. \"I'm sorry, Paige. I didn't mean to snap at you. This is all just really overwhelming right now,\" he said calming down. \"I know. It's going to take you a while to get used to the concept. It was really overwhelming and scary for me too,\" I said. \"Why didn't you tell me that night, Paige?\" he asked me, very calmly. \"It was wrong of me to keep this from you this long. That night, I held back because I was thinking that if we decided to get back together, I would want to make sure that it was because that was what we wanted. I wouldn't want us to get together just because of the baby,\" I explained. \"That was my rationale.\" \"If we never met up again, were you ever going to tell me?\" He asked. I sighed. \"Since we said we were both going to be completely honest with each other, there was a time when I was thinking that I could just return to the US before you found out and just move on with my life there. But I never would have been able to do that to you,\" I said. Eddie sighed in frustration. \"Are you feeling any better?\" He asked me. I shook my head. \"Do you want to go to the hospital?\" he asked me. \"Let me try to sleep it off first. I'll let you know if I don't feel any better tomorrow.\" \"Who knows?\" he asked me, changing the subject. \"Just my roommates, Sarah and Clara.\" \"And they haven't told anyone?\" Eddie asked. \"No,\" I responded. \"Don't your parents and brothers know?\" he asked me. \"I haven't had the courage to tell them yet,\" I said. \"You haven't been the only one that I have been keeping in the dark.\" \"You have to tell them,\" he said. \"I know,\" I said quietly. \"How far along do you think you are? Have you been to a doctor yet?\" \"I'm not sure- maybe 6-8 weeks. And I'm going on Monday to the doctor,\" I responded. \"So,\" he said gently putting his hand on my abdomen, \"we are having a baby?\" he asked me, gently rubbing it, and smiling at me. \"Yes,\" I said smiling. \"Hello,\" he said talking to my stomach. I couldn't help but laugh. \"This is your father. I'm not sure what you mother has said about me, but I want to assure you that none of it is true,\" he said chuckling. I playfully hit him on the head and laughed. \"And I can't wait to meet you,\" he said lifting up my shirt and gently kissed my abdomen. I couldn't help but get teary eyed with Eddie's beautiful words and gesture. He seemed to have accepted a lot faster than I ever did about the baby. I couldn't believe that I was actually considering before leaving Denmark without telling him. \"You're going to be a great dad,\" I said to him sincerely. \"And you are going to be a great mom,\" he said gently kissing me on the lips. And I laid there in his arms until I fell asleep. I couldn't wait to see what the future had in store for us. And I also just hoped that I didn't receive bad news about the health of our child on Monday...[Chapter 21] It was the middle of the night when I woke up suddenly. As I turned on my ride side, I felt something warm and wet underneath me. I jerked upwards and immediately began to panic. I picked up the sheet to look, and I saw red and lots of it. Tears began to form in my eyes as I realized that I was losing the baby. There was a pain in my abdomen unlike I had ever experienced before, and I was feeling lightheaded. I tried getting up to go to the bathroom, but the pain was unbearable. I just hoped there was still a way to save the baby. I needed to go get Eddie immediately, and I needed him to take me to the hospital. However, I was afraid to move too much, and I was in complete agony when I did so. I tried calling Eddie's cell phone, but he must have had it on silent or he slept right through it. Next, I tried calling Arabella; there was still no answer from her. In desperation and for the sake of my child's life, I tried calling Rosalind. Surprisingly, she answered. \"Paige, do you have any idea what time it is!?\" She snapped. \"Rosalind, can you please get Edvard and tell him that I need him immediately?\" I asked desperate, trying to keep from crying out in pain. \"You can go get him yourself,\" she said angrily. \"How dare you wake-\" \"I can't move without being in agony, Rosalind. I need Eddie to take me to the hospital,\" I said crying silently to myself, but this time it was for our child. \"What do you mean you can't move?\" She asked as though she didn't believe me. I sighed. \"I'm pregnant, and I'm losing the baby. There is something seriously wrong. Please, help me and get Edvard,\" I pleaded. \"I'm walking to go wake him up now,\" she said quietly before hanging up. A few moments later Eddie came running to my room. \"Paige, what's wrong?\" he asked alarmed, coming to my side. \"I'm losing the baby,\" I said quietly. I watched as the color drained from his face, and he came over to try to comfort me. \"Let's go to the hospital,\" he said gently patting my back. \"Don't lose all hope yet. Do you want me to drive your or should I call an ambulance? Can you get up at all? \"Barely,\" I said trying to get up but I winced in pain. What was happening? \"Bring her some sweatpants, new underwear, a sanitary napkin, and a comfortable top,\" Rosalind said just walking into my room. \"We can help her get dressed, and we need to call for an ambulance.\" I looked up, surprised that Rosalind, in her way, was trying to help. \"Do I have to go in an ambulance?' I asked. \"Yes,\" both Eddie and Rosalind said sternly. \"You could be hemorrhaging, Paige. You need medical attention immediately,\" she said dialing the emergency number on her phone. \"Yes, hello...\" I heard her say as Eddie took me into the bathroom and helped me change and get ready. He even threw a few clothes into a bag for me since I was guess he was assuming that I would have to spend a night or two at the hospital. \"The publicity is going to be insane,\" Rosalind said once she put her cell phone in the pocket of her bathrobe. \"We need a plan. Soren is arranging security at the hospital for you and Paige. She'll have a guard on her floor at all times. We need to decide on what to tell the press. If we keep it quiet, they are going to have field day with this. Paige will be in the hospital for every possible reason, and they will find \"proof\" to back up their reasons. \"Dehydration?\" Eddie proposed. \"Your fiancé was rushed to the hospital in the middle of the night for dehydration?\" Rosalind asked, raising an eyebrow to show her disapproval. \"Well, mother, you are quite the planner and plotter. Why don't you come up with something?\" Eddie asked sarcastically. \"What on earth is that supposed to mean?\" Rosalind asked, trying to pretend to be innocent. \"Paige and I talked to King Albert this evening. We know everything that you and Kirsten were behind everything,\" Eddie sternly, which showed his disapproval. \"Edvard-\" Rosalind started to say. \"We'll discuss this later, mother,\" Eddie said helping me over to the bed. \"So, what should we tell people before a million rumors begin to circulate?\" Rosalind asked, changing the subject slightly. \"Food poisoning,\" I suggested. \"That might work...\" Rosalind said, thinking.\" And if they press for details, the statement will say that you couldn't stop vomiting. We feared there was something seriously wrong, so we decided to take you to the hospital.\" \"Even though she was fine at the ball tonight?\" Eddie asked. \"I got sick in the bathroom. Arabella saw me,\" I said. \"I think we have our story,\" Rosalind said, nodding to show her approval. The room suddenly began spinning, and I don't remember what happened next. I just remember waking up in the ER room with Eddie sitting down in a chair right by my side. His head were in his hands, and he seemed upset. \"Oh thank goodness, you're awake,\" Eddie said moving his chair closer to me and took my hand and kissed it. \"What happened?\" I asked disillusioned. I couldn't really remember what happened or why I was here. \"You lost too much blood, and you passed out,\" Eddie explained.\" The nurse should be coming back sometime soon. They were able to give you something to help stop the bleeding, and they want to do an exam and an ultra sound...\" Eddie said trailing off. \"I'm pretty sure I've lost the baby by now...\" I said and then trailed off. I wanted to cry. I would never see our child. If I had gone for medical attention earlier, would I have been able to save it? Was this my fault? \"It's not that Paige. There is a possibility that there could have been a false positive test, which would mean there would be a more serious medical condition such as an ovarian cyst, which they could easily treat, or cancer. Also, there is a possibility that you have an ectopic pregnancy, where the baby attaches to your fallopian tube instead of your uterus. They said it can cause extreme nausea, pain, dizziness, and gives you all the symptoms of a regular pregnancy,\" Eddie explained. \"I missed all this? How long was I out?\" I asked. \"You've been out for a little over an hour,\" he explained. \"Although, you woke up when we came to the hospital, but you were in so much pain that they gave you something to help ease it and something to stop the bleeding. They also drew some blood to run some tests with to rule out a few other possibilities. They didn't tell me what though.\" We were quiet for a few moments. I didn't know what to say, and I know that Eddie was worried over the possibility that I could have cancer. The thought scared me too. \"I'm sure they'll keep you for at least another day and move you to a private room. And when they do, we need to call your parents and let me know what is going on,\" Eddie said quietly. \"I know. I've been putting off that phone call, and I'm sorry about that,\" I replied. \"I'll call them and tell them. Soren offered, but I knew that this needed to come from us. I just hope your father doesn't answer the phone. He's going to kill me regardless,\" Eddie said trying to make a joke, but we both knew that my dad would be angry and disappointed if it turned out that I am/was pregnant since he was very traditional. Regardless, he would be disappointed that I thought that I was pregnant, even if it turned out that I wasn't, which I doubted. \"Knock knock!\" A nurse said outside the curtain that was separating me from every other ER patient in the hospital tonight. \"Come in,\" Eddie said. I saw a chipper nurse come open the curtain and then close it behind her. I wasn't sure if she was always in such a good mood or if it was because she was assigned to the King of Denmark's finance, and Eddie was also in the room. \"You're awake! This is good news!\" She said writing down notes on her clipboard. \"When did she wake up?\" She asked Eddie. \"About fifteen minutes ago or so,\" he replied. \"Do you remember what happened?\" She asked me, sitting down. She had to get all of the information from me, which would then be given over to the doctor. \"Not really...\" I said. \"Can you tell me what you do remember?\" She asked. \"I remember waking up in a lot of pain, Eddie came to help me, his mother called for medical help, and that's really it,\" I said. \"Is that when she blacked out?\" The nurse asked Eddie. \"Yes, I was helping her over to her bed, she sat down, and then she was unconscious but breathing.\" \"Do you remember waking up when you first came into the hospital?\" She asked me. \"No,\" I said shaking my head. \"Are you in pain now?\" She asked me. \"I'm in some pain, but it isn't too bad,\" I replied. \"I'm really nauseous though.\" \"The doctor may want to put you on some anti-nausea medication. I'll make a quick note,\" she said scribbling away. \"So,\" she said getting serious. \"We are running a few tests with your blood work, and the first one we ran was to confirm if you are pregnant. The pregnancy hormone of hCG was very high, so we do believe that you are or were pregnant. We're also running a complete blood count to see if there is a possibility that it could be a certain type of cancer, which could cause the pregnancy hormone. We should be getting those results back soon. If they come back negative, the doctor has already ordered an internal transvaginal scan, which is basically an ultrasound, but it will clearly show your fallopian tubes to see if you have an ectopic pregnancy. You're also dehydrated, so once we move you into a room, the doctor wants to hook you up to an IV of water. But the doctor will be coming in to talk to you both shortly.\" She wrote down a few more notes and then got up and left. \"Are you nervous?\" Eddie asked me. \"Very,\" I replied. \"I'm so afraid that it's cancer.\" \"Even if it is, Paige, we'll get through this,\" Eddie said reassuringly and took my hand and squeezed it. \"Being strong, and loving and supporting each other won't cure me if it is,\" I said quietly. \"We have to be positive,\" he said. I nodded to show that I understood, but I was still trying to wrap my head around it all. Why was this happening to me? At 23 years old, could I really be dying from cancer? I close my eyes to rest, desperately trying to forget that I was in the hospital anxiously awaiting the results of a blood test.[Chapter 22] Eddie's Point of View: After being moved out of the ER to a private hospital room, the doctor order some more anti-pain medication and some anti-nausea medication, which made her fall sound asleep. It was about 6am here in Copenhagen, so I knew that it was 11am in Wisconsin. I decided that, in good conscious, I had to call her parents and let them know what was going on and what had happened. I wrote Paige a note and told that I had left to grab some food, and that I would return shortly. I doubted she would be awake when I got back, but if she did wake up before my return, I wanted her to know where I was. I don't she packed her phone with her. I took the elevator down to the main floor and walked to where I had parked my car. I decided that I was going to call them from there so no one would overhear me at all. The doctors and nurses all had to keep this medical information confidential, but I worried about being overheard by a passerby. I sat down in the driver's seat and closed the door. My heart was racing so hard; I was so scared to make this phone call for various reasons. One, I knew that I wouldn't be able to answer all of their questions about Paige's health. Second, I knew that since they were traditional, they would disappointed to know that Paige is, or thinks she is, pregnant before we were married. Third, I wasn't even sure if they knew we were back together. If they didn't, what a shock my phone call would be! I picked up my phone and pressed their name under my contacts. Here goes nothing. \"Hello?\" I heard a male voice answer the phone. Damn it, I thought to myself. Amy, Paige's mom, would have been easier to talk with about the current situation. \"Hello? Ben?\" I asked. There was also a possibility though that it could be her youngest brother, Mikey.I hoped it was. \"Yes,\" he said slightly unsure. \"Who is this?\" he asked. \"This is Eddie,\" I replied. \"Really!?\" He said surprised. \"I saw the area code was for Denmark, and I knew it wasn't Paige's number, but I thought she maybe had to borrow someone's phone or something. I wasn't expecting this! How are you?\" he asked me. \"I'm doing well...Honestly, I've been better. There is something I need to tell you,\" I said. I just had to get this over with- I had to tell him. \"I already know that you and Paige broke up,\" he said. \"And I'm sorry to hear that. I know you two really cared about each other, but maybe this is just for the best. Maybe you two need to go on your separate paths,\" he explained, trying to give me wisdom. I was on the verge of just blurting it all out already. \"I wasn't sure if Paige told you, but we actually met up on Thursday and talked everything through. And yesterday, or Friday, we decided that we wanted to get married, so we are engaged again. But this time, we aren't going to let anything tear us apart. It was all a big fake scandal that my mother dreamed up to try to get me to marry this Princess of Norway-\" \"You're mother?\" He asked, surprised. \"Yes, but that's a completely different story for another time. But listen, Ben, there is something that I need to tell you. Paige was rushed to the emergency room last night, and I'm actually here at the hospital with her now.\" \"Wait...what!?\" He exclaimed. \"What happened? What's wrong with her?\" He asked, alarmed. I sighed. Here went nothing. \"The doctor's aren't quite sure yet. They're running a few tests...\" I said trying to give myself time. Even though I was a grown man, telling your fiance's traditional father that you impregnated his unwed daughter was not an easy or pleasant task. \"Well, what happened that made you decide to take her to the ER?\" He asked me. \"Do I need to fly out there? Is it serious?\" He asked. \"The doctors think she may have miscarried-\" \"Miscarried!?\" He exclaimed, cutting me off. \"You mean miscarried a baby!? My daughter was PREGNANT!?\" He exclaimed, his tone getting slightly higher with each statement. \"They aren't sure yet. It's either that, an ectopic pregnancy-\" \"Wait, is there is even a chance that she could be pregnant?\" he asked, cutting me off again. I sighed. This was so awkward. \"Yes, we had sex after her last menstrual cycle,\" I said quickly. \"And this month's never came?\" He asked. \"No,\" I said. I heard him sigh heavily on the other line. I'm sure that was too much information for him, and information that he did not want to hear. \"Is there anything else that it could be?\" he asked, obviously put-out with me. \"They think it could be cancer. They're running tests too,\" I said quietly. Ben fell silent on the other line. I was not the carrier of good news today. \"I never thought that I would say this, but I hope that she's pregnant,\" Ben said quietly. \"Me too,\" I said. \"What happened? Did she pass out or something?\" \"She was complaining about being really nauseous and in a lot of pain before she went to bed. She got sick twice last night. I offered to take her to the hospital before she went to bed, but she wanted to try to sleep it off. Around 3am, she called my mother for help since my phone was on silent. My mother came to wake me up, and then I rushed to her room. She had lost a lot of blood and couldn't move without being in severe pain. We called for medical help, and she blacked out. She's stable now, and they are keeping her for at least one night,\" I explained. \"Keep us updated, Eddie. I'm going to talk to Amy about trying to fly out there. It sounds like a miscarriage with complications, but I'm not a doctor. When she is feeling better, do you think you can have her call us?\" \"Of course, I will. I'll text you guys as soon as I hear any news,\" I said. \"How long have you known about this?\" He asked me. \"Did you know she was pregnant when you broke up with her?\" He questioned. \"I actually just found out tonight a little past midnight,\" I said sighing. \"I'm disappointed that she didn't tell me sooner, but Paige said that she wanted to make sure that if we got back together, it was because that was what we wanted to do. She didn't want me to feel obligated, but I really wish she was more open with me about all of this,\" I said. \"Alright, Eddie. Amy just got in. I'm going to tell her what's going on. Keep us updated,\" he said. \"I will; I promise. Talk to you soon,\" I said hanging up. I sighed and looked out my window. There were about 30 reporters trying to enter through the main entrance to the hospital. News had gotten out that Paige was in there, and I wondered what reason was reported as well. Did I dare look it up on my phone? I stared at my phone and figured that it would be better to know now than find out later through someone else or through the reporters. I unlocked my phone, went to Google, and typed in: Paige Morgan A thousand search results pulled up including past articles, the fake picture of her kissing Jake, and some new articles, which I was interested in reading. I tapped on the one article that read: Paige Morgan, 23, hospitalized! Ex- fiance of King Edvard III, Paige Morgan, was rushed to the hospital last night. It is unknown where Morgan was staying or what caused her to be rushed into the Emergency Room. Channel 12 is following this story and will update as information is received and confirmed. That wasn't much help, I thought to myself. I went to the Google and clicked on a more recent article that was published just nine minutes ago. As I read the title of the article, I became very angry. It read: Paige Morgan Hospitalized for Drug Overdose It has been known that previous American fiance of King Edvard III, Paige Morgan, 23, was involved in an affair with an American exchange student, Jake Smith, 24; however, no one expected this breaking news. According to unidentified sources, Morgan was rushed to the hospital early Saturday morning around 3:15am after suffering from constant vomiting and nausea. She arrived at the hospital unconscious where the doctors and nurses worked hard to avoid the poison from spreading throughout her body- the poison from a cocaine overdose. Additionally, it is rumored and believed that Morgan mixed other drugs with the cocaine such as meth and possibly heroine; however, this is yet to be confirmed. In other words, Morgan is lucky to still be alive. The palace has denied a comment on this incident, and it is unknown whether King Edvard III has visited his previous fiance. This story will be updated as more information in received. I was infuriated, and I continued to scroll through the other article titles. So far, this seemed to be in the majority- everyone thought that my fiance (or they all still thought previous) was a drug addict and had overdosed. Was my mother behind this too? I looked at the crowd of reporters outside the main entrance of the hospital, all dying to enter or get a glimpse of me or someone else from the royal family. I opened up the door door, closed it, locked it, and walked towards the entrance of the hospital. \"King Edvard!\" I heard a choir of reporters yell as I got near the entrance to the hospital. \"Excuse me,\" I said ignoring them. \"King Edvard, are you going to visit your ex-fiance, Paige Morgan?\" One shouted at me. \"Did you know that she was a drug addict?\" Another one shouted at me. \"With Morgan's past history with alcohol and drug abuse, do you feel that she needs to be put into a rehab facility?\" Someone else shouted at me. \"Are you relieved now that you broke the engagement since your future children would have probably had birth defects if Morgan did not stop her habits?\" I heard another shout. I was infuriated, but I decided to turn around and briefly talk to them. \"Yes, I am visiting Paige Morgan, and I don't plan on leaving her side until she is released. Please, check your sources. Miss Morgan is not in the hospital for a drug overdose, but for a rather personal matter. She, I mean we, are going through a very difficult time right now, and we would ask that you respect our privacy,\" I said turning away. \"If you are no longer involved with Miss Morgan, than why are you visiting her?\" A reporter asked. \"I am still involved with her. She is my fiance, and she will be my wife and the future queen of Denmark, and I demand that the media shows her the respect she deserves,\" I said sternly. I was so sick and tired of the media's lies about our lives. Paige was right, a life away from all of this would be so much easier. \"Did Miss Morgan being in the hospital influence your decision to get engaged again?\" Someone asked. \"No, we were engaged previously,\" I stated. \"Since you claim that the palace source stating that Paige Morgan has been admitted for a drug overdose is false, would you mind telling us why she is in the hospital?\" Another reporter asked. Someone from the palace said this? I thought to myself. I just hoped that my surprise didn't show on my face. \"No, that is incorrect,\" I stated firmly. \"Miss Morgan was suffering from a serious case of food poisoning,\" I said remembering our cover-up story. \"The vomiting would not stop, and it was decided to take her here, to the hospital, where is being treated for this along with dehydration,\" I said. Technically, Paige was dehydrated and was hooked up to an IV of water as I spoke, so it wasn't a complete story. About a hundred more questions were thrown at me again. \"Please, give us our space and our privacy during this time,\" I said as I began to walk away. A normal family wouldn't be trapped by the press as they entered into the hospital to visit a loved one...A normal family wouldn't have to lie and cover up the truth to protect someone...A normal family wouldn't have someone else who was determined to ruin the relationship and even go as far as to spread damaging rumors...[Chapter 23] Paige's point of view: After spending 3 days in the hospital, Eddie and I were finally able to return home. During my first day in the hospital, it was discovered that I had an ectopic pregnancy, which is where the baby is attached to the fallopian tube and not the uterus. After several tests, I was told that the baby has already detached from the fallopian tube and surgery wasn't necessary. If the baby had not detached, I would have been rushed into surgery to have the fallopian tube removed since it could have ruptured. It all made sense now- the extreme pain and nausea and the bleeding were all signs of an ectopic pregnancy. Being in medical school and studying to be a future doctor, I should have known and recognized the signs and symptoms. Once the bleeding became regular, I was able to return home. The doctor told me to stay at home an additional 1-2 days for full recovery and if my bleeding increased at all or the pain became intense, I was to return to the hospital immediately. The ride back home with Eddie was simply brutal. When we left the hospital, we were swarmed by the paparazzi. I had never seen it so bad before- we could barely move to get passed them all. Lights were continuously flashing throughout my face, and I was feeling overwhelmed. \"Your Highness! Are you still going to marry Paige Morgan after this incident?\" One yelled. \"Paige Morgan, what did you overdose on?\" Someone else yelled. \"Are you going into rehab?\" I heard another yell. The last comment angered me so. I turned to that reporter and glared at him, my piercing brown eyes showing exactly how outrages his question was. He made eye contact with me, and we both knew that what the media was reporting was a complete lie. I wanted to yell the truth. I wanted to yell at each and every single one of them, to say every curse word that was running through my head, and to demand for them to leave me alone. Didn't they understand what pain I was in right now? I just lost a child. But they didn't know, and they didn't understand, so they just continued to report the lies. \"Paige, come on,\" Eddie said gently, trying to guide me through the crowd. \"Do you really think he is going to marry you? The American drug-addict and alcoholic?\" The same reporter yelled at me again. That did it. I was going to give him a piece of my mind. I stopped and turned around to look at him again. He had a smug smile on his face. \"You ASSHOLE!\" I yelled at him. \"All you do is report lies, and you know that none of them are true. To HELL with ALL of you!\" I yelled at all the reporters. \"For once in your life, just leave us alone!\" \"Paige,\" Eddie said quietly and took my hand. He led me through the crowd, and the reporters let us through. They stopped yelling at us although I still saw some lights flashing from the cameras. Eddie didn't look at me and kept his facial expression unchanged as we headed to the car. I knew that I shouldn't have yelled at the paparazzi, but the words came out of my mouth before I realized what I was saying. But now, I didn't regret saying them, but I knew that the palace, especially Rosalind, would be more determined to prevent our marriage now more than ever. If Rosalind had any say in it, she would probably want to send me somewhere far away. To her, the royal image was everything, but I could care less. Screw them all. Eddie held the door open for me and then came around to the driver's side. He began to drive, and the car was filled with silence. No one knew what to say, and I sure wasn't going to apologize for what I had just said. \"What was that all about, Paige?\" Eddie asked gently. I knew that he was upset with me for losing my cool with the reporters, and this was his way of trying to bring up the subject. \"Don't even start, Eddie,\" I snapped at him. \"I'm not trying to start anything. I was just wondering if you wanted to talk about what happened back there,\" he asked me calmly. \"I don't,\" I snapped at him again. \"I just really need my time and space right now.\" I honestly just wanted to lock myself alone in the room and try to process everything that had happened within the past two weeks. First, Eddie and I broke up, then I found out I was pregnant, then Eddie and I got back together, and then I lost the child. It was all just a lot to process. \"Okay,\" Eddie said quietly. We drove in silence for a few minutes and then he took my hand and squeezed it lovingly. \"We'll get through this together, Paige,\" he said reassuringly and smiled at me. I looked at him and tried to smile, but it didn't really come out that way. Instead, for the rest of the trip, I looked straight ahead and didn't say a word. As I assumed, the media was swarming the outside of the palace entrance, which forced us to enter through the secret entrance in the back. \"If some paparazzi were able to sneak back here, don't say a word to them,\" Eddie instructed me. \"They all deserved it,\" I protested. \"Paige-\" Eddie began. \"I'll say whatever the hell I want to say! You can't tell me what to do,\" I growled. \"I'm just trying to help guide you as you transition into this new life. One day, you'll be the Queen of Denmark, Paige,\" he replied sternly but calmly. \"What if I don't want to be the Queen?\" I asked. Eddie parked the car and turned to look at me. He was concerned. \"What do you mean by that?\" He asked. \"I mean that I want to be able to live a private life. I don't want to have to worry about what the press reports or says about us. I want to be able to mourn the loss of our baby without us constantly being in the public eye,\" I said starting to choke up. \"What do you propose that we do?\" He asked me. \"I don't know,\" I said quietly. \"Come here,\" he said gently cupping my chin and brought me in for a quick kiss. \"I love you,\" he said putting a strand of lose hair behind my ears. \"And I want to spend the rest of my life with you, and I want you to be happy. So, you just let me know whatever I need to do, and we'll make it happen.\" I just looked at him and didn't know what to say. He was trying so hard to help make everything okay and to help make me happy, but the truth was that no one would be able to take away this pain that I was feeling- not even the King of Denmark.[Chapter 24] I woke up the next morning with the bright sun pouring through my window. I hear the faint sound of water running, and I knew that Eddie was in there taking a shower, getting ready for Parliament. Suddenly, the emotions and memories of the past few weeks came flooding over me, and I started crying. It was the type of crying that you feel as though you cannot control. It is as though it is your body's way of cleansing itself since the sadness and emotions are just too overwhelming. Eddie and I went to bed that evening with a deafening silence between us. I didn't want to talk about anything that happened- our break-up or the baby. I just wanted to be left alone and to have my space, which he respected. I knew he wanted to make it all better and to try to take the pain away, but that was impossible. When he came out of the shower, I pretended to be asleep. I didn't want to talk today either. \"Paige?\" he asked when he came out of the shower and started to get dressed. I ignored him and feigned a deep sleep. After he had finished dressing, he came over and gave me a gentle kiss on the head and then he began to lovingly stroke my hair. My eyes fluttered open unintentionally. I wanted him to hold me and to tell me that everything was going to be okay, but at the same time, I wanted to be left alone. \"How are you doing today?\" He asked, kneeling down to be eye level with me. \"Okay,\" I lied. \"Well, just take it easy today. I have to go to Parliament today; we have meetings all day. But rest, try to enjoy today, and I'll be checking in on you. I love you,\" he said giving me a quick kiss on the lips. \"I love you too,\" I replied. After he left, I looked at the clock. It was 7:20, if I got up now and hurried, I would be able to make it to my 8am class. I had already missed 3 days of classes- I didn't want to miss anymore. I knew the doctor wanted me to take the rest of the week off to rest, but I was feeling better. Besides, if I stayed here, I would spend the majority of the day crying in my room. It would be better to move on with my life and distract myself. I got up, got dressed, grabbed a bagel, and watched some TV as I got ready. The new media continued to have field day with my outburst. The clip where I cursed and yelled at the reporters outside of the hospital was played over and over on almost every channel. Even Good Morning Denmark played it and then a drug and alcohol counselor was interviewed to try to help explain \"what I was going though.\" \"Emotional outbursts and anger issues are common amongst people with addiction problems,\" the counselor had said on the show. \"You never would have guessed from when we met her and interviewed her! She seemed so nice!\"Agnetha, the host of the show, exclaimed. \"People with addiction will try to act as though nothing is wrong. Sometimes, it's only close family and friends who can truly recognize the signs,\" the counselor replied. I rolled my eyes and changed the channel. No one had no idea what I was going through. \"I guess the real question is- is King Edvard still going to marry Paige Morgan?\" The newscaster on another channel asked. \"Seriously!?\"I yelled at the TV the clip of me leaving the hospital was re-played. \"I don't know,\" another newscaster commented. \"Can she handle the pressures of being the Queen with all of these problems?\" \"And let me tell you! She has problems!\" The other one commented before they all burst into laughter. \"Screw you!\" I yelled at the TV before I turned it off. Didn't these people have lives!? I decided to leave early and walked to campus for my classes. On the streets, I could feel people's eyes on me. On campus, the attention was extremely unwanted. Everyone's eyes followed me in my classes and on campus. \"I heard she overdosed on cocaine,\" someone behind me whispered to their friend. \"I heard she mixed cocaine and heroine with alcohol and became unconscious,\" the other one whispered. I was tempted to turn around and snap at them, but the professor walked through the door and began talking, which interrupted my thoughts. \"Sorry I'm late! The elevator was broken, and I had to walk up all 5 flights of stairs. Needless to say, I'm not in that good of shape,\" she said pulling out her materials for the class. We all laughed at her joke. \"If you were absent for our previous class, please come and speak with me after class about making up the vocabulary pop quiz. Now, turn to page 96 and look at...\" her voice droned on. I sighed and made a note to speak with her after class. Danish 101 was kicking my butt, and it was extremely important that I master the language. After class, I went up to the professor to talk to her about making up my pop vocabulary quiz. And since this class actually 4 times a week, I'm sure there was a lot more that I missed since today was Thursday. I essentially missed a week of class. I dreaded this conversation since this professor wasn't the friendliest. \"Ah! Ms. Morgan, nice to see you have joined us today,\" she said finally acknowledging me after she talked to the other students who had gone up to her after class. \"I was wondering if I could come by your office during your office hours tomorrow to make-up the quiz?\" I asked. \"That's fine,\" she said. \"But the quiz is going to be different than the quiz given in class the other day. You also need to make up these work-sheets,\" she said handing a few pieces a paper, \"you need to remember that the online homework is due next Wednesday, and we have a test next Thursday. And then we'll be preparing for our oral exams. You can't afford to miss anymore class,\" she said looking at me. \"Remember also that participation is 15% of your grade. You have too many unexcused absences.\" \"I'm sorry- I don't usually miss this many classes. I can get you a doctor's note if you need one; I had a medical emergency,\" I explained. \"Look, I don't know what happened, and it isn't my place to judge. But if you truly had a medical emergency, you can bring in a doctor's note,\" she said sternly and lowering his glasses to make direct eye contact with me. \"Okay,\" I said. I'll see you tomorrow in my office for the quiz,\" she said snapping her briefcase and ending our conversation. \"Yes ma'am,\" I replied. I left and looked at my phone. It had been blowing up today by Jake, Sara, Clara, my mother, and some of my other extended family in the US. I ignored all of their messages. I didn't want to talk about any of it. As I looked down at it now, I saw that Eddie had texted me about 5 times and called me 3. I realized then, around 3:30, that I had forgotten to tell him what I was doing today, and I had been ignoring him all day. I sighed and looked at the time. I still had to run to my chemistry professor's office to pick up the lab packet and then I had his class. I'd just have to talk to Eddie when I got back. Besides, he was in Parliament anyway; it wasn't like he would see the message until later. \"Paige!\"I heard a familiar voice call. I knew that voice- it was Sara's. Instead of responding to her, I pretended like I didn't hear her and continued walking. \"Paige!\" I heard her yell harder this time. I continued to walk. \"PAIGE!\" She yelled again. I sighed. I couldn't pretend like I didn't hear that one. As I turned around, I saw Sara running over to me. \"Hey! Oh my, you look like death,\" Sara said as she came up closer to me. She was never one to put a filter through her thoughts. I unintentionally rolled my eyes and started to walk away. I didn't want to deal with any of this. \"Hey!\" She said grabbing onto my arm to stop me from leaving. \"Are you okay? I left you like a hundred messages! You never returned any of them.\" As I turned back around, I could see that she was genuinely concerned. \"Yeah, I'm fine,\" I lied. \"What happened? Why were you in the hospital?\" She asked me. \"I don't want to talk about it,\" I said quietly. \"What?\" She asked, not hearing my answer. \"I said, I don't want to talk about it,\" I snapped at her. She was taken back by my tone and took a step back. \"Okay,\" she said dropping the conversation. \"I have to get going. I'll see you later,\" I said walking away before she had the chance to respond. I knew she didn't deserve the way that I just treated her, but it was so much easier to simply to push everyone away so I wouldn't have the time to think about what happened. If I didn't talk about it or think about it, I would be able to pretend as though it never happened. After class, I walked back to the palace and went straight up to my room. Sometimes, I would do a little chit chat with this one worker around my age who worked in the kitchen, Maddie, but today I passed right by her in the hallway and pretended as though I didn't see her. \"Miss!\" I heard her call to me as I continued walking. \"Paige!\" She said being less formal and more friendly like when it is usually just the two of us talking. I sighed and turned around and tried not to act annoyed. I just wanted to get back in my room, study for my Danish quiz, and then crawl into bed and sleep until I had to face tomorrow. \"Hey Maddie,\" I said trying to be friendly, but it came out as being slightly annoyed. \"You have a surprise waiting for you in the sunroom!\" She exclaimed, genuinely happy. \"I just honestly want to get back to my room,\" I replied. \"I was given strict orders by the King to make sure that you stopped by the sunroom first,\" she said smiling. \"Come on!\" She said taking me by my wrist and pulling me in the direction of the sunroom. We arrived and I opened the door and gasped. I saw my mother and Johnny having tea with King Harold. \"Mom!? Johnny!?\" I exclaimed running to them. \"Paige!\" They both said in unison, jumping up to great me. We all embraced, and I saw Maddie and King Harold smiling. \"I told you that you would like this surprise,\" Maddie said. \"When did you guys get in?\" I asked my mom and brother. \"We got in around noon!\" My mom exclaimed. \"Johnny goes back on Monday; he's on fall break now. And I'll be leaving Wednesday. Hopefully, I can convince my boss to let me stay till Friday,\" she said smiling. \"You know, Frenchie doesn't have too shabby a place here,\" Johnny said smiling. \"I suppose you'll be able to survive here, Paige,\" Johnny joked. \"Frenchie?\" King Harold asked. \"When they met him for the first time, they just knew that he was European so that was the nickname that they gave him,\" I explained. \"So, the prodigal fiancée has finally returned home,\" I heard a familiar voice joke. I turned around and saw Eddie standing at the doorway to the sunroom. \"Hey,\" I said going over to him. He leaned down and gave me a quick kiss on the lips. \"You planned all this!?\" I asked, surprised. \"I knew that they were coming to visit, and I wanted to keep it a surprise for you,\" Eddie said grinning from ear to ear. I knew that he was pretty pleased with himself for having kept this secret and truly pulling off the surprise of a lifetime. \"Well, it was a very nice surprise,\" I commented, taking his hand and squeezing it. \"Thank you.\" \"I have a dinner planned for all of us this evening, and maybe we could show them around town afterwards?\" Eddie suggested. \"It sounds good but I may have to retire after dinner. I have a Danish quiz tomorrow that I need to study for,\" I explained. Eddie's face fell, and I knew the reason- he was upset that I went to school today against the doctor's orders. My mom didn't know what the doctor said or else she probably would have been upset with me as well. Remembering about what the doctor said made me remember everything that had happened recently For a moment, when I first saw my mother and brother, I had forgotten about it all, and I felt happy again- for the first time in a long time. But now, reality was hitting me again. It came over me, and I began to panic and I wanted to cry. \"I'm going to go put my book bag away in my room, and I'm going to get ready for dinner,\" I said excusing myself. I entered my room, and I felt my phone vibrate. I had a text from Sara. It read: I know you don't want to talk about what happened, but I'm worried about you. And I don't believe a word of what the tabloids printed. I'm here for you if you ever want to talk. All of the tears that I had been holding back finally came to the surface as I sat down on my bed and cried as I read her message. Why did this have to happen to me? If I had gotten medical attention, would there have been a way to save the baby? Was this all my fault? I heard the door open quietly behind me. I quickly tried to wipe the tears away from my face. Couldn't I just be left alone for five minutes? \"Paige,\" I heard my mom's voice say as she walked towards me. \"I'm sorry,\" I sobbed. \"I'm so sorry about everything,\" I said leaning into her. \"Shhhhhhhhh,\" she said patting my back. \"It's okay. It's not your fault. It's not your fault at all.\" \"I knew for so long, and I never told you. I shouldn't have lied. I should have told you. Maybe this wouldn't have happened. I feel like it was all my fault,\" I sobbed into her chest. \"You were scared, Paige. You would have told me eventually. You just needed time. I forgive you.\" \"But you would have encouraged me to get pre-natal care sooner. Maybe I could have saved the baby...\" I said trailing off. My mother held me closer to her. \"It was an ectopic pregnancy, Paige. There was nothing that you could have done to prevent losing the baby,\" my mother soothed. \"I just feel like it's still my fault,\" I sobbed. \"I know you do. That's normal. But you have to realize that it wasn't your fault,\" my mother said trying to comfort me. \"I know, but I still feel horrible. It hurts so much,\" I sobbed. \"Ectopic pregnancies is when the egg becomes fertilized in the fallopian tube and never travels down to the uterus. You would have died if you never lost the baby. It's a medical emergency. I'm just glad you finally got help. There was nothing you could have done. You have to realize that,\" my mother said. \"It was so hard these past two weeks. First, Eddie and I split up and then I found out I was pregnant and was trying to deal with all that on my own. Then, I lose the baby and find out that it would have never been carried to term anyway because it was an ectopic pregnancy. I'm just so overwhelmed. I want to just stay in bed all day and cry,\" I sobbed. \"It's okay. We are all here for you, Paige. I'm ready to talk and listen at any time,\" my mother said reassuringly. \"I know what you are going through,\" my mother said after a few moments of silence. \"You do?\" I asked looking at her confused. \"Yes. Before I had you, I had a miscarriage. I was 3 1/2 months pregnant. It was so hard, but I had to realize that it wasn't my fault. You'll get through this,\" My mom said trying to comfort me. \"I have no doubt in my mind that you'll see your child again one day.\" I know she was trying to make me feel better, but it just made me cry harder. \"I'm glad you're here,\" I said sniffling. \"I want to go home with you at the end of this week. I don't want to stay here any longer. I want to go home.\" \"You are home now,\" my mother said. Those words really hit home- I was home now. Sure, Wisconsin would always be my home, but I guess this was my new home. Was I really ready for all of this? Part of me wasn't sure...[Chapter 25] In the middle of the night before I got up, I finally decided to text back Sara. It wasn't fair to keep her hanging. She took me in when I had nowhere else to go, and I owed her an explanation. I lost the baby , I texted to her and hit send. Oh no! I'm so sorry! How are you doing? What happened? She texted back almost immediately. I'm pretty much a trainwreck. It's been rough. It was an ectopic pregnancy, so the baby was never going to be carried to term. I woke up in the middle of the night after the fall ball bleeding really heavily. I had warning signs that entire night- lots of cramping, pain, and nausea. I should have gone sooner to get help. I know it wasn't my fault, but I still feel like it is. I'm sorry for snapping at you on campus yesterday- you didn't deserve it. It's okay! She responded. I'm really sorry to hear about your loss though. I'm here for you if you need me, okay? My mom is an OBGYN in the US, and she has a support group for mothers who have miscarried. If it wasn't on another continent, I would tell you to go! Lol Thanks, I responded. I guess I should consider myself lucky- I didn't have to go through surgery so my chances of conceiving in the future (like far far far away future) are still pretty high. If they had to remove one of my fallopian tubes, the doctor said it would have been a lot harder. I'm going to go to sleep now. I'll talk to you later, and I'll see you around. Maybe a coffee date with you, me, and Clara when things aren't so crazy? :-) YES! Sara responded. We miss you at the apartment. There isn't anyone here cooking good food! :p If you ever want to come back, you know you are more than welcome. :-) Haha thanks! Eddie and I are actually engaged again, so hopefully I won't have to take you up on that again haha. And my mom and brother are here visiting for the week :-) I responded. WHAT!? OMG! I'm so happy for the both of you! Now, we have to hang out because I have to give you a big hug! Thanks :-) I said. I set my alarm on my phone and went to sleep finally. My alarm went off way to early the next morning. Eddie slept in his own room since my mother and brother were staying in the palace as well. I stayed up late studying for my Danish quiz, then texted Sara and then slept a few hours. The lack of sleep wasn't helping my depression. I got up, went to class, skipped my clinical, and went home. I wasn't allowed to stand on my feet yet for long periods of time. The doctor who was supposed to be mentoring me was excusing me. He even came in to check in on me while I was in the hospital, so he understood. \"So,\" my mom said when I got back home. I could tell she was excited about something. \"I know something that will cheer you up! Let's go get some lunch and do some shopping! You haven't shown me around Denmark yet!\" I debated it slightly before responding. It would be nice to get out of the house. But at the same time, I knew that the paparazzi would soon find us and slam us. They were required to leave me alone at school, but nothing would stop them from harassing me and my mom as we ate lunch. \"That would be fun but I have to warn you- the paparazzi will find us and harass us,\" I replied. \"About what?\" My mom asked. \"It can't be that bad!\" \"They've been harassing me over everything that happened. I couldn't even leave the hospital...\" I explained. \"Well, you shouldn't let them stop you from having a good time with your mom. Pose for the picture they want and then move on with your day,\" she said. I sighed. It wasn't like that. I wish it was like that. I could only wish it was like that. Posing for a picture and having them leave me alone would be so easy... \"Okay, let's go out to eat, and I'll show you around town,\" I said. \"That's my girl!\" My mom said getting up. \"Johnny! Are you coming with us?\" She asked. \"Heck yeah!\" He said getting up. I put my stuff away in my room, got my purse, and met my mom in the hallway. Johnny was going to meet us downstairs. He said he needed more time to get ready before he met some Danish \"babes\" on the street. We were about halfway down the hallway and heading to the stairway when we ran into Eddie. \"Where is the most beautiful girl in Denmark and her family going?\" Eddie asked me. He came over and gave me a quick kiss on the lips. \"I was one my lunch break, and I was coming to see you,\" he said. \"We are going out to lunch. Do you have time to join us?\" I asked. He looked at his watch and his eyes bugged out. \"Probably not. I have to be back in about 25 minutes. But I was definitely planning on taking you all out to dinner this evening. How did your Danish quiz go?\" He asked me. \"It went well. I think I may have slipped up on a few words.\" \"You'll learn sooner than you think,\" he said. \"She's so smart,\" he said turning to my mom. \"I know she is,\" my mom said proudly. \"I love you,\" he said taking my hand and squeezing it. \"And I'll see you soon. I'm going to go run to my office to get some work done. Text me when you all get back so if I finish early, I can join you,\" he said giving me a kiss on the cheek and walking down the hall. \"Bye, love you,\" I said. \"The moment that you brought him home for Thanksgiving as just \"friends,\" I knew that you two were meant to be together,\" my mother told me, putting the word friends in quotation marks. \"Really?\" I asked. \"Really. I saw the way you both looked at each other. \"Well, we really were just friends back then,\" I said. \"Yeah right,\" she said. \"Really! We were!\" I said laughing. \"That will be a year ago this November. I still can't believe it!\" My mother said. Wow, I thought to myself. Did I really only start dating Eddie a year ago this November? I had agreed to marry a man that I knew less than a year? Did we truly know each other? I knew that I was very emotional after everything that happened, but this realization scared me slightly. Were we moving too fast? \"Do you think we are moving too fast with all of this?\" I asked her quietly. \"What makes you say that?\" she asked me. \"We haven't even been dating for a year, and we are already planning to spend the rest of our lives together? I mean, is this true love or is this just lust? Do we really know each other? Or are in love with the idea of each other? I don't know...sometimes I just feel like this is all happening so fast,\" I confided in her. \"Did you talk to Eddie about this?\" She asked me. \"No...If I do, he'll probably think I'm breaking up with him, or I don't want to get married,\" I said. \"And that isn't true, I do want to get married to him. I just...I don't know...\" I said. \"What is it, Paige?\" she asked me, concerned. \"I know I'm super emotional right now about everything that happened, but I don't know...I guess I'm just overwhelmed. His lifestyle is completely new to me, this is a new country, new language, and new culture. I'm starting a new school, starting medical school, I'm always in the spotlight, and I guess I wonder if I'm we are just rushing into something.\" \"You've known him longer than a year though,\" my mother said. \"You just didn't start dating right away.\" \"That's true,\" I said. \"And you're in a new country. You're probably going through a little bit of a culture shock right now, but you'll adjust. You just have to give it time. You've been through a lot these past months together and if you can get through all of this and work it all out, you'll be able to work out problems in marriage too. You two love each other very much- that I can see, and I'm sure Denmark sees it too. And it your love for each other that will always overcome obstacles and challenges. Do you want to spend the rest of your life with Eddie?\" \"Of course! I can't imagine it without him,\" I said. \"You just answered your own question,\" she said. \"Thank, mom,\" I said smiling. \"Remember how heart-broken you both were without each other?\" my mom said. \"Yes, I remember.\" \"You two are meant to be together. I know you're depressed, and you've been through a lot lately but once you have some time to heal, you'll see yourself adjusting more and more and before you know it, you'll be able to call this place home,\" my mom said giving my hand a squeeze. We met Jonny downstairs by the door, and then we ventured out the palace gates. I showed my mother and brother some of the most historic buildings, the history behind them as well as some of the other hot tourist destinations, good places to shop and good restaurants. We detoured, and I showed them the University of Copenhagen, the school of medicine, the library, and even showed them inside a few buildings. The more I showed my mother and brother around town, the more I realized how this place was already becoming my home. Denmark was my new home, I would be their new queen, and I was ready to face life's challenges with Eddie right along my side.[Chapter 26] After giving my mother and my brother a tour around Copenhagen, we decided that it was time to eat lunch. \"So, what kind of food do they serve here?\" Johnny asked. \"Fish...and lots of it, \"I said laughing. \"You hate fish, and so do I,\" Johnny said wrinkling his nose. \"I've been getting used to it. They do serve other food, you know,\" I said. \"What do you recommend, Paige?\" my mom asked. \"Hmmm...I haven't been to a lot of places here honestly. People recognize us too easily so if we go out, we usually drive more towards the country,\" I said. \"Well, the paparazzi hasn't swarmed us yet,\" Johnny said. \"I don't think people recognize me without Eddie,\" I said. We decided to go to this pasta restaurant in downtown Copenhagen. Once we entered, we were seated and we placed our drink orders. We had a lovely lunch together, and we were unnoticed by the people around us and the press. If anyone did recognize me, no one said anything. However, leaving the restaurant was a different story. As we approached the door to exit, I was about twenty paparazzi outside. I sighed. I was stupid to think that I would have been able to escape them today, especially after what had happened. \"Keep your head low, don't talk to them, and just keep on walking,\" I instructed my mother and Johnny. I took a deep breath and braced myself to go outside and face the paparazzi. \"Paige Morgan! Who are these people?\" Someone yelled. \"Are they friends of yours?\" Someone else yelled. \"Are you seeking help for your drug problem?\" Someone else yelled. \"Does your family know about your addiction?\" The reporter from the hospital yelled at me again, trying to get a reaction from me. \"Do they know the real reason you were in the hospital?\" \"Excuse me,\" I said as I tried to get through. It was hard to see with all the flashing cameras, and there was a what seemed like an ocean full of them. I grabbed my mom's hand, and Johnny took my mom's so we created like a chain. I pushed through the crowd of paparazzi, desperately trying to get out of this mess. As much as I wanted to yell, I bit my tongue to prevent any harsh words. I didn't need any more bad press. \"Are they going to follow us?\" Johnny asked. \"Don't give them ideas,\" I said groaning. \"What were you hospitalized for again? An overdose on cocaine and alcohol!? Have you been getting the help that you need? Will King Edvard really make a drug addict the next queen?\" The reporter from the hospital yelled again. I turned around and glared at him. \"What the hell is wrong with you!?\" Johnny yelled. \"She just lost a baby! Show her some respect! She isn't a toy doll to be thrown around!\" Johnny yelled at the reporters but directing his words and anger to the reporter from the hospital. \"Johnny,\" I scolded softly. I was glad that he told the reporters off, but I wasn't happy that he told them my secret that I wasn't ready to let the world know yet. The reporters became silent and even the flashes died down. \"Is that true?\" Someone asked me. \"I need to get going,\" I said avoiding the question. \"Were you carrying King Edvard's baby or Jake Smith's baby?\" Someone else yelled at me. \"Excuse me,\" I said breaking through the crowd finally. We continued walking, and they seemed to stop following us. They knew that there was nothing more that they could get out of me. Although, I was afraid that they would try to corner Jonny sometime and try to grill him some more. The press already had too much personal information. However, would anyone believe it? First I was a drug addict and now I am pregnant? Maybe they made their own bed...and people would think that it was all a bed of lies. \"Who's Jake Smith?\" Johnny asked me as we arrived at the palace and out of sight from any press and there was on one around us. I groaned. \"It's a long story,\" I replied. \"A very long story.\" \"I didn't him everything that happened since he was away at college,\" my mother said. I sat down at a bench and motioned for Johnny to join me. Once he did, I told him everything that happened- the picture, how Eddie and I had split, the pregnancy (which he did know about), how we got back together, and how his mother was behind the picture of me kissing Jake. \"Wow,\" Johnny said once I had finished telling him everything. \"That's messed up,\" he said. \"I know,\" I said. \"Eddie is refusing to speak with her. But if you see a cold, emotionless woman in the hallway, you'll know who that is,\" I said. \"It's been a lot to take in and process these past few days,\" I said. \"We love you, Paige,\" he said giving me hug. \"You'll get through this all,\" he said. \"Thanks,\" I said getting misty eyed. \"And I'm sorry for losing my cool back there. So, the press thinks that you were in for a drug overdose?\" Johnny asked me. \"Unfortunately, yes,\" I said sighing. \"It's the rumor that's been going around, and all of the newspapers and magazines are jumping on it. It's even on the TV news too. It's so frustrating,\" I said. \"I know you didn't want to tell the world about what had happened but maybe you can turn this situation into a good one,\" my mother suggested. \"You're like a celebrity here. People would listen to you if you brought awareness to miscarriages. The are other women in Denmark and all over the world who are going through the exact same pain that you are.\" \"Yeah, I felt like a Kardashian back there- that was-\" Johnny started to say. \"So, turn a bad situation into a good one?\" I asked my mom and unintentionally interrupting my brother. \"Yes,\" my mother said smiling. \"I bet other mothers would love to relate to another person who is going through a similar situation.\" I thought about it, remembered what my mother had shared with me about her own miscarriage and realized that she was right. Even though I was suffering and going through a lot of pain right now, maybe I could turn a bad situation into a good one and help other mourning mothers like myself. After giving my mother and my brother a tour around Copenhagen, we decided that it was time to eat lunch. \"So, what kind of food do they serve here?\" Johnny asked. \"Fish...and lots of it, \"I said laughing. \"You hate fish, and so do I,\" Johnny said wrinkling his nose. \"I've been getting used to it.

Even though I was suffering and going through a lot of pain right now, maybe I could turn a bad situation into a good one and help other mourning mothers like myself.[Chapter 27] After we got back into the palace, I excused myself to go study and catch up on my schoolwork. I was really behind after missing 3 days of school, but I would be able to catch up- I just didn't want to fall any further behind. As much as I loved that my family was here, I was torn between spending time with them and catching up on my schoolwork. I sat down at the desk in my room and made a schedule of what I would get completed each day so that I would be back on track by the end of the weekend. After completing that task, I sighed and looked at the clock in my room. Eddie should be in his office by now, and I never texted him to tell him that we were back home. He had been nothing but kind to me and trying to help me in every way possible to make me happy again, and I had been nothing but cranky and tended to snap at him, especially in the car ride back home from the hospital. I needed to talk to him to make things right. I walked down the stairs and down the hallway till I saw his office home into view. Then, I knocked on the door and waited for his response. \"Come in,\" I heard him say. I opened the door and closed it quietly behind me. \"Hey!\" I heard him say once he saw me come inside. \"This is a nice surprise,\" he said getting up and came over to give me a kiss on the cheek. I smiled at him. \"We got in a little while ago; I'm sorry that I forgot to text,\" I said. \"It's okay. I just wanted to come see you and check on you when you came back here,\" he said taking my hand and leading me to the couch in his office so we could sit down next to each other. \"How are you doing?\" he asked me once we sat down. \"I've been better,\" I said getting teary-eyed. \"It's okay. I'm here for you. I will always be here for you until the day I take my last breath,\" he said wiping the tears off of my face. \"I love you, and I'll never be able to forget how I almost let you go due to the shenanigans that my mother plotted. Could you ever forgive me for being such an asshole and not believing you?\" He asked me. \"Only if you can forgive me for the way that I've been treating you these past few days-\" I started to say. \"You have nothing to apologize for,\" Eddie said cutting me off. \"No, I have been angry and hurt, and I've been taking it all out on you starting with the car ride back from the hospital and just throughout the past two days. I'm really sorry. You didn't deserve any of it. You were just trying to help. I'm sorry,\" I said breaking down finally. I had been trying so hard to hold it all inside me, but it all came pouring out. \"Come here,\" he said holding me against his chest. He held me tightly as I sobbed. \"I'm so sorry,\" I said. \"You have nothing to apologize for, Paige. We are both going through a lot. We lost each other and then the baby. It's a lot to process. I've been having a hard time too,\" Eddie confided in me. \"You are?\" I asked. \"Yes, I have. I'm upset that I almost lost you- my soul mate and the love of my life- all because of my mother and Kirsten. And I'm upset that we lost our child. I've been feeling depressed and sad too, but I've been trying to be upbeat for you. We have a lot to be thankful for, Paige. We are together, and we are about to start a life together,\" he said stroking my ring finger. \"We love each other, and we are both reaching our goals. I was looking at this online program to get a Master's of Arts in History, and you are going to medical school.\" I looked at him slightly confused. \"Really? Since when?\" I asked. This was the first time that I was hearing about this. \"After we broke up, I thought about going back to school. I know that I wouldn't have the time to go to an actual campus, but history always interested me. So, I looked up some online programs, and I'm seriously considering it.\" \"That would be great,\" I said smiling at him. \"I'd love us both continuing our education,\" I said. \"I couldn't agree more,\" he said pulling me into his chest. I inhaled his cologne. I missed that smell so much those days that we were separated. Smelling it again was comforting. I placed my arms around his waist and pulled him closer to me. \"Promise me that we won't ever lose each other again,\" I whispered trying to hold back the tears. He lifted my chin to pull my face up so that we were making eye contact. \"Unless you kick me out,\" he said smiling and trying to make a joke, \"I will always be here right at your side.\" He gave me a kiss on my forehead, and I snuggled my face back into his chest and pulled him close to me. We stayed like that for a few minutes. It was just silence, but it was comforting. Eddie began to stroke my hair. \"You know, we can talk about it if you want,\" he told me. I could fell the tears coming, and I shook my head no without saying anything. I knew that if I spoke, I would begin crying. \"Are you sure?\" he asked me. I shook my nodded my head without making eye contact with him. I was crying at this point. I assume he felt the tears on his shirt because he pulled my face up so that we could make eye contact again. \"I'm sorry,\" I said bursting into tears. \"It's okay, you have nothing to apologize for,\" he told me. \"What you are feeling is completely normal.\" I looked up at Eddie, and I saw he was getting teary eyed too. \"I've been having a hard time too. But I've been trying to hide it for you. And I see how much pain you are in, and I know that I can't do anything about it, and it kills me,\" he said crying at this point too. \"Whenever I see a mother with a baby or a child, I feel this jealous and this pain. I know we weren't planning on a baby, but I had finally adjusted and accepted the idea. I know that we won't ever get to know that child, and it breaks my heart,\" I said crying. \"You know that my breasts would sometimes leak milk while I was pregnant, and they were leaking again last night. My body and my hormones still think that I am pregnant, but I'm not.\" And then, I finally told him what had been destroying me on the inside the most. \"I saw the fetus in the hospital,\" I blurted out, sobbing. \"What do you mean?\" Eddie asked me. \"When my body expelled the fetus, I saw it,\" I sobbed. \"And I guess that's why I can't move on and accept it. I saw it on my sanitary napkin when I went to the bathroom. I saw what would have been our baby. It was small, about the size of a small coin, but it was still there. I feel like all of this would have been easier if I hadn't seen it. But seeing it made everything so much more real,\" I sobbed. I was so upset that I was shaking. I saw that Eddie was crying and was pretty upset as well. \"I'm so sorry that you had to deal with that,\" he said pulling me into his chest. \"What did you do with the fetus?\" He asked me. \"I wrapped it up, and I told a nurse about it. She said that she would take care of it,\" I said quietly. \"You should have told me about this before. You shouldn't have dealt with this on your own,\" he said. \"I know. I'm sorry,\" I whispered. \"You know, if our baby was here right now, I bet he or she would want us to be happy and to move on. It will take time, but the baby will always be alive in our heart, Paige. No one can ever take that away from us,\" he told me. \"And I personally believe that we will see that baby again one day. It just wasn't meant to be. You had no control over it.\" Those words brought surprising comfort to me. \"Thank you, that make me feel better,\" I said. \"I'm just afraid that this is an indication of the future- what if I can't have children?\" I asked. \"I know that you'll need at least one heir to the throne...\" I said trailing off. \"The doctor said that this wouldn't affected it, especially since you didn't need to have the surgery. If it boils down to it, we could always adopt a child and change the laws so that he or she could inherit the throne. Or we could just pass it down to Arabella and her children one day. I don't want you to feel pressure to provide Denmark with so many heirs to the throne. It doesn't matter. What matters is your health. And if the monarchy dies out after us, then so be it,\" Eddie said chuckling. \"Thank you,\" I said giving him a kiss on the cheek. \"I feel like a huge weight has been take off of my shoulders after talking about everything. I feel more at peace,\" I said sitting up to look at him. \"I'm glad that I was able to help,\" Eddie said taking my hand and squeezing it. I wiped the remaining tears off of Eddie's face, and Eddie did the same with mine. We both laughed and smiled at each other. There was a soft knock at the door and then Soren entered. He seemed taken aback when he saw our tear strained faces. \"I'm sorry to interrupt, but you're late for a meeting with the Primer Minister, your Royal Highness,\" Soren said. \"Soren, I told you before. Call me Edvard or Eddie,\" Eddie replied. \"That's going to take a while to get used to, Sir...I mean Edvard,\" Soren replied again. \"If you don't mind me asking- is everything okay?\" \"Yeah, everything is fine...Paige and I just needed to have a talk,\" Eddie replied not sure what he should say. \"It's okay, you can tell him,\" I replied quietly. Soren sighed. \"Shall I get your bags, Miss Paige?\" He asked. He thought that I was leaving the palace again. Eddie and I laughed at this. \"No, I'm not leaving,\" I replied. \"I was in the hospital because I was pregnant,\" I replied quietly. \"Was pregnant?\" Soren repeated, slightly confused. \"Oh Miss Paige, I am so terribly sorry to hear about this. How are you doing?\" He asked me. \"I'm doing okay. I'm doing better than before,\" I said. \"I'll leave you two. I'll tell the Prime Minister you'll be there shortly, Edvard,\" Soren said leaving. Soren gently closed the door behind us. \"I love you so much,\" Eddie said squeezing my hand tightly. \"Are you still up for dinner tonight?\" He asked me. I wiped the tears from my eyes and nodded. He leaned forward and gave me a sweat peck on the lips. \"I know that since I didn't carry the baby, it's not as hard for me, but it is still hard for me. Whenever you need to talk, you always know where to find me.\" I smiled and nodded. \"There is something else you should know,\" I said. \"Jonny, my mom, and I went out to lunch today. And Jonny yelled at the paparazzi, and he basically told them why I was in the hospital,\" I said. \"Oh...\" Eddie said. \"I know that isn't what you wanted.\" \"I know, but what done is done.\" Eddie turned on the TV to a new channel station. The reporter was speaking in rapid Danish, but I saw the clip of us leaving the restaurant, Johnny yelling at the reporter, and the Danish translation appeared underneath the screen. \"Wow,\" Eddie said once the clip finished. \"Isn't there any other news besides me?\" I asked. \"Unfortunately, this is the hot topic of the country. Plus, my mother would call it a royal scandal.\" \"Is it?\" I asked. Eddie hesitated for a moment. \"In a way, yes. When royals have children outside of marriage it becomes a scandal...even if the times have changed, and it isn't a scandal for normal people.\" I sighed heavily. \"Do you ever think about how much easier things would be if you were an average Joe?\" I asked. \"An average Joe?\" He asked, confused by my word choice. \"It's an expression that means an everyday person- your average everyday person,\" I explained. \"Yes, I do think about that. You know I would abdicate the throne for you. You just have to say the word,\" Eddie said sincerely. In that moment, even though he had told me this before, I realized exactly how much he loved me. He truly would do anything for me. When I heard him say this to me, my eyes filled up with tears. \"It's just that I'm so overwhelmed. I'm adjusting to a new culture, a new language, a new life, new responsibilities, and I'm also adjusting to always being in the spotlight all the time. If something like this happened back in the United States, only our families and very close friends...not the whole country,\" I said. \"And when we get married, the entire country is going to be watching us and our every move. I would do anything for a small private wedding.\" I looked quickly around the room, not wanting to make eye contact with this last part. \"I just...I just don't want this,\" I said barely above a whisper. \"I know that you are going through so much right now. I've been exposed to this life my entire life, so I honestly don't know what you are going through. But I know it is hard. I also wanted to let you know that you are doing great, and I am so proud of you in everything that you do. However, if you want to leave Denmark, we can. If you want to stay, we can.\" I leaned into his chest, and he pulled me to him. \"I feel guilty though taking you away from all of this,\" I said. \"Like, it was what you were born to do.\" \"Don't feel guilty. I was born into this, but if I could be anything in the world, I would honestly have liked to be a middle school history teacher.\" \"Really!?\" I asked, looking up at him, slightly surprised. \"Yes,\" he said. \"And if we moved anywhere else, I would go back to school, get my certification to teach, and become a middle school or high school history teacher.\" \"You'd be great at it,\" I said. \"And you'll be a great doctor,\" he said. Then, I heard him sign heavily again as Soren knocked on the door and entered again. \"Sir, the Prime Minister has another meeting that he needs to go shortly,\" Soren said. \"Yes, I'll be there in a moment. I promise,\" Eddie replied. Soren nodded and left the room. \"I'm sorry, but I need to get going. But I really want to continue this conversation. Can I come by your room after my meeting?\" he asked. I nodded. He gave me a kiss on the forehead, put on his black suit-jacket and grabbed his keys. I got up to leave too. \"You know, you look really sexy when you wear that suit-jacket,\" I said smiling at him going over to him. \"Really!?\" He said coming over to me and kissing me. \"I really want to stay here, but I need to go. I'm so sorry,\" he whispered in my ear. He kissed me one last time and quickly left his office. I sighed and sat down in his office for a moment alone. As I looked around the room, it was crazy to think that one day, I could be the queen of this country. It was like a fairy-tale, and my nine year old self would have been screaming up and down with joy. But my twenty-three year old self didn't want this- any of this. I looked at my ring on my left hand. I did want to marry Eddie, but I didn't want to marry him and his country. I wondered- would he truly abdicate the throne if I asked him too? His answer would decide our fate. End of Part 2 Happy Holidays everyone!
